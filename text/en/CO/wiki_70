<text>Northern Rail, branded as Northern, was an English train operating company owned by Serco-Abellio that operated the Northern Rail franchise from 2004 until 2016. It was the primary passenger train operator in Northern England, and operated the most stations of any train operating company in the United Kingdom. Northern Rail was replaced on 1 April 2016 by Arriva Rail North.

==History==
In 2000 the Strategic Rail Authority announced that it planned to reorganise the Regional Railways North West and Regional Railways North East franchises operated by First North Western and Arriva Trains Northern. A TransPennine Express franchise would be created for the long-distance regional services, with the remaining services to be operated by a new Northern Rail franchise.

On 1 July 2004 the Strategic Rail Authority awarded the franchise to Serco-NedRailways, beating FirstGroup. The franchise was awarded for six years and nine months, with a two-year extension subject to performance targets being achieved.

Serco-NedRailways&#x27; bid had assumed that some Class 142 &quot;Pacer&quot; trains would be released imminently when Manchester Metrolink services started between Manchester and Oldham. Due to a substantial delay in extending the Metrolink, it became clear that this was not going to be the case. As a result, the contract signing was delayed, and the services operated by First North Western and Arriva Trains Northern did not transfer to Northern until 12 December 2004.

In May 2010 the Department for Transport confirmed that Northern had met the performance targets, and the franchise was extended for two years until September 2013. In May 2012 the Department for Transport granted Northern a six-month extension until 31 March 2014. In March 2013 the Secretary of State for Transport announced the franchise would be further extended to February 2016.

In August 2014, the Department for Transport announced Abellio, Arriva and Govia had been shortlisted to bid for the next franchise.

On 9 December 2015, it was announced that Arriva trading as Arriva Rail North had been awarded a new franchise to run from 1 April 2016 through to March 2025.

Before Abellio and Serco&#x27;s Northern Rail franchise came to an end, unit 158906 received a refurbishment on one of its carriages which included free Wi-Fi, destination displays showing the expected time of arrival, and USB ports at each table.

==Services==
===Additional services===
In December 2008 Northern Rail introduced an express service from to calling at , , , , , , and using a unit. The 10:17 service from Sheffield on Sundays continues to Carlisle creating a direct train service between Sheffield and Carlisle for the first time since the demise of British Rail. The service returns from Carlisle at 15:10.

In May 2015 Northern Rail announced the re-introduction of a direct service between Blackburn and Manchester Victoria via Burnley following the reopening of the Todmorden Curve. The service operates hourly, seven days a week.

===Former services===
Services on the route from Thorpes Bridge Junction, Newton Heath to Rochdale East Junction via Oldham, known as the Oldham Loop Line, ceased on 3 October 2009. The line was subsequently converted for Manchester Metrolink operation and reopened as a Metrolink route in 2012.

Northern Electrics was a brand offering electrified rail from Liverpool to Manchester.

==Performance==
Northern Rail won Public Transport Operator of the Year 2007 at the National Transport Awards and was praised by the judges for attracting 20% more passengers since 2004. When the extension of its franchise was announced, Northern Rail stated that it had improved punctuality from 83.7% in the 12 months to December 2004 to 91.6% in the 12 months to May 2010, meaning that around 200 more trains per day were on time than in 2004.

In the period 15 October 2009 to 14 November 2009, Northern&#x27;s punctuality was 91.1% and reliability was 92.2%. Northern Rail&#x27;s passenger charter targets were 91% for punctuality and 99% for reliability.

The franchise agreement commits to a 15% reduction in delays in the first five years and to a new &#x27;incentive/penalty regime&#x27; and a more &#x27;local focus on performance&#x27;.

The latest official figures released by NR (Network Rail) rate punctuality (PPM) at 91.9% and an MAA of 90.7% for period 7 (2013/2014) and the 12 months up to 12 October 2013.

The annual report for 2012, published in March 2013, of the stated that Northern Rail transported 263,000 passengers daily. The customer satisfaction decreased to 80%. In May 2011 Northern Rail received the &quot;Sustainable Business of the Year&quot; award.
==Criticism==
===Approach to fare evasion===
Northern Rail had a reputation for its rather tough approach on fare evasion, and was known to take passengers to court for underpaying by a matter of pence.

==Rolling stock==
Northern Rail operated a large diesel fleet, which was used on most services. There was also a smaller electric fleet used on shorter distance services around Leeds and Manchester and on services between Liverpool and Manchester.

Northern Rail inherited a fleet of Class 142, 144, 150, 153, 155, 156 and 158 diesel multiple units and Class 321, 323 and 333 electric multiple units from Arriva Trains Northern and First North Western.

In October 2006 Northern Rail leased six former Central Trains Class 158s that had been on loan to First Great Western.

In March 2007 Northern Rail announced it would be acquiring a further 30 Class 158s from Arriva Trains Wales, Central Trains and First Great Western to replace 26 Class 142 &quot;Pacers&quot;. In the event, Northern Rail received only 19 Class 158s, but did gain eight centre carriages from East Midlands Trains in 2008 that were inserted into Northern&#x27;s ex-First North Western Class 158s. Twelve of the Class 142s were placed in store, then sublet to First Great Western from late 2007; five were returned to Northern Rail in the autumn of 2008 with the remaining seven following in the autumn of 2011.

From December 2008 until December 2011 Northern Rail leased three Class 180s for use on to and services.

From July 2011 Northern Rail received 18 Class 150s from London Midland. In 2011, Northern Rail received the five former Stansted Express Class 322s from First ScotRail.

In March 2015 the first Class 319s entered service on the to service.

=== Fleet at end of franchise===

==Stations==
In 2009, Northern Rail operated 471 stations; more than any other train operating company in the UK. 
The number fell to 462 later in the same year following closure of the Oldham Loop Line, 
and increased to 463 by 2013. New stations include Buckshaw Parkway in 2011, and James Cook in 2014. By 2013, trains operated by Northern Rail called at 526 stations.

==Depots==

The maintenance depots used by Northern Rail were located at:

The train crew depots were located at:

To run the Cleethorpes to Barton service, one class 153 was stabled at Cleethorpes overnight and was cleaned, the train crew which ran the service were First TransPennine Express staff.

<doc id="1297203" wikidata="Q430284" url="?curid=1297203" title="Marbled hatchetfish">
<text>The marbled hatchetfish (&quot;Carnegiella strigata&quot;) is a small, in length, freshwater ray-finned fish. The small deep-bodied fish, in the genera &quot;Carnegiella&quot;, is from the family Gasteropelecidae which includes both &quot;Gasteropelecus&quot; and &quot;Thoracocharax&quot;. Native to South America, &quot;C. strigata&quot; can be found in the Caqueta River in Columbia, the lower, middle, and upper Amazon River Basin, south of Amazon, and can be found in rivers and streams.

== Morphology ==

Hatchet shaped, with a laterally compressed body, it presents a gold line extending from its eye to its caudal fin while the area below has a brown and cream colored marble-like pattern (hence its name). Along its sides, the marbled hatchetfish has distinctive wing-like pectoral fins which allows them to “jump” out of water. This adaptation is like flying fish found in the ocean, yet smaller sized. The &quot;C. strigata&quot; has a very small dorsal fin located near the base of the caudal fin, and it plays a minimal role in its movement. The caudal fin is short, used for stability and control while it slowly swims along the surface. They also have an upturned mouth used for surface feeding floating at the water’s surface. Female C. &quot;strigata&quot; tend to have larger abdomens compared to males because of their reproductive organs. There are two sub species which are recognized as “two forms”: &quot;Carnegiella strigata&quot; and &quot;Carnegiella fasciata.&quot; They differ by their marbling patterns, &quot;strigata&quot; contain V-stripes and &quot;fasciata&quot; contain Y-stripes. Marbled hatchetfish are adapted to life in the Amazonian rivers as they resemble a dead leaf floating sideways on the surface of a body of water. This camouflage protects them against potential predators that may be lurking in the water. Their marble-like pattern is to give the illusion of rays of light breaking the waters surface and reflecting on the portrayed leaf. The fish itself does not move much, letting the waves and current move it mostly, but with occasional brief twitching movements. This replicates the way a leaf would be blown around or carried away by the tide or a current. The line running from its eye, to its tail, is believed to replicate the midrib (midvein) of a leaf.
== Diet ==
The &quot;C. strigata&quot;, has a superior mouth, optimal for surface feeding. They primarily consume zooplankton and alternatively they also consume other types of plankton and small insects. To feed and to avoid predators, C. &quot;strigata&quot;, can propel itself out of water by flapping its pectoral fins.

== Habitat and Community ==
In the Rio Negro region, the marbled hatchetfish lives in habitats called igapo and igrape. These habitats include lots of riparian vegetation, overhanging branches, and leaf litter. During wetter seasons the water levels along the river can rise up to 15 meters. The &quot;C. strigata&quot; are very peaceful fish but they don’t do well in communities because of their skittish tendencies. Their most comfortable community includes Characidae and other small fish.

== Conservation Status ==
Listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species, the marbled hatchetfish is deemed least concerned for conservation status. The species is relatively common in the wild and widely available in the aquarium trade. Although since it is a fish species in the Amazon, its habitat can be vulnerable to other threats like deforestation, pollution, and climate change.

==In the aquarium==
The marbled hatchetfish is common in the aquarium industry. It represents one of the largest exports of freshwater ornamental fish from the Rio Negro Region with about 400,000 exported annually. Like most Amazonian fish, the species prefers softer, acidic water within the pH range of 5.0 to 8.0. As with most characins, they are omnivores. Hatchets have a tendency to be shy fish and are easily intimidated by larger or fast moving fish, so they are only appropriate for very peaceful communities or species tanks. The marbled hatchetfish is usually kept in small schools. Groups more than 5 individuals are ideal within a minimum tank size of 80cm. It is necessary for tanks inhabited by these fish to have a tight lid, as they can jump out when startled. Marbled hatchetfish are egg scatterers and have been bred in the aquarium hobby. Within captivity, the marbled hatchetfish can live up to 5 years. In studies done in the past, the marbled hatchetfish can withstand different environments for short periods without too much stress induced. This was mainly done from the high demand of ornamental fishes, and because they are easy to care for, marbled hatchetfish are low maintenance.  With their small size and simple diets they are ideal for the aquarium.

<text>Edward John Stanley, 2nd Baron Stanley of Alderley, (13 November 180216 June 1869), known as The Lord Eddisbury between 1848 and 1850, was a British politician. He served as Postmaster General between 1860 and 1866.

==Early life and education==
Stanley was the eldest of twin sons born to John Stanley, 1st Baron Stanley of Alderley, and Lady Maria Josepha, daughter of John Holroyd, 1st Earl of Sheffield. His twin brother, Hon. William Owen Stanley (1802–1884), was a Liberal Party politician. He was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford.

==Political career==
Stanley entered the House of Commons as Whig Member of Parliament (MP) for Hindon in 1831 and was later member for North Cheshire between 1832 and 1841, and between 1847 and 1848. He served under Lord Melbourne as Patronage Secretary to the Treasury from 1835 to 1841, as Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department in 1841 and as Paymaster General in 1841 and under Lord John Russell as Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs between 1846 and 1852. He was sworn of the Privy Council in 1841 and in 1848, two years before he succeeded to the barony of Stanley, he was created Baron Eddisbury, of Winnington in the County Palatine of Chester.

Stanley was President of the Board of Trade under Lord Palmerston from 1855 to 1858, and Postmaster-General under Palmerston and then Lord John Russell from 1860 to 1866. In 1861 he established the Post Office Savings Bank.

==Marriage and issue==

Lord Stanley of Alderley married Henrietta Maria (21 December 180716 February 1895), a daughter of Viscount Dillon, in 1826. Lord and Lady Stanley of Alderley had 12 children:

* Henry Edward John, 3rd Baron Stanley of Alderley (1827–1903)
* Hon. Alice Margaret (20 August 1828 – 19 May 1910), married Augustus Pitt Rivers
* Hon. Henrietta Blanche (3 July 1830 – 5 January 1921), later Countess of Airlie, wife of David Ogilvy, 10th Earl of Airlie (1826-81); a grandmother of Clementine Churchill, and a great-grandmother of the Mitford sisters
* Cecilia (3 July 1831 – 22 September 1839), died from head injury after falling from a window in Gosport, Hampshire
* Hon. Maude Alethea (1833–1915), activist for women and children
* Margaret Olga Stanley (1 March 1835 – 27 January 1836), died in infancy
* Lt. Col. Hon. John Constantine (30 September 1836 – 23 April 1878), Grenadier Guards
* Edward Lyulph Stanley, 4th Baron Stanley of Alderley (1839–1925)
* Hon. Katherine Louisa (1842–1874), later Viscountess Amberley, wife of John Russell, Viscount Amberley; mother of the philosopher Bertrand Russell
* Rt. Rev. Hon. Algernon Charles (16 September 1843 – 23 April 1928), Roman Catholic Bishop of Emmaus (&quot;in partibus&quot;)
* Rosalind Frances (1845–1921), later Countess of Carlisle, became the chatelaine of Castle Howard and a radical temperance campaigner.
* Hon. Mary Ethelfreda Stanley (25 July 1849 – 15 September 1849), died in infancy

Three of their daughters died young. A stained glass window in their memories was erected in 1860 at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Nether Alderley.

Lord Stanley of Alderley died in June 1869, aged 66, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Henry. Lady Stanley of Alderley died in February 1895, aged 87.

In the 1930s his family&#x27;s letters were published by his descendant Nancy Mitford as:
* &quot;The Ladies of Alderley: Letters 1841–1850&quot; (Hamish Hamilton, 1938)
* &quot;The Stanleys of Alderley: Their letters 1851–1865&quot; (Chapman &amp; Hall, 1939)

<doc id="1297235" wikidata="Q2991806" url="?curid=1297235" title="Piano Concerto (Schoenberg)">
<text>Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s Piano Concerto, Op. 42 (1942) is one of his later works, written during his exile in the United States. It consists of four interconnected movements: Andante (bars 1–175), Molto allegro (bars 176–263), Adagio (bars 264–329), and Giocoso (bars 330–492). Around 20 minutes long, its first performance was given on February 6, 1944, at NBC Orchestra&#x27;s Radio City Habitat in New York City by Leopold Stokowski and the NBC Symphony Orchestra with Eduard Steuermann at the piano. The first UK performance was on 7 September 1945 at the BBC Proms with Kyla Greenbaum (piano) conducted by Basil Cameron. The first German performance took place at the Darmstadt Summer School on 17 July 1948 with Peter Stadlen as the soloist.

==Commission==

The concerto was initially the result of a commission from Oscar Levant.

==Twelve-tone technique==
The piece features consistent use of the twelve-tone technique and only one tone row (&quot;the language is very systematic, it&#x27;s the true dodecaphonic Schoenberg&quot;,) though not as strictly as Schoenberg once required (for example, the ninth, tenth and eleventh tones of the series are repeated before the twelfth tone is first heard). The opening melody is thirty-nine bars long and presents all four modes of the tone row in the following order: basic set, inversion of retrograde, retrograde, and inversion. Both of the inversions are transposed. Four different types of row partitioning are evident: linear, by dyads or tetrachords, free, and by trichords. Linear presentations are ordered, strict presentations of either complete rows or component hexachords, and dominate the Andante and Giocoso movements. The second type symmetrically divides the twelve-tone aggregate into either six dyads or three tetrachords, and is found in the Molto allegro. The third type consists of irregular presentations of segments or fragments of the row, and is used mainly in the Adagio section. The last type, trichordal partitioning, is found throughout the concerto, and is a two-dimensional design created from the discrete trichords of complexes made from pairs of inversionally combinatorial rows.

==Programmatic aspects==
In order to aid Oscar Levant, for whom the Piano Concerto was originally composed, Schoenberg provided what he called &quot;a few explanatory essays&quot;:

Although this program was not included in the published score, Schoenberg told his student Marion Bauer that &quot;for sometime I have not been against program music&quot;.

==Neoclassicism and form==
Former Schoenberg student Lou Harrison said, &quot;One of the major joys ... is in the structure of the phrases. You know when you are hearing a theme, a building or answering phrase, a development or a coda. There is no swerving from the form-building nature of these classical phrases. The pleasure to be had from listening to them is the same that one has from hearing the large forms of Mozart. ... This is a feeling too seldom communicated in contemporary music, in much of which the most obvious formal considerations are not evident at all. ... The nature of his knowledge in this respect, perhaps more than anything else, places him in the position of torch-bearer to tradition in the vital and developing sense&quot;. The concerto has been compared with the music of Johannes Brahms by Mitsuko Uchida, Sabine Feisst and AllMusic.

Aimard described the sections as follows:
#&quot;very Viennese,&quot; containing a &quot;waltz&quot;
#full of, &quot;anxious fragmentation,&quot; and the &quot;sort of free Expressionist gestures that fueled his middle period&quot;
#&quot;very expressive, sombre and tragic,&quot; &quot;slow,&quot; containing a &quot;Funeral March&quot;
#&quot;very ironic and very varied in terms of character&quot;

Stravinsky has criticized the piano writing in the concerto. Mitsuko Uchida, describing the work as very difficult for the pianist, points out that Schoenberg did not play the piano very well and that he &quot;had no intention of writing effectively, or comfortably&quot; for the instrument.

<doc id="1297238" wikidata="Q750790" url="?curid=1297238" title="Top Trumps">
<text>Top Trumps is a card game first published in 1978. Each card contains a list of numerical data, and the aim of the game is to compare these values to try to trump and win an opponent&#x27;s card. A wide variety of different packs of &quot;Top Trumps&quot; has been published.

== Gameplay ==

A pack of cards is based on a theme, such as cars, aircraft, books, boats, dinosaurs, or characters from a popular film or television series. Each card in the pack shows a list of numerical data about the item. For example, in a pack based on cars, each card shows a different model of car, and the stats and data may include its engine size, its weight, its length, and its top speed. If the theme is about a TV series or film, the cards include characters and the data varying from things like strength and bravery to fashion and looks, depending on the criteria.

All the cards are dealt among the players. There must be at least two players, and at least one card for each player. The starting player (normally the player to the dealer&#x27;s left) selects a category from their topmost card and reads out its value. Each other player then reads out the value of the same category from their cards. The best (usually the largest, but in the case of a sports car&#x27;s weight or a sprinter&#x27;s 100m time, for instance, lower is considered better) value wins the &quot;trick&quot;, and the winner takes all the cards of the trick and places them at the bottom of their pile. The winner then looks at their new topmost card, and chooses the category for the next round.

In the event of a draw the cards are placed in the center and a new category is chosen from the next card by the same person as in the previous round. The winner of that round obtains all of the cards in the center as well as the top card from each player.

Players are eliminated when they lose their last card, and the winner is the player who obtains the whole pack. Some variants of the rules allow &#x27;three card pick&#x27;, whereby a player who has only 3 cards remaining is allowed to choose any of their three cards to play with. Typically, this lengthens the game considerably.

== History ==

German company Altenburg-Stralsunder launched their own brand of trumps known as Ace Trumps in 1976/77. The Dubreq &quot;Top Trumps&quot; was a card game popular with adults and children in the United Kingdom in the 1970s and 1980s, especially among boys, for whom it was a popular playground pastime. The topics tended to reflect this, and included military hardware, modes of transport and racing cars. The packs tended to be priced so that children could collect new packs by saving pocket money for a few weeks.

The original &quot;Top Trumps&quot; was launched in 1978, with eleven different packs selling at 50p each, published by a company named Dubreq. Dubreq was also known for the Stylophone. Dubreq was taken over by Waddingtons in 1982, and they continued manufacturing packs until the early 1990s. The packs from this period are now collectable.

== Winning Moves UK and Winning Moves Germany==

=== Modern relaunch ===
In 1992 the rights to the game were purchased by Winning Moves UK, who relaunched the game. The topics covered are more diverse, and include:
* Vehicles: Supercars, Racing Trucks, Motorbikes and Scooters
* Military Hardware: Warships, Ultimate Military Jets
* Scientific: Space Phenomena, Dinosaurs
* Engineering: Skyscrapers
* Wildlife: Predators, Sharks, Wildlife/Sealife in Danger, Deadly 60
* Pets: The Dog, Dogs Trust 
* Sports: Football, Cricket, Lacrosse, Rugby, WWE Wrestling, NBA
* Entertainment: Movie Stars, Punctuation, Smash Hits Pop Stars (x3), The X Factor
* Book Characters: The World of Roald Dahl: Goodies and Baddies, Jacqueline Wilson
* Comics: The Beano, Marvel Super Heroes &amp; Villains (x17), DC Super Heroes (x2)
* Television Series: The Simpsons (x4), 24, Top Gear, Little Britain, Buffy, Angel, Doctor Who (x4), Star Wars: Clone Wars, Power Rangers (x4), Merlin, Only Fools and Horses
* Films: The Lord of the Rings (x3), Star Wars (x5), Chronicles of Narnia, Harry Potter (x6), Transformers (x2), Disney Pixar
* Themed: Horror, Halloween

In these new packs a description or biography of the item on each card is included, as well as the statistics and numerical data. The cards may deliver camouflaged learning, or learning through play, as reading about the facts on the cards, and enhancing memory and maths skills through the use of comparing the data, adds an educational benefit.

Many of the packs are, like their predecessors, becoming collectable, especially those sold for limited times (such as those associated with films), or which were specially commissioned as promotional packs.

Winning Moves UK split their packs into categories based on licenses and the age range they are aimed at. The categories used include &quot;Classics&quot; (packs not requiring a license and those before Winning Moves UK started categorising their packs), &quot;Specials&quot; (sold for more for reasons such as needing a license), &quot;Juniors&quot; (aimed at a younger audience, with only 24 cards instead of the 30 and cases of a different shape) and &quot;Limited Editions&quot; (packs which have a limited stock and are &#x27;For Big Kids&#x27;). They have also introduced a new range called &quot;Very Specials&quot; which has had two packs so far, the Royal Wedding pack and the upcoming Festivals pack.

Winning Moves UK have also released some Collectors Edition packs including multiple packs in a set. The Collectors Editions include &quot;The Lord of the Rings Trilogy Gift Set&quot; including the three Lord of the Rings decks and nine exclusive Super Top Trumps cards. A &quot;Doctor Who 45 Years of Time Travel&quot; pack has also been released.

A &quot;Wedding Pack&quot; created for the director of Winning Moves, Tom Liddell, was distributed at his wedding. A very small number was produced, and the sentimental value to the limited owners renders the Wedding Pack the rarest pack.

There are multiple football packs released each year, for clubs including Manchester United, Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool. One-off packs for Newcastle United, Tottenham Hotspur, Hull City, and Everton have also been released.

Winning Moves UK also released two Politicos packs, one in 2007 and one in 2008. These were given out at political party conferences, and featured politicians such as Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.

There have been two Ultimate Packs released by Winning Moves UK. These are the Red and the Black packs. The red one is older than the black and is now out of print. These were not available in shops and were only available by winning the Monthly Prize Draw on the &quot;Top Trumps&quot; website.

Many of the newer packs (late 2008 onwards) have a &quot;Summit Challenge&quot; game on the reverse of the bar code card. These cards have questions with boxes to put answers in on the information about the pack.

A special &#x27;Cool Christmas&#x27; pack was given out to members of the &quot;Top Trumps&quot; forums. This had 19 playing cards and a 10% discount for cultandcool.com inside as well as a message from Top Trumps.

Since 2017, the manufacturing of Top Trumps packs has taken place at St Austell Printing Company, St Austell, Cornwall.

=== International packs ===

==== Exclusives ====
Different countries sometimes make exclusive packs for that country or others that speak the same language. Some of these are for TV shows or other things exclusive to that country although there are some packs that would be popular elsewhere, such as the French &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; and French, German, Italian and Belgian &quot;Asterix&quot; pack.

English-speaking countries have sold some of their packs through the online Top Trumps shop and were unavailable elsewhere. These are the All Blacks pack, only available in New Zealand and the Cricket Australia pack, only available in Australia. Only 500 of each were imported and sold in the shop.

These two packs were exclusive to the US until they proved to be quite popular so they were sold in the UK. There are some variations to the cards in the packs between the American ones and the English ones.
* Sealife in Danger available in the US.
* Wildlife in Danger available in the US.
There were 300 of the US Wildlife in Danger pack imported and sold in the PTT Shop. The American Sealife pack was never sold in the shop. An English version of the pack was printed and sold, along with the Wildlife in Danger pack.

==== UK ====
5000 Limited Edition &#x27;Borderlands 2&#x27; packs were created in August 2012. These cards were offered to independent video game retailers who let customers pre-order the Borderlands 2 video game. They will never be available to purchase as a stand-alone item.
===== Scotland =====
The Scottish packs are exactly the same as other UK packs. There have been some promotional packs given out in the &quot;Daily Record&quot;, a Scottish newspaper. The packs so far are: Scottish Football The Club Collection (2007), Heroes of Scottish Football (2008), Max Speed Supercars (2009) and Marvel Ultimate Villains (2010). There are 39 cards given away as well as a tuck box in the first giveaway and a &#x27;How To Play&#x27; card. Four cards were given away each time. The Marvel Ultimate Villains only had 40 cards to collect.
==== Iceland ====
Iceland&#x27;s Top Trumps are owned by Nordic Games which is the sales department within Iceland. These packs are the same as the Winning Moves releases.
==== Japan ====
A number of packs have now been released in Japan. These are sold through vending machines, as are most Japanese cards. They come in Booster Packs from the vending machines, or you can buy boxes of the cards.
The packs are:
* Kamen Rider
* Disney All Stars
* Super Sentai
* Trains
* Ultraman
These cards are unique as some of them are horizontal and some vertical. There are also 55 cards in each set instead of the normal 30. These cards are co-owned by Carddas.
==== Malta ====
Malta Winning moves had made a pack on Politics from Malta. This came with a special Smart Santa collector card, which did not have stats on and was not a Top Trumps card. There is also a promotion with the pack for the first person who gets all cards in the pack signed by the people on each card to win six free flights, courtesy of Air Malta, to any European destination.
==== United Arab Emirates ====
United Arab Emirates has released a pack based on the animated TV series Freej. This was only available in the UK through an occasional free gift. They are distributed by Pluto Games but are still Winning Moves packs.
==== United States ====
Two formerly exclusive packs were printed in the United States, which later became available around the world: &quot;Wildlife in Danger&quot; and &quot;Sealife in Danger&quot;. Several booster packs of cards have been exclusively released in the United States, including two &quot;Bugs&quot; packs, which are due to become a stand-alone pack, &quot;Incredible Instruments&quot;, &quot;Mysteries&quot;, &quot;Bronx Zoo&quot; and &quot;Oakland Zoo&quot;. These were sold in eight-card booster packs, with a front title card. The two zoo packs were released in limited numbers as promotional materials for their namesake zoos. Another US exclusive was the &quot;New York&quot; pack. They also had two Soccer packs, Soccer Stars and Soccer Stadiums.
==== Other countries ====
Other countries that Winning Moves make Top Trumps for are: Canada, France, Germany, Belgium, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, Italy, Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Turkey, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Iran.

Many countries only sell packs online and not in shops. A common place to buy these packs online is Amazon. A few countries have got Top Trumps shops online. These countries are: USA which delivers to Canada as well, France which delivers to Belgium and Germany as well, and also New Zealand.

Many countries have different cards in the packs that are also available in England. For example, in the US edition of horses, Morgan, Crillo and Mustang replace the cards Exmoor, Paso Fino and Unicorn in the UK edition. The US horses pack also has a totally different style compared to the UK pack. Also, front covers of packs are different. The Skyscrapers pack has a different cover in Germany, the USA and the UK.

=== Super Top Trump Cards ===
A number of Top Trumps packs have Super Top Trump (STT) cards issued for them, also known as Supercards in the United States. These cards are not available with the original pack, but are found in related merchandise, events or promotions, and sometimes made available in booster packs of 2–10 cards. For example, the popular US television series 24 has a Top Trumps pack available, but its STT card is only available with the purchase of special-stickered season 4 of 24 DVDs. STT cards for the Doctor Who deck were only available with the purchase of season 2, 3 and 4 DVDs. One other Doctor Who Super Top Trump card was released with a very special edition of the &quot;Beano&quot; magazine. A number of STT cards were made available free of charge to members of the Top Trumps club through its website, prior to 2006.

Some STT cards are rarer than others. Most of the STT cards made available via the web tend to be relatively common, although some earlier ones from popular pack titles, such as the Nazgûl (from the Lord of the Rings series) can attract relatively high prices. Cards made available in other promotional ways can be exceptionally rare. An example is the &quot;Grandmamma&quot; STT card for the Roald Dahl pack. It was given out, free, to Scouts at a charity sleepover event in 2004. Very few of these are in circulation and they are difficult to obtain even through online auctions.

Recently, several UK Super Top Trumps have been branded as &quot;Supercards&quot; as well.

=== &quot;Top Trumps&quot; books ===
In 2006, and working in conjunction with the Haynes publishing group, Winning Moves launched a line of books under the &quot;Top Trumps&quot; brand, based around the design and concept of the card game. The Books are often written by experts in their appropriate field. Subjects included sharks, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Racing cars, Motorbikes, Fighter Aircraft, Cars, Doctor Who (Series 1 and 2 together, and Series 3 &amp; 4), Dinosaurs, Airliners, Marvel Heroes, Animals, Tanks, Transformers and Football.

=== &quot;Top Trumps&quot; LIVE ===

A number of card sets can be played online against a computer opponent at the Winning Moves web sites, including two sets which is unavailable in shops. Games made include: Horror, Skyscrapers, ODI Stars (Unavailable as packs), World Football Stars, NBA 2K9, Sharks and Star Wars, Armchair General (Unavailable as packs) and Bratz.

Two LIVE games appeared on other websites. NASCAR appeared on the NASCAR website and The Boat That Rocked appeared on Facebook. Both are not available as packs. You have to log into both websites to play though.

There is also a German Star Wars: Clone Wars game and upcoming Sealife in Danger and Wildlife in Danger.

=== Mobile &quot;Top Trumps&quot; ===
&quot;Top Trumps&quot; is available through a mobile gaming service, in which users can play single player against the computer, compete against up to three friends on one mobile, or with a single opponent via a bluetooth connection. Games made include: Football Legends, Star Wars, Gumball 3000 and Moto GP and Doctor Who.

=== &quot;Top Trumps Adventures&quot; ===

A series of &quot;Top Trumps&quot; video games were released in 2007, under the title &quot;Top Trumps Adventures&quot;. Some of the packs that have been turned into games are &quot;Horror&quot;, &quot;Predators, &quot;Dogs&quot;, &quot;Dinosaurs&quot; and &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.

In 2012, GMG Play released &quot;Top Trumps: NBA All Stars&quot; for Nintendo DS and Nintendo 3DS. Unlike the vast majority of Top Trumps products, it was only released in the US.

=== &quot;Top Trumps TV&quot; ===

&quot;Top Trumps TV&quot; is a UK television programme based on &quot;Top Trumps&quot;, shown on Five in late 2008. It is hosted by Robert Llewellyn and Ashley Hames.

=== Other merchandise ===
Winning Moves UK has released other &quot;Top Trumps&quot;–related items. These include:

* Top Trumps Displayers, which can display up to ten packs. These came in a choice of four colours: purple, green, grey, and clear
* &quot;Top Trumps Ultimate Football Challenge&quot; DVD game which contains two packs; Football Legends 1 and World Football Stars as playable packs on the DVD. The DVD game comes with two video pack, trivia quizzes, a video countdown and a football Managers Top Trumps game. This last item proved to be a popular pack, and Winning Moves released it as a standalone deck.
* Lunar Jim Top Trumps cover card, released for the Space and Space Phenomena decks which was given away at the Alliance Atlantis/BBC Worldwide Lunar Jim themed promotion, 2007.
* Gunmetal Holder, a metal Top Trumps case only available to club members who win the monthly prize draw.
* 24 Gunmetal Holder. 24 of these 24 Gunmetal Holders were given out in a competition on the main website. These had the inscriptions 24 and a number out of 24 (e.g. 1/24) on the back. Only 24 of these were made.
* A &quot;Top Trumps&quot; pen was made. It had the words &#x27;Top Trumps&#x27; and the old website, www.playaday.com written on it.
* A &quot;Top Trumps&quot; mug was also made that was yellow and had the words &#x27;Top Trumps&#x27; written in red on it. A new mug was released with the World Football Top Trumps promotional pack.
* Top Trumps pop art prints reworking images from retro football packs including World Cup and Soccer Stars editions.

=== Pack exclusives ===
A few exclusive items came with packs. These are:

* TARDIS case which came with the Doctor Who 45 Years of Time Travel pack.
* Reversible title card which came with the original Star Wars: Clone Wars pack. On one side was Jedi and the other side was Sith.
* Glow-In-The-Dark cases which came with: The Simpsons Horror, Horror and Star Wars Clone Wars.
* Glow-In-The-Dark writing and images on the actual cards, in the Ben 10, Horror, Star Wars: Clone Wars and The Simpsons Horror packs.
* In many packs the backs of the cards can be put together as a puzzle. Some examples of this are in the Skyscrapers, Space, Wonders of the World, and many sports pack. These can form pictures of football stadiums, landmarks, maps, sports teams and a scale between different objects (such as skyscrapers, and planets, in the Space pack).
* Some of the card backs give extra information about subjects in the pack. For example, the All Blacks pack has information about the history of the team and the Haka, while the Skyscrapers pack gives information about French &#x27;Spiderman&#x27; Alain Robert.
* In The X Factor pack, there are eight cards (Alexandra Burke, Austin Drage, Daniel Evans, Diana Vickers, Eoghan Quigg, JLS, Laura White, Rachel Hylton, Ruth Lorenzo and Scott Bruton) that have white discs in their X Factor score category that allow you to fill in what you think their score should be.
* The Prince of Persia pack came with two bonus cards for the Top Trumps Tournament. Alice in Wonderland and Prince of Persia.
* The Cretin pack came with Regret. When accompanied by Steve Drew, also Jägermeister.

=== Top Trumps 3D ===

At a toy fair, Winning Moves UK revealed that it had started to make a Top Trumps 3D version with cards whose pictures became 3D. A number of titles have been scheduled for such a release. To work, the appropriate software must be downloaded and the cards must be displayed before a Webcam. This projects a 3D image of the image on the card, which displays once questions are answered. A number of packs were released in this format, the first of which was Bugs released in May 2009.

The 3D image has other features in addition to the user being able to make it making it move. For example, the 3D tarantula from the Bugs collection can also be made to dance, slide on ice, and hunt among other things. In the collection, Optimus Prime can be driven in truck mode and transformed into robot mode. From the &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; collection, SpongeBob can be made to flip patties.

There are various Top Trumps Showcase cards released as part of the Hamleys 3D announcement event that can display images. These include the spider (non-moveable), Optimus prime (robot mode only, non-moveable) and Wrestling arena with a fist coming through it (WWE). These can be used with content downloaded from the Hamleys Showcase main site.

Winning Moves has been often criticised for releasing the pack but not releasing the 3D content until several weeks later. This has led to outrage from buyers of the pack as they expect the 3D content to be available at the same time as the pack.

Another common feature for the 3D cards is to feature video clips. For example, the Marvel Ultimate Villains pack, released with the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; and the &quot;Daily Record&quot;, has previews of &quot;Iron Man 2&quot;.

Winning Moves originally required a different programme to be downloaded for each 3D pack. However, in 2010, they introduced a 3D hub which updates when they updated it with new packs. 

=== Activity packs ===
Activity packs are another version of Top Trumps that have now replaced the old Juniors range. They have 24 cards, two of each, with one with stats and one with information. There are differences between the two pictures to play spot-the-difference with. There are also word searches, mazes and other activities based on the pack. They come in a tuck box instead of the plastic cases. They are based on things that young children would like to play with as young children are the primary market for these products.

=== Top Trumps tournament ===

Top Trumps Tournament is a new type of &quot;Top Trumps&quot; that comes with 6 new Classics packs and a spinner to choose the pack to play. You put 6 packs of your choice into it and spin the spinner to decide which pack to play. The packs are: Movies, TV, Pop Stars, Top Toys, Sporting Heroes and WOW. The WOW pack is wonders of the world. All of the packs come in tuck boxes instead of plastic cases. It was released in October 2009.

There is also a Star Wars version of this featuring all of the Star Wars packs created by Winning Moves up until the point of release. This is available at HMV only until January 2010. It has, however, appeared on play.com as well, whether Winning moves allowed this or not is unknown. The Star Wars Tournament also comes with a new Star Wars pack, Star Wars: 30 Greatest Moments with a card for each greatest moment in the films.

A FIFA World Cup tournament was also released in May 2010 and a Marvel tournament is also scheduled for release in 2011, featuring 6 exclusive packs each.

There are also exclusive cards given out in special circumstances for the original tournament games. A list can be seen here.

=== iPhone Top Trumps ===
Mid 2009, it was announced that Winning Moves UK have been in discussions with parties to try and create a version of &quot;Top Trumps&quot; for the iPhone. A Ben 10 version was released February 2010, available for download off the App Store.

=== Mini Top Trumps ===
Mini Top Trumps were packs of football cards sold at newsagents. They contained 18 playable cards for the packs and 2 extra bonus cards for the Top Trumps Tournaments. There were 8 different cards in these packs.

Six new football Mini Top Trumps packs are to be released, available in the Top Trumps online shop and an X Factor pack were also released. These contain Predict and Win cards instead of the bonus Tournament cards that the original Mini pack had. These allowed the winner to either see a football team of their choice or, in the case of the X Factor pack, see the X Factor Live show. The X Factor finalists pack has also been released.

There is also a Super Mini Top Trumps of Disney Pixar, Cars, &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, Star Wars and Baby Animals. These are exclusive to Poundland. The cards are similar to the main decks but there are only 20 cards, 14 of which are playable, 1 instruction card, 4 advert/trivia cards and a title card. The cards also have one less stat than the main pack.

=== Shop-exclusive packs ===

* Cars only available in the Disney Store. This is a full deck compared to the other Activity Pack by Winning Moves.

=== Royal Wedding 2011 ===
For the 2011 Royal Wedding, Winning Moves UK produced a new pack of Top Trumps based on the Royal Family and guests coming to the wedding. This pack was classed as a &quot;Very Specials&quot; pack, the only one of its kind. This also led to a few promotions including giving a couple getting married a chance to get into their own wedding pack and a special WOW card was made to be played with the Top Trumps Tournament was in the packs of Top Trumps. They were also giving out giant Top Trumps cards to people who were camping out to see the wedding and giving out free packs of Royal Wedding Top Trumps to those caught on TV showing the giant cards. A special commemorative card was also handed out at the wedding itself.

== Non-Winning Moves UK packs ==
Several unofficial copies of the game have been made, both as commercial card games and online gaming sites. The BBC web site has Top Trumps variants with themes of snooker, &quot;Buffy&quot;, &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and &quot;EastEnders&quot;. Citadel Combat Cards were a similar card game from the early 1990s with photographs of various Games Workshop models. Originally based on Warhammer Fantasy Battle models, later included Warhammer 40K cards as well. A top trumps style card game called &quot;Outrage&quot; was also included in The Mighty Boosh Future Sailors Tour Deluxe DVD set.

There are also at least four educational variations of the game: &quot;Cell Trumps&quot; from Centre of the Cell, &quot;Scotland&#x27;s Suffragette Trumps&quot; (from , featuring 44 suffrage activists who campaigned across Scotland), &quot;Tree Trumps&quot; from the Forestry Commission (as an interactive exhibit in the Glenmore Visitor Centre and as a card game available in some Forestry Commission Scotland giftshops) and &quot;Timber Trumps&quot; from Napier University. Timber Trumps was, for the first few days, originally called Tree Trumps and was listed under this name on Channel 4&#x27;s Games website.

Other variations include card games that include data about specific topics. Safari Pals packs include animal data on each card so that trump style games can be played in addition to other traditional game variations includk\ing Rummy, Quartets and Go Fish. The Royal Society of Chemistry has produced a pack of Visual Elements Trumps, using element data for play. Outset Media released a themed version for animal poop called &quot;Dung Deck&quot; where players can battle statistics for frequency, hardness, length, width, smelliness, and yuck factor of an animal&#x27;s &#x27;business&#x27;.

There have been lots of other packs before Winning Moves UK took over. These have been made by Waddingtons, Dubreq, Ace and many other companies up until 1999. These packs are usually rarer than the newer Winning Moves packs as they are much older.

Companies sometimes create their own decks of cards based on their areas of expertise using the same style as Top Trumps. This is often used as promotional material or free gifts.

In 2019 a special one-off #wnf special was produced to commemorate the founders 50th Birthday.

<text>Portage la Prairie () is a provincial electoral division in the Canadian province of Manitoba. It has existed since the province&#x27;s creation in 1870.

Portage la Prairie is located in southern Manitoba. It is bordered to the north by Lake Manitoba, to the south by Carman, to the west by Turtle Mountain, and to the east by Lakeside and Morris.

Portage la Prairie itself is in the central part of the riding. Other communities in the riding include Oakville, Newton, St. Marks, and Dakota Plains Wahpeton First Nation.

The riding&#x27;s population in 1996 was 18,785. In 1999, the average family income was $45,302, and the unemployment rate was 7%. The health and service sector accounts for 18% of the riding&#x27;s industry, followed by agriculture at 13%.

Thirteen per cent of Portage la Prairie&#x27;s residents are aboriginal, while a further 6% are German.

Portage la Prairie has been held since by the Progressive Conservative Party for most of its history, although the New Democratic Party has increased its standing in the riding in recent years.

<text>Charles Richard Maxwell (April 8, 1927 – December 27, 2024), sometimes known as &quot;Sunday Charlie&quot;, &quot;The Sabbath Slugger&quot;, and &quot;Ol&#x27; Paw Paw&quot;, was an American left-handed professional baseball left fielder. A native of Michigan, he played 14 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the Boston Red Sox (1950–52, 1954), Baltimore Orioles (1955), Detroit Tigers (1955–62), and Chicago White Sox (1962–64).

Maxwell was selected to the American League All-Star team in 1956 and 1957. In 1956, he finished among the American League (AL) leaders with a .534 slugging percentage (third in the AL behind Mickey Mantle and Ted Williams); a .326 batting average (fourth in AL behind Mantle, Williams, and Detroit teammate Harvey Kuenn); a .414 on-base percentage (fourth in the AL); and 96 runs (fourth in the AL). He led all American League outfielders in fielding percentage in 1957 (.997) and 1960 (.996), committing only one error in each year. He also finished among the top five home run hitters in the American League in 1956 (28) and 1959 (31).

For his 14 years in the major leagues, Maxwell compiled a .264 batting average, a .360 on-base percentage, and a .451 slugging percentage with 148 home runs, 484 walks, and 532 RBIs. He appeared in 1,133 games, including 781 in left field, 56 in right field, and 43 at first base. He posted a .988 career fielding percentage. He was inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame in 1997.

==Early years==
Maxwell was born in 1927 in Lawton, Michigan. He grew up on his father Tom Maxwell&#x27;s grape farm in Lawton, tilling his own asparagus patch at age 12. His mother worked at the local Welch&#x27;s grape juice plant.

Maxwell learned to play baseball in an open field with stones to mark the bases. He attended Lawton High School where he played both baseball and basketball. He then attended Western Michigan College of Education (now known as Western Michigan University), playing college baseball as a pitcher in 1945. He struck out 15 batters in a game against Central Michigan in June 1945.

At the end of his freshman year at Western Michigan, Maxwell was inducted into the United States Army, serving as a sergeant in the infantry. He spent most of his time in army camps in the Southern United States. After his military service, Maxwell played amateur baseball for the Kalamazoo Bears.

==Professional baseball==
===Minor leagues (1947–1950)===
Before making his major-league debut, Maxwell spent several years in the Boston Red Sox farm system. He began the 1947 season as a pitching prospect for the Class-B Roanoke Red Sox, but he was sent early in the season to the Class-D Wellsville Red Sox of the PONY League. At Wellsville, Maxwell was converted into an outfielder. After a month with the club, Wellsville manager Tom Carey told Maxwell &quot;your control&#x27;s pretty bad, kid, but you hit a long ball. How about trying the outfield?&quot; He ended the 1947 season with a .354 batting average (highest in the PONY League for players with at least 300 at bats), a .455 on-base percentage, 52 bases on balls, 17 home runs and 79 RBIs in 92 games.

In 1948, Maxwell returned to Roanoke. He started fast at Roanoke, but injuries hampered his performance, and he ended the 1948 season with a .294 batting average with 12 home runs.

Maxwell began the 1949 season with the Single-A Scranton Miners of the Eastern League, but he was optioned back to Roanoke in early May. On his return to Roanoke, Maxwell won the Piedmont League Triple crown with a .345 batting average, 29 home runs, and 112 RBIs. He also led the league with 164 hits and 297 total bases. On May 25, 1949, Maxwell capped a comeback from a 13–4 deficit with a two-out, three-run homer in the ninth inning.

Maxwell spent most of the 1950 season with the Double-A Birmingham Barons of the Southern Association. He compiled a .320 batting average (.422 on-base percentage, .604 slugging) with 25 home runs in 192 games during the regular season. He hit four additional home runs in the playoffs for Birmingham, giving him a total of 29 home runs during his time with the Barons.

===Boston and Louisville (1950–1955)===
Maxwell was called up to Boston for the last week of the 1950 season. He made his major league debut on September 20, 1950, appeared in three games, and went hitless with a walk in nine plate appearances. With Ted Williams ensconced as Boston&#x27;s left fielder, Maxwell saw limited action for the Red Sox. One account noted: &quot;Maxwell became Ted&#x27;s caddy, playing the odd innings and games when Williams was taking a rest, and making occasional appearances as a pinch hitter.&quot;

Maxwell&#x27;s batting average in 1951 was .188 (15 hits in 80 at bats). Three of his 15 hits in 1951 were pinch hit home runs off Bob Feller, Bob Lemon, and Satchel Paige. In the second half of the 1951 season, Maxwell was sent to the Double-A Louisville Colonels, batting .255 in 40 games.

In March 1952, Maxwell was optioned back to Louisville. He compiled a .272 batting average with 21 home runs and 85 RBIs for the Colonels in 1952. He also drew a career-high 102 walks for a .410 on-base percentage. He also played in eight games for Boston in June 1952, tallying only one hit in 15 at bats.

In February 1953, Maxwell was again returned on option to Louisville. He played the full 1953 season for the Colonels, compiling a .305 batting average, .405 on-base percentage, 93 walks, 23 home runs and 107 RBIs. At the end of the 1953 season, Maxwell was named to the American Association All-Star team.

Maxwell&#x27;s strong performance in Louisville and Ted Williams&#x27; broken collarbone gave Maxwell additional playing time at the start of the 1954 season. In mid-May, Williams returned to the lineup, and Maxwell returned to a backup role. Maxwell appeared in 74 games for the Red Sox in 1954, 12 as a starter in left field, but his batting average remained underwhelming at .250.

===Baltimore (1955)===
In the off-season, the Red Sox sold Maxwell to the Baltimore Orioles as the final piece of a deal that sent Sam Mele to the Red Sox. Maxwell appeared in only four games for the Orioles, tallying four pinch-hit at-bats without a hit.

===Detroit Tigers===

====Peak years (1955–1960)====
On May 9, 1955, Maxwell was acquired from Baltimore by the Detroit Tigers for the waiver price of $10,000. During the 1955 season, he was the Tigers&#x27; backup left fielder behind Jim Delsing. Maxwell appeared in 55 games for the 1955 Tigers, 23 of them as the team&#x27;s starting left fielder.

Early in the 1956 season, Maxwell took over Delsing&#x27;s spot as the Tigers&#x27; starting right fielder. In his first season as an every-day player in the major leagues, Maxwell appeared in 141 games (130 as a starter in left field) and won a spot on the 1956 American League All-Star team. During the 1956 season, Maxwell finished among the American League (AL) leaders in most batting categories with a .534 slugging percentage (third in the AL behind Mickey Mantle and Ted Williams); a .326 batting average (fourth in AL behind Mantle, Williams, and Detroit teammate Harvey Kuenn); a .414 on-base percentage (fourth in the AL); 96 runs (fourth in the AL); 28 home runs (5th in the AL); and 87 RBIs (fifth in the AL). Maxwell also excelled in the field in 1956, with a .987 fielding percentage. His 28 home runs in 1956 was a Detroit single-season record (later broken) for left-handed batters. On October 4, 1956, Maxwell&#x27;s hometown of Paw Paw observed Charlie Maxwell Day with a banquet in his honor, a parade, and presentation of a key to the city.

In 1957, Maxwell was named to the American League All-Star team for the second straight year. Having committed only four errors in 1956, Maxwell improved his performance in 1957, committing only one error in over 300 chances. He led all American League outfielders with a .997 fielding percentage, and his 2.36 Range factor was 0.39 points above the average for all outfielders. Maxwell also continued his strong hitting in 1957. Though his batting average dipped by 50 points to .276, he finished with a .377 on-base percentage (eighth best in the AL) and 24 home runs (seventh in the AL). &quot;I was a tougher clutch hitter late in the game,&quot; Maxwell recalled. &quot;Sportswriter Hal Middlesworth told me that I led the team in game-winning hits in 1956 and 1957, even though other guys hit for higher averages.&quot;

After a decline in Maxwell&#x27;s performance in 1958 (13 home runs and 65 RBIs), the Tigers acquired veteran Larry Doby to replace Maxwell for the 1959 season, but Doby posted a .218 batting average in 18 games and was traded on May 13, leaving the left field spot open for Maxwell to reclaim. Maxwell posted career-highs in 1959 with 31 home runs (fourth in the AL) and 95 RBIs (fifth in the AL).

In 1960, Maxwell&#x27;s batting average dropped to .237, though he still hit 24 home runs and tallied 84 RBIs. Five of Maxwell&#x27;s 24 home runs in 1960 came in extra innings, making him the first player in major league history with five extra-inning home runs in a season. (Nelson Cruz later tied Maxwell&#x27;s record in 2010.) Maxwell&#x27;s defensive performance remained strong in 1960, as he led all American League outfielders in fielding percentage for the second time in his career. He committed only one error in over 1,000 innings in left field, for a .996 fielding percentage.

====&quot;Sunday Charlie&quot;====
Maxwell became known as &quot;Sunday Charlie&quot;, sometimes the &quot;Sabbath Slugger&quot;, due to his propensity for hitting home runs on Sundays. The nickname was bestowed in 1959 when Maxwell hit 12 of his 31 home runs (38.7%) on Sundays. The peak of Maxwell&#x27;s Sunday slugging success came on May 3, 1959, in a doubleheader sweep of the New York Yankees, before a crowd of 43,438. After missing 10 days with a broken finger, Maxwell returned to the lineup and hit four home runs in consecutive at bats: a solo home run into the upper deck of right field against Don Larsen in the seventh inning of the first game; a two-run shot against Duke Maas in the first inning of the second game; a 400-foot three-run shot off the facing of the centerfield bleachers against Johnny Kucks in the fourth inning of the second game; and a 415-foot solo home run into the lower centerfield bleachers against Zach Monroe in the seventh inning of the second game. After Maxwell&#x27;s fourth shot, the crowd reaction was described as &quot;pandemonium.&quot; He joined Ted Williams Bill Nicholson, Hank Greenberg, Jimmy Foxx, and Lou Gehrig as the only modern major leaguers to hit home runs in four consecutive official at bats.

Over the course of his career, Maxwell hit 40 of his 148 home runs (27%) on Sundays. When asked how he was able to hit so many home runs on Sundays, Maxwell replied, &quot;I don&#x27;t know how but I sure wish I could find out so I could do it on the other days of the week.&quot;

Maxwell was also given the nicknames &quot;Ol&#x27; Paw Paw&quot; (owing to Maxwell&#x27;s home town) and &quot;Sunday Punch&quot; by the Detroit Tigers announcer Van Patrick. He was also sometimes known as &quot;The People&#x27;s Choice&quot; due to his friendliness with fans and his pregame entertaining of busloads of kids (known as the Knothole Gang) seated in the leftfield stands on Saturdays, including &quot;catch[ing] fly balls behind his back, or between his legs, and then toss[ing] them to the youngsters.&quot;

====Pinch hitter and backup (1961–1962)====
In 1961, Rocky Colavito took over Maxwell&#x27;s spot in left field. Colavito hit 45 home runs and 140 RBIs, and Maxwell was relegated principally to a pinch hitting role. During the early weeks of the 1962 season, Maxwell compiled a .194 batting average in 30 games.

===Chicago White Sox (1962–1964)===
On June 25, 1962, the Tigers traded Maxwell to the Chicago White Sox. Maxwell had a late season revival with the White Sox in 1962. By the third week of August, Maxwell was batting .352 for Chicago, and had a 13-game hitting streak, the team&#x27;s longest that year. Maxwell wound up hitting .296 for the White Sox in 1962 with nine home runs. Maxwell also continued his &quot;Sunday Charlie&quot; tendencies with the White Sox, hitting five of his nine home runs in 1962 on Sundays, including three home runs during a Sunday doubleheader in July.

In 1963, Maxwell appeared in 71 games for the White Sox, 23 as a starter in left field, 12 as a starter at first base, and the rest as a pinch hitter. His batting average dropped by 65 points from the prior year to .231, though his ability to draw walks (31 in 1963) boosted his on-base percentage to .370.

In 1964, Maxwell had only two plate appearances both as a pinch hitter. He went hitless in those appearances. He appeared in his final game at age 37 on April 26, 1964, and was placed on waivers on May 11, 1964.

Maxwell was offered a job by the White Sox as a minor-league hitting instructor, but declined, opting instead to return to his home in Paw Paw, Michigan. His 10-year-old son, Jeff, was about to undergo surgery, and he noted: &quot;It took about three days to decide I had enough. I never knew how much fun it was to stay around the house in the summer. We went fishing and swimming and went on picnics.&quot;

===Career statistics===
In a 14-season major-league career, Maxwell tallied a .264 batting average, a .360 on-base percentage, and a .451 slugging percentage with 148 home runs, 484 walks, and 532 RBIs in 1,133 games. He appeared in 1,133 games, including 781 in left field, 56 in right field, and 43 at first base. He posted a .988 career fielding percentage.

==Family and later years==
Maxwell was married in June 1950 to Ann Fulcher of Roanoke, Virginia. They were married for over 70 years and had four children: Charles Richard Jr. (born c. 1951), Jeffrey (born c. 1954), Cindy (born c. 1956), and Kelle (born c. 1967). Maxwell lived for many years on Maple Lake in Paw Paw, Michigan. He noted in 1981 that he &quot;enjoys Maple Lake. We have a paddleboat and speedboat that we use on the lake.&quot;

After his playing career ended in 1964, Maxwell was hired in September 1964 as a salesman for Cal-Die Casting Co. of Kalamazoo. He later worked as a sales representative for Hayes-Albion Corp. and Paramount Diecasting, companies that supplied parts to automobile manufacturers.

In 1997, Maxwell was inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame.

The Village of Paw Paw Historical Commission sponsored &quot;Charlie Maxwell Days&quot; on August 7 and 8, 2010. The event included a display of memorabilia from Maxwell&#x27;s playing career, the dedication of a two-sided monument stone honoring Maxwell, a public reception where the public could meet Maxwell, a parade following the dedication ceremony, and the renaming of the local baseball field as &quot;Charlie Maxwell Field.&quot; Maxwell also served as the honorary manager of the Paw Paw Corkers for an 1860s style baseball game against the House of David Echoes.

The Paw Paw Brewing Company produced a &quot;Mr. Sunday Hopped Up Amber Ale&quot; featuring Maxwell&#x27;s name and likeness.

Maxwell&#x27;s wife died in 2021. He died three years later, on December 27, 2024, in Paw Paw, at the age of 97. Prior to his death, he was the oldest living alumnus of the Detroit Tigers, Boston Red Sox, and Chicago White Sox.

<text>The State Anthem of the [[Georgian SSR]] was the regional anthem of Georgia between 1946 and 1990 when it was part of the Soviet Union.

==Background==
The music was composed by Otar Taktakishvili, and the words were written by Grigol Abashidze and Alexander Abasheli. All three stanzas (not including the refrain) in the original lyrics have references to Joseph Stalin, a native Georgian and leader of the Soviet Union at that time. These words were completely removed after Stalin&#x27;s death as part of Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s de-Stalinization program. It is then replaced with new lyrics with no reference to Stalin. The last line of the refrain on the original version (აყვავდი, ტურფა ქვეყანავ - ილხინე, ქართველთ მხარეო), which once existed on all refrains, was removed completely and replaced with new lyrics.

It is one of three Soviet republic national anthems that does not mention the Russian people, the others being the anthems of the Estonian SSR and the Karelo-Finnish SSR. With the latter integrated into the autonomous within Russian SFSR in 1950s, it and Estonia are the only Soviet republics didn&#x27;t mention them in anthem.

== Lyrics ==
The original version was used between 1946 and 1956, and the post-Stalinist version was used from 1956 until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in late 1991.

<doc id="1297258" wikidata="Q1305852" url="?curid=1297258" title="Otar Taktakishvili">
<text>Otar Vasilisdze Taktakishvili (; ; 27 July 1924 – 21 February 1989) was a prominent Georgian composer, teacher, conductor, and musicologist of the Soviet period. Although in the West Taktakishvili is perhaps best known for his 1968 Sonata for Flute and Piano, his works include two symphonies, four piano concertos, two violin concertos, two cello concertos, and operas (&quot;Mindia&quot;, &quot;First Love&quot;, &quot;The Abduction of the Moon&quot;, &quot;Mususi&quot;, &quot;Three Tales&quot;). He also wrote several symphonic poems and oratorios, as well as adaptations of Georgian folk songs and a multitude of compositions for instruments and voice.

While still a student at the Tbilisi State Conservatory, Taktakishvili composed the Anthem of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic. By 1949 he became a Professor of the Conservatory, as well as the conductor and artistic director of the Georgian State Chorus. In 1951, he received his first Stalin Prize (USSR State Prize) for his First Symphony. In 1962, Taktakishvili became Chairman of the Georgian Composers&#x27; Union; and in 1965, the Minister for Culture of the Georgian Republic, until 1983. He was awarded the title of People&#x27;s Artist of the USSR in 1974, the Lenin Prize in 1982, and the USSR State Prize in 1951, 1952 and 1967. Throughout his career, he also served as a member of the international musical committee of UNESCO, and twice headed the electoral committee for the International Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow.

==Biography==
Otar V. Taktakishvili was born and grew up in Tbilisi, Georgia, in a musical family. He was raised by a single mother, noblewoman Elisabed Mikhailis asuli Taktakishvili, who worked as an artist at the Georgian Opera House. As a result of his mother&#x27;s background Otar had a childhood rich in music. He was also strongly influenced by his uncle Shalva Taktakishvili, who was a composer and a professor at the Tbilisi Conservatory. Shalva was one of the founders of the “Association of Young Georgian String Orchestra&quot;, and had authored operas, ballets and chamber works. Otar&#x27;s other uncle, Giorgi Taktakishvili was a cellist and director of a music school. His uncles were young Otar&#x27;s first musical guides and influences. From a young age, the composer showed great musical promise, and as a child was able to correctly guess notes played on the piano while blindfolded.

While attending the No42 School on Barnov St. in Tbilisi, Otar started his piano lessons with Tamara V. Bagrationi. He subsequently studied with several piano educators including Militsa K. Korius, Anastasia D. Virasladze, and Evgenia Vasilievna Cherniavskaia, where he met his future wife, Irina Giorgienvna Chirakadze, with whom he lived until the end of his life in 1989. Their romance started at the piano while practicing a piano piece for four hands. At the end of high school, he attended and received a diploma from the Air Force Technicuum until he began his studies at the Tbilisi conservatory.

Soon after entering the conservatory in 1942, while Georgia was at war with Nazi Germany, Taktakishvili composed the Anthem of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic. According to the composer&#x27;s own report, his mother had urged him to enter the contest for the National Anthem after seeing the words to the anthem published in the newspaper. The 19-year-old composer wrote the music “in one try”, submitted his entry and forgot about the contest. He only found out that his music had been selected when he stood outside the concert hall and heard his anthem being played.

Taktakishvili studied at the Tbilisi Conservatory under Aleksandr Gauk, Sergei V. Barchudarian and Andria Balanchivadze. The composer&#x27;s early influences were Georgian folk music, composers of the classical era, e.g. Mozart, J.S. Bach and Beethoven, and more modern composers, including Alexander Scriabin, Sergei Prokofiev, Dmitri Shostakovich. In his senior year, Taktakishvili had the opportunity to study with Dmitri Shostakovich, and that led to a long-standing collaboration and friendship.

Taktakishvili was survived by his spouse, Irina Chirakadze, who resided in the same apartment on 6 Taktakishvili street (former Riga street) where the composer lived from 1964 until 1989, as well as his son Mikhail O. Taktakishvili, who was a professor of Chemistry, and grandson Otar M. Taktakishvili, who is a physician and a composer, living in New York, And his Great Grandson Otar W. Taktakishvilli living in Ridgefield, Connecticut.

Mitchell&#x27;s first Broadway production as sole choreographer was the 1999 revival of &quot;You&#x27;re a Good Man, Charlie Brown&quot;, which he followed with &quot;The Full Monty&quot;.

Mitchell created and for many years directed the annual &quot;Broadway Bares&quot; benefit for Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS. In addition to the theatre, he has choreographed for films such as &quot;Camp&quot;, &quot;In &amp; Out&quot; and &quot;Drop Dead Gorgeous&quot;. He garnered an Emmy Award nomination for his work on &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot;.

In 2003 Mitchell was named one of Dance Magazine&#x27;s &quot;25 to Watch&quot;. He directed and choreographed &quot;Legally Blonde: The Musical&quot;, which opened in April 2007, and served as a mentor on Bravo&#x27;s reality competition &quot;Step It Up and Dance&quot; in 2008.

Mitchell created, directed, and choreographed a stage show for Las Vegas, &quot;Peepshow&quot;, which opened at Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino in 2009. He was involved in workshops for the stage musical adaptation of the film &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot;.

In 2013, Mitchell directed and choreographed the Broadway musical &quot;Kinky Boots&quot;.

<doc id="1297260" wikidata="Q6578680" url="?curid=1297260" title="Ethyl oleate">
<text>Ethyl oleate is a fatty acid ester formed by the condensation of oleic acid and ethanol. It is a colorless oil although degraded samples can appear yellow.

==Use and occurrence==
===Additive===
Ethyl oleate is used by compounding pharmacies as a vehicle for intramuscular drug delivery, in some cases to prepare the daily doses of progesterone in support of pregnancy. Studies that document the safe use of ethyl oleate in pregnancy for both the mother and the fetus have never been performed. It is regulated as a food additive in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration. Ethyl oleate is used as a solvent for pharmaceutical drug preparations involving lipophilic substances such as steroids. 
===Chemistry===
It also finds use as a lubricant and a plasticizer. Louis Bouveault used ethyl oleate to demonstrate Bouveault–Blanc reduction, producing oleyl alcohol and ethanol, a method which was subsequently refined and published in &quot;Organic Syntheses&quot;.

===Occurrence===
Ethyl oleate has been identified as a primer pheromone in honeybees.

===Precursor to other chemicals===
By the process of ethenolysis, the &quot;methyl ester&quot; of oleic acid, converts to 1-decene and methyl 9-decenoate:
: CH2=CH2 → CH3(CH2)7CH=CH2 + MeO2C(CH2)7CH=CH2

===Medical aspects===
Ethyl oleate is produced by the body during ethanol intoxication. It is one of the fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) produced after ingestion of ethanol. Some research literature implicates FAEEs such as ethyl oleate as the toxic mediators of ethanol in the body (pancreas, liver, heart, and brain). Ethyl oleate may be the toxic mediator of alcohol in fetal alcohol syndrome. The oral ingestion of ethyl oleate has been carefully studied and due to rapid degradation in the digestive tract it appears safe for oral ingestion.

<doc id="1297274" wikidata="Q2888583" url="?curid=1297274" title="Battle of Fort Oswego">
<text>The Battle of Fort Oswego was one in a series of early French victories in the North American theatre of the Seven Years&#x27; War won in spite of New France&#x27;s military vulnerability. During the week of August 10, 1756, a force of regulars and Canadian militia under General Montcalm captured and occupied the British fortifications at Fort Oswego, located at the site of present-day Oswego, New York.

In addition to 1,700 prisoners, Montcalm&#x27;s force seized the fort&#x27;s 121 cannons. The fall of Fort Oswego effectively interrupted the British presence on Lake Ontario and removed it as a threat to the nearby French-controlled Fort Frontenac. The battle was notable for demonstrating that traditional European siege tactics were viable in North America when applied properly in the right circumstances and terrain.

== Background ==
Following the beginning of open conflict between French and British colonists in 1754 with the Battle of Jumonville Glen, the governments of Britain and France both sent regular army troops to North America to further contest the disputed territories of the Ohio Country and other border areas, including the frontier between the French province of Canada and the British province of New York, an area in present-day Upstate New York that was then largely controlled by the Iroquois nations. Part of the British plans for 1755 included an expedition to take Fort Niagara at the western end of Lake Ontario. Under the direction of William Shirley, the governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, the original Fort Oswego was reinforced, and two additional forts, Fort George and Fort Ontario, were built in 1755. The planned expedition to Fort Niagara never took place due to logistical difficulties, and the fortifications around Oswego were manned during the winter of 1755–56.

The French in 1755 had the only large naval vessels on Lake Ontario, and moved freely about the lake, between Fort Niagara in the west and Fort Frontenac at the head of the Saint Lawrence River. In March 1756 they launched a winter attack on Fort Bull on Wood Creek. Fort Bull was a key depot on the supply line for the Oswego forts, which was the waterway leading up the Mohawk River and crossing over to the Oswego River watershed. In the successful attack, they destroyed many provisions intended for the Oswego garrison, and effectively ruined Shirley&#x27;s plan to attempt the expedition against Fort Niagara in 1756. Following orders of the Governor of New France, Pierre François de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnal, in May 1756 French and Indian raiding parties under the command of Louis Coulon de Villiers began harassing the Oswego garrison from a camp on Henderson Bay (south of present-day Sackett&#x27;s Harbor, New York).

General Louis-Joseph de Montcalm arrived in Montreal in May 1756 to lead the French army troops. He and Governor Vaudreuil took an immediate dislike to one another, and disagreed over issues of command. Concerned over the massing of British troops at the southern end of Lake George, Montcalm first went to Fort Carillon on Lake Champlain to see to its defenses. Vaudreuil meanwhile began massing troops at Fort Frontenac for a potential assault on Oswego. Following favorable reports from the raiding parties, Montcalm and Vaudreuil decided to make the attempt.
Governor Shirley received word in March 1756 that he was to be replaced by John Campbell, 4th Earl of Loudoun. Loudoun&#x27;s second in command, General James Abercrombie, only arrived in Albany in late June, and Shirley spent the intervening time shoring up the supply line to Oswego in anticipation of leading an expedition against the French forts on Lake Ontario. In June William Johnson traveled to the Iroquois headquarters at Onondaga, and successfully negotiated support for the British side with the Iroquois, Shawnee, and Delaware, forces that Shirley also hoped to use for his expedition. Shirley also hired 2,000 armed &quot;battoemen&quot;, men experienced in sailing and shipbuilding. Under the command of John Bradstreet, these men successfully resupplied the forts at Oswego in July, although they were attacked by a French raiding party on their way back, suffering 60 to 70 casualties.

When Loudoun arrived in Albany in late July, he immediately cancelled Shirley&#x27;s plans for an Oswego-based expedition.

=== Defenses at Oswego ===
The complex of defenses at Oswego consisted of three separate forts. On the east side of the Oswego River lay Fort Ontario, a log fortification which was constructed in 1755, was sited on a rise overlooking the mouth of the river. It was garrisoned by 370 men from Pepperrell&#x27;s Regiment, and was in fairly good repair. Fort Oswego was on the west side of the river, and had a central structure of stone and clay surrounded by earthworks to the south and west, but fully exposed to Fort Ontario, across the river. A recently constructed Fort George (called &quot;Fort Rascal&quot; by one of Shirley&#x27;s Regiment, which occupied Fort Oswego) consisted of an incomplete wooden palisade fort that lacked even loopholes through which defenders could fire, and was occupied by 150 New Jersey militiamen. The latter two forts did not have very much shelter for the occupying garrison, and there were only a few cannon for the entire complex of defenses.

Significant elements of the two Massachusetts regiments, which were under the overall command of Colonel James Mercer of Pepperrell&#x27;s Regiment, had overwintered there, and suffered significantly due to the shortage of supplies, especially food. Many men died during the winter from diseases such as scurvy, and there had been serious discussion of abandoning the position for want of supplies. While the garrison nominally approached 2,000 men in size, less than 1,200 men were fit for duty.

=== French approach ===
Montcalm left Carillon on July 16 under the command of the Chevalier de Levis, reaching Montreal three days later. Two days later he left for Fort Frontenac, where French troops were gathering along with a large company of Indians. French forces included the battalions of La Sarre, Guyenne, and Béarn, troupes de la marine, and colonial militia, while Indians, numbering about 250, came from all over the territories of New France. The total size of the force was reckoned to be 3,000 men. The governor&#x27;s brother, François-Pierre de Rigaud, led an advance force of 700 to meet with Villiers&#x27; force at Sackett Harbor before the main force set out on August 4. Crossing at night to what is now called Wolfe Island, the vanguard of the main body spent the day there before crossing at night to Sackett&#x27;s Harbor. By August 8 the entire force was assembled there, and set out the next day for Oswego.

On August 9, troops under Rigaud and Villiers marched overland toward Oswego, while Montcalm and the remaining force moved close to the shore in bateaux, landing about east of Fort Ontario early on August 10. Their stealth in movement was successful, and the British did not discover them until a small patrol boat spotted them the next morning. Larger boats sent by the British were driven away by the French field artillery.

== Battle ==
Montcalm&#x27;s engineer went to survey the British defenses, accompanied by other officers and party of Native Allies. Montcalm asked Pierre Pouchot to continue with the work of determining how to besiege the British positions.

On the night of August 11–12 the French opened siege trenches and began working toward Fort Ontario. The fort&#x27;s defenders exchanged cannon and gunfire with the French colonists and Indians until late in the day on August 13, at which point, under orders from Mercer, they abandoned the fort even before the siege trenches had reached their goal.

Immediately capitalizing on this, Montcalm occupied the fort and began the construction of batteries on the western edge of the height, where they could reach Fort Oswego&#x27;s exposed east side. Moving with all speed, the French had nine working cannon established by the morning of August 14. When these opened fire on the exposed stonework of Fort Oswego, the walls crumbled under the onslaught. The garrison, whose cannon were all pointed away from the river (not expecting enemy fire to come from that direction), eventually turned their guns around, and the French fire was returned to some effect. However, Montcalm had ordered Rigaud to lead some men across the river upstream from the fortifications, and these men, who made an unopposed crossing under somewhat difficult conditions, appeared on the edge of the clearing outside Fort Oswego about the same time that Colonel Mercer was struck and killed by a French shell. After a short council Lieutenant Colonel John Littlehales, who took over command from Mercer, raised the white flag.

== Aftermath ==
The British surrendered about 1,700 people, including laborers, shipbuilders, women and children. Montcalm refused to grant the defeated army the honours of war, as he felt that Littlehales had failed to earn them by not putting up more of a fight. When the fort was opened to the Canadian militia and Indians, they rushed in and began plundering the fort, opening the barrels of rum and getting drunk on the contents.

Amid the confusion some of the British tried to escape, and were tomahawked and killed by drunken French or Indians. Colonel Littlehales was seized by a group of Abenakis and badly beaten because &quot;he was a coward and had behaved ill.&quot; General Montcalm, shocked by the behavior, was eventually able to prevent further killings, although he claimed it would &quot;cost the King eight or ten thousand livres in presents.&quot; He then ordered the destruction of all the supplies the French did not take, as well as the boats under construction, after which the entire company, including the prisoners, traveled to Montreal.

On August 12, Loudoun finally dispatched reinforcements from the 44th Regiment of Foot and Bradstreet&#x27;s battoemen toward Oswego. When these troops reached the Oneida Carry they learned that Oswego had fallen; after destroying the fortifications there, they retreated to German Flatts, where Loudoun ordered them to stay to prevent further French advances. Loudoun spent significant effort over the following months to pin the blame for the loss on William Shirley. He was cleared of all formal charges in an inquiry, but numerous irregularities were highlighted. Shirley&#x27;s political connections in London enabled him to acquire other desirable posts later in his career.

Oswego was effectively abandoned until 1758, when the British reoccupied the area, and Bradstreet led an expedition that captured and destroyed Fort Frontenac. It was used again in 1759 as a departure point for a successful expedition against Fort Niagara, and in 1760 by Jeffery Amherst&#x27;s army as it moved toward Montreal.

<text>This is a partial list of [[weight training]] exercises organized by muscle groups.

==Overview==
The human body can be broken down into different muscles and muscle groups, which can be worked and strengthened by exercise. This table shows major muscles and the exercises used to work and strengthen that muscle.
==Lower body==
===Quadriceps (front of thigh)===

====Squat====

The squat is performed by squatting down with a weight held across the upper back (below the neck) and standing up straight again. This is a compound exercise that also involves the glutes (buttocks) and, to a lesser extent, the hamstrings, calves, and the lower back. Lifting belts are sometimes used to help support the lower back. The freeweight squat is one of the three powerlifting competition exercises, along with the deadlift and the bench press.
;Equipment: Squats can be performed using only the practitioner&#x27;s body weight. For weighted squats, a barbell is typically used, although the practitioner may instead hold dumbbells, kettlebells, or other weighted objects. Individuals uncomfortable performing freeweight squats may use a Smith machine or hack squat machine.
;Major variants: 
:Common variations include front squats, in which the weight is held across the upper chest, and box squats, in which the practitioner rests briefly on a box or bench at the bottom of the movement.

====Leg press====

The leg press is performed while seated by pushing a weight away from the body with the feet. It is a compound exercise that also involves the glutes and, to a lesser extent, the hamstrings and the calves. Overloading the machine can result in serious injury if the sled moves uncontrollably towards the trainer.
;Equipment: Leg press machine.

====Leg extension====

The leg extension is performed while seated by raising a weight out in front of the body with the feet. It is an isolation exercise for the quadriceps. Overtraining can cause patellar tendinitis. The legs extension serves to also strengthen the muscles around the knees and is an exercise that is preferred by physical therapists. Needs citation
;Equipment: Dumbbell, cable machine or leg extension machine.

====Wall sit====
The wall sit, also known as a static squat, is performed by placing one&#x27;s back against a wall with feet shoulder width apart, and lowering the hips until the knees and hips are both at right angles. The position is held as long as possible. The exercise is used to strengthen the quadriceps.
Contrary to previous advice in this section, this exercise is NOT good for people with knee problems because the knees bear most of the load, especially when they are held at right angles (90 degrees).
;Equipment: Body weight, wall or other flat vertical surface, exercise ball placed behind the back is optional as well.

===Hamstrings (back of thigh)===

====Deadlift====

The deadlift is performed by lifting a weight off of the floor until fully upright. This is a compound exercise that also involves the glutes, lower back, lats, trapezius (upper back), and, to a lesser extent, the quadriceps and the calves. Lifting belts are often used to help support the lower back. If performed with a barbell, it can be held with both hands facing backwards or with one hand facing backward and one facing forward. Both hands should not face forwards because this puts excess stress on the inner elbows. 
;Equipment: Dumbbells, barbell, trapbar or Smith machine.
;Major variants:
:Sumo (wider stance to emphasise the inner thighs); stiff legged (emphasizes hamstrings); straight-legged (emphasizes lower back).

====Stiff-legged deadlift====

The stiff-legged deadlift is a deadlift variation where little to no knee movement occurs, increasing hamstring, glute, and lower back activation. The bar starts on the floor and the individual sets up like a normal deadlift but the knees are at a 160° angle instead of 135° on the conventional deadlift.

====Leg curl====

The leg curl is performed while lying face down on a bench, by raising a weight with the feet towards the buttocks. This is an isolation exercise for the hamstrings.
;Equipment: Dumbbell, cable machine or leg curl machine.
;Major variants: Seated (using a leg curl machine variant); standing (one leg at a time).

====Snatch====
The snatch is one of the two current olympic weightlifting events (the other being the clean and jerk). The essence of the event is to lift a barbell from the platform to locked arms overhead in a smooth continuous movement. The barbell is pulled as high as the lifter can manage (typically to mid [ chest] height) (the pull) at which point the barbell is flipped overhead. With relatively light weights (as in the &quot;power snatch&quot;) locking of the arms may not require rebending the knees. However, as performed in contests, the weight is always heavy enough to demand that the lifter receive the bar in a squatting position, while at the same time flipping the weight so it moves in an arc directly overhead to locked arms. When the lifter is secure in this position, he rises (overhead squat), completing the lift.

===Bulgarian split squats===
The Bulgarian split squat is a squat variation and is performed by resting the back foot on an elevated surface, such as a bench, with your other foot out in front of you on the floor. With a dumbbell in hand or body weight, you bend and lower your front leg until the dumbbell reaches the floor, and then using your front leg, push up into starting position. This exercise targets the hamstrings, glutes, and quadriceps, making it a great full-body movement. This movement also requires good balance and stability, so core strength is also an important aspect.
;Equipment required: Bench, dumbbell or body weight.
;Variations: leaning the upper body forward slightly puts more stress on the glutes, while keeping the body straight upright targets more quadriceps.

===Calves===

====Standing calf raise====

The standing calf raise is performed by plantarflexing the feet to lift the body. If a weight is used, then it rests upon the shoulders, or is held in the hand(s). This is an isolation exercise for the calves; it particularly emphasises the gastrocnemius muscle, and recruits the soleus muscle.
;Equipment: Body weight, dumbbells, barbell, Smith machine or standing calf raise machine.
;Major variants: One leg (the other is held off the ground); donkey calf raise (bent over with a weight or machine pad on the lower back).

====Seated calf raise====

The seated calf raise is performed by flexing the feet to lift a weight held on the knees. This is an isolation exercise for the calves, and particularly emphasises the soleus muscle.
;Equipment: Barbell or seated calf raise machine; can also be done on a leg press machine.

==Upper body==

===Pectorals (chest)===

*The bench press or dumbbell bench-press is performed while lying face up on a bench, by pushing a weight away from the chest. This is a compound exercise that also involves the triceps and the front deltoids, also recruits the upper and lower back muscles, and traps. The bench press is the king of all upper body exercises and is one of the most popular chest exercises in the world. It is the final exercise in &#x27;The big 3&#x27;.
**Equipment: dumbbells, barbell, Smith machine or bench press machine.
**Major variants: incline ~ (more emphasis on the upper pectorals), decline ~ (more emphasis on the lower pectorals), narrow grip ~ (more emphasis on the triceps), push-up (face down using the body weight), neck press (with the bar over the neck, to isolate the pectorals), vertical dips (using parallel dip bars) or horizontal dips (using two benches with arms on the near bench and feet on the far bench, and dropping the buttocks to the floor and pushing back up.)
*The chest fly is performed while lying face up on a bench or standing up, with arms outspread holding weights, by bringing the arms together above the chest. This is a compound exercise for the pectorals. Other muscles worked include deltoids, triceps, and forearms.
**Equipment: dumbbells, cable machine or &quot;pec deck&quot; machine.
**Major variants: incline ~ (more emphasis on the upper pectorals), decline ~ (more emphasis on the lower pectorals), cable crossover.
*Cable crossovers
*Dips

===Lats (mid back)===

*The pulldown is performed while seated by pulling a wide bar down towards the upper chest or behind the neck. This is a compound exercise that also involves the biceps, forearms, and the rear deltoids.
**Equipment: cable machine or pulldown machine.
**Major variants: chin-up or pullup (using the body weight while hanging from a high bar), close grip ~ (more emphasis on the lower lats), reverse grip ~ (more emphasis on the biceps).

*The Pull-up is performed by hanging from a chin-up bar above head height with the palms facing forward (supinated) and pulling the body up so the chin reaches or passes the bar. The pull-up is a compound exercise that also involves the biceps, forearms, traps, and the rear deltoids. A chin-up (palms facing backwards) places more emphasis on the biceps and a wide grip pullup places more emphasis on the lats. As beginners of this exercise are often unable to lift their own bodyweight, a chin-up machine can be used with counterweights to assist them in the lift.
**Equipment: chin-up bar or chin-up machine.
*The bent-over row is performed while leaning over, holding a weight hanging down in one hand or both hands, by pulling it up towards the abdomen. This is a compound exercise that also involves the biceps, forearms, traps, and the rear deltoids. The torso is unsupported in some variants of this exercise, in which case lifting belts are often used to help support the lower back.
**Equipment: dumbbell, barbell, Smith machine or T-bar machine.
**Major variants: cable row (using a cable machine while seated).
===Deltoids (shoulders)===

*The upright row is performed while standing, holding a weight hanging down in the hands, by lifting it straight up to the collarbone. This is a compound exercise that also involves the trapezius, upper back, forearms, triceps, and the biceps. The narrower the grip the more the trapezius muscles are exercised. 
**Upright rows are prone to injure the shoulder through internal rotation and elevation of the ball and socket joint.
**Equipment: dumbbells, barbell, Smith machine or cable machine.
*The shoulder press is performed while seated, or standing by lowering a weight held above the head to just above the shoulders, and then raising it again. It can be performed with both arms, or one arm at a time. This is a compound exercise that also involves the trapezius and the triceps.
**Major variants: 360 Degree Shoulder Press (wrists are rotated while weights are lifted, then weights are lowered in front of the head before being rotated back to the first position). 
*The military press is similar to the shoulder press but is performed while standing with the feet together. (It is named &quot;military&quot; because of the similarity in appearance to the &quot;at attention&quot; position used in most militaries) Unlike the seated shoulder press, the military press involves the majority of the muscles of the core as stabilizers to keep the body rigid and upright, and is thus a more effective compound exercise.
**Equipment: dumbbells, kettlebells, barbell, Smith machine or shoulder press machine.
**Major variants: Arnold Press (dumbbells are raised while rotating the palms outwards).
*The lateral raise (or shoulder fly) is performed while standing or seated, with hands hanging down holding weights, by lifting them out to the sides until just below the level of the shoulders. A slight variation in the lifts can hit the deltoids even harder, while moving upwards, just turn the hands slightly downwards, keeping the last finger higher than the thumb. This is an isolation exercise for the deltoids. Also works the forearms and traps.
**Equipment: dumbbells, cable machine or lateral raise machine.
**Major variants: front raise (lift weights out to the front; emphasis is on the front deltoids), bent-over ~ (emphasis is on the rear deltoids), 180 degree lateral raise (weights are held slightly in front of the body and lifted over the head in a circular motion).
===Triceps (back of arms)===

*The pushdown is performed while standing by pushing down on a bar held at the level of the upper chest. It is important to keep the elbows at shoulder width and in line with shoulder/legs. In other words, elbows position should not change while moving the forearm pushes down the bar. This is an isolation exercise for the triceps.
**Equipment: cable machine or pulldown machine.
*The triceps extension is performed while standing or seated, by lowering a weight held above the head (keeping the upper arms motionless), and then raising it again. It can be performed with both arms, or one arm at a time. This is an isolation exercise for the triceps. It is also known as the french curl.
**Equipment: dumbbell(s), barbell, cable machine or triceps extension machine.
**Major variants: lying ~ (lying face up with the weights over the face), kickback (bent over with the upper arm parallel to the torso).
===Biceps (front of arms)===

*The Preacher curl is performed while standing or seated, with hands hanging down holding weights (palms facing forwards), by curling them up to the shoulders. It can be performed with both arms, or one arm at a time.
*Standing barbell curl
*Alternating rotating dumbbell curl
*Hammer curl
*The Zottmann curl gives a stronger focus to forearm training compared to the traditional curl.
==Waist==

===Abdominals ===
*The crunch is performed while lying face up on the floor with knees bent, by curling the shoulders up towards the pelvis. This is an isolation exercise for the abdominals.
**Equipment: body weight, dumbbell or crunch machine.
**Major variants: reverse ~ (curling the pelvis towards the shoulders), twisting ~ or side ~ (lifting one shoulder at a time; emphasis is on the obliques), cable ~ (pulling down on a cable machine while kneeling), sit-up ~ (have [chest] touch your knees), vertical crunch (propping up to dangle legs and pulling knees to the [ chest] or keeping legs straight and pulling up legs to a 90 degree position). Reverse hanging crunch (using gravity boots or slings to hang head down and pulling to a 90 or 180 degree form)
*The leg raise is performed while sitting on a bench or flat on the floor by raising the knees towards the shoulders, or legs to a vertical upright position. This is a compound exercise that also involves the hip flexors.
**Equipment: body weight or dumbbell.
**Major variants: hanging ~ (hanging from a high bar), side ~ (lying on side), knee raise (lying on back, drawing knees to chest).

*The Russian twist is a type of exercise that is used to work the abdomen muscles by performing a twisting motion on the abdomen. This exercise is performed sitting on the floor with knees bent like in a &quot;sit-up&quot; position with the back typically kept off the floor at an angle of 45°. In this position, the extended arms are swung from one side to another in a twisting motion with or without weight.
**Equipment: body weight, kettlebell, medicine ball, or dumbbell.
**Major variants: back kept off the floor at 45° angle, back rested on exercise ball, feet resting on the floor, anchored or kept off the floor.
===Lower back===

====Back extension====

The back extension is performed while lying face down partway along a flat or angled bench, so that the hips are supported and the heels secured, by bending down at the waist and then straightening up again. This is a compound exercise that also involves the glutes.
;Equipment: Body weight, dumbbell or back extension machine.
;Major variants: Without bench (lying face down on the floor).

====Deadlift====
The deadlift is a very effective compound exercise for strengthening the lower back, but also exercises many other major muscle groups, including quads, hamstrings and abdominals. It is a challenging exercise, as poor form or execution can cause serious injury.
A deadlift is performed by grasping a dead weight on the floor and, while keeping the back very straight, standing up by contracting the &quot;erector spinae&quot; (primary lower back muscle). When performed correctly, the role of the arms in the deadlift is only that of cables attaching the weight to the body; the musculature of the arms should not be used to lift the weight. There is no movement more basic to everyday life than picking a dead weight up off of the floor, and for this reason focusing on improving one&#x27;s deadlift will help prevent back injuries.

Wrong technique and forward lean posture with a flexed spine can lead to discal injuries of the lower back. Correct technical performance with a slightly hollow or extended back and a hip hinge to keep the normal curvature of the spine is of utmost importance.

====Good-morning====
The good-morning is a weight training exercise in which a barbell, two dumbbells, or no weight at all is held on the shoulders, behind the head. The person bends forward and bows at the hips and recovers to upright. The good-morning is so called because the movement resembles bowing to greet someone. It involves the hamstrings but is primarily used to strengthen the lower back; the degree of knee bend used will change the focus – nearly straight-legged involving the hamstrings most.

Wrong technique and forward lean posture with a flexed spine can lead to discal injuries of the lower back. Correct technical performance with a slightly hollow or extended back to keep the normal curvature of the spine is of utmost importance.

<text>Rózsa Péter, born Rózsa Politzer, (17 February 1905 – 16 February 1977) was a Hungarian mathematician and logician. She is best known as the &quot;founding mother of recursion theory&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Péter was born in Budapest, Hungary, as Rózsa Politzer (Hungarian: Politzer Rózsa). She attended Pázmány Péter University (now Eötvös Loránd University), originally studying chemistry but later switching to mathematics. She attended lectures by Lipót Fejér and József Kürschák. While at university, she met László Kalmár; they would collaborate in future years and Kalmár encouraged her to pursue her love of mathematics.

After graduating in 1927, Péter could not find a permanent teaching position although she had passed her exams to qualify as a mathematics teacher. Due to the effects of the Great Depression, many university graduates could not find work and Péter began private tutoring. At this time, she also began her graduate studies.

==Professional career and research==
Initially, Péter began her graduate research on number theory. Upon discovering that her results had already been proven by the work of Robert Carmichael and L. E. Dickson, she abandoned mathematics to focus on poetry. However, she was convinced to return to mathematics by her friend László Kalmár, who suggested she research the work of Kurt Gödel on the theory of incompleteness. She prepared her own, different proofs to Gödel&#x27;s work.

Péter presented the results of her paper on recursive theory, &quot;, to the International Congress of Mathematicians in Zürich, Switzerland in 1932. In the summer of 1933, she worked with Paul Bernays in Göttingen, Germany, for the long chapter on recursive functions in the book that appeared in 1934 under the names of David Hilbert and Bernays. Her main results are summarised in the book and also appeared in several articles in the leading journal of mathematics, the , the first in 1934. Publication was under the name Politzer-Péter as she had changed her Jewish surname Politzer into Péter that same year. For her research, she received her PhD summa cum laude in 1935. In 1936, she presented a paper entitled &quot; to the International Congress of Mathematicians in Oslo. These papers helped to found the modern field of recursive function theory as a separate area of mathematical research.

In 1937, she was appointed as contributing editor of the &quot;Journal of Symbolic Logic&quot;.

After the passage of the Jewish Laws of 1939 in Hungary, Péter was forbidden to teach because of her Jewish origin and was briefly confined to a ghetto in Budapest. During World War II, she wrote her book &quot;Playing with Infinity: Mathematical Explorations and Excursions&quot;, a work for lay readers on the topics of number theory and logic. Originally published in Hungarian, it has been translated into English and at least a dozen other languages.

With the end of the war in 1945, Péter received her first full-time teaching appointment at the Budapest Teachers&#x27; Training College. In 1952, she was the first Hungarian woman to be made an Academic Doctor of Mathematics. After the College closed in 1955, she taught at Eötvös Loránd University until her retirement in 1975. She was a popular professor, known as &quot;Aunt Rózsa&quot; to her students.

In 1951, she published her key work &quot;Rekursive Funktionen&quot;, the first book on modern logic by a female author, later translated into English as &quot;Recursive Functions&quot;. She continued to publish important papers on recursive theory throughout her life. In 1959, she presented a major paper &quot;&quot; to the International Symposium in Warsaw (later published in two parts in 1961 and 1962).

Beginning in the mid-1950s, Péter applied recursive function theory to computers. Her final book, published in 1976, was (Recursive Functions in Computer Theory). Originally published in Hungarian, it was the second Hungarian mathematical book to be published in the Soviet Union because its subject matter was considered indispensable to the theory of computers. It was translated into English in 1981.

==Honors==
Péter was awarded the Kossuth Prize in 1951. She received the Manó Beke Prize by the János Bolyai Mathematical Society in 1953, the Silver State Prize in 1970, and the Gold State Prize in 1973. In 1973, she became the first woman to be elected to the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.

<doc id="1297288" wikidata="Q3734923" url="?curid=1297288" title="Harry Wendelstedt Umpire School">
<text>The Harry Wendelstedt Umpire School umpires for professional baseball is an independent umpire training program recognized by the minor leagues and major leagues. It is located in Ormond Beach, Florida. It runs for five weeks each early January through early February. The school is open to both men and women; the first woman ever to work a Major League Baseball (MLB) spring training game, Pam Postema, graduated from the school, as have a number of other female professional umpires. The school was previously known as the Bill McGowan School for Umpires and the Al Somers Umpire School.

==History==
Umpire Bill McGowan founded the program as the Bill McGowan School for Umpires in 1938. The school was run by former umpire Al Somers after McGowan&#x27;s death in the 1950s. Harry Wendelstedt was the chief instructor for the Somers school, acquiring the school in 1977, where it has stayed in family ownership, with son Hunter Wendelstedt in control since 2012.

== Facilities ==
The Wendelstedt Umpire School leases the Harry Wendelstedt Jr. baseball fields at the Ormond Beach Sports Complex. The school&#x27;s lease is good through 2027 after being renewed for a decade in 2017. Students stay in a hotel offsite, and must commute to the classroom and fields for coursework.

== Curriculum ==
While the Wendelstedt Umpire School is in session, students work six days a week, Monday through Saturday, usually starting at 9am. Students train in a classroom and on the fields. Training on most days begins in a classroom, where students learn from two instructors, one reading from the Official Baseball Rules while the other interprets the rules. Students take 25 tests, and to qualify for advancement, must score a 70% or better. All tests are mostly multiple choice and true/false, and are all based on the teachings of the rules.

Following training in the classroom, students walk to the fields. Students learn from instructors on how to apply the rules on the baseball diamond. They also learn proper umpire mechanics. Students work in batting cages, where they learn how to track pitches and effectively call balls and strikes. Students will also participate in simulated games where instructors control certain situations to help teach and evaluate the students.

==Staff==
The Wendelstedt Umpire School has produced more MLB umpires than all other schools in history combined. It has fourteen full-time MLB umpires and a number of minor league umpires on its staff. The current MLB umpires that have been instructors at the school include: Lance Barksdale, Gerry Davis, Dana DeMuth, Doug Eddings, Bruce Froemming, Greg Gibson, Brian Gorman, Ed Hickox, John Hirschbeck, Sam Holbrook, Ron Kulpa, Jerry Layne, Randy Marsh, Chuck Meriwether, Paul Nauert, Charlie Reliford, Larry Vanover, Tim Welke, and Hunter Wendelstedt.

<text>Sir Roger Alexander Deakins (born 24 May 1949) is an English cinematographer. He is the recipient of five BAFTA Awards for Best Cinematography, and two Academy Awards for Best Cinematography from sixteen nominations. He has collaborated multiple times with directors such as the Coen brothers, Sam Mendes, and Denis Villeneuve. His best-known works include &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; (1994), &quot;Fargo&quot; (1996), &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; (2000), &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; (2001), &quot;Skyfall&quot; (2012), &quot;Sicario&quot; (2015), &quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot; (2017), and &quot;1917&quot; (2019), the last two of which earned him Academy Awards. He is often regarded as one of the greatest and most influential western cinematographers.
An alumnus of the National Film and Television School, Deakins was named and serves as an Honorary Fellow of the school in recognition of his &quot;outstanding contribution[s] to ... British film&quot;. He is a member of the British Society of Cinematographers and the American Society of Cinematographers, and in 2011 received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the latter organization. Deakins was bestowed a CBE by the Palace for his services to film in 2013, and was knighted as a Knight Bachelor in the 2021 New Year Honours.

==Early life==
Deakins was born in Torquay in the English county of Devon. His father ran a construction company, while his mother was an actress and amateur painter. Deakins attended Torquay Boys&#x27; Grammar School. He took up painting from a young age, and subsequently enrolled in the Bath Academy of Art in Bath, Somerset, where he studied graphic design. While studying in Bath, Deakins developed a passion for photography; he cited the photographer Roger Mayne, a guest lecturer at the academy, as a major source of inspiration.

After college, Deakins applied to the newly opened National Film School, but was denied admission as his photography was considered not &quot;filmic&quot; enough. He spent the following year wandering the countryside, photographing rural life in North Devon, before finally being admitted to the National Film School in 1972. Director Michael Radford was one of Deakins&#x27;s schoolmates.

==Career==

===Early career===
After graduating, Deakins found work as a cameraman, assisting in the production of projects for about seven years. An early project of his involved filming a nine-month trip on a yacht as an entrant in the Whitbread Round the World Race, titled &quot;Around the World with Ridgeway&quot;. Deakins was hired to film two documentaries in Africa. His first, &quot;Zimbabwe&quot;, was a clandestine documentation of the Rhodesian Bush War, while his second, &quot;Eritrea – Behind Enemy Lines&quot;, depicted the Eritrean War of Independence. He also shot anthropological documentaries in India and Sudan.

During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Deakins was involved in a number of music-related projects, including &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot;, a music documentary about the British rockabilly scene, the concert film &quot;Van Morrison in Ireland&quot;, and the Ray Davies musical film &quot;Return to Waterloo&quot;. He also made short music videos for Herbie Hancock, Eric Clapton, Marvin Gaye, Tracey Ullman, Madness, Level 42 and Meat Loaf.

===Feature films===

Deakins&#x27;s first dramatic project was a miniseries titled &quot;Wolcott&quot;, about a black detective working in the East End of London. The camerawork of the miniseries impressed his former schoolmate and frequent collaborator Michael Radford, who enlisted Deakins for their first dramatic feature, the 1983 film &quot;Another Time, Another Place&quot;. The film screened at the Cannes Film Festival and was well-received; subsequently, Deakins and Radford teamed up again on &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; (1984), based upon George Orwell&#x27;s novel of the same name. The film was praised for its bold, unusual palette, which Deakins achieved through a process known as bleach bypass, where the silver is retained in the print, creating a washed-out look that reflected Orwell&#x27;s bleak vision. Deakins was the first Western cinematographer to use the technique, which has since become highly influential and can be seen in films such as &quot;Seven&quot; (1995) and &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; (1998). Throughout the 1980s, Deakins continued working in Britain, serving as cinematographer for films including &quot;Defence of the Realm&quot; (1986), &quot;Sid and Nancy&quot; (1986), &quot;White Mischief&quot; (1987; his third feature film with Radford), &quot;Stormy Monday&quot; (1988) and &quot;Pascali&#x27;s Island&quot; (1988).

In 1991, Deakins began his long-term collaboration with the Coen brothers, starting with the film &quot;Barton Fink&quot;. The Coens had been impressed with Deakins&#x27;s work, and reached out to him after their previous collaborator Barry Sonnenfeld left to pursue a career in directing. The film won the Coens&#x27; the Festival de Cannes 1991 Palme d&#x27;Or and Best Director awards (and John Turturro the award for Best Actor), and earned Deakins best cinematography awards from New York, Chicago and Los Angeles film critics circles. In 1994, the year Deakins was admitted to the American Society of Cinematographers, he served as cinematographer for &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;, which earned him his first Academy Award nomination for Best Cinematography, and his first American Society of Cinematographers Award. He received two further Academy Award nominations in that decade, for &quot;Fargo&quot; (1996) and &quot;Kundun&quot; (1997).

For the Coen brothers film &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; (2000), Deakins spent some two months fine-tuning the look, turning the lush green Mississippi landscape into a burnt, autumnal yellow and desaturating the overall image. This feat made &quot;O Brother&quot; the first ever feature film to be digitally color-corrected in its entirety, and earned Deakins his fourth Academy Award nomination. The following year, for his work in the Coen brothers&#x27; &quot;The Man Who Wasn&#x27;t There&quot; (2001), Deakins received his fifth Oscar nomination and won his first BAFTA Award for Best Cinematography.

In 2008, Deakins received dual Oscar nominations—his sixth and seventh—for &quot;The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford&quot; (2007) and &quot;No Country for Old Men&quot; (2007). He was the first cinematographer to achieve such a feat since Robert Surtees, who was nominated for &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot; and &quot;Summer of &#x27;42&quot; in 1972. Deakins served as director of photography for Stephen Daldry&#x27;s &quot;The Reader&quot; (2008) but left mid-production due to delays and previous commitments, and was replaced by Chris Menges. The two cinematographers received a shared nomination for Best Cinematography at the 81st Academy Awards.
Deakins worked with the Coens on the 2010 western &quot;True Grit&quot;—their eleventh collaboration—for which he received his ninth Oscar nomination. Deakins signed on as cinematographer for &quot;Skyfall&quot; (2012), having previously worked with director Sam Mendes on &quot;Jarhead&quot; (2005) and &quot;Revolutionary Road&quot; (2008). For his work, Deakins received another Academy Award nomination for Best Cinematography, eventually losing to Claudio Miranda of &quot;Life of Pi&quot;—his 10th nomination without securing a win. In addition to his live-action work, Deakins served as both cinematographer and visual consultant on the 2011 animated film &quot;Rango&quot; (2011), and also served as a visual consultant on animated features, including &quot;WALL-E&quot; (2008), &quot;Puss in Boots&quot; (2011), &quot;Rise of the Guardians&quot; (2012), &quot;The Croods&quot; (2013), the &quot;How to Train Your Dragon&quot; trilogy (2010, 2014 and 2019). and &quot;Vivo&quot; (2021).

Starting with &quot;Prisoners&quot; (2013), Deakins began working with director Denis Villeneuve. The two proceeded to collaborate on &quot;Sicario&quot; (2015) and &quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot; (2017), with Deakins earning Oscar nominations for all three films. For his work on &quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot;, Deakins received his first Academy Award for Best Cinematography on his 14th nomination. Deakins reunited with Sam Mendes on the 2019 war film &quot;1917&quot;, filmed and edited to appear as one uninterrupted take, for which he received his second Academy Award on his 15th nomination.

==Personal life==
Deakins married Isabella James Purefoy Ellis (b. January 1954, professionally known as James Ellis Deakins and often referred to simply as James) on 11 December 1991. They had met in 1991 in Los Angeles on the set of David Mamet&#x27;s &quot;Homicide&quot;, where she was working as the script supervisor. The two began dating after the &quot;Homicide&quot; production finished and were married within about six months. Since then, James Ellis has &quot;ovesee[n] the digital workflow of... film[s]&quot;, and they have worked together on various projects, including &quot;The Goldfinch&quot; and &quot;1917&quot;. As of February 2020, they reside in Kingswear, Devon, and Santa Monica, California.

Deakins has kept a boat since beginning such activities with his father as a child—with him, first a sailboat, then a motorboat—and he currently keeps one in Torquay, his hometown, to which he often goes (and from which he fishes) when in Britain. 

When in Devon he enjoys running, and has maintained a passion for still photography. In 2021, Deakins released a book of his black-and-white still photographs, &quot;Byways&quot;.

Since 2005, Deakins has maintained a website through which he frequently communicates with admirers and other industry practitioners. His correspondence includes answering fan questions and offering cinematography tips. Since April 2020 he and his wife have hosted the &quot;Team Deakins&quot; podcast, whose guests have included Sam Mendes, John Crowley, and Denis Villeneuve.

==Critical reception==
Deakins is often cited as one of the greatest and most influential cinematographers of all time. His consistent output led fellow cinematographer Robert Elswit to jokingly suggest that the American Society of Cinematographers should establish a special award for &quot;films shot by Roger Deakins.&quot; Deakins received 13 Academy Awards nominations without a win, a fact often lamented by journalists and film critics. His first Oscar win (on his 14th nomination) for &quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot; at the 90th Academy Awards was widely reported and met with great enthusiasm.

Deakins is among the most respected and sought-after cinematographers in the film business. His involvement in a film could secure the casting of established stars—a distinction usually reserved for auteur directors. He was hired to shoot &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; at the insistence of Tim Robbins, who had previously worked with him on the Coen brothers film &quot;The Hudsucker Proxy&quot;. Josh Brolin agreed to join the cast of &quot;Sicario&quot; only after hearing of Deakins&#x27;s involvement. When Ryan Gosling accepted his role in &quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot;, he cited the involvement of Deakins as a factor for his decision.

==Awards and recognition==

He has been nominated for sixteen Academy Awards, winning the Academy Award for Best Cinematography twice—on his fourteenth and fifteenth nominations—for &quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot; (2017) and &quot;1917&quot; (2019). He has been named as an Honorary Fellow of his alma mater, the National Film and Television School in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, an honour which recognises &quot;outstanding contribution to the British film and television industry&quot; On 28 February 2020.

Deakins is the recipient of five BAFTA Awards for Best Cinematography, for &quot;The Man Who Wasn&#x27;t There&quot; (2001), &quot;No Country for Old Men&quot; (2007), &quot;True Grit&quot; (2010), &quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot; (2017), &quot;1917&quot; (2019), each in the year following their release. As well, two films that he shot, &quot;Fargo&quot; (1996), and &quot;A Serious Man&quot; (2009), won Independent Spirit Awards for Best Cinematography in the year after their release.

He received the Royal Photographic Society&#x27;s Lumière Award for major achievement in cinematography, video or animation in 2009.
The National Board of Review, a group of New York-based reviewers whose organization dates to 1909, honoured Deakins in 2007 with its award for Career Achievement in Cinematography. Deakins went on to receive the American Society of Cinematographers and the British Society of Cinematographers Lifetime Achievement Award in 2011 and 2015 respectively.

Deakins was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2013 Birthday Honours for services to film. He was knighted in the 2021 New Year Honours, also for services to film.

<doc id="1297300" wikidata="Q2358195" url="?curid=1297300" title="Studebaker Land Cruiser">
<text>The Studebaker Land Cruiser is an automobile that was produced by the Studebaker Corporation of South Bend, Indiana (United States) from 1934–1954. The Land Cruiser debuted at the World&#x27;s Fair alongside the Silver Arrow, a product of Studebaker&#x27;s former premium make Pierce-Arrow. It was also manufactured in Vernon, California.

==1933–1942==

The Land Cruiser was introduced at the 1933 Chicago World&#x27;s Fair as an extensively streamlined sedan. Many of the same aerodynamic features of the car were shared with Pierce-Arrow&#x27;s Silver Arrow show car that also debuted at the fair when Studebaker assumed operations of Pierce-Arrow in 1928. Work on both automobiles was authorized prior to the company being placed in receivership in March 1933, and Pierce being sold to investors.

Production Land Cruisers began to appear in dealer showrooms in the fall of 1933 as 1934 models. The Land Cruiser was designated as a body style, and classified in the President model range (C Series) for the year. It retailed for $1,510.

The body style was shared with the President and Commander series for 1936. From 1937–1940, the car was classified as the Commander Cruiser and President Cruiser. The Land Cruiser name officially returned in 1941 and 1942. In addition to offering its Land Cruisers in the Commander and President lines, for 1941 Studebaker introduced the ultra-luxurious Skyway Land Cruiser which featured a slightly curved single-pane windshield, rear fender skirts and premium details and fabrics.
==1947–1952 models==
The 1947 Studebaker models were so revolutionary that it had other car builders scurrying back to their drawing boards. While other manufacturers settled for re-chroming their pre-war models, the 1947 Studebaker, touted as &quot;First by Far with a Postwar Car&quot;, had a completely new body. The new Land Cruiser exclusively rode the company&#x27;s longest wheelbase (), which provided additional legroom for rear seat passengers. It featured center-opening, rear-hinged rear suicide doors and was powered by the larger of Studebaker&#x27;s two straight-6 engines. The Land Cruiser suggested price of $2043 included a one-piece curved windshield, an electric clock and carpeting front and rear. Only minor trim changes for 1948 brought a Land Cruiser price of $2265, and in 1949 it was increased to $2328 ($ in dollars ).

Since it was a seller’s market after WWII, Studebaker felt no need to change the basic design of the car, even though they knew that other makers would have “new” cars in 1949. Studebaker coasted along with the old bodies until 1952.

But 1950 saw the “Next Look in Cars&quot; — Studebaker’s answer to the other manufacturer&#x27;s 1949 models. Considered very radical for the era, it had three-point front styling, popularly known as the “bullet-nose”, similar in style to the 1949 Ford. Over 10,000 more Land Cruisers were sold in 1950 than in 1949. Studebaker Automatic Drive was introduced mid-year and was arguably the most advanced automatic transmission of the day. It featured reverse gear lock-out, hill-holder, anti-creep and a locking torque converter which allowed direct drive with virtually no converter power loss in high gear. The price of the 1950 Land Cruiser went down to $2187.

Sales in 1951 skyrocketed, an increase of almost 12,000 over 1950. This can probably be attributed to the introduction of the lively new Studebaker V8 engine that year. The front styling stayed virtually the same, with a minor redesign of the three points. Once again, the Land Cruiser had its own wheelbase, at 119&quot;; the Commander now shared the 115&quot; wheelbase of the Champion models. The price was raised to $2289.

The 1952 Land Cruiser was the last to use real glass for the tail and parking light lenses. Its grille, designated by some as the &quot;clam digger&quot;, was actually a preview of the next generation.

==1953–1954 models==

The 1953 Land Cruisers were complete departure from the ’47-’52 models. The 1953 model sold retail for $2316 ($ in dollars ). They were built on the same frame as the new Starliner and Starlight coupe models but, as with many new models, there were some initial problems, primarily with the fit of the front fenders. With the engine out of the car, they fit. With the engine in the car, they didn’t. This was found to be primarily the fault of using a thinner gauge steel for the frame. The theory was that if the frame could flex a little, the car would ride better. The problem was, it flexed too much. If you jacked up one corner of the car, to change a tire, for example, the frame flexed so much that you could either not open the door or could not close it. There were also fewer frame re-enforcements than in subsequent years. As you might imagine, this problem caused many a late night conference and hasty fixes and tended to give the new model a bad name almost immediately.

Then a problem with the new (and revolutionary, for its day) mechanical power steering raised its head. It only required of pressure to turn the steering wheel but it was noisy. Only 100 of these units were sold before Studebaker began using GM Saginaw type units.

The Studebaker company had a problem with the Mercedes-Benz company. A few years in the future, Studebaker would be the American distributor for that brand, but in 1953, the M-B tri-star emblem was turned upside down and put on the front and rear of Studebaker cars, minus the encircling ring. (Mercedes-Benz cars were still relatively unknown in America at that time, so most people probably would never have drawn any connection between the two brands.) In the upper part, the Commander had a gold “8” while the Champion a gold “S”. The upside-down tri-star was used elsewhere in the car. The wheel covers, back-up light lenses, radio delete plate, horn button and the rear ashtray on the Starliner/Starlight coupe—all had this emblem. M-B complained and Studebaker hastily re-designed the emblems. On the hood and trunk, they removed the M-B look-alike and on the Commander, replaced it with a large gold “8” in the middle of a chrome “V” (basically they removed one of the three arms of the &quot;star&quot;, changing it into a &quot;v&quot;.) On the Champion, a gold “S” replaced the “8”. When the other items ran their course, they were replaced by non-tri-star items. These are now collectors items.

The construction problems were corrected in the 1954 Land Cruiser models with heavier metal in the frames and an additional re-enforcing crossmember. The famous designer, Eleanor LeMaire was retained to brighten up the interiors of the new cars. She demanded 4 more colorful interiors than previously, getting away from the one drab gray pin stripe color of the previous year. These new colors included green, blue and tan as well as an opulent silver-gray. The front grille bars had 5 small vertical fins each to differentiate them from the earlier model. New, larger brakes were included in the package, shortening stopping distances by according to Motor Trend. Engine horsepower increased to 127 as the result of a 0.5 compression increase (to 7.5).

There was also a smoother looking instrument panel, doing away with the individually hooded gauges of the previous year. The 1954 Land Cruiser sold for $2438.

All in all, many people are of the opinion that the 1954 Land Cruiser was better designed than the 1955 Ultra-Vista wrap around windshield President models. While it was in keeping with most other brands of the era, the large amount of chrome (demanded by the sales department) caused many people to shy away from the ’55 Studebakers. In 1955, the name was changed.

==Follow-ups and legacy==

Top-trimmed Studebakers from 1955–1958 went by the Studebaker President name (revived from the prewar President models). For 1956, an upscale President Classic sedan was offered. The President Classic used the longer 120.5&quot; wheelbase of the Hawks, and like the 1947–1950 Land Cruisers used the additional length to create a roomier rear passenger area. The President Classic was continued for 1957–1958, though no longer carrying the &quot;Classic&quot; model name. After a four-year run, The President models, in turn, were dropped at the end of 1958 to make way for the new compact Lark model. A longer wheelbase version of the Lark sedan was offered for fleet sales. Dubbed the Economiler, it was marketed for use as a taxicab, again featuring a roomier back seat area than the regular Larks.

For the 1961, Studebaker added a Lark model, the Cruiser, which continued through the 1966 model year. This model was built on the longer wheelbase chassis and was a better equipped and more luxurious version of the 4-door Lark and was designed to harken back to the Studebaker Land Cruiser sedans of the late Forties and early Fifties.

<text>Cascade is an urban neighborhood abutting Downtown Seattle, Washington, United States, located adjacent to South Lake Union. It is bounded by: Fairview Avenue North on the west, beyond which is the rest of the Cascade Neighborhood; the Interstate 5 interchange for Mercer St to the north, beyond which is Eastlake; Interstate 5 on the east, beyond which is Capitol Hill; and Denny Way on the south, beyond which is Denny Triangle. It is surrounded by thoroughfares Mercer Street (eastbound), Fairview Avenue N. and Eastlake Avenue E. (north- and southbound), and Denny Way (east- and westbound). The neighborhood, one of Seattle&#x27;s oldest, originally extended much further: west to Terry Avenue, south to Denny Hill (regraded away 1929–1931) on the South, and east to Melrose Avenue E through the area now obliterated by Interstate 5. Some recent writers consider Cascade to omit the northern &quot;arm&quot; (east of Lake Union), while others extend it westward to cover most of South Lake Union.

Historic structures in Cascade Neighborhood include St Spiridon&#x27;s Orthodox Cathedral, Immanuel Lutheran Church, and several defunct laundry blocks. In 2007, a development named Alley24 was built around the New Richmond Laundry Building, a City of Seattle Landmark located between John and Thomas Streets and Yale and Pontius Avenues North. The historic façade was maintained in the new design by architecture firm NBBJ, who also relocated their headquarters to Alley24. The property is jointly owned by PEMCO and Paul Allen&#x27;s development company Vulcan Inc. Vulcan owns roughly approximately 6 acres in Cascade Neighborhood, a lower percentage of the land than in the rest of South Lake Union.

== History ==


Cascade grew up in the late 19th and early 20th century as a blue-collar neighborhood with a mixture of housing and one of the city&#x27;s first industrial areas. It was the original home of St. Demetrios Greek Orthodox Church (built 1919–1921; congregation moved 1963; demolished 1995), and remains the home of St. Spiridon Russian Orthodox Cathedral (established 1895, present church completed 1938) and Immanuel Lutheran Church (established 1890, present church completed 1912).

=== Pioneers ===
Like most of Seattle, the Cascade Neighborhood was originally heavily forested. In the 1860s, David Denny and Thomas Mercer first claimed portions of this land. However, initial development was a bit west of Cascade, at southwest Lake Union, which became a transportation nexus and where Denny established the lake&#x27;s first sawmill. By the 1880s, more mills and more cleared land led to the origin of Cascade as a residential and industrial neighborhood, tied into water transportation.

Another notable pioneer was Margaret Pontius, known for her extensive work as what would now be called a foster parent. She and her husband, Rezius Pontius, lived in the neighborhood by 1885, and by 1889 had built a Queen Anne style mansion, designed by John Parkinson, along Denny Way near what is now Yale Avenue.

Cascade was settled largely by Russians (some via Alaska), Swedes, Norwegians, and Greeks. In 1894, the Cascade School (also designed by Parkinson) opened and the neighborhood acquired a name. As the neighborhood grew, the school expanded in 1904 and 1908. Cascade businesses in this era included sawmills, shingle mills, and boat yards along the lake, as well as cabinetry and furniture shops, grocery stores, laundries, and boarding houses.

Both landscape architect John C. Olmsted (in 1903) and city planner Virgil Bogue (in 1910–1911) believed that the neighborhood was best suited for industrial use, although Olmsted unsuccessfully proposed that there also be a small park on the lake. Denny Regrade No. 1 (completed 1911) took out nearly half of Denny Hill, making Cascade more accessible from downtown Seattle. The Ford plant, designed by John Graham Sr. and built in 1914, was the Ford Motor Company&#x27;s first factory built west of the Mississippi River. When the Lake Washington Ship Canal opened in 1917, maritime and industrial uses intensified. The area also became the center for the city&#x27;s large laundries, as well as smaller machine shops. Cascade-area laundries played a crucial role in Seattle labor history, with a successful fight for the 8-hour day in the years 1917 through 1918.

=== Great Depression ===
When the Great Depression coincided with the decline of the extractive economy in Greater Seattle, Cascade began to decline both economically and in terms of population, with its most stable remaining industries being shipbuilding and other marine activities. Howard Wright General Contractors were operating out of 409 Yale Avenue N, where they are still located as of 2008. There was also a business district between the 300 and 600 blocks of Eastlake, mainly on the west side of the street, including grocery stores, a pharmacy, a meat shop, automobile repair, furniture repair, a cabinetmaker, a beauty parlor, a barbershop, several drinking establishments, and a dye works. Although no buildings remain on the east side of the street, which abuts Interstate 5, many of these west-side buildings survive. However, with the freeway cutting it off from Capitol Hill, this is much less of a business district today.

=== Postwar period ===
The decline of the depression years was briefly arrested by World War II, as the U.S. Navy built a reserve center on the site of David Denny&#x27;s former mill, just west of Cascade and Kenworth expanded a factory on Mercer Street. Decline resumed after the war, and was greatly exacerbated when the April 13, 1949 earthquake caused structural damage to the Cascade School. Controversy ensued over whether or not to repair the school, but it was ultimately demolished since local businesses led by the Seattle Times desired an increasingly industrial rather than residential character neighborhood. The school was replaced by a warehouse for the school district, while its playground remained as a public park.

The year 1949 also saw the first seeds of the &quot;new&quot; Cascade Neighborhood that would emerge almost half a century later: the Washington Teachers Credit Union was established, with quarters on Eastlake Avenue. It would become the Washington School Employees Credit Union (1963), and eventually part of PEMCO Financial Services, still based in the Cascade Neighborhood as of 2008.

New zoning ordinances based on the 1956 Comprehensive Plan of Seattle forbade any new residential uses in Cascade Neighborhood. The plan also recommended two new freeways through the area. On the northern edge, the Bay Freeway would cover roughly nine city blocks between Mercer and Valley Streets, with ramps connecting to the Aurora Freeway which had been constructed in 1932. The city lacked funding for the project and plans were eventually scrapped along with the R.H. Thomson Expressway. The second freeway was Interstate 5, which was constructed in 1962. More than seven blocks of residences and retail businesses on the east side of Eastlake were razed to make way for Interstate 5. The freeway cut Cascade off entirely from neighboring Capitol Hill. Previously they had been tied together by multiple streets and stairways. (The upper half-block of the E. Republican Street Stairway or Republican Hill Climb east of Melrose Ave E. remains east of the freeway, and has status as a city landmark; it once extended two blocks farther, down to Eastlake Ave E.) Currently, the only remaining direct route between the two is Denny Way at the south border of the neighborhood.

=== 1960s ===
The Seattle Times Building had been built in 1930 just west of Fairview Avenue.&quot;The Seattle Times&quot;; in the 1960s, the &quot;Times&quot; purchased and razed acres of homes near its headquarters for parking lots and future development opportunities. (One building they purchased was, for a time, operated as the Seattle Concert Theater, but even that was &quot;hastily razed&quot; in the early 1980s to &quot;head off a landmarks designation&quot;.) Karin Link remarks: &quot;The relationship between the &quot;Seattle Times&quot; and the Cascade Neighborhood is still considered problematic.&quot;

In the 1960s, the University of Washington&#x27;s College of Architecture and Urban Planning described the area as &quot;blighted&quot;. The 1969 Bay Freeway plan for a proposed elevated freeway to connect Interstate 5 with Seattle Center would have cut off the neighborhood from the Lake, but was voted down in 1972. Cascade struggled on as a blue-collar residential and light industrial neighborhood.

=== 1970s ===
In the early 1970s, activists including a University of Washington student named Frank Chopp began the Cascade Shelter Project, setting up geodesic domes on vacant lots to live in. A 1975 report by Folke Nyberg and Victor Steinbrueck included Cascade as a historic residential section of Seattle, and in 1977 the Housing In Cascade study by Paul Schell, then Director of Seattle Department of Community Development, recommended a &quot;Special Review District&quot; in Cascade. However, the city council took no action on the proposal.

=== 1980s ===
As the local economy strengthened in the late 1980s, Cascade&#x27;s cheap land and central location began to attract new uses. The northwest corner of the neighborhood became the campus of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and at the north tip of Cascade, the old City Light Steam Plant (a decommissioned electrical generation facility) became the headquarters of Zymogenetics. Gentrification had begun. Although a proposal to transform a north–south corridor just west of Cascade into a park was twice defeated by the voters (in 1995 and in 1996), gentrification continued apace, largely driven by tech billionaire and developer Paul Allen&#x27;s Vulcan Northwest group.

=== 1990s ===
Two large changes in the south part of Cascade in the 1990s were the demolition of the old St. Demetrios Church (along with the Overall Laundry) to build the new REI flagship store, and the demolition of the 1907 wood-frame Lillian Apartments by Vulcan Northwest. The demolition was opposed by low-income housing advocates.

== Notable residents ==
Teamsters labor leader Dave Beck grew up in and around Cascade Neighborhood, attended the Cascade School, and delivered newspapers there. He followed his mother into laundry work, which brought him into labor organizing.
Among the notable residents of Cascade were cubist artist Nicolai Kuvshinoff and his wife Bertha Horne Kuvshinoff, who dubbed her ghostly style of painting &quot;phantasism&quot;. Both are represented in the permanent collection of the Seattle Art Museum. Kuvshinoff arrived in Cascade from Russia in 1915. His father, the Rev. Vasily Kuvshinoff, brought with him icons and relics given to him by the Romanovs, which he bequeathed to St. Spiridon Orthodox Cathedral, where he officiated. Nicolai Kuvshinoff appears to have painted religious murals in the Cathedral. From 1955 to 1960 Kuvshinoff and his wife lived and worked in Paris, but they returned to Cascade, where they remained until Nicolai&#x27;s death in 1997 (Bertha lived two years longer). During most of their time in Cascade, they lived in the former Rodgers Tile Company building at 117-121 Yale Ave. N, later the 911 Contemporary Arts Center and now the Feathered Friends outdoor equipment shop.

== Cascade Playground ==
The Cascade Playground (now also known as Cascade Park), originally the playground of the now-demolished Cascade School, has two play areas, a wide field, a picnic table, and restrooms. The park is adjacent to an active community P-Patch (allotment garden). Improvements to the Cascade Playground play areas, field, and entrance were unveiled in spring 2005, financed by the Pro Parks Levy. Sharing a city block with the playground and P-Patch is the Cascade People&#x27;s Center, a volunteer organization that partners with over 100 businesses, churches, organizations, and community groups to address advocacy for social and economic justice.

By 1931, although most of this block had come to be owned by the City of Seattle or the School Board, a number of houses remained owned by individuals. By the end of 1931, however, the owners of these houses had sold out and the buildings were removed (although some basements may still be intact under the park surface). There was debate in the neighborhood over building the playground; in 1934, the pro-playground group eventually prevailed. Still, as late as 1937, the Fairview-Stewart Improvement Club was protested that the Cascade School was old and out of date, itself not worth preserving, and that the increasingly industrial and commercial neighborhood did not need a playfield.

Between 1934 and 1939, WPA workers built a retaining wall (only part of which survive), the rest rooms at the northeast corner of the park, and a wading pool (which originally was part of a Japanese stone garden).

By the 1970s, according to the Seattle Department of Neighborhoods, &quot;the playground site was somewhat bleak and known by locals as the &#x27;Sahara Desert&#x27;&quot;. A 1971 renovation included a mural on the retaining wall, funded by the Seattle Arts Commission and designed by Mike Love and George Shayler. This was followed by another round of improvements in 2005.

== Landmarks and historic sites ==
&quot;See also the listing of Landmarks and historic sites in the South Lake Union neighborhood&quot;, most of which fall within what are considered by some to be the borders of the Cascade neighborhood.

In addition, the surviving portion of the East Republican Street Stairway that once connected Cascade to Capitol Hill is a designated Seattle landmark. However, the portion of it that remains is separated from Cascade by Interstate 5.

<doc id="1297315" wikidata="Q1507784" url="?curid=1297315" title="Studebaker Commander">
<text>The Studebaker Commander is the model name of several automobiles produced by the Studebaker Corporation of South Bend, Indiana (United States) and Studebaker of Canada Ltd of Walkerville and, later, Hamilton, Ontario (Canada). Studebaker began using the Commander name in 1927 and, with interruptions in 1936 and 1959-63, continued to use it until 1964. The name was applied to various products in the company&#x27;s line-up from year to year. The Commander was the company&#x27;s mainstream product, the Studebaker Champion was the junior model, and other models were short lived or renamed as market conditions required.

==History==

===1920s===
Until the appearance of the inline eight President in January 1928, all Studebaker cars of the 1920s were inline sixes. There were three basic models — the Light Six, the Special Six and the Big Six, developing , , and respectively at 2000 rpm. The first Commander, in 1927, was a continuation of the mid-range Special Six, with a engine. Their inbuilt durability and toughness gained them great renown under worldwide conditions. The 1928 GB Commander was a descendant of the Big Six, being powered with the proven engine, modified to deliver at 2400 rpm. In October 1928, three Commander sixes lined up at the Atlantic City Speedway to challenge the speed record () held by the much higher-priced Auburn straight-eight Speedster.&quot;They not only accomplished that but then went on to establish new records up to . The two sports roadsters averaged better than and the sedan, which had flipped on the icy boards during one of the night runs and had been hurriedly repaired, averaged almost 62 mph.&quot; After this, the three cars were closely scrutinised, part by part, and it was established that they were strictly stock automobiles, identical in every respect to those available at any Studebaker showroom.

In Australia, a crew of three drivers led by Norman &quot;Wizard&quot; Smith tackled overland records using a Commander roadster. On a 3,000-mile run from Fremantle to Sydney, they smashed the previous record by 12 hours 23 minutes despite traversing 450 miles through blinding rain, and having to ford a river when a bridge had been washed away. The team rested for a little over three hours before attempting another record on the 600-mile track to Brisbane.

These sixes were the last descendants of rugged cars designed for poor roads in the early 20th century—loaded with torque and strong in construction. They were less well suited to the higher cruising speeds made possible by better roads in later years.

In 1929, Studebaker added an 8-cylinder Commander to the range.

===1930s===
In 1935, the Commander was dropped from Studebaker’s product line, only to be reinstated in 1937 when the name was applied to Studebaker’s least expensive model, formerly known as the Studebaker Dictator. Studebaker introduced the Champion in 1939, and the Commander line was again repositioned, now as the mid-range vehicle.

===1940s===

Immediately following World War II, Studebaker dropped its President models, and the Commander again was elevated in the lineup. Studebaker also again rolled out an extended wheelbase model of the Commander, the Land Cruiser.
Raymond Loewy&#x27;s highly distinctive shape for the 1947 Commander and Champion, spectacular on their Starlight coupe, led if it did not create a boom in America&#x27;s trunk space.
===1950s===
The 1950 Champion differed from the Commander, which had a distinctive bumper, carried over from 1949, longer front fenders and large headlight bezels, as well as a distinctive jet-style hood ornament and shared an appearance with the 1949 Ford Sedan. In 1953, the polarizing appearance was updated and shares some appearance features with the Citroen DS that appeared in 1955.

In a 1953 road test done by Popular Mechanics, the Commander got a 0-60 mph of 17.9 seconds and was rated as getting 26.1 mpg at 30 mph.

No convertible was offered in 1953. However, in late 1952 Studebaker produced one prototype of a 1953 Commander convertible to determine if the model could be profitably mass-produced. The car was based on the 1953 2-door Starliner hardtop. The car was later modified to 1954-model specifications, and was occasionally driven around South Bend by engineers. Additional structural reinforcements were needed to reduce body flexure. Even though the car was equipped with the 232 cu. in. V-8, the added structural weight increased the car&#x27;s 0-60 mph acceleration time to an unacceptable level. In addition, the company did not have the financial resources to add another body type to the model line. 

The company&#x27;s leadership mistakenly thought the 2-door sedans, 4-door sedans, and 1954 Conestoga wagon would sell better than the 2-door coupes, so the company&#x27;s resources were focused on production of the sedans and the wagon. When the prototype convertible was no longer needed, engineer E. T. Reynolds ordered the car to be stripped and the body sent to the secret graveyard at the company&#x27;s proving grounds west of South Bend. A non-engineering employee requested permission to purchase the complete car, rather than see it rot away at the proving grounds with other, earlier prototypes of other cars and trucks. Chief engineer Gene Hardig discussed the request with E. T. Reynolds. They agreed to let the employee purchase the car on the condition that the employee never sell it. In the 1970s, the car was re-discovered behind a South Bend gas station and no longer owned by the former employee. After eventually passing through several owners, the car is now in a private collection of Studebaker automobiles.

In 1955, Studebaker reintroduced the President name for its premium models and &#x27;Commander&#x27; was applied to the mid-range products. The Commander line was extended with the introduction of a lower-priced Custom sub-series, being basically a Champion with a V8 engine. Studebaker placed the name on hiatus at the end of the 1958 model year.

===1960s===
In 1963, Studebaker again resurrected the Commander name for the 1964 model year, applying it to the next-to-lowest-priced Lark model, the Challenger being below. 1964 Studebaker Commanders most commonly had a dual headlight arrangement which they shared with the Challenger though quad headlamps were optional. The 1965 Commander shared the quad-headlight system of the Daytona and Cruiser. Commanders reverted to single headlamps in the final model year of 1966. On March 17, 1966, Studebaker shut down production of all vehicles.

<doc id="1297317" wikidata="Q7045226" url="?curid=1297317" title="No free lunch theorem">
<text>In mathematical folklore, the &quot;no free lunch&quot; (NFL) theorem (sometimes pluralized) of David Wolpert and William Macready, alludes to the saying &quot;no such thing as a free lunch&quot;, that is, there are no easy shortcuts to success. It appeared in the 1997 &quot;No Free Lunch Theorems for Optimization&quot;. Wolpert had previously derived no free lunch theorems for machine learning (statistical inference). 

In 2005, Wolpert and Macready themselves indicated that the first theorem in their paper &quot;state[s] that any two optimization algorithms are equivalent when their performance is averaged across all possible problems&quot;.

The &quot;no free lunch&quot; (NFL) theorem is an easily stated and easily understood consequence of theorems Wolpert and Macready actually prove. It is objectively weaker than the proven theorems, and thus does not encapsulate them. Various investigators have extended the work of Wolpert and Macready substantively. In terms of how the NFL theorem is used in the context of the research area, the no free lunch in search and optimization is a field that is dedicated for purposes of mathematically analyzing data for statistical identity, particularly search and optimization.

While some scholars argue that NFL conveys important insight, others argue that NFL is of little relevance to machine learning research.

==Example==
Posit a toy universe that exists for exactly two days and on each day contains exactly one object: a square or a triangle. The universe has exactly four possible histories:
# (square, triangle): the universe contains a square on day 1, and a triangle on day 2
# (square, square)
# (triangle, triangle)
# (triangle, square)

Any prediction strategy that succeeds for history #2, by predicting a square on day 2 if there is a square on day 1, will fail on history #1, and vice versa. If all histories are equally likely, then any prediction strategy will score the same, with the same accuracy rate of 0.5.

==Origin==
Wolpert and Macready give two NFL theorems that are closely related to the folkloric theorem. In their paper, they state:

The first theorem hypothesizes objective functions that do not change while optimization is in progress, and the second hypothesizes objective functions that may change.

The theorem can be equivalently formulated as follows:

Here, &quot;blind search&quot; means that at each step of the algorithm, the element formula_1 is chosen at random with uniform probability distribution from the elements of formula_2 that have not been chosen previously.

In essence, this says that when all functions &quot;f&quot; are equally likely, the probability of observing an arbitrary sequence of &quot;m&quot; values in the course of optimization does not depend upon the algorithm. In the analytic framework of Wolpert and Macready, performance is a function of the sequence of observed values (and not e.g. of wall-clock time), so it follows easily that all algorithms have identically distributed performance when objective functions are drawn uniformly at random, and also that all algorithms have identical mean performance. But identical mean performance of all algorithms does not imply Theorem 1, and thus the folkloric theorem is not equivalent to the original theorem.

Theorem 2 establishes a similar, but &quot;more subtle&quot;, NFL result for time-varying objective functions.

==Motivation==
The NFL theorems were explicitly &quot;not&quot; motivated by the question of what can be inferred (in the case of NFL for machine learning) or found (in the case of NFL for search) when the &quot;environment is uniform random&quot;. Rather uniform randomness was used as a tool, to compare the number of environments for which algorithm A outperforms algorithm B to the number of environments for which B outperforms A. NFL tells us that (appropriately weighted) there are just as many environments in both of those sets.

This is true for many definitions of what precisely an &quot;environment&quot; is. In particular, there are just as many prior distributions (appropriately weighted) in which learning algorithm A beats B (on average) as vice versa. This statement about &quot;sets of priors&quot; is what is most important about NFL, not the fact that any two algorithms perform equally for the single, specific prior distribution that assigns equal probability to all environments.

While the NFL is important to understand the fundamental limitation for a set of problems, it does not state anything about each particular instance of a problem that can arise in practice. That is, the NFL states what is contained in its mathematical statements and it is nothing more than that. For example, it applies to the situations where the algorithm is fixed a priori and a worst-case problem for the fixed algorithm is chosen a posteriori. Therefore, if we have a &quot;good&quot; problem in practice or if we can choose a &quot;good&quot; learning algorithm for a given particular problem instance, then the NFL does not mention any limitation about this particular problem instance. Though the NFL might seem contradictory to results from other papers suggesting generalization of learning algorithms or search heuristics, it is important to understand the difference between the exact mathematical logic of the NFL and its intuitive interpretation.

==Implications==

To illustrate one of the counter-intuitive implications of NFL, suppose we fix two supervised learning algorithms, C and D. We then sample a target function f to produce a set of input-output pairs, &quot;d&quot;. The question is how should we choose whether to train C or D on &quot;d&quot;, in order to make predictions for what output would be associated with a point lying outside of &quot;d.&quot;

It is common in almost all of science and statistics to answer this question – to choose between C and D – by running cross-validation on &quot;d&quot; with those two algorithms. In other words, to decide whether to generalize from &quot;d&quot; with either C or D&quot;,&quot; we see which of them has better out-of-sample performance when tested within &quot;d&quot;.

Since C and D are fixed, this use of cross-validation to choose between them is itself an algorithm, i.e., a way of generalizing from an arbitrary dataset. Call this algorithm A. (Arguably, A is a simplified model of the scientific method itself.)

We could also use &quot;anti&quot;-cross-validation to make our choice. In other words, we could choose between C and D based on which has &quot;worse&quot; out-of-sample performance within &quot;d&quot;. Again, since C and D are fixed, this use of anti-cross-validation is itself an algorithm. Call that algorithm B.

NFL tells us (loosely speaking) that B must beat A on just as many target functions (and associated datasets &quot;d&quot;) as A beats B. In this very specific sense, the scientific method will lose to the &quot;anti&quot; scientific method just as readily as it wins.

NFL only applies if the target function is chosen from a uniform distribution of all possible functions. If this is not the case, and certain target functions are more likely to be chosen than others, then A may perform better than B overall. The contribution of NFL is that it tells us that choosing an appropriate algorithm requires making assumptions about the kinds of target functions the algorithm is being used for. With no assumptions, no &quot;meta-algorithm&quot;, such as the scientific method, performs better than random choice.

While some scholars argue that NFL conveys important insight, others argue that NFL is of little relevance to machine learning research. If Occam&#x27;s razor is correct, for example if sequences of lower Kolmogorov complexity are more probable than sequences of higher complexity, then (as is observed in real life) some algorithms, such as cross-validation, perform better on average on practical problems (when compared with random choice or with anti-cross-validation).

However, there are major formal challenges in using arguments based on Kolmogorov complexity to establish properties of
the real world, since it is uncomputable, and undefined up to an arbitrary additive constant. Partly in recognition of these challenges,
it has recently been argued that there are ways to circumvent the no free lunch theorems without invoking
Turing machines, by using &quot;meta-induction&quot;. Moreover, the Kolmogorov complexity of machine learning models can be upper bounded through compressions of their data labeling, and it is possible to produce non-vacuous cross-domain generalization bounds via Kolmogorov complexity.

<text>Green Flats is a reef in City Island Harbor, between City Island and Rat Island. It is part of the Pelham Islands.

The reef is composed of mostly small round glacial alluvial rocks and a number of glacial erratics made of granite. It is covered in green seamoss and kelp. Like all true reefs, it is completely underwater (and a hazard to navigation) at high tide and visible at low tide. 

Seagulls take mussels from the shallows and fly about above the reef and drop them and smash the shells on the rocks and then eat the broken up mussels there. Great blue herons may be seen there hunting at low tide.

<text>The Studebaker Champion is an automobile which was produced by the Studebaker Corporation of South Bend, Indiana, from the beginning of the 1939 model year until 1958. It was a full-size car in its first three generations and a mid-size car in its fourth and fifth generation models, serving as the junior model to the Commander.

== Background ==
The success of the Champion in 1939 was imperative to Studebaker&#x27;s survival following weak sales during the 1938 model year. Unlike most other cars, the Champion was designed from a &quot;clean sheet&quot; and had no restrictions caused by necessarily using older parts or requiring the subsequent use of its components in heavier vehicles. Market research guided the selection of features, but a key principle adhered to was the engineering watchword &quot;weight is the enemy&quot;. For its size, it was one of the lightest cars of its era. Its compact straight-six engine outlasted the model itself and was produced to the end of the 1964 model year, with a change to an OHV design in 1961.

The Champion was one of Studebaker&#x27;s best-selling models because of its low price (US$660 for the 2-door business coupe in 1939, equal to $ today), durable engine, and styling. The car&#x27;s ponton styling was authored by industrial designer Raymond Loewy, who had been under contract with Studebaker for the design of their automobiles. Champions won Mobilgas economy runs by posting the highest fuel efficiency tests. During World War II, Champions were coveted for their high efficiency at a time when gas was rationed in the United States. From 1943 to 1945, the Champion engine was used as the powerplant for the Studebaker M29 Weasel personnel and cargo carrier, which also used four sets of the Champion&#x27;s leaf springs arranged transversely for its bogie suspension.

The Champion was phased out in 1958 in preparation for the introduction of the 1959 Studebaker Lark. Prior to this, Studebaker had been placed under receivership, and the company was attempting to return to a profitable position.

==First generation==

The Champion was introduced in 1939. Following the design trends of the time, the grille and headlights were partially integrated. Deluxe models came with arm rests and dual wipers. The I6 engine produced . In 1940, Studebaker claimed . In 1941, the bodies were given a more streamlined look with a wider, lower grille.

==Second generation==
The second generation Champion arrived for the abbreviated 1942 model year. In 1946, Studebaker built a limited number of cars based on this body shell in preparation for its new body and design rollout in 1947. All Studebakers built in 1946 were designated Skyway Champion models. Only the Champion series was produced, it being the most popular before the war.

==Third generation==

In 1947, Studebaker completely redesigned the Champion and the Commander, making them the first new cars after World War II. The styling included a new rear window, flat front fenders in the ponton style which had just gone mainstream, as well as convenience features like backlight illumination for gauges and automatic courtesy lights. The Champion made up 65.08% of the total sales for the automaker in 1947.

The I6 engine produced in 1947. In 1950, output was increased to . Also, new styling (new grille, sheet metal, and rear end) was introduced, as well as an automatic transmission by Borg-Warner.

One of the new styling features on the cars was the wraparound, &quot;greenhouse&quot; rear window that was on 2-door, 5-passenger coupes from 1947 to 1951, at first just an option, in 1950 it was given its own trim line, the Starlight coupe. The &quot;spinner&quot; grille was introduced in 1950, similar to that of a 1949 Ford, but was dropped again for the 1952 model year.

A single four-door, wood-bodied station wagon prototype was also designed. It appeared at several car shows, but was never put into production. The car was then driven for several years by employees to run company errands. Around 1955, the body was removed from the chassis and was sent to the secret graveyard in the wooded infield of the high-speed oval at the company&#x27;s proving ground west of South Bend. In the early 1970s, members of the Studebaker Drivers Club discovered the body of the wagon prototype. Around 1980, members of the club were allowed to remove the wagon prototype for preservation. After a multi-year restoration, the car was put on display at the Studebaker National Museum.


==Fourth generation==

In 1953, Studebaker was redesigned by Robert Bourke from Raymond Loewy&#x27;s design studio (&quot;the Loewy Coupe&quot; or &quot;Low Boy&quot;). The 2-door coupe with a central pillar was called the Starlight, while the more expensive hardtop coupe was called the Starliner. In addition to the Loewy Coupe, there was also a 2-door sedan based on a shortened 4-door sedan. The 2-door sedan has a taller profile, and the back side windows in the 2-door sedans are noticeably bigger than the windows in the Loewy Coupe. The Loewy Coupe is substantially more collectible than the 2-door sedans. Although similar, the body pieces on the 2 cars are not interchangeable. The front end of the new Champion was lower than contemporaries and shares an appearance with the Citroen DS.

No convertible was offered in 1953. However, in late 1952 Studebaker produced one prototype of a 1953 Commander convertible to determine whether the model could be profitably mass-produced. The car was based on the 1953 2-door Starliner hardtop. The car was later modified to 1954 model specifications and was occasionally driven around South Bend by engineers. Additional structural reinforcements were needed to reduce body flexure. Even though the car was equipped with the V8, the added structural weight increased the car&#x27;s 0–60 mph acceleration time to an unacceptable level. In addition, the company did not have the financial resources to add another body type to the model line. The company&#x27;s leadership mistakenly thought that the 2-door sedans, 4-door sedans, and 1954 Conestoga wagon (described below) would sell better than the 2-door coupes, so the company&#x27;s resources were focused on the production of the sedans and the wagon.

When the prototype convertible was no longer needed, engineer E. T. Reynolds ordered the car to be stripped and the body sent to the secret graveyard at the company&#x27;s proving grounds west of South Bend. A non-engineering employee requested permission to purchase the complete car, rather than see it rot away at the proving grounds with other, earlier prototypes of other cars and trucks. Chief engineer Gene Hardig discussed the request with E. T. Reynolds. They agreed to let the employee purchase the car on the condition that the employee never sell it. In the 1970s, the car was rediscovered behind a South Bend gas station and no longer owned by the former employee. It has been through several owners and paint colors.

In 1954, a new 2-door station wagon called the Conestoga was added to the product line. Power of the L-head inline-six remained unchanged at , although in 1955 this was replaced by a larger version with . Also for 1955 the Starlight/Starliner labels were dropped, and a wraparound windshield was introduced. The 1956 Champion sedans received very different bodywork, with pronounced &quot;eyebrows&quot; over the headlights and large tailfins. The coupes received the new Hawk-style bodywork with a centrally placed square grille reminiscent of a period Mercedes-Benz.

The streamlined shape of the Loewy coupes made them popular with land speed racing competitors, both in their stock configuration and modified with chopped tops and other modifications to make them even more streamlined.

==Fifth generation==

In 1957, the Champion Scotsman, a stripped-down Champion, was introduced in an attempt to compete with the “Big Three” (General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler) as well as Nash in the low-price field. Shortly after its introduction, the model was renamed Studebaker Scotsman.

Two engines were available, a &quot;Sweepstakes&quot; L-head I6, or a &quot;Sweepstakes&quot; OHV V8.

<text>The Direction générale de l&#x27;armement (, , abbr. DGA), established in 1961, is the French Government defence procurement and technology agency, responsible within the Ministry of Armed Forces for project management, development, and purchase of weapon systems for the French military. The DGA&#x27;s mission is to prepare the future of French defence systems, equip the French Armed Forces, as well as to promote French defence industry exports.

==Armament project coordination==
The DGA coordinates armament projects with the industry in France, within Europe, but also with customers for export. Together with the Europe of Defence organisation, the DGA promotes the development of armament projects in co-operation and contributes to the development of the European Defence Agency. Fifteen cooperative armament projects are under way. The OCCAr (Joint Organisation of Co-operation as regards Armament) ensures the control of six projects intended to equip the French force, inter allia: combat Tiger helicopter, ground-to-air missiles short Roland/Frole range, Cobra counter-battery radar, family of ground-to-air systems future (FSAF), A400M military transport aircraft, PAAMS anti-aircraft system.

==Other activities==
===Testing and expertise===
The DGA also undertakes the testing and assessment of equipment and military technologies. Test centres are distributed across France to carry out studies in advanced technologies: DGA Hydrodynamics, DGA Aero-engine Testing, DGA CBRN Defence, DGA Information superiority, DGA Land Systems, DGA Missiles Testing, DGA Naval Systems, DGA Flight Testing, DGA Aeronautical Systems, DGA Engineering &amp; Integration. These services contribute to the validation of industrial equipment, but also to the proving of military systems for the programme directorates. Since 2004 DGA, has been organised into two sub-directorates for the coordination of projects dealing respectively with the inter-systems technical approach (Service of architecture inter-systems) and with technological developments (responsible for domains).

===Engineering schools===

In addition, the DGA supervises engineering schools that operate under the scrutiny of the Ministry of defence (École polytechnique, ENSTA ParisTech, Supaéro, ENSTA Bretagne, ENSICA). The high-level military staff of DGA, the Corps of Armament whose members are the &quot;ingénieurs de l&#x27;armement&quot; (IA, literally, &quot;Armament Engineers&quot;), are commissioned officers, who are generally graduates of the École polytechnique, then the ENSTA or Institut supérieur de l&#x27;aéronautique et de l&#x27;espace. The main part of the engineers, the &quot;ingénieurs des études et techniques d&#x27;armement&quot; (IETA, literally, &quot;weaponry studies and technics engineers&quot;) are graduates of the ENSIETA or ENSICA.

===Naval building===
The DGA also formerly had a division for building warships, the &quot;Direction des constructions navales&quot; (&quot;Directorate of Naval Construction&quot;), now formed into a partly state-owned corporation, initially named DCNS in 2007 and rebranded Naval Group in 2017.

== Ranks within the Corps de l&#x27;armement ==

Officers of the Corps de l&#x27;armement have a unique rank structure.

<doc id="1297336" wikidata="Q775614" url="?curid=1297336" title="Neofolk">
<text>Neofolk, also known as apocalyptic folk, is a form of music blending elements of folk and industrial music, which emerged in punk rock circles in the 1980s. Neofolk may either be solely acoustic or combine acoustic folk instrumentation with various other sounds.

==History==

Neofolk has its origins in 1960s musical groups who began taking influence from traditional folk music. Folk musicians such as Vulcan&#x27;s Hammer, Changes, Leonard Cohen, and Comus could be considered harbingers of the sound that later influenced the neofolk artists. Also the later explorations of Velvet Underground&#x27;s band members, specifically those of Nico, have been called a major influence on what later became neofolk.

Neofolk originated in the 1980s, with bands from the post-punk and industrial music scenes, including Death In June, Current 93 and Sol Invictus, who began taking influence from this sound. The sound was embraced by Swans on their early 1990s albums such as &quot;Love of Life&quot; (1992), by the time of their 1997 disbandment, they had become what &quot;Exclaim!&quot; writer Dimitri Nasrallah called the &quot;leading lights in the early 2000&#x27;s neo-folk movement&quot;. The embrace of the genre continued into the releases of lead vocalist Michael Gira&#x27;s subsequent band Angels of Light. During the late 1990s, the sound of the genre began to be embraced by bands who had previously played black metal, such as Empyrium and Haggard.

==Culture==
A majority of artists within the neofolk genre use archaic, cultural and literary references. Local traditions and indigenous beliefs tend to be portrayed heavily as well as esoteric and historical topics. Various forms of neopaganism and occultism play a part in the themes touched upon by many modern and original neofolk artists. Runic alphabets, heathen European sites and other means of expressing an interest in the ancient and ancestral occur often in neofolk music. The sociologist Peter Webb describes this as a legacy from romantic poetry and a reaction against the rationalism of the Enlightenment. Webb writes that for bands like Sol Invictus, this leads to &quot;a type of esoteric spirituality where paganism comes to the fore because of its respect for nature, its openness about sexuality, and its rituals and ceremonies guided by the seasons&quot;. Aesthetically, references to this subject occur within band names, album artwork, clothing and various other means of artistic expression. This has led to some forefathers of the genre and current artists within the genre attributing it to being an aspect of a broader neopagan revival. David Tibet of Current 93, one of the most influential neofolk bands, regards himself as a Christian, but believes that truth always is hidden and is more interested in apocalyptic and apocryphal literature than any Christian canon. During a period of heavy amphetamine and LSD use in the 1980s, he began to revere the children&#x27;s character Noddy as a Gnostic deity.

Many bands use metaphors, sometimes borrowing terms such as Ernst Jünger&#x27;s &quot;Waldgänger&quot; and using fascist symbols and slogans, which has led to an association of the genre with the far-right, though this is contested by fans. References to occult, pagan and politically far-right figures and movement are often intentionally ambiguous. Stefanie von Schnurbein has described the genre&#x27;s approach to these types of material as an &quot;elitist Nietzschean masquerade&quot; which expresses a &quot;(neo-)romantic art-religious attitude&quot;. Some bands have stated opposition to the perceived fascist apologia and themes in the genre and the related genre of martial industrial.

==Related terms and styles==

===Apocalyptic folk===
As a descriptor, apocalyptic folk predates neofolk and was used by David Tibet to describe the music of his band Current 93 during a period in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Initially, Tibet did not intend to imply connection with the folk music genre; rather, that Current 93 was made by &quot;apocalyptic folk[s]&quot;: in other words, apocalyptic people. Tibet and Current 93 produced some covers of traditional English folk songs, and Tibet himself was a great advocate for reclusive English folk singer Shirley Collins.

===Folk noir===

Other vague terms sometimes used to describe artists of this genre include &quot;dark folk&quot; and &quot;pagan folk&quot;. These terms are umbrella terms that also describe various other forms of unrelated music.

===Martial industrial===

Martial industrial or military pop is a genre that shares a lot in common with neofolk and developed very close to it.

<doc id="1297341" wikidata="Q16848704" url="?curid=1297341" title="Institute for Propaganda Analysis">
<text>The Institute for Propaganda Analysis (IPA) was a U.S.-based organization operating from 1937 to 1942, composed of social scientists, opinion leaders, historians, educators, and journalists. Created by Kirtley Mather, Edward A. Filene, and Clyde R. Miller, because of the general concern that increased amounts of propaganda were decreasing the public&#x27;s ability to think critically. The IPA&#x27;s purpose was to spark rational thinking and provide a guide to help the public have well-informed discussions on current issues. &quot;To teach people how to think rather than what to think.&quot; The IPA focused on domestic propaganda issues that might become possible threats to the democratic ways of life.

:For the IPA, Nazism, communism, the conservative anti-communist movement, England’s foreign policy, and Latin American dictatorships were all undemocratic. By labeling these group as such, the IPA promoted a democratic society based on freedom of speech and citizen participation in government, and also attempted to accomplish concrete goals such as preventing the rise of Nazism in America.

:The IPA&#x27;s great strength stemmed from its particular fusion of academic and practical progressivism into an organized anti-propaganda critique that institutionalized the tradition of muckraking and also applied this characteristically American critical approach to the discontents of the Depression.

==Genesis==
Edward A. Filene had amassed a fortune in meeting a mass demand, but he feared that democracy was threatened by propaganda preying upon the unsuspecting citizenry, so he asked Kirtley Mather to help him endow an effort to save democracy. A meeting on &quot;education for democracy&quot; was held March 29, 1937, at the University Club in Boston which attracted Alfred Adler, Lyman Bryson, Edward L. Bernays, and Clyde R. Miller among others. At a second meeting in New York City, Filene provided Miller with a check for $10,000, presumably to finance the Institute in the first year. Filene&#x27;s Good Will Fund agreed on June 9 to continue the funding for three years.

The institute was incorporated on September 23, 1937. The initial board of directors was Clyde R. Miller, Robert S. Lynd, E. Ernest Johnson, James E. Mendenhall, and Robert K. Speer. Added to the board later were Charles A. Beard, Hadley Cantril, Ernest O. Melby, James T. Shotwell, and Percy S. Brown.The board elected its officers as follows: President: Cantril, V.P.: Melby, Sec.: Miller, Tr.:Speer.

== Work ==
The following propaganda tricks/techniques were among the most well-known contributions of the IPA:
# Name-calling
# Glittering generalities
# Transfer
# Testimonial
# Plain folks
# Card stacking
# Bandwagon
The institute had seven staff members based at Columbia University&#x27;s Teachers College. Sociologists studied personality traits to better understand what made someone more susceptible to fascism, including the development of the F-scale. They also brought media literacy training to schools, including a civic engagement curriculum piloted in Springfield, Massachusetts known as The Springfield plan that is still used today. One of the techniques was to label parts of a speech with an icon that represented one of the seven propaganda techniques to help show how it is being used.

== Publications ==
In October 1937 the IPA distributed 3,000 copies of an Announcement edition of the &quot;Propaganda Analysis&quot; bulletin, soliciting subscriptions. The first two weeks produced 750, and there were 2,500 subscribers in the first year. Father Coughlin’s radio talks were selected by the IPA for analysis since they represented &quot;a fairly typical borrowing of foreign anti-democracy propaganda methods by an American propagandist.&quot; Seven tricks of the propagandist were outlined and illustrated by reference to the radio talks in a book &quot;The Fine Art of Propaganda&quot;, edited by Alfred McClung Lee and Elizabeth Briant Lee. As Clyde Miller explained in the Preface, &quot;So far as individuals are concerned, the art of democracy is the art of thinking and discussing independently together.&quot; The book is presented as a &quot;candid and impartial study of the devices and apparent objectives of specialists in the distortion of public opinions.&quot;

To get their message across, the IPA distributed flyers, wrote several issues of the &quot;Propaganda Analysis Bulletin&quot;, and published a series of books, including:

* Violet Edwards (1938) &quot;Group Leader&#x27;s Guide to Propaganda Analysis&quot;
* Alfred McClung Lee &amp; Elizabeth Briant Lee (1939) &quot;The Fine Art of Propaganda&quot;
* James A. Wechsler &amp; Harold Lavine (1940) &quot;War Propaganda and the United States&quot;, reprinted 1972 by Garland Publishing
* &quot;Propaganda Analysis&quot;
* &quot;Propaganda: How To Recognize and Deal With It&quot;

The bulletin &quot;Propaganda Analysis&quot; indirectly targeted the mass public through newspapers, educators, public officials, and thought leaders. The IPA directly targeted the presidents and deans of national colleges, bishops and ministers, educational and religious periodicals, and education students by sending out flyers.

These &quot;ABCs of Propaganda Analysis&quot; encouraged readers to understand and analyze their own views on propagandistic material in order to promote informed, thought-provoking discussions:
* Ascertain the conflict element in the propaganda.
* Behold your own reaction element.
* Concern yourself with &quot;today&#x27;s&quot; propaganda associated with &quot;today&#x27;s&quot; conflicts.
* Doubt that your opinions are &quot;your very own&quot;.
* Evaluate, therefore, with the greatest care &quot;your own propaganda&quot;.
* Find the facts before you come to any conclusion.

== Dissolution ==
The IPA faced many allegations that undermined its purpose. These suggested that the IPA created &quot;more of a destructive skepticism than an intelligent reflectiveness.&quot; The IPA lost support from many of its publishers and also faced internal conflicts through resignations by its board members and its troubled teachers. The approach of World War II also posed a problem. It would force the IPA not only to examine and criticize the enemy&#x27;s propaganda, but assess America&#x27;s use of propaganda as well. The IPA maintains the reason it suspended its operations in 1942 was due to lack of sufficient funds and not the war.

After war was declared on Nazi Germany the neutral stance of propaganda analysis was untenable and the IPA folded in January 1942 with the final issue of its bulletin:
:The publication of dispassionate analyses of all kinds of propaganda, &#x27;good&#x27; and &#x27;bad&#x27;, is easily misunderstood during a war emergency, and more important, the analyses could be misused for undesirable purposes by persons opposing the government’s effort. On the other hand, for the Institute, as an Institute, to propagandize or even appear to do so would cast doubt on its integrity as a scientific body.

== Assessment ==
While the IPA existed many people sought assistance from the organization through the many publications that were available. The process includes teaching the audience to avoid emotion while being deceived by tainted propaganda. In order to get the facts, the institute&#x27;s authors wanted the public to &quot;adopt scientific attitudes towards all questions of fact and to accept the conclusions to which they lead as a basis for action whether he [the student of propaganda] likes them or not.&quot; The IPA encouraged students to think intelligently and independently on topics which they discussed. While many hailed the IPA for its guidance, others argued that the approach was &quot;too simplistic because many messages fell into more than one category, and they do not account for differences between members of the audience, and do not discuss the credibility of the propagandist.&quot; Despite controversy, the IPA was a resource available to American citizens in hopes of enlightening and activating minds to think freely and independently.

In 1940 Edgar Dale and Norma Vernon wrote an Introduction to an annotated bibliography noting the IPA contribution:
:Widespread teaching of propaganda analysis in the schools is due in large measure to the founding of the Institute for Propaganda Analysis in the summer of 1937. ¶ The articles annotated in this bulletin testify to the effect of the bulletins and worksheets of the Institute on the work of teachers throughout the country. Indeed, this very focusing on usable materials for the schools is one secret of the success of the institute.

== Reception ==
In 2018, Dr. Anya Schiffrin argued that many of the ideas from the IPA are still in use today and are foundational for understanding propaganda.

In 2024, Renée DiResta wrote that she found the initiative both effective and prescient.

<text>Carman was a provincial electoral division in the Canadian province of Manitoba. It was created by redistribution in 1999, with territory from Lakeside, Morris, and the now-defunct riding of Gladstone.

Carman was located in the southern region of Manitoba. It was bordered to the north by Portage la Prairie, to the west by Turtle Mountain, to the east by Morris, and to the south by Pembina and Emerson.

The riding was mostly rural. It included the communities of Carman, Somerset, Treherne, St. Claude, Notre Dame de Lourdes, Miami and Elm Creek. Carman also included the Long Plain Reserve, the Dakota Reserve, the Swan Lake Reserve and the Spruce Woods Provincial Park.

The riding&#x27;s population in 1996 was 18,867. In 1999, the average family income was $43,401, and the unemployment rate was 3.00%. Agriculture accounts for 38% of all industry in the riding, followed by health and social services at 9%. Sixteen per cent of Carman&#x27;s residents are francophone, the fourth-highest total in the province. Twelve per cent of the population is German, and a further 7% are aboriginal.

Carman was last held by Progressive Conservative MLA Blaine Pedersen, who was elected as a Progressive Conservative.

For the 2011 election, Carman was dissolved into Portage la Prairie and the newly created riding of Midland.

<doc id="1297348" wikidata="Q228057" url="?curid=1297348" title="Symphony No. 38 (Mozart)">
<text>The Symphony No. 38 in D major, K. 504, was composed by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in late 1786. It premiered in Prague on January 19, 1787, during Mozart&#x27;s first visit to the city. Because it was first performed in Prague, it is popularly known as the Prague Symphony. Mozart&#x27;s autograph thematic catalogue records 6 December 1786 as the date of completion for this composition.

Other works written by Mozart roughly contemporary with this symphony include the Piano Trio in B, K. 502 (completed 18 November 1786), the Piano Concerto No. 25, K. 503 (completed 4 December 1786), and &quot;scena&quot; and rondò &quot;Ch&#x27;io mi scordi di te?&quot;, K. 505, for soprano and orchestra (completed 26 December 1786).

==Prague==

Although Mozart&#x27;s popularity among the Viennese waxed and waned, he was consistently popular among the Bohemians and had a devoted following in Prague. In spite of the fact that the Symphony No. 38 was first performed in Prague, it is not certain that it was actually written for Prague. Much of the confusion surrounds the chronology of its inception. It is clear that Mozart was invited to Prague on the strength of the reception of his opera &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot; during the 1786–87 winter season of the National Theatre (now called the Estates Theatre) in Prague. It is not known, however, when the run started, possibly in November 1786, possibly in December. No mention of the overwhelming success of &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot; is recorded in the Prague press until December 11, 1786, five days after the symphony was completed. It is certain that the opera&#x27;s run began before that week, but there is no documentation to confirm when. It is known from a letter of Leopold Mozart written in January 1787 that Mozart was invited to Prague by a group of musicians and patrons. It is possible that this invitation came through long before &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot; was actually performed in Prague, perhaps during the time of rehearsals, when the brilliance of the music would have been recognized already by the musicians playing it. It is also possible that the Prague Symphony was intended to be performed for the Advent instrumental concerts given in Vienna in December 1786 along with the Piano Concerto No. 25, but all that can be established for certain is that it was not performed in Vienna before it was performed in Prague.

The lavish use of wind instruments might offer a clue that the Prague Symphony was fashioned specifically with the Prague public in mind. The wind players of Bohemia were famed throughout Europe, and the Prague press specifically attributed the great success of the operas &quot;Die Entführung aus dem Serail&quot; and &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot; partially to their skillful deployment of wind instruments. It is also possible that the extensive use of winds in the Prague Symphony was simply the result of experiments with orchestration that Mozart had been cultivating in the orchestral accompaniments for his piano concertos for the previous two years and the new experience he had of writing for winds would have shown up in his symphonies regardless. No matter, the use of wind instruments in the Prague Symphony represents a major advance in Mozart&#x27;s symphonic technique that was imitated in his last symphonies, and also by Haydn, Beethoven, and Schubert. Indeed, it would be difficult to identify any earlier symphony by any composer not of a special type that contains so many passages in which no stringed instruments play at all, only various types of wind ensembles.

==Form==

The early classical symphonies of the eighteenth century were originally cast in three movements (fast–slow–fast) following their origins in Italian overtures. Then, starting in the 1750s, it was normal in Germany and Austria to include a minuet to create the format fast–slow–minuet–fast. The Prague Symphony has no minuet, however, something that would have been extraordinarily unusual for a symphony written in Vienna in the late 1780s. Mozart himself, who wrote many more symphonies in the old-fashioned fast–slow–fast format than Haydn did (because of his closer connections with Italy), never before wrote a three-movement symphony for Vienna, not even as a child in the 1760s, when three-movement symphonies were still common in many parts of Europe. Daniel E. Freeman has suggested that the three-movement format might have been chosen as a means to appeal to the musical public of Prague. It so happens that the only symphonist from Prague that Mozart ever knew well was Josef Mysliveček, a close associate of the Mozart family between 1770 and 1778. As it happens, almost all of Mysliveček&#x27;s symphonies are cast in the three-movement pattern favored in Italy, where he mainly worked throughout his adult life. Nonetheless, a definitive explanation for the three-movement format of the Prague Symphony is still lacking.

The &quot;Prague&quot; Symphony is scored for two flutes, two oboes, two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, timpani and strings.

&lt;/score&gt;

It has three movements, each in sonata form:

#Adagio – Allegro, 
#Andante in G major, 
#Finale (Presto), 

The first movement begins with a slow introduction (he does this in only two other symphonies, No. 36 [&quot;Linz&quot;] and No. 39). Freeman has noted that it is probably the longest and most sophisticated slow introduction written for any major symphony up to that time, perhaps to compensate for the length of the missing minuet in order to help bring the entire work into closer alignment with the customary length of a standard four-movement symphony. The introduction gives way to the main portion of the movement, in which six melodies are developed and recapitulated in a very contrapuntal example of sonata-allegro form. Certain phrases in the first movement bear a resemblance to the overture to &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot;. The allegro proper opens in a complicated manner with the &quot;first theme&quot; traded off between the second violins (who start it) and the first violins (who finish it off). The allegro starts with a passage of notes borrowed from Muzio Clementi&#x27;s keyboard sonata op.24. no.2.

The second movement&#x27;s structure is typical of Mozart symphonies dating from this period, although the music shifts to a minor key in a movement of contrasting moods. It is in the subdominant key of G major.

The third movement is a lively Presto in which the flute plays a prominent role, especially in counterpointing the main melody in the development section. This movement &quot;shows Mozart in an unusual mood, nearer to Beethoven&#x27;s boisterousness than his fastidious taste normally allowed him to go.&quot;

<text>Vice-Admiral John Hughes-Hallett CB DSO (1 December 1901 – 5 April 1972) was a British naval commander and politician. He was the Naval Commander during the Dieppe Raid of 1942.

==Early life and career==

Hughes-Hallett was born in December 1901, to a distinguished armed services family. His father was Colonel Wyndham Hughes-Hallett, his mother Clementina Mary Loch (25 Mar 1869 – 8 Dec 1948). They were relatively old at 56 and 31 years old, respectively, at the time of his birth.

Educated at Bedford School, Hughes-Hallett had a distinguished career in the Royal Navy, beginning as a Midshipman on HMS &quot;Lion&quot;, May 1918. He was promoted to staff rank and during the Second World War served in a variety of roles. During the Norwegian campaign of 1940 he saw active service on HMS &quot;Devonshire&quot; and was mentioned in despatches.

==Later naval career==
In 1940 to 1941 Hughes-Hallett played a key role in cross-Channel raids. He assisted in planning raids under Mountbatten and was the Naval Commander during the misconceived Dieppe Raid of 1942. Although the raid itself was not successful and cost many lives, it did lead to new strategies for cross-Channel operations. The actual proposer of the idea of the Mulberry Harbour is disputed, but it is believed by some to have been Hughes-Hallett. At a meeting following the Dieppe raid, he declared that if a port could not be captured, then one should be taken across the Channel. Although this was met with derision at the time, the concept of Mulberry Harbours began to take shape when Hughes-Hallett moved to be Naval Chief of Staff to the Operation Overlord planners.

Hughes-Hallett became Commodore commanding the Channel Assault Force and Naval Chief of Staff (X) from 1942 to 1943. Of the five Assault Forces, Hughes-Hallett&#x27;s Force &quot;J&quot; started its training with a decided advantage over the other four; its nucleus having been formed as far back as October 1942, with headquarters at Cowes. On 1 May 1943, Commodore Hughes-Hallett succeeded Rear Admiral Philip Vian as the head of the Naval Branch at Supreme Allied Command. He served as Captain of HMS &quot;Jamaica&quot; from December 1943. After the war, he was in command of HMS &quot;Vernon&quot;, (1946-8). Vernon in Portsmouth was the navy&#x27;s Torpedo training centre and he had to cope with the problems arising from the recent creation of the Electrical branch. Until this a ship&#x27;s electrics had been looked after by torpedomen but they had become so complex a new separate branch was deemed necessary. He then commanded HMS Illustrious&#x27;(1948–1949) and after that was Vice-Controller of the Navy in Bath, 1950–1952, and then Flag Officer, Heavy Squadron, Home Fleet, 1952–3. A strict disciplinarian, he was sometimes known as &#x27;Hughes-Hitler&#x27;.

==Political career==
Hughes-Hallett retired from the Royal Navy in 1954 as Vice-Admiral on his adoption as a Conservative Parliamentary candidate. A problem arose when he enquired of the Secretary of the Admiralty what pension he could expect, at that time MPs got no pension, and the Secretary erroneously gave him a figure that was far too high. When he discovered this he threatened legal proceedings and as he was now an MP this was very embarrassing to the Government; it was discussed at Cabinet level on at least two occasions. (Cabinet Minutes in National Archives). First elected in September 1954, he served as the Member of Parliament for Croydon East, later Croydon North East, until the 1964 election, defeating Labour&#x27;s Walter Wolfgang at the 1959 general election. He was a British Representative at the Council of Europe between 1958 and 1960 and Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport for Shipping and Shipbuilding, 1961 to 1964. In the 1958–59 parliament, he successfully piloted his private members bill through parliament, although only tenth in the ballot. It became the Road Traffic (Driving of Motor Cycles) Act. He was very popular among the Young Conservatives and always interested in their activities.

==Later years==
In the late 1960s he suffered a serious stroke which hampered further activities. In his last years he lived in Slindon, near Arundel, Sussex, England and died in 1972. He never married. His brother, Charles Hughes-Hallett was a Rear Admiral. He had drafted memoirs, but they have not as yet been published.

==Film portrayals==
Captain Hughes-Hallett was a major character in the Canadian CBC miniseries &quot;Dieppe&quot;, in which he was played by actor Robert Joy.

==Homage==
Around 1990, a street in Caen (France) was named after Commodore Hughes-Hallett, linking &quot;avenue Amiral Mountbatten&quot; to &quot;avenue Maréchal Montgomery&quot; and &quot;rue Colonel Rémy&quot;, in a district close to the &quot;Mémorial pour la Paix&quot; museum, where a majority of streets commemorate personalities linked with the Second World War, the Résistance, and the subsequent making of the European Community. Unfortunately, the surname is misspelt: &quot;rue Commodore J.H. Hallet&quot;.

<text>Cuban Ledge is a reef or islet composed chiefly of sand and small rocks in Eastchester Bay, the Bronx, in Long Island Sound. It is located between Rodman&#x27;s Neck and Country Club in Eastchester Bay and is visible only during periods of low tide. It is a hazard to boats, and is marked with a signal tower. 

==Origin and name==
Several stories have been circulated regarding how the Cuban Ledge formed and got its name. According to some accounts, it was formed in 1898 when sailors dumped cargo rocks overboard from a ship that was abandoned when its crew left for Cuba to fight in the Spanish–American War. Another version of the story indicates that it was created when a large barge carrying sand and gravel ran aground on a shoal. A salvage crew was mounted there and the barge was rescued, but much of the sand and gravel it was carrying needed to be removed in order to aid the rescue. The workers dumped the sand and rock overboard to get the barge off the shoal, thus forming the reef.

One story of its name stipulates that a ship by the name of &quot;Cuban Lady&quot; ran aground on the reef in the 1880s. Other theories suggest that the ledge resembles the outline of the island of Cuba.

<text>Howard Altman (born March 1, 1960) is an American journalist and newspaper editor who currently writes for &quot;The War Zone&quot;. He was an investigative reporter, columnist and news editor at the &quot;Philadelphia City Paper&quot; for many years, and its editor-in-chief from March 2003 until he was fired in May 2004. During his tenure at the &quot;City Paper&quot;, Altman won multiple local and state awards in the &quot;weekly alternative&quot; or &quot;non-daily&quot; categories for his columns, sports coverage, and investigative reporting. Altman and colleagues have also won awards as editors for the front-page design of the &quot;City Paper&quot;&#x27;s issue dealing with the September 11, 2001 attacks.

Relocating to Tampa, Florida, Altman joined &quot;The Tampa Tribune&quot; as courts and cops editor in the converged newsroom of the &quot;Tribune&quot;, Tampa Bay Online (tbo.com) and the local NBC television affiliate, WFLA-TV. There, he helped form the Continuous News Desk, which merged all three platforms into one synchronized unit he helped run. It revolutionized how and when news was delivered across platforms. Page views and time on site skyrocketed, forcing competition to follow suit. 

Altman later became the &quot;Tribune&#x27;s&quot; military reporter, given the large military presence in the Tampa Bay. This presence includes MacDill Air Force Base, the two unified combatant commands that are headquartered at MacDill AFB, the Avon Park Air Force Range, Coast Guard Air Station Clearwater, Coast Guard Sector St. Petersburg, numerous smaller U.S. Coast Guard installations, multiple homeported Coast Guard cutters, various Reserve and National Guard facilities, two large Veterans Administration medical centers, and one of the largest active duty military, reserve military (to include National Guard), retired military and non-career military veteran populations in Florida.

With the May 2016 acquisition of &quot;The Tampa Tribune&quot; by its long-time St. Petersburg, Florida-based competitor, &quot;The Tampa Bay Times&quot; (formerly &quot;The St. Petersburg Times&quot;), Altman became the senior writer/military affairs for &quot;The Tampa Bay Times&quot;. In addition to print media, Altman is also a periodic guest on local radio and television segments in the Tampa Bay area regarding military affairs. After departing Tampa Bay, Altman moved to MilitaryTimes as senior managing editor. In March 2022 he was fired by Military Times. In April 2022 &quot;The War Zone&quot; announced his hire as a staff writer.

<doc id="1297373" wikidata="Q1087216" url="?curid=1297373" title="Christ on the Mount of Olives (Beethoven)">
<text>Christus am Ölberge (in English, &quot;Christ on the Mount of Olives&quot;), Op. 85, is an oratorio by Ludwig van Beethoven portraying the emotional turmoil of Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane prior to his crucifixion. It was begun in the fall of 1802, soon after his completion of the Heiligenstadt Testament, as indicated by evidence in the Wielhorsky sketchbook. The libretto in German is by the poet , editor of the &quot;Wiener Zeitung&quot;, with whom Beethoven worked closely. It was written in a very short period; in a letter to Breitkopf &amp; Härtel written shortly after the oratorio&#x27;s completion, Beethoven spoke of having written it in &quot;a few weeks&quot;, although he later claimed that the piece required no more than 14 days to complete. It was first performed on April 5, 1803 at the Theater an der Wien in Vienna; in 1811, it was revised by Beethoven for publication by Breitkopf &amp; Härtel. The 10 years that passed between the composition of the work and its publication resulted in its being assigned a relatively high opus number. The piece premiered in the United States in 1809; it was Beethoven&#x27;s first success in the United States.

==Composition==
The work is a dramatic oratorio and is considered a much more humanistic portrayal of the Christ passion than other settings, such as those by Bach. It concludes at the point of Jesus personally accepting his fate, placing the emphasis on his own decision rather than the later Crucifixion or Resurrection. The oratorio is scored for soprano, tenor, and bass soloists, with standard SATB chorus and symphony orchestra. The tenor sings as Jesus, with the soprano as a seraph (angel) and the bass as Peter. A complete performance lasts approximately 50 minutes.

Beethoven&#x27;s only oratorio, he was quite critical of the piece and of the performance of the orchestra and chorus at its premiere. He panned Huber&#x27;s libretto, saying, in an 1824 letter to the Gesellschaft für Musikfreunde, &quot;Let us leave out of consideration &quot;the value&quot; of poems of this sort. We all know that allowances are to be made... so far as I am concerned, I would rather set Homer, Klopstock, Schiller to music. If they offer difficulties to overcome, &quot;these immortal poets&quot; at least are worthy of it.&quot; (Beethoven eventually did set Schiller to music in his monumental Ninth Symphony, nearly twenty years after the oratorio.) The editors at Breitkopf &amp; Härtel agreed with Beethoven&#x27;s critical assessment of the text, and Christian Schreiber was enlisted to make massive changes to the libretto. However, upon reviewing the changes, Beethoven still was not happy, saying, &quot;I know that the text is extremely bad, but if even a bad text is conceived as a whole entity, it is very difficult to avoid disrupting it by individual corrections&quot;.

==Structure==
The composition consists of six movements.
:1. Introduction (Grave – Adagio) in E♭ minor – Recitative „Jehova, du, mein Vater!“ – Aria (Allegro) „Meine Seele ist erschüttert!“ in c minor
:2. Recitative „Erzittre, Erde, Jehovahs Sohn liegt hier“ in A major – Aria (Larghetto) „Preist des Erlösers Güte“ in G major – Chorus (Allegro) „Oh, Heil euch, ihr Erlösten!“ in G major
:3. Recitative „Verkündet, Seraph, mir dein Mund“ – Duet (Adagio molto) „So ruhe denn mit ganzer Schwere“ in A♭ major
:4. Recitative „Willkommen, Tod!“ in F major – Chorus (Alla marcia) „Wir haben ihn gesehen“ in C major
:5. Recitative (Tempo della Marcia) „Die mich zu fangen ausgezogen sind“ – Chorus (Allegro molto) „Hier ist er, hier ist er“ in D major
:6. Recitative (Molto allegro) „Nicht ungestraft soll der Verwegnen Schar“ – Trio and chorus (Allegro ma non troppo) „In meinen Adern wühlen“ in B♭ major – Chorus with solo (Molto allegro) „Auf, auf, eingreifet der verräter – Final chorus (Maestoso – Allegro) „Welten singen“ - „Preiset ihn, ihr Engelschöre“ in C major

==Instrumentation==
:SATB choir
:3 soloists (soprano, tenor and bass)
:2 flutes
:2 oboes
:2 clarinets in B♭
:2 bassoons
:2 trumpets in D and E♭
:2 horns in B♭, C, D and E♭
:3 trombones (alto, tenor and bass)
:timpani
:1st violins
:2nd violins
:violas
:cellos
:double basses
The soloists are personas: the soprano is a Seraph, the tenor is Jesus and the bass is the apostle Peter.

==Reception==
The critical response to the work&#x27;s initial performance was mixed; while the &quot;Zeitung für die Elegante Welt&#x27;s&quot; critic wrote that the oratorio contained &quot;a few admirable passages&quot;, a review in the &quot;Freymüthige Blätter&quot; called the piece &quot;too artificial in structure and lacking expressiveness, especially in the vocal music&quot;, and claimed that the performance &quot;was unable to achieve really marked approbation&quot;. It has since drifted somewhat into obscurity, and is rarely performed, being regarded by some as falling below Beethoven&#x27;s usual standards of excellence. However, despite conflicting contemporary critical reports and Beethoven&#x27;s own misgivings about the libretto, &quot;...after its premiere in 1803 the work was performed four times in 1804, and repeated every year, always drawing full houses, until it was banned in 1825 by the Hofmusikgraf.&quot;

The &quot;Welten singen...&quot; finale chorus has enjoyed some popularity on its own, usually being rendered as a &quot;Hallelujah&quot;, frequently performed by church, high school, and college choirs.

<text>Vehkalahti () is a former municipality surrounding the town of Hamina in south-eastern Finland. At the beginning of 2003 Hamina and Vehkalahti combined to form a new town of Hamina.


==History==
These southern parts of Karelia are known to be the oldest parts of modern Finland with settlements. The first markings of Vehkalahti as a continuous settlement or village date back to 1336, when it became a major place for east/west trading. The plans to build a town grew slowly as the place became crowded. In 1653 the area surrounding the village church officially became a town, which was called Vehkalahden Uusikaupunki (, ).

==Surroundings==
While the area in the immediate vicinity of the church building became a town, the surrounding land remained countryside. Formerly the area of Vehkalahti was much larger, almost the entire Kymenlaakso. Still, later many areas became new municipalities. The largest population centers are Husula, Salmenkylä, Uusi-Summa, Poitsila and Neuvottoma, there are also many rural villages like Metsäkylä, Reitkalli, Kannusjärvi and Pyhältö.

==Peculiar Nobility==
In literature, Vehkalahti is particularly renowned for its peculiar medieval petty nobility, &quot;knaappiaateli&quot; (families Husgafvel, Pilhjerta and Brandstaka), which also acted as a link between Vehkalahti and the Vyborg Castle. Built by Swedes, about east of Vehkalahti, it became a place of great military importance for European east/west foreign communication. Today it is located on Russian territory.

==Vehkalahti church==
The Vehkalahti church (now known as St. Mary&#x27;s church, or Marian kirkko in Finnish) was built in the 14th century at the place where the town of Hamina is now.

<text>A police car is an emergency vehicle used by police for transportation during patrols and responses to calls for service. A type of emergency vehicle, police cars are used by police officers to patrol a beat, quickly reach incident scenes, and transport and temporarily detain suspects.

Police vehicles, like other emergency vehicles, usually bare livery (markings) to distinguish them as such. They often use emergency lights (usually blue, red or blue and red colored) and sirens to warn other motorists of their presence, especially when responding to calls for service. Police cars usually contain communication devices, weaponry, and a variety of equipment for dealing with emergency situations. 

==History==

The first police car was an electric wagon used by the Akron Police Department in Akron, Ohio, in 1899. The first operator of the police patrol wagon was Officer Louis Mueller, Sr. It could reach and travel before its battery needed to be recharged. The car was designed by city mechanical engineer Frank Loomis. The US$2,400 vehicle was equipped with electric lights, gongs, and a stretcher. The car&#x27;s first assignment was to pick up a drunken man at the junction of Main and Exchange streets.

Ford introduced the flathead V8 in the 1932 Ford as the first mass-marketed V8 car; this low-priced, mass-marketed V8 car became popular with police in the United States, establishing strong brand loyalty that continued into the 21st century. Starting in the 1940s, major American automakers, namely the Big Three, began to manufacture specialized police cars. Over time, these became their own dedicated police fleet offerings, such as the Ford Police Interceptor and Chevrolet 9C1.

In the United Kingdom, Captain Athelstan Popkess, Chief Constable of the Nottingham City Police from 1930 to 1959, transformed British police from their Victorian era foot patrol beat model to the modern car-based reactive response model, through his development of the &quot;Mechanized Division&quot;, which used two-way radio communication between police command and police cars. Under Popkess, the Nottingham City Police began to use police cars as an asset that police tactics centered around, such as overlaying police car patrol sectors over foot patrol beats and using police cars to pick up foot patrol officers while responding to crimes.

Increased car ownership in the post-World War II economic expansion led to police cars becoming significantly more common in most developed countries, as police jurisdictions expanded farther out into residential and suburban areas, car-oriented urban planning and highways dominated cities, vehicular crimes and police evasion in cars increased, and more equipment was issued to police officers, to the point that vehicles became practically necessary for modern law enforcement.

==Types==
Various types of police car exist. Depending on the organization of the law enforcement agency, the class of vehicle used as a police car, and the environmental factors of the agency&#x27;s jurisdiction, many of the types below may or may not exist in certain fleets, or their capabilities may be merged to create all-rounded units with shared vehicles as opposed to specialized units with separate vehicles.

===Patrol car===
A patrol car is a police car used for standard patrol. Used to replace traditional foot patrols, the patrol car&#x27;s primary function is to provide transportation for regular police duties, such as responding to calls, enforcing laws, or simply establishing a more visible police presence while on patrol. Driving a patrol car allows officers to reach their destinations more quickly and to cover more ground compared to other methods. Patrol cars are typically designed to be identifiable as police cars to the public and thus almost always have proper markings, roof-mounted emergency lights, and sirens.

===Response car===
A response car, also known as a pursuit car, area car, rapid response unit, or fast response car, is a police car used to ensure quick responses to emergencies compared to patrol cars. It is likely to be of a higher specification, capable of higher speeds, and often fitted with unique markings and increased-visibility emergency lights. These cars are generally only used to respond to emergency incidents and may carry specialized equipment not used in regular patrol cars, such as long arms.

===Traffic car===

A traffic car, also known as a highway patrol car, traffic enforcement unit, speed enforcement unit, or road policing unit, is a police car tasked with enforcing traffic laws and conducting traffic stops, typically on major roadways such as highways. They are often relatively high-performance vehicles compared to patrol cars, as they must be capable of catching up to fast-moving vehicles. They may have specific markings or special emergency lights to either improve or hinder visibility. Alternatively, some traffic cars may use the same models as patrol cars, and may barely differ from them aside from markings, radar speed guns, and traffic-oriented equipment.

===Unmarked car===

An unmarked car is a police car that lacks markings and easily-visible or roof-mounted emergency lights. They are generally used for varying purposes, ranging from standard patrol and traffic enforcement to sting operations and detective work. They have the advantage of not being immediately recognizable, and are considered a valuable tool in catching criminals in the commission of a crime or by surprise. The resemblance an unmarked police car has to a civilian vehicle varies based on their application: they may use the same models as marked patrol cars, and may be virtually identical to them aside from the lack of roof-mounted emergency lights, with pushbars and spotlights clearly visible; alternatively, they may use common civilian vehicle models that blend in with traffic, with emergency lights embedded in the grille or capable of being hidden and revealed, such as Japanese unmarked cars having retractable beacons built into the car&#x27;s roof.

Unmarked cars typically use regular civilian license plates, occasionally even in jurisdictions where emergency vehicles and government vehicles use unique license plates, though some agencies or jurisdictions may be able to use the unique plates anyway; for example, American federal law enforcement agencies may use either government plates or regular license plates.

The term &quot;undercover car&quot; is often used to describe unmarked cars. However, this usage is erroneous: &quot;unmarked&quot; cars are police cars that lack markings but have police equipment, emergency lights, and sirens, while &quot;undercover&quot; cars lack these entirely and are essentially civilian vehicles used by law enforcement in undercover operations to avoid detection.

The close resemblance of unmarked cars to civilian cars has created concerns of police impersonation. Some police officers advise motorists that they do not have to pull over in a secluded location and instead can wait until they reach somewhere safer. In the UK, officers must be wearing uniforms in order to make traffic stops. Motorists can also ask for the officer&#x27;s badge and identification or call an emergency number or a police non-emergency number to confirm if the police unit is genuine.

==== Ghost car ====

A ghost car, also known as a stealth car or semi-marked car, is a police car that combines elements of both an unmarked car and a marked patrol car, featuring markings that are either similar colors to the vehicle&#x27;s body paint, or are reflective graphics that are difficult to see unless illuminated by lights or viewed at certain angles. Ghost cars are often used for traffic enforcement, though they may also be used in lieu of unmarked cars in jurisdictions where they are prohibited or have their enforcement capabilities limited, such as being unable to conduct traffic stops. In these instances, the markings on ghost cars may be sufficient to legally count as marked police cars, despite the markings being difficult to see.

===Utility vehicle===

A utility vehicle is a police car used for utility or support purposes as opposed to regular police duties. Utility vehicles are usually all-wheel drive vehicles with cargo space such as SUVs, pickup trucks, vans, utes, or off-road vehicles. They are often used to transport or tow assets such as trailers, equipment, or other vehicles such as police boats; they are alternatively used for or are capable of off-roading, especially in fleets where most other vehicles cannot do so. They can also be used for animal control, if that is the responsibility of police within that jurisdiction. Some utility vehicles can be used for transporting teams of officers and occasionally have facilities to securely detain and transport a small number of suspects, provided there is enough seating space.

===Police dog vehicle===

A police dog vehicle, also known as a K-9 vehicle or a police dog unit, is a police car modified to transport police dogs. The models used for these vehicles range from the same as patrol cars to dedicated SUVs, pickup trucks, or vans. To provide sufficient space for the police dog, there is usually a cage in the trunk or rear seats with enough space for the dog, though some agencies may put the cage in the front passenger seat, or may lack a cage entirely and simply have the dog in the rear compartment. There may or may not be space to transport detainees or additional officers. Police dog vehicles almost always have markings noting they have a police dog on board, typically just the agency&#x27;s standard markings with the added notice.

===Decoy car===
A decoy car is a police car used to establish a police presence, typically to deter traffic violations or speeding, without a police officer actually being present. They may be older models retired from use, civilian cars modified to resemble police cars, or demonstration vehicles. In some instances, a &quot;decoy car&quot; may not be a vehicle at all, but rather a life-sized cutout or sign depicting a police car. Use of decoy cars is intended to ensure crime deterrence without having to commit manpower, allowing the officer that would otherwise be there to be freed up for other assignments. 

In the United Kingdom, decoy liveried police cars and vans may be parked on filling station forecourts to deter motorists dispensing fuel then making off without payment, also known as &quot;bilking&quot;.

The use of decoy cars is entirely up to the agency, though in 2005, the Virginia General Assembly considered a bill that would make decoy cars a legal requirement for police. The bill stated in part: &quot;Whenever any law-enforcement vehicle is permanently taken out of service... such vehicle shall be placed at a conspicuous location within a highway median in order to deter violations of motor vehicle laws at that location. Such vehicles shall... be rotated from one location to another as needed to maintain their deterrent effect.&quot;

===Surveillance car===
A surveillance car is a police car used for surveillance purposes. Usually SUVs, vans, or trucks, surveillance cars can be marked, unmarked, undercover, or disguised, and may be crewed or remotely monitored. They are used to gather evidence of criminal offenses or provide better vantage points at events or high-traffic areas. The surveillance method used varies, and may include CCTV, hidden cameras, wiretapping devices, or even aerial platforms. Some surveillance cars may also be used as bait cars, deployed to catch car thieves.

===Armored vehicle===

A police armored vehicle, also known as a SWAT vehicle, tactical vehicle, or rescue vehicle, is an armored vehicle used in a police capacity. They are typically four-wheeled armored vehicles with similar configurations to military light utility vehicles, infantry mobility vehicles, internal security vehicles, MRAPs, or similar armored personnel carriers, that lack mounted and installed weaponry. As their name suggests, they are typically used to transport police tactical units such as SWAT teams, though they may also be used in riot control or to establish police presence at events.

=== Mobile command center ===
A mobile command center, also known as an emergency operations center, mobile command post, or mobile police station, is a truck used to provide a central command center at the scene of an incident, or to establish a visible police presence or temporary police station at an event. 

===Bomb disposal vehicle===

A bomb disposal vehicle is a vehicle used by bomb disposal squads to transport equipment and bomb disposal robots, or to store bombs for later disposal. They are often vans or trucks, typically with at least one bomb containment chamber installed in the rear of the vehicle, and ramps to allow bomb disposal robots to access the vehicle. Bomb disposal vehicles are generally not explosive-resistant and are only used for transporting explosives for disposal, not actively disposing of them.

=== Armed vehicle ===

An armed police vehicle is a police vehicle that has lethal weaponry installed on it. These are often technicals or light utility vehicles with machine gun turrets, and may or may not lack emergency lights and sirens. Armed police vehicles are very rare and are usually only used in wartime, in regions with very high violent crime rates, or where combat with organized crime or insurgencies is common to the point that armed police vehicles are necessary; for example, the Iraqi Police received technicals during the Iraq War, and the National Police of Ukraine used armed vehicles during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, including the STREIT Group Spartan and a modified BMW 6 Series with a mounted machine gun.

These should not be confused with police vehicles that have turrets but do not have guns, which are often just police armored vehicles or, if less-lethal munitions are used, riot control vehicles.

===Riot control vehicle===

A riot control vehicle, also known as a riot suppression vehicle or simply a riot vehicle, is an armored or reinforced police vehicle used for riot control. A wide array of vehicles, from armored SUVs and vans to dedicated trucks and armored personnel carriers, are used by law enforcement to suppress or intimidate riots, protests, and public order crimes; hold and reinforce a police barricade to keep the scene contained; or simply transport officers and equipment at the scene in a manner safer than what could be achieved with a standard police car.

Common modifications include tear gas launchers, shields, and caged windows. Some riot control vehicles also include less-lethal weaponry and devices, such as water cannons and long-range acoustic devices.

===Community engagement, liaison, and demonstration vehicles===
A community engagement vehicle, also known as a liaison vehicle, demonstration vehicle, or parade car, is a police car used for display and community policing purposes, but not for patrol duties. These are often performance cars, modified cars, classic police cars, or vehicles seized from convicted criminals and converted to police cars that are used to represent the agency in parades, promote a specific program (such as the D.A.R.E. program), or help build connections between law enforcement and those that the vehicle appeals to.

Some cars can be visibly marked but not fitted with audio or visual warning devices. These are often used by community liaison officers, administrative staff, or high-ranking officers for transport to meetings, engagements, and community events.

Some vehicles are produced by automotive manufacturers with police markings to showcase them to police departments; these are usually concepts, prototypes, or reveals of their police fleet offerings. Emergency vehicle equipment manufacturers such as Federal Signal, Whelen, and Code 3 also use unofficial police cars to demonstrate their emergency vehicle equipment.

==Equipment==

Police cars are usually passenger car models which are upgraded to the specifications required by the purchasing police service. Several vehicle manufacturers provide a &quot;police package&quot; option, which is built to police specifications from the factory. Agencies may add to these modifications by adding their own equipment and making their own modifications after purchasing a vehicle.

===Mechanical modifications===

Modifications a police car might undergo include adjustments for higher durability, speed, high-mileage driving, and long periods of idling at a higher temperature. This is usually accomplished through installing heavy duty suspension, brakes, calibrated speedometer, tires, alternator, transmission, and cooling systems. The car&#x27;s stock engine may be modified or replaced by a more powerful engine from another vehicle from the manufacturer. The car&#x27;s electrical system may also be upgraded to accommodate for the additional electronic police equipment.

===Warning systems===

Police vehicles are often fitted with audible and visual warning systems to alert other motorists of their approach or position on the road. In many countries, use of the audible and visual warnings affords the officer a degree of exemption from road traffic laws (such as the right to exceed speed limits, or to treat red stop lights as a yield sign) and may also suggest a duty on other motorists to yield for the police car and allow it to pass.

Warning systems on a police vehicle can be of two types: &quot;passive&quot; or &quot;active&quot;.

====Passive visual warnings====

Passive visual warnings are the livery markings on the vehicle. Police vehicle markings usually make use of bright colors or strong contrast with the base color of the vehicle. Some police cars have retroreflective markings that reflect light for better visibility at night, though others may only have painted on or non-reflective markings. Examples of markings and designs used in police liveries include black and white, Battenburg markings, Sillitoe tartan, and &quot;jam sandwich&quot; markings.

Police vehicle markings include, at the very least, the word &quot;&quot;police&quot; (or a similar applicable phrase if the agency does not use that term, such as &quot;sheriff&quot;, &quot;gendarmerie&quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;state trooper&quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;public safety&quot;&quot; etc.) and the agency&#x27;s name or jurisdiction (such as &quot;national police&quot; or &quot;&quot;Chicago Police&quot;&quot;). Also common are the agency&#x27;s seal, the jurisdiction&#x27;s seal, and a unit number. Text is usually in the national language or local language, though other languages may be used where appropriate, such as in ethnic enclaves or areas with large numbers of tourists.

Unmarked vehicles generally lack passive visual warnings, while ghost cars have markings that are visible only at certain angles, such as from the rear or sides, making them appear unmarked when viewed from the front.

Another unofficial passive visual warning of police vehicles can simply be the vehicle&#x27;s silhouette if its use as a police car is common, such as that of the Ford Crown Victoria in North America, or the presence of emergency vehicle equipment on the vehicle, such as a pushbar or a roof-mounted lightbar.

====Active visual warnings====

Active visual warnings are the emergency lights on the vehicle. These lights are used while responding to attract the attention of other road users and coerce them into yielding for the police car to pass. The colors used by police car lights depend on the jurisdiction, though they are commonly blue and red. Several types of flashing lights are used, such as rotating beacons, halogen lamps, or LED strobes. Some agencies use arrow sticks to direct traffic, or message display boards to provide short messages or instructions to motorists. The headlights and tail lights of some vehicles can be made to flash, or small strobe lights can be fitted in the vehicle lights.

====Audible warnings====

Audible warnings are the sirens on the vehicle. These sirens alert road users to the presence of an emergency vehicle before they can be seen, to warn of their approach. The first audible warnings were mechanical bells, mounted to either the front or roof of the car. A later development was the rotating air siren, which makes noise when air moves past it. Most modern police vehicles use electronic sirens, which can produce a range of different noises. Different models and manufacturers have distinct siren noises; one siren model, the Rumbler, emits a low frequency sound that can be felt through vibrations, allowing those who would not otherwise hear the siren or see the emergency vehicle to still know it is approaching.

Different siren noises may be used depending on traffic conditions and the context. For example, on a clear road, &quot;wail&quot; (a long up-and-down unbroken tone) is often used, whereas in heavy slow traffic or at intersections, &quot;yelp&quot; (essentially a sped-up wail) may be preferred. Other noises are used in certain countries and jurisdictions, such as &quot;phaser&quot; (a series of brief sped-up beeps) and &quot;hi-lo&quot; (a two-tone up-down sound). Some vehicles may also be fitted with electronic airhorns.

===Police-specific equipment===
A wide range of equipment is carried in police cars, used to make police work easier or safer. The installation of this equipment in a police car partially transforms it into a desk. Police officers use their car to fill out different forms, print documents, type on a computer or a console, and examine different screens, all while driving. Ergonomics in layout and installation of these items in the police car plays an important role in the comfort and safety of the police officers at work and preventing injuries such as back pain and musculoskeletal disorders.

==== Communication devices ====
Police radio systems are generally standard equipment in police cars, used to communicate between the officers assigned to the car and the dispatcher. Mobile data terminals are also common as alternative ways to communicate with the dispatcher or receive important information, and are typically a tablet or a dashboard-mounted laptop installed in the car.

==== Suspect transport enclosure ====
Suspect transport enclosures are typically located at the rear of the vehicle, taking up the rear seats or rear compartment. The seats are sometimes modified to be a hard metal or plastic bench. Separating the transport enclosure is often a partition, a barrier between the front and rear compartments typically made of metal with a window made of reinforced glass, clear plastic, or metal mesh or bars. Some police cars do not have partitions; in these instances, another officer may have to sit in the rear to secure the detainee, or a dedicated transport vehicle may be called.

==== Weapon storage ====
Weapons may be stored in the trunk or front compartment of the vehicle. In countries where police officers are already armed with handguns, long guns such as rifles or shotguns may be kept on a gun rack in the front or in the trunk, alongside ammunition. In countries where police are not armed or do not keep their guns on them, handguns may be kept in the car instead; for example, Norwegian Police Service officers are issued handguns, but they keep them in a locked compartment in their car that requires high-ranking authorization to access. Less-lethal weaponry and riot gear may also be stored in the trunk.

==== Rescue equipment ====
Rescue equipment such as first aid kits, dressing, fire extinguishers, defibrillators, and naloxone kits are often kept in police cars to provide first aid and rescue when necessary.

==== Scene equipment ====
Tools such as barricade tape, traffic cones, traffic barricades, and road flares are often kept in police cars to secure scenes for further investigation.

==== Recording equipment ====
Recording equipment such as dashcams and interior cameras are installed in some police cars to make audio and video recordings of incidents, police interactions, and evidence.

==== Detectors ====
Detector devices such as radar speed guns, automatic number-plate recognition, and LoJack are used in some police cars, typically in traffic enforcement, to detect speeding violations, read multiple plates for flags (such as warrants or lack of insurance) without having to manually check, and track stolen cars, respectively.

==== Pushbar ====
Pushbars, also known as bullbars, rambars, or nudge bars, are fitted to the chassis of a police car to augment the front bumper. They allow the car to push disabled vehicles out of a roadway, breach small and light objects, and conduct PIT maneuvers with less damage to the front of the vehicle. Pushbar designs vary; some are small and only protect the grille, while others have extensions that shield as far as the headlights. Some pushbars also have emergency lights installed on them, providing additional visual warnings.

==== Spotlights ====
Spotlights are small searchlights typically installed on the A-pillar of a police car. They are used to provide light in darkened areas or where necessary, such as down alleyways or into a suspect&#x27;s car during a nighttime traffic stop. These spotlights can be aimed and activated by the officers inside the vehicle. Usually, one or two are installed on the car, though more may occasionally be installed on the roof, grille, bumper, or pushbar.

==== Run lock ====
Run locks allow the vehicle&#x27;s engine to be left running without the keys being in the ignition. This allows adequate power to be supplied to the vehicle&#x27;s equipment at the scene of an incident without battery drain. The vehicle can only be driven after inserting the keys; if the keys are not inserted, the engine will switch off if the handbrake is disengaged or the footbrake is activated.

===Ballistic protection===
Some police cars can be optionally upgraded with bullet-resistant armor in the car doors. The armor is typically made from ceramic ballistic plates and aramid baffles. A 2016 news report said that Ford sells 5 to 10 percent of their American police vehicles with ballistic protection in the doors. In 2017, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that all NYPD patrol cars would have bullet-resistant door panels and bullet-resistant window inserts installed.

<text>Pembina was a provincial electoral division in the Canadian province of Manitoba.

==1878-1879==

The original riding of Pembina was created in 1878, in what was then the southwestern corner of the province. It was eliminated in 1879. The riding&#x27;s sole Member of the Legislative Assembly was John Stevenson, who was elected in opposition to John Norquay&#x27;s government, but supported Norquay&#x27;s short-lived anglophone ministry in 1879.

==1958-2011==

The most recent Pembina constituency was created by redistribution in 1956, and existed from the 1958 provincial election until the 2011 election.

Pembina was located in the southern part of the province. It was bordered to the north by Carman, to the east by Emerson, to the west by Turtle Mountain, and to the south by the American state of North Dakota.

The main communities in the riding were Morden and Winkler.

Pembina&#x27;s population in 1996 was 20,177. In 1999, the average family income was $44,624, and the unemployment rate was 5.00%. Manufacturing accounts for 17% of the riding&#x27;s industry, followed by agriculture at 16%. A quarter of the riding&#x27;s population has less than a Grade Nine education. Twenty-four per cent of the riding&#x27;s residents listed German as their ethnic origin, followed by Mennonites at 9% and Dutch at 8%.

The riding was only held by the Progressive Conservative Party, and was considered extremely safe for that party. The last MLA, Peter George Dyck, was re-elected with over 75% of the vote in 2003, despite his party losing other seats across the province.

Following the 2008 electoral redistribution, Pembina was dissolved into Emerson and the newly created ridings of Midland and Morden-Winkler for the 2011 election.

<text>Vladimir Jovanović (; 28 September 1833 – 3 March 1922) was a Serbian political theorist, economist, politician, philosopher, political and literary writer and activist for the unification of all Serbian lands in the Balkans.

==Biography==

Jovanović was educated at the Universities of Vienna, Berlin in agricultural and economic sciences, and Belgrade, where he stayed at the home of his father&#x27;s relatives, the brothers Dimitrije and Matija Matić. Abroad, he attended the lectures of Karl Heinrich Rau&#x27;s son Ludwig at Hohenhaven Agricultural Academy and Wilhelm Georg Friedrich Roscher in Vienna. In Belgrade, the Matić house was much more than just a place to stay. It was an educational experience for Jovanović in its own right. In Serbia, Matić was а Professor of Economics at Belgrade&#x27;s Grandes écoles, Minister of Finance, President of the Serbian Scientific Society and a corresponding member of the Serbian Royal Academy.

In 1863 he went to Britain in order to raise sympathies in Britain for the efforts of Serbia to liberate herself from the Ottoman Empire. On that occasion, he published an essay &quot;The Serbian Nation and the Eastern Question&quot;. In his travels, through Europe, he met leading political revolutionaries. On the eve of the 1866 war against Austria, Mazzini said to Vladimir Jovanović that Italy should not rely on France in her struggle against the Habsburgs, but on the South Slavs under Vienna&#x27;s yoke. Revolutions were to have started simultaneously in Venice and in the Balkan provinces of Austria; the Magyar revolution which was to follow have brought about the end of the Habsburgs.

He was a liberal thinker propagating emancipation, individual liberty, and education. Jovanović was influenced by John Stuart Mill and the British parliamentary system. Vladimir Jovanović was one of several major founding members of the &quot;Družina mladeži srpske&quot; (Association of Serbian Youth, including Svetozar Miletić, Svetozar Marković, Jevrem Grujić, Milovan Janković, Jovan Ilić, etc. The Youth was among the first organizations to raise the Serbian consciousness in all Serbian lands, then occupied by foreigners, European and Ottoman alike.

His major work is the &quot;Political Dictionary&quot; (1870–1873). His son was Slobodan Jovanović, the leading Serbian interwar historian and jurist.

==Political career==

Jovanović&#x27;s life and political career are inseparable from the history of Serb liberalism. His first important public appearance was at the National Assembly in 1858, when it overthrew the autocratic power of Karađorđević. This was the first time that the liberals had acted as an independent political group. They demanded the restriction of the prince&#x27;s power, the establishment of governmental rule, and the codification of human rights both in the civil and economic spheres. Jovanović was also deeply involved when the liberals first wavered and gave up much of their original program and principles, accepting the autocracy of the Obrenović princes, who were restored to power at the request of the National Assembly. The liberals were convinced that the most effective way of achieving their ultimate goals of liberating the Serb territories from Ottoman and Habsburg oppression and establishing an independent state was to have a prestigious dynasty and a strong, centralized power in the principality.

Vladimir Jovanović drafted a &quot;Political Dictionary&quot; which was basically an encyclopedic summary of liberal ideas. The &quot;Dictionary&quot; was first published in Novi Sad, then under Austro-Hungarian rule, and written to popularize liberal ideas. It was considered the most ambitious and thorough liberal undertaking of the time, becoming &quot;the Bible&quot; for a new generation of liberal thinkers who started their career in the mid-1860s. The most typical characteristics of the so-called &quot;Omladina&quot; generation were that most of them had had a good foreign education (usually in Western Europe and Russia) and were all agreed on the need for the Serbs, who were scattered in four different states, to unite. Jovanović&#x27;s book provided them with the guidelines they needed to accomplish the task.

Unification, development, and Balkan hegemony: these were the most decisive elements of this philosophy. To justify these national aspirations, Jovanović resorted to Western type of liberalism, but wanted to adopt only those elements which were appropriate to their particular situation. Although his liberalism changed significantly over time, his philosophy had always been centered around the concept of nation. The effect of historical developments on his views may be demonstrated by the titles of his writings from different periods of time: &quot;The Base of the Power and Greatness of the Serbs&quot; was published in 1870 in Novi Sad, interpreting Serb history from a liberal point of view. The treatise, &quot;The Struggle for Life in Society between Nations&quot; was published under the aegis of the Serb Scientific Society in Belgrade in 1885, when Jovanović was already a recognized politician and an established political writer.

<doc id="1297402" wikidata="Q255847" url="?curid=1297402" title="No free lunch in search and optimization">
<text>In computational complexity and optimization the no free lunch theorem is a result that states that for certain types of mathematical problems, the computational cost of finding a solution, averaged over all problems in the class, is the same for any solution method. The name alludes to the saying &quot;no such thing as a free lunch&quot;, that is, no method offers a &quot;short cut&quot;. This is under the assumption that the search space is a probability density function. It does not apply to the case where the search space has underlying structure (e.g., is a differentiable function) that can be exploited more efficiently (e.g., Newton&#x27;s method in optimization) than random search or even has closed-form solutions (e.g., the extrema of a quadratic polynomial) that can be determined without search at all. For such probabilistic assumptions, the outputs of all procedures solving a particular type of problem are statistically identical. A colourful way of describing such a circumstance, introduced by David Wolpert and William G. Macready in connection with the problems of search and optimization,
is to say that there is no free lunch. Wolpert had previously derived no free lunch theorems for machine learning (statistical inference). 
Before Wolpert&#x27;s article was published, Cullen Schaffer independently proved a restricted version of one of Wolpert&#x27;s theorems and used it to critique the current state of machine learning research on the problem of induction.

In the &quot;no free lunch&quot; metaphor, each &quot;restaurant&quot; (problem-solving procedure) has a &quot;menu&quot; associating each &quot;lunch plate&quot; (problem) with a &quot;price&quot; (the performance of the procedure in solving the problem). The menus of restaurants are identical except in one regard – the prices are shuffled from one restaurant to the next. For an omnivore who is as likely to order each plate as any other, the average cost of lunch does not depend on the choice of restaurant. But a vegan who goes to lunch regularly with a carnivore who seeks economy might pay a high average cost for lunch. To methodically reduce the average cost, one must use advance knowledge of a) what one will order and b) what the order will cost at various restaurants. That is, improvement of performance in problem-solving hinges on using prior information to match procedures to problems.

In formal terms, there is no free lunch when the probability distribution on problem instances is such that all problem solvers have identically distributed results. In the case of search, a problem instance in this context is a particular objective function, and a result is a sequence of values obtained in evaluation of candidate solutions in the domain of the function. For typical interpretations of results, search is an optimization process. There is no free lunch in search if and only if the distribution on objective functions is invariant under permutation of the space of candidate solutions. This condition does not hold precisely in practice, but an &quot;(almost) no free lunch&quot; theorem suggests that it holds approximately.

==Overview==

Some computational problems are solved by searching for good solutions in a space of candidate solutions. A description of how to repeatedly select candidate solutions for evaluation is called a search algorithm. On a particular problem, different search algorithms may obtain different results, but over all problems, they are indistinguishable. It follows that if an algorithm achieves superior results on some problems, it must pay with inferiority on other problems. In this sense there is no free lunch in search. Alternatively, following Schaffer, search performance is conserved. Usually search is interpreted as optimization, and this leads to the observation that there is no free lunch in optimization.

&quot;The &#x27;no free lunch&#x27; theorem of Wolpert and Macready,&quot; as stated in plain language by Wolpert and Macready themselves, is that &quot;any two algorithms are equivalent when their performance is averaged across all possible problems.&quot; The &quot;no free lunch&quot; results indicate that matching algorithms to problems gives higher average performance than does applying a fixed algorithm to all. Igel and Toussaint and English have established a general condition under which there is no free lunch. While it is physically possible, it does not hold precisely. Droste, Jansen, and Wegener have proved a theorem they interpret as indicating that there is &quot;(almost) no free lunch&quot; in practice.

To make matters more concrete, consider an optimization practitioner confronted with a problem. Given some knowledge of how the problem arose, the practitioner may be able to exploit the knowledge in selection of an algorithm that will perform well in solving the problem. If the practitioner does not understand how to exploit the knowledge, or simply has no knowledge, then he or she faces the question of whether some algorithm generally outperforms others on real-world problems. The authors of the &quot;(almost) no free lunch&quot; theorem say that the answer is essentially no, but admit some reservations as to whether the theorem addresses practice.

==Theorems==

A &quot;problem&quot; is, more formally, an objective function that associates candidate solutions with goodness values. A search algorithm takes an objective function as input and evaluates candidate solutions one-by-one. The output of the algorithm is the sequence of observed goodness values.

Wolpert and Macready stipulate that an algorithm never reevaluates a candidate solution, and that algorithm performance is measured on outputs. For simplicity, we disallow randomness in algorithms. Under these conditions, when a search algorithm is run on every possible input, it generates each possible output exactly once. Because performance is measured on the outputs, the algorithms are indistinguishable in how often they achieve particular levels of performance.

Some measures of performance indicate how well search algorithms do at optimization of the objective function. Indeed, there seems to be no interesting application of search algorithms in the class under consideration but to optimization problems. A common performance measure is the least index of the least value in the output sequence. This is the number of evaluations required to minimize the objective function. For some algorithms, the time required to find the minimum is proportional to the number of evaluations.

The original no free lunch (NFL) theorems assume that all objective functions are equally likely to be input to search algorithms. It has since been established that there is NFL if and only if, loosely speaking, &quot;shuffling&quot; objective functions has no impact on their probabilities. Although this condition for NFL is physically possible, it has been argued that it certainly does not hold precisely.

The obvious interpretation of &quot;not NFL&quot; is &quot;free lunch,&quot; but this is misleading. NFL is a matter of degree, not an all-or-nothing proposition. If the condition for NFL holds approximately, then all algorithms yield approximately the same results over all objective functions. &quot;Not NFL&quot; implies only that algorithms are inequivalent overall by &quot;some&quot; measure of performance. For a performance measure of interest, algorithms may remain equivalent, or nearly so.

===Kolmogorov randomness===

Almost all elements of the set of all possible functions (in the set-theoretic sense of &quot;function&quot;) are Kolmogorov random, and hence the NFL theorems apply to a set of functions almost all of which cannot be expressed more compactly than as a lookup table that contains a distinct (and random) entry for each point in the search space. Functions that can be expressed more compactly (for example, by a mathematical expression of reasonable size) are by definition not Kolmogorov random.

Further, within the set of all possible objective functions, levels of goodness are equally represented among candidate solutions, hence good solutions are scattered throughout the space of candidates. Accordingly, a search algorithm will rarely evaluate more than a small fraction of the candidates before locating a very good solution.

Almost all objective functions are of such high Kolmogorov complexity that they cannot be stored in a particular computer. More precisely, if we model a given physical computer as a register machine with a given size memory on the order of the memories of modern computers, then most objective functions cannot be stored in their memories. There is more information in the typical objective function or algorithm than Seth Lloyd estimates the observable universe is capable of registering. For instance, if each candidate solution is encoded as a sequence of 300 0&#x27;s and 1&#x27;s, and the goodness values are 0 and 1, then most objective functions have Kolmogorov complexity of at least 2300 bits, and this is greater than Lloyd&#x27;s bound of 1090 ≈ 2299 bits. It follows that the original &quot;no free lunch&quot; theorem does not apply to what can be stored in a physical computer; instead the so-called &quot;tightened&quot; no free lunch theorems need to be applied. It has also been shown that NFL results apply to incomputable functions.

==Formal synopsis==

formula_1 is the set of all objective functions &quot;f&quot;:&quot;X&quot;→&quot;Y&quot;, where formula_2 is a finite solution space and formula_3 is a finite poset. The set of all permutations of &quot;X&quot; is &quot;J&quot;. A random variable &quot;F&quot; is distributed on formula_1. For all &quot;j&quot; in &quot;J&quot;, &quot;F&quot; o &quot;j&quot; is a random variable distributed on formula_1, with P(&quot;F&quot; o &quot;j&quot; = &quot;f&quot;) = P(&quot;F&quot; = &quot;f&quot; o &quot;j&quot;−1) for all &quot;f&quot; in formula_1.

Let &quot;a&quot;(&quot;f&quot;) denote the output of search algorithm &quot;a&quot; on input &quot;f&quot;. If &quot;a&quot;(&quot;F&quot;) and &quot;b&quot;(&quot;F&quot;) are identically distributed for all search algorithms &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, then &quot;F&quot; has an &quot;NFL distribution&quot;. This condition holds if and only if &quot;F&quot; and &quot;F&quot; o &quot;j&quot; are identically distributed for all &quot;j&quot; in &quot;J&quot;. In other words, there is no free lunch for search algorithms if and only if the distribution of objective functions is invariant under permutation of the solution space. Set-theoretic NFL theorems have recently been generalized to arbitrary cardinality formula_2 and formula_3.

==Origin==

Wolpert and Macready give two principal NFL theorems, the first regarding objective functions that do not change while search is in progress, and the second regarding objective functions that may change.

:&quot;Theorem 1&quot;: For any pair of algorithms &quot;a&quot;1 and &quot;a&quot;2
::formula_9 where formula_10 denotes the ordered set of size formula_11 of the cost values formula_12 associated to input values formula_13, formula_14 is the function being optimized and formula_15 is the conditional probability of obtaining a given sequence of cost values from algorithm formula_16 run formula_11 times on function formula_18.

In essence, this says that when all functions &quot;f&quot; are equally likely, the probability of observing an arbitrary sequence of &quot;m&quot; values in the course of search does not depend upon the search algorithm.

The second theorem establishes a &quot;more subtle&quot; NFL result for time-varying objective functions.

==Interpretations of results==

A conventional, but not entirely accurate, interpretation of the NFL results is that &quot;a general-purpose universal optimization strategy is theoretically impossible, and the only way one strategy can outperform another is if it is specialized to the specific problem under consideration&quot;. Several comments are in order:

*&quot;A general-purpose almost-universal optimizer exists theoretically.&quot; Each search algorithm performs well on almost all objective functions. So if one is not concerned with the &quot;relatively small&quot; differences between search algorithms, e.g., because computer time is cheap, then you shouldn&#x27;t worry about no free lunch.
*&quot;An algorithm may outperform another on a problem when neither is specialized to the problem.&quot; Indeed, it may be that both algorithms are among the worst for the problem. More generally, Wolpert and Macready have developed a measure of the degree of &quot;alignment&quot; between an algorithm and a distribution over problems (strictly speaking, an inner product). To say that one algorithm matches a distribution better than another is not to say that either has been consciously specialized to the distribution; an algorithm may have good alignment just by luck.
*&quot;In practice, some algorithms reevaluate candidate solutions.&quot; The reason to only consider performance on never-before-evaluated candidates is to make sure that in comparing algorithms one is comparing apples to apples. Moreover, any superiority of an algorithm that never reevaluates candidates over another algorithm that does on a particular problem may have nothing to do with specialization to the problem.
*&quot;For almost all objective functions, specialization is essentially accidental.&quot; Incompressible, or Kolmogorov random, objective functions have no regularity for an algorithm to exploit, as far as the universal Turing machining used to define Kolmogorov randomness is concerned. So presume that there is one, clearly superior choice of universal Turing machine. Then given an objective function that is incompressible for that Turing machine, there is no basis for choosing between two algorithms if both are compressible, as measured using that Turing machine. If a chosen algorithm performs better than most, the result is happenstance. A Kolmogorov random function has no representation smaller than a lookup table that contains a (random) value corresponding to each point in the search space; &quot;any&quot; function that can be expressed more compactly is, by definition, not Kolmogorov random.

In practice, only highly compressible (far from random) objective functions fit in the storage of computers, and it is not the case that each algorithm performs well on almost all compressible functions. There is generally a performance advantage in incorporating prior knowledge of the problem into the algorithm. While the NFL results constitute, in a strict sense, full employment theorems for optimization professionals, it is important to bear the larger context in mind. For one thing, humans often have little prior knowledge to work with. For another, incorporating prior knowledge does not give much of a performance gain on some problems. Finally, human time is very expensive relative to computer time. There are many cases in which a company would choose to optimize a function slowly with an unmodified computer program rather than rapidly with a human-modified program.

The NFL results do not indicate that it is futile to take &quot;pot shots&quot; at problems with unspecialized algorithms. No one has determined the fraction of practical problems for which an algorithm yields good results rapidly. And there is a practical free lunch, not at all in conflict with theory. Running an implementation of an algorithm on a computer costs very little relative to the cost of human time and the benefit of a good solution. If an algorithm succeeds in finding a satisfactory solution in an acceptable amount of time, a small investment has yielded a big payoff. If the algorithm fails, then little is lost.

Recently some philosophers of science have argued that there are ways to circumvent the no free lunch theorems, by using &quot;meta-induction&quot;. Wolpert addresses these arguments in 

==Coevolution==

Wolpert and Macready have proved that there are free lunches in coevolutionary optimization. Their analysis &quot;covers &#x27;self-play&#x27; problems. In these problems, the set of players work together to produce a champion, who then engages one or more antagonists in a subsequent multiplayer game.&quot; That is, the objective is to obtain a good player, but without an objective function. The goodness of each player (candidate solution) is assessed by observing how well it plays against others. An algorithm attempts to use players and their quality of play to obtain better players. The player deemed best of all by the algorithm is the champion. Wolpert and Macready have demonstrated that some coevolutionary algorithms are generally superior to other algorithms in quality of champions obtained. Generating a champion through self-play is of interest in evolutionary computation and game theory. The results are inapplicable to coevolution of biological species, which does not yield champions.

<doc id="1297408" wikidata="Q3256907" url="?curid=1297408" title="Live (Erykah Badu album)">
<text>Live is a live concert album by American singer Erykah Badu, released in 1997. Released in the fall of 1997, with her debut album &quot;Baduizm&quot; released earlier that year, &quot;Live&quot; quickly went double platinum with the radio hit &quot;Tyrone&quot;.

&quot;Live&quot; includes cover versions of songs by Rufus featuring Chaka Khan (&quot;Stay&quot;), Roy Ayers (&quot;Searchin&#x27;&quot;) and a medley of Heatwave&#x27;s &quot;Boogie Nights&quot;, The Mary Jane Girls&#x27; &quot;All Night Long&quot;, and &quot;Funkin&#x27; for Jamaica (N.Y.)&quot; by Tom Browne.

The album was nominated for Best R&amp;B Album at the 1999 Grammy Awards, while the track &quot;Tyrone&quot; was nominated for Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance.

==Background==
After she signed to Universal Records, Badu released her debut studio album &quot;Baduizm&quot;, in early 1997. The album was met with critical and commercial success, debuting at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts and number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums. &quot;Baduizm&quot;″s commercial and critical success helped establish Badu as one of the emerging neo soul genre&#x27;s leading artists. Her particular style of singing drew many comparisons to Billie Holiday. 
&quot;Baduizm&quot; was certified three times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, Gold by the British Phonographic Industry and the Canadian Recording Industry Association.

Badu recorded the live album while pregnant with son Seven, and the release of the recording coincided with his birth.

==Reception==
Upon release &quot;Live&quot; was met with acclaim from music critics. 
Leo Stanley of Allmusic praised Badu&#x27;s decision to release a live album so shortly after releasing her debut. &quot;Not only does it illustrate the depths of Badu&#x27;s talents, but &quot;Live&quot; is as strong and captivating as &quot;Baduizm,&quot; Stanley wrote. A reviewer of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; praised the album&#x27;s jazz influenced sounds, calling the album &quot;sassy&quot; and &quot;relaxed&quot;.

The album was released on November 18, 1997, and reached number four on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200

and number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums. The album was certified two times platinum by RIAA for shipments of over two million copies.

<text>Emerson is a former provincial electoral division in the Canadian province of Manitoba. It was created by redistribution in 1879 and eliminated prior the 2019 general election. Most of its territory was redistributed to the newly created Borderland riding. The eastern part of the former riding was transferred to the La Verendrye riding.

It was located in the southeastern corner of the province. It is bordered to the north by Carman, Morris, Steinbach and La Verendrye, to the west by Pembina, to the east by the province of Ontario and to the south by the American state of North Dakota. The riding included the communities/municipalities of Emerson, Altona, Dominion City, Rhineland, Gretna, Woodridge and St. Jean Baptiste.

The riding&#x27;s population in 2008 was 20,370. In 2011, the average family income was $61,951, and the unemployment rate was 2.9%. Agriculture accounted for 24% of the riding&#x27;s industry, followed by manufacturing at 16%. Over 27% of Emerson&#x27;s residents had less than a Grade Nine education. Emerson was an ethnically diverse riding, with only 51% of its residents listing English as their mother tongue. 26% of the riding&#x27;s residents listed themselves as either German, French, Ukrainian, Polish or Mennonite, while a further 5% were aboriginal.

<text>Adam Davis Hyzdu (; born December 6, 1971) is an American former professional baseball outfielder who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) and Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB). He batted and threw right-handed.

In Major League Baseball, he played for the Pittsburgh Pirates (), Boston Red Sox ( and ), San Diego Padres (2005), and Texas Rangers ().

==Biography==
Hyzdu attended Moeller High School in Cincinnati, where he broke Ken Griffey Jr.&#x27;s home run record (22) and led his team to win the state championship in 1989.

Hyzdu was drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the first round of the 1990 Major League Baseball Draft, but never reached the major leagues as a Giant. Hyzdu is well known for his accomplishments in the minor leagues. During his two seasons with the Altoona Curve, he broke many franchise records, many of which still stand today. He was an Eastern League All-Star both seasons and had his number 16 retired by the club.

Hyzdu was named &quot;NL Player of the Week&quot; the Week for July 15–21, 2002 while playing outfield for the Pittsburgh Pirates. He batted .588 with three homers and a league-leading 11 RBI. In fives games during the week, Hyzdu was 10-for-17, scored six runs, and compiled a slugging percentage of 1.118 and an on-base percentage of .611.

On July 19 versus St. Louis, he hit his first career grand slam. The following day, Hyzdu established career-highs with four hits, including a pair of three-run homers, and seven runs batted in.

In a seven-season major league career, Hyzdu was a .229 hitter with 19 home runs and 61 RBI in 221 games.

With the Red Sox in 2004, Hyzdu batted .300 (3 for 10) with a home run, two RBI, and 2 doubles in 17 games. In 129 games with Pawtucket, he batted .301 with 29 home runs, 79 RBI, and led the team in walks with 84.

After the 2006 season, he joined the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks of the Japanese Pacific League with a one-year contract. He batted .272 with 7 home runs in 47 games. After one season in Japan, he failed to get a contract extension and left the Hawks to be a free agent.

==Personal life==
Hyzdu is married with three children and an active member in his local Christian church, Red Mountain Community Church. His brother Mike Hyzdu played football for Miami University of Ohio from 1985 to 1989 and his brother Marshall Hyzdu played football for Dartmouth College from 1996 to 1999.

<doc id="1297447" wikidata="Q847976" url="?curid=1297447" title="Mama's Gun">
<text>Mama&#x27;s Gun is the second studio album by American singer Erykah Badu. It was recorded between 1999 and 2000 at Electric Lady Studios in New York and released on November 21, 2000, by Motown Records. A neo soul album, &quot;Mama&#x27;s Gun&quot; incorporates elements of funk, soul, and jazz styles. It has confessional lyrics by Badu, which cover themes of insecurity, personal relationships, and social issues. The album has been viewed by critics as a female companion to neo soul artist D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s second album &quot;Voodoo&quot; (2000), which features a similar musical style and direction. Critics have also noted that while Badu&#x27;s first album &quot;Baduizm&quot; contained its share of cryptic lyricism, &quot;Mama&#x27;s Gun&quot; is much more direct in its approach, and places the artist in a subjective position more than its predecessor.

The album contains the single &quot;Bag Lady&quot;, Badu&#x27;s first top 10 &quot;Billboard&quot; hit, which was also nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance and for Best R&amp;B Song. The song &quot;Didn&#x27;t Cha Know?&quot; was also nominated for Best R&amp;B Song. The album features substantial contributions from several members of the Soulquarians outfit, of which Badu was a member. It also features guests such as soul singer Betty Wright and trumpeter Roy Hargrove. &quot;Mama&#x27;s Gun&quot; was met with generally positive reviews from critics. It was less commercially successful than &quot;Baduizm&quot;, receiving Platinum certification in the US. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine named it one of the Top 10 Albums of 2000.

== Background ==
Following Badu signing to Universal Records, she released her debut studio album &quot;Baduizm&quot;, in early 1997. The album was met with critical and commercial success, debuting at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts and number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums. &quot;Baduizm&quot;″s commercial and critical success helped establish Badu as one of the emerging neo soul genre&#x27;s leading artists. Her particular style of singing drew many comparisons to Billie Holiday. 
&quot;Baduizm&quot; was certified three times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, Gold by the British Phonographic Industry and the Canadian Recording Industry Association.

Badu recorded her first live album, while pregnant with Seven, and the release of the recording coincided with his birth.

==Recording==

After the success of &quot;Baduizm&quot; and &quot;Live&quot;, Badu took a short break to tend to her role as a mother to her newborn child, Seven, whom she had with her partner at the time, André Benjamin. She returned to collaborating with Questlove of The Roots. The frequency of their collaborations led to her becoming a member of the Soulquarians - a collective formed of like-minded musicians, singers and rappers including Questlove, D&#x27;Angelo, Jay Dee, and Common (with whom she had previously worked in 1997). Unfortunately, by the time the songs for her follow-up album had begun to materialize, her spousal relationship with Benjamin had already broken down. Badu used the experience as inspiration for several of the songs that she would write, most notably &quot;Green Eyes&quot;. Another event, the murder of Amadou Diallo by New York City Police, serves as the basis for the song &quot;A.D. 2000&quot;.

As with other Soulquarian collaborations, the majority of the album was recorded at Electric Lady, Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s personal recording studio, which was also used to create several landmark albums by David Bowie, Stevie Wonder, and John Lennon. Other studios include Dallas Sound Lab and Palmyra Studios in her hometown of Dallas, TX. The sessions were informal, and took place simultaneously with D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s &quot;Voodoo,&quot; Common&#x27;s &quot;Like Water for Chocolate&quot;, and Bilal&#x27;s &quot;1st Born Second,&quot; resulting in impromptu collaborations and a distinctive sound that can be found among the three albums. Renowned recording engineer, Russell Elevado, who was responsible for the mixing of all four albums, has stated that he used older techniques and vintage mixing gear in order to achieve the warmth found in older recordings. While most current recording techniques involve the use of hi-tech digital equipment, Elevado employed the use of analog equipment including vintage microphones and recording to tape.

==Release and reception==

&quot;Mama&#x27;s Gun&quot; was released by Motown Records on November 21, 2000, and received generally positive reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 80, based on 16 reviews. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s Touré said Badu abandoned the pretensions of &quot;Baduizm&quot; in favor of equally profound but more comprehensible lyrics. In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau wrote that she improved her ability as a composer on &quot;Mama&#x27;s Gun&quot; and also took note of her lyrics: &quot;Maybe her sources are autobiographical, but she’s here to inspire all black-identified women and the men who admire them.&quot; &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;″s Keith Phipps praised her lyrical themes and the album&#x27;s &quot;deceptively simple arrangements, a lovely breakup suite (&#x27;Green Eyes&#x27;), and near-infinite replay value&quot;. &quot;PopMatters&quot; critic Wayne Franklin found the record compelling in its personal scope of Badu&#x27;s psyche, calling it &quot;a definite work of art, destined to remain in heavy rotation for some time to come&quot;.

Although most reviews were favorable, &quot;Mama&#x27;s Gun&quot; was not as successful with consumers and critics as &quot;Baduizm&quot; had been; &quot;Q&quot; wrote that Badu&#x27;s debut had raised expectations she did not meet on &quot;Mama&#x27;s Gun&quot;, while &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said it was plagued by &quot;a reactionary pseudo-sophistication that too often substitutes good taste for good tunes.&quot; According to Badu in an interview a few months after the album&#x27;s release, &quot;it has sold 1.4 million in the US. So no, it didn&#x27;t sell as much ... although creatively I feel like this is a better piece of work.&quot; She felt disappointed at first about its commercial performance, but was encouraged by the response from listeners at her concerts: &quot;When I started to tour again and saw all the people show up who knew the words, it was confirmation that the work is not always for commercial success. It&#x27;s also for spiritual upliftment.&quot;

At the end of 2000, &quot;Mama&#x27;s Gun&quot; was voted the 15th best album of the year in the Pazz &amp; Jop, an annual poll of American critics published by &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. Christgau, the poll&#x27;s supervisor, ranked it ninth best on his own year-end list. &quot;The Times&quot; named it the ninth best record of the year. It was also ranked ninth by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, while Jon Pareles named it the year&#x27;s fifth best album in his list for &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The newspaper&#x27;s Ben Ratliff later said &quot;Mama&#x27;s Gun&quot; and D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s &quot;Voodoo&quot; were &quot;the great neo-soul records of 2000&quot;. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In the 2020 reboot of their list of &#x27;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&#x27;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Mama&#x27;s Gun&quot; at number 158.

<doc id="1297457" wikidata="Q13576850" url="?curid=1297457" title="Money creation">
<text>Money creation, or money issuance, is the process by which the money supply of a country, or an economic or monetary region, is increased. In most modern economies, money is created by both central banks and commercial banks. Money issued by central banks is a liability, typically called reserve deposits, and is only available for use by central bank account holders, which are generally large commercial banks and foreign central banks.

Central banks can increase the quantity of reserve deposits directly, by making loans to account holders, purchasing assets from account holders, or by recording an asset, such as a deferred asset, and directly increasing liabilities. However, the majority of the money supply used by the public for conducting transactions is created by the commercial banking system in the form of commercial bank deposits. Bank loans issued by commercial banks expand the quantity of bank deposits.

Money creation occurs when the amount of loans issued by banks increases relative to the repayment and default of existing loans. Governmental authorities, including central banks and other bank regulators, can use various policies, mainly setting short-term interest rates, to influence the amount of bank deposits commercial banks create.

==Monetary policy==
The monetary authority of a nation—typically its central bank—influences the economy by creating and destroying liabilities on its balance sheet with the intent to change the supply of money available for conducting transactions and generating income. The policy which defines how the central bank changes its ledger to reduce or increase the amount of money in the economy available for banks to conduct transactions is known as monetary policy.

If the central bank is charged with maintaining price or employment levels in the economy by law, monetary policy may include reducing the money supply during times of high inflation in order to increase unemployment, in the hopes that reducing employment also reduces spending on goods and services which exhibit increasing prices. Monetary policy directly impacts the availability and the cost of commercial bank deposits in the economy, which in turn impacts investment, stock prices, private consumption, demand for money, and overall economic activity. The exchange rate of a country&#x27;s currency impacts the value of its net exports.

In most developed countries, central banks conduct their monetary policy within an inflation targeting framework, whereas the monetary policies of most developing countries&#x27; central banks target some kind of a fixed exchange rate system. Central banks operate in practically every nation in the world, with few exceptions. There are also groups of countries for which a single entity acts as their central bank, such as the organization of states of Central Africa, which have a common central bank (the Bank of Central African States); or monetary unions, such as the Eurozone, whereby nations retain their respective central bank yet submit to the policies of a central entity, the European Central Bank.

Central banks conduct monetary policy by setting a rate of interest paid on central bank deposit liabilities, directly purchasing or selling assets in order to change the amount of deposits on their balance sheet, or by signaling to the market through speeches and written guidance an intent to change the rate of interest on deposits or purchase or sell assets in the future.

Lowering interest rates by reducing the amount of interest paid on central bank liabilities or purchasing assets like bank loans and government bonds for higher prices (resulting in an increase in bank reserve deposits on the central bank ledger) is called monetary expansion or monetary easing, whereas raising rates by paying more interest on central bank liabilities is known as monetary contraction or tightening (resulting in a decrease of bank reserve deposits on the central bank ledger). An extraordinary process of monetary easing (keeping rates low) is denoted as quantitative easing, which involves the central bank purchasing large amounts of assets for high prices over an extended period of time.

===Money supply===


The term &quot;money supply&quot; commonly denotes the total, safe, financial assets that households and businesses can use to make payments or to hold as short-term investment. The money supply is measured using the so-called &quot;monetary aggregates&quot;, defined based on their respective level of liquidity. In the United States, for example:

* M0: The total of all physical currency including coinage. Using the United States dollar as an example, M0 = Federal Reserve notes + US notes + coins. It is not relevant whether the currency is held inside or outside of the private banking system as reserves.
* M1: The total amount of M0 (cash/coin) outside of the private banking system plus the amount of demand deposits, travelers checks and other checkable deposits
* M2: M1 + most savings accounts, money market accounts, retail money market mutual funds, and small denomination time deposits (certificates of deposit of under $100,000).

In most countries the central bank, treasury, or other designated state authority is empowered to mint new physical currency, usually taking the form of metal coinage or paper banknotes. While the value of major currencies was once backed by the gold standard, the end of the Bretton Woods system in 1971 led to all major currencies becoming fiat money — backed by a mutual agreement of value rather than a commodity.

Various measures are taken to prevent counterfeiting, including the use of serial numbers on banknotes and the minting of coinage using an alloy at or above its face value. Currency may be demonetized for a variety of reasons, including loss of value over time due to inflation, redenomination of its face value due to hyperinflation, or its replacement as legal tender by another currency. The currency-issuing government agency typically work with commercial banks to distribute freshly-minted currency and retrieve worn currency for destruction, enabling the reuse of serial numbers on new banknotes.

In modern economies, physical currency consists only of a fraction of the broad money supply. In the United Kingdom, gross bank deposits outweigh the physical currency issued by the central bank by a factor of more than 30 to 1. The United States, with a currency used substantially in legal and illicit international transactions, has a lower ratio of 8 to 1.

=== Debt monetization ===
Debt monetization is a term used to describe central bank money creation for use by government fiscal authorities, like the U.S. Treasury. In many states, such as Great Britain, all government spending is always financed by central bank money creation. Debt monetization as a concept is often based on a misunderstanding of modern financial systems compared to fixed exchange rate systems like the gold standard.

Historically, in a fixed exchanged rate financial system, central bank money creation directly for government spending by the fiscal authority was prohibited by law in many countries. However, in modern financial systems central banks and fiscal authorities work closely together to manage interest rates and economic stability. This involves the creation and destruction of deposits on the central bank ledger to ensure transactions can settle such that short term interest rates don&#x27;t exceed specified targets.

In the Eurozone, Article 123 of the Lisbon Treaty explicitly prohibits the European Central Bank from financing public institutions and state governments. In Japan, the nation&#x27;s central bank &quot;routinely&quot; purchases approximately 70% of state debt issued each month, and owns, as of Oct 2018, approximately 440 trillion JP¥ (approx. $4trillion) or over 40% of all outstanding government bonds.

In the United States, the 1913 Federal Reserve Act allowed federal banks to purchase short-term securities directly from the Treasury, in order to facilitate its cash-management operations. The Banking Act of 1935 prohibited the central bank from directly purchasing Treasury securities, and permitted their purchase and sale only &quot;in the open market&quot;. In 1942, during wartime, Congress amended the Banking Act&#x27;s provisions to allow purchases of government debt by the federal banks, with the total amount they&#x27;d hold &quot;not [to] exceed $5 billion&quot;. After the war, the exemption was renewed, with time limitations, until it was allowed to expire in June 1981. Today, primary dealers in the United States are required to purchase all Treasuries at auction, and the U.S. central bank will create any quantity of reserve deposits necessary to settle the auction transaction.

=== Open market operations ===
Central banks can purchase or sell assets in the market, which is referred to as open market operations. When a central bank purchases assets from market participants, such as commercial banks who hold an account at the central bank, reserve deposits are deleted from their account and asset ownership is transferred to the commercial bank. In this way the central bank can modulate the amount of reserve deposits in the financial system, by exchanging financial assets like bonds for reserve deposits. For example, in the United States, when the Federal Reserve permanently purchases a security, the office responsible for implementing purchases and sales (The New York Fed&#x27;s Open Market Trading Desk) buys eligible securities from primary dealers at prices determined in a competitive auction. The Federal Reserve pays for those securities by crediting the reserve accounts of the correspondent banks of the primary dealers. (The correspondent banks, in turn, credit the dealers’ bank accounts.) In this way, the open market purchase leads to an increase in reserve balances.

Conversely, sales of assets by the US central bank reduces reserve balances, which reduces the amount of money available in the financial system for settling transactions between member banks. Central banks also engage in short term contracts to &#x27;sell-assets-now, repurchase-later&#x27; to manage short term reserve deposit balances. These contracts, known as Repo (Repurchase) contracts, are short term (often overnight) contracts that are continually rolled over until some desired result in the financial system is achieved. Operations conducted by central banks can either address short-term goals on its agenda or long-term factors such as maintaining financial stability or maintaining a floor and/or ceiling around a targeted interest rate for reserve deposits.

=== Money multiplier ===
Historical explanations of money creation often focused on the concept of a money multiplier, where reserve deposits or an underlying commodity such as gold were multiplied by bank lending of those deposits or gold balances to a maximum limit defined by the reserve requirement for money lenders. Thus the total money supply was a function of the reserve requirement. Many states today, however, have no reserve requirement. The money multiplier has thus largely been abandoned as an explanatory tool for the money creation process.

When commercial banks lend money today, they expand the amount of bank deposits in the economy. The banking system can expand the money supply of a country far beyond the amount of reserve deposits created by the central bank, meaning contrary to popular belief, most money is not created by central banks. Some argue that banks are limited in the total amount they can lend by their capital adequacy ratios and, in countries that impose required reserve ratios, by required reserves.

Bank capital, used for calculating the capital adequacy ratio, is assets on the bank balance sheet in excess of liabilities, with values further refined by regulation such as the international regulatory framework for banks, Basel III. Banks create capital by creating loans (assets) and destroying bank liabilities, which occurs when loans are repaid. This process increases bank equity, enabling banks to create commercial bank deposit liabilities (money) for their own use. In this way, banks create and manage their own capital levels. Because accounting conventions define the value of any given asset or liability, bank capital is a subjective measure which many argue is open to manipulation and may be a poor method for regulating money creation.

Reserve requirements oblige commercial banks to keep a minimum, predetermined, percentage of their deposits at an account at the central bank. Countries with no reserve requirement include the United States, Great Britain, Australia, Canada and New Zealand, which means no minimum reserve requirement is imposed on banks. The constraining factor on bank lending recognized today is largely the number of available borrowers willing to create loan contracts.

==Degree of control==
Whereas central banks can directly control the issuance of physical currency, the question to what extent they can control broad monetary aggregates like M2 by also indirectly controlling the money creation of commercial banks is more controversial. According to the money multiplier theory, which is often cited in macroeconomics textbooks, the central bank controls the money multiplier because it can impose reserve requirements, and consequently via this mechanism also governs the amount of money created by commercial banks. Most central banks in developed countries, however, have ceased to rely on this theory and stopped shaping their monetary policy through required reserves.

Benjamin Friedman explains in his chapter on the money supply in &quot;The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics&quot; that the money multiplier representation is a short-hand simplification of a more complex equilibrium of supply and demand in the markets for both reserves (outside money) and inside money. Friedman adds that the simplification will work well or badly &quot;depending on the strength of the relevant interest elasticities and the extent of variation in interest rates and the many other factors involved&quot;. David Romer notes in his graduate textbook &quot;Advanced Macroeconomics&quot; that it is difficult for central banks to control broad monetary aggregates like M2.

Monetarist theory, which was prominent during the 1970s and 1980s, argued that the central bank should concentrate on controlling the money supply through its monetary operations. The strategy did not work well for the central banks like the Federal Reserve who tried it, however, and it was abandoned after some years, central banks turning to steer interest rates to obtain their monetary policy goals rather than holding the quantity of base money fixed in order to steer money growth. Interest rates influence commercial bank issuance of credit indirectly, so the ceiling implied by the money multiplier does not impose a limit on money creation in practice. By setting interest rates, central-bank operations will affect, but not control the money supply.

== Credit theory of money ==
The fractional reserve theory of money creation where the money supply is limited by the money multiplier has been abandoned since the financial crisis of 2007–2008. It has been observed that bank reserves are not a limiting factor because the central banks supply more reserves than necessary (excess reserves). Economists and bankers now understand that the amount of money in circulation is limited only by the demand for loans.

The credit theory of money, initiated by Joseph Schumpeter, asserts the central role of banks as creators and allocators of the money supply, and distinguishes between &quot;productive credit creation&quot; (allowing non-inflationary economic growth even at full employment, in the presence of technological progress) and &quot;unproductive credit creation&quot; (resulting in inflation of either the consumer- or asset-price variety).

The model of bank lending stimulated through central-bank operations (such as &quot;monetary easing&quot;) has been rejected by Neo-Keynesian and Post-Keynesian analysis as well as central banks.
The major argument offered by dissident analysis is that any bank balance-sheet expansion (e.g. through a new loan) that leaves the bank short of the required reserves may affect the return it can expect on the loan, because of the extra cost the bank will undertake to return within the ratios limits – but this does not and &quot;will never impede the bank&#x27;s capacity to give the loan in the first place&quot;. Banks first lend and &quot;then&quot; cover their reserve ratios: The decision whether or not to lend is generally independent of their reserves with the central bank or their deposits from customers; banks are not lending out deposits or reserves, anyway. Banks lend on the basis of lending criteria, such as the status of the customer&#x27;s business, the loan&#x27;s prospects, and/or the overall economic situation.

<text>César Milstein, CH, FRS (8 October 1927 – 24 March 2002) was an Argentine biochemist in the field of antibody research. Milstein shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1984 with Niels Kaj Jerne and Georges J. F. Köhler for developing the hybridoma technique for the production of monoclonal antibodies.

==Biography==
Milstein was born in Bahía Blanca, Argentina. His parents were Máxima (Vanarks) and Lázaro Milstein, a Jewish Ukrainian immigrant. He graduated from the University of Buenos Aires and obtained a PhD under Professor Stopani (Professor of Biochemistry). Later he became a member of the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, England; he acquired British citizenship and had dual British-Argentinian nationality. In 1956, he received an award from the Sociedad Argentina de Investigation eon Bio Quimica (SAIB) for his work on enzyme kinetics with the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase. In 1958, funded by the British Council, he joined the Biochemistry Department at the University of Cambridge to work for a PhD under Malcolm Dixon on the mechanism of metal activation of the enzyme phosphoglucomutase. During this work, he collaborated with Frederick Sanger, whose group he joined with a short-term Medical Research Council appointment.

==Career==

The major part of Milstein&#x27;s research career was devoted to studying the structure of antibodies and the mechanism by which antibody diversity is generated. It was as part of this quest that, in 1975, he worked with Georges Köhler (a postdoctoral fellow in his laboratory) to develop the hybridoma technique for the production of monoclonal antibodies—a discovery recognized by the award of the 1984 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. This discovery led to an enormous expansion in the exploitation of antibodies in science and medicine. The term hybridoma was coined by Leonard Herzenberg during his sabbatical in Milstein&#x27;s laboratory between 1976 and 1977.

Milstein himself made many major contributions to improvements and developments in monoclonal antibody technology—especially in the use of monoclonal antibodies to provide markers that allow distinction between different cell types. In collaboration with Claudio Cuello, he helped lay the foundation for the use of monoclonal antibodies as probes for the investigation of the pathological pathways in neurological disorders as well as many other diseases. These advances in biology and clinical medicine would take several years to realize their potential. Milstein and Cuello&#x27;s work also enabled the use of monoclonal antibodies to enhance the power of immuno-based diagnostic tests. In addition, Milstein foresaw the potential wealth of ligand-binding reagents that could result from applying recombinant DNA technology to monoclonal antibodies and inspired the development of the field of antibody engineering, which was to lead to safer and more powerful monoclonal antibodies for use as therapeutics.

Milstein&#x27;s early work on antibodies focused on their diversity at the amino acid level, as well as on the disulfide bonds by which they were held together. Part of this work was done in collaboration with his wife, Celia. The emphasis of his research then shifted towards the mRNA encoding antibodies, where he was able to provide the first evidence for the existence of a precursor for these secreted polypeptides that contained a signal sequence. The development of the hybridoma technology coupled to advances in nucleic acid sequencing allowed Milstein to chart the changes that occurred in antibodies following antigen encounter. He demonstrated the importance of somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin V genes in antibody affinity maturation. In this process, localized mutation of the immunoglobulin genes allows the production of improved antibodies, which make a major contribution to protective immunity and immunological memory. Much of his work in later years was devoted to characterizing this mutational process with a view to understanding its mechanism. He contributed a manuscript for publication on this topic less than a week before he died.

Quite apart from his own achievements, Milstein acted as a guide and inspiration to many in the antibody field, as well as devoting himself to assisting science and scientists in less developed countries. Milstein patented the production of monoclonal antibodies, and held three other patents.

==Awards and honours==
In addition to the Nobel Prize in 1984, Milstein was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1975, was a fellow of Darwin College, Cambridge, from 1980 to 2002, awarded the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University in 1980, he was awarded the Wolf Prize in Medicine in 1980, he won the Copley Medal in 1989, and became a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in 1995. In 1993, the Argentinian Konex Foundation granted him the Diamond Konex Award, one of the most prestigious cultural awards of Argentina, as the most important scientist in the last decade of his country.

==Personal life==
Milstein married Celia Prilleltensky in 1953.

Milstein died early on 24 March 2002, in Cambridge, England, at age 74, as a result of a heart condition that he had suffered from for many years. His wife died in 2020 aged 92.

The film &quot;Un fueguito, la historia de César Milstein&quot; was released in 2010. Directed by Ana Fraile, the film was awarded Best Documentary by the Academy of Film in Argentina.

<text>Interstate 384 (I-384) is an auxiliary Interstate Highway located entirely within the state of Connecticut. It runs east to west, from I-84 in East Hartford to US 6/US 44 in Bolton.

==Route description==

I-384 officially begins at I-84 eastbound exit 59 at the East Hartford–Manchester town line, as the right two lanes of traffic split from the I-84 mainline. The highway can also be accessed from the I-84 eastbound high-occupancy vehicle lane (HOV lane), and westbound I-384 traffic can also access the HOV lane on westbound I-84. Westbound I-84 access to I-384 is provided through a complex interchange that also provides access from Pleasant Valley Road near The Shoppes at Buckland Hills and from I-291. I-384&#x27;s first exit is for Spencer Street. The eastbound ramp is on the I-384 mainline, while the westbound ramp comes from a split in the I-84 interchange ramp. Just east of the Spencer Street overpass, the ramp from westbound I-84 joins the I-384 mainline and the HOV lane becomes a conventional lane. I-384 continues along the southern part of Manchester. It has one interchange before it intersects Route 83, which provides access to Manchester Center. After one more interchange in Manchester, it crosses into Bolton, where it has a partial interchange with Route 85. Shortly after the interchange, I-384 ends as it meets the US 6/US 44 concurrency just west of its eastern split at Bolton Notch. 

The highway is eight lanes wide west of Route 83, six lanes wide to Route 85, and four lanes wide for the rest of the highway&#x27;s duration.

==Special designations==
Since May 31, 1996, the segment of I-384 &quot;running from the junction of Interstate Route 84 in Manchester in a general easterly direction to Route 6 in Bolton&quot; has been officially known as the State Trooper Russell A. Bagshaw Highway, in memory of a Connecticut State Police trooper who was killed in the line of duty in 1991.

==History==

Prior to 1984, I-384 was designated I-84. During that time, current I-84 east of the East Hartford junction was I-86. Originally, the freeway was supposed to end in Johnston, Rhode Island, at the I-95/I-195 connector (now the Route 6-10 Connector). The freeway was built to Bolton where it abruptly ends at the intersection with US 6 and US 44. A segment from Columbia to Windham was also built, forming the present-day US 6 bypass around Willimantic, and would have connected to the Connecticut Turnpike at what is now I-395 exit 35, following the last few miles of the turnpike into Rhode Island.

Crossing into Rhode Island, the proposed I-84 freeway was to parallel US 6 to I-295, where it would have tied into the existing US 6/Rhode Island Route 10 freeway. In 1982, Rhode Island canceled their plans because of community backlash and possible impacts to the Scituate Reservoir. In 1986, Connecticut canceled their plans and changed I-86 back to I-84 and I-84 was renumbered I-384. Even after cancelling I-84, various proposals were made to complete the highway between Bolton and the Willimantic bypass or between the bypass and I-395.

==Future==
For more than 30 years since the cancelation of the Hartford–Providence leg of I-84, elected officials in Connecticut proposed to extend I-384 from Bolton to Willimantic along the US 6 corridor, connecting the existing I-384 with the US 6 Windham Bypass, which would have likely included an extension of the I-384 designation to include the new freeway and the Windham Bypass. The corresponding stretch of US 6 is known as &quot;Suicide 6&quot; because of sharp turns and intersections had been the site of numerous fatal accidents and was the main reason supporting construction of the bypass. It is unlikely the freeway between I-384 and the Windham Bypass will ever be built because of irresolvable disagreements over the routing of the freeway: state and local officials prefer more northerly alignment that minimizes disruption to developed areas along US 6, while federal officials insist on a more southerly alignment that minimizes environmental impacts to the Hop River ecosystem. After studying more than 200 potential alignments with no agreement among stakeholders, the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) abandoned further study of the US 6 freeway in 2005 and instead focused on completing safety upgrades on the existing US 6 corridor between Bolton and Willimantic to reduce congestion and accidents.

A proposed extension of the CTfastrak bus rapid transit line would run in the HOV lanes in I-84 and I-384.

<text>Morris is a former provincial electoral division in the Canadian province of Manitoba. It was created by redistribution in 1879 and named after the town and municipality of Morris, which in turn are named after Alexander Morris, who served as Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba from 1872 to 1877.

Following the redistribution of Manitoba electoral districts in 2011, the riding was bordered to the south by Emerson, to the north by Lakeside, to the west by Midland and Portage la Prairie, and to the east by Steinbach, Dawson Trail, Assiniboia, Kirkfield Park and Charleswood.

The largest communities in the riding were Morris, Niverville, and La Salle. Other communities included Elie, Oak Bluff, Sanford, Starbuck, Ste. Agathe, St. Eustache and St. Francois Xavier.

In 1999, the average family income was $53,719, and the unemployment rate was 3.90%. Agriculture accounted for 23% of the riding&#x27;s industry, followed by the retail trade at 10%. Eighteen per cent of Morris&#x27;s residents were of German background, and a further 17% were French. The riding had the third-highest percentage of Francophones in Manitoba.

The Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba represented Morris from 1954 to 2019, and the riding was generally regarded as safe for the party.

The Morris riding was eliminated ahead of the 2019 Manitoba general election and its territory was redistributed to the Midland, La Verendrye, and newly-formed Springfield-Ritchot ridings.

<text>HDC YoungChang (Hangul: HDC영창) is a South Korean manufacturer of pianos and industrial wood working machinery, headquartered in Incheon, South Korea. Young Chang currently holds 50% of the South Korean piano market. The company is among the largest and most automated of the world&#x27;s piano manufacturers.

== Operations ==
Young Chang had four manufacturing facilities as of 1999, three producing pianos and the fourth a sawmill producing wood for export from the United States. The sawmill was located in Tacoma, Washington and was established in 1991. Piano manufacturing took place in plants in Seoul and Incheon, South Korea, both established in 1964, and Tianjin, China, established in 1995. The company also maintained a research and development facility in Waltham, Massachusetts. The company&#x27;s Tianjin manufacturing site is run through subsidiary &quot;Tianjin Young Chang Akki Company, Limited&quot;, while the Tacoma sawmill is managed through subsidiary &quot;Young Chang America Timber, Incorporated&quot;.

As of the late 1990s, Young Chang, at the time known as &quot;Young Chang Akki Company,&quot; was among the largest of the world&#x27;s manufacturers of pianos, alongside Samick, Yamaha and Kawai, and one of five multinationals producing pianos. Young Chang reported sales in the United States, China, Canada, Korea and the European Union under its own brand.

The company also produces pianos for other companies. For instance, it began producing Cline pianos for &quot;Cline Piano Company&quot; of Belmont, California in 1992; and began producing Knabe pianos for &quot;Music Systems Research&quot; of Sacaramento, California in the late 1990s. Young Chang produced pianos for Nakamichi of Hamamatsu, Japan until 1998; the units were modified by Nakamichi before export to the United States. The company had at one time produced Wurlitzer pianos for United States-distribution by &quot;Baldwin Piano &amp; Organ&quot;, but this relationship was terminated prior to the late 1990s.

The company also markets under an alternative brand, Weber, held by subsidiary Weber Piano Company established in 1986. This brand was established specifically for English-speaking markets where a Korean brand name, as opposed to a German or American name, might be a disincentive to purchase.

==History==
Young Chang was founded in 1956 as a distributor of Yamaha pianos for Korea and other parts of Asia. The company was founded by three brothers, Jai-Young Kim, Jai-Chang Kim and Jai-Sup Kim, as South Korea emerged as a major economy and producer of high quality goods. The first Young Chang factory was built in Seoul in 1964.

During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Young Chang manufactured Squier electric guitars and basses for Fender Musical Instruments Corporation, and also manufactured acoustic, acoustic/electric, electric guitars and basses under their own &quot;Fenix&quot; brand. However, because of the similarities to the Fender brand and instruments, Young Chang could not sell the Fenix instruments due to licensing issues with Fender, and production stopped.In addition to guitars and pianos (vertical and grand varieties), Young Chang produced in the late 1990s harmonicas, reed organs and industrial woodworking machinery.

In 1986, the company established Weber Piano Company, which sells pianos under the Weber brand name, which it had purchased rights to use after the demise of the Aeolian Piano Company in 1985. Young Chang subsequently sold this subsidiary to Samsung America in 1987.

From 1987-1988 Young Chang manufactured and supplied electric guitars to U.S musical instrument chain store Samuel Music Company. These were sold under Samuel Music&#x27;s house brand &quot;Vester&quot;. The guitars were imported into the United States by Midco Music (now Musicorp.) After 1988 Samuel Music used other Korean musical instrument factories to build acoustic and electric guitars. 

In 1988, Young Chang established a foundry for production of piano plates in Tianjin, China, to supplement production of this key component, also produced in Korea. The success of this facility was one factor leading to the 1995 establishment of a piano manufacturing facility in Tianjin.

In 1990, Young Chang purchased Kurzweil Music Systems, a maker of high end electronic and digital musical instruments.

In 1991, Young Chang invested to establish a subsidiary in Tacoma, Washington, &quot;Young Chang (America) Timber&quot;, to cut and process North American spruce and maple for export to its Asian manufacturing sites.

In 1995, Young Chang opened a new factory in Tianjin. The Chinese facility allowed Young Chang to start serving the low-end markets, part of a long-term strategy involving shifting production from Korea to China. The quality of pianos produced by this new plant was initially high, but dropped sharply after technicians who had helped set up the production returned to Korea, which had a significant impact on their ability to complete sales.

Joseph Pramberger, a former vice president from Steinway &amp; Sons (head of manufacturing) and an experienced piano designer, joined the company in 1995. Pramberger brought many innovations to piano design, including the &quot;Platinum Touch Action&quot; and the patented asymmetrically tapered soundboard. The &quot;Pramberger Platinum&quot; series, introduced in 2001, was Young Chang&#x27;s top-of-the-line for three years. These models incorporated some German materials including Renner action parts. Joseph Pramberger died in 2003, and the following year, his estate sold the Pramberger name to Samick, but his patents and innovations are still exclusive to Young Chang.

The year following the opening of the Tianjin, China factory, in October 1996, Young Chang entered into bankruptcy, emerging in August 1998. Young Chang has more than 2,000 full-time workers, designing and building its upright and grand pianos, and also the electronic Kurzweil Music Systems.

In 2004, Samick Musical Instrument Co. acquired a 48.13% stake in Young Chang, gained a controlling interest through a capital increase, and took control over management of the company. However, the Korea Fair Trade Commission blocked the acquisition as it would create a monopoly and ordered Samick to dispose of its shares in Young Chang. Following the Fair Trade Commission&#x27;s decision, Young Chang went bankrupt on September 21, 2004.
Hyundai Development Company acquired Young Chang in 2006. The company was renamed to HDC Young Chang in 2018.

<doc id="1297472" wikidata="Q916645" url="?curid=1297472" title="Vera Drake">
<text>Vera Drake is a 2004 British period drama film written and directed by Mike Leigh and starring Imelda Staunton, Phil Davis, Daniel Mays and Eddie Marsan. It tells the story of a working-class woman in London in 1950 who performs illegal abortions. It won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival and it was nominated for three Academy Awards and won three BAFTAs.

==Plot==
Vera Drake is devoted to her family, looking after her husband and children, her elderly mother, and a sick neighbour. Her shy daughter, Ethel, works in a lightbulb factory, and her son, Sid, tailors men&#x27;s suits. Her husband, Stanley, is a car mechanic. Although Vera and her family are poor, their strong family bonds hold them together. During her working day as a house cleaner, Vera performs constant small acts of kindness for the many people she encounters.

She is a kindly person who is eager to help others. Unknown to her family, she also works secretly, providing abortions for young women. She receives no money for providing this service because she believes that her help is an act of charity to women in trouble. However, her partner Lily, who also carries on a black-market trade in scarce postwar foodstuffs, charges two guineas (two pounds and two shillings: ) for arranging the abortions, without Vera&#x27;s knowledge.

The film also contains a subplot about an upper-class young woman, Susan, the daughter of one of Vera&#x27;s employers. Susan is raped by a suitor, becomes pregnant, and asks a friend to put her in contact with a doctor, through whom she can obtain an abortion. The doctor refers her to a psychiatrist, who prompts her to answer questions in a certain way, so that he can legally recommend an abortion on therapeutic psychiatric grounds: that she has a family history of mental illness and that she may commit suicide if not allowed to terminate the pregnancy. The procedure costs her a hundred guineas.

Vera performs an abortion for a young woman named Pamela whose mother recognizes Vera. After Pamela nearly dies, her mother is pressured into informing the police, and Vera is arrested and taken into custody for questioning. She is held overnight and appears before a magistrate the next morning. Sid is shocked by his mother&#x27;s secret activities and tells his father that he does not think that he can forgive her. However, in a later conversation with Vera, he expresses fear for what could happen to her in prison, before finally telling Vera that he loves her.

Vera is bailed to appear at the Old Bailey. None of Vera&#x27;s employers will give her a character reference. Her solicitor thinks she will receive the minimum sentence of 18 months in jail; the judge sentences her to two-and-a-half years&#x27; imprisonment &quot;as a deterrent to others.&quot; This affects all the people who previously depended on Vera&#x27;s kindness.

While in prison, Vera meets others who have been convicted of performing illegal abortions. They discuss their sentences, explaining that it&#x27;s not their first time in prison for performing illegal abortions, and that she&#x27;ll probably only serve half her sentence. Vera tearfully leaves to go to her cell.

==Main cast==
==Background==
In &quot;Vera Drake&quot;, Leigh incorporated elements of his own childhood. He grew up in north Salford, Lancashire, and experienced a very ordinary but socio-economically mixed life as the son of a doctor and a midwife. In the book &quot;The Cinema of Mike Leigh: A Sense of the Real&quot;, Leigh said, &quot;I lived in this particular kind of working-class district with some relations living in slightly leafier districts up the road. So there was always a tension, or at least a duality: those two worlds were forever colliding. So you constantly get the one world and its relationship with the other going on in my films.&quot;

==Production==
Mike Leigh is known to use unusual methods to achieve realism in his films. &quot;Leigh&#x27;s actors literally have to find their characters through improvisation and research the ways people in specific communities speak and behave. Leigh and his cast immerse themselves in the local life before creating the story&quot; (1994: 7: Watson 29). Critic Roger Ebert explains:

Leigh often uses improvisation to capture his actors&#x27; unscripted emotions. When filming &quot;Vera Drake&quot;, only Imelda Staunton knew ahead of time that the subject of the film was abortion. None of the cast members playing the family members, including Staunton, knew that Vera was to be arrested until the moment the actors playing the police knocked on the door of the house they were using for rehearsals. Their genuine reactions of shock and confusion provided the raw material for their dialogue and actions.

In addition to these methods utilised by Mike Leigh, the director is also admired for his preference of English actors to Hollywood stars. This has led to criticism of Leigh as being a patroniser of the working class. However, using Dickens in his defence, he rebuts these accusations outright proclaiming that the last thing he seeks in his actors is a stereotype. This stereotype was fiercely criticised in the film, &quot;Vera Drake&quot;:
These abiding quibbles aside, Vera Drake is a compelling and complex film. Though much has been made of the controversial subject matter—back street abortion—its main theme is the buried family secret, the ticking time bomb that can lurk underneath even the most stable marriage. Much of the film&#x27;s cumulative power lies in its delineation of a rock solid family suddenly rocked to the core by a revelation that is literally beyond their comprehension: the fact that their beloved, and loving, mother is an abortionist. Why, I ask Leigh, does she keep her secret for so long?Leigh wanted to shoot in 35mm but, after being denied by the producers, the film was shot on 16mm film stock.

==Reception==

=== Box office ===
As of 9 April 2006, &quot;Vera Drake&quot; had grossed $12,941,817 at the box office worldwide, including over $3.7 million in the US.

=== Critical response ===
The website Metacritic, which compiles and averages reviews from leading film critics, gave it a score of 83 out of 100 from 40 reviews. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 93% based on 161 reviews, with a rating average of 7.9/10. The site&#x27;s consensus is that &quot;with a piercingly powerful performance by Imelda Staunton, &quot;Vera Drake&quot; brings teeming humanity to the controversial subject of abortion.&quot;

The film has attracted some criticism from those who worked in midwifery during the 1950s. The chief concern is the method of abortion used by Vera Drake in the film. This involves using a Higginson bulb, which is a type of enema syringe, to introduce a warm, dilute solution of carbolic soap and an unspecified liquid disinfectant into the woman&#x27;s uterus. This method is claimed by Jennifer Worth, a nurse and midwife in the 1950s and 1960s and author of the book &quot;Call the Midwife&quot;, to be invariably fatal. She called the film itself &quot;dangerous&quot;, as it could be shown in countries where abortion is illegal and the method depicted copied by desperate women. In reply Leigh told interviewer Amy Raphael that Worth&#x27;s criticism overlooked several factors, such as how the film undoubtedly highlights the risk of infection by exploring such misadventure as a means to ultimately curtail Drake&#x27;s work and the fact that it was based on many testimonies from women who once had such abortions, thereby proving that the procedure did not &quot;almost always&quot; result in death.

<doc id="1297474" wikidata="Q545287" url="?curid=1297474" title="Worldwide Underground">
<text>Worldwide Underground is the third studio album by American singer Erykah Badu, released September 16, 2003, by Motown Records. Recording sessions for the album took place during 2003, following Badu&#x27;s period of writer&#x27;s block, and her performances during the &quot;Frustrated Artist Tour&quot;. Production was handled primarily by the production group Freakquency, consisting of Badu, Rashad Smith, James Poyser, and RC Williams. Prominently influenced by old-school 1970s and 80s hip hop, soul, R&amp;B and funk elements, the album features an unconventional musical structure; the songwriting took a path of somewhat less subliminal, metaphorical lyrics than Badu’s previous work, expressing more lighthearted (but sincere) feelings, instead. The album’s content mainly focused on the general state of hip hop culture, reminiscing on good times, friends, partying, young love, “hood life”, and some references to gang culture. The album features appearances from artists Dead Prez, Common, Queen Latifah, Bahamadia, and singer Angie Stone.

The album debuted at number three on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, selling 143,561 copies in its first week. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America, and produced three singles that achieved moderate chart success, while the album was underpromoted and sold less than her previous albums. Upon its release, &quot;Worldwide Underground&quot; received generally lukewarm reviews from critics. The album has sold 609,000 copies in the United States.

==Background==
After taking some time off to raise her child, Badu returned in 2000 with &quot;Mama&#x27;s Gun.&quot; The album was characterized as more organic in sound than her previous studio album, and primarily produced by the Soulquarians and noted bassist Pino Palladino. A remix of one of the album&#x27;s songs, &quot;Bag Lady&quot;, was issued as the first single and topped the R&amp;B charts for seven weeks. The album was well-received, with the lyrical content winning notices from many publications. Reviewers found some of her lyrics hard to decipher on her initial releases. Despite not charting as high as her first two albums, &quot;Mama&#x27;s Gun&quot; was another platinum-selling success, and &quot;Bag Lady&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award.
In 2001 Badu embarked on the &quot;Mama&#x27;s Gun World Tour&quot;. The tour started in North America on February 10 in Cleveland, Ohio at the Allen Theatre. Badu will perform two nights in Washington, D.C. and Chicago.
After the release of &quot;Mama&#x27;s Gun&quot; and &quot;Love of My Life&quot;, Badu suffered writer&#x27;s block.

==Release and reception==

&quot;Worldwide Underground&quot; was released on September 16, 2003, by Motown Records. It debuted at number three on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart in the week of October 4, selling 143,561 copies in its first week. Ultimately spending 11 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, it also entered at number two on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums and spent 30 weeks on the chart. By December 2003, the album had sold 394,000 copies domestically. Its first single, &quot;Love of My Life (An Ode to Hip Hop)&quot;, peaked at number nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and at number one on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The second single &quot;Danger&quot; reached number 82 on the Hot 100 and number 27 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs, while the third single &quot;Back in the Day (Puff)&quot; peaked at number 62 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. On October 28, 2003, &quot;Worldwide Underground&quot; was certified gold in sales by the Recording Industry Association of America, following sales in excess of 500,000 copies in the United States. According to Nielsen SoundScan, the album has sold 609,000 copies in the United States.

&quot;Worldwide Underground&quot; received generally lukewarm reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 71, based on 14 reviews. Andy Kellman from AllMusic said the record sounded &quot;more like a weekend jam session than an endlessly labored-over, polished project. For the most part, this is a good thing&quot;. &quot;PopMatters&quot; critic Mark Anthony Neal commended Badu for her themes relating to hip hop culture and for her musical direction, writing that &quot;it finds the artist ″&quot;Stepping into Tomorrow&quot;″, with a new production collective in tow and some straight-up, free-floating, funky-ass R&amp;B. And for the first time in her career, Badu is wearing her own voice and it is unmistakably Badu&quot;. Georgia Christgau from &quot;The Village Voice&quot; wrote that &quot;although sometimes her reliance on mood threatens to get the better of &quot;Worldwide Underground&quot;, Badu remains faithful to the old school of flow, a blend of drums and rhythm designed to service soul&#x27;s best instruments: its vocalists.&quot; &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; ranked the record number 90 on its list of the Best Albums of the Aughts.

In a less enthusiastic review, &quot;Uncut&quot; deemed &quot;Worldwide Underground&quot; oft-interesting but too groove-oriented music, while &quot;Blender&quot; observed &quot;rambling, digital fiddling and self-indulgent sprawl here, but a sense of purpose, too, even as her lips move on autopilot.&quot; Jon Caramanica from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; was more critical and said apart from &quot;Danger&quot; and &quot;Love of My Life Worldwide&quot;, most of the songs sounded aimless, &quot;variations on some atmospheric theme ... slither[ing] along unthreateningly&quot;.

==Tour==

Badu embarked on the &quot;Worldwide Underground Tour&quot; in 2004. The US trek kicked off on February 3 in New Orleans. and ran through the winter and spring with supporting act &quot;Floetry&quot; joining the tour February 5 in Houston. The Roots made a special opening act appearance at the February 11, show in Los Angeles. Badu resumed the tour during the fall with additional dates in America and Europe.

Badu founded the &quot;Sugar Water Festival&quot;, a music festival co-found by Badu, Queen Latifah and Jill Scott. The trek played to amphitheaters and arenas in the United States during the summer of 2005 and 2006. It began in 2005 as an event to bring awareness to health issues to African-American women. British duo Floetry opened shows during the 2005 run. The festival was relaunched briefly in 2006 with Kelis opening the show and comedian Mo&#x27;Nique hosting the festival. 2006 was the final year for the outing.

The festival was to expand into Europe and Asia, however, this did not come to fruition. The &quot;Summer Tour&quot; was a concert tour in 2006 by Badu. The tour started on June 10, in Knoxville, TN, with three shows in the U.S. and resumed in July for several shows in Europe. In August, Badu co-headlined dates with Jill Scott and Queen Latifah at the &quot;Sugar Water Festival&quot;.

<text>Île Saint-Paul (Saint Paul Island) is an island forming part of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands (, TAAF) in the Indian Ocean, with an area of . The island is located about south of the larger Île Amsterdam , northeast of the Kerguelen Islands, and southeast of Réunion.

It is an important breeding site for seabirds. A scientific research cabin on the island is used for scientific or ecological short campaigns, but there is no permanent population. It is under the authority of a senior administrator on Réunion.

== Geography ==

Île Saint-Paul is a volcanic island with a triangular shape that measures no more than at its widest point. It is the top of an active volcano; the volcano last erupted in 1793 (from its SW flank), and is rocky with steep cliffs on the east side. The thin stretch of rock that used to close off the crater collapsed in 1780, admitting the sea through a channel; the entrance is only a few meters deep, thus allowing only very small ships or boats to enter the crater. The interior basin, wide and deep, is surrounded by steep walls up to high. There are active thermal springs.

The island is antipodal of Cheyenne County, Colorado, one of the few places in the continental United States with a non-oceanic antipode.

=== Geology ===

The island is located on the mainly under sea Amsterdam-Saint Paul Plateau which is of volcanic hotspot origin, with the currently active Amsterdam-Saint Paul hotspot believed to be located close to the island. The aphyric (no phenocrysts) basalts found on Saint Paul are distinct from other basalts found to date on the Amsterdam-Saint Paul Plateau, being mildly alkalic, incompatible element-enriched and highly fractionated. The island is no more than 400,000 years old and was formed by magma that was a simple binary mixture between upper mantle and the Amsterdam-Saint Paul hotspot plume.

== History ==

===Early sightings===
Île Saint-Paul was first discovered in 1559 by the Portuguese. The island was mapped, described in detail and recorded in paintings by members of the crew of the &quot;nau&quot; &quot;São Paulo&quot;, among them Father Manuel Álvares and the chemist Henrique Dias. Álvares and Dias correctly calculated the latitude as 38° South. The ship was commanded by Rui Melo da Câmara and was part of the Portuguese India Armada commanded by Jorge de Sousa. The &quot;São Paulo&quot;, which also carried women and had sailed from Europe and stopped in Brazil, would be the subject of a dramatic and moving story of survival after it sank south of Sumatra.

The next confirmed sighting was made by Dutchman Harwick Claesz de Hillegom on 19 April 1618. There were further sightings of the island through the 17th century. One of the first detailed descriptions of it, and possibly the first landing, was made in December 1696 by Willem de Vlamingh.

===19th century===
In sailing-ship days captains would occasionally use the island as a check on their navigation before heading north. Saint-Paul was occasionally visited by explorers, fishermen, and sealers in the 18th and 19th centuries, among which was the American sealer &quot;General Gates&quot;, which called at the island in April 1819. George William Robinson, an American sealer, was left on the island to hunt seals, and stayed there for 23 months until the &quot;General Gates&quot; returned for him in March 1821. Robinson subsequently returned to Saint-Paul in 1826 to gather sealskin, sailing from Hobart aboard his own vessel, the schooner &quot;Hunter&quot;.

The sealing period lasted from 1789 to 1876. Sealing visits are recorded by 60 vessels, four of which ended in shipwreck. Sealing era relics include the ruins of huts and inscriptions.

France&#x27;s claim to the island dates from 1843, when a Capitain Mieroslawski re-discovered the island with a group of fishermen from Réunion; interested in setting up a fishery on Saint-Paul, Mieroslawski pressed the Governor of Réunion to take possession of both Saint-Paul and Amsterdam Island. This was performed by means of an official decree dated 8 June 1843, and on 1 July, Martin Dupeyrat, commanding the ship &quot;L&#x27;Olympe&quot;, landed on Amsterdam Island and then on Saint-Paul on 3 July, and hoisted the tricolor. Surviving evidence of this claim is an inscribed rock situated on the edge of Saint-Paul&#x27;s crater lake, inscribed &quot;Pellefournier Emile Mazarin de Noyarez, Grenoble, Canton de Sassenage, Département de l&#x27;Isère, 1844&quot;. The decree giving the islands St Paul and Amsterdam in possession of Mieroslawski is located in Archives Maritimes in Paris. All fishery operations were, however, abandoned in 1853, when the French government renounced its possession of the two islands.

The first good map of the island was not drawn up until 1857, when the Austrian frigate &quot;Novara&quot; landed a team which studied the flora, fauna, and geology from November to December.

On the 2nd of January 1865, the Confederate warship, the CSS Shenandoah, stopped briefly at Saint-Paul on its way to Australia. The ship had difficulty passing through the thick kelp field growing in the island&#x27;s sheltered interior harbor. Several sailors explored the island and returned with a penguin, some eggs, and a chicken. They also surprised two French fishermen who informed the Confederates that they were used to seeing no one for six to eight months of the year.
In 1871, a British troop transport, HMS &quot;Megaera&quot;, was wrecked on the island. Most of the 400 persons on board had to remain upwards of three months before being rescued. A short, impressionistic account of the two French residents encountered by the shipwrecked crew appears in Judith Schalansky&#x27;s &quot;Atlas of Remote Islands&quot; (2010).

In September 1874, a French astronomical mission conveyed by the sailing ship &quot;La Dive&quot; spent just over three months on Saint-Paul to observe the transit of Venus; geologist Charles Vélain took the opportunity to make a significant geological survey of the island.

In 1889, Charles Lightoller, who was later to become famous as the Second Officer of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;, whose sinking he survived, was shipwrecked here for eighty eight days when the sailing barque &quot;Holt Hill&quot; ran aground. He describes the shipwreck and the island in his autobiography, &quot;Titanic and Other Ships&quot;. Lightoller speculated that pirates used the island and their treasure could be buried in its caves.

In 1892, the crew of the French sloop &quot;Bourdonnais&quot;, followed by the ship &quot;L&#x27;Eure&quot; in 1893, again took possession of Saint-Paul and Amsterdam Island in the name of the French government.

===20th century===
In 1928, the &quot;Compagnie Générale des Îles Kerguelen&quot; recruited René Bossière and several Bretons and Madagascans to establish a spiny lobster cannery on Saint-Paul, &quot;La Langouste Française&quot;. In March 1930, at the end of the second season, most of the employees left, but seven of them stayed on the island to guard the installations, supposedly for just a few months. The promised relief arrived much too late. When the ship finally came, in December 1930, five people had died, mostly from lack of food and scurvy: Paule Brunou (a child born on the island who died two months after her birth), Emmanuel Puloc&#x27;h, François Ramamonzi, Victor Brunou, and Pierre Quillivic. Only three survivors were rescued. This event has since come to be known as &quot;Les Oubliés de Saint-Paul&quot; (&quot;the forgotten ones of Saint Paul&quot;).

A few years later in 1938, the crew of a French fishing boat was stranded on the island. Distress calls sent by the crew over short-wave radio were fortuitously received 11,000 miles away in the United States. The message was relayed to the Navy and the French consul in San Francisco, while 12-year-old Neil Taylor, an amateur radio operator in California, made contact with the stranded crew and assured them that help was on the way.


== Environment ==
The island has a cool oceanic climate and the slopes of the volcano are covered in grass. It is a breeding site for subantarctic fur seals, southern elephant seals and rockhopper penguins. It was also the breeding site for an endemic flightless duck &amp; several kinds of petrel before the introduction of exotic predators and herbivores, including black rats, house mice, European rabbits, pigs and goats during the 19th century or earlier. The pigs and goats have since disappeared or been eradicated. Black rats were eradicated in January 1997 following an aerial drop of 13.5 tonnes of brodifacoum anticoagulant poison baits over the island.

===Important Bird Area===
The island, with the adjacent islet of Quille Rock, has been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports several breeding seabirds. The island&#x27;s subtropical location gives it an avifauna distinct from that of subantarctic islands and contains several breeding species which are rare in the region. Saint Paul&#x27;s seabirds nested mainly on Quille Rock until rat eradication allowed some species, notably MacGillivray&#x27;s prions and great-winged petrels, to recolonise the main island. Other species include a colony of some 9000 pairs of northern rockhopper penguins, about 20 pairs of sooty albatrosses, a few pairs of Indian yellow-nosed albatrosses, and small numbers of Australasian gannets, fairy prions, little and flesh-footed shearwaters, Wilson&#x27;s storm petrels and sooty terns. The island might once have had a species of duck as a painting from 1793 shows one. However, it is not clear if this is conspecific with the Amsterdam wigeon (&quot;Mareca marecula&quot;) or a separate taxon. No specimens have been found though, so the existence of this cannot be proven.

<text>Blind man&#x27;s bluff (also called Indian poker, squaw poker, Oklahoma forehead, Good For You and Indian head) is a version of poker that is unconventional in that each person sees the cards of all players &quot;except their own&quot;.

In the standard version, the person with the highest card wins. Each player is dealt one card that they display to all other players (traditionally stuck to the forehead facing outwards, supposedly like an Indian feather). This is followed by a round of betting. Players attempt to guess if they have the highest card based on the distribution of visible cards and how other players are betting.

Other versions (forehead stud) are variations on stud poker, in which one or more of the hole cards is hidden from its owner, but shown to all other players, as above. During its coverage of the 2004 World Series of Poker, ESPN showed a blind man&#x27;s bluff version of Texas hold &#x27;em. Blind man&#x27;s bluff is commonly referred to as &#x27;Oklahoma forehead&#x27; throughout the central United States.

The first Blind Man&#x27;s Bluff World Championship took place at the Paddy Power Poker Irish Winter Festival in October 2010.

<text>Augustin Bizimana (1954 – August 2000, Byumba Province, Pointe-Noire) was a Rwandan politician who was wanted for his alleged role in the Rwandan genocide.

Born in Gituza commune, Byumba Province, Rwanda, of Hutu ethnicity, Bizimana held the position of Minister of Defence in the government of Juvénal Habyarimana formed on 18 July 1993.

After Habyarimana&#x27;s assassination, Bizimana became the Minister of Defence in the interim government until mid-July 1994. Among his powers were control over the possession of weapons by the civilian population, and control over the Rwandan Armed Forces (FAR), the government&#x27;s army.

Bizimana was charged with 13 counts of genocide, complicity in genocide, extermination, murder, rape, torture, other inhumane acts, persecution, cruel treatment and outrages upon personal dignity in connection with the Rwandan genocide. Among other crimes, he was alleged to be responsible for the murders of Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana, 10 Belgian United Nations peacekeepers, and Tutsi civilians. Bizimana was believed to be a fugitive until May 2020, when DNA tests showed that human remains from a grave site in Pointe-Noire in the Republic of the Congo belonged to Bizimana. He was believed to have died in Pointe-Noire in August 2000.

The Bizimana death constitutes a &quot;great disappointment&quot; for the survivors of the genocide, reacted Alain Gauthier, head of an association of victims of genocides in France.

<text>New Zealand Parliament Buildings () house the New Zealand Parliament and are on a 45,000 square metre site at the northern end of Lambton Quay, Wellington. From north to south, they are the Parliamentary Library building (1899); the Edwardian neoclassical-style Parliament House (1922); the executive wing, called &quot;The Beehive&quot; (1977); and Bowen House (in use since 1991). Currently, an additional building for housing Members of Parliament is under construction, which is expected to be completed in 2026. Whilst most of the individual buildings are outstanding for different reasons, the overall setting that has been achieved &quot;has little aesthetic or architectural coherence&quot;.

==Parliament House==
The main building of the complex is Parliament House, containing the debating chamber, speaker&#x27;s office, visitors&#x27; centre, and committee rooms.

===Predecessor building burned down===
The first Parliament (then called the &quot;General Assembly&quot;) was housed in the wooden two storey Provincial Council Building (1870s addition by William Clayton). It was replaced by the 1880s three-storey Gothic Revival building by Thomas Turnbull) and containing many indigenous timbers but was destroyed by fire in 1907 along with all other parliament buildings except the library. The library had an iron fire-door that saved its collections. Following the destruction of the building the Parliament occupied the adjacent Government House (where the Beehive now sits) for ten years.

===Replacement building===
After the old building burnt down, a contest was created for the new parliament building, which was won by Government Architect John Campbell. His design was divided into two stages. The first half, a Neoclassical building, contained both chambers and the second half Bellamy&#x27;s (the parliamentary dining facility) and a new Gothic Revival library to replace the existing one.

Despite cost concerns, Prime Minister William Massey let construction of the first stage begin in 1914, but without much of the roof ornamentation or the roof domes. The outbreak of World War I created labour and material shortages that made construction difficult. However, members of Parliament (MPs) were so desperate to get out of the run-down old Government House that they moved into the unfinished building in 1918. In 1922, the first stage was completed (the second stage was never built). Beginning in 1992, extensive work was undertaken to strengthen the building. Parliament House was finally officially opened in 1995 by Elizabeth II, Queen of New Zealand, after its refurbishment. The intention of the Liberal Government was for the design to be implemented in stages, eventually resulting in a coherent architectural setting. Instead, as Heritage New Zealand remarks, the setting that has been achieved &quot;has little aesthetic or architectural coherence&quot;, especially through the construction of the Beehive instead of completion of Parliament House.

In February 2022, many anti-COVID-19 vaccine mandate protestors converged outside Parliament House. They set up tents on the lawn, occupying the parliamentary precinct, and blockaded nearby Molesworth Street. The protestors were cleared by Police on 2 March, after nearly four weeks. The protestors set fires and caused damage to the lawns, and vandalised Parliament Buildings.

==Additional Parliament building==
In 2022, then-Speaker of the House Trevor Mallard announced a new six-story building complex behind Parliament House on Museum Street. It takes the place of what was formerly Parliament&#x27;s carpark, and is designed to house MPs that can no longer be accommodated in the main building.

The complex will be constructed out of wood to allow high earthquake resilience in combination with base isolation technology. It is set to be completed in time for the 2026 election.

==The Beehive==
The land intended for the second stage of Parliament House is occupied by the Executive Wing. This building conceived by British architect Sir Basil Spence in 1964, largely designed by the Ministry of Works, was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1977. The first parliamentary offices moved into the building in 1979. Due to its distinctive shape, it is referred to colloquially as &quot;The Beehive&quot;.

The building is ten storeys and high. The top floor is occupied by the Cabinet room, with the prime minister&#x27;s office on the floor immediately below. The offices of individual ministers, various function rooms, and Bellamy&#x27;s restaurant occupy the first three floors.

In the late 1990s there was consideration of moving the Beehive behind Parliament House, and finishing Parliament House according to the 1911 original plans. The plan was quickly scuttled due to a lack of public support and concerns about cost.

==Parliamentary Library==
Completed in 1899, the Parliamentary Library is the oldest of the buildings. It stands to the north of Parliament House (to its right, looking from the front).

The library was designed in Gothic Revival style and was fire resistant, being constructed of masonry. The third storey of the design was not built, to save money. It had an iron fire-door separating the library from the main entrance section. This saved the library from the fire of 1907, which destroyed the rest of the timber parliament buildings.

Along with Parliament House, the library was strengthened and refurbished in the 1990s. This included recreating Gothic elements of the roof including ironwork, turrets and finials. It still houses Parliament&#x27;s library. The building is registered with Heritage New Zealand (previously called the New Zealand Historic Places Trust) as a Category 1 heritage structure with registration number 217.

==Bowen House==
A 22-storey office building across Bowen Street from the Beehive, Bowen House houses MPs&#x27; offices and support staff and has been leased by Parliamentary Services since 1991. It is connected to the rest of the parliamentary complex by a tunnel under Bowen Street which contains a travelator.

==Old Government Buildings==

Not part of the current parliamentary complex and on the other side of Lambton Quay, this four-storey building was designed by William Clayton and built in 1876. The former Government Buildings currently house Victoria University of Wellington&#x27;s Law School as part of Victoria&#x27;s Pipitea campus. Several rooms featuring displays of the building&#x27;s history have been set up for public viewing.

<doc id="1297505" wikidata="Q7600819" url="?curid=1297505" title="Star Park">
<text>Starr Park is the name applied to several former sports stadiums in Syracuse, New York. The name referred to the Syracuse professional baseball teams, which were called the Stars beginning around 1870 and continuing in most seasons until the last Stars team was fielded in 1929.

* The first of these venues was an alternate name of [[Newell Park]], at the southeast corner of South Salina Street and what is now East Raynor Avenue. It was the home field of Stars teams from 1878 through 1884, including the Syracuse Stars of the National League in 1879.

* The second, and longest-lived, Star Park opened in 1885, a couple of long blocks north of Newell Park. It was bounded by Salina, Taylor, Oneida and Temple Streets, with the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad tracks running through a corner of the block. In addition to various Syracuse Stars minor league clubs through its two decades of existence, the field was the home of the Syracuse Stars of the major league American Association during the 1890 season. After 20 years of use, the city decided not to renew the ball club&#x27;s lease, and ran what is now South Clinton Street through the property

* The next Star Park was initially called Athletic Park. It was first the home of the Syracuse Stars minor league team in the Eastern League during 1900 and part of 1901. The Stars returned to the Salina and Taylor location during 1902 through 1904, after which the city closed it. The Stars then resumed play at Athletic Park, redubbing it New Star Park, which they used as members of the New York State League during the 1905 and 1906 seasons. Athletic Park / New Star Park was bordered by Marsh Street (later Hiawatha Boulevard) to the south, and by Pulaski and Liberty Streets.

* After the 1906 season, the Stars moved again, about a mile northward, to a field called Hallock Park or First Ward Park or, again, Star Park. The Stars fielded teams in the New York State League from 1907 through 1917, then had another try with the International League, for 1918 only. This ballpark has been described as near the end of North Salina Street &quot;not far from&quot; Onondaga Lake, and Hiawatha Boulevard toward the southeast. What is now Park Street was to the northeast, across which there is now a Regional Market. The ballpark site itself was eventually swallowed by ramps for Interstate Highway 81.

* The final version of Star Park, also known as Syracuse Athletic Park and International League Park, opened in 1920, and closed after the 1929 season. It was located at 1420 West Genesee Street, on the north side of that street between State Fair Boulevard and the New York Central tracks. It was the home of Stars teams in the International League during 1920 through 1927, and then a short-lived Stars entry in the New York–Pennsylvania League during 1928, and part way through the 1929 season.

:This last Star Park was also the home of the short-lived Syracuse Pros football team, who were &quot;possible&quot; members of the American Professional Football Association (later renamed the National Football League), in 1921.

Syracuse was without minor league ball until Municipal Stadium opened in 1934, for a newly transferred International League club that was named the Syracuse Chiefs.

<text>Troy Ball Club Grounds was a baseball ground in Watervliet, New York. It was home to the Troy Trojans baseball club of the National League for the 1882 season. According to the Troy city directory for 1882, the ballpark was at &quot;Genesee Street opposite the West Troy Depot&quot; of the Delaware &amp; Hudson Railroad. Genesee was later renamed 19th Street and is a major thoroughfare in Watervliet.

The 1885 Sanborn map shows &quot;Base Ball Park&quot; south of Genesee and east of the railroad tracks.

<doc id="1297511" wikidata="Q3498073" url="?curid=1297511" title="Steinbach (electoral district)">
<text>Steinbach is a provincial electoral division in the Canadian province of Manitoba that encompasses the city of Steinbach, the riding&#x27;s namesake, and northeastern part of the Rural Municipality of Hanover.

The current MLA is Kelvin Goertzen, who was first elected with almost 75% of the vote in 2003. Goertzen also briefly served as Premier of Manitoba in 2021.

==History==
It was created by redistribution in 1989, and has formally existed since the provincial election of 1990. Originally a much larger riding in terms of geographical area, Steinbach has been redistributed three times (1999, 2011, and 2019) in response to the city of Steinbach&#x27;s rapid population growth and is now among the smallest provincial ridings in terms of land area outside of Winnipeg.

The riding is currently bordered by the riding of Dawson Trail to the north and east, and La Verendrye to the south and west. Prior to the redistribution ahead of the 2019 election, the riding was bordered by the former Emerson riding to the west, La Verendrye to the south and east, Dawson Trail to the north, and former Morris riding to the west.

==Demographics==
As of 2016, thirty-four per cent of the riding&#x27;s residents list German as their ethnic origin, and a further 7% list themselves as Dutch. There is a very strong Mennonite presence in the riding. Steinbach&#x27;s population in 2006 was 19,415. In the year 1999, the average family income was $46,133, and the unemployment rate was 5.00%. Manufacturing accounts for 17% of the riding&#x27;s industry, followed by agriculture at 14%.

==Voting history==
The riding has been held by the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba since its creation, and is considered extremely safe for that party. Steinbach&#x27;s rural nature, as well as the city&#x27;s religious background, gives the riding a strong social conservative tint. Manitoba political pundits often refer to Steinbach as a &quot;yellow dog riding,&quot; as it is one of many rural ridings where it is often said in jest that the Tories could nominate a yellow dog and still win. It is located within the federal riding of Provencher.

<doc id="1297513" wikidata="Q4570669" url="?curid=1297513" title="Tara MacLean">
<text>Tara Margaret Charity MacLean (born October 25, 1973) is a Canadian musician, singer, and composer.
Her songs as a solo artist include &quot;Evidence&quot;, &quot;If I Fall&quot;, and a cover of the Christmas song &quot;Light of the Stable&quot;. She was a member of Atlantic Canadian regional group, Shaye with Kim Stockwood and Damhnait Doyle from 2002 to 2007.

==Early life and education==
MacLean is the daughter of Sharlene MacLean, an actress, and Danny Costain, a singer and dancer from British Columbia. She was influenced by her stepfather Marty Reno, a songwriter and guitarist with Canadian recording star Gene MacLellan. She was born and raised in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island on the east coast of Canada, and is the eldest of four children. All four were pulled from their burning home in May 1987 by Constable David Cheverie, who was awarded for bravery and received the Cross of Valour for saving their lives. She moved to British Columbia when she was 13 years old.

MacLean lived in Victoria, British Columbia, and graduated from Mount Douglas Secondary School in 1991.

==Career==
Nettwerk Records discovered MacLean singing on a ferry between Victoria, British Columbia and Salt Spring Island. She signed to Nettwerk Records in April 1995 after moving to Vancouver to record her song &quot;Let Her Feel the Rain&quot; for &quot;Lit from Within&quot;, a Nettwerk Records benefit compilation for rape crisis centers. That song was also placed on a Nettwerk compilation titled &quot;Slowbrew&quot;, and it received some radio airplay. Her representing agents are S.L. Feldman&#x27;s in Canada and Little Big Man in the U.S. She is signed to Sony Music Publishing Canada.

Her first live appearance in Vancouver was at Nettwerk Record&#x27;s 10 Year Anniversary Show at the Vogue Theater. MacLean made an impact opening for the Dave Matthews Band and she appeared at the East Coast Music Awards where she sang with Marty Reno and Lennie Gallant as a tribute to Gene McLellan.

===&quot;Silence&quot;===

In October 1995, MacLean went to San Francisco to record her debut album Silence at Brilliant Studios with producer Norm Kerner with additional recording in Vancouver.

MacLean toured to promote &quot;Silence&quot; for over two years, including opening slots for Ashley MacIsaac, Barenaked Ladies, Dave Matthews Band, Paula Cole, Ron Sexsmith and Tom Cochrane, and The Cure as well as eight dates on the Lilith Fair tour. The album sold over 20,000 copies in the United States.

In 1997 MacLean released a five-song EP of live, remixed and re-recorded songs called &quot;If You See Me&quot;. MacLean embarked on a national club tour to promote the EP, performing as a duo with guitarist Bill Bell. She was named Best New Solo Artist in the Contemporary Hit Radio category at the Canadian Radio Music Awards in 1997. She joined Capitol Records for her major label release. 

Her version of the folk song Rattlesnake Mountain, also known as &quot;On Springfield Mountain&quot;, was featured during the closing credits of the 1997 movie &quot;Inventing the Abbotts&quot;.

===&quot;Passenger&quot;===

MacLean&#x27;s second full-length album was called &quot;Passenger&quot;. It was recorded in New Orleans and produced by Malcolm Burn (Daniel Lanois) and then husband Bill Bell (Tom Cochrane, Danko Jones). It was released in October 1999 by Nettwerk Records in Canada and Capitol Records in America. MacLean promoted &quot;Passenger&quot; in Canada, America and Asia for 18 months. &quot;If I Fall&quot; and &quot;Divided&quot; were both released as singles. &quot;Live from Austin&quot; and &quot;Live from Roots Lodge&quot; were released as two special live EPs. &quot;Settling&quot; was also released in Taiwan as the album&#x27;s third single. She toured extensively, opening for Dido on her first U.S. tour.

To support &quot;Passenger&quot;, MacLean joined Kendall Payne, Shannon McNally and Amy Correia for a 21-stop Capitol Records sponsored The Girls Room Tour across America. Admission to The Girls Room shows were free, and the tour donated $1,000 to a women&#x27;s charity in each city the tour visits. &quot;Passenger&quot; sold over 50,000 copies. She also appeared on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; and had a Cameo in the Jerry Bruckheimer film &quot;Coyote Ugly&quot;, and USA Network&#x27;s &quot;Good vs Evil&quot;.

MacLean left Capitol Records in 2001.

MacLean gave birth to her first child Sophia Madrien Soleil Bell in 2001 in Oakville, Ontario.

===Shaye===

MaLean collaborated with fellow artists Kim Stockwood and Damhnait Doyle. The resulting group was named Shaye. The name was a tribute to Maclean&#x27;s sister who died in a car accident in 2002.

Their debut album &quot;The Bridge&quot; was released in October 2003 on EMI Canada. &quot;Happy Baby&quot; the lead single, was nominated for Single of the Year at the 2004 Juno Awards and won the Canadian Radio music award. This was followed up by &quot;Beauty&quot; in January 2005. They represented Canada at the World Expo in Nagoya, Japan that Spring.

In 2006, she gave birth to her second child Stella Heather Sky Grand in Toronto, where she was residing with her partner Ted Grand (director and co-founder of Modo Yoga.)

Their 2006 follow up &quot;Lake of Fire&quot; was released on EMI Canada. It was exclusively available on iTunes in November 2006, then released physically in February 2007.

===Wake===
MacLean&#x27;s third full-length release &quot;Wake&quot; was released on April 22, 2008, and is available to purchase as CD or MP3 from Nettwerk. 

On October 8, 2007, MacLean announced that she was leaving Shaye due to parental commitments and the desire to pursue a solo career.

She had her third child, Flora Samadhi Shaye Grand in April 2008.

===Atlantic Blue===
MacLean&#x27;s fourth studio album Atlantic Blue was released on 22 May 2017 to project supporters on PledgeMusic on digital, CD and vinyl. As part of the promotion of the project, an EP called Evidence was released on NoiseTrade as a free download, which featured a mix of released and previously unreleased tracks.

Atlantic Blue is a show and an album celebrating of Canadian east coast songwriters and contains covers of songs by Gene MacLellan, Gordie Sampson, Lennie Gallant, The Rankin Family, Rita MacNeil, Ron Hynes, Sarah McLachlan, Shaye, Stompin&#x27; Tom Connors, and others.

<text>Union Base-Ball Grounds was a baseball park located in Chicago. The park was &quot;very visibly downtown&quot;, its small block bounded on the west by Michigan Avenue, on the north by Randolph Street, and on the east by railroad tracks and the lake shore, which was then much closer than it is today. The site is now part of Millennium Park.

== Baseball ==

Union Base-Ball Grounds was also called White-Stocking Park, as it was the home field of the Chicago White Stockings of the National Association in 1871, after spending the 1870 season as an independent professional club playing home games variously at Dexter Park race course and Ogden Park. The Great Chicago Fire of October 8 destroyed Union Base-Ball Grounds and all of the club&#x27;s possessions. After fulfilling its 1871 obligations by playing on the road, the club did not field a team for the next two seasons, and the ballpark was not rebuilt.

In 1878, the White Stockings returned to the 1871 site and to a new park that is usually called Lake-Shore Park, Lake Front Park, or simply Lake Park, which was actually the name for the entire waterfront area (not just the ballpark) until being renamed Grant Park in 1901. At the new park, the outfield area was especially close in right field. The right field fence was less than 200 feet away, so anyone hitting the ball over that fence was awarded only a ground rule double. Batters would aim for the fence, and during their years at the park, the Chicago club regularly led the league in doubles. In what would be their final season on the lakefront, the White Stockings decided to make the entire outfield fence home run territory. Thus, the team slumped in the number of doubles while boosting their home runs from typically a dozen or two to 142, easily outdistancing second place Buffalo, which had 39 for the season. The entire league&#x27;s home run totals were up, thanks to the change to the Chicago ground rules.

The team played at Lake-Shore Park through the 1884 season. After the season, the city reclaimed the land, and the White Stockings became a road team for the first couple of months of 1885 while awaiting construction of the first West Side Park. The lumber from the stands was disassembled and reconfigured as the new stands at West Side Park.[Chicago &quot;Tribune&quot;, March 15, 1885, p.11]

==Football==
The first college football game in the Midwest was played at the park on May 30, 1879, when the University of Michigan met Racine College. Michigan won, 1-0, on a place-kick by David DeTarr.

<doc id="1297518" wikidata="Q3564665" url="?curid=1297518" title="Music of Crete">
<text>The music of Crete (, ), also called kritika (), refers to traditional forms of Greek folk music prevalent on the island of Crete in Greece. Cretan traditional music includes instrumental music (generally also involving singing), a capella songs known as the rizitika, &quot;Erotokritos,&quot; Cretan urban songs (tabachaniotika), as well as other miscellaneous songs and folk genres (lullabies, ritual laments, etc.).

Historically, there have been significant variations in the music across the island (more violin than lyra in far Eastern and Western Crete, a preference for the &quot;syrtos&quot; in Western Crete and &quot;kondylies&quot; in Eastern Crete). Some of this variation continues today and in the late-twentieth and early-twenty-first centuries has received greater attention by scholars and the mass media. Nonetheless, over the course of the twentieth-century, the sense of a single, island-wide Cretan musical tradition emerged.

Although much Cretan music remains consciously close to its folk roots and an integral part of the fabric of many Cretans&#x27; everyday lives, it is also a vibrant and evolving modern, popular tradition that involves many professional and semi-professional musicians, numerous regional record companies and professional distributors, professional luthiers (especially of Cretan lyras and Cretan lutes), and Cretan &quot;kentra&quot; (clubs for dancing to live Cretan music).

== Categories ==

=== Instrumental (dances, &quot;kondylies, kantadha&quot;) ===
Much Cretan music includes the use of instruments (and usually singing, too). Lyra, violin, and laouto (Cretan lute) predominate, but other common instruments include the mandolin, mandola, oud, thiampoli (souravli), askomandoura, classical guitar (especially in Eastern Crete), boulgari, and daouli (davul). There is also an instrument known as the viololyra, a hybrid of the violin and lyra, which has enjoyed varying degrees of popularity at various times.

Cretan music has been largely heterophonic in texture or accompanied by drones and fifth chords on Cretan lute, classical guitar, mandolin, boulgari, and so forth. Drones are also played simultaneously on melody instruments such as the lyra and violin by bowing a second string (usually open) simultaneously as one plays the melody notes on another string. Especially in earlier and more amateur settings where a second accompanying instrument was often absent, a lyra player accompanied himself by playing not only a drone string but also with a distinctively rhythmic bowing style in order to ring the &quot;gerakokoudhouna&quot; (small &quot;falcon bells&quot;) that were attached to his bow. It is much more common today for the lyra to be accompanied by one or more other instruments, and for lyra players to employ a violin bow.

Like much Greek folk music, Cretan music is closely related to dance, and the most common musical forms correspond directly with the Cretan dances that may accompany them, such as the Syrtos, pentozali, siganos, pidikhtos, and Sousta. Certain traditional dances from other regions of Greece, most notably kalamatianos and ballos, are also widely performed by professional Cretan musicians, usually with Cretan-composed lyrics, in musical gatherings since at least the twentieth century. Like fiddle tunes in various other traditions, Cretan dance music often involves repeated melodies or repeated pairings of melodies, whose selection and concatenation is improvised in performance.

Another musical construction common to Cretan music is the &quot;taximi&quot; (), a rhythmically free, improvised instrumental solo (e.g., on the violin, lyra, or lute) in a particular scale or mode preceding the dance-song proper. (Both the word &quot;taximi&quot; and the musical form itself are cognates with the Arabic taqsim.)

==== Mantinadas ====
Much Cretan music is improvisational, especially in terms of its &quot;lyrics.&quot; Typically, the lyrics of Cretan instrumental music take the form of &quot;mantinadas&quot; (): fifteen-syllable rhyming (or assonant) couplets which have their origins in medieval Cretan poetry (as rhyming couplets) as well as in earlier (non-rhyming) forms of Greek verse (in the same fifteen-syllable form).

Each line of a mantinada is divided into two hemistichs (), the first of eight syllables and the second of seven, and separated by a caesura. For this reason, sometimes when mantinadas are transcribed, they are broken into four shorter lines in a rhyme scheme of &quot;ABCB&quot; as opposed to the traditional form of a couplet. The metrical rhythm of mantinadas usually falls into eight successive iambs followed by an unstressed syllable, the form known in Greek as political verse and akin to the English-language fourteener and ballad stanza. There may be slight variations in meter.

For example:&quot;Τα κρητικά τα χώματα, όπου και αν τα σκάψεις, &lt;br&gt;αίμα παλικαριών θα βρείς, κόκαλα θα ξεθάψεις.&quot;&quot;Ta Kritika ta chomata, opou kai an ta skapseis &lt;br&gt; Aima palikarion tha vreis, kokala tha ksethapseis.&quot; &quot;΅Wherever you happen to dig in Cretan soil, &lt;br&gt;You will find the blood of stout-hearted men, you will unbury bones.&quot; Mantinadas are written about a variety of subjects. Many focus on love, employ pastoral imagery, and use Cretan idiomatic Greek. Numerous folklorists since the early twentieth century have published large collections of mantinadas. Since the mid-twentieth century, some prolific mantinada composers have regionally published their mantinadas, much like other books of poetry. Some mantinadas are excerpted as stand-alone rhyming couplets from longer poems, particularly the Erotokritos, an epic poem that is a staple of Cretan Renaissance literature.

Singers, professional and amateur alike, frequently improvise in the moment &quot;which&quot; mantinadas they sing or improvise entirely new ones on the spot. Sometimes a certain pairing of a particular mantinada with a particular melody (e.g., based on a well-known professional recording) will also congeal among much of the population and therefore tend to be repeated in performance.

A common musical accompaniment for the improvisation of large numbers of mantinadas is called a &quot;kontilia&quot; (), a four-measure melody. The same &quot;kontilia&quot; (or a traditional pairing of &quot;kontylies&quot;) can be repeated for virtually any length of time, but musicians can also improvise changes in which &quot;kontylia&quot; is being played, stringing together different &quot;kontylies&quot; over the course of a performance.

There is also a tradition of the &quot;kantadha&quot; (serenade) in Crete in which mantinadas are sung and improvised. The music of a kantadha may be kondylies or structured like the music of a syrtos (the dance form) but not actually intended for dancing or even necessarily sung at a tempo appropriate for dancing.

=== A Cappella singing (Rizitika) ===
There is also a strong a cappella tradition of mountain songs known as rizitika. The rizitika are conventionally divided into rizitika &quot;of the road&quot; (&quot;tis stratas&quot;) and rizitika &quot;of the table&quot; (&quot;tis tavlas&quot;). Since the twentieth century, an island-wide canon of rizitika songs has taken shape, especially in the wake of a commercially influential recording of them arranged by Yannis Markopoulos and sung by Nikos Xylouris in the early 1970s. Folklorists and other scholars have also published large collections of rizitika song texts. (For example, &quot;Rizitika: Dimotika Tragoudia tis Kritis&quot; by Stamatis Apostolakis.)

=== Erotokritos ===
There is also a vigorous tradition of singing excerpts of the Erotokritos to a specific set of tunes as a &quot;song&quot; genre in its own right (with or without instrumental accompaniment).The entire set of tunes will repeat as many times as required for the length of the excerpt that is being sung.

Sometimes, rhyming couplets are excerpted from the Erotokritos and sung as mantinadas.

The First Lines of the Erotokritos:

 Του Κύκλου τα γυρίσματα, που ανεβοκατεβαίνουν, &lt;br&gt; και του Τροχού, που ώρες ψηλά κι ώρες στα βάθη πηαίνουν 
 Tou Kiklou ta girismata, pou anevokatevainoun, &lt;br&gt; kai tou Trochou, pou ores psila ki ores sta bathi piainoun 
 Of the great revolving cycle on which they travel, &lt;br&gt; and of the wheel, on which hours run high and low 

=== Tabachaniotika ===
The &quot;tabachaniotika&quot; (; sing.: tabachaniotiko – ) songs are a Cretan urban musical repertory of instrumental and vocal music which belongs to a broader family of urban genres. Major features of the tabachaniotika songs are Dromoi (sing:in Greek &quot;dromos&quot; – &quot;δρόμος&quot;) (i.e., modes) and musical instruments such as the laouto and boulgarí (μπουλγκαρί, the Cretan orelse). Once again, the Cretan Mantinada often figures prominently in the words to such songs.

One explanation of the origin of the word &quot;tambahaniotika&quot; is that they come from the eponymous district area of Greek city of Patras &quot;Ταμπαχανιώτικα&quot;. Also, various conjectures are advanced to explain the meaning and origin of the term &quot;tabachaniotika&quot;. Kostas Papadakis believes that it comes from &quot;tabakaniotikes&quot; (ταμπακανιώτικες), which may mean places where hashish ( &#x27;tobacco&#x27;) was smoked while music was performed, as was the case with the tekédes (τεκέδες; pl. of tekés) of other major urban centres.
This kind of genre was found in Crete and Smyrna and was played with lyra and laouto.

Unlike rebetiko, the &quot;tabachaniotika&quot; was not considered underground music and was only sung, not danced, according to Nikolaos Sarimanolis, the last living performer of this repertory in Chania. Only a few musicians played the &quot;tabachaniotika&quot;, the most famous being the &quot;boulgarí&quot; (a mandolin-like instrument) player Stelios Foustalieris (1911–1992) from Réthymnon. Foustalieris bought his first boulgarí in 1924. In 1979, he said that in Réthymnon, the boulgarí had been widespread during the 1920s. An early twentieth-century variation of rebetiko around the Lakkos brothel district in Irakleio is indicative of a &quot;hybrid music scene associated with cross-cultural interaction between different social and ethnic groups and musical traditions.&quot;

Notwithstanding the dearth of performers, &quot;tabachaniotika&quot; songs were widespread and could also be performed at domestic gatherings. Notable artists of this genre who were originally refugees from Asia Minor include the bouzouki player Nikolaos &quot;Nikolis&quot; Sarimanolis (Νικολής Σαριμανώλης; born in Nea Ephesos in 1919) as a member of a folk-group founded by Kostas Papadakis in Chaniá in 1945, Antonis Katinaris (also based in Chaniá), and the Rethymnon-based Mihalis Arabatzoglou and Nikos Gialidis.

==History==

===Origins===
Cretan music, like most of the traditional Greek music, began as product of ancient, Byzantine music, with western and eastern inspirations. The first recorded reference to lyra was in the 9th century by the Persian geographer Ibn Khurradadhbih (d. 911); in his lexicographical discussion of instruments, he cited the lyre (lūrā) as the typical instrument of the Byzantines along with the (organ). The lyra spread widely via the Byzantine trade routes that linked the three continents; in the 11th and 12th centuries European writers use the terms &quot;fiddle&quot; and &quot;lyra&quot; interchangeably when referring to bowed instruments. Descendants of the Byzantine lyra have continued to be played in post-Byzantine regions until the present day with few changes, for example the Calabrian Lira in Italy, the Cretan Lyra, the Gadulka in Bulgaria, and the Pontian lyra in Turkey.

Following the Fourth Crusade, the Venetians dominated the island and introduced later new instruments and styles of music. In particular the three-stringed &quot;lira da braccio&quot; was introduced. By the end of the 14th century, a poetic form called mantinada became popular, a rhyming couplet of fifteen syllables.

===Post-Byzantine era===
After the fall of Constantinople, many Byzantine and Venetian musicians took refuge on Crete and established schools of music. A French physician in 1547 (Pierre Belon) reported warrior-like dances on Crete, and an English traveler in 1599 reported the wild dances performed late at night.

The oldest transcription of folk songs in all of Greece can be traced to the 17th century, when songs in the rizitika type (see below) were mentioned by monks at Iviron and Xeropotamou Monasteries on Mount Athos.

The connection between music and religion continues in modern Crete; priests are said to be excellent folk singers, including the rizitiko singer Aggelos Psilakis. It was during this period, when the modern Cretan folk music was formed, that Francisco Leontaritis was active. The explicit musical connection between Cretan music and Byzantine chant was documented in the seminal study &quot;La chanson grecque&quot; by Swiss musicologist and archivist Samuel Baud-Bovy.

===Twentieth-century consolidation===
Cretan music underwent significant new developments in the twentieth-century, many related to professionalization, technology, and modernization, even as it remained closely interwoven with the fabric of many Cretans&#x27; everyday lives. Cretan music also continued to be widely performed by amateurs in everyday life as well.

==== Early masters (πρωτομάστορες) ====
The advent of recordings, the growing ease of travel between regions on the island, and the modernization of instruments such as the lyra all contributed to the construction of &quot;Cretan music&quot; as a single, island-wide &quot;Cretan&quot;, and thus somewhat less locally or regionally bound, tradition.

In the early 20th century, the violin was prominent in Cretan music in far Eastern and Western Crete. The modern form of the lyra appeared when a lyraki and violin were combined replacing the lyra drone strings with three strings in succession (d-a-e&#x27;). As a result, the range of the lyra was increased, and the lyra could start playing dances from the violin repertoire as well.

Cretan music was recorded as early as 1917, and has continued to be recorded extensively ever since.

Up until the Second World War, many early masters of the lyra, violin or laouto were recorded on 78, such as Antonogiorgakis, Harchalis, Kalogeridis, Kanteris, Karavitis, Lagoudakis (Lagos), Papadakis (Kareklas), Rodinos, Saridakis (Mavros). Many of these musicians and their recordings were largely forgotten in the wake of new waves of Cretan musicians and recordings artists after the Second World War, until their wider &quot;rediscovery&quot; upon the re-release of their music on compact discs and cassettes (and later online) starting in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

==== Mid-century ====

Certain widely recorded Cretan musicians, such as Kostas Mountakis and Thanasis Skordalos, further helped in the establishment and dissemination more widely across the island a shared repertory or canon of Cretan melodies.

As late as the 1960s, most Cretan traditional music was largely considered rural and still widely looked down upon in Cretan cities. Nikos Xylouris was among a new generation of musicians and recording artists whose work further helped to popularize Cretan music in the cities of Crete and beyond.

In the early 1960s, Greek composer Mikis Theodorakis based his theme music for the 1964 Cacoyannis film Zorba the Greek (itself based on the novel by Cretan author Nikos Kazantzakis) on Cretan syrta that had been recorded earlier by Giorgis Koutsourelis, such as on the hasapiko dance. The new dance was named &quot;sirtaki&quot; by choreographer Giorgos Provias. The film also shows clips of Cretan musicians performing Cretan music.

Greek composer Manos Hatzidakis also included a Cretan-syrtos-inspired opening song in his &quot;Kapetan Michales&quot; cycle (1966), written for theater and based on Cretan author Nikos Kazantzakis&#x27;s &quot;Captain Michalis&quot; (frequently translated as &quot;Freedom and Death&quot;).

In 1968, German director Werner Herzog&#x27;s short film &quot;Last Words&quot; includes extensive (uncredited) clips of Antonis Papadakis (Kareklas) and Lefteris Daskalakis performing Cretan music.

==== Late century ====
Cretan music continued to be performed and to develop professionally throughout the 1970s. The 1970s was also a period for several important documentaries about Cretan music, such as those for Greek public television hosted by Domna Samiou.

By the 1980s, some professional musicians were recording modern arrangements of Cretan music involving instruments such as the steel-string acoustic guitar, and more chordal accompaniments involving major, minor, and diminished harmonies.

By the 1990s, there were numerous local radio and television shows dedicated to Cretan music.

=== Influence and contemporary fusions ===
Some contemporary musicians in Crete, including Ross Daly, have experimented with new kinds of music that have been heavily influenced by Cretan traditional music.

Ethnomusicologist Kevin Dawe has noted that, &quot;Recent fusions of Cretan/Greek, Turkish and various other &quot;oriental&quot; musics and musical instruments in both popular and traditional musics present a challenge to established notions of musical performance practice and musical identity.&quot;

==Dances==
* Ntames
* Pentozali (siganos &amp; grigoros)
* Pidikhtos (Anogeianos &amp; Ethianos)
* Sousta (Rethemniotiki)
* Syrtos, like in the music of mainland Greece is a dance in 4/4 time. On Crete this dance is typically accompanied by an up tempo Cretan lyra melody
* Trizalis
* Angaliastos
* Maleviziotis

== Sociology ==
Numerous scholars have noted that modern Cretan music has been a predominantly male domain and, in particular, serves as a site for performing one&#x27;s &quot;manhood.&quot;

Several scholars have examined the history and politics surrounding the violin versus the lyra as the primary musical instrument identified with the island and employed in its music.

==Cretan musicians==

Some of the earliest popular music stars from Crete were Andreas Rodinos, Yiannis Bernidakis, Stelios Koutsourelis, Stelios Foustalieris, Efstratios Kalogeridis, Kostas Papadakis, Michalis Kounelis, Kostas Mountakis, Leonidas Klados and Thanassis Skordalos. Later, in the 1960s, musicians like Nikos Xylouris (Psaronikos) and Yannis Markopoulos combined Cretan folk music with classical techniques. For the above choices, Nikos Xylouris received the negative criticism of conservative fans of the Cretan music but he remained popular, as did similarly styled performers like Charalambos Garganourakis and Vasilis Skoulas. Nowadays, prominent performers include Antonis Xylouris (Psarantonis), Giorgos Xylouris (Psarogiorgis), Ross Daly, Loudovikos ton Anogeion, Stelios Petrakis, Vasilis Stavrakakis, the group Chainides, Zacharias Spyridakis, Michalis Stavrakakis, Mitsos Stavrakakis, Michalis Kontaxakis, Dimitrios Vakakis, Giorgos Skordalos, Georgios Tsantakis, Michalis Tzouganakis, Elias Horeftakis, Giannis Haroulis, and Giorgis Pantermakis. And of course the legendary man with the double mustache, Nikolas Gonianakis. Nikos Stavrakakis

<doc id="1297520" wikidata="Q339055" url="?curid=1297520" title="Russian Hill, San Francisco">
<text>Russian Hill is a neighborhood of San Francisco, California. It is named after one of San Francisco&#x27;s 44 hills, and one of its original &quot;Seven Hills&quot;.

==Location==
Russian Hill is directly to the north (and slightly downhill) from Nob Hill, to the south (uphill) from Fisherman&#x27;s Wharf, and to the west of the North Beach neighborhood. The Hill is bordered on its west side by parts of the neighborhoods of Cow Hollow and the Marina District.

At the northern foot of the hill is Ghirardelli Square, which sits on the waterfront of the San Francisco Bay, Aquatic Park, and Fisherman&#x27;s Wharf, a popular tourist area. A trip down the winding turns of Lombard Street and across Columbus Avenue to the east leads to the neighborhood of North Beach. Down the hill to the west, past Van Ness Avenue, are Cow Hollow and the Marina districts.

==History==

The neighborhood&#x27;s name goes back to the Gold Rush-era, when settlers discovered a small Russian cemetery at the top of the hill. Russian naval and merchant ships frequently visited San Francisco throughout the 19th century beginning in 1806, and there are several mentions of burials of crew members in the Russian Hill cemetery in the first half of the century. The cemetery was eventually removed, but the name remained.

In 1853 and 1854, a partnership was formed by William H. Ranlett (the architect), Charles Homer (the general contractor), and Joseph H. Atkinson (the mason/brick contractor), in order to build three houses in Russian Hill (at what is now known as the Vallejo Street Crest). The Atkinson House (1853) is one of the oldest houses still standing in San Francisco, and possibly one of the first examples of Italianate-style architecture in the city.

The switchbacks design of Lombard Street was first suggested by property owner Carl Henry and was built in 1922, intended to reduce the hill&#x27;s natural 27 percent grade, which was too steep for most vehicles to climb.

==About and attractions==

=== Districts and views ===
Because of the steepness of the hill, many streets, portions of Vallejo and Green streets, for example, are staircases. Views from the top of the hill extend in several directions around the Bay Area, including the Bay Bridge, Marin County, the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz. The Macondray Lane District is notable for its historic architecture in a hilly and woodsy area, which features the pedestrian-only Macondray Lane. The Paris Block Architectural District is a residential area known for its architecture, including the Feusier Octagon House.

The Vallejo Street Crest Historic District is located in the southeast portion of the hill and is known for the cultural history and architecture, the district is surrounded by a retaining wall and natural bluff. A small park at the top of the hill on Vallejo Street (or the Vallejo Street Crest) features a small plaque and memorial placed by the Russian Government, that is dedicated to the original Russian cemetery that once stood there. Another park on the hill on Vallejo Street is named after Ina Coolbrith.

Russian Hill is home to the former San Francisco Art Institute, located on Chestnut Street between Jones and Leavenworth Streets. The Academy of Art University also maintains a presence in this neighborhood with their Chestnut Street building hosting their fine art MFA studios, photo classrooms, and photo studios.

=== Lombard Street ===
The neighborhood is most famous for Lombard Street, the one-way section on Russian Hill between Hyde and Leavenworth Streets, in which the roadway has eight sharp turns (or switchbacks) that have earned the street the distinction of being &quot;the crookedest street in the world&quot;. As it is one of the most visited tourist attractions in the city, this section of the neighborhood is frequently crowded with tourists. Tourists also frequent the cable car line along Hyde Street, which is lined with many restaurants and shops.

=== Parks ===

Alice Marble Tennis Courts are four hardcourt tennis courts located at Lombard and Hyde Streets. The courts offer a view of the bay and North Beach and can be unsuitable for tennis on windy days. A basketball court is located adjacent to the tennis courts. The San Francisco Cable Cars serving the Powell-Hyde line stops nearby.

==Government and infrastructure==
San Francisco Police Department Central Station, Metro Division serves Russian Hill.

==Education==
It is in the San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) and is within the Jean Parker Elementary School attendance area. The school building was first built in 1911 and rebuilt in 1996.

==In fiction==
Life in the neighborhood during the 1970s was used as the basis for the fictionalized series &quot;Tales of the City&quot; by Armistead Maupin.

Much of the famous car chase sequence in the 1968 thriller &quot;Bullitt&quot;, starring Steve McQueen (whose character lived in Nob Hill on Taylor and Clay streets), were filmed on Russian Hill, notably the scenes on Taylor Street. The neighborhood was also featured in the early scenes of the 1982 action-comedy feature film, &quot;48 Hrs&quot;.

The cast of &quot;The Real World: San Francisco&quot;, which aired in 1994, lived in the house at 949 Lombard Street on Russian Hill from February 12 to June 19, 1994.

In Anne Rice&#x27;s book &quot;The Wolf Gift&quot;, the main character, Reuben Golding, grew up in Russian Hill.

John &quot;Scottie&quot; Ferguson, a character played by James Stewart lives at 900 Lombard Street in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s film &quot;Vertigo&quot; (1958).

Based on the view from the window, Admiral James T. Kirk&#x27;s apartment seen in the films &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot; and &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot; was located in the Russian Hill area of San Francisco.

In the racing video game &quot;Blur&quot;, one of the courses is named after and closely resembles Russian Hill.

A parody of Russian Hill appears as a district in the 1997 video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot;, named &#x27;Soviet Hill&#x27;.

<doc id="1297523" wikidata="Q2386473" url="?curid=1297523" title="Sunfish (sailboat)">
<text>The Sunfish is a personal-size, beach-launched sailing dinghy. It features a very flat, boardlike hull carrying an Oceanic lateen sail mounted to an un-stayed mast.

Sunfish was developed by Alcort, Inc. and first appeared around 1952 as the &quot;next generation&quot; improvement on their original boat, the Sailfish. In contrast, the Sunfish has a wider beam for more stability, increased freeboard and the addition of a foot-well for a more comfortable sailing position. Sunfish began as a wood hull design and progressed to fiberglass construction just a few years after its introduction.

Having a lateen sail with its simple two line rigging makes a Sunfish simple to learn sailing on and to set up. Upgrades can be added to enhance sail control for competitive sailing, making the boat attractive to both novice and experienced sailors alike.

Due to the broad appeal of the Sunfish, in 1995 it was commended by the American Sailboat Hall of Fame for being &quot;the most popular fiberglass boat ever designed, with a quarter million sold worldwide&quot; (at that point in time).

Early in 2016, manufacturer Laser Performance moved production from Portsmouth, Rhode Island, US to China and boats were supplied to the 2016 World Championships.

In 2017, Laser Performance (LP) announced the creation of a new governing body to manage the Sunfish Class, the International Sunfish Class Organization (ISCO), after the International Sunfish Class Association (ISCA), governing body since 1969, refused to sign a trademark agreement. In response the ISCA, still the World Sailing recognised Class Association, have announced rule changes which permit alternative suppliers to Laser Performance for some components.

In 2024, ISCA approved Zim Sailing as the new exclusive builder of class-approved boats.

Today, the Sunfish brand-name has become so widely known it is often misapplied generically to refer to any brand of board-style boat sporting the characteristic crab claw sail.

In February 2025 SERO Innovation officially became the exclusive global manufacturer of the Sunfish sailboat. 

==Design==
The distinctive low-aspect ratio lateen sail gives the Sunfish an anachronistic appearance compared with today&#x27;s more familiar high-aspect ratio Bermuda rig sailboats. However, this sail plan is not as old-world as it might first appear. Using a lateen rig for this style boat shifts the advantage toward better performance in lighter air (less than 4 on the Beaufort scale) and contributes to it having good down-wind characteristics.

The hull’s very mild &quot;V&quot; bottom and hard chine make Sunfish a most stable boat for its size, along with enabling it to sail on a plane (hydroplane). Planing allows the boat achieve a speed greater than theoretical hull speed based on length at waterline (LWL). Having a down-wind performance advantage helps the Sunfish achieve a planing attitude at lower wind speeds than its high-aspect ratio sail plan counterparts.

Designed as a water-tight, hollow-body pontoon, a hull like the Sunfish is sometimes referred to as &quot;self-rescuing&quot; because the boat can be capsized and its cockpit swamped without threat of the boat sinking.

==History==

===Beginnings of Alcort, Inc.===
In 1945, Alex Bryan and Cortlandt Heyniger created the Alcort company to produce their first boat design, the Sailfish. Originally framing carpenters by trade, these two entrepreneurs began their sailcraft endeavors building iceboats as a sideline. A proposal to build a lifesaving paddleboard for the Red Cross came their way. They determined the concept unfeasible as it stood. An improved design sporting a sailing canoe sail rig did however strike a spark as a possible profit making venture. From that humble beginning the Sailfish was born. After Bryan&#x27;s wife, Aileen Bryan, suggested a boat with a small cockpit where she could put her feet, the design was updated to the Sunfish.
===The kit boat niche===
The first Sailfish were offered in the form of detailed drawings for the backyard builder or as a finished, ready-to-sail boat, built by the Alcort shop. In the course of growing their business, Cortlandt and Alex had the revelation to kit the boat by supplying pre-cut pieces, all the necessary fittings, and inclusion of the sail thereby making backyard construction more appealing to an even wider range of would-be boat builders. Sunfish first appeared as either a DIY kit or a finished boat. Of the two designs, only the Sailfish was originally a blueprint plan boat.

===Waypoints===
* For the 1960 model year, Sunfish became available in a fiberglass version for the first time. Alcort shop-built wood boats were phased out around the same period, however, the Sunfish kit boat remained available through the late 1960s.
* 1971 found a storage compartment added to the rear of the cockpit.
* 1972 model saw a revision of the rudder blade&#x27;s shape, the rudder&#x27;s gudgeon and pintle, a new shape daggerboard, and a switch to a Sunfish designed cockpit bailer. This was a turning point for those pieces of equipment, thereafter referred as &quot;New Style&quot; by owners of Sunfish from that era.
* Every few years, hardware and sometimes cosmetics and/or sail colors evolve, adding a piece or two of something more contemporary to replace outdated technology or style.
* In 1969, when AMF took over Sunfish production from Alcort, Inc., one of the expansion strategies was to form the Sunfish (racing) Class Association to help promote the boat through organized sailing competition.
* In 1989 the fused deck to hull joint was changed from a ½&quot; flat lip protected by an aluminum trim strip to the increased surface area of a rounded gunwale, now more securely bonded using a methacrylate adhesive specially suited for fiberglass.
* Sail geometry has changed on a couple of occasions, most significantly in 1989 when the &quot;Racing Sail&quot;, still 75 ft2 &quot;sail area&quot;, but with deeper draft, was made available as an option.
* In 2010 the last of the Sunfish&#x27;s wood attributes were superseded when first the rudder and now this year the tiller were changed from wood components to fiberglass and aluminum respectively.
* The Sunfish was inducted into the American Sailboat Hall of Fame in 1995.
* Since its introduction in 1952, Sunfish has come under the stewardship of seven successive builders (see Sunfish Builder Chronology below).
===Sunfish builder chronology===
==Sunfish in racing==
For most One-Design Class eligible boats, the number of boats built and the number of boats registered in the racing class are closely related. This makes the boat and the racing Class practically one and the same. The Sunfish is an anomaly to this more familiar symbiotic relationship.

The Sunfish Class Association reported in 2001 that Sunfish production had exceeded 300,000 boats. The registrar for One Design sailing in the United States, US Sailing, reported in a 2004 survey that Sunfish Class membership numbered 1,573. This does not mean Sunfish isn’t a preferred race boat. On the contrary, at 1,573 Class members, Sunfish ranks in the upper percentile of boats involved with organized racing in the U.S. It does, however, demonstrate the boat’s above average versatility to suit a broader range of sailing applications.

===Fun racing===
Recreational, &quot;friendly competition&quot; played a key role in establishing the renowned popularity of the Alcort boat designs. Events of past and present, such as the Connecticut River race, Seattle&#x27;s Duck Dodge, and the Hampton Roads Sunfish Challenge &amp; Dinghy Distance Race, now in its 10th year, serve as examples of the sort of fun Sunfish sailors have without getting too serious.

===Open class racing===
Sunfish sailors who are more serious about sailing competitions, but who do not have the advantage of a nearby Sunfish fleet, can race their boat against nearly any other make and model of sailboat in &quot;open class&quot; events using a handicap system. Sunfish have a base-line Portsmouth handicap of 99.6.

===One-design racing (ISCA)===
One-design racing uses nearly identical boats so the competition is based purely on sailing skill. One Design Classes are watched over by a governing body who assure conformity.

:The International Sunfish Class Association – development

:* In 1969 AMF was instrumental in forming the Sunfish (racing) Class Association.
:* In 1984 the Sunfish Class became recognized by the International Yacht Racing Union, today known as the International Sailing Federation (ISAF).
:* A year later the Sunfish Class went independent as the International Sunfish Class Association (ISCA).
:* Sunfish gained Pan American Games status in 1999 and has maintained recognition in the following years.
:* International Masters was held outside the United States, in the Netherlands, for the first time in 2005.
:* There are three continental and nine national championships regularly.
:* Sunfish fleets are active in 28 countries around the globe.
===Sunfish 60th anniversary===
To celebrate 60 years of the Sunfish, current builder Laser Performance designed a 60th anniversary edition of the Sunfish to celebrate the diverse history of the boat and the sailors who love it. Laser Performance also hosted a Sunfish 60th anniversary celebration at Noyes Pond in Massachusetts, the home of Sunfish designer Al Bryan, which gathered over 100 people sailing old and new Sunfish.

==Super Sunfish==
In the 1960s, a member of the New Canaan, Conn. Sunfish Fleet, John Black Lee, independently experimented with a conventional sail rig for the Sunfish. He developed a high-aspect ratio sail that worked on the Sunfish hull and christened his design the Formula S. The high aspect ratio sail plan has better upwind performance characteristics over the lateen sail, changing the boat&#x27;s handling to point more like other Bermuda rig sailboats in its size. With this configuration, complexity of sail control is elevated by the addition of dynamic outhaul, downhaul, and mainsheet traveller lines.

Lee&#x27;s concept didn&#x27;t interest Alcort, Inc. as a production model so he refit conversion boats independently and sparked organization of Formula S fleets. A few years after their 1969 purchase of Alcort, Inc., AMF revisited the idea of a high aspect ratio rig for the Sunfish. AMF did not choose to adopt Lee&#x27;s Formula S design, but they did develop their own variation, calling it the Super Sunfish. The existing Formula S fleet eventually became assimilated into the ranks of AMF Super Sunfish fleets.

The Super Sunfish was available from 1974 to 1984. AMF marketed this more conventional sail plan as a performance version of the Sunfish in an attempt to compete with, among others, the newly emerging Laser. Portsmouth handicap numbers, however, place the Laser slightly faster. With its hard chine hull, the Super Sunfish is the more stable boat, so it is a tradeoff between the two designs.

The Super Sunfish was offered as a complete package and as a kit to retrofit existing lateen rigged Sunfish. The literature points out the sail systems can be easily swapped on a single Sunfish hull to accommodate different sailors&#x27; preferences.

<text>Canaima National Park () is a park in south-eastern Venezuela that roughly occupies the same area as the Gran Sabana region. It is located in Bolívar State, reaching the borders with Brazil and Guyana. The park was named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

==History==
Canaima National Park was established on 12 June 1962.
As early as 1990, the countries that participate in the Amazonian Cooperation Treaty had recommended expanding the Canaima National Park southward to connect it with Monte Roraima National Park in Brazil, with coordinated management of tourism, research and conservation.

In 1994, the Canaima National Park was named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The International Union for Conservation of Nature performed a conservation assessment in 2017, which listed Canaima National Park as an area of significant concern, citing ineffective protection and management.

==Location==

Canaima National Park is the second largest park in Venezuela, after Parima-Tapirapecó, and sixth biggest national park in the world. It is roughly the same size as Belgium or Maryland. The park protects part of the Guayanan Highlands moist forests ecoregion.

About 65% of the park is occupied by plateaus of rock called tepuis, which are a kind of table-top mountain millions of years old, with vertical walls and almost flat tops. These constitute a unique biological environment and are also of great geological interest. Their sheer cliffs and waterfalls including Angel Falls, which is the highest waterfall in the world, at .

The most famous tepuis in the park are Mount Roraima, the tallest and easiest to climb, and Auyantepui, the site of Angel Falls. The tepuis are sandstone and date back to a time when South America and Africa were part of a super-continent.

The park is home to indigenous Pemon Indians, part of the Carib linguistic group. The Pemon have an intimate relationship with the tepuis, and believe they are the home of the &#x27;Mawari&#x27; spirits. The park is relatively remote, with only a few roads connecting towns. Most transport within the park is done by light plane from the airstrips built by various Capuchin missions, or by foot and canoe.

== Fauna ==

Canaima has a varied fauna, which is distributed throughout the park according to multiple environmental factors such as altitude and vegetation type. Among the species found are:

* Giant armadillo (&quot;Priodontes maximus&quot;)
* Giant otter (&quot;Pteronura brasiliensis&quot;)
* Giant anteater (&quot;Myrmecophaga tridactyla&quot;)
* Cougar (&quot;Puma concolor&quot;)
* Jaguar (&quot;Panthera onca&quot;)
* Linnaeus&#x27;s two-toed sloth (&quot;Choloepus didactylus&quot;)
* White-faced saki (&quot;Pithecia pithecia&quot;)
* Brown-backed bearded saki (&quot;Chiropotes israelita&quot;)
* Roraima mouse (&quot;Podoxymys roraimae&quot;)
* Tyleria mouse opossum (&quot;Marmosa tyleriana&quot;)
* Harpy eagle (&quot;Harpia harpyja&quot;)
* Red-shouldered macaw (&quot;Diopsittaca nobilis&quot;)
* Dusky parrot (&quot;Pionus fuscus&quot;)
* Yellow-banded poison dart frog (&quot;Dendrobates leucomelas&quot;)
* Green iguana (&quot;Iguana iguana&quot;)
* Hummingbirds (Trochilinae)
* Toucans (Ramphastidae)
* South American bushmaster (&quot;Lachesis muta&quot;)
* Green acouchi (&quot;Myoprocta pratti&quot;)
* Bush dog (&quot;Speothos venaticus&quot;)
Canaima National Park is among one of several dozen regions in Venezuela that has been identified as an Important Bird and Biodiversity Area (IBAs) by BirdLife International, a global cooperative of non-governmental organizations focused on the conservation of the world’s birds and their natural habitats.

== Flora ==

There are over 300 botanical species endemic only to La Gran Sabana.
* Endemic flora includes &quot;Achnopogon, Adenanthe&quot;, &quot;Chimantaea&quot;, &quot;Mallophyton,&quot; &quot;Quelchia&quot;, &quot;Tepuia&quot;.
* Endemic carnivorous plants include the &quot;Heliamphora&quot; (South American pitcher plants) and &quot;Brocchinia&quot; (a type of bromeliad), as well as several local species of &quot;Drosera&quot; (sundews), &quot;Genlisea&quot; (corkscrew plants) and &quot;Utricularia&quot; (bladderworts).

== Hydrography ==

The park includes the entire watershed of the right bank of the Caroní River and two of the highest waterfalls in the world, the Angel Falls and the Kukenán, as well as plenty of waterfalls of lower altitude.

== Land forms ==

The only land form are the tepuis, that are plateaus which are unique features, among which are its vertical and nearly flat tops, although there are several tepuies that do not meet these rules. Geologically are remnants of a sedimentary cover composed of very ancient sandstone that is superimposed on a base of igneous rocks (mainly granite) that is even older (nearly 3 billion years). On its summit is home to a substantial amount of specific endemic species, both plant and animal. Some endemic plant species are categorized as &quot;carnivorous&quot;, which are thus the food supply (mainly insects) that are so scarce in the mountains. These have a geological formations ranging between 1.5 and 2 billion years, which makes them one of the oldest formations in the world. The best known tepuies are: the Auyantepuy (where it follows the Angel Falls), the Roraima, the Kukenan and the Chimantá among many others.

== Tourist attractions ==

=== Western Sector ===
=== Eastern Sector ===

Canaima National Park is spread in south-eastern Venezuela along the border between Guyana and Brazil. The best-known feature of Canaima National Park is its characteristic flat-topped mountain formations known as &#x27;tepuis&#x27; which cover roughly 65% of the park. The tepuis constitute a unique biogeological entity and are of great geological interest.

As of 1993, Canaima National Park was reported to receive approximately 100,000 tourists every year, with 90% visiting its plateaus. Only a select few of its tepuis are accessible to visitors, with those including Roraima and Auyán-tepui. Angel Falls is also a popular tourist spot, where visitors can canoe through the park’s vast rainforest.

== Popular culture ==
Canaima is the name given to the fictional Californian coastal town where the movie Arachnophobia is supposed to take place.

<text>West Side Park was the name used for two different ballparks that formerly stood in Chicago, Illinois. They were both home fields of the team now known as the Chicago Cubs of the National League. Both ballparks hosted baseball championships. The latter of the two parks, where the franchise played for nearly a quarter century, was the home of the first two world champion Cubs teams ( and ), the team that posted the best winning percentage in Major League Baseball history and won the most games in National League history (), the only cross-town World Series in Chicago (1906), and the immortalized Tinker to Evers to Chance double-play combo. Both ballparks were primarily constructed of wood.

==The first West Side Park (1885–1891)==

The initial stadium was the club&#x27;s home beginning in , succeeding Lakefront Park. Although the park&#x27;s useful life turned out to be as short as the ball club&#x27;s stay at the Lakefront (seven years), it was also memorable, as the team won back-to-back National League pennants in its first two seasons there.

The park was located on a small block bounded by Congress (north, left field), Loomis (west, center field), Harrison (south, right field) and Throop (east, home plate) Streets. The elongated shape of the block lent a bathtub-like shape to the park, with foul lines reportedly as short as . The stadium held roughly 10,000 fans. In addition to the diamond, the park held a bicycle track which encircled the playing field, at the height of the contemporary bicycle craze.

The lumber from the stands at the lakefront ballpark was disassembled and reconfigured as the new stands at West Side Park.

The Cubs (then known as the White Stockings) had had to secure a new property after , and it took longer than anticipated. The season began on April 30, a month later than it does today, for a 112-game schedule, 50 fewer games than today&#x27;s major-league schedule. The club spent the first five-plus weeks of the 1885 season on the road, and the park was finally opened on June 6 with a victory over the St. Louis Maroons, late of the Union Association. Despite being &quot;wanderers&quot; early in the season, the powerful Chicago club, under player-manager Cap Anson, came home with an 18–6 record. They would sweep a four-game set in their first homestand and romp through the league schedule, finishing at 87–25. The only team that gave them any problem was the New York Giants, who won 10 of the clubs&#x27; 16 meetings and finished just two games behind Chicago in the standings. If projected to a modern 162-game schedule, that translates to 125 and 123 wins, respectively, in a very lopsided league (the third-place club finished 30 games back).

Chicago captured the National League pennant that season and also went on to win the league crown in 1886. The site saw postseason action those two years, as the White Stockings squared off in 19th-century World Series play against the St. Louis Cardinals, then playing in the rival American Association and known as the St. Louis Browns. The championships of the 1880s were disorganized in comparison to the modern World Series, exemplified by the 1885 contest, which ended in dispute with no clear winner. The 1886 World Series was more conventional, and was won by the Browns. Those matchups were the first on-field confrontations of the Cubs and Cardinals clubs, which remains one of baseball&#x27;s strongest rivalries today.

The site also saw &quot;bonus baseball&quot; in 1887, as a neutral site for Game 14 of that year&#x27;s unique 15-game &quot;traveling&quot; World Series between the Browns and the Detroit Wolverines. In 1891 the team split its schedule between West Side Park and South Side Park (II). The first West Side Park was abandoned after the 1891 season, with the team playing at home exclusively on the South Side in 1892.

The site of the first West Side Park is now occupied by the Andrew Jackson Language Academy, whose address is 1340 West Harrison.

===Capacity and Dimensions===


Information about the dimensions is contradictory in local newspapers. In the reports of the opening game of June 6, 1885, when Chicago player George Gore homered near the right field corner, the St. Louis Maroons complained (or &quot;kicked&quot;, in popular slang of the time) that the foul line was shorter than the minimum allowed, . A yard tape measure was then used to painstakingly measure the distance while the crowd booed. The exact result was reported differently. One paper quoted Chicago club owner Albert Spalding as stating the distance to be , implicitly confirmed by the measurement.[Chicago &quot;Tribune&quot;, June 7, 1885, p. 14] Another paper reported that the distance was found to be .[Chicago &quot;Inter Ocean&quot;, June 7, 1885, p. 3]

However, upon the announcement of West Side Park (II) in 1893, the new park&#x27;s foul lines were stated to be , &quot; further than the old west side fence.&quot; [Chicago &quot;Inter Ocean&quot;, April 16, 1893, p. 8] That would indicate distances of at West Side Park (I).

==The second West Side Park (1893–1915)==
The second West Side Park was a few blocks west-southwest of the first one, on a larger block bounded by Taylor, Wood, Polk and Lincoln (renamed Wolcott in 1939) Streets. It was located at . 

A ballpark on the site was first constructed in 1888 for the Garden City Athletic Club. (Chicago is &quot;The Garden City&quot;.) It was also the part-time home of the Chicago Maroons minor league club that year. The Maroons&#x27; first game on the new lot came on May 5, 1888. During the next few years, the ballpark hosted a variety of Chicago City League ball games and other events. 

On May 14, 1893, the National League club played their first game at West Side Park (II). During May and June, they split their schedule with South Side Park (II), playing Sunday games on the West Side and weekday games on the South Side. By mid-summer they had abandoned the South Side park and moved into the West Side park full-time.

Home plate for this ballpark was in the northwest corner of the property, toward the Polk and Lincoln intersection. The right field fence paralleled Taylor, with flat apartments between the alley behind the right field area, and Taylor itself. There were also flats across Wood Street to the east, behind left field, giving the park (for a few years, at least) a degree of the ambiance that Wrigley Field would later be famous for. Cook County Hospital was across Polk Street to the north, behind third base. Like the first West Side ballpark, the new facility was restricted by the streets around it, creating a rectangular playing area.

The field layout was reported in the &quot;Inter Ocean&quot; on April 16, 1893: &quot;The diamond is from the grand stand, and the right and left field fences are from the home plate, further than the old west side fence. The distance from the home plate to the extreme center field is . The club will play all their Sunday games at the new grounds during the World&#x27;s Fair, and after the fair is closed will probably play all their games there.&quot;

An artist&#x27;s conception of the new field includes a rooftop tier of private seating on the grandstand, and roofed bleachers beyond first and third base. Photographs from the early 1900s suggest those plans were left dormant until starting in 1905, when the team began playing well and expansion of the ballpark seating was begun.

Although the 340-560-340 sounds symmetrical, the left field side was much more spacious, and the distance to center was actually very deep left-center, possibly the far corner of the property.

The original layout of the park seated about 12,500 patrons. As with other parks of the era, fans were often permitted to stand along the outer perimeter of the playing field itself. When the team began playing winning ball under Frank Chance, overflow crowds became more frequent.

On August 5, 1894, during its first full season as home to the Cubs (at that point known as the Colts), West Side Park suffered severe damage from fire during a game against the Cincinnati Reds. As the fire spread through the first-base side stands, panicked fans trying to escape pressed up against the barbed wire fence separating them from the playing field. Only quick action by several players in wrenching the fence open averted a major tragedy. The burnt stands were simply roped off, and the season resumed the next day, with the burnt area fenced off, and the spectators sitting on the left side of the diamond. Despite that near-disaster, the club rebuilt the burnt portion out of wood.

One highlight, albeit for the visitors, occurred on July 13, 1896, when Philadelphia Phillies outfielder/firstbaseman Ed Delahanty smacked four home runs in one game, only the second player to do so. In contrast to Bobby Lowe&#x27;s feat two years earlier, which was aided by a short foul line, two of Delahanty&#x27;s were inside-the-park. After Delahanty&#x27;s third, center fielder Bill Lange drew a laugh by calling &quot;time&quot;, stationing himself in deep-deep center, near the clubhouse, seemingly a mile away, and then waving the pitcher to continue. Delahanty then got the laugh on Lange by knocking it between the clubhouse and the fence, again circling the bases while Lange scurried for the ball. The normally partisan home fans cheered Delahanty&#x27;s effort. Chicago got the last laugh, winning the game, 9–8.

As the park entered the new century, it featured a small covered grandstand behind home plate. Behind the home plate stands, the team and ticket offices were housed in a fairly ornate two-story brick building topped with statues of baseball players. Uncovered bleachers extended along both foul lines and into left field. Beyond left-center field, the bleachers gave way to a small clubhouse. The right-field bleachers were only nine rows deep, sitting underneath a free-standing billboard that ran above the length of the bleachers. The billboard frequently featured large ads for the sports pages and the sportswriters of local newspapers such as the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot;. A scoreboard was located on the extreme right end of the billboard, toward the right field corner. Much like today at Wrigley Field, several of the rooftops beyond the outfield bleachers offered bleacher seating of their own, at least for a few years.

The second West Side Park was the home of the Cubs&#x27; most successful teams of the 20th century. From 1906 through 1910, the Cubs won four National League pennants and two World Series championships. The 1906 World Series between the Cubs and the Chicago White Sox featured the first cross-town matchup in Series history. Although the Cubs had one of the most successful seasons in major league history, winning 116 contests against just 36 losses, they were defeated by the light-hitting White Sox four games to two. The Cubs finally brought a championship to West Side Park the following year when they swept the Detroit Tigers after ending the first contest in a tie. In 1908, West Side Park became the home of the first repeat world champions when the Cubs again bested the Tigers. After a one-year absence, the Cubs returned to the Series in 1910, only to lose in five games to the Philadelphia Athletics. The 1908 championship 
turned out to be the franchise&#x27;s last World Series championship until 2016, ending a staggering 108-year drought for the franchise.

The ballpark expanded with the club&#x27;s rising fortunes. For 1905, several rows of private box seats were built on top of the original grandstand roof behind home plate. That same year saw the construction of a new two-story brick clubhouse structure, fronted by columns, out in far left-center. After just two seasons, jury-box bleachers were built directly in front of and over the clubhouse. During the 1908 season, the bleachers along the first and third-base lines were gradually covered and topped by more private box seating.

By the early 1910s the wooden ballpark was showing its age, in large part due to neglect by Charles Murphy, the unpopular owner of the Cubs (one of whose alternate, media-driven nicknames was the unflattering &quot;Murphy&#x27;s Spuds&quot;). In 1910, the neighborhood view beyond the nearby right field bleachers was blocked off by an enormous billboard. In 1912, the more distant left field view was similarly obstructed by a large billboard, which also served as the new scoreboard. The enclosure of the park was completed with the installment of billboards in dead center. At this time, the jury box bleachers in left-center field were removed, adding to the new claustrophobic feel of the outfield. With gambling becoming an increasing problem in baseball, starting in 1911 the playing field was adorned with large signs (as with some other major league ballparks) reminding both fans and players, &quot;No Betting Allowed.&quot; Additionally, the dilapidated park found itself competing unsuccessfully with new steel-and-concrete baseball venues. The Chicago White Sox inaugurated Comiskey Park in 1910. Four years later, the upstart Federal League placed a franchise on the North Side and began play in Weeghman Park. By 1915, the Cubs were the third most popular team in a three-team city.

When the Federal League collapsed after the 1915 season, Charles Weeghman, owner of the now-defunct Chicago Whales, was allowed to buy a substantial interest in the Cubs. One of his first acts was to abandon West Side Park and move the Cubs to Weeghman Park for the 1916 season. Weeghman Park survives today as Wrigley Field.

One of the few items the Cubs took with them, besides normal operational properties, was a set of large letters comprising a sign that had run across the back of the grandstand and was to be read from the outside of the park: &quot;&quot;. This sign was placed along the top of the Weeghman Park wall bordering Sheffield Avenue, visible to everyone in the park, and of course reading &quot;backwards&quot; to the spectators. This oddity lasted a few years at Weeghman / Cubs Park until it was brought down during an early remodeling.

West Side Park continued to host semipro and amateur baseball events for a few years. It even served as a setting for &quot;Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West&quot;, thus converting the entire former ballfield into a different kind of &quot;bull pen&quot;. The ballpark was torn down in 1920. Murphy, who still owned the property, sold the leftover lumber for scrap. He sold the property itself to the University of Illinois. The site is now occupied by the University of Illinois Medical Center.

This West Side Park was the only park that witnessed the Cubs as World Series Champions from 1908 to 2016. The Cubs won back-to-back titles here in 1907 and 1908. In June 1909, a flag-raising ceremony was held, celebrating the Cubs second consecutive World Series. Newspaper reporters commented that the crowd seemed less enthused than they had the previous summer, as if they were getting complacent: &quot;Chicago fans are a peculiar lot... When the Cubs raised their title banner last year there were big doings. This year it seemed to be an old story.&quot;[Chicago Tribune, June 17, 1909, p.4]

<doc id="1297539" wikidata="Q1454200" url="?curid=1297539" title="Free particle">
<text>In physics, a free particle is a particle that, in some sense, is not bound by an external force, or equivalently not in a region where its potential energy varies. In classical physics, this means the particle is present in a &quot;field-free&quot; space. In quantum mechanics, it means the particle is in a region of uniform potential, usually set to zero in the region of interest since the potential can be arbitrarily set to zero at any point in space.

==Classical free particle==

The classical free particle is characterized by a fixed velocity v. The momentum is given by
formula_1
and the kinetic energy (equal to total energy) by
formula_2
where &quot;m&quot; is the mass of the particle and v is the vector velocity of the particle.

==Quantum free particle==

===Mathematical description===

A free particle with mass formula_3 in non-relativistic quantum mechanics is described by the free Schrödinger equation:
formula_4

where &quot;ψ&quot; is the wavefunction of the particle at position r and time &quot;t&quot;. The solution for a particle with momentum p or wave vector k, at angular frequency &quot;ω&quot; or energy &quot;E&quot;, is given by a complex plane wave:

formula_5

with amplitude &quot;A&quot; and has two different rules according to its mass: 
The eigenvalue spectrum is infinitely degenerate since for each eigenvalue &quot;E&quot;&gt;0, there corresponds an infinite number of eigenfunctions corresponding to different directions of formula_6. 

The De Broglie relations: formula_7, formula_8 apply. Since the potential energy is (stated to be) zero, the total energy &quot;E&quot; is equal to the kinetic energy, which has the same form as in classical physics: 

formula_9

As for &quot;all&quot; quantum particles free &quot;or&quot; bound, the Heisenberg uncertainty principles formula_10 apply. It is clear that since the plane wave has definite momentum (definite energy), the probability of finding the particle&#x27;s location is uniform and negligible all over the space. In other words, the wave function is not normalizable in a Euclidean space, &quot;these stationary states can not correspond to physical realizable states&quot;.

===Measurement and calculations===
The normalization condition for the wave function states that if a wavefunction belongs to the quantum state space 
formula_11
then the integral of the probability density function
formula_12

where * denotes complex conjugate, over all space is the probability of finding the particle in all space, which must be unity if the particle exists:
formula_13
The state of a free particle given by plane wave solutions is &quot;not&quot; normalizable as
formula_14
for any fixed time formula_15. Using wave packets, however, the states can be expressed as functions that &quot;are&quot; normalizable.

===Wave packet===

Using the Fourier inversion theorem, the free particle wave function may be represented by a superposition of &quot;momentum&quot; eigenfunctions, or, &quot;wave packet&quot;:
formula_16
where 
formula_17
and formula_18 is the Fourier transform of a &quot;sufficiently nice&quot; initial wavefunction formula_19. 

The expectation value of the momentum p for the complex plane wave is

formula_20

and for the general wave packet it is

formula_21

The expectation value of the energy E is 

formula_22

===Group velocity and phase velocity===

The phase velocity is defined to be the speed at which a plane wave solution propagates, namely

formula_23

Note that formula_24 is &quot;not&quot; the speed of a classical particle with momentum formula_25; rather, it is half of the classical velocity.

Meanwhile, suppose that the initial wave function formula_26 is a wave packet whose Fourier transform formula_27 is concentrated near a particular wave vector formula_28. Then the group velocity of the plane wave is defined as
formula_29

which agrees with the formula for the classical velocity of the particle. The group velocity is the (approximate) speed at which the whole wave packet propagates, while the phase velocity is the speed at which the individual peaks in the wave packet move. The figure illustrates this phenomenon, with the individual peaks within the wave packet propagating at half the speed of the overall packet.

===Spread of the wave packet===
The notion of group velocity is based on a linear approximation to the dispersion relation formula_30 near a particular value of formula_31. In this approximation, the amplitude of the wave packet moves at a velocity equal to the group velocity &quot;without changing shape&quot;. This result is an approximation that fails to capture certain interesting aspects of the evolution a free quantum particle. Notably, the width of the wave packet, as measured by the uncertainty in the position, grows linearly in time for large times. This phenomenon is called the spread of the wave packet for a free particle.

Specifically, it is not difficult to compute an exact formula for the uncertainty formula_32 as a function of time, where formula_33 is the position operator. Working in one spatial dimension for simplicity, we have:
formula_34
where formula_26 is the time-zero wave function. The expression in parentheses in the second term on the right-hand side is the quantum covariance of formula_33 and formula_37.

Thus, for large positive times, the uncertainty in formula_33 grows linearly, with the coefficient of formula_15 equal to formula_40. If the momentum of the initial wave function formula_26 is highly localized, the wave packet will spread slowly and the group-velocity approximation will remain good for a long time. Intuitively, this result says that if the initial wave function has a very sharply defined momentum, then the particle has a sharply defined velocity and will (to good approximation) propagate at this velocity for a long time.

<text>General Joseph Lawton Collins (1 May 1896 – 12 September 1987) was a senior United States Army officer. During World War II, he served in both the Pacific and European Theaters of Operations, one of a few senior American commanders to do so. He was Chief of Staff of the United States Army during the Korean War.

Collins&#x27; elder brother, Major General James Lawton Collins, was also in the United States Army. His nephew, Brigadier General James Lawton Collins Jr. served in World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War. Another nephew, Michael Collins, was the command module pilot on the Apollo 11 mission in 1969 that put the first two men on the Moon and retired from the United States Air Force as a major general.

==Early life and military career==
Joseph Lawton Collins was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, on, on 1 May 1896, the tenth of eleven children (five boys, six girls) of the large Irish Catholic family of New Orleans dry goods store and pub owner Jeremiah Bernard Collins and Catherine (Lawton) Collins. He attended the Catholic schools of Algiers and graduated from Boys High School in New Orleans in 1912.

Collins attended Louisiana State University and competed for a congressional appointment to the United States Military Academy (USMA) at West Point, New York. Selected as an alternate by Representative H. Garland Dupré, Collins received the appointment after the first choice failed to qualify. He followed in the footsteps of his older brother James Lawton Collins, who graduated in 1907. He attended from 14 June 1913 to April 1917, with his class graduating early because of the American entry into World War I. He graduated 35th of 139, and was commissioned shortly before his twenty-first birthday. His classmates included several future general officers, including Matthew Ridgway, Bryant Moore, Ernest N. Harmon, William C. McMahon, Norman Cota, Laurence B. Keiser, William W. Eagles, William Kelly Harrison Jr., Frederick Augustus Irving, and Mark W. Clark. 

Commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 22nd Infantry, Collins was assigned as a platoon and later company commander. He was promoted to first lieutenant 15 May 1917, and temporary captain on 5 August. He attended the United States Army Infantry School of Arms at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, and served with the regiment at various locations between 1917 and 1919. He was promoted to captain in June 1918, and to temporary major in September, and took command of the 3rd Battalion, 22nd Infantry Regiment the following month. World War I came to an end soon afterwards, on 11 November 1918. Unable to fight overseas during the war, Collins commanded the 3rd Battalion, 18th Infantry Regiment in France in June 1919, and was assistant chief of staff, as a G-3 staff officer with the American Forces in Germany from 1920 to 1921. During this time, Collins served in the Army of Occupation in Germany.

==Between the wars==
Collins reverted to the rank of captain on 10 March 1919. He married Gladys Easterbrook, a daughter of Protestant Army chaplain Edmund P. Easterbrook, in Coblenz on 15 July 1921, and was instructor in the department of chemistry at the USMA from 26 August 1921 to 18 June 1925. He graduated from the company officer course at the United States Army Infantry School at Fort Benning, Georgia in 1926, and from the advanced course at the United States Army Field Artillery School at Fort Sill, Oklahoma the year after. He was an instructor in weapons and tactics at the United States Army Infantry School from 1927 to 1931. It was during this time where he first encountered George C. Marshall, the future U.S. Army Chief of Staff, who was to play a significant role in Collins&#x27;s future military career. Promoted to major in August 1932, he was executive officer of the 23rd Brigade in Manila, and assistant chief of staff, as a G-2 staff officer, with the Philippine Division from 6 August 1933 to 8 May 1934.

Collins graduated from the United States Army Industrial College in 1937, and the United States Army War College the following year. He was then an instructor at the Army War College from 1938 to 1940. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 25 June 1940 and, now a full colonel (having been promoted on 15 January 1941), was chief of staff of VII Corps in 1941.

==World War II==
By the time the United States entered World War II in December 1941, Collins had been a temporary colonel since January. He was promoted to the one-star general officer rank of brigadier general on 14 February 1942, and the two-star general officer rank of major general on 26 May.

=== Pacific theater ===

Collins was chief of staff of the Hawaiian Department from 1941 to 1942 and served as the Commanding General of the 25th Infantry Division—nicknamed the &quot;Tropic Lightning&quot; Division—on Oahu and in operations against the Japanese on Guadalcanal between 1942 and 1943 and on New Georgia from July to October 1943. He was awarded Distinguished Service Medal for his service with the Hawaiian Department. At the time of his appointment on 6 May 1942 he was the youngest division commander in the United States Army, aged 46. To serve as his assistant division commander, Collins specifically selected Brigadier General John R. Hodge, a decision he never came to regret as Hodge, who later became a full general, proved himself to be up to Collins&#x27;s high standards.

It was during the campaign in Guadalcanal that Collins gained his nickname of &quot;Lightning Joe&quot;, for his dash and aggression. It was also during this campaign that saw Collins awarded with the Distinguished Service Medal, Legion of Merit and the Silver Star, the citation for which reads:

=== Western theater ===
Collins was later transferred to the European Theater of Operations (ETO), where he commanded the VII Corps in the Allied invasion of Normandy and on the Western Front through to the end of World War II in Europe in May 1945. Collins was chosen by Lieutenant General Omar Bradley, who had served with Collins at the Army Infantry School before the war and was then commanding the First Army in England, as a replacement for Major General Roscoe B. Woodruff, the original commander of VII Corps and one of Bradley&#x27;s West Point classmates. Woodruff was senior to Collins but had no experience in amphibious operations. Collins was appointed after a brief interview with Bradley and General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander, about his combat experience after Collins summed up his tactical approach in the Pacific as always targeting the high ground in an attack. Bradley turned to Eisenhower, claiming that Collins &quot;talks our language.&quot; At the age of 47, this made Collins the youngest corps commander in the United States Army. Among the units serving under Collins&#x27; command in Normandy was the veteran 82nd Airborne Division, commanded by Major General Matthew Ridgway, a fellow graduate of the West Point class of 1917.

VII Corps played a major role in the Normandy landings in June 1944 and the subsequent Battle of Normandy, including Operation Cobra. Collins was a favorite of the 21st Army Group commander, General Sir Bernard Montgomery, who after Operation Goodwood laid the path for VII Corps to break out in Operation Cobra on 27 July 1944. After Cobra was the Battle of the Falaise Pocket, which completed the destruction of the Wehrmacht in Normandy, the corps then took part in the liberation of Paris and the Allied advance from Paris to the Rhine. In early September VII Corps took approximately 25,000 prisoners during the Battle of the Mons Pocket. It later broke through the Siegfried Line and endured heavy fighting in the Battle of Hürtgen Forest. VII Corps later played a major role in the Battle of the Bulge, the largest battle on the Western Front during World War II, and finally took part in the Western Allied invasion of Germany. VII Corps is perhaps best known for the leading role it played in Operation Cobra; less well known is Collins&#x27; contribution to that plan.

One of the few senior United States commanders to fight in both Europe and the Pacific, against the Germans and Japanese respectively, Collins contrasted the nature of the enemy in the two theaters of war:
Collins was promoted to temporary three-star rank of lieutenant general in April 1945 and permanent brigadier general in June. He was very highly regarded by General Omar Bradley, Collins&#x27; superior for most of the war, and many German senior commanders believed Collins, along with Lieutenant General Troy H. Middleton, commanding the VIII Corps, to be one of the best American corps commanders on the Western Front. Bradley commented that &quot;Had we created another ETO Army, despite his youth and lack of seniority, Collins certainly would have been named the commander.&quot; For his service during the war Collins was three times awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal, twice awarded the Silver Star and twice the Legion of Merit. Numbering among his foreign awards and decorations, the Soviet Union awarded Collins the Order of Suvorov Second Class twice while serving as Commanding General, VII Corps.

==Postwar==
After the war, Collins was deputy commanding general and chief of staff of Army Ground Forces from August to December 1945. Later, he was director of information (later chief of public information) of the United States Army from 1945 to 1947. He was deputy, later Vice Chief of Staff of the United States Army from 1947 to 1949 and was promoted to temporary general and permanent major general in January 1948.

Collins was Chief of Staff of the United States Army from 16 August 1949 to 15 August 1953; as such he was the Army&#x27;s senior officer throughout the Korean War. As a wartime chief of staff his primary responsibility was to ensure that adequately trained and equipped soldiers were sent to fight in Korea. He directed the Army&#x27;s operation of the railroads, brought the first Special Forces group into the order of battle, and was closely associated with the development of the army&#x27;s contribution to the newly established North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).

Collins was representative of the United States to the Military Committee and the Standing Group of NATO from 1953 to 1954. He was special representative of the United States in Vietnam with ambassadorial rank, 1954 to 1955, and returned to his NATO assignment. He retired from active service in March 1956, after almost 40 years of military service.
Collins died in Washington, D.C., on 12 September 1987, at the age of 91. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery, Virginia.&#x27;

<doc id="1297556" wikidata="Q7897897" url="?curid=1297556" title="Up, Up and Away (The 5th Dimension album)">
<text>Up – Up and Away is the debut album by the American pop group The 5th Dimension, released in 1967. The title track was released as a single and became a major pop hit.

The group&#x27;s first single release on Soul City Records, &quot;Train Keep On Moving/I&#x27;ll Be Loving You Forever&quot; was not a success, and is not included in the album. Both songs appear as bonus tracks on a later CD reissue of the album.

The first single released from this album, &quot;Go Where You Wanna Go&quot;, was initially recorded by the Mamas &amp; the Papas and appears on their first album. The 5th Dimension&#x27;s version became a top 20 hit in the US, reaching No. 16. The group&#x27;s second release, &quot;Another Day, Another Heartache&quot;, also charted, peaking at No. 45.

It was their third release, the ubiquitous &quot;Up, Up and Away&quot;, that launched both the group and the song&#x27;s writer, Jimmy Webb, into super-stardom. The group and the song amassed a total of five different Grammy Awards between them in 1967. Many different artists have since recorded versions of the song.

The group appeared on many television shows of the day, including &quot;The Hollywood Palace&quot;, &quot;Shebang&quot;, and particularly &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, where they became a favorite of the host. Performances exist of several of the album&#x27;s songs from these myriad shows, including &quot;Go Where You Wanna Go&quot;, &quot;Another Day, Another Heartache&quot;, &quot;Pattern People&quot;, &quot;California My Way&quot;, and the title track of the album.

<doc id="1297558" wikidata="Q4633139" url="?curid=1297558" title="2LO">
<text>2LO was the second radio station to regularly broadcast in the United Kingdom (the first was 2MT). It began broadcasting on 11 May 1922, for one hour a day from the seventh floor of Marconi House in London&#x27;s Strand, opposite Somerset House.

==History==
Initially the power was 100 watts on 360 metres (832 kHz). 2LO was allowed to transmit for seven minutes, after which the &quot;operator&quot; had to listen on the wavelength for three minutes for possible instructions to close down. On 14 November 1922 the station was transferred to the new British Broadcasting Company which in 1923 took up the nearby Savoy Hill for its broadcasting studios. At midnight on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1923, the twelve chimes of Big Ben were broadcast for the first time to mark the new year.

In 1927 the company became the British Broadcasting Corporation. On 9 March 1930 2LO was replaced by the BBC Regional Programme and the BBC National Programme. The letters LO continued to be used internally as a designation in the BBC for technical operations in the London area (for example, the numbering of all recordings made in London contained LO). The code LO was changed to LN in the early 1970s.

==Preservation and legacy==

The 2LO transmitter now belongs to the Science Museum, having been donated by Crown Castle International on 7 November 2002. It is displayed in the Information Age gallery on the second floor of the museum.

Marconi House was demolished in 2006, apart from the listed façade, which was incorporated into a new hotel complex. A first-hand account of a broadcast from 2LO is given in &quot;The Spell of London&quot; by H. V. Morton.

The &#x27;LO&#x27; part of 2LO&#x27;s callsign was adopted in 1924 by the metropolitan radio station in Melbourne which, since 1932, has been a part of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The station, 3LO, still has this callsign allocated to it, but since 2000 it has used different on-air names: as from 2017, it was 774 ABC Melbourne; and it is now ABC Radio Melbourne. 

The amateur radio callsign G2LO is currently held by the staff association at Arqiva, formerly Crown Castle International, formerly the domestic part of BBC Transmitter Department.

==In fiction==
2LO is briefly mentioned in the 1928, Lord Peter Wimsey, detective short-story &quot;The Entertaining Episode of the Article in Question&quot; by Dorothy L. Sayers.

2LO is also mentioned in Chapter 32 of Anthony Burgess’s “Earthly Powers” 1980 as part of a fictional episode involving the narrator’s brother Tom Toomey.

A 2LO broadcast with a weather forecast and news bulletin is mentioned in Chapter V of sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s &quot;The Maracot Deep&quot; 1927-28.

<text>Shepherd&#x27;s Bush is a London Underground station in the district of Shepherd&#x27;s Bush in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham. The station is on the Central line, between and stations, and it lies in Travelcard Zone 2.

The station originally opened in 1900, but was closed for eight months in 2008 while the surface station building was replaced with a completely new structure and the underground station refurbished.

A number of stations in the area both past and present have borne the name &quot;Shepherd&#x27;s Bush&quot;; today the Central line station shares its name with the adjacent London Overground&#x27;s station, with which it shares a surface-level interchange.

An entirely separate London Underground station, on the Circle and Hammersmith &amp; City lines is located approximately West. Until 2008, it too was called &quot;Shepherd&#x27;s Bush&quot; until it was renamed to avoid confusion.

==History==

The station opened on 30 July 1900 and was the original western terminus of the Central London Railway (CLR). The original surface-level station building was a terracotta-clad ticket hall with its entrance on the Uxbridge Road facing Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Green. Like all CLR stations, the station building was designed by Harry Bell Measures.

To the north of the station was located the CLR&#x27;s power station and Wood Lane depot which was originally accessed by a single track tunnel. The eastbound tunnel ended to the west of the station in a dead-end reversing siding with a cross-over junction connecting it to the westbound tunnel. When the now disused Wood Lane station was opened on 14 May 1908 to the north, a loop tunnel was created connecting to the eastbound tunnel.

An extension to Richmond planned in 1920 would have started here with the next stop at the closed London and South Western Railway station at Hammersmith (Grove Road); the work was never carried out. As part of London Transport&#x27;s New Works Programme, 1935 - 1940, escalators were installed to replace the original lifts and in 1938, the platforms were lengthened along with those of the other existing Central line stations to accommodate eight cars instead of the previous seven.

Some of the original 1900 features of the station were preserved in areas that are not open to the public. Since 2022, London Transport Museum has been running guided historical tours of the station through its &quot;Hidden London&quot; programme, which take visitors to the disused original station corridors and lift shafts to look at the history of the site.

==Westfield redevelopment==
A large-scale redevelopment began in 2005 to redevelop the White City area to the north of Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Green and to construct the Westfield Shopping Centre. As part of this project, Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Central line station was reconstructed in 2008 by Westfield as part of a Section 106 contribution. The Westfield redevelopment also included the construction of an integrated bus interchange and the new London Overground station on the West London line. The new Overground station opened on 28 September that year and is close to the site of the former station which closed in 1940.

During the reconstruction of the Central line station, Transport for London closed the station completely for eight months from 4 February 2008; TfL based their decision on the need to replace the escalators at the same time as rebuilding work. This decision caused local controversy, and critics claimed that the works had been timed to benefit incoming businesses involved in the planned redevelopment of the area, at the cost of local residents and small business holders. The local MP for the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush constituency, Andy Slaughter, investigated the project and obtained documents under the Freedom of Information Act which showed that the contractor, Metronet, had advised that the work could be completed without closing the station. Shepherd&#x27;s Bush station re-opened to passengers on 5 October that year.

During the refurbishment, Transport for London did not add lifts to the station as originally planned, citing installation costs of £100 million due to the various underground utilities nearby which would have to be diverted. The London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham and disability pressure groups have been critical of the fact that the station remains inaccessible for those unable to use stairs.

<text>Sydney Technical High School is a state-financed single-sex academically selective secondary day school for boys, located in Bexley, a southern suburb of Sydney situated near the city. Founded in 1911 as part of Sydney Technical College, the school was one of the six original New South Wales selective schools and caters for boys from Year 7 to Year 12. The school is colloquially abbreviated to Sydney Tech, STHS or simply Tech.

Admission to Year 7 is based on an external selective test held in Year 6 during March. Admissions for new students to Years 8, 9, 10 and 11 are restricted to filling any vacant places created by the loss of current students.

==Academic achievement==
The school consistently achieves superior results in external assessments, such as the &quot;NAPLAN&quot;, the &quot;ICAS&quot;, the &quot;Record of School Achievement&quot;, and in particular, the Year 12 &quot;Higher School Certificate&quot;, where its students are regularly ranked in the top ten places in the state across a variety of subjects. On average, over 80% of its students achieve in the top 20% of the state, with a majority gaining an &quot;Australian Tertiary Admission Rank&quot; of more than 90.

Sydney Technical High School consistently ranks amongst the podium in the state for Engineering Studies in the Year 12 &quot;Higher School Certificate&quot;, frequently coming first with an average &quot;HSC&quot; mark nearing 90. Dr. Paul L. Copeland the writer of the Preliminary and &quot;HSC&quot; syllabus and exams is a teacher at the school. He also authored the two main textbooks for Engineering Studies; &quot;Engineering Studies: The Definitive Guide Volume 1&quot; and &quot;Engineering Studies: The Definitive Guide Volume 2&quot;.

Sydney Technical High School also ranks consistently high, in the top twenty schools of the state for both English Advanced and English Standard courses in the Year 12 &quot;Higher Secondary Certificate&quot;. The school ranked first in the state for English Standard in 2022 with an average HSC mark of 80.5 for the cohort of that year.

In 2010, fifteen students from the school&#x27;s graduating class received Premier&#x27;s Awards for All-round Excellence in the NSW HSC. The school won the national championship in the University of Newcastle Science and Engineering Challenge in 2010 (gold division) and 2011 (silver division).

== History ==

One of the reforms advocated by the 1903 Royal Commission into NSW Education was the establishment of classes providing courses which would involve technical subjects. Consequently, Continuation classes for students interested in technical subjects commenced at the Sydney Technical College.

In April 1911, these Continuation classes were given the status of a high school, and Sydney Technical High was established. Originally, the school was co-educational with 113 boys and 15 girls. In February 1913, the girls were transferred to Fort Street Girls&#x27; High; and, from then on, the school became for boys only.

Since 1911, the school has been located at three Sydney sites:
*Ultimo House on Mary Ann Street: this was the &quot;country&quot; home of John Harris, Surgeon of the New South Wales Corps. The property was bought by the Government in 1899 and used by Technical Education for many years before being used by Sydney Tech High from 1911 to 1924.
*Paddington on Albion Street: in 1925, with an enrolment of 421, Sydney Tech High was transferred to Albion Street, Paddington. Although it was a note of expansion, it was a vigorous P&amp;C campaign that encouraged the State Government to fund an entirely new site for the school.
*Bexley on Forest Road: the Old McConnachie&#x27;s Paddock was occupied and first stone for the school&#x27;s foundations was laid in March 1955, with the school completed and occupied by September 1956. The official opening for the school&#x27;s new facilities was on 2 August 1958, with four units: the administration block, general classrooms (&#x27;A block&#x27;), manual training block and the auditorium and gymnasium. Throughout the years numerous additions have been made to the site. The School Pool was opened in 1966, the Kingston-David Library and Laboratories in 1975 and a brand-new administration block in 1998.

== Facilities ==
The current grounds at Bexley include the following physical facilities:
* &quot;The Cage Courts&quot; – basketball courts for Years 7–9 and 10–12, respectively
* &quot;Elmo Landsberger Cricket Nets&quot; – located between Lower courts and Back oval, 3 cricket batting nets &amp; a plaque dedicated to Elmo Landsberger
* &quot;Anderson Street Courts&quot; – A new basketball court as well as 3 small handball courts and a volleyball court has been put in, near the Anderson Street car park. The construction was completed in May 2009. 
* &quot;Sir Charles Kingsford Smith Memorial Library-&quot; large library with two floors
* &quot;The 1000 Auditorium&quot; for School Assemblies and performances
* &quot;J. Diaz Gymnasium&quot; with indoor basketball courts
* &quot;Matthew Goodall Memorial Garden&quot; – Adjacent the library
* &quot;Vera&#x27;s Gym&quot; – A physical gymnasium dedicated for outside classroom learning and relaxation. It is often used by PASS and SLR students as well as seniors.
*&quot;The Passive Area&quot; – 3 table tennis tables and various benches outside the library. Completed recently in early 2018

There was a temporary revival with the release of editions between 2008 and 2009; and once again in 2013 and 2014. FRED is no longer the school newspaper and has been, for all intents and purposes, replaced by the Tech High Times. However, there are talks of a relaunch for year 11&amp;12 students as a senior alternative to the junior paper.
*Tech High Times – A journalism society for students in years 7–10 that intends to produce tabloid editions each term.

== Notable achievements ==

=== Australian Nuclear Science Competition ===
Sydney Technical High School won a competition that tested skills in a science and engineering challenge. Students competed in the regional competition at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) recently.

The event encouraged teenagers to get involved in maths and science and promote careers in the fields. Part of the challenge involved constructing a bionic hand. More than 250-year 9 and year 10 students from seven Sydney schools participated.

=== Canberra Maths Day ===

<text>Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Market is a London Underground station in the district of Shepherd&#x27;s Bush in west London, England. It is on the Circle and Hammersmith &amp; City Lines, between Goldhawk Road and Wood Lane stations, and it is in Travelcard Zone 2. Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Market, from which the station takes its name, is an open-air market which runs parallel to the railway line.

==History==

The Metropolitan Railway (MR) opened the original station on 13 June 1864 as Shepherd&#x27;s Bush on its new extension to Hammersmith. It was in the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Market area just south of Uxbridge Road. From 1 October 1877 until 31 December 1906 the MR also ran direct services along this line to Richmond via .

The original Shepherd&#x27;s Bush station closed in 1914 to be replaced by two new stations which opened on 1 April 1914: the new Shepherd&#x27;s Bush station resited a short distance north across the Uxbridge Road, and Goldhawk Road about half a kilometre to the south. Those stations remain in those locations but nothing exists of the former station buildings in the marketplace.

In 1900 the Central London Railway (CLR) opened its Shepherd&#x27;s Bush station, now the Central line station, at the other end of Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Green. For 108 years there were two Tube stations of the same name apart.

In 2008 the new London Overground Shepherd&#x27;s Bush railway station was opened on the West London Line. To avoid the confusion of three stations named Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, the Hammersmith &amp; City line station was renamed Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Market on 12 October 2008. The other two on the Central line and the West London line are close to each other and interchange is allowed, but not with Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Market tube station.

==Locale==
The station is at the western end of Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Green, and stands just across the road from the marketplace which gives it its name. Stallholders have traded on the strip of land beside the Hammersmith &amp; City line since 1914, when the market took over the station&#x27;s first site. The other end of the market is served by Goldhawk Road Underground station.

Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Market station is near to various entertainment venues including the Bush Theatre and the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire. It is also one of the Underground stations which serve Loftus Road Football Stadium, the home of Queens Park Rangers football club. Westfield and West12 shopping centres are near the station.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 207, 260 and 283, Superloop express route SL8 and night route N207 serve the station.

<doc id="1297578" wikidata="Q4216871" url="?curid=1297578" title="Eliseo Castillo">
<text>Eliseo Castillo (born April 29, 1975) is a Cuban former professional boxer who competed from 1996 to 2009, holding the NABO cruiserweight title in 2006. He is the younger brother of Heavyweight boxer Elieser Castillo.

==Amateur career==
From the ages of 12 through 16, he trained to box through the Cuban state government&#x27;s amateur boxing program. (This is the same program that produced such boxing legends as Teofilo Stevenson, Félix Savón, Joel Casamayor, and Juan Carlos Gomez.) Despite winning the vast majority of his approximately 90 amateur bouts in Cuba, the young fighter could not manage to capture an international title.

==Defection from Cuba==
At the age of 17, Eliseo Castillo escaped from Cuba on a raft with his brothers Elieser (a very well known fellow Heavyweight boxer) and Eliades and two other friends. The group spent five days at sea before they drifted ashore in Panama. Soon thereafter, they were returned to Guantanamo Bay. After 18 months of processing the group was allowed to emigrate to the United States. He then moved to Miami, Florida.

==Professional career==
At the age of 20, he began his professional career as a boxer. His first bout was against Anthony Mack (who was also making his professional debut that evening) on February 24, 1996. Castillo won the bout via first-round knockout. He fought off-and-on into the new millennium, at one time even taking 3 years off from the sport.

Though his career has been spotty, he still managed to remain undefeated up until April 2005. The only blemish on his record up until that point was a draw to Terry Pitts (who later changed his name to Sajad Abdul Aziz) on November 13, 1998, at the famed Mahi Shrine Temple Auditorium in Miami. Aziz was able to score knockdowns in both the 4th and 5th rounds, but Castillo fought back and secured a majority draw. These fights were at cruiserweight.

His biggest victory came on July 3, 2004, against former Heavyweight champion Michael Moorer at the American Airlines Arena in Miami. He beat the former champion by a unanimous decision in their 10-round bout. This brought him some level of attention from the boxing press and garnered for him a fight with Wladimir Klitschko the following year.

At 2:51 in the fourth round, Klitschko was declared the victor after referee Daniel Van de Wiele stopped the fight.

Shortly after the fight with Klitschko, Castillo moved back down to the Cruiserweight division. He has won two straight since the Klitschko loss and was KOd by, the then undefeated, Johnathon Banks on July 26, 2006.

<text>Storm of Steel (; original English title: &quot;In Storms of Steel&quot;) is the memoir of German officer Ernst Jünger&#x27;s experiences on the Western Front during the First World War from December 1914 to August 1918. The book is a graphic account of trench warfare. It can be read affirmatively, neutrally or as an anti-war book.

&quot;Storm of Steel&quot; was originally printed privately in 1920, making it one of the first personal accounts to be published. It was largely devoid of editorialization when first published, but was heavily revised several times. The book established Jünger&#x27;s fame as a writer in the 1920s. The judgment of contemporaries and later critics reflects the ambivalence of the work, which describes the war in all its brutality, but neither expressly condemns it nor goes into its political causes. 

==Plot==

&quot;Storm of Steel&quot; begins with Jünger, as a private, entering the line with the 73rd Hanoverian Regiment in Champagne. His first taste of combat came at Les Éparges in April 1915 where he was first wounded by a piece of shrapnel piercing his thigh.

After recuperating, he took an officer&#x27;s course and achieved the rank of &quot;Leutnant&quot;. He rejoined his regiment on the Arras sector. In 1916, with the Battle of the Somme underway, Jünger&#x27;s regiment moved to Combles in August for the defence of the village of Guillemont. Here Jünger was wounded again, and absent shortly before the final British assault which captured the village — his platoon was annihilated. In 1917 Jünger saw action during the Battle of Arras in April, the Third Battle of Ypres in July and October, and the German counter-attack during the Battle of Cambrai in November. Jünger led a company of assault troops during the final German spring offensive, 21 March 1918 when he was wounded again. On 23 August he suffered his most severe wound when he was shot through the chest.

In total, Jünger was wounded 14 times during the war, including five bullet wounds, and earned the Golden Wound Badge. He was awarded the Iron Cross 1st and 2nd Class, House Order of Hohenzollern and was the youngest ever recipient of the &quot;Pour le Mérite&quot;.

==Publication history==
The first version of &quot;Storm of Steel&quot; was essentially Jünger&#x27;s unedited diary; the original English title was &quot;In Storms of Steel: from the diary of a Shock Troop Commander, Ernst Jünger, War Volunteer, and subsequently Lieutenant in the Rifle Regiment of Prince Albrecht of Prussia (73rd Hanoverian Regiment)&quot;. Since it was first published there have been up to seven revisions of &quot;Storm of Steel&quot;, with the last being the 1978 version for Jünger&#x27;s &quot;Collected Works&quot;. The major revision came in 1934, for which the explicit descriptions of violence were muted. This edition carried the universal dedication &quot;For the fallen&quot;.

The first translation came out in 1922 with Julio A. López&#x27;s Spanish translation titled &quot;Bajo la tormenta de acero&quot; and based on the original 1920 edition. The 1924 edition was translated into English by Basil Creighton as &quot;The Storm of Steel&quot; in 1929 and into French in 1930. A new English translation, based on the final 1961 version, was made by Michael Hofmann in 2003 which won the 2004 Oxford-Weidenfeld Translation Prize. In his introduction to his own edition, Hofmann is highly critical of Creighton&#x27;s translation.

==Reception==
&quot;Storm of Steel&quot; became a best-seller in Germany and other countries, and was widely admired by writers and politicians across the political spectrum. The left-wing French writer André Gide wrote in 1942 that &quot;Ernst Junger&#x27;s book
on the 1914 War, Storm of Steel, is without question the finest book on war that I know: utterly honest, truthful, in good faith. Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels praised the work: “A man of the young generation speaks about the war’s deep impact on the soul and describes the mind miraculously. A great book. Behind it a real man.” Adolf Hitler also admired the book, and despite Jünger remaining aloof from the Nazi Party, &quot;Storm of Steel&quot; was studied by the Wehrmacht for military training purposes during the Nazi era, and party publications recommended the book as a gift for boys. 

The work is often noted for its detached perspective on combat and violence which differs greatly from many other works produced by veterans of the First World War. The historian Jeffrey Herf wrote, &quot;Unlike the pacifist and expressionist novels and plays of the early 1920s such as Remarque&#x27;s All Quiet on the Western Front or Toller&#x27;s &quot;Gas&quot;, Jünger&#x27;s &quot;Stahlgewittern&quot; [Storm of Steel] celebrated the &quot;Fronterlebnis&quot; [Front-experience] as a welcome and long overdue release from the stifling security of the prewar Wilhelmian middle class.&quot;

<doc id="1297585" wikidata="Q5341828" url="?curid=1297585" title="Edward Beale McLean">
<text>Edward &quot;Ned&quot; Beale McLean (1889 – July 28, 1941) was the publisher and owner of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; newspaper, from 1916 until 1933. McLean was also a thoroughbred racehorse owner and purchaser of the Hope Diamond, which was traditionally believed to carry a curse. Edward McLean was declared insane and died in a psychiatric hospital.

==Early life==
McLean was born into a publishing fortune founded by his paternal grandfather, Washington McLean, who owned &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot;. He was the only child of John Roll McLean, for whom McLean, Virginia, is named, and the former Emily Truxtun Beale, daughter of Edward F. Beale and the former Mary Edwards. Emily was a hostess and socialite who was the inspiration for the character Victoria Dare in the 1880 comic novel, &quot;&quot; by Henry Brooks Adams. He attended Brooks Debartolo Collegiate High School.

==Career==
In 1916, Edward inherited &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, which he owned and published until 1933.

===Thoroughbred horse racing===
In 1915, Edward McLean acquired Belmont Plantation, where he had built a horse stable and training track for thoroughbreds. Involved with show horses for a number of years, in 1917 McLean purchased 32 racehorses and hired trainer H. Eugene Leigh. His notable runners included Toro, the winner of the 1928 American Derby. The horse also ran third in the Kentucky Derby and second in the Preakness Stakes. McLean dispersed his bloodstock in June 1931 and, in December, the estate was sold to Mr. and Mrs. Patrick J. Hurley.

==Hope Diamond ownership==
On January 28, 1911, in a deal made in the offices of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, McLean purchased the Hope Diamond for US$180,000 from Pierre Cartier of Cartier Jewelers on Fifth Avenue in New York City. A clause in the sale agreement for the diamond (which was widely believed to have brought death and disaster to its owners) stated: &quot;Should any fatality occur to the family of Edward B. McLean within six months, the said Hope diamond is agreed to be exchanged for jewelry of equal value&quot;. By March, as the diamond had not been paid for, Cartier retained a lawyer to sue McLean for payment. McLean responded by saying that the diamond was on loan for inspection. On February 2, 1912 &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported, &quot;Wealthy Purchasers of Famous Stone to Retain It Despite Sinister Reputation.&quot; The McLeans purchased the diamond for $180,000. For eight years, the bad luck association of the diamond was not evident. However, some subsequent events led to further speculation of the curse. In 1997, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; referenced its former publisher, the feckless Ned McLean, as &quot;more of a curse even than the diamond&quot;.

==Personal life==
His wife, Evalyn Walsh McLean, was a prominent Washington socialite. They married in 1908. Evalyn Walsh, the only surviving child and sole heiress of mining millionaire Thomas Walsh. Following a honeymoon trip around the world, the couple returned to Washington and settled into the McLean family&#x27;s country house, called &quot;Friendship&quot;, now the McLean Gardens Condominium development in the Tenleytown neighborhood of Washington. The McLeans lived lavishly and were prominent in Washington society.

===Political friends===
The McLeans were close friends of Senator and President Warren G. Harding and first lady Florence Harding.

McLean was also a friend of Secretary of the Interior Albert B. Fall, through whom he became embroiled in the Teapot Dome scandal. McLean falsely told investigating Senator Thomas J. Walsh that he had given Fall a $100,000 loan when, in fact, Fall had illegally received money from private oil companies. When Walsh threatened to have McLean charged with perjury, McLean admitted the falsity of his claim. This admission was later characterized as &quot;the first climactic sensation&quot; and &quot;the smoking gun&quot; of the scandal.

===Divorce, mental illness, and death===
The McLean marriage ended with much publicized and bitterly contested divorce proceedings, initiated by Mrs. McLean on grounds of infidelity, in October 1931. McLean filed for divorce in Mexico but his wife obtained a permanent injunction from a District of Columbia court ordering the cessation of the Mexican proceedings. Edward McLean then suddenly announced he had already married Rose Douras, a sister of Hollywood film star Marion Davies; though a marriage had not occurred. McLean immediately took up residence in Riga, Latvia, where he again filed for a divorce, which was granted on December 13, 1932.

Edward McLean&#x27;s increasingly erratic behavior and reckless spending led to the forced sale of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; by trustees appointed by the court. The divorce proceedings of Evalyn McLean continued in United States court but were dropped following an October 31, 1933, verdict by a jury in a Maryland trial that declared Edward McLean to be legally insane and incapable of managing his affairs. The court ordered that he be committed indefinitely to a psychiatric hospital.

Edward McLean died of a heart attack at Sheppard and Enoch Pratt Hospital in Towson, Maryland in 1941.

===Progeny===
On May 18, 1919, nine-year-old Vinson Walsh McLean (born December 18, 1909), the eldest of four McLean children, was struck by a car and killed while crossing Wisconsin Avenue in front of their house.

On October 9, 1941, their 19-year-old daughter, Evalyn Washington &quot;Evie&quot; McLean (November 16, 1921–September 20, 1946), became the fifth wife of 57-year-old Senator Robert Rice Reynolds of North Carolina. Less than five years later, she was found dead by her mother. A coroner&#x27;s inquest determined the cause of death to be an accidental overdose of sleeping pills. Their daughter, Mamie Spears Reynolds, who was the first woman to qualify for the Daytona 500, married Luigi &quot;Coco&quot; Chinetti Jr., son of Italian race car driver and Ferrari agent Luigi Chinetti, in 1963; they divorced two years later. She later married Joseph E. Gregory, with whom she had two children.

The couple&#x27;s second son, John Randolph &quot;Jock&quot; McLean II, married three times to socialites: first to Agnes Landon Pyne Davis Bacon (née Davis) in 1941, then to Elizabeth Muhlenberg “Betty” Brooke Blake Phipps Reed (née Blake) in 1943, and finally to former model Mildred W. &quot;Brownie&quot; Brown Schrafft (née Brown) in 1953. In 1976, &quot;Hustler&quot; magazine publisher Larry Flynt rented Brownie McLean&#x27;s Palm Beach estate, El Solano, as a background for published photographs. In January 1980 she sold the mansion to Yoko Ono and John Lennon. She turned down the Hope Diamond in 1952 when offered by her husband on the passing of his mother, due to the so-called &quot;curse&quot; associated with it.

Third son, Edward Beale McLean, Jr., married Ann Carroll Meem in May 1938. Their divorce was granted in July 1943 and in August he married actress Gloria Hatrick, with whom he had two sons, Ronald and Michael. Ronald was killed in action in 1969 by enemy fire while serving in Vietnam as a first lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps. McLean Jr. and Gloria divorced in January 1948. In October of that year, he married Manuela Mercedes &quot;Mollie&quot; Hudson, who had been the first wife of Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt Jr.; in August 1949, Gloria married actor James Stewart. McLean Jr. and Hudson-Vanderbilt separated in the 1960s and divorced in 1973, after which he married Patricia Dewey.

<doc id="1297599" wikidata="Q7749428" url="?curid=1297599" title="The Magic Garden">
<text>The Magic Garden is the second album by the American pop group the 5th Dimension, released in 1967. A concept album, it tells the story of a couple&#x27;s love and the end of their relationship. In more recent discussions of the album, that love affair is said to be about Jimmy Webb — who composed all but one of the album&#x27;s songs — and his time with singer and then-girlfriend Susan Horton (the song &quot;Dreams/Pax/Nepenthe&quot; refers to a Susan). The album&#x27;s one track not credited to Jimmy Webb, a cover of Lennon–McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot;, was originally intended for the group&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Up, Up and Away&quot;.

Following the success of &quot;Up, Up and Away&quot;, which spawned two Top-20 singles on the Billboard Pop Chart, expectations were high for &quot;The Magic Garden&quot;. The album just missed the Billboard Hot 100, and no Top 20 singles emerged from it in the US. The first single, &quot;Paper Cup&quot;, rose only to #34. &quot;Carpet Man&quot;, the album&#x27;s second single, landed at #29 in the US but found great success in Canada, charting at #3 on Toronto&#x27;s CHUM chart and #11 on the RPM chart, in March 1968. The group performed the song on &quot;Kraft Music Hall&quot; (on an episode hosted by John Davidson) and &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;.

However, over the years &quot;The Magic Garden&quot; has gained cult album status.

==The Worst That Could Happen==
One of the album&#x27;s cuts, &quot;The Worst That Could Happen&quot;, was released as a single by the Brooklyn Bridge in December 1968, charting top 40 on Billboard in January and becoming a top 3 hit in the US. The 5th Dimension would have to wait for their next album, &quot;Stoned Soul Picnic&quot;, to achieve the same chart placement. To capitalize on the success of &quot;The Worst That Could Happen&quot;, Soul City Records re-released &quot;The Magic Garden&quot; as &quot;The Worst That Could Happen&quot;. for the US market. The re-release reverses the front and back covers of the original LP. The vinyl label still retained &quot;The Magic Garden&quot; title, Soul City label and catalog number.

Although the original &quot;Magic Garden&quot; album was released in mono in both the US (SCM-91001) and UK (LBL 83098), the reissue as &quot;The Worst That Could Happen&quot; was only released in stereo (SCS-92001).

<doc id="1297613" wikidata="Q7439385" url="?curid=1297613" title="Scud running">
<text>In general aviation, scud running is a practice in which pilots lower their altitude to avoid clouds or instrument meteorological conditions (IMC). The goal of scud running is to stay clear of weather to continue flying with visual, rather than instrument, references. This practice is widely accepted to be dangerous, and has led to death in many cases from pilots flying into terrain or obstacles, such as masts and towers, normally referred to as controlled flight into terrain, or CFIT; however, even instrument-rated pilots sometimes elect to take the risk to avoid icing or embedded thunderstorms in cloud, or in situations where the minimum instrument altitudes are too high for their aircraft.

Scud running is occasionally described as &quot;maintaining visual contact with the ground while avoiding physical contact with it&quot; or &quot;if the weather&#x27;s too bad to go IFR, we&#x27;ll go VFR.&quot; A procedure under instrument flight rules (IFR), called a contact approach, is often referred to as a form of &quot;legalized&quot; scud running.

The term gets its name from scud, which is used to describe small, ragged, low cloud fragments that are unattached to a larger cloud base, and often seen with and behind cold fronts and thunderstorm gust fronts.&lt;ref name=&#x27;nws/g&#x27;&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canadian regulations==
In Canada, the visibility and altitude requirements are similar to those in the U.S., but most controlled airspace outside of terminal areas bottoms out at Above Ground Level (AGL), so there is more room to scud run legally. In northern Canada, there is little controlled airspace at all, below the high-level class A airspace.

==US regulations==
In the United States, most controlled airspace below MSL requires a pilot flying under VFR to remain below a cloud ceiling and to maintain visibility. However, outside of airport control zones and major terminal areas, controlled airspace typically begins at above ground level; below that is uncontrolled (class G) airspace, where (at that altitude) a pilot is required only to remain clear of clouds and to maintain visibility.
Flying in the airspace above the tree line, yet below is considered &quot;scud running&quot; where land ownership rights ends at the height of the property tree line.

<doc id="1297615" wikidata="Q5602765" url="?curid=1297615" title="Green Lakes State Park">
<text>Green Lakes State Park is a New York State Park located east of Syracuse in the Town of Manlius. The park is strikingly scenic, and has a &quot;masterpiece&quot; golf course designed by Robert Trent Jones very early in his career. Green Lake itself is perhaps the most studied meromictic lake—one in which layers of water do not mix—in the world. The park preserves the largest stand of old growth forest in Central New York, and Round Lake has been designated as a National Natural Landmark by the U.S. Department of the Interior.

The park is centered on two small lakes, Green Lake and Round Lake, which have an unusual blue-green color. These lakes lie at the base of a gorge that is somewhat longer than a mile in length. The lakes and the gorge are remnants of the ice ages, and exemplify some of the unusual geology of upstate New York. Green Lake has a surface area of 65 acres and a maximum depth of 195 feet. Round Lake has a surface area of 34 acres and a maximum depth of 170 feet.

The park&#x27;s area is , and it logs about 1,000,000 visitors each year. Nearly half the park&#x27;s area is old-growth forest, which includes many very large specimens of tuliptrees, sugar maples, beech, basswood, hemlocks, and white cedars. A grove of trees, lying immediately to the southwest of Round Lake, has been called the &quot;Tuliptree Cathedral&quot;.

==Camping and recreation==
At its northern end, Green Lake has a sandy swimming beach, lawns for sunbathing, and a building with changing facilities and a concession stand; Green Lake is certainly one of the most popular swimming beaches in Central New York. Adjacent to the beach, there is a boathouse with rowboat and paddleboat rentals in the summer season. Currently, Green Lakes is offering stand up paddle board classes, excursions, and yoga taught by Method 360; privately owned boats and paddle boards are not permitted. The park has an 18-hole golf course designed by Robert Trent Jones, as well as a clubhouse in its southeastern quadrant. Above the western cliffs along Green Lake there are a Frisbee golf course, 137 campsites, and seven cabins for those who prefer a less rustic experience and some outdoors life experience. There are several formal picnic areas throughout the park, including some with picnic shelters that can be reserved for groups.

There is an extensive network of hiking trails throughout the park, including about of cross-country ski trails. Some of the trails are also available for mountain biking. The development of the lake area is mostly contained at its northern end. The western shoreline of Green Lake is undeveloped, and Round Lake itself is essentially in wilderness. Of this region, Mary Notarthomas has written that &quot;When walking on the lake trails, one is cradled between the rich, vibrant, almost alien blue-green waters on one side and thickly vegetated, steep wooded inclines on the other.&quot; Together, North Lake Trail and Round Lake Trail make a level loop of .

The park includes many bike trails, most of which are at the western edge of the park. These connect with the Old Erie Canal State Historic Park, which runs by the north entrance to Green Lakes State Park (just above the top of the aerial photograph). The Erie Canal, which was abandoned in 1918, is still continuous within this State Historic Park, and the old towpath is now a walking and bicycling path. The Park extends from the Butternut Creek aqueduct in DeWitt to the Erie Canal Village, which is near Rome.

==Golf course==
Green Lakes State Park has an 18-hole public golf course designed by Robert Trent Jones in 1935. The course was one of Trent Jones&#x27; earliest; ultimately, he was credited with designing about 500 courses. In lieu of payment for its design, he was given a ten-year lease for $1.00/year. Jones opened the course on May 6, 1936. He&#x27;d invited Gene Sarazen to play an exhibition match with Emmett Kelly, the first course pro; more than 1,000 people came to watch.

James Dodson has written of the course that &quot;the original little masterpiece at Green Lakes, where Wendy and I and sometimes the other Dewsweepers slipped away to chase the game among the gloriously mature evergreens and admire the long view over a dark blue glacial lake, to the very foothills of the Adirondacks themselves, remained just about my favorite Trent Jones golf course of all.&quot; Trent Jones attended the 50th anniversary of the opening of the course in 1986.

==History and planning==
The movement to acquire the land around Green Lakes for a state park began around 1924. The history has been described in a memoir by Betsy Knapp. Knapp, a descendant of the family that acquired and farmed this area in the early 19th century, noted the particular role of Harry Francis, then a professor at the New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University (now the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry).

In October 1927 were purchased for the new park. In 1929, the Administration Building was built according to plans by Laurie D. Cox, a prominent landscape architect (and Hall of Fame lacrosse coach) who was active in the design of several New York state parks. The first superintendent of the park, Arvin Henry Almquist, lived there for four years. The building, which had been boarded up for many years, was re-opened in 2008.
During the Great Depression (1929–1939), the New York State Department of Conservation (under the administration of then-governor Franklin Delano Roosevelt) and later the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) constructed the park&#x27;s roads, buildings, cabins, golf course and trails. CCC camps for project SP-12 were created on the property of the park. CCC company 1203, and subsequently 2211 (a company of veterans of the 1898 Spanish–American War), were assigned to the project. These men hauled loads of sand from Sylvan Beach (on nearby Oneida Lake) to create a sandy beach; they dug the basements of the park buildings by hand. The CCC also constructed barracks, dining halls, etc. for its own use. These facilities were closed in 1941. A reunion of the CCC companies who had worked in Central New York was held at Green Lakes in 1988.

The CCC camp was reopened in 1944 during World War II to house wartime farm workers from Newfoundland. In 1945 it became the Fayetteville Camp for German prisoners of war. Fayetteville Camp was a branch of Pine Camp, which was located on the site of the present Fort Drum near Watertown, New York. The camp was closed again in 1946 when the prisoners were repatriated to Germany.
Since the original purchase of land in 1928, the park has increased to . There were additional acquisitions of land in 1960, 1975, 1995, and 1996. Plans to add an additional to the park have apparently been frustrated. 261 additional acres were acquired in 2019. Alverna Heights, a 200-acre retreat adjoining the park, was purchased from the Sisters of St. Francis by New York State on December 6, 2019. Two houses occupied by the Sisters have been leased back to them for a decade.

In 2008, the bathhouse near the park&#x27;s swimming area and beach was demolished, and a new building was constructed to replace it at a cost of about $2.3 million. The building incorporates changing facilities, restrooms and showers, a snack concession, and a meeting room.
===2011 Master Plan and Environmental Impact Statement===
On March 23, 2011, the State&#x27;s Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation published a &quot;Final Master Plan/Final Environmental Impact Statement for Green Lakes State Park&quot;. The Executive Summary of the Plan notes:

* 1002 acres in the western half of the park is designated as a Bird Conservation Area.
* Approximately 105 acres in the Old Growth area within the National Natural Landmark, and the area surrounding Round Lake, is designated as a Park Preservation Area
* Improve the Rolling Hills Campground in the short term. In the long term the campground will be relocated to an area south of the park office.

While the large white-tail deer population in the park is a problem, bow hunting is excluded; some local groups have called for bow-hunting of deer in the park as a partial solution.

==Geology and limnology==

===Origin of the gorge===
The cliffs surrounding Round Lake are about high, but the rocky gorge in which the lake lies is much deeper than this. The bottom of Round Lake is about below its surface. Round Lake&#x27;s bottom lies in sediments which may be another deep. There is thus nearly gouged out of the bedrock here.

This deep gorge was formed towards the end of the last ice age, about 15,000 years ago, by an enormous river of water. The river originated in the melting, retreating ice sheet, and it flowed east through this channel on its way to the sea. The Niagara River gorge lying below Niagara Falls is an active example of this type of gorge formation; its depth is about , which is somewhat shallower than that at Green Lakes. There are several other similar gorges in the same region as Green Lakes State Park, in particular at Clark Reservation, at Smoky Hollow ( south of Clark Reservation), and at Pumpkin Hollow (about west of Clark Reservation). Geologists call these gorges and hollows &quot;the Syracuse channels.&quot;


===Origin of the lakes===
Green Lake and Round Lake are probably the remnants of the &quot;plunge pools&quot; of enormous waterfalls that existed during this era. However, the presence of two distinct lakes is not fully understood. As expected for plunge pools, the lakes are fairly deep in comparison to their area. For example, Round Lake is deep, and has a diameter of about .

===The color of the lakes===

Nearly half of the water that enters the lakes comes directly through the bedrock in which the lakes are embedded. This water contains a heavy load of dissolved minerals that are not present in water that enters through the surface from rain and snow. The high concentration of sulfur in the deep waters had already been reported by 1849; the lakes&#x27; waters also have a high concentration of calcium and magnesium. This mineral concentration leads to &quot;whiting&quot; events each year in which small crystallites of calcite and other minerals precipitate from the water. At these times of year the lakes appear particularly green, and the small crystallites are deposited in a layer underneath the lakes&#x27; waters. The notable shoreline &quot;reef&quot; at Deadman&#x27;s Point (see photo) on Green Lake was built up by this precipitation over thousands of years. Underneath Deadman&#x27;s Point there are some extremely rare aquatic mosses and sponges.

===Climate history and Green Lakes===
Nearly all lakes undergo mixing of their deepest waters with their surface waters at least once a year. This mixing does not occur for Green Lake and Round Lake. They are rare, meromictic lakes. Waters deeper than about 55 feet (18 m) do not mix with the surface waters; as a consequence, they are essentially devoid of oxygen, and are rich in calcium, magnesium, and sulfur. The meromictic character of the lakes is due both to their relative depth compared to their area, and to the influx of mineral rich ground waters.

Because of this lack of physical mixing, as well as the absence of growing plants or crawling animals in their oxygen-depleted depths, the deep bottoms of the lakes have relatively undisturbed annual layers of sediment (or varves) that preserve a historical record, somewhat like tree rings do. These varves are being used to study the climate of this area of New York over the last several thousand years.

<text>Alexander Viktorovych &quot;Sascha&quot; Dimitrenko (; born 5 July 1982) is a Ukrainian-born German former professional boxer who competed from 2001 to 2019, and held the European heavyweight title from 2010 to 2011.

==Amateur career==
Dimitrenko began boxing at the age of fourteen. Representing Russia, he won the 2000 World Junior Championships in the super-heavyweight division at the age of eighteen, with German promoter Klaus-Peter Kohl offering him a deal immediately afterwards. Dimitrenko signed with Kohl&#x27;s Universum promotion company and moved to Hamburg to begin his professional career.

==Professional career==
=== Early career ===
Dimitrenko made his professional debut on 8 December 2001, stopping Marcus Johnson in four rounds on the undercard of the fight between Vitali Klitschko and Ross Puritty. Dimitrenko&#x27;s professional debut averaged over 5 million viewers on Sat.1. Standing at an imposing , he was widely regarded as one of the top contenders for a future world title opportunity. He compiled a record of 14 wins in 14 bouts, ending 10 of them inside the distance, 8 of them - inside the first two rounds. He was then scheduled to face his first notable opponent, Ross Puritty. The bout generated attention in both Germany and Ukraine, given Puritty&#x27;s win over Wladimir Klitschko six years prior, with Dimitrenko entertaining the idea of beating someone who had defeated one of the Klitschkos.
 The bout was scheduled to happen on 31 July 2004, but Purrity pulled out after suffering an elbow injury during training camp while sparring with Juan Carlos Gomez. Puritty pulled out just three days before the scheduled date.
 Instead, Dimitrenko faced former British and Commonwealth heavyweight champion Julius Francis, who at the time was used as a stepping stone by some of the rising prospects, such as Audley Harrison and Volodymyr Vyrchys, and as a stay-busy fight by heavyweight contenders.
 Dimitrenko won the bout by a lopsided unanimous decision (UD), with all three judges scoring the bout identically 80–72, giving Dimitrenko every round.

The fight between Dimitrenko and Puritty was rescheduled to take place on 6 November 2004, with Dimitrenko agreeing for a tune-up bout against Andy Sample. Dimitrenko defeated Sample by second-round TKO. On 6 November 2004, he finally faced Puritty in an anticipated showdown that was televised by ZDF. The fight was part of the three-fight main event which also saw Sergiy Dzindziruk defending his European welterweight title against Hussein Bayram, and Mario Veit defending WBO world super-middleweight title against Charles Brewer. Dimitrenko outboxed Puritty for the majority of the fight, staying on the outside and keeping his opponent at the end of his jab. Ultimately, Dimitrenko won the fight by unanimous decision (UD), with scores 80–72 (twice) and 79–73.

=== Rising through the rankings ===
In his next outing, on 5 March 2005, he faced hard-hitting American prospect, Chris Koval, on the undercard of Felix Sturm vs. Bert Schenk. This was Dimitrenko&#x27;s first fight scheduled for 10 rounds. Coming into the fight, 22-year old Koval had 20–1 record with 16 KOs, with 11 of them in the first round. Dimitrenko was knocked down in the second round but dominated his opponent throughout the rest of the fight. The bout went full ten rounds, with Dimitrenko being declared the winner by a lopsided unanimous decision with scores 98–91 (twice) and 98–92. This was bettered on 2 July 2005, when Dimitrenko picked up two vacant regional championships — IBF and WBO Inter-Continental heavyweight titles — after a second-round knockout of Andreas Sidon.

Dimitrenko then agreed to face Vaughn Bean on September 28, 2005 as part of the card dedicated to the 100th anniversary of the birth of former world heavyweight champion Max Schmeling, with the main event of the night being the WBO world heavyweight title fight between Luan Krasniqi and Lamon Brewster. The fight card had seven boxers from the former Soviet Bloc scheduled to fight - Dimitrenko, Ruslan Chagaev, Denis Boytsov, Taras Bidenko, Valeriy Chechenev, Bagrat Ohanyan and Alexei Mazikin, with the latter being forced to pull out due to injury. 31-year old Bean, known for having competitive bouts with world champions Evander Holyfield and Michael Moorer and having only been stopped by Vitali Klitschko, was considered Dimitrenko&#x27;s toughest challenge to date. In the opening rounds, Dimitrenko was mostly throwing straight punches, struggling with Bean&#x27;s movement and counterpunching style as well as attacks to the body. Bean was deducted a point in round three for intentional low blows. In the eighth round, Dimitrenko staggered Bean with a left hook and continued to apply pressure on his opponent, going back-and-forth between attacks to the head and body. Dimitrenko was ultimately declared the winner by unanimous decision, with the judges scoring the bout 95–93, 96–92 and 95–93.
After defeating Chad Van Sickle by second-round TKO, Dimitrenko agreed to face Argentine boxer Gonzalo Omar Basile on 28 October 2006. In the build up to the fight, Basile received media attention for his tattoos. During pre-fight press conference, Basile claimed to be &quot;the devil between heavyweights&quot;, while Dimitrenko expressed his disgust with &quot;so many tasteless tattoos&quot; on Basile&#x27;s body, and that he was going to punish Basile for them. In the lead-up to the fight, Dimitrenko&#x27;s coach Fritz Sdunek said that his fighter was getting better with each bout, and that very soon he would become &quot;the new Klitschko&quot; and fight for the world heavyweight title. The fight took place at Porsche-Arena in Stuttgart and was televised on ZDF. It was Basile&#x27;s first professional bout outside of South America. The fight lasted 54 seconds, with Basile&#x27;s corner throwing in the towel after Basile could not respond to a barrage of shots from Dimitrenko.

In his last fight of 2006, Dimitrenko faced an experienced American journeyman Billy Zumbrun on 18 November 2006, only three weeks after beating Basile. Originally, the main event of the card was supposed to be the fight between Felix Sturm and Gavin Topp, but the fight was postponed due to Sturm&#x27;s injury. Dimitrenko, regarded as a popular commodity in Germany at the time, was considered to be an adequate replacement for Sturm. According to Dimitrenko, the fight turned out to be &quot;tougher than expected&quot;.
 He won by a shut-out unanimous decision, knocking Zumbrun down in the first round and dominating him throughout the rest of the fight. Zumbrun was deducted a point in the tenth round for headbutting. The judges scored the bout 120–105, 119–107 and 120–106. By the end of 2006, Dimitrenko was ranked as the world&#x27;s ninth best heavyweight by BoxRec. He was also ranked No.4 heavyweight contender by WBO.

Dimitrenko then had two stay-busy fights in the first half of 2007, defeating American heavyweights Danny Batchelder and Malcolm Tann by mid-fight TKOs. By July 2007, Dimitrenko was ranked No.2 contender by WBO, No.6 contender by WBC and No. 10 contender by WBA.
 He then signed to face Timo Hoffmann on 17 November 2007. Hoffmann, who had previously faced fighters like Vitali Klitschko, Luan Krasniqi and Henry Akinwande and was known for his durability, had never been stopped inside the distance coming into this bout and was expected to be a tough challenge for Dimitrenko and an opportunity to elevate Dimitrenko&#x27;s popularity in Germany. Dimitrenko weighed in at and was outweighed by Hoffmann by . This was also the first professional fight in which Dimitrenko was fighting someone taller than himself. The bout took place at Bördelandhalle in Magdeburg and was the main event of the card that was aired on ZDF.

Both fighters started fighting aggressively and throwing heavy shots from the opening bell, with Dimitrenko appearing to be doing the better work, finding success working Hoffmann&#x27;s body. At the beginning of the fourth round, Dimitrenko unleashed a barrage of punches that sent Hoffmann to the canvas. Hoffmann got up but was knocked down again after a series of body shots. By the end of the round, Dimitrenko appeared to be tired. Hoffmann regained composure in round 5, pressing Dimitrenko against the ropes and knocking him down with a left hook. In the second half of the fight, both fighters were trading shots, with Dimitrenko having the upper hand in most of the exchanges. By the eighth round, Hoffmann&#x27;s face was covered in blood, while Dimitrenko had swells above both eyes. Dimitrenko unleashed another barrage of punches in the twelfth round, knocking Hoffmann down again. Hoffmann got up, but was soon dropped again. Dimitrenko then threw a series of unanswered shots, prompting the referee to stop the bout after Hoffmann was dropped again, with 36 seconds left to the end of the fight. Dimitrenko became the first boxer to defeat Timo Hoffmann inside the distance. During post-fight drug testing, Hoffmann tested positive for anabolic steroids.
 By the end of 2007, Dimitrenko was ranked by BoxRec as the tenth best heavyweight in the world.

After defeating Derric Rossy by fifth-round TKO in a stay-busy fight, Dimitrenko then signed to face then-highly regarded German boxer Luan Krasniqi on 18 November in Düsseldorf, as part of the show billed by Universum as &quot;Golden November&quot;.
 Many observers saw this fight as a big step up in competition for Dimitrenko and Krasniqi&#x27;s last chance to regain his stock after losses to Lamon Brewster and Tony Thompson. During pre-fight press conference, Krasniqi said that if he wouldn&#x27;t beat Dimitrenko, he was going to retire.

The fight lasted only three rounds. In the third round, Dimitrenko dropped Krasniqi with a liver shot. Krasniqi was unable to get up at the count of ten, prompting the referee to stop the fight and declaring Dimitrenko the winner by third-round KO. This was Dimitrenko&#x27;s fifth stoppage in a row, achieved against opponents with combined record 133–15–3. At the conclusion of 2008, Dimitrenko was ranked No.10 heavyweight in the world by &quot;The Ring&quot;. He was also ranked No.2 contender by WBO, No.3 by WBC and No.7 contender by WBA and IBF.

=== WBO world heavyweight title eliminator ===
After two reigns as WBO Inter-Continental champion, Dimitrenko was scheduled to face Eddie Chambers in a WBO world heavyweight title eliminator. At the time of the fight, Chambers was ranked No.6 heavyweight contender by &quot;The Ring&quot;, while Dimitrenko was ranked No.8 by the same publication. Dimitrenko was also ranked within top 5 by all major sanctioning bodies. Dimitrenko weighed in at 253 1/4 lbs, outweighing Chambers by 45 1/2 lbs. The fight took place at Color Line Arena in Hamburg, Germany and was televised by ZDF. Dimitrenko was outboxed for most of the fight, visibly unprepared for Chambers&#x27; unusually aggressive approach and unable to keep up with his speed and fighting IQ. Dimitrenko received a standing count in the seventh round after a left hook to the body, and was knocked down in the tenth after another left hook, this time to the chin. Dimitrenko lost the fight by majority decision. The judges scored the bout 117–109 and 116–111 in favor of Chambers, and 113–113 even.

=== Later fights; inactivity and return ===
Looking to regain his stock, Dimitrenko agreed to face Luan Krasniqi in a rematch on 28 November 2009 in Düsseldorf, Germany. Some observes criticized the fight, pointing out that Krasniqi hadn&#x27;t fought in the ring since their first encounter. Dimitrenko dismissed these criticisms, claiming that Krasniqi, despite the long stretch of inactivity, was still a dangerous, highly experienced fighter. Three weeks before the scheduled date, Krasniqi was forced to pull out due to sprained Achilles tendon on his right leg. The fight was postponed, then cancelled altogether.

Shortly after Audley Harrison (26–4, 20 KOs) defeated Michael Sprott (32–14, 17 KOs) on 9 April for the vacant European heavyweight title, EBU ordered him to fight the mandatory challenger Dimitrenko in his first defense. During the Sprott fight, Harrison allegedly suffered an injury that was going to keep him out of action for four months. Dimitrenko expressed doubt over the alleged injury: &quot;[Harrison] was wildly celebrating the victory, jumping and waving his arms. Then he had a surgery. The surgery took place on 24 April. So he was walking in pain for more than two weeks? And only after that he went under the knife? But I have not seen a single official document confirming the injury of an Englishman.&quot; Harrison openly stated his interest in fighting David Haye while also eyeing a bout against one of the Klitschkos; he admitted that the victory over Dimitrenko would pave him a way to the Klitschko bout as it would allow him to become the top 10 contender of each of the major sanctioning bodies. On 9 June, Harrison was stripped of the title.

Eventually Dimitrenko agreed to face Dennis Bakhtov (33–5, 23 KOs) for the vacant European heavyweight title on 30 July 2010 in Yekaterinburg, Russia. Bakhtov&#x27;s manager German Titov won the right to promote the bout with a purse bid of €260,000. A few days before the scheduled date, the bout was cancelled due to Bakhtov allegedly suffering an injury. However, there were rumours that the event was cancelled due to Titov&#x27;s financial problems. Instead, Yaroslav Zavorotnyi (14–4, 12 KOs) came in as a late replacement. The bout took place in Hamburg, Germany. Dimitrenko dominated the entire fight. In the fifth, Dimitrenko pressed Zavorotnyi to the corner and threw a barrage of unanswered punches, prompting Zavorotnyi&#x27;s corner to throw in the towel. Two successful defences were made in 2011 against British journeyman Michael Sprott and former world title challenger Albert Sosnowski. In February 2012, Dimitrenko announced that he had terminated his contract with Universum Box-Promotion. Soon after, Dimitrenko hired Scott Welch.

After two defenses of the European title, Dimitrenko agreed to face undefeated Bulgarian prospect Kubrat Pulev on 5 May 2012 on the undercard of Marco Huck vs. Ola Afolabi. 6 ft 4in tall Pulev, despite making his professional debut at a relatively late age, was highly regarded due to his amateur background and unorthodox fighting style, and was expected to be one of the most dangerous heavyweights to challenge Wladimir Klitschko for the heavyweight title. Many observers were giving both fighters an even chance to win, and expected the winner of this bout to fight for the title in the near future. Some observers expected the fight to bring Dimitrenko back into the world title contention. Pulev and his trainer Otto Ramin expected a tough fight although Dimitrenko had not fought since September 2011. Dimitrenko weighed in at , 12 lbs heavier than Pulev.

The fight took place at Messehalle in Erfurt, Germany, and was aired live on Das Erste. Dimitrenko started the fight well, using his height and reach to his advantage. He also moved well on his feet to avoid punishment. In round 4, Pulev began to find his range and began countering and landing some power punch combinations of his own, rocking Dimitrenko at times. Dimitrenko looked faded as he entered round 11. Pulev landed a jab which slowly dropped Dimitrenko to a knee. At this point, he had taken much punishment and remained down. Referee Guido Cavalleri counted him out, giving Pulev an 11th round KO win.

A stoppage loss to Pulev appeared to have derailed Dimitrenko&#x27;s career. Without a prominent promoter and trained by a local gym coach, Dimitrenko scored two uninspiring decisions against journeymen before entering a long stretch of inactivity. Despite rumours about his retirement appearing in the media, Dimitrenko insisted that he was going to return to the ring &quot;as soon as possible&quot;.

Dimitrenko would spend more than two years out of the sport, from March 2013 to May 2015. He made his return on 30 May 2015, defeating Patryk Kowoll by first-round TKO. He was slated to face former heavyweight champion Shannon Briggs in May 2016, but this fell through. On 1 October 2016, Dimitrenko was knocked out in three rounds by Joseph Parker. On 18 March 2017, in an upset, Dimitrenko knocked out undefeated heavyweight contender Adrian Granat in the first round to win the IBF International heavyweight title.

On 18 August 2018, Dimitrenko, ranked No. 10 heavyweight contender by the IBF at the time, faced Bryant Jennings, ranked No. 8 by the WBO and No. 11 by the WBA. Jennings ended the fight via a ninth-round TKO.

In his next fight, Dimitrenko faced WBA&#x27;s No. 11 and IBF&#x27;s No. 15 heavyweight contender Andy Ruiz Jr. Dimitrenko seemed disinterested during the fight, as Andy Ruiz Jr was dominating for most of the rounds. By the end of the fifth, Ruiz Jr started to hurt Dimitrenko, which resulted in Dimitrenko&#x27;s corner stopping the fight before the beginning of the sixth round.

On 13 July 2019, Dimitrenko faced former Olympic gold medal winner Tony Yoka. Yoka made easy work out of the veteran, knocking him out within three rounds in his home country of France.
