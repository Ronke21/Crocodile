<text>The London Lesbian and Gay Centre was a lesbian and gay community centre located at 67–69 Cowcross Street, London. It was established in 1985 by the Greater London Council (GLC), which donated three-quarters of a million pounds to its establishment.

In 1984 The GLC published &quot;Changing The World – a charter of gay rights&quot; and supported a number of open meetings in the council chamber of County Hall during that summer. These resulted in the creation of a working group to create one of the few LGBT community centres in the UK, after Edinburgh Gay Centre which opened in 1974, Manchester Gay Centre on Bloom Street (1981) and the Birmingham Lesbian and Gay Community Centre which had opened in 1976. The group included Brian Kennedy, Revd Richard Kirker, Helen Carr, Helen Jenkins, Alison Wheeler, Jaci Quennell, Jennifer Wilson and Lisa Power amongst many others.

==Building==
After looking at many buildings, the working group located a disused former meat warehouse near Smithfield market in Farringdon which could be suitably converted and this was purchased by the GLC. It opened unofficially in December 1984, with plans to include club/performance space, cooking and dining space, a bookshop, a daycare room, a lounge and meeting room, a media resource centre, offices and other meeting spaces. Plans were drawn up to convert the building to community use, with a club / theatre space in the basement, a bar and café on the ground floor with outdoor patio, and facilities for printing and photography on the first floor run by the Technical Resources Collective and who printed the Centre&#x27;s monthly diary (alongside) and other leaflets. The second floor was designated as women only space and the third (top) floor was converted to offices for the Centre management team, with some rooms being leased to other organisations, such as PACE. All areas of the building had full disabled access via a small passenger lift serving all floors, a larger (formerly goods) lift serving all except the top floor, and a ramp at the rear between the café-bar and the courtyard area, which overlooked the train and tube tracks. Many LGBT organisations were allowed to use the centre for postal purposes, such as &quot;Presente&quot;, the Lesbian and gay solidarity group for Nicaragua. Many others used the meeting rooms for regular groups.

As London&#x27;s first non-commercial gay venue the LLGC suffered from problems with volunteers, political infighting and general mismanagement due to staff turnover. With the abolition of the GLC in 1986 ownership of the building was transferred to the London Residuary Body. Although the centre&#x27;s management team kept the building in operation for another five years, mounting losses, including a robbery of several thousand pounds from the safe which insurers refused to cover because no force had apparently been used, resulted in its closure and subsequent sale.

==Events==

In June 1985, London&#x27;s Lesbian Strength march ended at the centre for the first time and a week later a special all-day event for the Lesbian and Gay Pride Parade was held.

The discussion/support group &#x27;New Beginnings&#x27; also met at 8 pm on Saturday nights at The Centre in the mid – late 1980s. This group was facilitated by a volunteer couple (John and Terry) and approximately 20 people who were in the early stages of &#x27;coming out&#x27; attended each week. Participants would start with a discussion upstairs, and then come back downstairs for a drink at the bar. The dates and times that the group met in August and September 1986 can be seen on the Programme of Events at the LLG&amp;C for August/September 1986 that are included on this page.

==Controversies==

One important controversy in the centre&#x27;s history was over whether to allow SM lesbians to use the centre. Arguments in favour included sexual freedom and the right of people to identify as SM; arguments against included that SM was oppressive, that lesbian mothers should not have to expose their children to it, and that SM practitioners wore Nazi clothing and thus were offensive and anti-Semitic. Disagreement also existed over whether to ban bisexual groups, as some lesbians felt that bisexual men might harass them. The groups were banned for five years. As the booking for the second national Bisexual conference had been accepted &quot;in error&quot; by the Centre, it was allowed to be held there in April 1985. The centre&#x27;s members voted to overturn the bans on BDSM and bisexual groups in June that year.

In 1988, East Sussex County Council banned a National Youth Bureau publication, listing voluntary work opportunities for young people, from distribution in its schools, as six of the listings were for gay and lesbian organisations. Particularly controversial was the LLGC listing, which sought volunteers with a &quot;positive attitude to their sexuality.&quot; J.A. Carter, Lewes County Education Officer, noted that the advertisement &quot;seem[ed] to promote homosexuality.&quot;

<text>Brian Mark Corrin (born July 4, 1945) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1977 to 1986, sitting as a New Democrat.

Corrin was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The son of Max Corrin and Celia Nick, Corrin was educated at the University of Manitoba (B.A. 1967, LL.B, 1970) and subsequently practiced as a lawyer with the City of Winnipeg Solicitor&#x27;s Office and then in private practise. From 1974 to 1977, he served as a New Democratic member of the Winnipeg City Council. During that period he also chaired the provincial Child Welfare Treatment Panel. In 1974, Corrin married Joy Margaret Kathleen Cooper. He later married Lorraine Monaster.

He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1977, defeating Tory candidate Geoff Dixon by over 1,000 votes in the north-end Winnipeg riding of Wellington. The Tories under Sterling Lyon won a majority government in this election, and Corrin sat with the opposition for the next four years as shadow Justice Minister.

When the NDP caucus met in 1979 to choose an interim leader following the resignation of Edward Schreyer, Corrin refused to cast a ballot and criticized the selection process. These actions may have ruined his chances for advancement within the party.

Corrin was easily re-elected in the redistributed riding of Ellice in the provincial election of 1981, as the NDP won a majority government under Howard Pawley. He did not receive a position in cabinet being appointed to be Legislative Assistant to the Ministers of Urban Affairs and Justice instead. In 1982 he was also appointed Legislative Assistant to the Premier.

In 1983, while still serving in the legislature, Corrin challenged incumbent Bill Norrie for election as mayor of Winnipeg. He was defeated, due primarily to public opposition to the Pawley government&#x27;s plans to re-entrench French language services in provincial law. He was also named Queens Counsel that year. He did not seek re-election to the legislature in 1986. In 1985 he was appointed chair of the provincial task force studying the impact of government regulations on business and continued in that role until 1987.

In 1988, he was named a provincial judge. In 1996, he was found guilty of misconduct by a panel of six judges and suspended for 30 days. In February 2011, Corrin was charged with assault and uttering threats against a family member. He was cleared of the charge in November 2011.

<text>Islami Jatiya Oikya Front (IJOF, Islamic National United Front) was a short-lived political alliance in Bangladesh. Formed in 2001, it was one of the three principal contenders in that year&#x27;s parliamentary elections. Led by the Jatiya Party (Ershad), it also included the Islami Shashontantra Andolan (ISA) and three other parties.

The founder of the ISA, Fazlul Karim, declared that IJOF&#x27;s intention was to establish an Islamic government. Other planks in the party platform included transforming Bangladesh into a federation of eight autonomous provinces, and prohibiting women from becoming prime minister.

The Jatiya Party (Ershad) fielded candidates in 281 of the country&#x27;s 300 parliamentary constituencies, leaving the remaining 19 to be contested by its junior partners. The front won 14 seats. It received 7.25% of the votes, and accordingly was allocated 3 of the 45 additional seats reserved for women.

The front collapsed after the 2001 election because, according to political scientist Ali Riaz, &quot;all of the 17 seats won by the alliance were JP candidates who preferred their party affiliation in the parliament&quot;.

<doc id="1309409" wikidata="Q1849361" url="?curid=1309409" title="Wurm Online">
<text>Wurm Online is a 3D massively multiplayer online video game (MMO) developed by Code Club AB (formerly Onetofree AB and Mojang Specifications AB) in Motala, Sweden. Development started in 2003 by friends Rolf Jansson and Markus Persson, and was released for personal computers using Java in 2006. Both player versus player and realm versus realm combat are possible in the game.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Wurm Online&quot; is a sandbox MMO game. The world of Wurm is a medieval-style fantasy setting. It consists of over a dozen persistent servers, either PvE or PvP. Travel between server islands is done by crossing the surrounding oceans by ship, or by teleportation via portal. The servers&#x27; terrain and landscape is changeable by players, who can lower and raise the land, change biomes and vegetation, and more. Aside from a few pre-made starter towns and a minimal amount of NPCs, everything on the originally wild-natured servers is built and managed by players: settlements, infrastructure, the economy and social interaction. 

The game has no character classes but over a hundred skills players can freely use and train, among them crafting and fighting skills; only characters that become priests accept restrictions in return for magical abilities. Players can use a detailed and expansive crafting system to build everything from equipment to houses to decorations. This encourages specialization and trade, where players can co-operate with each other to achieve goals and complete projects.

&quot;Wurm Online&quot; is free-to-play, with a skill cap that is suspended with a paid subscription (&quot;premium time&quot;), payable in real-world or in-game currency (&quot;silvers&quot;, which can be acquired in-game or bought). Players can rent land from the game for in-game currency, which offers full control and protection of the deeded land.

==Development==

&quot;Wurm&quot; is developed in Java and uses OpenGL for rendering the game. The development of the game was started by Rolf Jansson and Notch. &quot;Wurm&quot; first started its Beta stage in 2003 and had its official release in 2006. In 2007, Markus Persson left the company. When asked if &quot;Wurm&quot; would shut down due to his resignation, Markus said &quot;&quot;Wurm&quot;&#x27;s not going anywhere&quot;. In 2008, the main developer began publishing a blog.

In 2011, the main developer hired their first paid employee, a client developer. This was later followed by a lead artist being hired by the developer, resulting in a total of two known employees as of July 2011. The game was officially released in 2012.

In October 2015, a standalone version of &quot;Wurm Online&quot;, known as &quot;Wurm Unlimited&quot;, was released on Steam as an alternative payment method, having a one time fee rather than having a limited free trial and monthly fee, and is played on player-run servers instead of the main official servers.

In 2020, &quot;Wurm Online&quot; was also added to Steam, and introduced four new official servers.

==Reception==
&quot;Massively.com&quot; has, since 2012, begun regularly featuring &quot;Wurm&quot;, often doing live streams of the game and regularly posting news updates about &quot;Wurm&quot;. Massively have often praised &quot;Wurm&quot; for its no-limit freedom and for truly being a &quot;sandbox&quot; MMO with many different skills and abilities, criticizing only the &quot;maintenance mode&quot; that occurs when maintaining a (large) deed/village.

&quot;Tisthammer&quot; examined it in a &quot;First Impressions&quot; review. The distant landscapes were highlighted for their photographic quality, and the main appeal was seen in the interactivity of the world, but overall, it failed to keep the reviewer&#x27;s attention, feeling that MUD-style text-based combat has been eclipsed by modern MMORPGs.

A &quot;PC Gamer&quot; review after the official release was critical, with a score of 68%, citing the time commitment required as well as the lack of creativity in what a player could accomplish.

Christopher Steele of &quot;Topfreemmorpg.net&quot; praised &quot;Wurm Online&quot;″s gameplay and noted that it provides a true challenge to the players.

&quot;MMO Sandboxes&quot;″ reviewer Crescent Wolf described it as a &quot;true sandbox title&quot;.

<doc id="1309423" wikidata="Q524362" url="?curid=1309423" title="Lounès Matoub">
<text>Lounès Matoub (; ; 24 January 1956 – 25 June 1998) was an Algerian Kabylian singer, poet, and thinker who sparked an intellectual revolution, and mandole player who was an advocate of the Berber cause, human rights, and secularism in Algeria throughout his life.

Matoub was reviled by most of the Muslim population in Algeria for his secular and atheist politics along with his militant advocacy of Berber rights, so he was unpopular among both warring parties during the Algerian Civil War. His assassination, claimed by the Armed Islamic Group (GIA), in unclear circumstances, provoked violent riots in Kabylia.

==Early life==
Lounes Matoub was born on 24 January 1956 in the village of Taourirt Moussa in Algerian Kabylia. When he turned 9, he built his first guitar from an empty car oil can and composed his first songs as a teenager. His political and cultural identity was awakened by armed confrontations between Kabylians and government forces in 1963–1964. In 1968, the Algerian government introduced a policy of Arabization in the education system. Matoub reacted by skipping school; his memoirs recall: &quot;We had to give up Berber and reject French. I said no! I played hooky in all my Arabic classes. Every class that I missed was an act of resistance, a slice of liberty conquered. My rejection was voluntary and purposeful.&quot; By 1975, he had abandoned formal education. He left for France in search of work.

==Musical career==
Matoub began his singing career under the patronage of the established singer Idir. He recorded his first album &quot;Ay Izem&quot; (The Lion) in 1978; it was a phenomenal success. He went on to record 36 albums, as well as writing songs for other artists. He gave his first major concert in April 1980, at the time of the &quot;Berber Spring&quot; protest movement in Kabylia.

His music mixes Algerian Andalucian Chaabi orchestration with politicized Kabyle (Berber) lyrics, and covers a broad variety of topics including the Berber cause, democracy, freedom, religion, Islamism, love, exile, memory, history, peace and human rights. Unlike the Berber poet/musicians who preceded him, Matoub&#x27;s style was direct and confrontational. Fellow musician Mohamed Alileche recalls:

Despite being banned from Algerian radio and television during his life, Matoub became, and remains, an extremely popular Kabylian singer.

==Political events==
During the riots in October 1988, Matoub was shot five times by a policeman and left for dead. He was hospitalised for two years, requiring 17 surgeries, including the insertion of an artificial scrotum and the contraction of his leg by . His 1989 album &quot;L&#x27;Ironie du sort&quot; describes his long convalescence.

During the civil war, which began in 1992, the Islamist Armed Islamic Group added his name to a hitlist of artists and intellectuals. Matoub remained in Algeria. On 25 September 1994, he was abducted. He was held for two weeks in a GIA mountain stronghold and condemned to death. He was released following a large public demonstration in which his supporters threatened &quot;total war&quot; on the Islamists.

In 1994, he published his autobiography entitled &quot;Rebelle&quot; (Paris: Stock, 1995).

==Prizes==

*On 6 December 1994, Matoub received &quot;Le Prix de la Mémoire&quot; (&quot;The Memorial Prize&quot;) from Mrs. Danielle Mitterrand, President of &quot;La Fondation France Libertés&quot; (&quot;The French Liberties Foundation&quot;) in Paris; the prize recognises those who devote themselves to recording and preserving the impact of political events on ordinary lives.
*On 22 March 1995, the Canadian journalists&#x27; organisation SCIJ awarded him &quot;Le Prix de la Liberté d&#x27;Expression&quot; (&quot;The Prize for Freedom of Expression&quot;).
*On 19 December 1995, he received &quot;Le Prix Tahar Djaout&quot; (&quot;The Tahar Djaout Prize&quot;) from &quot;La Fondation Nourredine Abba&quot; (&quot;The Nourredine Abba Foundation&quot;) at UNESCO headquarters in Paris; the prize is named for an Algerian writer who was assassinated by Islamists in 1993.

==Assassination and aftermath==

On 25 June 1998, at approximately 12:30 pm local time, Matoub&#x27;s car was stopped at a roadblock while he was driving along a mountainous road in eastern Algeria (Kabylia). The car was fired upon by masked gunmen, killing Matoub and wounding his wife, Nadia Matoub, and two sisters-in-law. Within hours, news of Matoub&#x27;s murder had spread throughout Kabylia and thousands of angry mourners gathered around the hospital where his body was taken. The crowd shouted &quot;Pouvoir, Assassin&quot; (&quot;Government, Assassins&quot;). A week of violent riots followed his death. Young demonstrators clashed with riot police and attacked government property. On 28 June 1998 tens of thousands of people attended his funeral in front of his house in his native village. He was buried between a fig tree and a cherry tree, opposite the house he was born in. Matoub&#x27;s family played a scathing parody of the Algerian national anthem, which came from Matoub&#x27;s final album &quot;Lettre ouverte aux... &quot; (&quot;Open letter to...&quot;), released after his death (Gold-Disc). Matoub&#x27;s assassination occurred a week before a law excluding languages other than Arabic from public life was due to come into effect. Matoub had been an outspoken critic of this law.

On 30 June 1998 the GIA claimed responsibility for the assassination of Matoub.

On the first anniversary of his death, a general strike was observed in the Kabylian city of Tizi-Ouzou and thousands protested on the streets. Protesters broke into the town&#x27;s court room and tore down its scales of justice. The BBC reported that many Berber activists blamed the government for Matoub&#x27;s death and rejected its claim that Islamists were responsible.

Around 20,000 people marched in Tizi-Ouzou to mark the third anniversary of Matoub&#x27;s assassination.

His family have created a foundation in his name to promote his memory, cast light on the circumstances of his assassination and promote the values he defended. Two streets in France have been named after Matoub, one in Grenoble and one in Lyon.

On 18 July 2011, two men, Malik Madjnoun and Abdelhakim Chenoui, were convicted of killing Matoub, and sentenced to 12 years in jail. The one-day trial was suspended twice when Matoub&#x27;s family interrupted to insist the suspects were innocent. As Madjnoun and Chenoui had been in prison awaiting trial since 1999, they were released in 2012, having served their time.

==Political views of Matoub==

Matoub spoke out in favour of federalism, secularism, democracy, freedom of speech, the recognition of Berber as a national and official language, and the decentralization of public schools in Algeria.

For a period of time, he was a member of the Rally for Culture and Democracy, an opposition party in Algeria, although he had left the party by the time of his death.

<text>Belgreen is a census-designated place and unincorporated community in Franklin County, Alabama, United States, located nine miles west of Russellville and around 17 miles east of Red Bay on Alabama Highway 24. As of the 2010 census, its population was 129. Belgreen is a small district, composed of a condensed area of residency, the school, a small businesses.

==Demographics==
Belgreen was listed on the 1880 U.S. Census at the time it served as Franklin County Seat. It did not appear again until 2010 when it was listed as a Census Designated Place or CDP.

==History==
Belgreen was the county seat of Franklin County between 1878 and 1891. A post office was established in 1879, but it was later closed. The Franklin County Career Technical Center is now located on the site where the county courthouse and jail once stood. Due to this, the road between the Career Technical Center and the Science Hall of Belgreen High School is named Jail Springs Road. The courthouse and jail existed on this site after the county seat was moved from Frankfort, which is approximately seven miles north of Belgreen. The courthouse complex existed on the current grounds of the Career Technical Center until it burned and was eventually moved to Russellville.

Another interesting note is that the building that now exists as part of the After-School program at Belgreen High School was once a canning plant, one of the many businesses that once existed in Belgreen. Other businesses also included a second gas station and country store at the beginning of Highway 49, as well as a barber shop at the four-way intersection.

==Belgreen High School==
Any description of Belgreen would be incomplete without a given history of Belgreen High School, which has existed just south of Alabama Highway 24 for over sixty years.

The story of the naming of Belgreen tells of a young lawyer (who would later become a Franklin County Probate Judge) named Richard S. Watkins. Watkins named the town of Belgreen for a young lady named Belle, whom he was courting at the time. Other sources suggest the name was a purely subjective description of the local geography, constructed from the French word &quot;bel&quot;, an adjective meaning &quot;beautiful&quot;, and &quot;green&quot;. At first, the name was spelled &quot;Bellegreen.&quot; The spelling was changed over the years to Bellgreen and later to Belgreen as it is today. Another story recounts that a man named Abner Judd named the town for the beautiful woods and green hillsides in the area.

Between 1878 and 1891, the Franklin County seat was located at Belgreen. A courthouse was built there in 1879 on the site of the present campus of Belgreen High School. The courthouse burned in 1890, which prompted the move of the county seat back to Russellville.

In 1878 or 1879, the first school building was constructed of logs. The seats were made of rough split stumps. This building stood near the present-day intersection of AL HWY 24 and AL HWY 187 where Hester&#x27;s Store (now defunct) once stood. B.R. Fite was the first official principal of the school. The second site of the school was located east of the present site of Belgreen School. Two large rooms were built there in 1881 with a &quot;Woodmen of the World&quot; meeting room overhead. Nate Redwine served as the principal. The school grew rapidly in the early 1900s. There were so many students that some classes were held at the nearby Methodist Church building and in the old jailhouse located nearby.

Credit is given to Mr. and Mrs. John R. Guin for beginning Belgreen High School. They moved to Belgreen in 1902 and lived in the &quot;old jail&quot; building, adjacent to the site of the former courthouse. Mrs. Guin taught school in her living room in their early years at Belgreen, and later on, she also taught in the upstairs room of the jail. She is called the &quot;mother of Belgreen school&quot; for all of the kind things she did for school students and others in the community. Mrs. Guin also served as the postmaster of the town.

Mr. John R. Guin was a teacher. He went on to serve as superintendent of the Franklin County school system until he retired in 1931. He owned the first car in Belgreen and often lent it to be used as the community school bus.

In 1922 a vocational building was added to the campus. It was replaced in the mid-1960s with a new home economics/agriculture building. The old vocational building was renovated and served as the school&#x27;s media center until the old main building was demolished and a new building was constructed in 2000.

The first graduation commencement was held at Belgreen in 1925. Around this time, many of the smaller community schools were consolidated or abolished, sending students to join their counterparts at Belgreen.

The original main building was constructed in 1934. This brick veneer building consisted of five classrooms, an auditorium, and two offices (one of which served as the library). Otto Holloway served as the principal. An elementary wing was added to the original building in 1937 which contained eight classrooms over a spacious basement area. This building was nearly identical to the Red Bay High School constructed in 1927. The building was a brick &quot;U,&quot; one of the most popular school designs in Alabama at the time. Facing the school, the right wing of the &quot;U&quot; housed the elementary classes while the left wing held the high school. Once inside the school, after going under the stone entryway, the office of the principal was on your immediate left. A small room on the right served as the library. A large auditorium with double wooden seats that could be folded and stored was centrally located between the two wings.

During Talmadge Lee&#x27;s term as principal in 1940, a brick veneer home economics and agriculture building was constructed.

Belgreen has a state championship basketball team for two years in a row, 1949–1950. During this time, a concrete gymnasium was built across the highway from the main buildings.

Indoor restrooms were first added to the school in 1952 and other improvements were made at that time. A cafeteria was built in 1958 while James Glasgow served as principal.

A tunnel was constructed by the Alabama Highway Department in the early 1960s to allow students a safe route from the main campus to the gymnasium located across the street. Also during the 1960s, additional classrooms were constructed and the gymnasium was renovated and enlarged.

Belgreen High School was accredited by the Southern Association of Schools in 1960. The Franklin County Area Vocational Center, located adjacent to the school&#x27;s campus, was constructed in 1975 to offer vocational and technical courses for students from all the system&#x27;s schools.

Graduation of the class of 2001 ended almost 70 years of service for the main building, which was demolished later that year. At that time, construction was begun on a two-level modern building which contains numerous classrooms, offices, and a media center. The graduating class of 2001/2002 attended classes in makeshift buildings without the use of a proper building. Additionally, this class was the first to enter the new building as a student body prior to their graduation ceremonies in May 2002. Students and faculty moved into the new building in October 2002. Four years later, in 2007 a new lunchroom was completed directly in front of the old agricultural and home economics building. Also, a new gymnasium is being constructed next to the old gym and the baseball field, which should be in use in time for the 2007/2008 school year. The current gymnasium will remain standing to be used for practice and physical education class facilities.

==Today==

Belgreen is now known mostly for the basketball program at the high school, for which the girls&#x27; team won a 1A state championship in 2002. The size of Belgreen will be reduced somewhat after the planned addition of a four lane on Alabama Highway 24. The new lane of Highway 24 should cut through the area on the south side of Highway 24 in the only four-way intersection of the town.

What keeps the community of Belgreen alive today is the school and the surrounding area. Belgreen High School received a new state-of-the-art building during the Summer of 2002, which regenerated interest in the area. Also near this condensed area are many well-attended churches, as well as a community fire department house.

The Firehall - Located in close proximity, the firehall is home to the Belgreen Volunteer Fire Department. It also serves as a polling place during elections.

The Underground Lake - Locals tell stories of an underground body of water. Supposedly it is located near Belgreen High School, but there are as many alleged locations as there are people who have supposedly visited the &quot;lake.&quot; Purported locations of the &quot;Underground Lake&quot; are under Belgreen High School, &quot;down the road from BHS,&quot; etc. The lake, however, is not a myth. People are merely confused as to its real location. It is located under the hill that the Belgreen Church of Christ sits on. It is known for a fact that the entrance is located on a separate, privately owned property. It is also said that fish with no eyes occupy the lake.

The Rock Cut - This is a section of a large rock formation that is cut out, allowing for a smooth transition of Highway 24 from Russellville to Belgreen. It is actually the bottom of an ancient ocean, and the same limestone deposit is quarried elsewhere in the Belgreen area. The &quot;Rock Cut&quot; is a commonly referred to feature in local oral directions. The cut will have to be widened once the new lane of Highway 24 reaches it. It is unique cut from an engineering standpoint, as it is cut so as to allow for a four-way intersection. This gives it a cross-shape, which is obvious when viewed from the air.

Cedar Creek - Cedar Creek is a local body of water that is mostly known as a popular area for bass fishing. It is a part of the Bear Creek lake system, operated by the Tennessee Valley Authority. During the summer, fishing tournaments are held here nearly every weekend.

Glasgow Corners - Glasgow Corners is a local intersection approximately three miles south from the school, which is commonly referenced in many oral directions.

Slickrock - &quot;Slickrock&quot; refers to a number of public facilities provided by TVA around the northern portions of Belgreen along Cedar Creek. Features include a swimming area, a campground, and a boat launch. These locations are usually more popular during the summer, as Cedar Creek is drained by TVA during the cold weather months.

<text>A three-wheeler is a vehicle with three wheels. Some are motorized tricycles, which may be legally classed as motorcycles, while others are tricycles without a motor, some of which are human-powered vehicles and animal-powered vehicles.

== Overview ==
Many three-wheelers which exist in the form of motorcycle-based machines are often called trikes and often have the front single wheel and mechanics similar to that of a motorcycle and the rear axle similar to that of a car. Often such vehicles are owner-constructed using a portion of a rear-engine, rear-drive Volkswagen Beetle in combination with a motorcycle front end. Other trikes include that are specially constructed for off-road use.

Three-wheelers can have either one wheel at the back and two at the front (2F1R), (for example: Morgan Motor Company) or one wheel at the front and two at the back (1F2R) (such as the Reliant Robin). Due to better safety when braking, an increasingly popular form is the front-steering &quot;tadpole&quot; or &quot;reverse trike&quot; sometimes with front drive but usually with rear drive. A variant on the &#x27;one at the front&#x27; layout was the Scott Sociable, which resembled a four-wheeler with a front wheel missing.

Three-wheelers, including some cyclecars, bubble cars and microcars, are built for economic and legal reasons: in the UK for tax advantages, or in the US to take advantage of lower safety regulations, being classed as motorcycles. As a result of their light construction and potential better streamlining, three-wheeled cars are usually less expensive to operate.

Some inexpensive three-wheelers have been designed specifically to improve mobility for disabled people.

Three-wheeler transport vehicles known as auto rickshaws are a common means of public transportation in many countries in the world, and are an essential form of urban transport in many developing countries such as India and the Philippines.

== History ==
Early automotive pioneer Karl Benz developed a number of three-wheeled models. One of these, the Benz Patent Motorwagen, is regarded as the first purpose-built automobile. It was made in 1885.

In 1896, John Henry Knight showed a tri-car at The Great Exhibition.

In 1897, Edward Butler made the Butler Petrol Cycle, another three-wheeled car.

A Conti 6 hp Tri-car competed in (but did not complete) a 1907 Peking to Paris race sponsored by a French newspaper, .

== Configurations ==
=== Two front ===
A configuration of two wheels in the front and one wheel at the back presents two advantages: it has improved aerodynamics, and that it readily enables the use of a small lightweight motorcycle powerplant and rear wheel. This approach was used by the Messerschmitt KR200 and BMW Isetta. Alternatively, a more conventional front-engine, front wheel drive layout as is common in four-wheeled cars can be used, with subsequent advantages for transversal stability (the center of mass is further to the front) and traction (two driven wheels instead of one). Some vehicles have a front engine driving the single rear wheel, similar to the rear engine driving the rear wheel. The wheel must support acceleration loads as well as lateral forces when in a turn, and loss of traction can be a challenge.

A new tadpole configuration has been proposed with a rear engine driving the front wheels. This concept (Dragonfly Three Wheeler) claims both stability and traction (two driven wheels), as well as a unique driving experience.

With two wheels in the front (the &quot;tadpole&quot; form or &quot;reverse trike&quot;) the vehicle is far more stable in braking turns, but remains more prone to overturning in normal turns compared to an equivalent four-wheeled vehicle, unless the center of mass is lower and/or further forward. Motorcycle-derived designs suffer from most of the weight being toward the rear of the vehicle.

For lower wind resistance (which increases fuel efficiency), a teardrop shape is often used. A teardrop is wide and round at the front, tapering at the back. The three-wheel configuration allows the two front wheels to create the wide round surface of the vehicle. The single rear wheel allows the vehicle to taper at the back. Examples include the Aptera (solar electric vehicle) and Myers Motors NmG.

=== Two rear ===
Having one wheel in front and two in the rear for power reduces the cost of the steering mechanism but greatly decreases lateral stability when cornering while braking.

When the single wheel is in the front (the &quot;delta&quot; form, as in a child&#x27;s pedal tricycle), the vehicle is inherently unstable in a braking turn, as the combined tipping forces at the center of mass from turning and braking can rapidly extend beyond the triangle formed by the contact patches of the wheels. This type, if not tipped, also has a greater tendency to spin out (&quot;swap ends&quot;) when handled roughly.

=== Lateral stability ===
The disadvantage of a three-wheel configuration is that lateral stability is lower than with a four-wheeled vehicle.

With any vehicle, an imaginary line can be projected from the vehicles centre of mass to the ground, representing the force exerted on the vehicle by its mass. With the vehicle stationary, the line will be vertical. As the vehicle accelerates, that imaginary line tilts backward, remaining anchored to the centre of mass the point at which the line intersects the ground moves backward. As you brake it moves forward, with cornering it moves sideward. 
Should the point at which this line intersects the ground move outside of the boundary formed by connecting the tyre contact patches together (a rectangle for a four-wheeled car, or a triangle for a trike) then the vehicle will tip and eventually fall over. This is true for any vehicle.

With all vehicles it is critical that the vehicle should be engineered to slide before this point of instability is reached.

This can be achieved in several ways:
* by placing the center of mass closer to the ground
* by placing the center of mass closer to the axle with two wheels (for three wheelers)
* by increasing the track width
* by limiting the grip provided by the tyres, such that the vehicle loses adhesion before it starts to tip.
* By tilting some or all of the vehicle as it corners.

In the case of a three-wheeled ATV, tipping may be avoided by the rider leaning into turns.

== Tilting option ==

To improve stability some three-wheelers are designed to tilt while cornering like a motorcyclist would do. The tilt may be controlled manually, mechanically or by computer.

A tilting three-wheeler&#x27;s body or wheels, or both, tilt in the direction of the turn. Such vehicles can corner safely even with a narrow track.

Some tilting three-wheelers could be considered to be forms of feet forward motorcycles or cabin motorcycles or both.

== Electric three wheelers ==
=== Battery-powered three wheelers ===
Three-wheeled battery powered designs include:
* Aptera (solar electric vehicle)
* Arcimoto
* CityEl
* Commuter Cars Tango
* Cree SAM
* ElectraMeccanica SOLO
* Myers Motors NmG (formerly Corbin Sparrow)
* Nobe GT100
* Toyota i-Road
* Triac
* Vanderhall Edison 2
* ZAP Xebra
*EWheels EW 36(mobility scooter)

=== Solar-powered three wheelers ===
Here are three notable examples of solar-powered three wheelers; two race cars, the Infinium and the Sky Ace TIGA, and a vehicle planned for production, the Aptera.
The Infinium, built by the University of Michigan Solar Car Team, came in 3rd place in the 2009 World Solar Challenge held in Australia, and won the 2010 American Solar Challenge.

Ashiya University&#x27;s Sky Ace TIGA achieved at Shimojishima Airport, in Miyakojima, Okinawa, Japan, to win the Guinness World Record, on 20 August 2014. It took the record from another three-wheeler, Sunswift IV, designed and built at the University of New South Wales in Australia, by a margin of almost 
The Aptera solar electric vehicle uses a tadpole layout and is being designed to have a top speed of over 100 mph. The Aptera uses 42 KW in-wheel electric motors and can be ordered with two (front-wheel drive) or three (all-wheel drive) motors. The Aptera&#x27;s roof and dashboard, and optionally its hood and hatch, are fitted with solar panels, with the full compliment being designed to add a range of up to 40 miles per day and 11,000 miles per year in the sunniest climates. First customer availability is planned for before the end of 2024.

== Steam-powered three wheelers ==
The world&#x27;s first full-size self-propelled land vehicle was a three-wheeler. French Army Captain Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot&#x27;s 1770 &quot;fardier à vapeur&quot; (steam dray), a steam tricycle with a top speed of around 3 km/h (2 mph), was intended for hauling artillery.

Another of the earliest preserved examples is the Long steam tricycle, built by George A. Long around 1880 and patented in 1883, now on display at the Smithsonian Institution.

== Wind-powered three wheelers ==
The Whike is a recumbent tricycle with a sail, made in the Netherlands.

== All-terrain vehicles ==

Due to the incidence of injuries and deaths related to their use, a 10-year ban, entirely voluntary for manufacturers, was placed on the sale of new three-wheeled all-terrain vehicles in the United States in January 1988. More injuries were sustained by riders by not applying a proper riding technique, and lack of wearing proper safety gear such as helmets and riding boots. In a search conducted by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, it was determined that &quot;no inherent flaw was found in the three wheel design&quot;.

== Registration ==
In the U.S, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration defines and regulates three-wheeled vehicles as motorcycles.
However, in 2015 a bill was introduced in Congress that would prevent some three wheeled vehicles from being classified as motorcycles in the United States, instead creating a new classification for &quot;autocycles&quot;.

Driver&#x27;s license and registration requirements vary on a state-by-state basis. Some states require drivers of three wheeled vehicles to have a motorcycle license and register the vehicle as a motorcycle. Some states, including Virginia, Kansas, and Indiana, classify some three wheeled vehicles as autocycles. Virginia defines an autocycle as &quot;a three-wheeled motor vehicle that has a steering wheel and seating that does not require the operator to straddle or sit astride and is manufactured to comply with federal safety requirements for motorcycles.&quot; Indiana defines it as &quot;a three (3) wheeled motor vehicle in which the operator and passenger ride in a completely or partially enclosed seating area that is equipped with:(1) a rollcage or roll hoops; (2) safety belts for each occupant; and (3) antilock brakes;and is designed to be controlled with a steering wheel and pedals.&quot; In other jurisdictions, such as British Columbia, Canada, and Connecticut, a three-wheeled vehicle with an enclosed passenger compartment or partially enclosed seat is considered an automobile.

<doc id="1309538" wikidata="Q7188981" url="?curid=1309538" title="Consubstantiality">
<text>Consubstantiality, a term derived from , denotes identity of substance or essence in spite of difference in aspect.

It appears most commonly in its adjectival form, &quot;consubstantial&quot;, from Latin &quot;consubstantialis&quot;, and its best-known use is in regard to an account, in Christian theology, of the relation between Jesus Christ and God the Father.

== Theological use ==
The affirmation that Jesus Christ is &quot;consubstantial with the Father&quot; appears in the Nicene Creed. Greek was the language in which the Nicene Creed was originally enunciated. The word used was (&quot;homoousios&quot;) and means &quot;of the same substance.&quot; This may be contrasted with the term ὁμοιούσιος (&quot;homoiousios&quot;), meaning &quot;of like substance&quot; and, therefore, not the &quot;same substance,&quot; as was proposed, for example, at a later church council (the Council of Seleucia regarding the Arian controversy) in the year 359.

The term (ousia) is an Ancient Greek noun, formed on the feminine present participle of the verb , , meaning &quot;to be, I am&quot;, so similar grammatically to the English noun &quot;being&quot;. There was no equivalent grammatical formation in Latin, and it was translated as or and then indirectly into English as &quot;essence&quot; or &quot;substance&quot;. Cicero coined and the philosopher Seneca and rhetorician Quintilian used it as equivalent for , while Apuleius rendered both as or . In order to designate , early Christian theologian Tertullian favored the use of over , while Augustine of Hippo and Boethius took the opposite stance, preferring the use of as designation for .

The word &quot;consubstantial&quot; was used by the Council of Chalcedon (451) to declare that Christ is &quot;consubstantial with the Father in respect of the Godhead, and the same consubstantial with us in respect of the manhood&quot;.

In contemporary Christian theology, the Holy Spirit is also described as consubstantial with the Father and Son.

== Alternative translations of the Nicene-Creed term ==

In the 1662 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; of the Church of England, the adjective &quot;consubstantial&quot; in the Nicene Creed is rendered by the phrase &quot;being of one substance&quot;. The same phrase appeared already in the Book of Common Prayer (1549) and continues to be used, within &quot;Order Two&quot;, in &quot;Common Worship&quot;, which within &quot;Order One&quot; gives the ecumenical English Language Liturgical Consultation version, &quot;of one Being&quot;.

The Eastern Orthodox Church use &quot;of one essence&quot;.

The Catholic Church, in its official translation of the Nicene Creed, keeps the term &quot;consubstantial&quot;.

== In rhetoric ==
In rhetoric, &quot;consubstantiality&quot;, as defined by Kenneth Burke, is &quot;a practice-related concept based on stylistic identifications and symbolic structures, which persuade and produce acceptance: an acting-together within, and defined by, a common context&quot;. To be consubstantial with something is to be identified with it, to be associated with it; yet at the same time, to be different from what it is identified with. It can be seen as an extension or in relation to the subject.

Burke explains this concept with two entities, A and B. He goes on to explain that &quot;A is not identical with his colleague, B. But insofar as their interests are joined, A is identified with B. Or he may identify himself with B even when their interests are not joined, if he assumes they are, or is persuaded to believe so...In being identified with B, A is &#x27;substantially one&#x27; with a person other than himself. Yet at the same time, he remains unique, an individual locus of motives. Thus he is both joined and separate, at once a distinct substance and consubstantial with another.&quot;

&quot;Consubstantiality may be necessary for any way of life, Burke says. And thus rhetoric, as he sees it, potentially builds community. It can tear it down as well. In the end, rhetoric relies on an unconscious desire for acting-together, for taking a &#x27;sub-stance&#x27; together&quot;.

<text>Joshua Adrian Kronfeld (born 20 June 1971) is a TV presenter and a former rugby union footballer who represented New Zealand at international level and Otago, the Highlanders and Leicester at first-class level. During his international career, Kronfeld played in 56 games for the All Blacks, gaining 54 test caps, including appearances at both the 1995 and 1999 Rugby World Cups.

Kronfeld played as an openside flanker, and his greatest attribute was considered to be the speed with which he was able to get to breakdowns in play, in order to gain or regain possession of the ball. Kronfeld is an alumnus of Aquinas College, Dunedin, and is a grand-nephew of two All Blacks of the 1930s, brothers Dave and Frank Solomon.

==Early life==
Kronfeld was born in Hastings in Hawkes Bay, and attended Hastings Boys&#x27; High School. Kronfeld described himself as &quot;German-Samoan&quot; and he is Jewish.
He played his early rugby union at scrum-half and centre, switching to flanker at high school.

In 1990 Kronfeld moved to Dunedin to study physical education at the University of Otago. Here he became involved in the Otago University Rugby Club. After playing one game in 1992, Kronfeld gained a starting position in the Otago team in the National Provincial Championship (NPC) for 1993. Kronfeld would eventually play 69 matches for Otago. He completed his BPhEd degree in 1993.

== Rugby career==

Kronfeld made his All Black test debut in 1995, playing against Canada at Eden Park in Auckland. He played in the 1995 Rugby World Cup including the final in which the All Blacks lost a thrilling game to South Africa.

After the inception of the Super 12 competition in 1996, Kronfeld also played for the Highlanders Super 12 franchise. In total, Kronfeld made 42 appearances for the Highlanders.

He made five appearances in the All Blacks’ 1999 World Cup campaign, which included the game against England and the amazing semi-final with France that took place at Twickenham.

Kronfeld remained a first choice player for Otago, the Highlanders and the All Blacks until 2000. At the end of the 2000 season, after 69 matches for Otago, 42 for the Highlanders in the Super 12 and 56 All Black matches including 54 tests, Kronfeld left New Zealand rugby to take up a lucrative contract with the English club, Leicester. In May 2001 he officially signed with English club Leicester Tigers.

After an injury-hit start to the 2001-02 season Kronfeld recovered well, establishing himself as a regular first-team player. He was an unused replacement as Leicester won the 2002 Heineken Cup Final. He was twice voted by fans Player of the Month, once Zurich Premiership Player of the Month and then named by his Tigers colleagues as their Players&#x27; Player of the Season 2002-03.

In 2003, Kronfeld returned to New Zealand, and subsequently retired from first-class rugby.

==Life after rugby==

Kronfeld has made numerous media appearances, e.g. Celebrity Treasure Island. He has also returned to the University of Otago to study physiotherapy.

In 2009 Kronfeld participated in the fifth season of TVNZ&#x27;s entertainment series &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;.

From September to December 2012 Josh Kronfeld hosted the ChoiceTV show Brunch (New Zealand) for Season One with April Ieremia.

<doc id="1309542" wikidata="Q5450408" url="?curid=1309542" title="Finite thickness">
<text>In formal language theory, in particular in algorithmic learning theory, a class &quot;C&quot; of languages has finite thickness if every string is contained in at most finitely many languages in &quot;C&quot;. This condition was introduced by Dana Angluin as a sufficient condition for &quot;C&quot; being identifiable in the limit.
==The related notion of M-finite thickness==

Given a language &quot;L&quot; and an indexed class &quot;C&quot; = { &quot;L&quot;1, &quot;L&quot;2, &quot;L&quot;3, ... } of languages, a member language &quot;L&quot;&quot;j&quot; ∈ &quot;C&quot; is called a minimal concept of &quot;L&quot; within &quot;C&quot; if &quot;L&quot; ⊆ &quot;L&quot;&quot;j&quot;, but not &quot;L&quot; ⊊ &quot;L&quot;&quot;i&quot; ⊆ &quot;L&quot;&quot;j&quot; for any &quot;L&quot;&quot;i&quot; ∈ &quot;C&quot;.
The class &quot;C&quot; is said to satisfy the MEF-condition if every finite subset &quot;D&quot; of a member language &quot;L&quot;&quot;i&quot; ∈ &quot;C&quot; has a minimal concept &quot;L&quot;&quot;j&quot; ⊆ &quot;L&quot;&quot;i&quot;. Symmetrically, &quot;C&quot; is said to satisfy the MFF-condition if every nonempty finite set &quot;D&quot; has at most finitely many minimal concepts in &quot;C&quot;. Finally, &quot;C&quot; is said to have M-finite thickness if it satisfies both the MEF- and the MFF-condition.

Finite thickness implies M-finite thickness. However, there are classes that are of M-finite thickness but not of finite thickness (for example, any class of languages &quot;C&quot; = { &quot;L&quot;1, &quot;L&quot;2, &quot;L&quot;3, ... } such that &quot;L&quot;1 ⊆ &quot;L&quot;2 ⊆ &quot;L&quot;3 ⊆ ...).

<text>André Jaunet (May 17, 1911 – December 13, 1988) was a French-Swiss flutist. In later years he worked as a teacher in Zürich, Switzerland, where he taught flautists Peter-Lukas Graf and Aurèle Nicolet, Conrad Klemm among others.

== Biography ==
André Jaunet was born on May 17, 1911, in Corné, France. From 1924 to 1927, he studied with Etienne Moncelet in Angers. From 1927 to 1929, he completed his studies with Marcel Moyse in Paris. From 1929 to 1931 he studied at the Paris Conservatory under Philippe Gaubert. In 1937, he married Clotilde Faillettaz. They had two children: Philippe Jaunet (born 1938), and Yvonne Jaunet (born 1940).

On December 13, 1988, André Jaunet died at the age of 77 in Zürich after a battle with liver cancer. His ashes are in his beloved native French village of Corné in Anjou&#x27;s Loire Valley.

== Career ==
After occupying the principal flute positions of the Opera de Lille (France), in the Stadtorchester Winterthur (Switzerland), and the Bern Symphony Orchestra (Switzerland), Jaunet moved to Zürich, Switzerland, where he was principal flutist in the Tonhalle Orchestra from 1938 to 1978. He taught at the Conservatory and Musikhochschule (now Zürcher Hochschule der Künste) from 1938 to 1981. In 1973 he accepted a year-long guest professorship at the Hochschule für Musik Freiburg (Germany). In 1977, he was a guest professor at the University of Toronto (Canada) for one year. He participated as a juror in many competitions outside Switzerland. Jaunet held summer courses in Banff (Canada), Japan, Sweden, Holland and, near the end of his life (between 1982 and 1988), gave annual masterclasses in the Swiss cities of Thun and Obersaxen.

=== Teaching ===

André Jaunet was mostly remembered as a vivid, dedicated teacher. His pupils included Aurèle Nicolet, Peter-Lukas Graf, Robert Aitken, Jean-Claude Gérard and Emmanuel Pahud.

=== Solo work ===
During his life, besides occupying the principal flutist chair in the Tonhalle, he was active performing as a solo flutist with many orchestras. These included: the Zurich Chamber Orchestra (under the direction of Edmond de Stoutz), the Collegium Musicum Zürich (under conductor Paul Sacher), and the Festival Strings Lucerne (under conductor Rudolf Baumgartner).

=== Musical ensembles ===
For many years, Jaunet played with the Zürich Woodwind quintet, which included André Raoult on oboe, Rolf Kubli on clarinet, Rudolf Leuzinger on bassoon, and Werner Speth on horn. From 1947 to 1962, Jaunet was involved in baroque chamber music in the Zunfthaus zur Meise in Zürich, where he played with Hans Andreae (harpsichord), James Whitehead (cello), Claude Starck (cello), Karl Maria Schwamberger (viola da gamba), Hugues Cuenod (tenor), Hermann Leeb (lute, guitar), Heribert Lauer (violin) and others. Jaunet was also involved in performing modern works and analyzing Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Woodwind Quintet.&quot; In 1961, he performed Pierre Boulez&#x27;s &quot;Sonatine for flute and piano&quot; with Maria Bergmann in Zürich&#x27;s Tonhalle, in the presence of the composer.

== Awards and prizes ==
In 1931, at the age of 20, he was awarded the Paris Conservatory&#x27;s First Prize for flute. In 1939 he won the First Prize at the International Music Competition of Geneva. In 1966, the French government awarded Jaunet the Legion of Honour.

== Discography ==
Although many are out of stock, Jaunet recorded several records over his career. &quot;André Jaunet: The Art of the Great Flutist&quot; is a 3-CD set that was produced posthumously, with the help of his wife, Clotilde Faillettaz Jaunet, by producer Mr. Muramatsu and Jaunet&#x27;s former students, Aurèle Nicolet, Peter-Lukas Graf, Guenter Rumpel, Kiyoshi Kasai, and musician Michel Kurz.

<doc id="1309558" wikidata="Q2916222" url="?curid=1309558" title="Curiosity killed the cat">
<text>&quot;Curiosity killed the cat&quot; is a proverb used to warn of the dangers of unnecessary investigation or experimentation. The original form of the proverb, now rarely used, was &quot;Care killed the cat&quot;. In the previous instance, &quot;care&quot; was defined as &quot;worry&quot; or &quot;sorrow for others&quot;.

==Origin==
The earliest printed reference to the original proverb appears in the 1598 play, &quot;Every Man in His Humour&quot;, written by the English playwright Ben Jonson:
The play was first performed by Shakespeare&#x27;s playing company, the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men. Shakespeare used a similar quote in his circa 1599 play, &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;:

The proverb remained the same until at least 1898. Ebenezer Cobham Brewer included this definition in his &quot;Dictionary of Phrase and Fable&quot;:

==Transformation==
The origin of the modern variation is unknown. It is found in an Irish newspaper from 1868: &quot;They say curiosity killed a cat once.&quot; An early printed reference to the actual phrase &quot;Curiosity killed the cat&quot; is in James Allan Mair&#x27;s 1873 compendium &quot;A handbook of proverbs: English, Scottish, Irish, American, Shakesperean, and scriptural; and family mottoes&quot;, where it is listed as an Irish proverb on page 34.
In the 1902 edition of &quot;Proverbs: Maxims and Phrases&quot;, by John Hendricks Bechtel, the phrase &quot;Curiosity killed the cat&quot; is the lone entry under the topic &quot;Curiosity&quot; on page 100.

O. Henry&#x27;s 1909 short story &quot;Schools and Schools&quot; includes a mention that suggests knowledge of the proverb had become widespread by that time:

The phrase itself was the headline of a story in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 1916 about a cat who had climbed the flue of a chimney, and died after falling down to a lower floor.

Despite these earlier appearances, the proverb has been wrongly attributed to Eugene O&#x27;Neill, who included the variation, &quot;Curiosity killed a cat!&quot; in his play &quot;Diff&#x27;rent&quot; from 1920:

== Variations ==

===&quot;…but satisfaction brought it back&quot;===
A variation of the idiom is followed by the rejoinder &quot;but satisfaction brought it back&quot;.

On 10 August 1905, &quot;The Galveston Daily News&quot; newspaper (page 6) printed the following quotation without the word &quot;satisfaction&quot;:
On 23 December 1912, the earliest known printed reference to this variation of the proverb is found in &quot;The Titusville Herald&quot; newspaper (page 6):

&lt;poem&gt;You will find greater values here. We are told:
&quot;Curiosity killed the cat,
But satisfaction brought it back.&quot;
It is the same story with groceries.
&quot;Prices will sell Groceries, but it is always finality that brings the buyer back.&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

The proverb appears to have become well known soon after, as these quotes indicate.

The Harrisburg &quot;Patriot&quot; newspaper (page 2), 26 March 1917:

&quot;The Jewell Record&quot; newspaper (page 3), 15 May 1924:

===Modern usage===
The album &quot;New Values&quot; (1979) by Iggy Pop contains the song &quot;Curiosity&quot; written by Iggy Pop and Scott Thurston. The song includes the following lines:
Curiosity killed the cat but what it found brought it back.
Stephen King&#x27;s 1977 horror novel, &quot;The Shining&quot;, includes the following lines:
Curiosity killed the cat, my dear redrum.
Redrum my dear, satisfaction brought him back.

<text>Nicollet Mall station ( ) is a light rail station on the Metro Blue Line and Green Line in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Adjacent to the light rail platforms is the southbound Metro Orange Line bus rapid transit station [[Marq2 transit corridor|Marquette &amp; 5th Street]].

This station is located on 5th Street South, between Nicollet Mall and Marquette Avenue in Minneapolis. This is a center-platform station with one westbound traffic lane south of the platform. Service began at this station when the Blue Line opened on June 26, 2004. In 2013 Metro Transit began constructing an additional northbound platform in conjunction with and as part of the Nic on Fifth apartment building. The additional platform was built to provide additional comfort and safety at the station, as well as alleviating overcrowding and providing additional capacity for Southwest LRT. While scheduled open March 2017, the new platform was opened December 22 later that year. It is the only station on the system where passengers can regularly board from either side of the train.

==Design and public art==
The original station was designed by ESG Architecture &amp; Design, with Thomas Rose as the design team artist. To reflect the tall buildings of downtown and vibrant energy of Nicollet Mall, the station&#x27;s design incorporates undulating steel columns down the center flanked by dual curving metal roofs. This design earned the station the affectionate nickname &quot;The Roller Coaster&quot;. The new northbound platform was designed by ESG&#x27;s Trace Jacques, who also served as project designer for Nic on Fifth.

The public art installation, &quot;Small Kindness, Weather Permitting&quot;, by Janet Zweig has four interactive boxes at the station: &quot;Please turn the wheel #11&quot;, &quot;Thanks a million #28&quot;, &quot;Ring the bell and see #19&quot;, and &quot;Hit the bell! #1&quot;.

<doc id="1309565" wikidata="Q257144" url="?curid=1309565" title="The Pastures of Heaven">
<text>The Pastures of Heaven is a short story cycle by John Steinbeck published by Brewer, Warren and Putnam in 1932.

This episodic collection is composed of ten self-contained but related stories set in the Corral de Tierra of the Salinas Valley of California.

&quot;The Pastures of Heaven&quot; was said by one critic &quot;to rival &quot;The Long Valley&quot; (1938) as Steinbeck&#x27;s major achievement in short fiction&quot;.

==Short story cycle: Chapters I-XII==
The stories are presented here as per literary critics Richard. S. Hughes and Warren French. For clarity, the focal character is listed with the numerical section, as per Hughes.
*Chapter I (Prologue)
*Chapter II (&quot;George Battle&quot;) 
*Chapter III (&quot;Shark Wicks&quot;)
*Chapter IV (&quot;Tularecito&quot;)
*Chapter V (&quot;Helen Van Deventer&quot;)
*Chapter VI (&quot;Julius Maltby&quot;)
*Chapter VII (&quot;The Lopez Sisters&quot;)
*Chapter VIII (&quot;Molly Morgan&quot;)
*Chapter IX (&quot;Raymond Banks&quot;)
*Chapter X (&quot;Pat Humbert&quot;)
*Chapter XI (&quot;The Whitesides&quot;)
*Chapter XII (Epilogue)

==Reception==
Characterizing &quot;The Pastures of Heaven&quot; as a collection of short stories rather than a novella, &quot;Saturday Review&quot; (November 26, 1932), praises Steinbeck for an aptitude that promises &quot;richly human fiction&quot; limited by merely &quot;journalistic talent rather than of a creative imagination&quot;.

Critic Anita Moffet in &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;, November 20, 1932, reports Steinbeck conveys &quot;deep feeling for the tragedy implicit in each situation…his writing is noteworthy for originality of phrase and image and a strongly poetic feeling&quot;.

&quot;The Nation&quot; in its &quot;Shorter Notices&quot; section (December 7, 1932) remarks on the dichotomous structure of the book - &quot;Not really a novel, nor yet a book of short stories&quot;, - and classifies the stories as &quot;sketches&quot;. Praising the collection&#x27;s &quot;excellent analytical narratives, written in supple prose&quot;, the review closes with this caveat: &quot;If Steinbeck could add social insight to his present equipment he would be a first-rate novelist&quot;. Literary critic Joseph R. McElrath, Jr. reports that the book &quot;received a majority of positive reviews acknowledging the young writer&#x27;s promise&quot;.

==Background==
As early as May, 1931 Steinbeck reported that he was at work on a &quot;series of related stories&quot;. In a letter to his agent Mavis McIntosh at McIntosh &amp; Otis, Steinbeck wrote: &quot;The manuscript is made up of stories, each one complete in itself, having its rise, climax and ending. Each story deals with a family or an individual.&quot;

The stories are based largely on a local Salinas Valley family, the Morans, whose history and character Steinbeck knew well. The Morans appear as the &#x27;Munroes&quot; in &quot;The Pastures of Heaven&quot; cycle and provide a &quot;connecting link&quot; for the narratives.

Steinbeck completed the manuscript in December 1931. The publication of the book was complicated by a number of publisher bankruptcies. and was finally released by Brewer, Warren and Putnam in late 1932.

==Form and structure==
The organization of the book&#x27;s narrative into ten &quot;chapters&quot; has elicited commentary among critics. Biographer Warren French writes: &quot;Argument still continues as to whether &quot;The Pastures of Heaven&quot; is a &#x27;novel&#x27; at all or simply a loosely related collection of short stories.&quot;

As a series of &quot;autonomous stories&quot; &quot;The Pastures of Heaven&quot; may be classified with &quot;short-story cycles&quot; comparable to Sherwood Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; (1919) or William Faulkner&#x27;s &quot;The Unvanquished&quot; (1938). As such, the tales which are simply presented numerically by Roman numerals, &quot;can stand by themselves&quot; as works of short fiction.

Steinbeck&#x27;s fiction includes &quot;short story cycles&quot; in which the stories may be &quot;highly unified&quot; as in his novel-like Tortilla Flat (1935), or only loosely associated, as in The Red Pony (1933) comprising only three stories.

&quot;The Pastures of Heaven&quot; was conceived by Steinbeck as a short story cycle. The unifying device is the presence of a single family residing in the valley, the Munroes, who appear, often as a physical link, in all the tales.

Literary critic Robert S. Hughes, Jr. emphasizes that the Munroe family exerts a passive, but often decisive influence, serving as &quot;the catalyst but not the true cause of the downfall of several of their unsuspecting neighbors&quot;.
The collection is also marked by an adamant irony that appears in the title itself, as well as the prologue and epilogue. Hughes writes:

==Theme==
Biographer Warren French locates the key thematic element in &quot;the heavy use of the kind of irony&quot; that was encouraged by &quot;New Critics&quot; of the 1930s. The narratives place emphasis on the disparity between the aspirations of Steinbeck&#x27;s protagonists and their &quot;frustrating fulfillments&quot;.

In a May, 1931 letter to literary agent Mavis McIntosh, Steinbeck explained how devise the setting and thematic material for his story cycle:

==Plot summaries and analysis==
===Chapter I===
During the early pastoral period of California colonial occupation in 1776, a Spanish corporal and his mounted troopers pursue and capture a group of Indians - fugitive slaves from the Carmelo mission. En route, the corporal is enchanted by a lovely and verdant valley he dubs &quot;Las Pasturas del Cielo&quot;; he vows to return and settle there. The corporal contracts syphilis from an Indian concubine and suffers slow death before he can fulfill his dream. The valley remains unclaimed.

The prologue establishes the &quot;ironic premise&quot; that informs the subsequent stories. The Eden-like landscape is juxtaposed with the &quot;misfortune and tragedy&quot; suffered by subsequent inhabitants of the valley. Warren French writes: &quot;[T]he defeat of [the corporal&#x27;s] dreams established the pattern for the tales constituting the book, which become - through the presence of the Munroe family - a novel than simply a collection of short stories.&quot;

===Chapter II===

The idyllic valley was gradually occupied by settlers in the mid-19th century. George Battle, age 18, fleeing the military draft. buys land and marries. His wife, a &quot;religious fanatic and epileptic&quot;, bears a son: she is soon committed to an insane asylum. A succession of owners subsequently take possession of the parcel, each suffering a violent or mysterious fate. The Battle ranch earns a reputation as inherently evil. When Bert Munroe acquires the land, he and his young family appear to rehabilitate the reputation of the property among the community. Their very normalcy and innocence portends a revival of the Battle ranch curse.

The revival of sinister effects of the ranch are foreshadowed in Steinbeck&#x27;s brief portraits of the Munroe family members. Now prosperous, Bert, his wife Mrs. Munroe and their teenage children, Mae and Jimmie, inadvertently intrude into the affairs of their neighbors. Community-minded and generally well-meaning, their behavior is frequently destabilizing and destructive to the most vulnerable residents of the valley.

===Chapter III===
Edward &quot;Shark&quot; Wicks, his wife Katherine and their daughter Alice subsist on a very modest income from their farm produce.. Alice is strikingly beautiful and innocent. Though never abusive, Shark secretly covets her as he would a valuable art object. Fearing suitors, he constantly inquires about her &quot;condition&quot; provoking exasperation in Katherine. Shark has cultivated a reputation among his neighbors as an investment wizard and a miser who conceals his riches. He maintains a make-believe ledger through which he &quot;manages&quot; his fortune. The seventeen-year-old Jimmie Munroe, styling himself a &quot;casanova&quot; attempts to seduce Alice at a local party and steals a kiss: gossip ensues. Shark flies into a near homicidal rage, suspecting his daughter has been deflowered. He advances on the Munroe home with a loaded rifle in search of Jimmie, but is intercepted by a deputy sheriff. Bert Munroe hysterically accuses Shark of attempted murder. The bond hearing reveals that Shark is virtually penniless, exposing the myth of his purported wealth and business acumen. Shattered and shamed, his wife finds a new strength in herself to face the family&#x27;s disgrace. Shark rallies at Katherine&#x27;s faith in his potential to be a genuine success. The family leaves the valley forever.

Biographer Robert S. Hughes, Jr. ranks the Shark Wicks narrative among the finest in the collection. The brief, yet revealing emergence of Katherine Wick&#x27;s sense of self in her husband&#x27;s moment of truth is a key thematic element in the tale. Hughes cites this passage:

Warren French suggests that the Wicks family &quot;may have been served by the destruction of an illusion&quot; thereby freeing Shark, Katherine and Alice from their stultifying existence in the valley.

===Chapter IV===
Tularecito or &quot;little frog&quot; is a physically deformed man-child. Abandoned in infancy, he is raised by a local ranch owner. Even as a little boy he possesses immense physical strength. A superb farm worker, he is particularly skilled at caring for animals. He is normally passive and tractable: his only outbursts occur when his handiwork is molested. Tularecito begins to attend school at age eleven. Though lacking any aptitude for reading and writing, he reveals an extraordinary talent for drawing highly naturalistic and accurate images of local animals on the chalkboard. When he finds his creations erased in the morning, he flies into a rage; the traumatized teacher resigns. A new instructor, Miss Morgan, recognizes Tularecito&#x27;s special needs and encourages them. She introduces him to fairy tales; he is particularly fascinated by the habits of gnomes. Lacking any intimate human relationships, Tularecito comes to believe that these mythical beings are members of his own race. Wishing to assuage his loneliness, he embarks on a quest to discover the Gnome&#x27;s cave-dwellings. His search leads him to Bert Munroe&#x27;s orchard, where he begins digging a tunnel at the base of a peach tree. He returns the next day to find Bert filling in the hole. Infuriated, Tularecito beats Bert senseless with the shovel. When a group of local men arrive to investigate they subdue him after a violent struggle. Tularecito is committed to an asylum for the criminally insane.

The fate of gnome-like Tularecito is virtually preordained. The residents of &quot;The Pastures of the Valley&quot;, with few exceptions, find the &quot;little frog&quot; socially repulsive. Miss Morgan is responsible for encouraging his futile search for allies that do not exist; the Munroes, in this instance, are not culpable. Critic French places Tularecito in the same category as William Faulkner&#x27;s Benjy Compson in &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot; (1929) and Steinbeck&#x27;s Lennie in &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; (1937).

===Chapter V===
Helen Van Deventer is a wealthy widow. Her husband was killed in a hunting accident. Pregnant, she gave birth to a daughter, Hilda, six months later. A sickly but pretty child, the girl began to exhibit violent, destructive tendencies in her infancy. The family doctor advised Helen to seek psychiatric treatment for her daughter. She opted to endure rather than seek a cure. The doctor is exasperated by the mother&#x27;s callousness. Hilda begins to report elaborate and bizarre dreams. She hints that a man is trying to abduct her. At thirteen she runs away and is found days later in Los Angeles. Increasingly delusional and violent, the doctor advises the now-adolescent to be placed in an asylum. The mother refuses, content to play the martyr. Helen moves with her daughter and servants to a custom built house in Pastures of Heaven. Bert Munroe, inquisitive like the other locals, takes a walk to the new estate. He hears a girl screaming from a second floor window; she tells Bert she is being starved. He knocks on the front door to investigate, but is turned away repeatedly by the butler and returns home disgusted. When Helen is informed that a strange man has spoken to Hilda, she is alarmed. Helen discovers that Hilda has escaped from the house after nightfall. She removes a rifle from her husband&#x27;s collection and ventures outside. She locates her daughter near a stream and murders her, later positioning the rifle to make the death appear as a suicide. No one, not even the family doctor, suspects Helen of homicide.

Helen Van Deventer, who suffers from mental illness—like her daughter Hilda—is distinguished from the intellectually deficient Tularecito in that she is immune from the consequences of his madness. Wealthy and intelligent, she indulges in sado-masochism and declines to relinquish it. Bert Munroe&#x27;s involvement in precipitating the murder is entirely coincidental, though decisive.

===Chapter VI===
The 35-year old Junius Maltby, a bank clerk, moves to The Pastures of Heaven and marries the widow from whom he rents a room on a small ranch. Junius proves to be utterly inept as a farmer, and after several years the property is in disrepair. Notwithstanding, he is entirely content to spend the day reading histories and literature. Shortly after his wife gives birth to a son, she dies in the Influenza pandemic of 1918. Julius raises the child alone. Julius engages a German immigrant laborer; as lazy as his employer, the two men engage in endless philosophical discussions. The boy, Robbie, grows up half-wild but enjoys his father&#x27;s affection and literary knowledge.

When Robbie turns five, the school board demands he attend kindergarten, despite his father&#x27;s objections. The children take note of the boy&#x27;s ragged clothes and unkempt hair, but his openness and composure impress them. Intellectually precocious, Robbie organizes the younger boys into the Boy Auxiliaries. Miss Morgan, the teacher, discovers that, though highly articulate, the boy does not know how to write. She is intrigued, and visits the Malby farm. Miss Morgan is charmed by Junius&#x27; erudition and eccentricities. The board notes Robbie&#x27;s shabby overalls, and presents him with a charity gift of clothing: Robbie bolts from the room in anger and shame. Bert Munroe and his spouse compound the insult by visiting Junius and chastising him. Humiliated and stigmatized, father and son abandon the farm and move to the city.

Robbie is named after Robert Louis Stevenson, one his father&#x27;s favorite authors. The thematic center of the story is based in a line from Stevenson: &quot;There is nothing so monstrous that we can believe it of ourselves.&quot; As such, Junius submits to the judgment of Mrs. Munroe and her &quot;respectable&quot; neighbors: Robbie must be saved from his own father&#x27;s neglect. Shamed, Junius and Robbie are symbolically &quot;evicted from the Garden of Eden&quot;. In 1936, Steinbeck retitled the story &quot;Nothing So Monstrous&quot; and added an epilogue in which father and son resume their idyllic life in the Pastures.

===Chapter VII===
The adult daughters of Guiermo Lopez find themselves destitute after their father dies. They decide to open a small restaurant in their roadside house. Confidant of their culinary talents, they have high hopes of drawing a loyal clientele. Business languishes. When Maria returns to the restaurant after a day of shopping, she finds her older sister sullen and remote. Rosa confesses that she provided a sexual favor to a male customer simply for patronizing the establishment. The sisters weep and embrace. Maria, in solidarity with Rosa, declares that she too will likewise encourage the customers. The sisters together ask forgiveness from the Holy Virgin. Business improves among the male clientele. The cheerful sisters maintain the fiction that they operate a restaurant, not a bordello. Husbands keep mum, but the Lopez sisters are shunned by local wives. When Maria travels to town in her horse-drawn carriage, she encounters Allen Hueneker. Short, ugly and ape-like, he suffers from low self-esteem; his wife dominates and disparages him. Allen accepts Maria&#x27;s offer to take him to the bus stop. The pair are spotted by Mr. and Mrs. Bert Munroe. Bert jokingly reports the sighting to Mrs Hueneker. That evening Maria returns home to find Rosa in tears: the sheriff visited that afternoon and has shut down the restaurant, terming it a &quot;bad house&quot;. Sobbing, Rosa announces she will move to San Francisco and become &quot;a bad woman&quot;; Maria pledges to join her.

&quot;The Lopez Sisters&quot; lacks the &quot;central irony&quot; of the other stories in the cycle: the sisters have no expectation of harvesting the natural bounty of the Pastures. Bert Munroe&#x27;s gratuitous &quot;practical joke&quot; precipitates their departure, but does nothing to undermine their self-delusions as prostitutes. The &quot;light, humorous&quot; and Maupassant-like quality lacks the tragic dimensions of the other stories. Originally part of a play &quot;The Green Lady&quot;, Steinbeck intended to include the episode in &quot;To a God Unknown&quot; (1933), but revised it for &quot;Pastures&quot;. Critic Richard S. Hughes judges it &quot;one of the less successful pieces in the book&quot;.

===Chapter VIII===
Molly Morgan, just graduated from the teachers college, has arrived in the valley to interview for a position as a school teacher. Innocent and sensitive, Molly suffers from the effects of an impoverished childhood and the long absences of her much-beloved and alcoholic father, George Morgan. Molly&#x27;s mother died after a protracted illness, and her father&#x27;s whereabouts is now unknown. Molly considers herself an orphan. George Morgan&#x27;s short, intermittent visits to the household loom large in Molly&#x27;s perceptions of her father. She recalls him as a romantic figure, an adventurer, almost legendary in stature. He has not returned for years.The Pastures of Heaven school board welcomes Molly as the new teacher. She has a rewarding teaching career ahead of her. Molly&#x27;s vulnerability stems from her illusions regarding her father: she dreads abandoning her storybook illusions and admitting to herself his true character. When a member of the school board, Bert Munroe, begins publicly disparaging the drunken behavior of his recently hired ranch hand, Molly begins to panic: could this disreputable figure be her father? Declining to inquire as to the man&#x27;s identity, the mere possibility that he might be George Morgan induces Molly to resign and flee the valley to avoid abandoning her illusions.

The &quot;well-made&quot; plot offers a &quot;composite picture&quot; of Molly&#x27;s painful and lonely youth, revealing her neurotic worship of a delinquent and alcoholic father. Molly&#x27;s delusional, infantile fantasies concerning the absent George Morgan and terror at confronting the truth; more troubling because her flight from the Pastures indicates that &quot;she knew new her father&#x27;s real character&quot;. According to French, Bert Munroe&#x27;s role is especially pernicious: &quot;[H]is crude humor becomes a cruel weapon&quot; which leads to the departure &quot;of an innocent, sensitive girl who is an unqualified asset to the community that loves her&quot;.

===Chapter IX===
Raymond Banks owns and single-handedly operates the most admired farm in the valley. The farm is well-cultivated and his poultry operation clean and efficient. Community-minded and generous, he is particularly popular with the children, playing Santa Claus at the school Christmas parties. His only eccentricity, and a troubling one to many locals, is that he occasionally attends hangings at the San Quentin as a guest of the warden. Bert Munroe and his family have recently occupied the old Banks property in the valley. A newcomer, Bert is deeply troubled when he learns of Banks&#x27; excursions. Bert begs Banks to procure a pass to accompany him to an execution. Banks is hesitant, but makes arrangements for them. Bert abruptly refuses the invitation: Banks is perplexed. Rather than simply decline, Bert proceeds to justify his distaste for executions, disgorging a bizarre childhood memory of witnessing an inept butchering of a chicken by a neighbor. He adds that he knew of a hanging in which the victim was decapitated. When Banks attempts to reassure him, Bert becomes almost hysterical in predicting the horrifying effects the experience would have on him and ridiculing Banks for lacking a heathy imagination. Banks, indignant, has nothing but contempt for Bert&#x27;s outburst and departs. This personal attack has sickened him and he decides to cancel his trip to San Quentin.

The story is steeped in irony.
Though lacking in empathy, Banks is neither cruel nor morbid: his desire to observe hangings is a vicarious means of experiencing profound emotion through the reactions of others who also witness the execution. This is indicative of &quot;serious voids in his character&quot; that fall short of perversity.
Bert Munroe, in contrast, has a lurid curiosity in hangings, but lacks the courage to witness them. Rather than paying Banks, Bert has an ulterior motive: &quot;He quite deliberately sets out to destroy another man&#x27;s illusions in order to protect his own.&quot; Steinbeck finds Banks&#x27; limited grasp of the enormity of death benign compared to Munroe&#x27;s morbid fascination, which he conceals under his self-righteousness.

===Chapter X===
Pat Humbert, an only child, lives with his mother and father. Cruel taskmasters, they treat him more as a hired servant than a son. When Pat is thirty, they die. Finally free from parental tyranny, he seeks companionship in formal social activities: the school board, the Masons, and the Odd Fellows but forms no intimate friendships. Pat produces fine crops, accumulating sizable savings. He resides alone in the farmhouse, limiting his living area to the kitchen - the rest of the rooms fall into disrepair. A homely and ill-educated man, Pat at 40 appears to be a confirmed bachelor. An enormous white Banksia rose tree engulfs the farmhouse. Mrs. Munroe and her very pretty daughter, 20-year-old Mae, stroll by the property. Admiring the roses, Mae remarks that the farmhouse reminds her of a picture postcard of a lovely Vermont country home: perhaps Mr. Humbert will allow her to see the interior. Undetected by the women, Pat overhears her. An obsession takes hold of him, and he begins to vigorously remodel the interior of the house in the Vermont style. He orders custom made facsimiles of Vermont furniture. Pat has vivid fantasies of ushering Mae into the house and witnessing her delight. When Pat musters up enough courage to visit the Munroe home to invite Mae, he is informed by her father that she is engaged to a local boy, Bill Whiteside. Shattered by the news, Pat returns home and sleeps in the hay loft.

Literary critic Richard S. Hughes praises the story for its &quot;compact and tight organization…the narrative contains carefully-wrought imagery, reinforcing the mood of the various scenes&quot;. Pat Humbert, as one of the most vulnerable denizens of The Pasture of Heaven, finds his suffering compounded by contact with the Munroe family. His difficulty originates primarily from his own unhappy family history. Unable to forge an independent identity after the passing of his &quot;hateful&quot; parents, he remains a social outsider. His delusional fantasy that Mae Munroe might be his wife moves him to action: he vigorously dismantles the interior of the house that his domineering parents had occupied for decades, an act of liberation. When Mae is betrothed to another, Pat is doomed to revert to his former self, haunted by the ghosts of his mother and father.

===Chapter XI===
Richard Whiteside arrives in The Pastures of Heaven from New England after his father&#x27;s estate burns down; he is determined to revive the family fortunes by establishing a &quot;dynasty&quot; in the Pastures of Heaven that will endure for many generations. He builds a grand house and marries Alicia, both expecting to produce a large family. Richard sires but one child, John. John, in turn, marries Willa and, again, produces only a son, William. Though the farm proves highly profitable and the Whitesides are well-regarded in the community, Richard Whiteside&#x27;s dynastic vision never materializes. The handsome house is accidentally burned to the ground during a prescribed burn, and his grandson William marries a local woman, Mae Munroe, and they move to the city.

Literary critic Warren French notes the similarity of this &quot;tragic theme of the destruction of the dream of founding a dynasty&quot; with that of Faulkner&#x27;s Absalom, Absalom! (year)&quot;.
Richard S. Hughes identifies four symbols associated with the Whiteside mansion: the white paint that perpetually covers the house; the New England style slate roof; the sitting room with its bookshelf containing the works of Herodotus, Xenophon, and Thucidydes; and especially the Meerschaum pipe and its successive color transformations. In terms of the irony that Steinbeck&#x27;s inserts into every story, the fiery inferno that consumes the Whiteside house is entirely predictable: &quot;We are prepared for it from the very beginning of the tale.&quot; Hughes points out that, contrary to the other stories in the cycle, the Whiteside tragedy requires no meddling from the Munroe family.

===Chapter XII===
The chapter serves to bookend the collection: sightseers gaze longingly on the golden and fertile valley, each imagining the wonderful gifts it might hold for them. The reader is fully aware that the valley has been the site of &quot;misfortune and tragedy&quot; of which the tourists are utterly ignorant.

The epilogue balances the prologue, thus &quot;completing the ironic frame of the volume&quot;.

<doc id="1309574" wikidata="Q7567165" url="?curid=1309574" title="South Edmeston, New York">
<text>South Edmeston is a hamlet (and census-designated place) on the Unadilla River in the Town of Edmeston in Otsego County, New York, United States.

This area had been a center of dairy farming and cheese production since the nineteenth century. Kraft Foods had operated a cheese plant in South Edmeston starting in the year 1920. They originally produced Philadelphia brand cream cheese. Later they switched over to Breyers yogurt, and the plant employed about 55 workers.

In December 2004, Kraft announced that the plant would close on April 8, 2005. Following its closure, the plant was bought by the company Agro Farma under Turkish entrepreneur Hamdi Ulukaya. In 2007, it launched the Chobani brand of Greek yogurt. Thanks to the surge in popularity of Greek yogurt, as of 2011, the company employs 600 workers at its South Edmeston headquarters and production facility, and continues to expand.

<text>Frédéric Chopin&#x27;s Fantaisie-Impromptu () in C minor, Op. posth. 66, WN 46 is a solo piano composition. It was composed in 1834 and published posthumously in 1855 despite Chopin&#x27;s instruction that none of his unpublished manuscripts be published. The &quot;Fantaisie-Impromptu&quot; is one of Chopin&#x27;s most frequently performed and popular compositions.

==History==
The &quot;Fantaisie-Impromptu&quot; was written in 1834, as were the Four Mazurkas (Op. 17) and the Grande valse brillante in E major (Op. 18), but unlike these other works, Chopin never published the &quot;Fantaisie-Impromptu&quot;. Instead, Julian Fontana published it posthumously, along with other waltzes Opp. 69 and 70. It is unknown why Chopin did not release the &quot;Fantaisie-Impromptu&quot;. James Huneker called parts of it &quot;mawkish&quot; and &quot;without nobility&quot;. Ernst Oster conducted a technical examination of the piece which hints at similarities between the &quot;Fantaisie-Impromptu&quot; and Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Moonlight&quot; Sonata (&quot;Quasi una fantasia&quot;), which he cites as the reason for Chopin&#x27;s reluctance to publish the piece. It is also recognized that it resembles the Impromptu in E major, Op. 89 composed by Ignaz Moscheles and published in 1834, the same year Chopin composed his &quot;Fantaisie-Impromptu.&quot;

The mystery may have been solved in 1960 when pianist Arthur Rubinstein acquired the &quot;Album of the Baroness d&#x27;Este&quot; which had been sold at auction in Paris. The album contained a manuscript of the &quot;Fantaisie-Impromptu&quot; in Chopin&#x27;s own hand, dated 1835, stating on the title page in French &quot;Composed for the Baroness d&#x27;Este by Frédéric Chopin&quot;. The facts of its authenticity having been &quot;guaranteed by the French authorities&quot; and that it shows &quot;a delicate care for detail&quot; and &quot;many improvements in harmony and style&quot; in comparison to the previously published version, Rubinstein considered absolute proof that it is the finished work. In his preface to the &quot;Rubinstein Edition&quot;, published by G. Schirmer, Inc. in 1962, Rubinstein surmises that the words &quot;Composed for&quot; in place of a dedication imply that Chopin received a paid commission for the work, so he had actually sold it to the Baroness.

==Form==

Ernst Oster observes that the &quot;Fantaisie-Impromptu&quot; draws many of its harmonic and tonal elements from Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Moonlight Sonata&quot;, which is also in C minor, and from the third movement in particular. Two measures after the melody sets in, an abrupt run features the same notes, only one octave higher, like the cadenza in the sonata&#x27;s third movement (Presto agitato). The climax on a  chord is similar in both pieces. Additionally, the &quot;Fantaisie-Impromptu&quot;″s middle part and the second movement of the &quot;Moonlight Sonata&quot; are in D major. The first and third movements are in C minor.

For those and other reasons, Ernst Oster writes, &quot;Chopin understood Beethoven to a degree that no one who has written on the C minor Sonata or the &quot;Fantaisie-Impromptu&quot; has ever understood him. ... The &quot;Fantaisie-Impromptu&quot; is perhaps the only instance where one genius discloses to us—if only by means of a composition of his own—what he actually hears in the work of another genius.&quot;

The piece uses many cross-rhythms (the right hand plays sixteenth notes against the left hand playing triplets) and a ceaselessly moving note figuration, and is in cut time (). The opening tempo is marked &quot;allegro agitato&quot;. The tempo changes to &quot;largo&quot; and later &quot;moderato cantabile&quot; when the key changes to D major, the enharmonic equivalent of the more obscure tonic major key of C major, that is, the parallel major of C minor.

The piece then changes to &quot;presto&quot; (although some versions of the score incorporate a coda, meaning that the original tempo of &quot;allegro agitato&quot; is repeated) where it continues in C minor as before. It concludes in an ambiguous fantasy-like ending, in a quiet and mysterious way, where the left hand replays the first few notes of the moderato section theme, while the right hand continues playing sixteenth notes (semiquavers). The piece resolves and gently ends on a C major rolled chord (a Picardy third).

==Legacy==

The melody of the &quot;Fantaisie-Impromptu&quot;″s middle section was used in the popular Vaudeville song &quot;I&#x27;m Always Chasing Rainbows&quot;. That theme was quoted in Variation 10 of Federico Mompou&#x27;s &quot;Variations on a Theme of Chopin&quot;, which is otherwise based on Chopin&#x27;s Prelude No. 7 in A major. George Crumb&#x27;s &quot;Makrokosmos&quot;, Volume 1: 11. Dream Images (Love-Death Music) (Gemini) includes three quotations from the &quot;Fantaisie-Impromptu&quot;″s middle section.

<doc id="1309613" wikidata="Q1558616" url="?curid=1309613" title="Wren Day">
<text>Wren Day (), or Hunt the Wren Day (), is an Irish and Manx custom on 26 December, Saint Stephen&#x27;s Day (known in most of Ulster as Boxing Day). Traditionally, men and boys hunted a wren, which was revered as the &#x27;king of the birds&#x27;. They displayed it on top of a staff decorated with holly, ivy and ribbons, or in a decorated box on top of a pole. This was paraded around the neighbourhood by a group of &#x27;Wrenboys&#x27;—typically dressed in straw masks, greenery and colourful motley clothing—who sang songs and played music in exchange for donations. This was meant to ensure prosperity for the coming year. Afterwards, the wren was buried. On the Isle of Man, they held a funeral for the wren and danced around a &#x27;wren pole&#x27;. 

There were similar New Year traditions in parts of western Britain and France until the nineteenth century. There are several folk tales about the origin of the wren hunt. It is speculated that the tradition derives from ancient Celtic paganism and was originally a sacrifice associated with the winter solstice. In most places, Wren Day gradually died out following industrialisation, but it has been undergoing a revival since the late 20th century. Today, the wren is no longer hunted, and a mock or stuffed wren is used instead. It is especially popular on the Isle of Man and in Kerry.

==Irish tradition==
Historically, and up until the mid-20th century in many parts of rural Ireland, groups of men and boys hunted a wren (also pronounced &quot;wran&quot;) on St. Stephen&#x27;s Day. They beat the bushes and hedges with sticks, and when a wren flew out they tried to down the bird by throwing sticks, stones and other objects at it. Whoever killed the wren was believed to have good luck for a year.

The dead wren was usually placed inside a &#x27;wren bush&#x27;, which was usually a ball of holly, ivy and colourful ribbons fastened to the top of a long staff. Sometimes the &#x27;wren bush&#x27; was a wheel-shaped or ball-shaped frame of evergreen wreaths and ribbons. A group of &#x27;Wrenboys&#x27; or &#x27;Droluns&#x27; () then carried it in procession around the neighbourhood. In some areas they wore straw masks and costumes, while in others they wore masks made from the skin of a goat, a rabbit or a horse. In Kerry, they were accompanied by a hobby horse called the &quot;Láir Bhán&quot;. They sang songs about the wren, to the sound of drums, fifes and melodeons. The Wrenboys visited each house in the community—except those which had recently been affected by a death—collecting money, food or drink. This was meant to ensure prosperity for each household in the coming year. At the end of the day, the wren was buried, and sometimes given human burial rites by being placed in a tiny coffin and keened. The money, food and drink was used for a &#x27;wren dance&#x27;, sometimes called the &#x27;wren&#x27;s wake&#x27;, which was meant to bring unmarried people together.

Today, the wren hunt no longer takes place, but Wren Day has survived or been revived in a few towns and villages, mainly in the southern parts of Ireland, such as in Dingle in County Kerry. Groups of Wrenboys hold small parades and carry around a stuffed or fake wren. They usually collect money for charity or to host a dance or &quot;Wren Ball&quot; for the town.

=== Song ===

Whilst going from house to house, the Wrenboys would sing a song, of which there are many variations, asking for donations. One variation sung in Edmondstown, County Dublin, ran as such (the last two lines of which are used in several festive British begging songs and rhymes including &quot;Christmas is Coming&quot;):
 In a 1978 recording, the sean-nós singer Seosamh Ó hÉanaí discusses Wren Day activities and the lore behind the tradition. He sings a macaronic, English-Irish text: &quot;Dreoilín, dreoilín, Rí na nÉan (Wren, wren, King of Birds)&quot;.

==Manx tradition==
Traditionally, a wren was hunted on the Isle of Man every St Stephen&#x27;s Day, as in Ireland. Usually, the wren&#x27;s body would be hung inside the &#x27;wren bush&#x27; – a ball-shaped frame made from two crossed wreaths of holly or ivy, decorated with ribbons. In some villages, the wren&#x27;s body was displayed in a &#x27;wren house&#x27; – a small wooden box with windows, decorated with greenery and ribbons. These wren bushes or wren houses were held aloft on poles and taken around the neighbourhood by &#x27;wrenboys&#x27;, some of whom were decked in greenery or flew coloured banners. Singing &quot;Hunt the Wren&quot; () and beating drums, they went from house to house asking for coins. When a coin was given, the donor might receive a feather from the wren. These feathers were kept or worn as an amulet to guard against supernatural harm and witchcraft.

At the end of the day, a funeral was held for the wren and it was buried at the parish church by torchlight. George Waldron recorded in 1731 that they buried the wren &quot;with a whimsical kind of solemnity, singing dirges over her in the Manx language&quot;. According to folklorist Mona Douglas, after the dead wren was buried, a living wren was placed in a wicker cage inside the wren bush, and the people danced around it. When the dance ended, the wren was set free, and the bush was burned on the dead wren&#x27;s grave. Manx folklore held that the wren&#x27;s spirit would be reborn each year. 

According to Douglas, in the eighteenth century the Manx church were hostile to the ceremony, but knew they could not prevent it. She wrote that when the group arrived at the church with the sacrificed wren, the vicar &quot;took good care to absent himself from the proceedings, for they were frowned upon by the church at that time as being Pagan and superstitious&quot;.

The tradition was revived on the Isle of Man during the 1990s, although a wren is no longer killed. Today, it mainly involves music, singing and dancing around a decorated wren bush or wren pole in which a stuffed or fake wren is placed.

==Origin==

In regions where Wren Day was traditional, the wren was deeply revered; it was deemed a special bird, the &quot;king of all birds&quot;, and harming it was taboo. However, on Wren Day this taboo was &quot;replaced by highly complex rituals that grew out of ancient beliefs&quot;. The ninth century &quot;Cormac&#x27;s Glossary&quot; derives the Old Irish word for &quot;wren&quot;, &quot;drean&quot;, from &quot;druí-én&quot;, meaning &quot;druid bird&quot;, and says it is &quot;a bird that makes prophecies&quot;. Another early Irish text, the &quot;Life of Saint Moling&quot;, calls the wren &quot;the magus bird, because some take auguries from it&quot;.

The origin of wren day and the wren hunt is obscure. According to Elizabeth Atwood Lawrence, &quot;evidence suggests an origin in the far distant past&quot;. Many scholars believe that the wren hunt has ancient pagan origins and is related to animal sacrifice and the winter solstice. Edward Allworthy Armstrong says &quot;there is much to suggest that the Wren Hunt was sacrificial. The bird was reverenced but killed at one season only, the feathers were regarded as talismans, the body was sometimes buried with respect, the chief human actor was regarded as in some sense a king, and the bird itself was given a royal title&quot;. Folklorist Christina Hole speculates that it may have derived from the periodic sacrifice of a sacred king. In Celtic tradition, the king&#x27;s rule was linked to the health and prosperity of the land. According to Lawrence, the belief may have been that at midwinter, &quot;the faltering forces of nature&quot; had to be renewed, by ritually killing the wren who represented the old king and the old year. Similarly, folklorist Sylvie Muller sees the wren as a stand-in for man, and sees the wren hunt as representing a sacrifice to ensure the bountifulness of nature. According to Muller, this comes from the pre-farming belief that mankind owes a life debt to nature in return for the life that we take from it. 

===Folk tales===
There are several folk tales about the origin of the wren hunt. Armstrong wrote that the &quot;multiplicity and inconsistency&quot; of the stories &quot;show that we are dealing with a very ancient ceremonial, the origin of which has been forgotten&quot;. Christina Hole described the stories as &quot;mere rationalizations of a ritual that appears to be older than Christianity&quot;.

Some stories say that it is hunted on St Stephen&#x27;s Day because a wren wakened the guards when Saint Stephen tried to escape from captivity. Another says that the saint had a pet wren that was stoned to death along with him. Yet another rationalizes it as a memorial of the Massacre of the Innocents.

There is a widespread folk tale about how the wren (or gold-crested wren) outwitted the eagle to become &#x27;king of the birds&#x27;. This story has been recorded since ancient times and is found all over Europe. In some Irish versions, the wren must pay for having gained this royal title, or is put under a &quot;geis&quot; (a mystical taboo) that it must not fly higher than the top of a bush. This is explained as the reason the wren is hunted once a year. In Irish mythology, kings are likewise often put under a &quot;geis&quot;, and they mystically die or are killed when they break their &quot;geis&quot;. 

Possibly the earliest written reference to a wren hunt is a medieval Irish legend about Saint Moling. It says that the saint cursed the wren to be hunted by young people because it ate his pet fly. Other legends say that Irish people hunt the wren once a year because it alerted their enemies as the Irish were about to ambush them; these enemies are variously said to be the Vikings, Cromwell&#x27;s army, or the Williamite army.

In Manx folklore, the origin of the wren hunt is linked with a beautiful fairy woman. The story goes that the woman enchanted all the men of the island to follow her in hope of marrying her, and they neglected their homes and fields. The fairy woman lured the men into the sea where they drowned. One day a hero found a way of averting her charms. But before she could be defeated, she shapeshifted into a wren and flew away. However, she was cursed to re-appear once a year as a wren, and this is why the wren is hunted on this day.

In Welsh mythology, the hero Lleu Llaw Gyffes (Lleu of the Skilful Hand) gains his byname by striking a wren with perfect aim, &quot;between the sinew and the bone&quot;.

==Parallel traditions==
The typical wren hunt occurred in Ireland, the Isle of Man, Wales, England and France, &quot;areas where Celtic tradition was firmly entrenched&quot;. Although there was some regional variation, the basic pattern of the ritual was the same wherever it occurred. In Britain and Ireland, the wren hunt was usually held on St. Stephen&#x27;s Day, but wren hunts also took place on Christmas Eve, New Year&#x27;s Eve, New Year&#x27;s Day, and Twelfth Day (5 January). By the early 20th century, industrialization and changing beliefs had begun to erode the tradition.

The Wrenboys have some similarities with the &quot;skeklers&quot; of Shetland.

=== Wales ===
In Wales, the tradition of &#x27;hunting the wren&#x27; () took place every Twelfth Day, and the practice continued in Pembrokeshire until the beginning of the twentieth century. Like in some Manx traditions, in Wales the dead wren was typically placed in a &quot;Wren House&quot; – a small wooden box with windows, decorated with greenery and ribbons – which was then carried around the neighbourhood by &quot;wren bearers&quot;. In some cases, &quot;wrenboys&quot; caught a live wren and placed it in the Wren House, and then the wrenboys called on people to make offerings to the little &quot;king&quot; until the end of the day, when the bird was set free.

=== England ===
The tradition was found in parts of England, but it gradually died out or was put down by the authorities by the mid-nineteenth century. In the late 20th century, Pete Jennings and the &quot;Old Glory Molly Dancers&quot; revived the wren hunt in Suffolk, and it has been performed in Middleton on the evening of every Boxing Day since 1994.

===France===
There are similar mid-winter wren ceremonies in parts of France. James George Frazer describes in &quot;The Golden Bough&quot; a wren-hunting ritual in Carcassonne, held in early December. The &quot;Fête du Roi de l&#x27;Oiseau&quot; (festival of the king of birds) was first recorded in 1524 at Puy-en-Velay, and is still celebrated. In parts of France, whomever was first to strike, catch or kill the wren was honoured with the title of King. He led a torchlit procession around the town, carrying the wren on a pole. They stopped at each house, and wrote &quot;vive le roi!&quot; (long live the king) on each door.

The Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés has a document from 1663 in which the prior undertakes to give thirty pots of wine each year to the &quot;bacheliers&quot;, if they bring him a living wren as tribute at Christmas or New Year. A captured wren was also given as tribute to the priory of Châteauponsac each New Year&#x27;s Day. The man who caught the wren became &quot;King of the Fête&quot; and the wren was paraded to the church accompanied by fife and drum.

===Galicia===
In Galicia, Spain, the &quot;Caceria do rei Charlo&quot; (Chase of King Charles) was performed around midwinter. The inhabitants of Vilanova de Lourenzá would chase down a wren and, after tying it to a pole, would parade it and show it to the abbot of the local monastery, who would then offer them food and drink and appoint two leaders of the local town council out of the four candidates proposed by townsmen. This tradition has been recorded since the 16th century. It is unclear which specific date this tradition was performed on; sources call it &quot;New Year&#x27;s Day&quot;, which may not refer to the New Year on the Gregorian calendar but instead to the day after Christmas, which at that time was considered the end of the year.

== Popular songs ==
In 1955 Liam Clancy recorded &quot;The Wran Song&quot; (&quot;The Wren Song&quot;), which was sung in Ireland by wrenboys. In 1972 Steeleye Span recorded &quot;The King&quot; on &quot;Please to See the King&quot;, which also reflects the tradition; on their album &quot;Time&quot; they made another version, &quot;The Cutty Wren&quot;, named after the traditional English folk song. &quot;Hunting the Wren&quot; appears on John Kirkpatrick&#x27;s album &quot;Wassail!&quot;. The Chieftains made a collection of wrenboy tunes on &quot;The Bells of Dublin&quot;. In the song &quot;The Boys of Barr na Sráide&quot;, which is based on a poem by Sigerson Clifford, the wren hunt is also a prominent theme. Lankum&#x27;s 2019 album &quot;The Livelong Day&quot; includes a track called &quot;Hunting the Wren&quot; that references several of the legends and practices connected with Wren Day.

&quot;The Wren [Wran] Song&quot; is also on the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem&#x27;s 1995 album &quot;Ain&#x27;t It Grand Boys: A Collection of Unissued Gems&quot;, as the last song in &quot;Children&#x27;s Medley&quot;.

<text>Woolston is an industrial and residential suburb of Christchurch in the South Island of New Zealand. It is situated southeast of the city centre, close to major arterial routes including State Highways 74 and 76 to Banks Peninsula. The Heathcote River flows through the suburb.

Woolston became a district in 1882, and remained a self-governing borough until November 1921, when it was amalgamated with Christchurch. Over the 20th century the area grew to become the centre of the New Zealand rubber industry. Woolston&#x27;s population predominantly consists of European New Zealanders.

==History==

In pre-European times the Woolston was not clearly identified. The mudflats at Ferrymead at the eastern end of modern Woolston was considered an important food gathering place by the local Ngāi Tahu iwi. The Māori name for the mudflats was &quot;Ohika paruparu&quot;. Māori women gathered shellfish there. This is the only name known to have been used to describe the area prior to European settlement.

Early European records name the western area of Woolston as Roimata, meaning teardrop in Māori. To this day some land titles in this area reference Roimata as their location. More recently the name has been revived by the Roimata Community Incorporated Society (Roimata Community Inc.) and Christ Church Roimata (an independent Anglican church), which are geographically and community-based organisations actively working in Roimata. Its boundaries are defined as Ensors Road, Brougham Street, Ferry Road and Richardson Terrace.
One of the first signs of a growing European community in the Woolston area was the establishment of a Christian church, the Anglican Parish of St John the Evangelist Woolston, which belongs to the Christchurch diocese. The origins of the Parish date back to 1857 when the first Cob Church was built on the current site. In 1882 a new timber church was built. In 1960 the existing concrete Church building was built and dedicated (consecrated 1963). These church buildings are used daily for worship and many other religious and community activities. It is open to the public on Sundays. It is situated on Ferry Road at the eastern end of Woolston Village. The Parish was officially recognised one year after Christchurch was officially recognised as a City in 1856, the same year that the Anglican Diocese of Christchurch was established. St Johns is one of the oldest Anglican parishes in New Zealand.

Woolston initially belonged to the Heathcote County Council. In the 1850s and 1860s, wharves along the Ōpāwaho / Heathcote River were used by small ships to service the area. Before the Lyttelton Rail Tunnel was opened in 1867, all the incoming trade arrived in Ferrymead and was transported through Woolston (along Ferry Road) into Christchurch. The road went from the wharf in Lower Heathcote to what is now the corner of High and Madras Streets. The area became quite industrialised after the tunnel opened. Ferry Road later carried the tramlines to Sumner.
Up until early 1870 the area was commonly referred to as Lower Heathcote. At a meeting about the Heathcote Road drain a local store owner, Joseph Harry Hopkins (1837–1910), named the area Woolston after his birthplace Woolston in Southampton, England. On 16 June 1870, in response to a petition to the postmaster-general, Julius Vogel, objecting to the post office being called Ferry Road, the name Woolston was gazetted. Woolston became a district in 1882, and remained a self-governing borough until November 1921, when it was amalgamated with Christchurch.

Evangelical leader William Orange was born at Woolston in 1889.

===Woolston Cut===

The Ōpāwaho / Heathcote River provided Woolston much needed water for industries like wool scouring, which needed plentiful water. In 1966 the Woolston industrial sewer was built, and up until that time the river had become increasingly polluted.

Flooding had also become a problem and in 1986 the Woolston Cut began to allow flood waters to bypass a long loop of the river. This resulted in effluent from the surrounding government settlements to pollute this stretch of river. The long project, which cost NZ$2m, had as a consequence that the trees on the riverbank died as far upstream as the Opawa bridge, and that banks collapsed. During normal flow regimes, the Heathcote remains to flow through what is called the Woolston Loop.

==Today==
In later years Woolston&#x27;s close proximity to the Lyttelton rail line continued to sustain Woolston as a prime location for industry. Over the 20th century the area grew to become the centre of the New Zealand rubber industry. Other industries grew here and included a nugget factory and a gelatine and glue works. Many of these businesses are still present in one form or another. Woolston hosts Christchurch&#x27;s largest container terminal.

Residential growth from the city gradually moved out through the Woolston area and it is now well merged with Christchurch City. Te Ara, the online Encyclopedia of New Zealand, states that &quot;Factory workers living nearby gave Woolston a strong working-class identity.&quot;

Woolston is home to The Woolston Drivebys, an indoor football team. The Woolston Brass Band, established in 1891, has gained a national reputation and has won many competitions.

===Heritage buildings===
Prior to the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake, the following heritage buildings were listed with the New Zealand Historic Places Trust:

<text>The EMD DDA40X is a 6,600 hp (4,943 kW) D-D locomotive, built by EMD from 1969 to 1971 exclusively for the Union Pacific Railroad. It is the most powerful diesel–electric locomotive model ever built on a single frame, having two 16-645E3A diesel prime movers. Union Pacific has marked DD40X on the cab exteriors, while EMD literature inconsistently refers to this model as either DD-40X or DDA40X.

UP&#x27;s DDA40X locomotives were the culmination of the company&#x27;s experiments with extremely powerful locomotives that began with its gas turbine–electric locomotives and DD35s. For manufacturer EMD, the construction of the world&#x27;s most powerful single frame locomotive was a sign of the company&#x27;s dominance of the North American diesel locomotive market, with only GE Transportation an equal competitor. The DDA40X also pioneered a number of new technologies that would go on to be incorporated in future EMD designs.

Ultimately, UP did not continue with exceptionally powerful locomotives like the DDA40X built on single frames, instead moving toward distributed power using smaller locomotives closer to 4,000 hp. All DDA40X locomotives were retired between 1984 and 1986; several of them survive. Union Pacific 6936 operated as a member of the Union Pacific Heritage Fleet until 2022, when it was announced it would be donated to the Railroading Heritage of Midwest America museum.

==History==

In 1969, Union Pacific was retiring the last of their gas turbine–electric locomotives. Beginning in 1963, Union Pacific had ordered EMD DD35s and DD35As to replace the turbines, and the DDA40X was a further development from this design.

The first DDA40X, UP 6900, was delivered in April 1969, in time to participate in the celebrations of the centennial anniversary of the completion of the first transcontinental railroad driving the &quot;Gold Spike Limited&quot;; it arrived in Salt Lake City, Utah, on the morning of May 10, 1969. In honor of this, the class was nicknamed Centennials and the choice of locomotive numbers in the 6900s was made for the same reason. Forty-six more were built between June 1969 and September 1971, numbered from 6901 to 6946.

The DDA40X is long. The frames were fabricated by the John Mohr Company of Chicago, because they were too large for EMD&#x27;s factory. The use of more than one prime mover in a single locomotive was not new; the E-series were popular dual-engine locomotives, and Baldwin had produced (but not sold) a locomotive with four diesel engines.

The &quot;X&quot; in the model number stood for &quot;experimental&quot;, as DDA40X Centennials were testbeds for technology that would go into future EMD products. UP frequently used these locomotives to haul heavy freights. Each unit successfully ran about before they were retired from revenue service in 1985. The modular electronic control systems later used in EMD Dash-2 models were first used on the DDA40X and the 4,200 hp SD45X. All DDA40X units included a new load test circuit, whose dynamic braking resistors allowed units to load test without a track-side load test box. Gearing was 59:18, allowing on freight trains.

The DDA40X has a wide nose akin to those on the F45 and FP45 cowl units. These cabs were superficially similar to the Canadian comfort cab introduced by Canadian National in 1973, though without the structural reinforcements of the Canadian design.

Other experiments were conducted during the service life of these locomotives. A few of the units were fitted with Federal Signal Thunderbolt air raid sirens to warn track-side personnel when away from grade crossings, but the results were inconclusive. Another test included the modular electrical components, which was successful. This made for easier diagnosis of electrical problems. These modifications were used in all future locomotives built by EMD.

Despite their excellent performance and relatively good efficiency, these units were costly to maintain, which ultimately prompted Union Pacific to begin placing them into storage in the early 1980s. But in early 1984, as rail traffic rebounded, Union Pacific brought 25 units out of storage and rebuilt them to return to service. All locomotives were finally retired by 1986. Twelve DDA40X units are preserved by various museums, while another unit survives as a source of spare parts for other locomotives. UP 6936, the sole operating unit, was owned by Union Pacific and was used in excursion service until 2016. In 2022, this locomotive was donated by Union Pacific to the Railroading Heritage of Midwest America, which returned the locomotive to operation. 6936 was operated by the museum for the first time in August 2023.

==Surviving examples==

Thirteen DDA40Xs survive today. The following list details the surviving locomotives and their current owners.
* 6900Kenefick Park, Omaha, Nebraska. The first DDA40X built, it was moved to its current location on April 15, 2005.
* 6901Ross Park, Pocatello, Idaho.
* 6911Mexico Museum of Technology, Mexico City.
* 6913Museum of the American Railroad, Frisco, Texas.
* 6915RailGiants Train Museum, Fairplex, Pomona, California.
* 6916Utah State Railroad Museum, Ogden, Utah.
* 6922Cody Park, North Platte, Nebraska.
* 6925Stored at Dakota Southern Railway’s rail yard located in Chamberlain, South Dakota, having been used as a parts source and for fuel storage. It was owned by the Nebraska Railroad Museum, until October 2022, when it was sold to a private owner in Kansas City.
* 6930Illinois Railway Museum, Union, Illinois. Originally donated to Smoky Hill Railway &amp; Historical Society (Kansas City area); traded and moved to the IRM in 1991.
* 6936Railroading Heritage of Midwest America, Silvis, Illinois. Previously operated as part of the UP Heritage Fleet until 2016. Operational.
* 6938North Little Rock, Arkansas. Sits in front of Jenks Locomotive Facility.
* 6944National Museum of Transportation, St. Louis, Missouri. No. 6944 was sent to Altoona, Pennsylvania in July, 2014 for cosmetic restoration, which was completed in May, 2015. The locomotive returned to St. Louis in June, 2015.
* 6946Western Pacific Railroad Museum, Portola, California. The last DDA40X built, it is fairly complete and on static display.

== In popular culture ==
One preserved DDA40X, No. 6915, was featured as a model train in the 1995 music video &quot;Big Train&quot;, which featured Mike Watt and was directed by Spike Jonze, and it was part of Watt&#x27;s 1995 studio album &quot;Ball-Hog or Tugboat?&quot;. In the video, No. 6915 was driven by Mike Watt as a drunk engineer, who threw bombs off of the locomotive and used it to run over pedestrians. Union Pacific was agitated by the use of No. 6915 in the video, since an estimated 529 trespassers had been run over and killed by American trains throughout the previous year. In April 1995, the railroad successfully sued the video&#x27;s producers, MTV, Sony Music, and Satellite Films, for copyright infringement.

<text>Arthur Sackville Labatt, (born May 11, 1934) is a Canadian businessman and the great-grandson of John K. Labatt, founder of the Labatt brewery. From 2004 to 2008, he was the chancellor of the University of Western Ontario (UWO) in London, Ontario, Canada.

==Life and career==
Born in London, Ontario, to John Sackville Labatt and Elizabeth Anne Lynch, Labatt studied business at UWO for one year in 1953, and he also briefly studied at McGill University, where he joined the Kappa Alpha Society. However, he never graduated from either university.

He was expected to take over the Labatt brewery, but by the time he was an adult, the business had been sold outside of the family. Instead, he became an accountant with Clarkson Gordon and later worked in the securities industry and investment management. He founded Trimark Investment Management, a mutual fund company, in 1981.

Labatt became an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1996. He succeeded Eleanor Clitheroe as chancellor of UWO on October 28, 2004, and he served until 2008.

On February 7, 2007, the Labatt family donated $30 million to Toronto&#x27;s Hospital for Sick Children—the largest donation in the hospital&#x27;s history—in order to establish the Labatt Family Heart Centre (which will provide care for children with congenital heart disease), and to support the Brain Tumour Research Centre, which the Labatt family helped establish with a previous donation.

<text>Government Plaza station is a Metro light rail station on the Blue Line and Green Line in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The station is located on 5th Street South, between 3rd and 4th Avenues South in downtown Minneapolis. This station opened on June 26, 2004, with initial light rail service in the Twin Cities.

== History and design ==
In 1905, Twin Cities Rapid Transit (TCRT) streetcars began running on new track down 5th Street from Hennepin Avenue to 4th Avenue in order to relieve congestion on the High Street Loop. In 1920, TCRT&#x27;s flagship &quot;Interurban&quot; between Downtown Minneapolis and Downtown Saint Paul, streetcar predecessor to the Green Line, was rerouted down 5th Street from Washington Avenue via 5th Avenue. Streetcars continued this routing through downtown and were converted to buses on November 28, 1953.

Fifth Avenue was converted to westward one-way traffic in the mid-1960s in conjunction with the construction of Interstate 94 and Interstate 35W. The westbound stop remained for Routes 16, a bus predecessor to the Green Line and replacement of the &quot;Interubran&quot;. Soon after the Metropolitan Transit Commission assumed TCRT&#x27;s operations in 1970, the corridor would remain critical for westbound service from Saint Paul. In 1976 express bus service between downtowns was inaugurated along Interstate 94. In June 1998 limited-stop Route 50 began operating, supplementing Route 16 during rush hours. In order to compensate for the loss of westbound bus traffic on 5th Street at the beginning of light rail construction, a contraflow bus lane was placed one block north on 4th Street South. Construction of the downtown stations began summer 2002. Service began at this station when the first phase of the Hiawatha Line, now the Blue Line, opened on June 26, 2004. Additional light rail service commenced June 14, 2014, with opening of the Green Line to Saint Paul.

The station was designed by Barbour LaDouceur Architects, with Seitu Jones serving as architectural design team artist. In response to historic preservation concerns wanting to retain sightlines of Minneapolis City Hall from the adjacent street and plaza, particularly the Richardsonian Romanesque facade and arched entrance, the shelters at this station are spaced widely apart at each end of the long platforms. Surrounding architecture influenced the station&#x27;s design. For shelters, stone bases match that of City Hall&#x27;s red granite and the canopies&#x27; exposed truss beam design was inspired by the nearby Milwaukee Road Depot train shed. Semicircular enclosures are oriented towards the direction of travel. Platform brickwork is continuous with the adjoining plaza.

Side platforms extend into the sidewalk, closing off 5th Street to vehicle traffic. This is the only segment of the light rail along 5th Street with no vehicle traffic adjacent to the tracks. Government Plaza was the only downtown station that could not accommodate 3-car long trains, only being built for a maximum of 2-cars. The platform was lengthened from to the weekend of June 26, 2009.

The Green Line Night Bus and rail replacement buses serve regular bus stops at 5th Street, the westbound stop is adjacent on 4th Avenue with the eastbound stop one block away on 5th Avenue.

== Public art ==

The public art installation, &quot;Local Connections: Minneapolis Views and Visions of Democracy&quot;, by Keith Christensen, features two granite columns roughly demarcating the boundary between the southbound platform and the plaza. The artwork also consists of eight printed images, two in each shelter, on two-sided panels of enameled glass. Images are either of different work gloves, solicited from community residents and workers, or aerial photography, historic and contemporary, of Minneapolis neighborhoods. The gloves allude to diverse population and democracy in work. Aerials contextualize how local activities fit into a larger scale. Phrases accompanying the columns and images pertain to community and civic engagement, and are translated into five languages common to Minneapolis: English, Spanish, Somali, Hmong, and Ojibwe.

&quot;Small Kindness, Weather Permitting&quot;, by Janet Zweig, has four interactive boxes at the station: &quot;All the way around!#17&quot;, &quot;Ring the bell and see.#18&quot;, &quot;Go ahead and let it snow.#23&quot;, and &quot;Open the curtains please.#27&quot;.

== Notable places nearby ==
The station is surrounded by a high concentration of government buildings, suggestive of its name: Minneapolis City Hall, Hennepin County Government Center, Minneapolis Federal Courthouse, Hennepin County Public Safety Facility, and, most recently, Minneapolis Public Service Building. Directly adjoining the southbound platform is The People&#x27;s Plaza. The Minneapolis Skyway System can be accessed from City Hall or Government Center, and a rare underground portion of the system runs beneath the station.

Landmarks nearby include CenturyLink Building, U.S. Bank Plaza, and Capella Tower.

Two and three blocks away are connections to the C Line and D Line at 7th–8th Street &amp; 3rd/4th Avenue.

<doc id="1309662" wikidata="Q343336" url="?curid=1309662" title="Earle Wheeler">
<text>Earle Gilmore Wheeler (13 January 1908 – 18 December 1975), nicknamed Bus, was a United States Army general who served as the chief of Staff of the United States Army from 1962 to 1964 and then as the sixth chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (1964–1970), holding the latter position during the Vietnam War.

==Early life and education==
Earle Gilmore Wheeler was born in Washington, D.C., on 13 January 1908, to Dock Stone and Ida Gilmore. He was later adopted by Ida&#x27;s second husband. Wheeler began his military career in 1924, at the age of 16, as a private in Company E, 121st Engineers, District of Columbia National Guard. He was promoted to sergeant in 1926, then, in 1928, was honorably discharged in order to enroll at the United States Military Academy. He graduated from the Academy in 1932 and was commissioned into the infantry. After graduation he married Frances &quot;Betty&quot; Rogers Howell, whom he met at a society party in 1930. He served in the 29th Infantry Regiment from 1932 to 1936, then attended Infantry School in 1937. He served with the 15th Infantry Regiment, from 1937 to 1940, stationed in China from 1937 to 1938.

==Career==
From 1940 to 1941, Wheeler was a mathematics instructor at West Point. Rising from battalion commander to more senior roles, he trained the newly activated 36th and 99th Infantry Divisions from 1941 to 1944, then went to Europe in November 1944 as chief of staff of the newly formed 63rd Infantry Division.

Wheeler served in senior staff positions in a variety of specialties, including supply, intelligence, planning, and armor.

In late 1945, Wheeler returned to the U.S. as an artillery instructor at Fort Sill, then returned to Germany from 1947 to 1949 as a staff officer of the United States Constabulary (formerly VI Corps), occupying Germany. He attended the National War College in 1950. He then returned to Europe as a staff officer in NATO, in a series of roles. In 1951–52 he commanded the 351st Infantry Regiment, which controlled the Free Territory of Trieste, a front-line position of the Cold War.

In 1955, Wheeler joined the General Staff at The Pentagon. In 1958 he took command of the 2nd Armored Division. In 1959, he took command of III Corps. He became Director of the Joint Staff in 1960. In 1962 he was briefly Deputy Commander of U.S. Forces in Europe before being named Chief of Staff of the United States Army later that year.

===Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff===

President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Wheeler Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in July 1964 to succeed General Maxwell Taylor. Wheeler&#x27;s tenure as the nation&#x27;s top military officer spanned the height of America&#x27;s involvement in the Vietnam War.

Wheeler&#x27;s accession to the top job in the U.S. military, over the heads of officers with more combat experience, drew some criticism. Then Air Force Chief of Staff, General Curtis LeMay, called him &quot;Polly Parrot&quot; and said he was awarded a medal for &quot;fighting the Battle of Fort Benning&quot;, an army post in Georgia where Wheeler served during much of World War II.

Wheeler oversaw and supported the expanding U.S. military role in the Vietnam War in the mid-1960s, consistently backing the field commander&#x27;s requests for additional troops and operating authority. He often urged President Johnson to strike harder at North Vietnam and to expand aerial bombing campaigns. Wheeler was concerned with minimizing costs to U.S. ground troops. At the same time, he preferred what he saw as a realistic assessment of the capabilities of the South Vietnamese military. This earned him a reputation as a &quot;hawk.&quot;

Wheeler, with General William C. Westmoreland, the field commander, and President Johnson, pushed to raise additional American forces after the February 1968 Tet Offensive. American media at the time widely reported the Tet Offensive as Viet Cong victory. This followed a widely noted news report in 1967 that cited an unnamed American general (later identified as General Frederick C. Weyand) who called the situation in Vietnam a &quot;stalemate.&quot; It was a view with which Wheeler agreed in more confidential circles. However, Wheeler was concerned that the American buildup in Vietnam depleted U.S. military capabilities in other parts of the world. He called for 205,000 additional ground troops, to be gained by mobilizing reserves, but intended these remain in the US as an active reserve. The president decided this was not easily accomplished. Together with the Tet Offensive and shifts in American public opinion, this abortive effort contributed to President Johnson&#x27;s ultimate decision to de-escalate the war.

After the election of President Richard M. Nixon, Wheeler oversaw the implementation of the &quot;Vietnamization&quot; program, whereby South Vietnamese forces assumed increasing responsibility for the war as American forces were withdrawn.

Wheeler retired from the U.S. Army in July 1970. Wheeler was the longest-serving Chairman of the Joint Chiefs to date, serving six years. Upon his retirement, he was awarded the Defense Distinguished Service Medal and was the first recipient of that decoration.

==Death==

Wheeler died in Frederick, Maryland, after a heart attack on 18 December 1975.

<doc id="1309683" wikidata="Q5393270" url="?curid=1309683" title="Preacher's kid">
<text>Preacher&#x27;s kid is a term to refer to a child of a preacher, pastor, deacon, vicar, lay leader, priest, minister or other similar church leader. Although the phrase can be used in a purely descriptive way, it may also be used as a stereotype. In some countries, a preacher&#x27;s kid is referred to as a vicar&#x27;s son/daughter.

==Phenomenon==
Children of clergy often experience pressure due to the expectations placed on them, and may develop feelings of isolation and inner conflict as a result. Parental workload (which, by definition, includes working on the weekend) may also be a source of stress. Some writers suggest that there is a &quot;preacher&#x27;s kid syndrome&quot;, in which children of clergy reject religion and the church.

Such rebellious children of the clergy are a stock figure in the Southern literature of the United States, and this view is seen as a stereotype. One literary example occurs in Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s play &quot;The Iceman Cometh&quot; when the traveling salesman Hickey describes his life: &quot;You see, even as a kid I was always restless. I had to keep on the go. You’ve heard the old saying, &#x27;Ministers&#x27; sons are sons of guns.&#x27; Well, that was me, and then some.&quot; Other writers note that children of the clergy (both Christian and Jewish) may often become clergy themselves, such as Martin Luther King Jr., son of Martin Luther King Sr.; and Franklin Graham, son of Billy Graham.

Children of clergy may be more exposed than their peers to the defining events of life. Former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown recalled that he learned much about life, death, poverty, injustice and unemployment as the son of a Church of Scotland minister. The &quot;preacher&#x27;s kid&quot; phenomenon has been connected with the related phenomenon of &quot;military brats&quot; (children of active-duty military personnel). Children of preachers who are missionaries (missionary kids) may also be third culture kids.

==Stereotypes==
There are two different stereotypes of the preacher&#x27;s kid: in one, they are perfectly angelic role models, in the other they are rebels at the opposite extreme. The existence of these stereotypes is a source of pressure on children of clergy.

Examples of the negative stereotype include the preacher&#x27;s son from Maine in the film &quot;Gettysburg&quot;, described as the &quot;best darn cusser I&#x27;ve ever heard&quot; and Jessica Lovejoy in the &quot;Bart&#x27;s Girlfriend&quot; episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, as well as the character Ariel in the 1984 film Footloose. On the sitcom &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;, the character Chrissy Snow played by Suzanne Somers played off a variety of stereotypes including the &quot;dumb blonde&quot;, but also as daughter of Reverend Luther Snow (Peter Mark Richman), the character – as well as much of the show&#x27;s humor – was developed around aspects of Chrissy&#x27;s innocence and naïvety based on a stereotype of her religious upbringing in small town America. The TV series &quot;7th Heaven&quot; is also a good example of the pastor&#x27;s kid stereotype. The Camden family father, Eric (Stephen Collins), is a minister, and he and his wife Annie (Catherine Hicks) have seven children. Sometimes they are perfect angels but most of the time the show displays the trials that the family go through as the children grow up, and often the children are criticized because of who their father is. Lifetime reality TV series Preachers&#x27; Daughters follows the lives of Christian preacher&#x27;s daughters and their families.

An enduring image from popular music is presented in the hit song &quot;Son of a Preacher Man,&quot; a ballad of young love remembered, places the minister&#x27;s son as a &quot;sweet-talkin&#x27; son of a preacher man&quot;, who is possibly more sensitive to women and thus able to emotionally reach the girl who claims that, &quot;The only one who could ever reach me/Was the son of a preacher man/The only boy who could ever teach me/Was the son of a preacher man.&quot; Versions of the recording from major stars like Dusty Springfield and Aretha Franklin kept this image, drawn from a southern US setting, visible internationally. The &quot;preacher&#x27;s daughter&quot; is also a pervasive negative stereotype ascribed to female children that has a particular set of connotations, often sexual, rebellious, or dark in nature. The stereotype is typically suggestive of a dual life: one lived as the expected descendant of piety and the other lived wild, outside of the morals of religion, cloaked in secrecy. Songs such as &quot;Preacher&#x27;s Daughter&quot; by American R&amp;B singer-songwriter Anthony Hamilton exhibit this role: &quot;She had a habit that she couldn&#x27;t really stop, needed money so she had to hit the block, nobody knew it so she steady had to play a role, went to church, but surely tearin&#x27; up her soul... she was a Preacher&#x27;s Daughter.&quot;

==Other terms==
In Scotland, to be a &quot;child of the manse&quot; is considered very influential on a person&#x27;s upbringing.

In German, the terms &quot;Pfarrerskind&quot; and &quot;Priesterkind&quot; are used to refer to children of clergy.

Greek surnames with the prefix &quot;Papa-&quot; and Armenian surnames with the prefix &quot;Ter-&quot; or &quot;Der-&quot; refer to people who are the descendants of clergy.

<text>Jiří Trnka (; 24 February 1912 – 30 December 1969) was a Czech puppet-maker, illustrator, motion-picture animator and film director.

In addition to his extensive career as an illustrator, especially of children&#x27;s books, he is best known for his work in animation with puppets, which began in 1946. Most of his films were intended for adults and many were adaptations of literary works. Because of his influence in animation, he was called &quot;the Walt Disney of Eastern Europe&quot;, despite the great differences between their works. He received the international Hans Christian Andersen Medal for illustrators in 1968, recognizing his career contribution to children&#x27;s literature.

==Biography==

===Formative years===
Jiří Trnka was born in Plzeň, in western Bohemia, where the family lived as middle class citizens. Although his father was a plumber and his mother a dressmaker, both remained very close to their peasant origins. As a child, young Jiří enjoyed sculpting puppets made of wood and put on small shows for friends.

He later attended classes at a vocational school in his hometown, where he met his teacher Josef Skupa, who eventually would become a leading public figure in the world of Czech puppeteers. Skupa was his mentor, entrusted Trnka with certain responsibilities, and managed to convince his family, who were initially reluctant, to allow him to enroll at the prestigious School of Applied Arts in Prague, where he completed his apprenticeship between 1929 and 1935.

==Career as illustrator==
With the training received in the school of arts and his experience working in a printmaking workshop, Trnka embarked upon a successful career as an illustrator. He was hired by the Prague publishing house Melantrich, and his first illustrated work was (&quot;The Tiger of Mr. Bošek&quot;) by Vítězslav Šmejc, published in 1937.

From then on, Trnka illustrated numerous children&#x27;s books. During his life he illustrated 130 works of literature, most of them for children. Especially famous are his illustrations for the tales of the Brothers Grimm, and collections of folktales from Czech authors such as Jiří Horák and Jan Páleníček. Also drawing upon his native folklore are his illustrations for by Vladimír Holan, published in 1955, which proved to be the starting point for his future work in animation. In addition to these, Trnka illustrated the tales of Andersen and Perrault, the fables of La Fontaine, &quot;The Thousand and One Nights&quot;, several works of Shakespeare and Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (unfinished).

In some cases his work as illustrator generated his ideas for making animated films, as happened with &quot;Bajaja&quot; and &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;.

Trnka also created some children&#x27;s books as writer and illustrator, for example &quot;Through the Magic Gate&quot;, published in 1962 in London.

The biennial Hans Christian Andersen Award conferred by the International Board on Books for Young People is the highest recognition available for a writer or illustrator of children&#x27;s books. Trnka received the Illustrator award in 1968 for his lasting contribution. He also taught: his pupils included Daniela Havlíčková.

==Career as animator==

===Beginnings===
After graduating from the Prague School of Arts and Crafts, Trnka created a puppet theater in 1936. This group was dissolved when World War II began, and he instead designed stage sets and illustrated books for children throughout the war. Several years later, at the end of World War II, he founded with Eduard Hofman and Jiří Brdečka the animation studio . He began his activity in the study of animation by making some 2D animated short films: (&quot;Grandfather Planted a Beet&quot;, 1945); (&quot;Animals and Bandits&quot;, 1946), which was awarded at the 1st Cannes Film Festival, just one year after he had begun working in films, (&quot;Springman and the SS&quot;, 1946), an anti-Nazi film, and (&quot;The Gift&quot;, 1946), a satire on the values of the middle class in a style echoing surrealism. Despite his early success, Trnka did not feel comfortable with traditional animation, which in his opinion required too many intermediaries that prevented him from freely expressing his creativity. In the fall of 1946 he first considered puppet animation films, and began to experiment with the help of Břetislav Pojar.

===Early films (1947–1950)===
The result was his first feature puppet film in a cycle (&quot;The Czech Year&quot;, 1947), based on a book illustrated by Mikoláš Aleš. The cycle consists of six short films, which put on stage the legends and customs of his country: Carnival (), spring (Jaro), the legend of St. Procopius (), the procession (), party in the village () and Bethlehem (). The film attracted international attention to Czech animation and gained awards at many festivals, including the Venice Film Festival.

From 1948, the studios of Trnka began to receive subsidies from the government. The next film they produced was  (&quot;The Emperor&#x27;s Nightingale&quot;, 1949), based on the 1843 fairy tale &quot;The Nightingale&quot; by Hans Christian Andersen. Unlike the previous, it is a real feature film with one single storyline. The movie also includes real actors (two children, Helena Patrocková and Jaromir Sobota), although only in the prologue that precedes the story itself. The puppets and sets are significantly different from the previous film, given the setting of an idealized imperial China.  also won numerous awards at international festivals across Europe and the United States.

During 1949, Trnka also made three short films with animated puppets: (&quot;Story of a Bass&quot;, or &quot;Novel with Bass&quot;), adapted from a story by Anton Chekhov; (&quot;The Devil&#x27;s Mill&quot;), based on a Czech fairy-tale, and (&quot;Song of the Prairie&quot;), a western parody loosely based on &quot;Stagecoach&quot; (known in Trnka&#x27;s country as &quot;The Diligence&quot;) by John Ford.

The following year he produced his third feature animation with puppets,  (&quot;The Prince Bayaya&quot;, 1950), based on two stories by writer . Set in a fantastical medieval time, it is the story of a farmer who succeeds in becoming a knight, defeats a dragon, and wins the love of a princess.

===1950s===
During the first half of the next decade, Trnka experimented with new techniques in his short animations. He returned to the cartoon (&quot;The Golden Fish&quot;, 1951), and animated shadow puppets in (1953). In (&quot;The Merry Circus&quot;, 1951) he used a technique that involved stop-motion with two-dimensional paper cutouts. He neglected, however, the production of any animated feature-length puppet film. Apparently, for a time he had the idea of making a film about Don Quixote, but the project was not well received by the Czechoslovakian authorities. In 1953 he premiered (&quot;Old Czech Legends&quot;, 1953), his quarter-length movie. As with , his first feature, is structured in seven episodes that tell the legendary history of the Czech people. The film is adapted from a work by Alois Jirásek (1851-1930), then a popular author among the Czech youth, and has an obvious patriotic tone.

In the same vein of exploring the classics of Czech literature, Trnka in 1955 faced the challenge of adapting to the screen a work immensely popular, the anti-war satire of Jaroslav Hašek (&quot;The Good Soldier Švejk&quot;). At that time there already existed film adaptations of this work made using real actors, but Trnka was the first to make an animated film about the character. For the construction of the puppets, Trnka was inspired by the illustrations for the original book made by Josef Lada, which in the popular imagination were closely associated with the characters of Hašek. This humorous film is divided into three episodes, which tell the grotesque adventures of Švejk during World War I. It received several awards at international festivals.

In 1959 he made his last feature film: (&quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, 1959), adapted from one of the most famous works of William Shakespeare. Trnka had previously illustrated this book so he knew it well. In his adaptation he gave focus not only to the images, but also to the music of Václav Trojan, and strove to give the film an air of ballet, for which he hired a renowned dancer as an adviser. The puppets used in the film were not constructed of wood, but of a specially-made plastic, which allowed for a more detailed modeling of faces. Although it did not escape some criticism, was a resounding international success and is recognized as one of Trnka&#x27;s masterpieces.

===The sixties===

Over the next decade, the filmmaker made only a few short films, which were progressively in a pessimistic tone. The first was (&quot;The Passion&quot;, 1962), the story of a young man passionate about his motorcycle. He followed that same year with (&quot;Cyber Grandma&quot;), a satire on the increasing importance of technology in everyday life. (&quot;The Archangel Gabriel and Ms Goose&quot;, 1964), set in medieval Venice, adapts one of the stories of the &quot;Decameron&quot; by Boccaccio.

He considered his greatest work to be the short (&quot;The Hand&quot;, 1965), his last film. In the words of Bendazzi, &quot;Ruka&quot; is &quot;a kind of hymn to the creative freedom raging.&quot; In short, it is about a sculptor visited by a huge hand, which seeks the completion of a sculpture of itself. By rejecting the imposition, the artist is constantly pursued by the hand, ending with induced suicide and the hand officiating at his funeral. is considered a protest against the conditions imposed by the Czechoslovak communist state to artistic creation, and even some have seen in it an anticipation of the so-called Prague Spring. Although the film initially had no problems with censorship, after his death copies were confiscated and banned from public display in Czechoslovakia for two decades.

===Death===
Jiří Trnka died of complications from a heart condition in 1969 when he was only 57 years old, in Prague. His funeral, held in Plzeň, was a large public event.

==Animation techniques==
Throughout his career Trnka experimented with different animation techniques, from traditional cartoons in his first shorts to animation with shadow puppets. However, his preferred method, and that which gave him worldwide fame, was stop-motion puppet work. His carved puppet characters were animated in complex sets with an expressive use of lighting. In this manner he was able to realize the dream of Czech baroque sculptors to set their sculptures in motion. Of puppet films Trnka said:
:Puppet films are truly unlimited in their possibilities: they can express themselves with the greatest force precisely when the realistic expression of the cinematographic image often faces insurmountable obstacles.

Really Trnka was not involved so much with the animation itself, but primarily on the development of scripts and puppet making. His studio had a trained team of animators, among which especially Břetislav Pojar was credited as responsible for the animation of many of Trnka&#x27;s films. Other prominent animators from Trnka&#x27;s studios were Stanislav Látal, Jan Karpaš, Bohuslav Šrámek, Eduard Hofman and Václav Bedřich.

Although animated films with puppets had already been made before Trnka, he corresponds to the main thrust of this technique, later used in many parts of the world. Unlike what had been done before, Trnka chose not to alter the appearance of the dolls with artificial elements to denote their emotions but to keep it unchanged, getting his expression through changes in framing and lighting. According to Pojar:
:He always gave his eyes a look indefinable. With the simple turn of their heads, or with a change of lighting, rose smiling expressions, or unhappy, or dreamers. This gave one the impression that the puppet hid more than it showed, and its heart of wood stored even more.

The scripts of the films were also Trnka&#x27;s own work, who often used works of Czech authors (many of them related to popular folklore), as well as classics of world literature, such as Chekhov, Boccaccio, and Shakespeare. On some scripts he collaborated with Jiří Brdečka.

In Trnka animated films the music also had an important role. In all his films and several of his short films, the composer of the music was Václav Trojan (1905–1983).

<doc id="1309699" wikidata="Q3407580" url="?curid=1309699" title="Proprietary colony">
<text>Proprietary colonies were a type of colony in English America which existed during the early modern period. In English overseas possessions established from the 17th century onwards, all land in the colonies belonged to the Crown, which held ultimate authority over their management. All English colonies were divided by the Crown via royal charters into one of three types of colony; proprietary colonies, charter colonies and Crown colonies. Under the proprietary system, individuals or companies (often joint-stock companies), known as proprietors, were granted commercial charters by the Crown to establish overseas colonies. These proprietors were thus granted the authority to select the governors and other officials in the colony. 

This type of indirect rule eventually fell out of favour in the English colonial empire due to a variety of reasons, including the gradual sociopolitical stabilisation of England&#x27;s American colonies, the easing of bureaucratic difficulties in managing the colonies and increasing economic or administrative difficulties faced by proprietors. Successive English sovereigns sought to solidify their power and authority throughout the empire, and gradually converted proprietary colonies to Crown colonies, which were administered by officials directly appointed by the Crown. By the 18th century, most former proprietary colonies had been converted into Crown colonies.

== Practice ==
Proprietary colonies in America were governed by a lord proprietor, who, holding authority by virtue of a royal charter, usually exercised that authority almost as an independent sovereign. These colonies were distinct from Crown colonies in that they were commercial enterprises established under authority of the crown. Proprietary governors had legal responsibilities over the colony as well as responsibilities to shareholders to ensure the security of their investments. 

 Many never even visited the colonies they owned. By the early 18th century, nearly all of the proprietary colonies had either or else had significant limitations placed on them by the crown.

== Examples ==

===The Caribbean===
*Barbados

===British America colonies before the American Revolution===
The provinces of Maryland, Carolina and several other colonies in the Americas were initially established under the proprietary system. 

King Charles II used the proprietary solution to reward allies and focus his own attention on Britain itself. He offered his friends colonial charters which facilitated private investment and colonial self-government. The charters made the proprietor the effective ruler, albeit one ultimately responsible to English Law and the King. Charles II gave the former Dutch colony New Netherlands to his younger brother The Duke of York, who established the Province of New York. He gave an area to William Penn who established the Province of Pennsylvania.

The British America colonies before the American Revolution consisted of 20 colonies on the continent&#x27;s mainland. After the conflict, thirteen of those became states of the United States of America. By the time of the Revolution some had consolidated multiple grants, while others, such as conflicting claims to what became the state of Vermont and the western borders of numerous states, including New York and Virginia, as well as the sovereignty of what became the state of Maine in 1820, remained unresolved well after.

== Similar practices outside of English rule ==

=== Historical precedent ===
In medieval times, it was customary in Continental Europe for a sovereign to grant almost regal powers of government to the feudal lords of his border districts to prevent foreign invasion. Those districts or manors were often called palatinates or counties palatine because the lord wielded the power of the king in his palace. His power was regal in kind but inferior in degree to that of the king.

That type of arrangement had caused many problems in Norman times for certain English border counties. Those territories were known as counties palatine and lasted at least in part to 1830 for good reason: remoteness, poor communications, governance carried out under difficult circumstances. The monarch and the government retained their usual right to separate head and body, figuratively or literally, at any time. (See also the hereditary title &quot;marquess&quot;.)

=== French examples ===
In 1603, Henry IV, the King of France, granted Pierre Du Gua de Monts the exclusive right to colonize lands in North America at a latitude between 40° and 60° North. The King also gave Dugua a monopoly in the fur trade for those territories and named him Lieutenant General for Acadia and New France. In return, Dugua promised to bring 60 new colonists each year to what would be called &quot;Acadie&quot;. In 1607, the monopoly was revoked, and the colony failed, but in 1608, he sponsored Samuel de Champlain to open a colony at Quebec.

The &quot;Îles Glorieuses&quot; (Glorioso Islands) were on 2 March 1880 settled and named by the Frenchman Hippolyte Caltaux (b. 1847–d. 1907), who was their proprietor from until 1891. It was only on 23 August 1892 that they were claimed for the French Third Republic, as part of the Indian Ocean colony of French Madagascar. Caltaux again became their proprietor from 1901 to his death. On 26 June 1960, the islands became a regular French possession, administered by the High Commissioner for Réunion. On 3 January 2005, they were transferred to the administrators of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands.

<doc id="1309701" wikidata="Q1450887" url="?curid=1309701" title="Drops of Jupiter">
<text>Drops of Jupiter is the second studio album by American pop rock band Train, released on March 27, 2001. The album&#x27;s title is derived from &quot;Drops of Jupiter (Tell Me)&quot;, its lead single, which was a hit internationally and won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Song.

The album contains elements of rock, country and indie rock. Besides &quot;Drops of Jupiter (Tell Me)&quot;, two other singles were released from this album: &quot;She&#x27;s on Fire&quot; and &quot;Something More&quot;, both of which also achieved some success on the Adult Top 40 chart.

Debuting at #6 in the United States upon its release, it has since been certified 3× platinum by the RIAA in the United States and 2× platinum by the CRIA in Canada. It is the band&#x27;s best-selling album to date.

A 20th-anniversary edition was released on March 26, 2021.

==Critical reception==

The album received mixed reviews. AllMusic writer Mark Morgenstein said that &quot;There is nothing cutting edge about Train&#x27;s Sophomore Effort&quot;. He also stated that &quot;Train is a classic rock wannabe band in the mold of Counting Crows, although that&#x27;s not always a bad thing&quot;. Another mixed review appeared in &quot;Billboard&quot;, which wrote that &quot;The music fails to gain any momentum until track seven, and by then, Train&#x27;s lucky the listener&#x27;s still spinning the CD...Let&#x27;s hope that if Train&#x27;s given the chance to make a third album, it&#x27;ll finally fill it with clearly discernable songs.&quot;

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Writer Aidin Vaziri had this to say about the album: &quot;Drops of Jupiter, conjuring vivid memories of &quot;Recovering The Satellites&quot;. The anthemic song is the centerpiece here, showcasing the singer&#x27;s yearning voice and band&#x27;s swooping, string-laden melodies, but Train has more to offer. The brooding &quot;Mississippi&quot; presents an intoxicating mix of acoustic guitars and dreamy horns, while &quot;Let It Roll&quot; mixes mournful slide guitars and loose-limbed rhythms in the perfect meeting of blustery earnestness and unapologetic commerciality.&quot;

<text>MU Online () is an isometric medieval fantasy MMORPG, produced by Webzen, a Korean gaming company. It was introduced in 2001, and is still being supported and updated in 2024.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Mu Online&quot; was created in December 2001 by the Korean gaming company Webzen Inc. Like most MMORPGs, players create a character among nine different classes and set foot on the MU Continent. To gain experience and thus level up, a player needs to fight monsters (mobs). MU is populated by a large variety of monsters, from simple ones like goblins and golems, to more challenging ones such as the Gorgon, Kundun or Selupan. Each monster type is unique, has different spawn points, and drops different items. Outside of a duel, PvP fighting is possible but discouraged. When one player attacks another, a self-defense system is activated, in which the attacked player may kill the aggressor within a time limit. Self-defense is also activated when a player attacks an Elf&#x27;s summoned creature. Outlaws have disadvantages during gameplay, depending on their Outlaw level.

==Character classes==
At the start of the game the players can choose between 13 different character classes - Dark Wizard, Dark Knight, Elf, Summoner, Rage Fighter, Magic Gladiator, Dark Lord, Grow Lancer, Rune Wizard, Slaicer, Gun Crusher, White Mage Kundun, Mage Lemuria, and Illusion Knight. Players can unlock two classes if they reach a certain level with one character: Magic Gladiator and Dark Lord. Also, character cards can be purchased in order to unlock more character classes. Each class has its specific powers and items. As characters level up and complete quests, they can transform themselves into stronger classes. Each progressive class change grants, gain access to new spells, skills, weapons and wings as well as an associated change in appearance.

===Spells and skills===
Like most MMO games, characters in &quot;MU&quot; can use many different kinds of magic and special abilities. Each character has its own set of spells, and some weapons may be enchanted to provide the character with a specific spell. Casting a spell costs MP (mana, or magic points) and sometimes AG or stamina.

===Communications===
&quot;Mu Online&quot; has a built-in chat system that allows all visible players to communicate easily via text. Users can add custom players to their Friends List in order to make it easy to keep in contact with one another. Other methods of chat were also available, such as Guild chat and Party chat.

===Cooperative play===
Players can choose to team up with other players in a &quot;party&quot;, in which players cooperate against enemy monsters to share exp and loot. Early seasons of the game encouraged party play by rewarding the player with the highest level more experience points for helping lower-level players. Players could not see the level of other players in the party, but because spending character points on vitality was highly discouraged, players could guess quite accurately the level of other players by seeing their health bars. Some builds were made for parties only, like the part elf, which focused on filling up the energy stat, being protected by a summoned mob, and buffing party members.

==Sequels==
* &quot;MU Legend&quot; was released in August 2018 free on Steam via Valofe.
* &quot;MU Origin&quot; was released in 2016.
* &quot;MU Origin 2&quot; was updated in May 2022 on Google Play, with versions uploaded by GameNow and Webzen.
* &quot;MU Origin 3&quot; was updated in June 2022 on Google Play by FingerFun.

<doc id="1309711" wikidata="Q5303423" url="?curid=1309711" title="U.S. Bank Stadium station">
<text>U.S. Bank Stadium station (formerly Downtown East/Metrodome (2004–13) and Downtown East (2014–16)) is a light rail station on the Metro Blue Line and Green Line in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

The station is located next to U.S. Bank Stadium, where the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome plaza used to be at the east end of downtown Minneapolis. It is a side-platform station. Service began at this station when the Blue Line opened on June 26, 2004.

In March 2016, the station was renamed to U.S. Bank Stadium station, after the new stadium planned for the Minnesota Vikings; for the station&#x27;s naming rights, Metro will receive $300,000 annually from the Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority and the team in the form of in-stadium promotions, advertising and marketing support to encourage transit ridership to stadium events. 

==Services and connections==
The station is served by METRO Green and Blue Lines. It is the primary transfer point between the two lines, as it is the last east/south-bound station shared by the two. Green Line trains feature posters reminding airport-bound passengers to change to the Blue Line at Downtown East.

During sporting events at the Metrodome, large crowds used to line up to use the trains. It would take up to an hour for the platforms to return to normal after a big game.

Prior to the opening of the METRO Green Line, the station was the main stop for students traveling to the East Bank and West Bank campuses of the University of Minnesota Twin Cities, as a few frequent bus routes ran to campus nearby. Today, the METRO Green Line light rail runs between Minneapolis and St. Paul and now provides a direct connection to the university. Among buses, only Route 3 now serves the station.

==Pedestrian bridge==
The Metrodome was torn down in 2014 in preparation for the construction of US Bank Stadium which opened in 2016. A pedestrian bridge to carry US Bank Stadium attendees across the light rail tracks was first approved by the Metropolitan Council in 2015. When the cost was estimated at $7 million in 2015, the Vikings agreed to pay for half of the cost. Bids to construct the bridge were significantly higher than expected boosting the estimated cost to $9.7 million by November 2015. A tight timeline for construction and the impending opening of the stadium in summer 2016 resulted in reduced interest from bidders. The bridge ultimately cost $10.6 million to construct after last minute changes were made to the design.

==Signalling==
East of this station, past the crossing of 4th Street and Chicago Avenue, trains enter the segment of the line where automatic block signaling (ABS) is used. In contrast, light rail vehicles must obey stop lights in the downtown region. The rail line uses a system of lights which display either vertical or horizontal white bars to the train operator.

The two METRO lines split east of the station, over Interstate 35W.

==Art==

A major feature of the site is a set of large ornamental arches and the plaza paving design, by artist Andrew Leicester, which stand next to the station. They are meant to reflect the Stone Arch Bridge, a major landmark of the city that crosses the Mississippi River a few blocks away. The patterns in the brickwork are meant to reflect fabric designs worn by 19th century immigrants in the Elliot Park neighborhood.

<text>Morcote is a municipality in the Swiss canton of Ticino situated about 10 kilometres from Lugano in the district of Lugano on the shore of Lake Lugano.

==History==

Morcote is first mentioned historically in 926 as &quot;Murcau&quot;, which comes from the Latin &quot;Morae caput&quot;, meaning &quot;head of the hill&quot;. In 1353 it was mentioned as &quot;Murchoe&quot; and again in 1453 as &quot;Murchote&quot;.

Starting around 1100, Morcote was home to a castle that was built to guard and control commerce on the lake. Until the dam was built in Melide in 1847, Morcote was the largest port on Lake Lugano. Goods from northern Italy were shipped across the lake to the rest of Ticino. In 1422 the town was granted privileges by the Duke of Milan, which included the rights to impose taxes, self-government, independent fishing and the right to hold markets. After the plague year of 1432, only seven families survived in the town. The town was often caught between the rival powers of Milan and Como as they fought for control in Lombardy. In 1517 the region came under the control of the Old Swiss Confederation, and was added to the Vogtei of Lugano. However Morcote retained extensive rights, including judicial and tax autonomy as well as fishing rights over the entire lake.

During the Late Middle Ages the major industries of Morcote included fishing, farming and shipping. During the end of the Middle Ages, artists began to move into the town as well. In 1583 the town had a self-supporting parish established in the parish church Santa Maria del Sasso, which dated from the 13th century.

In 1862, seven houses slid into the lake.

During the 19th century tourism grew into a major industry in Morcote. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, wine production and handicrafts have been added to tourism.

==Geography==
Morcote has an area, (as of the 2004/09 survey) of . Of this area, about 2.5% is used for agricultural purposes, while 81.5% is forested and 16.0% is settled (buildings or roads). In the 2004/09 survey a total of or about 13.3% of the total area was covered only with buildings, an increase of over the 1983 amount. About 0.72% of the total area is recreational space. Of the agricultural land, is used for orchards and vineyards, is fields and grasslands and consists of alpine grazing areas. Since 1983 the amount of agricultural land has decreased by . Over the same time period the amount of forested land has increased by . Despite being on the lake, the borders of the municipality do not include any rivers or lakes.

The municipality is located in the Lugano district, between Lake Lugano and Monte Arbostora. It consists of the village of Morcote, the village of Vico until 1803 and between 1803–16, Carabietta.

==Coat of arms==
The blazon of the municipal coat of arms is &quot;Per fess gules a shepherdess sitting on a garb all argent and vert a sow and her piglets also argent.&quot;

==Heritage sites of national significance==

The Chapel of S. Antonio Abate with its monumental staircase, the Parish Church of S. Maria del Sasso with Oratory, the Cimitero monumentale (Cemetery) and Scherrer Park are listed as Swiss heritage site of national significance. The entire village of Morcote is part of the Inventory of Swiss Heritage Sites.

===Sites===
The church of Santa Maria del Sasso was probably built in the 13th century. It was completely rebuilt in 1462 in the style of the Renaissance. In 1758 it was renovated in the Baroque style, while in the 18th century a monumental staircase was added to the front of the church. The church tower was built in the Middle Ages and made taller during the 16th century. The church contains several valuable frescos from the 16th and 17th centuries including one painting that is dated to 1513. The sacramental chapel contains carvings from 1591 and paintings from 1611. In the chapel on the opposite side contains an example of illusionistic architecture painting from the 18th century.

Near the church is the Chapel Sant&#x27;Antonio da Padova which was built in 1676 with an unusual octagonal floor plan and dome.
In 1750, a large cemetery was added near the church. In the terraced cemetery overlooking the lake, many artists are buried, among them Alexander Moissi, actor, Georges Baklanoff, Russian baritone, Georg Kaiser, German author, and Eugen d’Albert, German composer and pianist.

The chapel of Sant&#x27;Antonio Abate, consecrated before 1591, was originally a hospice run by the Antonines order of Vienna. The interior houses several frescoes from a 15th-century master artist from Seregno, as well as other newer paintings.

The arcades along the lake shore date partly from the Late Middle Ages and include several noble houses from the 16th to 18th centuries. One of the most interesting is the &quot;Palazzo Paleari&quot;, which was built in 1483 and renovated in 1661.

In 1965, Scherrer Gardens, the former home of wealthy St. Gallen textile merchant, was opened to the public. The gardens are rich with luxurious subtropical vegetation and many kinds of buildings and art, both original and copies from all over the world. The gardens include palm trees, camellias, wisteria and oleanders, cedar and cypress trees, camphor and eucalyptus, magnolias and azaleas, orange and lemon trees, bamboo and many other kinds of fragrant plants.

<text>The Municipality of Crowsnest Pass is a specialized municipality in southwest Alberta, Canada. Within the Rocky Mountains adjacent to the eponymous Crowsnest Pass, the municipality formed as a result of the 1979 amalgamation of five municipalities – the Village of Bellevue, the Town of Blairmore, the Town of Coleman, the Village of Frank, and Improvement District No. 5, which included the Hamlet of Hillcrest and numerous other unincorporated communities.
== History ==
The communities in Crowsnest Pass owe their existence to coal mining. The first coal mine in the area opened in 1900. Its ethnic and cultural diversity comes from the many European and other immigrants attracted to the area by the mines. Through the years, coal mining suffered from fluctuating coal prices, bitter strikes, and underground accidents. All the mines on the Alberta side of the pass closed throughout the 20th century as cheaper with the opening of safer open-pit mines on the British Columbia side of the pass. An operating coal mine just across the British Columbia boundary in Sparwood continues to provide employment for residents living in the Municipality of Crowsnest Pass.

Crowsnest Pass is known for tragedy. In 1903, the tip of Turtle Mountain broke loose and decimated part of the Village of Frank. The event was heralded as the Frank Slide). In 1914, the Hillcrest mine disaster occurred near Hillcrest, killing 189 people. Spring floods occurred in 1923 and 1942. Periodic forest fires have swept the valley, including one in the summer of 2003 that threatened the entire municipality.

The area was a centre for &quot;rum-running&quot; during prohibition, from 1916 to 1923, when liquor was illegally brought across the provincial boundary from British Columbia. The legacy is celebrated at the restored Alberta Provincial Police Barracks, which is now an interpretive centre.

On November 3, 1978, the Government of Alberta passed the &quot;Crowsnest Pass Municipal Unification Act&quot;, which led to the formal amalgamation of Bellevue, Blairmore, Coleman, Frank, and Improvement District (ID) No. 5 on January 1, 1979. The new municipality was granted town status and named the &quot;Municipality of Crowsnest Pass&quot;. A review of the amalgamation in 1983 concluded that the unification led to improved municipal services and housing within the new municipality.

In the mid-1990s, the adjacent ID No. 6 was carved up with portions going to the MD of Pincher Creek No. 9 on December 31, 1994, the MD of Ranchland No. 66 on January 1, 1995, and ID No. 40 on December 31, 1995. Crowsnest Pass then amalgamated with the remainder of ID No. 6 on January 1, 1996, while ID No. 40 was absorbed by the MD of Pincher Creek No. 9 on the same date. The amalgamated municipality retained the name &quot;Municipality of Crowsnest Pass&quot; and its town status. It subsequently became a specialized municipality on January 16, 2008. The purpose of the status change was to enable membership in the Alberta Association of Municipal Districts and Counties for increased alignment with its neighbouring rural municipalities.

== Geography ==
The Municipality of Crowsnest Pass is in the southwest portion of the province of Alberta. It borders the province of British Columbia to the west, the Municipal District (MD) of Ranchland No. 66 to the north, and the MD of Pincher Creek No. 9 to the east and south. The Crowsnest River, which originates from Crowsnest Lake, meanders eastward through the municipality. Parts of the Rocky Mountains Forest Reserve are in the northwest and southern portions of the municipality.

<doc id="1309786" wikidata="Q638583" url="?curid=1309786" title="Roy Williamson">
<text>Roy Murdoch Buchanan Williamson (25June 193612August 1990) was a Scottish songwriter and folk musician, most notably with The Corries. Williamson is best known for writing &quot;Flower of Scotland&quot;, which has become the de facto national anthem of Scotland used at international sporting events.

==Early life==
Roy Williamson&#x27;s father, Archibald Moir Macrae Williamson, was an advocate (a lawyer); his mother, Agnes Ethel Cumming Buchanan Williamson, was a talented pianist who frequently took her two sons, Robert and Roy, to musical events. As a schoolboy, Williamson learned to play the recorder by ear, pretending to read music. A teacher found out and banned him from music lessons. He went to Wester Elchies School, then Aberlour House and Gordonstoun in Moray. He taught seamanship and navigation at Burghead before going to Edinburgh College of Art. It was there in 1955 that he met Ronnie Browne, with whom he would team up in The Corries. The partnership lasted almost thirty years. Williamson and Browne also shared a passion for rugby, having played wing against each other for Edinburgh Wanderers and Boroughmuir, respectively.

Williamson&#x27;s father committed suicide when his son was eight years old. Williamson had a brother, Robert Buchanan Williamson, two daughters, Karen and Sheena, and was married twice—first to Violet Thomson and then to Nicolette van Hurck, from Holland.

==Musical career==
===The Corries===

Williamson joined Bill Smith and Ron Cruikshank to form the &quot;Corrie Folk Trio&quot; in 1962. The Trio&#x27;s first performance was in the Waverley Bar on St Mary&#x27;s Street, Edinburgh. After a few weeks Ron Cruikshank left because he had contracted glandular fever. The Trio had already accepted an engagement at the Edinburgh Festival, so Williamson suggested that Ronnie Browne should be asked to join the group in order that it would have three members again. At a later date, the group added female Northern Irish singer Paddie Bell to become the &quot;Corrie Folk Trio and Paddie Bell&quot;. The audience was only eight people for the debut of the Trio, but by the end of the festival it was a full house at every performance.

By 1966, Paddie Bell and Bill Smith had left, with Bell saying that she wanted to perform songs that were different from the ones the Trio sang and Smith having fallen out with Browne (Smith cites that he himself was a perfectionist). These developments left Williamson and Browne to continue the group. Williamson was a singer who was also a gifted multi-instrumentalist; Browne, by contrast, was a gifted singer who had learned to play various musical instruments. The two men cancelled all engagements for a few months to practice intensively. Under a new name, &quot;The Corries&quot;, they performed at the Jubilee Arms Hotel in Cortachy, Angus. The enthusiastic response encouraged them to continue as a duo, and they became highly successful in Scotland and eventually throughout much of the world. 

===&quot;Flower of Scotland&quot;===

Williamson wrote Flower of Scotland during the 1960s; it is currently the most popular candidate for a Scottish national anthem. The song now represents Scotland at international rugby and international football matches, and at the Commonwealth Games. It was sung in the 2007 Commonwealth Games by Ronnie Browne, though he swore never to sing it again, saying that it was a struggle not to be overcome with emotion.

===Combolin===
Williamson, whose many talents ranged from art to woodworking, co-designed a boat named The Sheena Margaret, which was named for his younger daughter with his first wife, Violet. In the summer of 1969 he invented the &#x27;combolins&#x27;, two complementary instruments that combined several instruments into a single one. Browne&#x27;s instrument contained a mandolin with a guitar (along with four bass strings operated with slides); Williamson&#x27;s had a guitar as well as the 12-string Spanish bandurria, the latter being an instrument he had played since the early days of the Corrie Folk Trio.

Originally conceived as a way to combine several of the many instruments they carried around on tour – the Corries&#x27; long row of chairs behind them on stage bearing instruments is legendary – the combolins in fact became an additional two instruments for the tour van. Most often, Browne played the guitar/mandolin instrument with bass strings, and Williamson the other, which also had 13 sympathetic strings designed to resonate like the Indian sitar.

The wood for the combolins was obtained from antique hardwood furniture as well as premium grade Tyrolean spruce, and displayed Williamson&#x27;s artistic embellishments in silver and mother of pearl. The Corries&#x27; album, Strings and Things (1970), was specifically designed to display the new instruments: It featured detailed descriptions of them on the rear sleeve.

Williamson had advertised the combolins a year prior to completing them and had first tested them only a short while before a concert but found that they sounded terrible. He had to quickly rebuild them and learn to play them with Browne before the concert day.

When the combolins were played, Browne and Williamson often switched places from left to right respectively to right and left.

==Personal life==
===Health problems===
As a young man, Roy Williamson had played rugby for Edinburgh Wanderers, the rivals of Boroughmuir, the team for which Browne had played. Williamson suffered throughout his life from asthma; he usually discontinued his asthma treatments before a show or a concert. He continued performing until late in 1989, when his final illness became apparent. 

===Death===

Williamson died of a brain tumour on 12 August 1990.

<text>Ronald Grant Browne (born 20 August 1937), known as The Voice, is a Scottish musician and songwriter, who is a founding member of The Corries.

==Biography==
Browne was born in Edinburgh to John Albert &#x27;Bertie&#x27; Browne, a truck driver, and Anne &#x27;Nancy&#x27; Browne. He was raised in Scotland. Aside from singing, Browne&#x27;s other abilities are painting, sketching and rugby, having once played as a winger for his secondary school Boroughmuir. He met Roy Williamson on the rugby field, as Williamson had played as a winger for Boroughmuir&#x27;s rivals Edinburgh Wanderers.

This led to meeting multi-instrumentalist Bill Smith at Edinburgh College of Art in 1955 and the formation of the Corrie Folk Trio in 1962. The group was expanded the following year with the addition of female singer Paddie Bell. Shortly after releasing three albums in 1965, Bell left to begin a solo career. With the departure of Smith, the following year, Browne and Williamson continued to perform as a duo now known as The Corries. 

In 1970, Williamson conceived and built the band&#x27;s signature instrument: the combolins, a pair of instruments that were rarely played separately. Williamson&#x27;s instrument featured a basic guitar fingerboard with a bandurria attached and sympathetic resonating strings. Browne&#x27;s model was a basic guitar with a mandolin attached and four bass strings. 

Browne and Williamson were regular performers on Scottish television shows and movies and in 1983 received an International Film and Television Festival gold award for their Scottish Television series, &quot;The Corries &amp; Other Folk&quot;. The 1996 film &quot;The Bruce&quot; features Browne&#x27;s rendition of the Williamson-penned &quot;Flower of Scotland&quot; at the end. Browne appeared in the film playing the role of Maxwell The Minstrel.

Since Williamson&#x27;s death in 1990, Browne continued to perform and record in the spirit of the Corries. He regularly led the singing of &quot;Flower of Scotland&quot;, de facto national anthem of Scotland, for the Scotland national rugby and football teams. During his performances, he was known to yell &quot;COME ON!&quot; to the audience during the opening line of the song he was singing and this has often been parodied by the BBC Hogmanay sketch show &quot;Only an Excuse?&quot;. As of 27 April 2015, Browne announced that due to emotional breakdowns during performances, he has put an end to singing in public.

Browne is now an accomplished portrait artist.

== Personal life ==
Browne met and fell in love with Patricia Elliott during secondary school, and the two married on 30 June 1959. Together they had three children.

Gavin Browne is the eldest, and has run The Corries Official Website since 1997.

Ronnie and Pat were married for 53 years until Pat died from cancer in 2012.

<doc id="1309790" wikidata="Q12660" url="?curid=1309790" title="Prostitution in Thailand">
<text>Prostitution in Thailand is not itself illegal, but public solicitation for prostitution is prohibited if it is carried out &quot;openly and shamelessly&quot; or &quot;causes nuisance to the public&quot;. Due to police corruption and an economic reliance on prostitution dating back to the Vietnam War, it remains a significant presence in the country. It results from poverty, low levels of education and a lack of employment in rural areas. Prostitutes mostly come from the northeastern (Isan) region of Thailand, from ethnic minorities or from neighbouring countries, especially Cambodia, Myanmar, and Laos. In 2019, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) estimated the total population of sex workers in Thailand to be 43,000.

==Legal underpinnings==
The legal framework governing prostitution in Thailand is based upon three acts:

===Prevention and Suppression of Prostitution Act===
The Prevention and Suppression of Prostitution Act, B.E. 2539 (1996) is the statute most directly dealing with prostitution. Under the act, the definition of &quot;prostitution&quot; is &quot;Sexual intercourse, or any other act, or the commission of any other act in order to gratify the sexual desire of another person in a promiscuous manner in return for money or any other benefit, irrespective of whether the person who accepts the act and the person who commits the act are of the same sex or not.&quot; A clear definition of the phrase &quot;in a promiscuous manner&quot; is not provided.

Under the act, persons who solicit sex &quot;... in an open and shameless manner...&quot; (a phrase that is not clearly defined), or who are &quot;... causing nuisance to the public...&quot; are subject to a fine. Persons associating in a &quot;prostitution establishment&quot; with another person for the purpose of prostitution faces a jail term or a fine or both. The term &quot;prostitution establishment&quot; is clearly defined in Section 4 of the relevant Act, and it may be broadly interpreted to include any place where prostitution takes place, especially in regard to cases involving sexual abuse of children that carry heavier penalties (up to six years if the child is younger than 15 years of age)—otherwise, the law is not usually enforced against prostitution in private places. The act also imposes heavier penalties against owners of prostitution businesses and establishments. The criminal code also stipulates penalties for procuring or using money earned from prostitution.

The Prevention and Suppression of Prostitution Act was written with a particular focus upon sexual abuse and trafficking of children. Section 8 penalizes those who sexually abuse children under the age of 15 years with a prison term of two to six years and a fine of up to 120,000 baht. For child victims between the ages of 15 and 18 years, the prison term is one to three years, and the fine is up to 60,000 baht.

In regard to trafficking, Section 9 of the act states that, &quot;Any person who procures, seduces or takes away any person for the prostitution of such person, even with her or his consent and irrespective of whether the various acts which constitute an offence are committed within or outside the Kingdom, shall be liable to imprisonment for a term of one to ten years and to a fine of twenty thousand to two hundred thousand Baht.&quot;

Additionally, any offense under Section 9 that is committed &quot;by means of fraud, deceit, threat, violence, [or] the exercise of undue influence or coercion,&quot; results in a penalty that is &quot;one-third heavier&quot;.

Obtaining sexual services for oneself without any of the aggravating circumstances (underage victim, trafficking, by fraud, deceit, threat, violence, or the exercise of undue influence or coercion) remains legal and is not subject to punishment under Thai law.

===Penal Code Amendment Act===
The Penal Code Amendment Act (No. 14), B.E. 2540 (1997) does not state that prostitution in Thailand is illegal.

However, Title IX, Section 286 of the Penal Code states: “Any person, being over sixteen years of age, [sic] subsists on the earning of a prostitute, even if it is some part of her incomes [sic], shall be punished with imprisonment of seven to twenty years and fined of fourteen thousand to forty thousand Baht, or imprisonment for life.” While penalties are not specified, the same section of the act penalizes any person who (i) is found residing or habitually associating with a prostitute, (ii) receives boarding, money or other benefits arranged for by a prostitute or (iii) assists any prostitute in a quarrel with a customer.

The Act was also written to address child prostitution, but lacks complete clarity, as it does not define what an &quot;indecent act&quot; is. Title IX, Section 279 of the Penal Code states: &quot;Whoever, commits an indecent act on a child not yet over fifteen years of age, whether such child shall consent or not, shall be punished with imprisonment not exceeding ten years or fined not exceeding twenty thousand Baht, or both.&quot;

===Entertainment Places Act===
The Entertainment Places Act of 1966 places the onus upon the owner of certain types of entertainment establishments if prostitution occurs on the premises, thereby making them criminally liable. According to the act, sex workers must also undergo rehabilitation for one year at a reform house upon the completion of punishment for practicing prostitution there.

Related activities such as brothel keeping, solicitation and profiting from the prostitution of others are illegal. Public nuisance laws are also used against prostitution. Prostitution operates clandestinely in many parts of the country.

==Extent==

Since the Vietnam War, Thailand has gained an international reputation among travellers from many countries as a sex tourism destination. The precise number of prostitutes in Thailand is difficult to assess. Estimates vary widely and are subject to national and international controversy. No Thai government has ever conducted a formal survey. A 2004 estimate by Dr. Nitet Tinnakul of Chulalongkorn University gave a total of 2.8 million sex workers, including two million women, 20,000 adult males, and 800,000 minors under the age of 18, but the figures for women and minors were considered to be grossly inflated by most observers, and to have resulted from poor research methods. According to a 2001 report by the World Health Organization: &quot;The most reliable suggestion is that there are between 150,000 and 200,000 sex workers.&quot; In its annual human rights report for 2008, the US State Department noted that, &quot;A government survey during the year found that there were 76,000 to 77,000 adult prostitutes in registered entertainment establishments. However, NGOs believed there were between 200,000 and 300,000 prostitutes.&quot; The state department&#x27;s &quot;2013 Human Rights Report&quot; for Thailand made no estimates of the extent of prostitution, but in 2015 &quot;Havocscope&quot;, a database providing information about the global black market, gave an approximate figure of about 250,000 for the number of prostitutes working in Thailand. UNAIDS in 2015 estimated the total population of sex workers in Thailand to be 147,000.

It has been suggested for example that there may be as many as 10,000 prostitutes on Ko Samui alone, an island resort destination not usually noted for prostitution, and that at least 10 percent of tourist dollars may be spent on the sex trade. An estimate published in 2003 placed the trade at US$4.3 billion per year, or about three percent of the Thai economy. In 2015 &quot;Havocscope&quot; said that about US$6.4 billion in annual revenue was being generated by the trade, a figure which accounted for 10 percent of Thailand&#x27;s GDP. Havocscope says that sex workers in Thailand send an annual average of US$300 million to family members who reside in more rural areas of Thailand.

In 1996, the police in Bangkok estimated that there were at least 5,000 Russian prostitutes working in Thailand, many of whom had arrived through networks controlled by Russian gangs.

In July 2016, it was reported that the Thai government intended to abolish the sex industry. Kobkarn Wattanavrangkul, the tourism minister, said &quot;Tourists don&#x27;t come to Thailand for [sex]. They come here for our beautiful culture&quot; and that &quot;We want Thailand to be about quality tourism. We want the sex industry gone&quot;. Kobkarn was replaced as tourism minister in November 2017. The Royal Thai Police says that more than 24,000 people were arrested, prosecuted and fined for offences related to prostitution in 2019.

The closure of the country&#x27;s borders in 2020 as a reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic in Thailand resulted in there being few foreign clients for the country&#x27;s sex workers. 35 percent of them had no access to public cash relief; some were refused government financial aid after they identified themselves as sex workers, while others had to lie about their profession in order to receive payments. Many switched to jobs outside the sex industry. The Department of Women’s Affairs and Family Development said that it was providing sex workers with relief supplies and job training. It also said that it was planning to amend the country&#x27;s prostitution law to allow them to access social welfare benefits, as only 5 percent were part of Thailand&#x27;s social security system.

==Location==
The primary tourist &quot;prostitution zones&quot; of Thailand are often identified as the red-light districts of Bangkok, and Pattaya as well as Patong Beach Resort on Phuket Island. In addition, Hat Yai and other Malaysian border cities cater to Malaysians. In Bangkok, the areas most commonly associated with prostitution include the entertainment district of Patpong, as well as locations in the western Sukhumvit Road area, such as the street called Soi Cowboy and the Nana Plaza building. The area known as the Ratchadaphisek entertainment district, running along Ratchadaphisek Road near the Huai Khwang intersection, is the location of several large entertainment venues, which include sexual massage. Lumphini Park in central Bangkok is well-known as a prostitution spot after dark. In Pattaya the primary areas associated with prostitution are Boyztown, Sunee Plaza and Walking Street.

Rather than face of the risks of working independently, many sex workers choose the relative safety that comes with fixed employment in businesses such as &quot;karaoke&quot; bars, &quot;massage&quot; parlours, or brothels. Prostitution may take place in a number of different types of venues, including brothels, hotels, massage parlours, restaurants, saunas, hostess bars, go-go bars and &quot;beer bars&quot;. Many other service sector workers offer sexual services as a sideline. Thai prostitution is divided into different sectors that serve different markets (the main criteria being the socioeconomic status of customers and the nationality of both customers and prostitutes). Straightforward brothels, which offer no services aside from sex, represent the lower end of the market. These are most common outside Bangkok, serving low-income Thai men.

Profiting from prostitution is prohibited under Thai law, but karaoke bars and massage parlours can be registered as normal, legal businesses. When arrests of sex workers occur at such premises, police usually treat the act of prostitution as an exchange between the sex worker and the client—an exchange to which the owner of the business was not a party. Although uncommon, cases of foreign clients being charged have happened, with Pattaya being the location in which most foreigners have been caught up in a police raid. Owners of such establishments are only accused of crimes when breaking other laws, such as the employment of underage workers or illegal migrants.

===Soapy massage===

Soapy massage establishments (; , &quot;bathing and massage places&quot;), akin to Japanese soaplands, typically provide either an oil massage, nude body massage, or a bath treatment which includes sexual services. In this type of establishment, male clients can engage in sexual activity with female prostitutes. Prostitution establishments targeted at locals are usually &quot;bathing-sauna-massage&quot; parlours of this type.
There are so many soapy massage businesses in some sections of Bangkok, using massive quantities of water pumped illegally from groundwater, that they have been accused by authorities of contributing to Bangkok&#x27;s subsidence of one centimeter per year.

===Karaoke bars===

Karaoke bars are also used as a venue in the country&#x27;s sex industry, one that is more popular with locals than tourists. Women working there act as bargirls – singing, conversing with and entertaining clients. They earn money from commission on drinks and may be bought money garlands. On some occasions their clients pay a bar fine to take them out of the bar for a girlfriend experience. They may then also negotiate for the sale of sexual services. 

One observer says that, &quot;So-called &#x27;karaoke bars&#x27; commonly feature karaoke machines as décor, even though few or no customers visit such venues to sing, but rather to buy sex service.&quot; In a 2015 study by the Ubon Ratchathani Provincial Health Service, there were 2,410 women working in restaurants and karaoke bars in Ubon Ratchathani Province. Of these, 1,230 were confirmed sex workers. Just over half of them—692 women—were from Laos working illegally in Thailand.

===Massage parlours===
Although Thailand is known for Thai massage, its non-sexual, traditional style of massage, known as nuat phaen boran, some massage parlours provide customers erotic massage at additional cost including handjobs, oral sex, and sexual intercourse. The Federation of Thai Spa Associations (FTSPA) in 2016 urged authorities to clamp down on sexual services being offered at some massage parlours. The FTSPA maintains that influential figures have used legal loopholes to open &quot;pretty spas&quot; or massage parlours where tourists can buy sexual services. The difference between this type of massage and ab ob nuat is that not all massage parlours offer sexual services.

===Bars catering to foreigners===

Women (&quot;bargirls&quot;), or men, in the case of gay bars, or transsexual (&quot;kathoeys&quot;) are employed by the bars either as dancers (in the case of go-go bars) or simply as hostesses who will encourage customers to buy them drinks. Apart from these sorts of bars, there are a number of other sex trade venues. In most of these establishments the prostitutes are directly employed, but in hotels, some bars and discos freelance prostitutes are allowed to solicit clients. Prostitutes will usually receive a commission when a customer buys drinks and sexual services can be arranged to take place on premises or elsewhere (with the latter requiring the customer to pay a &quot;bar fine&quot; to release the prostitute from the bar). The relationships established in such contexts superficially mimic the &quot;dating&quot; culture of the west, with a mix of friendship, intimacy, sexual entertainment, and money.

== History ==

The documented history of prostitution in Thailand goes back at least six centuries, with overt and explicit references by the Chinese voyager Ma Huan (1433) and subsequently by European visitors (Van Neck, 1604; Gisbert Heeck, 1655 and others). Thailand has an ancient, continuous tradition of legal texts, generally described under the heading of Dhammasattha literature (Thai pron., &quot;tam-ma-sat&quot;), wherein prostitution is variously defined and universally banned. The era of traditional legal texts came to an end in the early 20th century, but these earlier texts were significant in regard to both the writ and spirit of modern legislation.

The abolition of slavery in 1905 left many women who had been bought as concubines in a state of homelessness and unemployment. Many of these became prostitutes, primarily serving migrant Chinese labourers in the country. In 1908 prostitution was legalised and medical care was provided to prostitutes under the Contagious Diseases Prevention Act, one of a variety of laws relating to the sex industry passed during the twentieth century. During World War II, large numbers of brothels were opened to serve occupying Japanese soldiers, and subsequently the British and Indian military stationed in the country after the war had ended. In the 1950s the Thai prime minister Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat initiated a morality campaign which included the aim of criminalising prostitution through the imposition of fines and imprisonment. A system of medical examinations and &quot;moral rehabilitation&quot; was introduced and the focus of public blame was moved from traffickers and procurers to the prostitutes themselves.

During the Vietnam War, Thailand&#x27;s decision to offer &quot;Rest and Recreation&quot; facilities to US forces deployed in the region brought in considerable income to the country, raising the number of prostitutes there from around 20,000 in 1957 to around 400,000 in 1964. Prostitution itself was made illegal in Thailand in 1960, when a law was passed under pressure from the United Nations. The government instituted a system of monitoring sex workers in order to prevent their mistreatment and to control the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. The Entertainment Places Act was introduced in 1966 to place further restrictions on the sex industry. 

During the Cold War, Japanese businessmen went on sex tourism with Filipino women, Thai women and South Korean women.

Since the end of the Vietnam War, there has been an enormous expansion in prostitution in Thailand, resulting in it reaching its present prominence. The 1960 law was repealed by the Prevention and Suppression of Prostitution Act, B.E. 2539 (1996). Under this law prostitution as such is technically illegal.

==Legalization attempt==
In 2003, the Ministry of Justice considered legalising prostitution as an official occupation with health benefits and taxable income and held a public discussion on the topic. Legalisation and regulation was proposed as a means to increase tax revenue, reduce corruption, and improve the situation of the workers. However, nothing further was done. In 2020, Thai sex workers took part in a campaign for legalization. The Empower Foundation, which supports sex workers, is trying to collect 10,000 signatures so that they can send a petition to parliament. In March 2023, the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security drafted a bill to legalize sex work, proposing to repeal the Prevention and Suppression of Prostitution Act 1996 and allow individuals aged 20 or older to voluntarily enter the sex industry.

==HIV/AIDS==

In 2008, 532,522 Thais were living with HIV/AIDS. The UNAIDS estimated in 2013 that from 380,000 to 520,000 Thais were living with HIV. In 2017, the number of Thais living with HIV was 440,000. The prevalence of HIV/AIDS among Thai adults aged 15–49 is estimated to be 1.1 percent (2016). Among freelance female sex workers, the prevalence of HIV was 2.8 percent in 2017. Among female sex workers in brothels, it was 0.6 percent (2017).

Mechai Viravaidya, known as &quot;Mr. Condom&quot;, has campaigned tirelessly to increase the awareness of safe sex practices and use of condoms in Thailand. He served as minister for tourism and AIDS prevention from 1991 to 1992, and also founded the restaurant chain Cabbages and Condoms, which gives free condoms to customers.

After the enactment of the Thai government&#x27;s first five-year plan to combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the country, including Mechai&#x27;s &quot;100% condom programme&quot;, as of 1994 the use of condoms during commercial sex probably increased markedly. No current data on the use of condoms is available. The programme instructed sex workers to refuse intercourse without a condom, and monitored health clinic statistics in order to locate brothels that allow sex without condoms.

=== Kathoey ===

A study done by AIDS Care investigated substance use of HIV risk behaviors among kathoey sex workers in Bangkok, Thailand. Only half of participants stated that they were tested for HIV and one had seen a health care provider in the past 12 months. It found that katheoys who experienced physical and/or sexual abuse from a father or brother were less likely to use condoms during anal sex with customers. Katheoy sex work tends to be in large cities and tourist areas including Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Phuket City, and Pattaya. Many kathoeys work part-time as freelance prostitutes and keep a day-time job. Female prostitution is often preferred to Kathoey as they are viewed as less likely to carry sexually transmitted diseases. Pressure from often specialized &quot;ladyboy&quot; bars puts kathoeys at risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases given that many customers are unwilling to use condoms.

==Reasons for prevalence and toleration==

===Social views===
Thai society has its own unique set of often contradictory sexual mores. Visiting a prostitute or a paid mistress is not an uncommon, though not necessarily acceptable, behaviour for men. Many Thai women, for example, believe the existence of prostitution actively reduces the incidence of rape. Among many Thai people, there is a general attitude that prostitution has always been, and will always be, a part of the social fabric of Thailand. On the other hand, &quot;...the idea of legalizing sex work is unacceptable to many Thais who judge the profession to be a foundation of vices. It doesn&#x27;t matter how many sex workers are left out of the formal economic sector and become more prone to extortion, exploitation and abuse – many Thais simply will not tolerate sex work as legal.&quot;

According to a 1996 study, the sexual urge of men is perceived by both Thai men and women as being very much stronger than the sexual urge of women. Where women are thought to be able to exercise control over their desires, the sexual urge of men is seen to be &quot;a basic physiological need or instinct&quot;. It is also thought by both Thai men and women that men need &quot;an occasional variation in partners&quot;. As female infidelity is strongly frowned upon in Thai society, and, according to a 1993 survey, sexual relationships for single women also meets disapproval by a majority of the Thai population, premarital sex, casual sex and extramarital sex with prostitutes is accepted, expected and sometimes even encouraged for Thai men, the latter being perceived as less threatening to a marriage over lasting relationships with a so-called &quot;minor wife&quot;.

Another factor contributing to this issue is that ordinary Thais deem themselves tolerant of other people, especially those whom they perceive as downtrodden. This acceptance has allowed prostitution to flourish without much of the extreme social stigma found in other countries. According to a 1996 study, people in Thailand generally disapprove of prostitution, but the stigma for prostitutes is not lasting or severe, especially since many prostitutes support their parents through their work. Some men do not mind marrying former prostitutes. A 2009 study of subjective well-being of prostitutes found that among the sex workers surveyed, sex work had become normalized.

===Politicians===
Chuwit Kamolvisit was the owner of several massage parlours in Bangkok and considered by many a &quot;godfather of prostitution&quot; in Thailand. In 2005 he was elected for a four-year term to the Thai House of Representatives, but in 2006 the Constitutional Court removed him from office. In October 2008 he again ran for governor of Bangkok but was not elected. He revealed in 2003 that some of his best clients were senior politicians and police officers, whom he also claimed to have paid, over a decade, more than £1.5 million in bribes so that his business, selling sex, could thrive.

Although Thailand&#x27;s sex trade aimed at foreigners can be considered overt, the industry that caters exclusively to Thai men had never before been publicly scrutinised, let alone the sexual exploits of Thailand&#x27;s unchallengeable officials.

Support of prostitution is pervasive in political circles, as BBC News reported in 2003. &quot;MPs from Thailand&#x27;s ruling Thai Rak Thai Party are getting hot under the collar over plans by the party leadership to ban them from having mistresses or visiting brothels...&quot; One MP told &quot;The Nation&quot; newspaper that if the rules were enforced, the party would only be able to field around 30 candidates, compared to its more than 200 sitting MPs.&quot;

Attitudes towards women were exemplified by MP Thirachai Sirikhan, quoted in &quot;The Nation&quot;, &quot;To have a &quot;mia noi&quot; [mistress] is an individual&#x27;s right. There should be no problem as long as the politician causes no trouble to his family or society&quot;.

After a police raid on some Bangkok parlours where policemen had sex with prostitutes, &quot;Acting Suthisan Police chief Colonel Varanvas Karunyathat defended the police action, saying that the (police) officers involved needed to have sex with the masseuses to gain evidence for the arrest.&quot; Apparently, this is standard practice as a separate police force did the same in Pattaya in May 2007.

===Organized crime===
According to a Library of Congress study published in 2003, &quot;The red-light districts of Thai cities are home to...brothels, casinos, and entertainment facilities that function both as sources of income and as operations centers for trafficking in humans...&quot; It has been estimated that organised crime groups have brought over a million women into Thailand from Yunnan in China, Laos, and Vietnam. Most of the women trafficked from China to Thailand and Malaysia are from ethnic minorities like the Dai ethnicity from areas like the from Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan province and they are trafficked by men of their own ethnicity. The Dai people are related to Thai people.

In November 2015, Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha launched a &quot;clean up Thailand&quot; campaign to eliminate organised crime in all areas, including vice.

===Religion===

Buddhism in Thailand is largely of the Theravada school, which is followed by 95 percent of the population. 
&quot;While Buddhism regards the celibate monastic life as the higher ideal, it also recognizes the importance of marriage as a social institution.&quot; 
Thai Buddhism encourages adherence to the fundamental code of Buddhist ethics for the laity. 
The Five Precepts contains an admonishment against sexual misconduct, although what constitutes misconduct from the perspective of a particular school of Buddhism varies widely depending on the local culture. In the traditional Pāli Canon, the Sigālovāda Sutta contains a large section which advises men on honoring their wives by remaining faithful.

In the book &quot;Disposable People: New Slavery in the Global Economy&quot;, Kevin Bales argues that in Thai Buddhism, women are viewed as naturally inferior to men, and that Buddha told his disciples that women were &quot;impure, carnal, and corrupting.&quot; This is also supported by the belief that women cannot attain enlightenment, although this view is disputed by other Buddhist scriptures such as the Vinaya Pitaka in the Pali Canon. The current Dalai Lama has asserted that women can attain enlightenment and function as equals to men in spiritual matters, but his branch of Buddhism is not the one practised in Thailand, which has its own particular canon of beliefs. Bales also points to the fact that ten kinds of wives are outlined in the Vinaya, or rules for monks. In the rules, the first three categories are women who can be paid for their services. In present-day Thailand, this is expressed as tolerance of prostitution by married women. Sex with prostitutes is viewed by wives as &quot;empty sex&quot;, and thus women may allow their husbands to have meaningless sex with prostitutes rather than find a new spouse. 
Buddhism also prescribes &quot;acceptance and resignation in the face of life&#x27;s pain and suffering&quot;, in accordance with belief in karma and the expiation of sins from previous lives. Women may choose to believe that serving as prostitutes is the ineluctable result of karma.

===Exploitation by police and officialdom===
Prostitution&#x27;s tenuous position in Thai society makes it ripe for exploitation by police and governmental officials. Sex businesses pay considerable sums to authorities in order to be permitted to continue in business. Sex work has become in effect a cash cow for those in a position to extract bribes. Those in a position to benefit have a financial interest in seeing the status quo continue. Business owners and individual sex workers complain that since the junta came to power in 2014, harassment has increased, as have the sums demanded. This has the effect of driving businesses out of business and sex workers to the street or internet as freelancers.

==Crime==

===Child prostitution===

The exact number of child-prostitutes in Thailand is not known. According to the US-based research institute “Protection Project”, estimates of the number of children involved in prostitution living in Thailand ranges from 12,000 to the hundreds of thousands (ECPAT International). The government, university researchers, and NGOs estimated that there are as many as 30,000 to 40,000 prostitutes under 18 years of age, not including foreign migrants (US Department of State, 2005b). Thailand’s Health System Research Institute estimates that children in prostitution make up 40% of prostitutes in Thailand.

The reasons why and how children are commercially sexually exploited by include:
*Poverty: a high proportion of the population lives in poverty.
*Ethnic hill tribe children: these children live in the border region of northern Thailand. They suffer from disproportionate levels of poverty in relation to the general population and most of them lack citizenship cards. This means that they do not have access to health care or primary school, which limits their further education or employment opportunities.
*Trafficked children: Many children are trafficked into or within the country through criminal networks, acquaintances, former trafficking victims and border police and immigration officials who transport them to brothels across Thailand.
*Sense of duty: According to traditional customs, the first duty of a girl is to support her family in any way she can. Due to this sense of duty and to pay off family debts, many girls have been forced into prostitution.

Children are exploited in sex establishments and are also approached directly in the street by paedophiles seeking sexual contact. Child sex tourism is a serious problem in the country. Thailand, along with Cambodia, India, Brazil and Mexico, has been identified as a leading hotspot of child sexual exploitation. Paedophiles, in particular, exploit the lax laws of the country and attempt to find cover to avoid prosecution.

To discourage child sex tourism, the government reported it denied entry to 74 known foreign sex offenders in 2017. The government has developed and launched a video to be shown on flights entering Thailand discouraging sex tourism. The Ministry of Tourism distributed more than 315,000 brochures discouraging sex tourism to businesses and tourism professionals and organized trainings for 800 local government officials, tourism sector workers, students, youth, and civil society organizations on prevention of child sexual exploitation in the tourism industry.

===Sex trafficking===

Thailand is a source, destination, and transit country for men, women, and children subjected to sex trafficking. Thailand’s commercial sex industry remains vast, increasing vulnerabilities for sex trafficking. Women, men, boys, and girls from Thailand, other Southeast Asian countries, Sri Lanka, Russia, Uzbekistan, and some African countries are subjected to sex trafficking in Thailand. Thailand is also a transit country for victims from Mainland China, North Korea, Vietnam, Bangladesh, India, and Burma subjected to sex trafficking in countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Russia, South Korea, the United States, and countries in Western Europe. Thai nationals are subjected to sex trafficking in Thailand and in countries in North America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.

Women of Thai and other nationalities have been lured to Japan and sold to yakuza-controlled brothels, where they are forced to work off financial debt. It is easy to lure these women from neighboring countries because Thailand has 56 unofficial crossover points and 300 checkpoints, where people can cross the border without paperwork. In a landmark case in 2006, one such woman, Urairat Soimee, filed a civil suit in Thailand against the Thai perpetrators, who had previously been convicted in a criminal court. The woman had managed to escape from the yakuza-controlled prostitution ring by killing the female Thai mama-san and spent five years in a Japanese prison.

The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons in its 2018 U.S. Trafficking in Persons report considered Thailand to be a Tier 2 country, meaning the report states that although the Government of Thailand does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking, it is making significant efforts to do so.

Thailand has enacted several laws against human trafficking. These include the 2008 Anti Trafficking in Persons Act, the 1997 Anti Trafficking Act. Thailand has also entered into regional agreements against human trafficking, including The Coordinated Mekong Ministerial Initiative against Trafficking. Thai sex worker organization EMPOWER has expressed several concerns about the 2008 law. These concerns include that the law authorizes police to enter alleged sex establishments without a warrant, the lack of social assistance provided to victims, involutary repatriations, and the resulting division between NGOs which claim to oppose sex trafficking and those which support sex workers themselves. Sex worker organizations in Thailand have strongly opposed &quot;rescue&quot; operations which result in adults who freely entered the sex industry being arrested, denied a livelihood, or subject to deportation.

A sex trafficking gang was intercepted in the southern city of Pattaya in October 2014.

In 2017, Ministry of the Interior and Ministry of Justice inspected 11,268 “high-risk” adult entertainment venues and ordered 268 to cease business activities for five years; these inspections led to the prosecution of eight trafficking cases. Corruption continues to undermine anti-trafficking efforts. Some government officials are directly complicit in trafficking crimes, including through accepting bribes or loans from business owners and brothels where victims are exploited. Credible reports indicate some corrupt officials protect brothels and other commercial sex venues from raids and inspections and collude with traffickers.

==Support organisations for sex workers==
Several support organisations for sex workers exist in Thailand:

* EMPOWER is a Thai NGO that offers health, educational and counseling services to female sex workers. The organisation seeks to empower sex workers and has been operating since 1985, with offices in Patpong (Bangkok), Chiang Mai, Mae Sai and Patong Beach (Phuket). The organization also operates a museum of sex work in Bangkok and a cooperatively owned bar in Chiang Mai.
* SWING (Service Workers in Group) is an offshoot of EMPOWER, offering support to male and female sex workers in Patpong and Pattaya. It offers English classes, teaches safe sex education, distributes condoms, and promotes health and safety with an in-house gym and discounted medical examinations. The newly formed organisation SISTERS works with transgender sex workers in Bangkok and Pattaya. On 18 July 2024, the SWING Foundation submitted a proposal backed by 14,484 voters to repeal Thailand’s 1996 Prevention and Suppression of Prostitution Act in July. The proposal argues that the law, unchanged for 28 years, criminalizes sex work, pushing it underground while depriving workers of labor protections and healthcare and subsequently contributing to human trafficking. 
* M Plus is an organization for male sex workers in Chiang Mai, including men who identify as gay, straight or transgender. It operates a health clinic for sex workers and conducts HIV prevention and prophylaxis education.
* The Asia Pacific Network of Sex Workers (APNSW) is a regional organization, headquartered in Thailand, of sex worker-led organizations. It exists to promote and protect the health and human rights of sex workers in Asia. It supports the full decriminalization of sex work and the recognition of sex work as work.

<doc id="1309798" wikidata="Q2502155" url="?curid=1309798" title="Copper Scroll">
<text>The Copper Scroll (3Q15) is one of the Dead Sea Scrolls found in Cave 3 near Khirbet Qumran, but differs significantly from the others. Whereas the other scrolls are written on parchment or papyrus, this scroll is written on metal: copper mixed with about 1 percent tin, although no metallic copper remained in the strips; the action of the centuries had been to convert the metal into brittle oxide. The so-called &#x27;scrolls&#x27; of copper were, in reality, two separated sections of what was originally a single scroll about in length. Unlike the others, it is not a literary work, but a list of 64 places where various items of gold and silver were buried or hidden. It differs from the other scrolls in its Hebrew (closer to the language of the Mishnah than to the literary Hebrew of the other scrolls, though 4QMMT shares some language characteristics), its orthography, palaeography (forms of letters) and date (, possibly overlapping with the latest of the other Qumran manuscripts).

Since 2013, the Copper Scroll has been on display at the newly opened Jordan Museum in Amman after being moved from its previous home, the Jordan Archaeological Museum on Amman&#x27;s Citadel Hill.

A new facsimile of the Copper Scroll by Facsimile Editions of London was announced as being in production in 2014.

==History==
While most of the Dead Sea Scrolls were found by Bedouins, the Copper Scroll was discovered by an archaeologist. The scroll, on two rolls of copper, was found on March 14, 1952 at the back of Cave 3 at Qumran. It was the last of 15 scrolls discovered in the cave, and is thus referred to as 3Q15. The corroded metal could not be unrolled by conventional means and so the Jordanian government sent it to Manchester University&#x27;s College of Technology in England on the recommendation of English archaeologist and Dead Sea Scrolls scholar John Marco Allegro for it to be cut into sections, allowing the text to be read. He arranged for the university&#x27;s Professor H. Wright Baker to cut the sheets into 23 strips in 1955 and 1956. It then became clear that the rolls were part of the same document. Allegro, who had supervised the opening of the scroll, transcribed its contents immediately.

The first editor assigned for the transcribed text was Józef Milik. He initially believed that the scroll was a product of the Essenes but noted that it was likely not an official work of theirs. At first, he believed that it was not an actual historical account; he believed it was that of folklore. Later however, Milik&#x27;s view changed. Since there was no indication that the scroll was a product of the Essenes from the Qumran community, he changed his identification of the scroll. He now believes that the scroll was separate from the community, although it was found at Qumran in Cave 3, it was found further back in the cave, away from the other scrolls. As a result, he suggested the Copper Scroll was a separate deposit, separated by a &quot;lapse in time.&quot;

Although the text was assigned to Milik, in 1957 the Jordanian Director of Antiquities approached Allegro to publish the text. After a second approach by a new director of Jordanian Antiquities, Allegro, who had waited for signs of Milik of moving to publish, took up the second request and published an edition with translation and hand-drawn transcriptions from the original copper segments in 1960. Milik published his official edition in 1962, also with hand-drawn transcriptions, though the accompanying black-and-white photographs were &quot;virtually illegible&quot;. The scroll was re-photographed in 1988 with greater precision. From 1994 to 1996, extensive conservation efforts by Electricité de France (EDF) included evaluation of corrosion, photography, x-rays, cleaning, making a facsimile and a drawing of the letters. Emile Puech&#x27;s edition had the benefit of these results.

===Dating===
Scholarly estimates of the probable date range of the Copper Scroll vary. Frank Moore Cross proposed the period of 25–75 CE on palaeographical grounds, while William F. Albright suggested 70–135 CE. Manfred Lehmann put forward a similar date range to Albright, arguing that the treasure was principally the money accumulated between the First Jewish–Roman War and the Bar Kokhba revolt, while the temple lay in ruins. P. Kyle McCarter Jr., Albert M. Wolters, David Wilmot and Judah Lefkovits all agree that the scroll originated around 70 CE. Contrarily, Emile Puech argues that the Copper Scroll could not have been deposited behind 40 jars after they were already in place, so the scroll &quot;predates 68 CE.&quot;

Józef Milik proposed that the scroll was written around 100 CE. If this dating is correct, it would mean that the scroll did not come from the Qumran community because the settlement had been destroyed by the Romans decades earlier.

===Language and writing style===
The style of writing is unusual, different from the other scrolls. It is written in a style similar to Mishnaic Hebrew. While Hebrew is a well-known language, the majority of ancient Hebrew text in which the language is studied is generally biblical in nature, which the Copper Scroll is not. As a result, &quot;most of the vocabulary is simply not found in the Bible or anything else we have from ancient times.&quot; The orthography is unusual, the script having features resulting from being written on copper with hammer and chisel. There is also the anomaly that seven of the location names are followed by a group of two or three Greek letters, thought by some to represent numerical values. Also, the &quot;clauses&quot; within the scroll mark intriguing parallels to that of Greek inventories, from the Greek temple of Apollo. This similarity to the Greek inventories, would suggest that scroll is in fact an authentic &quot;temple inventory.&quot;

Some scholars believe that the difficulty in deciphering the text is perhaps due to it having been copied from another original document by an illiterate scribe who did not speak the language in which the scroll was written, or at least was not well familiar. As Milik puts it, the scribe &quot;uses the forms and ligature of the cursive script along with formal letters, and often confuses graphically several letters of the formal hand.&quot; As a result, it has made translation and understanding of the text difficult.

==Contents==
The text is an inventory of 64 locations; 63 of which are treasures of gold and silver, which have been estimated in the tons. For example, one single location described on the copper scroll describes 900 talents (30.05 tons/ 868,000 troy ounces) of buried silver. Tithing vessels are also listed among the entries, along with other vessels, and three locations featured scrolls. One entry apparently mentions priestly vestments. The final listing points to a duplicate document with additional details. That other document has not been found.

The following English translation of the opening lines of the first column of the Copper Scroll shows the basic structure of each of the entries in the scroll. The structure is 1) general location, 2) specific location, often with distance to dig, and 3) what to find.

&lt;poem&gt;
:1:1 In the ruin that is in the valley of Acor, under
:1:2 the steps, with the entrance at the East,
:1:3 a distance of forty cubits: a strongbox of silver and its vessels
:1:4 with a weight of seventeen talents. &lt;/poem&gt;

There is a minority view that the Cave of Letters might have contained one of the listed treasures, and, if so, artifacts from this location may have been recovered. Although the scroll was made of alloyed copper in order to last, the locations are written as if the reader would have an intimate knowledge of obscure references. For example, consider column two, verses 1–3, &quot;In the salt pit that is under the steps: forty-one talents of silver. In the cave of the old washer&#x27;s chamber, on the third terrace: sixty-five ingots of gold.&quot; As noted above, the listed treasure has been estimated in the tons. There are those who understand the text to be enumerating the vast treasure that was &#x27;stashed,&#x27; where the Romans could not find it. Others still suggest that the listed treasure is that which Bar Kokhba hid during the Second Revolt. Although it is difficult to estimate the exact amount, &quot;it was estimated in 1960 that the total would top $1,000,000 U.S.&quot;

===Selected excerpts===
According to Eusebius&#x27; , &quot;Achor&quot; – perhaps being a reference to an ancient town - is located to the north of Jericho. However, in relation to the &quot;Valley of Achor&quot;, Eusebius&#x27; view is rejected by most historical geographers, who place the &quot;Valley of Achor&quot; to the south of Jericho, either at the modern el-Buqei&#x27;ah, or at Wâdi en-Nu&#x27;eimeh. Elsewhere, Eusebius places Emekachor (the Valley of Achor) near Galgal. The &quot;ruin in the valley of Achor&quot; could be one of a number of sites: the ancient Beth-ḥagla, or what is also known as the &quot;threshing floor of the Aṭad&quot;, the most famous of all the ruins associated with the nation of Israel and being about two miles from the Jordan River, or else the ancient Beth Arabah, and which John Marco Allegro proposed to be identified with &#x27;Ain Gharabah, while Robertson Smith proposed that it be identified with the modern &#x27;Ain al-Feshkha, or else Khirbet es-Sŭmrah, or Khirbet Qumrân. Another ruin at that time was the fortress Hyrcania, which had been destroyed some years earlier.

The Hebrew word , translated here as &quot;brick tiles&quot;, is used also in the Babylonian Talmud () 16b and 3b. The Hebrew word for &quot;talents&quot; is (). The weight of a talent varied with time and place. Amongst Jews in the early 2nd century CE, the was synonymous with the word , a unit of weight that exceeds all others, divided equally into 100 parts. According to Epiphanius of Salamis, the (), a Latin loanword used in Hebrew classical sources for the biblical talent (), is said to have been a weight corresponding to 100 Roman . The Hebrew word used for &quot;chest&quot; is , a word found in Mishnah 15:1, ibid. 18:1, 6:5, and explained by Hai Gaon in Mishnah 22:8 as meaning &quot;an [ornamental] chest or trunk.&quot;

There were several monuments of renown during the waning years of the Second Temple: that of Queen Helena, that of Yoḥanan the High Priest, both of which were in Jerusalem, or else outside the walls of the ancient Old City, etc. The Hebrew word used for &quot;burial monument&quot; is (), which same word appears in Mishnah 2:5; 7:1, and 5:1, and which Talmudic exegete Hai Gaon explained as meaning &quot;the building built over the grave; the same marker being a .&quot; The Hebrew word for &quot;ingots&quot; is (), its only equivalent found in Mishnah 11:3, and in Ezekiel 27:19, and which has the general meaning of &quot;gold in its rawest form; an unshaped mass.&quot; Since no location is mentioned, most scholars think that this is a continuation of the previous section.

The Hebrew word is taken from the Greek word , meaning, &quot;peristyle,&quot; a row of columns surrounding a space within a building. The word variantly read as (, meaning &quot;sand&quot;) or (, meaning &quot;small hole in the slab of stone that is laid over the mouth of a cistern&quot;), is - in the latter case - a word found in 3b and 16a. The Hebrew word, as explained by Maimonides in his Judeo-Arabic Commentary of the Mishnah ( 11:2), connotes in Arabic, – meaning, the round stone slab laid upon the cistern&#x27;s mouth with a hole in the middle of the stone. Since no specific location is mentioned, this section is thought to be a continuation of the previous two sections. Allegro surmised that this place may have been Khirbet Qumrân, where archaeologists have uncovered a watchtower, a water aqueduct, a conduit, and a very noticeable earthquake fissure which runs right through a large reservoir, besides also two courtyards, one of which containing a cistern.

The place-name Kuḥlith is mentioned in the Babylonian Talmud 66a, being one of the towns in &quot;the wilderness&quot; that was conquered by Alexander Jannaeus (Yannai), whose military exploits are mentioned by Josephus in his &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; (13.13.3–13.15.5). Its identification remains unknown, although Israeli archaeologist Boaz Zissu suggests that it is to be sought after in the Desert of Samaria. For other scholarly identifications of Kuḥlith, see Joshua Efron, &quot;Studies on the Hasmonean Period&quot; (&quot;SJLA&quot; 39; Leiden: Brill, 1987), p. 178. 

Libation vessels, (, , has the connotation of empty libation vessels that were once used to contain either vintage wine or olive oil, and given either to the priests or used in the Temple service, but which same produce was inadvertently mixed with common produce, and which rendered the whole unfit for the priests&#x27; consumption. The vessels themselves, however, remained in a state of ritual cleanness (Cf. Maimonides, &quot;Commentary on the Mishnah&quot;, 3:2; 3:4). The word () is a Greek loanword that found its way into the Hebrew language, derived from the Greek , and meaning simply an earthenware jar with handles. It is used in Mishnah 20:2, 5:5, 10:2, 4:4, &quot;et al&quot;. As for the word , it has been suggested that the word is a corruption of , meaning &quot;new vessels,&quot; just as it appears in Mishnah 2:1, and explained in 24a. If so, it is a loanword derived from the Greek . The word may variantly be explained as &quot;covered with ash.&quot; Others read the same text as a corruption of , &quot;ephods&quot;. Though inconclusive, the idea of covering over such vessels with ashes was perhaps to distinguish these vessels from the others, so that the priests will not inadvertently eat of such produce, similar to the marking of a Fourth-year vineyard with clods of earth during the Seventh Year, so as not to cause unsuspecting people to transgress by eating forbidden produce when, normally, during that same year, all fruits that are grown become ownerless property.

In old Jewish parlance, as late as the Geonic period, the Hebrew word (, lit. &quot;cave&quot;) signified a burial cave. Its linguistic use here, which is written in the construct state, i.e. &quot;burial cave of…&quot;, points to that of a known place, Beit Ḥemdah (variant reading: Beit Hamara). The burial cave has yet to be identified. By &quot;golden ingots&quot; is meant &quot;gold in its rawest form; an unshaped mass.&quot;

The &quot;Eastern Gate&quot; may be referring to what is now called the Golden Gate, a gate leading into the Temple Mount enclosure (cf. Mishnah, 1:3), or it may be referring to the Eastern Gate, also known as the Nicanor Gate (and which some scholars hold to be the same as the &quot;Corinthian gate&quot; described by Josephus, and alluded to in his &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot;), in the Inner Court of the Temple precincts (cf. Mishnah, 9:5).

In either case, the cistern was located on the Temple Mount, at a distance of 19 cubits from the gate (approximately 10 meters). The cistern may have been in disuse and was most-likely filled-in with stones and sealed. At present, there is no cistern shown at that distance from the Golden Gate on the maps listing the cisterns of the Temple Mount, which suggests that the cistern may have been concealed from view by filling it in with earth and stones. In contrast, if the sense is to the Nicanor Gate (which has since been destroyed), the cistern would have been that which is now called Bir er-rummâneh (, &quot;the Pomegranate well&quot;), being a large cistern situated on the southeast platform (nave) of the Dome of the Rock, measuring and having a depth of , based on its proximity to the place where the Inner Court and its Eastern Gate once stood. The cistern, one of many in the Temple Mount, is still used today for storing water, and which Claude R. Conder and Conrad Schick connected with the &quot;Water Gate&quot; of the Inner Court mentioned in Mishnah 1:4. Entrance to the cistern is from its far eastern side, where there is a flight of stairs descending in a southerly direction. By &quot;channel&quot; () is meant the conduit that directs water into the cistern. Both Charles Warren and Conder noted the presence of a channel below the present surface layer of the Temple Mount, and which leads to the cistern now known as Bir el Warakah, situated beneath the Al-Aqsa mosque, and which discovery suggests that the channel in question has been covered over by the current pavement. The end of the entry is marked by two Greek letters, (.

The term &quot;the two houses&quot; used here is unclear; it can be surmised that it may have meant an exact place between the two most famous towns that begin with the name &quot;Beit&quot;, Beit Arabah and Beit-ḥagla. Both ancient places are in the Valley of Achor. Alternatively, Bethabara may have been intended as one of the &quot;houses&quot;. The word that is used for &quot;pots&quot; (, ) is the same word used in the Aramaic Targum for &#x27;pots&#x27;.

A description of the ancient aqueducts near Jericho is brought down in Conder&#x27;s and Herbert Kitchener&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; (&quot;&quot;, vol. 3, pp. 206–207). According to them, the natives knew of no such aqueducts south of Rujm el-Mogheifir. According to Lurie, the largest riverine gulch near Jericho with an aqueduct was Wadi Qelt (Wadi el Kelt), and which ran in an eastward direction, passing near Khirbet Kâkûn, whence it went down southwards about towards the end of Wadi Sŭweid. Since the &quot;head of the aqueduct&quot; is mentioned, the sense here could imply the beginning of the aqueduct, which former takes its source from &#x27;Ain Farah, &#x27;Ain Qelt and &#x27;Ain Fawâr and their surroundings, between Jerusalem and Jericho. Conversely, the reference may have been to one of two other aqueducts built during the Second Temple period (and subsequently refurbished) and which take their beginnings from a water source at &#x27;Ain el Aûjah (&quot;the crooked spring&quot;), the one termed Ḳanât el Manîl (&quot;the canal of el Manil&quot;) which bears east towards an outlet in the Jordan valley north of Jericho, and the other termed Ḳanât Far&#x27;ûn (&quot;Pharaoh&#x27;s canal&quot;). Though inconclusive, the town of Sekhahka is thought by some scholars to be Khirbet Qumrân, which, too, had an aqueduct.

The riverine gulch () that was once called Ha-Kafa has yet to be identified with complete certainty. The town Sekhakha, mentioned first in Joshua 15:61 and belonging to the tribe of Judah, also remains unidentified, although the Israeli Government Naming Committee has named a watercourse that rises from Khirbet es-Sumra and connects with Wadi Qumrân after its namesake. Scholars have suggested that Khirbet Qumrân is to be identified with the biblical Sekhakha.

Although the text is partially defaced, scholars have reconstructed it. The Hebrew word (, most likely used here in its most common sense, lit. &quot;cave&quot;) is called here the &quot;Cave of the Column&quot;, being a column that was well-known. The Hebrew word for &quot;column&quot; () has not changed over the years, and is the same word used to describe a Gate of Jerusalem&#x27;s Old City which stood in Roman times, although a newer Gate is now built above it with the same Arabic name, Bāb al-&#x27;Amoud (Damascus Gate), and which, according to Arabic legend/tradition, was called such in reference to a high black marble column, which was allegedly placed in the inner courtyard of the door in the Roman and Byzantine period. The 6th-century Madaba Map depicts in it artistic vignettes, showing what appears to be a black column directly within the one northern gate of the walled city. Both the old Roman Gate at Damascus Gate and Zedekiah&#x27;s Cave are on the north-west side of the city. Although inconclusive, the cave that is referenced here may have actually been Zedekiah&#x27;s Cave (a misnomer, being merely a meleke limestone quarry thought to have been used by Herod the Great), and may have been called such because of its proximity to the black marble column. Others, however, date the erection of this black marble column in that gate to Hadrian, when he named the city Aelia Capitolina. Nevertheless, the same cave is also known to have pillars (columns) that project from some of the rock to support a ceiling. Today, Zedekiah&#x27;s Cave lies between Damascus Gate and Herod&#x27;s Gate, or precisely, some to the left of Damascus Gate as one enters the Old City. The cave descends to a depth of below the Old City, opening into a large antechamber, which is divided further on between two primary passageways. The leftmost passageway when entering the cave is the entranceway that faces &quot;north&quot; and which opens into a small recess. The identification here remains highly speculative, as Conder and Kitchener in their &quot;&quot; also mention another place bearing the name Mŭghâret Umm el &#x27;Amûd (Cave of the Pillars), along the south bank of Wadi Far&#x27;ah. The Hebrew word for &quot;jar&quot; is (), and which Hai Gaon explains as meaning: &quot;like unto a cask or jar that is wide [at its brim].&quot; Such jars were, most-likely, made of stone, since they were also used to contain the ashes of the Red Heifer and which vessels could not contract uncleanness.

Line 27 speaks about a queen (), rather than a king (). It is uncertain which queen is here intended, but the most notable of queens amongst the Jewish people during the late Second Temple period, and who had a palace built in Jerusalem, in the middle of the residential area known as Acra, was Queen Helena of Adiabene. The historian Josephus mentions this queen and her palace, &quot;the palace of queen Helena,&quot; in his work &quot;The Jewish War&quot; (6.6.3.). The Hebrew word used here for &quot;palace&quot; is (), literally meaning &quot;dwelling place&quot;. Allegro incorrectly interpreted the word to mean &quot;tomb,&quot; thinking it to be the queen&#x27;s burial place. As for the precise number of talents, Allegro, in his revised edition, reads there 7½, instead of 27, because of the unusual shape of the last numerical character. In 2007, a structure believed to be Queen Helena&#x27;s palace in the &quot;Lower City&quot; (Acra) of Jerusalem was partially excavated by a team under Israeli archaeologist Doron Ben-Ami, but due to safety issues it was not possible to dig to the depth in question. 

The ancient site of Dok is generally accepted to be the fortress Dok or Duq, mentioned in the First Book of Maccabees, and which same name appears as Dagon in Josephus&#x27; &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; (xiii, viii, 1), and in his book &quot;The Jewish War&quot; (i, ii, 3). Today, the site is more commonly known by its Arabic name, Jabal al-Quruntul, located about west of Jericho and rising to an elevation of above the level of the plain east of it. The site has been built and destroyed several times. In the year 340 CE, a Byzantine monastery named Duqa was built on the ruins of the old site, but it too was destroyed and has remained in ruins ever since. According to Lurie, a town by the same name has existed at the foothills of the mountain, built alongside a natural spring. Today, the site is known as Duyuk and is located roughly north of Jericho.

The location of the Kuzeiba has yet to be positively identified, although there exists an ancient site by its name, now known as Khŭrbet Kûeizîba, a ruin that is described by Conder and Kitchener in &#x27; &#x27; (vol. 3), a place situated to the south of Beit Fajjar and north of Siaîr, almost in their middle. A natural spring called &#x27;Ain Kûeizîba is located nearby on the north-east side of the ruin.

The Kidron valley extends from Jerusalem to the Dead Sea, and its banks become more precipitous, in some places, as it progresses. The Hebrew word designating &quot;heap of stones&quot; is (singular) and happens to be same word used by Jonathan ben Uzziel in his Aramaic Targum of Jeremiah 51:37, (plural).

The sense of &quot;mouth of the ravine&quot; () is generally understood to be the edge of a ravine. Beth-tamar has yet to be identified; although, in the days of Eusebius and Jerome, there was still a place by the name of Beththamar in the vicinity of Gaba, and which name was originally associated with Baal-tamar of Judges 20:33. To this present day, towards the east of Gaba, there are still precipitous cliffs and a number of ancient sites (now ruins), one of which may have once borne the name Beth-tamar. Félix-Marie Abel thought to place Beth-tamar at Râs eṭ-Ṭawîl (grid position 172/137 PAL), a summit to the northeast of Tell el-Ful. Others suggest that Beth-tamar is to be sought after around Jericho and Naaran, north of Jabal Kuruntul.

It is to be noted that the old Aramaic Targum on Judges 20:33 translates Baal-tamar as &quot;the plains of Jericho&quot;. The Hebrew word has been translated here as &quot;labourer,&quot; based on the cognate Hebrew-Aramaic-Arabic languages and the Hebrew linguistic tradition of sometimes interchanging () with (), as in and in , 103a (see on 2 Chronicles 33:13; , sec. 30; Jerusalem Talmud, 10:2). The word () in Aramaic/Syriac has the connotation of &quot;a worker; a labourer; an artisan; a husbandman; a vine-dresser; a soldier.&quot; Lurie understood the same word as meaning &quot;small&quot;, as in &quot;the small dale&quot;. The word for &quot;things consecrated&quot; is and has the general connotation of things dedicated to the Temple, for which there is a penalty of death for one who committed sacrilege on these objects. An unspecified consecrated object belongs to the priests of Aaron&#x27;s lineage, while consecrated things given to the Temple&#x27;s upkeep () are not the property of the priests.

In the Land of Israel, dovecotes (columbariums) were usually constructed in wide, underground pits or caves with an air opening at the top, with geometric compartments for nesting pigeons built into the inner-walls and plastered over with lime. These were almost always built at a distance outside the city, in this case near the walled citadel or fort of Nabaḥ, a place that has yet to be identified. In Tosefta ( 9:3), it is mentioned that, during the Second Temple period, fledglings of pigeons (presumably raised in dovecotes) were principally brought from the King&#x27;s Mountain, meaning, from the mountainous regions of Judea and Samaria.

Cisterns were large, bottle-shaped underground storage facilities usually carved out of the limestone and used to store water. The large riverine brook can be almost any large gully or gorge () that drained the run-off winter rains into a lower region. The largest riverine brook nearest Jerusalem is Wadi Qelt, formerly known as Wadi Faran. The impression here is of a place that branches off from a larger brook, and where there are several irrigation channels that pass through it. Gustaf Dalman mentions several riverine brooks flowing, both, eastward and westward towards the Jordan River valley and irrigating large tracts of land along the Jordan valley. The nearest place to Jerusalem that meets this description is the area known as the King&#x27;s Garden, on the southern extremity of the City of David, where is the confluence of the Kidron Valley with a dale known as the Tyropoeon.

French scholar A. Neubauer, citing the Church Father Jerome, writes that from Bethlehem one could see Bethacharma, thought to be the Beit HaKerem of Jeremiah, and what is widely thought to have been near to Tekoa. Conder and Kitchener, however, both from the Palestine Exploration Fund, surmised that the site of Beth-haccerem was probably to be identified with &#x27;Ain Kârim. The Mishnah (compiled in 189 CE), often mentions Beit ha-kerem in relation to its valley, &quot;the valley of Beit ha-kerem.&quot; Today, the ancient site&#x27;s identification remains disputed.

The Hebrew word () denotes the &quot;lower millstone&quot; used in a stationary olive press. Its usage is found throughout the Mishnah. &quot;Dale of the Olive&quot; (, , the word meaning &quot;olive&quot;) being written here in defective scriptum. Other texts write instead of . Allegro was uncertain of its reading. Although there may have been several places by the name Gei Zayt in the 1st century CE, until the early 20th century, there still existed a place by this name in its Arabic form, &quot;Khallat ez-Zeitūna,&quot; meaning, the &quot;Dale of Olives,&quot; and it can only be surmised whether or not the Arabic name has preserved the original representation of the older Hebrew appellation, as there were likely other dales bearing the same name. &quot;Khallat ez-Zeitūna&quot; is shown on one of the old British Mandate maps of the region and is located on the extreme eastern end of the Valley of Elah, where the western edge of the dale exits into the valley. Today, it is a narrow strip of farm land, flanked on both sides by hills, situated on the left-hand side of Moshav Aviezer as one enters the Moshav. Others read the text as &quot;Dale of Provisions&quot;. The &quot;black stones&quot; are thought to be either basalt stones, which were carried there from far off, or &quot;stones of bitumen.&quot;

According to Josephus (&quot;Antiquities&quot; 8.1.3.), Zadok was the first high priest during the reign of King David, and he continued to officiate in the Temple during Solomon&#x27;s reign. The walled city of Jerusalem, at that time, occupied the site of the City of David. Since the burial custom of Israel was to bury outside the walls of the city, this would most-likely place the tomb of Zadok in or near the Kidron Valley, and perhaps even in the Tyropoeon Valley which, some years later, was incorporated within the city walls when it was encompassed by a wall (making it now a built-up area), or else in the Valley of Hinnom (&quot;Wadi er-Rababi&quot;), to the southwest of the City of David. The Hebrew word used for &quot;stone-bench projecting from the wall&quot; is &quot;esṭān&quot;, a variant spelling of (), which same word appears in the Babylonian Talmud (&quot;Kiddushin&quot; 70a) as , explained there as a scholium, meaning &quot;a bench,&quot; but of the kind traditionally made to project from a wall. After the words &quot;libation vessels,&quot; the Hebrew word &quot;sūḥ&quot; appears, and which Lurie believes refers to defiled things by reason of the images of the rulers (hence: ) embossed on the coins offered to the Temple treasury. The word &quot;sūḥ&quot; is derived from Isaiah 5:25, s.v. . Milik, however, read the same word as &quot;sūth&quot; (), which Hebrew word is used in Genesis 49:11 to denote &quot;clothing&quot; or a &quot;garment.&quot; The remainder of the text is illegible in its current form. The second word, &quot;senaḥ&quot; (variant: &quot;senat&quot;) is left by Lurie without an explanation.

The words &quot;subterranean shaft&quot; () appear under their Hebrew name in the Mishnah ( 3:3 and 3:3) and Talmud ( 48b), and where one of which was built near the sacrificial altar on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, down which flowed the blood and drink libations. The Hebrew word (meaning &quot;their measures&quot;) is derived from the Aramaic word , being a translation of the Hebrew in Exodus 26:8, among other places.

==Claims==

The treasure of the scroll has been assumed to be treasure of the Jewish Temple, presumably the Second Temple, among other options.

The theories of the origin of the treasure were broken down by Theodor H. Gaster:
* First, the treasure could be that of the Qumran community. The difficulty here is that the community is assumed to be an ascetic brotherhood, with which vast treasures are difficult to reconcile. (Yet community, as opposed to individual, wealth for a future hoped-for temple is possible. Such is proposed by, among others, André Dupont-Sommer, Stephen Goranson, and Emile Puech.)
* Second, the treasure could be that of the Second Temple. However, Gaster cites Josephus as stating that the main treasure of the Temple was still in the building when it fell to the Romans, and also that other Qumranic texts appear to be too critical of the priesthood of the Temple for their authors to have been close enough to take away their treasures for safekeeping. (The Arch of Titus shows some Temple items taken to Rome.)
* Third, the treasure could be that of the First Temple, destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, in 586 BCE. This would not seem to fit with the character of the other scrolls, unless perhaps the scroll was left in a cave during the Babylonian Exile, possibly with a small community of caretakers who were precursors of the Dead Sea Scrolls community. (The scroll was written too late for this proposal.)
* Fourth, Gaster&#x27;s own favourite theory is that the treasure is a hoax.

There are other options besides those listed by Gaster. For instance, Manfred Lehmann considered it Temple contributions collected after 70 CE.

Scholars are divided as to what the actual contents are. However, metals such as copper and bronze were a common material for archival records. Along with this, &quot;formal characteristics&quot; establish a &quot;line of evidence&quot; that suggest this scroll is an authentic &quot;administrative document of Herod&#x27;s Temple in Jerusalem.&quot; As a result, this evidence has led a number of people to believe that the treasure really does exist. One such person is John Allegro, who in 1962 led an expedition. By following some of the places listed in the scroll, the team excavated some potential burial places for the treasure. However, the treasure hunters turned up empty handed, and any treasure is yet to be found.

Even if none of the treasures come to light, 3Q15, as a new, long ancient Hebrew text, has significance; for instance, as comparative Semitic languages scholar Jonas C. Greenfield noted, it has great significance for lexicography.

It is more than plausible that the Romans discovered the treasure. Perhaps, when the temple of Herod was destroyed, the Romans went looking for any treasure and riches the temple may have had in its possession. The Romans might easily have acquired some or all of the treasure listed in the Copper Scroll by interrogating and torturing captives, which was normal practice. According to Josephus, the Romans had an active policy regarding the retrieval of hidden treasure.

Another theory is that, after the Roman army departed, Jewish people used the Copper Scroll to retrieve the valuables listed, and spent the valuables on rebuilding Jerusalem.

==Media==

* &quot;A Long Way to Shiloh&quot; (known as &quot;The Menorah Men&quot; in the US) is a thriller by Lionel Davidson, published in 1966, whose plot follows the finding and contents of a similar treasure scroll.
* The denouement of Edwin Black&#x27;s &quot;Format C:&quot; included using the Copper Scroll to find the Silver Scroll, giving the protagonists the information they needed to find and defeat the main threat of the book.
* The Copper Scroll is the subject of a political thriller, &quot;The Copper Scroll&quot;, by Joel C. Rosenberg, published in 2006. The book uses Rosenberg&#x27;s theory that the treasures listed in the Copper Scroll (and the Ark of the Covenant) will be found in the End Times to refurnish the Third Temple.
* The Copper Scroll also features in Sean Young&#x27;s historical novel, &quot;Violent Sands&quot;, in which Barabbas is the sworn protector of the Copper Scroll and the treasure it points to.
* The scroll—and a search for its treasures—was featured in a 2007 episode of the History Channel series &quot;Digging for the Truth&quot;. The program gives a basic knowledge of the research of the Copper Scroll and all the major theories of its interpretation.

<doc id="1309813" wikidata="Q7728940" url="?curid=1309813" title="The Dark Frontier">
<text>The Dark Frontier (1936) is Eric Ambler&#x27;s first novel. Based on the development of weaponry in the year 1936, &quot;The Dark Frontier&quot; was one of the first novels to predict the invention of a nuclear bomb and its consequences.

==Background==
He wrote about its genesis thus: &quot;... Became press agent for film star, but soon after joined big London advertising agency as copywriter and &#x27;ideas man&#x27;. During next few years wrote incessantly on variety of subjects ranging from baby food to non-ferrous alloys. Have travelled in most countries of Europe, been stranded in Marseille and nearly drowned in the Bay of Naples. Decided, on a rainy day in Paris, to write a thriller. Result was &quot;The Dark Frontier&quot;.&quot;

==Plot==

The novel is set in 1934 or 1935 in Ixania, a small fictional country somewhere in a mountainous region of the Balkans bordering Romania. There, a peasant revolt succeeds in overthrowing the country&#x27;s dictatorial regime and in establishing freedom and justice for all its citizens. Throughout modern history Ixania, a &quot;God-forsaken country&quot;, has preserved its political independence because of its lack of natural resources and, generally, its comparative irrelevance in economic matters. However, due to the defection from Nazi Germany of Jacob Kassen, a nuclear scientist, the Countess Schverzinski and her brother, Prince Ladislaus, who effectively run the country, are in possession of a formula to build an atomic bomb (the &quot;Kassen secret&quot;), a fact they wish to exploit for their country&#x27;s but also their own personal benefit.

Two groups of people want to prevent exactly that. There is Simon Groom, a representative of Messrs. Cator &amp; Bliss Ltd., a British armament manufacturer, who is sent to Ixania to get hold of the Kassen secret by hook or by crook. He enlists the services of Professor Henry Barstow, an English physicist who is to travel with him to Ixania to determine whether the secret papers whose theft he plans to commission are authentic and worth the money.

However, &quot;Henry Barstow&quot; seems to be a cover name for Conway Carruthers, a Doc Savage-esque adventurer who has realised that the Kassen secret poses &quot;a serious menace to world peace&quot; and who, accordingly, has made it his job to rid the world of that danger by destroying all copies of Kassen&#x27;s papers. His mission is to prevent the manufacture of the bomb and to &quot;preserve civilization&quot;. Carruthers&#x27;s charismatic authority attracts the attention of William L. Casey, an American journalist stationed in Zovgorod, the capital of Ixania. Originally only interested in a good story, Casey becomes Carruthers&#x27;s quasi-assistant, a change Casey himself describes as his &quot;transition from newspaper man to desperado&quot;.

Siding with the peasant revolutionaries, Carruthers becomes the leader of the operation and thus the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the peasants. On several occasions his and Casey&#x27;s lives are in danger, repeatedly they are &quot;standing in front of the wrong end of a gun&quot;, but it is always Carruthers&#x27;s almost superhuman intelligence and skills that save them. Within only one day it turns out that, with the old government having stepped down, the revolution has been both successful and unbloody. Kassen is dead, and all copies of his secret except one have been destroyed. The one copy that has survived is Countess Schverzinski&#x27;s, and she is driving her Mercedes at breakneck speed along a dark and narrow mountain road, with the only intention of fleeing the country. However, Carruthers and Casey are following her in Groom&#x27;s car (which they have stolen), but before they can catch up with her and stop her vehicle she has an accident, is catapulted out of her car, and dies. The wreck of her Mercedes catches fire, so all Carruthers has to do when he arrives at the scene is retrieve the last remaining copy of the bomb-building manual from the Countess&#x27;s body and cast it into the flames.

==Reception==

The novel was one of the first six of Ambler&#x27;s books which made his name. Ambler wrote in his autobiography, &quot;As I saw it, the thriller had nowhere to go but up&quot;.

&quot;The Dark Frontier&quot; parodies the conventions of the contemporary British thriller, particularly E. Phillips Oppenheim and John Buchan, but improves upon them.

<doc id="1309831" wikidata="Q2908764" url="?curid=1309831" title="PeopleMover (Magic Kingdom)">
<text>The PeopleMover is an attraction in Tomorrowland in the Magic Kingdom at the Walt Disney World Resort in Bay Lake, Florida just outside of Orlando, Florida. Designed as an urban mass-transit system of the future, vehicles take passengers on a grand circle tour of the realm of Tomorrowland that provides elevated views of several other attractions.

==Ride experience==

The attraction has a single station, which resides in the center of Rocket Tower Plaza and beneath the Astro Orbiter. Passing the queue, passengers step onto the Speedramp (inclined moving walkway) to the second level. They then step onto a moving platform which matches the speed of the PeopleMover trains, and board before they depart the station.

Leaving the Rocket Tower Plaza Station, the trains make a sharp left turn, followed by a sweeping turn over the plaza. The track then makes a right-hand turn, running along the outside of the northern show building and above the former queue for Stitch&#x27;s Great Escape! and passing by the Tomorrowland main entrance at Central Plaza. The track enters a tunnel through the northern show building and passes a large diorama containing a portion of the Progress City/&quot;Epcot&quot; model, which originally resided in the upper level of the Carousel of Progress at the New York World&#x27;s Fair of 1964-1965 and at Disneyland starting in 1967-1973, before encountering a diorama of two robots and crossing the Star Traders shop.

Leaving the northern show building, the ride passes over the walkway to Fantasyland, the Tomorrowland Speedway, and access to the Tron Lightcycle Power Run. Afterwards, the ride crosses the Walt Disney World Railroad tracks and pass through a switch, which leads to the ride&#x27;s storage and maintenance bays as they make a right turn to enter Space Mountain. Inside Space Mountain, the trains then make a left turn and pass in between the lift hills of the roller coaster tracks. The vehicles then pass two lighted signs reading &quot;Starport: Seven Five&quot; (an oblique reference to the opening year of the attraction), before open space to the left allows a view down into the post-show dioramas. After the view of the post-show, the track makes a right turn, wrapping around the Omega track&#x27;s loading station, and travels along the back side of the building, which is in complete pitch black darkness. It is possible to look up and see the projections from the ride and the tracks. The trains make a sharp S-turn to merge with the storage track, and run along the outside of the building perimeter to return to the railroad bridge. The Space Mountain segment of the PeopleMover has gained heavy notoriety among park guests for offering the only accessible view of Space Mountain when the interior work lights are on. Because the two attractions have separate operating systems, the PeopleMover does not have to stop during Space Mountain breakdowns, so guests riding the PeopleMover when the work lights are on get a rare illuminated look at the roller coaster tracks.

After crossing the railroad tracks again, the trains backtrack to a point above the Tomorrowland Speedway before turning south. After passing over Space Mountain&#x27;s entrance plaza, the former Skyway terminal and the restrooms, the track travels along the exterior of Walt Disney&#x27;s Carousel of Progress, before crossing over the former Galaxy Palace Theater entrance and entering the south show building. Entering the building, guests pass a diorama of a futuristic salon and then get a view down into Buzz Lightyear&#x27;s Space Ranger Spin, similar to the one given of Star Traders. Exiting the tunnel, the ride travels along the side of the south show building, and passing by Main Street U.S.A., the Tomorrowland sign entrance and the Cinderella Castle again, and above the queue line for Monsters, Inc. Laugh Floor, and the queue line for Buzz Lightyear&#x27;s Space Ranger Spin. The ride then returns to Rocket Tower Plaza, where guests disembark and unload.

==History==
===Wedway PeopleMover (1975–1994)===
The Wedway PeopleMover opened on July 1, 1975, based on the PeopleMover attraction at Disneyland in California (WED for Walter Elias Disney). Because the system did not utilize the rotating Goodyear tires used as propulsion in the initial version of the transportation mode, instead relying on Linear induction motors, Goodyear had no involvement in the East Coast version. 

The Edison Electric Institute was the original institutional patron of the attraction. Instead of an open track with covered cars, as designed for Disneyland, the trains were designed were built as open-air cars that traveled under a permanent roof over the guideway. 

The engineering and design of the track itself were also reworked. While Disneyland&#x27;s version regularly changed elevation, especially during the outdoor portions, the version for Walt Disney World was designed to remain at the same elevation from start to finish.

The original narration was provided by longtime Disney announcer, Jack Wagner. In June 1985, his narration was replaced by the voice of ORAC One – &quot;The Commuter Computer&quot; voiced by actor Ronnie Schell, which was used until June 11, 1994, when the attraction received a makeover for the New Tomorrowland. At that time the WEDWay Peoplemover passed through the attractions that occupied Tomorrowland during that time, including Mission to Mars, If You Had Wings, and others. Originally, the tunnel through the south show building (now home to Buzz Lightyear&#x27;s Space Ranger Spin) had three windows; one and two on the trains&#x27; right, three to the trains&#x27; left. This building first housed If You Had Wings, and the windows were carefully placed to look down into the Mexico, Jamaica, and Trinidad show scenes in such a way as to hide all projectors, lights and other show support equipment. When If You Had Wings (renamed If You Could Fly) was closed in January 1989 and remodeled into Delta Dreamflight, the windows no longer lined up correctly with show scenes. The first window was replaced with backlit panels depicting the ride&#x27;s barnstormer scene. Window two looked into the Parisian Excursion scene, from a viewpoint which heavily distorted the tableau&#x27;s forced perspective. The third window would have had riders looking directly into an extremely bright light and so was completely obscured with plywood and black fabric.

===Tomorrowland Transit Authority (1994–2009)===

In the spring of 1994, Tomorrowland underwent a massive refurbishment that changed the theme of the land from being a showcase of future technology to a working city of the future. The WEDway PeopleMover received new physical theming as the track structure along the north and south show buildings as well as Rocket Tower Plaza was updated from smooth Googie-esque white forms to boldly colored metallic structures. The section of track linking the north show building to Space Mountain, and the section from Space Mountain to the Carousel of Progress, which was not changed.
It was during this refurbishment that the attraction&#x27;s name changed from the Wedway PeopleMover to Tomorrowland Transit Authority. A new narration was added, with the tour led by Pete Renaday broadcasting from TTA Central. The new name and narration debuted on June 12, 1994. This 1994 recording remained largely unaltered until October 2, 2009, which came shortly after the ride had reopened following a five-month down period during the refurbishment of Space Mountain.

The TTA&#x27;s backstory in the 1994–2009 version of the ride made reference to the Transit Authority&#x27;s three different &quot;lines&quot;: the Blue Line, the Red Line, and the Green Line. The Blue Line, which constitutes the actual ride, was Tomorrowland&#x27;s intra-city elevated train system. The Red Line took riders &#x27;off-planet&#x27; to other destinations in the galaxy, while the Green Line provided local transportation to Tomorrowland&#x27;s &quot;Hover-Burbs.&quot; There was a diorama of a hub station where all three lines intersect located on the second floor of the north show building (Interplanetary Convention Center). Other services provided by the Transit Authority (interstate highway maintenance and long-distance space travel) were alluded to in the ride&#x27;s narration.

Changes made in the 1994 narration over its 15 years of use included the following:
*The replacement of the narration for the south show building in 1996 when Delta Dreamflight became Take Flight. This narration was replaced again when Take Flight was turned into Buzz Lightyear&#x27;s Space Ranger Spin in 1998.
*The 1994 narration for Space Mountain said, &quot;Now arriving in Space Mountain, Tomorrowland&#x27;s gateway to the Galaxy, Presented by Federal Express,&quot; noting Space Mountain&#x27;s sponsorship by FedEx. When FedEx dropped sponsorship in 2004, the narration was altered to cut off after &quot;Galaxy.&quot;
*A narration was played upon leaving the south show building tunnel mentioning The Timekeeper from 1994 to 2006 when The Timekeeper closed, wherein the narration on the TTA mentioning it was removed.

===Tomorrowland Transit Authority PeopleMover (2009–2022)===
The Tomorrowland Transit Authority closed on April 19, 2009, in line with a major refurbishment of Space Mountain, and reopened on September 12, 2009. The closure was necessary due to extensive construction work planned for the roller coaster, and the inherent safety risks such activity would pose to Transit Authority riders.

During the refurbishment, the beamway was enhanced with new multicolored LED lighting that moves in time with the music being played in Tomorrowland. Other enhancements included freshly re-painted trackway and infrastructure, as well as new speakers for the ride audio system.

On October 2, 2009, the ride received a new narration featuring the voice of Mike Brassell, with safety spiels provided by B. J. Ward, who provided the main narration for Disneyland&#x27;s PeopleMover from 1982 to 1995. The new narration is similar to the original WEDway Peoplemover narration and includes segments introducing all attractions in Tomorrowland, including attractions that had opened after the last update to the narration, such as Buzz Lightyear&#x27;s Space Ranger Spin and the Monsters, Inc. Laugh Floor. The narration also includes brief audio clips from characters represented by the various attractions: Buzz Lightyear can be heard when passing Buzz Lightyear&#x27;s Space Ranger Spin, Roz is heard when passing Monsters, Inc. Laugh Floor, Mickey Mouse can be heard when passing above the Mickey&#x27;s Star Traders store before the rebranding to Star Traders in 2019, and Stitch, also known as &quot;Experiment 626&quot;, was previously heard when passing Stitch&#x27;s Great Escape!. In addition, a female voice paging for Mr. Tom Morrow can be heard shortly after traveling past the lift hill in Space Mountain, which in the 1994 narration happened over Carousel of Progress. The PeopleMover name was revived in the new narration, which refers to the attraction vehicle as the &quot;Tomorrowland Transit Authority PeopleMover,&quot; in place of the previous &quot;TTA Metroliner&quot; name introduced after the attraction&#x27;s 1994 refurbishment.

On August 5, 2010, it was announced that the name &quot;PeopleMover&quot; would officially be re-instated into the ride&#x27;s name, effectively changing it to Tomorrowland Transit Authority PeopleMover. Ride signage was changed around the track to reflect the name change.

On March 12, 2020, it was announced that &quot;Tomorrowland Transit Authority PeopleMover&quot; would close for refurbishment. 

On October 26, 2020, since Walt Disney World reopened after being temporarily closed during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Walt Disney World announced that they once again extended the &quot;Tomorrowland PeopleMover&quot; refurbishment. The refurbishment continues to follow along with the theme park hours posted the furthest into the future, in this case April 4, 2021. On March 31, 2021, Walt Disney World announced yet another extension to the PeopleMover refurbishment, this time set to reopen May 2021. The ride soft-opened on April 25, 2021, and officially reopened the next day.

===PeopleMover (2022–present)===
On July 1, 2022, the narration was updated to feature an entirely new narration by ORAC-5 (a reference to the original narrator character of ORAC One), replacing the narration done by Mike Brassell. The safety spiel was also updated to make references to aliens and other sci-fi tropes. While much of the dialogue is still the same, just with a new voice, the narration now features references to past iterations of the PeopleMover&#x27;s narration, as well as references to defunct rides and attractions from Tomorrowland&#x27;s history, such as If You Had Wings, The Timekeeper, and the song &quot;The Best Time of Your Life&quot; from the 1975 version of The Carousel of Progress. The three-note musical chime heard throughout the 1994-2009 narration has also been restored. There is also narration referencing the new Tron Lightcycle Run. References to Stitch have been removed, as has the cameo by Monster Inc.&#x27;s Roz, with only Buzz Lightyear&#x27;s cameo remaining.

<text>Algoma East was a federal electoral district in Ontario, Canada, that was represented in the House of Commons of Canada from 1904 to 1968. It was created in 1903 from parts of Algoma riding.

It initially consisted of the territorial district of Manitoulin and the part of the territorial district of Algoma lying east of a line drawn from south to north along the limit between the townships of Lefroy and Plummer Additional and due north to the northern limit of Algoma.

In 1904, the territorial district of Manitoulin was transferred out of the riding.

In 1914, it was redefined to consist of the eastern part of the territorial district of Algoma, excluding those parts included in Timiskaming, the western part of the territorial district of Sudbury, and the territorial district of Manitoulin

In 1933, it was redefined to consist of the territorial district of Manitoulin, and the parts of the territorial districts of Algoma and Sudbury.

The electoral district was abolished in 1966 when it was redistributed between Algoma, Nickel Belt and Timmins—Chapleau ridings.

Its last, longest-serving, and highest-profile MP was Lester Pearson of the Liberal Party, who was Prime Minister of Canada from 1963 to 1968.

==Members of Parliament==
This riding elected the following members of the House of Commons of Canada:

<doc id="1309860" wikidata="Q902902" url="?curid=1309860" title="Carbonatation">
<text>Carbonatation is a chemical reaction in which calcium hydroxide reacts with carbon dioxide and forms insoluble calcium carbonate:

:&lt;chem&gt;Ca(OH)2{+}CO2-&gt;CaCO3{+}H_2O&lt;/chem&gt;

The process of forming a carbonate is sometimes referred to as &quot;carbonation&quot;, although this term usually refers to the process of dissolving carbon dioxide in water.

==Concrete==

Carbonatation is a slow process that occurs in concrete where lime (CaO, or Ca(OH)2(aq)) in the cement reacts with carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air and forms calcium carbonate.

The water in the pores of Portland cement concrete is normally alkaline with a pH in the range of 12.5 to 13.5. This highly alkaline environment is one in which the steel rebar is passivated and is protected from corrosion. According to the Pourbaix diagram for iron, the metal is passive when the pH is above 9.5.

The carbon dioxide in the air reacts with the alkali in the cement and makes the pore water more acidic, thus lowering the pH. Carbon dioxide will start to carbonatate the cement in the concrete from the moment the object is made. This carbonatation process will start at the surface, then slowly moves deeper and deeper into the concrete. The rate of carbonatation is dependent on the relative humidity of the concrete - a 50% relative humidity being optimal. If the object is cracked, the carbon dioxide in the air will be better able to penetrate into the concrete.

Eventually this may lead to corrosion of the rebar and structural damage or failure.

==Sugar refining==
The carbonatation process is used in the production of sugar from sugar beets. 
It involves the introduction of limewater (milk of lime - calcium hydroxide suspension) and carbon dioxide enriched gas into the &quot;raw juice&quot; (the sugar rich liquid prepared from the diffusion stage of the process) to form calcium carbonate and precipitate impurities that are then removed. The whole process takes place in &quot;carbonatation tanks&quot; and processing time varies from 20 minutes to an hour.

Carbonatation involves the following effects: 
* The increase in alkalinity coagulates proteins in the juice.
* Calcium carbonate absorbs colourants
* Alkalinity destroys some monosaccharide sugars, mostly glucose and fructose

The target is a large particle that naturally settles rapidly to leave a clear juice. The juice at the end is approximately 15 °Bx and 90% sucrose. The pH of the thin juice produced is a balance between removing as much calcium from the solution and the expected pH drop across later processing. If the juice goes acidic in the crystallisation stages then sucrose rapidly breaks down to glucose and fructose; not only do glucose and fructose affect crystallisation but they are &#x27;molassagenic&#x27; taking equivalent amounts of sucrose on to the molasses stage.

The carbon dioxide gas bubbled through the mixture forms calcium carbonate. The non-sugar solids are incorporated into the calcium carbonate particles and removed by natural (or assisted) sedimentation in tanks or clarifiers.

There are several systems of carbonatation, named from the companies that first developed them. They differ in how the lime is introduced, the temperature and duration of each stage, and the separation of the solids from the liquid. 
* Dorr (also Dorr-Oliver) - a continuous process using two tanks with recycling (&quot;1st carbonatation&quot;) to build up particle size for natural flocculation. The recycling ratio is about 7:1. The particles are separated under gravity in a thickening stage in a clarifier. The clear juice is then gassed further in another tank (&quot;2nd carbonatation&quot;) and filtered. The concentrated mud (underflow) from the clarifier is filtered and/or pressed to recover more liquid. The Dorr process is low in maintenance and man-power but susceptible to filtration problems when frost damaged beets are processed. It is favoured in the UK and the USA.
* DDS (&quot;Det Danske Sukkerfabrik&quot; - &quot;The Danish Sugarfactory&quot;) -- multistage process involving pre-liming where the pH of the juice is gradually increased to start precipitation of proteins, followed by addition of further lime and CO2 gas. The particles are removed at each stage by filtration.
* RT (&quot;Raffinerie Tirlemontoise&quot; - &quot;Sugar refinery of Tienen&quot;) - another multistage process with a pre-liming stage. Particles also removed by filtration.

Both DDS and RT processes are favoured by European factories. The carbonatation system is generally matched to the diffusion scheme; juice from RT diffusers being processed by the RT carbonatation.

The clear juice from carbonatation is generally known as &quot;thin juice&quot;. it may undergo pH adjustment with soda ash and addition of sulfur (&quot;sulfitation&quot;) prior to the next stage which is concentration by multiple effect evaporation.

==Water softening==
The carbonatation reaction takes place during lime softening (Clark&#x27;s process) in water softening.

<text>Cedar–Riverside station is a light rail station on the Blue Line in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

The station is located between 15th and 16th Avenues South, near the interchange of Interstate 35W, Interstate 94, and Minnesota State Highway 55. It is a center-platform station and is one of a few stations where there are no designated bus routes to transfer to or from, though buses run along Cedar Avenue a few blocks away. Service began at this station when the Blue Line opened on June 26, 2004.

As light rail vehicles are removed from service following the rush hour peak, the Cedar–Riverside station is the last stop for the trains and all passengers must disembark at that point. The maintenance base for the line is located between this station and the Franklin Avenue stop to the south.

The transparent roof of the station has constellations marked on it.

<text>LIVE365 is an Internet radio network which enables users to create their own online radio stations and listen to thousands of human curated stations. Online radio stations on the Live365 network were created and managed by music and talk enthusiasts, including both hobbyists and professional broadcasters. Live365 also has many well established AM and FM stations that use Live365 broadcasting platform to simulcast their terrestrial radio streams. The Live365 network also features radio stations from artists such as Johnny Cash, David Byrne, Pat Metheny, Jethro Tull, and Frank Zappa. Live365 was created in 1999, and remains one of the longest running internet radio websites for listeners and broadcasters.

This internet radio provides service in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, with licenses from those countries&#x27; performance rights societies.

== History ==
Nanocosm Inc. (the parent company of Live365) was a technology startup founded by two roommates from the Princeton class of 1981, Alex Sanford and Steve Follmer, whose initial product was NanoHome, a 3D &quot;Virtual Home&quot; website featuring 3D homepages on the World Wide Web.

Live365 had its beginnings in a hosted community radio project developed by Nanocosm employee Andy Volk in his free time using Shoutcast technology, and later modified by employee Brian Lomeland. In 1998, Andy Volk shared the idea with Nanocosm CTO Peter Rothman, and they developed the concept for a new large-scale hosted community radio service dubbed Live365. After launch in July 1999, Live365 quickly eclipsed NanoHome, and the company soon shifted to solely focus on Live365 and online audio streaming services.

At launch, broadcasting and listening on Live365 was free of charge. Stations had a maximum listener cap of 365 simultaneous listeners and 365 megabytes of storage for music and audio. In September 2001, Live365 began charging for use of its broadcasting services to remain financially viable in the wake of rising music royalty costs. More expensive plans allowed stations to have more simultaneous listeners and a greater amount of music file storage space. Members who joined before September 2001 could continue broadcasting with their original package for free. This model would later be replaced with one in which all members pay, but those who joined before September 2001 received a discount. In March 2003, Live365 launched their commercial-free membership called VIP.

===Closure and reopening===
The Webcaster Settlement Act of 2009 expired in January 2016, ending a 10-year period in which smaller online radio stations, Live365 among them, paid lower music licensing fees compared to larger broadcasters. After this time, smaller radio stations were required to pay the same fees as the largest broadcasters. Also, on January 31, 2016, webcasters, who are governed by rules adopted by the Copyright Royalty Board, were required to begin paying SoundExchange an annual, nonrefundable minimum fee of $500 for each channel and station, the fee for services with greater than 100 stations or channels being $50,000 annual.

With the pending expiration of the lower royalty rate allowed for small broadcasters, investors removed their support of the company. In late December 2015, Live365 laid off most of its employees and vacated its office, and the few remaining employees were remote workers. On January 31, 2016, Live365 ceased webcasting and its website redirected listeners and users to a list of competing services. A year after its closure, Live365 relaunched its site and streaming services.

In July 2016, Live365 was acquired by Jon Stephenson, owner of content delivery network EmpireStreaming (now SoundStack). The following month, the website returned with signs of a possible relaunch. An article was posted to the site&#x27;s official Twitter on May 23, 2017 announcing the relaunch.

On January 6, 2018, Live365 was reorganized under Media Creek Inc., a Delaware-based holding company.

== Services and features ==

=== Listening ===
Live365 offers a variety of music and talk from numerous countries and genres. Users may listen to thousands of stations on the Live365 radio network for free, with in-stream audio ads covering a portion of the music royalty and streaming costs. Live365 also offers personalized recommendations. Live365 is available for listening on the web and across many mobile and home streaming devices.

Live365 offers a paid listener subscription service called VIP, which features commercial-free listening.

=== Broadcasting platform ===
Live365 is a digital broadcasting platform that was initially operational from 1999 to January 31, 2016, before being revived in 2018. The platform provides the functionality for users to either host live broadcasts or upload and create playlists of music and talk content for streaming purposes. Live365 pays music royalties to labels, artists, songwriters, and publishers through organizations including ASCAP, BMI, SESAC, and SoundExchange.

In October 2011, Live365 implemented the Pro Points rewards program. This enabled Pro broadcasters to incorporate Live365 audio advertisements into their content, with financial rewards granted upon reaching specified ad milestones.

In 2013, Live365 further expanded its service offerings with the release of the Studio365 for Mobile application. This software tool allows Live365 broadcasters to manage their radio station remotely using mobile devices.

<doc id="1309883" wikidata="Q7408271" url="?curid=1309883" title="Sam Uskiw">
<text>Samuel Uskiw (October 18, 1933 in East Selkirk, Manitoba – March 19, 2011) was a politician and political fundraiser in Manitoba, Canada. He was a New Democratic member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1966 to 1986, and served as a cabinet minister in the governments of Edward Schreyer and Howard Pawley. Subsequently, he left the New Democrats and became a fundraiser for their leading rival, the Progressive Conservative Party.

After completing his education, Uskiw worked in Winnipeg briefly before moving to Ontario where he worked on a farm in Ingersoll and then worked for the Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway. He returned to Manitoba in 1953, working as a potato farmer and meat cutter as well as selling insurance before entering political life, and served as a Junior President of the Manitoba Farmers Union in 1961-1962. He was also a school trustee from 1959 to 1965. In 1964, Uskiw married Olga Bilyk.

He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1966, replacing Edward Schreyer (who had left for the House of Commons of Canada) in the rural riding of Brokenhead. He was easily re-elected in the redistributed riding of Lac Du Bonnet in the 1969 election, by which time Schreyer had returned to provincial politics to lead the NDP to its first-ever election victory. Uskiw supported Scheyer over Sidney Green in the leadership convention which preceded the election.

Uskiw served as Minister of Agriculture from July 15, 1969, to October 24, 1977, the entirety of Schreyer&#x27;s tenure in office. He also served as Minister of Cooperative Development from May 6, 1971, to December 23, 1974. Some have argued that Schreyer tried to forestall Uskiw&#x27;s leadership ambitions by keeping him in the same ministry for several years.

As Agriculture Minister, Uskiw was responsible for overseeing several initiatives and subsidy programs. He argued that rural taxation was disproportionately high, and favoured shifting education taxes from land to homeownership. He also brought forward legislation to provide for a publicly owned land system to relieve farmers of the burden of investment (this was an optional, not a mandatory program). Although the NDP made some minor rural gains in the 1973 election, however, the party&#x27;s core support remained urban. Uskiw himself was easily re-elected in the 1973 election, and in the election of 1977, in which the Schreyer government lost power to the Tories under Sterling Lyon.

In early 1979, Uskiw supported Sidney Green&#x27;s attempt to become the party&#x27;s interim leader following Schreyer&#x27;s resignation. He declined to run for the leadership himself later in the year, despite efforts by supporters such as Herb Schulz and Harry Shafransky to mobilize a candidacy. He also refused to endorse the successful campaign of Howard Pawley, despite the fact that he and Pawley had been allies in the Schreyer ministry. Uskiw was uncomfortable with the direction of the party under Pawley&#x27;s leadership, particularly as regards its increased ties to the labour movement.

In 1981, there was considerable speculation that Uskiw would leave the NDP to join Green&#x27;s new Progressive Party, thereby giving them official party status in the legislature. He ultimately refused, and claimed that he would try to change the NDP&#x27;s policies from within. While he did not leave the NDP, he expressed his disapproval of the party&#x27;s leftward turn under Pawley at several public forums.

Uskiw was re-elected in the election of 1981, in which the NDP under Pawley formed a majority government. He was named Minister of Government Services and Minister of Highways and Transportation on November 30, 1981. He was relieved of the former position on August 20, 1982, and of the latter on November 4, 1983, when he was appointed Minister of Business Development and Tourism with responsibility for the Manitoba Telephone System Act. Following another cabinet shuffle on January 30, 1985, he was named Minister of Natural Resources.

Uskiw did not run for re-election in 1986, and in fact supported the Progressive Conservative candidate in Lac Du Bonnet (who was defeated). He personally joined the Tories after the election, and soon became one of the party&#x27;s leading consultants and financial contributors (There was a period when he may have been the party&#x27;s largest personal donor). Uskiw also spoke at meetings of Green&#x27;s Progressive Party, in which he argued that demands from the trade union movement had undermined his ministerial independence during the Pawley years.

After retiring from politics, he operated a consulting business. He did not seek a return to active politics after 1986. In the 1990s, he chaired a commission overseeing changes to the province&#x27;s Personal Injury Protection Plan.

While in office, Uskiw supported the expansion of nuclear power in Manitoba.

Although he was no longer a member of the New Democratic Party at the time, Uskiw supported Edward Schreyer&#x27;s bid to return to the Canadian House of Commons in the 2006 federal election

Uskiw died in hospital in Selkirk at the age of 77 after a lengthy battle with colon cancer.

<doc id="1309904" wikidata="Q1412822" url="?curid=1309904" title="Beer stein">
<text>A beer stein ( ), or simply stein, is either a traditional beer mug made out of stoneware or specifically an ornamental beer mug sold as a souvenir or collectible. An 1894 article on beer mugs in the American &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine that describes various types of steins stated: &quot;And it is to this [i.e. German] nation that we owe Wagner&#x27;s music and the apotheosis of the beer mug.&quot;

Such steins may be made out of stoneware, pewter, porcelain or even silver, wood or crystal glass; they may have open tops or hinged pewter lids with a thumb-lever. Steins usually come in sizes of a half litre or a full litre (or comparable historic sizes). Like decorative tankards, they are often decorated in a nostalgic manner with allusions to Germany.

==Etymology==

The English word is attested from 1855. It is borrowed from German &quot;&quot;, which has – aside from its prevailing meaning &quot;stone&quot; – elder regional meanings &quot;beer mug&quot; and &quot;beer measure of 1 litre or 2 Schoppen&quot;.

The word can be compared to English &quot;&quot; &quot;stone or earthen vessel&quot;, and Old English &quot;pitcher, jug&quot;.

The word &#x27; alone is not used any more to refer to a beverage container in standard German; rather, &#x27;, &#x27; or, especially in Bavaria and Austria, &#x27; are used. Oktoberfest usage is Maßkrug.

==History==
It is believed by some that the hinged lid was implemented during the age of the Black Plague to prevent diseased flies from getting into the beer.
This is unlikely to be true, as contemporaries did not know flies spread the disease. Instead, the prevailing belief was that it was spread through dangerous &quot;miasmas&quot;.

The advantage in using stoneware to make steins was that molds could be used to mass-produce elaborately carved steins. On the other hand, glass had the advantage that one could add an artistic touch by including acid etchings, glass staining, or even multicolored overlays. Porcelain&#x27;s advantage was that a stein fabricator could use molds to make &quot;character steins&quot;, steins that had a particular shape modeled after an item or collecting antique and replicated beer steins became a very popular hobby not only among individual people, but in museums as well. Production of beer steins has become substantial in America, but the largest producer of beer steins is Ceramarte of Brazil.

The most traditional area of beer stein production is the Kannenbäckerland in the Westerwald region in Germany. This unique German potters region has been creating beer steins for centuries and is famous among the collectors as the original German beer stein producer.

==Material==

Beer steins were made primarily with pewter in many areas across Europe (primarily in England), but many steins were known to be made of glass, porcelain, and silver as well. Steins have also been known to have been made out of wood, earthenware, and crystal.

Ordinary German beer mugs have been made out of glass for hygienic reasons since the introduction of glass mugs to the 1892 Oktoberfest. Modern beer mugs, except again decorative or luxury versions, do not have a lid.

Beer mugs (0.5 and 1 litre) are typical for beer gardens and especially the Oktoberfest, where they are popular for their robustness. In other settings, 0.33 and 0.5 litre beer glasses are also popular.

Attempts to replace beer mugs made from glass or earthenware by ones made from plastic (for security reasons) have been variously met with protests, even burnings of mugs and were never successful in the long or even medium term in Germany.

==The lid==
The lids on beer mugs serve as a sanitary measure, especially to keep insects out of the beer. They are usually made out of pewter, and are usually equipped with a lever that is in reach of the thumb, so that it is possible to grab the mug and open and close the lid with a single hand.

These days beer mats are usually used to cover the glass or mug when required.

==Other forms and synonyms==
In German-speaking regions beer mugs may be known as:

*&quot;&quot; (&quot;beer mug&quot;)
*&#x27; or &#x27; (for a one-litre beer mug)
*&quot;, a tall drinking glass sometimes with covers enamelled with the double eagle of the Holy Roman Empire
*&#x27; or &#x27; (Franconia, litre). The term &quot; is also used by the Pennsylvania Dutch in the Pennsylvania Dutch Country.
*&quot; (Palatinate, litre)
*&quot;&quot;, the traditional (but non-embellished) stoneware beer mug, named after the village of Keferloh near Munich where they were originally produced

Considered collectible are traditional designs such as brewery emblems, Bavarian motifs such as Neuschwanstein or the Marienplatz Rathaus-Glockenspiel of Munich, and the colorful official annual Oktoberfest souvenir mug featuring the year&#x27;s winning poster design.

The use of beer mugs is uncommon in most parts of Northern and Central Germany, and in these regions considered a Bavarian specialty.

<text>Eugen Bejinariu (; born 28 January 1959, Suceava, Suceava County, Romania) is a Romanian politician and member of the Social Democratic Party (PSD). He served as acting/ad interim Prime Minister of Romania between 21 and 28 December 2004, when former PSD Prime Minister Adrian Năstase, who had just been defeated in the 2004 presidential elections by Traian Băsescu (then PD candidate supported by the Justice and Truth Alliance, or DA for short, which also comprised the PNL), resigned and became President of the Chamber of Deputies.

Bejinariu was appointed as acting/ad interim prime minister at the request of resigning PSD prime minister, Adrian Năstase, and confirmed by the new president Traian Băsescu to hold the office until a new prime minister was named (which subsequently was in the person of Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu of the PNL). Bejinariu was the minister of government coordination in Năstase&#x27;s cabinet, joining the government after a long stint as chairman of Romania&#x27;s State Protocol Department (RAPPS). He was replaced as prime minister on 28 December 2004 by national liberal Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu.

<doc id="1309913" wikidata="Q336135" url="?curid=1309913" title="Virtual Pascal">
<text>Virtual Pascal is a freeware 32-bit Pascal programming language compiler, integrated development environment (IDE), and debugger for OS/2 and Microsoft Windows, with some limited Linux support. Virtual Pascal was developed by Vitaly Miryanov and later maintained by Allan Mertner.

==Features==
The compiler is compatible with Turbo Pascal, Borland Delphi, and Free Pascal, although language- and RTL-compatibility is limited for features introduced after Delphi v2 and FPC 1.0.x.

VP was mainly used for these purposes:
* Easily port existing 16-bit Turbo Pascal programs to 32 bits 
* Port existing 16-bit Object Windows Library (OWL) programs to 32-bit Windows (in theory)
* Write console (text-mode) programs for several platforms
* Pascal development using the 32-bit Windows API (the classic development, no COM)
* Learn object-oriented programming

Significant features of Virtual Pascal include:
* Text-mode IDE
* Debugger is integrated directly into the IDE and is reminiscent of Turbo Debugger
* Fast compiling
* Tool-chain written mostly in x86 assembly language

==History==
===Microsoft Windows, OS/2===
The compiler was quite popular in the Bulletin board system (BBS) scene, probably because of its OS/2 port and being one of the few affordable multi-target compilers. Also Turbo Pascal had been popular in the BBS scene too, but its successor, Delphi was suddenly for Windows only. Virtual Pascal provided a migration path for existing codebases.

There has been pressure from some users to license Virtual Pascal as open-source software. This has not been done, for these reasons:
* The compiler source code is mostly written in x86 assembly language which is hard to change and maintain.
* Part of the run-time library is proprietary to Borland (The Free Pascal run-time library was ported to VirtualPascal by Noah Silva, however newer versions of the Free Pascal RTL use features of the Free Pascal compiler which are unsupported by VirtualPascal, and so cannot be ported). 
* The patch/diff tool to work around the above (provide changes to proprietary without distributing parts of the original) was proprietary and (Windows) 16-bit only.
* Documentation and help are maintained with expensive (and sometimes no longer available) proprietary tools
* There is nobody who fully understands the code. Allan said that some of the deeper areas were no-touch for him (original code by Vitaly)

Although it had a wide user base in the late 1990s, VP has not evolved significantly since 2001, and after a few maintenance-only releases, the owner declared that development had ceased in 2005.

On 4 Apr 2005, Virtual Pascal was announced &#x27;dead&#x27; on the official site. The last released version (2.1 Build 279) was announced on 13 May 2004.

===Linux===
An initial version was released on 4 July 1999, with the last known version released on 26 September 1999. This version was maintained by Jörg Pleumann. Run-Time Library to 32-bit DPMI.

<doc id="1309917" wikidata="Q1998967" url="?curid=1309917" title="Piranhas, Alagoas">
<text>Piranhas is a historic municipality near the western limit of the State of Alagoas, in the Northeast Region of Brazil.

Located on the banks of the São Francisco River, on the border with the State of Sergipe, Piranhas was founded in 1891 and originally named Floriano Peixoto (in honor of the Army General who was one of the founders of the Republic and was later elected President).

It was also known as &quot;Porto de Piranhas&quot;, because fishermen caught piranhas (a carnivorous predator fish) there.

==History==
The town was founded in 1891.

Its architecture is typical of late Empire, Northeast style of constructions.

In the 1930s, Piranhas was attacked several times by the cangaceiros, bands of marauders and bandits, commanded by the infamous Lampião, who frequently hid from the police in the rocky outcrops near the city.

==Transport==

===Railway===
Historically Piranhas was the upstream limit of navigation on the lower São Francisco River. Immediately upstream of Piranhas there were impassable rapids, and 60 km further upstream was the major falls at Paulo Afonso. Above those falls the São Francisco became navigable again for over 1500 km.

In 1881 Piranhas became the start of a railway line which was designed to bypass these obstacles to navigation. The line rose out of the deeply cut valley of the river and then, paralleling it at a distance of several kilometres, set off in a north-westerly direction, before rejoining it further upstream. The line passed through a series of small towns including Olho d&#x27;Água das Flores and Delmiro Gouveia, before reaching its destination at Petrolândia, on the banks of the upper São Francisco, and approximately 80 km upstream from Piranhas.

From 1881 to 1903 this railway was known as the Estrada de Ferro Paulo Afonso. After this date the line was incorporated successively in two other rail companies before closing finally in 1964. The line was never incorporated physically into any railway network, remaining a single, single track, line from beginning to end. Today the stretch of the abandoned trackbed, which climbs up the side of the valley from the centre of Piranhas, provides a walking route with views of São Francisco in the valley below and of the Xingó Dam hydroelectric installation, just upstream of the town.

===Other transport===
Today Piranhas can be reached by boat from several ports along the São Francisco, or by car, via a paved road from Maceió (AL-225).

==Leisure==

The municipality holds part of the Rio São Francisco Natural Monument, which protects the canyons of the São Francisco River between the Paulo Afonso Hydroelectric Complex and the Xingó Dam. 

Water sports such as catamarans, sailboats and canoes are available at river beaches and lakes, as well tours along the São Francisco using typical paddle steamers (gaiolas). Several waterfalls, the river itself, the semi-arid and rough caatinga, strange rock formations, and its river gorges are visible.

==Statistics==
* Population: 25,183 (2020) 
* Area: 407.65 km²
* Elevation: 88 m
* Distance from the capital (Maceió): 291 km
* Climate: dry and hot, average annual temperature: 28 degrees Celsius
* Economic activity: fishing, agriculture, cattle raising, ecotourism.

<doc id="1309924" wikidata="Q7272336" url="?curid=1309924" title="Quinpool District">
<text>The Quinpool District refers to a commercial district of Halifax, Nova Scotia, encompassing the eastern portion of Quinpool Road as well as the streets directly north and south of it. Prominent landmarks on Quinpool Road include the Atlantica Hotel, the Oxford Theatre, and an eclectic variety of local businesses, including many popular Chinese and Greek restaurants.

Quinpool Road runs from the Armdale Rotary through Connaught Avenue, terminating at what is known as the &quot;Willow Tree&quot;, on Robie Street - an unusual five-way intersection named for the prominent tree that once grew in the median. The street is commercialised from Connaught Ave to the Willow Tree and comprises a popular shopping and dining centre for the local community. It is also part of the Nova Scotia provincial road system, meaning that the Province of Nova Scotia pays the Halifax Regional Municipality in part for snow clearing and maintenance.

While the street is an important commercial district in Halifax, it also forms a major boundary between the city&#x27;s working class North End and wealthier South End, both physically and socially. Quinpool is also the heart of the city&#x27;s middle class West End neighbourhood. The area was also home to two longtime rival high schools, Queen Elizabeth High School and St. Patrick&#x27;s High School until their merger as Citadel High School in September 2007. St. Patrick&#x27;s High School was since renamed the Quinpool Education Centre, and hosted a number of educational programs and social services. The city declared the school building surplus and it was demolished.

The name Quinpool dates from at least 1808 and is believed to come from an Irish widow named Quinn who lived by a stretch of water in the Northwest Arm known as &#x27;Quinn&#x27;s Pool&#x27;.

<text>Lesley Doreen Langley (born 26 March 1944 in Weymouth, Dorset, with the name Lesley Hill, which she changed to Leslie Langley to make it more artistic) is a British actress, model and beauty queen who was crowned Miss World 1965 she previously was crowned Miss United Kingdom 1965. She became the third woman from her country to win the title, and the second Miss United Kingdom in a row, thus making the United Kingdom the second country to have back-to-back winners. Sweden was the first, winning the inaugural pageant in 1951 and the second pageant in 1952.

==Career==
Langley attended the Royal Merchant Navy School—now known as Reddam House, Berkshire—in the 1950s.

In the mid-1960s she played a small part as a member of an all-female team of pilots in the James Bond film &quot;Goldfinger&quot; as well as a Thal in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;The Daleks&quot;.

She also became the front cover in 1967 on Weymouth&#x27;s Official Holiday Guide, with photos inside.

==Personal life==
During her tenure Langley met and married jazz organist Alan Haven—known for his collaborations with John Barry in the James Bond films &quot;From Russia with Love&quot; and &quot;Goldfinger&quot;—and they had one daughter named Chloë. They divorced and Lesley later worked as a dental practice assistant.

<doc id="1309936" wikidata="Q411235" url="?curid=1309936" title="Iron(II,III) oxide">
<text>Iron(II,III) oxide, or black iron oxide, is the chemical compound with formula Fe3O4. It occurs in nature as the mineral magnetite. It is one of a number of iron oxides, the others being iron(II) oxide (FeO), which is rare, and iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3) which also occurs naturally as the mineral hematite. It contains both Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions and is sometimes formulated as FeO ∙ Fe2O3. This iron oxide is encountered in the laboratory as a black powder. It exhibits permanent magnetism and is ferrimagnetic, but is sometimes incorrectly described as ferromagnetic. Its most extensive use is as a black pigment (see: Mars Black). For this purpose, it is synthesized rather than being extracted from the naturally occurring mineral as the particle size and shape can be varied by the method of production.

==Preparation==
Heated iron metal interacts with steam to form iron oxide and hydrogen gas.

:&lt;chem&gt;3Fe + 4H2O-&gt;Fe3O4 + 4H2 &lt;/chem&gt;

Under anaerobic conditions, ferrous hydroxide (Fe(OH)2) can be oxidized by water to form magnetite and molecular hydrogen. This process is described by the Schikorr reaction:
:&lt;chem&gt;\underset{ferrous\ hydroxide}{3Fe(OH)2} -&gt; \underset{magnetite}{Fe3O4} + \underset{hydrogen}{H2} + \underset{water}{2H2O}&lt;/chem&gt;
This works because crystalline magnetite (Fe3O4) is thermodynamically more stable than amorphous ferrous hydroxide (Fe(OH)2 ).

The Massart method of preparation of magnetite as a ferrofluid, is convenient in the laboratory: mix iron(II) chloride and iron(III) chloride in the presence of sodium hydroxide.

A more efficient method of preparing magnetite without troublesome residues of sodium, is to use ammonia to promote chemical co-precipitation from the iron chlorides: first mix solutions of 0.1 M FeCl3·6H2O and FeCl2·4H2O with vigorous stirring at about 2000 rpm. The molar ratio of the FeCl3:FeCl2 should be about 2:1. Heat the mix to 70 °C, then raise the speed of stirring to about 7500 rpm and quickly add a solution of NH4OH (10 volume %). A dark precipitate of nanoparticles of magnetite forms immediately.

In both methods, the precipitation reaction relies on rapid transformation of acidic iron ions into the spinel iron oxide structure at pH 10 or higher.

Controlling the formation of magnetite nanoparticles presents challenges: the reactions and phase transformations necessary for the creation of the magnetite spinel structure are complex. The subject is of practical importance because magnetite particles are of interest in bioscience applications such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in which iron oxide magnetite nanoparticles potentially present a non-toxic alternative to the gadolinium-based contrast agents currently in use. However, difficulties in controlling the formation of the particles, still frustrate the preparation of superparamagnetic magnetite particles, that is to say: magnetite nanoparticles with a coercivity of 0 A/m, meaning that they completely lose their permanent magnetisation in the absence of an external magnetic field. The smallest values currently reported for nanosized magnetite particles is &quot;Hc&quot; = 8.5 A m−1, whereas the largest reported magnetization value is 87 Am2 kg−1 for synthetic magnetite.

Pigment quality Fe3O4, so called synthetic magnetite, can be prepared using processes that use industrial wastes, scrap iron or solutions containing iron salts (e.g. those produced as by-products in industrial processes such as the acid vat treatment (pickling) of steel):

*Oxidation of Fe metal in the Laux process where nitrobenzene is treated with iron metal using FeCl2 as a catalyst to produce aniline:
:C6H5NO2 + 3 Fe + 2 H2O → C6H5NH2 + Fe3O4
*Oxidation of FeII compounds, e.g. the precipitation of iron(II) salts as hydroxides followed by oxidation by aeration where careful control of the pH determines the oxide produced.

Reduction of Fe2O3 with hydrogen:
:3Fe2O3 + H2 → 2Fe3O4 +H2O
Reduction of Fe2O3 with CO:
:3Fe2O3 + CO → 2Fe3O4 + CO2

Production of nano-particles can be performed chemically by taking for example mixtures of FeII and FeIII salts and mixing them with alkali to precipitate colloidal Fe3O4. The reaction conditions are critical to the process and determine the particle size.

Iron(II) carbonate can also be thermally decomposed into Iron(II,III):

==Reactions==
Reduction of magnetite ore by CO in a blast furnace is used to produce iron as part of steel production process:
:&lt;chem&gt;{Fe3O4} + 4CO -&gt; {3Fe} + 4CO2&lt;/chem&gt;
Controlled oxidation of Fe3O4 is used to produce brown pigment quality γ-Fe2O3 (maghemite):
:formula_1
More vigorous calcining (roasting in air) gives red pigment quality α-Fe2O3 (hematite):
:formula_2

== Structure ==
Fe3O4 has a cubic inverse spinel group structure which consists of a cubic close packed array of oxide ions where all of the Fe2+ ions occupy half of the octahedral sites and the Fe3+ are split evenly across the remaining octahedral sites and the tetrahedral sites.

Both FeO and γ-Fe2O3 have a similar cubic close packed array of oxide ions and this accounts for the ready interchangeability between the three compounds on oxidation and reduction as these reactions entail a relatively small change to the overall structure. Fe3O4 samples can be non-stoichiometric.

The ferrimagnetism of Fe3O4 arises because the electron spins of the FeII and FeIII ions in the octahedral sites are coupled and the spins of the FeIII ions in the tetrahedral sites are coupled but anti-parallel to the former. The net effect is that the magnetic contributions of both sets are not balanced and there is a permanent magnetism.

In the molten state, experimentally constrained models show that the iron ions are coordinated to 5 oxygen ions on average. There is a distribution of coordination sites in the liquid state, with the majority of both FeII and FeIII being 5-coordinated to oxygen and minority populations of both 4- and 6-fold coordinated iron.

==Properties==
Fe3O4 is ferrimagnetic with a Curie temperature of . There is a phase transition at , called Verwey transition where there is a discontinuity in the structure, conductivity and magnetic properties. This effect has been extensively investigated and whilst various explanations have been proposed, it does not appear to be fully understood.

While it has much higher electrical resistivity than iron metal (96.1 nΩ m), Fe3O4&#x27;s electrical resistivity (0.3 mΩ m ) is significantly lower than that of Fe2O3 (approx kΩ m). This is ascribed to electron exchange between the FeII and FeIII centres in Fe3O4.

==Uses==
Fe3O4 is used as a black pigment and is known as &quot;C.I pigment black 11&quot; (C.I. No.77499) or Mars Black.

Fe3O4 is used as a catalyst in the Haber process and in the water-gas shift reaction. The latter uses an HTS (high temperature shift catalyst) of iron oxide stabilised by chromium oxide. This iron–chrome catalyst is reduced at reactor start up to generate Fe3O4 from α-Fe2O3 and Cr2O3 to CrO3.

Bluing is a passivation process that produces a layer of Fe3O4 on the surface of steel to protect it from rust. Along with sulfur and aluminium, it is an ingredient in steel-cutting thermite.

=== Medical uses ===

Nano particles of Fe3O4 are used as contrast agents in MRI scanning.

Ferumoxytol, sold under the brand names Feraheme and Rienso, is an intravenous Fe3O4 preparation for treatment of anemia resulting from chronic kidney disease. Ferumoxytol is manufactured and globally distributed by AMAG Pharmaceuticals.

==Biological occurrence==
Magnetite has been found as nano-crystals in magnetotactic bacteria (42–45 nm) and in the beak tissue of homing pigeons.

<doc id="1309940" wikidata="Q6013976" url="?curid=1309940" title="Inboard brake">
<text>An inboard brake is an automobile technology wherein the disc brakes are mounted on the chassis of the vehicle, rather than directly on the wheel hubs. Its main advantages are twofold: a reduction in the unsprung weight of the wheel hubs, as this no longer includes the brake discs and calipers; and braking torque is applied directly to the chassis, rather than being transferred to it through the suspension arms.

==Description==
Inboard brakes are fitted to a driven axle of the car, as they require a drive shaft to link the wheel to the brake. Most have thus been used for rear-wheel drive cars, although four-wheel drive and some front-wheel drives have also used them. A rare few rear wheel drive racing cars (e.g., the Lotus 72) have also used inboard front discs, accepting the need to provide a front brake shaft to gain the overall unsprung weight and braking torque advantages.

Inboard brakes for early racing cars have rarely used drum brakes, although nearly all inboard brakes date from the disc brake era.
Excepting the case of vehicles with beam axles and vehicles having no suspension, in practice it is normal for inboard brakes to be mounted rigidly with respect to the body of the vehicle, often to the differential casing. This is done to move the weight of the braking mechanism from being carried by the wheels directly as unsprung mass, to being carried indirectly by the wheels via the suspension as sprung mass. This then necessitates a means of transferring braking torque from the brake mechanism to the wheel, which is capable of operating despite the relative movement between body and wheel. Driven wheels already have shafting (or chains in older vehicles) which serve this purpose so there is no penalty for them, but undriven wheels require a similar mechanism which is then called a brake shaft.

The benefit of such a system is primarily the reduction of unsprung weight which improves handling and ride. The suspension does not have to resist twisting when the brakes are applied. The wheels don&#x27;t enclose the brake mechanism allowing greater flexibility in wheel offset, and placement of suspension members. It is also much easier to protect the brake mechanism from the outside environment, and protect it from water, dust, and oil. Of secondary importance is flexible brake pipes are avoided; rigid pipes allow increases in brake fluid pressure, allowing for a smaller disc to manage a given braking torque.

The mechanical disadvantages are largely those of added complexity. Undriven wheels require a brake shaft. Mounted inboard, it is more difficult to arrange for cooling air to flow over the rotor and air ducting can be required to prevent brake fade.

Inboard brakes also affect anti-pitch suspension geometry.

There can be practical difficulties in servicing the brake mechanism. Instead of simply removing a wheel to renew pads and discs, the vehicle may need to be jacked up, so a mechanic can work underneath the vehicle. Additionally renewing brake discs can require dismantling the half axle. This greatly discourages their use in motorsport, and the additional time makes for greater labour cost when servicing these parts.

This system was more common in the 1960s, found on such cars as the Jaguar E-Type and Citroën 2CV. The Hummer H1 is one of the few modern vehicles fitted with inboard brakes, to accommodate each wheel&#x27;s portal gear system.

Hybrid electric vehicles may be considered to have partial inboard braking, because the motor–generator(s) used for the regenerative part of the braking are usually mounted inboard.

==Examples==
Cars with inboard brakes at the driven end include:
* Alfa Romeo Alfasud, front wheels have inboard discs. 
* Alfa Romeo Alfetta, Alfetta GT/GTV, GTV6, Giulietta (116), 75 / Milano, 90, SZ/RZ 
* Audi 100
* British Racing Motors: Some BRM racing cars had a single inboard disc brake, acting on both back wheels.
* Citroën 2CV, DS, GS, SM, Ami, Dyane, Axel and other Citroën models
* Cord L-29
* Corvette Stingray (concept car) not really a concept but a racing model. 
* DKW Junior plus other models
*Devin SS
*Ferrari 312 Formula One car
* Hummer H1
* Jaguar E-Type, Jaguar XJ (until XJ40), Jaguar XJ-S, Jaguar Mark X
* Lancia Aprilia, Aurelia, Flaminia
* Lotus Twelve racing car, and most other racing Lotuses after.
* Lotus Elite, Elan and Esprit
* Maserati, Quattroporte II (AM123, 1974–1978)
* Mercedes-Benz W196 and 300SLR
* Monteverdi Hai 450 SS
* NSU Ro80
* Oltcit Club

<text>Josef Skupa (16 January 1892 in Strakonice – 8 January 1957 in Prague) was a Czech puppeteer.

He studied at the Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design in Prague, and worked as stage designer in the Plzeň City Theatre, also as designer in Skoda Engineering Works.

In year 1919 and 1926, respectively, he created his most famous puppets: comical father &quot;Spejbl&quot; and his rascal son &quot;Hurvínek&quot;. In 1930 he set up the first modern professional puppet theatre. In 1933 he became the president of the International Puppetry Association UNIMA.

He was active freemason of masonic lodge &quot;Josef Dobrovský&quot; in Plzeň.

During the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia, Skupa performed satiric and allegorical puppet plays on hundreds of stages all over Czechoslovakia. After 1945, he moved his theatre to Prague. He was praised as an official &quot;national artist&quot; during the Communist regime but he was criticised for his lack of political engagement. Therefore, Skupa focused on plays for children, and mime with puppets for adults. He also performed abroad (Great Britain, Poland, France, Hungary, USSR). 

His wife was a puppeteer Jiřina Skupová (born Schwarzová).

<text>Doreen Lois Dodick (born February 17, 1932) is a former politician in Manitoba, Canada. She was a New Democratic Party member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1981 to 1986.

She was born in 1932 in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, the daughter of Edward John Oehlerking and Ima Cathine Annable, was educated in Saskatchewan, and subsequently moved to Manitoba. In 1952, she married John Dodick. She worked as an organizer for the NDP before entering political life herself.

She was a candidate in the south Winnipeg riding of Riel in the provincial election of 1977, but lost to Tory incumbent Donald Craik by almost 4,000 votes. Four years later, in the provincial election of 1981, she defeated Craik by 242 votes in a rematch, as the NDP won a majority government under Howard Pawley. She was not appointed to cabinet.

In the 1986 election, Dodick lost to Tory challenger Gerry Ducharme by over 700 votes. She has not sought a return to provincial politics since this time. In the provincial election of 1999, she supported Linda Asper&#x27;s campaign in the Riel riding.

In 2002, Dodick supported Bill Blaikie&#x27;s bid to lead the federal New Democratic Party.

<text>Imagine Entertainment, formerly Imagine Films Entertainment, also known simply as Imagine (stylized as IMAGINE), is an American film and television production company founded in November 1985 by producer Brian Grazer and director Ron Howard.

==Background==
Brian Grazer and Ron Howard met in 1982 on &quot;Night Shift&quot;, with Howard directing and Grazer co-producing. They followed it up by working on 1984&#x27;s &quot;Splash&quot;.

==History==
===Imagine Films Entertainment===

The company was originally founded in November 1985, following the success of the motion picture &quot;Splash&quot;. It was originated from a merger of two production companies, Ron Howard&#x27;s Major H Productions and Brian Grazer&#x27;s self-titled production company Brian Grazer Productions. The company went public the following year. At first, the company set a deal with Tri-Star Pictures to produce feature films and television shows. Imagine granted Tri-Star the right of first refusal to syndicate their off-network shows produced by Imagine. Its offering was sold to Allen &amp; Co. for 1,667,000 units for common stock and warrant it to purchase additional one-third of its stock. The net proceeds were used for development and production of theatrical films, television series, mini-series and made for television movies, although &quot;the company does not presently intend to develop game shows or daytime soap operas.&quot; Imagine however has its prospectus having negotiations with Paramount Television for a commitment with ABC for a half-hour pilot and five episodes based on the comedy film &quot;Gung Ho&quot;.

Later the same year, Imagine had a five-year deal with Showtime/The Movie Channel, Inc. and it was able to develop projects for the channels Showtime and The Movie Channel. The agreement would kick-off with 1989 pay television availabilities and include pay-per view exhibition rights to all Imagine-produced films and about 30 motion pictures and &quot;an unspecified number of original products&quot; are also covered by the agreement. &quot;There was the option of developing &quot;long-form dramas&quot; or series as part of the original material to be developed and aired exclusively on Showtime, adding that it could also acquire the syndication rights to these films and original products.

In April 1987, producers Philip and Mary Ann Hobel had inked a pact with Imagine Films Entertainment to develop and produce theatrical fare for the company through Hobel Productions, and expected to serve as the eyes and ears of Imagine of New York, and will be backed by a development fund for the purchase of books, plays, scripts and ideas to be developed as film projects, and plans to do both comedy and drama projects with a concentration on contempo themes and issues through a first-look agreement.

On July 29, 1987, Tri-Star Pictures and Imagine Films Entertainment announced the termination of obligations by Imagine to offer Tri-Star distribution rights for all of its television programming and feature films. Imagine, which received more than $1.7 million from Tri-Star, made a $1.3 million payment to Tri-Star, the companies said and advances from Tri-Star were eliminated. The companies said they &quot;intend[ed] to work together on a project-by-project basis&quot; and that projects already in development were not affected. Imagine said the modified agreement &quot;provide[d] it with the flexibility to pursue certain financing and distribution opportunities which were not anticipated when the companies entered the original agreement.&quot;

In November 1987, Imagine Films Entertainment announced its plans to move its financial and administrative activities from New York to Los Angeles, and Neil Braun, who was president and chief-executive officer of the company would not be part of the move, and instead would leave the company and is expected to reveal of his plans shortly and his personal commitments would keep him from making the shift, but he called the consolidation &quot;the right decision for the company&quot; while expressing his disappointment at not being able to stay on.

On December 1, 1987, the company sealed a production and distribution deal with Universal Pictures via a &quot;long-term multiple picture agreement&quot; that they distributed Imagine&#x27;s films for three to five films a year and the agreement &quot;contemplates the possibility&quot; that Universal acquired a 20% share in Imagine and it ran through November 1992 for financing 50% of 30 films. Imagine had an IPO in 1986 at $8 for a package of one share and one warrant. Shares rose to $19.25 before falling in the stock market crash in 1987 to $2.25. In the summer of next year, Imagine struck a deal with MCA TV to handle distribution of its television material. MCA and Imagine had a joint television venture which MCA had the exclusive network and home video distribution rights. Imagine retained domestic distribution rights for now and was banking on those rights becoming more valuable in the future as its theatrical and television programs gained exposure. Imagine&#x27;s television division focused on half-hour comedies, whereas MCA focused on one-hour programs for the networks.

In September 1988, Robert Harris who was employee of MCA, and president of Universal Television Group joined the company as president of motion pictures and television. Harris said the studio was also taking original feature cable projects with Showtime, HBO, TNT, USA and MTV Network (which includes Nickelodeon and VH-1, in addition to projects with on-air networks).

On May 29, 1989, Imagine and Central Independent Television signed a deal to make television films for the worldwide business. Under the deal, the new joint venture would produce between four and six television films and mini-series a year. MCA who owned about 20% of Imagine and had worldwide distribution rights to its television series as well as to its long-form programs on a project-by-project basis would also have first consideration on international distribution rights to the joint venture&#x27;s programs. Imagine and Central retained rights in the United States and United Kingdom, respectively. The Imagine-Central joint venture was separate from MCA&#x27;s own ongoing exploration of a joint venture with a European company for Europe-based long-form co-production. The company was in discussions with two or three potential partners, but a deal was not expected soon. Its projects required U.S. and UK presales to go forward, although the venture intended to seek U.S. buyers going beyond the three big commercial networks to include Fox, as well as cable networks TNT, USA Network, Showtime and HBO. The deal also allowed for theatrical distribution, although such co-productions were not in the planning.

Imagine and Second City signed a joint venture deal in May 1989. In September 1989, Imagine is entering syndication production business and signed a long-term co-production deal with Second City Entertainment, for a late night talk/comedy strip that was distributed by MCA TV. It used the ready talent pool of Second City comedians. The result was &quot;My Talk Show&quot;, which aired in the 1990–91 season. As HA!: The Comedy Network is ready to air in 1990, they stuck deals with Imagine Films Entertainment, for series featuring the Second City Repertory Company, as well as MTM Enterprises.

In 1990, Imagine Films Entertainment launched a brand new family film label Imagine Family Films, designed to compete with Disney for a family film audience, in order to produce G-rated and PG-rated feature films, and has plans to produce three family films per year, with an eye on the holiday release schedule. The first film planned to be developed for the branding was a remake of the 1963 family feature film &quot;Flipper&quot;, and an adaptation of the book series &quot;Curious George&quot;. Both MCA/Universal and Imagine agreed to an extension that Universal would handle theatrical distribution, network, foreign and home video rights, while Universal Studios Florida handled the theme park rights to the properties that were proposed by Imagine Family Films. The new Imagine Family Films banner was intended to model on the success of Disney, and decided to extend on the natural extension of the wholesome wide appeal fare the company has been using since its founding.

In 1991, Imagine Films Entertainment shut down its original Imagine Television division, and terminating its exclusive production partnership with MCA, Inc., and it laid off 30 of its 80 employees of its company. It came when the series &quot;My Talk Show&quot;, and &quot;Parenthood&quot; flopped. Andrew Suskind, Joyce Brotman, Todd Bergesen, Richard Pierson, Judy Ranam and Lisa Bloom left the company.

By May 1992, 48% of the stock was public traded and worth $9.375. The duo agreed to a new six-picture deal with Universal while concurrently offering $9 a share to buy the company&#x27;s public outstanding share to start a new company with its assets. If not, they planned to leave the company at their contract expiration in November to start the new company anyway. Universal was providing the cash for a buyout of an equity stake in the new company. By January 21, 1993, it approved a $9 share offer made by its founders and co-chief executives, and IFE Acquisition Co. could render the offer for the deal.

=== Imagine Entertainment ===
In early 1997, Imagine Entertainment reopened its television division and signed a deal with Disney for the development of television series, which would expire at the end of 2000. Its film contract remained with Universal. It boosted up their access to Disney&#x27;s television production slate. Imagine was exclusive for development and production of television projects, including half-hour comedy series, one-hour dramas, motion pictures for television and miniseries. They hired Tony Krantz to be co-chairman of its television division, and it shared a stake in the television division with its founders Brian Grazer and Ron Howard, while overseeing the television division&#x27;s day-to-day operations.

In 2000, the partnership teamed up with 20th Century Fox Television for development of television series, an agreement which was set to expire at the end of 2016. In 2011, the company had three weak box office performers with &quot;The Dilemma&quot;, &quot;Cowboys &amp; Aliens&quot; and &quot;Tower Heist&quot;. Because of their weak financial pact renewal with Universal in January 2012, Imagine laid off 5 employees, including production executive Jeremy Steckler. This also moved Imagine from exclusive to a first-look deal. By 2013, Imagine was considering other funding methods for the company&#x27;s films including crowdfunding for a &quot;Friday Night Lights&quot; film.

In November 2013, Michael Rosenberg was promoted to co-chairman followed in December 2013, with Erica Huggins being promoted to his previous position as president. Industry insiders indicated in late January 2016 that a deal with Raine Group was in the works that would have Raine become a partner of the production company while contributing $100 million. The deal was then confirmed on February 8, 2016.

On April 5, 2017, Imagine signed a six-picture deal with Warner Bros. and Australian visual effects/animation studio Animal Logic to develop, finance, and produce six animated/live-action films. At the end of July 2017, the company struck a four-year first look co-financing and television production deal with CBS Corporation, which saw the former producing content for the company&#x27;s CBS and Showtime television networks and CBS All Access SVOD streaming service. The agreement was reached by Grazer and CBS Corporation then-Chairman and then-CEO Les Moonves.

In February 2018, Imagine acquired a controlling stake in Jax Media. In November that same year, the company also acquired a stake in content studio Marginal Mediaworks founded by CEO Sanjay Sharma.

In June 2020, Imagine Entertainment made a substantial investment in Academy Award-winning filmmaker Alex Gibney&#x27;s Jigsaw Productions. Gibney formed the New York-based Jigsaw in 2012, and directed and produced &quot;&quot;, &quot;Taxi to the Dark Side&quot;, &quot;Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief&quot;, &quot;The Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley&quot;, &quot;We Steal Secrets: The Story of WikiLeaks&quot;, and &quot;Citizen K&quot;. More recently, the studio signed a first-look deal with Apple Originals.

In January 2023, Imagine Entertainment promoted Justin Wilkes to President of the company. Most recently, the company struck a first-look deal for feature films and documentaries with Amazon Studios.

<doc id="1309959" wikidata="Q5163022" url="?curid=1309959" title="Conservative Alliance of Zimbabwe">
<text>The Conservative Alliance of Zimbabwe (CAZ) was the final incarnation of a party formerly called the Republican Front, and prior to that it was called the Rhodesian Front (RF). In the immediate post-independence period, the party sought to promote the position of White Zimbabweans and did not initially seek support amongst other ethnic groups. Following the abolition of the &quot;white roll&quot; seats in parliament, the CAZ attempted to distance itself from its past and appeal to black voters.

== White politics post-independence ==
White politics in Zimbabwe immediately after independence were mainly involved in contesting the 20 reserved &quot;white roll&quot; seats in the Zimbabwe parliament. They were the majority party of white politicians although some whites eventually joined ZANU–PF. The RF party remained under the dominance of Ian Smith who insisted on keeping its identity as a party concentrating on issues of importance to whites, or as Smith himself described &quot;representing the interests of the white people&quot;. The RF and later CAZ did not contest common roll seats in the neither the 1980 or 1985 elections. The inadequacy of this as a political strategy quickly became apparent. Most of the sitting RF MPs in the 1980 to 1985 parliament either became independents or defected to ZANU–PF.

Smith&#x27;s response to this in the 1985 general election was to mount a campaign against the defectors, and RF (now renamed CAZ) succeeded in winning 15 of the 20 white seats. The white seats in Parliament were abolished in 1987, although CAZ continued to enjoy limited representation at municipal level. By that time, white-led civic groups such as the CZI (Confederation of Zimbabwe Industry) and CFU (Commercial Farmers Union) were openly supporting ZANU–PF.

== 1985–1992 ==
Following the abolition of the &quot;white roll&quot; seats in parliament, the CAZ attempted to shed some of its past legacy and broaden its appeal by reaching out to black voters and advertising membership to people of all races.

In July 1992, Ian Smith chaired a meeting of opposition political groups with a view to forming a political front to oppose ZANU–PF. This meeting was attended by representatives of Rhodesian-era parties including CAZ, UANC, ZANU–Ndonga and ZUM. The Forum for Democratic Reform and the Forum Party (incorporating CAZ) emerged from this.

<text> () is a book of supplications attributed to Ali al-Sajjad (–713), the fourth imam in Shia Islam, and the great-grandson of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad. The oldest prayer manual in Islam, has been praised as the epitome of Islamic spirituality and the answer to many of today&#x27;s spiritual questions. In particular, Shia tradition holds the book in great esteem, ranking it behind the Quran, the central religious text of Islam, and Nahj al-Balagha, which is attributed to the fourth Caliph and first Shia imam, Ali ibn Abi Talib. 54 supplications form the core of , which often also includes an addenda of 14 supplications and 15 whispered prayers ().

== About the book ==
 () is a collection of supplications.
Regarded as a seminal work in Islamic spirituality, has been praised as the epitome of Islamic spirituality and the answer to many of today&#x27;s spiritual questions. The book is attributed to Ali al-Sajjad, the great-grandson of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and an imam in Shia Islam, also known by the honorific title Zayn al-Abidin (). Shia tradition holds in great esteem, ranking it behind the Quran, the central text of Islam, and , which is attributed to Ali ibn Abi Talib, the first Shia imam and the grandfather of al-Sajjad. The book is known by various honorific names in Shia Islam, including &quot;Sister of the Quran,&quot; &quot;Gospel of the Holy Household,&quot; and &quot;Psalms of Muhammad&#x27;s Household.&quot; It is also revered by certain Sufi orders. Numerous commentaries have been written about .

Supplication is the act of addressing God with one&#x27;s praise, thanksgiving, hopes, and needs. Muslims often recite the supplications of their religious authorities, starting with Muhammad and, for the Shia, continuing with their imams. In particular, al-Sajjad likely composed with the Muslim community in mind. The book, for instance, contains prayers for public occasions, such as Eid al-Fitr, and also a supplication for parents, in which al-Sajjad speaks as if his parents were still alive.

 may be considered as a practical realization of the essential message of Islam, , that is, &quot;there is no god but God,&quot; or simply, God is all and man is nothing. Thus among the themes of are &quot;There is no goodness but in God,&quot; &quot;There is no patience without God&#x27;s help,&quot; &quot;There is no gratitude but through God,&quot; and their complements, &quot;There is no evil but in me,&quot; &quot;There is no impatience but in my own ego,&quot; and &quot;There is no hate but in myself.&quot; Once the worshipper admits his inadequacies and sinfulness, he can abase himself before his Lord and ask for His generosity and forgiveness.

=== Predominance of mercy===

 has been likened to a mosaic, every element of which corresponds to an element of the Quranic text. In particular, the predominance of mercy in the Quran is reflected in , where al-Sajjad repeatedly takes refuge in God&#x27;s mercy and its precedence over His wrath. He thus frequently asks God for forgiveness in , and so did Muhammad in his prayers, even though both figures are regarded as infallible in Shia Islam. Both men likely repented with utmost sincerity, but their &#x27;sins&#x27; were not willful disobedience of God. Rather they repeatedly asked God to conceal () their inadequacies as limited human beings.

This emphasis of on God&#x27;s mercy mirrors the attitude of its author, al-Sajjad, who is reported to have said, &quot;It is only strange if a person perishes as he perishes, given the scope of God&#x27;s mercy.&quot; This attitude of al-Sajjad matches that of Muhammad, who suggested that the worshipper &quot;should be firm and make his desire great, for what God gives is nothing great for Him.&quot; Yet God&#x27;s wrath is always kept in view, for any hope in God&#x27;s mercy should be accompanied by &quot;refraining from arrogance, pulling aside from persistence [in sin], and holding fast to praying [for] forgiveness,&quot; as prescribed in passage 12:13 of .

=== Other dimensions ===
In , al-Sajjad sometimes alludes to the injustices suffered by Muhammad&#x27;s household, the Ahl al-Bayt. There are also cases in the book where al-Sajjad prays for the Muslim community () and the rectification of their affairs, as well as soldiers guarding Muslim frontiers. might have initially been a sectarian booklet for the Shia. For instance, salutations to Muhammad and his family frequently appear in the book in defiance of Umayyad policies. In some supplications, al-Sajjad refers to imamate, a central tenet of Shia Islam.

Besides its spiritual dimension, is also a source of Islamic teachings. Its prayer, &quot;Blessing Upon the Bearers of the Throne,&quot; for instance, summarizes Islamic views about angels.

== Authenticity ==

The attribution of to al-Sajjad is often regarded as authentic, although parts of the books may have been artistically edited by others.
In Shia tradition, the text is regarded as , that is, handed down by numerous chains of transmission. The addenda were collected by the prominent Shia scholar Muhammad ibn Makki (), while the were popularized by Muhammad-Baqir Majlisi (), another leading Shia scholar.

== Translations ==
 was translated into Persian during the Safavid era. An English translation of the book, entitled &quot;The Psalms of Islam&quot;, is also available with an introduction and annotations by the Islamicist W.C. Chittick.

== Other collections ==
In addition to , there are other collections of prayers attributed to al-Sajjad. The second was compiled in 1643 by al-Hurr al-Amili, a renowned Shia scholar. The third was collected by Afandi, a student of Majlisi. The fifth by Muhsin al-Amin, a well-known contemporary Shia scholar, is the longest such collection and subsumes all other collections. 
== Passages==

* And the heavens and their canopies praise Him, and the earth and its embroideries, and the mountains and their heights, and trees and their branches, and the seas and their monsters, and the stars in their rising, and the rains in their falling, and the wild beasts of the earth in their preying and their dens, and the fullness of the rivers and their ripples, and the sweetness and brackishness of waters, and the blasts of the winds and their roaring, and everything that may be described or heard.
* My worn mortal face is prostrate before Thine ever lasting, ever abiding Face. My face is prostrate, dust-soiled, before its Creator, and meet and right is this prostration. My face is prostrate before Him who created and formed it and pierced for it (the openings of) hearing and sight. Blessed be God, the Best of Creators. My miserable and lowly face is prostrate before the Mighty, the Glorious.
* My God, were it not incumbent on me too obey Thy command, I should have considered Thy transcendence too great for me to direct my invocation to Thee.
* My God, Thou hast created me, a body, and with it hast given to me instruments of obedience or disobedience, and hast appointed for me in my own nature a soul clamant for selfish ends, and after this Thou hast said to me, &quot;Abstain, my servant!&quot; Through Thee (only) can I guard my innocence. Keep me then from evil. Through Thee (only) can I be shielded from sin. Then do Thou keep me. 
* Our God and Lord and Master, if we weep until our eyelashes fall out, and wail till our voices fail us, and stand till our feet shrivel, and bow till our joints are dislocated, and prostrate ourselves till our eyeballs burst, and eat the dust of the earth all our lives long, and make mention of Thee till our tongues fail, we shall not thereby have earned the wiping out of one of our misdeeds.
* One of the generous acts of the noble is compassionate kindness to captives, and I am a captive through my crime, the captive of my criminality, bound by my own deeds.
* I ask Thee to have mercy on me, on my delicate skin, this slender frame which cannot endure the heat of Thy sun. How then will it endure the heat of Thy Fire? And when it cannot bear the voice of Thy thunder, how can it bear the voice of Thine anger?
* My God my sins do not harm Thee and Thy pardon does not impoverish Thee. Then forgive me what does not harm Thee and give me what Thou wilt not miss.
* [O God!] Act toward me with the forgiveness and mercy of which Thou art worthy! Act not toward me with the chastisement and vengeance of which I am worthy!
* [O God!] Have mercy on me, laid on my bed, when the hands of my loved ones turn me over. Have mercy on me, laid on the washing table, when compassionate neighbors wash my corpse. Have mercy on me, borne among, when my relatives hold the sides of my bier. Have mercy on me, in that dark house, on my homesickness, my strangeness, my solitude. For whom has the slave to show mercy to him save the Master?
* O Companion of every stranger, be the Companion of my strangeness in the grave. O second with every solitary one, have mercy on my solitude in the grave.

<text>The Republican Front was a political party in Zimbabwe in the 1980s, led by Ian Smith as the continuation of the Rhodesian Front. The name change came on 6 June 1981 as an attempt to distance itself from its policies of the past.

On 23 July 1984 it was renamed the Conservative Alliance of Zimbabwe. At that time the party, which had started with an all-white membership, tried to appeal to black members, as well as black voters who wished to oppose the policies of the Robert Mugabe government.

Kojo Annan was educated in Wales at the independent Rydal Preparatory School, and in England, at Rendcomb College, where he excelled as a rugby player and subsequently at Keele University. He was also educated in Switzerland.

==Career==
From 1995 to 1997, Kojo Annan worked in West Africa for the Swiss-based inspection company &quot;Cotecna&quot;, then as a marketing consultant for the company.

In September 1998, Kojo Annan met with several heads of state and government ministers during the opening session of the U.N. General Assembly. In December, Cotecna won a $4.8 million Oil-for-Food contract.

Kojo Annan, Kofi Annan and Cotecna deny that the younger Annan was involved in the Oil-for-Food contract. Kojo Annan also claimed that connections with Cotecna severed after 1998; however, he continued to be paid by the company until February 2004.

The Second Interim Report by the IIC confirmed that Cotecna indeed won the Oil-for-Food contract fairly and based on merit. The Committee concluded that there was no link between Kofi Annan and the award of Cotecna&#x27;s contract; and Cotecna had been transparent and cooperative through this investigation.

On 13 December 2004, Kojo Annan claimed that the probe into the Oil-for-Food Programme by U.S. congressional committees was &quot;a witchhunt from day one as part of a broader Republican political agenda.&quot;

A January 2005 article in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; announced that he had confessed involvement in the UN Oil-for-Food Programme scandal; in a libel settlement eleven months later, the paper announced that it now &quot;entirely accepts that the allegation was untrue.&quot;

Megadeth&#x27;s front-man Dave Mustaine, mentioned Kojo Annan in the song &quot;United Abominations&quot;, the title track of Megadeth&#x27;s 2007 studio release. This song, based on the UN, sparked an official retort from the UN on 10 July by Mark Leon Goldberg of the United Nations affairs blog, UN Dispatch, who posted a rebuttal based on the accusations Mustaine made in the song.

In April 2016, he was listed in a leaked confidential document, the Panama Papers, revealing his use of offshore accounts.

Kojo Annan currently holds interest in a number of start-ups and has founded Africa10 in 2016, a social enterprise focusing on the development of African youth through sports and education

== Personal life ==
In March 2014, it was reported that Kojo Annan had married Shanthi Wilkinson.
He has two sons, born 2015 and 2018. He is the son of former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the nephew of Ghanaian diplomat Kobina Annan.

<doc id="1309966" wikidata="Q2739365" url="?curid=1309966" title="Mawile">
<text>Mawile (), known in Japan as , is a Pokémon species in Nintendo and Game Freak&#x27;s &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise. First introduced in the video games &quot;Pokémon Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot;, the development team wanted to push the concept of what a Pokémon could look like compared to previous installments. After the design was conceived, it was finalized by Ken Sugimori, who added additional details as he felt necessary. Since Mawile&#x27;s debut, it has appeared in multiple games including &quot;Pokémon Go&quot; and the &quot;Pokémon Trading Card Game&quot;, as well as media related to the franchise.

Originally classified as solely a Steel-type Pokémon, Mawile has a short yellow body, cloven feet, black markings on his hands, and a large horn resembling a crocodile maw protruding from the back of its head. This horn can open and bite targets, though despite resembling a mouth lacks a tongue or throat. With &quot;Pokémon X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;, it was reclassified as a Steel- and Fairy-type Pokémon, and also gained a Mega Evolution, Mega Mawile.

Mawile has been mostly well received since its debut, with comparisons being drawn to the yōkai futakuchi-onna. Despite its large mouth-like horn, it has been praised for its cuteness and cited as a Pokémon popular with players, despite its gameplay capabilities being called niche and dismal. The addition of the Fairy-type and Mega Mawile transformation in &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; were also praised, with &quot;USgamer&quot; writer Kat Bailey stating that these changes helped both helped increase its popularity and served as an example of how well Game Freak approached gameplay balance as a company.

==Conception and development==

Mawile is a species of fictional creatures called Pokémon created for the &quot;Pokémon&quot; media franchise. Developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo, the Japanese franchise began in 1996 with the video games &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot; for the Game Boy, which were later released in North America as &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; in 1998. In these games and their sequels, the player assumes the role of a Trainer whose goal is to capture and use the creatures&#x27; special abilities to combat other Pokémon. Some Pokémon can transform into stronger species through a process called evolution via various means, such as exposure to specific items. Each Pokémon have one or two elemental types, which define its advantages and disadvantages when battling other Pokémon. A major goal in each game is to complete the Pokédex, a comprehensive Pokémon encyclopedia, by capturing, evolving, and trading with other Trainers to obtain individuals from all Pokémon species.

Originally called Kucheat in Japan, it was introduced in the 2002 sequels &quot;Pokémon Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot;. When designing the games, Game Freak initially wanted to not include any of the Pokémon from the previous games, with lead artist Ken Sugimori using this as an opportunity to push the concept of what a Pokémon could look like. To this end, he wanted to try more &quot;humanoid&quot; designs and also emphasize &quot;cooler&quot; ones, due to feedback the team had received that Pokémon was seen as too &quot;babyish&quot;. Additionally, while the previous &quot;Pokémon Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot; species were bound to simplistic designs for the sake of the related anime and toy manufacturing, Sugimori stated in an interview he said &quot;screw it&quot; and focused on more complex and fleshed out designs with these games. As the art team developed the Pokémon species, Sugimori would finalize their work and draw the promotional art, altering details as he felt necessary.

===Design===
Standing 2 ft tall (61 cm) tall, Mawile is a bipedal creature with a yellow body, with its legs flaring outward and stopping just before its feet. It has three-digit black hands with the coloration extending up to the elbows, while its feet are cloven hooves. It has large pink eyes, while the hair on its head resembles a bowl cut hairstyle with two tufts of hair extending downward on each side of its brow. A large black horn extends from the back of its head resembling a crocodile maw, with visible white teeth and a yellow spot on the upper middle. Mawile is able to open and close the horn revealing a pink interior; in this manner, the horn can act as a secondary mouth to bite objects. Despite its appearance, this horn is not a real mouth, with the developers clarifying in production notes it lacks a throat, tongue, and spittle. When introduced in &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot;, Mawile was originally classified as a Steel-type Pokémon. With the later games &quot;Pokémon X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; it gained a secondary typing, now classified as a Steel- and Fairy-type Pokémon. Despite having a feminine appearance, Mawile is a gendered species and subjects of it can either be male or female.

&quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; also introduced Mega Evolutions that allow certain Pokémon to temporarily transform through the use of in-game items. In Mawile&#x27;s case, it can become Mega Mawile, which gains additional height and now stands 3 ft 3 in (99 cm) tall while gaining considerable attack power. It gains an additional horn maw, each now protruding from the sides of its head and having a more rugged appearance. Mega Mawile&#x27;s body also gains a secondary coloration, with pink coloring now extending up its legs to just above its waist, while its arms now flare out just before its hands like sleeves and gain a pink coloration.

==Appearances==
First found in &quot;Pokémon Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot;, Mawile appears in several other entries. In multiple games in the &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise, Mawile is only capturable in one version of the paired entries, including &quot;Ruby&quot;, &quot;Sword&quot;, and &quot;Brilliant Diamond&quot;. In &quot;Pokémon X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; and onward until the release of &quot;Sword&quot; and &quot;Shield&quot;, Mawile can transform into a form called Mega Mawile while it is holding a Mawilite in-game item. In &quot;Sword&quot; and &quot;Shield&quot;, it is used by Gym Leader Opal, a Trainer that acts as a boss the player must defeat to proceed. In &quot;Pokémon Scarlet&quot; and &quot;Violet&quot;, it is one of many previously introduced Pokémon excluded. Mawile also appears in spin-off games in the franchise, including titles such as &quot;New Pokémon Snap&quot;, the &quot;Pokémon Mystery Dungeon&quot; series, and &quot;Pokémon Go&quot;, with Mega Mawile available in the latter two. In physical media, both Mawile and Mega Mawile have appeared in the &quot;Pokémon Trading Card Game&quot;.

Mawile also appears in the related anime. In particular it appears in the episode &quot;Once in a Mawile&quot;, where it is enamored with Lombre, a Pokémon belonging to recurring character Brock. Lombre initially shows no interest in Mawile until it evolves into Ludicolo. However, Mawile now has no interest in it and moves on to give another Pokémon its affections, much to Ludicolo&#x27;s surprise.

==Critical reception==
Mawile has been mostly well received since its debut. The staff of &quot;Inside&quot; cited Mawile alongside the Pokémon Gardevoir as examples of Pokémon that stood out amongst the &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot;″s cast for how cute they were, something they felt took players by surprise especially after the realization they were not strictly female. While they emphasized its cute appearance was meant as a trap for it to get food, calling its nature &quot;truly frightening&quot; and &quot;unbearable&quot;, they observed Mawile was still one of the most popular and desired Pokémon by players. Carolyn Gudmundson in a podcast for &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; meanwhile praised it as &quot;one of those Pokémon that&#x27;s more interesting from a design and story perspective than from [...] a battling perspective&quot;. She felt it was a fan favorite despite what she considered &quot;dismal&quot; gameplay, and enjoyed its presentation in the anime. Co-host Henry Gilbert offered his own input, enjoying the contrast between Mawile&#x27;s creepy &quot;jaw ponytail&quot; and more cute front. Cian Maher in articles for &quot;USA Today&quot; meanwhile expressed that the character&#x27;s strengths were in its design, stating that &quot;it&#x27;s still extremely cool&quot; that for decades people had assumed the snout-like horn on the back of its head was its true face, while its real face was &quot;actually really lovely&quot;, and praised how its lore-based design helped make it believable as something people could encounter in the real world.

&quot;IGN&quot; in their &quot;Pokémon of the Day&quot; series of articles expressed that Mawile had become one of their favorite Pokémon, calling it &quot;adorable yet exceedingly tough, evil&quot;, and &quot;reminiscent&quot; of Cubone, due to both &quot;sporting a large and bulky headpiece&quot;. They were surprised that it did not have more fans at the time due to its Steel typing, something that had been requested for some time by players. They stated that while it was not one of the strongest Pokémon in the franchise, they felt it was underappreciated and added it &quot;has a certain specific role to fill&quot;, and that it &quot;fills it exceptionally well&quot;. &quot;Kotaku&quot;″s Zack Zwiezen was critical of its design, calling it &quot;terrible looking&quot;. Though he praised the design of its rear mouth, he felt that its &quot;little, weird body&quot; was uninteresting and felt that it was as if another character design had been spliced to the larger maw. Despite his criticisms, he felt its gimmick was cool and appreciated the lore aspects, though expressed that for the size of its horn he expected Mawile to have a more muscular design due to how easily it carried around its weight. He discussed the fandom surrounding the character, including fan art, which he remarked made it hard to find an image due to the propensity of not safe for work content.

Kat Bailey in an article for &quot;USgamer&quot; cited Mawile as an example of the improvements &quot;Pokémon X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; brought to the games and refreshed the feel of older Pokémon. Calling it &quot;once a bit of filler&quot; from &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot; &quot;with the misfortune of having a set of jaws straight out of &quot;The Little Shop of Horrors&quot;&quot;, she felt the addition of its Fairy typing and Mega Evolution helped increase its popularity. She also emphasized how the improvements felt tailored to the character, stating that Mawile was &quot;emblematic&quot; of a &quot;nuanced&quot; approach Game Freak appeared to be taking to balance its games, one focusing on giving the characters the tools they need rather than sweeping buffs or debuffs. She further felt that Mega Mawile &quot;represents everything &quot;Pokémon X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; is trying to accomplish.&quot; Cian Maher in his own articles meanwhile stated that despite the improvements, offering his own praise for its Mega Evolution as one of the best of the franchise and its &quot;fascinatingly niche strategic values&quot;, he felt Mawile had become forgotten, even in light of its usage in titles such as &quot;Mystery Dungeon&quot; and &quot;New Pokémon Snap&quot;. He attributed some of this to the discrepancy between its design and its Steel- and Fairy-typing, and argued that its &quot;earthy colouration and weird snout with too many teeth&quot; made it appear more in line with the appearance of Ground- and Dark-type Pokémon in the franchise.

Mawile&#x27;s basis has been suggested to be that of the Futakuchi-onna, a mythical Japanese yōkai described as a woman who has a second mouth on the back of her head beneath her hair. Lucas Sullivan of &quot;GamesRadar&quot;+ observed this correlation, describing Mawile&#x27;s design as &quot;as macabre as it gets [...] somehow balanced between nightmarish and adorable&quot;, and questioned how such a design seemingly based on the yōkai made it into the Nintendo-produced game. Author Kate Hodges in the book &quot;Warriors, Witches, Women&quot; praised how well Mawile illustrated the concept in the &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise, stating that &quot;even her name echoes that of a gaping orifice.&quot;

<doc id="1309969" wikidata="Q141078" url="?curid=1309969" title="Gilbert Perreault">
<text>Gilbert Perreault (born November 13, 1950) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey center who played for 17 seasons with the National Hockey League&#x27;s Buffalo Sabres. He was the first draft pick of the Sabres in their inaugural season in the NHL. He is well known as the centre man for the prolific trio of Sabres forwards known as The French Connection. The trio helped the Sabres reach the 1975 Stanley Cup Finals.

He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1990. Known for his ability to stickhandle in close quarters, he is regarded as one of the most skillful playmaking centers of all time. In 2017 Perreault was named one of the &#x27;100 Greatest NHL Players&#x27; in history.

Perreault was a standout junior hockey player who went on to be selected to nine National Hockey League All-Star Games and two post-season NHL All-Star teams (second team centre), while winning the Calder Memorial Trophy and a Lady Byng Trophy, and being selected to the Hockey Hall of Fame. He played his entire 17-year career with the Buffalo Sabres and continues to be the all-time franchise leader in career regular season games played, goals, assists, points, game-winning goals, and shots on goal, serving as the team&#x27;s captain from 1981 until his retirement in November 1986. He led the team to 11 consecutive playoff appearances ending with the 1984–85 season.

Over the course of his 17-season career he accumulated 512 goals and 814 assists in 1191 games. Among his career highlights was the game-winning goal in overtime of the 1978 National Hockey League All-Star Game played at the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium. Perreault once totaled seven points in a single game, which remains a Sabres record. He also recorded the first power play goal and the first hat trick in the team&#x27;s history. He is the only Buffalo Sabre to wear number 11, with the number being retired in his honor.

==Early life==
Perreault began playing organized hockey at about age six. He preferred street hockey to playing on the ice and did not skate until he was eight. He began playing minor ice hockey at age nine. He played in the 1961, 1962 and 1963 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournaments with Victoriaville. He left home at the age of 16 to join his first junior hockey team. His first year (1966–67) of junior hockey was spent with Thetford Mines in the Quebec Junior A League. His teammates included Marc Tardif. The team won the league championships.

==Playing career==

===Amateur career===
After the Quebec Junior A League shut down, Perreault joined the Montreal Junior Canadiens of the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) for the 1967–68 season, the first of three years with the Junior Canadiens. His 49 points in 47 games helped the Junior Canadiens to a second-place finish. During his second year on the team, one that included future NHL talents Réjean Houle and André Dupont as well as future professional teammates Jocelyn Guevremont and Richard Martin, Perreault blossomed. His 97 points were second on the team to Houle&#x27;s 108 points, and they earned him OHA first All-Star team honours. As Perreault blossomed, the team excelled. In his second season, the team finished first in the OHA and won the 1969 Memorial Cup Canadian Junior championship. It was the first Memorial Cup win for Montreal since 1950.

After Houle moved on to become the NHL&#x27;s first overall pick, Perreault assumed the leadership role and compiled a 51-goal, 71 assist season, which led the team in both categories and place second in the league to Marcel Dionne&#x27;s 132 points. The Canadiens defeated the Weyburn Red Wings to become the third junior team to successfully defend their championship and the Memorial Cup. Perreault was named the Ontario Hockey Association most valuable player.

The record of the 1969 and 1970 Montreal Junior Canadiens in the playoffs was so outstanding it caused a change in Memorial Cup eligibility rules. Previously, all Junior clubs in Canada were eligible for the cup, but the Junior Canadiens beat a club from Prince Edward Island so badly in the playoffs that &#x27;Junior A&#x27; was re-organized into &#x27;Major Junior&#x27; and &#x27;Junior A&#x27;. Since then, only Major Junior clubs are eligible for the Cup.

===Professional career===
In 1970, two new franchises were awarded in the NHL — the Buffalo Sabres and the Vancouver Canucks. It was a foregone conclusion Perreault would be the first selection in the 1970 Entry Draft. The two new teams took part in a roulette wheel spin to determine who would get the first pick. Ultimately, the Canucks were allocated numbers 2-6 on the wheel, while the Sabres had 8-12 (The number 7 spot was neutral, meaning the pointer landing on it would have required a re-spin). When league president Clarence Campbell spun the wheel, he initially thought the pointer landed on 1 (in reality, the wheel had no number 1 spot) and started to congratulate the Vancouver delegation. However, Sabres coach/general manager Punch Imlach asked Campbell to check again. As it turned out, the pointer was on 11. Imlach had chosen 8-12 for the roulette wheel spin because it included 11, which was his favourite number. This was the first year the Montreal Canadiens did not have a priority right to draft Québécois junior players. Consequently, Perreault was available and taken first overall by the Sabres.

Coincidentally, Perreault had worn #11 throughout his junior career, and kept it in Buffalo in honour of the roulette wheel choice. As expected, he became an immediate star. He scored a goal in the franchise&#x27;s very first game, which was a 2–1 victory on October 10, 1970, against the Pittsburgh Penguins. During his first season, he led the Sabres in scoring (with 38 goals and added 34 assists) — a feat he would never fail to accomplish in any season in which he did not miss significant time to injury before his penultimate year — and won the Calder Trophy as rookie of the year.

Perreault developed a reputation as a superb stickhandler, and scored a goal on his first shift in a professional scrimmage. Bobby Orr once said of Perreault: &quot;His head and shoulders go one way, his legs go the other way, and the puck is doing something else. When I first saw it I couldn&#x27;t believe it.&quot; His popularity and respect surpassed O. J. Simpson in a poll of Buffalonians about the best Buffalo athlete. Phil Esposito once said if anyone was to break his 76-goal, 152 point season records &quot;It will be Gilbert Perreault.&quot;

Before the 1971–72 NHL season the Sabres drafted Perreault&#x27;s Junior Canadiens teammate, Rick Martin, with their first pick. The two jelled as a tandem with each scoring 74 points. Late in the season the Sabres traded Eddie Shack for Rene Robert. The trio formed one of the decade&#x27;s most memorable and exciting lines, known as &quot;The French Connection&quot; with Robert on right wing and Martin on left wing. They ended the following 1972–73 season sweeping the top three scoring positions for the team and leading the franchise to its first playoff appearance with Perreault winning the Lady Byng Trophy as the most gentlemanly player. In 1973–74, Perreault endured a broken leg that limited him to 55 games.

The 1974–75 NHL season was memorable for the Sabres&#x27; Stanley Cup Finals appearance. The Sabres finished first in the newly reformatted league&#x27;s Adams Division, and the French Connection members each finished in the top ten in league scoring. The Sabres defeated original six teams Chicago Black Hawks and Montreal Canadiens on their way to a Finals appearance against the Philadelphia Flyers. The Sabres lost the series four games to two. 1975 was the closest Perreault would come to winning the Stanley Cup.

===International career===
Perreault was named to the Canadian national team (&quot;Team Canada&quot;) that participated in the 1972 Summit Series against the Soviet Union. He managed to contribute two points in two games but left the team after game five.

In 1976, Canada hosted the first Canada Cup series. Perreault played with future Hockey Hall of Fame members such as Bobby Orr, Darryl Sittler, Bobby Hull, Guy Lafleur and Marcel Dionne. Perreault often played on a line with fellow Québécois Lafleur and Dionne. Canada won the series after beating Czechoslovakia in a best two out of three. He later played in the 1981 Canada Cup on a line with Wayne Gretzky and Lafleur. He was playing some of the best hockey of his career, leading all scorers with nine points in four games, when he was forced out of the tournament with a broken ankle. Canada lost the final to the USSR 8–1. Perreault was named to the All Tournament Team, despite playing in only four of Canada&#x27;s seven games.

==Retirement==
Perreault retired at the end of the 1985-86 season. Thereafter, pension changes came into effect significantly boosting the pensions of retired players who played at least 20 games in the 1986-87 season. He duly came out of retirement and still played effectively, scoring 9 goals in the first 14 games. He retired for good on November 24, 1986, after his 20th game.

He finished his career with scoring totals of 512 goals and 814 assists for 1326 points in 1191 games. At the time of his retirement, Perreault was the sixth leading scorer in NHL history. Along with the other two members of the French Connection, Perreault was inducted into the Buffalo Sabres Hall of Fame in 1989. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1990, and the Sabres retired his number 11 in the same year, having been the only player to ever wear number 11 for the Buffalo Sabres; his #11 was the first number retired by the Sabres. When his French Connection linemates&#x27; numbers were retired, Perreault&#x27;s #11 was lowered and raised back between Martin&#x27;s #7 and Robert&#x27;s #14, as the Buffalo Sabres retired the French Connection line as a group, marking the first three players to have their numbers retired by the Sabres. A statue of &quot;The French Connection,&quot; unveiled in 2012, is located outside of the Sabres&#x27; arena, known today as KeyBank Center.

Since his retirement from hockey, Perreault has remained active in the game, coaching Junior teams in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League. In addition, he also plays on occasion with the Buffalo Sabres Alumni Hockey Team for charity events.

==Personal life==
Perreault is married to Carmen, has two sons, Marc-André (born 1978) and Sean (born 1986), and still resides in his hometown of Victoriaville, Quebec. After retiring from playing, Perreault coached junior ice hockey, and invested in real estate. In his spare time, Perreault enjoys golfing, listening to music, and going to the movies.

<text>Philip Lee Eyler (born September 1, 1948 in Hagerstown, Maryland) is a former politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a New Democratic member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1981 to 1986.

The son of Donald W. Eyler and Helen F. Dern, he was educated at Bridgewater College, Carleton University in Ottawa, Ontario, and the University of Manitoba. He has several academic degrees, including a certificate in resource management from the latter institution. In 1975, Eyler married Paula J. Harper.

He was elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1981, defeating Progressive Conservative candidate Harold Piercy by 46 votes in the upscale north Winnipeg riding of River East. He was not appointed to cabinet, but served as Deputy Speaker from December 2, 1982 to February 11, 1986.

Eyler lost to Tory candidate Bonnie Mitchelson in the 1986 provincial election. The NDP have been unable to recover the seat in the intervening years, and Eyler has not sought a comeback in provincial politics. Following his defeat, he was appointed to the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism. Eyler currently resides in Kenora, Ontario.

<text>Strakonice (; ) is a town in the South Bohemian Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 23,000 inhabitants.

==Administrative division==
Strakonice consists of eight municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):

*Strakonice I (13,395)
*Strakonice II (4,527)
*Dražejov (1,384)
*Hajská (63)
*Modlešovice (188)
*Přední Ptákovice (2,190)
*Střela (85)
*Virt (77)
==Etymology==
The name is derived from the personal name Strakoň, meaning &quot;the village of Strakoň&#x27;s people&quot;.

==Geography==
Strakonice is located about northwest of České Budějovice. It lies mostly in the northern tip of the České Budějovice Basin, but the municipal territory also extends to the Blatná Uplands on the north and to the Bohemian Forest Foothills on the south. The highest point is the hill Velká Kakada at above sea level. 

The town is situated at the confluence of the Volyňka and Otava rivers. There are several fishponds in the territory, the largest of which are Velkoholský rybník and Blatský rybník. In the municipal territory there are the Bažantnice u Pracejovic Nature Reserve and the Tůně u Hajské Nature Monument.

===Climate===
Strakonice has a cool, wet, and temperate inland version of a humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;).
==History==

A moated castle on the Otava River was built by the noble family Bavors of Strakonice at the beginning of the 13th century, the first written mention of the castle is from 1235. The first written mention of the village of Strakonice is from 1243, when the Church of Saint Wenceslaus already existed and when Bavors donated a part of the castle and several villages in the vicinity to the Knights Hospitaller of the Order of Saint John. In 1318, Strakonice already was a town.

From 1402, the Knights Hospitaller owned the whole castle as well as the surrounding estate. In 1420 the Hussite commander Jan Žižka occupied Strakonice, but failed to capture the fortress. Strakonice Castle experienced an extensive reconstruction to a representation residence of the Grand Priors of the Order in the 16th century, the later modifications were minor only. After the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the castle lost its significance.

During the 19th century, the town was industrialized. In the 1860s, the town was connected with České Budějovice and Plzeň by railway, which helped its further development.

==Demographics==
==Economy==

Since the 19th century Strakonice was a main production site for fez hats and it also became an industrial centre known for its motorbikes and hand guns production.

Strakonice is also known for its brewery called &quot;Dudák – Burghers&#x27; Brewery Strakonice&quot;, located near the castle. It produces the beer under the brand Strakonický Dudák. The Strakonice Burghers&#x27; Brewery is the last brewery in the Czech Republic to still be owned by a town. The tradition of beer brewing in the town started in 1367 and the Burghers&#x27; Brewery was founded in 1649.

==Transport==
Strakonice lies the railway line of national importance heading from Brno to Plzeň via České Budějovice and Strakonice. It is also the starting point of the lines to Beroun, Milevsko, Blatná and Volary.

==Culture==

Every year, the town hosts the International Bagpipe Festival. The town&#x27;s bagpipe tradition refers to the famous work of Josef Kajetán Tyl &quot;Strakonický dudák&quot; (&quot;The Bagpiper of Strakonice&quot;). The festival has been held since 1967 and is one of the most important folklore festivals in the world.

==Sights==

Most of the historic buildings were demolished during the 20th century. The Strakonice Castle today serves as a regional museum and gallery. Its exhibitions focus on motorcycles, weapons, bagpipers and the traditional fez production. The Rumpál Tower serves as a lookout tower. Part of the castle complex is the Church of Saint Procopius. It is originally a Romanesque building, rebuilt in the Baroque style with Rococo elements.

The Church of Saint Margaret was built in the late Gothic style with many Renaissance elements in 1580–1583. Baroque modifications were made in 1777. It is among the main landmarks of the town centre.

The Church of Saint Wenceslaus was originally a medieval Gothic church, founded in the 1300s. It was rebuilt in the Baroque style in 1720–1730. It is a cemetery church.

The Church of the Virgin Mary is a pilgrimage church located in Přední Ptákovice. It was built in 1771–1774, when it replaced a chapel from 1749.

<doc id="1310015" wikidata="Q611158" url="?curid=1310015" title="Nissan Armada">
<text>The Nissan Armada (originally badged as the Nissan Pathfinder Armada) is a full-size SUV manufactured by Nissan for the North American market. 

From 2003 to 2015, the first-generation Armada was assembled in Canton, Mississippi based on the Nissan Titan. From mid-2016 onwards, the second-generation Armada has been built in Yukuhashi, Kyushu, Japan and shares the same platform as the Nissan Patrol, with American-specific modifications, and went on sale in late mid-2016 as a 2017 model. A luxury version of the Armada has been sold as the Infiniti QX80 (originally QX56). 


== First generation (TA60; 2003)==

The 2004 model Pathfinder Armada was unveiled on April 17, 2003, at the New York International Auto Show. Developed under Carlos Ghosn&#x27;s NRP (Nissan Revival Plan), development was done in September 1999 to 2003 under lead designers Shiro Nakamura and Diane Allen and chief engineers Yuzo Sakita and Larry Dominique. In January 2001, a final exterior design by Giovanny Arroba had been approved by Sakita, Allen, Nakamura, and Nissan executive management, with the final design freeze being completed in July 2001. It is assigned the platform code TA60.

Prototypes based on the Y61 Patrol were hand-assembled as mules from 2001, with the first TA60-specific prototypes being completed and sent to testing in early 2002. Design patents were filed in 2003, with production starting on August 14, 2003, and going on sale on October 1, 2003.

The Armada had a 5.6 L &quot;VK56DE&quot; V8 engine that made and of torque. This was mated to a 5-speed automatic transmission, and the Armada had a choice of either rear-wheel drive or four-wheel drive. There are some Armadas that are capable of using E85. It has a towing capacity of up to .

The rear door handles are installed on the &quot;C&quot; pillar as part of a Nissan design tradition that started with the 1986 Nissan Pathfinder. When the four-door Pathfinder was introduced, Nissan chose to conceal the door handles as a part of the &quot;C&quot; pillar trim to visually make it appear like a two-door truck with a camper shell, with conventional door handles on the front doors.

The switch to the Armada name occurred in September 2004 for the 2005 model year, where it received new badges without &quot;Pathfinder.&quot; The 2005 model year also included a backup camera.

Starting with the 2006 model year, the third-row seats receive a 60/40 split.

=== 2008 refresh ===
A facelift was designed through 2005, being introduced in early 2007 for the 2008 model year.

The updated VK56DE V8 engine now produces 317 hp (236 kW) and of torque with an improved towing capacity of up to 9,100 lb (4,127 kg) when equipped with towing package.

Standard features now include an 8.0 inch infotainment screen, an updated interior, a new front fascia and rear fascia, new headlamp and fog lamp designs, a twist knob ignition switch for the Intelligent Key System, a new one-piece roof rack design, and third-row seats that fold electronically.

The latest Nissan Armada Platinum edition features a 9.3 GB hard drive for storing music, and a CF (Compact Flash) memory card reader.

The 2011 model year Armada removed the SE and Off-Road trim levels and moved to a tiered system: SV (base trim), SL (middle trim), and Platinum (top trim). Nissan discontinued the use of the Armada platform for the Infiniti QX56 produced in Japan.

The 2013 model year added Bluetooth and satellite radio as standard on all models, Platinum Reserve trim package and an updated steering wheel. Navigation added NavWeather capability, Zagat Survey, Bluetooth audio streaming, one USB port, and a 40 GB disk drive. The Nissan DVD Entertainment System mounted screens in the back of the front head restraints.

The 2015 model year updated interior door panels.

The Nissan Armada (TA60) was sold in the United States (including all US territories), Canada, Mexico, and the Middle East in left-hand-drive only.
== Second generation (Y62; 2016) ==
Nissan unveiled the second-generation Armada at the 2016 Chicago Auto Show, and it went on sale in August 2016 as a 2017 model. This version is based on the Nissan Patrol (Y62), the platform also used for the Infiniti QX80, as moving the Armada and Patrol to the same global platform instead of the Armada sharing the platform of the American-built Titan saves considerable development cost. The Armada grew in length and width, but the wheelbase and height were moderately reduced.

The engine was upgraded to the VK56VD Endurance V8, increasing horsepower from at 5200 rpm and torque from at 4000 rpm. In addition to the Endurance V8, a seven-speed transmission was introduced to improve fuel economy and acceleration. The exterior moderately differs from the updated Patrol, which was introduced in early 2014. As with the previous generation, the Armada continued to offer 2WD and 4WD and available in SV, SL, and Platinum trims. It has been described as a large-sized, low-volume, but high-profit model for Nissan.

===2021 refresh===
An updated version of the Nissan Armada was revealed in December 2020. The front end was redesigned, with a larger grille and C-shaped LED headlights along with two new exterior colors. The taillights were redesigned as well and are also LED. Inside, the center console was redesigned, with a wider infotainment screen with wireless Apple CarPlay and wired Android Auto along with a wireless smartphone charger standard. Nissan&#x27;s &quot;Safety Shield 360&quot; became standard. Trim levels and powertrain remained the same with the SV getting leatherette seating with silky carbon trim, SL retains leather-appointed seating with wood-tone trim and new 20-inch wheels, and the top-of-the-line Platinum getting new quilted leather-appointed seating with birdseye maple wood tone trim, along with new 22-inch wheels and the base S will be available at a later date, although the 5.6 L V8 gained and of torque. A Midnight Edition, which treats the exterior to an under-the-radar, blacked-out color scheme, was also added. The updated Armada went on sale in North America in late January 2021.

For the 2022 model year, one-touch power-folding third row seats were added as standard equipment for the Armada Platinum. 

== Third generation (Y63; 2024) ==
The third-generation Armada was unveiled on September 3, 2024. It now has a V6 engine.

<doc id="1310027" wikidata="Q5294801" url="?curid=1310027" title="Donald Malinowski (politician)">
<text>Donald Marto Malinowski (March 14, 1924 in Lwow, Poland – May 16, 2003) was a priest of the Polish National Catholic Church and politician in Manitoba, Canada. He served as a New Democratic member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1969 to 1986.

The son of Stanley Malinowski and Marlyn Gajewska, he was educated in Poland, Scranton, Pennsylvania, and St. John&#x27;s College. During World War II, Malinowski fought against the Nazis in the Armia Krajowa, who supported Poland&#x27;s government-in-exile in London. He was wounded on three occasions, and was sentenced to death for refusing to sign an oath of allegiance to the communist government that came to power at the war&#x27;s end. He escaped from his prison to Sweden, where he remained for three years, gaining an appreciation for its principles of social democracy. He came to Canada in 1950.

In 1952, Malinowski entered a Polish National Catholic Church seminary in Scranton, Pennsylvania. He was later ordained as a priest, and married a nurse named Anna Glazer (the PNCC is a separate denomination from the Roman Catholic church, and does not require priestly celibacy). The couple worked in New York State before moving to Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1959.

Malinowski served as a chaplain at the Royal Canadian Legion, and was named the parish priest at St. Mary&#x27;s National Catholic Church in north-end Winnipeg. By 1972, he had been given authority over all churches in western Canada. In addition to his religious work, he was involved in developing a number of housing projects in north-end Winnipeg.

He first ran for the legislature in the provincial election of 1966, but finished a distant third in the riding of Winnipeg Centre. In the 1969 election, he won an easy victory in the north-end Winnipeg riding of Point Douglas, and became a backbench supporter of the NDP government of Edward Schreyer.

In the provincial election of 1973, Malinowski faced an unusual challenge from independent candidate Joseph Borowski, who had served in Schreyer&#x27;s cabinet before leaving the NDP in 1972. Borowski ran as a social conservative, criticizing the NDP government&#x27;s toleration of abortion services and suggesting that Malinowski was guilty of hypocrisy in this regard. Notwithstanding these attacks, Malinowski scored a fairly easily victory, defeating Borowski by over 2,500 votes. He was re-elected again by a greater margin in the 1977 election.

Malinowski supported Howard Pawley&#x27;s successful bid to become the NDP&#x27;s interim leader in early 1979, following Schreyer&#x27;s resignation. In the provincial election of 1981, he was re-elected in the redistributed riding of St. Johns. He retired from the legislature in 1986. Despite his long tenure, he was never appointed to cabinet (he once joked, &quot;cabinet ministers come and go, but I am always a minister&quot;).

A social democrat by conviction, Malinowski was an opponent of communism for his entire life. During the 1980s, Malinowski provided aid to Lech Wałęsa&#x27;s Solidarity movement in Poland via the Polish Relief Program, and also provided financial support to Polish refugees living in Austria. In 1988, he was made a Member of the Order of Canada for being &quot;instrumental in organizing the Polish Relief Fund during the early 1980s&quot;.

He died of cancer in Calgary in 2003. The Manitoba legislature held a moment of silence in his honour in 2003.

<text>Westonia is a small town located in the eastern Wheatbelt region of Western Australia, 10 kilometres (6 mi) north of the Great Eastern Highway. It is the main town in the Shire of Westonia.

==History==
Westonia came into existence with the discovery in 1910 of gold in the area, by a sandalwood cutter named Alfred Weston (17 May 1876 – 26 September 1924). Initially the area was known as &quot;Weston&#x27;s Reward&quot; and later as &quot;Westons&quot;. By 1915 there were two major mines in the area, and the population was in excess of 500. By 1917 the area, by then known as &quot;Westonia&quot;, had a population of more than 2,000. In 1919, low gold prices forced the closure of the mines, and many people left the area. Westonia was gazetted as a town in February 1926. In 1935 one of the mines reopened, but closed again in 1948, only to be reopened in 1985. The mine then closed once again in 1991. In mid-2009, it was announced that mining would once again commence at Westonia&#x27;s Edna May Gold Mine, with the first gold pour anticipated for May 2010, coinciding with the centenary of the discovery of gold in the district.

In October 2009, Westonia won the Tidy Towns - Sustainable Communities competition for the central Wheatbelt region. Westonia won the same title in October 2010, and was also declared the state winner in November 2010.

<text>Arts &amp; Letters Daily is a web portal which links to news stories, features, and reviews from across the humanities. The site is owned by &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot;.

==Content==
According to founder and former editor Denis Dutton, &quot;Arts &amp; Letters Daily&quot; was inspired by the Drudge Report but was meant to reach &quot;the kinds of people who subscribe to &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, who read &quot;Salon&quot; and &quot;Slate&quot; and &quot;The New Republic&quot;—people interested in ideas&quot;. Arts &amp; Letters Daily has in turn been the inspiration for similar &quot;idea based&quot; blogs such as Abbas Raza&#x27;s &quot;3 Quarks Daily&quot;.&quot;

Robert Fulford characterized its value as follows:
&quot;A &amp; LD&quot; does for ideas what the Bloomberg service does for commerce. It watches developments, sorts things out, tells you what you need to know. It doesn&#x27;t produce the profits Bloomberg brings in, but over time its ability to make connections may turn out to be even more important than the stock market.

==Design==
&quot;Arts &amp; Letters Daily&quot;″s layout, designed in July 1998 by Dutton, &quot;mimics the 18th century English broadsheets and a 19th century copy of a colonial New Zealand periodical, the &quot;Lyttelton Times&quot;&quot;. Three columns of links dominate the site: Articles of Note, Book Reviews, and Essays/Opinions.

To the left of the main columns is a series of links to other online content providers, as well as a section titled “Nota Bene&quot; (the Latin for &quot;mark well&quot;), which is the site&#x27;s fourth and final collection of daily links to articles deemed to be of particular interest.

==History==
&quot;Arts &amp; Letters Daily&quot; originated from &quot;Phil-Lit&quot;, a mailing list created in 1994 by Denis Dutton and D.G. Myers, which served as a symposium on articles and reviews found on the web. When the list reached eight hundred subscribers, Dutton suggested that the articles be put together on a single webpage.

&quot;Arts &amp; Letters Daily&quot; went online in September 1998. Dutton was assisted in operating the site by three former Phil-Lit subscribers: Sharon Killgrove of the Mojave Desert; Harrison Solow of Malibu, California; and Kenneth Chen, then a student at University of California, Berkeley. Still in 1998, A&amp;L Daily spawned a &quot;sister site&quot;, SciTechDaily, run by Dutton&#x27;s friend Vicki Hyde, a science editor and author whose web company hosted both sites.

By August 1999, A&amp;L Daily was attracting 250,000 monthly readers and praise from &quot;USA Today&quot;, &quot;Wired&quot;, and &quot;The Observer&quot;; the latter called it the world&#x27;s top website, ahead of &quot;The New York Times&quot; and Amazon.com. The site&#x27;s high-profile led to a bidding war among several potential buyers, in which the online magazines &quot;Feed&quot; and &quot;Slate&quot; competed with &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot;, and &quot;Lingua Franca&quot;. &quot;Lingua Franca&quot; eventually became the owner.

In 2000, Dutton asked Tran Huu Dung, a professor of economics at Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio, to serve as managing editor of the website. Though Dutton and Dung had never met, the two had corresponded via e-mail.

In April 2002 The Webby Awards granted &quot;A&amp;L Daily&quot; a &quot;People&#x27;s Voice Award&quot; for Best News Website. By August, &quot;Lingua Franca&quot; had declared bankruptcy, and &quot;A&amp;L Daily&quot; lost its only source of financial support. Dutton and Dung financed the site themselves until October 7, 2002, when &quot;A&amp;L Daily&quot; went offline.

On October 25, 2002, &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot; purchased it along with &quot;the assets of its parent company, which published the magazine &quot;Lingua Franca&quot;&quot; - and &quot;A&amp;L Daily&quot; came back online.

By March 2005 the site had attracted more than 2.5 million page views a month and was about to receive its 100-millionth impression.

In August 2007, &quot;PC Magazine&quot; included it among its list of &quot;Top 100 Classic Web Sites&quot;, crediting the site for &quot;pull[ing] together some of the most interesting reads available on the Web today&quot;.

On December 28, 2010, Denis Dutton died. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; commented that &quot;A&amp;L Daily&quot; sent &quot;tens of thousands of new articles to readers whose readership might otherwise be painfully small&quot;.

Evan Goldstein of &quot;The Chronicle&quot; and Tran Huu Dung continue to produce the site.

<doc id="1310044" wikidata="Q1366128" url="?curid=1310044" title="Block heater">
<text>A block heater is used in cold climates to warm an engine prior to starting. They are mostly used for car engines; however, they have also been used in aircraft engines.

The most common design of block heater is an electrical heating element embedded in the engine block.

== Purpose ==
Pre-heating of an engine is primarily used to make it easier to start. Added benefits are:
*The cabin heater produces heat sooner for comfort and to thaw the windscreen.
*Reduction of condensation of fuel on cold cylinder walls during start thus
** saving fuel and reducing exhaust emissions and 
** reducing oil dilution by gasoline scraped into the oil pan by the piston rings.
*The engine reaches operating temperature sooner, so the engine does not run rich as long. This further reduces fuel consumption and emissions.
*Less load on the starter and battery thereby prolonging their service lives.
*Less engine wear as oil circulation is improved.
*Reduces the need for a Remote starter, thereby further saving fuel and emissions.

Block heaters or coolant heaters are also found on the diesel engines in standby generators, to reduce the time taken for the generator to reach full power output in an emergency.

== Considerations ==
The vehicle operator must have access to electrical power. In cold climates, parking areas for residents, employees, or students, or paid public parking areas, may have electrical outlets.

The operator must disconnect the power cord before driving away. Forgetting to disconnect can result in damage to the power cord or the vehicle. After a snow storm, the cable may not be visible under the snow. Residential overnight street parking may not allow an extension cord to cross a public sidewalk.

The energy used to heat the engine adds a cost. However, the savings in fuel generally outweigh this cost, especially if a timer is used to limit the heating period to about 4 hours before the expected start time. Taking the needed precautions, a kerosene jet-heater can also be used to pre-heat the engine.

== Designs ==
Some cars are produced with block heaters from the factory, while others are fitted with block heaters as an aftermarket add-on. The most common type of block heater is an electric heating element in the engine block, which is connected through a power cord often routed through the vehicle&#x27;s grille. Some block heaters are designed to replace one of the engine&#x27;s core plugs and therefore heat the engine via the coolant.

Alternative methods of warming an engine include:
* Engine oil heater attached to the engine&#x27;s oil pan with magnets.
* Engine oil heater inserted into the dipstick tube.
* In-line coolant heaters, which are installed into a radiator hose to warm the coolant (sometimes with a circulation pump to increase its effectiveness).
* Electric blankets that are laid over the top of the engine.

Electric timers are often used with engine warmers, since it is only necessary to run the warmer for a few hours before starting the engine. Some cars pump hot coolant from the cooling system into a 3-litre insulated thermos-style reservoir at shutdown, where it stays warm for several days. While idling is commonly believed to warm an engine, for most it is not effective.

==Usage==

Block heaters are frequently used in regions with cold winters such as the northern United States, Canada, Russia and Scandinavia. In some countries where block heaters are commonly used, carparks are sometimes fitted with electrical outlets for powering the block heaters.

Testing in the 1970s of warm-up times for block heaters found little benefit in operating a block heater for more than four hours prior to starting a vehicle. It was found that coolant temperature increased by almost during the first four hours, regardless of the initial temperature. Four tests were run at ambient temperatures ranging from ; continued use of the heater for up to two hours more only further increased the temperature by up to . Engine oil temperature was found to increase over these periods by just .

==History==
An early example of pre-heating piston engines prior to start-up was in the 1930s in Northern Canada, where aviators flew with flight engineers who were responsible for preparing the radial engines for shutdown and startup to reduce the effects of subzero temperatures. The flight engineer was responsible for draining the oil into buckets at night, and preheating the engine and buckets of oil using a blanket wrapped around the engine and a device known as a blow pot – essentially a kerosene jet-heater used for several hours prior to flight.

During World War II, German pilots could not stop the oil freezing in the engines of their Messerschmitt Bf 109 planes because of the extreme cold first experienced in the 1941 winter campaign in the Soviet Union. A captured Soviet airman showed them how pouring aviation fuel into the aircraft&#x27;s oil sump would thaw the oil. Another solution, also learned from the Soviets, was to ignite fuel in the space around the engine.

An early automotive use was the &quot;head bolt heater&quot;, invented by Andrew Freeman in the United States and patented on 8 November 1949. These early heaters replaced one of the engine&#x27;s head bolts with a hollow, threaded shank containing a resistive heating element. Before the block heater was introduced, people used a variety of methods to warm engines before starting them, such as pouring hot water on the engine block or draining the engine&#x27;s oil for storage inside overnight. Some even shoveled embers underneath their vehicle&#x27;s engine to obtain the same effect.

This super-eruption of approximately occurred 2.1 (million years ago) and produced 2,500 times as much ash as the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. Island Park Caldera has the smaller and younger Henry&#x27;s Fork Caldera nested inside it.

The caldera clearly visible today is the later Henry&#x27;s Fork Caldera, which is the source of the Mesa Falls Tuff. It was formed 1.3 Ma in an eruption of more than . The two nested calderas share the same rim on their western sides, but the older Island Park Caldera is much larger and more oval and extends well into Yellowstone National Park. The Island Park Caldera is sometimes referred to as the First Phase Yellowstone Caldera or the Huckleberry Ridge Caldera.

To the southwest of the caldera lies the Snake River Plain, which was formed by a succession of older calderas marking the path of the Yellowstone hotspot. The plain is a depression, sinking under the weight of the volcanic rocks that formed it, through which the Snake River winds. Other observable volcanic features in the plain include: the Menan Buttes, the Big Southern Butte, Craters of the Moon, the Wapi Lava Field and Hell&#x27;s Half Acre.

These calderas are in an area called Island Park that is known for beautiful forests, large springs, clear streams, waterfalls, lakes, ponds, marshes, wildlife, and fishing. Harriman State Park is located in the caldera. Snowmobiling, fishing, and Nordic skiing, and wildlife viewing are popular activities in the area. The peaks of the Teton Range to the southeast are visible from places in the caldera.

<text>Edward Elgar&#x27;s Violin Concerto in B minor, Op. 61, is one of his longest orchestral compositions, and the last of his works to gain immediate popular success.

The concerto was composed for the violinist Fritz Kreisler, who gave the premiere in London in 1910, with the composer conducting. Plans by the Gramophone Company to record the work with Kreisler and Elgar fell through, and the composer made a recording with the teenaged Yehudi Menuhin that has remained in the catalogues since its first release in 1932.

Even though Elgar&#x27;s music fell out of fashion in the middle of the twentieth century, and the concerto&#x27;s reputation as one of the longest and most difficult in the violin repertoire grew (because of its use of constant multiple-stopping, fast and unorthodox string crossings, and massive, rapid shifting around the instrument), it nevertheless continued to be programmed and played by acclaimed violinists. By the end of the 20th century, when Elgar&#x27;s music was restored to the general repertoire, there had been more than twenty recordings of the concerto. In 2010, centenary performances of the concerto were given around the world.

== History ==
Elgar had begun work on a violin concerto in 1890, but he was dissatisfied with it and destroyed the manuscript. In 1907 the violinist Fritz Kreisler, who admired Elgar&#x27;s &quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot;, asked him to write a violin concerto. Two years earlier, Kreisler had told an English newspaper:

If you want to know whom I consider to be the greatest living composer, I say without hesitation Elgar... I say this to please no one; it is my own conviction... I place him on an equal footing with my idols, Beethoven and Brahms. He is of the same aristocratic family. His invention, his orchestration, his harmony, his grandeur, it is wonderful. And it is all pure, unaffected music. I wish Elgar would write something for the violin.

The Royal Philharmonic Society of London formally commissioned the concerto in 1909. Elgar, despite himself being a violinist, called upon W. H. &quot;Billy&quot; Reed, leader of the London Symphony Orchestra, for technical advice while writing the concerto. Reed helped him with bowings, passage-work and fingerings, playing passages over and over again until Elgar was satisfied with them. Kreisler also made suggestions, some for making the solo part more brilliant and some for making it more playable. Before the premiere, Reed, with Elgar playing the orchestral part on the piano, played through the work at a private party.

 The premiere was at a Royal Philharmonic Society concert on 10 November 1910, with Kreisler and the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by the composer. Reed recalled, &quot;the Concerto proved to be a complete triumph, the concert a brilliant and unforgettable occasion&quot;. So great was the impact of the concerto that Kreisler&#x27;s rival Eugène Ysaÿe spent much time with Elgar going through the work. There was great disappointment when contractual difficulties prevented Ysaÿe from playing it in London.

The concerto was Elgar&#x27;s last great popular success. Of his later large-scale works neither the Second Symphony nor &quot;Falstaff&quot; nor the Cello Concerto achieved the immediate popularity of the First Symphony or this concerto. Elgar remained particularly fond of the work. His friend Charles Sanford Terry recalled &quot;I have never heard Elgar &quot;speak&quot; of the &quot;personal&quot; note in his music except in regard to the concerto, and of it I heard him say more than once, &#x27;I love it&#x27;.&quot; Elgar told Ivor Atkins that he would like the &quot;nobilmente&quot; theme in the &quot;andante&quot; inscribed on his tomb.

Even in the 1950s when Elgar&#x27;s music was unfashionable, the concerto featured frequently in concert programmes. By the end of the twentieth century, when Elgar&#x27;s music was once again in the general repertoire, there were more than 20 gramophone recordings of the concerto. In 2010, the centenary year of the work, the violinist Nikolaj Znaider began a series of performances in venues including Vienna, London and New York, with the Vienna Philharmonic, London Symphony Orchestra, New York Philharmonic, and conductors Valery Gergiev and Sir Colin Davis. Also in 2010 Philippe Graffin gave a performance at the Three Choirs Festival using Elgar&#x27;s original manuscript, and new recordings were issued by Znaider, Thomas Zehetmair, and Tasmin Little.

== Enigmatic inscription ==

The concerto is dedicated to Kreisler, but the score also carries the Spanish inscription, &quot;Aquí está encerrada el alma de ...&quot; (&quot;Herein is enshrined the soul of ...&quot;), a quotation from the novel &quot;Gil Blas&quot; by Alain-René Lesage. The five dots are one of Elgar&#x27;s enigmas, and several names have been proposed to match the inscription. It has been widely believed to allude to Alice Stuart-Wortley, daughter of the painter John Everett Millais. She was Elgar&#x27;s dear friend whom he nicknamed &quot;Windflower&quot;, and his love for her and her inspiration to him are well known. There is no definite proof linking her to the inscription of the concerto, although Elgar dubbed several of the themes &quot;Windflower&quot;, and in his letters to her he referred to it as &quot;our concerto&quot;.

Another possible inspiration for the concerto was Elgar&#x27;s early love Helen Weaver, to whom he was briefly engaged in the 1880s. Dora Powell (&quot;Dorabella&quot; of the &quot;Enigma Variations&quot;) suggested a third possible candidate, Elgar&#x27;s American friend Julia &quot;Pippa&quot; Worthington: Powell recalled an occasion at the Elgars&#x27; house, Plâs Gwyn, when she was looking at a copy of the score of the concerto:
I came next to the Spanish quotation ... the five dots caught my eye and a name immediately sprang to my mind. The Lady [&quot;i.e.&quot; Alice Elgar] came and stood by me, saw what I was looking at, and translated the Spanish sentence: &quot;Herein is enshrined the soul of ...&quot; Then she went on to fill in the name – that of a personal friend ... Mrs. Julia H. Worthington, a most charming and kind American friend. She was known to intimate friends by another name – also of five letters, and I cannot say definitely whether the composer had this name or her first Christian name in mind. Nor does this matter; the gap is now filled.

The Elgar biographer Jerrold Northrop Moore suggests that the inscription does not refer to just one person, but enshrined in each movement of the concerto are both a living inspiration and a ghost: Alice Stuart-Wortley and Helen Weaver in the first movement; Elgar&#x27;s wife and his mother in the second; and in the finale, Billy Reed and August Jaeger (&quot;Nimrod&quot; of the &quot;Enigma Variations&quot;).

==Orchestration==
Elgar&#x27;s violin concerto is scored for solo violin, two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets in A, two bassoons, contrabassoon (ad lib), four horns in F, two trumpets in A, three trombones, tuba (ad lib), 3 timpani and strings.

==Musical analysis==
Elgar said of the Violin Concerto, &quot;It&#x27;s good! Awfully emotional! Too emotional, but I love it.&quot; Like the vast majority of earlier violin concertos, Elgar&#x27;s has three movements. The Elgar biographer Michael Kennedy suggests that structurally the concerto is modelled on those by Brahms and perhaps Bruch. It is on a very large scale for a concerto, typically taking between 45 and 55 minutes to perform (see &quot;Recordings&quot; below for indicative timings).

===Allegro===
The first movement, in traditional sonata form, begins with a long orchestral exposition of the themes. Six related themes are presented, ranging through several keys, after which the first theme is repeated, first by the orchestra and then by the solo violin. This passage is described by Kennedy as &quot;one of the most effective and haunting entries by the solo instrument to be found in any concerto&quot;. The solo line repeats and elaborates the five themes, particularly the second subject which has appeared briefly in the opening orchestral section and is transformed in the solo part into the &quot;Windflower&quot; theme, &quot;of a poetic beauty exceptional even for Elgar&quot;. The movement follows the classical pattern of development and recapitulation, in which &quot;the interplay between violinist and orchestra is on an heroic scale&quot;, and ends with an orchestral flourish.

===Andante===
The second movement, in the key of B flat, has a shorter orchestral prelude, and is mostly quiet and songful, but rises to an impassioned climax. Kennedy calls it &quot;a display of sustained and noble eloquence&quot;.

===Allegro molto===
The last movement begins with a quiet but strenuous violin passage, accompanied by the orchestra, with many double stops and fast arpeggios; themes from the first and second movements are recalled and then, as the movement seems to be heading for a conventional finish, there is an unexpected and unconventional accompanied cadenza in which the orchestra supports the solo with a pizzicato tremolando thrumming effect. This cadenza, though demanding to perform, is not the usual virtuoso showpiece: it is the emotional and structural climax of the whole work. Themes from earlier in the work, including the &quot;Windflower&quot; theme, are restated and finally the concerto ends in a characteristic blaze of orchestral sound.

== Recordings ==

The first recording of the concerto was a truncated version made by the Gramophone Company, and released on His Master&#x27;s Voice, in December 1916, using the acoustic process, the technical limitations of which necessitated drastic rearrangement of the score. There were two 12-inch discs: D79-80. The soloist was Marie Hall, and the unnamed orchestra was conducted by the composer. Electrical recording, introduced in the 1920s, gave a greatly improved dynamic range and realism, and the two leading English record companies, Columbia and Gramophone, both made recordings of the concerto that remain in the catalogue.

 The first complete recording was made in 1929 for Columbia by Albert Sammons with the New Queen&#x27;s Hall Orchestra conducted by Sir Henry Wood. Gramophone hoped to record the work with Kreisler, but he proved elusive (believing Elgar to be a poor conductor) and Gramophone&#x27;s producer, Fred Gaisberg, turned instead to the young Yehudi Menuhin. The recording was made at EMI&#x27;s Abbey Road Studio 1 in June 1932 and has remained in print on 78, LP and CD ever since. These two recordings typify the two contrasting approaches to the work that have existed ever since: Sammons and Wood, in a brisk performance, take just over 43 minutes to play the work; Menuhin and Elgar, in a more overtly expressive reading take almost 50 minutes. Other recordings of the monaural era include those by Jascha Heifetz (1949) and Alfredo Campoli (1954). Both these performances are in the Sammons/Wood tradition, taking, respectively, approximately 42 and 45 minutes.

Many modern stereo recordings favour the slower approach of Menuhin and Elgar. Menuhin himself in his stereo remake in 1965 was slightly quicker (just under 48 minutes) than he had been in 1932, but Pinchas Zukerman in his two studio versions took a little over 50 minutes in his first recording and a little under 49 in his second. Both of Nigel Kennedy&#x27;s recordings play for nearly 54 minutes. Itzhak Perlman&#x27;s is slightly faster, at just over 47 minutes; and Dong-Suk Kang&#x27;s takes under 45 minutes. The slowest version recorded is with Ida Haendel and Sir Adrian Boult conducting the London Philharmonic Orchestra, at well over 55 minutes. A recording released in 2006 used a text based on Elgar&#x27;s manuscript score rather than the published version. Reviewing the CD in June 2006 the &quot;Gramophone&quot; critic Edward Greenfield observed, &quot;... the differences are very small ... I have to confess that had I not been told, I might have appreciated only two of them.&quot;

The BBC Radio 3 feature &quot;Building a Library&quot; has presented comparative reviews of all available versions of the concerto on two occasions. &quot;The Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music&quot;, 2008, has three pages of reviews of recordings of the work. The versions recommended by both the BBC and &quot;The Penguin Guide&quot; are those by Menuhin (1932) and Sammons (1929).

<text>Islam is very important to traditional Malian culture. Muslims currently make up approximately 95 percent of the population of Mali. The majority of Muslims in Mali are Malikite Sunni, influenced with Sufism. Ahmadiyya and Shia branches are also present.

Islam has been present in West Africa for over a millennium, and Mali has been the center of various Islamic empires, such as the Ghana Empire and the Songhai Empire. Mali was a French colony and now follows the secular French model in which the government does not intervene in religious matters.

Islam as practiced in the country until recently was reported to be relatively tolerant and adapted to local conditions. Women participated in economic and political activity, engaged in social interaction, and generally did not wear veils. Islam in Mali has absorbed mystical elements, ancestor veneration and the African Traditional Religion that still thrive. Many aspects of Malian traditional society encourage norms consistent with democratic citizenship, including tolerance, trust, pluralism, the separation of powers and the accountability of the leader to the governed.

There has been a surge in conservative interpretations of Islam in recent decades, particularly in Northern Mali where extremist groups have targeted religious minorities with violence. Despite this surge, many Muslim leaders have argued against the imposition of Sharia law. Christian missionaries have not observed any discrimination against Christians or other minorities in areas under government control, and have reported that the government has continued to adhere to the constitutional requirement to treat all religions equally.

==History==
During the 9th century, Muslim Berber and Tuareg merchants helped to spread the religion of Islam in the region, with the founders of the Sufi brotherhoods (tariqah) playing an instrumental role. Conversion to Islam connected the West African savannah through belief in one God and similar new forms of political, social and artistic characteristics. Cities including Timbuktu, Gao and Kano soon became international centers of Islamic learning.

The most significant of the Mali kings was Mansa Musa (1312–1337), who expanded Mali&#x27;s influence over the large Niger city-states of Timbuktu, Gao, and Djenné. Mansa Musa was a devout Muslim who was reported to have built various major mosques throughout the Mali sphere of influence; his gold-laden pilgrimage to Mecca made him a well-known figure in the historical record.

==Muslims in Mali==
Relations between the Muslim majority and the Christian and other religious minorities—including practitioners of African Traditional Religion were reported to be generally stable until recently, although there have been several cases of instability and tension in the past. It is relatively common to find adherents of a variety of faiths within the same family. Many followers of one religion usually attend religious ceremonies of other religions, especially weddings, baptisms, and funerals.

Since the imposition of Sharia rule in northern parts of the country in 2012, persecution of Christians in the north has increased significantly and has been described as severe by the Missionaries of Open Doors which publishes the Christian persecution index; Mali appeared as number 7 in the 2013 index list.

The implementation of Sharia in the rebel-controlled north has included the banning of music, cutting off the hands or feet of thieves, stoning of adulterers, and public whippings of smokers, alcohol drinkers, and improperly dressed women. Several Islamic sites in Mali have been destroyed or damaged by vigilante activists linked to Al Qaeda extremists who have claimed that the sites represent &quot;idol worship&quot;.

Some foreign Islamic preachers operate in the north of the country, while mosques associated with Dawa (an Islamist group) are located in Kidal, Mopti, and Bamako. The organization Dawa has gained adherents among the Bellah, who were once the slaves of the Tuareg nobles, and also among unemployed youth. The interest these groups have in Dawa is based on a desire to disassociate themselves from their former masters, and to find a source of income. The Dawa sect has a strong influence in Kidal, while the Wahabi movement has been reported to be steadily growing in Timbuktu. The country&#x27;s traditional approach to Islam is relatively moderate, as reflected in the ancient manuscripts from the former University of Timbuktu.

In August 2003, a conflict erupted in the village of Yerere in Western Mali when traditional Sunni practitioners attacked Wahhabi Sunnis, who were building an authorized mosque.

Foreign Christian missionary groups based in Europe have engaged in development work, primarily the provision of health care and education.

==Status of religious freedom==

The constitution provides for freedom of religion and does not permit any form of religious discrimination or intolerance by the government or individual persons. There is no state religion as the constitution defines the country as a secular state and allows for religious practices that do not pose a threat to social stability and peace.

The government requires that all public associations, including religious associations, register with the government. However, registration confers no tax preference and no other legal benefits, and failure to register is not penalized in practice. Traditional indigenous religions are not required to register.

A number of foreign missionary groups operate in the country without government interference. Both Muslims and non-Muslims are allowed to convert people freely.

Family law, including laws pertaining to divorce, marriage, and inheritance, is based on a mixture of local tradition and Islamic law and practice.

During presidential elections held in April and May 2002, the Government and political parties emphasized the secularity of the state. A few days prior to the elections, a radical Islamic leader called on Muslims to vote for former Prime Minister Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta. The High Council of Islam, the most senior Islamic body in the country, severely criticized the statement and reminded all citizens to vote for the candidate of their choice.

In January 2002, the High Council was created to coordinate religious affairs for the entire Muslim community and standardize the quality of preaching in mosques. All Muslim groups in the country currently recognize its authority.

==Extremism==
Extremists have been responsible for some reprehensible acts in Mali, most notably what has been nicknamed the Battle of Gao, in which an Islamic extremist group, Ansar Dine began to destroy various Muslim World Heritage Sites. The most significant of these was the Islamic mausoleum of Sidi Mahmoud Ben Amar and in mausoleums around the capital, including that of Sidi Yahya, militants broke in and destroyed Muslim tombs.

Many towns in Mali are falling victim to extremist groups’ implementation of their sect&#x27;s interpretation of Sharia law, by which many African cultures and enjoyments have been denied. A recent report in The Guardian revealed that extremist groups have banned music in certain regions and were known to turn up randomly in villages, armed with weaponry, to burn musical instruments and musical items on bonfires. One guitarist was threatened that his fingers would be chopped off if he ever showed his face in one town again.
On 18 May 2017, a man and a woman were stoned to death for living maritally without being married. According to officials, the extremists first dug two holes, one for the man and the other for the woman, then the couple was buried up to their necks and then four extremists started throwing stones on them and continued throwing until they died from their wounds. Public were invited to take part in this stoning. The couple was accused of violating Islamic law by living together without marriage.

<doc id="1310066" wikidata="Q2738893" url="?curid=1310066" title="Cubone">
<text>Cubone (), known in Japan as is a Pokémon species in Nintendo and Game Freak&#x27;s &quot;Pokémon&quot; media franchise. First introduced in the video games &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;, it has appeared in multiple games including &quot;Pokémon Go&quot; and the &quot;Pokémon Trading Card Game&quot;, as well as various merchandise. It has been considered one of the saddest and creepiest Pokémon in the series, with its concept being that it is wearing the skull of its dead mother. This story first appeared in &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; and has been redone in other works, such as the &quot;Pokémon Origins&quot; anime. It has also been the subject of creepypastas and theories, most notably a theory that Cubone is the baby of the Pokémon Kangaskhan after its mother died. It served as the inspiration for the Skull Crawler creature in the film &quot;&quot;.

==Conception and development==
Cubone is a species of fictional creatures called Pokémon created for the &quot;Pokémon&quot; media franchise. Developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo, the Japanese franchise began in 1996 with the video games &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot; for the Game Boy, which were later released in North America as &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; in 1998. In these games and their sequels, the player assumes the role of a Trainer whose goal is to capture and use the creatures&#x27; special abilities to combat other Pokémon. Some Pokémon can transform into stronger species through a process called evolution via various means, such as exposure to specific items. Each Pokémon have one or two elemental types, which define its advantages and disadvantages when battling other Pokémon. A major goal in each game is to complete the Pokédex, a comprehensive Pokémon encyclopedia, by capturing, evolving, and trading with other Trainers to obtain individuals from all Pokémon species.

Cubone is a small brown dinosaur-like Pokémon. It carries a bone in its hand, and has a skull it wears on its head. According to in-game Pokedex entries, this skull is the skull of its deceased mother Marowak. It is lonely and cries by itself, with its mask being stained with tear tracks. Cubone mournfully cries, which echoes in its skull to sound like a sad melody. The Pokémon Mandibuzz use this crying to prey upon Cubone. Cubone who survive in the wild long enough are able to overcome their trauma and seek vengeance, primarily against Mandibuzz. Despite its skull mask apparently coming from its mother, several pieces of media have depicted a Cubone&#x27;s mother alive simultaneously with a Cubone wearing a skull. According to Satoshi Tajiri, Cubone was &quot;born from the thought of how sad it would be for a Pokémon to die.&quot; Cubone&#x27;s English name is a fusion of the words &quot;club&quot; or &quot;cute&quot; and &quot;bone.&quot; It was originally planned to be called &quot;Orphon&quot; in English, but its name was finalized as Cubone. Marowak is more adept with its bone, using it as a club, and has grown more vicious. Marowak&#x27;s name comes from the English words &quot;marrow&quot; and &quot;whack.&quot; It was originally planned to be named Guardia, though this was changed prior to the final release. Cubone has been voiced by Rica Matsumoto in Japanese. In &quot;Pokémon Origins&quot;, Cubone is voiced by Cristina Valenzuela, while Marowak is voiced by Laura Post. 

An early Pokémon scrapped from beta versions of &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot; visually resembles Cubone and Marowak, and is widely theorized to be related to them. It bears a resemblance to the Pokémon Kangaskhan as well as Cubone, fueling pre-existing fan theories regarding the nature of Cubone&#x27;s relation to Kangaskhan.

==Appearances==

Cubone first appears in the games &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;. In the games, it inhabits the Pokémon Tower area, a gravesite for Pokémon. Cubone can be evolved into Marowak once it attains a high enough level. In-game, a Marowak is stated to have died while protecting its child from the villainous organization Team Rocket, and it subsequently haunts the Tower. The player can defeat it in battle to put its soul at rest, allowing the player to progress up the Tower. In the remakes of &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;, &quot;Pokémon: Let&#x27;s Go, Pikachu!&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Go, Eevee!&quot;, Cubone&#x27;s backstory is changed slightly. It retains the same story, adding scenes of Cubone being kidnapped by Team Rocket, rescued by the protagonist, and going to Pokémon Tower, where it gains closure by seeing its mother&#x27;s spirit as it ascends to the afterlife. Cubone is then taken by the protagonist&#x27;s rival, Trace, who offers to raise it. It eventually becomes a part of his team, evolving into a Marowak. Cubone appears in subsequent entries in the series, including &quot;Pokémon Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot;, &quot;Pokémon Crystal&quot;, and &quot;Pokémon Sword&quot; and &quot;Shield&quot;. In &quot;Pokémon Sun&quot; and &quot;Moon&quot;, Cubone evolved in the game&#x27;s main location of Alola can evolve into Alolan form Marowak, which have different typings and design in comparison to regular Marowak, being Fire and Ghost instead of Ground.

Cubone appears in the &quot;Pokémon Mystery Dungeon&quot; series. In &quot;Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team DX&quot;, it is one of the playable characters the player can select. The &quot;Pokémon Origins&quot; anime series features Cubone and Marowak, and goes into greater depth on the backstory of the Cubone and Marowak that appear in &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue.&quot; It also appeared in the film &quot;Detective Pikachu,&quot; where protagonist Tim Goodman attempted to capture it at the start of the film, only to fail. Cubone appears alongside Snorlax in a series of shorts titled &quot;The Adventures of Snorlax &amp; Cubone&quot;. Cubone appears in the &quot;Pokémon Trading Card Game&quot;, first appearing in the &quot;Jungle&quot; set of cards. Its first card was designed by artist Mitsuhiro Arita, who aimed to make his cards express the idea that &quot;that they&#x27;re living creatures, that they&#x27;re doing something, they&#x27;re feeling something.&quot; In the &quot;Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet—151&quot; expansion set, Cubone was featured in a card based on the &quot;Jungle&quot; set.

Cubone has received multiple pieces of merchandise, including a plush of Charmander designed to resemble it, as well as a plush with a removable skull.

==Critical reception==
Cubone has received generally positive reception, noted as a particularly sad and creepy Pokémon due to its backstory. Despite finding its backstory and the concept behind its design sad, &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; writer Katie Schutze found its design cute. As part of &quot;IGN&quot;″s Pokémon of the Day series, one of its writers discussed how much she loves it and how cute it is. She stated that, despite lacking in some ways mechanically, she cannot help but adore Cubone due in part to how sentimental its story is. &quot;Destructoid&quot; writer Ben Davis remarked how Cubone was always a staple in his team, stating that it was his favorite. He found Marowak cool, but felt that it had less charm than Cubone, so he never evolved it. When he played &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;, he imagined that the Cubone he caught was the one whose mother haunted Pokémon Tower, wanting to be able to be there for it. According to &quot;&quot; director Jordan Vogt-Roberts, Cubone was the inspiration for the &quot;Skull Crawler&quot; creature. He noted that they started from the design used in the original 1933 film &quot;King Kong&quot;, ultimately creating a creature with a &quot;bone-white face&quot; and &quot;black, scaly skin,&quot; realizing after the fact that Cubone had inspired the design. He exclaimed how much he loved Cubone, as well as remarking about how sad a story it had.

Cubone&#x27;s relationship with its mother has been the subject of discussion by critics. &quot;Fanbyte&quot; writer George Yang discussed how Marowak reminded him of his upbringing as a Chinese-American, specifically in how the Marowak that gave its life protecting its child. He discussed his feelings that Asian immigrant families will do anything for their children, and that this resonated with him through Marowak&#x27;s sacrifice. &quot;TheGamer&quot; writer Stacey Henley felt that it was one of the &quot;earliest, greatest narrative moments&quot; in &quot;Pokémon&quot;, arguing that this led to its story being featured in &quot;Pokémon Origins&quot;. In particular, the pair&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Pokémon: Let&#x27;s Go, Pikachu!&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Go, Eevee!&quot; has received praise. &quot;NetEase&quot; staff complimented the depiction of the scene between Cubone and its mother in these games, discussing how sad the scene was for many children back in &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;. They felt it was the most touching scene in the game, adding that it made the depressing scene in the original games more loving. &quot;Pocket Tactics&quot; writer Nathan Ellingsworth stated that this scene made him cry, and that it was among his most memorable moments in the franchise. &quot;Bloody Disgusting&quot; writer Cian Maher felt that the changes made to Cubone&#x27;s story were enough to make a big difference, feeling that the staff gave Cubone&#x27;s story &quot;some real love&quot; and described it as &quot;touching and bittersweet in the most heartfelt way.&quot; He appreciated that they gave more focus to Cubone in the story. Author Matt Coward-Gibbs discussed the presentation of Marowak and how its departure is handled, noting how resolving the situation through helping the Marowak find peace through reuniting it with Cubone demonstrated how the games depict a ghost as a way to heal instead of simply being a violent ghost to fight. He felt that it was an &quot;emotional highpoint&quot; for the games, and would be at home in a game whose premise centered around death. 

Due to Cubone&#x27;s backstory, it has been the subject of multiple creepypastas, with the glitch Pokémon &quot;M&quot; connected to it, Marowak, and Kangaskhan by theorists and creepypasta authors. A well-known fan theory exists that suggest that Kangaskhan is Cubone&#x27;s dead mother, and the baby in Kangaskhan&#x27;s pouch evolves into a Cubone, believing that the glitch Pokémon MissingNo. is connected to them. Theorists argue that they have visual similarities, justifying the theory. It is also theorized that Cubone eventually evolves into Kangaskhan. &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; writer Ashley Reed argued that this theory was credible due in part to the similarities between Cubone and a baby Kangaskhan, as well as the fact that both Cubone and Kangaskhan have a &quot;uniquely strong mother-child connection.&quot; It is speculated that this idea was dropped due to being too dark. Another theory suggests that Cubone was a baby Charmander whose parent died, with the argument being that Cubone&#x27;s plush with a removable helmet bore a &quot;suspiciously&quot; similar design to Charmander. Part of the theory involved the idea that Alolan Marowak&#x27;s Fire type may be due to this claimed connection.

<text>The Honda Passport is a line of sport utility vehicles (SUV) from the Japanese automaker Honda. Originally, it was a rebadged version of the Isuzu Rodeo, a mid-size SUV sold between 1993 and 2002. It was introduced in 1993 for the 1994 model year as Honda&#x27;s first entry into the growing SUV market of the 1990s in the United States. The first and second generation Passport was manufactured by Subaru Isuzu Automotive in Lafayette, Indiana. Like various other Honda models, it re-used a name from their motorcycle division, the Honda C75 Passport. The other two name candidates were Elsinore and Odyssey, the latter would be re-used a year later on a minivan.

The Passport was a part of a partnership between Isuzu and Honda in the 1990s, which saw an exchange of passenger vehicles from Honda to Isuzu, such as the Isuzu Oasis, and trucks from Isuzu to Honda, such as the Passport and Acura SLX. This arrangement was convenient for both companies, as Isuzu discontinued passenger car production in 1993 after a corporate restructuring, and Honda was in desperate need of an SUV, a segment that was growing in popularity in North America as well as Japan during the 1990s. The partnership ended in 2002 with the discontinuation of the Passport in favor of the Honda-engineered Pilot.

In November 2018, Honda announced that the Passport nameplate would return as a two-row mid-size crossover SUV slotted between the CR-V and Pilot. The third-generation Passport was unveiled at the Los Angeles Auto Show on November 27, 2018. It is built at Honda&#x27;s factory in Lincoln, Alabama, and available for the 2019 model year. 


== First generation (C58; 1993) ==
The first generation Passport was offered in three trims, the base model DX, mid-range LX, and upscale EX. DX models had a 5-speed manual transmission, rear-wheel-drive (RWD) layout and a 2.6 L four-cylinder engine producing . LX models could be had with an optional 4-speed automatic transmission, optional four-wheel-drive (4WD) and a 3.2 L V6 engine producing as standard. The upscale EX offered the 3.2 L V6 engine and four-wheel-drive as standard. Some first generation Passports were equipped with a rear axle built by General Motors. Others had a Dana built &quot;Spicer 44&quot; rear axle.

=== Model year changes ===
* In 1994, for the 1995 model year, the Passport received driver and front passenger airbags. EX trims gained extra equipment and features.
* In 1995, for the 1996 model year, the 3.2 L V6 was upgraded from to . A shift-on-the-fly four-wheel-drive system became available.
* In 1996, for the 1997 model year, the DX trim was dropped. The 2.6 L engine option was also dropped. All models now had the V6 engine.
== Second generation (CK58/CM58/DM58; 1997) ==
For the second generation model, two trim levels were offered: LX and upscale EX. EX had the spare tire below the cargo area and LX mounted in a swing carrier at rear. Minor changes for the 2000 model year included the introduction of an even more upscale EX-L trim which added leather seats, 2-tone exterior colors, and a CD changer. The LX trim received an optional set of wheels. 

In 2010, a recall was issued for affected 1998-2002 Rodeo and Passport for frames with severe rust issues. On September 22, 2010, NHTSA campaign number 10V436000 was issued to recall 149,992 vehicles because of excessive corrosion near the forward bracket for the left or right rear suspension lower link. If the rust damage was severe, Honda bought back the vehicles from their owners. 

== Third generation (YF7/8; 2018) ==

The third generation Passport was unveiled at the Los Angeles Auto Show on November 27, 2018, with retail sales starting in February 2019 for the 2019 model year. Unlike previous generations, it was designed in the United States and is manufactured in Lincoln, Alabama alongside the Honda Pilot. It is based on the third-generation Honda Pilot, although the Passport is shorter in length and loses the Pilot&#x27;s third-row seating. The Passport slots between the smaller CR-V and longer Pilot, filling the gap left when the Honda Crosstour was discontinued after the 2015 model year. The Passport competes against 2-row five-seater midsize crossovers like the Chevrolet Blazer, Ford Edge, Nissan Murano, and Hyundai Santa Fe.

Trim levels at launch included the base &quot;Sport&quot;, mid-level &quot;EX-L&quot;, &quot;Touring&quot;, and the top-of-the-line &quot;Elite”. Unlike most other Honda nameplates like the CR-V and Pilot, the Passport does not have an LX trim. Consequently, the price of the Passport in Sport trim started above that of the contemporary Pilot in LX trim. All trim levels included front-wheel drive (FWD) as standard equipment, with all-wheel drive (AWD) optional, except for the &quot;Elite&quot;, where it is standard equipment.

All Passport models are equipped with a 3.5L J35Y6 V6 producing and ; paired with a nine-speed, push button-controlled automatic transmission also found in the Ridgeline and Pilot. Front-wheel drive is standard; Honda&#x27;s all-wheel drive system, dubbed i-VTM4 (Intelligent Variable Torque Management), is optional, and features drive settings for Normal, Sand, Snow, and Mud. A two-speed transfer case is not available. Ground clearance is for front-wheel drive models and for all-wheel drive models and the Passport can tow up to .

Two rows of seats provide room for five passengers. There is of storage behind the rear seat, which increases to with the rear seat folded.

=== Marketing ===
On April 1, 2019, Honda released a YouTube advertisement for the 2019 Passport. The advertisement featured a 2019 Passport, called the &quot;Past-Port&quot;, with a first-generation Passport&#x27;s interior, touting features that were popular in the mid-to-late-1990s, including automatic power windows, an audio system with cassette player and cassette adapter and pager holder. The advertisement features an actor wearing 1990s-era clothing, and holding a Motorola cellular phone. Viewers of the advertisement could also call a special toll free number, 1-833-PAST-PORT (1-833-727-8767), where they would be greeted by a voice message from Fred Savage, and could then leave a voicemail on Honda&#x27;s microcassette answering machine explaining why they would like to own a 2019 Past-Port. The advertisement is no longer viewable on Honda&#x27;s YouTube channel as of May 2019, and the toll free number is no longer in service.

=== Model year changes ===
In 2020, for the 2021 model year, all trims received the 8-inch touchscreen and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto as standard equipment.

The Passport was facelifted in November 2021 for the 2022 model year with a new front end design similar to the facelifted second-generation Honda Ridgeline as well as the addition of a new TrailSport trim level that offers a more aggressive off-road-oriented appearance package. The TrailSport model receives model specific bumpers, cosmetic skid plate inserts, all-weather TrailSport-logoed floormats, as well as all-season tires with a more aggressive shoulder tread. For the 2022 model year, the Sport and Touring trims were also dropped, leaving a simplified lineup of three trims: EX-L, TrailSport and Elite.

In 2022, for the 2023 model year, the front-wheel drive EX-L option was discontinued from the lineup, making all-wheel drive standard on all Passports onward.

In 2023, for the 2024 model year, changes include a larger center console and new armrest. The top Elite trim has been replaced with the &quot;Black Edition&quot; trim.

=== Passport TrailSport ===

The TrailSport trim was introduced in September 2021 for the 2022 model year, and is the first TrailSport model in the Honda lineup. The Passport TrailSport comes standard with an all-wheel drive (AWD) system that is tuned for off-road use. Also included are more aggressively-styled tires, rugged exterior styling, a synthetic leather (leatherette)-trimmed interior that is easier to clean, unique orange stitching on the interior, and all-weather front and rear floor mats. The TrailSport is based on the equipment of the EX-L trim. 

In 2023, for the 2024 model year, the TrailSport receives trim-specific suspension retuning and all-terrain tires.

=== Safety ===
The 2019 Passport received a &quot;Top Safety Pick&quot; award by the IIHS.


==Fourth generation (YF9; 2025)==

On July 16, 2024, Honda posted teaser images of the 2026 Honda Passport TrailSport and said it would be release in early 2025. While still based on the Pilot, the model appeared to be more off road oriented. In October 2024, the prototype version was revealed. The official model was unveiled on November 13, 2024, with sales set to commence in early 2025 for the 2026 model year. Honda released the Passport on February 11, 2025. It is available in three trim levels: RTL, TrailSport and TrailSport Elite.

For the exterior, the design is based on the Born Wild concept with bold backpack design theme. It features LED DRL signature includes distinctive amber lighting for TrailSport models, an increased dash-to-axle ratio with a shorter front overhang, increased ground clearance with improved approach angle, and PASSPORT stamped on the front fascia and steel tailgate. The TrailSport model features all-terrain tires, orange heavy-duty recovery hooks, steel skid plates for underbody protection and a unique suspension tuned for off-road driving. The rear roof section features a unique matte black finish and the car&#x27;s antenna integrated into the passenger side rear glass replacing shark-fin style roof antenna.

<text>The Virginia–Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine (also known as the Virginia–Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine) is the veterinary school of Virginia Tech and the University of Maryland, College Park - both of which are public research universities in the Commonwealth of Virginia and the State of Maryland, respectively. The college was created as a joint venture of the two universities and their respective state governments in order to fill the need for veterinary medicine education in both states. Students from both states are considered &quot;in-state&quot; students for admissions and tuition purposes.

It is one of 34 colleges of veterinary medicine in the United States and is accredited by the American Veterinary Medical Association&#x27;s Council on Education and the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International. In 2011, the U.S. News &#x27;Veterinary Medicine&#x27; Ranking placed the college tied for 17th with Iowa State University in a poll of 25 ranked schools.

The college is considered a constituent college of both Virginia Tech and the University of Maryland. The college&#x27;s main campus is located on Virginia Tech&#x27;s campus in Blacksburg, with a branch on the University of Maryland&#x27;s campus in College Park. It also operates the Marion duPont Scott Equine Medical Center in Leesburg, Virginia. The college&#x27;s Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) program is designed to be finished in four years.

==History==
 Historically, there was a shortage of veterinary colleges in the southern and Mid-Atlantic states. In 1950, the state of Maryland began a contract to allow 10 Maryland students to attend the vet school at the University of Georgia in exchange for the admittance of 10 Georgians into the University of Maryland School of Dentistry. By 1972, Maryland expanded its relationship with out-of-state vet schools to include Tuskegee University, Ohio State University, University of Florida, University of Pennsylvania, and Cornell University. Virginia also tried to address the absence of an in-state veterinary school. In 1971, Virginia entered into contracts administered by the Southern Regional Education Board, allotting 15 seats to Virginia students in the University of Georgia&#x27;s veterinary school and two seats at Tuskegee University&#x27;s school.

In June 1971, the Virginia Veterinary Medical Association initiated a study of the need for and feasibility of a college of veterinary medicine. In 1973, a commission of veterinarians and members of the Virginia General Assembly found that Virginia did need a veterinary college to adequately meet its need for veterinary services. The commission recommended that this college should be a regional college, should emphasize service to farmers in Virginia, and should be located at Virginia Tech.

In 1978, the Virginia General Assembly officially established the college as a part of Virginia Tech, one of Virginia&#x27;s two land-grant universities. Meanwhile, in Maryland, the State Board of Regents decided in 1977 to establish a veterinary school at the University of Maryland, Eastern Shore; however, on May 11, 1979, the Board of Regents decided to join the Virginia school instead. In February 1980, a memorandum of understanding with the then-Virginia school stated that 24 slots in the entering class would be reserved for Maryland students and 40 places would be allocated to Virginia students. This founding class of 64 students entered the college on September 15, 1980 and graduated with DVM degrees in June 1984. The new college was fully accredited by the American Veterinary Medical Association in 1990.

The college opened a $10.5 million, 16,000-square-foot Infectious Disease Research Facility in November 2011 and completed a $14.1 million, 30,000-square-foot Veterinary Medicine Instruction Addition in the fall of 2012. Located on the Blacksburg campus, both facilities connect to the main college complex.

Starting with the Class of 2016, the college expanded the number of students in its DVM program. Of the 120 anticipated spots, 50 are reserved for Virginia residents and 30 for Maryland residents. The remaining spots are for at-large applications and include space for up to six West Virginia residents under a new agreement.

==Academics==
The Virginia–Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine offers students a DVM degree or an M.S. or Ph.D. in biomedical and veterinary sciences. The college also has a joint program with the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine that leads to a master of public health. In addition to these degrees, students may participate in residency and internships in their desired fields of interest.

===Rankings===

The College of Veterinary Medicine has a highly reputed Veterinary Medicine program and is one of a handful of core recruiting schools for some of the most selective assignments. Listed below is the 2015 ranking by the U.S. News &amp; World Report:
*Veterinary Medicine: No. 19 U.S. News &amp; World Report 2014 Best Graduate Schools.

===Doctor of Veterinary Medicine program===
The college offers a four-year full-time program leading to the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) degree. In 2016, it launched a new DVM curriculum that integrates the basic and clinical sciences, incorporates team-based learning, and allows for early entry into the clinics. Veterinary students complete three years of classroom instruction and 12 months of clinical rotations in total. The curriculum also allows students to choose a track in small animal, food animal, equine, mixed species, or public/corporate veterinary medicine.

Over the past five years, the Virginia–Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine&#x27;s DVM program has had over 97 percent of its students pass the North American Veterinary Licensing Examination (NAVLE). In 2013–14, all of the college&#x27;s 95 graduating students passed the exam.

===Biomedical and Veterinary Sciences program===
The Biomedical and Veterinary Sciences program is part of the Graduate School at Virginia Tech. The program offers a Ph.D. degree that requires 90 credit hours of course work, research, and a dissertation. The Ph.D. can be completed in four years, and prospective students do not need a master&#x27;s degree to apply. The master&#x27;s degree requires 30 credit hours of coursework, research, and a thesis and can be completed in two years. The college also has a dual-degree program that leads to both a DVM and Ph.D. in six years. In this program, students can pursue research opportunities in biomedical and/or clinical studies.

===Master of Public Health===
In collaboration with the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine, the veterinary college offers a Master of Public Health professional degree program through the Department of Population Health Sciences. The program is the first of its kind to be accredited at a veterinary college.

===Residency and Internships===
The Virginia–Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine provides students with discipline-specific residency programs. All residents must complete a graduate degree (M.S. or Ph.D.). Small-animal clinical residencies and large-animal clinical residencies are designed to provide three to four years of advanced training in specific disciplines in preparation for certification examination by appropriate specialty boards within the veterinary profession. The biomedical sciences and pathobiology residencies, which are part of a combined residency/Ph.D. program, prepare graduates for careers in veterinary clinical pathology or anatomic pathology. The Marion duPont Scott Equine Medical Center offers residency programs in equine internal medicine and surgery. These programs are fully approved by the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine and the American College of Veterinary Surgery.

Internships at the veterinary college are designed to provide post-DVM students with the opportunity for experience in advanced diagnostic and therapeutic techniques in medicine and surgery as well as seminary and manuscript preparation. Internships are also aimed at providing students with training and experience in clinical instruction and preparing them for residency and graduate study or clinical practice.

==Hospitals==
Students of the Virginia–Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine can gain veterinary experience by working in one of the college&#x27;s hospitals: the Veterinary Teaching Hospital, which comprises the Small Animal Hospital and the Harry T. Peters Large Animal Hospital, or the Marion duPont Scott Equine Medical Center.

===Veterinary Teaching Hospital===
The Veterinary Teaching Hospital, which comprises the Small Animal Hospital and the Harry T. Peters, Jr. Large Animal Hospital, provides care to clients in the surrounding area. Since the hospital focuses on teaching, residents and interns work closely with clinical faculty members to provide care to small and large animals. Veterinary students in the DVM program participate in three-week clerkships designed to give them hands-on experience; these students welcome patients, record a case history, and conduct the initial examination of the animal prior to consulting with the supervising veterinarian.

===Marion duPont Scott Equine Medical Center===
The Marion DuPont Scott Equine Medical Center is a full-service equine hospital located in Leesburg, Virginia. The center, which opened in 1984, has board-certified veterinarians in internal medicine, surgery, and sports medicine as well as veterinarians in residency training programs and licensed veterinary technicians. Since the center&#x27;s inception, faculty members have helped develop Marquis, the first FDA-approved treatment for equine protozoal myelitis, and GastroGard, a treatment for gastric ulcers.

==Research==
Students may also gain experience through the college&#x27;s various research centers, which are spread out across Virginia and Maryland. Under the leadership of the Office of Research and Graduate Studies, the college conducts a broad spectrum of basic/molecular and translational/applied research with a focus on animal health and productivity as well as human health and wellbeing.

Additionally, the school operates a library on its Blacksburg campus that is a part of the Virginia Tech library system.

===Center for Public and Corporate Veterinary Medicine===
The Center for Public and Corporate Veterinary Medicine (CPCVM) primarily supervises the public and corporate track of the DVM program. It also coordinates internship opportunities and provides summer fellowships for veterinary students from the United States and several other countries. In 2014, the center&#x27;s headquarters moved from College Park, Maryland, to Blacksburg, Virginia.

===Center for Molecular Medicine and Infectious Diseases===
The central theme of the Center for Molecular Medicine and Infectious Diseases (CMMID) is &quot;Animal Model of Diseases.&quot; The faculty specializes in using various animal models that include not only traditional laboratory animal models (mice and rats), but also non-traditional (chickens, pigs, dogs, fish, crab, equine) animal models. CMMID employs animal models to better understand the disease processes that impact both humans and domesticated species. The center is geared toward addressing current problems in public health that require the use of appropriate animal and tissue culture models, as well as gene-expression analysis.

===Center for Animal Human Relationships===
The Center for Animal Human Relationships (CENTAUR) is an academic center conducting instructional, research, and outreach programs designed to foster a greater understanding of the mutual benefits associated with human-animal interaction. It provides education, research, and service related to the therapeutic benefits of companion animals. In 2015, the center began a partnership with Saint Francis Service Dogs, a Roanoke-based nonprofit, to raise puppies for future service dog training and teach veterinary students about the human-animal bond.

===Center for Reproductive Excellence Using Advanced Technology and Endocrinology===
The Center for Reproductive Excellence using Advanced Technology and Endocrinology (CREATE) has three board-certified theriogenologists, each with their own research and species interests. The CREATE Lab offers advanced reproductive services—from breeding soundness and infertility evaluations to genetic counseling—for the following species: equine, bovine, canine, feline, ovine, and caprine.

===Laboratory for Neurotoxicity Studies===
The Virginia Tech Laboratory for Neurotoxicity Studies conducts investigations studying the effects of toxins on the nervous system. Currently, the laboratory is conducting interdisciplinary research in experimental neurotoxicology studying the effects of agents such as pesticides, solvents, heavy metals, mycotoxins, and nanomaterials in in vitro and in vivo models, funded by federal agencies and industries. Faculty with expertise in toxicology, pharmacology, neuropathology, and veterinary pathology conduct this work.

===Veterinary Medical Informatics Laboratory===
The Veterinary Medical Informatics Laboratory (VMIL) is an interdisciplinary research and service program within the Office of Research and Graduate Studies. VMIL studies conceptual and structural features of the medical information unique to animals. VMIL also assists in analysis and development of medical information models, databases, and systems. In addition to its research, VMIL acts as a service program by developing terminologies for veterinary organizations.

<doc id="1310083" wikidata="Q926029" url="?curid=1310083" title="Salvador Bahia Airport">
<text>Salvador–Deputado Luís Eduardo Magalhães International Airport , formerly called Dois de Julho International Airport and known by the trade name Salvador Bahia Airport, is the airport serving Salvador, Brazil. Since 16 June 1998, by Federal Law, the airport is named after Luís Eduardo Maron Magalhães (1955–1998), an influential politician of the state of Bahia.

It is operated by Vinci SA.

Some of its facilities are shared with the Salvador Air Force Base of the Brazilian Air Force.

==History==
The airport, originally called Santo Amaro do Ipitanga Airport, was established in 1925. In 1941 Panair do Brasil participating in the World War II efforts with the support of the American and Brazilian governments completely rebuilt the facility.

On 20 December 1955, the airport had its name changed for the first time: it became known as Dois de Julho International Airport, celebrating Bahia Independence Day. This is still the name by which the population of Salvador da Bahia call the facility. On 16 June 1998 the airport name was again changed to honor Luís Eduardo Maron Magalhães (1955–1998) an influential politician of the state of Bahia. This second change remains however controversial and there have been attempts to revert it. Since 2017 the concessionary has been using the Trade name Salvador Bahia Airport.

The airport is located in an area of more than 6 million square meters between sand dunes and native vegetation. The lush, bamboo-covered road to the airport has become one of the scenic attractions of Salvador da Bahia.

A brand new passenger terminal was opened in 1998, replacing an original outdated terminal. This new terminal continued to be upgraded and was completed by the end of year 2000. The main terminal, which includes a shopping mall has 69,400 m2, 11 jetways and a capacity to handle 6,000,000 passengers/year. Traffic has been growing at an average of 14% per year.

Responding to critiques to the situation of its airports, on May 18, 2011, Infraero released a list evaluating some of its most important airports according to its saturation levels. According to the list, Salvador da Bahia was considered to be in good situation, operating with less than 70% of its capacity.

Previously operated by Infraero, on 16 March 2017, the concession of the facility was won by Vinci SA, for which it paid R$ 2,35 billions (€ 640 millions). The concession is for a period of 30 years. The new concessionary then planned to duplicate the passenger terminal.

On 26 April 2018, the Aeroporto station on Line 2 of the Salvador subway was opened to the public.

<doc id="1310085" wikidata="Q1242222" url="?curid=1310085" title="Don's Plum">
<text>Don&#x27;s Plum is a 2001 black-and-white independent drama film directed by R. D. Robb, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire and Kevin Connolly. It was filmed in 1995–1996, and written by Robb with Bethany Ashton, Tawd Beckman, David Stutman and Dale Wheatley. The film takes place over the course of one night in which a group of young adults discuss life while eating at a diner.

The film was blocked from release in the U.S. and Canada, as DiCaprio and Maguire claim that they had only agreed to star in a short film but not a feature film. Blake Sennett of Rilo Kiley provided the soundtrack for the film. His bandmate Jenny Lewis has a role as Sara. It is the second film collaboration between Maguire and DiCaprio, the first being &quot;This Boy&#x27;s Life&quot;, released in 1993, and the third being &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, released in 2013.

==Plot==
The film follows a group of young men, around 20 years old, who meet at Don&#x27;s Plum, a Los Angeles restaurant, every Saturday night. The group often brings new women they&#x27;ve met to these gatherings. One of the main characters, Ian, a peculiar but somewhat charismatic young man, is seen at a jazz bar attempting to invite a woman to join him and his friends at the restaurant. After being rejected twice, he asks Juliette, a waitress he knows, to come along. Meanwhile, Amy, a young woman kicked out of a car by her boyfriend, hitchhikes and is picked up by Ian&#x27;s friend Jeremy, an aspiring actor. Jeremy and another friend, Derek, meet with an acquaintance, Leon. Derek takes Leon&#x27;s phone and ignores him as he unsuccessfully tries to call a girl, leaving Leon upset after Derek declines his invitation to hang out.

Another friend, Brad, who is bisexual, finishes sleeping with Sara and invites her to join the group, on the condition that he pretends they’ve just met. At the diner, the group introduces themselves and orders food from Flo, a waitress who, through internal narration, reveals her dissatisfaction with her job and her affair with the restaurant&#x27;s owner, Don, to secure a better schedule. The group engages in various conversations, but tensions arise when Derek insults an overweight woman, upsetting Amy, while the others mostly find it amusing. Derek and Jeremy begin to isolate and antagonize Amy, with Ian being the only one to defend her. Amy leaves in a fit of anger, briefly returning to throw a bag at the group. Sara’s friend Constance joins the group after spotting Sara through the window, and they continue their conversations, which include a minor argument with a man at another table.

Jeremy spots a prominent female producer he once auditioned for and introduces himself. She drunkenly flirts with him and suggests a meeting the next day for a sexual encounter. As the group watches a woman slap her boyfriend during an argument, Derek becomes particularly silent. Jeremy presses him for details, leading Derek to reveal his discomfort, rooted in his father’s suicide, which he attributes to his mother’s abuse. Derek retreats to the bar, followed by Sara, who empathizes with him due to her own familial struggles. The two begin to make out at the bar, but Sara eventually pulls away, which upsets Derek briefly. He apologizes and asks to be left alone, but Sara becomes aggressive, leading to an argument that ends with Sara breaking down in the bathroom over her personal failures.

Ian and Jeremy argue over Derek’s trauma, which escalates into a physical fight. Derek arrives and breaks it up. The group then leaves the diner, walking down the street in high spirits, excited about another night at Don&#x27;s Plum. In mid-credits scenes, Amy is shown vandalizing Jeremy’s car in retaliation, slashing his tires. Brad and Sara walk away together, with Brad expressing interest in seeing her again, while Ian and Juliette look forward to their next date.

==Cast==
* Amber Benson as Amy
* Scott Bloom as Brad
* Leonardo DiCaprio as Derek
* Tobey Maguire as Ian
* Kevin Connolly as Jeremy
* Jenny Lewis as Sara
* Heather McComb as Constance
* Meadow Sisto as Juliet
* Marissa Ribisi as Tracy
* Nikki Cox as Karen
* Jeremy Sisto as Bernard
* Ethan Suplee as Big Bum

== Production ==
Much of the film is improvised.
DiCaprio and Maguire were paid $575 per day to appear in the film.

== Release issues ==
DiCaprio and Maguire were opposed to having the film released. They claimed the film was pitched to them as a short film but was later re-edited into a feature-length film. Producer David Stutman said Maguire opposed the film&#x27;s release due to his improvised performance revealing too much about him.

Stutman filed a lawsuit in 1998 against DiCaprio and Maguire. They settled on allowing the film to be released outside the U.S. and Canada, and had some scenes removed.

=== Free streaming ===
In 2014, Dale Wheatley published an open letter to DiCaprio on the website &quot;freedonsplum.com&quot;, giving his take on the history of the film and the ensuing legal issues. Wheatley also uploaded the film to the website so that it could be streamed for free. It was removed in January 2016 after a third-party notification by DiCaprio and Maguire claiming infringement. Wheatley made the following statement to Fox News: &quot;It saddens me deeply that in 2016 we witness the senseless oppression of film and art by one of America&#x27;s most beloved actors&quot;. &quot;While the world celebrates — and certainly Americans celebrate — his great achievements in cinema, he chooses to use an iron fist to suppress the work of many other artists including him in a film made 20 years ago.&quot;

==Reception==
It premiered on 10 February 2001, in Berlin. &quot;Time Out New York&quot; writer Mike D&#x27;Angelo called it &quot;the best film [I saw] in Berlin&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; called it an &quot;unpleasant and tedious ensemble.&quot;

<doc id="1310090" wikidata="Q2089388" url="?curid=1310090" title="Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)">
<text>&quot;Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)&quot; (or &quot;Time of Your Life (Good Riddance)&quot;) is a ballad by American rock band Green Day, released in December 1997 as the second single from their fifth studio album, &quot;Nimrod&quot; (1997). It is one of their most popular songs and has also become a staple of their concerts, usually played as the final song.

&quot;Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)&quot; became a chart hit, peaking at number 11 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Airplay chart and reaching the top 20 in Australia, Canada, Iceland, and the United Kingdom. As of November 2022, the song had sold over five million copies and is certified quintuple platinum in the United States, sextuple platinum in Canada, triple platinum in New Zealand, and double platinum in both Australia and the United Kingdom, making it the band&#x27;s most commercially successful single.

==Background==
Billie Joe Armstrong wrote &quot;Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)&quot; in 1993 about his girlfriend named Amanda who moved to Ecuador, with him naming the song &quot;Good Riddance&quot; to show his anger towards her. He did not show the song to his bandmates until the &quot;Dookie&quot; recording sessions later the same year. During the sessions, however, the song was determined to be too different from the rest of the songs on &quot;Dookie&quot;, and producer Rob Cavallo was unsure of how to structure the recording.

An early version of the song (in a different key, with a faster tempo and sparer arrangement) simply titled &quot;Good Riddance&quot; appeared as a B-side to the European single for &quot;Brain Stew/Jaded&quot;.

When the time came to record &quot;Nimrod&quot;, Armstrong decided to record the song again, and Cavallo suggested they add strings to the track. He sent the band to play foosball in another room while he recorded the strings, which took &quot;like fifteen, twenty minutes, maybe a half an hour at the most.&quot; Cavallo reflected on his decision to add the strings &quot;I knew we had done the right thing. It was a hit the second I heard it.&quot;

==Composition==
In comparison to previous Green Day material, &quot;Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)&quot; features more mellow, contemplative lyrics with acoustic music. Band member Mike Dirnt said that the release of this song was probably the &quot;most punk&quot; thing they could have done.

The song has been labelled alternative rock, folk, folk punk, and acoustic rock.

==Album version==
The album version of the song begins with Armstrong messing up the opening chords twice, muttering &quot;fuck&quot; under his breath before starting over and getting it right, thus starting the song. The mistakes were deliberately kept to add a lighthearted introduction to a song with emotionally deep lyrics. Radio versions and the music video omitted Armstrong&#x27;s second attempt with the expletive.

==Music video==
The music video was directed by Mark Kohr in Los Angeles in November 1997, and is based on a concept by Armstrong. The video features Armstrong singing and playing an acoustic guitar in an apartment (filmed in LA&#x27;s Ambassador Hotel), intercut with &quot;pull-in&quot; shots of various people involved in mundane activities. All of the subjects are shown seemingly staring into space absent-mindedly. Dirnt and Tré Cool make cameo appearances in the video as a person pumping gas (Dirnt), and an injured bike rider being attended by paramedics (Tré). When the video came out, the name of the song was inverted, hence the video&#x27;s title is &quot;Time of Your Life (Good Riddance)&quot;. This title was also used on the single cover.

In 1998, Green Day won their first MTV Video Music Award for Best Alternative Video for &quot;Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)&quot; and they were also nominated for Viewer&#x27;s Choice.

The video can be found on their music video compilation DVD, &quot;International Supervideos!&quot;

==Legacy==
To the band&#x27;s surprise, the song became a hit at prom dances. Because of the song&#x27;s lyrics, which many graduating seniors interpret as nostalgic and reflective of their time in high school, it has become a staple song at proms. Armstrong remarked that, in retrospect, the lyrics make sense when viewed that way. &quot;The people that you grew up and braved the trials of high school with will always hold a special place. Through all the BS of high school, you hope that your friends had the time of their life, and that&#x27;s what the song is talking about&quot;.

The song is featured in the season nine episode of &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, entitled &quot;The Chronicle&quot; (also known as &quot;The Clip Show&quot;). The song plays in the closing minutes of the episode, which feature a series of bloopers, behind-the-scenes production, and a montage. It is the second-to-last episode of &quot;Seinfeld&quot; before the show&#x27;s series finale in 1998. The song was also featured in the ending credits of &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot;, playing with a montage of scenes and behind-the-scenes footage of several film adaptions, most noticeably from the &quot;X-Men&quot; film series

The song was played on ITV in 1998, when the England National Football Team was knocked out of the France 98 tournament, losing to Argentina.

On May 28, 2015, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named &quot;Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)&quot; as one of the 20 Best Graduation Songs of the Past 20 Years (1995–2015).

On August 14, 2024, All Elite Wrestling used the song in a video package on Dynamite, looking back on Bryan Danielson&#x27;s 24+ years of wrestling (excluding WWE) ahead of his Title vs. Career match with Swerve Strickland at All In: Wembley II.

<text>Open interest (also known as open contracts or open commitments) refers to the total number of outstanding derivative contracts that have not been settled (offset by delivery).

For each buyer of a futures contract there must be a seller. From the time the buyer or seller opens the contract until the counter-party closes it, that contract is considered &#x27;open&#x27;.

Open interest also gives key information regarding the liquidity of an option. If there is no open interest for an option, there is no secondary market for that option. When options have large open interest, they have a large number of buyers and sellers. An active secondary market will increase the odds of getting option orders filled at good prices. All other things being equal, the larger the open interest, the easier it will be to trade that option at a reasonable spread between the bid and ask.

==As a confirming indicator==
An increase in open interest along with an increase in price is said by proponents of technical analysis to confirm an upward trend. Similarly, an increase in open interest along with a decrease in price confirms a downward trend. An increase or decrease in prices while open interest remains flat or declining may indicate a possible trend reversal.

The relationship between the prevailing price trend and open interest can be summarized by the following table:

<text>Everybody Loves You is the debut album by American guitarist Kaki King, released in 2003 (see 2003 in music).

==Reception==

In his review for Allmusic, critic Thom Jurek wrote that &quot;Simply put, Kaki King possesses the most original voice on the acoustic guitar in a generation. Her sound, full of gorgeous tapped melodies and popping basslines, is as deeply emotional as John Fahey&#x27;s, as technically savvy as Preston Reed&#x27;s, and as energetic as Leo Kottke&#x27;s (à la 6- and 12-String Guitar, Greenhouse, and Mudlark). Citing these legendary players is not for the sake of comparison in style or approach, but in metaphor only for she sounds only like herself... Everybody Loves You is the most auspicious, tender, and tough instrumental debut by any guitarist in a decade at least. It is singular in approach and peerless in execution; and in its poetic, raggedly graceful manner, it is simply a treasure of individuality and idiosyncratic virtuosity, visceral truth, and verve.&quot;

<text>Paul Wong Koon-chung (born 黃貫中; 31 March 1964), known professionally as Paul Wong, is a Hong Kong musician, singer, songwriter and record producer. He achieved fame in Asia as the lead guitarist of the rock band Beyond until the band disbanded in 2005. After lead vocalist Wong Ka Kui&#x27;s death, Wong became the lead vocalist and main songwriter for Beyond. He also earned the award &quot;The Best Rock Singer&quot; of the Hit Awards in 2012.

==Biography==
===1964–2005: Early life and Beyond===
Paul Wong was born on 31 March 1964, growing up with father, mother and two younger brothers in Kowloon City. Still, his mother later lived separately from her husband and children as his parents divorced.

As a juvenile, he was the champion at a couple of art contests. Until he majored in design at Hong Kong Polytechnic College, he was invited by drummer Yip Sai Wing to handle a design project for Beyond&#x27;s first concert. Later he became friends with them as well as a member replacing the former lead guitarist Chan Sze On. While he worked as a designer at an advertising company, he was meantime in progress of several pieces of design work, such as the envelope design of the cassette &quot;Goodbye Ideals&quot; (1986) and the clothing design for &quot;Contact of Life Concert&quot; (1991).

Regarding his vocal contribution to Beyond, he started off as the lead vocalist singing the lead on &quot;Midnight Stray&quot; (1988). In the same year, he later provided lead vocals on &quot;The Ground&quot;, one of the band&#x27;s big hits. Besides, he began to play roles in different television series, including &quot;Two of a Kind&quot; featuring Hacken Lee and Wong in the leading roles.

On 30 June 1993, the mainstay of Beyond Wong Ka Kui was deceased. Thereafter the remaining three members switched to Rock Records making the band&#x27;s next album &quot;The 2nd Floor Flat&quot; (1994). After Wong Ka Kui&#x27;s death, Paul Wong and Wong Ka Keung became the band&#x27;s primary songwriters. In circa 1999, the media told that Paul Wong and Wong Ka Keung had discorded due to the difference between their musical ideas. Beyond in 2003 resumed conducting the concerts &quot;Beyond Beyond Beyond Live&quot;. Still, they held the band&#x27;s final and break-up concert &quot;Beyond The Story Live&quot; in 2005.

===1999–present: Solo career===
In late 1999, Wong launched his work as a solo singer while Beyond was taking a break. He formed the band Hann consisting of Jun Kung, Mak Man Wai (member of LMF) and Dino Acconci from the band Soler. Later on Wong established his own studio Polar Bear Studio. Afterward he signed a contract with Universal Records and then released &quot;Yellow Paul Wong&quot; (2001) and &quot;Black White&quot; (2001) in order. By these two albums, he won &quot;The Gold Award as a Singer-songwriter&quot; in Ultimate Song Chart Awards Presentation (2001 &amp; 2002).

Wong showed his interest in musicals. In 2000 he played the protagonist Tony in the musical &quot;The Dream Broken in Victoria Harbour&quot; by troupe Theatre Space. The story was adapted from a broadway musical &quot;West Side Story&quot;, which was localised and whose background was moved to Hong Kong. At the performances, local conductor Henry Shek took the lead and played with Hong Kong New Philharmonic Symphonic Orchestra as all performers at the seashore of Hong Kong Cultural Centre.

In November 2002 Wong held his debut concert &quot;Play It Loud&quot; in Hong Kong Coliseum. After the contract with Universal had ended, he issued an album &quot;Existence&quot; (2004), where he invested in by himself.

In 2005 by the dissolution of Beyond, they ran eight sessions of &quot;Beyond The Story Live 2005&quot; at Hong Kong Coliseum, which is the band&#x27;s last world tour. Consequently, he worked as the musical supervisor for the musical &quot;Akapi Shooting Incident&quot; by Commercial Radio Hong Kong, in which Sammy Leung and Kitty Yuen engaged and Wong also wrote a few soundtracks.

In April 2006, Wong signed a contract with Chinese Warner Records to explore the market of the Mainland China. In October he conducted solo concerts at Hong Kong Coliseum, namely &quot;Paul Wong Hong Kong Concert 2006: The Music of Madman&#x27;s Study&quot;.

<doc id="1310159" wikidata="Q374536" url="?curid=1310159" title="Rik Smits">
<text>Rik Smits (born 23 August 1966), nicknamed &quot;the Dunking Dutchman&quot; is a Dutch former professional basketball player who spent his entire career with the Indiana Pacers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The center was drafted by the Pacers out of Marist College with the second overall pick in the 1988 NBA draft. An NBA All-Star in 1998, Smits reached the NBA Finals in 2000.

==Early life and college career==

Smits was born in Eindhoven. He started playing basketball at age 14 at PSV–Almonte in Eindhoven. Smits left for the United States in 1984, where he played for Marist College for four years.

In 1986, Smits led Marist to the ECAC Metro Conference tournament Championship and advanced to play in their first NCAA tournament in school history. In 1987, he led the Red Foxes to 20 wins for the first time in its Division I history and another appearance in the NCAA tournament.

Smits briefly appeared in the 1988 film &quot;Coming to America&quot; during a scene filmed in 1987 while Marist played against St. John&#x27;s at Madison Square Garden.

Smits was drafted second overall in the 1988 NBA draft by the Indiana Pacers, becoming the first Marist player to play in the NBA. His #45 jersey was later retired by Marist.

==NBA career==
He spent his entire professional career playing for the Indiana Pacers. With the Pacers, Smits originally backed up Steve Stipanovich, but when Stipanovich suffered a career-ending injury, Smits ended up starting 71 games in his rookie year, averaging 11.7 points and 6.1 rebounds per game and earning All-Rookie First Team honors. Smits continued to average double-digit point totals in every year of his career, but it wasn&#x27;t until the 1993–94 NBA season that Smits really came into his own as a team leader.

Throughout the Pacers&#x27; playoff runs in the mid and late 1990s, Smits was considered the number two player, behind Reggie Miller, on the deeply talented Pacers. Smits&#x27; highest point-per-game average was in 1995–96 when he averaged 18.5 points per game. That season, on December 10, Smits scored a career-high 44 points during a 111–104 win over the Los Angeles Clippers. He was relatively modest by NBA &quot;superstar&quot; standards, but the Dutchman endeared himself to Pacers fans with outstanding playoff performances, most notably in Game 4 of the 1995 Eastern Conference Finals, where he made a buzzer-beating shot to tie the series.

Smits was named to the Eastern Conference All-Star Team in 1998, delivering ten points, seven rebounds and four assists, including a behind-the-back pass to New Jersey Nets forward Jayson Williams who followed immediately with a slam dunk.

Smits developed nerve damage in his feet from wearing tight shoes as a teenager. To help recover during the off-season, he spent time relaxing at his summer retreat in Walton, New York, where he was a regular attendee of The Afton Fair. Foot problems hobbled Smits for the majority of his career, and he retired at the conclusion of the Pacers&#x27; 1999–2000 season, after Indiana was defeated by the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA Finals 4 games to 2.
After four surgeries to repair nerve damage to his feet, Smits underwent intensive back surgery in November 2009 to correct cracks in one joint that link his vertebrae. Smits has also undergone arthroscopic surgery on his left knee and had bone chips removed from his left ankle.

Smits was selected to the Pacers&#x27; 40th Anniversary Team, chosen by the fans. He ended up with the fourth most votes, trailing only Reggie Miller, Mel Daniels and Jermaine O&#x27;Neal.

==National team career==
Smits has also played for the senior Netherlands national team. He played in the 1986 FIBA World Championship and EuroBasket 1987.

==Life after the NBA==
After his retirement, Smits has devoted his time to collecting and racing vintage motocross motorcycles. On 30 November 2011, Smits was featured in Yahoo! Sports, about his formal participation in competitive motocross racing. In 2008 Smits won the AHRMA Vintage National Premier 500 Intermediate Class riding a BSA 500.

In 1998, near the end of his playing career, Smits bought a home in the Indianapolis suburb of Zionsville, Indiana, and continued to live in the home for nearly 20 years, expanding it in 2014 to include a regulation-size basketball half-court. Smits used two barns on the property to house his motorcycles and cars, and built a dedicated motorcycle track in the rear of the property. He and his girlfriend put the property up for sale in the summer of 2017, shortly after they moved to Arizona.

<text>Jason Rullo (born July 17, 1972) is an American drummer, who is one of the founding members of progressive metal band Symphony X.

In 2003, he was featured in a readers&#x27; poll for &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; magazine, where he achieved two awards: second place in the up-and-coming drummer poll, and third place for best recorded performance on Symphony X&#x27;s &quot;The Odyssey&quot; (2002). In the same year, he performed on the self-titled debut album by Redemption. He currently teaches drum lessons at Big Beat Studios in New Jersey.

On February 27, 2013, it was announced by Symphony X&#x27;s management that, during the previous week, Jason was admitted to hospital for heart failure. He spent a week in hospital, and was released after some days. Jason then started a rehab program, and has been told that his recovery will take a minimum of 3–6 months under doctors&#x27; care. On March 26, 2013, the band announced that John Macaluso would join them on tour for their South American and European dates, until Jason recovers from such health problems.

In 2019, Jason Rullo formed a new band by the name of &quot;3 Rules&quot; along with guitar player Ron Sanborn and bassist Artha Meadors. They released their debut album &quot;Rule of 3&quot; through a GoFundMe campaign in 2020. In an interview with Sonic Perspectives, Jason Rullo said &quot;This is a real band, not just a project&quot;.

<doc id="1310170" wikidata="Q3381142" url="?curid=1310170" title="Battle of Flers–Courcelette">
<text>The Battle of Flers–Courcelette (, 15 to 22 September 1916) was fought during the Battle of the Somme in France, by the French Sixth Army and the British Fourth Army and Reserve Army, against the German 1st Army, during the First World War. The Anglo-French attack of 15 September began the third period of the Battle of the Somme but by its conclusion on 22 September, the strategic objective of a decisive victory had not been achieved. The infliction of many casualties on the German front divisions and the capture of the villages of Courcelette, Martinpuich and Flers had been a considerable tactical victory.

The German defensive success on the British right flank made exploitation and the use of cavalry impossible. Tanks were used in battle for the first time; the Canadian Corps and the New Zealand Division fought their first engagements on the Somme. On 16 September, , a specialist fighter squadron, began operations with five new Albatros D.I fighters, which had a performance capable of challenging British and French air supremacy for the first time in the battle.

The British attempt to advance deeply on the right and pivot on the left failed but the British gained about in general and captured High Wood, moving forward about in the centre, beyond Flers and Courcelette. The Fourth Army crossed Bazentin Ridge, which exposed the German rear-slope defences beyond to ground observation. On 18 September, the Quadrilateral, where the British advance had been frustrated on the right flank, was captured.

Arrangements were begun immediately to follow up the success which, after supply and weather delays, began on 25 September at the Battle of Morval, continued by the Reserve Army next day at the Battle of Thiepval Ridge. September was the most costly month of the battle for the German armies on the Somme, which suffered about Combined with the losses at Verdun and on the Eastern Front, the German Empire was brought closer to military collapse than at any time before the autumn of 1918.
==Background==

===Strategic developments===

====Franco-British====
At the beginning of August, optimistic that the Brusilov Offensive (4 June to 20 September) on the Eastern Front in Russia, would continue to absorb German and Austro-Hungarian reserves and that the Germans had abandoned the Battle of Verdun, General Sir Douglas Haig, commander of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France, advocated to the War Committee in London, that pressure be kept on the German armies in France for as long as possible. Haig had hoped that the delay in producing tanks had been overcome and that enough would be ready in September. Despite the small numbers of tanks available and the limited time for the training of their crews, Haig planned to use them in the mid-September battle being planned with the French, in view of the importance of the general Allied offensive being conducted on the Western Front in France, on the Italian front by Italy against the Austro-Hungarians and by General Aleksei Brusilov in Russia, which could not continue indefinitely. Haig believed that the German defence of the Somme front was weakening and that by mid-September might collapse altogether.

By September, Ferdinand Foch the commander of (GAN) and co-ordinator of the Somme offensive, had stopped trying to get the armies on the Somme (Tenth, Sixth, Fourth and Reserve) to attack simultaneously, which had proved impossible and instead make separate sequenced attacks, successively to envelop the German defences. Foch wanted to increase the size and tempo of attacks, to weaken the German defence and achieve &quot;rupture&quot;, a general German collapse. Haig had been reluctant to participate in August, when the Fourth Army was not close enough to the German third position to make a general attack practicable. The main effort was being made north of the Somme by the British and Foch had to acquiesce, while the Fourth Army closed up to the third position. To help the Fourth Army, the Reserve Army was to resume attacks against Thiepval and begin attacks into the Ancre river valley; the Fourth Army was to capture the German intermediate and second positions from Guillemont to Martinpuich and then the third position from Morval to le Sars, as the Sixth Army attacked the intermediate line from Le Fôret to Cléry, then the third position from the Somme to Rancourt. On the south side of the river, the Tenth Army would commence its postponed attack from Barleux to Chilly.

====German====
On 28 August, General Erich von Falkenhayn, the Chief of the General Staff of (OHL, supreme army command), simplified the German command structure on the Western Front by establishing two army groups. controlled the 6th Army, 1st Army, 2nd Army and 7th Army, from Lille to the boundary of , from south of the Somme battlefield to beyond Verdun. was dissolved and General Max von Gallwitz reverted to the command of the 2nd Army. The emergency in Russia caused by the Brusilov Offensive, the entry of Romania into the war and French counter-attacks at Verdun, put further strain on the German army. Falkenhayn was sacked from the OHL on 28 August and replaced by Hindenburg and Ludendorff. The &quot;Third OHL&quot; ordered an end to attacks at Verdun and the despatch of troops to Romania and the Somme front.

===Tactical developments===
Flers is a village north-east of Albert, south of Bapaume, to the east of Martinpuich, west of Lesbœufs and to the north-east of Delville Wood. The village is on the D 197 from Longueval to Ligny Thilloy. In 1916, the village was defended by the Switch Line, Flers Trench on the western outskirts, Flea Trench and Box and Cox were behind the village in front of Gird Trench and Gueudecourt. Courcelette is near the D 929 Albert–Bapaume road, north-east of Albert, to the north-east of Pozières and south-west of Le Sars.

Since 1 July, the BEF GHQ tactical instructions issued on 8 May had been added to but without a general tactical revision. Attention had been drawn to matters which had been neglected in the heat of battle, such as the importance of infantry skirmish lines being followed by small columns, captured ground being mopped up, avoiding the tendency to rely on hand-grenades (&quot;bombs&quot;) at the expense of the rifle, consolidation of captured ground, the benefit of machine-gun fire from the rear, the use of Lewis guns on the flanks and in outposts and the value of Stokes mortars for close-support. The &quot;wearing-out&quot; battles since late July and events elsewhere, led to a belief that the big Allied attack planned for mid-September would have more than local effect.

A general relief of the German divisions on the Somme was completed in late August; the British assessment of the number of German divisions available as reinforcements was increased to eight. GHQ Intelligence considered a German division on the British front was worn-out after days and that German divisions had to spend an average of twenty days in the line before relief. Of six more German divisions moved to the Somme by 28 August, only two had been known to be in reserve, the other four having been moved from quiet sectors without warning.

Hindenburg issued new tactical instructions in (&quot;Principles of Command for Defensive Battles in Positional Warfare&quot;) which ended the emphasis on holding ground at all costs and counter-attacking every penetration. The purpose of the defensive battle was defined as allowing the attacker to wear out their infantry, using methods that conserved German infantry. Manpower was to be replaced by machine-generated firepower, using equipment built in a competitive mobilisation of domestic industry under the Hindenburg Programme, the policy rejected by Falkenhayn as futile, given the superior resources of the coalition fighting the Central Powers. Defensive practice on the Somme had already been changing towards defence in depth, to nullify Anglo-French firepower and the official adoption of the practice marked the beginning of modern defensive tactics. Ludendorff also ordered the building of the , a new defensive system behind the Noyon Salient (which became known as the Hindenburg Line) to make possible a withdrawal while denying the Franco-British the chance to fight a mobile battle.

Since July German infantry had been under constant observation from aircraft and balloons, which directed huge amounts of artillery-fire accurately onto their positions and made many machine-gun attacks on German infantry. One regiment ordered men in shell-holes to dig fox-holes or cover themselves with earth for camouflage and sentries were told to keep still to avoid being seen. The German air effort in July and August had mostly been defensive, which led to much criticism from the infantry and ineffectual attempts to counter Anglo-French aerial dominance, dissipating German air strength to no effect. Anglo-French artillery observation aircraft were considered &quot;brilliant&quot;, annihilating German artillery and attacking infantry from very low altitude, causing severe anxiety among German troops, who treated all aircraft as Allied and came to believe that British and French aircraft were armoured.

Redeployment of German aircraft backfired, many losses being suffered for no result, which further undermined relations between the infantry and (Imperial German Flying Corps). German artillery units preferred direct protection of their batteries to artillery observation flights, which led to more losses as the German aircraft were inferior to their opponents as well as outnumbered. Slow production of German aircraft exacerbated equipment problems and German air squadrons were equipped with a motley of designs until the arrival in August of &quot;Jagdstaffel&quot; 2 ( [Captain] Oswald Boelcke), equipped with the Halberstadt D.II, which began to restore a measure of air superiority in September and the first Albatros D.Is, which went into action on 17 September.

===The tank===

Before 1914, inventors had designed armoured fighting vehicles and one design had been rejected by the Austro-Hungarian army in 1911. In 1912, Lancelot de Mole, submitted plans to the War Office for a machine which foreshadowed the tank of 1916, that was also rejected and in Berlin an inventor demonstrated a &quot;land cruiser&quot; in 1913. By 1908, the British army had adopted vehicles with caterpillar tracks to move heavy artillery and in France, Major Ernest Swinton, (Royal Engineers) heard of the cross-country, caterpillar-tracked Holt tractor in June 1914. In October, Swinton thought of a &quot;machine-gun destroyer&quot; that could cross barbed wire and trenches and discussed it at GHQ with Major-General George Fowke, the army chief engineer, who passed this on to Lieutenant-Colonel Maurice Hankey, the Secretary of the War Council. Little interest had been shown by January 1915. Swinton persuaded the War Office to set up an informal committee which in February 1915 watched a demonstration of a Holt tractor pulling a weight of over trenches and barbed wire, the performance of which was judged unsatisfactory.

Independent of Swinton, Winston Churchill, the First Lord of the Admiralty, had in October 1914, asked for an adaptation of a 15-inch howitzer tractor for trench crossing. In January 1915, Churchill had written to the Prime Minister on the subject of an armoured caterpillar tractor to crush barbed wire and cross trenches. On 9 June, a vehicle with eight driving wheels and bridging gear was demonstrated to the War Office committee. The equipment failed to cross a double line of trenches wide and the experiment was abandoned. In parallel to these explorations, on 19 January 1915, Churchill ordered Commodore Murray Sueter, Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) to conduct experiments with steamrollers and in February, Major Thomas Hetherington RNAS, showed Churchill designs for a &quot;land battleship&quot;. Churchill set up a Landships Committee, chaired by Eustace Tennyson d&#x27;Eyncourt, the Director of Naval Construction, to oversee the creation of an armoured vehicle to crush wire and cross trenches.
In June 1915, Sir John French, commander of the BEF found out about the ideas put forward by Swinton for &quot;caterpillar machine-gun destroyers&quot;. French sent the memoranda to the War Office, which in late June began to liaise with the Landships Committee at the Admiralty and specified the characteristics of a vehicle. Churchill had relinquished his post in the War Committee but lent his influence to the experiments and building of the &quot;tanks&quot;. By August, Swinton was able to co-ordinate the War Office specifications for the tanks, Admiralty design efforts and manufacture by the Ministry of Munitions. An experimental vehicle built by Fosters of Lincoln was tested in secret at Hatfield on 2 February 1916 and the results were considered so good that vehicles of the &quot;mother&quot; design and a prototype of the Mark I tank were ordered.

In March 1916, Swinton was given command of the new Heavy Section, Machine-Gun Corps, raised with manpower from the Motor Machine Gun Training Centre at Bisley, with an establishment of six companies with each, crewed by and Training began in great secrecy in June at Elveden in Suffolk, as soon as the first Mark I tank arrived. Two types of Mark I tank had been designed, &quot;male&quot; tanks, with a crew of eight, two 6-pounder guns and three Hotchkiss 8 mm machine-guns, a maximum speed of and a tail (two wheels at the rear to help with steering and to reduce the shock of crossing broken ground). &quot;Female&quot; tanks were similar in size, weight, speed and crew and were intended to defend the &quot;males&quot; against an infantry rush, with their armament of four Vickers machine guns, a Hotchkiss machine-gun and a much larger allotment of ammunition.

==Prelude==

===Early-September attacks===

====Tenth Army====

The French Tenth Army attacked south of the Somme on 4 September, adding to the pressure on the German defence, which had been depleted by the attritional fighting north of the Somme since July. (Military units in this section are French unless specified.) The original German front position ran from Chilly, north to Soyécourt then along the new German first line north to Barleux, which had been established after the Sixth Army advances in July. Five German divisions held the front line which ran northwards through the fortified villages of Chilly, Vermandovillers, Soyécourt, Deniécourt, Berny-en-Santerre and Barleux. A second line of defence ran from Chaulnes (behind woods to the west and north and the château park, from which the Germans had observation over the ground south of the Flaucourt plateau), Pressoir, Ablaincourt, Mazancourt and Villers-Carbonnel.

The Tenth Army had fourteen infantry and three cavalry divisions in the II, X and XXXV corps but many of their divisions had been transferred from Verdun and were understrength. The attack took place from Chilly north to Barleux, intended to gain ground on the Santerre plateau, ready to exploit a possible German collapse and then to capture crossings over the Somme south of Péronne. A four-stage advance behind a creeping barrage was planned, although reinforcements of artillery and ammunition were not available, due to the demand for resources at Verdun and north of the Somme.
Much of the destructive and counter-battery bombardment in the X and XXXV corps sectors was ineffective, against defences which the Germans had improved and reinforced with more infantry. After six days of bombardment, the attack by ten divisions began on a front. The five German divisions opposite were alert and well dug-in but X Corps captured Chilly and part of the woods in the centre of the corps front. The corps was checked on the left at Bois Blockhaus Copse, behind the German front line. In XXXV Corps in the centre, the 132nd Division briefly held Vermandovillers and the 43rd Division advanced from Bois Étoile and took Soyécourt.

The II Corps attack failed on the right flank, where German troops managed to hold the front line, the II Corps advanced in the north; at Barleux, the 77th Division was obstructed by uncut wire and the advanced troops were cut off and destroyed. German troops in front line dugouts that had not been mopped-up, had emerged and stopped the supporting waves in no man&#x27;s land. More ground was taken, preparatory to an attack on the second objective but the offensive was suspended on 7 September after large German counter-attacks. The French took and Foch doubled the daily allotment of ammunition to capture the German second position. From the Tenth Army attacked again and captured Berny, Vermandovillers, Déniecourt and several thousand prisoners.

====Sixth Army====

The Sixth Army was reinforced near the river on 3 September, by XXXIII Corps with the 70th and 77th divisions astride the river and VII Corps with the 45th, 46th, 47th and 66th divisions on the left. XX Corps on the left flank of the Sixth Army was relieved by I Corps, with the 1st and 2nd divisions and several fresh or rested brigades were distributed to each corps. Control of the creeping barrage was delegated to commanders closer to the battle and a communications system using flares, Roman candles, flags and panels, telephones, optical signals, pigeons and message runners was set up to maintain contact with the front line. Four French divisions attacked north of the Somme at noon on 3 September. Cléry was subjected to a machine-gun barrage from the south bank and VII Corps captured most of the village, much of the German position along the Cléry–Le Forêt road and Le Forêt village. On the left, I Corps advanced , quickly occupied high ground south of Combles and entered Bois Douage.

On 4 September, German counter-attacks at the Combles ravine stopped the French advance towards Rancourt but the French consolidated Cléry and forwarded to the German third position. The British took Falfemont Farm on 5 September and linked with the French at Combles ravine. French patrols captured Ferme de l&#x27;Hôpital east of Le Forêt and reached a ridge behind the track from Cléry to Ferme de l&#x27;Hôpital, which forced the Germans to retire to the third position in some confusion, XX Corps taking VII Corps took all of Cléry and met XXXIII Corps on the right, which had captured Ommiécourt in the marshes south of the village, taking as French parties reached the German gun-line. An attack by I Corps failed on 6 September and attacks were delayed for six days, as the difficulty in supplying such a large force on the north bank was made worse by rain.
Attempts by Foch and Fayolle to exploit the success before the Germans recovered failed because of the days lost to rain, the exhaustion of the I and VII corps, the lengthening of the Sixth Army front and its divergence from the line of the Fourth Army advance. A defensive flank was made on the left along Combles ravine by I Corps. V Corps was moved out of reserve and for the first time, Foch issued warning orders for the Cavalry Corps to prepare to exploit a German collapse. Transport difficulties became so bad that General Adolphe Guillaumat, the I Corps commander, ordered all stranded vehicles to be thrown off the roads and supply to continue in daylight, despite German artillery-fire, ready for the resumption of the attack on 12 September.

On 12 September, XXXIII Corps attacked towards Mont St Quentin and VII Corps attacked Bouchavesnes, taking the village and digging in facing Cléry and Feuillaucourt. I Corps took Bois d&#x27;Anderlu and broke through the German defences near Marrières Wood, before attacking northwards towards Rancourt and Sailly-Saillisel. On 13 September, I Corps closed on Le Priez Farm and VII Corps defeated several big German counter-attacks. Next day, the attacks of VII and XXXIII corps were stopped by mud and German defensive fire but I Corps managed to take Le Priez Farm. Attacks were suspended again to bring up supplies and relieve tired troops, despite the big British attack due on 15 September. Frégicourt, which overlooked part of the area to be attacked by the British, was still held by the Germans. Although Foch wanted to keep pressure on the Germans south of the river, supply priority was given to the Sixth Army; the Tenth Army met frequent German counter-attacks near Berny, which took some ground and was not able to resume its attacks.

===German preparations===

Falkenhayn had been superseded on 29 August and the cessation of German attacks at Verdun was ordered by the new comprising the Chief of the General Staff, Field Marshal () Paul von Hindenburg and General Erich Ludendorff. Reinforcements ordered to the Somme front by the new commanders reduced the German inferiority in guns and aircraft during September. The field artillery was able to reduce its barrage frontages from per battery and increased the accuracy of its bombardments by using one air artillery flight per division. Colonel () Fritz von Loßberg, Chief of Staff of the 2nd Army, was also able to establish (relief divisions) behind the battlefield, ready to replace the front divisions. The 2nd Army was able to mount bigger and more frequent counter-attacks, making the Anglo-French advance slower and more costly.

About five German divisions were opposite the Fourth Army, with the II Bavarian Corps ( Otto von Stetten), which had arrived on the Somme front from Lille in the 6th Army area, at the end of August. The 3rd Bavarian Division held the line from Martinpuich to High Wood and the 4th Bavarian Division the ground from High Wood to Delville Wood. The line eastwards was held by the 5th Bavarian Division of the III Bavarian Corps ( ), which had arrived from Lens, also in the 6th Army area, ten days previous. The 50th Reserve Division was in reserve behind the 3rd Bavarian Division, having been transferred from Armentières and the 6th Bavarian Division en route from the Argonne, was assembling behind the 4th and 5th Bavarian divisions. There were three trench systems, the front line being in (Switch Trench) about across no man&#x27;s land, along the south face of Bazentin ridge. About back on the far side of the ridge lay (Flers Trench to the British) in front of the village of Flers and another back lay (Gird Trench) in front of Gueudecourt, Lesbœufs and Morval.

The Entente tactic of attacking strictly limited objectives had made the German defence more difficult and the constant Anglo-French artillery bombardments turned the German defences into crater-fields. Dugouts were caved in, barbed-wire entanglements were vapourised and trenches obliterated. German infantry took to occupying shell-holes in two- and three-man teams, about apart. Supporting and reserve units further back used shell-holes and any cover that could be found for shelter. Attempts to link shell-hole positions with trenches were abandoned because they were easily visible from the air and Entente artillery-observation crews directed bombardments on them. When attacks commenced, German infantry usually moved forward from such visible positions and created an advanced line of occupied shell-holes but this was often overrun during an attack. British and French infantry then set up a similar defence in shell-holes about beyond, before the German infantry in reserve could begin a hasty counter-attack (). The Germans tried to resort to occasional methodical counter-attacks () on a broad front, to recapture tactically valuable areas but most of these failed too, because of insufficient men, artillery and ammunition.

The German commanders expected that the British and French would continue the Somme offensive, given their superiority in numbers and equipment. In early September, (General ) the headquarters of the Guard Reserve Corps, reported an increase in British activity and much artillery-fire on the front from Thiepval to Leuze Wood. The timing of the new attack was unknown and the relief of exhausted divisions continued. (Some German prisoners taken on the III Corps front on 15 September claimed that they had been warned of &quot;land cruisers&quot; with thick armour the day before. Prisoners taken near Bouleaux Wood said that (S.m.K., bullet with core) ammunition had been issued and that grinding noises had been heard from behind the British lines, which was taken to be mining but the &quot;sinister, noisy sounds&quot; had stopped during the night of 

===British preparations===
Planning for the offensive began in August and continued into September, while XIV Corps (Lieutenant-General the Earl of Cavan) was engaged on the right flank and XV Corps (Lieutenant-General John Du Cane) and III Corps (Lieutenant-General William Pulteney) were fighting for Delville and High woods. The attacks on the woods added to the burden on transport, engineer, pioneer and labour units. Repairs to damage caused by German artillery-fire diverted effort from shelter being built for fresh divisions assembling behind the front; communications were improved and new battery positions and headquarters erected, new supply dumps created, water supplies increased and carrying services organised into the ground due to be captured. The Fourth Army chief engineer, Major-General Reginald Buckland, had labour and engineer stores for road and track building and repair brought forward in preference to work on the Fourth Army (General Sir Henry Rawlinson) rear area, which was helped by new railheads at Albert and Fricourt. A broad-gauge line had been pushed up to Maricourt by 10 September and a metre-gauge track was almost as far forward as Montauban.

The Fourth Army artillery was reinforced by five 60-pounder batteries, a 6-inch howitzer battery, two 9.2-inch howitzer batteries and the field artillery of divisions that had recently arrived in France. Rawlinson wanted as much artillery as possible moved forward before the attack to avoid moves once the attack began and the batteries to move forward first were given portable bridges. XIV Corps had 244 18-pounder guns and 64 4.5-inch howitzers, four heavy siege artillery groups with a 15-inch howitzer, two 12-inch howitzers, twenty 9.2-inch, eight 8-inch and forty 6-inch howitzers, two 9.2-inch guns, twenty-eight 60-pounders and four 4.7-inch guns. XV Corps had 248 18-pounders, seventy-two 4.5-inch howitzers and five heavy and siege groups, III Corps had 228 18-pounders, sixty-four 4,5-inch howitzers and five heavy and siege groups, which amounted to a field gun or howitzer for every of front and a heavy piece every . In the Reserve Army, the Canadian Corps had three heavy groups and the 3rd Canadian Division, forming the defensive flank, was given six field artillery brigades, with two in corps reserve for contingencies.

Experience had shown that it took six hours for orders to pass from corps headquarters to company commanders and it was now considered of great importance to issue warning orders, to give time for reconnaissance and preparation by the artillery and infantry. It had also been found that corps headquarters had become aware of the situation from contact-patrol aircrew reports, while brigade headquarters were ignorant of events and arrangements for the swift transmission of information forwards were made. The signalling system for a larger number of contact-patrol aircraft was established and sites for new signal stations on the ground to be attacked were chosen beforehand. If the German defences collapsed it was considered impossible to lay cables quickly and that only one telegraph from brigade, to division to corps could reasonably be expected. Relays of runners, cyclists, horse riders and motorcyclists were to be used as a supplement, with messenger-pigeons to be used in an emergency. Wireless stations were attached to infantry brigades but transmissions were slow, uncertain, caused interference with other transmitters and were open to German eavesdropping.

===British plan===


The British attack was intended to break through of the main German defences on a front, beginning with timetabled limited objective attacks, generally to the north-east. These were ambitious objectives and Haig required preparations to be made for the exploitation of the infantry attack by an advance of the cavalry, should the German defence collapse. Rawlinson favoured a cautious operation with methodical attacks on the German defensive positions and set the German Switch line and its connecting defences in front of Martinpuich as the first objective (Green Line). The right flank of the XIV Corps was to capture the forward slopes of the high ground to the north-west of Combles, which required an advance of from the Quadrilateral to Delville Wood and a advance on the rest of the front.

A second objective (Brown Line) took in the German third position covering Flers to be taken by the XV Corps and subsidiary defences from Flers to Martinpuich to be attacked by the III Corps, an advance of another . A third objective (Blue Line) was beyond, at the German third position and rear defences covering Morval and Lesbœufs to be taken by the XIV Corps and Flers village (XV Corps), the line extending to the west so that the III Corps advance would be , encircling Martinpuich and closing up to German artillery positions near Le Sars. A fourth objective (Red Line) was set forward of the Blue Line and was beyond Morval and Lesbœufs, to be taken by the XIV Corps and Gueudecourt by the XV Corps, from where the two corps were to form a defensive flank, from Gueudecourt to the third position past Flers, facing north-west.

The defensive flank to the north of Combles was to be extended by the right flank of XIV Corps onto slopes south-east of Morval and the French Sixth Army south of Combles was to advance to Frégicourt and Sailly-Saillisel to surround Combles from the south with a I Corps advance on Rancourt and Frégicourt to form the defensive flank; V Corps was to close up to St Pierre Vaast Wood as VII Corps attacked east of Bouchavesnes and XXXIII Corps attacked at Cléry. The III Corps on left of the Fourth Army was to link with the right flank of the Reserve Army, which at first was to conduct subsidiary operations but if the Fourth Army attack bogged down, the main effort might be transferred to the Reserve Army, to capture Thiepval and take up winter positions.
The plan for the Reserve Army was issued on 12 September for the right flank of the Canadian Corps to attack with the III Corps to capture vantage points over the German defences from Flers to Le Sars and Pys. The 2nd Canadian Division was to attack on a front from its right flank to the Ovillers–Courcelette track, a to the edge of Courcelette and a advance on the left with the 3rd Canadian Division providing a flank guard. The Canadian infantry were to advance after the preliminary bombardment straight on to the objective, a continuation of the Green Line. The II Corps on the left flank was to exploit chances to take ground, especially to the south of Thiepval, where cloud gas was to be released and the 49th Division was to simulate an attack with a smoke screen. North of the Ancre, V Corps was to discharge smoke and raid two places.

Zero hour was set for British Summer Time (BST) 15 September. The Red Line was to be reached before noon, allowing for eight hours of daylight for the exploitation. Two cavalry divisions were swiftly to pass between Morval and Gueudecourt and after an all-arms force had established a defensive flank from Sailly-Saillisel to Bapaume, the rest of the Fourth Army could attack northwards and roll up the German defences. An exploitation force like that of 1 July was not assembled but the Cavalry Corps objective was high ground between Rocquigny and Bapaume and the German artillery areas from Le Sars to Warlencourt and Thilloy. The cavalry was to be supported by XIV and XV corps as quickly as possible. Railway lines that could be used to carry reinforcements, divisional and corps headquarters were to be attacked by cavalry. In an advance by all arms, priority would go to artillery moving forward to support the infantry attacks. When the Red Line was reached, the quick movement forward of the cavalry would take precedence, until the cavalry divisions had passed through, when light wagons carrying food and ammunition for the infantry would take priority. Movement of the cavalry needed strict control, lest a bottleneck develop and the re-building of roads and tracks was to commence as soon as the attack began, each division being given routes to work on.

In the XIV Corps area on the right flank, the 56th (1/1st London) Division (Major-General C. P. A. Hull) was to form a defensive flank on the north-west slope of the Combles Ravine. The 6th Division (Major-General C. Ross) had been held up by the Quadrilateral to the north of Leuze Wood, which lay in front of the first objective. An advance by the 56th (1/1st London) Division past Bouleaux Wood would outflank the south end of the Quadrilateral and ease the advance of the 6th Division and that of the Guards Division (Major-General Geoffrey Feilding) further north across the ridge in front towards Morval and Lesbœufs to the north-east. Three tanks were to attack the Quadrilateral and just before zero hour, three columns of three tanks each, were to attack on the front of the Guards Division.

==Battle==

===Sixth Army===

By 15 September the Sixth Army needed a pause after its attacks on 12 September to relieve worn-out troops and bring forward supplies. The artillery of I Corps supported the British XIV Corps attack at dawn and its infantry attacked at beginning a bombing fight with the Germans at Bois Douage. Ground was gained north of Le Priez Farm but no progress was made at Rancourt. V Corps, to the east, failed to reach the south side of St Pierre Vaast Wood, VII Corps made no progress east of Bouchavesnes and XXXIII Corps straightened its front. On 16 September, the Sixth Army conducted counter-battery fire in support of the British, with the infantry prepared to follow up if the Germans were forced into an extensive withdrawal. (After 16 September, V Corps extended its right flank and VI Corps took over the VII Corps front. Preparations were made for a Franco-British attack on 21 September, which was postponed until 25 September by supply difficulties and the rain. Despite the reorganisation, I Corps made two surprise attacks late on 18 September, near Combles, which gained ground. German artillery-fire in the area was extensive and counter-attacks at Cléry during the night of at Le Priez Farm and Rancourt during the morning and at Bouchavesnes later, were repulsed by the French only after &quot;desperate&quot; fighting. South of Bouchavesnes, a German attack was defeated by VI Corps.)

===Fourth Army===

====15 September====

On the right of XIV Corps, the 56th (1/1st London) Division ordered the 169th Brigade (Brigadier-General Edward Coke) to capture Loop Trench across the Combles ravine, defended by Reserve Infantry Regiment 28 of the 185th Division. The brigade was to keep contact with the French in the valley. During the night, a battalion dug jumping-off trenches parallel to Combles Trench below Leuze Wood and a tank drove up to the corner of the wood by dawn. The tank set off again just before to reach the objective with the infantry and after twenty minutes the creeping barrage began. Infantry advanced with the right wing aiming at the junction of Combles and Loop trenches and escaped a German counter-barrage which was late and easily reached the objective.

The tank was a great shock to the defenders and greatly assisted the attack. The attackers were now to swing right to capture Loop Trench and the Loop but crossfire from German machine-guns prevented this and the British began to bomb up Loop Trench and down Combles Trench, which took all day and was reinforced by another battalion and a party of bombers. The tank was knocked out near the Loop but the crew held off German bombers, inflicting many casualties, until it was set on fire five hours later and abandoned. When night fell, a block was set up in Combles Trench beyond the junction but in the Loop the British were short of the sunken road and an attack at failed.

The 167th Brigade (Brigadier-General George Freeth) was to advance northwards to lengthen the defensive flank through the top end of Bouleaux Wood to overlook Combles from the north-west, clear the rest of the wood and link with the 6th Division on the left in the valley beyond. The 168th Brigade would pass through to guard the right flank as Morval was being captured and rendezvous with the French at a crossroads beyond. A 167th Brigade battalion was to advance to the first objective, capturing the German front line trench in Bouleaux Wood and north to Middle Copse. On the right flank the battalion was to bomb downhill towards Combles and link with the 169th Brigade where the Loop joined the sunken road into the village. Two tanks were allotted but one lost a track on the drive to the assembly point in the west side of Bouleaux Wood. The second tank drove slowly towards Middle Copse at attracting much return fire but the infantry attack was stopped by uncut wire and machine-guns, the barrage being ineffectual. No man&#x27;s land was too narrow to risk a bombardment and the German front line was undamaged and hidden in undergrowth. The bombing attack south-east from the wood could not begin but on the left flank, the Londoners got into the front line and advanced close to Middle Copse; the tank had driven to the end of Bouleaux Wood and then ditched. German bombers attacked the tank and the crew retreated after they had all been wounded.

When the 6th Division attacked on the left, the preliminary bombardments, even controlled by artillery observation aircraft, had left the Quadrilateral undamaged. The position was below the crest of ground beyond Ginchy in a depression, where the wire had been overgrown; the two brigadiers and the divisional commander thought that the preparation had failed. The 16th Brigade on the right was to capture the Quadrilateral with a battalion advancing on open ground from the south-west as a company bombed along the trench to the right. The second battalion in support was then to pass through the troops on the first objective and keep going to the third, where the final two battalions were to take Morval. The 71st Brigade on the left was to attack with two battalions to capture Straight Trench and then advance to the final objective supported by the other two battalions of the brigade. Three tanks with the division were to attack the Quadrilateral but two broke down before reaching the assembly point east of Guillemont. Ross asked for the tank lane in the creeping barrage to be closed and XIV Corps, which had considered this possibility, had the order passed to the XIV Corps Commander, Royal Artillery (CRA), Brigadier-General Alexander Wardrop; by chance, his orders to the 6th Division CRA were not followed.

The surviving tank followed a railway line towards the Quadrilateral, passed through British troops at and fired on them by mistake. An officer ran up to the tank through the gunfire and showed the crew the right direction. The tank turned north, drove parallel to Straight Trench and fired into it. The leading battalion of the 16th Brigade attacked at advancing north-east and was quickly stopped by massed machine-gun fire, as was the second battalion which jumped off at near the Leuze Wood–Ginchy road; bombers being stopped south-east of the Quadrilateral. The first two battalions of the 71st Brigade advanced over the front line, disappeared beyond the crest and overran an outpost but then the battalions were stopped by uncut wire and caught in machine-gun crossfire from the right and centre, which forced the survivors under cover, the tank, having already been riddled with bullets, returned when low on fuel.

The Guards Division brigades had to assemble on devastated ground to avoid Ginchy which was frequently bombarded and on the right the 2nd Guards Brigade (Brigadier-General John Ponsonby) assembled to the south-east of the Ginchy–Lesbœufs road, the nine waves being only apart, with four platoons abreast over per battalion, for lack of room. The four battalions were to advance straight to the final objective. The 1st Guards Brigade (Brigadier-General Cecil Pereira) on the left was equally cramped, with both flanks bent back. One battalion was to reach the third objective and the second was to pass through to the final objective with one battalion guarding the left flank. The right group of three tanks arrived at the Ginchy–Lesbœufs road, to drive to the south end of the Triangle on the right flank as the centre group reached the north-west point but the three centre group tanks broke down en route. The left group of three tanks to advance west of Ginchy and move up Pint Trench and Lager Lane lost a tank on the assembly and the tenth tank to support the XV Corps attacking the pocket east of Delville Wood before zero hour broke down.
The tanks advanced before zero hour but one failed to start, the rest lost direction and went east into the 6th Division area and then returned. Two tanks on the left began late, got lost and veered to the right; one ditched and the other ran short of fuel and returned, being the last tank operation with the Guards. The creeping barrage began prompt at and the Guards followed behind but as the right of the 2nd Guards Brigade went north-east over the crest, massed machine-gun fire began from the Quadrilateral and Straight Trench. The Guards kept going but to the left of the intended direction, the two supporting battalions keeping close. A German party in a shell-hole position were rushed and bayoneted and the four battalions, mingled together, pressed on into the north end of the Triangle and Serpentine Trench to the left, where the wire had been well cut and the trenches devastated. I Battalion and II Battalion Bavarian Infantry Regiment 7 (BIR 7) had little artillery support and reported later that aircraft strafed them as the British advanced. Despite many casualties, the brigade overpowered the defenders and occupied part of the first objective by the survivors of BIR 7 retiring on the III Battalion in .

The 1st Guards Brigade was also met with machine-gun fire from Pint Trench and Flers Road; the two leading battalions hesitated momentarily before rushing the Germans and capturing several prisoners, four machine-guns and a trench mortar. The supporting battalion had advanced, veered north and overrun a shell-hole position, then arrived on the first objective simultaneously with the 2nd Brigade. The supporting battalion had strayed over the corps boundary, leaving the Germans in possession of Serpentine Trench on either side of Calf Alley. Attempts to sort out the units were made and it was thought that the third objective, on had been reached; a messenger pigeon was sent back, despite a Forward Artillery Observer (FOO) realising the mistake. XIV Corps HQ found that the mist and smoke had stopped contact patrol aircraft from watching the attack; the German artillery reply cut telephone lines and caused long delays in the arrival of runners. It was thought that the Guards had moved on the third objective on time at the 6th Division was known to have been stopped and the 56th (1/1st London) Division was on the first objective; nothing was known of the tanks.

In the 56th (1/1st London) Division area, the 167th Brigade sent two companies to leapfrog through the leading battalion and take the third objective at but it could not advance with the Germans still in Bouleaux Wood and even with the rest of the battalion, could only join the leading battalion in the trenches to the left of the wood. Two battalions of the 71st Brigade, 6th Division, attacked but were cut down by machine-gun fire, despite a re-bombardment of Quadrilateral Trench and Straight Trench. Parties from the 56th (1/1st London) Division got into a trench running south-east from the Quadrilateral, along with men from the 6th Division. At Ross and Hull arranged for the 6th Division brigades to attack the Quadrilateral from the north, west and south at as the 18th Brigade from reserve moved through the Guards Division and attacked Morval, based on the erroneous reports of the Guards&#x27; success. The 56th (1/1st London) Division was to capture Bouleaux Wood after another bombardment. Soon after the plans were laid, air reconnaissance reports reached Cavan with accurate information and the attack was cancelled. The 6th Division was ordered instead to take Straight Trench from the north at after a bombardment by heavy artillery. The cancellation failed to reach the 1/8th Battalion Middlesex Regiment, which attacked on time and was shot down by machine-gunners of BIR 21 but by evening Middle Copse had been captured.

The 2nd Guards Brigade collected bombers and captured the triangle by noon but a further advance, unsupported by the 6th Division, seemed impossible; a party of about advanced close to the third objective just below the Ginchy–Lesbœufs road. A battalion of the 1st Guards Brigade had advanced from Ginchy at to support the advance to the third objective and kept direction to the north-east, advancing in artillery formation (a lozenge shape) and was fired on from part of Serpentine Trench. The battalion moved into line and charged, got a foothold in the trench, bombed outwards and gained touch with the battalions on the flanks, capturing the rest of the first objective. The 1st Guards Brigade battalions had reorganised, realised that they were short of the third objective, attacked again into a German bombardment and reached part of the second objective north of the corps boundary by taking prisoner two battalion headquarters of BIR 14. Some troops joined with men from the 14th (Light) Division (Major-General Victor Couper); the attackers reported that they were on the third objective and sent back messages but contact patrol crews reported that the XIV Corps divisions were nowhere near the third objective. Late on the afternoon, BIR 7 counter-attacked and pushed a Guards party back from the Triangle but a second attack was repulsed with small-arms fire. All attacks except that of the 6th Division were cancelled until 16 September but the heavy artillery bombardment went over the crest and fell beyond the Quadrilateral. Two companies were to attack from near Leuze Wood and two down Straight Trench from the Triangle at but only a -length of Straight Trench was captured.

In the XV Corps area, on the left of the main attack, tanks in the area reached their jumping-off points, ready to attack Flers. The 14th (Light) Division attacked the small German salient east of Delville Wood with three tanks and two infantry companies; two of the tanks broke down and tank D1 advanced at from Pilsen Lane, the bombers following a few minutes later. The Germans had been withdrawing and the tank gunners killed a few more men before it was knocked out by a shell as the infantry overran machine-gun posts and got ready for the main advance. The first two objectives were on the rise south-east of Flers and the third was on the Flers–Lesbœufs road beyond. The 41st Brigade was to take the first two and the 42nd Brigade the last. At tank D3 drove towards Cocoa Lane, one having ditched and D5 lagged behind. Two battalions overran shell-hole positions of BIR 14, whose telephones had been cut and SOS rockets obscured; Tea Support Trench and Pint Trench were taken with many prisoners and then the Switch Line (first objective) by 

Troops linked with the Guards Division on the right and formed a defensive flank on the left facing the 41st Division (Major-General Sydney Lawford) area. The two supporting battalions came up through a bombardment and suffered many casualties to shell-fire and isolated Bavarian parties. The attack on Gap Trench was forty minutes late, then troops dribbled forward and the garrison surrendered but the 41st Division was still late. The 42nd Brigade moved forward by compass past Delville Wood, deployed short of the Switch Line and attacked the third objective thirty minutes late; the right hand battalion was stopped just short and the left hand battalion was also caught by machine-gun fire and forced under cover. The two supporting battalions got further forward and found that the neighbouring divisions had not, enfilade fire meeting every movement.

The 41st Division was to attack Flers and had most tanks, four for the Longueval–Flers road and six to attack the middle and west side of the village. On the right flank the 124th Brigade attacked with two battalions forward and two in support, having assembled in no man&#x27;s land. The advance began at zero hour and Tea Support Trench and the Switch Line fell relatively easily by and Flers Trench at At a large party of infantry reached Bulls Road and linked with the 122nd Brigade on the left but attacks on Gird Trench failed. The 122nd Brigade had attacked with two battalions and two in support, reaching the Switch Line by and the on to Flers Trench. Tank D15 was knocked out near the Switch Line, D14 ditched near Flers and D18 was damaged by a shell at Flers Trench but managed to withdraw. D16 entered Flers at followed by troops of the 122nd Brigade, D6, D9 and D17 driving along the eastern fringe of the village, destroying strong points and machine-gun nests. By the surviving Bavarians made a run for Gueudecourt and small parties of the 41st Division reached the third objective. A lull occurred from then the third objective was consolidated along with Box &amp; Cox Trench and Hogs Head. D16 was undamaged but D6 was set on fire close to Gueudecourt; D9 got to Box &amp; Cox, along Glebe Street where it was knocked out. D17 was hit twice by artillery-fire and abandoned on the east side of Flers and recovered later.

The 2nd New Zealand Brigade (2nd NZ) of the New Zealand Division (Major-General Andrew Russell) advanced with two battalions thirty seconds early and ran into the creeping barrage. German machine-gunners in High Wood caught the troops but they were able to capture the Switch Line and Coffee Lane and dug in beyond the Switch Line by A third battalion leapfrogged through the new line and then advanced with the creeping barrage at and took the second objective at Flag Lane at Two more battalions took over and captured Flers Trench and Flers Support Trench at on the right, against small-arms fire from Flers, Abbey Road and a sunken lane. The New Zealanders had begun to dig in by The battalion on the left was stopped by uncut wire and waited for the tanks to arrive but D10 was knocked out at Flat Trench. D11 and D12 arrived at rolled over the wire and the infantry passed through to the last objective. Grove Alley was captured by the party withdrew at D12 ditched west of Flers, D8 got to Abbey Road but its vision prisms were hit and D11 took guard at the Ligny road for the rest of the night.
In the III Corps area, the 47th Division (Major-General Sir Charles Barter) attacked on the right with the 140th Brigade whose troops reached the Switch Line and dug in on the far slope with the New Zealanders. Four tanks had also driven forward at zero hour and two reached the south end of High Wood and then turned east onto easier ground. One tank got lost and ditched in the British front line after mistakenly firing on the troops there and the second tank got stuck in a shell crater. The third tank crossed the German line in High Wood and fired into the support line until knocked out and the fourth bogged in no man&#x27;s land. The Germans in High Wood defeated the attack with machine-gun fire and a mêlée began. The two battalions of the 141st Brigade advancing on the second objective at was drawn in and on the far right flank Flag lane was captured.

At the 1/6th London moved through towards Cough Drop and a few men made it to Flers Trench but were repulsed. Cough Drop was held and attempts were made to dig eastwards to the New Zealanders. At after a hurricane bombardment of 750 Stokes mortar bombs in 15 minutes, several hundred Germans in High Wood began to surrender as Londoners worked round the flanks and the wood was captured by At two battalions of the 142nd Brigade in reserve went forward to take the Starfish Line, one battalion moving to the east of High Wood and being stopped short of Starfish. As night fell, three companies advancing along the left side of the wood were also stopped and there was no consolidated front line except on the right at Cough Drop, where the 1/6th London were in contact with the New Zealand Division.

In the 50th Division (Major-General Percival Wilkinson) area, the 149th Brigade attacked with two battalions, one in support and one in reserve at zero hour and by had captured Hook Trench and gained touch with the 150th Brigade on the left. After receiving machine-gun fire from High Wood on the right at a battalion began to bomb down trenches towards the wood and the support and reserve battalions were sent to reinforce. Just after a battalion reached a sunken road near The Bow and another battalion set up a defensive flank north-west of High Wood and later on portions of the Starfish Line were captured. The 150th Brigade attack had two tanks advancing ahead of the infantry and one reached Hook Trench and fired into it until hit by two shells and blown up as the other tank crossed the trench drove on to the third objective and knocked out three machine-guns on the edge of Martinpuich before returning to refuel.

The infantry attack took the first objective by and reached parts of the third objective by but one battalion retired to Martin Trench as its flank was exposed. Two reserve battalions were sent forward at and around German shelling forced one battalion to retreat to Hook Trench. About held a sunken road south of The Bow and the 150th Brigade was forced to abandon the Starfish Line and moved back to Martin Trench and Martin Alley by German bombardments. At the 150th Brigade was ordered to attack Prue Trench and join with the 15th (Scottish) Division in Martinpuich. At two battalions of the 151st Brigade attacked but were forced back by machine-gun fire and dug in, as did the third battalion, which attacked late at and dug in after a short advance.

The 15th Division (Major-General Frederick McCracken) attacked with two battalions attached from the 23rd Division and the 45th Brigade on the right flank attacked with two battalions, one in support and three in reserve. The barrage was found to be very good and little resistance was met except at Tangle South and the Longueval–Martinpuich road. The 46th Brigade on the left attacked with all four battalions and three in support and captured Factory Lane at touch being gained with the Canadians on the left as patrols went along the western fringe of the village. A tank moved very slowly but attacked the Germans in Bottom Trench and Tangle Trench, silenced several machine-guns in Martinpuich and then returned to refuel, returning later carrying ammunition. The second tank was knocked out before reaching its jumping-off point. When the artillery lifted off the village at both brigades sent patrols in and around a 46th Brigade battalion dug in on the objective and at a 45th Brigade battalion captured the north end of the village and the ruins were occupied by the 46th Brigade and outposts were established facing Courcelette. During the night, two fresh battalions relieved the front line and gained touch with the Canadians in Gunpit Trench and on the right flank touch was gained with the 50th Division at the Martin Alley–Starfish Line junction.

====16–17 September====
In the XIV Corps, the 56th (1/1st London) Division made some local attacks and with the 6th Division fired artillery on the right flank of the Guards Division. The 61st Brigade of the 20th (Light) Division (Major-General Richard Davies) as attacked to the Guards and assembled beyond Serpentine Trench before capturing the third objective, part of the Ginchy–Lesbœufs road and two battalions then came up to guard both flanks with Stokes mortars and machine-guns as the Germans counter-attacked on the left flank through the afternoon. It took the 3rd Guards Brigade all morning to reorganise after the attacks the previous day and it did not attack until without artillery support. Two battalions advanced through machine-gun fire until short of the objective and dug in with the left flank on Punch Trench; during the night the 20th Division relieved the Guards in a rainstorm.

All of the XV Corps divisions attacked at and on the 14th (Light) Division front the creeping barrage was poor. The right hand battalion was fired on from Gas Alley and forced under cover; west of the road from Ginchy–Gueudecourt road, the left hand battalion was also fired on from the front and the right and took cover in shell-holes. Two battalions tried to reinforce the attack but were also repulsed as was another attack at The 41st Division attacked with the 64th Brigade attached from the 20th (Light) Division, which struggled up to the front line in a rainstorm during the night, were late and began behind the creeping barrage. There were many casualties from machine-guns and shrapnel shells before crossing the British front line but parties got within of Gird Trench. Tank D14 drove into Gueudecourt and was knocked out; the 64th Brigade reorganised at Bulls Road, where an order for another attack was too late to be followed. The 1st NZ Brigade defeated a German counter-attack along the Ligny road around assisted by tank D11, which had stayed near the road all night. One battalion attacked at zero hour, and captured Grove Alley but the repulse of the 64th Brigade on the right led to more attacks being cancelled. D11 had advanced but a shell explosion underneath stopped the vehicle after only ; the New Zealand right was short of the Ligny road and a trench was dug back to Box &amp; Cox.

In the III Corps, a 47th Division battalion of the 142nd Brigade attacked thirty minutes early from Crest Trench towards Cough Drop beyond to capture Prue Trench but after passing the Switch Line, German machine-gun fire and artillery-fire dispersed the attackers who took cover in the Starfish Line except for one company which got into Cough Drop. The 151st Brigade of the 50th Division also attacked Prue Trench east of Crescent Alley and parties from two battalions briefly occupied the objective. A battalion from the 150th Brigade also attacked but veered to the left and were repulsed and attempts to bomb down Prue Trench from Martin Alley were also abortive. The 15th (Scottish) Division was counter-attacked during the morning and Martinpuich was bombarded all day. Posts were set up nearer to 26th Avenue and the line up to the Albert–Bapaume road was taken over from the Canadians. By 17 September the Guards Division had been relieved by the 20th (Light) Division and on the right, the 60th Brigade was attacked and eventually managed to repulse the Germans. The 59th Brigade attacked at in heavy rain to capture the third objective but machine-gun fire prevented an advance. The 14th (Light) and 41st divisions were replaced by the 21st Division (Major-General David Campbell) and the 55th (West Lancashire) Division (Major-General Hugh Jeudwine).

====18–22 September====
The rain continued and turned the roads into swamps but at in the XIV Corps area, a battalion of the 169th Brigade, 56th (1/1st London) Division attacked up the Combles road but made little progress as a battalion on the right flank managed to bomb forward slightly. The 167th Brigade was to attack the south-east face of Bouleaux Wood but was so impeded by mud and flooded shell-holes that it could not even reach the jumping-off point. A battalion each of the 16th and 18th brigades of the 6th Division attacked the Quadrilateral and Straight Trench, also at and captured the position and a sunken road beyond. A third battalion bombed forwards from the south-east and reached the 56th (1/1st London) Division at Middle Copse. The first attack on Straight Trench failed but bombers eventually got in while a party swung left and got behind the Germans and took 140 prisoners and seven machine-guns. Signs of a counter-attack forming near Morval were seen and bombarded; the 5th Division (Major-General Reginald Stephens) began to relieve the 6th Division.

The 55th Division completed the relief of the 41st Division in the XV Corps area by and bombers of the 1st NZ Brigade bombed up Flers Support Trench close to the Goose Alley junction. In III Corps, the 47th Division sent troops of the 140th Brigade to bomb along Flers Trench and Drop Alley to their junction and parts of two 142nd Brigade battalions attacked the Starfish Line but were only able to reinforce the party already there. Later on, German bombers counter-attacked and drove back the British towards the Starfish Line and were then repulsed during the night. At the 50th Division attacked eastwards along the Starfish Line and Prue Alley, with two battalions and bombers of the 150th Brigade and got close to Crescent Alley as a 151st Brigade battalion tried to bomb up Crescent Trench from the south. The 15th (Scottish) Division made minor adjustments to its front line and began its relief by the 23rd Division, which also took over the Starfish Line and Prue Trench west of Crescent Alley from the 50th Division.

On 19 September, a battalion of the 2nd NZ Brigade bombed along Flers Support Trench towards Goose Alley during the evening as a battalion of the 47th Division moved up Drop Alley towards Flers Trench, the Londoners being pushed back to Cough Drop. The III Corps divisions continued to make local attacks and slowly captured the final objectives of 15 September with little opposition. The 56th (1/1st London) Division dug a trench north-east of Middle Copse and south of the copse sapped forward towards Bouleaux Wood. Next day the 47th Division was relieved by the 1st Division and the New Zealanders attacked at with two battalions without a bombardment and captured Goose Alley as troops on the flank attacked up Drop Alley to meet the New Zealanders; a German counter-attack was defeated and Drop Alley was occupied up to Flers Trench. During the night of 20/21 September, patrols on the III Corps front found that the Germans had retired from Starfish and Prue trenches and in XIV Corps the Guards Division took over from the 20th (Light) Division. During 22 September, the III Corps divisions consolidated Starfish and Prue trenches and the 23rd Division found 26th Avenue from Courcelette to Le Sars empty.

===German 1st Army===
The British preparatory bombardment began on 12 September and next day, to limit casualties the number of troops in the front line was reduced to a man for every of front and three machine-gun nests with three guns each per battalion. Each man had three days&#x27; rations and two large water bottles. On the 3rd Bavarian Division front Bavarian Infantry Regiment 17 (BIR 17) was overrun and Martinpuich captured. on the left BIR 23 was able to defeat the attack on at High Wood but was driven from the wood and the trenches from High Wood to Martinpuich later, taking up positions north and east of the village. Battalions of the 50th Reserve Regiment were sent forward and counter-attacked at with the survivors of BIR 23 and were able to reach trenches several hundred yards from the new British front line but Martinpuich was not recaptured. After dark, the defenders improved the defences, reorganised and regained contact with flanking units ready for 16 September. The diarist of BIR 14 recorded that when the prisoners saw the supplies behind the British front, they were astonished at the plenitude, thought that Germany had no chance against such quantity and that had they had such support, they could have surpassed the British effort that day and won the war.

On the 4th Bavarian Division front, Bavarian Infantry (BIR 9, BIR 5) in opposite Delville Wood were quickly overrun and BIR 18 on the right flank up to High Wood was forced back. At the British bombardment on the area back to Flers had increased to drumfire and thirty minutes later, British troops emerged from the smoke and mist. When the creeping barrage passed over, the British rushed and then the following waves took over and advanced towards . The Germans on the rear trench of made a determined defence but were overwhelmed and tanks &quot;had a shattering effect on the men&quot; when they drove along the trench parapet, firing into it as infantry threw grenades at the survivors. Returning wounded alerted BIR 5 in who fired red SOS flares, sent messenger pigeons and runners to call for artillery support but none got through the bombardment being maintained on the Bavarian rear defences. had been mopped up by when the mist began to disperse and BIR 5 could see that the attackers were under cover in shell-holes before . A tank drove along the Longueval–Flers road, unaffected by small-arms fire and stopped astride the trench and raked it with machine-gun fire, drove on and repeated the process, causing many casualties. The tank drove into Flers and emerged from the north end, moving along the Flers–Ligny road until hit by a shell, the shock of the tank led to being captured followed by the village.

On the 5th Bavarian Division front the bombardment increased on 14 September, causing many casualties, cutting most telephone lines and destroying the front trenches until an overnight lull. The bombardment resumed early in the morning including gas shells and before dawn a thick mist rose, which with the gas and smoke, reduced visibility and around troops of Bavarian Infantry Regiment 21 (BIR 21) near Ginchy were surprised to see three vehicles emerge from the mist, manoeuvring round shell-craters. The vehicles, with blue-and-white crosses, were thought to be for transporting wounded. Machine-gun fire was received from them and the Bavarians returned fire but the vehicles drove up to the edge of the trench and fired along it for several minutes. The vehicles drove away, one being hit by a shell and abandoned in no man&#x27;s land. Soon afterwards a creeping barrage began to move towards the German defences and the German artillery reply was considered by survivors to be feeble. A wounded officer returning for treatment found that the batteries around Flers and Gueuedecourt did not know that the British were attacking because the telephone lines had been cut and visual signals had not been seen in the smoke and mist.

 and much of had almost disappeared in the bombardment, most dugout entrances having been blocked and most of was captured, despite isolated pockets of resistance. Troops of BIR 21 had waited in shell-holes for the creeping barrage to pass over and then engaged the British infantry as they advanced in five or six lines. The British troops lay down and tried to advance in small groups, some coming close enough to throw grenades and one party getting into a remnant of trench. The best grenade-thrower in the regiment was nearby and won the exchange, the British being shot down as they ran back across no man&#x27;s land. By the attack had been repulsed and hundreds of British dead and wounded lay in no man&#x27;s land. On the right flank, Bavarian Infantry Regiment 7 (BIR 7) either side of the Ginchy–Lesbœufs road saw skirmish lines with infantry columns behind and circling overhead, strafing the Bavarian infantry. With little artillery support the Bavarians were pushed out of the front line and lost at and II Battalion, with the survivors of the I and III battalions took post in but the British advance stopped short.

Beyond BIR 7, the front was defended by BIR 14, which received no artillery support despite firing SOS flares and was broken through. The battalion headquarters destroyed documents as the British approached and at one headquarters a shell blocked the dug-out and around grenades were thrown down the steps, putting out the lights and filling the air with smoke, dust and the cries of the wounded. Soon afterwards the entrance was widened and the occupants taken prisoner. The diarist of BIR 14 wrote that British aircraft had strafed the trenches and shell-hole positions from , causing many losses. After officers at the regimental HQ in saw British infantry away, moving from Flers either side of the road to Gueudecourt and more troops advancing from Delville Wood to . What was left of the regiment retreated to and engaged the British as they advanced downhill from Flers. Morale revived somewhat and more troops joined in, frustrating the British attacks until the British took cover in shell-holes and communication trenches, ending the attack. At the III Battalion dribbled forward from Le Transloy into and on the right, BIR 5 and BRIR 5 arrived at the Flers–Ligny road, the divisional headquarters ordering that be held at all costs.

The 6th Bavarian Division was sent forward from Le Transloy, Barastre and Caudry, reaching from and at the 4th Bavarian Division and the right flank units of the 5th Bavarian Division were ordered to recapture Flers and . The attack was poorly co-ordinated, with so many units having just arrived but parts of BIR 5 and BRIR 5 advanced west of the Flers–Gueudecourt road. The British were pushed back towards Flers, with many casualties; engineer stores and a battery of field guns were re-captured. At two tanks emerged from the village but were knocked out by artillery. The Bavarians took over (later Grove Alley) north of the village, where machine-gunners of BIR 18 arrived along with two infantry companies. Along the Ligny–Flers road, two battalions of BIR 10 counter-attacked at into massed small arms fire from Flers and were repulsed, a battalion retreating to and the other to . East of Flers the attack was delayed and advanced at by were from and dug in around (later Gas Alley). In the 5th Bavarian Division area, the remnants of BIR 7 attacked near Lesbœufs and pushed back British troops towards but could not re-capture the trench. South of Ginchy, BIR 21 had defeated the attacks all day; from the British resumed the drumfire bombardment until but no attack followed.

===Reserve Army===

====15 September====
The Canadian Corps, on the right flank of the Reserve Army, made its début on the Somme next to the III Corps. The 2nd Canadian Division (Major-General Richard Turner) attacked with the 4th Canadian Brigade on the right of the Albert–Bapaume Road, three battalions to advance to the objective and the 6th Canadian Brigade attacked on the left with two battalions and one following battalion to mop-up. Three tanks were to advance up the Albert–Bapaume road to a sugar factory, which one tank was to attack as the other two turned right down Factory Lane, to the corps boundary with III Corps. On the left of the road in the 6th Canadian Brigade area, three tanks were to advance to Sugar Trench then to attack down it to the sugar factory from the north; the infantry and tanks were to begin together but the infantry were warned not to wait. The sound of the tanks moving up was heard by the Germans, who fired a slow barrage onto the rear areas and communication trenches but this turned out to be a planned raid against the 4th Canadian Brigade. German bombers attacked at and three of the Canadian battalions only just managing to repulse the Germans in time for zero hour at 

The creeping barrage began from the German front line, on the left flank of the 45th Reserve Division in the area of Reserve Infantry Regiment 211 (RIR 211). II Battalion was east of the road and III Battalion was on the west side and received an overhead machine-gun barrage. The Canadians met determined resistance but within fifteen minutes drove the German infantry from the front line, the 4th Canadian Brigade reaching Factory Lane at about and finding many German dead and wounded; about were taken at the sugar factory, including a battalion headquarters and groups of snipers and machine-gunners who refused to surrender were killed. The 6th Canadian Brigade made slower progress against Reserve Infantry Regiment 210 but reached the objective around the left-hand battalion over-running a strong point on the Ovillers–Courcelette track and up McDonnell Trench, from where machine-guns could be fired eastwards along the new front line. The Canadian attack was costly but the remainder began to consolidate and patrols maintained contact with the Germans as they retreated. On the right flank, Lewis guns were set up in the sunken road from Martinpuich to Courcelette and patrols scouted Courcelette before the British bombardment ended at The tanks had been outpaced and one ditched short of the Canadian front line but the two that reached the sugar factory found it already captured and returned, one laying of telephone cable. A tank in the left group broke down but the other two reached the German trenches and killed many infantry before ditching in McDonnell Trench.

On the left, the 3rd Canadian Division attacked early with the 5th Battalion, Canadian Mounted Rifles to secure the left flank, captured the objective and set up a block near , shooting down German troops as they fled. Further left, the 1st Battalion, Canadian Mounted Rifles were prevented from raiding the German lines by a bombardment; on the extreme left, raiders attacked Mouquet Farm in a smokescreen and killed fifty troops of II Battalion, RIR 212. The Canadians set up advanced posts beyond Gunpit Trench and the south fringe of Courcelette as soon as the barrage lifted at and touch was gained with the 15th (Scottish) Division on the right. Reaching Courcelette was obstructed by German counter-attacks from the village by I Battalion, RIR 212 from reserve. At the Canadian Corps HQ ordered the attack on the village to begin with fresh troops at The 22nd Battalion (French Canadian) and the 25th Battalion (Nova Scotia Rifles) arrived on time and attacked into Courcelette when the barrage lifted, occupying a line around the village, cemetery and quarry. The two battalions repulsed German counter-attacks for three days and nights (of the 800 men of the 22nd Battalion, 118 remained after three days of fighting). The 7th Canadian Brigade battalions, attacking from Sugar Trench, lost many casualties to machine-gun fire and found it hard to keep direction in the shattered landscape but captured McDonnell Trench and the east end of . The brigade linked with the 5th Canadian Brigade, except for a gap of at the junction of and .

The left of was captured easily and prisoners were taken from II Battalion, RIR 210. At a battalion of the 8th Canadian Brigade further west, advanced through a barrage and captured more of and formed a trench block. At a battalion advanced from support to pass through the 7th Canadian Brigade to a line close to but was prevented by difficult ground and machine-gun fire. Two companies captured a chalk pit short of the trench; a communication trench was dug forward to it and the rest of the Canadian line was reinforced. I Battalion, RIR 212 in the trenches east of Courcelette cemetery and the quarry to the north made several counter-attacks which were repulsed. Pioneers behind the Canadian lines dug several communication trenches forward despite German shell fire and engineers worked on tracks and strong points, the sugar factory being fortified and provided with water from a repaired well.

===Air operations===

====15–16 September====
The corps squadrons of the Fourth and Reserve armies were busy with artillery-observation and reconnaissance sorties and bombing on the Somme front was conducted by 8, 12 and 13 squadrons of the III Brigade, the RFC squadrons flying in support of the Third Army. Headquarters 9th Wing with 27 and 21 squadrons flew longer-range sorties and bombing sorties south of the Ancre. The RFC made a maximum effort on 15 September, flying more hours and engaging more German aircraft than ever, with an unprecedented emphasis on contact patrols. At zero hour, each corps squadron sent two contact patrol aircraft over the battlefield and sent relays of aircraft to relieve them during the day. The Fourth Army and BEF HQs received information from special patrols, which provided the most accurate information yet. Contact patrol aircraft found that the infantry was much more willing to light flares when called forth by klaxon and observers found that they could identify troops at . In good light they could see which trenches were occupied at 

On the right flank, XIV Corps attacked the Quadrilateral east of Ginchy, where only one tank got into action. At a 9 Squadron observer reported that the 6th Division had been held up but that the Guards Division on the left had advanced quickly towards the Blue Line. The Guards reported the capture of the Blue Line but the observers saw that the advanced troops were in outposts about short. Contact aeroplanes flew all day, many crews flying for eight hours, passing on calls for ammunition and zone calls on fleeting targets. The attack at Flers was watched by 3 Squadron and the first report was dropped at the XV Corps HQ at that the infantry had followed a highly accurate creeping barrage as a stream of emergency rockets were fired from the German trenches. Within ten minutes, British signal flares were lit in the Switch Line and after another fifteen minutes, were alight all the way to Flers Avenue, south of the village. The infantry advance had been so swift that the tanks were left behind but at three tanks closed in on Flers and at one was watched driving down the main road followed by infantry, who dug in on the north and west sides. In the early afternoon, an aircrew watched a tank advance towards Gueudecourt, be hit and catch fire. Reports in the afternoon showed that north of Flers, Box, Cox and The Flame trenches had been occupied, Flea Trench and Hogs Head to the north-east had been manned and XV Corps was on the Blue Line, where at the divisions were ordered to consolidate. Aircrew observed batteries in action, engaged and silenced.
The Canadian attacks were observed by 7 Squadron and observers saw flares in front of Courcelette and across to Martinpuich at The Canadian infantry captured Courcelette at and within the hour, 7 Squadron observers reported flares in a semi-circle round the village. II Corps was watched by 34 Squadron which at reported that the 15th Division had closed up to Martinpuich, the 50th Division had passed the east side of the village and that the advance at High Wood had been held up. A 34 Squadron crew dropped a message at that a tank was ditched in the British front line, one was upended against a tree and one was on fire in the German trenches; infantry were pinned down against uncut wire by machine-gun fire and were trying to dig in. The contact crew flew back to the wood and saw that troops on both flanks had got forward and enveloped the wood. On return, the crew found that a frontal attack was being arranged and was able to get it cancelled. On another sortie, the crew reported at that the troops who had encircled the wood had dug in and thirty minutes later, the Germans in the wood surrendered. Four German parties of infantry on the Reserve Army front were bombarded in response to zone calls.

German observation balloons were attacked by 60 Squadron (Morane Bullets), which shot down two for the loss of one aircraft, having destroyed one balloon the evening before, a disappointing result but balloons were guarded by German aircraft and increasing numbers of anti-aircraft guns. Anti-aircraft lookouts gave warnings and the ground crews winched them down quickly. British balloon observers had good visibility and telephoned reports to guide artillery onto German guns, trenches and strong points; as the infantry advanced, some balloons were moved forward and gained a view over ground previously unseen. Bombers had set out before zero hour, flew back and forth all day and dropped of bombs. 27 Squadron attacked the 2nd Army HQ at Bourlon and 19 Squadron hit the château at Havrincourt, believed to be a corps HQ. Bourlon was bombed again by 27 Squadron at with eight and 16 bombs but were intercepted by German fighters on their bombing run. Four bombs were seen to hit the main building and four of the fighters were driven down, one being seen to crash, for the loss of one aircraft. At five aircraft attacked Achiet-le-Grand and Vélu railway stations.
A morning report from 70 Squadron was received of forty trains on the lines around Cambrai, most trains moving west, that were taken to be an infantry division on the move. At eight Martinsyde Elephants set off to attack the trains and three dive-bombed a train entering Gouzeaucourt station, hit the engine, a carriage at the rear and German troops evacuating the train. One bomb hit an ammunition truck in the middle of the train which exploded and set off several more. The other five aircraft bombed trains at Ribécourt, Épehy and a supply dump at Bantouzelle. During the morning five bombers from 12 Squadron attacked Bapaume at low altitude and hit a train, wagons, rails and station buildings. The bombers and five FE 2 escorts of 11 Squadron, were attacked over the town and the FEs shot down four fighters which crashed and forced two to land, for the loss of two bomber crew wounded, one mortally.

Vélu station was bombed by 13 Squadron, which claimed hits on three trains, derailing coaches, 11 Squadron bombed the aerodrome and 13 Squadron raided a divisional headquarters at Château St Léger but missed the target. Further north, 60 Squadron shot down three aircraft and DH2s of 24 Squadron, attacked near Morval, shot down two and another during an afternoon patrol. Two aircraft were shot down by 23 Squadron over Bapaume and a 32 Squadron pilot shot down a Roland. A dawn patrol by 70 Squadron attacked &quot;Jasta&quot; 2 and Boelcke shot down the leader over Havrincourt Wood, one aircraft force-landed behind German lines and two came back with mortally wounded observers, for three German aircraft driven down and one crashed (after a collision when attacking the returning aircraft). Six RFC aircraft were lost during the day, with nine crew missing and five wounded, three mortally, the crews claiming aircraft crashed and more driven down. During the afternoon, British patrols met little opposition, including a reconnaissance to Valenciennes and Cambrai. On 16 September, XV Wing aircraft made calls, 12 Squadron bombed Bapaume station and an 18 Squadron aircraft flew into the cable of a balloon, injuring the pilot and killing the balloon and aircraft observers.

====17–22 September====
On 17 September, Boelcke, led a 2 formation of six fighters, against eight BE 2c of 12 Squadron and six FE 2b escorts of 11 Squadron, on a raid to Marcoing station. 2 and seven other German fighters shot down four of the FEs and two BEs before fighters of 60 Squadron arrived and protected the survivors. A dawn raid by 27 Squadron on Cambrai was flown without loss but an aeroplane was lost later on bombing Valenciennes, 70 Squadron lost a Sopwith 1½ Strutter over Cambrai and a 23 squadron aircraft was shot down reconnoitring the Vélu–Épehy–Marcoing area. Four German aircraft were shot down and the stations at Miraumont and Havrincourt Wood bombed without loss. Trenchard reported that aircraft managed to cross the British lines, against sorties over the German lines. The weather grounded the RFC on 18 September and next day 11 Squadron escorted by 60 Squadron were attacked by 2 and a Morane Bullet was shot down, an FE pilot was wounded, another force-landed in Delville Wood and the reconnaissance was abandoned. Poor weather continued for the rest of the week and curtailed flying on the Somme front.

==Aftermath==

===Analysis===

In 2003, Sheffield wrote that the verdict of Wilfrid Miles, the official historian, was accurate, the Germans &quot;...had been dealt a severe blow&quot; but the attack &quot;fell far short of the desired achievement&quot;. The British advanced and at Flers got forward . The German defence had almost collapsed and the British captured of the third position, taking about double the amount of ground taken on 1 July for about half the casualties. The Germans recovered quickly and the Fourth Army was not able to exploit the success due to exhaustion and disorganisation; on the right flank the French took little ground. The battle was a moderately successful set-piece attack by 1916 standards and the British had reached a good position to attack the rest of the German third position. Sheffield wrote that the plan had been too ambitious and mistakes were made in the use of artillery and tanks; given the inexperience of the BEF, a better result would have been surprising.

Prior and Wilson wrote in 2005, that part of the German second position had been captured and the part leading north to Le Sars had been outflanked. It appeared that German resistance in the centre was crumbling but the 41st Division had suffered many losses, its units were much intermingled and in the confusion, a brigade fell back from Flers. Reserve battalions arrived in time to prevent its re-occupation by the Germans but could not advance further. The tanks that had made it onto the battlefield had broken down or been knocked out and German troops were able to conduct several counter-attacks from Gueudecourt. Soon after orders arrived to consolidate. The failure of the attack on the right flank by the XIV Corps divisions, where only the Guards Division reached the first objective, made it impossible for the cavalry to operate and the divisions on the left flank were making a subsidiary attack. The 41st Division and the New Zealand Division had managed swift advances, with the support of some of the tanks that made it onto the battlefield and captured Flers, behind a creeping barrage that showed that tank lanes had been unnecessary.

In 2009, J. P. Harris wrote that, unlike 1 July, the attack was a big success, High Wood, a length of the German first line and of the second line being captured, about or double the amount of 1 July, for about half the casualties. The loss &quot;rate&quot; was about the same and the divisions were exhausted by the end of the day and needed several days to recover. The tanks had broken down, bogged, got lost or knocked out and in some places, their non-appearance had led to infantry being shot down by German machine-gunners in the un-bombarded tank lanes. In other places, the tanks that did reach the German lines were a great help in destroying machine-gun nests. Harris wrote that the same results at a lower cost would have been achieved by resorting to the methodical approach favoured by Rawlinson, even if the tanks had been left out. The capture of the second position may have taken another 24–48 hours but could have left the infantry less depleted and tired, able to attack the third line sooner. The attacks ordered for 16 September were poorly executed and it rained from French attacks were far less successful and Fayolle wanted to relieve all the divisions in the front line; during the delay, British attacks were limited to local operations, the 6th Division capturing the Quadrilateral on 18 September. It took until 25 September to attack the German third position in the Battle of Morval.
In 2009, William Philpott wrote that German historians admitted that the defence almost collapsed on 15 September. The attack was a success because of the third position and all of the intermediate line had been captured, although the fastest advance had been on a flank rather than in the centre. Bigger general attacks worked better than smaller local attacks and almost had a strategic effect but this was not realised by the British commanders, the infantry dug in and the cavalry was not called forward. On 16 September, Rawlinson ordered the victory to be followed up before the Germans recovered but the attacking divisions had suffered and could only manage disjointed local line-straightening attacks. Rainstorms then forced a pause in operations. A faster tempo of attacks had more potential than periodic general attacks, interspersed by numerous small attacks, by denying the Germans time to recover. Foch and Fayolle shared the optimism of the British commanders that decisive results were imminent and Below called the German losses on 15 September serious, even by Somme standards, many of the German battalions losing of their number, depressing the morale of the survivors. The success of the big French attack on 12 September and the British attack on 15 September was followed by an attack on the southern flank by the Tenth Army from Another rain delay interrupted the sequence but on 26 September, the French and British were able to conduct the biggest combined attack since 1 July.

Philpott wrote that English writing tended to portray the attack as an attempt to pull a weakening and demoralised French army forward and an over-optimistic attempt at a decisive battle by Haig. Philpott called this a misunderstanding, the more expansive plans insisted upon by Haig were operational schemes, not tactical directives, for an army which, by September, had become capable of emulating the French armies. It was Haig&#x27;s job to think big, even if all offensives began with trench-to-trench attacks. Looked at in isolation, the September attacks appear to be more of the same, bigger but limited attrition attacks with equally limited results. Studied in context, the attacks reflected the new emphasis by Foch on a concerted offensive, given the impossibility of mounting a combined one. The French attacks in September were bigger and more numerous than the British efforts and were part of a deliberate sequence, the Sixth Army on the Tenth Army on the Fourth Army on and the Reserve Army on 27 September, which brought the German defence to a crisis. The Anglo-French advanced further and faster in September, inflicting more damage on the defenders but until a faster tempo and better supply were achieved, tactical success could not be turned into a strategic victory.

===Tanks===

In his 1963 biography of Haig, John Terraine wrote that after the war, Churchill held that the prospect of a great victory by using tanks en masse had been squandered by their premature use to capture &quot;a few ruined villages&quot;. Swinton wrote that committing the few tanks available was against the advice of those who had been most involved in their development. (&quot;Notes on the Employment of Tanks&quot;, February 1916). Lloyd George wrote that a great secret was wasted on a hamlet not worth capturing. Wilfrid Miles, the official historian, wrote in 1938 that the use of the tanks on 15 September was as mistaken as the German use of gas at the Second Battle of Ypres in 1915, wasting the surprises they created. In his 1959 history of the Royal Tank Corps, Liddell Hart called the decision to use the tanks a long-odds gamble by Haig. Terraine wrote that Haig had found out about the experiments with tracked armoured vehicles in 1915 and sent observers to the 1916 trials in England, after which Haig ordered forty tanks, then increased the order Haig began to consider them as part of the equipment for the battle being planned on the Somme, three months before it commenced. When informed that would be ready by 31 July, he replied that he needed fifty on 1 June and stressed that the tactics of their use must be studied.

Records from GHQ in France, show that as many tanks as possible were going to be used as soon as possible but by 15 September, only ready and only to the battle. Terraine wrote that using tanks in mid-September was not a gamble and the real question was whether tanks could be used at all in 1916, given the slow rate of production, novelty and the need to train crews. Joffre had pressed for another combined attack as big as 1 July, being anxious about the state of the Russian army and had wanted this earlier than 15 September. Haig was equally doubtful about the fighting power of the French and Russian armies and felt that German peace feelers, captured documents showing increased war-weariness and the destruction of Austro-Hungarian units in the Brusilov Offensive, meant that a German collapse was possible. After suffering and losses on the Somme, against an estimated casualties by the end of August, the mid-September attack was the last opportunity for a big combined effort by the French and British in 1916. Terraine wrote that it was absurd to think that a possibly decisive weapon would not be used.

In 2009, Bill Philpott wrote that the début of the tank had been a disappointment, despite their suppression of machine-guns, because of their unreliability, which caused more losses than German counter-fire. Of the fifty tanks in France, assembled for the attack, the British front line and no man&#x27;s land but only six reached the third objective. On 16 September, only three tanks were operational and such losses showed that the tactics of tank warfare had yet to be developed. The tank would have to remain an accessory to a conventional attack, as part of the furniture of tactical attrition, advancing with infantry in co-operation with artillery, rather than as an independent battle-winning weapon. Despite the disappointing results, Haig ordered another The British public was enthusiastic, after reading exaggerated press reports of their feats and in Germany, press reports dwelt on the tanks&#x27; vulnerability to armour-piercing bullets and field artillery. Geoffrey Malins, one of the photographers of the film &quot;The Battle of the Somme&quot; (released on 21 August), titled his new film &quot;The Battle of the Ancre and the Advance of the Tanks&quot; which went on view in January 1917.

For several weeks after 15 September, the Germans were puzzled about the new weapon, being unable to distinguish between accurate reports of their shape and size and more fanciful accounts. The existence of &quot;male&quot; and &quot;female&quot; tanks apparently led Germans to believe that there was a mass of specialist vehicles and the sight of a knocked-out tank north of Flers, caused an officer to conclude that it had a single, wide caterpillar track, which caused much confusion to German military intelligence. On 28 September, an intelligence officer included the report along with an accurate description and that much was still uncertain about how the vehicles were built, how many types there were or how big. Bavarian gunners taken prisoner reported that the tanks were a surprise and that the ( S.m.K. &#x27;pointed projectile with core&#x27;) bullets issued earlier had not been intended for anti-tank fire. The tanks that did confront German and Bavarian troops caused panic and prisoners said that it was not war but butchery. Later in the month, a German intelligence officer wrote that only time would tell if the new weapon was of any value.
A month after its début, German troops were still panicking when confronted by the machines but on 28 September, a party of Germans attacked a bogged tank and managed to get on the roof, only to find that there was still no way to fire inside. Rifle-fire was seen to be futile and machine-gun fire appeared to work only with S.m.K. bullets when concentrated against one part of the armour. It was considered that a hand-grenade would be just as useless but a grenade with the heads of six more wired around it would have enough explosive power if thrown against the tracks. The advice was to lie still, rather than run, then wait for the tanks to go past, to be engaged by artillery of at least calibre, firing at close range. Passive defences such as road obstacles were suggested but not anti-tank ditches or mines.

By the end of 1916, German interrogators were recording comments by British prisoners that tanks were only useful in certain circumstances, that it would take time for the new weapon to mature and that the Germans were equally expected to need more time to counter the tank or build their own. On 5 October, the 6th Army sent a report that the British tactic was thought to be to conceal numbers of tanks close to the front line and use them for infantry support. The British had been able to use them only in small numbers and the tanks had advanced with the infantry, halted at the German front line and fired machine-guns into it. Where gaps appeared in the German defence, the tanks had skilfully driven through and attacked the Germans on the flanks from behind, while others had driven deeper into the position to attack command posts and artillery batteries. The British were also reported to have brought up cavalry to exploit larger breaches and that when tanks had been encountered at close range, German infantry had panicked.
In his 2011 biography of Haig, Gary Sheffield wrote that the tanks had been slow and unreliable and were the cause of huge casualties where tank lanes had been left in the barrage. In August, after watching a demonstration, Haig had written that army thinking about the tactical use of tanks needed to be clarified. The integration of tanks into the BEF &quot;weapons system&quot; that was developing was rudimentary and Rawlinson was much less optimistic about their potential. Sheffield criticised the &quot;20/20 hindsight&quot; of writers who complained that using the tanks was premature and agreed with Haig that it was &quot;folly [to fail] to use every means at my disposal in what was likely to be the crowning effort this year&quot;. With the tanks in France, the secret of their existence would have been revealed before long anyway.

===Air operations===
The German official historians wrote that on the Somme, air operations became vastly more important to ground operations and that

The 2nd Canadian Division recorded that contact patrol aircraft had been the only effective means to find the positions of its most advanced troops. German regimental histories contain frequent references to the ubiquity of the RFC, the historian of RIR 211 writing, &quot;swarms of planes are passing over our trenches...&quot; on 7 September and that firing at the aircraft only resulted in their trenches being bombarded,

 on the Somme had received LFG Roland D.I and Halberstadt D.II fighters early the battle, which were faster and better armed than the obsolete Fokker E.III and inflicted losses on the RFC squadrons equipped with the most inferior aircraft. Lieutenant-Colonel Hugh Dowding, requested that 60 Squadron, after losing its commander, two flight commanders, three pilots and two observers from be withdrawn into reserve. The commander of the RFC in France, Hugh Trenchard agreed but sacked Dowding soon after. RFC casualties increased in mid-September, due to a German reorganisation of air units according to function, units were combined into seven bigger (, fighter squadrons) with new and better Albatros D.Is and hand-picked pilots, trained at Valenciennes in new tactics based on the . The first of the new aircraft for 2 arrived on 16 September. A modest technical superiority and better tactics enabled German aircrew to challenge Anglo-French air supremacy but the more manoeuvrable British fighters, greater numbers and aggressive tactics prevented the Germans from gaining air superiority.

===Subsequent operations===
After the defeat in September, Hindenburg and Ludendorff sacked the 2nd Army Chief of Staff, Colonel Bronsart von Schellendorf and ordered more counter-attacks, a predictable tactic by that period and these were easily repulsed by French and British artillery and small-arms fire. Some of the best German units had been used from the river to St Pierre Vaast Wood from between 20 and 23 September, for the biggest German counter-attacks of the battle but the attempt regained none of the ground lost since 12 September. Only ten per cent of the men necessary to replace casualties could be found, even by using men from the 1917 conscription class, unfit men from garrisons in Germany, support and troops. Increasing casualties forced the German commanders to keep divisions in the line when overdue for relief, yet to limit a division a 14-day period in the line needed a fresh division for the Somme each day and meant that by the end of the month, the German defence faltered, low morale being worsened by the news that Rumania had declared war against the Central Powers.

The Fourth Army attacked again in the Battle of Morval from 25 to 28 September and captured Morval, Gueudecourt and Lesbœufs, which had been the final objectives of the Battle of Flers–Courcelette. The main British attack had been postponed to combine with attacks by the Sixth Army on the village of Combles south of Morval, to close up to the German defences between Moislains and Le Transloy, near the Péronne–Bapaume road (N 17). The combined attack from the Somme River northwards to Martinpuich, was also intended to deprive the German defenders further west near Thiepval of reinforcements, before an attack by the Reserve Army. The postponement was extended from because of rain, which affected operations more frequently during September. The Reserve Army began the Battle of Thiepval Ridge on 26 September.

==Commemoration==
Canadian actions on the Somme are commemorated at the Courcelette Memorial beside the D 929 (Albert–Bapaume) road, just south of the village. The New Zealand Memorial to the New Zealand Division on the Somme is found on the former site of the Switch Line, on a lane off the D 197 running north of Longueval (GPS co-ordinates 50.039501 2.801512) and the New Zealand Division memorial to the Missing in France is near the Commonwealth War Graves Commission Caterpillar Valley Cemetery, just east of Longueval. The 41st Division erected a memorial in Flers, commemorating the capture of the village; topped with a bronze battle dressed soldier, the statue is well known as the photograph on the battlefield tour guide &quot;Before Endeavours Fade&quot; (Rose Coombs). The statue by Albert Toft is the same figure used at the Royal London Fusiliers Monument in London and Oldham War Memorial. A memorial cross to the Guards Division is on the side of the C 5 road between Ginchy and Lesbœufs. A memorial cross to the 47th London Division is near the D 107 road just inside High Wood, between Martinpuich and Longueval.

<text>A gametocyte is a eukaryotic germ cell that divides by mitosis into other gametocytes or by meiosis into gametids during gametogenesis. Male gametocytes are called &quot;spermatocytes&quot;, and female gametocytes are called &quot;oocytes&quot;.

== Development ==

The development of gametogonia to primary gametocytes is called gametocytogenesis. The further development of primary gametocytes to secondary gametocytes is a part of gametidogenesis.
Gametogenesis is the formation or production of gametes (taking place during meiosis). The development and maturation of sex cells also takes place during meiosis.
Gametogenesis is also the process of formation in male and female gametes that occur in the gonads (ovary and testis). Both male and female produce gametes. Male gametocytes are called spermatocytes and female gametocytes are called oocytes.
The term gametocyte is also used, for example, when talking about gametocytes of species like &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot; or &quot;Plasmodium vivax&quot;, which transmit malaria.

==Malaria==

Gametocytes, the precursors of male and female gametes, of malaria parasites (&quot;Plasmodium&quot; spp.) are formed in the human host through the developmental switch from asexual replication in erythrocytes. Although gametocytes are not responsible for clinical symptoms, they ensure the transmission of malaria to another host. Upon taking a blood meal, gametocytes are transferred to a mosquito&#x27;s midgut lumen, where they differentiate into male and female gametes. After complete sexual reproduction and successive processes of sporogonic development, mature sporozoites accumulate in the vector&#x27;s salivary gland, ready to be inoculated into a new host. Therefore, the presence of gametocytes in circulation of infected individuals is imperative for malaria to remain endemic in a given community.

Male and female gametocytes are the components of the malaria parasite life cycle which are taken up from an infected host bloodstream by mosquitoes and thus mediate disease transmission. These gamete precursors are quite distinct from their asexual blood stage counterparts and this is reflected in their distinct patterns of gene expression, cellular development, and metabolism.

===&quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot;===

 &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot; is a protozoan parasite, one of the species that causes malaria in humans. A gametocyte in &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot; is a cell specializing in the transition between the human and the mosquito host. Gametocytes arise from erythrocytic asexual stages. The production of gametocytes directly from hepatic merozoites, which has been described in other species, does not occur in &quot;P. falciparum&quot;. Gametocytes are capable of inducing specific humoral IgG, and cellular responses, which include induction of TNFa (protein coding), IFNg(gene protein coding) and gd+ lymphocyte proliferation, in addition to immune responses to other stages of the parasite. There has been much debate on the actual point of sexual differentiation and many people have shown that merozoites emerging from a single schizont developed either into further asexual stages or into gametocytes. It has been further shown that the gametocytes from one schizont are all male or all female. This suggests that the trophozoites of the preceding asexual generation were already committed to either sexual development or continuing asexual cycling. In order to adjust to life in such drastically different environments, many changes occur in its cell biology, metabolism, gene expression and protein synthesis. Gametocytes of &quot;P. falciparum&quot; have been shown to exhibit a different pattern of gene expression than asexual stages, which is unsurprising if one were to consider the difference between these two stages. Transcription and translation levels are not constant during gametocytogenesis: this was shown in drug sensitivity studies where RNA and protein synthesis levels were much more important in the early than the late gametocyte stages. Furthermore, a sex-specific expression has also been discovered, with differences in RNA, mitochondria and ribosome content. The female is preparing for a continued development, and the male is terminally differentiated and only needs what is necessary for exflagellation (cell division cycle, dynein and α-tubulin II). &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot; is both the most deadly and most researched species of malaria. The majority of the research conducted is to find a vaccine or treatment for the disease. Some believe that due to the ineffectiveness of the past, any vaccine found will most likely not become completely effective. Others remain hopeful, citing the fact that the species complex life cycle offers numerous options for vaccines and treatments, as well as the proof that partial immunity does occur in endemic areas in some people.

Mature macrogametocytes are female and mature microgametocytes are male. In &quot;P. falciparum&quot;, gametocytes are produced from asexual stages. All the gametocytes produced from one sexually committed schizont are of the same sex, suggesting that sex is determined at the very beginning of sexual development. However, gametocyte sex can only be microscopically differentiated from stage III and onward. They are crescent- or sausage- shaped.

===&quot;Plasmodium vivax&quot;===

&quot;Plasmodium vivax&quot; is a protozoal parasite transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes, and is the cause of one of the most common forms of malaria. Gametocyte carriage is essential for malaria transmission and endemicity of disease; thereby it is a target for malaria control strategies. Malaria-infected individuals may harbour gametocytes below the microscopic detection threshold that can be detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction targeting gametocyte-specific mRNA. Although it is not one of the most dangerous forms, it affects many people annually, and can be somewhat resistant to drugs that are typically used to treat malaria. Once contracted, it can remain in the liver for years if left untreated with the appropriate medications. Given that the condition often occurs in poorer parts of the world, these medications are not always available, and some people continue to experience the effects of &quot;Plasmodium vivax&quot; for years. These infections take their toll on poor countries in other ways because many hospitalizations are due to initial symptoms of malaria and are costly. When people are first affected by &quot;Plasmodium vivax&quot;, they frequently show symptoms of high fever, chills, fatigue and profuse sweating. These symptoms often last for a period of about two to three days, but the process may be complicated if a person has additional illnesses. Other symptoms include vomiting, muscle aches, dizziness or a fever that comes and goes. After this primary infection, the disease can go dormant, but the symptoms may return regularly and other conditions like jaundice can develop because &quot;Plasmodium vivax&quot; establishes itself in the liver. There is no vaccine for &quot;Plasmodium vivax&quot;, though people who travel to areas with high malaria incidence may receive treatment for it, which is administration of a 14-day course of the drugs chloroquine and primaquine.
