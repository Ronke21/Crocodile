<text>Philip Michael Rivers (born December 8, 1981) is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 17 seasons, primarily with the Chargers franchise. He played college football for the NC State Wolfpack and was selected fourth overall in the 2004 NFL draft by the New York Giants, who traded him to the San Diego Chargers during the draft. Rivers was a member of the Chargers for 16 seasons and played his final season for the Indianapolis Colts. Since 2021, he has served as the head football coach at St. Michael Catholic High School in Fairhope, Alabama.

After spending his first two seasons as a backup, Rivers served as the Chargers&#x27; starting quarterback from 2006 to 2019. During his tenure, he was named to eight Pro Bowls while leading the team to six postseason appearances and four division titles. Rivers also helped the franchise win their first playoff game since 1994 and reach the AFC Championship Game in the 2007 season. With the Colts in 2020, he reached the playoffs a seventh time. He was less successful in the postseason and never made a Super Bowl appearance.

Rivers retired fifth all-time in passing yards and touchdowns, both of which are the highest-ranking among quarterbacks without Super Bowl appearances. He is also second all-time in consecutive regular season starts by a quarterback, having started every regular season game between 2006 and 2020. Rivers is considered among the greatest quarterbacks to have never played in a Super Bowl.

==Early life==
Rivers was born in Decatur, Alabama, where his father, Steve, was the head coach of Decatur High&#x27;s football team and his mother, Joan, was a teacher. As part of a fifth-grade project, he had to make a poster about his dreams and aspirations. On the poster, he pasted his face over that of a Minnesota Vikings player who had appeared on a cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. Rivers&#x27; first start in an official game came in the seventh grade, in 1994. He has worn the number 17 jersey since the ninth grade, in honor of his father, who wore the same number in high school. After his dad got the head coaching job, Rivers played high school football at Athens High School in nearby Athens.

As Rivers&#x27; senior season unfolded, he established himself as the best prep passer in the state. Although he had offers from Auburn and Alabama, neither projected him as a starting quarterback. Rivers rejected them in order to go to a program where he would have more playing time. The first college to seriously recruit Rivers as a quarterback was North Carolina State. Joe Pate convinced Rivers and his parents to consider graduating from high school in December 1999.

==College career==
After high school, Rivers attended North Carolina State University in Raleigh, North Carolina, where he played for coach Chuck Amato&#x27;s Wolfpack football team. Rivers enrolled in January and suited up for his first practice as a college quarterback in the spring of 2000.

===2000 season===
As a freshman in 2000, Rivers led NC State to an 8–4 record, including a win against Minnesota in the MicronPC Bowl. Four of the Wolfpack&#x27;s victories were comebacks. In his debut, a 38–31 double-overtime win over Arkansas State, he passed for 397 yards and three touchdowns. He directed a 74-yard game-tying drive as time expired. A week later, he threw for 401 yards in a 41–38 win against Indiana. The performance was highlighted by a timely 47-yard pass to future first round pick Koren Robinson with under a minute to go. Against Duke, NC State trailed 31–28 late in the fourth quarter when Rivers scored a rushing touchdown on a seven-yard run. Rivers threw for a season-high 413 yards to go along with three touchdowns and one interception For the season, Rivers passed for 3,054 yards and 25 touchdowns. He broke a half-dozen school passing marks, was ACC Rookie of the Week a record eight times, and earned honors as the conference Freshman of the Year. For the first time since Roman Gabriel ran the Wolfpack offense in the early 1960s, NC State had an All-American caliber quarterback.

===2001 season===
As a sophomore in 2001, Rivers connected for 2,586 yards and 16 touchdowns. His 65.2 percent completion mark led the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). The Wolfpack finished the 2001 campaign at 7–4 and made a return trip to the Tangerine Bowl. The quarterback had a good game against Pitt in a 34–19 loss, passing for 189 yards and a touchdown.

===2002 season===
In 2002, Rivers led the Wolfpack to victories in their first nine games, which led to a number #10 ranking in the AP Poll. It was the best start in the school&#x27;s history. The season took a disappointing turn however when they lost three consecutive ACC contests, but NC State defeated Florida State by a score of 17–7 in their season finale, and received an invitation to play against Notre Dame in the Gator Bowl. Once again, Rivers delivered an MVP performance in the most important game of the year, pacing the Wolfpack to a dominating 28–6 win over Notre Dame. In the victory, Rivers was 23-of-37 for 228 passing yards and two passing touchdowns. The game would set up a remarkable year for Rivers in 2003.

===2003 season===
As a senior in 2003, Rivers threw for 4,491 yards and 34 touchdowns in 12 games, capping his career as the most productive and durable quarterback in ACC history.

In the 2003 season, Rivers passed for over 300 yards eight times and 400 yards four times to go along with 29 touchdowns in the regular season. He led the ACC in passing attempts, completions, yards, and touchdowns. NC State finished with a 7–5 record to qualify for a bowl game.

Rivers&#x27;s time at NC State had a positive ending, leading the Wolfpack to a 56–26 win over Kansas in his third Tangerine Bowl. In the victory, he threw for a career-high 475 yards and five touchdowns. Philip earned his second straight bowl MVP award. At the end of the season, Rivers was named ACC Player of the Year for the 2003 football season and ACC Athlete of the Year for 2003–04. He was considered a Heisman candidate during the season, but he was not invited to the Heisman Trophy presentation, where he finished in seventh place.

===Legacy===
During his collegiate career, Rivers shattered almost every NC State and ACC passing record. He started 51 straight games and completed a conference record 1,147 passes in 1,710 tries, with 95 touchdowns. His career culminated with an NCAA record 51st consecutive college start. The Wolfpack went to four consecutive bowl games under the leadership of Rivers, winning three of them. Rivers finished his career at NC State with 13,484 passing yards, 13th all-time among Division I quarterbacks (he finished in second place at the end of his collegiate career). He also threw 95 touchdown passes, which tied him for eighth all-time with Kliff Kingsbury and Brady Quinn. Rivers&#x27; number was retired before his final home game at North Carolina State.

===College statistics===
==Professional career==
Rivers was projected to be an early first-round pick in the 2004 NFL draft. However, despite Rivers&#x27; record of success in college and high accuracy (72 completion percentage for his senior season), questions about his lack of arm strength and his unorthodox side-arm throwing motion were concerns for some NFL general managers. The pre-draft consensus was that Rivers could be selected by the Pittsburgh Steelers with the 11th pick. The San Diego Chargers coveted Eli Manning and wanted to select him with their first round pick, which was also the first overall pick of the draft. However, after Manning indicated before the draft that he would not sign with them, Rivers was their first alternative because the Chargers&#x27; head coach at the time, Marty Schottenheimer, had coached him at the Senior Bowl and he liked what he saw. The Chargers agreed to a draft day deal with the New York Giants. San Diego selected Manning first, then traded him to New York for Rivers, selected fourth by the Giants, plus draft picks later used by the Chargers on future Pro Bowlers Shawne Merriman and Nate Kaeding.

Rivers was one of 17 quarterbacks taken in the 2004 NFL Draft, along with Manning and the Steelers&#x27; Ben Roethlisberger. All three would enjoy lengthy and successful careers with the teams that signed them and have been compared favorably to the 1983 NFL draft, which included Hall of Fame quarterbacks John Elway, Jim Kelly, and Dan Marino. Unlike Manning and Roethlisberger, who each have two championship titles, Rivers did not reach the Super Bowl during his career. Nevertheless, he is the highest in touchdowns, completion percentage, TD–INT ratio, passer rating, and Pro Bowl honors of the three. Rivers also retired with the most passing yards and pass completions.

===San Diego / Los Angeles Chargers===
====2004 season====
In August 2004, Rivers signed a six-year, $40.5 million contract with the San Diego Chargers that included $14.5 million in signing bonuses. However, due to a protracted contract negotiation with the San Diego Chargers, Rivers only reported to the team during the last week of training camp, and incumbent Drew Brees retained his starting job. Rivers began the season as the Chargers&#x27; third quarterback option, behind Doug Flutie, and ahead of the fourth quarterback on the depth chart, Cleo Lemon. Unfortunately for Rivers, Brees went on to have a then-career year and was named to the NFL Pro Bowl while winning the NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award. Rivers received very limited playing time, playing in only two games. He only threw passes in the second half of the last game of the 2004 season, a victory over the Kansas City Chiefs, by which time the Chargers had already clinched a home playoff spot and the AFC West division title. In the victory, he threw his first touchdown pass to fellow rookie Malcom Floyd. He was not on the active roster for San Diego&#x27;s Wild Card Round playoff loss to the New York Jets.

====2005 season====


Rivers was promoted to second on the Chargers quarterback depth chart after Flutie was released. Rivers was unable to beat out Brees for the starting quarterback job in the Chargers&#x27; 2005 training camp and preseason. In the Chargers&#x27; final game of the 2005 season, at home in Qualcomm Stadium, Rivers entered the game after Brees dislocated his right shoulder late in the second quarter due to a hit from Denver Broncos safety John Lynch. Rivers completed 12 of 22 passing attempts for 115 yards with one interception and two fumbles. The Chargers lost to Denver, 23–7. However, Rivers led the Chargers on their only scoring drive that game, which culminated in a four-yard touchdown run by running back LaDainian Tomlinson.

====2006 season====

 After the 2005 season, Brees was not re-signed (partly due to the injury suffered in the Denver game) by the Chargers. Instead he signed a large contract that included sizeable guaranteed money with the New Orleans Saints, during the 2006 free agency period. Many doubted the Chargers&#x27; decision to change quarterbacks as they were a Super Bowl contender, believing that Rivers&#x27; inexperience would hinder them. Rivers was named the Chargers&#x27; starter going into training camp. Expectations were high for Rivers due to the large amount of talent on the Chargers&#x27; offense and the performance of his peers from the 2004 draft (Eli Manning and Ben Roethlisberger) as starters.

Football Outsiders projected that Rivers would become an NFL star before the 2006 season due to his spectacular completion percentage in college (72% as a senior). After just five NFL starts, Rivers was named the second best NFL quarterback under 25 years of age by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;.

On September 11, 2006, Rivers made his first NFL start against the Oakland Raiders. Rivers managed the game well despite only passing 11 times, but completed 8 passes, one for a touchdown, in a 27–0 rout of the Raiders. After his first game, Rivers led the league in quarterback rating with 133.9.

The fifth week of the season, the reigning Super Bowl champion Pittsburgh Steelers came to town, and Bill Cowher&#x27;s defensive game plan revolved around stopping running back LaDainian Tomlinson. This game marked a turning point for Rivers, who, aided by head coach Marty Schottenheimer&#x27;s opening of the playbook, led the team in a come-from-behind victory, throwing 24-of-37 for 242 yards and two touchdowns, winning 23–13.

On November 12, 2006, Rivers had the best game of his young career and led the Chargers to an improbable comeback on the road against the Cincinnati Bengals. Down 28–7 at halftime, Rivers led the Chargers on six drives culminating in touchdowns. After driving in for the Chargers first touchdown after halftime, Nick Hardwick, the Chargers&#x27; center, reminisced about Rivers, mimicking his southern drawl, &quot;He&#x27;s yelling &#x27;Y&#x27;all don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re out of this&#x27; to the Bengals. When he said that, I said, &#x27;Shoot, I guess we ain&#x27;t out of this. Right on.&#x27;&quot; He threw for 337 yards and three touchdown passes, while LaDainian Tomlinson scored three of their four rushing touchdowns. San Diego outscored Cincinnati 42–13 in the second half, winning the game 49–41, matching the largest comeback in franchise history from 23 years before for the Chargers.

The following week, against what was considered at the time to be a strong Denver Broncos defense, the Chargers became the first team in NFL history to win back-to-back road games after trailing by 17 or more points and also the first team to win four straight when allowing at least 27 points in each game. Rivers led several 4th quarter comebacks in 2006, and posted the league&#x27;s highest 4th quarter quarterback rating. His performance over the season led to his selection to the 2007 Pro Bowl. Rivers helped lead the Chargers to the highest-scoring offense in the NFL. After a 14–2 season the Chargers had home field advantage and were set to play the New England Patriots in the Divisional Round of the playoffs. However, the Patriots won that game 24–21, and Schottenheimer was fired amid conflicts with team president Dean Spanos.

====2007 season====

Norv Turner took over as head coach of the Chargers in 2007. After a 1–3 start, the Chargers turned their season around, finishing 11–5 and winning the AFC West for the second straight year. Rivers finished the season with 3,152 passing yards, 21 touchdowns, and 15 interceptions.

The Chargers won their first two playoff games since the 1994 season, beating the Tennessee Titans in the Wild Card Round and the Indianapolis Colts in the Divisional Round before falling to the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game 21–12. In the 2007 AFC Championship Game, Rivers&#x27; was lauded by his teammates and the press for playing the entire game with a torn anterior cruciate ligament, which later required surgery and was ranked among the &quot;NFL Top 10 Gutsiest Performances&quot;. Chris Harry of the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; said &quot;I don&#x27;t think anyone will ever accuse Philip Rivers of being soft.&quot; Kevin Acee of &quot;The San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; said, &quot;To go out there and put his knee, and ultimately his career, on the line. It has to go down as one of the gutsiest performances.&quot;

====2008 season====


In 2008, Rivers led the NFL in multiple categories including touchdown passes (34), passer rating (105.5), yards per pass attempt (8.4), and adjusted yards per attempt (8.8). In Week 2, against the Denver Broncos, he had a season-high 377 passing yards, three touchdowns, and one interception in the 39–38 loss. On December 28, 2008, Rivers set the Chargers team record for touchdown passes in a season with 34, a record previously held by Dan Fouts, who had 33 in 1981. After a 4–8 start, Rivers threw 11 touchdown passes and one interception to win the final four games of the season, winning the AFC West division on a season-finale 52–21 tie-breaking win over the Denver Broncos. On January 3, 2009, in the Wild Card Round, the San Diego Chargers defeated the Indianapolis Colts to advance to the AFC Divisional Playoff. Rivers led the Chargers down the field down three points with under two minutes left. He set up Nate Kaeding for a game-tying field goal that would lead to overtime, where the Chargers would go on to win 23–17, thanks to a Darren Sproles touchdown. In the Divisional Round 35–24 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers, Rivers played well, throwing for over 300 yards and three touchdowns, but was sacked four times and threw an interception. They possessed the ball for only 17 seconds during the third quarter and had only 15 yards rushing.

====2009 season====

On August 24, 2009, Rivers signed a six-year, $92 million contract extension with the Chargers, with approximately $38 million guaranteed. Rivers was voted into his second career Pro Bowl on December 29. He ended the season with a passer rating of 104.4, the third highest in the NFL, after passing for 4,254 yards, 28 touchdowns, and only nine interceptions. For the second consecutive year, he led the NFL in yards per attempt (8.8) and adjusted yards per attempt (9.1). He led the Chargers to the second seed in the AFC with a 13–3 record, tied for second best in the NFL. In the Divisional Round, Rivers was 27–40 for 298 yards while rushing and throwing for a touchdown and was intercepted twice in the 17–14 loss to the New York Jets.

====2010 season====

Rivers led the league in passing yards, throwing for a career-high 4,710 yards. The Chargers started off the year slowly again at 3–5 and finished a disappointing 9–7 and their four-year reign as AFC West champions ended while they missed the playoffs. In Week 3, against the Seattle Seahawks, Rivers threw for 455 yards and two passing touchdowns in a losing effort 20–27. These 455 yards broke the franchise single-game record for most passing yardage, previously held by Dan Fouts, who had 444 in 1982. Rivers recorded 431 and threw two passing touchdowns, but lost to the Oakland Raiders in Week 5. In Week 8, Rivers threw for 305 yards, with two passing touchdowns and one interception in a 33–25 win against the Tennessee Titans, extending his active player-leading streak to 21 games with a touchdown thrown and giving him the record for most passing yards (2,649) ever after 8 games, passing Fouts&#x27; previous record (2,580). Rivers threw for four passing touchdowns, two to backup tight end Randy McMichael and the other two to rookie receiver Seyi Ajirotutu in a comeback 29–23 victory over the Houston Texans. The Chargers&#x27; top receivers Gates (torn plantar fascia), Vincent Jackson (suspended), Malcom Floyd (hamstring), and Legedu Naanee (hamstring) did not play in the game. Rivers lost his first ever game in December, a 13–28 loss at home against the Raiders. Rivers was invited to the 2011 Pro Bowl, his fourth invite overall, and started in place of an injured Tom Brady. It was the first time he played in a Pro Bowl, twice missing previous games due to injury and once for the birth of his child in the 2010 Pro Bowl. Rivers was named the quarterback in the 2010 NFL Alumni Player of the Year Awards over Brady, who was unanimously named The Associated Press 2010 Most Valuable Player. He was ranked 26th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2011.

====2011 season====

Entering the 2011 season, Nick Canepa of the &quot;San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; called Rivers a &quot;better quarterback&quot; than Fouts, a first-ballot Hall of Fame quarterback. Canepa cited Rivers &quot;[completing] passes to an astounding 17 different receivers&quot; in 2010, amid the injuries to Chargers receivers, and his then 55–25 record as a starter compared to 86–84–1 for Fouts. He also noted, &quot;Fouts made more mistakes than Rivers.&quot; Rivers had completed 63.7 percent of his 2,455 passes with 58 interceptions and a 97.2 passer rating, while Fouts was successful on 58.8 percent of his 5,604 attempts with 242 interceptions and an 80.2 rating. Rivers had never thrown more than two interceptions in a game, including seven playoff games. His passer rating was the highest in league history, and he had the second-best touchdown-to-interception ratio of all-time (136/58).

Rivers and the Chargers started out the season with a 24–17 win over the Minnesota Vikings. Rivers had 335 passing yards and two touchdowns thrown to fullback Mike Tolbert but also threw two interceptions. Rivers and the Chargers lost 35–21 in Foxboro to the New England Patriots in Week 2. Rivers threw for 378 passing yards and had two touchdown passes to Vincent Jackson but also threw two interceptions again. Rivers threw two interceptions for the third game in a row as the Chargers held off the winless Kansas City Chiefs in Week 3, 20–17. In Week 4, the Chargers beat the winless Miami Dolphins 26–16, and Rivers threw a 55-yard touchdown to Vincent Jackson.
In Week 5, Rivers threw for 250 yards and a touchdown pass to Malcom Floyd. He added a rushing touchdown as well. Despite two turnovers by him, the Chargers held off the Denver Broncos by a score of 29–24.

Rivers struggled in Week 7 after the bye. Rex Ryan&#x27;s New York Jets limited Rivers to 179 passing yards and two interceptions. He did throw a touchdown to Antonio Gates, his first of the year.
The Chargers lost 23–20 to the Chiefs in overtime on Halloween. Rivers put up 369 yards, but had two interceptions and a crushing fumble. This fumble occurred while Rivers was kneeling to set up a potential game-winning field goal with the game tied at 20. The Chiefs went on to win 23–20 in overtime. This loss, more specifically the fumbled kneel, was seen as the first domino to fall at the end of the season, as the Chargers, Raiders, and Broncos all finished 8–8, but the Broncos won the AFC West over both San Diego and Oakland due to tiebreakers. 
Rivers&#x27; poor performance during the 2011 season led to media speculation that he may have been suffering from an undisclosed injury. His former teammate, LaDainian Tomlinson, speculated that Rivers might be distracted by the burden of being the Chargers&#x27; star player.
Rivers had 385 yards passing and added four touchdowns, but threw three interceptions against the defending champion Green Bay Packers.
Rivers threw for 274 passing yards and an interception and a fumble in a 24–17 Week 10 loss against the Oakland Raiders. He did however, throw two passing touchdowns to rookie Vincent Brown.
Rivers threw for 280 yards and two passing touchdowns in a 31–20 loss to the Chicago Bears. He added 2 more interceptions thrown. The touchdown passes went to Antonio Gates and Vincent Jackson.
The Chargers lost 16–13 in overtime to Tim Tebow and the Broncos. Rivers threw for 188 yards and a touchdown to Antonio Gates. The Chargers finally won a game in Week 13, dominating the Jacksonville Jaguars 38–14. Rivers finished with 294 passing yards and 3 touchdowns. Rivers and the Chargers dominated the Buffalo Bills in Week 14, winning 37–10. Philip threw for 240 yards and 3 touchdowns, 2 to Antonio Gates, and the other to Patrick Crayton. Rivers and the Chargers dominated the Baltimore Ravens in Week 15. Philip had 270 yards and a touchdown to Malcom Floyd in a 34–14 stomping.
Rivers and the Chargers struggled in Week 16. On Christmas Eve, the Chargers fell 38–10 in Detroit to the Lions. Rivers had 299 passing yards and a touchdown, but two interceptions.

Rivers concluded the season by throwing for 310 passing yards and 3 touchdowns, which were received by Floyd, Jackson, and Gates, in a 38–26 win against the Raiders, ending the Raiders&#x27; playoff hopes that season. He was named to the Pro Bowl for his 2011 season. He was ranked 61st by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2012.

====2012 season====

The Chargers began the 2012 season with a 3–1 record for the second consecutive season. In a 37–20 win over the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 4, Rivers started his 100th career game, which was also his 100th consecutive start. On November 1, in the second game against the Kansas City Chiefs, he was 18-of-20 passes to earn a career-high 90% completion percentage in the 31–13 victory. Rivers became the seventh fastest quarterback in NFL history to reach 25,000 career yards. With a weak offensive line that season, Rivers was frequently forced to scramble and was sacked 49 times and hit on 70 other plays, contributing to his 22 turnovers—47 over the previous two seasons. Rivers finished the season with 3,606 passing yards, 26 touchdowns, and 15 interceptions. The Chargers&#x27; 7–9 record was the first losing season in Rivers&#x27;s career, and the team&#x27;s first since 2003. They missed the playoffs for the third straight season, leading to the firing of Turner and general manager A. J. Smith.

====2013 season====

Rivers&#x27;s combined 35 interceptions the two previous seasons led many to wonder whether he was injured or if his career was on the decline. Only two offensive coaches returned in 2013 in an overhauled coaching staff led by new head coach Mike McCoy, and a revamped offensive system had Rivers release the ball earlier and taking what opposing defenses conceded. In their Week 2 win over the Philadelphia Eagles, he threw for 419 yards and three touchdowns. In their Week 4 win over the Dallas Cowboys, Rivers set an NFL record for completion percentage (83%) for a quarterback who also threw for over 400 yards (401), three touchdowns, and one interception. In Week 7, Rivers surpassed 30,000 career yards passing. Rivers was also selected to the Pro Bowl for the fifth time in his career. In Week 17, against the Kansas City Chiefs, Rivers led a fourth quarter and overtime comeback to win the game, and clinch the 6th seed in the AFC playoffs.

During the Chargers season-ending four-game winning streak, Rivers completed 67.3 percent of his passes with nine touchdowns and a 142.6 rating. He finished the season completing 378 of 544 passes (69.5 percent) for 4,478 yards, 32 touchdowns and just 11 interceptions; his 105.5 passer rating tied his career high from 2008. With the Chargers having a capable running attack, an adjusted offensive line, and an improved defense, Rivers was not pressured to force his throws, and he led all quarterbacks in the league with a 49.4 third-down conversion rate when passing. He led the Chargers to a 27–10 win in the Wild Card Round against the Cincinnati Bengals before losing to the Denver Broncos in the Divisional Round, 24–17. He was named Comeback Player of the Year by both Associated Press (AP) and Pro Football Writers Association (PFWA). He was ranked 34th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2014.

====2014 season====

The Chargers in 2014 lost their final game of the season when a win would have qualified them for the playoffs. Rivers was sacked a career-high seven times in the loss. For the season, he was voted by the Chargers as their MVP after finishing with 4,286 yards, 31 touchdowns, and 18 interceptions. It was the sixth season in which he passed for over 4,000 yards. During Weeks 2–6, he became the first NFL player ever to have a passer rating over 120 for five consecutive games. Later in the season, Rivers suffered from sore ribs and a back injury, but he denied that they affected his performance. His 71.2 rating in December was his lowest in a single month since November 2007 (68.8). He finished the 2014 season with 4,286 passing yards, 31 touchdowns, and 18 interceptions. He was ranked 43rd by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2015.

====2015 season====

On August 15, 2015, the Chargers and Rivers agreed to a four-year, $84 million contract extension. Rivers started the 2015 season with 403 passing yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions in the 33–28 victory over the Detroit Lions. On September 20, Rivers threw his 255th touchdown pass as a Charger, passing Dan Fouts as the franchise leader in touchdown passes. On October 18, in a game against the Green Bay Packers, Rivers set franchise records with 503 passing yards, 43 completions, and 65 attempts. In Week 12, against the Jacksonville Jaguars, he had 300 passing yards and season-high four passing touchdowns. The Chargers finished with a 4–12 record, last in the AFC West, their worst record since 2003. The Chargers went winless against divisional opponents for the first time since 1984. However, the Chargers did manage a 30–14 victory. against the Miami Dolphins during Week 15 at home. After the game, Rivers and several other Chargers players returned to the field to sign autographs for the fans, as they were unsure if it would be the team&#x27;s final time playing in San Diego. Rivers would gift the shoes he wore to two fans in the stadium to show his appreciation. The team would ultimately stay in the city the following season.

Despite the disappointing season, Rivers set career highs and franchise records with 437 pass completions on 661 pass attempts and 4,792 passing yards, which ranked second among NFL quarterbacks in 2015. He finished 11 yards short of breaking the franchise single-season passing yards record held by Fouts. Rivers was invited to the 2016 Pro Bowl as an alternate but declined the invitation, citing personal reasons. He was ranked 46th on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2016.

====2016 season====

Rivers and the Chargers started the 2016 season with a 1–4 record. In that stretch, Rivers passed for four touchdowns in two separate games. On October 13, 2016, in Week 6, Rivers passed Fouts to become the Chargers&#x27; all-time passing yards leader. In Week 7, against the Atlanta Falcons, he had a season-high 371 passing yards, one touchdown, and one interception in the 33–30 victory. Following the win over the Falcons, the Chargers alternated losses and wins until Week 13, where they had a five-game losing streak to end the season. Rivers finished the season with nine consecutive games throwing for at least touchdowns. Despite throwing for 33 touchdowns, Rivers threw a career-high and league-leading 21 interceptions and completed only 60.4 of his passes, the second worst of his career. Rivers posted a rating of 87.9, also the second worst of his career. These struggles resulted in the Chargers finishing 5–11 and last in the division for the second straight year. He was ranked 73rd by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2017.

====2017 season====

Rivers and the Chargers started the 2017 season with some tough results.

Rivers, a devout Roman Catholic, married his junior high school sweetheart, Tiffany, in 2001. She converted to Catholicism. They have seven daughters and three sons.

Rivers is a social conservative; during the 2012 Republican Party presidential primaries, he endorsed former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum.

In 2011, he was named one of three finalists for the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award for his work with the Rivers of Hope Foundation, an endeavor he and his wife oversaw from 2010 to 2012 to help foster children. The foundation raised more than $1,000,000 for the cause through football camps, a 5K Fun Run and personal contributions from Rivers. The foundation supported the San Pasqual Academy, a residential education campus designed specifically for foster teens.

Rivers comes from an athletic family. He, his father Steve, and his younger brother Stephen have all played college football. Steve played linebacker at Mississippi State in the 1970s. Stephen committed to play college football at Louisiana State University (LSU) after attending Austin High School and Athens High School. On June 5, 2014, he transferred to Vanderbilt University and was eligible to play immediately, but wound up transferring to Northwestern State University for the 2015 season.

Rivers received an honorary degree, doctor of humane letters, and addressed the class of 2014 at the 125th annual commencement ceremony of the Catholic University of America (CUA) on May 17, 2014.

In 2014, Rivers was part of a campaign to benefit the Ronald McDonald House Charities of San Diego.

On August 26, 2021, Rivers won his first game as a high school football head coach, leading the St. Michael Catholic Cardinals to a 49–0 victory. Rivers was inspired to coach by his father, who was his high school football coach. His oldest son, Gunner, is St. Michael&#x27;s starting quarterback in the 2023 season.

<text>The Walter E. Fernald State School, later the Walter E. Fernald Developmental Center, was the Western hemisphere&#x27;s oldest publicly funded institution serving people with developmental disabilities. Under its third superintendent, Walter Fernald, it became a model for state institutions for the developmentally disabled. It later was the scene of medical experiments in the 20th century. Investigations into this research led to new regulations regarding human research in children.

The school occupies a property off Trapelo Road in Waltham, Massachusetts.

==History==

===Early history===
The Fernald Center, originally called the Experimental School for Teaching and Training Idiotic Children, was founded in Boston by reformer Samuel Gridley Howe in 1848 with a $2,500 appropriation from the Massachusetts State Legislature. The school gradually moved to a new permanent location in Waltham between 1888 and 1891. It eventually encompassed 72 buildings across . At its peak, the school confined some 2,500 people, most of them &quot;feeble-minded&quot; boys.

Under its third superintendent, Walter E. Fernald (1859–1924), the school was viewed as a model educational facility in the field of mental retardation and doctors and politicians from across the country and the world would travel to Waltham to study the methods employed at the center. Fernald was instrumental in the establishment of the first independent farm colony for the disabled (The Templeton Colony) and early concepts of special education. However, though he never supported forced sterilization, Fernald was an important figure in the eugenics movement, advocating for the segregation of mentally disabled children from society and coining the term “Defective Delinquent” to describe criminally-inclined mentally disabled children. It wasn’t until the end of his life that he had a reversal of many of these ideas, fighting against the segregation of most mentally disabled children, rejecting IQ tests, and supporting community education and out-patient clinics. However, by this time, many of his ideas about forced segregation and mass institutionalization had already entered the American mainstream. The school was renamed in his honor in 1925, following his death the previous year.

The institution did serve a large population of children with cognitive disabilities (referred to as &quot;mentally retarded children&quot;), but &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; estimates that upwards of half of the inmates tested with IQs in the normal range. In the 20th century, living conditions were spartan or worse; approximately 36 children slept in each dormitory room. There were also reports of physical and sexual abuse.

===Nuclear medicine research in children===
The Fernald School was the site of the 1946–53 joint experiments by Harvard University and MIT that exposed young male children to tracer doses of radioactive isotopes. Documents obtained in 1994 by the United States Department of Energy revealed the following details:
*The experiment was conducted in part by a research fellow sponsored by the Quaker Oats Company. Part of the study involved adding radioactive iron and calcium into oatmeal and milk, then feeding the mixture to Fernald students.
*MIT Professor of Nutrition Robert S. Harris led the experiment, which studied the absorption of calcium and iron.
*The boys were encouraged to join a &quot;Science Club&quot;, which offered larger portions of food, parties, and trips to Boston Red Sox baseball games.
*The 57 club members ate iron-enriched cereals and calcium-enriched milk for breakfast. In order to track absorption, several radioactive calcium tracers were given orally or intravenously.
*Radiation levels in stool and blood samples would serve as dependent variables.
*In another study, 17 subjects received iron supplement shots containing radioisotopes of iron.
*Neither the children nor their parents ever gave adequate informed consent for participation in a scientific study.

The Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments, reporting to the United States Department of Energy in 1994, reported on these experiments:
It has been claimed that the highest dose of radiation that any subject was exposed to was 330 millirem, the equivalent of less than one year&#x27;s background radiation in Denver. A 1995 class-action suit resulted in a 1998 District court decision awarding the victims a $1.85 million settlement from MIT and Quaker.

The school also participated in studies of thyroid function in patients with Down Syndrome and their parents.
This study showed that their iodine metabolism was similar to normal controls.

===Reform lawsuit===

This situation changed in the 1970s, when a class action suit, &quot;Ricci v. Okin&quot;, was filed to upgrade conditions at Fernald and several other state institutions for persons with intellectual disability in Massachusetts. U.S. District Court Judge Joseph Louis Tauro, who assumed oversight of the case in 1972, formally disengaged from the case in 1993, declaring that improvements in the care and conditions at the facilities had made them &quot;second to none anywhere in the world&quot;. A result for Fernald residents of the class action suit which took effect in 1993 was the provision of &quot;a guaranteed level of care, regardless of cost, to compensate for decades of neglect and abuse&quot;.

===Twenty-first century===
The buildings and grounds survived into the 2000s as a center for mentally disabled adults, operated by the Massachusetts Department of Mental Retardation. In 2001, 320 adults resided at Fernald, with ages ranging from 27 to 96 years and an average age of 47 years. According to a December 13, 2004 article in the &quot;Boston Globe&quot;, Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney announced in 2003 that the facility would be closed and the land sold by 2007. In 2003, a coalition of family advocates and state employee unions began a campaign to save Fernald and asked Judge Tauro to resume his oversight of the &quot;Ricci v. Okin&quot; class action lawsuit that had led to improvements at Fernald and the other state facilities beginning in the 1970s.

In an August 14, 2007 ruling, Judge Tauro ordered the Department of Mental Retardation to consider the individual wishes of all 185 institution residents before closing the facility. However, in September 2007, the new administration of Governor Deval Patrick appealed Tauro&#x27;s ruling to the First Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Boston. In a statement, the Patrick administration contended that Fernald had become too expensive to continue to operate and that equal or better care could be provided in private, community-based settings for the remaining Fernald residents. The administration&#x27;s cost claims have been disputed by the Fernald League for the Retarded, Inc., the Massachusetts Coalition of Families and Advocates for the Retarded, Inc. (COFAR) and other family-based organizations, which have continued to advocate for the preservation of Fernald as a site for ICF/MR-level care for its current residents. Those advocacy organizations proposed a &quot;postage-stamp&quot; plan under which Fernald would be scaled back in size and the remaining portion of the campus sold for development. The Patrick administration, however, declined to negotiate with those Fernald advocates, and pressed ahead with its appeal and closure plans.

A significant portion of the Waltham campus, encompassing its facilities established through Fernald&#x27;s tenure, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. Fernald was the subject of a 2005 documentary film &quot;Front Wards, Back Wards&quot; directed by W.C. Rogers, which has been shown on some PBS television stations.

, Fernald remained open with 13 residents living on grounds, the oldest of whom was 84 years old and a resident since the age of 19. It was reported to cost approximately per client per year, or about four times the United States national average for a state-supported institution.

The Fernald Center&#x27;s last resident was discharged on Thursday, November 13, 2014, after a protracted legal and political battle which cost the Commonwealth of Massachusetts over $40 million in additional costs over the projected closure date of 2010. Remaining residents were integrated into community services or other state-operated programs. In 2014 the land was purchased by the city of Waltham in two parcels, 139 acres for $2.7 million paid out of Community Preservation Act funds, and 40 acres for $800,000 of city funds. The CPA section may only be used for open space, recreation, or historic preservation. The 40 acre portion has no restrictions for future use. There was a period of discussion about building a new high school for Waltham on a section of the site, but eventually the proposal was discarded due to difficult topography, potential soil contamination, and a denial of approval from the Massachusetts Historical Commission related to the demolition of certain buildings on the site.

==Current status==
In May 2017 and 2018, the Waltham Lions Club held a fundraising carnival on the grounds with rides, games, prizes, a petting zoo and food.

In November/December 2020 and 2021, the site became the home of the Greater Boston Lights Show, a fundraiser for the Waltham Lions Club chapter. The decision to host a holiday lights display at this location angered disability rights advocates.

In December 2021, the Waltham Recreation Department held an online meeting to collect public input for potential recreational development on the Fernald property. While many suggestions were made around walking paths, gardens, and other passive recreation facilities, the majority of the meeting focused on the need to honor and respect the history of Fernald and the treatment of the residents.

In 2022, an &quot;amusement park&quot; was approved by the City Council for the Fernald, complete with an electric train, mini golf, open green space, tennis and pickleball courts, a massive athletic complex, eight parking lots, an amphitheater, and a universal playground for children with disabilities. At a Waltham City Council meeting in December 2023, members approved a $9.5 million loan authorization for the project. As of early 2024 construction on the project has begun with no completion date announced. Many residents have opposed the plan for its lack of transparency and for its perceived offensiveness to the disabled community. 

In January 2024, Oliver Egger, a journalist and great-great-grandson of Walter Fernald, wrote an investigative piece in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; describing how, despite knowledge by the City of Waltham and the state, thousands of confidential patient records were left on the campus after its closure. This was in violation of HIPAA. Soon after the article&#x27;s publication, the state removed the documents from the campus and admitted wrong-doing. The Civil Rights Division of the Department of Health and Human Services has formally launched an investigation. In April 2024, &quot;The Globe&quot; reported that in addition the Massachusetts State Police left decades’ worth of confidential case files at the school for years, removing them in 2017.

<text>Louis Schneider (born Ludwig Wilhelm Schneider: 29 April 1805 – 16 December 1878) was a German actor and author.

==Biography==
Schneider was born in Berlin, the son of George Abraham Schneider (1770–1839). At an early age he was engaged at the Royal Theatre, Berlin, where he soon rose to play leading comedy parts. His reputation as a comedian grew with his success in such roles as Zierl in the &quot;Einfahrt vom Lande&quot;, Peter in the &quot;Kapellmeister von Venedig&quot;, Schikaneder in his own revision of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Der Schauspieldirektor&quot; and Basilio in &quot;Le Nozze di Figaro&quot;, and he became the favourite of Berlin.

In 1845 he was appointed head of the Royal opera in Berlin. The same year he adapted Mozart&#x27;s singspiel &quot;Der Schauspieldirektor&quot;, replacing Gottlieb Stephanie&#x27;s libretto with his own which included the characters of Mozart, Emmanuel Schikaneder, Mozart&#x27;s sister-in-law Aloysia Lange among others. Schneider&#x27;s version was first performed in Berlin on 25 April 1845. Ludwig&#x27;s bold patriotic couplets and impromptus during the revolutionary year 1848 necessitated his retirement, and thereafter he translated and adapted for the stage Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Cosi fan tutte&quot;; published, under the pseudonym “L. W. Both,” &quot;Das Buhnenrepertoire des Auslandes&quot;; and founded, as a result of his experiences as a soldier in the Danish war of 1849, the periodical &quot;Der Soldatenfreund&quot;.

He also wrote &quot;Geschichte der Oper und des Opernhauses in Berlin&quot; (1845–1852). Soon after his retirement he was appointed reader to Frederick William IV of Prussia, and subsequently he received the title of &quot;Geheimen Hofrat&quot;. He continued to enjoy the favour of the court, and, as correspondent of the &quot;Staatsanzeiger&quot;, was attached to the headquarters staff of the Prussian army during the campaign of 1866; and, by special invitation, accompanied the emperor William during the war of 1870. Schneider also wrote a novel, &quot;Das böse Glück&quot;, and several volumes of reminiscences: &quot;König Wilhelm&quot; (1869), &quot;Kaiser Wilhelm, 1867–1871&quot; (1875). He died at Potsdam.

<text>Krishna Nehru Hutheesing (2 November 1907 – 9 November 1967) was an Indian writer, the youngest sister of Jawaharlal Nehru and Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, and part of the Nehru-Gandhi family.

==Biography==

Hutheesing was born Krishna Nehru, in Mirganj, Allahabad to Motilal Nehru, an Indian independence activist and leader of the Indian National Congress, and Swarup Rani. She was married to Gunottam (Raja) Hutheesing, who belonged to an Ahmedabad Jain family that built the Hutheesing Jain Temple. During the later 1950s, he became critic of Nehru and in 1959, supported former Governor General C. Rajagopalachari, to form a conservative market liberal political party known as the Swatantra Party.

Hutheesing and her husband fought for India&#x27;s independence and spent a great deal of time in jail. Raja&#x27;s terms in jail came while they were raising their two young sons, Harsha Hutheesing and Ajit Hutheesing.

In 1950, the Hutheesings toured the United States on a lecture tour. In late May 1958 Krishna spent three days in Israel. Her host was Yigal Alon, who a year earlier founded &#x27;The Israel-India Friendship League&#x27; as a tool to circumvent the then Indian government policy to avoid direct diplomatic relations between the two states.

Hutheesing documented her life as well as the lives of her brother, Jawaharlal and her niece, Indira Gandhi, in a series of books that intertwine history with personal anecdotes including &quot;We Nehrus,&quot; &quot;With No Regrets- An Autobiography,&quot; and &quot;Dear to Behold: An Intimate Portrait of Indira Gandhi&quot;.

Hutheesing&#x27;s husband, Raja, also wrote books: &quot;The Great Peace: An Asian&#x27;s Candid Report on Red China&quot; (1953), &quot;Window on China&quot; (1953), and &quot;Tibet fights for freedom : the story of the March 1959 uprising&quot; (1960).

Hutheesing was associated with the &#x27;Voice of America&#x27; and gave several talks. She died in London in 1967.

<text>Pierre-Jules Hetzel (15 January 1814 – 17 March 1886) was a French editor and publisher celebrated for his extraordinarily lavishly illustrated editions of Jules Verne&#x27;s novels, highly prized by collectors.

==Biography==
Born in Chartres, Eure-et-Loir, Hetzel studied law in Strasbourg, and founded a publishing company in 1837. He was the publisher of Honoré de Balzac, whose &quot;Comédie humaine&quot; began to be appear in 1841, and of Victor Hugo and Émile Zola. In 1843, he founded the &quot;Nouveau magazine des enfants&quot; (&quot;New Children&#x27;s Magazine&quot;). Hetzel was a well-known republican, and in 1848 he became chief of cabinet for Alphonse de Lamartine (then minister of Foreign Affairs), and afterward for the minister of the Navy. He went into self-imposed exile in Belgium after the coup d&#x27;état which ushered in the Second Empire, and there he continued his political and editorial activities by clandestinely publishing Hugo&#x27;s &quot;Les Châtiments&quot;, a harsh pamphlet against the Second Empire.

When the political regime was changed in France, he returned home and published Proudhon and Baudelaire. An important edition of the tales by Charles Perrault, illustrated by Gustave Doré, dates from this period. He founded the &quot;Bibliothèque illustrée des Familles&quot; (&quot;The Family Illustrated Library&quot;), which was renamed to &quot;Le Magasin d&#x27;éducation et de récréation&quot; (&quot;Education and Entertainment Magazine&quot;) in 1864. His goal was to have scientists, authors and illustrators collaborating to create educational works for the whole family.

Hetzel&#x27;s celebrity comes mostly for his editions of the &quot;Voyages extraordinaires&quot; (&quot;Extraordinary Journeys&quot;) by Jules Verne. The stories were originally published in biweekly chapters as a series in his &quot;Magasin&quot;. Once all chapters of a story were printed there, the story would appear in book form. Typically this happened towards the end of the year so the books could be purchased as Christmas presents for older children. Originally, there were three editions: one economical, without illustrations; another one in small format, with a few illustrations; and a third one in a bigger in-octavo format and richly illustrated. It is the last edition that became very popular among book collectors.

Hetzel discovered Jules Verne, but scholars still debate to what extent Hetzel &quot;made&quot; Verne, or if it was Verne who &quot;made&quot; Hetzel&#x27;s publishing career. Each benefited from the other, and their relationship went beyond that of author and publisher.

Hetzel rejected Verne&#x27;s 1863 manuscript for &quot;Paris in the Twentieth Century&quot; because he thought it presented a vision of the future that was far too negative and unbelievable for contemporary audiences, though to many modern scholars the story was remarkably accurate in its predictions. Verne locked the manuscript away and no longer wrote futuristic, dystopian stories. &quot;Paris in the Twentieth Century&quot; was first published in France in 1994.

Hetzel was an atheist. Writing under the pseudonym P.-J. Stahl, he authored many stories for children and young people. He died in Monte Carlo in 1886. After Hetzel&#x27;s death, the publishing business was directed by his son until purchased by Hachette in 1914.

<text>Apostasioideae is one of the five subfamilies recognised within the orchid family, Orchidaceae. Only two genera, &quot;Neuwiedia&quot; and &quot;Apostasia&quot;, and 15 species, are recognised within the Apostasioideae in contrast to the other orchid subfamilies which are highly species rich.

The Apostasioideae are generally considered a basal lineage within the orchids based on molecular data and flower structure. All other orchid subfamilies with the exception of the Cypripedioideae are monandrous (possessing a single stamen), however Apostasioid orchids have 3 stamens.

As with all basal or &#x27;primitive&#x27; groups, extant species within Apostasioideae do not represent direct ancestors of the other subfamilies, they simply share the same common ancestor. However, by having followed a separate evolutionary pathway from the other orchids extant Apostasioid orchids may allow biologists to make inferences about features present in that common ancestor.

<text>Candesartan is an angiotensin receptor blocker used mainly for the treatment of high blood pressure and congestive heart failure. Candesartan has a very low maintenance dose. Like olmesartan, the metabolism of the drug is unusual as it is a cascading prodrug. Candesartan has good bioavailibility and is the most potent by weight of the AT-1 receptor antagonists.
It was patented in 1990 and approved for medical use in 1997.

==Medical uses==

===Hypertension===
As with other angiotensin II receptor antagonists, candesartan is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. Candesartan has an additive antihypertensive effect when combined with a diuretic, such as chlorthalidone. It is available in a fixed-combination formulation with a low dose of the thiazide diuretic hydrochlorothiazide. Candesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination preparations are marketed under various trade names including Atacand Plus, Hytacand, Blopress Plus, Advantec and Ratacand Plus.

===Heart failure===
In heart failure patients, angiotensin receptor blockers such as candesartan and valsartan may be a suitable option for those who do not tolerate angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor medicines. Randomised control trials have shown candesartan reduces heart failure hospitalisations and cardiovascular deaths for patients who have heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF ≤ 40%).

===Prehypertension===
In a four-year randomized controlled trial, candesartan was compared to placebo to see whether it could prevent or postpone the development of full-blown hypertension in people with so-called prehypertension. During the first two years of the trial, half of participants were given candesartan while the other half received placebo; candesartan reduced the risk of developing hypertension by nearly two-thirds during this period. In the last two years of the study, all participants were switched to placebo. By the end of the study, candesartan had significantly reduced the risk of hypertension, by more than 15%. Serious adverse effects were more common among participants receiving placebo than in those given candesartan.

===Prevention of atrial fibrillation===
In 2005, meta-analysis results showed that angiotensin receptor blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors considerably reduce the risk of atrial fibrillation in patients with coexisting heart failure and systolic left ventricular dysfunction. Specifically, an analysis of the CHARM study showed benefits for Candesartan in reducing new occurrences of atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure and reduced left ventricular function. While these studies have demonstrated a potential additional benefit for candesartan when used in patients with systolic left ventricular dysfunction, additional studies are required to further elucidate the role of candesartan in the prevention of atrial fibrillation in other population groups.

===Diabetic retinopathy===
Use of antihypertensive drugs has been demonstrated to slow the progression of diabetic retinopathy; the role of candesartan specifically in reducing progression in type 1 and type 2 diabetes is still up for debate. Results from a 2008 study on patients with type 1 diabetes showed there was no benefit in using candesartan to reduce progression of diabetic retinopathy when compared to placebo. Candesartan has been demonstrated to reverse the severity (cause regression) of mild to moderate diabetic retinopathy in patients with type 2 diabetes. The patient populations investigated in these studies were limited to mostly Caucasians and those younger than 75 years of age, so generalization of these findings to other population groups should be done with caution.

===Migraine prophylaxis===
Candesartan may be helpful in migraine prevention as it has better tolerability and less side effects compared to other first line medications. It has been recommended by multiple guidelines for migraine prophylaxis in adults with different levels of recommendations, however further studies on larger populations are needed.

==Adverse effects==
As with other drugs that inhibit the renin–angiotensin system, if candesartan is taken by pregnant women during the second or third trimester, it can cause injury and in some cases, death of the developing fetus. Symptomatic hypotension may occur in people who take candesartan and are volume-depleted or salt-depleted, as can also occur when diuretics are coadministered. Reduction in renal glomerular filtration rate may occur; people with renal artery stenosis may be at higher risk. Hyperkalemia may occur; people who are also taking spironolactone or eplerenone may be at higher risk.

Anemia may occur, due to inhibition of the renin–angiotensin system.

As with other angiotensin receptor blockers, candesartan can rarely cause severe liver injury.

==Chemistry and pharmacokinetics==
Candesartan is marketed as the cyclohexyl 1-hydroxy ethyl carbonate (cilexetil) ester, known as candesartan cilexetil. Candesartan cilexetil is metabolised completely by esterases in the intestinal wall during absorption to the active candesartan moiety. In the first step of the cascading pro-drug mechanism, the carbonate group is hydrolyzed, releasing carbon dioxide. The metabolite at this step is cyclohexanol which, being relatively non-toxic, is advantageous to the design of the drug. The other aspect of the cascading prodrug is the O-CH-CH3 molecule which becomes converted into acetic acid, which is another product from the cascading side reaction. Similar to the insight from cyclohexanol, the metabolite of acetic acid relatively is non-toxic and thus less of a hazard if produced as the drug takes pharmacologic action.

The use of a prodrug form increases the bioavailability of candesartan. Despite this, absolute bioavailability is relatively poor at 15% (candesartan cilexetil tablets) to 40% (candesartan cilexetil solution). Its IC50 is 15 μg/kg. Candesartan is not administered in its active form because the administration of the pro-drug would require greater doses and has an unfavorable adverse event profile.

==Research==
There is ongoing research into several potential benefits of candesartan beyond established indications. Candesartan is being investigated for its neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties. In an early Alzheimer&#x27;s disease mouse model, candesartan significantly reduced amyloid burden and inflammation and it is being examined as a potential treatment for early Alzheimer&#x27;s. Rat models indicate that candesartan may have neuroprotective benefits that mitigate certain central mechanisms of ageing and senescence. Additionally, candesartan has shown potential therapeutic applications as an anti-anxiety agent. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study, candesartan induced regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, and improved both LV function and exercise tolerance with no side effects in patients with non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The unique anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects of Candesartan are shown to offer superior renoprotection of chronic renal inflammation, and in ultrahigh doses and in a multidrug context, could be investigated as potentially inducing remission of chronic kidney disease.

==History==

The compound known as TCV-116 (candesartan) was studied by Japanese scientists using standard laboratory rats. Animal studies were published showing the effectiveness of the compound in 1992–1993, with a pilot study on humans published in the summer of 1993.

==Names==
The prodrug candesartan cilexetil is marketed by AstraZeneca and Takeda Pharmaceuticals, commonly under the trade names Blopress, Atacand, Amias, and Ratacand. It is available in generic form.

His novels, with their lively plots encompassing heroism, adventure and romantic love in Biblical settings, contributed to the rise of the Zionist movement.

==Biography==
Born into a Jewish family, as a child Mapu studied in a cheder where his father served as a teacher. He married in 1825.

For many years he was an impoverished, itinerant schoolmaster. Mapu gained financial security when he was appointed teacher in a government school for Jewish children. He worked as a teacher in various towns and cities, joined the Haskalah movement, and studied German, French and Russian. He also studied Latin from a translation of the Bible to that language, given to him by his local rabbi.
He returned in 1848 to Kaunas and self-published his first historical novel, &quot;Ahavat Zion.&quot; This is considered one of the first Hebrew novels. He began work on it in 1830 but completed it only in 1853. Unable to fully subsist on his book sales, he relied on the support of his brother, Matisyahu. In 1867 he moved to Königsberg due to illness, published his last book, &quot;Amon Pedagogue&quot; (&quot;Amon&quot; means something like Mentor), and died there.

==Evaluation==
Mapu is considered to be the first Hebrew novelist. Influenced by French Romanticism, he wrote intricately plotted stories about life in ancient Israel, which he contrasted favourably with 19th-century Jewish life. His style is fresh and poetic, almost Biblical in its simple grandeur.

==Legacy==
The romantic-nationalistic ideas in his novels later inspired David Ben-Gurion and others active in the leadership of the modern Zionist movement that led to the establishment of the state of Israel. The American Hebrew poet, Gabriel Preil, references Mapu in one of his works and focuses on the two writers&#x27; native Lithuania.

Schapiro, 1902 and republished in 1922 and 1930 as &quot;The Shepherd Prince&quot;); (&quot;The Sorrows of Noma,&quot; translated by J. Marymont, 1919)
* &quot;Ayit Tzavua&quot; (1858) (&quot;Hypocrite Eagle&quot;)

== Commemorations ==
Streets bearing his name are found in the Kaunas Old Town and in the Israeli cities of Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, and Kiriat Ata. A well-known Israeli novel called &quot;The Children from Mapu Street&quot; (&quot;הילדים מרחוב מאפו&quot;) also celebrates his name. In Kaunas A. Mapu Street a joyful statue of A. Mapu with a book in his hand was established by the sculptor Martynas Gaubas in 2019.

<text>Douglas Alan Yule (born February 25, 1947) is an American musician and singer, most notable for being a member of the Velvet Underground from 1968 to 1973, serving as the bassist, guitarist, keyboardist and vocalist.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Doug Yule was born in Mineola, Long Island, New York, and grew up in Great Neck with five sisters and a younger brother. As a child he took piano and baritone horn lessons. He later said in an interview that he would have preferred violin lessons, but the violin had to be rented and the baritone horn was available free of charge.

In high school he played the tuba, as well as the guitar and the banjo, and sang in the church choir.

In 1965–66 he attended Boston University, where he studied acting. In Boston he met Walter Powers and Willie Alexander of the Grass Menagerie. In 1966–67, he played with the Grass Menagerie and other bands in New York, California, and Boston.

===The Velvet Underground===
====1968–1970====
Yule first met the Velvet Underground at his River Street apartment in Boston, which he rented from their road manager, Hans Onsager, and where the band would sometimes stay when they played in the city. Yule&#x27;s improving guitar technique caught the ear of Sterling Morrison.

When John Cale left the Velvet Underground at the behest of Lou Reed in 1968, Yule joined the band (then consisting of Reed, Morrison and Maureen &quot;Moe&quot; Tucker) as Cale&#x27;s replacement. Yule made his first studio appearance on their third album, &quot;The Velvet Underground&quot; (1969), playing bass and organ. As well as singing lead vocals on the ballad &quot;Candy Says&quot;, which opens the album, he harmonizes with Reed on &quot;Jesus&quot; and co-sings the chorus of the album&#x27;s penultimate track, &quot;The Murder Mystery&quot;, with Maureen Tucker.

His contribution to the LP was considerable, and his vocals would later come in handy on the road. When Reed&#x27;s voice became strained from touring, Yule would sing lead on several songs. While Cale had been a more experimental bass player, Yule was considered more technically proficient on the instrument and his distinct melodic style suited Reed&#x27;s desire to move the band into a more mainstream direction.

Yule&#x27;s role became even more prominent on the band&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Loaded&quot; (1970), singing lead vocals on &quot;Who Loves the Sun&quot;, &quot;New Age&quot;, &quot;Lonesome Cowboy Bill&quot;, and &quot;, and playing six instruments, including keyboard and drums.

Yule&#x27;s brother Billy also joined in on the sessions as a drummer when regular drummer Maureen Tucker was pregnant and therefore absent for most of the recording. His lead vocals can also be heard on the song &quot;Ride Into the Sun&quot;, which was featured on the &quot;Fully Loaded&quot; CD reissue of &quot;Loaded &quot; that was released in 1997.

====1970–73 (&quot;Loaded&quot; tour and final Velvet Underground shows)====
Lou Reed left the Velvet Underground during their summer residency at the New York club Max&#x27;s Kansas City in August 1970. With band manager Steve Sesnick looking to fill pending bookings, and with the upcoming release of &quot;Loaded&quot; in November of that year, Yule, Tucker and Morrison decided to continue performing as the Velvet Underground to promote the album. Yule took over lead vocals and switched his main instrument from bass to guitar, and Walter Powers was recruited as the Velvets&#x27; new bass guitarist. Following the release of &quot;Loaded&quot; in Europe in the spring of 1971, Morrison left the group in August to resume his academic studies in Texas, and was replaced by Willie Alexander on keyboards. Alexander, Powers and Tucker left the Velvets in late 1972 after being forced out by manager Steve Sesnick prior to a handful of European shows to promote &quot;Loaded&quot; in Europe. With no original band members left, and with a group of quickly assembled musicians, Yule played the final shows as the Velvet Underground in 1972. With Ian Paice of Deep Purple and some session musicians, Yule recorded the album &quot;Squeeze&quot; in late 1972. It was released in February 1973, and is in essence a Doug Yule solo album, though presented as a Velvet Underground album due to band manager Steve Sesnick&#x27;s contractual agreement with Polydor, and due to the success of &quot;Live at Max&#x27;s Kansas City&quot;, which had received positive reviews the previous year. After two final shows in early 1973 (billed by the promoter as &quot;The Velvet Underground&quot;, against Yule&#x27;s wishes), the band was officially retired.

====Lou Reed session work (1974–1976)====
In 1974 Reed contacted Yule to contribute a melodic bass track on his solo album &quot;Sally Can&#x27;t Dance&quot; (1974), on the song &quot;Billy&quot;, which closes the album, and Yule joined Reed&#x27;s band for the subsequent US and European tour as his guitar player. Following the tour the band dissolved, but Yule was called back by Reed in 1975 to record several guitar and bass tracks for his upcoming album &quot;Coney Island Baby&quot;, the 30th anniversary re-issue of which includes the bonus tracks that feature Yule on bass and guitar.

====1976–1978 (Elliott Murphy, American Flyer and hiatus from music)====
In early 1976 Yule played guitar on &quot;Night Lights&quot; (1976) by Elliott Murphy, and joined the band American Flyer later that year as their drummer and background singer.

American Flyer was an active country rock band from 1976 to 1978, and the band also featured the guitarist Steve Katz of Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears. After securing a major-label contract with United Artists, and managing to interest George Martin enough to bring him on board as their producer, American Flyer&#x27;s debut album &quot;American Flyer&quot; debuted at #87 on the Billboard Top 200, and they even scored a minor hit with their single &quot;Let Me Down Easy&quot; which debuted at #80 in 1976.

Despite the promise showed on their first album, their follow-up album &quot;Spirit of a Woman&quot; failed to chart as high, and did not carry the momentum the label expected, and the band decided to fold. After American Flyer disbanded, Yule retired from doing music full-time, and became a cabinetmaker and a luthier of violins.

===1990–present===
When the Velvet Underground reformed in early 1993, Sterling Morrison had campaigned for Yule&#x27;s involvement, but Lou Reed and John Cale ultimately overruled him, thus leaving Yule off the band&#x27;s six-week reunion tour of Europe, and the subsequent live album &quot;Live MCMXCIII&quot;. Following the continual interest in the Velvet Underground, and partly due to the publicity of the band&#x27;s released box set &quot;Peel Slowly and See&quot; in 1995, Yule, who had by then moved to the San Francisco Bay Area, returned to public life, again giving interviews to journalists and various fanzines about his time in the Velvet Underground. He also wrote an obituary for Sterling Morrison, who had died in 1995.

Yule was not included along with the original line-up for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame when the Velvet Underground were inducted in 1996. However, Yule remains a member of the Velvet business partnership, and continued to give the occasional interview about his time in the group. After having taken up the violin, Yule began to record music again in 1997.

A song called &quot;Beginning To Get It&quot; appeared on the benefit compilation &quot;A Place to Call Home&quot; in 1998. He played some concerts in 2000, while the live album &quot;Live in Seattle&quot; was released in Japan in 2002. He featured on Tucker&#x27;s live album &quot;Moe Rocks Terrastock&quot;.

On August 31, 2006, Yule performed for the first time in public in New York City in over 30 years with Mark Gardener of Ride at Pianos. On December 8, 2009, he appeared with Reed and Tucker at the New York Public Library, to commemorate the publishing of &quot;The Velvet Underground – New York Art&quot;, a collection of rare photographs of the band&#x27;s first performance in New York City to Andy Warhol&#x27;s cover designs. They conducted a Q&amp;A with a sold-out live audience, and David Fricke acted as moderator to the event.

<text>Pivka (, , ) is a small town in Slovenia in the Pivka Basin in the Karst region. It is the seat of the Municipality of Pivka. It belongs to the traditional region of Inner Carniola.

==Name==
Pivka was first mentioned in 1300 as &quot;villa Sancti Petri super Piucha&quot; (&#x27;St. Peter above the Pivka River&#x27;), and in 1498 as &quot;Sannt Peter&quot;. The name of the settlement was changed from &quot;Šent Peter na Krasu&quot; (literally, &#x27;Saint Peter in the Karst&#x27;) to &quot;Pivka&quot; in 1952. The name was changed on the basis of the 1948 Law on Names of Settlements and Designations of Squares, Streets, and Buildings as part of efforts by Slovenia&#x27;s postwar communist government to remove religious elements from toponyms. Before it replaced the original name of the settlement, the name &quot;Pivka&quot; originally referred to the Pivka River. This name was first attested in 1300 as &quot;Piuca&quot; or &quot;Piucha&quot; (and as &quot;Peucha&quot; in 1335). The name is derived from the Slovene common noun &quot;pivka&quot; &#x27;karst sinkhole&#x27;.

==History==
Although the Pivka region has been a strategically important location since ancient times, it became even more important with the construction of the railway from Vienna to Trieste (the Austrian Southern Railway) in 1857 and the railway from Št. Peter na Krasu to Rijeka twenty years later. In 1930, while it was under the Italian control, the strategic hills over the town were heavily fortified and included in the Alpine Wall system of defenses, which stretched from the Bay of Genoa to the Kvarner Gulf. Št. Peter na Krasu and the nearby barracks in Hrastje (now part of the town of Pivka) were one of the strongest points in the eastern section of the Alpine Wall.

==Churches==
The parish church in the town of Pivka is dedicated to Saint Peter and belongs to the Koper Diocese. A second church in the Radohova Vas neighborhood of the town belongs to the same parish and is dedicated to Saint Lawrence.

==Museum==
The Pivka Military History Park is a museum with heavy weapons, military vehicles, training and fighter aircraft, a helicopter and a Yugoslav &quot;Una&quot;-class commando submarine.

<doc id="1269331" wikidata="Q420644" url="?curid=1269331" title="Felodipine">
<text>Felodipine is a medication of the calcium channel blocker type that is used to treat high blood pressure.
It was patented in 1978, and approved for medical use in 1988.

==Medical uses==
Felodipine is used to treat high blood pressure and stable angina.

It should not be used for people who are pregnant, have acute heart failure, are having a heart attack, have an obstructed heart valve, or have obstructions that block bloodflow out of the heart.

For people with liver failure the dose needs to be lowered, because felodipine is cleared by the liver.

==Adverse effects==
The only very common side effect, occurring in more than 1/10 people, is pain and swelling in the arms and legs.

Common side effects, occurring in between 1% and 10% of people, include flushing, headache, heart palpitations, dizziness and fatigue.

Felodipine can exacerbate gingivitis.

== Interactions ==

Felodipine is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4, so substances that inhibit or activate CYP3A4 can strongly effect how much felodipine is present.

CYP3A4 inhibitors, which increase the amount of felodipine available per dose, include cimetidine, erythromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, HIV protease inhibitors, and grapefruit juice.

CYP3A4 activators, which decrease the amount of felodipine available per dose, include phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampicin, barbiturates, efavirenz, nevirapine, and Saint John&#x27;s wort.

==Mechanism of action==
Felodipine is a calcium channel blocker. Felodipine has additionally been found to act as an antagonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor, or as an antimineralocorticoid.

Different calcium channels are present in vascular tissue and cardiac tissue; an &quot;in vitro&quot; study on human vascular and cardiac tissues comparing how selective various calcium channel blockers are for vascular compared to cardiac tissue found the following vascular/cardiac tissue ratios: mibefradil 41, felodipine 12; nifedipine 7, amlodipine 5, and verapamil 0.2.

==Chemistry==
Felodipine is a member of the 1,4-dihydropyridine class of calcium channel blockers. It is a racemic mixture, and is insoluble in water but is soluble in dichloromethane and ethanol.

==History==
The Swedish company Hässle, a division of Astra AB, discovered felodipine; it filed a patent application in 1979 claiming felodipine as an antihypertensive drug. Astra partnered this drug and others with Merck &amp; Co. in the US under a 1982 agreement between the companies. The drug was approved by the FDA in 1991 after a three-and-a-half-year review; the drug entered a very crowded market to included the other calcium channel blockers nifedipine, verapamil, nicardipine, and isradipine. The FDA gave the drug a 1C rating, meaning that it found little difference between felodipine and the drugs already approved for the same use.

In 1994 Astra AB and Merck changed their partnership to a joint venture called Astra Merck, and in 1998 Astra (by that time, AstraZeneca) bought out Merck&#x27;s rights in the joint venture.

The first generics became available in Sweden in 2003 and in the US in 2004.

In April 2016, AstraZeneca announced that they were selling the right to market felodipine in China to China Medical System Holdings for $310 million; AZ would continue to manufacture the drug.

==Society and culture==
As of 2016, felodipine was marketed under many brand names worldwide: Auronal, Cardioplen, Catrazil, Dewei, Dilahex, Enfelo, Erding, Fedil, Fedisyn, Feldil, Felicipin, Felo, Felocard, Felocor, Feloday, Felodil, Felodin, Felodip, Felodipin, Felodipina, Felodipine, Felodipino, Felodistad, Felogard, Felohexal, Felop, Felopine, Felostad, Feloten, Felotens, Felpin, Flodicar, Flodil, Keliping, Keydipin, Lodistad, Modip, Munobal, Nirmadil, Parmid, Penedil, Perfudal, Phelop, Phenodical, Plendil, Plentopine, Polo, Presid, Preslow, Prevex, Renedil, Sistar, Splendil, Stapin, Topidil, Vascalpha, Versant, and XiaoDing.

The combination of felodipine and candesartan was marketed as Atacand.

The combination of felodipine and ramipril was marketed as Delmuno, Tazko, Triacor, Triapin, Triasyn, Tri-Plen, Unimax, and Unitens.

The combination of felodipine and enalapril was marketed as Lexxel.

The combination of felodipine and metoprolol was marketed as Logimat, Logimax, and Mobloc.

<text>Nayantara Sahgal ( nee&#x27; Pandit) (born 10 May 1927) is an Indian writer who writes in English. She is a member of the Nehru–Gandhi family, the second of the three daughters born to Jawaharlal Nehru&#x27;s sister, Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit.

She was awarded the 1986 Sahitya Akademi Award for her English novel &quot;Rich Like Us&quot; (1985).

==Early life==
Sahgal&#x27;s father Ranjit Sitaram Pandit was a barrister from Kathiawad. Pandit was also a classical scholar who had translated Kalhana&#x27;s epic history &quot;Rajatarangini&quot; into English from Sanskrit. He was arrested for his support of Indian independence and died in Lucknow prison jail in 1944, leaving behind his wife (Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit) and their three daughters Chandralekha Mehta, Nayantara Sehgal and Rita Dar. 

Sahgal&#x27;s mother, Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, was the daughter of Motilal Nehru and sister of India&#x27;s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. Vijaya Lakshmi had been active in the Indian freedom struggle, had been to jail for this cause and in 1946, was part of the first team representing newly formed India that went to the then newly formed United Nations, along with M.C.Chagla. After India achieved independence, Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit served as a member of India&#x27;s Constituent Assembly, the governor of several Indian states, and as India&#x27;s ambassador to the Soviet Union, the United States, Mexico, the Court of St. James, Ireland, and the United Nations. 
Sahgal attended a number of schools as a girl, given the turmoil in the Nehru family during the last years (1935–47) of the Indian freedom struggle. Ultimately, she graduated from Woodstock School in the Himalayan hill station of Mussoorie in 1943 and later in the United States from Wellesley College (BA, 1947), which she attended along with her sister Chandralekha, who graduated 2 years earlier in 1945. She has made her home for decades in Dehradun, a town close to Mussoorie where she had attended boarding school (at Woodstock).

==Marriage and career==

Sahgal has been married twice, first to Gautam Sehgal and later to Edward Nirmal Mangat Rai, a Punjabi Christian who was an Indian Civil Service officer. Though part of the Nehru family, Sahgal developed a reputation for maintaining her independent critical sense. Her independent tone, and her mother&#x27;s, led to both falling out with her cousin Indira Gandhi during the most autocratic phases of the latter&#x27;s time in office in the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s. Gandhi cancelled Sahgal&#x27;s scheduled appointment as India&#x27;s Ambassador to Italy within days of her return to power. Not one to be intimidated, Sahgal in 1982 wrote &quot;Indira Gandhi: Her Road to Power &quot;, a scathing, insightful account of Gandhi&#x27;s rise to power.

Gita Sahgal, the writer and journalist on issues of feminism, fundamentalism, and racism, director of prize-winning documentary films, and human rights activist, is her daughter.

On 6 October 2015, Sahgal returned her Sahitya Akademi Award to protest what she called &quot;increasing intolerance and supporting right to dissent in the country&quot;, following the murders of rationalists Govind Pansare, Narendra Dabholkar and M. M. Kalburgi, and the Dadri mob lynching incident; for this she was praised in 2017 by Karima Bennoune, United Nations monitor for cultural rights. In September 2018 she was elected as a Vice President of PEN International.

<doc id="1269339" wikidata="Q841266" url="?curid=1269339" title="1995–96 FA Premier League">
<text>The 1995–96 FA Premier League (known as the FA [[Carling Brewery|Carling]] Premiership for sponsorship reasons) was the fourth season of the competition, since its formation in 1992. Due to the decision to reduce the number of clubs in the FA Premier League from 22 to 20, only two clubs, Middlesbrough and Bolton Wanderers, were promoted instead of the usual three.

Manchester United won the Premier League and qualified for the UEFA Champions League, while Arsenal, Aston Villa, and Newcastle United qualified for the UEFA Cup. Liverpool also qualified for the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup as runners-up of the FA Cup which was won by Manchester United.

==Summary==
Liverpool and Aston Villa emerged as possible title contenders early in the season, while Middlesbrough&#x27;s early promise saw them occupy fourth place in late October. However, an injury crisis saw their league form slump, leading them up to a 12th-place finish. Most of the campaign was a two-horse race between Manchester United and Newcastle United. The two sides played on 27 December, with Newcastle 10 points ahead in the league. A 2–0 home win for Manchester United cut the gap to seven points, and two days later they beat Queens Park Rangers 2–1 to reduce the gap to just four points. Nevertheless, a 4–1 defeat at Tottenham on New Year&#x27;s Day and a 0–0 draw with Aston Villa allowed Newcastle to establish a 12-point lead in January.

Manchester United and Newcastle met again in early March, by which time the gap had been cut to four points. A second half goal by Eric Cantona gave Manchester United a 1–0 away win and cut the gap to a single point. With one game left of the season, Manchester United led the Premier League by two points, having taken lead of the league halfway through March and stayed on top ever since. In case of the two clubs being tied for first place, the Premier League made preliminary preparations for a championship play-off match at Wembley. For Newcastle to win their first title since 1927, they had to win against Tottenham and hope that their north-eastern rivals Middlesbrough defeated Alex Ferguson’s men. But the Premier League title went to Old Trafford as Manchester United won 3–0 and Newcastle could only manage a 1–1 draw with Tottenham.

Despite the arrival of Dennis Bergkamp, Arsenal never looked like serious title challengers. Their best chance of success coming in the League Cup, where they reached the semi-finals, was lost on away goals to Aston Villa. However, the North London side still qualified for the UEFA Cup by finishing fifth.

Aston Villa won the Coca-Cola sponsored League Cup competition this season, beating Leeds United 3–0 at Wembley.

Title holders, Blackburn, recorded the lowest ever finish by a Premier League title-holder by finishing 7th. This record was matched by Manchester United in 2013–14 and broken by Chelsea in 2015–16 and again by Leicester City in 2016–17. However, Rovers striker Alan Shearer was still the league’s top scorer with 31 goals.

Six days after clinching their third league title in four seasons, Manchester United became the first team to complete a second league championship and FA Cup double when a Cantona goal gave them a 1–0 win over Liverpool in the FA Cup final.

Fourth place Aston Villa lifted the League Cup for a joint record fifth time, securing a UEFA Cup place for the third time in four seasons.

The Premier League relegation places went to Bolton Wanderers, Queens Park Rangers, and Manchester City. Bolton had spent most of their first Premier League season bottom of the table, and an improvement in form was not enough to save the Burnden Park side from an immediate return to Division One. They went down on the season’s penultimate weekend, on the same day that QPR’s 3-0 win over London rivals West Ham came too late to save the top flight place they had held since 1983. Manchester City failed to beat Liverpool on the final day of the season, consigning them to the final relegation place on goal difference behind Southampton and Coventry City.

===English performance in European competition===
Blackburn Rovers, the 1994–95 Premier League champions, finished bottom of their group in the UEFA Champions League. Manchester United were knocked out of the UEFA Cup in the first round, with Liverpool and Leeds United both being knocked out at the second round. Everton were beaten in the second round of the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. The only English team still in European competition after Christmas were Nottingham Forest, who reached the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup.

==Teams==
Twenty teams competed in the league – the top eighteen teams from the previous season and the two teams promoted from the First Division. The promoted teams were Middlesbrough and Bolton Wanderers, returning to the top flight after two and fifteen years respectively. This was also Bolton Wanderers&#x27; first season in the Premier League. They replaced Crystal Palace, Norwich City, Leicester City and Ipswich Town, who were relegated to the First Division after their top flight spells of one, nine, one and three years respectively. This was the first season in which the league was contested by twenty teams as opposed to previous seasons which were contested by twenty-two teams.

== History ==
=== Pre-Roman Times ===

In Pre-Roman Portugal, the area was inhabited by the Cynetes (or Conii), a people (formed by several tribes) of linguistic and ethnic affiliation, possibly Celtic or Iberian, whose territory included the modern area of the Beja District. This former territory of the &quot;Cysteines&quot; ran from the mouth of the Mira River all the way to the Guadiana River. It is possible that they were related to the Tartessos (people whose linguistic and ethnic affiliation is also not yet fully known or determined), but were not the same people.

=== Roman Times ===
 Before the definitive integration of the canons into the Roman Empire, during the period from about 200 BC to 141 BC, they were under strong Roman influence, but enjoyed a high degree of autonomy. In part due to the favorable relationship with the Romans, the colonies had some conflicts with the Lusitanians, who under the leadership of Caucenus, the Lusitanian leader before Viriathus, had conquered their territory for some time, including the capital, Conistorgis (whose location is still not known, but is thought to be in modern-day Faro or Castro Marim) in 153 BC. Partly due to the conflict with the Portuguese (and partly due to the cultural influence of Mediterranean civilizations), unlike many pre-Roman peoples of Portugal, they were allies of the Romans for some time and not their opponents, differing from the attitude of most of the other peoples, such as the Lusitanians who were strong opponents of the Romans.

Nevertheless, a while later, in the context of the Lusitanian Wars, in the year of 141BC, the &quot;Conidia&quot; revolted against the Roman Empire, along with the Turduli of Beturia (also called betures), but were quickly defeated by Quintus Fabius Maximus Servilianus, a Roman proconsul, and was definitively integrated into the Roman Empire.

=== Barbarian Era ===
Despite being conquered by the so-called barbarian peoples (Vandals, Alans, Suebi, and later Visigoths) at the time of Barbarian migrations or invasions, Roman culture and Christianity remained there for a period of time. In the year 552, the current area of Algarve was regained by the Eastern Roman Empire or Byzantine Empire (then governed by Emperor Justinian I), and a government was appointed that lasted until the year 571, when King Liuvigild conquered it for the Visigothic Kingdom.

== Fauna ==
The Cape St. Vincent is situated in a route of migrating birds, allowing for the seasonal observation of the variety of bird life.

The subsoil of the district is inhabited by several endemic species unique to Faro, some still just being discovered. The most emblematic species of the underground fauna of the Algarve are the giant pseudo-scorpion of the Algarve caves (&quot;Titanobochica magna&quot;) and the largest terrestrial cave insect in Europe, &quot;Squamatinia algharbica&quot;.

<text>Scholia (: scholium or scholion, from , &quot;comment&quot;, &quot;interpretation&quot;) are grammatical, critical, or explanatory comments – original or copied from prior commentaries – which are inserted in the margin of the manuscript of ancient authors, as glosses. One who writes scholia is a scholiast. The earliest attested use of the word dates to the 1st century BC.

== History ==
Ancient scholia are important sources of information about many aspects of the ancient world, especially ancient literary history. The earliest scholia, usually anonymous, date to the 5th or 4th century BC (such as the &quot;scholia minora&quot; to the &quot;Iliad&quot;). The practice of compiling scholia continued to late Byzantine times, outstanding examples being Archbishop Eustathius&#x27; massive commentaries to Homer in the 12th century and the &quot;scholia recentiora&quot; of Thomas Magister, Demetrius Triclinius and Manuel Moschopoulos in the 14th.

Scholia were altered by successive copyists and owners of the manuscript, and in some cases, increased to such an extent that there was no longer room for them in the margin, and it became necessary to make them into a separate work. At first, they were taken from one commentary only, and subsequently from several. This is indicated by the repetition of the lemma (&quot;headword&quot;), or by the use of such phrases as &quot;or thus&quot;, &quot;alternatively&quot;, &quot;according to some&quot;, to introduce different explanations, or by the explicit quotation of different sources.

== Important sets of scholia ==
===Greek===
The most important are those on the Homeric &quot;Iliad&quot;, especially those found in the 10th-century manuscripts discovered by Villoison in 1781 in the Biblioteca Marciana in Venice (see further Venetus A, Homeric scholarship), which are based on Aristarchus and his school. The scholia on Hesiod, Pindar, Sophocles, Aristophanes and Apollonius Rhodius are also extremely important.

===Latin===
In Latin, the most important are those of Servius on Virgil; of Acro and Porphyrio on Horace; and of Donatus on Terence.
Also of interest are the scholia on Juvenal attached to the good manuscript P; while there are also scholia on Statius, especially associated with the name Lactantius Placidus.

==List of ancient commentaries==
Some ancient scholia are of sufficient quality and importance to be labelled &quot;commentaries&quot; instead. The existence of a commercial translation is often used to distinguish between &quot;scholia&quot; and &quot;commentaries&quot;. The following is a chronological list of ancient commentaries written defined as those for which commercial translations have been made:

*Asconius () on Cicero&#x27;s &quot;Pro Scauro&quot;, &quot;In Pisonem&quot;, &quot;Pro Milone&quot;, &quot;Pro Cornelio&quot; and &quot;In Toga Candida&quot;
*Servius ( AD) on Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;
*Macrobius ( AD) on Cicero&#x27;s &quot;Dream of Scipio&quot;
*Proclus ( AD) on Plato&#x27;s &quot;Parmenides&quot; and &quot;Timaeus&quot; and Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;
*Boethius ( AD) on Cicero&#x27;s &quot;Topics&quot;

== Other uses ==
* Benedict Spinoza provided his own scholia to many of the propositions in his &quot;Ethics&quot;, commentaries upon and expansions of the individual propositions, or sometimes short conclusions to sections of argumentation running over a number of propositions.
* In modern mathematics texts, scholia are marginal notes which may amplify a line of reasoning or compare it with proofs given earlier. A famous example is Bayes&#x27; scholium, in which he presents a justification for assuming a continuous uniform distribution for the prior of the parameter of a Bernoulli process. Another famous example of a somewhat different use is to be found in Brook Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Methodus Incrementorum&quot;, in which the propositions demonstrated are often followed by a scholium which further explains the significance of the proposition.
* &quot;Scholia&quot; is an academic journal in the field of classical studies.
* Scholia is a search engine relying on Wikidata, mainly for scientific publications.
* Nicolás Gómez Dávila was one of the most radical critics of modernity whose work consists almost entirely of aphorisms which he called &quot;escolios&quot; (&quot;glosses&quot;) of an implicit text.
* In each of Bill Blackbeard&#x27;s &quot;Krazy Kat&quot; Sunday strip collections, the back of the book includes an Ignatz Mouse Debaffler Page: a page of notes that clarify references that have faded into obscurity or may otherwise require explanation. When a strip has a scholium about it, the lower outer corner of the page is marked with the likeness of Ignatz.

<doc id="1269350" wikidata="Q863389" url="?curid=1269350" title="Budesonide/formoterol">
<text>Budesonide/formoterol, sold under the brand name Symbicort among others, is a fixed-dose combination medication used in the management of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It contains budesonide, a steroid; and formoterol, a long-acting β2-agonist (LABA). The product monograph does not support its use for sudden worsening or treatment of active bronchospasm. However, a 2020 review of the literature does support such use. It is used by breathing in the medication.
Common (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10) side effects include candidiasis, headache, tremor, palpitations, throat irritation, coughing, and dysphonia. Pneumonia is a common side effect in people with COPD, and other, less common side effects have been documented. There were concerns that the LABA component increases the risk of death in children with asthma, however these concerns were removed in 2017. Therefore, this combination is only recommended in those who are not controlled on an inhaled steroid alone. There is tentative evidence that typical doses of inhaled steroids and LABAs are safe in pregnancy. Both formoterol and budesonide are excreted in breast-milk.
Budesonide/formoterol was approved for medical use in the United States in 2006. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 83rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 8million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==
Budesonide/formoterol is indicated for the treatment of asthma and for the maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction and reducing exacerbations in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

===Maintenance===
Budesonide/formoterol has shown efficacy to prevent asthma attacks. It is unclear if the efficacy of budesonide/formoterol differs from that of fluticasone and salmeterol in chronic asthma.

===Exacerbation===
The combination is approved in the United States only as a maintenance medication in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, a 2020 review of the literature does support use as needed during acute worsening in those with mild disease, and as maintenance followed by extra doses during worsening.

Use for both maintenance and as-needed treatment is also known as single maintenance and reliever therapy (SMART) and is a well-established treatment. It has been shown to, 1) reduce asthma exacerbations that require oral corticosteroids, 2) reduce hospital visits better than maintenance on inhaled corticosteroids alone at a higher dose, or 3) inhaled corticosteroid at the same or higher dose together with a long-acting bronchodilator (LABA), with a short-acting bronchodilator (SABA) as a reliever.

==Side effects==

===Common (up to 1 in 10 people)===
*Mild throat irritation
*Coughing
*Hoarseness
*Oral candidiasis (thrush. significantly less likely if the patient rinses their mouth out with water after inhalations)
*Headache

Often mild, and usually disappear as the medication continues to be used:

* Heart palpitations
* Trembling

===Uncommon (up to 1 in 100 people)===

*Feeling restlessness, nervous, or agitated
*Disturbed sleep
*Feeling dizzy
*Nausea
*Tachycardia (fast heart rate)
*Bruising of the skin
*Muscle cramps

===Rare (up to 1 in 1,000 people)===

*Rash
*Itchiness
*Bronchospasm (tightening of the muscles in the airways causing wheezing immediately after use of the medication, which is possibly sign of an allergic reaction and should be met with immediate medical attention)
*Hypokalemia (low levels of potassium in the blood)
*Heart arrhythmia

===Very rare (up to 1 in 10,000 people)===

*Depression
*Changes in behaviour, especially in children
*Chest pain or tightness in chest
*Increase in blood glucose levels
*Taste changes, such as an unpleasant taste in the mouth
*Changes in blood pressure

===Other===
With high doses for a long period of time.

* Reduced bone mineral density, causing osteoporosis
* Cataracts
* Glaucoma
* Slowed rate of growth in children and adolescents
* Dysfunction of the adrenal gland, which affects the production of various hormones
=== Allergic reaction ===

* Angioedema (swelling of the face, mouth, tongue, and/or throat. Difficulty swallowing. Hives. Difficulty breathing. Feeling of faintness)
* Bronchospasm (sudden acute wheezing or shortness of breath immediately after use of medication. The patient should use their reliever medication immediately.)

==Society and culture==

===Legal status===
Budesonide/formoterol was approved for use in the United States in July 2006.

Budesonide/formoterol was approved for use in the European Union in April 2014.

There are several patents related to the drug; some of which have expired. It was initially marketed by AstraZeneca.

== Brand names ==

<text>Philosophy in the Boudoir (), often mistranslated as Philosophy in the Bedroom, is a 1795 book by the Marquis de Sade written in the form of a dramatic dialogue. Set in a boudoir the two lead characters make the argument that the only moral system that reinforces the recent political revolution is libertinism, and that if the people of France fail to adopt the libertine philosophy, France will be destined to return to a monarchic state.

In the chapter titled &quot;Fifth Dialogue&quot;, there is a lengthy section where the character Chevalier reads a philosophical pamphlet titled &quot;Frenchmen, Some More Effort If You Wish to Become Republicans&quot;. This represents Sade&#x27;s philosophy on religion and morality, a philosophy Sade hopes the citizens of France will embrace and codify into the laws of their new republican government. Throughout the text, Sade makes the argument that one must embrace atheism, reject society&#x27;s beliefs about pleasure and pain, and contends that if any crime is committed while seeking pleasure, it cannot be condemned.

==Characters==
*Eugénie, a 15-year-old girl who at the beginning of the dialogue is a virgin, naïve of all things sexual, who has been brought up by her mother to be well-mannered, modest, decent and obedient.
*Madame de Saint-Ange, a 26-year-old libertine woman who is the owner of the house and bedroom in which the dialogue is set. She invites Eugénie for a two-day course on being libertine.
*Le Chevalier de Mirval, Madame de Saint-Ange&#x27;s 20-year-old brother. He aids his sister and Dolmancé in the ordeal of &quot;educating&quot; Eugénie.
*Dolmancé, a 36-year-old atheist and bisexual (though with a strong preference for men), and friend of Le Chevalier&#x27;s. He is Eugénie&#x27;s foremost teacher and &quot;educator&quot;.
*Madame de Mistival, Eugénie&#x27;s provincial, self-righteous mother.
*Augustin, Madame de Saint-Ange&#x27;s eighteen- or twenty-year-old gardener. Summoned to assist in the sexual activities in the fifth dialogue.

==Plot==
In the introduction, the Marquis de Sade exhorts his readers to indulge in the various activities in the play. He says that the work is dedicated to &quot;voluptuaries of all ages, of every sex&quot; and urges readers to emulate the characters. &quot;Lewd women&quot;, he writes, &quot;let the voluptuous Saint-Ange be your model; after her example, be heedless of all that contradicts pleasure&#x27;s divine laws, by which all her life she was enchained.&quot; He then urges &quot;young maidens&quot; to copy Eugénie; &quot;be as quick as she to destroy, to spurn all those ridiculous precepts inculcated in you by imbecile parents&quot;. Finally, he urges male readers to &quot;study the cynical Dolmancé&quot; and follow his example of selfishness and consideration for nothing but his own enjoyment.

Dolmancé is the most dominant of the characters in the dialogue. He explains to Eugénie that morality, compassion, religion, and modesty are all absurd notions that stand in the way of the sole aim of human existence: pleasure. Like most of Sade&#x27;s work, &quot;Philosophy in the Bedroom&quot; features a great deal of sex as well as libertine philosophies. Despite the text featuring torture, the dialogue contains no actual murder, unlike many of Sade&#x27;s works.

Dolmancé and Madame de Saint-Ange start off by giving Eugénie their own brand of sex education, explaining the biological facts and declaring that physical pleasure is a far more important motive for sex than that of reproduction. Both characters explain that she will not be able to feel &quot;true pleasure&quot; without pain. They then eagerly begin practical lessons, with Le Chevalier joining them in the fourth act and swiftly helping to take away Eugénie&#x27;s virginity.

Eugénie is instructed on the pleasures of various sexual practices and she proves to be a fast learner. As is usually the case in Sade&#x27;s work, the characters are all bisexual, and sodomy is the preferred activity of all concerned, especially Dolmancé, who prefers male sexual partners and will not have anything other than anal intercourse with females. Madame de Saint-Ange and her younger brother, the &quot;Chevalier&quot;, also have sex with one another, and boast of doing so on a regular basis. Their incest — and all manner of other sexual activity and taboos, such as sodomy, adultery, and homosexuality — is justified by Dolmancé in a series of energetic arguments that can ultimately be summarised by &quot;if it feels good, do it&quot;. The Marquis de Sade&#x27;s ultimate argument throughout the text is that if a crime (even murder) took place during one&#x27;s desire for pleasure, it could not be punished by law. Sodomy was illegal and punishable by death in France until 1791 (though the last execution occurred in 1750) — four years before the dialogue was written, and Sade was convicted of sodomy in 1772.

The corruption of Eugénie is actually at the request of her father, who has sent her to Madame de Saint-Ange for the very purpose of having his daughter stripped of the morality that her virtuous mother taught her.

The dialogue is split into seven parts, or &quot;dialogues&quot;, and was originally illustrated by Sade. There is a lengthy section within the fifth dialogue titled &quot;Yet Another Effort, Frenchmen, If You Would Become Republicans&quot;, in which the Marquis de Sade argued that having done away with the monarchy in the French Revolution, the people of France should take the final step towards liberty by abolishing religion too. &quot;Frenchmen, I repeat it to you: Europe awaits her deliverance from &quot;specter&quot; and &quot;censer&quot; alike. Know well that you cannot possibly liberate her from royal tyranny without at the same time breaking for her the fetters of religious superstition; the shackles of the one are too intimately linked to those of the other; let one of the two survive, and you cannot avoid falling subject to the other you have left intact. It is no longer before the knees of either an imaginary being or a vile impostor a republican must prostrate himself; his only gods must now be &quot;courage&quot; and &quot;liberty&quot;. Rome disappeared immediately Christianity was preached there, and France is doomed if she continues to revere it&quot;.

In the final act, Eugénie&#x27;s mother, Madame de Mistival, arrives to rescue her daughter from the &quot;monsters&quot; who have corrupted her. Eugénie&#x27;s father, however, warns his daughter and friends in advance and urges them to punish his wife, whose person and virtue he clearly loathes. Madame de Mistival is horrified to find that not only her husband arranged for their daughter&#x27;s corruption but also Eugénie has already lost any moral standards that she previously possessed, along with any respect or obedience towards her mother. Eugénie refuses to leave, and Madame de Mistival is soon stripped, beaten, whipped, and raped, her daughter taking an active part in this brutality and even declaring her wish to kill her mother. Dolmancé eventually calls in for a servant who has syphilis to rape Eugénie&#x27;s mother. Eugénie sews up her vagina and Dolmancé her anus to keep the polluted seed inside, and she is then sent home in tears since she knows that her daughter has been lost to the corrupt libertine mentality of Dolmancé and his accomplices.

==Legacy==
Spanish director Jesús Franco has made two films based on &quot;Philosophy in the Bedroom&quot;: &quot;Eugenie… The Story of Her Journey into Perversion&quot; (1970) and &quot;Eugenie (Historia de una perversión)&quot; (1980). Italian director Aurelio Grimaldi also filmed it, as &quot;L&#x27;educazione sentimentale di Eugenie&quot; (2005). In 2003, a play based on &quot;Philosophy in the Bedroom&quot; titled &quot;XXX&quot; was staged in a number of European cities. It featured live simulated sex and audience interaction that caused some controversy.

<text>Pomponius Porphyrion (or Porphyrio) was a Latin grammarian and commentator on Horace.

==Biography==
He was possibly a native of Africa, and flourished during the 3rd century A.D.

==Works==
His &quot;scholia&quot; on Horace, which are still extant, mainly consist of rhetorical and grammatical explanations. We probably do not possess the original work, which must have suffered from alterations and interpolations at the hands of the copyists of the Middle Ages, but on the whole the &quot;scholia&quot; form a valuable aid to the student of Horace.

<text>Wily is a text editor created by Gary Capell for the X Window System. It is based on Acme, the mouse-centric editing environment for the Plan 9 operating system. 

Wily is one of the few editors that supports mouse chording. Unlike Acme, it does not support mouse scrolls and its interface is black and white. Development and usage of Wily has been deprecated in favour of the port of Acme to Unix systems as part of Plan 9 from User Space.

<doc id="1269368" wikidata="Q637247" url="?curid=1269368" title="Formoterol">
<text>Formoterol, also known as eformoterol, is a long-acting β2 agonist (LABA) used as a bronchodilator in the management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Formoterol has an extended duration of action (up to 12 h) compared to short-acting β2 agonists such as salbutamol (albuterol), which are effective for 4 h to 6 h. Formoterol has a relatively rapid onset of action compared to other LABAs, and is effective within 2-3 minutes. The 2022 Global Initiative for Asthma report recommends a combination formoterol/inhaled corticosteroid inhaler as both a preventer and reliever treatment for asthma in adults. In children, a short-acting β2 adrenergic agonist (e.g., salbutamol) is still recommended.
It was patented in 1972 and came into medical use in 1998. It is available as a generic medication. It is also marketed in the combination formulations budesonide/formoterol and mometasone/formoterol.

==Side effects==
In November 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a health advisory alerting the public to findings that show the use of long-acting β2 agonists could lead to a worsening of wheezing symptoms in some patients.

Nowadays, available long-acting β2 agonists include salmeterol, formoterol, bambuterol, and sustained-release oral salbutamol.

Combinations of inhaled steroids and long-acting bronchodilators are becoming more widespread – combination preparations include fluticasone/salmeterol and budesonide/formoterol.

==Mechanism of action==
Inhaled formoterol works like other β2 agonists, causing bronchodilation by relaxing the smooth muscle in the airway so as to treat the exacerbation of asthma.

== Society and culture ==

=== Brand names ===
Formoterol is marketed in three forms: a dry-powder inhaler (DPI), a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) and an inhalation solution, under various brand names including Atock, Atimos/Atimos Modulite, Foradil/Foradile, Fostair, Oxeze/Oxis, Perforomist and Symbicort.

* Foradil/Foradile capsules for oral inhalation (Schering-Plough in the U.S., Novartis rest of world)
* Oxeze/Oxis Turbuhaler dry-powder inhaler (DPI) (AstraZeneca)
* Atock (Astellas)
* Atimos/Atimos Modulite metered-dose inhaler (MDI) (Chiesi)
* Perforomist inhalation solution (Mylan N.V.)
* Symbicort Turbuhaler dry-powder inhaler (DPI) (AstraZeneca)

In some countries, Perforomist is marketed by Viatris after Upjohn merged with Mylan to create Viatris.

==Uses and combinations==
* Arformoterol ((&quot;R&quot;,&quot;R&quot;)-(−)-formoterol) — an enantiopure compound used in the management of COPD
* Combination drugs:
** Aclidinium bromide/formoterol
** Budesonide/formoterol
** Mometasone furoate/formoterol

<text>In variance analysis (accounting) direct material price variance is the difference between the standard cost and the actual cost for the actual quantity of material purchased. It is one of the two components (the other is direct material usage variance) of direct material total variance.

==Example==
Let us assume that the standard direct material cost of widget is as follows:
:2 kg of unobtainium at € 60 per kg ( = € 120 per unit). 
Let us assume further that during the given period, 100 widgets were manufactured, using 212 kg of unobtainium which cost € 13,144.

Under those assumptions direct material price variance can be calculated as:

Direct material price variance is because Todd pays too much for steel can be reconciled to direct material total variance by way of direct material usage variance:

spending variance seen as per product cost
(212*62)-(200*60)
See direct material total variance#Example and direct material usage variance#Example for computations of both components.

<doc id="1269403" wikidata="Q533191" url="?curid=1269403" title="1996–97 FA Premier League">
<text>The 1996–97 FA Premier League (known as the FA [[Carling]] Premiership for sponsorship reasons) was the fifth season of the FA Premier League since its formation in 1992. The majority of the season was contested by the reigning champions, Manchester United, along with Newcastle United, Arsenal and Liverpool. The title was eventually won by Manchester United, after Liverpool&#x27;s and Newcastle&#x27;s failure to win in their penultimate games of the season; at 75 points it is the lowest points total for a Premier League champion club and lowest since the 3-1-0 points system was introduced in the 1981–82 season.

Middlesbrough, who had high-profile foreign players like Juninho, Emerson, Fabrizio Ravanelli (who scored 31 goals in all competitions), Branco and Gianluca Festa, were relegated on the final day of the season and were on the losing side in both the FA Cup final and the League Cup final. Middlesbrough finished in 19th place, but would have been placed 14th without a three-point deduction imposed for unilaterally postponing a 21 December 1996 fixture at Blackburn Rovers, with the Middlesbrough board making the decision due to the absence of 23 players ill or injured. The club consulted the Premier League prior to calling off the fixture and was told to do &#x27;what they thought best&#x27;. To protect the integrity of the game, and avoid fielding a team of untried teenagers including three goalkeepers, Middlesbrough called off the match. The Premier League subsequently absolved itself of all responsibility and deducted the three points. This sanction meant Coventry City, who had been in the top division since 1967, finished in 17th place and avoided relegation. The decision was controversial, and later resurfaced in 2006–07 when West Ham escaped a points deduction and subsequently avoided relegation.

Another relegation place went to Nottingham Forest, who sacked manager Frank Clark in December. Stuart Pearce took over as temporary player-manager, spending three months in charge and winning the January 1997 Manager of the Month award. In March, Pearce quit as manager to be replaced by Dave Bassett, formerly of Crystal Palace. Also relegated, due to a 1–0 defeat to Wimbledon in their last game of the season, was Sunderland, who were leaving Roker Park after 99 years and relocating to the 42,000-seat Stadium of Light on the banks of the River Wear for the start of the 1997–98 season in Division One.

==Teams==
Twenty teams competed in the league – the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the First Division. The promoted teams were Sunderland, Derby County (both teams returning to the top flight after a five-year absence) and Leicester City (immediately returning to the top flight after a season&#x27;s absence). This was also both Sunderland and Derby County&#x27;s first season in the Premier League. They replaced Manchester City, Queens Park Rangers and Bolton Wanderers, who were relegated to the First Division after a top flight presence of seven, thirteen and one year respectively.

<doc id="1269407" wikidata="Q57984" url="?curid=1269407" title="Paul Blobel">
<text>Paul Blobel (13 August 1894 – 7 June 1951) was a German &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; (SD) commander and convicted war criminal who played a leading role in the Holocaust. He organised the Babi Yar massacre, the largest massacre of the Second World War at Babi Yar ravine in September 1941, pioneered the use of the gas van, and, following re-assignment, developed the gas chambers for the extermination camps. From late 1942 onwards, he led Sonderaktion 1005, wherein millions of bodies were exhumed at sites across Eastern Europe in an effort to erase all evidence of the Holocaust and specifically of Operation Reinhard. After the war, Blobel was tried at the Einsatzgruppen trial and sentenced to death. He was executed in 1951.

==Early life==
Born in the city of Potsdam, Blobel fought in the First World War as an engineer as part of a pioneer battalion, in which by all accounts he served well, being decorated with the Iron Cross first class. After the war, Blobel studied architecture and practiced this profession from 1924 until 1931, when he joined the Nazi Party, the SA, and the SS (he had joined all of these by 1 December 1931).

==SS career==

In 1933 Blobel joined the police force in Düsseldorf. In June 1934 he was recruited into the SD Security Service. During World War II, following Operation Barbarossa, in June 1941 Blobel became the commanding officer of &quot;Sonderkommando 4a&quot; of &quot;Einsatzgruppe C&quot;, active in Reichskommissariat Ukraine. Both &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; and the Order Police battalions were responsible for massacres of Jews behind the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; lines in the Soviet Union. The murder campaign included all political and racial undesirables. In August 1941 Blobel was put in charge of creating a Nazi ghetto in Zhytomyr to enclose around 3,000 Jews who were murdered a month later. 

On 10 or 11 August 1941, Friedrich Jeckeln ordered him, on behalf of Adolf Hitler, to exterminate the entire Jewish population. On 22 August 1941, the &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; murdered Jewish women and children at Bila Tserkva with the consent of Field Marshal Walther von Reichenau, commander of the 6th Army. SS-&quot;Obersturmführer&quot; August Häfner testified at his own trial in the 1960s:

Blobel, in conjunction with Reichenau&#x27;s and Friedrich Jeckeln&#x27;s units, organised the Babi Yar massacre in late September 1941 in Kyiv, where 33,771 Jews were murdered. In November 1941, Blobel received and activated the first gas vans at Poltava.

Blobel was officially relieved of his command on 13 January 1942 for health reasons due to alcoholism, although this was an elaborate cover. Whilst in the hospital, Blobel was visited by Reinhard Heydrich and tasked with a top secret Reich matter that was presumably suspended upon the fatal shooting of Heydrich in Prague by British-trained Czech partisans. During this time, according to Dieter Wisliceny, Blobel developed the concept of the gas chambers for the extermination camps in Poland. In June 1942 Blobel was contacted by Heinrich Müller, Chief of the Gestapo and secretly placed in charge of &quot;Sonderaktion 1005&quot; with his official cover being SD Chief of the City of Nuremberg. This secret task consisted of the destruction of the evidence of all Nazi atrocities in Eastern Europe, beginning at Chelmno and continuing on to Sobibor Extermination Camp, Auschwitz, the camps in the Independent State of Croatia, the Baltic States, Serbia and eventually back to the site of the Babi Yar Massacre in Ukraine. This entailed exhumation of mass graves, then incinerating the bodies. Blobel developed efficient disposal techniques such as alternating layers of bodies with firewood on a frame of iron rails.

In October 1944 he headed an anti-partisan group in Yugoslavia. Gitta Sereny related the conversation about Blobel she once had with one-time Chief of the Church Information Branch at the Reich Security Head Office, Albert Hartl.

==Trial and conviction==
Over 59,018 killings are attributable to Blobel, however he personally claimed to have killed 10,000–15,000 people. He was later sentenced to death by the U.S. Nuremberg Military Tribunal in the Einsatzgruppen trial. He was hanged at Landsberg Prison shortly after midnight on 7 June 1951.
==In the media==
* Blobel was portrayed by actor T. P. McKenna in the 1978 miniseries &quot;Holocaust&quot;.
* Blobel is an historical character in Herman Wouk&#x27;s book &quot;War and Remembrance&quot;. He was portrayed by actor Kenneth Colley in the television adaptation of the book.

<text>Nicholas Richard Fry (born 29 June 1956 in the United Kingdom) is the former Chief Executive Officer of the Mercedes AMG Petronas Formula One Team, having previously served in similar roles at previous incarnations of the company.

== Career ==
His career in motoring started with the Ford Motor Company in 1977, as a graduate trainee from the University of Wales with a degree in Economics. Working first in Sales and then Market Research, in 1978, he was moved to Product Development as Product Planner. He helped develop a variety of models over the next 12 years, including several performance models like the Ford Escort Cosworth, the RS200 and others. He also spent a spell at Aston Martin in the early 1990s whilst the company was under Ford ownership, overseeing the development and launch of the critically acclaimed DB7 model and switch from manufacturer of handbuilt-only vehicles at the traditional Newport Pagnell site to a higher-volume producer at a new factory operation at Bloxham.

Following this spell at Aston Martin, he returned to Ford in 1995, taking over as director of Service Engineering within the Customer Service Division, his time there being most noticeable for an early television appearance in a combative appearance opposite Anne Robinson on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Watchdog&quot; programme, robustly defending Ford&#x27;s handling of a safety recall campaign for brake servo assist pumps in its diesel car range.

Fry joined Prodrive as managing director in January 2001, upon the persuasion of David Richards, where he has been responsible for leading Prodrive&#x27;s expansion into outsourced engineering services. Within four months of his appointment, Prodrive Automotive Technology had a full order book for 2001 and major steps had been taken to grow the company in the UK and beyond with the acquisition of the Tickford Group. This expansion saw Fry become group managing director overseeing both the company&#x27;s engineering and racing operations.

The 2001 World Rally Championship started poorly for Subaru and their lead driver Richard Burns and at the request of Subaru management, Fry became involved with the team and sought the advice of Burns on reorganisation. The team’s fortunes improved and Richard Burns won the World Rally Drivers Championship that year. A similar car was entered by Fry for Subaru in the North American SCCA ProRally Championship and Mark Lovell became drivers Champion. Lovell subsequently won the 2003 Pike’s Peak Hillclimb in a Prodrive prepared Subaru.

Under Fry’s leadership a Prodrive designed and prepared Ferrari 550 won the GTS class at Le Mans in 2003.

Early in 2002, he was appointed Managing Director of BAR F1 in addition to his Prodrive responsibilities. After significant reorganisation of the team, BAR became runner-up to Ferrari in the 2004 FIA F1 World Constructors Championship and Fry achieved his first F1 victory as Chief Executive and BAR’s only race win when Jenson Button took the chequered flag at the 2006 Hungarian Grand Prix.

Under Honda ownership between 2005 and 2008, Fry spearheaded significant investment in the Honda F1 Team HQ in Brackley, Northamptonshire, including the building of a state-of-the-art wind tunnel, new manufacturing facilities and installation of new Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) capability which paved the way for success in 2009 and beyond.

These investments helped Fry attract Ross Brawn, one of the most successful F1 Technical Directors in F1 history, to the team late in 2007 and during 2008 the pair set about designing a car and team structure which would take full advantage of F1 rule changes planned for 2009. However, in late 2008 as a result of the global financial crisis Honda decided to withdraw from F1 at short notice. Fry and Brawn managed to persuade Honda to continue to support the team over the winter of 2008/9 whilst they sought to attract a new investor and to allow continuation of preparations for the 2009 season.

A global search for suitable investors failed and Fry as CEO and Brawn as Team Principal took ownership of the team and all its liabilities and re-named the team Brawn GP. Mercedes agreed to sell the team engines for the season and after a rapid re-design of the car to suit a Mercedes instead of Honda engine the team managed to get cars and drivers Jenson Button and Rubens Barrichello to the final F1 test before the 2009 season opener in Melbourne.

The car proved significantly faster than all others partly as a result of a controversial ‘double diffuser’ aerodynamic feature which gave the cars more downforce. The design was unsuccessfully challenged by several other teams who were subsequently forced to incorporate the feature into their own cars. The 2009 Brawn scored a 1-2 finish in the Melbourne Grand Prix and won 8 races during the season, 4 as 1-2 finishes. Jenson Button became World Drivers Champion and the Team won the Constructor title on its first attempt. The story of 2009 is told in a book ‘Survive Drive Win’ co-authored by Fry and ex-Times journalist Ed Gorman.

In 2010 Mercedes Benz became majority owners of the Brawn team and Fry left the team in 2013. In 2018 Fry joined professional esports organisation Fnatic as head of commercial strategy and Chairman and in September 2021 Nick Fry joined McLaren Applied at the request of owners Greybull Capital as Chairman. In 2022 McLaren Applied were awarded the contract by the FIA to develop a new engine control system for the 2026 F1 season. In 2023 Fry was successful with McLaren Applied and Greybull in taking ownership of Dutch e-bike manufacturer VanMoof and Italian solar inverter experts Fimer.

The story of Brawn GP and Fry’s role features in a four-part documentary ‘Brawn: The Impossible Formula 1 Story’, hosted by Keanu Reeves, which was released on Disney+ in November 2023.

<doc id="1269428" wikidata="Q2522772" url="?curid=1269428" title="Victoria Island, Lagos">
<text>Victoria Island (VI) is an affluent area that encompasses a former island of the same name neighbouring Lagos Island, Ikoyi and the Lekki Peninsula by the Lagos Lagoon. It is the main business and financial centre of Lagos State, Nigeria. Victoria Island is one of the most exclusive and expensive areas to reside in Lagos. The town and island lie within the boundaries of the Eti-Osa Local Government Area (LGA).

==History==

A large part of the Island was originally part of jurisdiction of the Oniru chieftaincy family of Lagos with tenants inhabiting the land. In 1948, the Lagos Executive Development Board paid 250,000 pounds as compensation for the land acquired from the Oniru family and an additional 150,000 pounds as compensation for the inhabitants and shrines destroyed. The inhabitants were later resettled at Maroko village. Victoria Island was originally surrounded entirely by water. It was bordered by the Atlantic Ocean on the south, the mouth of the Lagos Lagoon on the West, the Five Cowrie Creek to the North, and swamps on the East. The colonial government began the process of filling in the eastern swamps to reduce mosquito breeding areas. This created a land bridge between Victoria Island and Lekki Peninsula ending its existence as a true island.

After independence, successive state governments expanded this development, culminating in the construction of a highway connecting Victoria Island to Epe. This activity, along with the rapid commercialization of Victoria Island, served to stimulate residential development along the Lekki-Epe corridor, starting with Lekki Phase 1. The area of the land bridge, composed of the former swampland, became a large slum called Maroko Town which housed many of the new migrants to Lagos State. Residents of the Island complained about this problem, leading the military Governor of the State, Raji Rasaki, to forcibly remove the residents on 14 July 1990, resulting in numerous injuries. Governor Rasaki and his armed security forces caused the eviction of as many as 300,000 residents, some of whom had legal title to their property.

This new area established after the evictions was called Victoria Island Annex. It was cleared and sold to residential buyers.

Subsequent reclamation expanded the area to the extent that Victoria Island Annex is now connected to the Lekki Peninsula. This new, enlarged area is referred to as &quot;Oniru Estate&quot; after the ruling family of the area.

Originally designated an upscale residential area, failing infrastructure and overcrowding in the old business district on Lagos Island and lax zoning enforcement in Victoria Island led to a mass migration of businesses over the last twenty-five years. Today, Victoria Island is one of Nigeria&#x27;s busiest centres of banking and commerce, with most major Nigerian and international corporations headquartered on the Island.

The Island has continued to rapidly develop and along with Ikoyi, is a favourite spot for Nigerians and foreigners to live and play.

However, the influx of banks and other commercial ventures has changed the formerly serene atmosphere of the Island. Longtime residents complain about the increase in traffic and influx of street traders who cater to local bank employees and businessmen.

A new project being developed by the Chagoury Group includes the Eko Atlantic City, located next to Victoria Island. The project is being built on reclaimed land that has been lost to coastal erosion.

=== Maroko Town demolition ===
The displaced former residents of Maroko Town have pursued redress within the Nigerian justice system, without success. In 2008, a human rights organization, Social and Economic Rights Action Centre (SERAC), filed a complaint with the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#x27; Rights on behalf of the Moroko people.

Activists and displaced Maroko residents continue to hold Maroko Remembrance Day each year on 14 July.

== Culture ==
There are many galleries on Victoria Island.

==Economy==

Guaranty Trust Bank and Access Bank plc have their headquarters on the island, Halliburton and IBM operate offices on Victoria Island.

== Tourism ==

=== Nightclubs, Night life ===
Akin Adesola Street and the Adeola Odeku Street that runs into it on Victoria Island are the hot spot in terms of Lagos&#x27; better nightclubs.[6] Travel vlogger Drew Binsky raves about the city&#x27;s vibrant nightlife with its &quot;swanky bars, rowdy clubs, chill lounges and beach parties.&quot;

=== Rooftop restaurants ===

=== Adventure park, amusement centre ===

The &quot;Silverbird Galleria&quot; is a shopping and entertainment centre on upmarket Victoria Island. It is part of the Silverbird cinema chain and should not be confused with the cinemas of the same name in other parts of Lagos.

== Hospitals ==

<text>In variance analysis, direct material usage (efficiency, quantity) variance is the difference between the standard quantity of materials that should have been used for the number of units actually produced, and the actual quantity of materials used, valued at the standard cost per unit of material. It is one of the two components (the other is direct material price variance) of direct material total variance.

==Example==
Let us assume that standard direct material cost of widget is as follows:
:2 kg of unobtainium at € 60 per kg ( = € 120 per unit). 
Let us assume further that during given period, 100 widgets were manufactured, using 212 kg of unobtainium which cost €13,144.

Under those assumptions direct material usage variance can be calculated as:

Direct material usage variance can be reconciled to direct material total variance by way of direct material price variance:

See direct material total variance#Example and direct material price variance#Example for computations of both components.

<doc id="1269435" wikidata="Q47495783" url="?curid=1269435" title="Selegiline">
<text>Selegiline, also known as -deprenyl and sold under the brand names Eldepryl, Zelapar, and Emsam among others, is a medication which is used in the treatment of Parkinson&#x27;s disease and major depressive disorder. It has also been studied and used off-label for a variety of other indications, but has not been formally approved for any other use. The medication, in the form licensed for depression, has modest effectiveness for this condition that is similar to that of other antidepressants. Selegiline is provided as a swallowed tablet or capsule or an orally disintegrating tablet (ODT) for Parkinson&#x27;s disease and as a patch applied to skin for depression.
Side effects of selegiline occurring more often than with placebo include insomnia, dry mouth, dizziness, anxiety, abnormal dreams, and application site reactions (with the patch form), among others. At high doses, selegiline has the potential for dangerous food and drug interactions, such as tyramine-related hypertensive crisis (the so-called &quot;cheese reaction&quot;) and risk of serotonin syndrome. However, doses within the approved clinical range appear to have little to no risk of these interactions. In addition, the ODT and transdermal patch forms of selegiline have reduced risks of such interactions compared to the conventional oral form. Selegiline has no known misuse potential or dependence liability and is not a controlled substance except in Japan.
Selegiline acts as a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) and thereby increases levels of monoamine neurotransmitters in the brain. At typical clinical doses used for Parkinson&#x27;s disease, selegiline is a selective and irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), increasing brain levels of dopamine. At higher doses, it loses its specificity for MAO-B and also inhibits monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), which increases serotonin and norepinephrine levels in the brain as well. In addition to its MAOI activity, selegiline is a catecholaminergic activity enhancer (CAE) and enhances the impulse-mediated release of norepinephrine and dopamine in the brain. This action may be mediated by TAAR1 agonism. After administration, selegiline partially metabolizes into levomethamphetamine and levoamphetamine, which act as norepinephrine releasing agents (NRAs) and may contribute to its therapeutic and adverse effects as well. The levels of these metabolites are much lower with the ODT and transdermal patch forms of selegiline. Chemically, selegiline is a substituted phenethylamine and amphetamine, a derivative of methamphetamine, and the purified levorotatory enantiomer of deprenyl (the racemic mixture of selegiline and -deprenyl).
Deprenyl was discovered and studied as an antidepressant in the early 1960s by Zoltan Ecseri, József Knoll, and other colleagues at Chinoin Pharmaceutical Company in Hungary. Subsequently, selegiline was purified from deprenyl and was studied and developed itself. Selegiline was first introduced for medical use, to treat Parkinson&#x27;s disease, in Hungary in 1977. It was subsequently approved in the United Kingdom in 1982 and in the United States in 1989. The ODT was approved for Parkinson&#x27;s disease in the United States in 2006 and in the European Union in 2010, while the patch was introduced for depression in the United States in 2006. Selegiline was the first selective MAO-B inhibitor to be discovered and marketed. In addition to its medical use, there has been interest in selegiline as a potential anti-aging drug and nootropic. However, effects of this sort are controversial and uncertain. Generic versions of selegiline are available in the case of the conventional oral form, but not in the case of the ODT or transdermal patch forms.

==Medical uses==

===Parkinson&#x27;s disease===
In its oral and ODT forms, selegiline is used to treat symptoms of Parkinson&#x27;s disease (PD). It is most often used as an adjunct to medications such as levodopa (-DOPA), although it has been used off-label as a monotherapy. The rationale for adding selegiline to levodopa is to decrease the required dose of levodopa and thus reduce the motor complications of levodopa therapy. Selegiline delays the point when levodopa treatment becomes necessary from about 11months to about 18months after diagnosis. There is some evidence that selegiline acts as a neuroprotective and reduces the rate of disease progression, though this is disputed. In addition to parkinsonism, selegiline can improve symptoms of depression in people with Parkinson&#x27;s disease. There is evidence that selegiline may be more effective than rasagiline in the treatment of Parkinson&#x27;s disease. This may be due to pharmacological differences between the drugs, such as the catecholaminergic activity enhancer (CAE) actions of selegiline which rasagiline lacks.

===Depression===
Selegiline is used as an antidepressant in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Both the oral selegiline and transdermal selegiline patch formulations are used in the treatment of depression. However, oral selegiline is not approved for depression and is used off-label for this indication, while the transdermal patch is specifically licensed for treatment of depression. Both standard clinical doses of oral selegiline (up to 10mg/day) and higher doses of oral selegiline (e.g., 30 to 60mg/day) have been used to treat depression, with the lower doses selectively inhibiting MAO-B and the higher doses producing dual inhibition of both MAO-A and MAO-B. Unlike oral selegiline, transdermal selegiline bypasses first-pass metabolism, thereby avoiding inhibition of gastrointestinal and hepatic MAO-A and minimizing the risk of food and drug interactions, whilst still allowing for selegiline to reach the brain and inhibit MAO-B.

A 2023 systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the effectiveness and safety of selegiline in the treatment of psychiatric disorders including depression. It included both randomized and non-randomized published clinical studies. The meta-analysis found that selegiline was more effective than placebo in terms of reduction in depressive symptoms ( = −0.96, k = 10, n = 1,308), response rates for depression improvement ( = 1.61, k = 9, n = 1,238), and response rates for improvement of depression with atypical features ( = 2.23, k = 3, n = 136). Oral selegiline was significantly more effective than the selegiline patch in terms of depressive symptom improvement ( = −1.49, k = 6, n = 282 vs. = −0.27, k = 4, n = 1,026, respectively; p = 0.03). However, this was largely due to older and less methodologically rigorous trials that were at high risk for bias. Oral selegiline studies also often employed much higher doses than usual, for instance 20 to 60mg/day. The quality of evidence of selegiline for depression was rated as very low overall, very low for oral selegiline, and low to moderate for transdermal selegiline. For comparison, meta-analyses of other antidepressants for depression have found a mean effect size of about 0.3 (a small effect), which is similar to that with transdermal selegiline.

In two pivotal regulatory clinical trials of 6 to 8weeks duration, the selegiline transdermal patch decreased scores on depression rating scales (specifically the 17- and 28-item ) by 9.0 to 10.9points, whereas placebo decreased scores by 6.5 to 8.6points, giving placebo-subtracted differences attributable to selegiline of 2.4 to 2.5points. A 2013 quantitative review of the transdermal selegiline patch for depression, which pooled the results of these two trials, found that the placebo-subtracted number needed to treat (NNT) was 11 in terms of depression response (&gt;50% reduction in symptoms) and 9 in terms of remission of depression (score of ≤10 on the ). For comparison, other antidepressants, including fluoxetine, paroxetine, duloxetine, vilazodone, adjunctive aripiprazole, olanzapine/fluoxetine, and extended-release quetiapine, have NNTs ranging from 6 to 8 in terms of depression response and 7 to 14 in terms of depression remission. On the basis of these results, it was concluded that transdermal selegiline has similar effectiveness to other antidepressants. NNTs are measures of effect size and indicate how many individuals would need to be treated in order to encounter one additional outcome of interest. Lower NNTs are better, and NNTs corresponding to Cohen&#x27;s d effect sizes have been defined as 2.3 for a large effect (d = 0.8), 3.6 for a medium effect (d = 0.5), and 8.9 for a small effect (d = 0.2). The effectiveness of transdermal selegiline for depression relative to side effects and discontinuation was considered to be favorable.

While several large regulatory clinical trials of transdermal selegiline versus placebo for depression have been conducted, there is a lack of trials comparing selegiline to other antidepressants. Although multiple doses of transdermal selegiline were assessed, a dose–response relationship for depression was never established. Transdermal selegiline has shown similar clinical effectiveness in the treatment of atypical depression relative to typical depression and in the treatment of anxious depression relative to non-anxious depression.

Transdermal selegiline does not cause sexual dysfunction and may improve certain domains of sexual function, for instance sexual interest, maintaining interest during sex, and sexual satisfaction. These benefits were apparent in women but not in men. The lack of sexual dysfunction with transdermal selegiline is in contrast to many other antidepressants, such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), which are associated with high rates of sexual dysfunction.

Transdermal selegiline patches have been underutilized in the treatment of depression compared to other antidepressants. A variety of factors contributing to this underutilization have been identified. One major factor is the very high cost of transdermal selegiline, which is often not covered by insurance and frequently proves to be prohibitive. Conversely, other widely available antidepressants are much cheaper in comparison.

===Available forms===
Selegiline is available in the following three pharmaceutical forms:
* Oral tablets and capsules 5mg (brand names Eldepryl, Jumex, and generics) – indicated for Parkinson&#x27;s disease
* Orally disintegrating tablets (ODTs) 1.25mg (brand name Zelapar) – indicated for Parkinson&#x27;s disease
* Transdermal patches 6, 9, and 12mg/24hours (brand name Emsam) – indicated for major depressive disorder

The transdermal patch form is also known as the &quot;selegiline transdermal system&quot; or &quot;STS&quot; and is applied once daily. They are 20, 30, or 40cm2 in size and contain a total of 20, 30, or 40mg selegiline per patch (so 20mg/20cm2, 30mg/30cm2, and 40mg/40cm2), respectively. The selegiline transdermal patch is a matrix-type adhesive patch with a three-layer structure. It is the only approved non-oral MAOI, having reduced dietary restrictions and side effects in comparison to oral MAOIs, and is also the only approved non-oral first-line antidepressant. The selegiline patch can be useful for those who have difficulty tolerating oral medications.

==Contraindications==
Selegiline is contraindicated with serotonergic antidepressants including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), with serotonergic opioids like meperidine, tramadol, and methadone, with other monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) such as linezolid, phenelzine, and tranylcypromine, and with dextromethorphan, St. John&#x27;s wort, cyclobenzaprine, pentazocine, propoxyphene, and carbamazepine. Combination of selegiline with serotonergic agents may cause serotonin syndrome, while combination of selegiline with adrenergic or sympathomimetic agents like ephedrine or amphetamines may cause hypertensive crisis. Long washout periods are required before starting and stopping these medications with discontinuation or initiation of selegiline.

Consumption of tyramine-rich foods can result in hypertensive crisis with selegiline, also known as the &quot;cheese effect&quot; or &quot;cheese reaction&quot; due to the high amounts of tyramine present in some cheeses. Examples of other foods that may have high amounts of tyramine and similar substances include yeast products, chicken liver, snails, pickled herring, red wines, some beers, canned figs, broad beans, chocolate, and cream products.

The preceding drug and food contraindications are dependent on selegiline dose and route, and hence are not necessarily absolute contraindications. While high oral doses of selegiline (≥20mg/day) can cause such interactions, oral doses within the approved clinical range (≤10mg/day) appear to have little to no risk of these interactions. In addition, the ODT and transdermal forms of selegiline have reduced risks of such interactions compared to the conventional oral form.

Selegiline is also contraindicated in children less than 12years of age and in people with pheochromocytoma, both due to heightened risk of hypertensive crisis. For all human uses and all forms, selegiline is pregnancy category C, meaning that studies in pregnant animals have shown adverse effects on the fetus but there are no adequate studies in humans.

==Side effects==
Side effects of the tablet form in conjunction with levodopa include, in decreasing order of frequency, nausea, hallucinations, confusion, depression, loss of balance, insomnia, increased involuntary movements, agitation, slow or irregular heart rate, delusions, hypertension, new or increased angina pectoris, and syncope. Most of the side effects are due to a high dopamine levels, and can be alleviated by reducing the dose of levodopa. Selegiline can also cause cardiovascular side effects such as orthostatic hypotension, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and other types of cardiac arrhythmias.

The main side effects of the patch form for depression include application-site reactions, insomnia, dry mouth, dizziness, nervousness, and abnormal dreams. The selegiline patch carries a black box warning about a possible increased risk of suicide, especially for young people, as do all antidepressants since 2007.

Side effects of selegiline that have been identified as occurring significantly more often than with placebo in meta-analyses for psychiatric disorders have included dry mouth ( = 1.58), insomnia ( = 1.61, = 19), and application site reactions with the transdermal form ( = 1.81, = 7). No significant diarrhea, headache, dizziness, nausea, sexual dysfunction, or weight gain were apparent in these meta-analyses.

Selegiline, including in its oral, ODT, and patch forms, has been found to cause hypotension or orthostatic hypotension in some individuals. In a clinical trial, the rate of systolic orthostatic hypotension was 21% versus 9% with placebo and the rate of diastolic orthostatic hypotension was 12% versus 4% with placebo in people with Parkinson&#x27;s disease taking the ODT form of selegiline. The risk of hypotension is greater at the start of treatment and in the elderly (3% vs. 0% with placebo). The rate of hypotension or orthostatic hypotension with the selegiline patch was 2.2% versus 0.5% with placebo in clinical trials of people with depression. Significant orthostatic blood pressure changes (≥10mmHg decrease) occurred in 9.8% versus 6.7% with placebo, but most of these cases were asymptomatic and heart rate was unchanged. The rates of other orthostatic hypotension-related side effects in this population were dizziness or vertigo 4.9% versus 3.1% with placebo and fainting 0.5% versus 0.0% with placebo. It is said that orthostatic hypotension is rarely seen with the selegiline transdermal patch compared to oral MAOIs. Caution is advised against rapidly rising after sitting or lying, especially after prolonged periods or at the start of treatment, as this can result in fainting. Falls are of particular concern in the elderly. MAOIs like selegiline may lower blood pressure by increasing dopamine levels and activating dopamine receptors, by increasing levels of the false neurotransmitter octopamine, and/or by other mechanisms.

Meta-analyses published in the 1990s found that the addition of selegiline to levodopa increased mortality in people with Parkinson&#x27;s disease. However, several subsequent meta-analyses with more trials and patients found no increase in mortality with selegiline added to levodopa. If selegiline does increase mortality, it has been theorized that this may be due to cardiovascular side effects, such as its amphetamine-related sympathomimetic effects and its MAO inhibition-related hypotension. Although selegiline does not seem to increase mortality, it appears to worsen cognition in people with Parkinson&#x27;s disease over time. Conversely, rasagiline does not seem to do so and can enhance cognition.

Rarely, selegiline has been reported to induce or exacerbate impulse control disorders, pathological gambling, hypersexuality, and paraphilias in people with Parkinson&#x27;s disease. However, MAO-B inhibitors like selegiline causing impulse control disorders is uncommon, controversial, and less frequent than with dopamine receptor agonists like pramipexole. Impulse control disorders with dopaminergic agents have been linked specifically to activation of dopamine D3 receptors in the globus pallidus. Selegiline has also been reported to activate or worsen rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) in some people with Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

Selegiline has shown little or no misuse potential in humans or monkeys. Likewise, it has no dependence potential in rodents. This is in spite of its amphetamine active metabolites, levomethamphetamine and levoamphetamine, and is in contrast to agents like dextroamphetamine and dextromethamphetamine. However, selegiline can strongly potentiate the reinforcing effects of exogenous β-phenethylamine by inhibiting its MAO-B-mediated metabolism. Misuse of the combination of selegiline and β-phenethylamine has been reported.

==Overdose==
Little information is available about clinically significant selegiline overdose. The drug has been studied clinically at doses as high as 60mg/day orally, 10mg/day as an ODT, and 12mg/24hours as a transdermal patch. In addition, deprenyl (the racemic form) has been clinically studied orally at doses as large as 100mg/day. During clinical development of oral selegiline, some individuals who were exposed to doses of 600mg developed severe hypotension and psychomotor agitation. Overdose may result in non-selective inhibition of both MAO-A and MAO-B and may be similar to overdose of other non-selective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) like phenelzine, isocarboxazid, and tranylcypromine. Serotonin syndrome, hypertensive crisis, and/or death may occur with overdose. No specific antidote to selegiline overdose is available.

==Interactions==
===Serotonin syndrome and hypertensive crisis===
Both the oral and patch forms of selegiline come with strong warnings against combining it with drugs that could produce serotonin syndrome, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and the cough medicine dextromethorphan. Selegiline in combination with the opioid analgesic pethidine is not recommended, as it can lead to severe adverse effects. Several other synthetic opioids such as tramadol and methadone, as well as various triptans, are also contraindicated due to potential for serotonin syndrome.

All three forms of selegiline carry warnings about food restrictions to avoid hypertensive crisis that are associated with MAOIs. The patch form was created in part to overcome food restrictions; clinical trials showed that it was successful. Additionally, in post-marketing surveillance from April 2006 to October 2010, only 13self-reports of possible hypertensive events or hypertension were made out of 29,141exposures to the drug, and none were accompanied by objective clinical data. The lowest dose of the patch method of delivery, 6mg/24hours, does not require any dietary restrictions. Higher doses of the patch and oral formulations, whether in combination with the older non-selective MAOIs or in combination with the reversible MAO-A inhibitor (RIMA) moclobemide, require a low-tyramine diet.

A study found that selegiline in transdermal patch form did not importantly modify the pharmacodynamic effects or pharmacokinetics of the sympathomimetic agents pseudoephedrine and phenylpropanolamine. Likewise, oral selegiline at an MAO-B-selective dosage did not appear to modify the pharmacodynamic effects or pharmacokinetics of intravenous methamphetamine in another study. Conversely, selegiline, also at MAO-B-selective doses, has been found to reduce the physiological and euphoric subjective effects of cocaine whilst not affecting its pharmacokinetics in some studies but not in others. Cautious safe combination of MAOIs like selegiline with stimulants like lisdexamfetamine has been reported. However, a hypertensive crisis with selegiline and ephedrine has also been reported. The selegiline drug labels warn about combination of selegiline with indirectly acting sympathomimetic agents, like amphetamines, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine, due to the potential risk of hypertensive crisis, and recommend monitoring blood pressure with such combinations. The combination of selegiline with certain other medications, like phenylephrine and buspirone, is also warned against for similar reasons. In the case of phenylephrine, this drug is substantially metabolized by monoamine oxidase, including by both MAO-A and MAO-B. Selegiline can interact with exogenous dopamine, which is metabolized by MAO-A and MAO-B, and result in hypertensive crisis as well.

Besides norepinephrine releasing agents, selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (NRIs) may be safe in combination with MAOIs like selegiline. Potent NRIs, such as reboxetine, desipramine, protriptyline, and nortriptyline, can reduce or block the pressor effects of tyramine, including in those taking MAOIs. This is by inhibiting the norepinephrine transporter (NET) and preventing entry of tyramine into presynaptic noradrenergic neurons where tyramine induces the release of norepinephrine. As a result, NRIs may reduce the risk of tyramine-related hypertensive crisis in people taking MAOIs. Norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs), like methylphenidate and bupropion, are also considered to be safe in combination with MAOIs. However, initiation at low doses and slow upward dose titration is advisable in the case of both NRIs and NDRIs due to possible potentiation of their effects and side effects by MAOIs.

===Cytochrome P450 inhibitors and inducers===
The cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in the metabolism of selegiline have not been fully elucidated. CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 metabolizer phenotypes did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of selegiline, suggesting that these enzymes are minimally involved in its metabolism and that inhibitors and inducers of these enzymes would not importantly affect its pharmacokinetics. However, although most pharmacokinetic variables were unaffected, overall exposure to selegiline&#x27;s metabolite levomethamphetamine was 46% higher in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers compared to extensive metabolizers and exposure to its metabolite desmethylselegiline was 68% higher in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers compared to extensive metabolizers. As with the cases of CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, the strong CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 inhibitor itraconazole has minimal impact on the pharmacokinetics of selegiline, suggesting lack of major involvement of this enzyme as well. On the other hand, the anticonvulsant carbamazepine, which is known to act as a strong inducer of CYP3A enzymes, has paradoxically been found to increase exposure to selegiline and its metabolites levomethamphetamine and levoamphetamine by approximately 2-fold (with selegiline used as the transdermal patch form). One enzyme thought to be majorly involved in the metabolism of selegiline based on &quot;in-vitro&quot; studies is CYP2B6. However, there are no clinical studies of different CYP2B6 metabolizer phenotypes or of CYP2B6 inhibitors or inducers on the pharmacokinetics of selegiline. In addition to CYP2B6, CYP2A6 may be involved in the metabolism of selegiline to a lesser extent.

Birth control pills containing the synthetic estrogen ethinylestradiol and a progestin like gestodene or levonorgestrel have been found to increase peak levels and overall exposure to oral selegiline by 10- to 20-fold. High levels of selegiline can lead to loss of MAO-B selectivity and inhibition of MAO-A as well. This increases susceptibility to side effects and interactions of non-selective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), such as tyramine-induced hypertensive crisis and serotonin toxicity when combined with serotonergic medications. However, this study had a small sample size of four individuals as well as other methodological limitations. The precise mechanism underlying the interaction is unknown, but is likely related to cytochrome P450 inhibition and consequent inhibition of selegiline first-pass metabolism by ethinylestradiol. In contrast to birth control pills containing ethinylestradiol, menopausal hormone therapy with estradiol and levonorgestrel did not modify peak levels of selegiline and only modestly increased overall exposure (+59%). Hence, menopausal hormone therapy does not pose the same risk of interaction as ethinylestradiol-containing birth control pills when taken together with selegiline.

Overall exposure to selegiline with oral selegiline has been found to be 23-fold lower in people taking anticonvulsants known to strongly activate drug-metabolizing enzymes. The anticonvulsants included phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and amobarbital. In a previous study however, carbamazepine specifically did not reduce selegiline exposure. Phenobarbital and certain other anticonvulsants are known to strongly induce CYP2B6, one of the major enzymes believed to be involved in selegiline metabolism. As such, it was concluded that strong CYP2B6 induction was most likely responsible for the dramatically reduced exposure to selegiline observed in the study.

===Selegiline inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes===
Selegiline has been reported to inhibit several cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5, CYP2C19, CYP2B6, and CYP2A6. It is a mechanism-based inhibitor (suicide inhibitor) of CYP2B6 and has been said to &quot;potently&quot; or &quot;strongly&quot; inhibit this enzyme &quot;in vitro&quot;. It may inhibit the metabolism of bupropion, a major CYP2B6 substrate, into its active metabolite hydroxybupropion. However, a study predicted that inhibition of CYP2B6 by selegiline would non-significantly affect exposure to bupropion. Selegiline has not been listed or described as a clinically significant CYP2B6 inhibitor by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as of 2023. One small study observing three patients found that selegiline was safe and well-tolerated in combination with bupropion. In addition to CYP2B6 and other cytochrome P450 enzymes, selegiline is a potent mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP2A6 and may increase exposure to nicotine (a major CYP2A6 substrate). By inhibiting cytochrome P450 enzymes like CYP2B6 and CYP1A2, selegiline may inhibit its own metabolism and thereby interact with itself.

===Other interactions===
Dopamine antagonists like antipsychotics or metoclopramide, which block dopamine receptors and thereby antagonize the dopaminergic effects of selegiline, could potentially reduce the effectiveness of the medication. Dopamine-depleting agents like reserpine and tetrabenazine, by reducing dopamine levels, can also oppose the effectiveness of dopaminergic medications like selegiline.

==Pharmacology==
===Pharmacodynamics===
Selegiline has multiple known mechanisms of action in terms of its pharmacodynamic activity. It is most notably an irreversible monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor (MAOI). More specifically, it is a selective inhibitor of monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) at lower doses (≤10mg/day) but additionally inhibits monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) at higher doses (≥20mg/day). MAO-B inhibition is thought to result in increased levels of dopamine and β-phenethylamine, whereas MAO-A inhibition results in increased levels of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Selegiline is also a catecholaminergic activity enhancer (CAE) and enhances the action potential-evoked release of norepinephrine and dopamine. The CAE activity of selegiline may be mediated by TAAR1 agonism. Both the MAOI activity and CAE activity of selegiline may be involved in its therapeutic effects in the treatment of Parkinson&#x27;s disease and depression. According to József Knoll and other researchers, selegiline might have dopaminergic neuroprotective effects, might be able to modestly slow the rate of aging-related dopaminergic neurodegeneration, and might thereby have a disease-modifying effect in Parkinson&#x27;s disease and antiaging effects generally. However, these theoretical effects of selegiline have not been clearly demonstrated in humans as of present and remain to be substantiated. Through its active metabolites levomethamphetamine (-MA) and levoamphetamine (-A), selegiline acts as a weak norepinephrine and/or dopamine releasing agent (NDRA). The clinical significance of this action is unclear, but it may be relevant to the effects and side effects of selegiline, especially at higher doses. Its active metabolite desmethylselegiline (DMS) also has MAOI and CAE activity and likely contributes to its effects as well. Levels of selegiline&#x27;s metabolites are much lower with the ODT and transdermal patch forms of selegiline than with the oral form and this may result in differences in its effects and side effects.

===Pharmacokinetics===

Selegiline is available in forms for use by multiple different routes of administration and its pharmacokinetics vary by route. The bioavailability of the oral form of selegiline is 4 to 10%, of the ODT is 5 to 8times that of the oral form, and of the transdermal patch is 75%. The time to peak levels of selegiline with oral administration is about 0.5 to 1.5hours. The plasma protein binding of selegiline is 85 to 90%. It is metabolized extensively in the liver by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2B6 among other enzymes. Metabolites of selegiline include desmethylselegiline (DMS), levomethamphetamine (-MA), and levoamphetamine (-A). The oral form of selegiline is subject to strong first-pass metabolism and levels of the metabolites of selegiline are much lower with the ODT and transdermal patch forms than with the oral form. The elimination half-lives of selegiline and its metabolites range from 1.2 to 10hours for selegiline, 2.2 to 9.5hours for DMS, 14 to 21hours for levomethamphetamine, and 16 to 18hours for levoamphetamine. Selegiline and its metabolites are eliminated mainly in urine (87% in urine and 15% in feces via oral administration), with its metabolites accounting for virtually all of the eliminated material in the case of the oral form. Hepatic impairment and renal impairment have been found to dramatically increase exposure to selegiline.

==Chemistry==
Selegiline is a substituted phenethylamine and amphetamine derivative. It is also known as (&quot;R&quot;)-(–)-&quot;N&quot;,α-dimethyl-&quot;N&quot;-(2-propynyl)phenethylamine, (&quot;R&quot;)-(–)-&quot;N&quot;-methyl-&quot;N&quot;-2-propynylamphetamine, or &quot;N&quot;-propargyl--methamphetamine. Selegiline (-deprenyl) is the enantiopure levorotatory enantiomer of the racemic mixture deprenyl, whereas -deprenyl is the dextrorotatory enantiomer. Selegiline is a derivative of levomethamphetamine (-methamphetamine), the levorotatory enantiomer of the psychostimulant and sympathomimetic agent methamphetamine (&quot;N&quot;-methylamphetamine), with a propargyl group attached to the nitrogen atom of the molecule.

Selegiline is a small-molecule compound, with the molecular formula C13H17N and a low molecular weight of 187.281g/mol. It has high lipophilicity, with an experimental log P of 2.7 and predicted log P values of 2.9 to 3.1. Pharmaceutically, selegiline is used almost always as the hydrochloride salt, though the free base form has also been used. At room temperature, selegiline hydrochloride is a white to near white crystalline powder. Selegiline hydrochloride is freely soluble in water, chloroform, and methanol.

===Analogues===
Selegiline is a close analogue of methamphetamine and amphetamine, and in fact produces their levorotatory forms, levomethamphetamine and levoamphetamine, as metabolites. Selegiline is structurally similar to the antihypertensive agent pargyline (&quot;N&quot;-methyl-&quot;N&quot;-propargylbenzylamine), an earlier non-selective MAOI of the phenylalkylamine group. Besides selegiline and pargyline, another clinically used MAOI of the phenylalkylamine and amphetamine families is the antidepressant tranylcypromine (&quot;trans&quot;-2-phenylcyclopropylamine). Tranylcypromine can be conceptualized as a cyclized amphetamine and has amphetamine-like actions at high doses similarly to selegiline. Another notable analogue of selegiline is 4-fluoroselegiline, a variation of selegiline in which one of the hydrogen atoms of the phenyl ring has been replaced with a fluorine atom. A large number of other analogues of selegiline derived via structural modification have been synthesized and characterized.

Rasagiline ((&quot;R&quot;)-&quot;N&quot;-propargyl-1-aminoindan) is an analogue of selegiline in which the amphetamine base structure has been replaced with a 1-aminoindan structure and the &quot;N&quot;-methyl group has been removed. Like selegiline, it is also a selective MAO-B inhibitor and used to treat Parkinson&#x27;s disease. In contrast to selegiline however, rasagiline lacks the amphetamine metabolites and activity of selegiline. A further derivative of rasagiline, ladostigil ([&quot;N&quot;-propargyl-(3&quot;R&quot;)-aminoindan-5-yl]-&quot;N&quot;-propylcarbamate), a dual MAO-B inhibitor and acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, was developed for treatment of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and other conditions but was ultimately never introduced for medical use.

===Synthesis===
Selegiline can be synthesized by the alkylation of levomethamphetamine using propargyl bromide.

==History==
Following the discovery in 1952 that the tuberculosis drug iproniazid elevated the mood of people taking it, and the subsequent discovery that the effect was likely due to inhibition of monoamine oxidase (MAO) and elevation of monoamine neurotransmitters in the brain, many people and companies started trying to discover monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) to use as antidepressants. Deprenyl, the racemic form of selegiline, was synthesized and discovered by Zoltan Ecseri at the Chinoin Pharmaceutical Company (part of Sanofi since 1993) in Budapest, Hungary. Chinoin received a patent on the drug in 1962 and the compound was first published in the scientific literature in English in 1965. Chinoin researchers had been studying substituted amphetamines since 1960, and decided to try synthesizing amphetamines that acted as MAOIs. It had been known that methamphetamine was a reversible inhibitor of MAO. Deprenyl, also known as &quot;N&quot;-propargyl-&quot;N&quot;-methylamphetamine, is closely related to and inspired by pargyline (&quot;N&quot;-propargyl-&quot;N&quot;-methylbenzylamine), another MAOI that had been synthesized earlier. Deprenyl was initially referred to by the chemical name &quot;phenylisopropylmethylpropinylamine&quot; and the developmental code name &quot;E-250&quot;. Work on the biology and effects of E-250 in animals and humans was conducted by a group led by József Knoll at Semmelweis University, which was also in Budapest.

Deprenyl is a racemic compound (a mixture of two isomers called enantiomers). The racemic form has mild amphetamine-like psychostimulant effects that are diminished compared to those of amphetamine but are still present. The levorotatory enantiomer has further reduced stimulant effects, and further work, published in 1967, determined that the levorotatory enantiomer was a more potent MAOI than the dextrorotatory enantiomer. As a result, subsequent work was done with the single enantiomer -deprenyl. In 1968, it was discovered by J. P. Johnston that monoamine oxidase exists in multiple forms. In 1971, Knoll showed that selegiline highly selectively inhibits the B-isoform of monoamine oxidase (MAO-B) and proposed that it is unlikely to cause the infamous &quot;cheese effect&quot; (hypertensive crisis resulting from consuming foods containing tyramine) that occurs with non-selective MAOIs. The lack of potentiation of tyramine effect by deprenyl had previously been reported in 1966 and 1968 studies, but could not be mechanistically explained until after the existence of multiple forms of MAO was discovered. Selegiline was the first selective MAO-B inhibitor to be discovered and hence is described as prototypical of these agents.

Deprenyl and selegiline were initially studied as antidepressants for treatment of depression. Deprenyl was first found to be effective for depression from 1965 to 1967, while selegiline was first found to be effective for depression in 1971 and this was further corroborated in 1980. A 1984 study that combined selegiline with phenylalanine reported remarkably high effectiveness in the treatment of depression similar to that with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). However, selegiline in its original oral form was never further developed or approved for the treatment of depression.

A few years after the discovery that selegiline was a selective MAO-B inhibitor, two Parkinson&#x27;s disease researchers based in Vienna, Peter Riederer and Walther Birkmayer, realized that selegiline could be useful in Parkinson&#x27;s disease. One of their colleagues, Moussa B. H. Youdim, visited Knoll in Budapest and took selegiline from him to Vienna. In 1975, Birkmayer&#x27;s group published the first paper on the effect of selegiline in Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

Speculation, by József Knoll, that selegiline could be useful as an anti-aging and pro-sexual agent, began in the 1980s. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that selegiline was being used non-medically as a &quot;smart drug&quot; by 1992.

Selegiline was first introduced for clinical use in Hungary in 1977. It was approved in the oral pill form under the brand name Jumex to treat Parkinson&#x27;s disease. The drug was then introduced in the United Kingdom in 1982. In 1987, Somerset Pharmaceuticals in New Jersey, which had acquired the rights to develop selegiline in the United States, filed a New Drug Application (NDA) with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to market the drug for Parkinson&#x27;s disease in this country. While the NDA was under review, Somerset was acquired in a joint venture by two generic drug companies, Mylan and Bolan Pharmaceuticals. Selegiline was approved for Parkinson&#x27;s disease by the FDA in 1989.

It had been known since the mid-1960s that high doses of deprenyl had psychostimulant effects. Selegiline was first shown to metabolize into levomethamphetamine and levoamphetamine in humans in 1978. The involvement of these metabolites in the effects and side effects of selegiline has remained controversial and unresolved in the decades afterwards. In any case, concerns about these metabolites have contributed to the development of newer MAO-B inhibitors like rasagiline and safinamide that lack such metabolites.

The catecholaminergic activity enhancer (CAE) effects of selegiline became well-characterized and distinctly named in 1994. These effects had been observed much earlier, dating back to the 1960s and 1970s, but were not properly distinguished from the other actions of selegiline, like MAO-B inhibition, until the 1990s. More potent, selective, and/or expansive monoaminergic activity enhancers (MAEs), like phenylpropylaminopentane (PPAP) and benzofuranylpropylaminopentane (BPAP), were derived from selegiline and other compounds and were first described in 1988 and 1999, respectively. These drugs had been proposed for potential treatment of psychiatric disorders like depression as well as for Parkinson&#x27;s disease and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, but were never developed or marketed.

In the 1990s, J. Alexander Bodkin at McLean Hospital, an affiliate of Harvard Medical School, began a collaboration with Somerset to develop delivery of selegiline via a transdermal patch in order to avoid the well known dietary restrictions of MAOIs. Somerset obtained FDA approval to market the patch for depression in 2006. Similarly, the orally disintegrating tablet (ODT) form of selegiline, marketed under the brand name Zelapar, was approved for Parkinson&#x27;s disease in the United States in 2006 and in the European Union in 2010.

Binding to and agonism of the trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs) as the mechanism responsible for the MAE effects of selegiline and related MAEs like PPAP and BPAP was first suggested in the early 2000s following the discovery of the TAARs. Activation of the TAAR1 as the mechanism of the MAE effects was first clearly substantiated in 2022.

==Society and culture==
===Names===
&quot;Selegiline&quot; is the generic name of the drug and its , , and , while &quot;selegiline hydrochloride&quot; is the . The word &quot;selegiline&quot; is pronounced () or as &quot;seh-LEH-ji-leen&quot;. Selegiline is also known as -deprenyl, -deprenil, -deprenalin, -deprenaline, -phenylisopropylmethylpropinylamine, and -E-250. It should not be confused with the racemic form, deprenyl (E-250), or with the dextrorotatory enantiomer, -deprenyl, which are distinct substances.

Major brand names of selegiline include Eldepryl, Jumex, and Movergan (oral tablet and/or capsule), Zelapar (orally disintegrating tablet or ODT), and Emsam (transdermal patch). Selegiline has been marketed under more than 70brand names worldwide. The brand name &quot;Emsam&quot; was derived from the names of two children, Emily and Samuel, of one of the executives at Somerset Pharmaceuticals, the developer of Emsam.

===Generic forms===
Generic forms of oral selegiline are available in the United States. However, generic forms of the orally disintegrating tablet and the transdermal patch are not available in this country. The latter formulations of selegiline are very expensive, and this can be prohibitive to their use. There has been poor insurance coverage of the transdermal patch form for depression, with insurance companies often requiring patients to first fail to respond to one or two other antidepressants and to be responsible for larger copayments. It is expected that generics of the transdermal patch will become available at some point in the future.

===Availability===
Conventional oral selegiline (brand names Eldepryl, Jumex) is widely marketed throughout the world, including in over 70countries. Conversely, the selegiline transdermal patch (brand name Emsam) is only marketed in the United States, while the selegiline orally disintegrating tablet (brand name Zelapar) is marketed in the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union.

===Notable users===
József Knoll, one of the developers of selegiline, began taking a low 1mg daily dose of selegiline on January 1, 1989, at the age of 64. He reported in 2012 that this had continued for 22years uninterrupted. Knoll stated that he had become so fascinated with the possible longevity-promoting effects of selegiline that he had decided to start taking it as a self-experiment. Knoll later died in 2018 at the age of 93.

David Pearce, a British transhumanist philosopher, wrote his self-published book-length internet manifesto &quot;The Hedonistic Imperative&quot; six weeks after starting to take selegiline.

Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder and former CEO of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange, is known to have used selegiline for depression in the form of the Emsam patch for at least 5 to 10years. He is also known to have simultaneously taken Adderall for treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and to have possessed non-pharmaceutical adrafinil, a prodrug of modafinil.

===Fictional representations===
In Gregg Hurwitz&#x27;s novel &quot;Out of the Dark&quot;, selegiline (&quot;Emsam&quot;) and tyramine-containing food were used to assassinate the president of the United States.

===Internet vendors===
Selegiline in non-pharmaceutical form is sold on the Internet without a prescription by online vendors for uses such as purported cognitive enhancement (i.e., as a so-called &quot;smart drug&quot; or nootropic) and anti-aging effects. It is widely available for such purposes, for instance under informal brand names like Dep-Pro, Selepryl, and Cyprenil, which are oral liquid solutions of selegiline at a concentration of 1mg per drop.

===Presence in ecstasy===
In his 1993 book &quot;E for Ecstasy&quot; examining the uses of the street drug ecstasy in the United Kingdom, the writer, activist, and ecstasy advocate Nicholas Saunders highlighted test results showing that certain consignments of the drug also contained selegiline. Consignments of ecstasy known as &quot;Strawberry&quot; contained what Saunders described as a &quot;potentially dangerous combination of ketamine, ephedrine and selegiline,&quot; as did a consignment of &quot;Sitting Duck&quot; Ecstasy tablets.

===Doping in sport===
Selegline is on the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)&#x27;s list of prohibited substances. It is classified as a &quot;stimulant&quot; in this list, along with various amphetamines, methylphenidate, adrenergic sympathomimetics, modafinil, and other agents. A review of the pharmacology of WADA prohibited substances noted that although selegiline is classified as a stimulant in the WADA prohibited substances list and stimulants can enhance physical performance, selegiline was seemingly included in the list not because of any short-term stimulant effects of its own, but rather because it metabolizes into small amounts of levomethamphetamine and levoamphetamine and can produce false positives for amphetamines on drug tests. In any case, levomethamphetamine and levoamphetamine are catecholamine releasing agents and can produce sympathomimetic and psychostimulant effects with sufficiently high exposure. Such actions may have performance-enhancing effects.

===Regulatory status===
Selegiline is a prescription drug. It is not specifically a controlled substance in the United States and hence is not an illegal drug. However, deprenyl and selegiline are controlled substances in Japan. They are classified as &quot;Stimulants&quot;, alongside a variety of other amphetamines, under Article 2 of Japan&#x27;s Narcotics and Psychotropics Control Law. Selegiline is known to metabolize into small amounts of levoamphetamine and levomethamphetamine but is thought to have little to no misuse potential or dependence liability.

==Non-medical use==
===Anti-aging and longevity===
József Knoll and his team are credited with having developed selegiline. Although selegiline&#x27;s development as a potential treatment for Parkinson&#x27;s disease, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, and depression was headed by other teams, Knoll remained at the forefront of research into the potential longevity enhancing effects of selegiline up until his death in 2018. Knoll published his 2012 book &quot;How Selegiline ((–)-Deprenyl) Slows Brain Aging&quot; wherein he claims that:

&quot;In humans, maintenance from sexual maturity on (–)-deprenyl (1mg daily) is, for the time being, the most promising prophylactic treatment to fight against the age related decay of behavioral performances, prolonging life, and preventing or delaying the onset of age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson&#x27;s and Alzheimer&#x27;s&quot;.

The mechanism of selegiline&#x27;s longevity-promoting effect has been researched by several groups, including Knoll and his associates at Semmelweis University, Budapest. The drug has been determined to be a catecholaminergic activity enhancer when present in minuscule concentrations far below those at which monoamine oxidase inhibitory activity can be observed, thereby potentiating the release of catecholamine neurotransmitters in response to stimuli. Knoll maintains that micro-doses of selegiline act as a synthetic analogue to a known or unknown trace amine in order to preserve the brain catecholaminergic system, which he perceives as integral to the organism&#x27;s ability to function in an adaptive, goal-directed and motivated manner during advancing physical age:

&quot;[...] enhancer regulation in the catecholaminergic brain stem neurons play[s] a key role in controlling the uphill period of life and the transition from adolescence to adulthood. The results of our longevity studies support the hypothesis that quality and duration of life rests upon the inborn efficiency of the catecholaminergic brain machinery, i.e. a high performing, long-living individual has a more active, more slowly deteriorating catecholaminergic system than its low performing, shorter living peer. Thus, a better brain engine allows for a better performance and a longer lifespan.&quot;

&quot;Since the catecholaminergic and serotonergic neurons in the brain stem are of key importance in ensuring that the mammalian organism works as a purposeful, motivated, goal-directed entity, it is hard to overestimate the significance of finding safe and efficient means to slow the decay of these systems with passing time. The conclusion that the maintenance on (–)-deprenyl that keeps the catecholaminergic neurons on a higher activity level is a safe and efficient anti-aging therapy follows from the discovery of the enhancer regulation in the catecholaminergic neurons of the brain stem. From the finding that this regulation starts working on a high activity level after weaning and the enhanced activity subsists during the uphill period of life, until sexual hormones dampen the enhancer regulation in the catecholaminergic and serotonergic neurons in the brain stem, and this event signifies the transition from developmental longevity into postdevelopmental longevity, the downhill period of life.&quot;

Despite findings by Knoll that selegiline can prolong lifespan in rodents by 35% however, other studies have had conflicting findings and have even found increased mortality with selegiline in rodents. In humans with Parkinson&#x27;s disease, selegiline has been associated with cardiovascular and psychiatric complications and has not been found to reduce mortality in long-term studies. As such, the claimed anti-aging and longevity benefits of selegiline have yet to be substantiated in humans and are controversial and uncertain.

===Nootropic or &quot;smart drug&quot;===
Selegiline is considered by some to be a nootropic, otherwise known as a cognitive enhancer or &quot;smart drug&quot;, both at clinical and sub-clinical dosages, and has been used off-label and non-medically to improve cognitive performance. It is one of the most popular such agents. Selegiline has been found to have neuroprotective activity against certain neurotoxins and to increase the production of several brain growth factors, such as nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). The drug has also been found in animal models to improve learning ability and to help preserve it during ischemia and aging. Despite claims that selegiline and other claimed nootropics have cogintive-enhancing effects however, these effects are controversial and their benefits versus risks are uncertain.

==Research==
===Depression===
Selegiline has been clinically studied in combination with oral -phenylalanine or β-phenethylamine in the treatment of depression and was reported to be effective. -Phenylalanine is known to be metabolized into β-phenethylamine, selegiline is known to strongly inhibit the metabolism of β-phenethylamine, and β-phenethylamine has been implicated in having psychostimulant-like mood-lifting effects.

===Social anxiety===
A small clinical study found that oral selegiline (10mg/day) reduced symptoms of social anxiety disorder. The effectiveness was modest, with a reduction in social anxiety scores from baseline of 32% over 6weeks of treatment. It was seemingly less effective than certain other agents used in the treatment of social anxiety, such as the non-selective MAOI phenelzine (45% symptom reduction) and the benzodiazepine clonazepam (51% symptom reduction), though it was similar to the SSRI sertraline (32% symptom decrease).

===ADHD===
Selegiline has been limitedly studied in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children, adolescents, and adults. In a small randomized trial of selegiline for treatment of ADHD in children, there were improvements in attention, hyperactivity, and learning/memory performance but not in impulsivity. A small clinical randomized trial compared selegiline to methylphenidate, a first line treatment for ADHD, and reported equivalent efficacy as assessed by parent and teacher ratings. In another small randomized controlled trial of selegiline for the treatment of adult ADHD, a high dose of the medication for 6weeks was not significantly more effective than placebo in improving symptoms. Selegiline in its transdermal patch form (brand name Emsam) has also been assessed in the treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents in a small open-label pilot study sponsored by the manufacturer in 2003. However, there was a high rate of discontinuation and development was not further pursued.

===Motivational disorders===
Selegiline has been found to produce pro-motivational effects and to reverse motivational deficits in rodents. In case reports and small clinical studies, selegiline has been reported to improve disorders of diminished motivation like apathy and abulia due to conditions such as traumatic brain injury. In accordance with the preceding findings, selegiline, along with other dopaminergic and activating agents, may be useful in the treatment of disorders of diminished motivation, including apathy, abulia, and akinetic mutism.

===Addiction===
Selegiline has been evaluated for smoking cessation both as a monotherapy and in combination with nicotine replacement therapy in five clinical studies. However, it is limitedly or not effective for this use. It was also evaluated for treatment of cocaine dependence in one study, but was similarly not effective. Studies are mixed on whether selegiline, at MAO-B-selective doses, reduces the effects of cocaine in humans. Selegiline, also at an MAO-B-selective dosage, did not modify or potentiate the pharmacological effects of intravenous methamphetamine in a small clinical study.

===Sexual dysfunction===
Selegiline has been assessed for treatment of sexual dysfunction induced by antipsychotics in people with schizophrenia, but was not effective in a single small clinical study. It also did not improve sexual function in men with depression, but did improve several domains of sexual function in women with depression.

===Psychosis===
Selegiline has been studied as an adjunct to antipsychotics in the treatment of schizophrenia in four clinical studies. However, it failed to significantly reduce positive or negative symptoms of schizophrenia in meta-analyses of these studies.

===Excessive sleepiness===
Selegiline has been evaluated for the treatment of narcolepsy in three small clinical studies. It was found to be effective in these studies. A dosage of 10mg/day had no effect on symptoms, but 20 to 30mg/day improved alertness, mood, and somewhat reduced cataplexy, clinical effects that have been described as comparable to the same dosages of amphetamine. Animal research indicates that the beneficial effects of high doses of selegiline in narcolepsy are likely due to conversion into its active metabolites, levoamphetamine and levomethamphetamine. Selegiline has also been evaluated for treatment of hypersomnia (excessive sleeping or sleepiness) in people with myotonic dystrophy, but its effectiveness was very uncertain.

===Periodic limb movement disorder===
Selegiline has been studied in the treatment of periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) in a single small open-label clinical study. It was reported to be effective as assessed by polysomnography, reducing periodic limb movements during sleep by about 60%. Selegiline has not been studied for the related condition restless legs syndrome (RLS) as of 2023. The drug has not been studied well enough in PLMD or RLS to be widely used in their treatment.

===Tardive dyskinedia===
Selegiline was studied in the treatment of antipsychotic-induced tardive dyskinesia in one small clinical study, but was ineffective.

===Dementia and stroke===
Selegiline has also been used off-label as a palliative treatment for dementia in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. However, its clinical effectiveness is limited or lacking for this use. It was also ineffective in the treatment of Lewy body dementia. Selegiline has been used to support motor rehabilitation in stroke recovery, but evidence for this use is inadequate and no recommendation can be made for or against it.

===Disorders of consciousness===
Selegiline has been studied in patients with disorders of consciousness, such as minimally conscious state, persistent vegetative state, and persistent coma, in a small open-label clinical study. It was found to be effective in enhancing arousal and promoting recovery of consciousness in some of these individuals.

===Neurotoxicity===
Selegiline has been reported to protect against the damage caused by the potent dopaminergic and/or noradrenergic neurotoxins 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), &quot;N&quot;-(2-chloroethyl)-&quot;N&quot;-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP-4), and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) in animals. Conversely, selegiline is ineffective in protecting against the serotonergic and noradrenergic neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT).

Selegiline has also been reported to protect against methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-induced serotonergic neurotoxicity in rodents. The serotonergic neurotoxicity of MDMA appears to be dependent on release of dopamine and its subsequent metabolism by MAO-B within serotonergic neurons into hydroxyl radicals, which is blocked by MAO-B inhibition. Likewise, selegiline prevented the serotonergic neurotoxicity of a combination of methylenedioxyaminoindane (MDAI) and dextroamphetamine.

Conversely, selegiline failed to reduce the serotonergic neurotoxicity caused by fenfluramine and either did not affect or potentiated the serotonergic neurotoxicity caused by &quot;para&quot;-chloroamphetamine (PCA). In addition, findings are mixed and conflicting on whether selegiline prevents amphetamine- and methamphetamine-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity in rodents.

Although MAO-B-selective doses of selegiline protect against MDMA-induced serotonergic neurotoxicity in rodents, combination of amphetamines like MDMA with MAOIs, including selegiline, can produce serious complications, including serotonin syndrome, hypertensive crisis, and death.

===Other formulations===
The original oral formulation of selegiline was developed for the treatment of depression. However, it ended up being developed and approved for the treatment of Parkinson&#x27;s disease instead. In any case, oral selegiline has been widely used off-label to treat depression. The transdermal patch form of selegiline was developed and approved specifically for the treatment of depression. It was also under development for the treatment of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), cognition disorders, and Parkinson&#x27;s disease, but development for these indications was discontinued. The ODT form of selegiline was developed and licensed exclusively for the treatment of Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

==Veterinary use==
In veterinary medicine, selegiline is sold under the brand name Anipryl and is manufactured by Zoetis. It is available in the form of 2, 5, 10, 15, and 30mg oral tablets for use in animals. Selegiline is used in dogs to treat canine cognitive dysfunction (CCD) and, at higher doses, to treat pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism (PDH).

CCD is a form of dementia that mimics Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in humans. Geriatric dogs treated with selegiline show improvements in sleeping pattern, reduced urinary incontinence, and increased activity level, with most showing improvements by one month of treatment. Though it is labeled for use in dogs only, selegiline has been used off-label for geriatric cats with cognitive dysfunction.

PDH is a hormonal disorder and is analogous to pituitary-dependent Cushing&#x27;s syndrome in humans. Selegiline&#x27;s effectiveness in treating PDH has been disputed. Theoretically, it works by increasing dopamine levels, which downregulates the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the brain, eventually leading to reduced levels of cortisol. Some claim that selegiline is only effective at treating PDH caused by lesions in the anterior pituitary (which comprise most canine cases). The greatest sign of improvement is lessening of PDH-related abdominal distention.

Side effects in dogs are uncommon, but they include vomiting, diarrhea, diminished hearing, salivation, decreased weight, and behavioral changes such as hyperactivity, listlessness, disorientation, and repetitive motions.

Selegiline has been limitedly studied in large animals like horses and its dosage in these animals has not been established. In preliminary research, a dose of selegiline of 30mg orally or intravenously in horses had no observable effects on behavior or locomotor activity.

The doses of selegiline used in animals are described as extremely high relative to those used in humans (which are ~0.1mg/kg body weight).

<text>Petrila (; ) is a town in the Jiu Valley, Hunedoara County, Transylvania, Romania. It is located near the confluence of the rivers Jiul de Est, Taia, and Jieț.

The town administers four villages: Cimpa (&quot;Csimpa&quot;), Jieț (&quot;Zsiec&quot;), Răscoala (&quot;Reszkola&quot;), and Tirici.

==History==
A Romanian town in the Carpathian Mountains, Petrila is an ancient settlement, but its existence was not documented until 1493 in a donation letter between Vladislav the First, King of Hungary and a Romanian prince named Mihai Cande.

The name of the town was noted in 1733 as coming from the Latin word “petrinus” (&quot;pietros&quot; in Romanian), which can be translated into English to mean “of stone”, a reference to the large coal deposits in the area that would become a profitable export in the Industrial Revolution. The exploitation of coal deposits in and around Petrila made the town grow as a single-industry town, revolving either around the mining of coal or the processing of the coal mined there, which is listed under the grade “Pitcoal”. Mining operations began in 1840, but the town would remain sparsely populated until the arrival of Western Moldavian workers forced to relocate by the former president of Romania Nicolae Ceaușescu under Communist rule. The restructuring of the economy since the Romanian Revolution of 1989 has led to a decrease in production and supply for the region, including Petrila. 

It was the site in recent times of the Petrila Mine disaster, wherein two methane gas explosions in a coal mine on November 15, 2008 killed at least 12 miners and/or rescue workers. This is not the first time this millennium a coal mine in Petrila has suffered such an incident; another similar incident occurred in 2001.

==Economy==
The mining in the town began in 1840 and the peak production of coal was in 1984 1,255,240 tonnes, since then it decreased to 504,000 tonnes.

==Population==
At the 2011 census, Petrila had a population of 21,373; of these, 93.97% were Romanians, 4.9% Hungarians, and 0.73% Roma. At the 2021 census, the town had a population of 19,600.

<text>Linaceae is a family of flowering plants. The family is cosmopolitan, and includes about 250 species in 14 genera, classified into two subfamilies: the Linoideae and Hugonioideae (often recognized as a distinct family, the Hugoniaceae). Leaves of the Linaceae are always simple; arrangement varies from alternate (most species) to opposite (in &quot;Sclerolinon&quot; and some &quot;Linum&quot;) or whorled (in some &quot;Hesperolinon&quot; and &quot;Linum&quot; species). The hermaphroditic, actinomorphic flowers are pentameric or, very rarely, tetrameric (e.g., &quot;Radiola linoides&quot;, &quot;Linum keniense&quot;).

In the Linoideae, the largest genus is &quot;Linum&quot;, the flaxes, with 180–200 species including the cultivated flax, &quot;Linum usitatissimum&quot;. Members of the Linoideae include herbaceous annuals and perennials, as well as woody subshrubs, shrubs, and small trees (&quot;Tirpitzia&quot;) inhabiting temperate and tropical latitudes of Eurasia, Africa, Australia, and the Americas. The largest genus of the Hugonioideae is &quot;Hugonia&quot; (about 40 species); the Hugonioideae are woody vines, shrubs, and trees, and are almost entirely tropical in distribution. In addition to their growth habits and geographic distributions, the Linoideae and Hugonioideae can be differentiated by the number of fertile stamens (five in the Linoideae, 10 in the Hugonioideae) and fruit type (capsules in the Linoideae, fleshy drupe-like fruits in the Hugonioideae).

Genera in subfamily Linoideae
*&quot;Anisadenia&quot; Wall. ex Meisn. (2 sp.)
*&quot;Hesperolinon&quot; (Gray) Small (13 sp.)
*&quot;Linum&quot; L. (approximately 200 species)
*&quot;Radiola&quot; Hill (1 sp.)
*&quot;Reinwardtia&quot; Dumort. (1 sp.)
*&quot;Sclerolinon&quot; C.M.Rogers (1 sp.)
*&quot;Tirpitzia&quot; Hallier f. (3 sp.)

Former genera; &quot;Cliococca&quot; (synonym of &quot;Linum&quot; L.)

Genera in subfamily Hugonioideae
*&quot;Hebepetalum&quot; Benth. (3 sp.)
*&quot;Hugonia&quot; l. (6 sp.)
*&quot;Indorouchera&quot; Hallier f. (1 sp.)
*&quot;Roucheria&quot; Planch. (7 sp.)

Former genera; &quot;Durandea&quot; (synonym of Hugonia L.,) and &quot;Philbornea&quot; (synonym of Hugonia L.)

Under the old Cronquist system of classifying the flowering plants, the Linaceae were placed in their own order, the Linales. Modern classifications place them in the order Malpighiales.

<doc id="1269451" wikidata="Q1282831" url="?curid=1269451" title="Túathal Techtmar">
<text>Túathal Techtmar (; &#x27;the legitimate&#x27;), son of Fíachu Finnolach, was a High King of Ireland, according to medieval Irish legend and historical tradition. He is said to be the ancestor of the Uí Néill and Connachta dynasties through his grandson Conn of the Hundred Battles. The name may also have originally referred to an eponymous deity, possibly even a local version of the Gaulish Toutatis.

==Legend==
Túathal was the son of a former High King deposed by an uprising of &quot;subject peoples&quot; who returned at the head of an army to reclaim his father&#x27;s throne. The oldest source for Túathal&#x27;s story, a 9th-century poem by Mael Mura of Othain, says that his father, Fíacha Finnolach, was overthrown by the four provincial kings, Elim mac Conrach of Ulster, Sanb (son of Cet mac Mágach) of Connacht, Foirbre of Munster and Eochaid Ainchenn of Leinster, and that it was Elim who took the High Kingship. During his rule Ireland suffered famine as God punished this rejection of legitimate kingship. Túathal, aided by the brothers Fiacha Cassán and Findmall and their 600 men, marched on Tara and defeated Elim in battle at the hill of Achall. He then won battles against the Ligmuini, the Gailióin, the Fir Bolg, the Fir Domnann, the Ulaid, the Muma, the Fir Ól nÉcmacht and the Érainn, and assembled the Irish nobility at Tara to make them swear allegiance to him and his descendants.

Later versions of the story suppress the involvement of the provincial nobility in the revolt, making the &quot;subject peoples&quot; the peasants of Ireland. The &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot; adds the detail of Túathal&#x27;s exile. His mother, Eithne Imgel, daughter of the king of Alba (originally meaning Britain, later Scotland), was pregnant when Fíachu was overthrown, and fled to her homeland where she gave birth to Túathal. Twenty years later Túathal and his mother returned to Ireland, joined up with Fiacha Cassán and Findmall, and marched on Tara to take the kingship.

The &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot; features a similar revolt a few generations earlier, led by Cairbre Cinnchait, against the High King Crimthann Nia Náir. On this occasion Crimthann&#x27;s son Feradach Finnfechtnach is the future king who escaped in his mother&#x27;s womb, although the Annals claim he returned to reclaim his throne only five years later. The story repeats itself a few generations later with Elim&#x27;s revolt against Fíachu, and the exile and return of Túathal. Geoffrey Keating harmonises the two revolts into one. He has Crimthann hand the throne directly to his son, Feradach, and makes Cairbre Cinnchait, whose ancestry he traces to the Fir Bolg, the leader of the revolt that overthrew Fíachu, killing him at a feast. The pregnant Eithne flees as in the other sources. Cairbre rules for five years, dies of plague and is succeeded by Elim. After Elim had ruled for twenty years, the 20- or 25-year-old Túathal was prevailed upon to return. He landed with his forces at Inber Domnainn (Malahide Bay). Joining up with Fiacha Cassán and Findmall and their marauders, he marched on Tara where he was declared king. Elim gave battle at the hill of Achall near Tara, but was defeated and killed.

Túathal fought 25 battles against Ulster, 25 against Leinster, 25 against Connacht and 35 against Munster. The whole country subdued, he convened a conference at Tara, where he established laws and annexed territory from each of the four provinces to create the central province of &quot;Míde&quot; (Meath) around Tara as the High King&#x27;s territory. He built four fortresses in Meath: Tlachtga, where the druids sacrificed on the eve of Samhain, on land taken from Munster; Uisneach, where the festival of Beltaine was celebrated, on land from Connacht; Tailtiu, where Lughnasadh was celebrated, on land from Ulster; and Tara, on land from Leinster.

He went on to make war on Leinster, burning the stronghold of Aillen (Dún Ailinne) and imposing the &quot;bórama&quot;, a heavy tribute of cattle, on the province. One story says this was because the king of Leinster, Eochaid Ainchenn, had married Túathal&#x27;s daughter Dairine, but told Túathal she had died and so was given his other daughter, Fithir. When Fithir discovered Dairine was still alive she died of shame, and when Dairine saw Fithir dead she died of grief.

Túathal, or his wife Baine, is reputed to have built Ráth Mór, an Iron Age hillfort in the earthwork complex at Clogher, County Tyrone. He died in battle against Mal mac Rochride, king of Ulster, at Mag Line (Moylinny near Larne, County Antrim). His son, Fedlimid Rechtmar, later avenged him.

==Historical context==

===Dates===
The &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot; gives the date of Túathal&#x27;s exile as AD 56, his return as 76 and his death as 106. Geoffrey Keating&#x27;s &quot;Foras Feasa ar Érinn&quot; broadly agrees, dating his exile to 55, his return to 80 and his death to 100. The &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot; places him a little later, synchronising his exile with the reign of the Roman emperor Domitian (81–96), his return early in the reign of Hadrian (122–138) and his death in the reign of Antoninus Pius (138–161).

===The first of the Goidels?===
The scholar T. F. O&#x27;Rahilly suggested that, as in many such &quot;returned exile&quot; stories, Túathal represented an entirely foreign invasion which established a dynasty in Ireland, whose dynastic propagandists fabricated an Irish origin for him to give him some spurious legitimacy. In fact, he proposed that Túathal&#x27;s story, pushed back to the 1st or 2nd century BC, represented the invasion of the Goidels, who established themselves over the earlier populations and introduced the Q-Celtic language that would become Irish, and that their genealogists incorporated all Irish dynasties, Goidelic or otherwise, and their ancestor deities into a pedigree stretching back over a thousand years to the fictitious Míl Espáine.

Professor Dáithí Ó hÓgáin reckoned his Celtic name was Teutovalos (&#x27;tribe-ruler&#x27;) and he was a great leader of the northern branch of the Venii tribe, or the &#x27;people of Condos&#x27; who overthrew the kingship of the Lagini at Tara. When the genealogies were written a few centuries later his name was noted as &#x27;Tuathal&#x27;, and the epithet &quot;teachtmhar&quot;, a Celtic compound meaning &#x27;appropriator of wealth&#x27; was added referring to his followers large-scale raids on the British coast. The Venii&#x27;s special designation for themselves became Gaídhil, i.e. Goidels, and their principal groups were called Connachta and Eoghanacht.

===Romans in Ireland?===
Taking the native dating as broadly accurate, another theory has emerged. The Roman historian Tacitus mentions that Agricola, while governor of Roman Britain (AD 78–84), entertained an exiled Irish prince, thinking to use him as a pretext for a possible conquest of Ireland. Neither Agricola nor his successors ever conquered Ireland, but in recent years archaeology has challenged the belief that the Romans never set foot on the island. Roman and Romano-British artefacts have been found primarily in Leinster, notably a fortified site on the promontory of Drumanagh, fifteen miles north of Dublin, and burials on the nearby island of Lambay, both close to where Túathal is supposed to have landed, and other sites associated with Túathal such as Tara and Clogher. However, whether this is evidence of trade, diplomacy or military activity is a matter of controversy. It is possible that the Romans may have given support to Túathal, or someone like him, to regain his throne in the interests of having a friendly neighbour who could restrain Irish raiding. The 2nd-century Roman poet Juvenal, who may have served in Britain under Agricola, wrote that &quot;arms had been taken beyond the shores of Ireland&quot;, and the coincidence of dates is striking.

<text>National Road 44 (, abbreviated as EO44) is a single carriageway road in central Greece. It connects Thebes with Karystos on southern Euboea, via Chalcis and Eretria. The total length of the GR-44 is nearly 160 km. The highway lies in the regional units of Boeotia and Euboea.

==Route==
The west end of the GR-44 is in downtown Thebes, where it connects with the GR-3. It crosses the A1 motorway east of Thebes, and runs north to Chalcis. At Chalcis it crosses the Euripus Strait, and enters the island of Euboea. The GR-77 towards northern Euboea branches off. The GR-44 continues to the southeastern part of the island, passing along the south coast through the towns Eretria, Amarynthos and Aliveri. Beyond Aliveri it leaves the coast, and it runs south through Styra, ending in Karystos.

National Road 44 passes through the following places:

*Thebes
*Eleonas
*Ritsona
*Chalcis
*Vasiliko
*Eretria
*Amarynthos
*Aliveri
*Zarakes
*Styra
*Karystos</text><links>

<doc id="1269455" wikidata="Q250520" url="?curid=1269455" title="Lochs of Spiggie and Brow">
<text>The Lochs of Spiggie and Brow are located west of Boddam in the parish of Dunrossness, in the South Mainland of Shetland, Scotland, about 6 km north of Sumburgh.

==Environment==
The lochs are designated as a Special Protection Area and a Site of Special Scientific Interest for wildlife conservation purposes. The site has also been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports wintering waterfowl, including whooper swans.

== Loch of Spiggie ==

The Loch of Spiggie was historically a voe (Shetland Dialect: fjord or inlet) in which a sand bar formed, cutting off the sea. It is considered &quot;the only moderately large loch&quot; in the South Mainland of Shetland, and is the fourth longest loch in Shetland. It is roughly rectangular, with the longest dimension approximately north–south, and the maximum width is almost ; its area is roughly 1 km2.

The loch is an RSPB nature reserve. The loch supports many species of birds, including lapwing, tufted duck, redshank, snipe and whooper swan. Additionally, various seasonal visiting birds also make use of the loch – in spring, long-tailed duck and skylark; and in summer, Eurasian oystercatcher, Eurasian curlew, mallard, arctic tern, black-legged kittiwake and great skua. The birds breed in the marshes and farmland next to the loch.

== Loch of Brow ==
The Loch of Brow is a smaller loch, about 0.25 km2 in area, lying to the south-east of the Loch of Spiggie, into which it outflows.

The remains of a broch can be found on a small island in the loch. It used to be accessible by a number of stepping-stones which formed a &quot;rough causeway&quot;; however, these now lie under water. The remnants of a circular hollow approximately in diameter can be seen, which is thought to have been the interior lining of the broch. A small portion of an outward-facing wall was excavated at the north end that suggested the broch&#x27;s walls may have been between thick.

<doc id="1269458" wikidata="Q18995" url="?curid=1269458" title="1997–98 FA Premier League">
<text>The 1997–98 FA Premier League (known as the FA [[Carling]] Premiership for sponsorship reasons) was the sixth season of the FA Premier League. It saw Arsenal lift their first league title since 1991 and, in so doing, became only the second team to win The Double for the second time. 

It was Arsenal&#x27;s first full season under French manager Arsène Wenger, who became the third manager to win the Premier League. Wenger followed in the footsteps of Alex Ferguson and Kenny Dalglish and, while both Ferguson and Dalglish were Scottish, Wenger was the first manager from outside the British Isles to win a league title in England.

==Season summary==
At the end of the 1997–98 FA Premier League season, a record total of nine English teams qualified for European competition.

Premiership champions Arsenal and runners-up Manchester United qualified for the Champions League, while UEFA Cup places went to Liverpool, Leeds United, Aston Villa and Blackburn Rovers. Qualifying for the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup were Chelsea (as defending champions) and FA Cup runners-up Newcastle United. Crystal Palace, while finishing bottom, qualified for the Intertoto Cup.

Manchester United led the table for most of the season, before a dip in form during the final two months of the campaign saw Arsenal overtake them in April, taking advantage of games in hand, and winning the league title with two matches remaining, although the gap between the champions and runners-up was a single point in the final table as Arsenal lost their final two fixtures and Alex Ferguson’s men won both of theirs. Arsenal then completed the double by winning the FA Cup. Despite the sudden dismissal of FA Cup winning player-manager Ruud Gullit, Chelsea won the League Cup and European Cup Winners Cup under new player-manager Gianluca Vialli.

The gap between the Premier League and Division One of the Football League was highlighted at the end of 1997–98 when all three newly promoted teams were relegated. Crystal Palace was confined to bottom place in the final table having won just two home games all season and losing most of their games in the second half of the campaign. Barnsley&#x27;s first season in the top division ended in relegation, although they did reach the FA Cup quarter finals and knock out Manchester United in the Fifth Round. Bolton Wanderers went down on goal difference, with 17th place being occupied by Everton: despite preserving top flight football for the 45th season running, Howard Kendall quit as manager at Goodison Park after his third spell in charge.

Another mark of the gap was that the three relegated teams in the previous season took the top three places in the 1997–98 Football League. Had Sunderland not lost the play-off final to Charlton Athletic on a penalty shootout, the 20 teams from the 1998–99 Premier League would have been exactly the same as those in the 1996–97 Premier League.

==Teams==
Twenty teams are competing in the league – the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the First Division. The promoted teams were Bolton Wanderers (returning after a season&#x27;s absence), Barnsley (playing in the top flight for the first time) and Crystal Palace (playing in the top flight after a two year absence). They replaced Sunderland, Middlesbrough and Nottingham Forest, who were relegated to the First Division after top flight spells of one, two and three years respectively.

==Application Protocol==
The &#x27;APs&#x27; utilize the lower-level information of integrated resources in well defined combinations and configurations to represent a particular data model of an engineering or technical application.
* Part 201 - &quot;Explicit draughting&quot;. Simple 2D drawing geometry related to a product. No association, no assembly hierarchy. Practically a subset of AP202 and 214.
* Part 202 - &quot;Associative draughting&quot;. 2D/3D drawing with association, but no product structure. Practically a subset of AP214.
* Part 203: &quot;Configuration controlled 3D designs of mechanical parts and assemblies&quot;. Mainly used for 3D design and product structure. A subset of AP214 but most widely used.
* Part 204 - &quot;Mechanical design using boundary representation&quot;
* Part 207 - &quot;Sheet metal die planning and design&quot;
* Part 209 - &quot;Composite and metallic structural analysis and related design&quot;
* Part 210 - &quot;Electronic assembly, interconnect and packaging design&quot;. The most complex and sophisticated STEP AP.
* Part 212 - &quot;Electrotechnical design and installation&quot;. Designed as a complement for AP214, but not fully harmonized with it.

==ATS - Abstract test suite==
An ATS is a formal description on how to test STEP implementations for conformance. They contain a test plan for postprocessors (exporting STEP data) and preprocessors (importing STEP data). The structure of an ATS is defined in part 34.

The original plan of STEP was to have for every AP 2xx a corresponding ATS 3xx, but only a few were finally realized till today.

* Part 304 - Abstract test suite: Mechanical design using boundary representation
* Part 307 - Abstract test suite: Sheet metal die planning and design

==AIC - Application interpreted constructs==
AICs are specializations of the integrated application and generic resources. This is done by subtyping interfaced entities and adding further constraints and rules. No new stand-alone entities are created and no new explicit attributes are added. Most AICs are specializations in the geometric area. AICs did not exist back in 1994 when the first release of STEP got published. But when the 2nd generation of APs grows up it becomes clear that APs do not only share not only the IRs but also a lot of specializations. AICs are a big step towards AP interoperability.

* Part 505 - &quot;Drawing structure and administration&quot;
* Part 506 - &quot;Draughting elements&quot;
* Part 507 - &quot;Geometrically bounded surface&quot;
* Part 508 - &quot;Non-manifold surface&quot;
* Part 509 - &quot;Manifold surface&quot;
* Part 510 - &quot;Geometrically bounded wireframe&quot;

<text>Mathmos Limited is a British company that sells lighting products, most famously the lava lamp invented by its founder Edward Craven Walker. It is headquartered in its factory in Poole, Dorset.

==Company history==

The Astro lamp, or lava lamp, was invented around 1963 by Edward Craven Walker. It was adapted from a design for an egg timer spotted in a pub in Dorset, England. Edward and Christine Craven-Walker licensed the product to a number of overseas markets whilst continuing to manufacture for the European market themselves under the original name of the company, Crestworth.
The rights to produce and sell the lamp on the American market for the duration of the patent were sold to Lava Simplex International, in 1966. The American company has now closed the American factory and has the lava lamps made in China.

In Europe Craven-Walker’s original lava lamp designs have been in continuous production since the early 1960s and are still made today by Mathmos in Poole, Dorset, UK. The Mathmos lava lamp formula developed initially by Craven-Walker in the 1960s and then improved with his help in the 1990s is still used.

Lava lamp sales by Mathmos have been through a number of ups and downs. After selling millions of lamps worldwide in the 1960s and 70s, they did not revive until the 1990s. In 1989, Cressida Granger and David Mulley took over the running of Walker&#x27;s original company, Crestworth, situated in Poole, Dorset, and changed the name to Mathmos in 1992.

The name Mathmos comes from the seething lake of energy resembling lava beneath city Sogo in the 1962 comic &quot;Barbarella&quot;.

The 1990s re-launch of the original lava lamps saw sales grow strongly for Mathmos again from 10,000 lamps a year in 1989 to 800,000 lamps a year in 1999. Mathmos won two Queens Awards for Export and a number of other business awards. Edward Craven-Walker remained a consultant and company director at Mathmos until his death in 2000.

==Modern Mathmos==

Since 1999, and under the sole ownership of Cressida Granger, Mathmos widened its product range whilst maintaining and building on the classic Mathmos lava lamp range. Mathmos developed new products both in house with the Mathmos Design Studio and with a number of external designers such as Ross Lovegrove, El Ultimo Grito, Studio Job, and Sabine Marcelis.

New lines include a range of colour changing and rechargeable lights, several of which have won design awards. Mathmos has recently turned its attention back to its classic British made lava lamp range In 2013, it celebrated its 50th anniversary with a limited edition of the classic Astro by Christine Craven Walker, wife and business partner of the inventor. They also showed the biggest lava lamp in the world in London’s Southbank Centre.

In 2016, Mathmos launched Neo, the first lava lamp tested for children and adults, and opened a “Special Projects” division offering giant bespoke lava lamps. The first one is in Selfridges, London as part the new accessories department designed by David Chipperfield.

In 2017 Mathmos launched Neo wall the only wall mounted lava lamp. Mathmos also launched their first limited edition collaboration with Liam Gallagher&#x27;s fashion brand Pretty Green during London Design Week with a window in London’s Carnaby Street.

Mathmos celebrated the centenary of the birth of its founder and the inventor of the lava lamp Edward Craven Walker in 2018. Mathmos lava lamps appeared in a number of exhibitions including Pop &amp; Protest and the Festival of Lights in Berlin that year. Mathmos also launched its second sell-out collaboration with Pretty Green and had a dedicated programme on its British production process as part of ITV&#x27;s Made in Britain series.

A new giant lava lamp iO was launched in 2019 the FIRST100 numbered edition selling out within hours. New candle powered lava lamps Pod and Pod + were also launched. The new lamps were photographed at Second Home co-working space in London Fields and in the iconic Barbican in London.

In 2020 Mathmos teamed with Poole Museum as part of the Light Up Poole event. Showcasing its lava lamps in the windows and throughout the museum. Mathmos moved into a new larger factory in Poole just before lockdown and has stayed open through the Covid-19 pandemic working safely throughout.

<doc id="1269468" wikidata="Q1992653" url="?curid=1269468" title="Goserelin">
<text>Goserelin, sold under the brand name Zoladex among others, is a medication which is used to suppress production of the sex hormones (testosterone and estrogen), particularly in the treatment of breast cancer and prostate cancer. It is an injectable gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist (GnRH agonist).

Structurally, it is a decapeptide. It is the natural GnRH decapeptide with two substitutions to inhibit rapid degradation.

Goserelin stimulates the production of the sex hormones testosterone and estrogen in a non-pulsatile (non-physiological) manner. This causes the disruption of the endogenous hormonal feedback systems, resulting in the down-regulation of testosterone and estrogen production.
It was patented in 1976 and approved for medical use in 1987. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines.

==Medical uses==
Goserelin is used to treat hormone-sensitive cancers of the breast (in pre- and peri-menopausal women) and prostate, and some benign gynaecological disorders (endometriosis, uterine fibroids and endometrial thinning). In addition, goserelin is used in assisted reproduction and in the treatment of precocious puberty. It may also be used in the treatment of male-to-female transgender people.

==Side effects==
Goserelin may cause bone pain, hot flashes, headache, stomach upset, depression, difficulty urinating (isolated cases), weight gain, swelling and tenderness of breasts (infrequent), decreased erections and reduced sexual desire. Bone pain can be managed symptomatically, and erectile dysfunction can be treated by vardenafil (Levitra) or other similar oral therapies, although they will not treat the reduced sexual desire. The rates of gynecomastia with goserelin have been found to range from 1 to 5%.

Short-term memory impairment has also been reported in women and may in some cases be severe, but this effect disappears gradually once treatment is discontinued.&lt;

==Pharmacology==
Goserelin is a synthetic analogue of a naturally occurring gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Bioavailability is almost complete by injection. Goserelin is poorly protein-bound and has a serum elimination half-life of two to four hours in patients with normal renal function. The half-life increases with patients with impaired renal function. There is no significant change in pharmacokinetics in subjects with liver failure. After administration, peak serum concentrations are reached in about two hours. It rapidly binds to the GnRH receptor cells in the pituitary gland thus leading to an initial increase in production of luteinizing hormone and thus leading to an initial increase in the production of corresponding sex hormones. This initial flare may be treated by co-prescribing/co-administering an androgen receptor antagonist such as bicalutamide (Casodex). Eventually, after a period of about 14–21 days, production of LH is greatly reduced due to receptor downregulation, and sex hormones are generally reduced to castrate levels.

==Chemistry==

Goserelin is a GnRH analogue and decapeptide. It is provided as the acetate salt.

<doc id="1269474" wikidata="Q5136915" url="?curid=1269474" title="Clyde Everett Lassen">
<text>Clyde Everett Lassen (March 14, 1942 – April 1, 1994), a native of Fort Myers, Florida, was a Commander in the United States Navy and a Naval Aviator. He initially served over four years as an enlisted sailor, enlisting in September 1961 and eventually achieving the rate of Aviation Electronics Technician 3rd Class (AT3) prior to being selected as a Naval Aviation Cadet (NAVCAD). Upon completion of flight training as a NAVCAD, he received his wings as a Naval Aviator and his commission as an officer in the rank of Ensign.

As a Lieutenant, he was awarded the Medal of Honor for his rescue of two downed Naval Aviators while piloting a search and rescue helicopter in Vietnam.

==The mission==
On June 19, 1968, Lassen, then a 26-year-old Lieutenant, junior grade flying a UH-2A &quot;Seasprite&quot; of HC-7 (assigned to the ), embarked on a mission to recover two downed Naval Aviators (from VF-33, off the ) whose F-4J plane had been shot down on a night interdiction mission deep inside North Vietnam. Upon reaching the hilly terrain where the aviators were hiding, Lassen made several attempts to recover the aviators, but dense tree cover, enemy weapons fire and intermittent illumination frustrated his efforts. Lassen turned on the landing lights of the helicopter, despite the danger of revealing his position to the enemy. After the pilots made their way to the helicopter and with his bullet-riddled helicopter dangerously low on fuel, Lassen evaded further antiaircraft fire before landing safely at sea on board the with only five minutes of fuel left in the helicopter&#x27;s fuel lines. The account of the rescue was logged as a successful, routine search and rescue mission.

LT Lassen became the first Naval Aviator and fifth Navy man to be awarded the Medal of Honor (MOH) for bravery in Southeast Asia (SEA)/Vietnam. He was also only one of three Naval Aviators to be awarded the MOH in SEA (along with CAPT Michael J. Estocin, and RADM James Stockdale), and the only rotary wing Naval Aviator to be awarded the MOH in SEA. 

==Subsequent career==
He remained in the Navy and in the early 1980s served as Commanding Officer of Helicopter Training Squadron EIGHT (HT-8), an advanced rotary-wing training squadron for USN, USMC, USCG, and NATO/Allied student aviators at Naval Air Station Whiting Field, Florida. He retired in 1982 with the rank of Commander, remaining in Pensacola, Florida until his death from cancer in 1994.

==Other recognitions==
In 2001, the destroyer was commissioned and named in his honor. An SH-60 &quot;Seahawk&quot; was painted to commemorate his actions.

In 2010, the Florida Department of Veterans Affairs opened the Clyde E. Lassen State Veterans’ Nursing Home in St. Augustine (St. Johns County), Florida, naming it in CDR Lassen&#x27;s honor. The 120-bed facility offers skilled nursing care and can accommodate 60 residents with dementia/Alzheimer’s disease.

==Awards and decorations==
===Medal of Honor===

 


Citation:

For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty as pilot and aircraft commander of a search and rescue helicopter, attached to Helicopter Support Squadron 7, during operations against enemy forces in North Vietnam. Launched shortly after midnight to attempt the rescue of 2 downed aviators, Lt. (then Lt. (J.G.)) Lassen skillfully piloted his aircraft over unknown and hostile terrain to a steep, tree-covered hill on which the survivors had been located. Although enemy fire was being directed at the helicopter, he initially landed in a clear area near the base of the hill, but, due to the dense undergrowth, the survivors could not reach the helicopter. With the aid of flare illumination, Lt. Lassen successfully accomplished a hover between 2 trees at the survivors&#x27; position. Illumination was abruptly lost as the last of the flares were expended, and the helicopter collided with a tree, commencing a sharp descent. Expertly righting his aircraft and maneuvering clear, Lt. Lassen remained in the area, determined to make another rescue attempt, and encouraged the downed aviators while awaiting resumption of flare illumination. After another unsuccessful, illuminated rescue attempt, and with his fuel dangerously low and his aircraft significantly damaged, he launched again and commenced another approach in the face of the continuing enemy opposition. When flare illumination was again lost, Lt. Lassen, fully aware of the dangers in clearly revealing his position to the enemy, turned on his landing lights and completed the landing. On this attempt, the survivors were able to make their way to the helicopter. En route to the coast he encountered and successfully evaded additional hostile antiaircraft fire and, with fuel for only 5 minutes of flight remaining, landed safely aboard .

<text>Bicalutamide, sold under the brand name Casodex among others, is an antiandrogen medication that is primarily used to treat prostate cancer. It is typically used together with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue or surgical removal of the testicles to treat metastatic prostate cancer (mPC). To a lesser extent, it is used at high doses for locally advanced prostate cancer (LAPC) as a monotherapy without castration. Bicalutamide was also previously used as monotherapy to treat localized prostate cancer (LPC), but authorization for this use was withdrawn following unfavorable trial findings. Besides prostate cancer, bicalutamide is limitedly used in the treatment of excessive hair growth and scalp hair loss in women, as a puberty blocker and component of feminizing hormone therapy for transgender girls and women, to treat gonadotropin-independent early puberty in boys, and to prevent overly long-lasting erections in men. It is taken by mouth.
Common side effects of bicalutamide in men include breast growth, breast tenderness, and hot flashes. Other side effects in men include feminization and sexual dysfunction. Some side effects like breast changes and feminization are minimal when combined with castration. While the medication appears to produce few side effects in women, its use in women is not explicitly approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) at this time. Use during pregnancy may harm the baby. In men with early prostate cancer, bicalutamide monotherapy has been found to increase the likelihood of death from causes other than prostate cancer. Bicalutamide produces abnormal liver changes necessitating discontinuation in around 1% of people. Rarely, it has been associated with cases of serious liver damage, serious lung toxicity, and sensitivity to light. Although the risk of adverse liver changes is small, monitoring of liver function is recommended during treatment.
Bicalutamide is a member of the nonsteroidal antiandrogen (NSAA) group of medications. It works by selectively blocking the androgen receptor (AR), the biological target of the androgen sex hormones testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). It does not lower androgen levels. The medication can have some estrogen-like effects in men when used as a monotherapy due to increased estradiol levels. Bicalutamide is well-absorbed, and its absorption is not affected by food. The elimination half-life of the medication is around one week. It shows peripheral selectivity in animals, but crosses the blood–brain barrier and affects both the body and brain in humans.
Bicalutamide was patented in 1982 and approved for medical use in 1995. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. Bicalutamide is available as a generic medication. The drug is sold in more than 80 countries, including most developed countries. It was at one time the most widely used antiandrogen in the treatment of prostate cancer, with millions of men with the disease having been prescribed it. Although bicalutamide is also used for other indications besides prostate cancer, the vast majority of prescriptions appear to be for treatment of prostate cancer.

==Medical uses==
Bicalutamide is approved for and mainly used in the following indications:

* Metastatic prostate cancer (mPC) in men in combination with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue or surgical castration at 50 mg/day
* Locally advanced prostate cancer (LAPC) in men as a monotherapy at 150 mg/day (not approved for this use in the United States)

In Japan, bicalutamide is uniquely used at a dosage of 80 mg/day both in combination with castration and as a monotherapy in the treatment of prostate cancer.

Bicalutamide is also employed for the following off-label (non-approved) indications:

* To reduce the effects of the testosterone flare at the initiation of agonist therapy in men
* Androgen-dependent skin and hair conditions such as acne, seborrhea, excessive hair growth, and scalp hair loss in women as well as high testosterone levels due to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in women, at 25 to 50 mg/day generally in combination with a birth control pill
* Feminizing hormone therapy for transgender women in combination with an estrogen usually at 50 mg/day
* Peripheral precocious puberty in boys at 12.5 to 100 mg/day in combination with an aromatase inhibitor like anastrozole, especially for familial male-limited precocious puberty (testotoxicosis)
* Overly long-lasting erections in men at 50 mg per week to 50 mg every other day

The medication has been suggested for but has uncertain effectiveness in the following indication:

* Hypersexuality and paraphilias, particularly in combination with chemical castration

For more information on these uses, see the medical uses of bicalutamide article.

===Available forms===

Bicalutamide is available for the treatment of prostate cancer in most developed countries, including over 80 countries worldwide. It is available in 50 mg, 80 mg (in Japan), and 150 mg tablets for oral administration. The drug is registered for use as a 150 mg/day monotherapy for the treatment of in at least 55 countries, with the being a notable exception where it is registered only for use at a dosage of 50 mg/day in combination with castration. No other formulations or routes of administration are available or used. All formulations of bicalutamide are specifically indicated for the treatment of prostate cancer alone or in combination with surgical or medication castration. Due to the low water solubility of bicalutamide, bicalutamide in oral bicalutamide tablets is micronized to ensure small and consistent particle sizes and optimize oral bioavailability.

A combined formulation of bicalutamide and the agonist goserelin in which goserelin is provided as a subcutaneous implant for injection and bicalutamide is included as 50 mg tablets for oral ingestion is marketed in Australia and New Zealand under the brand name ZolaCos CP (Zoladex–Cosudex Combination Pack).

==Contraindications==
Bicalutamide is pregnancy category X, or &quot;contraindicated in pregnancy&quot;, in the , and pregnancy category D, the second most restricted rating, in Australia. As such, it is contraindicated in women during pregnancy, and women who are sexually active and who can or may become pregnant are strongly recommended to take bicalutamide only in combination with adequate contraception. It is unknown whether bicalutamide is excreted in breast milk, but many drugs are excreted in breast milk, and for this reason, bicalutamide treatment is similarly not recommended while breastfeeding.

In individuals with severe, though not mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment, there is evidence that the elimination of bicalutamide is slowed, and hence, caution may be warranted in these patients as circulating levels of bicalutamide may be increased. In severe hepatic impairment, the elimination half-life of the active (&quot;R&quot;)-enantiomer of bicalutamide is increased by about 1.75-fold (76% increase; elimination half-life of 5.9 and 10.4 days for normal and impaired patients, respectively). The elimination half-life of bicalutamide is unchanged in renal impairment.

==Side effects==

The side effect profile of bicalutamide is highly dependent on sex; that is, on whether the person is male or female. In men, due to androgen deprivation, a variety of side effects of varying severity may occur during bicalutamide treatment, with breast pain/tenderness and gynecomastia (breast development/enlargement) being the most common. Gynecomastia occurs in up to 80% of men treated with bicalutamide monotherapy, and is of mild-to-moderate severity in more than 90% of affected men. In addition to breast changes, physical feminization and demasculinization in general, including reduced body hair growth, decreased muscle mass and strength, feminine changes in fat mass and distribution, reduced penile length, and decreased semen/ejaculate volume, may occur in men. Other side effects that have been observed in men and that are similarly related to androgen deprivation include hot flashes, sexual dysfunction (e.g., loss of libido, erectile dysfunction), depression, fatigue, weakness, and anemia. However, most men have preserved sexual function with bicalutamide monotherapy. In females, due to the minimal biological importance of androgens in this sex, the side effects of pure antiandrogens or are few, and bicalutamide has been found to be very well tolerated. However, bicalutamide has been found to increase levels of total and LDL cholesterol in women. The non-pharmacological side-effect profile of bicalutamide (i.e., side effects not related to its antiandrogenic activity) is said to be similar to that with placebo. In any case, general side effects of bicalutamide that might occur in either sex include diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, nausea, dry skin, itching, and rash. The drug is well-tolerated at higher dosages than 50 mg/day, up to 600mg/day, with rare additional side effects.

Bicalutamide has been associated with abnormal liver function tests such as elevated liver enzymes. In the Early Prostate Cancer (EPC) clinical programme of bicalutamide for and , the rate of abnormal liver function tests with bicalutamide monotherapy was 3.4% relative to 1.9% for placebo. However, higher rates, up to 11%, have been seen in other studies. Hepatic changes that have necessitated discontinuation of bicalutamide, such as marked increases in liver enzymes or hepatitis, have occurred in 0.3 to 1.5% of men in clinical trials, or approximately 1% overall. Elevated liver enzymes with bicalutamide usually occur within the first 3 to 6 months of treatment. Monitoring of liver function during treatment is recommended, particularly in the first few months. In men with early prostate cancer, bicalutamide monotherapy has been found to increase non-prostate cancer mortality. The reasons for the increase in mortality with bicalutamide in these men are unknown, but possible factors could include androgen deprivation or drug-related toxicity of bicalutamide.

There are 10 published case reports of liver toxicity associated with bicalutamide as of 2022. Death occurred in 2 of these cases. Hundreds of additional cases of liver complications in people taking bicalutamide exist in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. In all of the published case reports of liver toxicity with bicalutamide, the onset of symptoms was within the first 6 months of treatment. Symptoms that may indicate liver dysfunction include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia, &quot;flu-like&quot; symptoms, dark urine, and jaundice. There are also published case reports of interstitial pneumonitis and eosinophilic lung disease associated with bicalutamide. along with hundreds of additional instances in the FAERS database as well. Interstitial pneumonitis can potentially progress to pulmonary fibrosis and may be fatal. Symptoms that may indicate lung dysfunction include dyspnea (difficult breathing or shortness of breath), cough, and pharyngitis (inflammation of the pharynx, resulting in sore throat). The exact incidence of liver toxicity and interstitial pneumonitis with bicalutamide are unknown, but both are said to be very rare events. A few cases of photosensitivity have been reported with bicalutamide. Hypersensitivity reactions (drug allergy) like angioedema and hives have also uncommonly been reported in association with bicalutamide.

Because it is an antiandrogen, bicalutamide has a theoretical risk of birth defects like ambiguous genitalia in male fetuses. Due to its teratogenic capacity, contraception should be used in women taking bicalutamide who are fertile and sexually active.

===Comparison===
The side effect profile of bicalutamide in men and women differs from that of other antiandrogens and is considered favorable in comparison. Relative to analogues and the steroidal antiandrogen (SAA) cyproterone acetate (CPA), bicalutamide monotherapy has a much lower incidence and severity of hot flashes and sexual dysfunction. In addition, unlike analogues and , bicalutamide monotherapy is not associated with decreased bone mineral density or osteoporosis. Conversely, bicalutamide monotherapy is associated with much higher rates of breast tenderness, gynecomastia, and feminization in men than analogues and . However, gynecomastia with bicalutamide is rarely severe and discontinuation rates due to this side effect are fairly low. These differences in side effects between bicalutamide monotherapy, analogues, and are attributed to the fact that whereas analogues and suppress estrogen production, bicalutamide monotherapy does not lower estrogen levels and in fact actually increases them.

Bicalutamide does not share the risk of neuropsychiatric side effects like fatigue as well as cardiovascular side effects like coagulation changes, blood clots, fluid retention, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and adverse serum lipid changes that has been associated with. It has a much lower risk of hepatotoxicity than flutamide and and of interstitial pneumonitis than nilutamide. The drug also does not share the unique risks of diarrhea with flutamide and nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances, and alcohol intolerance with nilutamide. Unlike enzalutamide, bicalutamide is not associated with seizures or related central side effects like anxiety and insomnia. However, although the risk of adverse liver changes with bicalutamide is low, enzalutamide differs from bicalutamide in having no known risk of elevated liver enzymes or hepatotoxicity. In contrast to the spironolactone, bicalutamide does not have antimineralocorticoid effects, and hence is not associated with hyperkalemia, urinary frequency, dehydration, hypotension, or other related side effects. In women, unlike and spironolactone, bicalutamide does not produce menstrual irregularity or amenorrhea and does not interfere with ovulation or fertility.

==Overdose==
A single oral dose of bicalutamide in humans that results in symptoms of overdose or that is considered to be life-threatening has not been established. Dosages of up to 600 mg/day have been well tolerated in clinical trials, and it is notable that there is a saturation of absorption with bicalutamide such that circulating levels of its active (&quot;R&quot;)-enantiomer do not further increase above a dosage of 300 mg/day. Overdose is considered unlikely to be life-threatening with bicalutamide or other first-generation (i.e., flutamide and nilutamide). A massive overdose of nilutamide (13 grams, or 43 times the normal maximum 300 mg/day clinical dosage) in a 79-year-old man was uneventful, producing no clinical signs, symptoms, or toxicity. There is no specific antidote for bicalutamide or overdose, and treatment should be based on symptoms, if any are present.

==Interactions==
Bicalutamide is almost exclusively metabolized by CYP3A4. As such, its levels in the body may be altered by inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4. (For a list of CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers, see here.) However, in spite of the fact bicalutamide is metabolized by CYP3A4, there is no evidence of clinically significant drug interactions when bicalutamide at a dosage of 150 mg/day or less is co-administered with drugs that inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 enzyme activity.

&quot;In-vitro&quot; studies suggest that bicalutamide may be able to inhibit CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. Conversely, animal studies suggest that bicalutamide may induce cytochrome P450 enzymes. In a clinical study, bicalutamide co-administered with the CYP3A4 substrate midazolam caused only a small and statistically non-significant increase in midazolam levels (+27%) presumably due to CYP3A4 inhibition. However, this was well below increases in midazolam exposure with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors like ketoconazole (+1500%), itraconazole (+1000%), and erythromycin (+350%), and is considered to not be clinically important. There is no indication of clinically significant enzyme inhibition or induction with bicalutamide at doses of 150mg/day or below.

Because bicalutamide circulates at relatively high concentrations and is highly protein-bound, it has the potential to displace other highly protein-bound drugs like warfarin, phenytoin, theophylline, and aspirin from plasma binding proteins. This could, in turn, result in increased free concentrations of such drugs and increased effects and/or side effects, potentially necessitating dosage adjustments. Bicalutamide has specifically been found to displace coumarin anticoagulants like warfarin from their plasma binding proteins (namely albumin) &quot;in vitro&quot;, potentially resulting in an increased anticoagulant effect, and for this reason, close monitoring of prothrombin time and dosage adjustment as necessary is recommended when bicalutamide is used in combination with these drugs. However, in spite of this, no conclusive evidence of an interaction between bicalutamide and other drugs was found in clinical trials of nearly 3,000 patients.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
====Antiandrogenic activity====
Bicalutamide acts as a highly selective competitive silent antagonist of the ( = 159–243 nM), the major biological target of the androgen sex hormones testosterone and , and hence is an antiandrogen. The activity of bicalutamide lies in the (&quot;R&quot;)-isomer. Due to its selectivity for the , bicalutamide does not interact importantly with other steroid hormone receptors and hence has no clinically relevant off-target hormonal activity (e.g., progestogenic, estrogenic, glucocorticoid, antimineralocorticoid). However, it has been reported that bicalutamide has weak affinity for the progesterone receptor (PR), where it is an antagonist, and hence it could have some antiprogestogenic activity. Bicalutamide does not inhibit 5α-reductase nor is known to inhibit other enzymes involved in androgen steroidogenesis (e.g., CYP17A1). Although it does not bind to the estrogen receptors (ERs), bicalutamide can increase estrogen levels secondarily to blockade when used as a monotherapy in males, and hence can have some &quot;indirect&quot; estrogenic effects in males. Bicalutamide neither suppresses nor inhibits androgen production in the body (i.e., it does not act as an antigonadotropin or androgen steroidogenesis inhibitor or lower androgen levels) and hence exclusively mediates its antiandrogenic effects by antagonizing the . In addition to the classical nuclear , bicalutamide has been assessed at the membrane androgen receptors (mARs) and found to act as a potent antagonist of ZIP9 ( = 66.3 nM), whereas it does not appear to interact with GPRC6A.

The affinity of bicalutamide for the is relatively low as it is approximately 30 to 100 times lower than that of , which is 2.5- to 10-fold as potent as an agonist as testosterone in bioassays and is the main endogenous ligand of the receptor in the prostate gland. However, typical clinical dosages of bicalutamide result in circulating levels of the drug that are thousands of times higher than those of testosterone and , allowing it to powerfully prevent them from binding to and activating the receptor. This is especially true in the case of surgical or medical castration, in which testosterone levels in the circulation are approximately 95% reduced and levels in the prostate gland are about 50 to 60% reduced. In women, levels of testosterone are substantially lower (20- to 40-fold) than in men, so much smaller doses of bicalutamide (e.g., 25 mg/day in the hirsutism studies) are necessary.

Blockade of the by bicalutamide in the pituitary gland and hypothalamus results in prevention of the negative feedback of androgens on the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis (HPG axis) in males and consequent disinhibition of pituitary luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion. This, in turn, results in an increase in circulating levels and activation of the gonadal production of testosterone and by extension production of estradiol. Levels of testosterone have been found to increase 1.5- to 2-fold (59–97% increase) and levels of estradiol about 1.5- to 2.5-fold (65–146% increase) in men treated with 150 mg/day bicalutamide monotherapy. In addition to testosterone and estradiol, there are smaller increases in concentrations of , sex hormone-binding globulin, and prolactin. Estradiol levels with bicalutamide monotherapy are similar to those in the low-normal premenopausal female range while testosterone levels generally remain in the high end of the normal male range. Testosterone concentrations do not typically exceed the normal male range due to negative feedback on the axis by the increased concentrations of estradiol. Bicalutamide influences the axis and increases hormone levels only in men and not also in women. This is due to the much lower levels of androgens in women and their lack of basal suppression of the axis in this sex. As evidenced by its effectiveness in the treatment of prostate cancer and other androgen-dependent conditions, the antiandrogenic actions of bicalutamide considerably exceed any impact of the increased levels of testosterone it results in. However, the elevated levels of estradiol remain unopposed by bicalutamide and are responsible for the gynecomastia and feminizing side effects it causes in men. Although bicalutamide monotherapy increases gonadotropin and sex hormone levels in men, this will not occur if bicalutamide is combined with an antigonadotropin such as a analogue, estrogen, or progestogen, as these medications maintain negative feedback on the HPG axis.

 monotherapy, including with bicalutamide, shows a number of tolerability differences from methods of androgen deprivation therapy that incorporate surgical or medical castration. For example, the rates of hot flashes, depression, fatigue, and sexual dysfunction are all much higher with analogues than with monotherapy. It is thought that this is because analogues suppress estrogen production in addition to androgen production, resulting in estrogen deficiency. In contrast, monotherapy does not decrease estrogen levels and in fact increases them, resulting in an excess of estrogens that compensates for androgen deficiency and allows for a preservation of mood, energy, and sexual function. Neurosteroids that are produced from testosterone like 3α-androstanediol and 3β-androstanediol, which are agonists and the former a potent GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator, may also be involved. In the specific case of sexual dysfunction, an additional possibility for the difference is that without concomitant suppression of androgen production, blockade of the by the bicalutamide in the brain is incomplete and insufficient to markedly influence sexual function.

Under normal circumstances, bicalutamide has no capacity to activate the . However, in prostate cancer, mutations and overexpression of the can accumulate in prostate gland cells which can convert bicalutamide from an antagonist of the into an agonist. This can result in paradoxical stimulation of prostate cancer growth with bicalutamide and is responsible for the phenomenon of the antiandrogen withdrawal syndrome, where antiandrogen discontinuation paradoxically slows the rate of prostate cancer growth.

In transgender women, breast development is a desired effect of antiandrogen or estrogen treatment. Breast development and gynecomastia induced by bicalutamide is thought to be mediated by increased activation of the secondary to blockade of the (resulting in disinhibition of the in breast tissue) and increased levels of estradiol. In addition to fat deposition, connective tissue growth, and ductal development, bicalutamide has been found to produce moderate lobuloalveolar development of the breasts. However, full lobuloalveolar maturation necessary for lactation and breastfeeding will not occur without progestogen treatment.

Bicalutamide monotherapy seems to have minimal effect on testicular spermatogenesis, testicular ultrastructure, and certain aspects of male fertility. This seems to be because testosterone levels in the testes (where ~95% of testosterone in males is produced) are extremely high (up to 200-fold higher than circulating levels) and only a small fraction (less than 10%) of the normal levels of testosterone in the testes are actually necessary to maintain spermatogenesis. As a result, bicalutamide appears to not be able to compete with testosterone in this sole part of the body to an extent sufficient to considerably interfere with androgen signaling and function. However, while bicalutamide does not seem to be able to adversely influence testicular spermatogenesis, it may interfere with -dependent sperm maturation and transport outside of the testes in the epididymides and vas deferens where androgen levels are far lower, and hence may still be able to impair male fertility. In addition, the combination of bicalutamide with other medications, such as estrogens, progestogens, and analogues, can compromise spermatogenesis due to their own adverse effects on male fertility. These medications are able to strongly suppress gonadal androgen production, which can severely impair or abolish testicular spermatogenesis, and estrogens also appear to have direct and potentially long-lasting cytotoxic effects in the testes at sufficiently high concentrations.

====Other activities====
Bicalutamide has been found to act as an inhibitor or inducer of certain cytochrome P450 enzymes including CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 in preclinical research, but no evidence of this has been found in humans treated with up to 150 mg/day. It has also been identified &quot;in vitro&quot; as a strong inhibitor of CYP27A1 (cholesterol 27-hydroxylase) and as an inhibitor of CYP46A1 (cholesterol 24-hydroxylase), but this has yet to be assessed or confirmed &quot;in vivo&quot; or in humans and the clinical significance remains unknown. Bicalutamide has been found to be a P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) inhibitor. Like other first-generation and enzalutamide, it has been found to act as a weak non-competitive inhibitor of GABAA receptor-mediated currents &quot;in vitro&quot; ( = 5.2 μM). However, unlike enzalutamide, bicalutamide has not been found to be associated with seizures or other related adverse central effects, so the clinical relevance of this finding is uncertain.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Though its absolute bioavailability in humans is unknown, bicalutamide is known to be extensively and well-absorbed. Its absorption is not affected by food. The absorption of bicalutamide is linear at doses up to 150 mg/day and is saturable at doses above this, with no further increases in steady-state levels of bicalutamide occurring at doses above 300 mg/day. Whereas absorption of (&quot;R&quot;)-bicalutamide is slow, with levels peaking at 31 to 39 hours after a dose, (&quot;S&quot;)-bicalutamide is much more rapidly absorbed. Steady-state concentrations of the drug are reached after 4 to 12 weeks of treatment independently of dosage, with a 10- to 20-fold progressive accumulation in levels of (&quot;R&quot;)-bicalutamide. The long time to steady-state levels is the result of bicalutamide&#x27;s very long elimination half-life. There is wide interindividual variability in (&quot;R&quot;)-bicalutamide levels (up to 16-fold) with bicalutamide regardless of dosage.

The tissue distribution of bicalutamide is not well-characterized. The amount of bicalutamide in semen that could potentially be transferred to a female partner during sexual intercourse is low and is not thought to be important. Based on animal studies with rats and dogs it was thought that bicalutamide could not cross the blood–brain barrier and hence could not enter the brain. As such, it was initially thought to be a peripherally selective antiandrogen. However, subsequent clinical studies found that this was not also the case for humans, indicating species differences; bicalutamide crosses into the human brain and, in accordance, produces effects and side effects consistent with central antiandrogenic action. In any case, there is indication that bicalutamide might have at least some peripheral selectivity in humans. Bicalutamide is highly plasma protein bound (96.1% for racemic bicalutamide, 99.6% for (&quot;R&quot;)-bicalutamide) and is bound mainly to albumin, with negligible binding to and corticosteroid-binding globulin.

Bicalutamide is metabolized in the liver. (&quot;R&quot;)-Bicalutamide is metabolized slowly and almost exclusively via hydroxylation by CYP3A4 into (&quot;R&quot;)-hydroxybicalutamide. This metabolite is then glucuronidated by UGT1A9. In contrast to (&quot;R&quot;)-bicalutamide, (&quot;S&quot;)-bicalutamide is metabolized rapidly and mainly by glucuronidation (without hydroxylation). None of the metabolites of bicalutamide are known to be active and levels of the metabolites are low in plasma, where unchanged biclautamide predominates. Due to the stereoselective metabolism of bicalutamide, (&quot;R&quot;)-bicalutamide has a far longer terminal half-life than (&quot;S&quot;)-bicalutamide and its levels are about 10- to 20-fold higher in comparison following a single dose and 100-fold higher at steady-state. (&quot;R&quot;)-Bicalutamide has a relatively long elimination half-life of 5.8 days with a single dose and 7 to 10 days following repeated administration.

Bicalutamide is eliminated in similar proportions in feces (43%) and urine (34%), while its metabolites are eliminated roughly equally in urine and bile. The drug is excreted to a substantial extent in unmetabolized form, and both bicalutamide and its metabolites are eliminated mainly as glucuronide conjugates. The glucuronide conjugates of bicalutamide and its metabolites are eliminated from the circulation rapidly, unlike unconjugated bicalutamide.

The pharmacokinetics of bicalutamide are not affected by consumption of food, a person&#x27;s age or body weight, renal impairment, or mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment. However, steady-state levels of bicalutamide are higher in Japanese individuals than in white people.
==Chemistry==
Bicalutamide is a racemic mixture consisting of equal proportions of enantiomers (&quot;R&quot;)-bicalutamide (dextrorotatory) and (&quot;S&quot;)-bicalutamide (levorotatory). Its systematic name () is (&quot;RS&quot;)-&quot;N&quot;-[4-cyano-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-3-[(4-fluorophenyl)sulfonyl]-2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanamide. The compound has a chemical formula of C18H14F4N2O4S, a molecular weight of 430.373 g/mol, and is a fine white to off-white powder.

The acid dissociation constant (pKa&#x27;) of bicalutamide is approximately 12. It is a highly lipophilic compound (log P = 2.92). At 37 °C (98.6 °F), or normal human body temperature, bicalutamide is practically insoluble in water (4.6 mg/L), acid (4.6 mg/L at pH 1), and alkali (3.7 mg/L at pH 8). In organic solvents, it is slightly soluble in chloroform and absolute ethanol, sparingly soluble in methanol, and freely soluble in acetone and tetrahydrofuran.

Bicalutamide is a synthetic and nonsteroidal compound which was derived from flutamide. It is a bicyclic compound (has two rings) and can be classified as and has variously been referred to as an anilide (&quot;N&quot;-phenylamide) or aniline, a diarylpropionamide, and a toluidide.

===Analogues===
First-generation including bicalutamide, flutamide, and nilutamide are all synthetic, nonsteroidal anilide derivatives and structural analogues of each other. Bicalutamide is a diarylpropionamide while flutamide is a monoarylpropionamide and nilutamide is a hydantoin. Bicalutamide and flutamide, though not nilutamide, can also be classified as toluidides. All three of the compounds share a common 3-trifluoromethylaniline moiety. Bicalutamide is a modification of flutamide in which a 4-fluorophenylsulfonyl moiety has been added and the nitro group on the original phenyl ring has been replaced with a cyano group. Topilutamide, also known as fluridil, is another that is closely related structurally to the first-generation , but, in contrast to them, is not used in the treatment of prostate cancer and is instead used exclusively as a topical antiandrogen in the treatment of pattern hair loss.

The second-generation enzalutamide and apalutamide were derived from and are analogues of the first-generation , while another second-generation , darolutamide, is said to be structurally distinct and chemically unrelated to the other . Enzalutamide is a modification of bicalutamide in which the inter-ring linking chain has been altered and cyclized into a 5,5-dimethyl-4-oxo-2-thioxo imidazolidine moiety. In apalutamide, the 5,5-dimethyl groups of the imidazolidine ring of enzalutamide are cyclized to form an accessory cyclobutane ring and one of its phenyl rings is replaced with a pyridine ring.

The first nonsteroidal androgens, the arylpropionamides, were discovered via structural modification of bicalutamide. Unlike bicalutamide (which is purely antiandrogenic), these compounds show tissue-selective androgenic effects and were classified as selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs). Lead of this series included acetothiolutamide, enobosarm (ostarine; S-22), and andarine (acetamidoxolutamide or androxolutamide; S-4). They are very close to bicalutamide structurally, with the key differences being that the linker sulfone of bicalutamide has been replaced with an ether or thioether group to confer agonism of the and the 4-fluoro atom of the pertinent phenyl ring has been substituted with an acetamido or cyano group to eliminate reactivity at the position.

A few radiolabeled derivatives of bicalutamide have been developed for potential use as radiotracers in medical imaging. They include [18F]bicalutamide, 4-[76Br]bromobicalutamide, and [76Br]bromo-thiobicalutamide. The latter two were found to have substantially increased affinity for the relative to that of bicautamide. However, none of these agents have been evaluated in humans.

5&quot;N&quot;-Bicalutamide, or 5-azabicalutamide, is a minor structural modification of bicalutamide which acts as a reversible covalent antagonist of the and has approximately 150-fold higher affinity for the and about 20-fold greater functional inhibition of the relative to bicalutamide. It is among the most potent antagonists to have been developed and is being researched for potential use in the treatment of antiandrogen-resistant prostate cancer.

===Synthesis===
A number of chemical syntheses of bicalutamide have been published in the literature. The procedure of the first published synthesis of bicalutamide can be seen below.
==History==
Bicalutamide as well as all of the other currently marketed were derived from structural modification of flutamide, which itself was originally synthesized as a bacteriostatic agent in 1967 at Schering Plough Corporation and was subsequently and serendipitously found to possess antiandrogenic activity. Bicalutamide was discovered by Tucker and colleagues at Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) in the 1980s and was selected for development from a group of over 2,000 synthesized compounds. It was first patented in 1982 and was first reported in the scientific literature in June 1987.

Bicalutamide was first studied in a phase I clinical trial in 1987 and the results of the first phase II clinical trial in prostate cancer were published in 1990. The pharmaceutical division of was split out into an independent company called Zeneca in 1993, and in April and May 1995, Zeneca (now AstraZeneca, after merging with Astra AB in 1999) began pre-approval marketing of bicalutamide for the treatment of prostate cancer in the . It was first launched in the in May 1995, and was subsequently approved by the on 4 October 1995, for the treatment of prostate cancer at a dosage of 50 mg/day in combination with a analogue.

Following its introduction for use in combination with a analogue, bicalutamide was developed as a monotherapy at a dosage of 150 mg/day for the treatment of prostate cancer, and was approved for this indication in Europe, Canada, and a number of other countries in the late 1990s and early 2000s. This application of bicalutamide was also under review by the in the in 2002, but ultimately was not approved in this country. In Japan, bicalutamide is licensed at a dosage of 80 mg/day alone or in combination with a analogue for prostate cancer. The unique 80 mg dosage of bicalutamide used in Japan was selected for development in this country on the basis of observed pharmacokinetic differences with bicalutamide in Japanese men.

Subsequent to negative findings of bicalutamide monotherapy for in the clinical programme, approval of bicalutamide for use specifically in the treatment of was withdrawn in a number of countries including the (in October or November 2003) and several other European countries and Canada (in August 2003). In addition, the and Canada explicitly recommended against the use of 150 mg/day bicalutamide for this indication. The drug is effective for, remains approved for, and continues to be used in the treatment of and , on the other hand.

The patent protection of bicalutamide expired in the in March 2009 and the drug has subsequently been available as a generic, at greatly reduced cost.

Bicalutamide was the fourth antiandrogen (and the third ) to be introduced for the treatment of prostate cancer, following the in 1973 and the flutamide in 1983 (1989 in the ) and nilutamide in 1989 (1996 in the ). It has been followed by abiraterone acetate in 2011, enzalutamide in 2012, apalutamide in 2018, and darolutamide in 2019, and may also be followed by in-development drugs such as proxalutamide and seviteronel.

==Society and culture==

===Generic names===
&quot;Bicalutamide&quot; is the generic name of the drug in English and French and its , , , , , , and . It is also referred to as &quot;bicalutamidum&quot; in Latin, &quot;bicalutamida&quot; in Spanish and Portuguese, &quot;bicalutamid&quot; in German, and &quot;bikalutamid&quot; in Russian and other Slavic languages. The &quot;bica-&quot; prefix corresponds to the fact that bicalutamide is a &quot;bicyclic&quot; compound, while the &quot;-lutamide&quot; suffix is the standard suffix for . Bicalutamide is also known by its former developmental code name -176,334.

===Brand names===
Bicalutamide is marketed by AstraZeneca in oral tablet form under the brand names Casodex, Cosudex, Calutide, Calumid, and Kalumid in many countries. It is also marketed under the brand names Bicadex, Bical, Bicalox, Bicamide, Bicatlon, Bicusan, Binabic, Bypro, Calutol, and Ormandyl among others in various countries. The drug is sold under a large number of generic trade names such as Apo-Bicalutamide, Bicalutamide Accord, Bicalutamide Actavis, Bicalutamide Bluefish, Bicalutamide Kabi, Bicalutamide Sandoz, and Bicalutamide Teva as well. A combination formulation of bicalutamide and goserelin is marketed by AstraZeneca in Australia and New Zealand under the brand name ZolaCos-CP.

===Cost and generics===
Bicalutamide is off-patent and available as a generic. Unlike bicalutamide, the newer enzalutamide is still on-patent, and for this reason, is considerably more expensive in comparison.

The patent protection of all three of the first-generation has expired and flutamide and bicalutamide are both available as low-cost generics. Nilutamide, on the other hand, has always been a poor third competitor to flutamide and bicalutamide and, in relation to this fact, has not been developed as a generic and is only available as brand name Nilandron, at least in the 

Bicalutamide is considerably less costly than analogues, which, in spite of some having been off-patent many years, have been reported (in 2013) to typically cost –$15,000 per year (or about per month) of treatment.

===Sales and usage===
Sales of bicalutamide (as Casodex) worldwide peaked at US$1.3 billion in 2007, and it has been described as a &quot;billion-dollar-a-year&quot; drug prior to losing its patent protection starting in 2007. In 2014, despite the introduction of abiraterone acetate in 2011 and enzalutamide in 2012, bicalutamide was still the most commonly prescribed drug in the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Moreover, in spite of being off-patent, bicalutamide was said to still generate a few hundred million dollars in sales per year for AstraZeneca. Total worldwide sales of brand name Casodex were approximately US$13.4 billion as of the end of 2018.

Between January 2007 and December 2009 (a period of three years), 1,232,143 prescriptions of bicalutamide were dispensed in the , or about 400,000 prescriptions per year. During that time, bicalutamide accounted for about 87.2% of the market, while flutamide accounted for 10.5% of it and nilutamide for 2.3% of it. Approximately 96% of bicalutamide prescriptions were written for diagnosis codes that clearly indicated neoplasm. About 1,200, or 0.1% of bicalutamide prescriptions were dispensed to pediatric patients (age 0–16).

===Regulation===
Bicalutamide is a prescription drug. It is not specifically a controlled substance in any country and therefore is not an illegal drug. However, the manufacture, sale, distribution, and possession of prescription drugs are all still subject to legal regulation throughout the world.

==Research==
Bicalutamide has been studied in combination with the 5α-reductase inhibitors finasteride and dutasteride in prostate cancer. It has also been studied in combination with raloxifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), for the treatment of prostate cancer. Bicalutamide has been tested for the treatment of -positive /-negative locally advanced and metastatic breast cancer in women in a phase II study for this indication. Enzalutamide is also being investigated for this type of cancer. Bicalutamide has also been studied in a phase II clinical trial for ovarian cancer in women.

Bicalutamide has been studied in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in a 24-week trial of 15 patients at a dosage of 50 mg/day. Prostate volume decreased by 26% in patients taking bicalutamide and urinary irritative symptom scores significantly decreased. Conversely, peak urine flow rates and urine pressure flow examinations were not significantly different between bicalutamide and placebo. The decrease in prostate volume achieved with bicalutamide was comparable to that observed with the 5α-reductase inhibitor finasteride, which is approved for the treatment of BPH. Breast tenderness (93%), gynecomastia (54%), and sexual dysfunction (60%) were all reported as side effects of bicalutamide at the dosage used in the study, although no treatment discontinuations due to adverse effects occurred and sexual functioning was maintained in 75% of patients.

A phase III clinical trial of bicalutamide in combination with an ethinylestradiol-containing combined oral contraceptive for the treatment of severe hirsutism in women with was completed in Italy in 2017 under supervision of the Italian Agency for Drugs (AIFA).

Antiandrogens have been suggested for treating COVID-19 in men and as of May 2020 high-dose bicalutamide is in a phase II clinical trial for this purpose.

==Veterinary use==
Bicalutamide may be used to treat hyperandrogenism and associated benign prostatic hyperplasia secondary to hyperadrenocorticism (caused by excessive adrenal androgens) in male ferrets. However, it has not been formally assessed in controlled studies for this purpose.

<text>Samantha Tamania Anne Cecilia Mumba (born 18 January 1983) is an Irish R&amp;B singer-songwriter, dancer, actress, fashion model and TV presenter. In 2000, at the age of 17, she shot to fame with the release of her debut single &quot;Gotta Tell You&quot;, which reached the top five in Ireland, United Kingdom and the United States. It has since been listed in &quot;Billboard&quot;″s 100 Greatest Choruses of the 21st Century. Her album of the same name was released later that year and reached number four in Ireland and number nine in the UK. She has had seven top five hits in Ireland and six top ten hits in the United Kingdom.

Mumba has also pursued an acting career, making her film debut in the 2002 film &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, as well as appearing in a number of Irish independent films. She returned to music in 2013, and announced plans to release a second album in 2019; however this never came to fruition. Mumba released the singles &quot;Cool&quot; and &quot;Process&quot; in 2020 and further single &quot;The Lie&quot; in 2023.

==Early life and education==
Mumba was born in Dublin, Ireland. Her father, Peter Mumba (died March 2020) was from Zambia and was formerly an aircraft engineer; her mother is Irish.

When Mumba was 15 she was discovered on a Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ–Radio Television Ireland) talent show &quot;Let Me Entertain You&quot; by Irish music executive Louis Walsh (manager of Boyzone and Westlife). Walsh was impressed by her talent and she was signed to Polydor Records.

Mumba subsequently spent several months moving between Denmark, Sweden, UK, and Ireland, where she co-wrote and recorded her debut album, &quot;Gotta Tell You&quot;. She eventually dropped out of school to focus on her music career, explaining that it was becoming difficult to stay in school and work on her music.

==Career==
===1998-2006: &quot;Gotta Tell You&quot; and acting===
Mumba sings contralto. Her first single, &quot;Gotta Tell You&quot;, was released in 2000 and peaked at number one in Ireland and New Zealand, number two in the UK, number three in Australia, and number four in the US, as well as reaching the top twenty in several countries across Europe. &quot;Gotta Tell You&quot; has since been listed in &quot;Billboard&quot;″s 100 Catchiest Choruses of the 21st Century

At the age of 17 Mumba released her debut album, &quot;Gotta Tell You&quot;, in late 2000. The album reached the top ten in both Ireland and the UK, and number 67 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Following the success of &quot;Gotta Tell You&quot;, she was chosen to play Mara in &quot;The Time Machine&quot;. Directed by Simon Wells, H.G.Wells&#x27; great-grandson, Samantha co-starred with Guy Pearce and her real-life brother, Omero. At the Teen Choice Awards in 2001 and 2002, she was nominated for Choice Music: Best Breakout Artist and Choice Movie: Best Breakout Actress for the film &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, respectively.

Mumba and fellow teen star Aaron Carter performed a concert at Disney MGM Studios for the Disney Channel titled &quot;Aaron Carter and Samantha Mumba in Concert&quot;, which was then released on DVD. A year later, she and Carter also appeared on an episode of &quot;All That&quot;.

In 2001, Mumba contributed to the track &quot;You Raise Me Up&quot; by the Celtic Tenors. An EP titled &quot;Samantha Sings Christmas&quot; was released at Christmas 2001, which included covers of &quot;White Christmas&quot; and &quot;All I Want for Christmas Is You&quot;. &quot;Samantha Sings Christmas&quot; was also included as a bonus disc on some editions of &quot;Gotta Tell You&quot;.

In 2002, Mumba released a new single &quot;I&#x27;m Right Here&quot;. The video features Damian Marley, son of Bob Marley. The single became Mumba&#x27;s fifth UK and Irish top five single. Rumours circulated that Mumba was getting ready to release a second album, &quot;Woman&quot; and that due to the poor sales of the lead single &quot;I&#x27;m Right Here&quot; in the US and a short lived time on the UK chart, she was dropped from her label. However, Mumba has since confirmed she was unable to release any new material anyway, due to contract restrictions following the restructure of Polydor Records, which resulted in her being dropped. In 2007, she stated on the &quot;Late Late Show&quot; that there never was a second album, and the tracks leaked on the internet were attempts by her to find a new sound.

Mumba&#x27;s second venture into films was in 2003, where she appeared in the film &quot;Spin the Bottle&quot;. In October 2006, a compilation album, &quot;The Collection&quot;, was released. The album features songs from &quot;Gotta Tell You&quot;, B-sides and two new tracks including her single &quot;I&#x27;m Right Here&quot;.

===2013-2019: &quot;The Hit&quot; and festivals===
In June 2013, Mumba confirmed her musical comeback on Twitter. On 16 August 2013 she appeared on the RTÉ television show &quot;The Hit&quot; to compete for a spot in the show&#x27;s final. The song selected for chart battle was &quot;Somebody Like Me&quot; which was released on iTunes immediately afterwards and competed against &quot;Thinking of You&quot; by Irish band Republic of Loose. The song peaked at number five on the Irish Singles Chart, marking her first hit single in 11 years.

On 25 June 2015, Mumba played a gig as part of the Dublin Pride Festival, which was described as &quot;fierce glam altogether&quot;. In early 2017, she participated in a celebrity version of &quot;MasterChef Ireland&quot; and went on to fill in as co-host on &quot;The 6 O&#x27;Clock Show&quot; while Lucy Kennedy took maternity leave. In 2018, she made her comeback onto British television, firstly as a guest and then a panellist on &quot;Loose Women&quot; and has confirmed her return to music, sharing pictures of herself in the studio with the likes of Wanya Morris and MNEK. In January 2019 she confirmed that she hoped to release a second album before the end of the year, but this did not happen.

===2020-present: Singles and &quot;Eurovision&quot;===
On 27 November 2020, Mumba released the single &quot;Cool&quot;, the lead single from her upcoming album, which Mumba has described as &quot;sexy&quot;, &quot;different&quot; and &quot;more adult&quot;. In December 2020, she followed this with the release of single &quot;Process&quot;, a song she had written after the death of her father. 

In May 2023, Mumba performed at Birmingham Pride. In June 2023, Mumba performed at the Mighty Hoopla music festival in London, where she previewed new song &quot;Run Boy Run&quot;; on 3 June 2023, Mumba released the single &quot;The Lie&quot;.

On 22 January 2025, Mumba released the single &quot;My Way&quot;; the song was also chosen to compete on 7 February 2025 in &quot;Eurosong 2025&quot;, Ireland&#x27;s national final to select an entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2025. She finished in 2nd place with 26 points. The following day, Mumba took to social media hitting out at the panelists on &quot;The Late Late Eurosong Special&quot;, saying they were &quot;unnecessarily rude and vile to all the finalists&quot;. In response, RTÉ said they were grateful to the panel for their &quot;professionalism, insight, integrity and good humour&quot;, saying their role was &quot;to give their honest reaction to the performances&quot;, adding it was &quot;in line with the public vote that ultimately made the decision&quot;. Former &quot;Eurosong&quot; contestant Donal Skehan, who was on the &quot;Eurosong 2025&quot; panel, rejected Mumba&#x27;s criticism, saying he stood by his role and the feedback he gave, describing her remarks as &quot;completely unprofessional&quot; and adding &quot;tearing others down is never a good look&quot;.

==Modelling==
Shortly after the success of &quot;Gotta Tell You&quot;, Mumba became the face of Reebok appearing in print advertising in the UK and Ireland for the Quest range.

Around the same time, Mumba was also seen as the face of the fashion designer Louise Kennedy&#x27;s spring/summer collection.

In 2004, she was chosen to model the World&#x27;s Most Expensive Dress. A £5m diamond cobweb dress, created by Scott Henshall, which was showcased at the London premiere for &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;.

Shortly after, she became the face of Dior ambassador and launched the Dior Watch Collection in Ireland.

In 2005, Mumba modelled for the Ultimo Per Amore range, available exclusively at the Irish main-street chain Dunnes Stores.

==Personal life==
Mumba dated R&amp;B singer Sisqó from 2004 to 2005.

Mumba became engaged to Los Angeles police officer Torray Scales in June 2011. The couple married in Los Angeles on 24 February 2012. In September 2014, she announced that she was pregnant with her first child. In February 2015, she escaped uninjured from a three car pile-up in Los Angeles just weeks before her due date. On 3 March 2015, she gave birth to a baby daughter, whom Mumba and her husband named Sage.

<doc id="1269511" wikidata="Q949200" url="?curid=1269511" title="King colobus">
<text>The king colobus (Colobus polykomos), also known as the western black-and-white colobus, is a species of Old World monkey, found in lowland and mountain rainforests in a region stretching from Senegal, through Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia to the Ivory Coast. One of five members of the genus &quot;Colobus&quot;, the black-and-white colobuses, the king colobus is the westernmost species of the group on the continent of Africa. It eats mainly leaves, but also fruits and flowers. Though it is arboreal, it eats primarily on the ground. It lives in small groups consisting of 3 to 4 females and 1 to 3 males, plus their young. These groups maintain distance from one another through territorial calling.

==Etymology==
The word &quot; &#x27;Colobus&#x27; &quot; comes from the Greek word for &#x27;mutilated&#x27;, as all colobus monkeys only have a short stump where the thumb would be.
The word &quot; &#x27;poly&#x27; &quot; comes from the Greek word for &#x27;many.&#x27; The word &quot; &#x27;komos&#x27; &quot; comes from the Greek celebration of unrestrained singing. A possible subspecies known as &quot;C. p. dollmani&quot; can be found but is most likely a hybrid with &quot;C. vellerosus&quot;.

==Characteristics==
The male king colobus grows to a head-and-body length of , with a tail of between . The female is slightly smaller. Males weigh an average of and females weigh an average of .

The body is black, the limbs and fingers are long and the tail is white. There is a fringe of silvery hair around the face as well as long white &quot;epaulettes&quot; on its shoulders. The king colobus can be distinguished from other members of the &quot;Colobus&quot; genus by the placement of its white markings. The king colobus has white only on its whiskers, chest, and tail, and its tail is not covered by a tuft.

==Distribution and habitat==

The king colobus monkey is found in lowland and montane tropical rainforests. The region in which they inhabit is limited to a small range on the Ivory Coast up to Gambia. They can also be found in Senegal, through Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia.
Much of the habitat of the king colobus has been destroyed by humans for farming and secondary forests have begun to fill in this area. The forest habitats experiences significant dry seasons and two rainfall peaks. This area is dominated by leguminous trees.

==Behaviour and ecology==

Diet consists mainly of arboreal leaves, but includes fruit and flowers depending on the season. It can be found foraging on the ground and typically stays within a foraging path of approximately .

It lives in small groups of less than 4 females and 1 to 3 males. Unlike males, females interact closely: males rarely interact and try to show dominance. Either males or both sexes will disperse from family groups.

The king colobus have an average home range of 22 hectares with some overlap between groups. Groups rarely encounter other groups of the same species but when they do, males engage in aggressive displays. Territorial calling is a common form of aggression but can also be a warning to the group of predators.

King colobus have been shown to live approximately 23.5 years in captivity and possibly around 30 years in the wild.

===Reproduction===
The king colobus live in a single male (polygynous) and multi-male (polygynandrous) mating system. Some groups have shown year round births while others have shown births in relation to the dry seasons. The average gestation period is 175 days and the females produce 1 offspring every 20 months. Both males and females reach sexual maturity at approximately 730 days or 2 years. Females provide the parental care by providing milk, grooming, protection and carry the newborns as they cannot walk immediately.

==Status and conservation==
The king colobus has a moderate-sized range; it used to be a common and widespread species but numbers have declined over the last few decades. The main cause for the decline is hunting which is threatening and fragmenting populations. In the 19th century the king colobus was hunted for its fur. There is also a continuing decline in the quality and quantity of the forested habitat where it lives; it seems to be largely restricted to primary forest and gallery forest, although it sometimes visits secondary forest. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being endangered. Focus has been on managing the habitats to prevent further degradation and habitat destruction that could harm the species. The species is also maintained as part of an EAZA &quot;ex situ&quot; captive breeding programme by several European zoos.

<text>The Bierpinsel (&quot;beer brush,&quot; in English) is the nickname of a 47-meter-high building built in 1976 and located on Schloßstraße in Steglitz, Berlin. The building is noted for its futuristic architecture. The building has been listed as a protected structure since January 2017.

== History ==
The &quot;Steglitz Tower Restaurant,&quot; opened on October 13, 1976, and was in construction between 1972 and 1976, by architects Ralf Schüler and his wife Ursulina Schüler-Witte. The architecture is part of the pop art movement. There had been issues with the funding of the initial construction of the building, and it ran over budget more than once.

The building was an extension of the Joachim Tiburtius Bridge. The tower was created out of concrete, plastic cladding and paint. The exterior of the building was originally red around the top section.

The building&#x27;s popular name, &quot;,&quot; (&quot;beer brush&quot;) is a Berlinism coined during the construction period, related to the brush-like appearance of the building&#x27;s vertical steel girders and its planned gastronomic purpose. A later owner took over the name officially in the company name &quot;.

The building was sold in 2007 to a new owner who founded a company called &quot; (literally Castle Tower Ltd). That company was sold to the Immoma group in 2021.

The Immoma group wants to refurbish the building beginning in 2023.

==Turmkunst 2010==
Starting April 2010, several prominent graffiti artists painted the exterior of the structure over several weeks, as part of the Turmkunst 2010 (English: &quot;Tower Art 2010&quot;) project - an exhibition of street-art taking place both in and around the tower.

<doc id="1269530" wikidata="Q3973499" url="?curid=1269530" title="Mugby Junction">
<text>&quot;Mugby Junction&quot; is a set of short stories written in 1866 by Charles Dickens and collaborators Charles Collins, Amelia B. Edwards, Andrew Halliday, and Hesba Stretton. It was first published in a Christmas edition of the magazine &quot;All the Year Round&quot;. Dickens penned a majority of the issue, including the frame narrative in which &quot;the Gentleman for Nowhere,&quot; who has spent his life cloistered in the firm Barbox Brothers &amp; Co., makes use of his new-found freedom in retirement to explore the rail lines that connect with Mugby Junction. Dickens&#x27;s collaborators each contributed an individual story to the collection.
==Overview==
&quot;Mugby Junction&quot; includes the famous ghost story &quot;The Signal-Man&quot; concerning a spectre seen beside a tunnel entrance. The signal-man of the title tells the narrator of a ghost that has been haunting him. Each spectral appearance precedes, and is a harbinger of, a tragic event on the railway on which the signalman works. The signalman&#x27;s work is at a signalbox in a deep cutting near a tunnel entrance on a lonely stretch of the line, and he controls the movements of passing trains. When there is danger, his fellow signalmen alert him via telegraph and alarms. Three times, he receives phantom warnings of danger when his bell rings in a fashion that only he can hear. Each warning is followed by the appearance of the spectre, and then by a terrible accident.

The first accident involves a terrible collision between two trains in the tunnel. Dickens may have based this incident on the Clayton Tunnel rail crash that occurred in 1861, five years before he wrote the story. Readers in 1866 would have been familiar with this major disaster. The second warning involves the mysterious death of a young woman on a passing train. The final warning is a premonition of the signalman&#x27;s own death.

Another story features, in a thinly disguised form, the town of Rugby in Warwickshire and the town&#x27;s railway station. This was inspired by an incident in April 1866, when Charles Dickens was travelling from London to Liverpool. Dickens&#x27;s train made an unscheduled stop at Rugby due to one of the carriages catching fire. While waiting for his journey to resume, he went into the refreshment room for a cup of coffee, and the proprietess, clearly not recognising the celebrity author, treated him rudely. Inspired by this, in chapter three of &#x27;Mugby Junction&#x27; he made a scathing attack on railway refreshment rooms and their staff.

<text>Helmut Herbert Christian Heinrich Knochen (March 14, 1910 – April 4, 2003) was the senior commander of the Sicherheitspolizei (Security Police) and Sicherheitsdienst in Paris during the Nazi occupation of France in World War II. He was sentenced to death first by a British military court in 1947, and then a French military court in 1954. After his sentences were commuted and reduced a few times, he was pardoned by President Charles de Gaulle and released in 1962.

== Early life ==
He was born in Magdeburg, Germany. Before joining the Nazi Party in 1932, he worked as a teacher and editor.

== Nazi career ==
Knochen joined the SS in 1936 and became involved in the SD. By 1940, he was the senior commander of security in Paris. In 1942, the jurisdiction under his control stretched from northern France to Belgium and he was promoted to the rank of Standartenführer. Knochen was involved in deporting French Jews to concentration camps and was responsible for the execution of thousands of Frenchmen. He was also responsible for the arrest and torture of SOE agents.

During the plot to assassinate Hitler of July 20, 1944, together with the top security man in Paris, SS-Gruppenführer Carl Oberg, he was arrested by Army troops under the command of Paris military governor, General Carl-Heinrich von Stülpnagel. He was released after the coup collapsed. Following the liberation of Paris, Knochen was transferred to the 1st SS Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler and he was degraded to the rank of SS-Grenadier.

== Post-war trials, sentences, and reprieve ==
In March 1947, a British Military Court sentenced Knochen, alongside Hans Kieffer, to death for the murder of a number of British parachute troops on or around 9 August 1944. However, in 1947, he was extradited to France. There, in 1954, he was sentenced to death. The sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment. After he obtained a presidential pardon in 1958, Knochen was released on November 28, 1962, by President Charles de Gaulle, simultaneously with his former chief Carl Oberg. Back in Germany, he retired to Baden-Baden and died a free man in 2003.

<text>Muckross Abbey (Irish: &quot;Mainistir Locha Léin&quot; and &quot;Mainistir Mhucrois&quot;) is one of the major ecclesiastical sites found in the Killarney National Park, County Kerry, Ireland. It was founded in 1448 as a Franciscan friary for the Observantine Franciscans by Donal McCarthy Mor. 

It has had a violent history and has been damaged and reconstructed many times. The friars were often subjected to raids by marauding groups and were persecuted by Cromwellian forces under Lord Ludlow. Today the abbey is largely roofless, but is otherwise generally quite well-preserved. Its most striking feature is a central courtyard, which contains a large yew tree and is surrounded by a vaulted cloister.

In the 17th and 18th centuries, it became the burial place for prominent County Kerry poets O&#x27;Donoghue, Ó Rathaille and Ó Súilleabháin, while Piaras Feiritéar is buried in the graveyard just outside.

<text>Codlea (; ; Transylvanian Saxon dialect: &quot;Zäöeden&quot;; ) is a city in Brașov County, Transylvania, Romania.

==Name==
The Romanian name &quot;Codlea&quot; could be a derivation from the Latin , a diminutive of Latin (edge, rearward); or it could be a derivation from the Slavic &quot;kotlík&quot; (&quot;kettle&quot;), as the &quot;Măgura Codlei&quot; (in this reading: &quot;Kettle Hill&quot;) looks like a kettle. In Romanian, &quot;măgură&quot; means &quot;large hill, mound, forest located on a high place&quot;.

The hill also provides the Hungarian name of the city, &quot;Feketehegy&quot;, &quot;Black Hill&quot;.

The German name&#x27;s origin is unknown, but there is a theory that it was derived from &quot;Zeidler&quot;, an antiquated word for &quot;beekeeper&quot;.

==History==

During the 13th century, the Teutonic Order built a fortress known as &quot;Schwarzburg&quot; (&quot;black castle&quot;) near the &quot;Măgura Codlei&quot;. The castle&#x27;s name was first noted in 1265 and was rebuilt for the last time in 1432 by the craftsmen&#x27;s guild that worked in the town. The city of Codlea is believed to have been also founded by Germans. The fortified church in the city is the largest in the Burzenland historic region.
Codlea was well known for its flowers and was called the city of flowers.

==Climate==
Codlea has a warm-summer humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot; in the Köppen climate classification).

<doc id="1269557" wikidata="Q412178" url="?curid=1269557" title="Tamoxifen">
<text>Tamoxifen, sold under the brand name Nolvadex among others, is a selective estrogen receptor modulator used to prevent breast cancer in women and men. It is also being studied for other types of cancer. It has been used for Albright syndrome. Tamoxifen is typically taken daily by mouth for five years for breast cancer.
Serious side effects include a small increased risk of uterine cancer, stroke, vision problems, and pulmonary embolism. Common side effects include irregular periods, weight loss, and hot flashes. It may cause harm to the baby if taken during pregnancy or breastfeeding. It is a selective estrogen-receptor modulator (SERM) and works by decreasing the growth of breast cancer cells. It is a member of the triphenylethylene group of compounds.
Tamoxifen was initially made in 1962, by chemist Dora Richardson. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. Tamoxifen is available as a generic medication. In 2020, it was the 317th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 900thousand prescriptions.
==Medical uses==

===Dysmenorrhea===
Dysmenorrhea is the term for menstrual pain, usually centered in the lower abdomen but often spreading to the back and inner thighs. It is a common gynecological condition that can seriously affect daily activities and well-being. Tamoxifen has been identified and used to effectively improve blood flow, reduce uterine contractility and pain in dysmenorrhea patients.

===Breast cancer===
Tamoxifen is used for the treatment of both early and advanced estrogen receptor-positive (ER-positive or ER+) breast cancer in pre- and postmenopausal women. Tamoxifen increases the risk of postmenopausal bleeding, endometrial polyps, hyperplasia, and endometrial cancer; using tamoxifen with an intrauterine system releasing levonorgestrel might increase vaginal bleeding after 1 to 2 years, but reduces somewhat endometrial polyps and hyperplasia, but not necessarily endometrial cancer. Additionally, it is the most common hormone treatment for male breast cancer. It is also approved by the FDA for the prevention of breast cancer in women at high risk of developing the disease. The effectiveness of tamoxifen is primarily influenced by estrogen receptor (ER) status, which was the key predictor of the proportional benefits observed. It has been further approved for the reduction of contralateral (in the opposite breast) cancer. Five years of adjuvant tamoxifen treatment significantly lowers the 15-year risk of breast cancer recurrence and mortality. The overall use of tamoxifen is recommended for 10 years.

In 2006, the large STAR clinical study concluded that raloxifene is also effective in reducing the incidence of breast cancer. Updated results after an average of 6.75 years of follow up found that raloxifene retains 76% of tamoxifen&#x27;s effectiveness in preventing invasive breast cancer, with 45% fewer uterine cancers and 25% fewer blood clots in women taking raloxifene than in women taking tamoxifen.

===Infertility===
Tamoxifen is used for ovulation induction to treat infertility in women with anovulatory disorders. It is given at days three to seven of a woman&#x27;s cycle.

Tamoxifen improves fertility in males with infertility by disinhibiting the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis (HPG axis) via ER antagonism and thereby increasing the secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and increasing testicular testosterone production. Some animal studies have suggested tamoxifen could have negative effects on sperm quality and prostatic and gonadal health.

===Gynecomastia===
Benign enlargement of the male breast, whether asymptomatic or painful, is a common condition thought to result from an increased estrogen/testosterone ratio or from heightened estrogenic or reduced androgenic activity via receptor interactions.Tamoxifen is used to prevent and treat gynecomastia. It is taken as a preventative measure in small doses, or used at the onset of any symptoms such as nipple soreness or sensitivity. Current treatments typically involve pain relief through medication or surgery. However, targeting the underlying estrogenic stimulation may offer a more specific therapeutic approach. In a double-blind crossover study, patients were given either a placebo or tamoxifen (10 mg orally twice daily) for one month, in random order. Seven out of ten patients saw a reduction in gynecomastia size with tamoxifen (P &lt; 0.005), and the overall reduction for the group was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.01). No benefits were observed with the placebo (P &gt; 0.1). Additionally, all four patients with painful gynecomastia experienced relief of their symptoms, and no toxicity was noted. Although the breast size reduction was partial, this suggests that longer treatment may be necessary. Follow-up examinations conducted 9 to 12 months after treatment revealed no significant changes, except in two cases: one tamoxifen responder had a recurrence of breast tenderness after six months, and one non-responder developed increased breast size and new tenderness after ten months. Other medications are taken for similar purposes such as clomifene and aromatase inhibitor drugs; which are used in order to try to avoid the hormone-related adverse effects. Overall, tamoxifen appears to be a safe and effective treatment option for selected cases of gynecomastia.

===Early puberty===
Tamoxifen is useful in the treatment of peripheral precocious puberty, for instance due to McCune–Albright syndrome, in both girls and boys. It has been found to decrease growth velocity and the rate of bone maturation in girls with precocious puberty, and hence to improve final height in these individuals.

===Available forms===
Tamoxifen is available as a tablet or oral solution.

==Contraindications==
Tamoxifen has a number of contraindications, including known hypersensitivity to tamoxifen or other ingredients, individuals taking concomitant coumarin-type anticoagulant therapy, and women with a history of venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism).

==Side effects==
A report in September 2009 from Health and Human Services&#x27; Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality suggests that tamoxifen, raloxifene, and tibolone used to treat breast cancer significantly reduce invasive breast cancer in midlife and older women, but also increase the risk of adverse side effects.

===Endometrial cancer===
Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). Even though it is an antagonist in breast tissue it acts as partial agonist on the endometrium and has been linked to endometrial cancer in some women. Therefore, endometrial changes, including cancer, are among tamoxifen&#x27;s side effects. With time, risk of endometrial cancer may be doubled to quadrupled, which is a reason tamoxifen is typically only used for five years.

The American Cancer Society lists tamoxifen as a known carcinogen, stating that it increases the risk of some types of uterine cancer while lowering the risk of breast cancer recurrence.

===Cardiovascular and metabolic===
Tamoxifen treatment of postmenopausal women is associated with beneficial effects on serum lipid profiles. However, long-term data from clinical trials have failed to demonstrate a cardioprotective effect. For some women, tamoxifen can cause a rapid increase in triglyceride concentration in the blood. In addition, there is an increased risk of thromboembolism especially during and immediately after major surgery or periods of immobility. Use of tamoxifen has been shown to slightly increase risk of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and stroke.

===Liver toxicity===
Tamoxifen has been associated with a number of cases of hepatotoxicity. Several different varieties of hepatotoxicity have been reported. Tamoxifen can also precipitate non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in obese and overweight women (not in normal weight women) at an average rate of 40% after a year use with 20 mg/day.

==Overdose==
Acute overdose of tamoxifen has not been reported in humans. In dose-ranging studies, tamoxifen was administered at very high doses in women (e.g., 300 mg/m2) and was found to produce acute neurotoxicity including tremor, hyperreflexia, unsteady gait, and dizziness. These symptoms occurred within three to five days of therapy and disappeared within two to five days of discontinuation of therapy. No indications of permanent neurotoxicity were observed. QT prolongation was also observed with very high doses of tamoxifen. There is no specific antidote for overdose of tamoxifen. Instead, treatment should be based on symptoms.

== Interactions ==

Patients with variant forms of the gene CYP2D6 may not receive full benefit from tamoxifen because of too slow metabolism of the tamoxifen prodrug into its active metabolites. On 18 October 2006, the Subcommittee for Clinical Pharmacology recommended relabeling tamoxifen to include information about this gene in the package insert. Certain CYP2D6 variations in breast cancer patients lead to a worse clinical outcome for tamoxifen treatment. Genotyping therefore has the potential for identification of women who have these CYP2D6 phenotypes and for whom the use of tamoxifen is associated with poor outcomes. Recent research has shown that 7–10% of women with breast cancer may not receive the full medical benefit from taking tamoxifen due to their genetic make-up. DNA Drug Safety Testing can examine DNA variations in the CYP2D6 and other important drug processing pathways. More than 20% of all clinically used medications are metabolized by CYP2D6 and knowing the CYP2D6 status of a person can help the doctor with the future selection of medications. Other molecular biomarkers may also be used to select appropriate patients likely to benefit from tamoxifen.

Recent studies suggest that taking the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) antidepressants paroxetine (Paxil), fluoxetine (Prozac), and sertraline (Zoloft) can decrease the effectiveness of tamoxifen, as these drugs compete for the CYP2D6 enzyme which is needed to metabolize tamoxifen into its active forms. A U.S. study presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology&#x27;s annual meeting in 2009 found that after two years, 7.5% of women who took only tamoxifen had a recurrence, compared with 16% who took either paroxetine, fluoxetine or sertraline, drugs considered to be the most potent CYP2D6 inhibitors. That difference translates to a 120% increase in the risk of breast cancer recurrence. Patients taking the SSRIs Celexa (citalopram), Lexapro (escitalopram), and Luvox (fluvoxamine) did not have an increased risk of recurrence, due to their lack of competitive metabolism for the CYP2D6 enzyme. A newer study demonstrated a clearer and stronger effect from paroxetine in causing the worst outcomes. Patients treated with both paroxetine and tamoxifen have a 67% increased risk of death from breast cancer, from 24% to 91%, depending on the duration of coadministration.

Tamoxifen interacts with certain other antiestrogens. The aromatase inhibitor aminoglutethimide induces the metabolism of tamoxifen. Conversely, the aromatase inhibitor letrozole does not affect the metabolism of tamoxifen. However, tamoxifen induces the metabolism of letrozole and significantly reduces its concentrations.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===

====Selective estrogen receptor modulator activity====
Tamoxifen acts as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), or as a partial agonist of the estrogen receptors (ERs). It has mixed estrogenic and antiestrogenic activity, with its profile of effects differing by tissue. For instance, tamoxifen has predominantly antiestrogenic effects in the breasts but predominantly estrogenic effects in the uterus and liver. In breast tissue, tamoxifen acts as an ER antagonist so that transcription of estrogen-responsive genes is inhibited. A beneficial side effect of tamoxifen is that it prevents bone loss by acting as an ER agonist (i.e., mimicking the effects of estrogen) in this cell type. Therefore, by inhibiting osteoclasts, it prevents osteoporosis. When tamoxifen was launched as a drug, it was thought that tamoxifen would act as an ER antagonist in all tissues, including bone, and therefore it was feared that it would contribute to osteoporosis. It was therefore very surprising that the opposite effect was observed clinically. Hence tamoxifen&#x27;s tissue selective action directly led to the formulation of the concept of SERMs.

Tamoxifen is a long-acting SERM, with a nuclear retention of the ER–tamoxifen (or metabolite) complex of greater than 48 hours. It has relatively little affinity for the ERs itself and instead acts as a prodrug of active metabolites such as endoxifen (4-hydroxy-&quot;N&quot;-desmethyltamoxifen) and afimoxifene (4-hydroxytamoxifen; 4-OHT). These metabolites have approximately 30 to 100 times greater affinity for the ERs than tamoxifen itself. Per one study, tamoxifen had 7% and 6% of the affinity of estradiol for the ERα and ERβ, respectively, whereas afimoxifene had 178% and 338% of the affinity of estradiol for the ERα and ERβ, respectively. Hence, afimoxifene showed 25-fold higher affinity for the ERα and 56-fold higher affinity for the ERβ than tamoxifen. The antiestrogenic potencies of endoxifen and afimoxifene are very similar. However, endoxifen occurs in much higher concentrations than afimoxifene and is now thought to be the major active form of tamoxifen in the body.

Tamoxifen binds to ER competitively (with respect to the endogenous agonist estrogen) in tumor cells and other tissue targets, producing a nuclear complex that decreases DNA synthesis and inhibits estrogen effects. It is a nonsteroidal agent with potent antiestrogenic properties which compete with estrogen for binding sites in breast and other tissues. Tamoxifen causes cells to remain in the G0 and G1 phases of the cell cycle. Because it prevents (pre)cancerous cells from dividing but does not cause cell death, tamoxifen is cytostatic rather than cytocidal. Tamoxifen binds to ER, the ER/tamoxifen complex recruits other proteins known as co-repressors, and the complex then binds to DNA to modulate gene expression. Some of these proteins include NCoR and SMRT. Tamoxifen function can be regulated by a number of different variables including growth factors. Tamoxifen needs to block growth factor proteins such as ErbB2/HER2 because high levels of ErbB2 have been shown to occur in tamoxifen resistant cancers. Tamoxifen seems to require a protein PAX2 for its full anticancer effect. In the presence of high PAX2 expression, the tamoxifen/ER complex is able to suppress the expression of the pro-proliferative ERBB2 protein. In contrast, when AIB-1 expression is higher than PAX2, tamoxifen/ER complex upregulates the expression of ERBB2 resulting in stimulation of breast cancer growth.

Tamoxifen is antigonadotropic in postmenopausal women and partially suppresses levels of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in such women. However, it has progonadotropic effects in premenopausal women and increases estrogen levels by 6-fold in them. Due to the nature of tamoxifen as a competitive ER ligand, this increase in estrogen levels is liable to interfere with the antiestrogenic efficacy of tamoxifen. The effects of tamoxifen on breast cancer Ki-67 expression, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels, and IGF-1 levels are dose-dependent across a dosage range of 1 to 20 mg/day in women with breast cancer. Tamoxifen has been found to decrease insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels by 17 to 38% in women and men. Suppression of IGF-1 production in the liver is a well-known action of estrogens and SERMs. A 10 mg/day dosage of tamoxifen is nearly as effective as a 20 mg/day dosage in suppressing IGF-1 levels.

====Other activities====
Afimoxifene is an agonist of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) with relatively low affinity. Its affinity for the receptor is in the range of 100 to 1,000 nM, relative to 3 to 6 nM for estradiol.

In addition to its activity as a SERM, afimoxifene binds to both the estrogen-related receptor β and estrogen-related receptor γ and is an antagonist of the estrogen-related receptor γ (ERRγ).

Norendoxifen (4-hydroxy-&quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-didesmethyltamoxifen), another active metabolite of tamoxifen, has been found to act as a potent competitive aromatase inhibitor (IC50 = 90 nM), and may also be involved in the antiestrogenic activity of tamoxifen.

In addition to its activity as a SERM, tamoxifen is a potent and selective protein kinase C inhibitor, and is active in this regard at therapeutic concentrations. This action is thought to underlie the efficacy of tamoxifen in the treatment of bipolar disorder.

Tamoxifen is an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein.

In 2018, it was discovered that tamoxifen directly interacts with the dopamine transporter (DAT) and acts as an atypical dopamine reuptake inhibitor (DRI). It has weak potency (54% inhibition of dopamine uptake at 10μM) and lacks any stimulant or depressant effects when administered by itself. However, tamoxifen dose-dependently blocks amphetamine-mediated dopamine release and psychostimulant-like effects in animals. This unusual profile of DRI activity has made tamoxifen of potential interest as a starting point for structural modification to develop novel pharmaceutical drugs for treatment of stimulant use disorder.

===Pharmacokinetics===

====Absorption====
Tamoxifen is rapidly and extensively absorbed from the intestines with oral administration. The oral bioavailability of tamoxifen is approximately 100%, which is suggestive of minimal first-pass metabolism in the intestines and liver. Following intake, peak levels of tamoxifen occur after three to seven hours. Steady state levels of tamoxifen are reached typically after 3 to 4 weeks but possibly up to 16 weeks of daily administration. Steady state levels of afimoxifene are achieved after 8 weeks of daily tamoxifen administration. Peak levels of tamoxifen after a single 40 mg oral dose were 65 ng/mL and steady state levels at 20 mg/day were 310 ng/mL. Levels of tamoxifen show clear dose dependency across a dosage range of 1 to 20 mg/day. Endoxifen levels are approximately 5 to 10 times higher than afimoxifene levels, with large interindividual variability. Endoxifen levels have been reported as 10.8 to 15.9 ng/mL at steady state in CYP2D6 normal metabolizers during therapy with 20 mg/day tamoxifen. The most abundant metabolites of tamoxifen in terms of circulating concentrations are &quot;N&quot;-desmethyltamoxifen, &quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-didesmethyltamoxifen, (&quot;Z&quot;)-endoxifen, and tamoxifen &quot;N&quot;-oxide.

====Distribution====
The volume of distribution of tamoxifen is 50 to 60 L/kg and its clearance has been estimated as 1.2 to 5.1 L/hour. High concentrations of tamoxifen have been found in breast, uterus, liver, kidney, lung, pancreas, and ovary tissue in animals and humans. Levels of tamoxifen in the uterus have been found to be 2- to 3-fold higher than in the circulation and in the breasts 10-fold higher than in the circulation. The plasma protein binding of tamoxifen and afimoxifene is greater than 99%. A majority of tamoxifen is bound to albumin. Albumin alone binds 98.8% of tamoxifen while other plasma proteins are not greatly involved.

====Metabolism====
Tamoxifen is a prodrug and is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 isoforms CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 into active metabolites such as endoxifen (4-hydroxy-&quot;N&quot;-desmethyltamoxifen) and afimoxifene (4-hydroxytamoxifen). Conversion of tamoxifen by &quot;N&quot;-demethylation into &quot;N&quot;-desmethyltamoxifen, which is catalyzed primarily by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, is responsible for approximately 92% of tamoxifen metabolism. Conversely, 4-hydroxylation of tamoxifen into afimoxifene is responsible for only about 7% of tamoxifen metabolism. Following its formation, &quot;N&quot;-desmethyltamoxifen is oxidized into several other metabolites, the most notable of which is endoxifen. Another active metabolite, norendoxifen (4-hydroxy-&quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-didesmethyltamoxifen), is formed via &quot;N&quot;-demethylation of endoxifen or 4-hydroxylation of &quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-didesmethyltamoxifen. Tamoxifen and its metabolites undergo conjugation, including glucuronidation and sulfation. Tamoxifen may inhibit its own metabolism.

====Elimination====
Tamoxifen has a long elimination half-life of typically 5 to 7 days, with a range of 4 to 11 days. Similarly, the half-life of afimoxifene is 14 days. Conversely, the half-life of endoxifen is 50 to 70 hours (2–3 days). The long half-lives of tamoxifen and afimoxifene are attributed to their high plasma protein binding as well as to enterohepatic recirculation. Upon discontinuation of treatment, levels of tamoxifen and its metabolites persist in the circulation for at least 6 weeks. Tamoxifen is excreted in bile and is eliminated in feces, while small amounts are eliminated in urine.

==Chemistry==
Tamoxifen is a nonsteroidal SERM of the triphenylethylene family and was structurally derived from diethylstilbestrol-like estrogens and antiestrogens such as chlorotrianisene and ethamoxytriphetol. Initially, clomifene was synthesized, and tamoxifen was developed subsequently. Tamoxifen is closely related structurally to other triphenylethylenes, such as clomifene, nafoxidine, ospemifene, toremifene, and numerous others. Other SERMs, like raloxifene, are structurally distinct from tamoxifen and other triphenylethylenes.

==History==
In the late 1950s, pharmaceutical companies were actively researching a newly discovered class of anti-estrogen compounds in the hope of developing a morning-after contraceptive pill. Arthur L Walpole was a reproductive endocrinologist who led such a team at the Alderley Park research laboratories of ICI Pharmaceuticals. It was there in 1962 that chemist Dora Richardson first synthesized tamoxifen, back then known as ICI-46,474, when she was looking to create triphenylethylene derivatives for the contraceptive pill project that her team was researching.

This compound was originally created to work as an estrogen inhibitor, but instead was found to stimulate ovulation in participants of the drug testing trial. Walpole and his colleagues filed a UK patent covering this compound in 1962, but patent protection on this compound was repeatedly denied in the US until the 1980s. Tamoxifen did eventually receive marketing approval as a fertility treatment, but the class of compounds never proved useful in human contraception. A link between estrogen and breast cancer had been known for many years, but cancer treatments were not a corporate priority at the time, and Walpole&#x27;s personal interests were important in keeping support for the compound alive in the face of this and the lack of patent protection. It was only when Walpole threatened to leave his position that corporate decided to allow trials and testing for tamoxifen as a drug that could be used to treat breast cancer. Without Walpole&#x27;s effort towards defending the work that his team had done in discovering a possibly revolutionary source for breast cancer treatment, tamoxifen could have become a discarded or under-researched idea. Walpole&#x27;s team consisted of Dora Richardson and G. A. Snow, who worked on the chemistry portion of the project, along with G. E. Paget and J. K. Walley, who focused primarily on the biological side.

Tamoxifen is one of three drugs in an anti-angiogenetic protocol developed by Dr. Judah Folkman, a researcher at Children&#x27;s Hospital at Harvard Medical School in Boston. Folkman discovered in the 1970s that angiogenesis – the growth of new blood vessels – plays a significant role in the development of cancer. Since his discovery, an entirely new field of cancer research has developed. Clinical trials on angiogenesis inhibitors have been underway since 1992 using many different drugs. The Harvard researchers developed a specific protocol for a golden retriever named Navy who was cancer-free after receiving the prescribed cocktail of celecoxib, doxycycline, and tamoxifen – the treatment subsequently became known as the Navy Protocol. Furthermore, tamoxifen treatment alone has been shown to have anti-angiogenetic effects in animal models of cancer which appear to be, at least in part, independent of tamoxifen&#x27;s ER antagonist properties.

Other antiestrogens, such as ethamoxytriphetol (MER-25) and clomifene (MRL-41), were assessed for treatment of breast cancer and found to be effective before tamoxifen, but were plagued with toxicity issues. The first clinical study of tamoxifen took place at the Christie Hospital in 1971, and showed a convincing effect in advanced breast cancer, but nevertheless ICI&#x27;s development programme came close to termination when it was reviewed in 1972. In an unpublished article from the early days of the trial, Dora Richardson documented her team&#x27;s excitement about tamoxifen&#x27;s effects in counteracting infertility problems and the early positive effects found in breast cancer patients. Unfortunately, this work was not well received by everyone, as the team was supposed to be looking for a contraceptive pill. Tamoxifen&#x27;s further development may have been bolstered by a second clinical study by Harold W.C. Ward at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham. Ward&#x27;s study showed a more definitive response to the drug at a higher dosage. Walpole also may have helped to convince the company to market tamoxifen for late stage breast cancer in 1973. He was also instrumental in funding V. Craig Jordan to work on tamoxifen. In 1972, ICI Pharmaceuticals Division abandoned development of tamoxifen for financial reasons. The drug was subsequently reinvented from a failed contraceptive, to become tamoxifen, the gold standard for the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer and the pioneering medicine for chemprevention for high-risk women. Two books, &quot;Estrogen Action, Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators and Women&#x27;s Health&quot; (Imperial College Press 2013) and &quot;Tamoxifen: Pioneering Medicine in Breast Cancer&quot; (Springer 2013) tell this story.

1980 saw the publication of the first trial to show that tamoxifen given in addition to chemotherapy improved survival for patients with early breast cancer. In advanced disease, tamoxifen is now only recognized as effective in ER+ patients, but the early trials did not select ER+ patients, and by the mid-1980s the clinical trial picture was not showing a major advantage for tamoxifen. Nevertheless, tamoxifen had a relatively mild side-effect profile, and a number of large trials continued.

The pharmacology of SERMs was discovered, defined, and deciphered during the 1980s. A clinical strategy was described that led to the creation of SERMs as a group of multifunctional medicines aimed at the treatment or prevention of many conditions in postmenopausal women, e.g. osteoporosis and breast cancer.

The early sales of tamoxifen in both the UK and in the U.S. far exceeded ICI&#x27;s original estimate, but despite this, at the annual portfolio review ICI&#x27;s board members still asserted that &quot;there was no market for cancer&quot;, leaving the drug&#x27;s marketing success to rely on its clinical results and clinicians&#x27; and scientists&#x27; interests in it. Shortly after, Dora Richardson published a history of tamoxifen that, unusually for that type of paper, included personal accounts and letters from patients who attributed their healing to the drug. This testimony from cancer patients using tamoxifen helped to shape and push forward research, by justifying it both morally and scientifically to corporations.

It was not until 1998 that the meta-analysis of the Oxford-based Early Breast Cancer Trialists&#x27; Collaborative Group showed definitively that tamoxifen was effective for early breast cancer.

==Society and culture==

===Brand names===
Tamoxifen is marketed under the brand names Nolvadex and Soltamox, and a variety of other brand names throughout the world.

===Economics===
Global sales of tamoxifen in 2001 were approximately $1.02 billion. Since the expiration of the patent in 2002, it is widely available as a generic drug around the world. , tamoxifen was the world&#x27;s largest selling hormonal drug for the treatment of breast cancer.

==Research==
In McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS) tamoxifen has been used to treat premature puberty and the consequences of premature puberty. Tamoxifen has been seen to decrease rapid bone maturation which is the result of excessive estrogen and alter predicted adult height (PAH). The same effects have also been seen in short pubertal boys. However, one &quot;in vitro&quot; study in 2007 and later an &quot;in vivo&quot; study in 2008 have shown that tamoxifen induces apoptosis in growth plate chondrocytes, reduces serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels and causes persistent retardation of longitudinal and cortical radial bone growth in young male rats, leading the researchers to express concern giving tamoxifen to growing individuals.

Tamoxifen has been studied in the treatment of the rare conditions of retroperitoneal fibrosis and idiopathic sclerosing mesenteritis. It has also been proposed as part of a treatment plan for Riedel&#x27;s thyroiditis.

Tamoxifen is used as a research tool to trigger tissue-specific gene expression in many conditional expression constructs in genetically modified animals including a version of the Cre-Lox recombination technique. While widely used in transgenic research, the strong anabolic effect of tamoxifen on bone might confound this approach, especially as it relates to bone-targeted constructs.

Tamoxifen may be effective in the treatment of mania in people with bipolar disorder. This is thought to be due to blockade of protein kinase C (PKC), an enzyme that regulates neuron activity in the brain. Researchers believe PKC is overactive during the mania in bipolar patients. , endoxifen, a major active metabolite of tamoxifen with a 4-fold more potent PKC inhibition, was in phase III clinical trials for bipolar disorder.

<doc id="1269575" wikidata="Q628453" url="?curid=1269575" title="1998–99 FA Premier League">
<text>The 1998–99 FA Premier League (known as the FA [[Carling brewery|Carling]] Premiership for sponsorship reasons) was the seventh season of the Premier League, the top division of English football, since its establishment in 1992. Manchester United won a treble of the league title, the FA Cup and the UEFA Champions League. They secured their fifth league title in seven seasons after outlasting Arsenal and Chelsea in a closely fought title race, losing just three league games all season.

The season was also the 100th season of top flight football in England, not counting years lost to the two World Wars. Of the original clubs in the first Football League season, only Aston Villa, Blackburn Rovers, Derby County and Everton were present for this season. 

Arsenal failed to retain their title, despite having the same points tally as last season 78 points, but had at one point looked as though they were on the brink of winning the title, after beating fellow rivals Tottenham Hotspur, while Manchester United had drawn against Liverpool, 2–2. However, Manchester United pushed on and took advantage of Arsenal&#x27;s 1–0 defeat at Leeds United in the penultimate match of the season and despite going 1–0 down against Tottenham on the final day, came back to win 2–1 and clinch the title. Should they have failed to win, Arsenal would have been crowned champions once more.

Chelsea, looking to build on a fourth-placed finish the previous season, were flying for much of the season and were in a good position to claim a first league title in 44 years. The Blues were second at Christmas and went top on Boxing Day. A loss at Highbury at the start of February was just a second in the league all season, and kept Chelsea in second place, just a point off the summit. Eventually, three draws in April against winnable opposition (mid-table sides Middlesbrough and Leicester City, and relegation-threatened Sheffield Wednesday) is what cost Chelsea a first Premiership crown. Had they won these, the Blues would&#x27;ve been champions. Chelsea had to settle for third place, earning a maiden Champions League appearance.

To achieve their success, the Manchester United playing squad had been altered substantially during the close season. A total of more than £28 million had been spent on Dwight Yorke, Jaap Stam and Jesper Blomqvist, while several older players left the club; Gary Pallister returned to Middlesbrough after nine years for £2.5 million, while Brian McClair returned to Motherwell on a free transfer. In December, however, McClair was back in the Premier League as Brian Kidd&#x27;s assistant at Blackburn Rovers.

==Season summary==
At the end of 1998–99, the Premiership would have three Champions League places. Manchester United as well as runners-up Arsenal and third placed Chelsea would be playing in the following season&#x27;s Champions League. There would only be one automatic UEFA Cup place from the league – taken by fourth-placed Leeds United. Fifth-placed West Ham United qualified for the UEFA Cup via the Intertoto Cup after achieving their highest league finish since 1986 as they continued to make progress under Harry Redknapp, outperforming several &quot;bigger&quot; clubs with greater resources. Also qualifying were Newcastle United via the 1998–99 FA Cup final, and Tottenham Hotspur via the League Cup.

Manchester United regained the title from Arsenal on the final day of the season, and had faced competition from Chelsea until the final stages of the season, while Aston Villa had led the table for much of the first half of the season before finishing sixth.

Bottom of the Premiership in the final table came Nottingham Forest, who suffered their third relegation in seven seasons. One notable low for Forest this season was an 8–1 drubbing at home, by Manchester United. Second from bottom came Blackburn Rovers, who just four seasons earlier had been Premiership champions. The final relegation place went to Charlton Athletic, who went down at the end of their first spell in the top flight for nine seasons. The only newly promoted club to survive was Middlesbrough, who finished in ninth place - their highest final position for more than 20 years.

None of the teams relegated from the Premiership the previous season regained their top division status in 1999, although First Division champions Sunderland regained their Premiership place after a two-year exile. The other two relegation places went to long-term absentees from the top division. Playoff winners Watford regained their top division place after an absence of 11 years, but runners-up Bradford had been outside of the top division for 77 years. These two promotion winners surprised the observers more than any other Division One side during 1998–99, but were widely expected to struggle in the top flight.

==Teams==
Twenty teams competed in the league – the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the First Division. The promoted teams were Nottingham Forest, Middlesbrough (both teams sealing an immediate return to the top flight after a single season), and Charlton Athletic (playing in the top flight after an eight-year absence). This was also Charlton Athletic&#x27;s first season in the Premier League. They replaced Bolton Wanderers, Barnsley and Crystal Palace, with all three relegated teams returning to the First Division after a single season in the top flight.

<doc id="1269598" wikidata="Q729591" url="?curid=1269598" title="Ata-Malik Juvayni">
<text>Ata-Malik Juvayni () (1226 - 5 March 1283) was a bureaucrat and historian from the Juvayni family who served under the Mongol Empire. He is known for composing the &quot;Tarikh-i Jahangushay&quot; (&quot;History of the World Conqueror&quot;), an important account on the history of Central Asia and the 13th-century Mongol invasion of Iran.

==Early life==
Born in 1226, Ata-Malik belonged to the Persian Juvayni family, whose history of bureaucratic service goes back to the Seljuk era. Both his grandfather and his father, Baha al-Din, had held the post of &quot;sahib-divan&quot; or Minister of Finance for Muhammad Jalal al-Din and Ögedei Khan, respectively. Baha al-Din also acted as deputy c. 1246 for his immediate superior, the emir Arghun Aqa, in which role he oversaw a large area, including the Kingdom of Georgia.

==Career==
Just like his predecessors, Ata-Malik became an important state official. He visited the Mongol capital of Karakorum twice, beginning his history of the Mongols conquests on one such visit (c. 1252–53). He was with Ilkhan Hulagu in the 1256 campaign at the taking of Alamut, where he selected many &#x27;choice books&#x27; from the famous Alamut library for his own purposes and burnt the books that he did not like. He was responsible for saving part of its celebrated library. He had also accompanied Hulagu during the sack of Baghdad in 1258, and the next year was appointed governor of Baghdad, Lower Mesopotamia, and Khuzistan. Around 1282, Ata-Malik attended a Mongol &quot;quriltai&quot;, or assembly, held in the Ala-Taq pastures northeast of Lake Van. He died the following year in Mughan.

Ata-Malik was survived by at least one son, Mansur (died 1293) and a daughter who became the wife of the Sufi shaykh Sadr al-Din Ibrahim Hamuwayi, who played a key role in converting the later Ilkhanate ruler Ghazan to Islam.

==Siege of Alamut==

Ata-Malik&#x27;s brother was the powerful Shams al-Din Mohammad Sahib-Divan, who had served as Minister of Finance under Hulagu and Abaqa Khan. A skillful leader in his own right, Shams al-Din also had influential in-laws: his wife Khoshak was the daughter of Avag Mkhargrdzeli, Lord High Constable of Georgia, and Gvantsa, a noblewoman who went on to become queen of Georgia.

==Work and legacy==
Ata-Malik&#x27;s position at court and his family connections made him privy to information unavailable to other historians. For unknown reasons, Ata-Malik&#x27;s &quot;Tarikh-i Jahangushay&quot; ends in 1260, more than twenty years before his death.

The standard edition of Ata-Malik&#x27;s history is published under the title &quot;Tarikh-i Jahangushay&quot;, ed. Mirza Muhammad Qazwini, 3 vol, Gibb Memorial Series 16 (Leiden and London, 1912–37). An English translation by John Andrew Boyle &quot;The History of the World-Conqueror&quot; was republished in 1997.

* Juvaini stopped working on the original Persian-language text in 1260, leaving it in a disorganized and incomplete state. Mirza Muhammad Qazvini completed the best text and published it in 1937. The 1958 edition (Boyle&#x27;s English translation) is in two volumes. A book review of the 1958 edition was published by &quot;The American Historical Review&quot;.

<text>Alistair Reid MacLeod (26 February 1931 – 1 February 2004) was a Scottish professional football player and manager. He is perhaps best known for his time as the Scotland national football team manager, including their appearance at the 1978 FIFA World Cup. MacLeod played as a left winger for Third Lanark (two spells), St Mirren, Blackburn Rovers, Hibernian and Ayr United. He then managed Ayr United (three spells), Aberdeen, Scotland, Motherwell, Airdrieonians and Queen of the South.

==Early years==
Alistair Reid MacLeod was born in the south side of Glasgow on 26 February 1931. His family lived in Clydebank for a while but the house was bombed during the Second World War. At length they settled in Mount Florida, near to Hampden Park and Cathkin Park. MacLeod signed provisionally for Third Lanark when he was still a schoolboy. He made swift dashes up the left wing. His distinctive running action earned him the nickname &quot;Noddy&quot;.

==Playing career==
MacLeod started his playing career at Third Lanark as a provisional signing as a schoolboy in 1947. He made his first-team debut against Stirling Albion at Cathkin Park on 6 November 1949.

In 1953, MacLeod was in the Thirds side that trounced Alloa Athletic in the League Cup opener, 10–0. Sitting 8–0 up, MacLeod&#x27;s teammates&#x27; main objective was to get him on the scoresheet. He had set up five goals but had missed several sitters himself. A left-foot rocket shot, and a simple tap in took Thirds&#x27; tally to 10. He joined the Royal Scots for National Service but was still able to turn out for the Thirds.

MacLeod was reluctant to move to St Mirren in 1956, but having secured a guarantee that the reported £8,000 fee would tremendously help Third Lanark&#x27;s survival, he moved on. He spent only six weeks at St Mirren before moving to English team Blackburn Rovers.
Managed by fellow Scot Dally Duncan, MacLeod was man of the match in the 1960 FA Cup Final, but the game was lost 3–0 to Wolves. While at Blackburn he made strenuous efforts along with the PFA steward Jimmy Hill to help abolish the maximum wage, but when subsequently his promised wage increase was not forthcoming, while other players in the team were raised from £20 to £25 per week, he entered into discussions with Hibernian. When Blackburn realised that they were going to lose him to Hibs they matched their offer with an increase from £20 to £25. MacLeod, having already accepted Hibs&#x27; offer, felt he could not go back on his word, so left Blackburn to go back to Scotland.

He played with Hibs until 1963, when he returned to Third Lanark. In 1964 he signed for Ayr United, where he finished his playing career, with no major honours won.

==Coaching career==
===Ayr United===
He started his managerial career in 1966 when he took charge of Ayr United. He took Ayr back to Scotland&#x27;s top division and turned them into a well respected side. He took them to a Scottish and a League Cup semi-final and also set their attendance record with 25,225 watching a 2–1 success over Rangers F.C. In 1973, MacLeod was named Ayr&#x27;s &quot;Citizen of the Year&quot;.

===Aberdeen===
In November 1975, after nine years at Ayr, he moved to Aberdeen where he guided them to a League Cup final success over Celtic.

===Scotland===
====1978 World Cup qualification and preparation====
After success with Ayr and Aberdeen, in May 1977 the Scottish Football Association appointed him manager of the Scotland national team. He introduced himself to the squad with the blunt statement: &quot;My name is Ally MacLeod and I am a winner.&quot; In his first months in charge, Scotland beat England at Wembley and qualified for the 1978 World Cup from a group containing Czechoslovakia, who had won the 1976 European Championship, and Wales. Scotland&#x27;s World Cup expectations gathered momentum with MacLeod happy with the wave of massive optimism, saying to the press his team would return with &quot;at least a medal&quot;. Scottish comedian Andy Cameron recorded a version of &quot;Ally&#x27;s Tartan Army&quot;, which reached number 6 in the UK charts just before the World Cup.

Qualification was particularly sweet for Scotland since, for the second World Cup in succession, Scotland had achieved what their traditional rivals England had not. Defeat against England in the 1977–78 British Home Championship was taken to mean little. Spirits remained sky-high as 25,000 people came to Hampden Park to watch the squad circle the ground in an open-top bus prior to their departure for Argentina. Prestwick Airport was packed with supporters seeing the team off. When a journalist asked him &quot;What do you plan to do after the World Cup?&quot; MacLeod replied: &quot;Retain it.&quot; This anecdote, though, is denied in some accounts of the Scottish saga at the 1978 World Cup and has been cited as one of the most popular hoaxes in British football.

====1978 World Cup finals====
Some observers were worried by the absence through injury of full-back Danny McGrain. Opponents Peru&#x27;s impressive credentials went overlooked and were not expected to provide many problems in the first match. Peru, however, won the game 3–1. Scotland took the lead but Don Masson missed a penalty and in general failed to play to their potential. Before the match journalist James McKillop had written in &quot;The Glasgow Herald&quot; that &quot;The suggestion that we might not win is unthinkable and can be dismissed out of hand.&quot; As MacLeod himself put it, the performance against Peru was &quot;rank bad&quot;. Plentiful excuses emerged: there had been a dispute concerning bonuses, the hotel swimming pool had no water in it, there was nothing for the players to do. It was then revealed that the winger Willie Johnston had taken a cold tablet which contained a banned stimulant fencamfamine (Reactivan). He was sent home. MacLeod, at a press conference, saw a mongrel dog approach: &quot;I think he is the only friend I have got left&quot;, he said, stretching out a hand.

The game with Iran finished a 1–1 draw, after a poor display by the Scots. They then needed to beat the Netherlands, one of the tournament favourites, by three clear goals, to qualify. The next day&#x27;s &quot;The Glasgow Herald&quot; ran the result of the Iran game as their main story under the headline &quot;Ally&#x27;s night of shame&quot;. &quot;Herald&quot; reporter James McKillop described the match as &quot;Ally&#x27;s Alamo&quot; and said Scotland had &quot;turned disgrace into humiliation&quot;. Adding that at full-time the Scotland players &quot;were lucky not to be lynched&quot;, he said he had &quot;never seen Scotland supporters more angry&quot;. McKillop&#x27;s report also stated that in response to the result MacLeod offered &quot;excuses, if not reasons&quot;, with MacLeod stated that &quot;the team had been under tremendous pressure in Argentina&quot;.

For the Netherlands match MacLeod gave Graeme Souness his first game of the World Cup and was rewarded with a much-improved team performance. When Archie Gemmill scored what is widely thought to be one of the greatest World Cup goals ever (it was officially ranked seventh best by FIFA), to make the score 3–1 to Scotland, qualification to the next phase looked possible. Three minutes later, though, the Dutch pulled a goal back; the game ended 3–2 and Scotland were eliminated on goal difference. The Netherlands proceeded to the final, where they lost to Argentina.

====Aftermath and resignation====
Following the squads return to Scotland, Macleod&#x27;s future was discussed by the SFA&#x27;s International Committee at a meeting in July to consider the team&#x27;s failure in Argentina. Macleod was present at this four and half hour meeting where a motion to remove him was proposed. The six-man committee agreed to keep Macleod in place as the motion was defeated, but &quot;The Glasgow Herald&quot; reported that it was understood that the motion for dismissal had only been defeated on the casting vote of the Committee&#x27;s chairman, Tom Laughlan of Kilmarnock F.C. An editorial in the same newspaper noted that &quot;the football public expected more from Mr MacLeod in the Scotland job than he was able to deliver. He emerges from a chastening experience a wiser man.&quot;

Although MacLeod had survived this immediate inquest by the sport&#x27;s authorities, he resigned after one more game in charge, only 17 matches and about 500 days after his appointment. His old club Ayr United had been given permission by the Scottish Football Association to talk to MacLeod about him returning as Ayr manager. MacLeod accepted the offer although Ayr were in the second tier and the job was thought to pay around £12,000 per year, £3,000 less than he received as Scotland manager. MacLeod admitted that the World Cup failure, and the fallout which followed it, &quot;had taken a lot out of him&quot;, but said he was now relaxed and wanted &quot;to prove myself again.&quot; His decision to resign and return to club management echoed that of his predecessor in the Scotland job, Willie Ormond. MacLeod&#x27;s departure left Scotland needing to quickly appoint a manager ahead of their next UEFA Euro 1980 qualifying match against Norway. &quot;The Glasgow Herald&quot; sports reporter Jim Reynolds dismissed the idea that MacLeod might be asked to stay on in a part-time basis until after this match, saying that &quot;Too many people inside Park Gardens&quot;, which was the SFA&#x27;s headquarters, would &quot;breath a sigh of relief&quot; at MacLeod&#x27;s departure.

The Scottish Football Association&#x27;s annual report, issued in May 1979, stated that, &quot;regardless of the depressing aspects of Mr MacLeod&#x27;s latter days in the Association&#x27;s employ, it would be quite unfair not to comment that he was largely responsible for kindling an enthusiasm for the Scottish team that far exceeded anything which had gone before. The Association benefited considerably from that enthusiasm and should not forget it&quot;.

In his autobiography, &quot;The Ally MacLeod Story&quot; (1979), he wondered whether he had &quot;generated just too much excitement. Had I raised the level of national optimism just too high?&quot; But he was able to console himself: &quot;Would the Scottish fans have tolerated anything less from me than whole-hearted conviction?&quot; MacLeod also reassured the reader that he, for one, never thought that Scotland were invincible, and claimed to be perfectly at peace with himself. &quot;I am a very good manager who just happened to have a few disastrous days, once upon a time, in Argentina.&quot;

===Later career===
His subsequent managerial career included spells at Motherwell (1979–1981), Airdrie (1984–1985) and a third spell at Ayr (1986–1989) when he won a Second Division (third tier) title in 1988. His last job in football was with Dumfries club Queen of the South. In 1992, he played in a game for Queens&#x27; reserve team, scoring a goal from a penalty at the age of 61.

==Death and tributes==
Increasingly again treated with affection by the Scottish footballing public, in July 2003, at Hampden Park, he was presented with a crystal decanter in appreciation of his services to the national team and to Scottish football.

He died in 2004, aged 72, after a long battle with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. MacLeod was posthumously inducted to the Scottish Football Hall of Fame in 2015.

<text>Altitude training is the practice by some endurance athletes of training for several weeks at high altitude, preferably over above sea level, though more commonly at intermediate altitudes due to the shortage of suitable high-altitude locations. At intermediate altitudes, the air still contains approximately 20.9% oxygen, but the barometric pressure and thus the partial pressure of oxygen is reduced.

Depending on the protocols used, the body may acclimate to the relative lack of oxygen in one or more ways such as increasing the mass of red blood cells and hemoglobin, or altering muscle metabolism. Proponents claim that when such athletes travel to competitions at lower altitudes they will still have a higher concentration of red blood cells for 10–14 days, and this gives them a competitive advantage. Some athletes live permanently at high altitude, only returning to sea level to compete, but their training may suffer due to less available oxygen for workouts.

Altitude training can be simulated through use of an altitude simulation tent, altitude simulation room, or mask-based hypoxicator system where the barometric pressure is kept the same, but the oxygen content is reduced which also reduces the partial pressure of oxygen. Hypoventilation training, which consists of reducing the breathing frequency while exercising, can also mimic altitude training by significantly decreasing blood and muscle oxygenation.

== Background history ==

The study of altitude training was heavily delved into during and after the 1968 Olympics, which took place in Mexico City, Mexico: elevation . It was during these Olympic Games that endurance events saw significant below-record finishes while anaerobic, sprint events broke all types of records. It was speculated prior to these events how the altitude might affect performances of these elite, world-class athletes and most of the conclusions drawn were equivalent to those hypothesized: that endurance events would suffer and that short events would not see significant negative changes. This was attributed not only to less resistance during movement—due to the less dense air—but also to the anaerobic nature of the sprint events. Ultimately, these games inspired investigations into altitude training from which unique training principles were developed with the aim of avoiding underperformance.

==Training regimens==
Athletes or individuals who wish to gain a competitive edge for endurance events can take advantage of exercising at high altitude. High altitude is typically defined as any elevation above .

===Live-high, train-low===
One suggestion for optimizing adaptations and maintaining performance is the live-high, train-low principle. This training idea involves living at higher altitudes in order to experience the physiological adaptations that occur, such as increased erythropoietin (EPO) levels, increased red blood cell levels, and higher VO2 max, while maintaining the same exercise intensity during training at sea level. Due to the environmental differences at high altitude, it may be necessary to decrease the intensity of workouts. Studies examining the live-high, train-low theory have produced varied results, which may be dependent on a variety of factors such as individual variability, time spent at high altitude, and the type of training program. For example, it has been shown that athletes performing primarily anaerobic activity do not necessarily benefit from altitude training as they do not rely on oxygen to fuel their performances.

A non-training elevation of and training at or less has shown to be the optimal approach for altitude training. Good venues for live-high train-low include Mammoth Lakes, California; Flagstaff, Arizona; and the Sierra Nevada, near Granada in Spain.

Altitude training can produce increases in speed, strength, endurance, and recovery by maintaining altitude exposure for a significant period of time. A study using simulated altitude exposure for 18 days, yet training closer to sea-level, showed performance gains were still evident 15 days later.

Opponents of altitude training argue that an athlete&#x27;s red blood cell concentration returns to normal levels within days of returning to sea level and that it is impossible to train at the same intensity that one could at sea level, reducing the training effect and wasting training time due to altitude sickness. Altitude training can produce slow recovery due to the stress of hypoxia. Exposure to extreme hypoxia at altitudes above can lead to considerable deterioration of skeletal muscle tissue. Five weeks at this altitude leads to a loss of muscle volume of the order of 10–15%.

===Live-high, train-high===
In the live-high, train-high regime, an athlete lives and trains at a desired altitude. The stimulus on the body is constant because the athlete is continuously in a hypoxic environment. Initially VO2 max drops considerably: by around 7% for every 1000 m above sea level. Athletes will no longer be able to metabolize as much oxygen as they would at sea level. Any given velocity must be performed at a higher relative intensity at altitude.

===Repeated sprints in hypoxia ===
In repeated sprints in hypoxia (RSH), athletes run short sprints under 30 seconds as fast as they can. They experience incomplete recoveries in hypoxic conditions. The exercise to rest time ratio is less than 1:4, which means for every 30 second all out sprint, there is less than 120 seconds of rest.

When comparing RSH and repeated sprints in normoxia (RSN), studies show that RSH improved time to fatigue and power output. RSH and RSN groups were tested before and after a 4-week training period. Both groups initially completed 9–10 all-out sprints before total exhaustion. After the 4 week training period, the RSH group was able to complete 13 all out sprints before exhaustion and the RSN group only completed 9.

Possible physiological advantages from RSH include compensatory vasodilation and regeneration of phosphocreatine (PCr). The body&#x27;s tissues have the ability to sense hypoxia and induce vasodilation. The higher blood flow helps the skeletal muscles maximize oxygen delivery. A greater level of PCr resynthesis augments the muscles power production during the initial stages of high-intensity exercise.

RSH is still a relatively new training method and is not fully understood.

===Artificial altitude===
Altitude simulation systems have enabled protocols that do not suffer from the tension between better altitude physiology and more intense workouts. Such simulated altitude systems can be utilized closer to competition if necessary.

In Finland, a scientist named Heikki Rusko has designed a &quot;high-altitude house.&quot; The air inside the house, which is situated at sea level, is at normal pressure but modified to have a low concentration of oxygen, about 15.3% (below the 20.9% at sea level), which is roughly equivalent to the amount of oxygen available at the high altitudes often used for altitude training due to the reduced partial pressure of oxygen at altitude. Athletes live and sleep inside the house, but perform their training outside (at normal oxygen concentrations at 20.9%). Rusko&#x27;s results show improvements of EPO and red-cell levels.

Artificial altitude can also be used for hypoxic exercise, where athletes train in an altitude simulator which mimics the conditions a high altitude environment. Athletes are able to perform high intensity training at lower velocities and thus produce less stress on the musculoskeletal system. This is beneficial to an athlete who had a musculoskeletal injury and is unable to apply large amounts of stress during exercise which would normally be needed to generate high intensity cardiovascular training. Hypoxia exposure for the time of exercise alone is not sufficient to induce changes in hematologic parameters. Hematocrit and hemoglobin concentrations remain in general unchanged. There are a number of companies who provide altitude training systems, most notably Hypoxico, Inc. who pioneered the artificial altitude training systems in the mid-1990s.

A South African scientist named Neil Stacey has proposed the opposite approach, using oxygen enrichment to provide a training environment with an oxygen partial pressure even higher than at sea level. This method is intended to increase training intensity.

== Principles and mechanisms ==
Altitude training works because of the difference in atmospheric pressure between sea level and high altitude. At sea level, air is denser and there are more molecules of gas per litre of air. Regardless of altitude, air is composed of 21% oxygen and 78% nitrogen. As the altitude increases, the pressure exerted by these gases decreases. Therefore, there are fewer molecules per unit volume: this causes a decrease in partial pressures of gases in the body, which elicits a variety of physiological changes in the body that occur at high altitude.

The physiological adaptation that is mainly responsible for the performance gains achieved from altitude training, is a subject of discussion among researchers. Some, including American researchers Ben Levine and Jim Stray-Gundersen, claim it is primarily the increased red blood cell volume.

Others, including Australian researcher Chris Gore, and New Zealand researcher Will Hopkins, dispute this and instead claim the gains are primarily a result of other adaptions such as a switch to a more economic mode of oxygen utilization.

===Increased red blood cell volume===

At high altitudes, there is a decrease in oxygen hemoglobin saturation. This hypoxic condition causes hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) to become stable and stimulates the production of erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone secreted by the kidneys, EPO stimulates red blood cell production from bone marrow in order to increase hemoglobin saturation and oxygen delivery. Some athletes demonstrate a strong red blood cell response to altitude while others see little or no gain in red cell mass with chronic exposure. It is uncertain how long this adaptation takes because various studies have found different conclusions based on the amount of time spent at high altitudes.

While EPO occurs naturally in the body, it is also made synthetically to help treat patients with kidney failure and to treat patients during chemotherapy. Over the past thirty years, EPO has become frequently abused by competitive athletes through blood doping and injections in order to gain advantages in endurance events. Abuse of EPO, however, increases RBC counts beyond normal levels (polycythemia) and increases the viscosity of blood, possibly leading to hypertension and increasing the likelihood of a blood clot, heart attack or stroke. The natural secretion of EPO by the human kidneys can be increased by altitude training, but the body has limits on the amount of natural EPO that it will secrete, thus avoiding the harmful side effects of the illegal doping procedures.

===Other mechanisms===
Other mechanisms have been proposed to explain the utility of altitude training. Not all studies show a statistically significant increase in red blood cells from altitude training. One study explained the success by increasing the intensity of the training (due to increased heart and respiration rate). This improved training resulted in effects that lasted more than 15 days after return to sea level.

Another set of researchers claim that altitude training stimulates a more efficient use of oxygen by the muscles. This efficiency can arise from numerous other responses to altitude training, including angiogenesis, glucose transport, glycolysis, and pH regulation, each of which may partially explain improved endurance performance independent of a greater number of red blood cells. Furthermore, exercising at high altitude has been shown to cause muscular adjustments of selected gene transcripts, and improvement of mitochondrial properties in skeletal muscle.

In a study comparing rats active at high altitude versus rats active at sea level, with two sedentary control groups, it was observed that muscle fiber types changed according to homeostatic challenges which led to an increased metabolic efficiency during the beta oxidative cycle and citric acid cycle, showing an increased utilization of ATP for aerobic performance.

Due to the lower atmospheric pressure at high altitudes, the air pressure within the breathing system must be lower than it would be at low altitudes in order for inhalation to occur. Therefore, inhalation at high altitudes typically involves a relatively greater lowering of the thoracic diaphragm than at low altitudes.

<doc id="1269631" wikidata="Q5508491" url="?curid=1269631" title="Fulvestrant">
<text>Fulvestrant, sold under the brand name Faslodex among others, is an antiestrogenic medication used to treat hormone receptor (HR)-positive metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women with disease progression as well as HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer in combination with abemaciclib or palbociclib in women with disease progression after endocrine therapy. It is given by injection into a muscle.

Fulvestrant is a selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) and was first-in-class to be approved. It works by binding to the estrogen receptor and destabilizing it, causing the cell&#x27;s normal protein degradation processes to destroy it.

Fulvestrant was approved for medical use in the United States in 2002.

==Medical uses==

===Breast cancer===
Fulvestrant is used for the treatment of hormone receptor positive metastatic breast cancer or locally advanced unresectable disease in postmenopausal women; it is given by injection. A 2017 Cochrane review found it is as safe and effective as first line or second line endocrine therapy.

It is also used to treat ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with abemaciclib or palbociclib in women with disease progression after first-line endocrine therapy.

Due to the medication&#x27;s having a chemical structure similar to that of estrogen, it can interact with immunoassays for blood estradiol concentrations and show falsely elevated results. This can improperly lead to discontinuing the treatment.

===Early puberty===
Fulvestrant has been used in the treatment of peripheral precocious puberty in girls with McCune–Albright syndrome.

===Available forms===
Fulvestrant is provided in a castor oil solution also containing alcohol, benzyl alcohol, and benzyl benzoate. It is supplied at a concentration of 250 mg/5 mL.

==Contraindications==
Fulvestrant should not be used in women with kidney failure or who are pregnant.

==Side effects==
Very common (occurring in more than 10% of people) adverse effects include nausea, injection site reactions, weakness, and elevated transaminases. Common (between 1% and 10%) adverse effects include urinary tract infections, hypersensitivity reactions, loss of appetite, headache, blood clots in veins, hot flushes, vomiting, diarrhea, elevated bilirubin, rashes, and back pain. In a large clinical trial, the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) with fulvestrant was 0.9%.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Fulvestrant is an antiestrogen which acts as an antagonist of the estrogen receptor (ER) and additionally as a selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD). It works by binding to the estrogen receptor and making it more hydrophobic, which makes the receptor unstable and misfold, which in turn leads normal processes inside the cell to degrade it.

In addition to its antiestrogenic activity, fulvestrant is an agonist of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), albeit with relatively low affinity (10–100 nM, relative to 3–6 nM for estradiol).

===Pharmacokinetics===
Fulvestrant after an intramuscular injection is slowly absorbed and maximal levels (Cmax) are reached after 5 days on average with a range of 2 to 19 days. The elimination half-life of fulvestrant with intramuscular injection is 40 to 50 days. This is 40 times longer than the half-life of fulvestrant by intravenous injection, indicating that its long half-life with intramuscular injection is due to slow absorption from the injection site. Levels of fulvestrant with 500 mg/month by intramuscular injection (and a single additional 500 mg loading dose on day 15 of therapy) in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer were 25.1 ng/mL (25,100 pg/mL) at peak and 28.0 ng/mL (28,000 pg/mL) at trough with a single dose and 28.0 ng/mL (28,000 pg/mL) at peak and 12.2 ng/mL (12,200 pg/mL) at trough after multiple doses at steady state.

Fulvestrant does not cross the blood–brain barrier in animals and may not in humans as well. Accordingly, no effects of fulvestrant on brain function have been observed in preclinical or clinical research. Fulvestrant is highly (99%) bound to plasma proteins. It is bound to very low density lipoprotein, low density lipoprotein, and high density lipoprotein, but not to sex hormone-binding globulin.

Fulvestrant appears to be metabolized along similar pathways as endogenous steroids; CYP3A4 may be involved, but non-cytochrome P450 routes appear to be more important. It does not inhibit any cytochrome P450 enzymes. Elimination is almost all via feces.

Fulvestrant can form colloidal aggregates at certain concentration ranges and this can limit its activity as well as produce bell-shaped concentration–response curves.

==Chemistry==
Fulvestrant, also known as 7α-[9-[(4,4,5,5,5-pentafluoropentyl)sulfinyl]nonyl]estradiol, is a synthetic estrane steroid and a derivative of estradiol. An alkyl-sulfinyl moiety was added to the endogenous estrogen receptor ligand.

It was discovered through rational drug design, but was selected for further development via phenotypic screening.

==History==
Fulvestrant was the first selective estrogen receptor degrader to be approved. It was approved in the United States in 2002 and in the European Union in 2004.

==Society and culture==

===NICE evaluation===
The U.K. National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) said in 2011 that it found no evidence Faslodex was significantly better than existing treatments, so its widespread use would not be a good use of resources for the country&#x27;s National Health Service. The first month&#x27;s treatment of Faslodex, which starts with a loading dose, costs £1,044.82 ($1,666), and subsequent treatments cost £522.41 a month. In the 12 months ending June 2015, the UK price (excluding VAT) of a month&#x27;s supply of anastrozole (Arimidex), which is off patent, cost 89 pence/day, and letrozole (Femara) cost £1.40/day.

===Patent extension===
The original patent for Faslodex expired in October 2004. Drugs subject to pre-marketing regulatory review are eligible for patent extension, and for this reason AstraZeneca got an extension of the patent to December 2011.
AstraZeneca has filed later patents. A generic version of Faslodex has been approved by the FDA. However, this does not mean that the product will necessarily be commercially available - possibly because of drug patents and/or drug exclusivity. A later patent for Faslodex expires in January 2021. Atossa Genetics has a patent for the administration of fulvestrant into the breast via a microcatheter invented by Susan Love.

==Research==
Fulvestrant was studied in endometrial cancer but results were not promising and as of 2016 development for this use was abandoned.

Because fulvestrant cannot be given orally, efforts have been made to develop SERD drugs that can be taken by mouth, including brilanestrant and elacestrant. The clinical success of fulvestrant also led to efforts to discover and develop a parallel drug class of selective androgen receptor degraders (SARDs).

ZB716, or fulvestrant-3-boronic acid, is an oral prodrug of fulvestrant which is under development.

<text>The 1999–2000 FA Premier League (known as the FA [[Carling brewery|Carling]] Premiership for sponsorship reasons) was the eighth season of the FA Premier League, and Manchester United secured their sixth Premiership title. Like the previous season, they lost only three league games all season. Unlike in the 1998–99 season, they won by a comfortable margin – 18 points as opposed to a single point.

Manchester United lost their defence of the European Cup following a 3–2 defeat against Real Madrid in the quarter-finals. The club had withdrawn from the 1999–2000 FA Cup to participate in the FIFA World Club Championship at the request of the FA who wanted Manchester United to compete to support England&#x27;s bid to host the World Cup. Chelsea won the last FA Cup held at Wembley Stadium before its redevelopment. The League Cup final was won by Leicester City, for the second time in four seasons. In Europe, Leeds United reached the UEFA Cup semi-final and Arsenal were on the losing side to Galatasaray in the UEFA Cup final.

Only one newly promoted team suffered relegation: Watford, who finished in last place, and achieved a record Premiership low of just 24 points (a record since broken by Sunderland (twice), Derby County, Aston Villa, Huddersfield Town, Norwich City (twice), Sheffield United (twice), and themselves), despite a decent start to their campaign which saw them beat both Liverpool (at Anfield) and Chelsea. The most successful promoted team was Sunderland, who finished seventh in the final table and spent much of the season pushing for a place in European competition. Bradford City, back in the top division for the first time since 1922, secured their Premiership survival on the last day of the season with a 1–0 win over Liverpool. The result meant that Liverpool lost out on a Champions League place, and Wimbledon were relegated after 14 years of top-division football. Second-from-bottom Sheffield Wednesday were relegated in their penultimate game of the season, having spent 15 of the previous 16 seasons in the top division. Wednesday&#x27;s season included an 8–0 defeat at Newcastle. Amazingly Coventry City went all season without an away win but still managed to secure 14th place due to an impressive home record which saw them win 12 out of their 19 matches.

As well as Premiership champions Manchester United and runners-up Arsenal, third placed Leeds United qualified for the 2000–01 Champions League. UEFA Cup places went to fourth placed Liverpool, F.A Cup winners Chelsea, and League Cup winners Leicester City.

Promoted to the Premiership for 2000–01 were First Division champions Charlton Athletic, runners-up Manchester City and playoff winners Ipswich Town. For the first time since the formation of the Premiership, all of the promoted teams had been members of the Premiership before.

==Teams==

Twenty teams competed in the league – the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the First Division. The promoted teams were Sunderland, Bradford City and Watford, who returned after absences of two, seventy-seven and eleven years respectively. This was also both Bradford City and Watford&#x27;s first season in the Premier League. They replaced Charlton Athletic, Blackburn Rovers and Nottingham Forest, who were relegated to the First Division. Charlton Athletic and Nottingham Forest were immediately relegated after a season&#x27;s presence, while Blackburn Rovers&#x27; seven-year top flight spell came to an end.

<doc id="1269658" wikidata="Q17379560" url="?curid=1269658" title="Impersonator">
<text>An impersonator is someone who imitates or copies the behavior or actions of another. There are many reasons for impersonating someone:

*Living history: After close study of some historical figure, a performer may dress and speak &quot;as&quot; that person for an audience. Such historical interpretation may be a scripted dramatic performance like &quot;Mark Twain Tonight!&quot; or an unscripted interaction while staying in character.

*Entertainment: An &quot;impressionist&quot; impersonates well-known figures in order to entertain an audience. Especially popular objects of impersonation are Elvis Presley (&quot;see Elvis impersonator&quot;), Michael Jackson (&quot;see Michael Jackson impersonator&quot;) and Madonna (see &quot;Madonna impersonator&quot;). Other uses of impersonation for entertainment include male drag queens (previously called &quot;female impersonators&quot;, although this terminology is now considered outdated.) 
*Crime: As part of a criminal act such as identity theft. This is usually where the criminal is trying to assume the identity of another, in order to commit fraud, such as accessing confidential information, or to gain property not belonging to them. Also known as social engineering and impostors.
*Decoys, used as a form of protection for political and military figures. This involves an impersonator who is employed (or forced) to perform during public appearances, to mislead observers.
*Sowing discord, causing people to fight, or dislike each other for social, business or political gain.

==Celebrity impersonators==

Celebrity impersonators are impostors who look similar to celebrities and dress in such a way as to imitate them. Impersonators are known as sound-alikes, look-alikes, impressionists, imitators, tribute artists, and wannabees. The interest may have originated with the need or desire to see a celebrity who has died. One of the most prominent examples of this phenomenon is the case of Elvis Presley.
Edward Moss has appeared in movies and sitcoms, impersonating Michael Jackson. Tom Jones has attracted his share of impersonators from different places around the world. From the United States, to South East Asia, to the UK, there are performers who either sound like him or imitate his act.

==Criminal impersonation==
In England and Wales, the Poor Law Amendment Act 1851, section 3, made it an offence to impersonate a &quot;person entitled to vote&quot; at an election. In the case of Whiteley v Chappell (1868), the literal rule of statutory interpretation was employed to find that a dead person was not a &quot;person entitled to vote&quot; and consequently a person accused of this offence was acquitted.

Although in a Colorado case, an immigrant was charged with &quot;criminal impersonation&quot; for using another person&#x27;s Social Security number when signing up for a job, some courts have ruled that supplying this wrong information may not be criminal. The ruling hinges on whether there was harm to the other person.

=== Impersonation using Deepfake===

Audio deepfakes have been used as part of social engineering scams, fooling people into thinking they are receiving instructions from a trusted individual. In 2019, a U.K.-based energy firm&#x27;s CEO was scammed over the phone when he was ordered to transfer €220,000 into a Hungarian bank account by an individual who used audio deepfake technology to impersonate the voice of the firm&#x27;s parent company&#x27;s chief executive.

As of 2023, the combination advances in deepfake technology, which could clone an individual&#x27;s voice from a recording of a few seconds to a minute, and new text generation tools, enabled automated impersonation scams, targeting victims using a convincing digital clone of a friend or relative.

<text>An urban area or () in Sweden has a minimum of 200 inhabitants and may be a city, town or larger village. It is a purely statistical concept, not defined by any municipal or county boundaries. Larger urban areas synonymous with cities or towns ( for both terms) for statistical purposes have a minimum of 10,000 inhabitants. The same statistical definition is also used for urban areas in the other Nordic countries.

In 2018, there were nearly two thousand urban areas in Sweden, which were inhabited by 87% of the Swedish population.

&quot;Urban area&quot; is a common English translation of the Swedish term . The official term in English used by Statistics Sweden is, however, &quot;locality&quot; (). It could be compared with &quot;census-designated places&quot; in the United States.

==History==
Until the beginning of the 20th century, only the towns/cities were regarded as urban areas. The built-up area and the municipal entity were normally almost congruent. Urbanization and industrialization created, however, many new settlements without formal city status. New suburbs grew up just outside city limits, being &quot;de facto&quot; urban but &quot;de jure&quot; rural. This created a statistical problem. The census of 1910 introduced the concept of &quot;densely populated localities in the countryside&quot;. The term &quot;tätort&quot; (literally &quot;dense place&quot;) was introduced in 1930. The municipal amalgamations placed more and more rural areas within city municipalities, which was the other side of the same problem. The administrative boundaries were in fact not suitable for defining rural and urban populations. From 1950 rural and urban areas had to be separated even within city limits, as, e.g., the huge wilderness around Kiruna had been declared a &quot;city&quot; in 1948. From 1965 only &quot;non-administrative localities&quot; are counted, independently of municipal and county borders. In 1971 &quot;city&quot; was abolished as a type of municipality.

==Terminology==

Urban areas in the meaning of &quot;tätort&quot; are defined independently on the division into counties and municipalities, and are defined solely according to population density. In practice, most references in Sweden are to municipalities, not specifically to towns or cities, which complicates international comparisons. Most municipalities contain many localities (up to 26 in Kristianstad Municipality), but some localities are, on the other hand, multimunicipal. Stockholm urban area is spread over 11 municipalities.

When comparing the population of different cities, the urban area (&quot;tätort&quot;) population is preferred to the population of the municipality. The population of, e.g., Stockholm should be accounted as about 1.6 million rather than the approximately 990,000 of the municipality, and Lund rather about 94,000 than about 130,000.

==Swedish definitions==
===Terms used for statistical purposes===

* () is the central concept used in statistics. The definition is agreed upon in the Nordic countries: An urban area is any village, town or city with a population of at least 200, for which the contiguous built-up area meet the criterion that houses are not more than 200 meters apart when discounting rivers, parks, roads, etc. – without regard to the ward, municipal or county boundaries. Delimitation of localities are made by Statistics Sweden every three years starting 2015 on a trial basis, previously they were made every five years.
* () is a rural locality with 50–199 inhabitants in a contiguous built-up area with no more than 150 meters between houses. The concept is rarely used outside the field of statistics, where it is used for settlements just below the limit defined for . 
* Centralort () is mostly used in the meaning municipal seat or municipal center of service, commerce and administration for an area.

===Popular and traditional terms===
* Storstad () is a term usually reserved for Sweden&#x27;s three largest cities: Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö. Statistics Sweden uses the term metropolitan area () for these three cities and their immediate surroundings and municipalities.
* () is the term avoided by Statistics Sweden, however, it roughly corresponds to urban areas with a population greater than 10,000. Judicially, the term &quot;stad&quot; has been obsolete since 1971, and is now mostly used describing localities which used to be chartered towns. The statistical category &quot;large town&quot; used by Statistics Sweden include municipalities with more than 90,000 inhabitants within a 30 km radius from the municipality centre. There is also a category &quot;medelstor stad&quot; &quot;middle large town&quot;.
* Köping () was also abolished as an official term in 1971 in governmental and statistical contexts, and is only rarely kept in use by laymen, although it has survived as part of the names of several towns. The meaning was a locality with an intermediary legal status below that of a town.
* Municipalsamhälle () was a term in use between 1875 and 1971, but it is no longer used outside of historical contexts. In 1863, Sweden was divided into 2,500 municipalities, whereof 89 were towns, 8 were market towns (köpingar) and the rest rural municipalities (&quot;landskommuner&quot;). A &quot;municipalsamhälle&quot; was an administrative centre for one or several rural municipalities, with special regulations and privileges in common with towns. The term became obsolete in 1971 when the different types of municipalities were abandoned and a standard form for all municipalities was introduced.
* Samhälle () is a common concept used by for urban areas that are intermediary in size between a town and a village. The term &quot;samhälle&quot; is also used in Swedish to denote &quot;society&quot;, &quot;community&quot; or &quot;state&quot;. (Compare: Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft.) A &quot;samhälle&quot; does not necessarily meet the criteria for the current &quot;tätort&quot; – or even &quot;småort&quot; concept.
* By () is a traditional term but may in colloquial use refer to a suburb or town of considerable size. If at all used in the context of statistics, it must be assumed that the size of a &quot;by&quot; is smaller than that of a &quot;småort.&quot; (NB! Not to be confused with the same word in Danish and Norwegian, where it means town, while a village is called &quot;landsby&quot;.)

===Seasonal areas and suburbs===
* Fritidshusområde () is in statistical context an area with less than 50 permanent inhabitants but at least 50 houses (in practice: weekend cottages/summer houses) meeting the criterion that they are not more than 150 metres apart. About a third of Sweden&#x27;s &quot;second homes&quot; are located in such areas. The term belongs also to everyday usage, although less strictly defined.
* Förstad and förort () are much used terms with a somewhat negative connotation.

==Statistics==

Before 2015 delimitation of localities were made by Statistics Sweden every five years, since then it is trialling a three-year update period. The number of urban areas in Sweden increased by 56 to 1,956 in 2010. A total of 8,016,000 – 85 per cent – of the Swedish population lived in an urban area; occupying only 1,3 per cent of Sweden&#x27;s total land area, and the most populous urban area is Stockholm at 1,4 million people.

There are over 2,000 urban areas in Sweden as defined by Statistics Sweden on 31 December 2023. The official term used by Statistics Sweden is &quot;locality&quot; () instead of &quot;urban area&quot; and they are defined as having a minimum of 200 inhabitants.

As of December 2023, there are 125 localities with at least ten thousand inhabitants:

&quot;The list is currently under update.&quot;

<text>Laurenz Meyer (born 15 February 1948) is a German politician of the Christian Democratic Union or CDU. From 2000 to 2004, he was general secretary of the CDU.

==Early life and education==
Meyer was born in Salzkotten, North Rhine-Westphalia. After his &quot;Abitur&quot; (school-leaving) examinations in 1968, he completed a course of study in economics at the University of Münster, leaving in 1975 as a qualified economist. He was then employed at Vereinigte Elektrizitätswerke Westfalen, or VEW AG (which was later taken over by the RWE group) in Dortmund.

== Career ==

===Party===
Meyer has been a member of the CDU since 1968. From 1997 to 2001, he was state treasurer of the CDU in North Rhine-Westphalia. He has belonged to the federal executive of the CDU since April 2000 and was general secretary of the CDU from 20 November 2000 to 22 December 2004.

===Elected representative===

Meyer was on the Hamm city council from 1975 to 1995 and was CDU leader on the council from 1989 to 1995. In 1994, he campaigned for the office of Lord Mayor, but lost to Jürgen Wieland, the candidate of the SPD (Social Democratic Party).

From 1990 until 2003, Meyer was a member of the state parliament (Landtag) of North Rhine-Westphalia. Here he was party spokesperson for economic issues from 1990 to 1999, deputy leader from 1997 to 1999, and leader of the CDU in the state parliament from 23 February 1999 to 2 June 2000. After losing the 2000 election, Meyer had to give up his office as party leader to Jürgen Rüttgers. From 6 June to 6 December 2000, Meyer was then deputy speaker of the state parliament of North Rhine-Westphalia.

Since 2002 Laurenz Meyer has been a member of the German Federal Parliament (Bundestag). He entered parliament by being on the CDU&#x27;s party list for North Rhine-Westphalia, in Germany&#x27;s proportional representation electoral system.

===RWE affair and resignation===

On 10 December 2004, it was reported that Meyer (nicknamed Laurenz Nimmersatt, &quot;Gluttonous Laurenz&quot;) was receiving power from RWE (which had taken over his former employer VEW in 2000) at a discounted employee rate, although he had parted company with the group in 1999. One week later, new allegations surfaced, according to which he was receiving payments from RWE even while he was General Secretary of the CDU. Meyer described these as &quot;special dividends&quot;. In addition, Meyer was still receiving earnings as deputy speaker in the North Rhine-Westphalian state parliament and was thus receiving three salaries. The &quot;Bild am Sonntag&quot; newspaper reported on 19 December that CDU boss Angela Merkel had stripped her General Secretary of his powers. Close party colleagues demanded his resignation. On 20 December, Meyer announced that he would donate the amount in question (€81,800) to the charity SOS Children&#x27;s Villages.

After pressure from the party&#x27;s rank and file, Meyer resigned as general secretary on 22 December 2004. The reason for his resignation was that contrary to his description, the special payment was not a severance pay since Meyer returned to the company only after the CDU defeat at the North Rhine-Westphalian election in May 2000. This fact and the false information he provided to Angela Merkel made his situation untenable for the party. The received payments admitted by him and the announcement of a donation to SOS-Kinderdörfer were especially unable to pacify the party&#x27;s branches in North Rhine-Westphalia and Schleswig-Holstein, which were involved with their area&#x27;s election campaigns.

As a member of parliament, Meyer continued to receive the usual salary of €7,009 a month (€7,960 as of 2012, €8,252 as of 2013), plus the tax-free monthly expense allowance of €3,551 (€4,123 in 2013). Furthermore, he may reactivate his employment contract with the RWE energy company, from which he last drew an annual income of €112,381.

On 23 December 2004, RWE announced the result of an internal investigation into the payments made to Meyer. It found that 160,000 of 250,000 Deutsche Mark were unjustified and had been made by VEW as a result of a &quot;communication error&quot;. In a statement on 17 December, Meyer had described this payment as &quot;legally correct&quot;, but also admitted &quot;...I have nevertheless become aware of the fact that many people have a problem understanding that at that time I accepted this money, since I went back into the company...&quot;.

Most recently, Meyer was employed as RWE&#x27;s commercial director in the Arnsberg regional office.

==Personal life==
Meyer is married and has four daughters. He is separated from his wife and lives with his partner in Hamm.

<text>The Feldberg/Taunus transmitter is a facility for FM- and TV-broadcasting and for directional radio services located on the Großer Feldberg, the highest mountain in the Taunus region of Germany.

For FM- and TV-broadcasting; a guyed tubular mast is used, while for radio relay services a tower of unique design is used, which is a combination of a multistory building and a telecommunications tower.

== History ==

This tower was built in 1937 as a reinforced concrete construction with an upper section built of wood. Intended as a television tower for the Rhine Main Area, it became a radar station during World War II. Before the end of World War II, the tower was heavily damaged by bombs, and the structure burned down.

In 1950, reconstruction of the tower was started. The lower 5 floors were reused in the reinforced concrete base. On these a structural steel framework with 5 floors was set up. This carried a timber construction with 9 floors, so that the tower (without the UHF antenna installed on the top) has a total height of 69.13 metres.

Since numerous directional antennas were set up, all connections of the wooden upper building had to be manufactured without metal.

== Present status ==
The tower is now a protected monument.

<text>Sharaf ad-Din Ali Yazdi or Sharif al-Din Ali’ Yazdi (; died 1454, Yazd), also known by his pen name Sharaf, was a 15th-century Persian scholar who authored several works in the arts and sciences, including mathematics, astronomy, enigma, literature such as poetry, and history. The &quot;Zafarnama&quot;, a life of Timur, is his most famous work. 

Sharif al-Din was born in the city of Yazd, Iran in the 1370s. He devoted much of his life to scholarship, furthering his education in Syria and Egypt until Timur&#x27;s death in 1405. 

As a young man, he was a teacher in his native city of Yazd and a close companion of the Timurid ruler Shahrukh (1405–47) and his son Ibrahim Sultan. In 1442/43 he became the close advisor of the governor of Iraq, Mirza Sultan Muhammad, who lived in the city of Qom.

Sharif al-Din rebelled against Shahrukh Timur in 1446/47 when the government was vulnerable, but was later sent to different cities for his acumen. The later years of his life were spent in Taft, where he died in 1454. 

Sharif al-Din was directed to write a biography of Timur in 1421 known as the &quot;Zafarnama&quot;, which he completed four years later in 1425. Timur&#x27;s grandson Sultan Abu al-Fath Ibrahim Mirza was Sharif al-Din&#x27;s patron during the completion of his grandfather&#x27;s biography.

<text>The 2000–01 FA Premier League (known as the FA [[Carling brewery|Carling]] Premiership for sponsorship reasons) was the ninth FA Premier League season and the third season running which ended with Manchester United as champions and Arsenal as runners-up. Sir Alex Ferguson became the first manager to win three successive English league titles with the same club. Liverpool, meanwhile, managed a unique cup treble – winning the FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Cup. They also finished third in the Premier League and qualified for the Champions League. Nike replaced Mitre as manufacturer of the official Premier League match ball, a contract that has since been extended multiple times, with the most recent renewal made in November 2018 to the end of the 2024–25 season.

UEFA Cup places went to Leeds United, Chelsea, Ipswich Town, and Aston Villa, who qualified via the Intertoto Cup. None of the top six clubs in the Premier League had an English manager. The most successful English manager in the 2000–01 Premier League campaign was Peter Reid, whose Sunderland side finished seventh, having spent most of the season challenging for a place in Europe, and briefly occupied second place in the Premier League table.

Despite the success achieved by Sir Alex Ferguson and Gérard Houllier, the Manager of the Year Award went to George Burley. The Ipswich Town manager was in charge of a newly promoted side who began the season as relegation favourites and on a limited budget, guided his team to fifth place in the Premier League final table earning a total of 66 points - the highest total in Premier League history for a newly promoted side since the switch to a 20-team format—and a place in the UEFA Cup for the first time in almost 20 years. 2000–01 was perhaps the best season yet for newly promoted teams in the Premier League. Charlton Athletic finished ninth, their highest finish since the 1950s. The only newly promoted team to suffer relegation was Manchester City, who in the space of six seasons had now been relegated three times and promoted twice. Relegated in bottom place were Bradford City, whose return to the top division after almost 80 years was over after just two seasons. The next relegation place went to Coventry City, who were finally relegated after 34 successive seasons of top division football, which had brought numerous relegation battles and league finishes no higher than sixth place.

==Teams==
Twenty teams competed in the league – the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the First Division. The promoted teams were Charlton Athletic, Manchester City and Ipswich Town, returning after a top flight absence of one, four and five years respectively. They replaced Wimbledon, Sheffield Wednesday and Watford. They were relegated to the First Division after spending fourteen, nine and one year in the top flight respectively.

<text>The Sender Inselsberg (transmitter Inselsberg) is an FM, DAB+ and television-transmission facility on the Großer Inselsberg in Thuringia, Germany. It has two aerial towers, which were built in 1939 and 1974.

The transmission tower built in 1939 is a freestanding cylindrical tower built of steel concrete, which carried until the beginning of the 1990s similar to Gerbrandy Tower a guyed steel tube mast on its top. This mast carried the FM- and TV-broadcasting aerials.

Nowadays this mast is demounted and there are only small aerials for mobile phone services on its top. The tower is nicknamed because of its cylindrical form &quot;thermos flask&quot;.

The transmission tower built in 1974 is a freestanding steel tube tower on three feet. This tower which is similar to the tower of transmitter Brocken, which was built at the same time, carries above its legs three platforms for aerials for directional radio services and in its topmost section, protected by layers of glass-reinforced plastic, transmission aerials for FM broadcasting services and TV.

<doc id="1269689" wikidata="Q1199885" url="?curid=1269689" title="The Adventure of the Second Stain">
<text>&quot;The Adventure of the Second Stain&quot;, one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is one of 13 stories in the cycle collected as &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1905) and the only unrecorded case mentioned passively by Watson to be written. It was first published in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in the United Kingdom in December 1904, and was also published in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; in the United States on 28 January 1905.
Doyle ranked &quot;The Adventure of the Second Stain&quot; eighth in his list of his twelve favourite Holmes stories.

==Plot==

Lord Bellinger, the Prime Minister, and the Right Honourable Trelawney Hope, the Secretary of State for European Affairs, come to Holmes in the matter of a document stolen from Hope&#x27;s dispatch box, which he kept at home in Whitehall Terrace when not at work. If divulged, this document could bring about very dire consequences for all of Europe, even war. They are loath to tell Holmes at first the exact nature of the document&#x27;s contents, but when Holmes declines to take on their case, they tell him it was a rather injudicious letter from a foreign potentate. It disappeared from the dispatch box one evening when Hope&#x27;s wife was out at the theatre for four hours. No one in the house knew about the document, not even the Secretary&#x27;s wife. None of the servants could have guessed what was in the box.

Holmes decides to begin with some spies known to him and is then astonished to hear from Dr. Watson that one of those that he names, Eduardo Lucas, has been murdered. Before Holmes has a chance to act, Lady Hilda Trelawney Hope, the European Secretary&#x27;s wife, arrives unexpectedly at 221B Baker Street. She asks Holmes insistently about the stolen document&#x27;s contents, but Holmes only reveals there would be regrettable consequences if the document were not found. Lady Hilda also begs Holmes to tell her husband nothing of her visit.

Holmes&#x27;s spy hunt does not go well. Four days after the murder, French police arrest the probable murderer of Lucas; Madame Fournier, whom Lucas married in Paris under an alias. She was seen in London near Lucas&#x27;s house the night of the crime, but she is now useless as a witness because she has gone insane.

Inspector Lestrade calls Holmes to the murder scene to examine something odd. Lucas bled over a drugget, and the blood soaked through it, but curiously there is no bloodstain on the floor under the drugget. However, there is one under the opposite edge of the carpet. It can only mean that the constable guarding the crime scene has been foolish enough to let someone in and leave them alone while they moved things in the room, including the carpet. Holmes tells Lestrade to take the constable to a back room and obtain a confession, which he does vigorously. Meanwhile, Holmes pulls the unfastened carpet aside and quickly finds a hiding place in the floor, but it is empty. The errant constable tells Holmes that the unauthorised visitor was a young woman. She apparently fainted at the sight of the blood but had left while the constable went out to fetch some brandy to revive her. As Holmes is leaving Lucas&#x27;s house, he shows the constable a photograph, and he recognises it as the visitor.

Holmes goes to the Hope household and confronts Lady Hilda, accusing her of the theft. At first, she denies everything, but is forced to admit her wrongdoing under the threat of certain scandal. Lady Hilda admits Lucas was blackmailing her with a compromising letter written by her years earlier, and demanded the document as payment (an unnamed spy had made Lucas aware of the document). Lady Hilda went to Lucas&#x27;s house to do the business when, as it happened, his wife from Paris showed up and confronted him about his affair, believing Lady Hilda was his mistress. Lady Hilda hurriedly left, albeit not before seeing Lucas place the document under the drugget. She returned to fetch the document after her visit to Holmes convinced her she needed to do so. She hands the document to Holmes. At Holmes&#x27;s suggestion, the document is put back in the dispatch box using Lady Hilda&#x27;s duplicate key.

When Hope arrives back home with the Prime Minister, Holmes pretends to believe that the evidence has convinced him that the document must still be in the box, shuffled between other papers. It is soon found, and Hope rejoices that it was apparently only a mistake. The Prime Minister suspects Holmes knows more than he is telling, but Holmes simply responds, &quot;We also have our diplomatic secrets.&quot;

==Background==
This case was first mentioned in &quot;The Adventure of the Naval Treaty&quot;. In &quot;The Naval Treaty&quot;, Watson says that this case has &quot;interest of such importance and implicates so many of the first families in the kingdom that for many years it will be impossible to make it public.&quot; On the other hand, Watson also refers there to &quot;Monsieur Dubuque of the Paris police, and Fritz von Waldbaum, the well-known specialist of Dantzig, both of whom had wasted their energies upon what proved to be side-issues&quot; who do not appear in the published version of the story. In &quot;My Dear Holmes&quot;, a biography of Holmes by Gavin Brend, Brend hypothesises that their mention suggests there could be another adventure featuring a &quot;second stain&quot;.

Some scholars have speculated that the &quot;foreign potentate&quot; who wrote the missing letter was Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, whose foreign policy was controversial in Britain.

A reference in this same story makes it clear that &quot;The Adventure of the Second Stain&quot; is set in July 1888, in the middle of summer, whereas Watson says in the published version of &quot;The Second Stain&quot; that the case happened in autumn.

Watson states that, due to Holmes&#x27;s retirement, the detective has been trying to avoid publicity, and only allowed Watson to publish the story because the doctor had &quot;promised&quot; to in &quot;The Adventure of the Naval Treaty.&quot;

A spy called Oberstein appears both in this story and in &quot;The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans&quot; (again listed as one of the three most prominent agents in London), set seven years later.

==Publication history==
&quot;The Adventure of the Second Stain&quot; was first published in the UK in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in December 1904, and in the US in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; on 28 January 1905. The story was published with eight illustrations by Sidney Paget in the &quot;Strand&quot;, and with six illustrations by Frederic Dorr Steele in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;. It was included in the short story collection &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which was published in the US in February 1905 and in the UK in March 1905.

In &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;, the story was presented as &quot;the last Sherlock Holmes story ever to be written by A. Conan Doyle&quot;. This would prove to be incorrect since the story preceded later Sherlock Holmes stories collected in &quot;His Last Bow&quot; and &quot;The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, as well as the novel &quot;The Valley of Fear&quot;.

==Adaptations==

===Film and television===
A short silent film adapted from the story was released in 1922 as part of the Stoll film series starring Eille Norwood as Sherlock Holmes and Hubert Willis as Watson, and featuring Dorothy Fane as Lady Hope and Wallace Bosco as Eduardo Lucas. Teddy Arundell played Inspector Hopkins in this short film and other films in the series.

The story was adapted for a 1951 TV episode of &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, starring Alan Wheatley as Holmes.

The story was adapted for the 1968 BBC series with Peter Cushing. The episode is now lost.

The story was adapted in the Granada Television series &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, starring Jeremy Brett, in 1986. The adaptation contains a chronological error as Holmes is seen skipping past the Clive of India Memorial in King Charles Street, London. Only erected in 1912, it did not exist at the time the episode is set (1888).

The story was also adapted in the Soviet TV film &quot;The Twentieth Century Approaches&quot; (1986), the last television film in the series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson&quot;.

An episode of the animated television series &quot;Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century&quot; was based on the story. The episode, titled &quot;The Adventure of the Second Stain&quot;, aired in 2001.

===Radio===
A radio adaptation aired as an episode of the American radio series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. The episode was adapted by Edith Meiser and aired on 23 June 1932, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson.

Meiser also adapted the story as an episode of the American radio series &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson, that aired on 29 January 1940. Another episode in the same series adapted from the story aired on 4 January 1942.

John Gielgud played Holmes and Ralph Richardson played Watson in a radio adaptation of the story that aired on the BBC Light Programme in November 1954. It also featured Raf De La Torre as Lord Bellinger and John Cazabon as Lestrade. The production aired in January 1955 on NBC radio.

Michael Hardwick dramatised the story as a radio adaptation for the BBC Home Service, as part of the 1952–1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson, with Simon Lack as Trelawney Hope and Barbara Mitchell as Mrs Hudson. The adaptation aired in 1967.

&quot;The Second Stain&quot; was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1993 by Bert Coules as part of the 1989–1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It featured Jeremy Clyde as Trelawney Hope and Sabina Franklyn as Lady Hilda.

The story was adapted as a 2013 episode of &quot;The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, a series on the American radio show &quot;Imagination Theatre&quot;, starring John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.

<text>Jakub Sobieski (5 May 1590 – 23 June 1646) was a Polish noble, parliamentarian, diarist, political activist, military leader and father of King John III Sobieski. He was the son of castellan and voivode Marek Sobieski and Jadwiga Snopkowska.

== Biography ==

Sobieski was educated in Kraków and Paris. He was a famed orator and parliamentarian. He participated in the military expedition (Dymitriads) against Russia in 1617-1618 (wounded during the assault of Moscow), and was a member of the War Council (Rada wojenna) of King Władysław IV. He took part in negotiations with Muscovy in the Truce of Deulino in 1618. Subsequently, he fought in the Chocim expedition against the Ottoman Empire in 1621, and the expedition against Abazy Pasa in 1633. He was one of the negotiations with Sweden in the Treaty of Stuhmsdorf (Sztumska Wieś) in 1635.

After his marriage to Zofia Teofillia Daniłowicz his wealth increased significantly, as Zofia brought in her inheritance after the Żółkiewski family and part of the Daniłowski family estates, including Żółkiew Castle.

===Official career ===
He was courtier since 1617, Krajczy of the Crown since 1626, Podczaszy of the Crown since 1636, voivode of Belz Voivodeship since 1638 and of Ruthenian Voivodeship since 1641 and castellan of Kraków since 1646. Starost of Trembowla, Krasnystaw, Jaworów, Stryj, Kałusz, Bar and Gniewo. Elected Deputy to seven Sejms between 1623 and 1632, as Sejm Marshal he led the ordinary Sejm in Warsaw from 24 January to 5 March 1623 and from 27 January to 10 March 1626, the extraordinary Sejm in Warsaw from 27 June to 18 July 1628 and the Election Sejm in Warsaw from 24 September to 15 November 1632.

== Character ==
He was considered by his contemporaries a wise and honorable person. Member of many commissions and diplomatic bodies, he often acted as a mediator or as a guardian of orphaned children. In politics, he usually supported king&#x27;s plans, but was also a defender of the nobility rights and religious tolerance.

==Children==
* Marek became starost.
* John became Marshal, Hetman and King of Poland.
* Katarzyna married Władysław Dominik Zasławski and Michał Kazimierz Radziwiłł.
* Anna Rozalia became a Benedictine nun in Lwów.

==Works==
During the Chocim expedition in 1621 he wrote a diary called &quot;Commentariorum chotinensis belli libri tres&quot; (Pamiętnik wojny chocimskiej - Diary of the Chocim War), which was published in 1646 in Danzig. It was used by Wacław Potocki as a basis for his epic poem, &quot;Transakcja wojny chocimskiej&quot; (&quot;The Progress of the War of Chocim&quot;).

He authored &quot;Commentariorum Chotinensis belli libri tres&quot; (1646) and instructions for his sons journeying to Kraków (1640) and France (1645) which are seen as a prime example of liberal education of that era.

The most obvious presentation of ocular (eye) injuries is redness and pain of the affected eyes. This is not, however, universally true, as tiny metallic projectiles may cause neither symptom. Tiny metallic projectiles should be suspected when a patient reports &quot;metal on metal&quot; contact, such as with hammering a metal surface. Corneal foreign bodies are one of the most common preventable occupational hazards. Intraocular foreign bodies do not cause pain because of the lack of nerve endings in the vitreous humour and retina that can transmit pain sensations. As such, general or emergency department doctors should refer cases involving the posterior segment of the eye or intraocular foreign bodies to an ophthalmologist. Ideally, ointment would not be used when referring to an ophthalmologist, since it diminishes the ability to carry out a thorough eye examination.

Flicking sand, flying pieces of wood, metal, glass and stone are notorious for causing much of the eye trauma. Sporting balls such as cricket ball, lawn tennis ball, squash ball, shuttlecock, and other high speed flying objects can strike the eye. The eye is also susceptible to blunt trauma in a fistfight. Children’s games such as bow-and-arrows, bb guns and firecrackers can lead to eye trauma. Road traffic accidents (RTAs) with head and facial trauma may also have an eye injury – these are usually severe in nature with multiple lacerations, shards of glasses embedded in tissues, orbital fractures, severe hematoma and penetrating open-globe injuries with prolapse of eye contents. Other causes of intraocular trauma may arise from workplace tools or even common household implements, including bottle-caps suddenly propelling at great force.
About 5.3 million cases of foreign bodies in the eyes occurred in 2013.

==Presentation==
===Complications===
Multiple complications are known to occur following eye injury: corneal scarring, hyphema, iridodialysis, post-traumatic glaucoma, uveitis cataract, vitreous hemorrhage and retinal detachment. The complications risk is high with retinal tears, penetrating injuries and severe blunt trauma.

==Diagnosis==
The goal of investigation is the assessment of the severity of the ocular injury with an eye to implementing a management plan as soon as is required. The usual eye examination should be attempted, and may require a topical anesthetic in order to be tolerable. Many topical agents cause burning upon instillation. Proxymetacaine has been found to have the best tolerance.

Depending on the medical history and preliminary examination, the primary care physician should designate the eye injury as a &quot;true emergency&quot;, &quot;urgent&quot; or &quot;semi-urgent&quot;.

===Classification ===

Based on the injury to the eyewall (outer fibrous coat of the eye consisting of cornea and sclera)
*Closed globe injury: the eye globe is intact, but the seven rings of the eye have been classically described as affected by blunt trauma. Types include contusion and lamellar laceration
* Open globe injury: there is a full thickness injury of the eye wall (cornea and sclera)

It includes

A) Globe rupture: caused by blunt trauma and is an inside-out injury.

B) Globe laceration: a full-thickness wound caused by sharp objects. It includes

1)Penetrating trauma: the globe integrity is disrupted by a full-thickness entry wound and may be associated with prolapse of the internal contents of the eye. Such injuries are often referred to as a Globe fracture or a Globe rupture, although these can be incurred by blunt trauma as well.

2) Perforating trauma: the globe integrity is disrupted in two places due to an entrance and exit wound (through and through injury). This is a quite severe type of eye injury.

Other types include
* Blowout fracture of the orbit is caused by blunt trauma, classically described for fist or ball injury, leading to fracture of the floor or medial wall of the orbit due to sudden increased pressure on the orbital contents.
* Muscular Entrapment Fracture of the orbital bones can lead to muscular entrapment limiting gaze in one direction.

===Emergency===
An &quot;emergency&quot; must be treated within minutes. This includes chemical burns of both the conjunctiva and cornea.

===Urgent===
An &quot;urgent&quot; case must be treated within hours. This includes penetrating globe injuries; corneal abrasions or corneal foreign bodies; hyphema (must be referred); eyelid lacerations that are deep, involve the lid margin or involve the lacrimal canaliculi; radiant energy burns such as arc eye (welder&#x27;s burn) or snow blindness; or, rarely, traumatic optic neuropathy.

===Semi-urgent===
&quot;Semi-urgent&quot; cases must be managed within 1–2 days. They include orbital fractures and subconjunctival hemorrhages.

==Management==

===Irrigation===
The first line of management for chemical injuries is usually copious irrigation of the eye with an isotonic saline or sterile water. In the cases of chemical burns, one should not try to buffer the solution, but instead dilute it with copious flushing.

===Patching===
Depending on the type of ocular injury, either a &quot;pressure patch&quot; or &quot;shield patch&quot; should be applied. Up until circa 1987, pressure patches were the preferred method of treatment for corneal abrasions in non-contact lens wearers; multiple controlled studies conducted by accredited organizations such as the American Academy of Ophthalmology have shown that pressure patching is of little or no value in healing corneal abrasions and is actually detrimental to healing in some cases. A Cochrane review found that patching simple corneal abrasions may not improve healing or reduce pain. Pressure patching should never be used on an individual presenting with a corneal abrasion who has a history of contact lens wear. In this circumstance, a virulent infection caused by the bacterium &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; is at a clearly delineated increased risk for occurrence. These infections can cause blindness within 24 – 48 hours and there is a possibility that the infection can move into the peri-orbital socket, resulting in the need for evisceration of the eyeball. In rare cases, the infection can enter the brain and cause death to the patient.

In cases of globe penetration, pressure patches should never be applied, and instead a shield patch should be applied that protects the eye without applying any pressure. If a shield patch is applied to one eye, the other eye should also be patched due to eye movement. If the uninjured eye moves, the injured eye will also move involuntarily possibly causing more damage.

===Suturing===
In cases of eyelid laceration, sutures may be a part of appropriate management by the primary care physician so long as the laceration does not threaten the canaliculi, is not deep, and does not affect the lid margins.

==Epidemiology==
A recent study estimated that from 2002–2003 there were 27,152 injuries in the United States related to the wearing of eyeglasses. The same study concluded that sports-related injuries due to eyeglasses wear were more common in those under the age of 18 and that fall-related injuries due to wearing eyeglasses were more common in those aged 65 and over. Although eyeglasses-related injuries do occur, prescription eyeglasses and non-prescription sunglasses have been found to &quot;offer measurable protection which results in a lower incidence of severe eye injuries to those wearing [them]&quot;.

<text>Downtown 81 is a 2000 American film that was shot in 1980-1981. The film was directed by Edo Bertoglio and written and produced by Glenn O&#x27;Brien and Patrick Montgomery, with post-production in 1999-2000 by Glenn O&#x27;Brien and Maripol. It is a rare real-life snapshot of an ultra-hip subculture of post-punk era Manhattan. Starring renowned artist Jean-Michel Basquiat and featuring such East Village artists as James Chance, Amos Poe, Walter Steding, Tav Falco and Elliott Murphy, the film is a bizarre elliptical urban fairy tale. In 1999, Michael Zilkha, founder of ZE Records (the label of several of the film&#x27;s artists), became the film&#x27;s executive producer.

== Synopsis ==
The film opens with Jean (Basquiat) in hospital with an undisclosed ailment. After checking out, he happens upon an enigmatic woman, Beatrice (Anna Schroeder), who drives around in a convertible. He arrives at his apartment only to discover that his landlord, played by former Yardbirds manager Giorgio Gomelsky, is evicting him.

Later, while trying to sell his art work, he encounters many downtown New York characters, from musician Arto Lindsay and his band DNA to David McDermott to graffiti artists Lee Quiñones and Fab Five Freddy. Jean eventually does manage to sell some of his art work to a rich middle-aged woman who is interested in more than just his art, but she pays with a check. As the film progresses, he wanders the streets of New York City, looking for Beatrice. He catches performances by Kid Creole and the Coconuts and James White and the Blacks. Finally he happens upon a bag lady (Debbie Harry) who turns into a princess when he kisses her. As a reward, she gives him a stack of cash.

== Parallels to real life ==
Writer and producer O&#x27;Brien had a popular music column &quot;Glenn O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s Beat&quot; in &quot;Interview&quot; magazine and created the film to showcase the bands that he had been writing about. The film was initially titled New York Beat, referencing the music. The story was created to string together the live performances, shot on the RCA 24-track mobile recording unit, the best live recording technology at the time. O&#x27;Brien, who knew Basquiat from his &quot;TV Party&quot; program and the Mudd Club, cast then-unknown Basquiat in the film, and said of the movie: &quot;The film is an exaggerated version of life,&quot; he said.

Jean-Michel Basquiat was homeless at the time of the movie and slept in the production office during most of the shooting. &quot;The production bought Jean his first real art supplies and gave him his first real studio, which he lived in,&quot; said Gina Nanni, widow of O&#x27;Brien. &quot;All of the books that talk about [art dealer] Annina Nosei giving Jean-Michel his first studio, that wasn&#x27;t actually true. The film production gave him his first studio, and the first paintings that he made were the paintings that you saw him carrying around in the film.&quot;

Debbie Harry (who plays the fairy princess who gives him money), and her boyfriend Chris Stein, both of the band Blondie, bought a painting of Basquiat’s for $200 after the end of shooting.

== Production ==
&quot;New York Beat&quot; was shot over December 1980 and January 1981. The film was funded by Rizzoli, but the movie was abandoned in the mid-&#x27;80s due to financial problems. Producer O&#x27;Brien resurrected the film after acquiring the rights in 1999 (over a decade after Basquiat&#x27;s death). It was released in 2000 as &quot;Downtown 81&quot; at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival.

The dialogue audio for the film was lost, so actor Saul Williams dubbed the late Basquiat&#x27;s voice. However, the musical soundtrack, mostly live club performances recorded on location using an RCA 24-track mobile unit, survived.

== Soundtrack ==
The soundtrack features music by: Jean-Michel Basquiat with Andy Hernandez; Basquiat&#x27;s own band, Gray; John Lurie and the Lounge Lizards, DNA, Tuxedomoon, the Plastics, Marvin Pontiac, Kenny Burrell, the Specials, Chris Stein, Melle Mel with Blondie, Liquid Liquid, Kid Creole and the Coconuts, James White and the Blacks, Vincent Gallo, Lydia Lunch and Suicide.
Many of the recordings were of live performances, but DNA and Tuxedomoon were recorded in the studio for the soundtrack.

== Reviews ==
After it premiered as &quot;Downtown &#x27;81&quot; at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival, reviews were mostly favorable. &quot;Variety&quot; called it “an extraordinary real-life snapshot of hip, arty, clubland Manhattan in the post-punk era.”

A rare movie review in &quot;Artforum&quot; said, &quot;Basquiat is a joy to watch. He floats through the movie with cool grace and unflagging energy; he&#x27;s a natural in front of the lens...&quot;

British art critic Adrian Searle wrote that &quot;&quot;Downtown 81&quot; captures that New York moment when punk, emerging rap, art school cool and the East Village art and music scenes were at their creative best.”

While the main appeal of the film seems to have been the art and music, some commentators also appreciated giving the modern viewer a peek at the decimated Lower East Side of 1980, saying &quot;the real star of the film is the gritty milieu of a New York long gone&quot;, and that &quot;&quot;New York Beat&quot;...conveys the vast gulf between Manhattan’s rich and the forgotten corners of the city, and the marginal existence of the artistic underground who tried to survive in between these worlds.&quot;

<text>Meropenem, sold under the brand name Merrem among others, is an intravenous carbapenem antibiotic used to treat a variety of bacterial infections. Some of these include meningitis, intra-abdominal infection, pneumonia, sepsis, and anthrax.
Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, constipation, headache, rash, and pain at the site of injection. Serious side effects include &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; infection, seizures, and allergic reactions including anaphylaxis. Those who are allergic to other β-lactam antibiotics are more likely to be allergic to meropenem as well. Use in pregnancy appears to be safe. It is in the carbapenem family of medications. Meropenem usually results in bacterial death through blocking their ability to make a cell wall. It is resistant to breakdown by many kinds of β-lactamase enzymes, produced by bacteria to protect themselves from antibiotics.
Meropenem was patented in 1983. It was approved for medical use in the United States in 1996. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. The World Health Organization classifies meropenem as critically important for human medicine.

== Medical uses ==
The spectrum of action includes many Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (including &quot;Pseudomonas&quot;) and anaerobic bacteria. The overall spectrum is similar to that of imipenem, although meropenem is more active against Enterobacteriaceae and less active against Gram-positive bacteria. Meropenem is effective against bacteria producing extended-spectrum β-lactamases but may be more susceptible to hydrolysis by metallo-β-lactamases produced by bacteria. β-lactamases are enzymes that bacteria produce to hydrolyze β-lactam antibiotics, breaking the β-lactam ring and rendering these antibiotics ineffective. This mechanism helps bacteria resist the effects of antibiotics like penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems, making treatment more challenging. While β-lactam ring in meropenem is more accessible to water molecules than in the other β-lactam antibiotics, that facilitates the hydrolysis process and faster degradation of meropenem&#x27;s antibacterial properties in aqueous solutions, it is more resistant to degradation by β-lactamase enzymes produced by bacteria than the other β-lactam antibiotics.

Meropenem is frequently given in the treatment of febrile neutropenia. This condition frequently occurs in patients with hematological malignancies and cancer patients receiving anticancer drugs that suppress bone marrow formation. It is approved for complicated skin and skin structure infections, complicated intra-abdominal infections and bacterial meningitis.

Meropenem is effective in treating bacterial pneumonia, including hospital-acquired pneumonia.

In 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted approval for the combination of meropenem and vaborbactam to treat adults with complicated urinary tract infections.

==Administration==
Meropenem is administered intravenously as an aqueous solution. Meropenem is stored in vials as white crystalline powder (containing meropenem as the trihydrate blended with anhydrous sodium carbonate). For intravenous administration, if pure meropenem powder is used (rather than the powder blended with sodium carbonate), meropenem is dissolved in 5% monobasic potassium phosphate solution, since meropenem is soluble in 5% monobasic potassium phosphate solution and only sparingly soluble in water (). For intravenous bolus administration, injection vials (that contain meropenem blended with sodium carbonate) are reconstituted with sterile water for injection.

Reconstituted (dissolved) meropenem degrades over time. The degradation may be associated with color change of the solution, typical for a hydrolysis of the amide bond of the β-lactam ring as seen with most β-lactam antibiotics, while particularly for meropenem the color is changing from colorless or pale yellow to vivid yellowish. Upon reconstitution, the meropenem infusion solution, prepared with 0.9% sodium chloride, exhibits both chemical and physical stability for a duration of 3 hours at a temperature up to °C. If refrigerated (°C), the stability extends to 24 hours. However, when the product is reconstituted in a 5% dextrose solution, it is used immediately to ensure its efficacy. The degradation of meropenem in a water-based solution is affected by factors such as pH, temperature, initial concentration, and the specific type of infusion solution used. Meropenem solutions should not be frozen.

There is a bit of a paradox with meropenem that the amide bond in the β-lactam ring of meropenem makes it resistant to many β-lactamases (penicillinases), which are enzymes produced by bacteria that can break down penicillin and related antibiotics such as meropenem. This resistance is due to the stability of the β-lactam ring in meropenem, which is less susceptible to hydrolysis by these enzymes. However, meropenem is not stable in the presence of water. It can undergo hydrolysis in aqueous solutions, which can reduce its effectiveness. This means that while meropenem is designed to resist bacterial enzymes, it can still be broken down by water, which is a bit ironic. That&#x27;s why meropenem requires frequent or prolonged slow administration to supply new drug to the bloodstream to replace what was hydrolyzed by the water component of blood.

Meropenem is administered every 8 hours.

Dosing must be adjusted for altered kidney function and for haemofiltration.

Studies describe application of meropenem therapeutic drug monitoring (measurements of drug levels in the bloodstream at specific intervals) for optimal application.

As with other β-lactams antibiotics, the effectiveness of treatment depends on the amount of time during the dosing interval that the meropenem concentration is above the minimum inhibitory concentration for the bacteria causing the infection. For β-lactams, including meropenem, prolonged intravenous administration is associated with lower mortality compared to bolus intravenous infusion, especially in severe infections or those caused by less sensitive bacteria, such as &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;.

Meropenem exhibits poor permeability across the gut and low oral bioavailability because of its hydrophilic properties, which inhibit its passive diffusion across the intestinal epithelium. The challenges related to research of oral delivery of meropenem are related to high susceptibility of meropenem to degradation through hydrolysis of the amide bond in the β-lactam ring, even at relatively low temperatures and humidity. This instability can result in the loss of meropenem&#x27;s antibacterial activity. Besides that, meropenem is unstable in the acidic environment of the stomach, leading to extensive degradation and loss of the drug after oral administration. In addition, intestinal efflux (secretory) transport can pump the drug back into the gut: efflux transporters, particularly P-glycoprotein (P-gp), present in the gastrointestinal tract can actively pump meropenem back into the gut lumen, limiting its absorption and reducing oral bioavailability; in the attempts of oral administration bacteria can develop resistance to meropenem by enhancing the active efflux of the antibiotic through efflux transporters, such as the MexAB-OprM tripartite efflux system in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. That&#x27;s why meropenem is administered intravenously.

There is insufficient data regarding the administration of meropenem during breastfeeding. However, it has been observed that, in general, the concentration of this β-lactam antibiotic in breast milk is relatively low, therefore, β-lactam antibiotics are not anticipated to induce detrimental effects in infants who are breastfed. Nonetheless, there have been sporadic reports of disturbances in the gastrointestinal flora of the infant, manifesting as diarrhea or oral candidiasis (thrush), associated with the use of β-lactam antibiotics, however, these potential side effects have not been thoroughly investigated specifically in the context of meropenem use, therefore, the safety profile of meropenem in breastfeeding mothers and their infants is unknown.

Although meropenem is not approved for intramuscular or subcutaneous routes of administration in humans, there were studies that evaluated the drug bioavailability in cats and reported bioavailability of 99.69% for intramuscular route and 96.52 % for subcutaneous route of administration; these studies also compared elimination half-lives for intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous routes of administration in cats and reported duration of 1.35, 2.10 and 2.26 hours, respectively. There was also a small study on local tolerance of meropenem intramuscular administration in humans, and it was reported as generally good.

==Side effects==
Among antibiotic drugs, meropenem is relatively safe. The most common adverse effects are diarrhea (4.8%), nausea and vomiting (3.6%), injection-site inflammation (2.4%), headache (2.3%), rash (1.9%) and thrombophlebitis (0.9%). Many of these adverse effects were observed in severely ill individuals already taking many medications including vancomycin. Meropenem has a reduced potential for seizures in comparison with imipenem. Several cases of severe hypokalemia have been reported.

== Interactions ==

Meropenem rapidly reduces serum concentrations of valproic acid. As a result, people who use valproic acid for epilepsy are at increased risk of seizures during treatment with meropenem. In situations where the use of meropenem cannot be avoided, prescription of an additional anticonvulsant should be considered.

==Pharmacology==
===Mechanism of action===
Meropenem is bactericidal except against &quot;Listeria monocytogenes&quot;, where it is bacteriostatic. It inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis like other β-lactam antibiotics. In contrast to other β-lactams, it is highly resistant to degradation by β-lactamases or cephalosporinases. In general, resistance arises due to mutations in penicillin-binding proteins, production of metallo-β-lactamases, or resistance to diffusion across the bacterial outer membrane. Unlike imipenem, it is stable to dehydropeptidase-1, so can be given without cilastatin.

In 2016, a synthetic peptide-conjugated PMO (PPMO) was found to inhibit the expression of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1, an enzyme that many drug-resistant bacteria use to destroy carbapenems.

==Research directions==
Nebulized meropenem (inhaled route) is researched, but is not approved, for prevention of bronchiectasis exacerbation.

<doc id="1269725" wikidata="Q3785031" url="?curid=1269725" title="Heoroweard">
<text>Heoroweard is a character who appears in &quot;Beowulf&quot; and also in Norse legends, where he is named &quot;Hjörvarðr&quot; or &quot;Hiartuar&quot;. If he existed in real life, his name would have been Proto-Norse *&quot;Heruwarduz&quot;. 

In the Norse sources, Hereoweard rebelled against Hroðulf/Hrólf Kraki and killed him, but otherwise the sources vary greatly. This is an account of the differences:

In the paraphrase of &quot;Bjarkamál&quot; in the &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; of Saxo Grammaticus, his army consisted of Swedes in one line and of Geats in another line. This information does not appear in any other sources.

Several sources mention that he was married to Skuld, who according to Angrim&#x27;s summary of the lost &quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot; was the daughter of Aðils the Swedish king (called &quot;Eadgils&quot; in Beowulf). However, according to the &quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot; and &quot;Hrólf Kraki&#x27;s saga&quot;, she was the daughter of Helgi (Halga), whereas Saxo is vague whether it was Adils or Helgi who was her father.

&quot;Hrólf Kraki&#x27;s saga&quot; does not mention where he came from, but according to Arngrímur Jónsson, Heoroweard was the king of Öland and according to Saxo, he became Hrólf&#x27;s jarl in Sweden, whereas in the &quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot;, he was German and the jarl of Skåne. 

In &quot;Beowulf&quot;, he is the son of Heorogar, the elder brother of Halga (Helgi) and Hroðgar (Hróar). (Consequently, he had greater right to the Danish throne than Hrólf Kraki (Hroðulf), and it is not surprising that he was the one who slew Hrólf.) He is mentioned only once, at lines 2160-2161. Beowulf, in the act of giving to his lord Hygelac the armor of Heorogar (which Hrothgar had given to Beowulf as a reward), repeats what Hrothgar told him: &quot;No sooner would Heorogar give it to his son, valiant Heoroweard, though he was true to him...&quot;

He did not survive long after Hrólfs death. According to Arngrímur Jónsson&#x27;s epitome of &quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot;, &quot;Hrólf Kraki&#x27;s saga&quot; and the &quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot;, he was killed shortly after. According to Hrólf Kraki&#x27;s saga, he was killed during the battle, and according to the other sources, he became king but was killed the same day.

==Succession==

According to Arngrímur, Hereoweard was succeeded by Rörek (called &quot;Hreðric&quot; in &quot;Beowulf&quot;), the cousin of Hrólf&#x27;s father, but he was attacked by Valdar. They shared the kingdom so that Rörek kept Zealand, whereas Valdar took Skåne. This version does not fit &quot;Bjarkimal&quot; as it relates that Rörik had been killed by Hrólf.

According to &quot;Hrólf Kraki&#x27;s saga&quot;, Skuld inherited the kingdom but was killed by the Geatish king Thorir Houndsfoot and by Yrsa&#x27;s men. The kingdom then passed into the hands of Hrólf&#x27;s daughters.

According to Saxo, it is Höðr, Aðils&#x27; brother who became the king of both Denmark and Sweden.

In the &quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot;, it is Haki, son of Hamund, who became the king of Denmark, but the other sources who mention him place him centuries earlier.

==Comments==
The Danish scholar Axel Olrik (1903) has proposed a solution to why the sources vary. According to Beowulf, Adils gains the Swedish throne aided by the Geats. In Heoroweard&#x27;s case, he is a pretender who gains the Danish throne aided by the Swedes. This is why Heoroweard is easily made jarl of Swedes, as in Saxo&#x27;s patriotic tradition Swedish rulers are frequently appointed and dethroned. In order to make this possible, Saxo, or his tradition, had to make Adils defeated by the Danes and losing his kingdom. In Arngrímur&#x27;s Icelandic tradition, which had a more clear conception of the Swedish line of kings, Heoroweard could not be made ruler of Sweden, and so he was named as the ruler of a kingdom on the fringe of Sweden, Öland, a kingdom which was known to be independent, but whose line of kings was no longer known.

In Arngrímur and the &quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot;, Heoroweard is the son-in-law of Adils, married to his daughter Skuld, whereas Hrólf Kraki&#x27;s saga makes him the son-in-law of Helgi (according to Olrik, he could not be married to his own cousin). The account shows that Heoroweard had close connection with Adils and Olrik suggests that the real reason behind Hrólfs voyage to Uppsala was Adils&#x27; support of Heoroweard.

However, according to Snorri, Hrólf died during the Swedish king Östen&#x27;s reign. If both Snorri and Olrik are right, the Swedish king who supported Hereoweard when attacking and killing Hrólf may not have been Adils, but Östen.

See also Origins for Beowulf and Hrólf Kraki for more on the historical background of these characters.

<doc id="1269730" wikidata="Q2356853" url="?curid=1269730" title="Pylons of Messina">
<text>The Pylons of Messina are two free-standing steel towers, the Sicilian one in Torre Faro and the Calabrian one in Villa San Giovanni. They were used from 1955 to 1994 to carry a 220 kilovolt (150 kilovolt until 1971) power line across the Strait of Messina, between the Scilla substation in Calabria on the Italian mainland at and the Messina-Santo substation in Sicily at .

==Design==

The two pylons, built in 1955, are both free-standing steel towers. Each stands on an cross-shaped base and is equipped with a crossbar that carries four conductors at a height of , and another V-shaped structure at the top which carries two additional conductors in addition to ground wires. In contrast to more conventional pylon design, the corners of the pylons are arranged diagonally along the direction of the course of the line. The pylons of Messina were the model for the Elbe Crossing 1 in Germany and were, until the completion of Elbe Crossing 2, the tallest pylons in the world. They did however have the longest span of any hydroelectric crossing ever built at 3646 meters, even greater than that of the current record holder the Zhoushan Island Overhead Powerline Tie at 2,700 meters. The span was able to be so large because there wasn&#x27;t a need for a high clearance, the conductors weren&#x27;t as heavy and because the east tower was built on elevated ground approximately 163 m (536 ft) asl, giving the tower a total elevation of 396 m (1,300 ft) above sea level.

After their completion, the oscillation of the structures and their maximum deflections were determined in a very unusual manner: engineers mounted three rockets with a thrust of 9800 kilonewtons on top of the pylons and ignited them.

The line had switching stations at each end of the span. At the Calabrian station, Cannitello, (), the conductors were fixed tightly to a strainer portal. At the Sicilian station at &quot;Torre Faro&quot; (), the conductors were strained by a device providing constant force, which was situated in a building with two inspiring towers, the so-called Morandi Towers (&quot;italian Torri Morandi&quot;), designed by the Italian builder Riccardo Morandi.

== Conductors ==

Until 1971, the electrical service consisted of a single 150 kV three-phase AC system. Four conductors, of which one was used as backup, were installed on the crossbar of the pylon. In 1971 the voltage was increased to 220 kV and two additional conductors were installed at the bottom site of the V-shaped pinnacles. This gave a total transmission capacity of 300 MW.

Conductors consisting of steel and aluminium with a diameter of 27.8 mm were used. They had an aluminium cross section of 45 mm2 and a steel cross section of 305 mm2. The minimum height of the conductors over the Strait of Messina was 70 metres, to allow large ships to pass safely below. This, together with the span of , required a tension force of 608 N/mm2 in the conductor cables. Antivibration ropes were used to dampen oscillations.

By the early 1980s, this transmission capacity was no longer sufficient. It could not be increased by using bundle conductors or more conductive cables, as bundle conductors tend to have much greater wind-induced oscillations than single conductors, which can result in short circuits in such a long span. Normal overhead lines use conducting cables with a larger aluminium portion but these do not have the tensile strength needed for this span. In 1985 a 380 kV three-phase AC submarine cable with a maximum transmission capacity of 1000 MW was laid underneath the Strait of Messina.

The electrical crossing was decommissioned in 1993 and the conductors were removed a year later.

==Today==

After the removal of the power lines, the pylons remain with protected status as historical monuments and are used for meteorological measurements, high distance rescue training and telecommunications. In 2006, the staircase to the top of the Sicilian pylon was briefly opened to the public, but public access to the structure is now prohibited. The stairway to the top has approximately 1,250 steps. 

The switching stations at both ends of the span still exist. The former anchor portal at Cannitello Switching Station is still in place but the tensioning system at Torre Faro has been dismantled. The unused power line from Scilla substation to Cannitello remains, while the line from Torre Faro Switching Station to Messina-Santo substation may be completely dismantled.

On July 10, 2024, Estonian athlete Jaan Roose crossed the Strait of Messina on a slackline spanned between the two towers. He surpassed the previous longest slackline walk of 2,710 meters and completed a distance of 3,600 meters.

==Messina Strait submarine cable==

The submarine cable across the Strait of Messina was laid in 1985. It has a total transmission capacity of 1000 MW and is a part of the single-circuit 380 kV powerline between Rizziconi substation on the Calabrian mainland () and Sorgente substation on Sicily (). It starts at the end of the overhead line south of Villa San Giovanni (), enters the sea at , reaches Sicily in Messina () and ends north of Messina (), where the overhead line to Sorgente starts.

The cable consists of 4 conductors, one of which serves as a reserve.

==Second 380 kV cable ==

Plans were announced in July 2010 to build a second 380 kV power line between Sorgente and Rizziconi in 2015. The line will have a transmission capacity of 2000 MW and will be long, with an undersea portion of .

In May 2016 a double-circuit 380 kV HVAC (high voltage alternating current) land and submarine cable system was handed over to the utility company. It was installed along a total route of approximately 44 km between the power stations of Villafranca Tirrena in Sicily and Scilla in Calabria.

== Similar structures ==
The largest towers of the Zhoushan Island Overhead Powerline Tie are of a very similar design, but are tubular lattice steel towers.

<doc id="1269731" wikidata="Q2602246" url="?curid=1269731" title="Cefotetan">
<text>Cefotetan is an injectable antibiotic of the cephamycin type for prophylaxis and treatment of bacterial infections. It is often grouped together with second-generation cephalosporins and has a similar antibacterial spectrum, but with additional anti-anaerobe coverage.

Cefotetan was developed by Yamanouchi. It is marketed outside Japan by AstraZeneca with the brand names Apatef and Cefotan.

== Adverse effects ==
The chemical structure of cefotetan, like that of several other cephalosporins, contains an &quot;N&quot;-methylthiotetrazole (NMTT or 1-MTT) side chain. As the antibiotic is broken down in the body, it releases free NMTT, which can cause hypoprothrombinemia (likely due to inhibition of the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase) and a reaction with ethanol similar to that produced by disulfiram (Antabuse), due to inhibition of aldehyde dehydrogenase.

==Spectrum of bacterial susceptibility==
Cefotetan has a broad spectrum of activity and has been used to treat bacterial infections of the bone, skin, urinary tract, and lower respiratory tract. Notable species include &quot;Bacteroides, Streptococcus&quot;, and &quot;Escherichia&quot;. The following represents MIC susceptibility data for a few medically significant bacteria.

* &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;: 0.06 μg/mL
* &quot;Bacteroides fragilis&quot;: ≤0.06 μg/mL - 512 μg/mL
* &quot;Clostridium perfringens&quot;: 1 μg/mL - 4 μg/mL

<text>Nikolai Sergeevich Korndorf (, January 23, 1947 – May 30, 2001) was a Russian and Canadian (from 1991) composer and conductor. He was prolific both in Moscow, Russia, and in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

==Biography==
Born in Moscow, (Russian SSR,Soviet Union), Korndorf studied composition with Sergey Balasanian at the Moscow Conservatory from 1965 to 1970. During these years, he wrote a one-act opera &quot;A tale on...&quot; () based on the work of Semyon Kirsanov. In 1973 Korndorf completed post-graduate studies with his opera &quot;Feast in the Time of Plague&quot; based on the play of the same name by Alexander Pushkin.

He studied conducting with Leo Ginsburg from 1967 to 1979 and taught composition and orchestration at the Conservatory from 1972 to 1991. In 1973 he became a member of the Union of Composers and the Moscow Presidium of the Soviet Composers&#x27; Union. He was a co-founder and deputy president of the New Association for Contemporary Music (ACM).

His early works were written in a traditional and academic manner until he adopted an atonal post-expressionist style. Later, he turned to a kind of minimalist repetitive aesthetic, notable in his &quot;Confessiones&quot; (1979) for double bass and twelve wind instruments, and in &quot;Jarilo&quot; (1981) an extensive piece for piano and tape. Korndorf developed this aesthetic further in his large-scale works such as the three &quot;Hymns&quot; (1987–1990), his 3rd and 4th Symphonies, and the opera &quot;MR (Marina and Rainer)&quot; based on correspondence between Marina Tsvetaeva and Rainer Maria Rilke.

In 1991 Korndorf left Russia for Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, where he began experimenting with electro-acoustic media. In Canada, he became an associate composer of the Canadian Music Centre and an associate of the Canadian League of Composers. He taught composition at the University of British Columbia towards the end of his life.

A champion of Korndorf&#x27;s music, Russian conductor Alexander Lazarev has performed and recorded most of his work.

Korndorf died suddenly while playing soccer with friends in 2001. He was 54.
