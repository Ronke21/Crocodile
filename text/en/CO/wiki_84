<text>Francis Clarence McGee (November 4, 1882 – September 16, 1916) was a Canadian ice hockey player for the Ottawa Hockey Club (also known as the Silver Seven) between 1903 and 1906. He played as a centre and as a rover. He was also a civil servant for the government of Canada and later became a lieutenant in the Canadian Army.

McGee was known as &quot;One-Eyed&quot; Frank McGee because he was blind in one eye due to a hockey injury. After missing two years of play because of the injury, he joined the senior Ottawa team in 1903. A well-known player of his era for his prolific scoring, McGee once scored 14 goals in a Stanley Cup game and scored five goals or more in a game on eight other occasions. Despite a brief senior career—only 45 games over four seasons—he helped Ottawa win and retain the Stanley Cup title from 1903 to 1906.

After his hockey career ended, McGee worked for the Department of Indian Affairs in the Canadian federal government. During the First World War, he enlisted in the Canadian Expeditionary Force and died in battle in France in 1916. When the Hockey Hall of Fame was founded in 1945, McGee was in the first class of inductees.

==Personal life==
McGee was born on November 4, 1882, in Ottawa, Ontario. He was one of nine children born to John Joseph McGee and Elizabeth Helen () McGee. He came from a prominent Canadian family. His father was clerk of the Privy Council, Canada&#x27;s most senior civil servant. His uncle, Thomas D&#x27;Arcy McGee, attended two of the conferences that led to Canadian Confederation and was regarded as one of the Fathers of Confederation; he was assassinated in 1868. McGee&#x27;s brother Jim was a noted athlete in rugby football and ice hockey, playing the latter with McGee in the 1903–04 season before dying in a horse-riding accident in May 1904. His brother Charles served in the Boer War and, like McGee, died in the First World War. His brother Walter also served in the First World War and was awarded the Military Cross.

After finishing his schooling in Ottawa, McGee joined the Canadian government&#x27;s Department of Indian Affairs. He later assumed a role in the Department of the Interior. In 1904, his promotion within the department led him to briefly retire from ice hockey. Historian Paul Kitchen has suggested that McGee&#x27;s rise in the civil service was aided in part by the connections of his father as a clerk of the Privy Council, and of William Foran, a hockey executive who also worked at the Board of Civil Service Examiners, the body that reviewed government promotions. McGee had a passion for sports; he participated in ice hockey, rugby football, lacrosse, and rowing. He played half-back for the Ottawa City rugby football team, winning the Canadian championship in 1898. He later played quarterback for the team before giving up football in 1900.

==Hockey career==

McGee first earned recognition for his hockey ability during the 1899–1900 season. During this time he played for two teams: the Ottawa Aberdeens, who won the Quebec intermediate championship; and the Ottawa Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) team, who won the Canadian Railway Hockey Union championship. On March 21, 1900, McGee was struck in his left eye by a &quot;lifted puck&quot; during an amateur game for a local CPR team. As a result, he lost vision in his left eye and did not play in the following two seasons, instead working as a referee.

In 1903, McGee decided to return to the sport, despite risking injury to his one good eye. Highly sought after, he joined the Ottawa Hockey Club (also known as the Silver Seven) of the senior Canadian Amateur Hockey League (CAHL). He was the youngest member of the team and at a height of , was small for hockey players of the era. He excelled on the ice and was known to be strong and muscular, which was considered to be an ideal body type for the sport. In his first game with Ottawa, he scored two goals. He finished the 1903 season with 14 goals in six games, second in the league behind Russell Bowie. As Ottawa finished first in the league they were awarded the Stanley Cup and played in challenge games that year. McGee played in all four challenge games and scored seven more goals, tying Jack Marshall for lead goal-scorer during the challenge games, and Ottawa retained the Cup.

Ottawa resigned from the CAHL after four games during the 1904 season due to a dispute over a delayed game; in those four games McGee recorded 12 goals, placing him first on the team in scoring and fifth overall in the league. During a Stanley Cup challenge against the Toronto Marlboros on February 25, 1904, he scored five goals in one game, setting a new record for most goals in a Cup game. He again scored five goals in a game on March 9 against the Brandon Hockey Club. Ottawa played in several Cup challenge series over the season, winning them all. That season, McGee had 21 goals in eight challenge games. In the off-season, McGee&#x27;s brother Jim died in a horse-riding accident. Aware of the dangers of playing hockey, McGee&#x27;s family wanted him to stop in light of Jim&#x27;s death, but he decided to keep playing. 

Despite offers to reconcile by the CAHL, Ottawa joined the Federal Amateur Hockey League (FAHL) for the 1904–05 season. After a brief retirement from the sport owing to his work in the government, McGee returned, playing in six of the eight FAHL games and tying Marshall for best goalscorer in the league, with 17 goals. During the season, Ottawa also played in five Cup challenge games against the Dawson City Nuggets and the Rat Portage Thistles. The Nuggets, who had travelled across Canada from the Yukon, were not considered a strong challenge for Ottawa. The Nuggets lost the first of the two-game series 9–2, and McGee only scored one goal in that game. After the game, the Nuggets&#x27; manager reportedly dismissed McGee&#x27;s talents, saying that he &quot;doesn&#x27;t seem to be any great scorer&quot;. In the next game, on January 16, 1905, McGee scored a record 14 goals in Ottawa&#x27;s 23–2 win. This included eight consecutive goals scored in less than nine minutes. The fourteen goals he scored remain the most ever scored by a single player in a Stanley Cup game. The game was also the most lopsided in Stanley Cup history as Ottawa&#x27;s 23 goals also set a record. Later, it was disclosed that McGee was playing with a fractured wrist, and he missed the first game of the series against the Thistles.

To resolve the disputes among top-level hockey teams in Canada, a new unified league was created in December 1905, the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association (ECAHA), which Ottawa joined. McGee initially retired from hockey before the start of the 1906 season, but returned to the team midway through the campaign. Appearing in seven of the ten league games, McGee finished third in the ECAHA in scoring, with 28 goals. Ottawa finished tied for first in the league with the Montreal Wanderers, setting up a two-game, total-goal series for the championship and the Stanley Cup. Montreal won 12–10, ending the Silver Seven&#x27;s three-year reign. Including two other Cup challenge series played during the season, McGee had 17 goals in six challenge games. After Ottawa lost the Stanley Cup to the Wanderers, McGee retired from hockey at 23 years old. Kitchen suggests that McGee&#x27;s retirement was due to both family pressure and an upcoming promotion he was to receive at the Department of the Interior, which would require his full attention.

===Legacy===
McGee was slightly shorter than the average Canadian man, but he was noted for being strong relative to his size and having a physical, at times rough, style of play. Frank Patrick, a contemporary of McGee, described him as: &quot;Even better than they say he was. He had everything – speed, stickhandling, scoring ability and was a punishing checker. He was strongly built but beautifully proportioned and he had an almost animal rhythm.&quot;

McGee is best known for being a prolific goal-scorer. During his career, he scored 135 goals in 45 games (including both league and challenge). Only one other player, Russell Bowie, rivals his average of three goals per game. With 14 goals against Dawson City, McGee holds the record for the most goals ever scored in a single Cup challenge game. McGee scored five or more goals in eight other senior games, and his highest single-game total in regular-season play was eight on March 3, 1906, against the Montreal Hockey Club.

McGee was one of the original nine players inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame at its founding in 1945. In 1966, he was inducted into the Ottawa Sports Hall of Fame.

==First World War==
Before the First World War, McGee and his brother Charles were members of the Non-Permanent Active Militia of Canada. When Canada entered the war in August 1914, both were mobilized for active duty. It is not definitively known how he was allowed to join the army given his limited vision. The medical officer who examined him wrote that McGee could &quot;see the required distance with either eye&quot;. According to biographer William Houston, McGee&#x27;s nephew said that McGee tricked the doctor. Houston wrote, &quot;When he was asked to cover one eye and read the chart, he covered his blind eye, and when required to cover the other eye, he switched hands instead of eyes.&quot;

McGee was initially assigned to the 43rd Regiment, Duke of Cornwall&#x27;s Own Rifles, though on November 11, 1914, he was transferred to the 21st Infantry Battalion and appointed a Temporary Lieutenant. The Battalion left for England in May 1915, and after spending the summer there, it was transferred to the Western Front in France on September 14, 1915. On December 17, 1915, he incurred a knee injury near Dickebusch when the armoured car he was driving was blown into a ditch by a shell explosion. He was sent back to England on December 28 and spent several months recuperating. On July 7, 1916, he was medically cleared for active duty and he returned to service on August 29. He was given the option to transfer to a clerical post in Le Havre, but chose to return to his battalion, rejoining them on September 5. With his battalion, he took part in the Battle of the Somme.

McGee was killed in action on September 16, 1916, near Courcelette, France. An artillery shell landed on or beside him and he was killed instantly; his body was never recovered. He was later mentioned in dispatches for actions he performed in the late morning on the day of his death. His brother Charles had died in action in May 1915 at the Battle of Festubert. Both of their names are inscribed on the Canadian National Vimy Memorial, along with all other Canadian soldiers killed in France with no known grave.

<text>Kjetil André Aamodt (born 2 September 1971) is a former World Cup alpine ski racer from Norway, a champion in the Olympics, World Championships, and World Cup. He is one of the most successful alpine ski racers from Norway.

==Biography==
Born in Oslo to Finn Aamodt (former head coach of Norway&#x27;s alpine skiing team), Aamodt is the only alpine skier to win 8 Olympic medals, and has won 5 World Championship gold medals as well as 21 individual World Cup events. Described as an all-round alpine skier, Aamodt participated in all alpine skiing disciplines in the World Cup and World Championships, and is one of only five male alpine skiers to have won a World Cup race in all five disciplines.

Aamodt&#x27;s combined career total of twenty World Championship and Olympic medals is an all-time best. He is the second-youngest male alpine skier to win an Olympic gold medal (age 20 in 1992; Toni Sailer was two months younger in 1956). Until 2014, he was also the oldest alpine skier to win an Olympic gold medal. For almost six years, Aamodt led the all-time Marathon World Cup ranking, with a total of 13,252 points earned from 1989 to 2006 – until 14 March 2012, when Austrian Benjamin Raich overtook him with a fifth place in the downhill at the 2012 World Cup final in Schladming to total 13,281 points, earned from 1998.
Another all-time best is his 231 World Cup top-ten results, 9 ahead of Benjamin Raich.

By winning the super-G race at the 2006 Olympics, Aamodt became the first male alpine skier to win four gold medals in the Olympics. (Toni Sailer and Jean-Claude Killy both swept the three alpine events at a single Olympics, and Alberto Tomba won three gold medals over two Olympics.)

Aamodt had 19 Olympic and World Championship medals stolen from him. The medals were taken in August 2003 by burglars who broke into a safe in his father&#x27;s home. The five-time world champion and winner of four Olympic gold medals later revealed they were recovered by an anonymous helper over the internet.

Aamodt announced the conclusion of his career on live television on 6 January 2007, with hundreds of fellow athletes in attendance, at the Norwegian Sports Gala (Idrettsgallaen) where he had been selected as awardee of the year for 2006.

Aamodt now runs a ski race camp in Gaustablikk, Norway, and does public speaking.

==Legacy==
In February 2015 Aamodt (and Lasse Kjus) were selected as recipients of the Legends of Honor by the Vail Valley Foundation, and inducted into the International Ski Racing Hall of Fame.

<text>Richard L. Dugger was secretary of the Florida Department of Corrections from 1987 to 1991, when Harry K. Singletary, Jr. took over.

Dugger was warden of Florida State Prison from 1982 to 1987, when he was appointed Secretary of the Department of Corrections by then Florida governor Bob Martinez. During his tenure, the department started a large campaign to combat prison overcrowding.

In 1999, Dugger was appointed deputy director of institutions for the Florida Department of Corrections, replacing Stan Czerniak. A year later, he was appointed director of institutions for the Florida Department of Corrections.

Dugger was born in Jacksonville, Florida, on January 25, 1943, and resided in Raiford, Florida, until graduation from Bradford County High School in 1961. In his words, he became a &quot;college drop-out&quot; in 1964 and began his career with the Florida Department of Corrections as a correctional officer at Florida State Prison, East Unit. In 1966, he enlisted in the U.S. Army, 20th Special Forces, to begin a military career lasting 20 years.

Dugger retired after a 30-year career in 1995. He returned to work for the Department of Corrections serving in various positions from 1999 to 2005 and again from 2006 to 2007.

Dugger was equally proud of his military career. He had many stories about parachuting into various countries around the world. He was most proud of completing the Army Combat Diver Program in his 40s. He retired from the Army at the rank of sergeant major. He died at the age of 72 in Tallahassee, Florida, on August 20, 2015.

<text>William Waldorf Astor II, 3rd Viscount Astor (13 August 1907 – 7 March 1966) was an English businessman and Conservative Party politician. He was also a member of the Astor family.

== Background and education ==
William was the eldest son of Waldorf Astor and Nancy Witcher Langhorne (by marriage, Viscountess Astor). He was educated at Eton and at New College, Oxford.

== Political career ==
In 1932, Astor was appointed secretary to Victor Bulwer-Lytton, 2nd Earl of Lytton, at a League of Nations Committee of Enquiry in what was then known as Manchuria. First elected to the House of Commons in 1935, he served as a Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Fulham East until 1945. Between 1936 and 1937 he was Parliamentary Private Secretary to the First Lord of the Admiralty, Samuel Hoare, who was then made Home Secretary in the new cabinet of Neville Chamberlain in 1937.

In World War II, he served as a naval intelligence officer, acquiring no distinction, but gaining many influential contacts. He returned as the Conservative MP for Wycombe in the 1951 general election, serving for ten months. On his father&#x27;s death in 1952, he inherited his peerages, becoming the 3rd Viscount Astor and Baron Astor, with a seat in the House of Lords. This forced a by-election in Wycombe, which was won by the Conservative candidate John Hall.

Astor then took over the family&#x27;s Cliveden estate in Buckinghamshire, where he and his family continued to live until 1966. Active in thoroughbred horse racing, he inherited Cliveden Stud, a horse farm and breeding operation in the village of Taplow near Maidenhead.

During the 1963 Profumo affair, Astor was accused of having an affair with Mandy Rice-Davies. In response to being told during one of the trials arising out of the scandal that Astor had denied having an affair with her, Rice-Davies famously replied, &quot;Well he would, wouldn&#x27;t he?&quot;

==Personal life and death==
Astor married three times:

William married Sarah Norton (20 January 1920 – 4 February 2013; daughter of Richard, 6th Baron Grantley) on 14 June 1945 and they were divorced in 1953. They had one son together:
* William Astor, 4th Viscount Astor (William Waldorf Astor III; born 27 December 1951); he married Annabel Jones on 14 January 1976.

William married Phillipa Victoria Hunloke (10 December 1930 – 20 July 2005, whose maternal grandfather was Victor Cavendish, 9th Duke of Devonshire) on 26 April 1955 and they were divorced on 3 June 1960. They had one daughter together:
* Emily Mary Astor (born 9 June 1956)

William Astor married, finally Bronwen Alun-Pugh on 14 October 1960. They had two daughters:
* Janet Elizabeth Astor (born 1 December 1961); she married the Earl of March and Kinrara, later the 11th Duke of Richmond, on 30 November 1991.
* Pauline Marian Astor (born 26 March 1964)

Astor died in Nassau, Bahamas, aged 58 from a heart attack and was buried in the Octagon Temple at Cliveden. His son succeeded him in the viscountcy.

<doc id="1302734" wikidata="Q1651276" url="?curid=1302734" title="Oshikundu">
<text>Oshikundu or Ontaku is a traditional Namibian drink made from fermented millet (mahangu) flour, brans and malted sorghum flour mixed with lukewarm water. It is made from cereal. Ontaku has short life span and it has to be consumed within the same day, preferably within 6 hours once its ready. Ontaku is more common among &quot;Aawambo&quot; people and in some part of &quot;Kavango Region&quot;. The knowledge of creating Ontaku has been passed orally from one generation to the other orally, hence existing through generations of Aawambo. It is widely sold in open markets and mostly associated with rural areas and northern Namibia. Oshikundu can be served with porridge to bolster its flavor and nutritional content in the absence of heartier foods.

The combination is left to ferment for several hours at room temperature. Once Oshikundu is ready to drink it becomes brown with a thick texture. It is nutritious but has a short shelf life, usually being a home-brewed drink enjoyed daily.

A study carried out in 2001 by the Department of Food Science at the University of Namibia revealed that it was possible to produce a dry mix containing malted pearl millet and sorghum, that would be nutritionally enhanced with bambara nut. This mix could then be sold for making oshikundu.

<doc id="1302736" wikidata="Q1755889" url="?curid=1302736" title="Summer of Darkness">
<text>Summer of Darkness is the second studio album by American Christian metal band Demon Hunter, released through Solid State on May 4, 2004. In the first week, the album sold 4,247 copies.

Vocalist Ryan Clark described &quot;Summer of Darkness&quot; in a 2003 interview as being heavier than Demon Hunter&#x27;s self-titled debut album. The band&#x27;s first album, released in October 2002, was recorded in drop C tuning while &quot;Summer of Darkness&quot; was dropped down to drop B tuning. He also cited that the group had more time to record than with their previous release. Guest vocalists, who were friends of the band, appear on four songs on the album and include Mike Williams, Howard Jones, Brock Lindow, and Trevor McNevan. &quot;Summer of Darkness&quot; is Demon Hunter&#x27;s only album with Kris McCaddon on lead guitar, as well as the band&#x27;s first album with bass guitarist Jon Dunn and the last to have Jesse Sprinkle on drums.

The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Not Ready to Die&quot;, received a music video and significant airplay on MTV2&#x27;s &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot; and Fuse TV. In June 2004, Demon Hunter began touring the United States in promotion of &quot;Summer of Darkness&quot;. This included all major cities and extended to the East Coast where they had not previously performed. The album was later included on Demon Hunter&#x27;s &quot;Double Take&quot;1 (2007) and &quot;Death, a Destination&quot;2 (2011) compilations.

==Track listing==

: Live recording appears on both &quot;45 Days&quot; (2008) and &quot;Live in Nashville&quot; (2009)

<text>The 2000 United States presidential election in New York took place on November 7, 2000, as part of the 2000 United States presidential election. Voters chose 33 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.

New York was won by Incumbent Democratic Vice President Al Gore in a landslide victory; Gore received 60.22% of the vote to Republican George W. Bush&#x27;s 35.22%, a Democratic victory margin of 25.00%. This marked the first time since 1964 that a Democratic presidential candidate won more than 60% of the vote in New York State, and only the second time in history, solidifying New York&#x27;s status as a solid blue state in the 21st century. New York weighed in as about 25% more Democratic than the national average in the 2000 election.

==Analysis==
, this is the last election in which the Democratic candidate won Montgomery County. This is the second consecutive election that a Democrat won every borough of New York City, which has occurred once since, in 2012.

Bush became the first Republican to win the White House without carrying Onondaga, Cayuga, St. Lawrence, Broome, Monroe, or Nassau Counties since these counties&#x27; founding in 1794, 1799, 1802, 1806, 1821, and 1899, respectively, the first to do so without carrying Clinton, Franklin, Rensselear, or Richmond Counties or any borough of New York City since Herbert Hoover in 1928, the first to do so without carrying Rockland, Seneca or Westchester Counties since Benjamin Harrison in 1888, the first to do so without carrying Sullivan County since James A. Garfield in 1880, and the first to do so without carrying Columbia, Suffolk, or Ulster Counties since Rutherford Hayes in 1876.

Gore won an overwhelming landslide in fiercely Democratic New York City, taking 1,703,364 votes to George W. Bush&#x27;s 398,726, a 77.90% - 18.23% victory. Gore carried all five boroughs of New York City. Excluding New York City&#x27;s votes, Gore still would have carried New York State, but by a smaller margin, receiving 2,404,543 votes to Bush&#x27;s 2,004,648, giving Gore a 54.53% - 45.47% win.

==Electors==
Technically the voters of New York cast their ballots for electors: representatives to the Electoral College. New York is allocated 33 electors because it has 31 congressional districts and 2 senators. All candidates who appear on the ballot or qualify to receive write-in votes must submit a list of 33 electors, who pledge to vote for their candidate and his or her running mate. Whoever wins the majority of votes in the state is awarded all 33 electoral votes. Their chosen electors then vote for president and vice president. Although electors are pledged to their candidate and running mate, they are not obligated to vote for them. An elector who votes for someone other than his or her candidate is known as a faithless elector.

The electors of each state and the District of Columbia met on December 18, 2000 to cast their votes for president and vice president. The Electoral College itself never meets as one body. Instead the electors from each state and the District of Columbia met in their respective capitols.

<doc id="1302753" wikidata="Q234149" url="?curid=1302753" title="Danielle Darrieux">
<text>Danielle Yvonne Marie Antoinette Darrieux (; 1 May 1917 – 17 October 2017) was a French actress of stage, television and film, as well as a singer and dancer.

Beginning in 1931, she appeared in more than 110 films. She was one of France&#x27;s great movie stars and her eight-decade career was among the longest in film history.

==Life and career==

Darrieux was born in Bordeaux, France, during World War I, the daughter of Marie-Louise (Witkowski) and Jean Darrieux, a medical doctor who was serving in the French Army. Her mother was born in Algeria. Her father died when she was seven years old.

Raised in Paris, she studied the cello at the Conservatoire de Musique. At 14, she won a part in the musical film &quot;Le Bal&quot; (1931). Her beauty combined with her singing and dancing ability led to numerous other offers; the film &quot;Mayerling&quot; (1936) brought her to prominence.

In 1935, Darrieux married director/screenwriter Henri Decoin, who encouraged her to try Hollywood. She signed a seven-year contract with Universal Studios to star in &quot;The Rage of Paris&quot; (1938) opposite Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. Afterwards, she elected to return to Paris.

Under the German occupation of France during World War II, Darrieux continued to perform, a decision that was severely criticized by her compatriots. However, it is reported that her brother had been threatened with deportation by Alfred Greven, the German manager of Continental, the only film production company permitted in occupied France. She received a divorce and then fell in love with Porfirio Rubirosa, a Dominican Republic diplomat and notorious womanizer. They married in 1942 in Vichy in a ceremony attended by other diplomats that resided in the city at the time. His anti-Nazi opinions resulted in his forced residence in Germany. In exchange for Rubirosa&#x27;s freedom, Darrieux agreed to make a promotional trip in Berlin. The couple lived in Switzerland until the end of the war, and divorced in 1947. She married scriptwriter Georges Mitsikidès in 1948, and they lived together until his death in 1991.
Darrieux appeared in the MGM musical &quot;Rich, Young and Pretty&quot; (1951). Joseph L. Mankiewicz lured her back to Hollywood to star in &quot;5 Fingers&quot; (1952) with James Mason. Upon returning to France, she appeared in Max Ophüls&#x27; &quot;The Earrings of Madame de...&quot; (1953) with Charles Boyer, and &quot;The Red and the Black&quot; (1954) with Gérard Philippe. She starred in &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot; (1955), whose theme of uninhibited sexuality led to its being proscribed by Catholic censors in the United States. She played a supporting role in her last American film, United Artists&#x27; epic &quot;Alexander the Great&quot; (1956) starring Richard Burton and Claire Bloom.

At the request of director Lewis Gilbert, Darrieux worked in England to shoot &quot;The Greengage Summer&quot; (1961) with Kenneth More. In 1963, she starred in the romantic comedy &quot;La Robe Mauve de Valentine&quot; at the Chatelet Theatre in Paris. The play was adapted from the novel by Françoise Sagan.

In Jacques Demy&#x27;s film musical &quot;The Young Girls of Rochefort&quot; (1966) her role was the only one in which a principal actor in any of Demy&#x27;s film-musicals sang his or her own musical parts. (All other actors had a separate person dub their singing parts.) During the 1960s, she also was a concert singer.

In 1970, Darrieux replaced Katharine Hepburn in the Broadway musical &quot;Coco&quot;, based on the life of Coco Chanel, but the play, essentially a showcase for Hepburn, soon folded without her. In 1971 and 1972 she also appeared in the short-lived productions of &quot;Ambassador&quot;. She worked again with Demy for his film &quot;Une chambre en ville&quot; (1982), an opera-like musical melodrama reminiscent of the director&#x27;s earlier work &quot;The Umbrellas of Cherbourg&quot; (&quot;Les Parapluies de Cherbourg&quot;, 1964). Once again, Darrieux provided her own vocals for her songs.

==Honors==
For her long service to the motion picture industry, in 1985 she was given an Honorary César Award. She continued to work, her career spanning eight decades, most recently providing the voice of the protagonist&#x27;s grandmother in the animated feature &quot;Persepolis&quot; (2007), which deals with the impact of the Islamic revolution on a girl&#x27;s life as she grows to adulthood in Iran.

==Death==
Danielle Darrieux died on 17 October 2017, due to complications from a fall, five months after turning 100 that May.

<text>Claude Fleury (6 December 1640, Paris – 14 July 1723, Paris), was a French priest, jurist, and ecclesiastical historian.

Destined for the bar, he was educated at the elite, Jesuit College de Clermont (now that of Louis-le-Grand) in Paris. In 1658 he was accepted as an attorney to the &quot;parlement&quot; of Paris, and for nine years practiced law. There he caught the attention of preacher at the royal court, Bishop Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet, who persuaded him to study theology and receive holy orders. Under Bossuet&#x27;s patronage, he attracted the attention of the king, Louis XIV, who appointed him the tutor of the princes of Conti in 1672 and soon thereafter of the count of Vermandois, one of the king&#x27;s bastards. For his service Fleury was awarded the Cistercian abbey of Loc-Dieu, in the diocese of Rodez.

Fleury&#x27;s aristocratic teaching duties expanded in 1689 when he was appointed sub-preceptor of the dukes of Burgundy, of Anjou, and of Berry. He thus curried favor with Fénelon, their chief tutor. In 1696 he was elected to fill the place of La Bruyère in the Académie française; and on the completion of the education of the young princes the king reassigned to him the priory of Argenteuil, in the diocese of Paris (1706), a more lucrative benefice than Loc-Dieu.

About this time he began his great work, the first of the kind in France, and one for which he had been collecting materials for thirty years—the &quot;Histoire ecclésiastique&quot;. Fleury&#x27;s evident intention was to write a history of the church for all classes of society; but at the time in which his great work appeared it was less religion than theology that absorbed the attention of the clergy and the educated public; and his work accordingly appealed to the student rather than to the popular reader, dwelling as it does very particularly on questions of doctrine, of discipline, of supremacy, and of rivalry between the priesthood and the imperial power.

Nevertheless, it had a great success. The first edition, printed at Paris in 20 volumes (4to), 1691, was followed by many others, among which may be mentioned that of Brussels, in 32 vols (8vo), 1692, and that of Nîmes, in 25 vols (8vo), 1778 to 1780. The work of Fleury only comes down to the year 1414. It was continued by Jean Claude Fabre and Goujet down to 1595, in 16 vols. (4to). In consulting the work of Fleury and its supplement, the general table of contents, published by Rondet, Paris, 1758, 1 vol. (4to) will be found very useful. Translations have been made of the entire work into Latin, German and Italian. The Latin translation, published at Augsburg, 1758–1759, 85 vols. (8vo), carries the work down to 1684.

Fleury was appointed confessor to the young King Louis XV in 1716, because, as the duke of Orleans said, he was neither Jansenist nor Molinist, nor Ultramontanist, but Catholic. His great learning was equaled by the modest simplicity of his life and the uprightness of his conduct.

Fleury left many works besides his &quot;Histoire ecclésiastique&quot;. The following deserve special mention:
*&quot;Histoire du droit français&quot; (1674, 12mo)
*&quot;Mœurs des Israelites&quot; (1681, 12mo)
*&quot;Mœurs des Chrétiens&quot; (1682, 12mo)
*&quot;Catechisme Historique, contenant en abregé l&#x27;histoire sainte et la doctrine Cretienne&quot; (1683, 2vo)
*&quot;Traité du choix et de la méthode des études&quot; (1686, 2 vols 12mo)
*&quot;Les Devoirs des maîtres et des domestiques&quot; (1688, 12mo)
A number of the smaller works were published in one volume at Paris in 1807. The Roman Congregation of the Index condemned his &quot;Catéchisme historique&quot; (1679) and the &quot;Institution du droit ecclésiastique&quot; (1687).

<doc id="1302758" wikidata="Q1561708" url="?curid=1302758" title="Stara Gradiška concentration camp">
<text>Stara Gradiška was a concentration and extermination camp in the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) during World War II. The camp was specially constructed for women and children of Serb, Jewish and Romani ethnicity. Victims also included communist and anti-fascist Croats and Bosniaks. It was established by the Ustaše regime in 1941 at the Stara Gradiška prison near the eponymous village as the fifth subcamp of the Jasenovac concentration camp.

According to the list of victims by name of KCL Jasenovac, the Jasenovac memorial site, which includes research , the names and data for 12,790 victims of the camp have been established.

==Systematic killing of inmates==
The camp was guarded by the Croatian Ustaše, including some female troops. Inmates were killed using different means, including firearms, mallets and knives. At the &quot;K&quot; or &quot;Kula&quot; unit, Serbian and Jewish women, with weak or little children, were starved and/or tortured at the &quot;Gagro Hotel&quot;, a cellar which Ustaša Nikola Gagro used as a place of torture. Other inmates in the Kula unit were poisoned with gas.

Gas experiments were conducted initially at veterinary stables near the &quot;Economy&quot; unit, where horses and then humans were poisoned using sulphur dioxide and later Zyklon B. Gassing was also tested on children in the yard, where the camp commandant, Ustaša sergeant Ante Vrban, viewed its effects. Most gassing deaths occurred in the attics of &quot;the infamous tower&quot;, where several thousand children from the Kozara region were killed in May, and 2000 more in June 1942. Subsequently, smaller groups of 400-600 children, and a few men and women, were gassed. At his trial, Vrban confirmed that Zyklon gas was used.

Witness Cijordana Friedlender (aka Jordana Fritlander), who was a guard at the camp, testified:At that time fresh women and children came daily to the Camp at Stara Gradiška. About fourteen days later, Vrban [the Commandant of the Camp] ordered all children to be separated from their mothers and put into one room. Ten of us were told to carry them there in blankets. The children crawled about the room, and one child put an arm and leg through the doorway, so that the door could not be closed. Vrban shouted: &#x27;Push it!&#x27; When I did not do that, he banged the door and crushed the child&#x27;s leg. Then he took the child by its whole-leg, and banged it on the wall until it was dead. After that we continued carrying the children in. When the room was full, Vrban brought poison gas and killed them all.

According to witness Milka Zabičić, the gassing stopped due to a scheduled visit by a Red Cross delegation in 1943, which did not arrive until June 1944. Gas-vans were constructed to kill Serb and Jewish women and children who came to Stara Gradiška from the Đakovo camp in June–July 1942. A witness, Dragutin Roller, who was a camp inmate, stated that guard Dinko Šakić &quot;directed his guards to pack women and children into the vans, fitted a rubber hose from the exhaust to the interior and drove around and around the camp until the passengers were dead&quot; and that &quot;they killed at least half the group like this as soon as they arrived&quot;.

==Cruelty==
Stara Gradiška became notorious for crimes committed against women and children. Examples included the torture that took place in cellar 3, the &quot;Gagro Hotel&quot;, where inmates were starved, tortured and then strangled to death using piano wire. At Šakić&#x27;s trial, witness Ivo Senjanović recalled how people were locked there without food or water: &quot;The people were gradually dying. It was horrible to hear them cry for help.&quot; As for the conditions, witness Cadik Danon said:At once we spread our blankets and lay down to recover our strength. Around noon they drove us out into the yard and distributed the portion of cattle turnip with water without salt or grease; everything was the same as in Jasenovac. Immediately after lunch, they thrust us into the dungeon and locked us in.

The most infamous staff included Nikola Gagro, Ante Vrban, Maja Buzdon, Jozo Stojčić and, notably, the commander, a Franciscan friar/military chaplain, Miroslav Filipović-Majstorović, who killed scores of women and children with his bare hands. The treatment of inmates was so horrific that on the night of 29 August 1942, bets were made among the prison guards as to who could liquidate the largest number of inmates. Petar Brzica, one of the guards reportedly cut the throats of 1,360 prisoners with a butcher knife. A gold watch, a silver service, a roasted suckling pig, and wine were among his rewards. The guards included females (who were sisters or wives of the male guards) who were known for their cruelty. The worst was Nada Luburić, sister of the first commandant of Jasenovac, Maks Luburić, and wife of Dinko Šakić.

Andrija Artuković who was Minister of Interior of the NDH ordered sodium hydroxide to be added to the food of the children in order to exterminate them in a timely fashion. The murder of children was deemed a priority by the NDH as they saw Serbian children as &#x27;seeds of the beast&#x27;.

==Clearing the camp==

In early April 1945, when the Partisans were fighting nearby Stara Gradiška, the Ustaše began clearing the camp, killing some of the inmates and transporting others to Lepoglava and from there to Jasenovac, where they were to be exterminated. Several survivors, like Šimo (or Šime) Klaić, who stressed at Šakić&#x27;s trial that Lepoglava &quot;was horrible, as if all the evil from Stara Gradiška and Jasenovac had concentrated there&quot;, fled from the train cart in which they were to be transported to Jasenovac. Klaić later learned, as he testified in the court, that the other two carts in the transport were torched in Jasenovac. The camp was liberated in April 1945 by the Partisans.

==List of notable prisoners==
* Vlado Singer, Croatian politician and member of the Ustaše movement.
* Magda Bošković, Croatian communist, Partisan and member of the women&#x27;s rights movement.
* Nada Dimić, Croatian Communist and Partisan activist of ethnic Serb descent.
* Viktor Budicki, doctor and surviving son of Croatian motorsport pioneer Ferdinand Budicki, died in a 1944 camp typhoid epidemic and was given honourable marked burial for his medical services.

<text>is a horizontally scrolling shooter video game produced by Irem and released in arcades in 1989. It runs on M72 and M81 hardware. Activision released home computer conversions in 1990.

==Gameplay==

The player controls King Kayus, who rides a large dragon named Bahamoot. Bahamoot is immune to enemy attacks, capable of blocking most projectiles and damaging enemies on contact; Kayus, however, is not, but is armed with a forward-firing crossbow.

Bahamoot&#x27;s body is flexible and responds to Kayus&#x27; movement, enabling Kayus to use Bahamoot as a mobile shield or as a whip-like weapon. The player can also circle the tail around a group of enemies to kill them. The tail of the yellow or blue dragon can be coiled around the player to offer almost complete invulnerability for a limited time.

Bahamoot can also spit fireballs. By holding the fire button down, the dragon will build up fire in its mouth; the longer the button is held down, the more powerful the fireball will be. There are four levels of fireball power; at its strongest, the fireball resembles a dragon&#x27;s head. The game also contains some platforming elements - the human is able to dismount on horizontal platforms.

Power-ups comes in the form of orbs acquired by shooting small green dragons that appear intermittently throughout stages, or they can be collected from the ground on foot. There are four different types of orbs, each of will change Bahamoot to a different color and grant him a new attack power. The red orb enables the dragon to breathe a flame. Gold enables Bahamoot&#x27;s body to fire crescents in all directions. Silver enables the dragon to produce up to four miniature dragons, which home in on enemies. Blue enables Bahamoot to fire downward bolts of electricity from its underside. The player can further enhance Bahamoot&#x27;s powers by picking up the same type of orb up to three times.

<text>Zarda, commonly known as Power Princess, is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Multiple versions of the character have appeared, each from alternate realities in Marvel&#x27;s multiverse.
==Publication history==
The original version of the character was created by J. M. DeMatteis and Don Perlin, and first appeared in &quot;Defenders&quot; #112 (October 1982) as a member of the Squadron Supreme, an analog of the Justice League. More recently, the character joined the reality-hopping Exiles.

Another version of the character appeared in Marvel&#x27;s MAX imprint title &quot;Supreme Power&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==
===Squadron Supreme===

Princess Zarda of Earth-712 lived on Utopia Isle, a small island in the southern sea, untouched by outside civilization. The Utopians believe themselves to be the result of genetic experimentation conducted upon humanity by the alien Kree; they are, indeed, the equivalent on the Squadron&#x27;s Earth of the Inhumans. While most humans were making flint spearheads, the Utopians developed an advanced utopia based on peace, fellowship and experience or learning. After the outside world made the first atom bomb, the Utopians believed their way of life was in jeopardy. Building a starship, they left Earth to find a new home. Zarda chose to remain behind as their sole emissary to the Earth, a role she had assumed some years earlier as Power Princess. During this time, she was a member of the World War II team known as the Golden Agency, along with fellow members American Eagle and Professor Imam, the Sorcerer Supreme of the Squadron&#x27;s Earth.

Living in Capitol City, she became the common-law wife of Howard Shelton, a sailor whom she met during &quot;the war&quot;. Howard was the sole survivor of a sinking ship and the first outsider Zarda met. Howard aged normally while Zarda appears to be the same age as she was when they met, 50–60 years earlier.

As a member of the Squadron Supreme, Zarda became brainwashed by the Overmind. She battled the Defenders, but was cured. She then battled the Overmind and Null, the Living Darkness alongside the Defenders.

To prevent such a thing from happening again, she resolved with the Squadron to assume control of the government of the United States of her world. With the Squadron, she battled the Institute of Evil. For a time, the Hyperion of Earth-616 masqueraded as his Squadron Supreme counterpart and developed an attraction to Zarda. Disgusted that she was already committed to the elderly Shelton, the villainous Hyperion suffocated Shelton and began romancing Zarda. Upon the return of the Earth-712 Hyperion, the truth was revealed and the impostor was destroyed. Although initially confused about her feelings for her teammate, Zarda and Hyperion eventually began a romantic relationship. Zarda then assumed leadership of the Squadron. Zarda participated in the final battle between Nighthawk, who had turned against the Squadron, and his Redeemers. She then disbanded the Squadron.

Defending the Earth-712 against an attack by the Nth Man, Power Princess and the Squadron Supreme were stranded on Earth-616. They encountered Quasar, and relocated to Project Pegasus. Power Princess was among the Earth heroes trying to save New York City from Eon&#x27;s dying body. Some time later, with the help of the Avengers, the Squadron Supreme were returned to Earth-712. On arrival, they find a dictatorial regime has taken over the world in their absence, and they have become fugitives.

Proteus, an enemy of the interdimensional Exiles, showed up in the Squadron&#x27;s reality and tricked them into battling the Exiles, taking advantage of the distraction to move on to another reality. With the Exiles&#x27; assistance, the Squadron expose the corrupt government. Power Princess then invites herself into the Exiles, and under her guidance the team eventually defeats Proteus. Power Princess remains with the Exiles for a time to continue fixing damaged realities, but eventually leaves to return to the Squadron Supreme.

Eventually, Earth-712 is destroyed by an Incursion, two realities colliding into one another. Zarda is the last survivor of her universe, escaping via an interdimensional portal. However, in transit she is attacked by an alternate version of herself called Warrior Woman, who drains Zarda of her energy and powers and leaves her for dead. Zarda survives, landing on Earth-616, and dedicates herself to stopping her evil duplicate.

===Supreme Power===

This Zarda debuted in &quot;Supreme Power&quot; #2. Apparently a Greek goddess who slept in a mausoleum for millennia, at one point she wakes up and finds the injured Hyperion, healing him. She alludes to having similar origins to Hyperion (both are aliens) and a mission to colonize and conquer the planet, but she is quite erratic, confusing her memories with allegory.

After separating, Zarda goes on a rampage, disregarding human life and private property. She attempted to remove Doctor Spectrum&#x27;s power prism but the crystal&#x27;s intellect contacted her. It informed her that she was &quot;broken&quot; in some way (apparently referring to her seeming insanity) and that it could not fix her despite her request to do so. She then was attacked by Amphibian in retaliation for harming Spectrum. Doc Spectrum subsequently has no memory of the exchange, revealing further that his prism has the ability to control him when it wants to. Later, Zarda kills a woman and steals her identification in hopes of starting anew, while working in a women&#x27;s clothing store.

After that she made herself known to the federal government of the United States, as Claire Debussy (it is implied that Zarda murdered the real Claire Debussy and assumed her identity, as a scorch mark in the shape of a young human female is seen on a wall overlooking a pile of ash in her apartment.) But running her background down is hard. She said that her codename is Zarda, but at her power level the government did not push it. Later a liaison officer asks her to fill in some identification and non-disclosure forms, but Zarda lies to the officer, saying she can not remember details due to an &quot;accident&quot;. After General Richard Alexander asks why she calls herself Zarda, thinking it to be an old nickname, he informs her that focus groups came up with &quot;Power Princess&quot;. After he asked her what she thought about the name, she said &quot;Princess of Power&quot; would be better, but the General said that it was already copyrighted (referring to &quot;She-Ra: Princess of Power&quot;, a cartoon related to &quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot;).

An African general named John M&#x27;Butu, a fast-rising tribal leader gifted with a powerful psychic suggestion ability and calling himself the Voice, is leading a genocidal campaign in the Salawe region of Uganda. The US government identifies him as a superhuman after he survives an assassination attempt. The team is sent to the region to assassinate him, but early in the fight, Hyperion, Doctor Spectrum and Amphibian are affected by M&#x27;Butu&#x27;s power to control anyone who hears his voice. M&#x27;Butu commands the trio to hunt down their comrades. Zarda immediately notices that there is another voice in Hyperion&#x27;s head and not the One True Voice. Zarda manages to free Doctor Spectrum by calling to the voice within the Power Prism, which takes control of Spectrum, and frees Hyperion.

Later the Squadron are then ordered to take down insurgents in Ilam Province in Iran, an operation called &quot;Long Walk&quot;. Zarda goes on a killing rampage. After Stanley Stewart sees her killing three unarmed soldiers, calling them harmless, Zarda says &quot;Harmless, yes, for that minute. Now they are harmless tomorrow&quot;. After seeing Inertia help a little girl find and kill four men of her tribe who stoned her mother and older sisters to death after they were raped by insurgents, Zarda said Inertia is now like her.

Hyperion gives a press conference in Los Angeles of the &quot;Long Walk&quot; mission, during which he is confronted by Redstone. During their fight, Zarda intervenes, beating Redstone badly, but stops short of killing him when Hyperion has her fly Redstone&#x27;s nuclear warhead into the stratosphere to prevent it from detonating in Los Angeles. She even survives the direct nuclear blast, something Hyperion obviously would not survive so easily.

The Squadron Supreme invade the Ultimate Universe after their world is devastated by a threat that originated there. At the resolution of this conflict, Zarda decides to remain in the Ultimate universe to keep an eye on things.

Later she fights and easily beats the Ultimate Universe&#x27;s equivalent of the Wrecking Crew as well as the Hulk. After the short battle with the Hulk, she and the Hulk have sex. She also contemplates how the local heroes keep her from simply killing those who annoy her. She recalls how she often goes naked in her homeworld, not seeing a need to cover up her own beauty. Zarda remains with the Ultimates during the &quot;Ultimatum&quot; event, assisting Reed Richards with retrieving Nick Fury from her own universe. When Loki returns to get revenge on the Ultimates, Zarda is hypnotized along with the other female members of the Ultimates into attacking her teammates by Amora the Enchantress. When Amora is killed, Zarda is freed, and returns to her own universe.

Zarda, along with the rest of her universe&#x27;s squadron, is killed by the forces of the Cabal during an Incursion.

During the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; storyline, Zarda is shown to live in the Supremia Province in Battleworld. She is later killed during a battle with Squadron Sinister of Utopolis during an invasion of Supremia.

===Squadron Supreme of America===
A variation of the Zarda Shelton version of Power Princess appears as a member of the Squadron Supreme of America. This version is a simulacrum created by Mephisto and programmed by the Power Elite. Power Princess was programmed to be a lustful power woman from Utopia Isle who wore a special necklace to dampen her powers when in her secret identity as a professional boxer.

In the team&#x27;s first mission, Power Princess and the Squadron Supreme of America fought Namor and the Defenders of the Deep, when they targeted a Roxxon oil platform off the coast of Alaska.

Then, the Squadron Supreme visited another oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico. The Squadron Supreme then made short work of Namor and the Defenders of the Deep.

During the &quot;War of the Realms&quot; storyline, Zarda was in the middle of a boxing class when she and the other members of the Squadron Supreme of America were summoned to Washington D.C., where Phil Coulson brought them up to speed with Malekith the Accursed&#x27;s invasion. Power Princess and the Squadron Supreme of America fight an army of Rock Trolls and Frost Giants. After the Squadron Supreme caused the Frost Giants to retreat, Coulson sends them to Ohio, which has become a battleground.

Power Princess was with the Squadron Supreme when they attempted to apprehend Black Panther, when he infiltrated the Pentagon to confront Coulson.

==Powers and abilities==
===Squadron Supreme===
Zarda possesses superhuman strength, agility, speed, reflexes, and has the ability to fly. Her aging process is extremely slowed, although she stated that she does not age at all in the &quot;Exiles&quot; series. She is able to drain the life force of others.

Zarda carries a transparent shield of Utopian design that can block tank shells and be used to redirect energy, and which she can throw so that its edges are able to slice through metal.

Power Princess has extensive experience in hand-to-hand combat (according to her, she has over five centuries of combat experience) and is skilled in discus throwing. She has undergone advanced graduate level studies in both Utopia Isle and Cosmopolis.

===Supreme Power===
In addition to similar physical abilities she shares with Hyperion, such as supersonic flight, super-strength, greatly enhanced reflexes, superhuman senses and nigh-invulnerability, this Zarda can drain the life-force of others to rejuvenate herself. She uses a similar life force transfer to heal Hyperion when he receives life-threatening injuries. While it is possible to hurt her, she apparently even survived a direct nuclear explosion through a combination of her nigh-invulnerability and her life-force transference capabilities. Like Hyperion, she is able to survive the vacuum of space unaided for a considerable amount of time, enabling at least interplanetary travel via her flight capabilities.

* The Shebin spinning and weaving factory in Menoufia in the Nile Delta was on strike against/locked out by its new non-Egyptian owners in the wake of the 2011 revolution. Workers and maybe the military now in control of the state were favoring re-nationalization, according to one report. &quot;[L] iberal economic policy is tarred with [the old regime&#x27;s] corruption,&quot; said Michael Wahid Hanna, in Cairo for the U.S.-based Century Foundation. Indorama, the new Indonesian/Thai owner of Shebin, was not quoted in the report. Looking further back to 2000, &quot;well considered public spinners&quot; Shebin El Kom and STIA, were then considered to have a &quot;redundant labor problem ... [but] would otherwise be attractive privatization buying or leasing opportunities for private investors.&quot; In 2011, STIA, also known as El Nasr Wool &amp; Selected Textiles, of Alexandria, remained &quot;one of the largest public sector textiles companies.&quot;

<doc id="1302779" wikidata="Q302446" url="?curid=1302779" title="Lolo Ferrari">
<text>Lolo Ferrari (born Ève Valois; 9 February 1963 – 5 March 2000), was a French dancer, actress, and singer billed as &quot;the woman with the largest breast implants in the world&quot;.
She entered the international limelight in 1995, appearing in the French &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; in 1996 and 1999. Her death in 2000 was ruled a suicide.

==Background==
Born in Clermont-Ferrand, Puy-de-Dôme, France, Ève Valois was raised in the resort town of La Baule on the Atlantic coast. She often talked about her unhappy childhood, with her father absent and her mother Catherine Valois (née Ferrari) disliking her. As a teenager, she obtained a few modelling jobs.

In 1988, she married Éric Vigne, a former drug dealer 15 years her senior who had just been released from prison. She then started to work as a model with her husband as manager. She also worked as a prostitute, and her husband was arrested for being her pimp.

==Breast enlargements==
Encouraged by Vigne, she underwent, beginning in 1990, numerous plastic surgery operations to create a bust (she was originally a 37-inch bust). She had 22 enlargements, which is a Guinness World Record. The &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; (2003) indicates each of her breasts weighed and contained three litres of saline.

She wore a specially engineered brassiere. Her brassiere measurements have been given by various sources as 58F, 54G, although these measurements appear false, as breasts of similar size have a bra size of around 36T or 36MMM. The breast implants themselves were reputed to be designed by an engineer who was involved with the design of the Boeing 747.

In interviews, she said about her surgeries, &quot;All this stuff has been because I can&#x27;t stand life. But it hasn&#x27;t changed anything&quot; and &quot;I was frightened and I was ashamed; I wanted to change my face, my body, to transform myself. I wanted to die, really.&quot;

==Career==

After the breast enlargements, she adopted the stage name &quot;Lolo&quot;, from a French slang word for breasts, along with &quot;Ferrari&quot; as a last name, and made a few pornographic films. Use of the Ferrari name (which she justified as it was her maternal grandfather&#x27;s surname) led to lengthy trademark infringement court battles with the Italian Ferrari automobile company when she tried to market a line of underwear called Ferrari Underwear and a Lolo Ferrari doll.

In an effort to promote herself, she went with her husband to the Cannes Film Festival in 1995. She won the &quot;European large breasts championship&quot; there, became a favorite of photographers, and entered the international limelight.

She appeared in the Belgian film &quot;Camping Cosmos&quot; by Jan Bucquoy and producer Francis De Smet. She caused a sensation at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival with the presentation of the movie during a remake of the boxing match in &quot;Camping Cosmos&quot; between the European champion and the former opponent of Muhammad Ali (Jean-Pierre Coopman).

She used her newly won publicity to obtain a regular role on the British Channel 4 television show &quot;Eurotrash&quot;. The media hype led to appearances on other European shows and work in cabaret shows doing a song and striptease act. Hoping to launch a pop music career, she recorded two singles, titled &quot;Airbag Generation&quot; and &quot;Set Me Free&quot;, as well as two more singles, a Euro disco cabaret song called &quot;Dance Dance Dance&quot;, and a cover of Thelma Houston&#x27;s Euro disco hit, &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave Me This Way&quot;. Neither of the latter two songs was given a commercial release.

==Death==
On the morning of 5 March 2000, at the age of 37, Ferrari was found dead, of undetermined causes, by her husband at her home in Grasse in the Alpes-Maritimes département on the French Riviera. The original autopsy determined that she had died of an overdose of antidepressants and tranquilizers. She had been depressed and her death was ruled a suicide. Her parents suspected that her husband was involved, and a second autopsy was approved two years later. This second autopsy found that mechanically-induced suffocation could not be ruled out. Her widower was suspected of causing her death, was arrested, and spent 13 months in prison. After a second medical analysis, he was finally cleared of the charges in 2007.

When Channel 4 broadcast Ferrari&#x27;s obituary on &quot;Eurotrash&quot;, it was transmitted with straight dubbing as a mark of respect (normally, &quot;Eurotrash&quot;″s dubbing is exaggerated to emphasise the humour); it ended with a caption stating &quot;Lola Ferrari 1970–2000&quot;; an error, given that her year of birth was actually 1963. In 2005, the station broadcast a documentary about her life, featuring interviews with her, her husband, her mother and her plastic surgeon.

<doc id="1302789" wikidata="Q3268965" url="?curid=1302789" title="USS Pomfret">
<text>USS &quot;Pomfret&quot; (SS-391), a submarine, was a ship of the United States Navy named for the pomfret, a fish of the seabream family which is a powerful and speedy swimmer, capable of operating at great depths.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Pomfret&quot; was laid down 14 July 1943 and launched 27 October 1943 by the Portsmouth Navy Yard, in Kittery, Maine, sponsored by Miss Marilyn Maloney, daughter of Senator Francis Maloney; and commissioned 19 February 1944.

== World War II ==

After training, the new submarine arrived at Pearl Harbor 1 June 1944. She departed Pearl Harbor 23 June and proceeded via Midway to her first patrol area—the east coast of Kyūshū and Bungo Suido. On 6 July she made an emergency dive when attacked by a Japanese plane. On 12 July she allowed a Japanese hospital ship to proceed in peace. After attempting an attack on a battleship, she arrived at Midway 16 August.

On 10 September she departed Midway for the Luzon Straits-South China Sea area to conduct her second patrol. She sighted two enemy battleships on 26 September, but their speed and the presence of an enemy submarine prevented an attack.

On 2 October &quot;Pomfret&quot; sank &quot;Tsuyama Maru&quot;, a 6,962-ton passenger-cargo vessel. After the usual depth charging, she departed for Saipan and moored in Tanapag Harbor 12 October.

After refit and training, &quot;Pomfret&quot; reentered the same patrol area 1 November as part of a wolf pack, with Cdr. John B. Hess now commanding. &quot;Pomfret&quot; sank &quot;Atlas Maru&quot;, 7,347-tons and &quot;Hamburg Maru&quot;, 5,271-tons. On 25 November, she sank Japanese &quot;Patrol Boat No.38&quot; and cargo ship &quot;Shōhō Maru&quot;, 1,356-tons. &quot;Pomfret&quot; departed the area and proceeded via Midway to Pearl Harbor.

The submarine began her fourth patrol 25 January 1945 in another wolf pack. The mission was a picket boat sweep ahead of a carrier task force soon to strike the Tokyo-Nagoya area. After completing the sweep without encountering any picket boats, she moved south of Honshū for lifeguard work.

On 16 February she rescued a pilot from the aircraft carrier , Lieutenant (jg) Joe Farrel. The next day, she saved a pilot from , Ensign Robert L. Buchanan. The incident was described in &quot;Silent Victory&quot; by Clay Blair (Lippincott, 1975) as follows:
That day she also captured two prisoners. Unsuccessfully attacked by a Japanese destroyer on 10 March, she departed the area 23 March and arrived at Midway on 30 March. Departing Midway 26 April for the Kuril Islands-Okhotsk Sea area, she entered the area 5 May. On 26 May she fired torpedoes at an enemy anti-submarine hunter-killer group, but scored no hits. She returned to Midway 7 June.

On 2 July she departed for her sixth war patrol. After lifeguard duty south of Honshū, she began patrol in the East China Sea. On 19 July she sank the first of 44 floating mines. On 24 July, she shelled the Kuskaki Jima lighthouse and radio installations and, on 26 July, she destroyed a three-masted junk and a small schooner. On 8 August she rescued the entire five-man crew of a B-25 bomber. &quot;Pomfret&quot; continued to shell small craft and pick up Japanese and Korean survivors until the cessation of hostilities 15 August 1945. The following day she headed for Guam. On 9 September she arrived at San Francisco.

== Post-war service ==

On 2 January 1946 &quot;Pomfret&quot; departed Mare Island Naval Shipyard for Guam, arriving 22 January 1946. She proceeded to Subic Bay, Philippine Islands 9 March, and from there steamed to Tsingtao, China where for six weeks she acted as target for U.S. antisubmarine warfare vessels based at Tsingtao. On 18 May she returned to Pearl Harbor, her new homeport. During the next three years, she made two tours of duty in Western Pacific: the first, April to August 1947, and the second, December 1948 to April 1949.

Jimmy Carter, future President of the United States (1977–1981), served aboard &quot;Pomfret&quot; from 17 December 1948 to 1 February 1951 as his first submarine assignment. Carter is the only U.S. president to have qualified as a submariner. During this period &quot;Pomfret&quot; deployed to the Western Pacific Ocean and conducted operations in the waters off Japan and the coast of China.

In 1950 &quot;Pomfret&quot; arrived in San Diego. She operated along the United States West Coast until February 1951, participated in the Korean War until September and returned to San Diego to operate locally. &quot;Pomfret&quot; decommissioned in April 1952 for conversion at Mare Island to a Guppy IIA submarine. After conversion, she recommissioned 5 December and in the ensuing years alternated between coastal operations off San Diego and Western Pacific deployments.

She departed for Far Eastern waters 7 July 1967 on a cruise which included anti-submarine warfare exercises in the Gulf of Tonkin off Vietnam. She returned to San Diego 23 January 1968 and spent most of that year in exercises off San Diego.

== TCG &quot;Oruçreis&quot; (S 337) ==

In 1971, transfers to the Turkish Navy were resumed, starting with &quot;Pomfret&quot;. After three months of training, she was transferred on 1 July in San Diego, and renamed TCG &quot;Oruçreis&quot; (S 337), after the great Ottoman seaman Oruç Reis. Her new crew sailed to the Philadelphia Naval Yard for an overhaul, and then, before sailing to Turkey, she took part in ASW training in Key West, Florida between 27 February – 22 March 1972. &quot;Oruçreis&quot; was commissioned on 3 May 1972. Ex-&quot;Pomfret&quot; was purchased outright by Turkey and simultaneously struck from the US Naval Register, 1 August 1973.

She served in the Turkish Navy until 1987.

<text>Claudio Wílliman Gonzalez (10 October 1861 in Montevideo – 9 February 1934 in Montevideo) was a Uruguayan political figure.

==Background==

Claudio Wílliman&#x27;s parents, José Williman and Antonia González, were immigrants from Galicia, Spain. José Wílliman&#x27;s parents himself came from Savoy, France, with Alsatian roots.

Williman studied at the University of Montevideo and graduated with a Doctorate in Law and Social Sciences in 1887. From his adolescence he devoted his intellectual activity to teaching. In 1885 he was appointed professor of Physics at the University, and two years later was entrusted with the chair of the same subject at the Military School. Williman also taught classes in Cosmography and Physical Geography at the Military School, during the first years of its operation, and also taught at various private institutes. He was also, as noted by one study, “one of the initiators of the foundation of the Faculty of Mathematics and was part of its faculty from the first days of its installation, being entrusted with the chair of Industrial Physics that he held for many years.” In 1913, the Council of that Faculty granted Williman the title of &quot;ad-honorem&quot; Professor, without a fixed subject, a distinction that ratified by decree of the P.E. Earlier, in 1890, Williman was appointed Dean of the Faculty of Secondary and Preparatory Education. His performance earned him the Chamber of Doctors including him up to three times in the shortlist of candidates for the Rectorate of the University, and In 1902 he was appointed Rector of the University, a position he resigned two years later to occupy the position of Minister of Government. Eight years later, he returned in 1912 to be appointed Rector of the University, a position he resigned in 1915 when he was appointed President of the Board of Directors of the Bank of the Republic. Following his assumption of the Rectorate Williman proposed to provide the University with the necessary buildings to house its different departments. According to one study, “the construction of the current University buildings was due to his management, which Dr. Williman himself inaugurated in 1911, when he was President of the Republic.” In 1903, Williman began the founding of the School of Commerce and also laid the foundations of the School of Veterinary Medicine that same year. While these works of progress were carried out “the University reorganized all its services, reviewed the study plans, improved the teaching material and disciplined the teaching staff, a work that culminated in the university law of 1908, prepared and promulgated during his Presidency.”

Wílliman was a member of the Uruguayan Colorado Party and was closely identified with the liberal José Batlle y Ordóñez. His political actions dated back to the days preceding the Quebracho revolution. Williman was a incorporated into a group that maintained the resistance against the Government of General Santos, taking an active part in the journalistic campaigns of the time. When the 1886 revolution was organized he went to join its ranks. Williman invaded with the expeditionary army and fought in the action of Palmares de Soto, later, according to one study, “falling prisoner with the best of the revolutionary youth.” On returning home he closed the first cycle of his political activity and for many years devoted himself exclusively to the activity of the professor, to the management of the university institution and to the work of his law firm. In the 1898 elections Williman was elected member of the J.E.A. of Montevideo and in that corporation acted as Director of the Treasury. He was also elected member of the Electoral Board. Williman was serving his elective position as councilor when President Cuestas offered him the Ministry of Public Works, but he declined this offer. When the 1904 revolution broke out Williman was entrusted with the 4th of G. G. N. N. In April 1904 Williman took charge of the Ministry of the Interior, and some months later, since the titular Minister of War and Navy, General Vázquez, had gone out on campaign, that Portfolio was also entrusted to Williman, at whose head he found the peace of September 1904.

His grandson José Claudio Wílliman served in the Uruguayan Senate 1985–1990.

==President of Uruguay==

Williman was chosen by Batlle to succeed him as Uruguayan presidents were constitutionally barred from serving consecutive terms. Batlle’s naming of Williman as his preferred successor came in late 1905. On October the 15th 1905 the newspaper “El Siglio” stated “The President of the Republic has told his friends among the legislators that the candidacy of Doctor Claudio Williman for future President of the Republic is the one which he prefers.” As noted by one study, “Visitors to Batlle’s house in Montevideo were much in evidence. Within 3 days, more than enough vote pledges were secured from the Colorado legislators to assure Williman’s election as the next President.” On October the 30th, the formal proclamation of Williman signed by 53 Colorado legislators, which was more than the constitutional majority, was published. A campaign was launched to popularize Williman’s candidacy, with biographies circulated and committees formed to explain his virtues. In addition to local newspapers in the interior coming out for Williman, all the new Colorado departmental organizations formally announced their support for him, with this Trienta y Tres statement, as noted by one study, being typical: “The Departmental Committee believes itself to be interpreting the will of the coreligionaries of the department who see in Dr. Williman the surest guarantee that his government will carry on in the progressive currents ably sown by the present administration.”

In 1907 Williman was elected President of the Republic for the period 1907-1911 by the General Assembly.

His policies generally followed those of Batlle. Williman had indicated that he would continue Batlle’s policies in a speech he made to the legislature after taking the oath of office. In his speech, he praised the outgoing government for “its noble and just preoccupation with the betterment of the humble” and called for measures such as a new Ministry of Public Education, a government labor office, reorganisation of public charity, and regulation of corporations. He also stated the need “to resolve the problem of populating the interior, which in the midst of great prosperity remains half deserted, since it is not the existence of a handful of great fortunes which constitutes the wealth of a nation.” As noted by one study, “This last sentence got a great round of applause, and the whole speech sat well with the Colorado legislators.”

A number of projects were approved during Williman’s presidency, including Credits from the Banco de la República for farmers and Reorganization and modernization of the Department of Livestock and Agriculture. A 1908 law provided for the safeguarding of pensions and wages against garnishment. A number of laws were passed concerning commercial, criminal and civil matters, including ones related to the conditional release of convicts, absolute divorce, marks of factory and trade, the legitimacy of natural children, abolition of the death penalty, and the abolition of the third instance in criminal matters. Propaganda against occupational diseases was carried out, and posters containing prophylactic measures against carbuncle or bad grain and other diseases were distributed throughout the country. Departmental Hygiene Inspections were also established to replace Councils which had been in operation since 1895. A Labor Office was also installed. Williman had called for the establishment of a Labor Office or institute, “destined to study everything that is related to the progress of the industries and the aspirations of the workers, in order to cooperate in the solution of the questions and conflicts and, prepare the most opportune legislation in this matter.” Through Law 3,147 of 1907 the Ministry of Industry, Labor and Public Instruction was established. In 1911 a military pension fund was established “to administer survivors’ pensions for all military officers.” Many new public schools were also built, and in 1908 the Executive Power requested and obtained sanction of a law authorizing the creation of the National Institute for the Deaf. Money was also spent on public improvements, such as transit and sanitary works. Many public works were carried out. In the capital this included the extension and completion of Boulevard Artigas al Sud, completion of Avenida Brasil, completion of Rambla Pocitos, construction of the Agricultural Market, construction of the Military and Naval School building, construction of the Blandengues Regiment barracks, police buildings, and groups of school buildings. According to one study “In the departments there were innumerable road works, construction of bridges, sanitation, municipal services, canalizations, dredging, authorization of ports, layout and extension of railways, carried out by the same administration, whose intense work was translated in the economic and financial order in the constantly reproduced fact of the &quot;surplus&quot; in the annual exercises.” 392 schools were also built, almost all of which rural. A law of February the 24th 1911, “completely regulated the loss and restitution of parental authority, guardianship of minors and the creation of the Council for the Protection of Minors,” and a law of 1908 “recognized the right of all mothers to proper maternity care,” although in the absence of any machinery this was “a counsel of perfection” until Montevideo in 1915 opened its maternity hospital with 150 beds. In 1909, the Executive Power requested and obtained the abolition of a 5% discount on salaries that public employees had been subject to since 1893. The School Medical Corps was created by law of the Nation and regulated in 1908, entrusting it with “the mission of hygienic surveillance of school buildings, teaching staff, school materials, furniture, programs, prophylaxis of infectious-contagious diseases, study of school retarded, etc., designating 4 members to perform these tasks.” Developments in public assistance took place, with one presidential message from 1910 noting &quot;Equally worthy of mention, under another concept, are the results obtained by the change of regime in the Maternal and Foundling Homes, with the operation of the &quot; Gota de Leche &quot; clinic, whose benefits have been completed with the holding of popular conferences on childcare, dedicated to mothers, and the creation of the Vacation Colony, which has just been joined by children belonging to Public Schools and poor parents, protected by the &quot;Uruguayan League against Tuberculosis.&quot;

In 1908, the head of the Labor Office Dr. Juan José Amézaga presented a bill on workplace accidents which was passed immediately by the Executive Branch passed to the Assembly. As established by this project, employers or entrepreneurs who are in charge of exploiting an industry or carrying out work included in this law (such as mines, quarries, factories, metallurgical workshops, mines, quarries and factories) “were civilly liable for all accidents that occur to their workers or employees due to their work or due to it.” Pensions would be provided in cases of absolute or permanent incapacity, partial and permanent disability, temporary disability, and death. The Work Commission of the Chamber of Deputies, accepted the general lines of the project in an important study, which led “to the rapid sanction of the law in that branch of the Legislative Body.” However, a different environment prevailed in the Chamber of Senators, and the project remained there until it was sanctioned in 1920. As noted by one observer, “The Chamber approved a project to regulate work accidents on September 28, 1909. The Senate Legislation Committee came here, studied it, and modified a large part of the project, expanding and correcting it.” Williman himself was a supporter of accident insurance, having advocated this himself during his presidency. 

In 1910, public assistance was reorganized by a law &quot;voted unanimously by both chambers&quot; that established in Montevideo a general directorate and a Public Assistance council and in the departments “delegated doctors in charge of the functions local.” According to the law, every individual indigent or deprived of resources had “the right to free public assistance at the expense of the State.” This included services such as child protection, assistance and protection of pregnant women and women in labor, assistance and guardianship of homeless children, assistance and protection of homeless, invalid and chronic elderly, and sick care. Following the passage of this law 5 new pavilions were built in the House of Isolation, the Germán Segura pavilion was enlarged; and a laboratory was set up in the Psychiatric Clinic of the Insane Asylum along with an external office in the Asylum for Foundlings and Orphans. In addition various establishments &quot;have received aid and subsidies, including the Hospital Galán y Rocha, in Paysandú, and the one in Colonia are nearing completion; the one in Rosario has been inaugurated, and first aid rooms have been set up in Colonia, Rivera and Treinta y Tres.&quot;

That same year the Executive Power offered a pension scheme for agricultural and industrial workers whose annual wage didn’t exceed $300. A plan was also devised by the Insurance Bank “but the lack of satisfactory statistics, the unwillingness of business to submit to the mounting expense of social legislation, and the absence of any wide margin in the wage scale that might be used for employee contributions to a pension fund, checked the acceptance of these plans.” The extension of the retirement pension system to private industry later began with the passage of a law of the 6th of October 1919 that provided for the pensioning of employees in the water, telephone, tramway, telegraph, railway and gas distributing services.

==Post Presidency==

He was succeeded by Batlle who was re-elected in 1911. He returned to the Senate of Uruguay but then left it to become president of the Banco de la República Oriental del Uruguay in 1916. He held that position until 1928.

When his presidential term ended, Williman resigned authority into the hands of his successor and left shortly after for Europe on a rest trip. The whole of 1911 and part of 1912 was dedicated to touring European countries and when Williman returned to the country it was to occupy the position of Rector of the University. Williman at the head of the Rectorate when in 1913 he was elected Senator for the department of Río Negro, a position he inevitably resigned.

Wílliman lived to see much of his and Battle y Ordóñez&#x27;s democratic legacy destroyed — at least temporarily — by President Gabriel Terra, who reinforced his presidential rule in a coup d&#x27;état in 1933.

===Death and legacy===

Williman was seen as the &quot;de facto&quot; caretaker president of Uruguay chosen by José Batlle y Ordóñez to succeed him after his first term in office. Williman, however, disliked the idea of being seen as a stand-in for Batlle, telling an historian in 1905 that “Neither by temperament, by education, nor by the principles I have always maintained would I have agreed to a merely inert and purely decorative retention of the government. And if I am not a man capable of accepting such a situation, neither was my predecessor a man capable of making such a demand, be it said in his honor.” 

Wílliman died in 1934.

A road in Punta del Este and one in Punta Carretas are named after him.

Adam Cheng Siu-chau (born 24 February 1947; formerly known as Cheng Chong-sai and Wong Ho-chung) is a Hong Kong TVB actor and Cantopop singer.

== Career ==

Cheng started his career in the 1970s, where he gained a reputation for playing the lead roles in TVB &quot;Wuxia&quot; drama series based on the works of Louis Cha and Gu Long, such as &quot;The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber&quot; and &quot;Chor Lau Heung&quot;. He also performed some of the theme songs of the TV series he starred in, such as &quot;The Greed of Man&quot; and &quot;Cold Blood Warm Heart&quot;.

== Ting Hai effect ==

In 1992, TVB released the TV series &quot;The Greed of Man&quot;, based on the central theme of the stock market and explored the schemes and plots used by people to make their fortune in the market. Cheng played Ting Hai (丁蟹) in the series, who made an immense fortune by short selling derivatives and stocks during a bear market. Many people went bankrupt while Ting Hai&#x27;s family became richer until they were defeated by their nemesis. Cheng became popularly associated with the Ting Hai effect, named after his character in the series. The effect involves a peculiar and unexplained phenomenon, in which global stock markets will fall whenever a new Hong Kong TV drama series, starring Cheng, is aired.

== Personal life ==
Adam&#x27;s parents are both university lecturers. He has four daughters. The oldest, Cheng On-yee, was from his first low-profile marriage that ended in divorce. He married well-known actress Lydia Shum in 1985 after 14 years of cohabitation, and Shum brought him to fame. Adam and Shum had a daughter, Joyce Cheng in 1987. In 1988 they divorced eight months after their daughter&#x27;s birth in bad terms.

In 1989, Cheng married a Taiwanese actress named Koon Jing-wah. Cheng and Koon have two daughters, Winnie Cheng Wing-yan and Cecily Cheng Wing-hei.

<doc id="1302802" wikidata="Q50002" url="?curid=1302802" title="Emma Bonino">
<text>Emma Bonino (born 9 March 1948) is an Italian politician. She was a senator for Rome between 2008 and 2013, and again between 2018 and 2022. She also served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 2013 to 2014. Previously, she was a Member of the European Parliament and a member of the Chamber of Deputies. She served in the government of Italy as Minister of International Trade from 2006 to 2008. She was European Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection.

Bonino is a leading member of the Italian Radicals, a political party which describes itself &quot;liberale, liberista, and libertario&quot;, where &quot;liberista&quot; denotes economic liberalism and &quot;libertario&quot; a form of cultural liberalism concerning moral issues, with some ideological connection with historical left-libertarianism. She graduated in modern languages and literature from Bocconi University in Milan in 1972. A veteran legislator in Italian politics and an activist for various reform policies, she was elected six times as deputy and two times as senator. 
She is the leader of More Europe, a liberal, European federalist party list she launched in December 2017, ahead of the 2018 Italian general election.

== Personal life ==
Bonino never married nor bore children, even succumbing to the Italian authorities in 1975 after having an illegal abortion. She fostered children.

She graduated at Bocconi University in literature with a master thesis on Malcolm X&#x27;s autobiography.

Bonino is a godmother of Countess Luana, elder daughter of Prince Friso and Princess Mabel of Orange-Nassau.

On 12 January 2015, she announced on Radio Radicale she was suffering from lung cancer and was being treated with chemotherapy, though she also stated she was not abandoning her political activity.
On 21 May of the same year, on the same radio station, she announced her cancer was in complete remission. In 2023, she announced she was healed.

==National political career==
Bonino was elected to the Italian Chamber of Deputies in 1976 and reelected in 1979, 1983, 1987, 1992, 1994 and 2006. In 1975, she founded the Information Centre on Sterilisation and Abortion and promoted the referendum which led to the legalisation of abortion in Italy. In 1986, she was among the promoters of a referendum against nuclear energy that led to the rejection of a civil nuclear energy programme in Italy.

On 17 May 2006, Bonino was appointed as minister for international trade in the cabinet of Romano Prodi. She resigned from office on 7 May 2008 when she had been elected vice president of the Senate the previous day. In 2008, at the elections of 13 and 14 April, she was elected to a seat in the Senate, the second parliamentary chamber, on the list of the Democratic Party for the Piedmont constituency.

On 28 April 2013, she was sworn in as foreign minister in the government led by Enrico Letta.

In June 2017, public opinion polls of her stood at 43 percent, second only to prime minister Paolo Gentiloni. Despite the positive public opinion, her party fell short of the 3 percent required for a seat in Parliament. In response, she has adopted the slogan &quot;Love Me Less, Vote Me More.&quot;

Bonino was elected to the Senate of the Republic in the constituency of Rome – Gianicolense district at the 2018 general election.

==International political career==

Bonino was elected to the European Parliament in 1979 and re-elected in 1984 and 1999. She served as the Secretary of the Transnational Radical Party in 1993–94 and the party&#x27;s president in 1991–1993. In October 1994, she was appointed head of the Italian Government delegation to the UN General Assembly for the &quot;Moratorium on death penalty&quot; initiative. From 1994 to 1999, she was European Commissioner responsible for Consumer Policy, Fisheries and the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO). In 1997, her field of competence was widened to include consumer health protection and food safety.

From 14 to 17 May, 1998, she participated in the annual meeting of the Bilderberg Group at Turnberry, Scotland.

On 15 March 1999, together with all the Santer Commission, she resigned due to the accusations of fraud and mismanagement against commissioner Édith Cresson. The final report however leveled charges against most commissioners, including Bonino herself. In November 2002, she was appointed Head of the Italian Government delegation at the Inter-governmental Conference of the Community of Democracies in Seoul.

Along with Marco Pannella, another member of the Radical Party, Bonino has fought numerous battles for civil rights and individual liberty, mainly concerned with divorce, the legalisation of abortion, the legalisation of drugs, and for sexual and religious freedoms. She has fought for an end to capital punishment, against female genital mutilation, and the eradication of world hunger. In 1975, Bonino funded the information centre for abortion (CISA), and in 1997 she supported the international movement condemning the discrimination of females in Afghanistan, &quot;Un Fiore per le Donne di Kabul&quot; (A Flower for the Women of Kabul). Bonino is also a champion of the recognition of women&#x27;s rights in the countries of the African Union through the Maputo protocol. She is a founder of the nongovernmental organizations No Peace Without Justice, which supports the international protection and promotion of human rights and democracy, and &quot;Nessuno Tocchi Caino&quot; (Let None Strike Cain), which is an international league that fights for the abolition of the death penalty.
In June 1999, she obtained a historic percentage of votes (8.5%) in the European elections (vs. the usual 2–3% that Radicals got in the previous and subsequent elections). Her list (Lista Bonino) won seven of 78 Italian seats in this election.

Bonino supported the NATO intervention in Kosovo in the spring of 1999. From 1999 to 2004, the Lista Bonino was non-affiliated, as it was founded with a claim to not adhere to the traditional centre-left versus centre-right politics, rather remaining in the middle to maximize any potential bargaining power. In the case &quot;Emma Bonino and Others v Parliament and Council (Case T-40/04)&quot;, the Emma Bonino List contested before the Court of Justice of the European Union that its exclusion from Community funding due to not qualifying as a party on the &#x27;European level&#x27; was discriminatory. The court dismissed this argument as inadmissible, establishing that measures do not necessarily need to legally affect an applicant in order for the case to directly affect them. Since 2004, it is part of the ALDE group.

In 2002, Bonino in cooperation with the &quot;Associazione Italiana Donne per lo Sviluppo&quot; (AIDOS, Italian Association for the Development of Women), called an Italian Parliament meeting to discuss genital mutilation. Bonino led the ceremonies, which gathered medical experts, ambassadors, and politicians to review graphic information about the practice of female genital mutilation in African countries. During this meeting, Bonino recounted her travels through Somalia, Egypt, Tanzania, The Gambia, and Ethiopia, where she learned about these rural practices by meeting women who participated in projects to stop them. Many African women who suffered from genital mutilation discussed their firsthand experiences. At the conclusion of the meeting, the Prime Minister Berlusconi congratulated Bonino on her accomplishments in this cause and presented the leader of AIDOS with a check for the European Campaign.

In December 2001, she moved to Cairo with the objective of learning the Arabic language and culture. In March 2003, she started a daily review of the Arabic press on Radical Radio. In January 2004, she organized the &quot;Regional Conference on Democracy, Human Rights and the role of the International Penal Court&quot;, the first for an Arabic country. She is currently a board member of the Arab Democracy Foundation.

Bonino was a board member of DARA until December 2012. In 2016, she was appointed by Erik Solheim, the Chairman of the Development Assistance Committee, to serve on the High Level Panel on the Future of the Development Assistance Committee under the leadership of Mary Robinson.

Bonino writes opinion editorials and commentaries for both the Inter Press Service News Agency and Project Syndicate, discussing contemporary international issues including Syrian refugees affecting Europe, abolishing the death penalty, relations between Iran and Europe, and the poor treatment of the indigenous people of South East Asia.

==Philanthropy and charitable causes==
Bonino is a member of the eminent international Council of Patrons of the Asian University for Women (AUW) in Chittagong, Bangladesh. The University, which is the product of foundational partnerships (Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Open Society Foundation, IKEA Foundation, etc) and regional cooperation, serves extraordinarily talented women from 15 countries across Asia and the Middle East.

During an interview published by the Italian daily &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot; on 8 February 2016, Pope Francis defined Bonino as one of the nation&#x27;s &quot;forgotten greats&quot;, comparing her to great historical figures such as Konrad Adenauer and Robert Schuman.

==Recognition==

Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic – awarded on 21 December 2015

In 1999 Bonino was one of the two winners of the North-South Prize, an award that honors individuals with accomplishment in the protection of human rights, pluralistic democracy, and improvement of North-South relations.

For her battles and engagements with controversial issues, her engagement in the promotion of human rights and civil rights in the world, she received the &quot;Open Society Prize 2004&quot; and &quot;Prix Femmes d&#x27;Europe 2004&quot; for Italy.

She received the &quot;America Award&quot; of the Italy-USA Foundation in 2013, and she was also recognized as one of the BBC&#x27;s 100 women in this same year.

<doc id="1302806" wikidata="Q7337969" url="?curid=1302806" title="River Worth">
<text>The River Worth is a river in West Yorkshire, England. It flows from minor tributaries on the moors above Watersheddles Reservoir down the Worth Valley to Haworth, where it is joined by Bridgehouse Beck which flows from Oxenhope. The River Worth is itself a tributary of the River Aire, which it joins at the end of the Worth Valley in Keighley.

==Course==

There are many small streams that feed Watersheddles Reservoir (yards over the border in Lancashire) from which the River Worth is fed. From the reservoir, the river flows east into Ponden Reservoir into the town of Haworth where it is joined by Bridgehouse Beck. It then flows east north-east through the suburbs of Keighley into the town centre where North Beck flows into it, it then continues down towards Stockbridge where it joins the River Aire. The typical river level range where it joins the River Aire is between and .

==Natural history==

The river was once very polluted, but the lack of local industry nowadays has seen the river become much cleaner and it supports many forms of wildlife throughout its course. Herons, kingfishers and dippers are now a common sight. The river currently has a population of small brown trout and grayling, but they are restricted to certain parts by a number of high weirs left behind from its industrial past.

==History==

The river provided power for the wool and clothing mills. Woollen and worsted manufacture was introduced here with the first cotton-mill in Yorkshire, Low Mill at Keighley, erected in 1780.

==Leisure==

The river valley is home to the Keighley &amp; Worth Valley Railway. Bradford City Council have marked out a short/middle (circular) distance walk along the valley called &quot;The Worth Way&quot;. Angling is also allowed by permit at certain places along the river.

<text>Heinrich Gräfe or Graefe (3 March 1802 – 22 July 1868) was a German educator.

== Biography ==
Gräfe was born on 3 March 1802 at Buttstädt in Saxe-Weimar. He studied mathematics and theology at Jena, and in 1823 obtained a curacy in the town church of Weimar. He was transferred to Jena as rector of the town school in 1825; in 1840 he was also appointed extraordinary professor of the science of education (&quot;Pädagogik&quot;) in that university; and in 1842 he became head of the Burgersckule (middle class school) in Kassel.

After reorganizing the schools of the town, he became director of the new Realschule in 1843; and, devoting himself to the interests of educational reform in the Electorate of Hesse, he became in 1849 a member of the school commission, and also entered the house of representatives, where he made himself somewhat formidable as an agitator.

In 1852, for having been implicated in the September riots and in the movement against the unpopular minister Hassenpflug, who had dissolved the school commission, he was condemned to three years imprisonment, a sentence afterwards reduced to one of twelve months. On his release he withdrew to Geneva, where he engaged at the International Boarding School La Châtelaine (owner and director Achilles Roediger) until 1855, when he was appointed director of the &quot;Realschule in der Altstadt&quot; at Bremen until his death on 21 July 1868. His successor was Franz Georg Philipp Buchenau.

Besides being the author of many text-books and occasional papers on educational subjects, he wrote &quot;Des Rechisverhaltnis der Volksschule von innen und aussen&quot; (1829); &quot;Die Schulreform&quot; (1834); &quot;Schule fend Unterricht&quot; (1839); &quot;Allgemeine Pädagogik&quot; (1845); &quot;Die deutsche Volksschule&quot; (1847). Together with Naumann, he also edited the &quot;Archiv für das praktische Volksschulwesen&quot; (1828-1835).

<text>Monte Vettore (from Latin &quot;Vector&quot;, &quot;carrier&quot;, &quot;leader&quot;) is a mountain of the Umbro-marchigiano Apennine Mountains in Italy. It is the highest peak of the Sibillini massif. It is located in Ascoli piceno, Marche, Italy.

== Geography ==
The southwestern side of Sibillini massif, including the Vettore peak, is in Sibillini Mountains National Park. Below the summit of Vettore lies a small glacial lake in a small enclosed valley between Redeemer Peak.

== History ==

The local medieval tradition was that the Apennine Sibyl, a mysterious prophetess not counted among the Sibyls of Classical Antiquity, was condemned by God to dwell in a mountain cavern and await Judgement Day, having rebelled at the news that she had &quot;not&quot; been chosen Mother of God, but that some humble Judaean virgin had been favored. The peak of Monte Vettore, surrounded by reddish cliffs was recognized as the crown of &quot;Regina Sibilla.&quot;

Less stringently Christian legend set her in an underworld paradise entered through a grotto in the mountains of Norcia. Nearby the magical lake is fed by water from the cavern. Whoever stayed longer than a year could no longer leave, but remained deathless and ageless, feasting in abundance, amid revelry and voluptuous delights.

== In popular culture ==
In &quot;Il Guerrin Meschino&quot;, written by Andrea da Barberino about 1410, the central episode of the sixth part (Canto V) contains the &quot;prodigious adventures&quot; of Guerrino with this enchantress, the &quot;Fata&quot; Alcina, whom he seeks out, against all advice. He locates her cavern in the mountains of central Italy with the aid of Macco, a speaking serpent. She shows him the delights and horrors of her cavern, where sinners have been changed to the appropriate animals, but where sin is the only path to the knowledge of his real parents that he seeks, and Guerrin has to flee.

The long informative captions in the maps of Ortelius&#x27; 16th-century atlas, &quot;Cartographia Neerlandica&quot;, offer some detail about this Apennine Sybil:
Locally the Sibilla was in some sense a beneficent &quot;fata&quot; whose retinue would descend from her mountain at times to teach the village girls all the secrets of spinning and weaving (see Weaving (mythology) for other European weaving goddesses), and perhaps to dance the saltarello with the best of the young men. But if they were not back in their mountain fastness by sunrise, they would be denied access and would become mere mortals. On one occasion, what with dancing and pleasure, the &quot;faterelle&quot; had not noticed the approach of dawn. Scrambling up the Vettore, their goatlike feet crushed the rock to fragments. They reached the safety of their grotto just before dawn, but the long slope of talus is still pointed out as the &quot;Path of the Fata&quot;.

<text>Uskmouth () is an area to the south of the city of Newport, South Wales.

== Location ==
Uskmouth is effectively in the west of the village of Nash. It is at Uskmouth that the River Usk meets the Severn estuary.

== Amenities ==
It includes part of the Newport Wetlands Reserve , a notable wildlife reserve , with reed beds and grasslands that attract breeding birds such as lapwings, redshanks, oystercatchers, little ringed plovers and ringed plovers, as well as visitors such as wigeons, shovelers, teals, shelducks and pintails, bitterns, hen harriers and short-eared owls. It is part of the Caldicot Levels.

Following storms in the autumn of 1986, a track of human footprints was discovered eroding out of the clays in the intertidal zone in front of Uskmouth Power Station. The footprints were found to contain peat deposits, allowing them to be carbon dated to 4200BC. At the time they were the oldest known human footprints in Britain, but in 2013 footprints made about 800,000 years ago were discovered in Happisburgh, Norfolk.

<text>The rastacap or tam is a tall (depending on the user&#x27;s hair length), round, crocheted cap. It is most commonly associated with the pat as a way for Rastafari (Rastas) and others with dreadlocks to tuck their hair away, but may be worn for religious reasons by Rastafari. It is sometimes erroneously referred to as a &quot;Tam&quot;, a different kind of cap loosely ancestral to the rastacap. Other Caribbean terms for the rastacap include: rastafar (sometimes with a silent &quot;-r&quot;), toppa, toppah, and simply cap or hat.

In construction, the rastacap is similar to the tuque, but much larger. Most commonly crocheted, the hat can also be knit, woven, sewn, or constructed in a number of other ways. Examples with sun-cured palm leaves woven into the hat exist; this yields a semi-rigid design which a skilled islander can form rapidly. Rastacaps range in size and shape, as well as uses. People with dreadlocks and non-dreaded people alike wear rastacaps for fashion, convenience, religion, socio-political statement, and a number of other reasons. Some Rastas also wear rastacaps and other forms of headdress as a religious headcovering. It may also be worn by health and food service and heavy machinery workers with long hair, for workplace safety reasons.

<doc id="1302824" wikidata="Q1675153" url="?curid=1302824" title="Wheeling Suspension Bridge">
<text>The Wheeling Suspension Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the main channel of the Ohio River at Wheeling, West Virginia. It was the largest suspension bridge in the world from 1849 until 1851. Charles Ellet Jr. (who also worked on the Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge) designed it and supervised construction of what became the first bridge to span a major river west of the Appalachian Mountains. It linked the eastern and western section of the National Road, and became especially strategically important during the American Civil War. Litigation in the United States Supreme Court concerning its obstruction of the new high steamboat smokestacks eventually cleared the way for other bridges, especially needed by expanding railroads. Because this bridge was designed during the horse-and-buggy era, 2-ton weight limits and vehicle separation requirements applied in later years until it was closed to automobile traffic in September 2019.

The main span is from tower to tower. The east tower rests on the Wheeling shore, while the west tower is on Wheeling Island. The east tower is above the low-water level of the river, or from the base of the masonry. The west tower is above low water, with of masonry. Detailed analysis of the bridge was conducted by Dr. Emory Kemp.

The Wheeling Suspension Bridge was designated a National Historic Landmark on May 15, 1975. It is located in the Wheeling Island Historic District.

==History==
A charter was granted to the Wheeling and Belmont Bridge Company in 1816 to construct a bridge to extend the National Road (also known as the Cumberland Pike because it began in Cumberland, Maryland) across the Ohio River. Although the U.S. Congress authorized the National Road in 1806, and cities competing for that crossing included Wellsburg, Virginia and Steubenville, Ohio, that bridge connecting Wheeling with Belmont, Ohio was nevertheless completed. The National Road formally reached Wheeling on August 1, 1818, but then ferries took passengers and freight to the other section of the National Road which began in Belmont and continued westward. In 1820 Congress authorized the National Road&#x27;s extension to St. Louis, Missouri.

Another attempt to charter and construct a bridge across the Ohio River was made more than a decade later. That began in state legislatures and ultimately succeeded in getting the bridge built using new technology. It also produced two rounds of important litigation in the United States Supreme Court, in 1849–1852 and again in 1854–56.

===Technology and delays===
Since 1820 Congress had spent much money to clear navigation obstacles from the Ohio River, which flows from Pittsburgh down through Wheeling (then in Virginia) to Cincinnati, Ohio and eventually reaches the Mississippi River at Cairo, Illinois slightly downstream of St. Louis, Missouri (which became a major inland commercial center). Goods and produce could thus ship fairly cheaply and quickly down the Ohio River and reach the ocean port of New Orleans, Louisiana. Senator Henry Clay of Kentucky had become a great proponent of internal improvements, in part because the Ohio River drained into the northern part of his state and contributed to the growth of Louisville (as did the Louisville and Portland Canal completed in 1830 to bypass the Ohio River&#x27;s only major rapids). Both road and navigation improvements helped bring manufactured goods and people to Kentucky, western Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, etc., and as well as allowed produce and natural resources to reach eastern, southern and even international markets. However, President Andrew Jackson had a much stingier view of internal improvements than Senator Clay, preferring to leave their construction to private or individual state interests, if at all.

Meanwhile, ferrying the U.S. mail, as well as passengers and goods across the Ohio river at Wheeling to connect the two sections of the National Road proved cumbersome and expensive. Maintaining the (initially free) National Road also cost money, especially after floods in 1832 left debris, as well as destroyed shore facilities. In 1835 Congress (dominated by Jacksonian Democrats) gave existing sections to the adjoining states, in order to pass on those maintenance costs. In the interim, new steamboat technology helped goods move upstream as well as downstream, and both railroad and bridge technology had also evolved. Nonetheless, navigation on the Ohio River between Wheeling and Pittsburgh remained hazardous at certain times of year (because of ice and debris in winter and spring floods, as well as summer low water).

Pittsburgh and Wheeling both competed to become commercial hubs connecting east and west across the central Appalachian Mountains. To the north, the Erie Canal (completed 1825 between Buffalo, New York on Lake Erie and Albany, New York on the Hudson River) and the Welland Canal (completed 1829 connecting Lake Erie and Lake Ontario bypassing Niagara Falls and creating the St. Lawrence Seaway) proved a commercial boon even to cities some distance away (especially New York City as a seaport, but also Erie, Pennsylvania). Soon, Pennsylvania competed by subsidizing first a short canal ending at Pittsburgh, then railroads connecting Pittsburgh to Philadelphia, which had rail and water connections to New York City and was a major international port in its own right. In 1835, a new incline railroad connected Pittsburgh to Ohio valley produce and goods. The combination of Pennsylvania railroads and canals became known as the &quot;Main Line&quot;. In 1846 Pennsylvania&#x27;s legislature chartered the Pennsylvania Railroad to connect its state capital Harrisburg (which had many connections to Philadelphia) with Pittsburgh. While transappalachian commerce initially boomed in part because canals enabled one man, one boy, a horse and a boat to transport what had previously involved ten men, ten wagons and sixty horses (and the Pennsylvania route was shorter route for most Ohio valley goods and produce than the New York routes), toll revenues proved insufficient. Since 1844 Pennsylvania had been trying to sell its unprofitable investment.

A transappalachian route through Virginia could attract southern shippers. However, Virginia&#x27;s legislature was dominated by plantation owners (from the coastal east and southern areas) who already had access to cheap river transport for many months every year. Meanwhile, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad was chartered in 1827, reached Harpers Ferry in 1834 and soon out-competed the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal (which never reached Ohio) for commercial transport down the Potomac River Valley to Chesapeake Bay. The B&amp;O proved a boon for Baltimore, Maryland. The B&amp;O wanted to connect to Virginia, as well as the Ohio River valley through Parkersburg, but Virginia legislators repeatedly denied it permission to build a line along the Shenandoah and Kanawha valleys. Virginia instead subsidized first the James River Canal, then railroads (eventually, the Virginia Central Railroad into the Shenandoah Valley and the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad and Covington and Ohio Railroad across the Appalachians) through its higher Appalachian mountains ( in the proposed Virginia canal route vs the Erie Canal that crossed the Appalachians at but much further north). Virginia&#x27;s legislators wanted to direct its commerce towards its capital (Richmond) and its seaport (Norfolk) rather than toward Baltimore. However, Wheeling had become Virginia&#x27;s second largest city by 1840, and its interests also lobbied to become a B&amp;O terminus, linking the railroad to cheap river transportation. Especially after the B&amp;O reached Cumberland, Maryland in 1842, railroad technology was out-competing the National Road (which had linked to the C&amp;O Canal at Cumberland). The Virginia General Assembly in the 1830s and through the 1840s required the B&amp;O to take a relatively northern route across the Appalachians in the then-Commonwealth and connect at Wheeling. The B&amp;O finally acquiesced after 1847, its threats to move its transappalachian passage to Pittsburgh having proven idle and Pennsylvania having chartered the Pennsylvania Railroad.

While the Wheeling and Belmont Bridge Company languished for nearly two decades, in 1836, it managed to raise sufficient private funds to build a wooden bridge between Zane&#x27;s Island (officially renamed Wheeling Island in 1902) and the Ohio shore. Nonetheless, a navigation channel still remained between Wheeling and that island.

Pennsylvania legislators for decades blocked federal legislation to authorize (much less subsidize) the proposed Wheeling bridge. In 1836, Federal engineers proposed a suspension bridge with a removable section to enable steamboat smokestacks to clear, but Congress tabled it. In 1838, the U.S. postmaster reported 53 irregularities in mail service around Wheeling between January and April. An 1840 postmaster&#x27;s report urging a bridge to avoid such mail interruptions got lost. Another proposal requiring hinges on high steamboat smokestacks also initially failed. In 1844, a steamboat packet line began connecting Pittsburgh and Cincinnati (nearly bypassing Wheeling). As traffic on the National Road also languished, Virginia&#x27;s congressmen finally abandoned their efforts to win federal funding for the Wheeling bridge in early 1847. That year civic boosters instead formed a new company to build the bridge, and the new officers requested proposals in May 1847. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad track to Wheeling was finally completed in 1853, the same year a packet line connected Wheeling and Louisville.

===Construction===
After these and other delays, in 1847 the legislatures of Virginia and Ohio jointly issued a new Wheeling bridge charter. Charles Ellet and John A. Roebling were invited to submit designs and estimates for a bridge over the east channel of the river to Wheeling Island. Ellett was the chief engineer of the Virginia Central Railroad and in 1853 would build a railroad over the Blue Ridge Mountains at Rock Fish Gap. The new Wheeling bridge would be of a suspension design, since Ellet and Roebling were the foremost authorities. It would also be above low water. Their initial calculations relied on the highest smokestacks being about , but stack height kept increasing, so the planned bridge came to impede the largest steamboats with high stacks. Ellet received the contract award in 1847 with a bid of $120,000 (Roebling&#x27;s for a shorter double-span bridge was $130,000), and construction began the same year. The bridge was completed in 1849 for about $250,000.

===Supreme Court litigation (1849–1852)===
Because the relative legal status of the new steamboat and railroad technologies was unclear, as was the jurisdiction of the United States federal courts over bridges and navigable waters, the litigation concerning the first bridge to cross a major river west of the Appalachian Mountains had great effect. During the previous years, the United States Supreme Court had divided concerning the scope of the federal power in the Commerce Clause, as well as extent of concurrent state powers. In 1847, in &quot;U.S. v. New Bedford Bridge Company&quot; Justice Levi Woodbury on circuit duty had determined that no federal law defined obstruction of navigable waterways and upheld a drawbridge near the port, and Justice Samuel Nelson had done similarly while a justice of the New York Supreme Court.

The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (through its attorney general Cornelius Darragh) and Pittsburgh interests represented by Edwin M. Stanton and Robert J. Walker sought an injunction against the bridge from the U.S. Supreme Court justice supervising the geographical area, Robert C. Grier, who had been a Pennsylvania state judge in Pittsburgh and surrounding Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. Justice Grier was surprised at this use of equity, especially because it was first brought in the Supreme Court and not before a U.S. district judge. It was also begun on July 28, 1849 during the Supreme Court&#x27;s summer 1849 recess. Pennsylvania&#x27;s attorneys argued that the new bridge was a nuisance that obstructed the Ohio River (although anchored on one bank above the ground). The Wheeling and Belmont Bridge Company&#x27;s charter from Virginia required that it not obstruct navigation on the river, and Article IV of the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 labeled the navigable waters leading into the Mississippi and St. Lawrence Rivers &quot;common highways&quot; and required they be &quot;forever free&quot;. The Pittsburgh and Cincinnati steamboat line operated new vessels with very high smokestacks which would be damaged by collisions with the bridge, and stopping in Wheeling to transship passengers and freight would be expensive for the company. Pennsylvania also argued harm to its &quot;Main Line&quot; toll revenues. While Virginia never finished its proposed canal and railroad system, the Pennsylvania system never was profitable. It became less so after the Wheeling route became easier, and would become even less used were the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad to construct a track on the bridge or its own bridge nearby. During the litigation voters wanted to sell it, but no deal was finalized.

The Wheeling Bridge Company, represented by Charles W. Russell and U.S. Attorney general Reverdy Johnson (supposedly in a private capacity, but who had denied Pennsylvania&#x27;s request for his federal office&#x27;s assistance) argued the bridge helped the U.S. mails (delayed during icy as well as high and low water periods) and also connected military posts. They also argued the public&#x27;s right to cross the river, as well as Pennsylvania&#x27;s failure to prove irremediable injury because it had not brought suit during the two years the bridge was under construction and technology also existed to lower steamboat smokestacks (as was done on a canal near Louisville, Kentucky crossed by much lower bridges). Meanwhile, Virginia attorney Alexander H. H. Stuart also tried to convince Pennsylvania&#x27;s governor William F. Johnston that his state&#x27;s arguments in this case (if ratified by the U.S. Supreme Court) could jeopardize Pennsylvania&#x27;s bridges across the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers. Other attorneys and engineers (including Ellett) approached the U.S. Congress and Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana and Virginia state legislatures. Finally, the Hempfield Railroad was chartered to connect Wheeling and Pittsburgh.

Justice Grier held a hearing in Philadelphia on August 16, 1849, and on August 30 refused the requested injunction to remove the bridge. Instead, he referred the matter to the full court. That heard argument on February 25, 1850, as well as reviewed extensive depositions (361 printed pages). Rather than an opinion, on May 29, 1850, Justice Nelson (over a dissent by Justice Peter V. Daniel who would have refused jurisdiction, in which Chief Justice Taney joined) issued a one-page order appointing Reuben Hyde Walworth (whom President John Tyler had nominated to the Court but the Senate never considered confirming, and who was an expert in equity) as commissioner.

Walworth received considerable scientific and commercial evidence, including a report from U.S. Army engineer William Jarvis McAlpine. However, both parties were dissatisfied with Walworth&#x27;s 770-page report, issued in December 1851. Pittsburgh was disappointed that Walworth refused to order the bridge removed. Virginia and Ohio interests complained because he found the waterway obstructed and recommended raising the bridge an additional —which would cause enormous technical difficulties and additional cost. However, after reviewing both parties&#x27; exceptions, receiving another report from McAlpine and hearing more argument on February 23 and 24, the U.S. Supreme Court also refused to order the bridge removed, but instead amended the new required height to . The court accepted the bridge company&#x27;s proposal to study a removable portion as an alternative. Thus, Edwin Stanton won a nearly pyrrhic victory on Pennsylvania&#x27;s behalf but the bridge remained standing.

===Destruction, rebuilding, lobbying and Supreme Court round 2 (1854–1856)===

On May 17, 1854, a strong windstorm destroyed the deck of the bridge through torsional movement and vertical undulations that rose almost as high as the towers. Its rebuilding prompted the 1856 litigation. Walworth&#x27;s report undergirded the Court&#x27;s decisions in both 1852 and 1856.

Justice Grier issued an injunction against the bridge&#x27;s rebuilding during the court&#x27;s normal summer break. The rebuilding continued anyway. Ellet&#x27;s workmen made temporary repairs in eight weeks (although further improvements by William McComas would take another year). Meanwhile, the bridge company asked Congress to investigate whether the judge had been bribed (an investigation that was quietly dropped when the case resolved), and complained that the injunction violated both Congress&#x27;s sovereignty and that of Virginia (which had authorized the bridge). Plus, the Ohio legislature petitioned Congress to save the bridge, which the Virginia and Indiana legislatures (and some dissident Pennsylvanians) joined. Through the efforts of Wheeling Congressman George W. Thompson and others, Congress passed a law that designated the bridge a post road before the Supreme Court&#x27;s 1852 decision could go into effect, and that designation proved the key to the 1856 decision. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court heard a second set of legal arguments concerning the Wheeling Bridge. Justice Nelson then delivered the next opinion of the court, in December, this time upheld the bridge as an exercise of Congressional power over military and postal roads, despite Justice McLean&#x27;s objection.

===Consequences and precedent===
In 1859 Ellett&#x27;s partner William McComas made further improvements. Completion of the B&amp;O Railroad to Wheeling in 1853, and competition from a new steamboat line connecting Wheeling with Louisville proved fatal to both steamboat companies, who soon dismantled their ships or sold them downriver for the Mississippi trade. Furthermore, additional bridges across the Ohio River were proposed for Parkersburg, Bellaire and Steubenville.

A truss pivot drawbridge across the Mississippi River between Davenport, Iowa and Rock Island, Illinois was completed in 1856, over the opposition of steamboat and other interests in St. Louis. They also brought suit, but in a lower court. That initial legal action (defended by lawyer Abraham Lincoln) did not reach the U.S. Supreme Court. However, a case concerning the collision of the disabled steamer &quot;Effie Afton&quot; and that Illinois/Iowa bridge would do so decades later, and be resolved in 1872

===Civil War===
During the American Civil War, Union forces generally controlled Wheeling, and the Wheeling Suspension Bridge was never blown up despite its strategic importance. Still, Confederate raids often targeted the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, because of its strategic importance to Union forces, and many smaller Virginia bridges were blown up and rebuilt. Loyal to the Union, Ellet and his son volunteered their services to the U.S. Navy, which used their engineering expertise in designing ironclad vessels, especially rams. Colonel Ellet, who reported directly to Secretary of War Stanton, led the United States Ram Fleet on the Mississippi River during the Battle of Memphis on June 6, 1862. Ellet died of his injuries on June 21, becoming the only Union casualty in what soon proved a crucial Union victory—Memphis surrendering by day&#x27;s end, the eight-ram Confederate &quot;Cottonclad River Defense Fleet&quot; destroyed (with an estimated 180 Confederate casualties), and the Ellet rams continuing in service under his brother Alfred W. Ellet (who by war&#x27;s end had become a Brigadier General).

The Restored Government of Virginia was created after the Wheeling Convention (heavily attended by representatives of counties served by the B&amp;O railroad), and ultimately the state of West Virginia was recognized in 1863. Additional Supreme Court litigation concerning West Virginia&#x27;s constitution would continue until 1871, and Supreme Court litigation concerning apportionment of the debt Virginia had incurred in subsidizing bridge and railroad improvements would not be resolved until 1915.

===Later technological improvements===
In 1874 William Hildenbrand oversaw additional improvements on the Wheeling Bridge. A 1953 report concerning the suspension cables found them either original or from the 1860 reconstruction. The deck stiffening truss is believed to be from the same period. Auxiliary stay cables were added in 1871–72 to a design by Washington Roebling and Hildebrand.

The bridge company sold the bridge to the city of Wheeling in 1927. Additional repairs were made in 1930.

In 1956, the deck was completely rebuilt, when the road was widened from to and the sidewalks correspondingly narrowed. The road and sidewalk were reconstructed with an open steel grating that reduces wind resistance, and rests on lightened steel floor beams.

==Modern weight restrictions and issues==
The bridge spans a distance of across the Ohio River and allows barges to pass underneath. It remains the oldest vehicular suspension bridge in the United States still in use and is listed as both a National Historic Landmark and Historic Civil Engineering Landmark.

In the early 1980s, the West Virginia Division of Highways restored the bridge. The bridge remains in active service, but with weight and height restrictions since it was designed before automobiles and trucks were invented. At the time of construction, a horse and buggy was the heaviest live load that would be expected. Currently, the bridge has a (per vehicle) weight limit of , making it unsuitable for trucks, buses, or other heavy vehicles.

On February 17, 2011, a vehicle driving at high speed lost control and crashed into the sidewalk panels on the bridge. The bridge was closed for four to five days, first for inspection, then to repair the panels, as well as other minor repairs. On March 2, 2013, a non-load bearing cable snapped, causing the bridge to be closed until the cable was repaired and detailed inspections were completed.

On March 23, 2016, the bridge was closed to all vehicle and pedestrian traffic after a Greyhound bus attempted to cross the bridge and damaged it. It was reopened to all traffic (within the height and weight limits) after WVDOH inspected the bridge. High vehicles could be subject to crosswinds on the bridge.

In May 2016, the Wheeling police department vowed to begin enforcing the two ton weight and vehicle separations limits on the bridge more strictly. Traffic is advised to keep at least between vehicles. Additionally, traffic lights at both ends only allow a certain number of cars onto the bridge at one time.

==Indefinite closure to vehicular traffic==
On September 24, 2019, the West Virginia Department of Transportation indefinitely closed the bridge to vehicular traffic after continued public disregard of weight limit and safety signs. Earlier in the year, the bridge was closed for six weeks after a tour bus - which far exceeded the posted two-ton weight limit - attempted to cross the bridge, only to get stuck under a barrier. The bridge was deemed safe and reopened to traffic in August after officials from the Division of Highways installed a height barrier with hard restraints to attempt to eliminate such overweight crossings. In the time since, operators of additional vehicles over the weight limit continued to ignore the restrictions and repeatedly drove on the bridge. The West Virginia Division of Highways is working on a long-term rehabilitation plan to sustain the bridge far into the future, in the meantime, the bridge remains open to pedestrians and bicyclists.

Wheeling mayor Glenn Elliott requested that the bridge be reopened to motor vehicles, but the Division of Highways denied his request, thus sealing its fate of remaining closed until a permanent solution can be developed against drivers who choose to ignore the limits on the bridge. Even if vehicular traffic is not restored, the bridge will be maintained and preserved. According to the WVDOH, several proposed methods of keeping careless drivers at bay, such as weigh scales and enforcement cameras, are not possible.

<text>USS &quot;Sea Fox&quot; (SS-402), a , was a vessel of the United States Navy named for the sea fox, a large shark, also called the thresher shark, which frequents the coast of Europe and the Americas.

&quot;Sea Fox&quot; was laid down on 2 November 1943 at the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine; launched on 28 March 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Robert N. Robertson, widow of Lieutenant Robert N. Robertson, who survived the sinking of USS &quot;Squalus&quot; only to be lost during the war as executive officer of . The submarine was commissioned on 13 June 1944.

==Service history==

===First patrol: October–November 1944===

Two months after commissioning, &quot;Sea Fox&quot; departed New London for Hawaii and duty in Submarine Division 282 (SubDiv 282). She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 11 September and, on 4 October, got underway on her first war patrol. On 16 October, she entered her initial patrol area near the Bonin Islands, and remained in the Bonin-Volcano Islands area through 25 October, hunting enemy shipping and serving on lifeguard duty for B-24 Liberator aircraft strikes against Iwo Jima.

On 26 October, she conducted her first attack and damaged an enemy freighter; then proceeded on to the Nansei Shoto in the Ryukyus. There, on 8 November, after firing 11 torpedoes in four attacks, she sank an engines-aft cargoman. Of the 11 torpedoes fired, several broached and one circled and passed over &quot;Sea Fox&quot;″s conning tower. On 15 November, the submarine departed her assigned area and arrived at Majuro on 24 November for refit.

===Second patrol: December 1944 – February 1945===

On her second war patrol, 20 December 1944 to 5 February 1945, &quot;Sea Fox&quot; returned to the Nansei Shoto as a unit of Task Group 17.19, a coordinated attack group composed of her, , and . En route to Saipan to top off with fuel, the submarines and their PC escort picked up survivors of a downed Liberator. On 28 December, the submarines departed the Marianas for the Ryukyus; and, on 1 January 1945, &quot;Sea Fox&quot; reached her patrol area.

Nine days later, she made her only contact worthy of torpedo fire but, despite two attacks, was unsuccessful. &quot;Puffer&quot;, to which she reported the contact, later sank the target, &quot;Coast Defense Vessel No. 42&quot;. In February 1945, while undergoing refit at Guam, five of her crewmembers were killed in a Japanese ambush.

===Third and fourth patrols: March – July 1945===

&quot;Sea Fox&quot;″s third war patrol, 8 March to 6 May 1945, saw her in the South China Sea–Formosa area. She made six contacts but was able to close and attack only one, a convoy of three merchantmen and four escorts. During that action, conducted in heavy fog on the morning of 1 April, she damaged one of the freighters.

That same day, sank the &quot;mercy&quot; ship, ; and, on 2 April, &quot;Sea Fox&quot; was ordered into the area to pick up survivors and wreckage to determine the type of cargo &quot;Awa Maru&quot; had been carrying. &quot;Sea Fox&quot; located no survivors but found bales of sheet rubber covering the area where the ship had gone down. She took aboard one of the sheets and continued her patrol.

The next day, one of &quot;Sea Fox&quot;″s crew was accidentally shot by another crewman. Efforts to transfer the wounded man to a homeward-bound submarine were thwarted by rough seas, and the patient remained aboard for the duration of the patrol.

In mid-April, &quot;Sea Fox&quot; was off the northwest coast of Formosa where she encountered a shift in Japanese antisubmarine warfare (ASW) tactics. Patrol planes were numerous at night, precluding recharging. The planes, however, were relatively inactive during daylight hours, and &quot;Sea Fox&quot; surfaced and recharged accordingly.

On the night of 16–17 April, &quot;Sea Fox&quot; departed her patrol area. Progress toward Saipan was slowed by a casualty in the bow plane rigging mechanism on 19 April; but, on 26 April, she arrived in the Marianas, and she reached Pearl Harbor on 6 May. Refit took a month, and &quot;Sea Fox&quot; sailed on 7 June for her last war patrol. Assigned primarily to lifeguard duty during the 53-day patrol, she picked up nine Army aviators near Marcus Island and a tenth in the Nanpō Islands. On 29 July, she completed the patrol at Midway.

===1945–1952===

The war ended with the completion of refit, and Sea Fox headed toward Pearl Harbor for a two-week visit prior to getting underway for postwar duty with Submarine Squadron 5 (SubRon 5) in the Philippines. Based at Subic Bay, she operated in the Philippine area into 1946; then, on 12 January, got underway to return to the United States.

&quot;Sea Fox&quot; arrived in San Francisco Bay on 2 February. Overhaul followed; and in mid-May, she returned to Pearl Harbor where she rejoined Submarine Division 52 (SubDiv 52). During the remainder of the 1940s, she was deployed three times: to the central Pacific in the summer of 1946, and to the western Pacific in the winter of 1948 and in the fall of 1949. The end of the latter year also brought a brief assignment to SubDiv 13, but January 1950 saw her a unit of SubDiv 12. Six months later, the Korean War broke out; and &quot;Sea Fox&quot;″s training exercises—mine planting, torpedo approaches, gunnery, and ASW—increased.

On 2 September 1951, the submarine sailed west. A six-month tour in the western Pacific followed during which she supported the United Nations&#x27; effort in Korea by providing services to the ASW training group and by patrolling in the northern Sea of Japan. In March 1952, she returned to the Hawaiian Islands to resume local operations and to prepare for a GUPPY IIA conversion.

===1953–1970===

Decommissioned on 15 October 1952 at Mare Island Naval Shipyard, &quot;Sea Fox&quot; completed conversion the following spring and was recommissioned on 5 June 1953. In August, she returned to Pearl Harbor and resumed operations—training exercises, special operations, and western Pacific deployments—as a unit of SubDiv 71.

Reassigned to SubDiv 33 at San Diego on 1 July 1955, she became flagship of the division on 1 August and commenced local operations off the southern California coast. A year later, she sailed west for another six-month tour with the 7th Fleet; and, from then until 1969, she continued to rotate between training operations out of San Diego and duty with the 7th Fleet in the western Pacific. From 1964, her tours in WestPac included support of the Allied effort in South Vietnam.

On 21 December 1968, &quot;Sea Fox&quot; returned to San Diego from her WestPac deployment. Local operations, overhaul, and training exercises followed then she completed her final WestPac tour in the summer of 1970. In November 1970, she was declared unfit for further service. She was decommissioned, her name was struck from the Navy List on 14 December 1970.

== TCG &quot;Burakreis&quot; (S 335) ==

&quot;Sea Fox&quot; was sold to Turkey on 14 December 1970 at Hunters Point Navy Yard in San Francisco. The Turkish Navy renamed her , after the great Ottoman admiral Burak Reis. She sailed for her new home on 9 April 1971 from San Diego after conducting ASW training. She was commissioned on 8 August 1971.

In 1996, &quot;Burakreis&quot; was struck from the Turkish Naval rolls.

==Honors and awards==
As &quot;Sea Fox&quot;, the submarine earned four battle stars during World War II and four campaign stars for service during the Vietnam War. In 1964 and 1965 &quot;Sea Fox&quot; was twice awarded the Battle ready designation.

<text>Criciúma is a city in the Brazilian state of Santa Catarina. At , it is located 180 km south of Florianópolis, the state capital and around 900 km south of São Paulo. The city is the center of Brazil&#x27;s flooring and home materials industry, and is the second-largest such center in the world.

==City data==
*Foundation: 214 493 (2022 estimate)
*Area: 209,8 km2
*Nearby cities: Siderópolis, Cocal do Sul, Morro da Fumaça, Maracajá, Araranguá, Nova Veneza, Forquilhinha, Içara

The city was founded on January 6, 1880, by Italian immigrants. It has an approximate population of 213,000 inhabitants, and an area of 209.8 km². In April 2004, Criciúma was affected by a tropical cyclone, a phenomenon unheard of in recent South Atlantic history, which caused some damage.

It is the Brazilian capital of coal and ceramic tiles, but also very strong in plastic, textiles (jeans), and chemicals.

Criciúma is 24 km inland from the Atlantic Ocean (Rincão beach) and around 40 km from the mountains of the interior of Santa Catarina state.

Criciúma is also the name of the city&#x27;s football (soccer) team, which plays in the national league. They have won several championship titles, including a national championship in 1991 (Copa do Brasil). Their colors are white, black and yellow, symbols of the state mineral resources, mainly coal.

Several small towns lie around Criciúma forming a metropolitan area of 250 thousand people. The most important are: Içara (a major producer of honey), Urussanga, Nova Veneza, Siderópolis, Orleans and Araranguá.

The city is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Criciúma. Criciuma&#x27;s cathedral is Catedral São José.

According to IBGE statistics for 2014, it has 211,369 inhabitants, being the main city of the Carboniferous Metropolitan Region, which has about 600 thousand inhabitants, besides being the most populous city of South Catarinense, the seventh largest in the state of Santa Catarina and the 22nd in the Southern Region of Brazil. Under the Unified Health System, the SUS, Criciúma houses more than 252 thousand registered. It is among the 100 municipalities in Brazil with the best Human Development Index (HDI), calculated as 0.788 in 2010, being the 76th most well-rated municipality in the country and the 14th best evaluated in Santa Catarina that year.

The city is an industrial center in several sectors, among them: confection, packaging, ceramic, plastic and disposable, metalworking, extraction of coal, civil construction and graphic material.

With headquarters in Criciúma, Rede Angeloni is the largest supermarket chain in Santa Catarina and the 10th largest in the country, with 27 stores spread throughout Brazil, the largest hypermarket in the network is located in Criciúma. In addition to having 3 malls, in the service sector - health and education - stands out with three hospitals, two 24-hour care units, the University of Extremo Sul Catarinense, Federal Institute of Santa Catarina and seven other colleges.

Known for being the Brazilian Capital of Coal and Ceramic Coating. In its subsoil it harbors one of the largest mineral reserves of the country. The Visitation Mine Octávio Fontana, allows a view of the historical evolution of the extractive wealth of the city. Colonized by Italians, the city also received Poles, Germans, Portuguese and Arabs at various stages of its development.

Among so many popular festivals that take place in the South, one of them is in Criciúma. The Festival of Ethnicities, which in the first editions was named Quermesse for being held in Nereu Ramos Square, next to St. Joseph&#x27;s Cathedral, brings together all the ethnic traditions of the region and has as main objectives to promote the manifestations and to integrate the colonizers of Criciúma, thus passing on their cultural history.

<doc id="1302833" wikidata="Q5152995" url="?curid=1302833" title="Committee of 100 (United Kingdom)">
<text>The Committee of 100 was a British anti-war group. It was set up in 1960 with a hundred public signatories by Bertrand Russell, Ralph Schoenman, Michael Scott, and others. Its supporters used mass nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience to achieve their aims.

==History==

The idea of a mass civil disobedience campaign against nuclear weapons emerged early in 1960 in discussions between Ralph Schoenman (an activist in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND)), and Hugh Brock, April Carter (both of the Direct Action Committee against nuclear war), Ralph Miliband, Alan Lovell and Stuart Hall. Schoenman approached Bertrand Russell, the president of CND, with the idea. Russell resigned from the presidency of CND in order to form the Committee of 100, which was launched at a meeting in London on 22 October 1960 with a hundred signatures. Russell was elected as president and Michael Randle of the Direct Action Committee was appointed secretary.

Russell explained his reasons for setting up the Committee of 100 in an article in the &quot;New Statesman&quot; in February 1961:

Many in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, including some of its founders, supported the Committee of 100&#x27;s campaign of civil disobedience and in its first year it received more in donations than CND had received in its first year. Several of the early CND&#x27;s activists, including some members of its executive committee, had been supporters of the Direct Action Committee and in 1958 CND had cautiously accepted direct action as a possible method of campaigning; but, largely under the influence of Canon John Collins, the CND chairman, the CND leadership opposed any sort of unlawful protest, and the Committee of 100 was created as a separate organisation partly for that reason and partly because of personal animosity between Collins and Russell. It has been suggested that this separation weakened the campaign against nuclear weapons.

The Committee&#x27;s campaign tactic was to organise sit-down demonstrations, which were not to be undertaken without at least 2,000 volunteers pledging to take part. Many eminent people participated in the sit-downs but few of the 100 signatories took part in the Committee&#x27;s activities. Demonstrators were required to adopt a discipline of non-violence. In a briefing document the Committee of 100 said, &quot;We ask you not to shout slogans and to avoid provocation of any sort. The demonstrations must be carried out in a quiet, orderly way. Although we want massive support for these demonstrations, we ask you to come only if you are willing to accept this non-violent discipline.&quot; Demonstrators were recommended to remain limp if arrested and to refuse to co-operate in any way until inside the police station.

At first, the Committee of 100 differed from CND only in its methods, and they had the same objectives. Within the Committee, however, there were different ideas about civil disobedience, direct action and non-violence. Bertrand Russell saw mass civil disobedience merely as a way of getting publicity for the unilateralist cause. Those from the Direct Action Committee were absolute pacifists (some of them Christians) who followed Gandhi, and they regarded direct action as a way of creating a non-violent society. Ralph Schoenman and others, including the anarchists who later led the organisation, saw direct action as a sort of insurrection that could force the state to give up nuclear weapons. These factions argued among themselves about whether non-violence was a matter of principle or just a tactic and whether the Committee should limit itself to demonstrations or adopt a more thoroughgoing anarchist programme. Nicolas Walter, a prominent member of the Committee, said later that it had been an anarchist organisation from its inception and that the hundred signatories were, in effect, a front.

===1961===

The Committee&#x27;s first act of civil disobedience on 18 February 1961 was a sit-down demonstration at the Ministry of Defence in Whitehall, London, to coincide with the expected arrival of on the River Clyde. (Picture) Between 1,000 and 6,000 people took part. Somewhat to the surprise of the Committee, there were no arrests. At the next sit-down demonstration, on 29 April in Parliament Square, the police arrested 826 people. There were also marches and sit-downs against nuclear testing and demonstrations at the US and Soviet embassies in London and at the Polaris submarine base.

On 17 September, Battle of Britain Day, supporters blocked the pierheads at Holy Loch and the approaches to Trafalgar Square. (Picture) The September demonstration is regarded as the high-water mark of the Committee of 100. A week before the demonstration, the hundred committee members were summoned to court without charge under the Justices of the Peace Act of 1361 because they &quot;incited members of the public to commit breaches of the peace&quot; and were likely to continue to do so. The court bound them to a promise of good behaviour for twelve months; thirty-two, including Bertrand Russell, then aged 89, refused and chose to go to prison instead. It is estimated that 12,000 to 15,000 attended the demonstration despite the invocation of the Public Order Act, which effectively made it illegal to be in the vicinity of central London that day. Several thousand sat down and there were 1,314 arrests, but no violence from demonstrators despite allegations of police brutality.

The success of the September demonstration encouraged the Committee to move from symbolic sit-down demonstrations in London to mass direct action at the places where nuclear weapons would be deployed, and they planned simultaneous demonstrations on 9 December to walk on to air force bases at Wethersfield, Ruislip, Brize Norton, Cardiff to sit on the runways and to prevent planes from taking off, and street sit-downs in Bristol, Manchester and York. By this time the authorities had begun to take the Committee of 100 more seriously. The official response had escalated from prosecution for incitement to breach of the peace to prosecution for the much more serious offences of conspiracy and incitement to breach the Official Secrets Act. Six organisers, the &quot;Wethersfield Six&quot;, were charged with these offences and five later imprisoned for eighteen months: Ian Dixon, Terry Chandler, Trevor Hatton, Michael Randle, Pat Pottle; and the sixth, Helen Allegranza, to twelve months. (Picture) Bertrand Russell said that he was equally responsible, but the authorities ignored him and concentrated on the six young, unknown Committee of 100 officers. 3,000 military and civilian police were mobilised at Wethersfield. 5,000 demonstrated there and 850 were arrested. The Wethersfield demonstration was regarded by many as a failure and it was the Committee&#x27;s last act of large-scale civil disobedience. There were recriminations within the Committee, one internal memorandum saying that its policies had turned it into &quot;a public spectacle, a group isolated from the general body of public opinion and feeling.&quot; Herbert Read resigned from the Committee, saying that the action was &quot;strategically foolish&quot;. The Committee was weakened by the imprisonment of its officers.

The force used by the police at sit-down demonstrations surprised many of the demonstrators, which, with the Committee&#x27;s insistence on nonviolence and the use of pre-emptive arrests for conspiracy, discouraged many, and support dwindled. The Committee&#x27;s plan to &quot;fill the jails&quot; by means of mass civil disobedience, and thus compel the government to respond to their demands, was frustrated by the authorities imprisoning a few important members and ignoring the rest. The harsh sentences on the Wethersfield Six &quot;brought home to the Committee its inadequacy when faced with the might of the State,&quot; and some of the Committee&#x27;s leaders were not willing to &quot;fill the jails&quot;, mounting strenuous appeals against conviction or, in the case of Pat Pottle, going on the run.

===1962–1968===

By 1962, half of the original 100 signatories had resigned and had been replaced. The Committee was in debt and had to face the failure of its mass civil-disobedience campaign. It was dissolved and the campaign was decentralized, thirteen regional committees, each with a hundred members, becoming responsible for organizing demonstrations, with a co-ordinating National Committee. Of the regional committees, the London Committee of 100 was the most active and influential. A national magazine was launched by the London Committee in April 1963, published under the name &quot;Resistance&quot; from January 1964. Like CND, the Committee of 100 had begun with a self-appointed and unelected leadership, and, like CND, it faced pressure for greater participation by supporters. This re-organisation was intended to involve more people in decision making and to spread demonstrations throughout the country and had been anticipated in the creation of a number of subgroups in December 1961. Although Bertrand Russell opposed it, he wrote that &quot;The Committee has found that its support, named and on file, is so extensive that regional committees are required to accommodate this strength,&quot; But supporters became exhausted by the number of demonstrations they attended and &quot;neither London nor the regional committees had their full complement of a hundred.&quot;

In March 1962 Russell addressed a sit-down demonstration in Parliament Square against the sentences on the Wethersfield Six. All the 1,172 protesters were arrested, but there was a growing feeling that such demonstrations were becoming an end in themselves and would not now create a mass movement against nuclear weapons. (Contemporary research showed that public support for the unilateralist cause actually declined in the period when the Committee of 100 was most active.) A sit-down of 7,000 outside the Air Ministry planned for the following September had to be called off because of lack of support, a &quot;public assembly&quot; being held instead.

To underline its opposition to Russian nuclear weapons as well as those of the West, the Committee held a demonstration in Red Square, Moscow, at an international congress of the World Peace Council in the summer of 1962 calling for the abolition of all nuclear weapons and attacking the Soviet system.

From 1962 onwards, the Committee became increasingly radical and extended its campaigns to issues other than nuclear weapons. Peter Cadogan, an officer of the Committee, said it was &quot;trying to go in 12 directions at once&quot;, including campaigning for civil liberties in Greece, against Harold Wilson&#x27;s failure to produce a promised Vietnam peace initiative and against siting London&#x27;s third airport at Stansted. Diana Shelley, a member of the London Committee of 100, said that as the Committee adopted objectives other than nuclear disarmament it became &quot;less non-violent&quot;. In 1963 Russell resigned, though he remained in sympathy with the early aims and activities of the Committee and was careful not to denigrate it publicly. Following his departure, the public image of the Committee deteriorated, many signatories also resigned and &quot;the Committee of 100 ventured even further into the wilderness of libertarian politics&quot;.

Members of the Committee were responsible for the Spies for Peace revelations in 1963 about the Regional Seats of Government, a network of secret government bunkers, and later for the escape of George Blake from Wormwood Scrubs Prison.

The Committee&#x27;s interest in Greek politics was sparked by the banning of a march by the Greek &quot;Bertrand Russell Committee of 100&quot; in Easter 1963, by the expulsion of some of the British Committee of 100&#x27;s members when they attempted to join the march, and by the murder of Grigoris Lambrakis, a Greek MP and peace activist. Plans to protest against the London visit by King Paul and Queen Frederika in July 1963 were met by official attempts to prevent the demonstrations and draconian prison sentences on demonstrators. The government was criticized in the press for the severity of its treatment of the demonstrators and eventually there were embarrassing climb-downs. Some of the sentences were overturned on appeal and the Home Secretary, Henry Brooke, had to offer financial compensation. One of the demonstrators, Donald Rooum, proved that an offensive weapon had been planted on him and forced a public inquiry that criticized the police and led to the eventual imprisonment of three officers. But a nine-months sentence on Terry Chandler, secretary of the London Committee, was upheld on appeal. Diana Shelley said that the imprisonment of Chandler, &quot;the force which had driven&quot; the Committee throughout the summer, had a profoundly damaging effect. Four years after these events, following the 1967 military coup in Greece, a &quot;non-violent invasion&quot; of the Greek embassy resulted in prison sentences of up to fifteen months for Committee of 100 demonstrators.

The Committee of 100 was wound up in October 1968.

==Name==
According to Christopher Driver, the name was suggested by Gustav Metzger and Ralph Schoenman, who derived it from the Guelph Council of 100.

==Legacy==
Before the Committee of 100 came on the scene, civil disobedience on this scale was virtually unknown in Britain, although the researches of its advocates uncovered it as a strand of protest throughout the centuries. The Committee of 100, and comparable movements outside the UK (not least the Civil Rights Movement in the United States), made it a common method of social action, now familiar in environmental, animal rights and peace protests. However, non-violence, a strict principle of the Committee, is rare. The Committee also popularized a new method of organization derived from anarchism and hitherto unfamiliar to those in traditional political parties: without formal membership and based on decentralization and autonomous, self-selected &quot;working groups&quot; rather than elected executive committees.

<text>Aganisia is a small South American genus in the orchid family (Orchidaceae), subfamily Epidendroideae.

The genus was named after the Greek word ‘agnos’ (gratitude), perhaps referring to the sweet scent of its flowers.

These dwarf, epiphytic climbing orchids occur in mountainous or savanna forests and alongside rivers in Trinidad, Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, French Guiana, Suriname and Peru.

Aganisia produce pseudobulbs and small flowers produced from a creeping rhizome. These flowers generally reach 4 cm in width. Their color varies from a rose-tinted violet to a blue-tinted violet. The flower has a short column foot and an elongate stipe.

They are rarely cultivated.

<doc id="1302845" wikidata="Q7156339" url="?curid=1302845" title="Pawtucket Canal">
<text>Completed in 1796, the Pawtucket Canal was originally built as a transportation canal to circumvent the Pawtucket Falls of the Merrimack River in East Chelmsford, Massachusetts. In the early 1820s it became a major component of the Lowell power canal system. with the founding of the textile industry at what became Lowell.

The Pawtucket Falls are a mile long series of falls and rapids over which the Merrimack River drops 32 feet. The falls hampered the shipment of inland goods, mostly lumber, to the mouth of the Merrimack and Newburyport, Massachusetts. Newburyport was then one of the largest shipbuilding centers in New England, and a steady supply of wood from New Hampshire was critical to its industry.

The original canal was built by wealthy Boston merchants who formed a limited liability corporation called the Proprietors of Locks and Canals, one of the first of its kind in the United States. However, within a decade of its construction the Middlesex Canal was completed, connecting the Merrimack directly with Boston, Massachusetts. Bringing goods directly to Boston was more advantageous for merchants, and the Pawtucket Canal fell out of favor for inland transport.

The investors in the Boston Manufacturing Company having successfully built upon Francis Cabot Lowell and Paul Moody&#x27;s work in building a successfully integrated cotton mill at Waltham, Massachusetts on the Charles River were looking for a site that offered more waterpower and the Pawtucket Falls offered what they needed. In 1821 they bought the Proprietors of Locks and Canals and with it the water rights of the Merrimack River upstream from the Pawtucket Falls. The Pawtucket Canal was deepened to become a power canal, and the first of 5.6 miles of canals in the soon to be named City of Lowell, Massachusetts. The first canal built off the Pawtucket Canal was the Merrimack Canal, which powered the Merrimack Manufacturing Company, thus starting the Lowell experiment, and the first planned industrial city in the United States.

The canal is operated today by Boott Hydro, LLC.

<doc id="1302854" wikidata="Q1380645" url="?curid=1302854" title="Pyotr Andreyevich Tolstoy">
<text>Count Pyotr Andreyevich Tolstoy (; 1645–1729) was a Russian statesman and diplomat, prominent during and after the reign of Peter the Great. He was the ancestor of all the Counts Tolstoy, including the novelist Leo Tolstoy (September 9 [O.S. August 28], 1828 – November 20 [O.S. November 7], 1910) and Alexei Tolstoy the writer. His wife was Solomonida Timofeevna Dubrovskaya born 1660 and died 1722; he had two sons with her, Ivan (born 1685) and Peter (born 1680). Both his sons died in exile with him the year before his own death. He was, however, survived by many grandchildren: the family was recalled by the Empress Elizabeth, daughter of Peter the Great in 1760, and had all honors and land restored.

==Background==
Some historians assume Pyotr Tolstoy to have been an &quot;okolnichy&quot;, while others consider he came from a &quot;boyar&quot; background. He served in 1682 as Chamberlain at the court of childless Tsar Feodor III Alekseevich, Tsar 1676–1682. On account of his family relationship with the Miloslavsky family, he miscalculated the strength of the tsarevna Sophia Alekseyevna, (September 17 [N.S. September 27], 1657 – regent of Russia (1682–1689) – July 3 [N.S. July 14], 1704), full sister of Feodor III and third daughter, also, of Tsar Alexei I of Russia by his first wife, Maria Miloslavskaya and became one of her most energetic supporters, but contrived to join the other, and winning, side just before the final catastrophe.

Peter was the only son of Tsar Alexei I of Russia&#x27;s second marriage (to Nataliya Kyrillovna Naryshkina), and therefore, was the younger half-brother of childless Tsar Feodor III and of Sophia, temporary regent of Russia. For a long time Peter kept his latest supporter at arm&#x27;s length. However, in 1697, Tolstoy volunteered to go to Venice to learn Italian and ship-building, and Peter could not resist the subtle flattery implied in such a proposal from a middle-aged Muscovite noble.

==Career==
In November 1701, Tolstoy was appointed the first regularly accredited Russian ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, known as The Sublime Porte, and in this demanding role, he more than justified the confidence of the most exacting of masters. Even before Poltava, Tolstoy had the greatest difficulty in preventing the Turks from aiding the Swedes. 
When Charles XII took refuge on Turkish soil, Tolstoy instantly demanded his extradition. 
This diplomatic blunder only irritated the already alarmed Turks, and on 10 October 1710, Tolstoy was thrown into the Seven Towers, a proceeding tantamount to a declaration of war against Russia. 
On his release, in 1714, he returned to Russia, was created a senator, and closely associated himself with the omnipotent favourite, Aleksandr Menshikov.
In 1717, his position during Peter&#x27;s reign was secured once and for all by his successful mission to Naples to bring back the unfortunate tsarevich Alexei Petrovich, (28 February 1690 – by death penalty authorised by one hundred twenty six members of the equivalent of the Russian Duma following the wishes of his father, 7 July 1718, aged twenty-eight), the son of Tsar Peter I whom he may be said to have literally hunted to death.

For this, Tolstoy earned the undying hatred of the majority of the Russian people; but Tsar Peter I naturally regarded it as an inestimable service and loaded Tolstoy with honours and riches, appointing him, moreover, the head of the Secret Chancellery, or official torture chamber, a post for which Tolstoy, nearly eighty years old by then, was by nature eminently fitted, as his vigorous prosecution of the Mons Affair (1724) made clear.

He materially assisted Aleksandr Menshikov to raise the empress consort, to become Catherine I, (deceased less than two years later in 1727), to the throne on the decease of Peter in 1725, and the new sovereign made him a count and one of the six members of the newly instituted Supreme Privy Council (Верховный тайный совет).

Tolstoy was well aware that the elevation of the grand duke Peter II, son of the tsarevich Alexei, grandson of Piotr I would put an end to his own career and endanger his whole family.
Tsar Peter II Alexeyvich, here above, was the son of tsarevich Alexei Petrovich &quot;Romanov&quot;, executed at age twenty-eight, the widower at twenty-five of German Princess Charlotte Christine, sister in law of Emperor Charles VI of Austria. Peter II, grandson of Peter I of Russia, was Tsar of Russia aged twelve, for three years, and died aged fifteen. 

Therefore, when Menshikov, during the last days of Catherine I, declared in favour of Peter, Tolstoy endeavoured to form a party of his own whose object it was to promote the accession of Catherine&#x27;s second daughter, the tsarevna Elizabeth. But Menshikov was too strong and too quick for his ancient colleague. On the very day of Empress Catherine I&#x27;s death (11 May 1727), Tolstoy, now in his eighty-second year, was banished to the Solovetsky Monastery in the White Sea, where he died two years later.

Pyotr Tolstoy is the author of a sketch of the impressions made upon him by Western Europe during his tour in the years 1697–1698 and also of a detailed description of the Black Sea.

==Descendants==
Not all the later family lineages of nobility bearing the last name of Tolstoy list Pyotr Andreyevich as their ancestor. However, it is among his direct descendants in the male line where we find all the known Tolstoy writers, among them Leo Tolstoy, Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy, and Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy (the former and the latter having notable descendants as well). There were a number of statesmen and soldiers descending from Pyotr Andreyevich, as Education and Interior Minister Dmitry Tolstoy.

His other notable descendants were such literati as the pioneering Russian philosopher Pyotr Chaadayev and Vladimir Odoyevsky.

<doc id="1302855" wikidata="Q70249" url="?curid=1302855" title="Ludwig Hassenpflug">
<text>Hans Daniel Ludwig Friedrich Hassenpflug (26 February 1794 – 15 October 1862), German statesman, was born at Hanau in Hesse.

==Promotions==
He studied law at Göttingen, graduated in 1816, and took his seat as Assessor in the judicial chamber of the board of government (&quot;Regierungskollegium&quot;) at Kassel, of which his father Johann Hassenpflug was also a member, in 1821 he was nominated by the new elector, William II, fustisrat (councillor of justice); in 1832 he became &quot;Ministerialrat&quot; and reporter (Referent) to the ministry of Hesse-Kassel, and in May of the same year was appointed successively minister of justice and of the interior.

It was from this moment that he became conspicuous in the constitutional struggles of Germany. The reactionary system introduced by the elector William I had broken down before the revolutionary movements of 1830, and in 1831 Hesse had received a constitution. This development was welcome neither to the elector nor to the other German governments, and Hassenpflug deliberately set to work to reverse it. In doing so he gave the lie to his own early promise; for he had been a conspicuous member of the revolutionary Burschen-schaft at Göttingen, and had taken part as a volunteer in the German Campaign of 1813.

==Reactionary position==
It is unnecessary to enquire into the causes of the change. Hassenpfiug by training and tradition was a strait-laced official; he was also a first-rate lawyer, and his naturally arbitrary temper had from the first displayed itself in an attitude of overbearing independence towards his colleagues and even towards the elector. To such a man constitutional restrictions were intolerable, and from the moment he came into power he set to work to override them, by means of press censorship, legal quibbles, unjustifiable use of the electoral prerogatives, or frank supersession of the legislative rights of the Estates by electoral ordinances.

The story of the constitutional deadlock that resulted belongs to the history of Hesse-Kassel and Germany; so far as Hassenpflug himself was concerned, it made him, more even than Metternich, the Mephistopheles of the Reaction to the German people. In Hesse itself he was known as &quot;Hessens Hass und Fluch&quot; (Hesse&#x27;s hate and curse). In the end, however, his masterful temper became unendurable to the regent (Frederick William). In the summer of 1837 he was suddenly removed from his post as minister of the interior, and he thereupon left the elector&#x27;s service.

==Service outside Hesse==
In 1838 he was appointed head of the administration of the little principality of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, an office which he exchanged in the following year for that of civil governor of the grand-duchy of Luxembourg. Here, too, his independent character suffered him to remain only a year: he resented having to transact all business with the grand-duke (king of the Netherlands) through a Dutch official at the Hague; he protested against the absorption of the Luxembourg surplus in the Dutch treasury; and, failing to obtain redress, he resigned (1840).

From 1841 to 1850 he was in Prussian service, first as a member of the Prussian Supreme Tribunal (the ) and then (1846) as president of the high court of appeal () at Greifswald. In 1850 he was tried for peculation and convicted; and, though this judgment was reversed on appeal, he left the service of Prussia.

==1848 Revolutions==
With somewhat indecent haste (the appeal had not been heard) he was now summoned by the elector of Hesse once more to the head of the government, and he immediately threw himself again with zeal into the struggle against the constitution. He soon found, however, that the opinion of all classes, including the army, was solidly against him, and he decided to risk all on an alliance with the reviving fortunes of Austria, which was steadily working for the restoration of the &quot;status quo&quot; overthrown by the Revolutions of 1848.

On his advice the elector seceded, from the Northern Union established by Prussia and, on September 13, committed the folly of flying secretly from Hesse with his minister. They went to Frankfurt, where the federal diet had been re-established, and on the 21st persuaded the diet to decree an armed intervention in Hesse. This decree, carried out by Austrian troops, all but led to war with Prussia, but the unreadiness of the Berlin government led to the triumph of Austria and of Hassenpflug, who at the end of the year was once more installed in power at Kassel as minister of finance.

==Retirement and family==
His position was, however, not enviable; he was loathed and despised by all, and disliked even by his master. The climax came in November 1853, when he was publicly horse-whipped by the count of Isenburg-Wächtersbach, the elector&#x27;s son-in-law. The count was pronounced insane; but Hassenpflug was conscious of the method in his madness, and tendered his resignation. This was, however, not accepted; and it was not until 16 October 1855 that he was finally relieved of his offices. He retired to Marburg, where he died on 15 October 1862. He lived just long enough to hear of the restoration of the Hesse constitution of 1831 (21 June 1862), which it had been his life&#x27;s mission to destroy.

Of his publications the most important is &quot;Actenstücke, die landständischen Anklagen wider den Kurfurst/ir/ien hessischen Staatsminister Hassenpflug. Ein Beiträg zur Zeitgeschichte und zum neueren deutschen Staatsrechte, anonym.&quot; (Stuttgart and Tübingen, 1836). He was twice married, his first wife being the sister of the brothers Grimm. His son Karl Hassenpflug (1824–1890) was a distinguished sculptor.

<text>CILQ-FM (107.1 MHz) is a commercial radio station in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, known as &quot;Q107&quot;. The station broadcasts a mainstream rock format and is owned by Corus Entertainment. CILQ&#x27;s studios are in the Corus Quay building on Dockside Drive at Toronto&#x27;s Harbourfront neighbourhood.

CILQ-FM has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 40,000 watts. The transmitter is atop the CN Tower, with backup facilities at First Canadian Place. CILQ is also available through streaming audio, and is simulcast on Bell Satellite TV channel 954, and Shaw Direct channel 864.

==History==
CILQ signed on the air at 9 a.m. on May 22, 1977. The first song played on the station was &quot;Hard Rock Town&quot; by Murray McLauchlan, although the station officially signed on with Deodato&#x27;s &quot;Also Sprach Zarathustra&quot;.

CILQ debuted playing album rock, part of the numerous &quot;Superstars&quot; formatted stations developed by programme consultant Lee Abrams, heard in many large U.S. radio markets. The playlist consisted of about 1,000 songs, in a revolving card category system based on media sales data. Platinum albums were category B1 or B2. Older titles were D1 or D2. Canadian content was another category. Most of the music library was locked and not accessible to anyone except the program director, the music director and their assistants. Disc jockeys would pull only approved albums from a shelf in the control room. This contrasted with free form, progressive rock stations of that era, where the DJs chose their own music.

The original lineup of announcers was John Rode in mornings, Murray Smith in late mornings, Program Director Dave Charles in early afternoons, John Donabie in afternoon drive time, Mary-Ann Carpentier in evenings and Scott Marwood at nights. At 2 a.m., Marwood featured &quot;Odds &amp; Ends,&quot; a full album played in its entirety from his personal collection.

CILQ&#x27;s original owner was CFGM Broadcasting, a division of J. Allan Slaight&#x27;s Slaight Communications. The station was acquired by Western International Communications in 1985 when Slaight bought Standard Broadcasting, and became part of Corus Entertainment in 2000 when WIC&#x27;s assets were divided between Corus and Canwest Global.

In the 1990s, CILQ was a mainstream rock station. It switched to a classic rock format on September 1, 2000. On April 7, 2014, the station returned to a mainstream rock sound and adopted a new slogan: &quot;Toronto&#x27;s Rock Station&quot;.

==Programming==
Notable personalities associated with the station have included: Byrd (now with WDRV in Chicago), John Donabie, the duo of Jesse Dylan and Gene Valaitis, Scruff Connors, Kristy Knight, Joey Vendetta, Brother Jake Edwards, Jane Hawtin, Earl McCrae, John Derringer, Bill Carroll, Maureen Holloway, Andy Frost, Bob &quot;Iceman&quot; Segarini, Lee &quot;Beef&quot; Eckley, Rory O&#x27;Shea, Jonny &quot;Gonzo&quot; Mark, Joanne Wilder, Howard &quot;The Hungryman&quot; Cogan, Steve Anthony, Dusty Shannon, Alice Cooper, legendary Canadian rocker Kim Mitchell, with Al Joynes and Jennifer Valentyne.

&quot;Psychedelic Psunday&quot; was a program that aired every Sunday from 9am to 9pm on CILQ-FM from 1985 to 2018. The program consisted entirely of music from the psychedelic era, spanning from 1965 to 1975.

In September 1997, CILQ, along with CHOM-FM in Montreal, became the first Canadian radio stations to air &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, syndicated from New York City. Stern was heard on Q107 for four years, ending his run in November 2001.

On August 10, 2005, the station sparked controversy when it aired a recording of a Rolling Stones concert from 2002. The Stones were appearing in concert in Toronto the same evening, and many listeners had interpreted advance promotion for the broadcast as implying that CILQ would in fact be airing live from that evening&#x27;s concert. Although he denied that the station intended to give that impression, station manager JJ Johnston apologized to listeners two days later.

In early 2009, the station introduced &quot;Nights with Alice Cooper&quot;, airing from 9p.m. to 2a.m. Sunday. Jeff Woods hosts a show called &quot;Records and Rockstars&quot; to give listeners the background stories to some of their favourite music.

In 2022, CILQ suspended and then &quot;parted ways&quot; with long-time morning host John Derringer over allegations that he had bullied other members of staff for years.

<text>The Cosumnes River is a river in northern California in the United States. It rises on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada and flows approximately into the Central Valley, emptying into the Mokelumne River in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.

The Cosumnes is one of very few rivers in the western Sierra without major dams. The Nature Conservancy&#x27;s Cosumnes River Preserve is located just upstream from the Delta. Towns and cities along the Cosumnes River include Plymouth, Rancho Murieta, Sloughhouse, Wilton, Elk Grove, and Galt.

The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment has issued an advisory regarding fish caught from the body of water.

==Name==
The Cosumnes River is thought to have been named as the Mokelumne and Tuolumne rivers were, using the &quot;-umne&quot; suffix meaning &quot;people of&quot;. The prefix is derived from the Miwok word &quot;kosum&quot; meaning &quot;salmon&quot;. Chinook Salmon runs are rarely, if ever, seen above Rancho Murieta as a result of diversions in the area.

Many locals pronounce the river&#x27;s name , inserting an &quot;n&quot; where there is none in the first syllable. Given the etymological similarity between &quot;Cosumnes,&quot; on the one hand, and &quot;Tuolumne&quot; and &quot;Mokelumne&quot; on the other (see next paragraph), a case can be made that the most accurate historical pronunciation is &quot;kasumme,&quot; since the &quot;n&quot; is essentially silent in the pronunciation of both &quot;Tuolumne&quot; and Mokelumne,&quot; and there is no &quot;s&quot; or &quot;z&quot; sound at the end of those names. An older pronunciation common among Central Valley locals is ), which includes the epenthetic [n] in the first syllable, omits the initial [n] of the final syllable (as in &quot;Mokelumne&quot; and &quot;Tuolumne&quot;), has the expected value for the letter in an open syllable (created by the omission of the last [n]), and uses a final [s] rather than a [z].

Cosumnes River College, a two-year community college located in the southern part of Sacramento, California is named after the river being located only a few miles off campus. CRC&#x27;s mascot is the Hawk due to the number of hawks that inhabit the river area.

==Geography==

Flowing from the western slope of the central Sierra Nevada mountains, the Cosumnes starts as North, Middle and South forks cutting canyons through the El Dorado and Amador County Gold Country before converging just east of Highway 49. The North Fork, about long, begins at the Singleton Springs in El Dorado County, at the head of Leek Spring Valley, above sea level. It flows west, past the unincorporated community of Meiss, receiving Van Horn Creek and Butte Creek from the right. At Somerset, it is joined by its largest tributary, Camp Creek, from the right. Below Camp Creek it flows through the granite narrows of the Cosumnes River Gorge, a popular rock-climbing area. The river then turns abruptly south and passes Nashville before joining the Middle Fork near Enterprise.

The Middle Fork, long, also starts in El Dorado County, just two ridges south of the headwaters of the North Fork. It flows westward for its entire course, roughly parallel to the North Fork. The upper half of the river flows down a steep canyon, past Croft, receiving Dogtown Creek from the right at Omo Ranch. Below Omo Ranch it flows through a gentler valley, past Outingdale, then enters another short canyon where it receives the South Fork Cosumnes River from the left. The smaller South Fork, about long, flows generally west then northwest along the El Dorado/Amador County line, to join the Middle Fork. Shortly below this confluence the combined rivers join with the North Fork to form the Cosumnes River.

The Cosumnes River proper continues west, receiving Big Indian Creek from the south and passing under SR 49 (Golden Chain Highway). It winds through the scenic Sierra foothills through a series of short canyons separated by small ranching valleys. It receives Big Canyon Creek from the right, then Little Indian Creek from the left, before flowing through its last gorge and emerging at the former mining site of Michigan Bar. The entire stretch of the Cosumnes River between the confluence of the forks and a point one mile (1.6 km) above Michigan Bar define the El Dorado/Amador County line; below this point, the river flows into southern Sacramento County.

The Cosumnes flows west through Rancho Murieta, an affluent outer suburb of the Sacramento metropolitan area. Two small diversion dams cross the river near Van Vleck Park just upstream from the town. Below Rancho Murieta the Cosumnes flows through an agricultural valley, turning southwest near Sloughhouse. A few miles downstream the Folsom South Canal crosses under the Cosumnes River via an inverted siphon. The Cosumnes continues southwest, passing Sheldon and Wilton, receives Deer Creek from the right, then is crossed by Highway 99 near Elk Grove. Below Highway 99 it enters the nearly Cosumnes River Preserve, which include some of the largest remaining wetlands and riparian areas in the Central Valley. It enters the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta near Mokelumne City, turning west once more to join the Mokelumne on the border of Sacramento County and San Joaquin County.

==River modifications==

As one of the last rivers flowing from the west slope of the Sierra without a major dam, the Cosumnes is a vital example of a healthy watershed. However, its salmon and steelhead populations have been harmed by invasive fish species and pollution from illegal mining activity, as well as the two irrigation diversion structures near Rancho Murieta. There are plans to re-introduce salmon spawning into the river.

Some water is diverted from two tributaries of the North Fork – Camp Creek and Sly Park Creek – for irrigation in the Camino area. Sly Park Dam, which creates Jenkinson Lake, is the largest water storage facility in the Cosumnes River watershed. The dam and reservoir are part of the extensive Central Valley Project. However, the project has negligible effects on river flows, and does not block historic salmon spawning runs.

Dams have been proposed to be built on the main stem to control flows, but these plans have largely stalled because of the river&#x27;s unique free-flowing status and its importance as a wildlife habitat. Sacramento County officials continue to lobby for the construction of a flood-control dry dam above Rancho Murieta at Michigan Bar. Such proposals are still the subject of ongoing debate.

== Flooding History ==
Over the past few decades, the Cosumnes River Watershed has experienced significant, sometimes devastating, flooding. The most notable flooding occurred in 1986,1997, 2017, and 2023. The 1997 storm was the largest recorded event on the Cosumnes River, with peak flow of 97,000 cubic feet per second at the Michigan Bar stream gauge estimated to be close to a 200-year event. Many Cosumnes levees breached during this storm.

Reclamation District 800, a California Reclamation District, is responsible for managing a series of levees along the Cosumnes River stretching from the edge of the community of Rancho Murieta to just upstream of California State Route 99.

<text>The Montclair Connection is a short section of double-track railroad on the NJ Transit Rail Operations system in New Jersey, United States, connecting the former end of the Montclair Branch at Bay Street station to the old Boonton Line southeast of Walnut Street station.

The connection opened on Monday, September 30, 2002, at a cost of $63 million. At the same time, Bay Street Station was rebuilt and Montclair State University station was built. The Montclair and Boonton lines were combined into the Montclair-Boonton Line, and passenger service was ended on the former Boonton Line east of the connection; the line was single-tracked and used by Norfolk Southern Railway for freight for a time; it is currently out of service. Disuse has caused sections of the line to become derelict, in particular east of the Passaic River where DB and WR drawbridges have been condemned. As part of the project, three Boonton Line stations were closed on September 20, 2002; Benson Street, Rowe Street, and Arlington.
The Montclair Connection was built to give passengers on the Boonton Line direct access to New York Penn Station; prior to the change, Boonton Line trains could only go to Hoboken Terminal. The idea for the connection was first proposed in 1929 when the Regional Plan Association proposed linking the Delaware, Lackawanna &amp; Western Railroad&#x27;s Montclair Branch with the Erie Railroad&#x27;s Greenwood Lake Branch, but the plan was abandoned due to the economic difficulties associated with the Great Depression.

The merger between the Erie and Lackawanna Railroads in 1960 sped up the reconfiguration that was completed in March 1963, when the former Erie Main Line was connected to the Lackawanna’s Boonton Line south of Paterson station to form today’s Main Line. Meanwhile, the Boonton Line west of Mountain View station was linked to the Erie’s Greenwood Lake Branch to form the current Boonton Line.

The reconfiguration again spurred the Montclair Connection idea, and in preparation, service was cut back from Lackawanna Terminal to Bay Street by Conrail in 1981. But the proposal was introduced until the late 1980s, when New Jersey Transit proposed for a one-track connection that would have accommodated only diesel trains. Later, the plans were revised to include a two-track connection and five miles of overhead catenary wires, allowing for electric train service and increased travel destinations. After negotiations with the Township of Montclair, an agreement was reached in 1998, and construction began in 1999.

<text>Pentti Juha Kalervo Kouri (12 February 1949 – 22 January 2009) was a Finnish economist and venture capitalist. He was born in Kemijärvi.

==Education and career==
Kouri was the first Finn to get a scholarship to the United World College of the Atlantic. After graduating from there, he got his master&#x27;s degree in economics from the University of Helsinki in 1970. In that same year, when he was 21 years old, he was hired by the International Monetary Fund. It was at IMF&#x27;s research organization where Kouri first met Michael G. Porter, an Australian economist, with whom he later developed the Kouri-Porter model.

Kouri received his PhD in Economics from MIT in 1974. He has served as a professor of economics at Stanford, Yale, Helsinki, and New York City universities.

Later he became known as a venture capitalist. For instance, he managed George Soros&#x27;s investments to Finland. Today, he is remembered for his participation in the controversial &quot;Kouri-deals&quot; in the late 1980s. In the &quot;Kouri-deals&quot;, a group of investors including Kouri collaborated to buy a majority of the two largest banks of Finland, mostly with borrowed money, causing a political outcry. 

==Personal life==
Kouri was married to Elly O. Kouri and divorced in 1995. Pentti Kouri died in January 2009 in Los Angeles. Until his death, he sat on the Board of Trustees of Dia Art Foundation.

In May 2001, the Kouri Capital group led by Kouri and George Soros was declared bankrupt.

<doc id="1302886" wikidata="Q279380" url="?curid=1302886" title="2004 United States presidential election in Illinois">
<text>The 2004 United States presidential election in Illinois took place on November 2, 2004, and was part of the 2004 United States presidential election. Voters chose 21 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.

Illinois was won by Democratic nominee John Kerry by a 10.3% margin of victory. Prior to the election, all 12 news organizations considered this a state Kerry would win, or otherwise considered as a safe blue state. A reliable blue state that no Republican has won since Bush&#x27;s father George H. W. Bush in 1988, Illinois voted for Democratic Senator John Kerry in 2004 with almost 55% of the vote.

Kerry&#x27;s victory in Illinois was due to carrying seventy percent of the vote in the Chicago area&#x27;s Cook County, where about 43% of Illinois&#x27; population resides. Excluding Cook County, President George W. Bush would have won the state 54.6% (1,749,203 votes) to 45.3% (1,452,265 votes). President Bush was victorious in Chicago&#x27;s collar counties, although the results in those counties were narrower than his victories downstate. 

As of the 2024 presidential election, this was the last presidential election in which a Democrat failed to carry any of Chicago&#x27;s collar counties. This is the first election in which the Republican nominee has won the national popular vote without carrying Illinois. It also marks the only occurrence in which Illinois has voted for the losing candidate in two consecutive presidential elections (after it had voted against Bush in 2000). Bush was the first Republican to ever win two terms without ever carrying the state.

==Primaries==
The primaries and general elections coincided with those for Senate and Congress, as well as those for state offices.

===Turnout===
For the state-run primaries (Democratic and Republican), turnout was 25.23%, with 1,801,090 votes cast. For the general election, turnout was 70.33%, with 5,274,322 votes cast.

===Democratic===
The 2004 Illinois Democratic presidential primary was held on March 16 in the U.S. state of Illinois as one of the Democratic Party&#x27;s statewide nomination contests ahead of the 2004 presidential election.

By the time of the Illinois primary, Kerry was seen as having all but formally secured the nomination.

===Republican===

The 2004 Illinois Republican presidential primary was held on March 16, 2004, in the U.S. state of Illinois as one of the Republican Party&#x27;s state primaries ahead of the 2004 presidential election.

Incumbent president George W. Bush won the primary. Bush was running for reelection without a major opponents, and with no opponents on the ballot in Illinois.

Illinois assigned 60 directly elected delegates (the state had another 13 delegates that were not directly elected by voters). The Illinois primary was a so-called &quot;Loophole&quot; primary. This meant that the statewide presidential preference vote was a &quot;beauty contest&quot;, from which no delegates would be assigned. Instead, the delegates were assigned by separate direct-votes on delegate candidates (whose proclaimed presidential preferences were listed beside their names on the ballot). These delegates were noted voted on at-large by a state vote, but rather by congressional district votes. The number of delegates each congressional district would be able to elect had been decided based upon the strength of that district&#x27;s vote for the Republican nominee (Bush) in the previous 2000 election. This meant that four delegates each were elected from Illinois&#x27;s 6th, 8th, 10th, 11th, 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 18th, and 19th congressional districts, three delegates each were elected from Illinois&#x27;s 12th and 17th congressional districts, and two delegates each were elected from Illinois&#x27;s 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 7th, and 9th congressional districts 

Ten of the remaining delegates not directly elected by congressional district were selected at the Illinois Republican Party Convention, and were unpledged delegates. The other three would be unplugged ex-officio delegates, roles filled by the states National Committeeman, the National Committeewoman, and the chairman of the Illinois&#x27;s Republican Party.

==Campaign==

===Predictions===
There were 12 news organizations who made state-by-state predictions of the election. Here are their last predictions before election day.

===Polling===
Kerry won every single pre-election poll. Out of the 12 polls taken, Kerry won 9 of them with 52% or higher. The final 3 polls averaged Kerry leading 54% to Bush with 41%.

===Fundraising===
Bush raised $6,892,187. Kerry raised $7,100,400.

===Advertising and visits===
Neither campaign advertised or visited this state during the fall election season because it was expected not to be competitive and Kerry had a solid lead in the state.

==Analysis==
Illinois has voted for the Democratic presidential candidate in every election from 1992 on, each time by a double-digit margin. Prior to 1992, Illinois was considered a swing state with perhaps a slight Republican lean; until 2000, no Republican had won the White House without carrying Illinois, and it voted Republican in every election from 1952 to 1988 except 1960 and 1964, even voting against Jimmy Carter in his winning 1976 campaign. The blue trend in the &quot;Land of Lincoln&quot; in presidential elections can be largely attributed to the dramatic expansion of the Democratic margin in Cook County, which contains the city of Chicago and its inner suburbs and makes up about 41.2% of the state&#x27;s population. While Democrats routinely won Cook County following the New Deal realignment except in some Republican landslide years (1952, 1956, 1972), until 1996, they did not themselves crack 60% in the county except in their own landslides of 1936 and 1964. In 1992, however, Clinton got 58.2% of the vote in Cook County, approaching 60% and a higher vote share than any nominee had received in the county since 1964, despite the election having three major participants. In 1996, Clinton got 66.8% of the vote, blowing past Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s and Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s vote shares in 1936 and 1964, respectively, and Gore only improved on this in 2000. In 2004, John Kerry became the first nominee of any party to crack 70% in Cook County since Warren G. Harding in 1920, and the Democrat has never been below 70% in the county since.

In addition, the historically Republican &quot;collar counties&quot; outside Chicago began trending less strongly Republican in the Clinton years, and this continued into the Bush years. In 1996, Clinton became the first Democrat to crack 40% in the largest collar county, DuPage County, since 1964, and Gore slightly improved on Clinton&#x27;s vote share in 2000, holding Bush to a 13.3% margin in a county Ford had carried by 40.5% in 1976 and George H. W. Bush, by 39.4% in 1988. In 2004, John Kerry improved on Gore&#x27;s vote share in DuPage County by 2.9%, holding Bush to a single-digit margin of 9.6%--the smallest Republican margin of victory in the county since 1892 (apart from the 1912 election, when the Republican Party was divided and DuPage County voted for Theodore Roosevelt).

Outside the Chicago area, Kerry performed well in the traditionally Democratic region of Metro East, as well as in Champaign County, a moderately populated historically Republican county that has voted Democratic in every election from 1992 on. Bush had done well in most of rural Illinois in 2000, and deepened his support there in 2004. However, given the developments in massively-populated Cook and DuPage Counties, this was not enough to materially influence the result.

As of the 2024 presidential election, this is the last election in which DeKalb County, DuPage County, Kane County, Lake County, Will County, and Winnebago County voted for a Republican presidential candidate.

===By congressional district===
Kerry won 10 of the 19 congressional districts, including one that elected a Republican.
==Electors==
Technically the voters of Illinois cast their ballots for electors: representatives to the Electoral College. Illinois is allocated 21 electors because it has 19 congressional districts and 2 senators. All candidates who appear on the ballot or qualify to receive write-in votes must submit a list of 21 electors, who pledge to vote for their candidate and his or her running mate. Whoever wins the majority of votes in the state is awarded all 21 electoral votes. Their chosen electors then vote for president and vice president. Although electors are pledged to their candidate and running mate, they are not obligated to vote for them. An elector who votes for someone other than his or her candidate is known as a faithless elector.

The electors of each state and the District of Columbia met on December 13, 2004, to cast their votes for president and vice president. The Electoral College itself never meets as one body. Instead the electors from each state and the District of Columbia met in their respective capitols.

The following were the members of the Electoral College from Illinois. All were pledged to and voted for Kerry and Edwards:
# Constance A. Howard
# Carrie Austin
# Shirley R. Madigan
# Tony Munoz

<doc id="1302906" wikidata="Q1337810" url="?curid=1302906" title="Paul Gorguloff">
<text>Paul Gorguloff, originally Pavel Timofeyevich Gorgulov (; June 29, 1895 – September 14, 1932), was a Russian émigré and assassin who shot and fatally wounded the French President Paul Doumer at a book fair at the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild in Paris on May 6, 1932.

==Early life==
Gorguloff was born in Labinskaya in the Kuban region of Russia. He studied medicine before he served in the First World War in which he was badly wounded in the head. During the Russian Revolution of 1917, he served with the White Russian Army against the Bolsheviks, before emigrating to Prague in Czechoslovakia, where he completed his studies. He was later expelled from Czechoslovakia for practising abortion, which was then illegal.

Gorguloff moved to Paris and then to Nice, where in 1931, he was once more found to be committing illegal medical acts and threatened with expulsion. He applied for a permit to live in Monaco, which was accepted, and he lived there until May 4, 1932.

== Ideology ==
Gorguloff followed an esoteric set of beliefs revolving around an idealized version of the ancient Scythian culture of the steppes, agrarianism, and ultranationalism. Most knowledge of Gorguloff&#x27;s ideology stems from his writings when he was in Paris. One of these writings, &quot;The National Peasant&#x27;s,&quot; outlines his ideal system of government for Russia: a totalitarian rule under a hyper-militarized Green party. This state would be led by a &quot;green dictator&quot;, similar to the Nazi concept of the Führerprinzip. Gorguloff was an emphatic supporter of fascism, and his ideological beliefs are considered an early form of what is known in the modern era as eco-fascism. His last book, which police found when arresting him, was entitled “Memoirs of Dr. Pavel Gorgulov, Supreme Chairman of the Political Party of Russian Fascists, Who Killed the President of the Republic”. Gorgulov was an outspoken Russian supremacist, and believed that all non-Russians and non-orthodox Christians, especially Jews, should not be citizens. To this end, Gorguloff was a firm believer in the Judeo-Bolshevik conspiracy theory. Despite his fervent anti-socialism, he despised both monarchism and Free-Market capitalism, which he viewed as anti-peasant. In much of his poetry, he reminisces about the &quot;wild&quot; and &quot;barbarian&quot; Russia, which he believes to be the successor of Scythian civilization. Gorguloff believed it was Russia&#x27;s duty as the torch bearer of &quot;primitive spirituality&quot; to defeat western civilization, which he saw as decadent and modern, as opposed to Russia&#x27;s traditional and agrarian nature.

==Assassination of Paul Doumer==
On May 6, 1932, a book fair was being held at the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild in Paris, and the President of France, Paul Doumer, was present.

Gorguloff arrived at the hotel concealing a Browning FN Model 1910 gun. He then approached the President from behind, pulled out his gun and fired three shots. Two of them hit the President, one in the back of the head and the other in the right armpit. The President fell to the floor. He was rushed to the Beaujon Hospital in Paris but died the next day. One of the authors at the exhibition, Claude Farrère, managed to wrestle with Gorguloff until the police arrived. Gorguloff&#x27;s motive for the murder was that he believed France had failed to support the White Movement in Russia against Bolshevism. 

Gorguloff was arrested and brought to trial at the Assize Court on July 25, 1932. He was noted for his unusual behavior on trial ranging from frequent interruptions of other people&#x27;s testimonies to bizarre claims like that he had planned trips to the moon, and even that he was the kidnapper of the Lindbergh Baby. Nevertheless, two days later, after rejecting the idea that he was insane, the jury condemned Gorguloff to death. On 20 August, the Court of Cassation, France&#x27;s final appeal court, rejected a defence of insanity. On September 14, 1932, Gorguloff was executed at La Santé Prison in Paris by guillotine. His last words were &quot;Россия, моя страна!&quot; (&quot;Russia, my country!&quot;). He was buried at Ivry Cemetery.

The gun used in the assassination is now in the Musée des Collections Historiques de la Préfecture de Police in Paris.

<doc id="1302908" wikidata="Q8245340" url="?curid=1302908" title="Iman (Islam)">
<text>Iman (, , also &#x27;recognition&#x27;) in Islamic theology denotes a believer&#x27;s recognition of faith and deeds in the religious aspects of Islam. Its most simple definition is the belief in the six Pillars of faith, known as .

The term has been delineated in both the Quran and hadith. According to the Quran, must be accompanied by righteous deeds and the two together are necessary for entry into Paradise. In the hadith, in addition to and form the three dimensions of the Islamic religion.

There exists a debate both within and outside Islam on the link between faith and reason in religion, and the relative importance of either. Some scholars contend that faith and reason spring from the same source and must be harmonious.

== Etymology ==
In Arabic, () means or . It is the verbal noun of , or .

== Definition and meaning ==
In a hadith, the Islamic prophet Muhammad defined as &quot;an acknowledgement in the heart, a voicing with the tongue, and an activity with the limbs.&quot; Faith is confidence in a real truth. When people have confidence, they submit themselves to that truth. It is not sufficient just to know the truth, but the recognition of the heart should be expressed by the tongue which is the manifestation of intelligence and at last to reflect this confidence in their activities.

Hamiduddin Farahi, while explaining the meaning of in his exegesis, wrote:

The definition of according to Ahl al-Sunnah wa&#x27;l-Jama&#x27;ah is:

*Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Barr said:
*Al-Shafi&#x27;i said in :
*Muhammad bin Ismail bin Muhammad bin Al-Fadl Al-Taymi Al-Asbhani said:
*Sufyan ibn &#x27;Uyaynah said:
*Al-Ash&#x27;ari said:

== The Six Pilars of Faith ==
Faith () includes six primary beliefs:

# Belief in the existence and oneness of God (Tawhid, the Islamic concept of Monotheism).
# Belief in the existence of angels such as Jibril (Gabriel), Mikail (Michael), Israfil, and more.
# Belief in the existence of the books of which God is the author: the Quran (revealed to Muhammad), the Gospel (revealed to Jesus), the Torah (revealed to prophets), Psalms (revealed to David), the Scrolls of Moses, and the Scrolls of Abraham.
# Belief in the existence of prophets: Muhammad being the last of them, Jesus the penultimate, and others sent before them like Moses, Abraham, David, Joseph, Jacob.
# Belief in the existence of the Day of Judgment: On that day, humanity will be divided into two groups: that of paradise and that of hell. These groups are composed of subgroups.
# Belief in the existence of God&#x27;s predestination (, ) due to God&#x27;s omniscience, whether it involves good or bad.

Of these, the first four are mentioned and the fifth implied in 2:285 of the Quran. All six appear in the first hadith of the collection , where the angel Gabriel asks to be told of and Muhammad replies:

Another similar narration ascribed to Muhammad is:

== Delineation in the Qur&#x27;an and hadith ==

In the Qur&#x27;an, iman is one of the 10 qualities which cause one to be the recipient of God&#x27;s mercy and reward. The Qur&#x27;an states that faith can grow with the remembrance of God. The Qur&#x27;an also states that nothing in this world should be dearer to a true believer than faith.

Al-‘Abbas reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “He has tasted the sweetness of faith who is content with Allah as a Lord, Islam as a religion, and Muhammad as a messenger.”
Source: Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim 34
 He also said that no one can be a true believer unless he loves phrophet Muhammad peace be up on him more than his children, parents and relatives. At another instance, he remarked that it is this love with Allah and Muhammad after which a person can be aware of the real taste of faith.

Amin Ahsan Islahi, a notable exegete of the Qur&#x27;an has clarified the nature of this love:

Islahi and Abul A&#x27;la Maududi both have inferred that the Quranic comparison of a good word and a bad word in chapter 14 is a comparison of faith and disbelief. Thus, the Quran is effectively comparing faith to a tree whose roots are deep in the soil and branches spread in the vastness of the sky.

 is also the subject of a supplication uttered by Muhammad to God:

===The Seventy-Seven Branches of Faith===

<text>The Jan Kesner Gallery is a fine art photography gallery in Los Angeles, California. It was the first woman-owned photography gallery in Los Angeles when it was established in 1987. The gallery is known primarily for its focus on contemporary and master works with conceptual or minimal themes, and for its support of regional and international photography.

==History==
The Jan Kesner Gallery was only the second artistic forum to focus on fine art photography in Los Angeles when it was founded by Jan Kesner in 1987 (preceded by the G. Ray Hawkins Gallery, which opened in 1975).

The Gallery made headlines in 1989 with its controversial &quot;Selected Sin&quot; group exhibition featuring works by Ruth Bernhard, Imogen Cunningham, Robert Mapplethorpe, Jan Saudek, Andres Serrano, and Edward Weston. The exhibition was a powerful response to government censorship of photography deemed inappropriate, political, or risqué.

In 1990, the Gallery exhibited &quot;Vintage Photographs from the 1950s&quot; featuring the work of Bruce Bellas, better known as &quot;Bruce of Los Angeles&quot;. Bellas&#x27; photography primarily consisted of the nude male physique, making the Gallery one of the first in the nation to accept the art form in its own right.

==Artists==
The Gallery has exhibited many notable photographers, including Ansel Adams, Diane Arbus, Imogen Cunningham, Larry Fink, and Lewis Hine. The Gallery also represents a number of prominent artists, among them are John Humble, Richard Misrach, Arne Svenson, Rubén Ortiz Torres, Frank van der Salm, Dan Winters, and Max Yavno.

<text>CMT is a Canadian English language discretionary specialty channel owned as a joint venture between Corus Entertainment (which owns a controlling 90% interest) and Paramount Networks Americas (which owns the remaining 10%), owners of the flagship CMT channel in the United States.

This channel was originally established on January 1, 1995 as the New Country Network under the joint ownership of Shaw Communications, who acquired Maclean-Hunter&#x27;s stake in 1994, and Rawlco Communications. Later, NCN was relaunched on September 14, 1996 as CMT with CBS Cable acquiring the stake. Prior to its Canadian launch, the American version of CMT was available in Canada from 1984.

As with its U.S. counterpart, CMT previously devoted a large amount of its programming to country music, with such programming as music videos and concert specials. Over time, the channel shifted its focus towards family-oriented general entertainment such as sitcoms, to the point where music programming was eventually axed in August 2017.

It is one of two Paramount-branded channels that are owned by Corus; the companies also partner on Nickelodeon (which is wholly owned by Corus).

==History==
===Launch and dispute===
Prior to the launch of CMT Canada, the U.S.-based country television network, Country Music Television, had been available in Canada since 1984, one year after the channel&#x27;s launch in the United States.

In June 1994, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) licensed a series of new Canadian specialty television channels; among the ones whose licence was granted was The Country Network, whose programming provisions required it to primarily feature country music videos (a minimum of 90%). The licence was granted to a partnership between Maclean-Hunter (which owned 60% majority control) and Rawlco Communications (which owned the remaining 40%).

At the time, the CRTC had a policy that if a Canadian specialty service was licensed and that service&#x27;s format was competitive with a foreign service&#x27;s format that was licensed to operate in Canada, the foreign service could be dropped from the list of channels eligible for cable carriage in Canada. Due to Country Music Television&#x27;s competitive format, the CRTC terminated CMT&#x27;s eligibility rights in Canada as a foreign service on June 6, 1994. Television distributors such as cable and satellite television operators could continue distributing Country Music Television until The Country Network began operations.

In March 1994, one year before the channel&#x27;s launch, Maclean-Hunter had been purchased by Rogers Communications.
On January 1, 1995, the channel launched as New Country Network (NCN). On that date, Canadian pay television service providers were not allowed to offer Country Music Television. In retaliation for being barred from Canada, the U.S. service launched a complaint under the North American Free Trade Agreement and ceased carriage of videos by Canadian artists without major U.S. record deals.
After months of negotiations, the matter was settled when it was announced that CBS Cable, then owners of CMT, would purchase a minority stake in the service. NCN was relaunched as CMT on September 14, 1996. The majority interest was acquired by Shaw Communications at the same time; it was later included in the spinoff of the broadcasting assets then owned by Shaw as Corus Entertainment in 1999. The controversy also resulted in an effective change to CRTC policy – if a foreign channel is already available in Canada and a new Canadian equivalent is subsequently licensed, cable providers are no longer required to drop the foreign service.

===Shift away from country music===
In 2016, as part of the removal of the genre protection rules, CMT was migrated to the CRTC&#x27;s new standard conditions of license for discretionary services; these changes removed the requirement for CMT to air any music programming at all. Corus stated in its description of service for CMT that it would be devoted to comedy and reality programming, films, and &quot;one of a kind music programming&quot;. Despite the changes, Corus must still invest at least 11% of CMT&#x27;s annual gross revenue to fund the production of Canadian music videos, but they no longer necessarily have to be for country music videos.

These programming changes took effect on August 28, 2017, when CMT dropped all country music video programming from its schedule. The change in programming was widely criticized by stakeholders in Canada&#x27;s country music industry, due to the loss of what had been a major promotional platform for Canadian performers; Corus stated that it would still promote Canadian country music through its other platforms (including its country music radio stations and some Global programming). 

Canada wouldn&#x27;t have another country music-related TV channel until rival broadcaster Stingray Group launched Stingray Country in 2019.

==Programming==

, CMT&#x27;s programming consists primarily of acquired sitcoms, dramas (specifically &quot;&quot;), reality shows, and lifestyle programming, some of which are reruns of Canadian-produced series to fulfill Canadian content obligations. It no longer originates any original programming of its own, nor does it air any original programming emanating from the American CMT channel such as the CMT Music Awards (which remains available to most Canadian cable subscribers through CBS affiliates).

When CMT was launched as New Country Network on January 1, 1995, the CRTC required that 90% of the station&#x27;s programming consist of music videos. The CRTC dropped that requirement to 70% on February 28, 2001, and reduced it even further to 50% on February 28, 2006. With the retirement of genre protection rules in 2016, CMT was no longer required to air music videos, leading to the channel dropping music programming altogether the following year in favor of comedy programming—drawn primarily from off-network reruns of sitcoms.

Under its country music format, CMT previously produced its own original Canadian programming, such as &quot;Karaoke Star Jr.&quot;, &quot;Tori &amp; Dean: Cabin Fever&quot;, and &quot;The Wilkinsons&quot;, with much of the channel&#x27;s country music-related programming hosted by Paul McGuire.

<text>Vexin () is a historical county of northern France. It covers a verdant plateau on the right bank (north) of the Seine running roughly east to west between Pontoise and Romilly-sur-Andelle (about 20 km from Rouen), and north to south between Auneuil and the Seine near Vernon. The plateau is crossed by the Epte and the Andelle river valleys.

==History==
The name &quot;Vexin&quot; is derived from a name for a Gaulish tribe now known as the Veliocasses. They had inhabited the area and made Rouen their most important city.

The Norse nobleman Rollo of Normandy (c. 846 – c. 931), the first ruler of the Viking principality that became Normandy, made several incursions into the western half of the county. He halted his actions when the Carolingian king Charles the Simple abandoned the part of the territory that Rollo occupied under the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte in 911. The terms of the treaty established the Duchy of Normandy and fixed its boundary with the Kingdom of France along the river Epte. This divided the county of Vexin into two parts:

*Norman Vexin (&quot;Vexin normand&quot;), bounded by the rivers Epte, Andelle and Seine, which became part of the Duchy of Normandy.
*French Vexin (&quot;Vexin français&quot;), bounded by the rivers Epte, Oise and Seine, which remained part of the Île-de-France province.

During the twelfth century, the county of Vexin was a heavily contested border between the Angevin kings of England and Capetian France (see Capetian-Plantagenet rivalry). It was of particular importance due to its close proximity to Paris and the location of the route to the coastal cities of Normandy. As a result, Vexin was the site of defensive castle construction, notably at Château Gaillard. 

===World War II===
During the liberation of Vexin, German troops in the forests of Marainville, Montgison, and Longues carried out a surprise attack against the American defenders in attempt to reoccupy the village of Fontenay-Saint-Père. Beginning 20 August 1944, fighting broke out, with about 30,000 troops engaged in total; in the nine days of fighting, multiple offensives and counter-offensives were carried out across the city. This eventually ended when a reinforced American army managed to defeat the German battalion. 

In total, there were about 50 casualties on the American side, and several hundred on the German side. However, most of the casualties came from the inhabitants of the area, with an estimated loss of 2,500 civilians. There were around 3,000 casualties in total during the fighting, but the victory at Fontenay allowed the American troops to lead a successful counteroffensive, and eventually led to the liberation of Vexin on 30 August 1944.

A monument in honor of the liberation is depicted on three plaques. In the photo at right, the leftmost plaque lists the names of the American soldiers lost, the middle one contains the commemoration messages, and the rightmostn plaque commemorates the civilians lost. The memorial was inaugurated on September 5, 2021.

==Geography==
Today, the county&#x27;s territory is shared by parts of five departments of France: Val-d&#x27;Oise and Yvelines in the Île-de-France region; Oise in the Hauts-de-France region; and Eure and Seine-Maritime in the Normandy region. The major towns are Pontoise, Vernon, Meulan-en-Yvelines, Gisors, and Les Andelys. The plateau is primarily an agricultural region with some manufacturing located in the valleys.

The French Impressionist artist Claude Monet made his home at Giverny, and the Dutch Post-Impressionist Vincent van Gogh painted the wheat fields of Vexin.

A regional nature park was established in the area in 1995.

==In popular culture==
Ownership of Vexin, and the court intrigue related to securing it, is a key plot point in James Goldman&#x27;s play &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot; (1966). It also features in the Angevin novels of Sharon Kay Penman, and in the BBC series &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Crown&quot; (1978), which stars Brian Cox.

<text>Karl Ferdinand von Gräfe, (8 March 1787 – 4 July 1840) was a German surgeon from Warsaw.

He was the father of ophthalmologist Albrecht von Graefe (1828–1870) and grandfather of politician Albrecht von Graefe (1868-1933).

==Biography==
Gräfe studied medicine at Halle and Leipzig, and after obtaining his licence from Leipzig, he was in 1807 appointed a private physician to Duke Alexius of Anhalt-Bernburg. In 1811, he became a professor of surgery and director of the ophthalmological institute at the University of Berlin. His lectures at the University of Berlin attracted students from all parts of Europe. During the Sixth Coalition against Napoleon, he was a superintendent of military hospitals.

When peace was concluded in 1815, Gräfe resumed his professorial duties. He was also appointed physician to the general staff of the Prussian army, and he became a director of the Friedrich Wilhelm Institute and of the Medico-Chirurgical Academy (Charité).
Gräfe died suddenly at Hanover, where he had been called to operate on the eyes of the crown prince. His grave is preserved in the Protestant &quot;Friedhof II der Jerusalems- und Neuen Kirchengemeinde&quot; (Cemetery No. II of the congregations of Jerusalem&#x27;s Church and New Church) in Berlin-Kreuzberg, south of Hallesches Tor.

He was a pioneer of plastic and reconstructive surgery, and a founder of German rhinoplastic surgery. He developed his own techniques in regards to rhinoplasty, being modifications of the Italian methods of Gasparo Tagliacozzi (1545–1599) as well as Indian surgical practices from long ago. He also made contributions towards the development of cleft palate repair, and was a pioneer of eyelid surgery, coining the term &quot;blepharoplasty&quot; in 1818. He is also reputed to have carried out the first reported clitoridectomy in the Western Europe, which was done on a teenage girl regarded as an &quot;imbecile&quot; who was masturbating.
==Works==
The following are his principal works:
* &quot;Normen für die Ablösung größerer Gliedmaßen&quot; (Berlin, 1812) – Standards for the removal of larger limbs.
* &quot;Rhinoplastik&quot; (1818) – Rhinoplasty.
* &quot;Neue Beiträge zur Kunst, Teile des Angesichts organisch zu ersetzen&quot; (1821).
* &quot;Die epidemisch-kontagiose Augenblennorrhoe Ägyptens in den europäischen Befreiungsheeren&quot; (1824) – The epidemic involving ophthalmic blennorrhea in Egypt affecting the European liberation armies.
* &quot;Jahresberichte ber das klinisch-chirurgisch-augenarztliche Institut der Universität zu Berlin&quot; (1817-1834) – Annual reports on the clinical-surgical-ophthalmology institute at the University of Berlin.
With Philipp Franz von Walther, he edited the &quot;Journal für Chirurgie und Augenheilkunde&quot;.

<doc id="1302953" wikidata="Q3475808" url="?curid=1302953" title="Scientific Data Systems">
<text>Scientific Data Systems (SDS), was an American computer company founded in September 1961 by Max Palevsky, Arthur Rock and Robert Beck, veterans of Packard Bell Corporation and Bendix, along with eleven other computer scientists. SDS was the first to employ silicon transistors, and was an early adopter of integrated circuits in computer design. The company concentrated on larger scientific workload focused machines and sold many machines to NASA during the Space Race. Most machines were both fast and relatively low-priced. The company was sold to Xerox in 1969, but dwindling sales due to the oil crisis of 1973–74 caused Xerox to close the division in 1975 at a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars. During the Xerox years the company was officially Xerox Data Systems (XDS), whose machines were the Xerox 500 series.

==History==
===Early machines===
Throughout the majority of the 1960s the US computer market was dominated by &quot;Snow White&quot;, IBM, and the &quot;Seven Dwarves&quot;, Burroughs, 
UNIVAC, NCR, Control Data Corporation, Honeywell, General Electric, and RCA. SDS entered this well-developed market and was able to introduce a time-sharing computer at just the right time. Much of their success was due to the use of silicon-based transistors in their earliest designs, the 24-bit SDS 910 and SDS 920 which included a hardware (integer) multiplier. These are arguably the first commercial systems based on silicon, rather than germanium, which offered much better reliability for no real additional cost.

Additionally, the SDS machines shipped with a selection of software, notably a FORTRAN compiler, developed by Digitek, that made use of the systems&#x27; Programmed OPeratorS (POPS), and could compile, in 4K 24-bit words, programs in a single pass without the need for magnetic tape secondary storage. For scientific users writing small programs, this was a real boon and dramatically improved development turnaround time.

The 910 and 920 were joined by the SDS 9300, announced in June 1963. Among other changes, the 9300 included a floating point processor for higher performance. The performance increase was dramatic; the 910/920 needed 16 microseconds to add two 24-bit integers, the 9300 only 1.75, almost 10 times as fast. The 9300 also increased maximum memory from 16 kWords to 32 kWords. Although its instruction format resembled that of the earlier machines, it was not compatible with them.

In December 1963 SDS announced the SDS 930, a major re-build of the 9xx line using integrated circuits (ICs) in the central processor. It was comparable to the 9300 in basic operations, but was generally slower overall due to the lack of the 9300&#x27;s memory interlace capability and hardware floating point unit (although a hardware floating point &quot;correlation and filtering unit&quot; was available as an expensive option). The 930 cost less than half that of the original 9300, at about $105,000 (). Cut-down versions of the 920 also followed, including the 12-bit SDS 92, and the IC-based 925.

Project Genie developed a segmentation and relocation system for time-sharing use on the 930 at the University of California, Berkeley, which was commercialized in the SDS 940. It had additional hardware for relocation and swapping of memory sections, and interruptible instructions. The 940 would go on to be a major part of Tymshare&#x27;s circuit-switched network system growth in the 1960s (pre-ARPAnet and before packet-switching). A 945 was announced in July 1968 as a modified 940 with less I/O and the same compute power, but it is unclear whether this shipped.

===SDS 92===
The SDS 92 is generally accepted as the first commercial computer using monolithic integrated circuits. ICs were used on about 50 circuit cards.

The SDS 92 is a small, high-speed, very low-cost, general purpose computer 12-bit system introduced in 1965. it was not compatible with other SDS lines such as the 900 series or the Sigma series. Features included:
*12- and 24-bit instructions
*12-bit word plus parity bit
*2048-word basic memory (1.75 μsec memory cycle) expandable to 4096, 8192, 16,384 or 32,768 words, all directly addressable 
Peripheral equipment available from SDS standard peripheral line included:
*10 cps (characters per second) Keyboard/printer (teletype) with or without paper tape reader and punch
*300 cps paper tape reader
*60 cps paper tape punch
*MAGPAK Magnetic Tape System

===Sigma series===

In December 1966 SDS shipped the entirely new Sigma series, starting with the 16-bit Sigma 2 and the 32-bit Sigma 7, both using common hardware internally. The success of the IBM System/360 and the rise of the 7-bit ASCII character standard was pushing all vendors to the 8-bit standard from their earlier 6-bit ones. SDS was one of the first companies to offer a machine intended as an alternative to the IBM System/360; although not compatible with the 360, it used similar data formats, the EBCDIC character code, and in other ways, such as its use of multiple registers rather than an accumulator, it was designed to have specifications that were comparable to those of the 360.

Various versions of the Sigma 7 followed, including the cut-down Sigma 5 and re-designed Sigma 6. The Xerox Sigma 9 was a major re-design with instruction lookahead and other advanced features, while the Sigma 8 and Sigma 9 mod 3 were low-end machines offered as a migration path for the Sigma 5. The French company CII, as a licensee of SDS, sold about 60 Sigma 7 machines in Europe, and developed an upgrade with virtual memory and dual-processor capability, the Iris 80. CII also manufactured and sold some 160 Sigma 2 systems.

The Sigma range was very successful in the niche real-time processing field, due to the sophisticated hardware interrupt structure and independent I/O processor. The first node of ARPANET was established by Leonard Kleinrock at UCLA with an SDS Sigma 7 system.

===Xerox models===
Even with these successes, when Xerox bought the company in 1969 they sold only about 1% of the computers in the United States, something Xerox never seemed to improve. When they were purchased, about 1,000 SDS machines of all types were in the market, and by the time the division closed in 1975 this had increased to only about 2,100. By this point, the newer Xerox 550 and 560 models, extensively re-designed Sigmas, were about to come to market and were extensively back-ordered. Most rights were sold to Honeywell in July 1975 who produced Sigmas for a short period, and provided support into the 1980s.

Several manufacturers attempted to enter the Sigma 9 replacement market. The first successful design was the Telefile T-85, but it is not clear how many were sold. Other efforts, including the Modutest Mod 9, Ilene Model 9000 and Real-time RCE-9 were designed, but it is not clear if they were ever produced past the prototype stage.

==A new start==
Former SDS employees restarted the company with funding from Max Palevsky, Sanford Kaplan, Dan McGurk, and others in 1979. Jack Mitchell, William L. Scheding, and Henry Harold, along with some other former SDS engineers introduced a microprocessor-based computer called the SDS-420 built on a 6502A-based processor design with up to 56 KB of memory and a proprietary OS, SDS-DOS, along with the BASIC programming language from Microsoft. The SDS-420 featured a dual single-sided-double-density (400 KB per side) floppy disk drive, Model 70, manufactured by PerSci (Peripheral Sciences), of Santa Monica and Marina del Rey, California. The SDS-422 Model offered some of the first dual double-sided-double-density floppy drives. Other hardware options were a 6551-A USART and a proprietary network SDS-NET using a Z8530 SDLC/HDLC chip and software patterned after the early Xerox 3.0 Mbit/s Ethernet and transceivers produced by Tat Lam of the Bay Area.

The company sold about 1,000 machines worldwide, including Tahiti, London, Italy, New York City and Los Angeles. The 400 Series had little to do with scientific computing and more with word processing and business services.

SDS announced a fully operational local area network (LAN)-based file server called SDS-NET at COMDEX in the early 1980s. SDS-NET was based on a Model 430 and written by Sam Keys, of Westchester, California. The SDS 430 Server offered file and printer sharing services over SDS-NET or using a modem and was based upon a 10 MB hard disk manufactured by Micropolis of Chatsworth, California. SDS Offered other models, including the SDS-410, a diskless workstation that booted and ran off the SDS-NET or optionally could boot off-of and run over a 1200 bit/s modem link.

Products offered were: Word (word processing, written by John McCully, formerly of Jacquard Systems, Manhattan Beach, California), and fully functional accounting software: balance-forward and open-item accounting with General Ledger, Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable, and Payroll (written by Tom Davies and Sandra Mass, both formerly with Jacquard Systems).

Other offerings included: Legal Time and Billing, Medical Time and Billing, and &quot;TTY&quot; an early terminal emulation program using the 6551 USART. Through partnerships with their value-added resellers (VARs) other software product offerings included a solid-waste management system with automated truck routing and a country-club accounting package. One UK-based VAR was Jacq-Rite, a vertical market software house run by Ken Groome and Vivienne Gurney and based in Dorking, Surrey. Jacq-Rite had developed a range of specialist insurance software for the Jacquard machine but transferred to the SDS 400 following the advice of John McCully. Jacq-Rite installed several SDS 400 series networks in Lloyd&#x27;s Managing and Members Agencies during 1982 and 1983. One of Jacq-Rite&#x27;s programming staff that worked on the software porting was Justin Hill. Jacq-Rite&#x27;s hardware sales were managed by David Ensor.

==SDS in the United Kingdom==
In 1983 Ensor and Hill left Jacq-Rite and formed a company calling itself &#x27;Scientific Data Systems UK Limited&#x27; or &#x27;SDS UK&#x27; (but actually unrelated to SDS) in Crawley, West Sussex in the UK. This coincided with SDS&#x27;s announcement of their 4000 series computer; they hoped to build a business around this machine (including supplying it to Jacq-Rite) and negotiated an exclusive arrangement with SDS.

The SDS 4000 was a complete re-design, both cosmetically and with all-new internal hardware, but the architecture was basically the same as the 400 series - and ran the same software. The machine had a 1/2 height -inch hard disk drive bay and used Seagate 10 and 20 MB hard drives or SyQuest removable drive units. The 4000 motherboard had a SCSI interface (still known as SASI at the time) and an Adaptec 4000 SASI controller board was shoe-horned into the case to connect the drives. The diskette drive was also half-height -inch (the 400 series had used 8 inch diskettes). Like the 410, there was a diskless version too. Local Area Networking capabilities were carried over from the 400 series.

The 4000&#x27;s major aesthetic departure from its predecessor was the use of a separate 12-inch tilt-and-swivel Visual Display Unit (VDU) and CPU case. The keyboard was detachable for the first time and the system had a beige colour scheme (dictated by the colour of the third party VDUs) in place of the black and white appearance of the 400.

However, financial problems at SDS were already substantial, and the UK business only ever received a small number of hastily completed machines. In an attempt to bypass these problems Hill produced a clone of the 4000 series computer by reverse-engineering an original model with the aid of a set of paper schematics obtained on a visit to SDS. This was neither approved nor supported by SDS, but Mitchell alone [and not Scheding] made a confidential visit to the UK to help debug the new computer. This was fortunate because, being unable to confer with SDS, Hill had unwittingly used schematics referring to a forthcoming revision of the machine, for which no firmware had yet been completed. Mitchell alone [and not Scheding] finished the new firmware at SDS UK&#x27;s offices. This meant that Hill&#x27;s &#x27;unofficial 4000&#x27; was actually a later revision than any US machines completed. Hill also improved the board layout, rear-panel connectivity and power supply.

The new machine worked, and a number of examples were made using a prototyping firm in Poole, Dorset. Several were even sold, including a 5-station network with external storage (see below) to the UK Institute of Legal Executives (&#x27;ILEX&#x27;) in Bedford which remained in use for several years. This was supplied with bespoke software (also produced by Hill, with the assistance of Paula Flint) to store examination results and print certificates. However, any hope of selling into the lucrative Lloyd&#x27;s insurance market in conjunction with Jacq-Rite was short-lived as Jacq-Rite had abandoned SDS and moved to the IBM PC platform, taking their customers with them, as soon as SDS UK was formed. (This decision was also influenced by John McCully, who was now developing his word-processing software for MS-DOS.)

The &#x27;unofficial&#x27; 4000 series machine was at least a finished computer, and the small number produced worked reliably. Taking advantage of the SCSI implementation, Hill added an external connector to his version of the machine and developed a matching hard drive enclosure. This enclosure accommodated higher capacity, full-height -inch drives.

However, the UK company&#x27;s lack of capital to invest in the machine&#x27;s manufacture meant that the cosmetic appearance of the computer left a lot to be desired. Furthermore, the machines were extremely costly – IBM&#x27;s new Personal Computer/AT was shipping at about half the price SDS UK Limited needed to sell their computer for. Relationships between SDS and its UK namesake had broken down completely by this time, and SDS UK did not have the resources to develop new versions of the hardware or operating system.

SDS went out of business in the US 1984. The UK company of the same name ceased trading in the same year.

==Computer models==
==Known users==
Although initially intended as a Scientific Computer System, the 900 series and the Sigma series were used extensively in commercial time-sharing systems. The biggest such user was Comshare Inc. of Ann Arbor, Michigan, who extensively developed the hardware during the 1980s and the Sigma 9 was operated commercially until c. 1993. Developments and improvements by Comshare included the I-Channel, which allowed the utilization of Bus/Tag (IBM compatible) devices and the ISI Communications interface. These innovations allowed Comshare to capitalize on the Sigma CPU&#x27;s and their software development (Commander II) by gaining access to current technology storage systems. When Xerox withdrew from the mainframe computer manufacturing business and relinquished all assets to Honeywell Corporation, Comshare opened a Research and Development facility in Phoenix Arizona, where they manufactured three Sigma 9 systems from spare and remanufactured parts acquired from Modutest, Inc. of Westlake Village, California and Modutest Systems, Inc., Phoenix, Arizona. Recognition Equipment Inc. of Dallas, Texas used 910s in the 1960s to control its optical character recognition machines.

==SDS software==
The primary operating system for the 900 series was called Monarch. For the Sigma 32-bit range RBM, a real-time and batch monitor, and BTM, a batch and timesharing monitor were available. In 1971 a more sophisticated timesharing system UTS was released, which was developed into CP-V. The RBM operating system was replaced by CP-R, a real-time and timesharing system. In March 1982 Honeywell gave the remaining software for the 900 series to a group in Kansas City that offered to continue making copies for people still using the systems. Honeywell had stopped supporting the systems many years before this. In September 2006, this collection was donated to the Computer History Museum along with all of the program&#x27;s original documentation, and copies of most of the SDS user&#x27;s manuals. This is one of the largest collections of software to have survived from the 1960s intact. Unfortunately, the timesharing software for the 940 series was not present in the Honeywell LADS Library and does not appear to have survived. Copies of the original system developed at UC Berkeley exist as file system backups. Most of the customers for 940 systems (in particular Tymshare) made extensive modifications to the 940 system software, and no copies of that version of the software are known to have survived.

Multiple simulators for the Sigma series are known to exist, and Sigma series software is being collected by the Computer History Museum. Early versions were not copyrighted (CP-V C00 and earlier), while later versions developed by Honeywell were (CP-V E00 and F00). Some copies of CP-V D00 were released without licensing agreements and subsequently public domain status was claimed by users.

===CE16 and CF16===
The Xerox CE16 and CF16 minicomputers, announced in May 1969, were small 16-bit computers designed primarily for process control applications. Both systems came with a base 4 KW of 16-bit core memory, expandable to 16 KW, and three &quot;interrupt channels.&quot; The CE16 CPU can perform an addition in 16 μsec and a (software) multiplication in 126 μsec. Its price of $12,800 was . The CF16 CPU is rated at 5.33 μsec for addition and 42 μsec for (hardware) multiplication. It cost $14,900, .

<doc id="1302954" wikidata="Q440792" url="?curid=1302954" title="Gipsy Moth IV">
<text>Gipsy Moth IV is a ketch that Sir Francis Chichester commissioned specifically to sail single-handed around the globe, racing against the times set by the clipper ships of the 19th century.
Gipsy Moth IV was the first ever purpose-built ocean racer and has over the years become the most famous of small sailing vessels. Gipsy Moth IV&#x27;s voyage was the inspiration for the Golden Globe Race (GGR) which continues today.

The name, the fourth boat in Chichester&#x27;s series, all named &quot;Gipsy Moth,&quot; originated from the de Havilland Gipsy Moth aircraft in which Chichester completed pioneering work in aerial navigation techniques.

==Background and design==
After being nursed back to health from a suspected lung abscess by his wife, Chichester undertook two single-handed Transatlantic races from Plymouth to New York in 1960 and Plymouth to Newport in 1964 in &quot;Gipsy Moth III&quot;. He won the &#x27;60 race and was runner-up in the &#x27;64 race. During the &#x27;64 race he became inspired to challenge the times set by the tea and wool clipper ships. The tea clippers took an average of 123 days to make their passage to the East Indies, so Chichester set himself the target of making the passage in 100 days. He subsequently wrote his book &quot;Along the Clipper Way&quot;, which charts the voyage taken by 19th century wool clippers returning from Australia.

In 1965 Chichester commissioned Gosport-based ship yard Camper and Nicholsons to build the boat, designed by John Illingworth and Angus Primrose. Launched in March 1966 with yard number 916, &quot;Gypsy Moth IV&quot; is on the waterline and overall, with a hull constructed of cold-moulded Honduras mahogany. The scheduled displacement (to follow Chichester&#x27;s requirements of maximum weight) was 10.4 tons, after trials increased by 1 ton of added ballast to cope with insufficient righting moment. Ketch rigged, she has a sail area of , extendable with a spinnaker to over . The boat incorporated the maximum amount of sail for the minimum amount of rigging, whilst employing tiller based self-steering using design principles established by Blondie Hasler that could enable steerage from the skipper&#x27;s bunk, essential for solo sailing for a voyage of this length.

==1967 voyage==

&quot;Gipsy Moth IV&quot; set out from Plymouth on 27 August 1966 with 64-year-old Sir Francis at the helm. The voyage was not uneventful, and Chichester later recalled three moments where he noted that the trip nearly ended. The first was when part of the frame holding the wind vane self-steering failed, when still from Sydney. Not wanting to put in at Fremantle, Western Australia, Chichester spent three days balancing sails and experimenting with shock-cord lines on the tiller, once again getting the boat to hold a course to enable her to cover a day.

An exhausted Chichester entered Sydney harbour for a stopover 107 days later. He enlisted the help of America&#x27;s Cup designer Warwick Hood, who added a piece to the boat&#x27;s keel to provide &quot;Gipsy Moth IV&quot; with better directional stability to stop her broaching, but the modification did nothing to improve her stability.

One day out on the return trip via Cape Horn, the boat was rolled in a 140-degree capsize. Chichester calculated the angle by measuring the mark on the cabin roof made by a wine bottle. He commented in his diary and in a later interview with &quot;Time&quot; magazine that he knew she would self-right as she was designed to, but was concerned by the incident as this was a light storm and he still had to pass Cape Horn, where the third and most significant event of the voyage would occur:

&quot;The waves were tremendous. They varied each time, but all were like great sloping walls towering behind you. The kind I liked least was like a great bank of gray-green earth 50&#x27; (15 m) high and very steep. Image yourself at the bottom of one. My cockpit was filled five times and once it took more than 15 minutes to drain. My wind-reading machine stopped recording at 60 knots. My self-steering could not cope with the buffeting...I had a feeling of helplessness.&quot;

Just as he thought all hope was lost and he was alone, on exiting the cockpit one day he was followed by the British Antarctic Survey vessel , and later the same day a Piper Apache plane chartered by the BBC and Sunday Times broke through the clouds, searching for Gypsy Moth to take photographs and film footage. On 28 May 1967 having logged in just 274 days (226 days actual sailing time), the voyage claimed the following records:
* Fastest voyage around the world by any small vessel
* Longest non stop passage that had been made by a small sailing vessel ()
* More than twice the distance of the previous longest passage by a singlehander
* Twice broke the record for a singlehander&#x27;s week&#x27;s run by more than 
* Established a record for singlehanded speed by sailing in 8 days

Because of the boat lacking of directional stability (despite fin extension) and righting moment, Chichester commented:

&quot;Now that I have finished, I don&#x27;t know what will become of &quot;Gipsy Moth IV&quot;. I only own the stern while my cousin owns two thirds. My part, I would sell any day. It would be better if about a third were sawn off. The boat was too big for me. &quot;Gipsy Moth IV&quot; has no sentimental value for me at all. She is cantankerous and difficult and needs a crew of three - a man to navigate, an elephant to move the tiller and a 3&#x27;6&quot; (1.1 m) chimpanzee with arms 8&#x27; (2.4 m) long to get about below and work some of the gear.&quot;
==Greenwich==
In July 1968, &quot;Gipsy Moth IV&quot; was put on permanent display at Greenwich in a land-locked purpose-built dry dock next to &quot;the Cutty Sark&quot;. The yacht was open to the public for many years. In September 1977 a ceremony was held to mark her 1 millionth visitor on board.Eventually, due to general deterioration from allowing visitors to walk across her decks, Gipsy Moth was permanently closed to visitors, remaining on display at Greenwich next to the Cutty Sark.
Her “entombment” at Greenwich was referred to in the song &quot;Single Handed Sailor&quot; by the band Dire Straits. Chichester died at the age of 71 on 26 August 1972.

After 37 years (in 2005) she was freed and relaunched.

==Gipsy Moth IV&#x27;s restoration==
By the early 2000s, the condition of &quot;Gipsy Moth IV&quot;, even though she continued to rest in a Greenwich dry dock hoist, had seriously deteriorated. In 2003, Paul Gelder, editor of the London-based sailing magazine &quot;Yachting Monthly&quot;, launched a campaign to restore the yacht and sail her around the world in 2006 on the 40th anniversary of Chichester&#x27;s voyage, and the 100th birthday of the magazine. He enlisted the support of The Blue Water Round the World Rally, a club-style cruising rally that the magazine had been covering since 1995.

In 2004, in a joint proposal with &quot;Yachting Monthly&quot; and &quot;Gipsy Moth IV&quot;″s owners, The Maritime Trust, the yacht was purchased by the United Kingdom Sailing Academy (UKSA) in Cowes, Isle of Wight, for a token sum of £1 and a gin and tonic (Chichester&#x27;s favourite tipple). The UKSA, &quot;Yachting Monthly&quot; and the Maritime Trust were the three major project partners in the campaign to save the yacht.

In November 2004 &quot;Gipsy Moth IV&quot; was lifted out of Greenwich dry dock and taken by road to Camper and Nicholson&#x27;s yard in Gosport, where she had been built and launched in 1966, for restoration. Although C&amp;N did the work at cost price, the structural restoration cost more than £300,000, with money raised by donations from the public. Over 9000 hours were spent during the 28 week project. The additional equipment and services were provided by the British marine industry. As part of the yacht&#x27;s restoration, the original B&amp;G Navigation equipment was replaced with up to date electronics, but the original devices were left on a covering panel to maintain the feel of the 1966 build. On 20 June 2005, &quot;Gipsy Moth IV&quot; was relaunched and put back into &quot;active service&quot; by HRH Princess Anne.

===Second voyage===
&quot;Gipsy Moth IV&quot; set sail from Plymouth Sound on the first leg of the 2005-07 Blue Water Round the World Rally on 25 September 2005. She had a mixture of experienced crew and teams of disadvantaged youth on board, including for part of the voyage:
* Skipper: Richard Bagget
* First mate: Dewi Thomas
* Crew Leader: Paul Gelder (Editor of &quot;Yachting Monthly&quot;)
* Crew: Matthew Pakes (Isle of Wight), Peter Heggie (Plymouth), Elaine Cadwell (Scotland)

The first leg took just over two weeks to reach Gibraltar, the official starting point for the Blue Water Round the World Rally. After crossing the Bay of Biscay to make landfall in Bayona, Spain, where Paul Gelder left to return to the UK, there was a crew change at Vilamoura, Portugal, and Tom Buggy joined the yacht as Crew Leader for the rest of the leg. Yachting Monthly&#x27;s Dick Durham sailed the next leg and crew leader to the Canary Islands, where James Jermain took over as Mate to Richard Baggett for the Atlantic crossing to Antigua. The yacht went through the Panama Canal in February 2006 and headed for the Galapagos islands and the Marquesas.

On April 29, 2006, after a navigational error, &quot;Gipsy Moth&quot; ran aground on a coral reef at Rangiroa, an atoll in the Tuamotus, known as The Dangerous Archipelago in the Pacific Ocean. She was just from her next landfall, Tahiti. The yacht was seriously damaged. After six days, a major salvage operation was undertaken with Smit, the Dutch big ship experts who were called in by the UKSA, with local help from Tahiti and Rangiroa. After a day-and-a-half spent patching up the holes in the hull with sheets of plywood, the yacht was successfully towed off the reef into deep water on a makeshift &#x27;sledge&#x27;. She was towed to Tahiti and put on a cargo ship to be taken to New Zealand. In Auckland, Grant Dalton&#x27;s America&#x27;s Cup team donated help and premises at their HQ in Viaduct Harbour, and the yacht underwent a second restoration. After two weeks or so she was sailing again on 23 June 2006.

Her return leg was via Cairns and Darwin, in Australia; Indonesia, Singapore, Phuket, Sri Lanka, the Red Sea, Suez Canal and the Mediterranean. She docked in Gibraltar for a crew change, with skipper John Jeffrey joined by British teenagers: Grant McCabe (Plymouth), Kerry Prideaux (Lynton, Devon), Glen Austin (Isle of Wight) - the last of 90 disadvantaged young people who had crewed the yacht on her voyage round the world. She was accompanied into Plymouth by a flotilla of small craft, &quot;Gipsy Moth IV&quot; docked at West Hoe Pier on 28 May 2007, as she did exactly 40 years earlier. She was welcomed home by Giles Chichester, son of Sir Francis Chichester.

=== The Gipsy Moth Trust ===

For some time &quot;Gipsy Moth IV&quot; lay in Lymington Marina, stored at the end of a line of yachts for sale in the boat yard. In November 2010, she was sold to new British owners and remained at Cowes on display to the public.

&quot;Gipsy Moth IV&quot; sailed at classic regattas in the summer of 2011, including Suffolk Yacht Harbour Classic Regatta (18–19 June), JP Morgan Asset Management Round the Island Race (25 June), Panerai British Classic Week (16–23 July) and Aberdeen Asset Management Cowes Week (6–13 August). She was one of a number of important vessels which were moored along the route of the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant, to celebrate the diamond jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. Due to her size, she was not part of the flotilla of vessels, and instead was moored with other vessels at St Katharine Docks, in a display known as the Avenue of Sail.

&quot;Gipsy Moth IV&quot; was a regular visitor to Bucklers Hard, especially for winter maintenance, during which times she was viewed by the public on special open days. In May 2017 she attended the Jersey Boat Show to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Chichester&#x27;s circumnavigation.

The yacht was owned and maintained by The Gipsy Moth Trust, a registered charity, until 2021. Her costs were funded by paying passengers and crew, and by donations to the Trust.

In February 2021 she was put up for sale by the Trust when COVID-19 badly affected the continued operation of the Trust.

==Second restoration==
In March 2022, Gipsy Moth IV was purchased by Simon Oberholzer. Oberholzer undertook her second complete restoration, back to her original 1967 state, at the Elephant Boatyard on the River Hamble.
As Gipsy Moth has a full keel and wide turning circle, and in order to manoeuvre her into small spaces in today&#x27;s marinas, a specially designed electric powered water thruster was developed and installed in the bow during the restoration. This allows Gipsy Moth IV to turn easily without compromising her structural integrity or ruining the aesthetics of her classic lines. 
Gipsy Moth IV&#x27;s 2022 outer-restoration was completed just a day before her Royal Review by the Princess Royal at Cowes Week and the Solent Platinum Jubilee Celebration on 6 August 2022. The cumulative cost of the Gipsy Moth IV and restorations now exceeds £2 million.

In addition to the restoration, Oberholzer has collected more than one thousand documents, articles, artifacts and other memorabilia (ranging from minted coins to issued stamps and tea clothes) which relate to Gipsy Moth IV and which secures her status as a sailing legend.

The inside back cover of Series B British passports, issued between 2015 and 2020, have an illustration of Gipsy Moth IV.

The restoration activities surrounding Gipsy Moth IV during 2022–2023 have not been limited to the yacht itself, but have been extended to include the creation and updating of the Gipsy Moth IV logo by Bas van der Heide, who has a long association with various of The Ocean Race yachts (and who designed boats like ABN Amro 1 and 2 – and most recently Jajo in 2023). In addition, a website about Gipsy Moth IV and Sir Francis Chichester was created.

===Channel crossing===

On the day of the Coronation of King Charles III (6th May, 2023) Gipsy Moth IV departed Ramsgate for The Netherlands, making her first voyage away from British waters in 16 years. The last time was during the Blue Water Rally voyage in 2005–2007. Gipsy Moth IV&#x27;s first port of call was Scheveningen, The Netherlands.

At the start of the final leg of the Ocean Race 2023, at the Hague, Gipsy Moth IV provided a full dress salute to the participating boats and the following day, the same to the Admiral of the Dutch navy at the Scheveningen harbour&#x27;s festival, which has been held annually since 1947.

<text>Vladimir (born September 15, 1987), known as Vova, and Olga Galchenko (born July 31, 1990) were a brother and sister juggling team originally from Russia, active from approximately 2001 to 2009. They specialized in club juggling, particularly technical solo juggling, technical club passing and numbers club passing.

==Biography==
Vladimir Vasilievich Galchenko, known as Vova, and his sister Olga Vasilievna Galchenko are originally from Penza, Russia, and both started juggling at a very young age. At age seven, Vova joined a circus school. Olga joined the circus school several years later. Vova Galchenko is one of two jugglers that have successfully executed a 7 club 7 up 360.

With the encouragement of their parents, Vova and Olga began performing together. In 2001, their father began filming them performing tricks and posted the videos on a website. They soon began receiving invitations to perform abroad. Vova and Olga soon became widely known in the European juggling community for their high level of technical ability, both on and off stage, especially as they were both very young. Even at the ages of 12 and 15 they were featured performers at many large juggling conventions and festivals in Europe, including the British Juggling Convention 2002, Dresden Juggling Convention 2002 and 2003, the European Youth Circus Festival 2002 and the European Juggling Convention 2003. They also performed at the Israel and Japan juggling conventions.

In 2003 they moved from Russia to the United States, where they settled in Los Angeles and began working with Jason Garfield to improve their technical skills. Also in July 2003 they travelled to the International Jugglers&#x27; Association Summer Festival in Reno, Nevada. Many expected them to win all three stage championship categories (Individual, Junior and Team). However, due to their lack of experience on a competition stage, they failed to take gold in any category, though as a team they won a silver medal, and many awards in other events.

In December 2004 they also took part in the first World Juggling Federation competition in Las Vegas, Nevada. Vova won the Advanced Clubs, Five Club Moves, Three Club 360s and Five Club 360s competitions, and came second in the only other event he entered. Olga won the Junior Clubs and came second in the Women&#x27;s Advanced Clubs. Together they won the Teams Six Club and the Teams Seven Plus.

In 2005, the siblings&#x27; partnership began to splinter, in part because Olga wanted to concentrate on school. Vova began performing on his own.

In the 2006 World Juggling Federation competition in Las Vegas, Nevada, Vova and Olga won the Team Club Passing competition. This was their first performance as a pair in competition for one and a half years. Vova also competed individually and won the Endurance - Clubs, 5 Ball 360s (together with Thomas Dietz), 3 Club 360s, 5 Club 360s, 5 Ball Freestyle, 7 Ball Freestyle, 3 Club Freestyle, 5 Club Freestyle competitions.

==Juggling style and records==
The Galchenko siblings are known within the juggling world as being &quot;obsessive&quot; about perfecting their technical skills. Penn Jillette asserts that &quot;if you&#x27;re talking about club passing, the two of them together are the best in the world. Not just the best in the world. The best there has ever been.&quot; Writing in &quot;Time&quot;, Lev Grossman describes their performance as &quot;beautiful--a kind of kinetic sculpture, a bravura display of human determination bringing order to the chaotic physical world.&quot; According to Jason Fagone in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Vova &quot;is able to blur the transitions between tricks so completely that it often seems as if he’s not doing tricks at all&quot;.

Unlike many other jugglers, however, the siblings do not excel at performing; they do not banter on stage or veer towards comedy. This is, in part, due to Vova&#x27;s almost crippling stage fright. Vova, who has earned the nickname &quot;The Russian Robot&quot; for his refusal to try to engage his audiences, maintains that juggling has nothing to do with artistry: &quot;There’s nothing you can express through juggling. It’s just throwing and catching ...&quot;. Because their interests lie in the technical aspects of the discipline rather than entertainment, they joined the World Juggling Federation, whose mission is to transform juggling into a sport.

Olga and Vova previously held several juggling world records for team club passing. Some of their records included:
*Ten Clubs - 378 passes caught
*Eleven Clubs - 152 passes caught
*Twelve Clubs - 54 passes caught

==Other endeavors==
Vova and Olga Galchenko have recently shifted their focus somewhat away from juggling in pursuit of other ambitions. The siblings studied Computer Engineering and Computer Science at rival universities in Los Angeles: Olga at UCLA, and Vova at USC. Both have had some success in their studies. Most notably, Vova has released a number of iPhone applications, one of which is geared towards jugglers. Since 2012, Vova has been working at Box.

<text>The Sovereign State: The Secret History of International Telephone and Telegraph is a non-fiction book by Anthony Sampson published on July 1, 1973, by Hodder &amp; Stoughton Ltd. The book focuses on the history of ITT Corporation to make a broader point about the weakening of the authority of traditional national governments by the multinational corporations.

In some editions it was sold under the title of The Sovereign State of ITT.

==Plot==
In part, it was a portrait of Harold Geneen, the chief executive of ITT from 1959 until 1977. Geneen was a legendarily hands-on manager, who believed it necessary to penetrate through layers of &quot;false facts&quot; to get to the &quot;unshakable facts&quot; about any of the markets or divisions of his conglomerate. In terms of its broader themes, though, this book was one of a spate of early-70s books that promoted the thesis that multinational corporations were taking over the traditional prerogatives and functions of national governments.

In a review of Sampson&#x27;s book in the &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot;, Sir Frank McFadzean, Vice Chairman of Royal Dutch/Shell, took issue with that thesis. Such corporations are &quot;prisoners of their past investments,&quot; he wrote, because &quot;even the most puny government can nationalize, and the only redress is to seek compensation.&quot;

Although as Sampson&#x27;s book shows ITT has used other means of redress to defend its own business interests from nationalisation, that have not been confined to the courts. These have ranged from supporting the 1930s military takeover by General Franco in Spain, investing in Hitler&#x27;s war machine throughout World War II, and funding a CIA-backed coup led by General Pinochet in Chile 1973.

<text>John Ernest Grabe (10 July 1666 – 3 November 1711), Anglican divine, was born at Königsberg, where his father, Martin Sylvester Grabe, was professor of theology and history.

==Life==

In his theological studies Grabe succeeded in persuading himself of the schismatical character of the Reformation, and accordingly he presented to the Lutheran consistory of Samland in Prussia a memorial in which he compared the position of the evangelical Protestant churches with that of the Novatians and other ancient schismatics. He had resolved to join the Church of Rome when a commission of Lutheran divines pointed out flaws in his written argument and called his attention to the English Church as apparently possessing that apostolic succession and manifesting that fidelity to ancient institutions which he desired.

He came to England, settled in Oxford, and made heavy use of the Bodleian Library. He was ordained in 1700, and became chaplain of Christ Church. His inclination was towards the party of the Nonjurors. The learned labours to which the remainder of his life was devoted were rewarded with an Oxford degree (DD) and a royal pension.

He died on 3 November 1711. He was buried in St Pancras Old Church, London on 9 November 1711. His name is listed on the Burdett Coutts Memorial as one of the important graves lost. In 1726 a monument by Francis Bird was erected to him by Edward Harley, Earl of Oxford, in Westminster Abbey. 

Some account of Grabe&#x27;s life is given in Robert Nelson&#x27;s &quot;Life of George Bull&quot;, and by George Hickes in a discourse prefixed to the pamphlet against William Whiston&#x27;s &quot;Collection of Testimonies against the True Deity of the Son and of the Holy Ghost&quot;. Dr George Smalridge (who also granted him his degree) wrote a biography of Grabe.

==Works==

His works, which show him to have been learned and laborious but somewhat deficient in critical acumen, include a &quot;Spicilegium SS. Patrum et haereticorum&quot; (1698-1699), which was designed to cover the first three centuries of the Christian church, but was not continued beyond the close of the second. A second edition of this work was published in 1714.

He brought out editions of:

* Justin Martyr, &quot;Apologia prima&quot; (1700)
* Irenaeus, &quot;Adversus omnes haereses&quot; (1702)
* Bishop Bull&#x27;s Latin works (1703).
* &quot;Septuaginta interpretum.&quot; tomus 1. Oxford 1707

His edition of the &quot;Septuagint&quot; was based on the &quot;Codex Alexandrinus&quot;; it appeared in four volumes (1707–1720), and was completed by Francis Lee and by George Wigan.

<text>The Slave River is a Canadian river that flows from the confluence of the and Peace River in northeastern Alberta and runs into Great Slave Lake in the Northwest Territories. The river&#x27;s name is thought to derive from the name for the Slavey group of the Dene First Nations, &quot;Deh Gah Gotʼine&quot;, in the Athabaskan languages. The Chipewyan had displaced other native people from this region.

==Rapids and kayaking==

The Slave River and the rapids surrounding Fort Smith are known for whitewater kayaking. The river consists of four sets of named rapids: Pelican, Rapids of the Drowned, Mountain Portage, and Cassette. The rapids range in their difficulty to traverse, ranked from Class I to Class VI according to the International Scale of River Difficulty. Huge volume, massive waves, and the home of the northernmost river pelican colony in North America characterize this river. These islands serve as a sanctuary to the birds and are closed to human traffic from April 15 to September 15. 

Crossing the Slave River has proven to be fatal; the earliest recorded fatalities as a part of Cuthbert Grant&#x27;s expedition of 1786 at the Rapids of the Drowned (a class II-IV rapid set).

==Course==
The Slave River originates in the Peace-Athabasca Delta, at the forks of Peace River and , which drains the Athabasca River and Lake Athabasca. The Slave River flows north into the Northwest Territories and into the Great Slave Lake north of Fort Resolution. From there the water reaches the Arctic Ocean through the Mackenzie River.

The river is long and has a cumulative drainage area of .

==Portage and navigation==
Prior to the extension of railway service to Hay River, Northwest Territories, a river port on Great Slave Lake, cargo shipment on the Slave River was an important transport route. Locally built wooden vessels were navigating the river into the late 19th century. The rapids required a portage of .
Tractors were imported from Germany to assist in the transport of goods around the rapids. Tugs and barges of the Northern Transportation Company&#x27;s &quot;Radium Line&quot; were constructed in the south and disassembled. The parts were then shipped by rail to Waterways, Alberta, shipped by barge to the portage, and portaged to the lower river for reassembly, where they could navigate most of the rest of the extensive Mackenzie River basin.

<doc id="1302983" wikidata="Q7337359" url="?curid=1302983" title="River Dove, Suffolk">
<text>The River Dove is a river in the county of Suffolk. It is a tributary of the River Waveney starting near Bacton going through Eye to the Waveney.

==Course==

The Dove rises as several minor streams in the parish of Bacton at around 63 metres above sea level. It descends to the west of the village and flows north, before turning east to pass through the village of Finningham where it passes under the Stowmarket to Norwich railway. At Thorndon it merges with another stream and its course turns north. The river then skirts the eastern edge of the village of Eye, running alongside the former Eye Priory.

Below Eye, it largely forms the western boundary of the parish of Hoxne in a meandering course to the west of Hoxne village. Here it is joined by Gold Brook, before emptying into the River Waveney at the county boundary with Norfolk.

==Gold Brook==

The stream known as Gold Brook flows around north from the parish of Southolt through Redlingfield to Hoxne before emptying into the River Dove. As it enters Hoxne it is crossed by Goldbrook Bridge on the road to Cross Street. It is here that, according to legend, King Edmund the Martyr hid from the invading Danes. Whilst hiding under the bridge, a newly-wed couple saw his spurs glistening in the light and after capture by the Danes supposedly placed a curse on all bridal couples who should cross the bridge. Even up to the 19th century it is said that wedding parties would avoid the bridge rather than take the risk. According to the same legend, Edmund was then killed on the hill above the bridge.

==History==

The river passes alongside the town of Eye, known for its important medieval castle. The name &quot;Eye&quot; is believed to derive from an old word for &quot;island&quot;, as in medieval times the River Dove, its tributaries and marshland would frequently flood and render it effectively an island. The area around the river still floods frequently.

The river is the subject of a 1909 work by Alfred Munnings entitled &quot;A Suffolk Pastoral, the River Dove with a distant clover field&quot;.

<doc id="1302985" wikidata="Q17144660" url="?curid=1302985" title="Offensive counter air">
<text>Offensive counter-air (OCA) is a military term for the suppression of an enemy&#x27;s military air power, primarily through ground attacks targeting enemy air bases: disabling or destroying parked aircraft, runways, fuel facilities, hangars, air traffic control facilities and other aviation infrastructure. Ground munitions like bombs are typically less expensive than more sophisticated air-to-air munitions, and a single ground munition can destroy or disable multiple aircraft in a very short time whereas aircraft already flying must typically be shot down one at a time. Enemy aircraft already flying also represent an imminent threat as they can usually fire back, and therefore destroying them before they can take off minimizes the risk to friendly aircraft.

Air-to-air operations conducted by fighter aircraft with the objective of clearing an airspace of enemy fighters known as combat air patrols can also be offensive counter-air missions, but they are seen as a comparatively slow and expensive way of achieving the final objective - air superiority. The opposite term is defensive counter air, primarily referring to the protection of territory, men and/or materiel against incursion by enemy aircraft, usually with a combination of ground-based surface-to-air missiles and anti-aircraft artillery but also through defensive combat air patrols.

==History==
Offensive counter-air strikes have been used since World War I. The Teishin Shudan and Giretsu Kuteitai carried out two OCA raids in the Pacific theatre against B29s. In one measure the most successful single OCA mission to date was Operation Focus, the Israeli offensive that opened the Six-Day War of 1967, when the Heyl Ha&#x27;avir destroyed a large portion of the air power of Egypt, Syria, and Jordan, mostly on the ground, totaling roughly 600 airframes destroyed by a force of 200 aircraft. However, in sheer number of planes destroyed, the opening two weeks of Operation Barbarossa saw some 3-4,000 Russian planes destroyed in total. Other successful attacks include US counter-air operations in Korea in 1950 and 1953, French and British attacks during the Suez Crisis and many others. However, there have also been notable failures like Operation Chengiz Khan initiated by Pakistan during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 and Iraqi attacks on Iran.

Although OCA missions are often carried out via air strikes, they are not limited to aerial action. The Teishin Shudan and Giretsu Kuteitai commandos carried out two notable OCA raids during World War II, as did the British Long Range Desert Group. The Vietcong successfully destroyed a number of American aircraft with mortar fire during the Vietnam War, and more recently a Taliban raid in Afghanistan destroyed eight AV-8B Harriers.

The Swedish Air Force developed and used the Bas 60 and Bas 90 air base systems as a defensive measure against offensive counter air operations during the Cold War.

===Weapons used===
During the 1950s, the Cold War strategy of both NATO and the Warsaw Pact called for OCA to be carried out with tactical nuclear weapons, but by the mid-1960s, new policies of &#x27;proportional response&#x27; brought about a return to conventional tactics. Beginning shortly before the Six-Day War, specialized weapons were developed for disrupting runways, such as the BLU-107 Durandal anti-runway bomb. Various such weapons continue to be fielded, notably the Hunting JP233 munition used by RAF Panavia Tornado aircraft during the 1991 Gulf War.

<doc id="1302988" wikidata="Q5011682" url="?curid=1302988" title="CIGM-FM">
<text>CIGM-FM is a Canadian radio station, which broadcasts in Sudbury, Ontario. The station airs a CHR/Top 40 format at 93.5 MHz on the FM dial with the branding &quot;Hot 93.5&quot;. The station is owned and operated by Stingray Group.

==History==
The station first aired at 92.7 FM in 1965, with the call letters CKSO-FM, airing a more extensive schedule of CBC Radio programming than its AM sister station CKSO. It adopted the CIGM calls and a country format in 1978, after CBC Radio was granted a license for its own O&amp;O station, CBCS-FM.

CIGM and CKSO were owned by Cambrian Broadcasting. The GM in the station&#x27;s call sign was chosen by 1978 to honour George Miller, one of the founding investors in the company. Miller died in 1977.

As part of Cambrian&#x27;s sale of CKSO-TV to Mid-Canada Communications in 1979/1980, the company&#x27;s shareholders dissolved Cambrian and reincorporated themselves as a new company, called United Broadcasting, which retained ownership of the radio stations. In 1986, United Broadcasting sold CKSO and CIGM to Telemedia.

On March 16, 1990, the CRTC approved Telemedia Communications Ontario Inc.&#x27;s application to amend the Promise of Performance for CIGM by changing the music format from Group III (Country and Country-Oriented) to Group IV (40% Pop and Rock-Softer; 60% Pop and Rock-Harder). Two months later, on May 18, 1990, CKSO and CIGM swapped frequencies. CIGM moved to CKSO&#x27;s 790 slot on the AM dial, and CKSO took on the new call letters CJRQ and CIGM&#x27;s 92.7 FM frequency. After the 1990 swap, the CKSO call sign no longer existed in the Sudbury area until an unrelated Christian music radio station (as CKSO-FM) began test transmissions in late 2002.

In 2002, Telemedia was purchased by Standard Broadcasting. Shortly afterward, Standard sold CJRQ, CIGM and CJMX to Rogers Radio.

In fall 2005, CIGM and sister station CKAT in North Bay underwent a format change, with country music cut back, although not entirely eliminated, in favour of increased news and sports programming. After the change, both stations used slogans such as &quot;Today&#x27;s Country&quot;, &quot;News Leader&quot; and &quot;Sports Leader&quot;.

===Newcap acquisition===
In July 2008, Rogers announced it would trade CIGM to Newcap Broadcasting in exchange for Halifax AM station CFDR. Both stations were the sole remaining AM stations in their respective markets, and in both cases the original owner already had the maximum permitted number of FM stations in the applicable market, whereas the acquirer only had a single FM station. Both companies applied to move the stations to FM as part of the trade. Newcap applied to convert CIGM to 93.5 MHz with an effective radiated power of 100,000 watts.

The applications were approved on November 24. The purchase made CIGM a sister station to Newcap&#x27;s CHNO-FM.

After longtime CIGM morning man Scott Overton&#x27;s employment with the station was discontinued by Rogers during the ownership transition, he wrote a letter to the &quot;Sudbury Star&quot; and &quot;Northern Life&quot; thanking the station&#x27;s audience for its loyalty and indicating that the station&#x27;s &quot;long history as a country station will apparently end within the next few months.&quot; In early 2009, a number of staff at CIGM were laid off, including the news director. Notably, Newcap had applied for a new CHR/Top 40 station in the round of CRTC license hearings that resulted in the launch of CICS-FM, a competing country music station owned by Larche Communications.

In late July 2009, CIGM&#x27;s website went offline with a message advising listeners to check out the EZ Rock website, the former sister station of CIGM.

===Switch back to FM===

On August 17, 2009, CIGM began broadcasting on 93.5 MHz, stunting with a 10-minute test broadcast with mostly classic rock music (including a clip of &quot;Radio Ga Ga&quot; by Queen), including clips from television theme shows (such as Seinfeld and The Flintstones), random clips of other songs, some nature sounds, and sound effects, as well as advising listeners to tune in on August 20 at 10:00 a.m. — at which time the station switched stunts to a Chinese pop music format branded as &quot;Kung Pao 93.5&quot;, which was actually mostly Chinese classical instrumentals, with a few pop songs in rotation. The same stunt format was also aired by WVHT in Norfolk, Virginia for four days in April 2009. Notably, CIGM&#x27;s website during the stunt was identical to the one that had been used by WVHT during its stunt — with the exception that the name of one of the station&#x27;s fictional personalities was changed to &quot;Felony Doll&quot;, a pun on the name of CJRQ morning host Mellaney Dahl.

At midnight on August 24, AM 790 finished its last country song, &quot;There She Goes&quot; by Sudbury native Gil Grand, followed by an announcement:

Immediately after the announcement, the station aired a steady 394.5 Hz audio tone which lasted until the simulcasting of the new programming heard on 93.5 FM began on the morning of the 24th.

The station officially launched as &quot;Hot 93.5&quot; on August 25 at 12:00 p.m. after a stunt of a clock ticking. The first song on &quot;Hot&quot; was &quot;I Gotta Feeling&quot; by The Black Eyed Peas, which started off 10,000 songs in a row commercial free; this ended on September 21, 2009, when regular programming began. This is the first time Sudbury has had a CHR/Top 40 station since sister CHNO-FM flipped formats to adult hits on January 1, 2006. On September 26, 2009, CIGM began airing syndicated countdown shows such as the &quot;Canadian Top 20 with Jimmy T&quot;, &quot;American Top 40&quot; with Ryan Seacrest, &quot;Canadian Hit 30 Countdown&quot; and &quot;Rick Dees Weekly Top 40&quot;. The station also includes &quot;On Air with Ryan Seacrest&quot; which runs weekdays.

On September 30, 2009, at about 5:00 p.m., the old 50,000 watt AM 790 transmitter was turned off, ending nearly 75 years of AM broadcasting in Sudbury, being the last AM radio station outlet in the city.

The Sudbury Wolves games, which were formerly aired on CIGM, moved to CJTK-FM for the 2009-2010 Ontario Hockey League season.

According to the fall 2011 BBM ratings at &quot;Milkman Unlimited&quot; dated December 1, 2011, CIGM achieved the #1 status in Greater Sudbury among adults 25-54. Since the station signed on in 2009, the station is still branded as &quot;The New Hot 93.5&quot;.

On February 23, 2013, the &quot;Rick Dees Weekly Top 40&quot;, which was carried on both Saturday and Sundays every weekend, was replaced by &quot;Hollywood Hamilton&#x27;s Weekend Top 30&quot;.

<text>The EMC-TA was a model of diesel locomotive produced for the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad by the Electro-Motive Corporation in 1937. The original six &quot;Rock Island Rockets&quot; streamliners were three- or four-car stainless-steel semi-articulated trainsets built by Budd Company, powered by six identical locomotives, #601-606. The locomotives were classified as model TA—the T indicating Twelve hundred hp (890 kW), the A indicating an A unit (cab-equipped lead locomotive). The Rock Island Line was EMC&#x27;s only customer for the TA locomotive model.

The styling of the TAs resembled the A units of the contemporary EA and E1 built in 1937, but the single 1,200 hp Winton 201-A motor provided only two-thirds the power of the E-units&#x27; 1,800 hp twin motor arrangement, the TAs were shorter and lighter, and they rode two-axle rather than three-axle trucks. Future locomotives for high-speed and long-distance passenger service would follow the direction taken by the EA/EB, E1 and E2; EMC&#x27;s FT locomotives introduced in 1939 would adapt the single-engine two-axle truck layout of the TA and the cab/booster format of the E units to freight service. With the introduction of the E-series and the TA units EMC undertook regular production of locomotives of their own design, opening the standardized mass production phase in marketing Diesel power for passenger service.

Like the E-series and F-series locomotives, the TA was constructed as a carbody truss rather than having a separate chassis, a weight-saving innovation of early streamliners adapted to full-sized locomotives. The single Winton 201-A V16 engine was placed centrally, centered on the side door and twin flanking windows. The generator was attached behind it, with a cooling fan and air compressor after that. The rear of the unit was taken up with two steam generators for train heating and reservoirs for the air brakes. The cab sat two crew, engineer on the right and fireman on the left. The sloped nose contained air brake and train control equipment; beneath them sat the batteries, and beneath the cab was the water reservoir for the train heating boilers. Fuel was carried beneath the locomotive between the bogie. The trucks were 2-axle, both axles powered, giving the locomotive a B-B wheel arrangement.

The original paint scheme was maroon, red and silver; the bright red was a band at window height and another lower down, linking up at the nose. The rest of the nose end of the locomotive was maroon, and this color continued back at the base of the locomotive beneath the bright red stripe. The rear body of the locomotive was silver to match the train&#x27;s stainless steel finish. Liberal amounts of stainless steel trim were applied, including &quot;THE ROCKET&quot; behind the cab doors, while &quot;ROCK ISLAND&quot; was painted in maroon against the silver locomotive sides.

As delivered, the TAs had a single headlight, but within a few years the Rock Island added a second, gyrating headlight for additional warning at grade crossings. In the 1950s the railroad added new, larger numberboards and removed the side skirting and the rear diaphragms from most of the locomotives. Other additions included MU receptacles next to the upper headlight and replacing the retractable front couplers with fixed ones.

When the original &quot;Rocket&quot; trainsets were withdrawn from service, the TAs, unlike the power units of many early streamliners, were able to continue in service, as they were fully separate locomotives capable of hauling ordinary railroad cars. They served long second careers hauling local and suburban trains. The TAs were finally retired between 1957 and 1958; all were scrapped.

<text>John Christopher Hartwick (January 6, 1714 – July 17, 1796) was an American Lutheran minister in Colonial America and founder of Hartwick College.

==Background==
Hartwick was a native of the dukedom of Saxe-Gotha in the province of Thuringia in
Germany and studied at the University of Halle. He was educated in the Lutheran Pietism movement. He was ordained a Lutheran Minister in the German Trinity Church of London on November 24, 1745.

Inspired to perform missionary work in the North American Colonies, Hartwick emigrated in 1746 to serve as a missionary to the German settlers in and around Rhinebeck in New York’s Hudson Valley.
He was an eccentric idealist and intolerant of parishioner&#x27;s vices, requiring them to sign a promise that they would &quot;forswear shooting, horse-racing, boozing, and dancing.&quot; He was forcefully removed from his first parish by fellow ministers of the area, and in his preaching career until 1691 moved around the northern colonies, looking to find that matched his pious instructions.

In 1764 Hartwick wrote an article condemning the death penalty for theft as contrary to divine law. 

== New Jerusalem ==
Hartwick felt that allowing common persons to own land and live far from one another was the cause of their immorality. He envisioned a utopian community dedicated to the principles of pious living. Having little money to start, he made a series of land deals that helped to grow wealth and finance his ventures. Purchasing land required payment to the Indians, obtaining license, various land surveys, identifying partnerships and co-petitioners, and paying quit-rent and taxes to the Crown. 

In April 1761, Hartwick obtained a nearly land patent called &#x27;the Hartwick Patent&#x27; in Otsego County, New York located southwest of what would become Cooperstown. This patent was granted by the Colony of New York, and required payment for title to the Mohawk Indians. The attempts toward a permanent settlement on the site was made in waves thereafter, although Hartwick has trouble attracting settlers in the first years of the patent. 

In following years, a 100,000 acre patent of land to the north of the Hartwick Patent was secured, and in 1785 Judge William Cooper came to survey land tracts in a portioned land tract called the Cooper-Craig Patent, neighboring immediately to the north. Hartwick continued to struggle to attract settlers to his patent in 1788 and 1789 attempts, and did not survey his land for the required 11 divisions until 1791 as required by the patent documents. 

Seeking assistance in settlement of his tract, Hartwick thereafter commissioned this neighboring landowner Cooper to lease Hartwick Patent land to suitable Christian settlers for the establishment of this &quot;New Jerusalem.&quot; Cooper essentially ignored Hartwick&#x27;s criteria, and leased the property indiscriminately; most (if not all) of his tenants had little interest in Hartwick&#x27;s utopian vision for the settlement. 

John Christopher Hartwick&#x27;s 8/11 holdings of the Hartwick Patent would form the basis for the community of Hartwick, New York.

John Christopher Hartwick died during 1796 at Clermont Manor, the home of Robert R. Livingston.

==Hartwick Seminary==

Hartwick&#x27;s vision of a seminary was as a place to provide religious instruction to the native indians He believed there should be government-run educational schools to replace the exclusive private schools of the day.

Hartwick had benefited financially from Cooper&#x27;s indiscriminate leasing deals and left instructions in his will for the founding of a public seminary. However he made the task difficult by designating Jesus Christ as his heir. The seminary did not open until 15 years after his death.

Hartwick&#x27;s choice as director of the seminary had been Dr. John Christopher Kunze a leading Lutheran theologian. Prominent political and religious leaders Jeremiah Van Rensselaer and Frederick Muhlenberg convinced Dr. Kunze to direct the seminary and teach theology at his home in New York City. Also benefiting from Hartwick&#x27;s endowments were Rev. Anthony Braun who taught sciences and languages in Albany and Rev. John Frederick Ernst who taught elementary school on the Hartwick land patent.

The school first known as the Hartwick Seminary, eventually became Hartwick College. During the 1920s, the Trustees of Hartwick Seminary voted to close the seminary and use the funds to open a new college in the nearby city of Oneonta, New York.

<text>Slonim (; ; ; ; ; ) is a town in Grodno Region, in western Belarus. It serves as the administrative center of Slonim District. It is located at the junction of the Shchara and Isa rivers, southeast of Grodno. As of 2024, it has a population of 48,907.

==Etymology and historical names==
Slonim has been known by several versions of its name as spoken by speakers of various languages: Сло́нім (Belarusian), Słonim (Polish), Сло́ним (Russian). Slonim was first mentioned by scribes in chronicles in 1252 as &quot;Uslonim&quot; and in 1255 as &quot;Vslonim&quot;. According to one account (which is also considered by some to be an official one), the name of the city originates from the Slavic word &quot;zaslona&quot; (a screen),
implying that the city once functioned as an outpost at the southern border of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Another version, proposed by Jazep Stabroŭski, states that &quot;Slonim&quot; derives from &#x27;Užslenimas&#x27;, which in Lithuanian means &quot;beyond the valley&quot;.

==History==
=== Middle Ages ===
The earliest record is of a wooden fort on the left bank of the Shchara river in the 11th century, although there may have been earlier settlement.

The area was disputed between the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Kievan Rus&#x27; in early history and it changed hands several times. In 1040, the Kievans won control of the area after a battle but lost Slonim to the Lithuanians in 1103. The Ruthenians retook the area early in the 13th century but were expelled by a Tatar invasion in 1241 and the town was pillaged. When, later in the year, the Tatars withdrew, Slonim became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania once again, in personal union with the Kingdom of Poland after the Union of Krewo of 1385.

===Early modern period===
In 1532 King Sigismund I of Poland granted Slonim town rights. In 1558, King Sigismund II Augustus, in a privilege issued in Wilno (now Vilnius), established two two-week fairs.

In 1569, the Polish–Lithuanian union was transformed into a single state and Słonim became an important regional centre within the newly established Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Administratively it was part of the Nowogródek Voivodeship. Thanks to the efforts of nobleman, statesman and Słonim starost Lew Sapieha, King Sigismund III Vasa renewed the town rights of Słonim and granted the city coat of arms, which included the Lis coat of arms of Sapieha. Also thanks to Lew Sapieha, from 1631 to 1685 the city flourished as the seat of the Lithuanian diet.

The wars had damaged Slonim, but in the 18th century, a local landowner, count Ogiński, encouraged the recovery of the area; a canal was dug to connect the Shchara with the Dnieper river, now known as the Oginski Canal. Ogiński also built a greater complex, combining an opera theater, a school of music and a school of ballet, and a printing house.

===Late modern period===

The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was dismantled in a series of three &quot;partitions&quot; in the second half of the 18th century and divided among its neighbours, Prussia, Habsburg Austria and Russian Empire which took the largest portion of the territory. Slonim was in the area annexed by Russia in 1795. Administratively it was part of the Slonim Governorate until 1797, Vilna Governorate until 1801 and Grodno Governorate until World War I. In 1897 it was the fourth largest city of the governorate after the leading cities of Białystok, Grodno and Brześć.

Russian control lasted until 1915, when the German army captured the town. After the First World War, the Slonim area was disputed between the Soviet Union and the newly recreated state of Poland. The town suffered badly in the Polish-Soviet war of 1920. It was ceded by the Bolsheviks to Poland in the 1921 Peace of Riga and became a part of Nowogródek Voivodeship of the Second Polish Republic.

Slonim was one of the many towns in Poland that had a significant Jewish population. The imposing Great Synagogue, built in 1642, survived the destruction and brutal Nazi liquidation of the Słonim Ghetto with 10,000 Jews massacred in 1942 alone. The 10 small synagogues around the Great Synagogue called Stiblach did not survive.

===World War II and the post-war period===

In 1939, the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union resulted in the invasion of Poland by the two powers and its division between them. Slonim was in the area designated by the Pact to fall within the Soviet sphere of influence. The Soviets placed that area within the Byelorussian SSR. Two years later, Germany invaded the Soviets (Operation Barbarossa) and Slonim was captured. The Słonim Jews were herded into the Słonim Ghetto set up at the Na Wyspie neighbourhood across the bridge on the Szczara River. Soon thereafter, 70% of Slonim&#x27;s Jews had been killed by the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot;, including 9,000 on 14 November 1941. The second mass murder of 8,000 Jews took place in 1942. In 1944, on the insistence of Joseph Stalin in Yalta the Soviet Union retained possession of the eastern parts of pre-war Poland including Słonim, as agreed between the Allies. The Polish population was forcibly resettled to new post-war Polish boundaries before the end of 1946.

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Slonim became part of an independent state of Belarus.

In 2019 a Soviet-era statue of Vladimir Lenin in the city center was replaced with a new monument of Lew Sapieha.

===Historic population===
The population of Slonim fluctuated, influenced by local prosperity and wars {1883, 21,110; 1897 15,893}. Jewish settlement in Slonim appears to have started in 1388, following encouragement from the Lithuanian authorities. They were credited with the development of local commerce in the 15th century, nonetheless, they were temporarily expelled by the Duchy in 1503. In the late 19th century, Slonim&#x27;s Jewish population had risen to more than 10,000. The Slonimer Hasidic dynasty came from there. Michael and Ephraim Marks (of Marks &amp; Spencer) were born in Slonim.

The wealthiest family in Slonim before World War II were the Rabinowicz brothers, Vigdor and Yossel. Their parents were Dov-Ber and Rivka Rochel (née Kancepolski). After World War I, they entered the forestry business together with Yaakov Milikowski, and were known as the Rabmils. They escaped the Nazi atrocities by flying to Mandatory Palestine.

==Economy==

Slonim&#x27;s importance derives from the river, which is navigable and joins the Oginski canal, connecting the Niemen with the Dnieper.

Slonim has varied food, consumer, and engineering industries. Corn, tar, and especially timber are exported. There is the Slonim artistic goods factory, a worsted factory and “Textilschik”, a paperboard factory, motor- and car-repair plants, a dry non-fat milk factory and meat processing plant. There are also flax preprocessing, feed mill and woodworking enterprises in the town.

The 11th Guards Mechanized Brigade, withdrawn from Germany in 1992, is stationed in the town.

==Media==
Slonim&#x27;s biggest newspaper is the independent &quot;Gazeta Slonimskaya&quot; (Газета Слонімская). Founded in 1997, it is a weekly newspaper with a circulation over 5,000 copies. It is published every Wednesday, and contains local and regional news, sections on sport, culture and lifestyle, and local advertising. It is currently 40 pages, plus an additional weekly 8-page supplement called Otdushina (Отдушина), focusing on youth, culture and religious affairs. The newspaper is written in both Russian and Belarusian.

An earlier &quot;Gazeta Slonimskaya&quot; was originally published in 1938 and 1939, at that time in Polish.

Another local newspaper is &quot;Slonimski Vesnik&quot;. Being a state owned newspaper, it is run and censored by local authorities. &quot;Slonimski Vesnik&quot; is published three times a week and has a circulation of around 3,000 copies.

==Transport and infrastructure==
Slonim has road-links with Baranovichi, Ivatsevichi, Ruzhany, Volkovysk, and Lida. There are around a dozen bus routes in Slonim and half a dozen of mini-bus routes. Taxi services are widely available. Slonim is on the railway line between Baranavichy and Vaukavysk.

The building was left untouched by the German Luftwaffe during World War II, but it has subsequently deteriorated and is now in urgent need of protection and restoration. British TV personality Natasha Kaplinsky was the subject of one of a series of BBC television programmes, &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;. Kaplinsky visited the synagogue, it having been the place of worship of her great-grandparents. Her cousin sang a lament in Hebrew in the synagogue.

<text>CKLU-FM is a Canadian radio station, which broadcasts at FM 96.7 in Sudbury, Ontario. It is the campus radio station of the city&#x27;s Laurentian University, and airs programming in both English and French, along with special interest programming for other language communities in the area.

==History==

The station launched in 1984 as a closed circuit station, available only in certain locations on campus. In 1986, the station was added to cable FM service in Sudbury, using the unofficial callsign CFLR. The station operated at cable 106.7 FM.

In 1996, the station applied to the CRTC for an FM license. The application was granted, and the station began broadcasting over the airwaves at 96.7 MHz in 1997. The station was not able to retain the CFLR callsign, due to the existence of another CFLR broadcasting in La Romaine, Quebec.

Its studios underwent a significant equipment upgrade in 2008. The station added Internet streaming to its website in September 2008.

Initially located in a portable classroom, the station later moved to studios in Laurentian University&#x27;s Parker Building. In March 2016, it was announced that the CKLU studios would be relocating to the McEwen School of Architecture campus in downtown Sudbury. In September 2016, CKLU 96.7 FM moved to its new location on Elgin Street, inside the McEwen School of Architecture.

==Programming==

In addition to locally produced programming, the station also airs several syndicated public radio programs, including the &quot;Putumayo World Music Hour&quot;, &quot;Deconstructing Dinner&quot;, CIUT-FM&#x27;s environmental news series &quot;The Green Majority&quot;, &quot;Radio Goethe&quot; and &quot;Democracy Now!&quot;.

Local programming has included &quot;Lunch with the Trinnie&quot;, which profiles the city&#x27;s local multicultural communities, &quot;City Spins&quot;, which features interviews and music by local musicians, &quot;All My Friends Radio&quot;, and &quot;Minotaur Hour&quot;, hosted by musician Nathan Lawr. A short-run science series, &quot;Sudbury Knows No Bounds&quot;, aired in 2008 in conjunction with Science North. Some students from the city&#x27;s Cambrian College, which does not have its own radio station, also volunteer for CKLU.

Other shows have included &quot;Above the Waste&quot;, a student based show plays all different types of metal. &quot;Miller Time&quot; is another student based show that has been running for three years (since 2007), on Monday and Thursday mornings at 7 am and showcases a unique political satire, comedy, and opinion from host Jason Miller. &quot;Rhythms of Clublife&quot; is a show which features DJ&#x27;s of House and Trance mixing live over the air, hosted by DJ Phluke Nine on Saturday evenings at 10 PM, giving many listeners and club goers a pumped up attitude while on their way to local venues. &quot;Arts at Nine&quot;, cohosted by John McHenry of the Sudbury Theatre Centre, is a weekly magazine and interview show that profiles local people in the arts community.

The station also produced &quot;The Brent Holland Show&quot;, a nationally syndicated interview series.

Since 2018, CKLU-FM had been broadcasting the Sudbury Wolves hockey play-by-play games.

<doc id="1303024" wikidata="Q7328603" url="?curid=1303024" title="Richard Ravitch">
<text>Richard Ravitch (July 7, 1933 – June 25, 2023) was an American politician and businessman who served as the lieutenant governor of New York from 2009 to 2010. He was appointed to the position in July 2009 by New York Governor David Paterson. A native of New York City, he graduated from Yale Law School and he worked in his family&#x27;s real estate development business, a number of government and government-appointed positions, including with the New York State Urban Development Corporation and Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and in private industry, including tenures as chairman of the Bowery Savings Bank and as the chief owner representative in labor negotiations for Major League Baseball.

==Early life and education==
Ravitch was born July 7, 1933, to a Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York City, the son of Saul (d. 1952) and Sylvia (née Lerner, d. 1974) Ravitch. His father was a co-founder of HRH Construction Corporation, which eventually grew to have offices in New York, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. The firm began building in Manhattan in the late nineteenth century. By 1965, it had constructed more than $1 billion worth of projects, including Columbia University Law School, New York University Hospital and several luxury apartment houses (as exemplified by The San Remo and The Beresford, both on Central Park West). Ravitch was a member of the third generation of the family to run the company.

Ravitch was educated at Oberlin College and Columbia University, earning an undergraduate degree in American history with Phi Beta Kappa honors from the latter institution in 1955. He then received his Juris Doctor from Yale Law School in 1958. He served in the U.S. Army for a short time after his graduation from Yale and 1960 marriage to Diane Silvers.

==Career==
After completing his education and military service obligation, Ravitch worked for the House Government Operations Committee in Washington, D.C., and the New York State Commission on Governmental Operations for the City of New York. He joined his family&#x27;s business, HRH Construction, in 1960. His focus was low- and middle-income housing projects, and some notable developments he was responsible for were Waterside Plaza, Riverbend, and Manhattan Plaza, all in Manhattan. Some of the projects he worked on were built under the Mitchell-Lama Housing Program. He also built the first integrated housing projects in Washington, D.C., with James H. Scheuer.

President Lyndon Johnson appointed Ravitch to the United States Commission on Urban Problems in 1966, and he was elected president of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council (CHPC) in 1968. In 1975 Ravitch was appointed by New York State governor Hugh Carey as chairman of the New York State Urban Development Corporation. Ravitch was responsible for salvaging the finances of the organization, which Carey had found was nearly insolvent. After succeeding at the reorganization, Ravitch brought in another president, while retaining the position of unpaid chairman himself. Ravitch sold HRH Construction, his family&#x27;s business, in 1977.

Carey again chose Ravitch for a major appointment in 1979, as head of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Carey had expressed the desire to keep the annual salary at $15,000, effectively requiring whoever took the job to be &quot;independently wealthy or have a business that did not require his full attention&quot;. Ravitch was approved for the job, and did not accept a salary for his work. He was described as throwing himself &quot;into the job unsparingly&quot;, recapitalizing the system, building the Metro-North Railroad from other existing lines, and improving labor relations. He was the chairman of the M.T.A. during the 11-day 1980 New York City transit strike, receiving death threats; in April 1981, a guard was injured in a shooting outside Ravitch&#x27;s office by an armed intruder. Ravitch was assigned a bodyguard and he began wearing a bulletproof vest at some public events and security was provided for his family. He led the M.T.A. until 1983.

After almost a year of effort, Ravitch became chairman of the Bowery Savings Bank of New York in 1985. The bank had been losing money for several years, and Ravitch formed an investment group that included Laurence Tisch, Lionel Pincus, and Warren Buffett to take over the bank as an alternative to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation liquidating it. After the bank returned to profitability, it was sold to H. F. Ahmanson &amp; Co. in 1987; the investment group doubled its $100 million purchase price, and Ravitch earned $5 million on the deal. While chairman of Bowery, Ravitch was named to the board of governors of the American Stock Exchange.

Ravitch briefly considered a run for mayor of New York City in 1977 that met with a &quot;lukewarm response&quot;; he later made a serious run for the Democratic nomination in 1989. He ran as an &quot;outsider&quot; against incumbent mayor Ed Koch, Manhattan Borough President David Dinkins, and city comptroller Harrison J. Goldin. He was endorsed by one of the city&#x27;s major newspapers, the &quot;Daily News&quot;, just before the primary, but placed third in that primary, which Dinkins won. Ravitch&#x27;s candidacy was described after the primary as being run in the face of &quot;predictable defeat&quot;. Dinkins went on to win the general election against Rudy Giuliani.

Moving back to private industry, Ravitch was hired in November 1991 by the Major League Baseball owners as head of their Player Relations Committee, the chief labor negotiator for the owners, at an annual salary of $750,000. Although some critics claimed he was hired as a &quot;union buster&quot; against the Major League Baseball Players Association, he rejected that characterization. Ed Koch, who had been mayor of New York while Ravitch ran the M.T.A., called that description &quot;foolish&quot; and described Ravitch as a &quot;Renaissance man&quot;. During 1994 negotiations between the owners and the players, a primary negotiating point was the owners&#x27; desire for a salary cap, which the union resisted. The negotiations were not successful in avoiding the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike, which ended the 1994 baseball season and resulted in cancellation of the 1994 World Series. The players&#x27; union held Ravitch partly responsible for causing the strike, which others thought was an unfair accusation. After the strike started, owners began relying less on Ravitch as a negotiator, and he resigned from the position in December 1994. He was replaced by Randy Levine as the owners&#x27; representative in 1995.

In 1995, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani picked Ravitch to become the new chancellor of the city&#x27;s school system, but Ravitch withdrew his name from consideration because he said he believed the school system needed major structural reform.
Ravitch and Susan Molinari were appointed co-chairs of the 22-member Millennial Housing Commission, when it was established by the United States Congress in 2000. The commission was charged with making recommendations to Congress regarding ways to increase affordable housing. In 2003, he and Molinari were awarded the &quot;Housing Person of the Year&quot; award by the National Housing Conference.

In 2004, Ravitch became a partner in Ravitch, Rice &amp; Company, and was the chairman of both the AFL-CIO Housing Investment Trust&#x27;s Board of Trustees, and the AFL-CIO Building Investment Trust&#x27;s advisory board. He was appointed by New York governor David Paterson in 2008 to assist in fixing the finances of the MTA, and was a delegate for Barack Obama in the 2008 election.

===Lieutenant Governor of New York===
Following a scandal in early 2008, New York Governor Eliot Spitzer resigned the governorship effective March 17, 2008, and the lieutenant governor, David Paterson, became the governor of New York. Since there is no provision for filling the office of the lieutenant governor in case of vacancy, it was filled on an acting basis by leaders of the state Senate. During the 2009 New York State Senate leadership crisis, in an attempt to break a legislative stalemate, Paterson appointed Ravitch to the position of Lieutenant Governor of New York. Ravitch was sworn in as Lieutenant Governor at 8:45 pm on July 8, 2009, while eating dinner at Peter Luger Steak House in Brooklyn.

Several months of legal challenges followed the appointment. New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo had previously asserted that the governor of New York did not have the authority to appoint a lieutenant governor. State Senator Pedro Espada, Jr. announced he would sue to prevent the appointment. Supporters claimed Paterson had the right to appoint statewide officials, and opponents agreed with Cuomo&#x27;s interpretation that the right to appoint officials did not include the office of lieutenant governor. There were several rulings on the matter. On July 21, 2009, New York Supreme Court Justice William R. LaMarca issued a preliminary injunction against Ravitch performing any duties of the office. That injunction was stayed by Appellate Division Justice L. Priscilla Hall. On August 20, the Appellate Division, Second Department ruled unanimously that &quot;the Governor’s purported appointment of Mr. Ravitch was unlawful because no provision of the Constitution or of any statute provides for the filling of a vacancy in the office of lieutenant governor other than by election.&quot; On September 22, 2009, New York State&#x27;s highest Court, the New York Court of Appeals, ruled that the governor had the authority to appoint a lieutenant governor in the event of a vacancy.

As Lieutenant Governor, Ravitch opted not to receive a salary.
Ravitch&#x27;s main job as Lieutenant Governor was to attempt to improve the state budgeting process. Working with the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government, he presented a series of recommendations on the subject, but his plan was not accepted by Paterson or the New York State legislature. In looking back on his tenure in office, Ravitch was quoted as saying &quot;The truth of the matter is, I don&#x27;t feel I accomplished anything very substantive.&quot; Ravitch did, however, influence the public discussion of the severe budget problems facing New York and other states. The papers he and Rockefeller Institute scholars produced during his tenure as Lieutenant Governor included analysis of New York&#x27;s budget process, its Medicaid system, the budgetary powers of the Governor, transportation infrastructure, and the structural budgetary imbalance facing the state. Ravitch also worked with Christopher O. Ward to turn around construction at World Trade Center site.

===Later career===
In 2012, Ravitch co-chaired the State Budget Crisis Task Force with Paul Volcker. The Ravitch-Volcker report, which reviewed the fiscal strength of six U.S. states, said more transparent accounting of government liabilities was needed and warned that the capacity of state governments to meet various needs would be increasingly crowded out by the growth in Medicaid spending and retirement promises to state employees unless budget plans were reformed.

Ravitch&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;So Much to Do: A Full Life of Business, Politics, and Confronting Fiscal Crises&quot;, was published in 2014. The publisher&#x27;s summary describes the book as &quot;Making [the] case&quot; that &quot;deceptive budgeting and borrowing practices are crippling our states’ ability to do what only they can do—invest in the physical and human infrastructure the country needs to thrive&quot;. According to &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot;, &quot;Ravitch draws some lessons about our need to understand the true costs of public benefits,&quot; and &quot;underlines the importance of our often messy political process&quot;. Casey Seiler, writing in Albany&#x27;s &quot;Times Union&quot; praised the book&#x27;s &quot; engaging and lucid prose — especially beneficial considering the subject at hand&quot; and Paul Volcker called it &quot;a call for action to a nation consumed by discord&quot;.

==Personal life==
Ravitch married Diane Ravitch (née Silvers) in 1960; they had two sons. They divorced in 1986. He later married Betsy F. Perry in 1994. The marriage ended in divorce. On August 27, 2005, he married Kathleen M. Doyle, the chairman and CEO of Doyle New York, an auction and appraisal company.

Ravitch died at a hospital in Manhattan on June 25, 2023, at age 89.

<doc id="1303028" wikidata="Q121903" url="?curid=1303028" title="Garry Winogrand">
<text>Garry Winogrand (; January 14, 1928 – March 19, 1984) was an American street photographer, who portrayed U.S. life and its social issues in the mid-20th century. Photography curator, historian, and critic John Szarkowski called Winogrand the central photographer of his generation.

He received three Guggenheim Fellowships to work on personal projects, a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts, and published four books during his lifetime. He was one of three photographers featured in the influential &quot;New Documents&quot; exhibition at Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1967 and had solo exhibitions there in 1969, 1977, and 1988. He supported himself by working as a freelance photojournalist and advertising photographer in the 1950s and 1960s, and taught photography in the 1970s. His photographs were featured in photography magazines including &quot;Popular Photography,&quot; &quot;Eros,&quot; &quot;Contemporary Photographer,&quot; and &quot;Photography Annual.&quot;

Critic Sean O&#x27;Hagan wrote in 2014 that in &quot;the 1960s and 70s, he defined street photography as an attitude as well as a style – and it has laboured in his shadow ever since, so definitive are his photographs of New York&quot;; and in 2010 that though he photographed elsewhere, &quot;Winogrand was essentially a New York photographer: frenetic, in-your-face, arty despite himself.&quot; Phil Coomes, writing for BBC News in 2013, said &quot;For those of us interested in street photography there are a few names that stand out and one of those is Garry Winogrand, whose pictures of New York in the 1960s are a photographic lesson in every frame.&quot;

In his lifetime Winogrand published four monographs: &quot;The Animals&quot; (1969), &quot;Women are Beautiful&quot; (1975), &quot;Public Relations&quot; (1977) and &quot;Stock Photographs: The Fort Worth Fat Stock Show and Rodeo&quot; (1980). At the time of his death his late work remained undeveloped, with about 2,500 rolls of undeveloped film, 6,500 rolls of developed but not proofed exposures, and about 3,000 rolls only realized as far as contact sheets being made.

==Early life and education==
Winogrand&#x27;s parents, Abraham and Bertha, emigrated to the U.S. from Budapest and Warsaw. Garry grew up with his sister Stella in a predominantly Jewish working-class area of the Bronx, New York, where his father was a leather worker in the garment industry, and his mother made neckties for piecemeal work.

Winogrand graduated from high school in 1946 and entered the U.S. Army Air Force. He returned to New York in 1947 and studied painting at City College of New York and painting and photography at Columbia University, also in New York, in 1948. He also attended a photojournalism class taught by Alexey Brodovitch at The New School for Social Research in New York in 1951.

==Career==

Winogrand worked as a freelance photojournalist and advertising photographer in the 1950s and 1960s. Between 1952 and 1954 he freelanced with the PIX Publishing agency in Manhattan on an introduction from Ed Feingersh, and from 1954 at Brackman Associates.

Winogrand&#x27;s beach scene of a man playfully lifting a woman above the waves appeared in the 1955 &quot;The Family of Man&quot; exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York which then toured the world to be seen by 9 million visitors. His first solo show was held at Image Gallery in New York in 1959. His first notable exhibition was in &quot;Five Unrelated Photographers&quot; in 1963, also at MoMA in New York, along with Minor White, George Krause, Jerome Liebling, and Ken Heyman.

In the 1960s, he photographed in New York City at the same time as contemporaries Lee Friedlander and Diane Arbus.

In 1964 Winogrand was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation to travel &quot;for photographic studies of American life&quot;.

In 1966 he exhibited at the George Eastman House in Rochester, New York with Friedlander, Duane Michals, Bruce Davidson, and Danny Lyon in an exhibition entitled &quot;Toward a Social Landscape,&quot; curated by Nathan Lyons. In 1967 his work was included in the &quot;influential&quot; &quot;New Documents&quot; show at MoMA in New York with Diane Arbus and Lee Friedlander, curated by John Szarkowski.

His photographs of the Bronx Zoo and the Coney Island Aquarium made up his first book &quot;The Animals&quot; (1969), which observes the connections between humans and animals. He took many of these photos when, as a divorced father, accompanying his young children to the zoo for amusement.

He was awarded his second Guggenheim Fellowship in 1969 to continue exploring &quot;the effect of the media on events&quot;, through the then novel phenomenon of events created specifically for the mass media. Between 1969 and 1976 he photographed at public events, producing 6,500 prints for Papageorge to select for his solo exhibition at MoMA, and book, &quot;Public Relations&quot; (1977).

In 1975, Windogrand&#x27;s high-flying reputation took a self-inflicted hit. At the height of the feminist revolution, he produced &quot;Women Are Beautiful,&quot; a much-panned photo book that explored his fascination with the female form. &quot;Most of Winogrand’s photos are taken of women in either vulgar or at least, questionable positions and seem to be taken unknown to them,&quot; says one critic. &quot;This candid approach adds an element of disconnect between the viewer and the viewed, which creates awkwardness in the images themselves.&quot;

He supported himself in the 1970s by teaching, first in New York. He moved to Chicago in 1971 and taught photography at the Institute of Design, Illinois Institute of Technology between 1971 and 1972. He moved to Texas in 1973 and taught in the Photography Program in the College of Fine Arts at the University of Texas at Austin between 1973 and 1978. He moved to Los Angeles in 1978. 

In 1979 he used his third Guggenheim Fellowship to travel throughout the southern and western United States investigating the social issues of his time.

In his book &quot;Stock Photographs&quot; (1980) he showed &quot;people in relation to each other and to their show animals&quot; at the Fort Worth Fat Stock Show and Rodeo.

Szarkowski, the Director of Photography at New York&#x27;s MoMA, became an editor and reviewer of Winogrand&#x27;s work.

==Personal life==
Winogrand married Adrienne Lubeau in 1952. They had two children, Laurie in 1956 and Ethan in 1958. They separated in 1963 and divorced in 1966.

&quot;Being married to Garry was like being married to a lens,&quot; Lubeau once told photography curator Trudy Wilner Stack. Indeed, &quot;colleagues, students and friends describe an almost obsessive picture-taking machine.&quot;

Around 1967 Winogrand married his second wife, Judy Teller. They were together until 1969.

In 1972 he married Eileen Adele Hale, with whom he had a daughter, Melissa. They remained married until his death in 1984. 

==Death and legacy==
Winogrand was diagnosed with gallbladder cancer on February 1, 1984, and went immediately to the Gerson Clinic in Tijuana, Mexico, to seek an alternative cure (6,000 per week in 2016). He died on March 19, at age 56. He was interred at Mount Moriah Cemetery in Fairview, New Jersey.

At the time of his death his late work remained largely unprocessed, with about 2,500 rolls of undeveloped film, 6,500 rolls of developed but not proofed exposures, and about 3,000 rolls only realized as far as contact sheets being made. In total he left nearly 300,000 unedited images. 

The Garry Winogrand Archive at the Center for Creative Photography (CCP) comprises over 20,000 fine and work prints, 20,000 contact sheets, 100,000 negatives and 30,500 35 mm colour slides as well as a small number of Polaroid prints and several amateur and independent motion picture films. Some of his undeveloped work was exhibited posthumously, and published by MoMA in the overview of his work &quot;Winogrand, Figments from the Real World&quot; (2003).

Yet more from his largely unexamined archive of early and late work, plus well known photographs, were included in a retrospective touring exhibition beginning in 2013 and in the accompanying book &quot;Garry Winogrand&quot; (2013). Photographer Leo Rubinfien who curated the 2013 retrospective at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art felt that the purpose of his show was to find out, &quot;...was Szarkowski right about the late work?” Szarkowski felt that Winogrand&#x27;s best work was finished by the early 1970s. Rubinfien thought, after producing the show and in a shift from his previous estimation of 1966 to 1970, that Winogrand was at his best from 1960 to 1964.

All of Winogrand&#x27;s wives and children attended a retrospective exhibit at the San Francisco Art Museum after his death. On display was a 1969 letter from Judith Teller, Winogrand&#x27;s second wife:

Szarkowski called Winogrand the central photographer of his generation. Frank Van Riper of the &quot;Washington Post&quot; described him as &quot;one of the greatest documentary photographers of his era&quot; and added that he was &quot;a bluntspoken, sweet-natured native New Yorker, who had the voice of a Bronx cabbie and the intensity of a pig hunting truffles.&quot; Critic Sean O&#x27;Hagan wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2014 that in &quot;the 1960s and 70s, he defined street photography as an attitude as well as a style – and it has laboured in his shadow ever since, so definitive are his photographs of New York&quot;; and in 2010 in &quot;The Observer&quot; that though he photographed elsewhere, &quot;Winogrand was essentially a New York photographer: frenetic, in-your-face, arty despite himself.&quot; Phil Coomes, writing for BBC News in 2013, said &quot;For those of us interested in street photography there are a few names that stand out and one of those is Garry Winogrand, whose pictures of New York in the 1960s are a photographic lesson in every frame.&quot;

<text>Goose Island is a artificial island in Chicago, Illinois, formed by the North Branch of the Chicago River on the west and the North Branch Canal on the east. It is about long and across at its widest point.

==Early history==
The name may have originally referred to a small natural island at the north side of the confluence of the North and South Branches of the Chicago River that was home to seasonal flocks of birds. In the late 1840s, the surrounding area was on the fringes of Chicago and a group of Irish immigrants started squatting on the unoccupied land around what is now Kinzie Street, between Orleans Street and the river. This settlement may have been known as Kilgubbin, after an area of County Cork that had been home to many of the immigrants. The squatters eventually moved a short distance north to an area on the east side of the river between Chicago Avenue and Division Street, site of the present-day Goose Island. The natural island had been dredged away by 1865.

The land that was to become the present-day Goose Island lies on a bend in the Chicago River between North Avenue on the north and Chicago Avenue on the south. In 1853, William B. Ogden, who had earlier served as Chicago&#x27;s first mayor, formed the Chicago Land Company, which purchased land on the east side of the river to excavate clay for brick-making. Starting from the south, workers excavated a channel northwards, and by 1857 the channel had rejoined the river, forming a shortcut past the bend in the river. The channel was eventually dredged to wide and deep to make it navigable, and it became known as the North Branch Canal, or Ogden&#x27;s Canal. The island thus created was also sometimes nicknamed Ogden&#x27;s Island, a name that some Chicago aldermen proposed to make the official name of the island in 1891. The name Goose Island may refer to the earlier location of the Kilgubbin settlement, or it may have been in reference to the flocks of geese kept by the settlers on the island.

The settlers were eventually joined by Polish and German immigrants to the city. For most of the residents, daily life hovered between rural and urban, with many raising livestock while also working in nearby factories. Over 100 units of housing were built in a three-block area to accommodate the new residents and taverns and bars opened.

==Industrialization==
In the late 19th century, Peoples Gas, Light &amp; Coke Co. purchased land on the east of the island for industrial plants. The area was nicknamed &quot;Little Hell&quot; because of the smoke produced by the plants. By 1887 there were two grain elevators, eleven coal yards, and a railroad. By the turn of the 20th century many residents began to move off the island and some businesses also deserted it.

== Access ==

Goose Island is crossed by Division Street, running east–west, and Halsted Street, which runs north–south across the southeast portion of the island. In 1866 Halsted Street was connected to the island with the construction of a bridge across the river; a bridge across the canal at Halsted Street was added in 1874. The current bridges at these crossing points were constructed in 1955 and 2012 respectively. Division Street was first connected to the island with the construction of a bridge across the river in 1869; a second bridge across the canal was added in 1870. These bridges were replaced with Bascule bridges in 1904 and 1903 respectively. The East Division Street bridge was the second ever Chicago-type Bascule bridge. In 2014 the East bridge was determined to have deteriorated such as to require complete replacement. It was removed and has been replaced with a temporary Bailey bridge.

The Cherry Avenue Bridge provides railroad access to the island at its northern tip. The Chicago and Pacific Railroad constructed railroad onto Goose Island in the 1870s. This company was absorbed into the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway in 1880. Operation of the surviving railroad on Goose Island was taken over by the Soo Line Railroad in 1986, and then by the Chicago Terminal Railroad in January 2007.

===Former bridges===

Two former access points to Goose Island have been removed. In 1891 an experimental bridge was constructed across the canal at Weed Street. This was the first attempt by the city of Chicago to find a bridge design suitable for replacing the city&#x27;s swing bridges. The bridge was a wooden folding lift bridge constructed to a design by William Harman. The design, which became known as a &quot;jackknife&quot; bridge, proved too difficult to maintain and the bridge was closed to traffic in 1899. This bridge was removed in 1905 and replaced with a pontoon swing bridge until it too was removed in 1910. Another short-lived access was created when the original Division Street bridge across the river was moved to Blackhawk Street during replacement works in 1902, this bridge was also removed in 1910.

Ogden Avenue also crossed the island on a viaduct that opened in 1934, though it was not possible to access the island from the viaduct. In 1992 following the closure of the section of Ogden Avenue that ran to the north-east of the island the viaduct was demolished.

==Redevelopment==
Goose Island has been a site of redevelopment of former industrial locations to residential and mixed-use towers and high rises, similar to the River North, Fulton Market and Pilsen neighborhoods of the city. Major land sites and warehouses have been developed or converted into modern manufacturing and creative loft-office space and towers on the island, including the Wrigley Corporation&#x27;s research and development facility at the north end of the island and the former Sara Lee Corporation headquarters at the southern end of the island (since re-purposed as Kendall College). New Goose Island developments include 909 West Bliss Street, an adaptive re-use warehouse renovation and 934 North Branch Street, a 3.5 acre land site adjacent to the Chicago River. Names that have been used to market the redevelopment of Goose Island include Goose Island 2.0, Silicon Island, and Innovation Island. Amazon, Inc. has leased a warehouse on the island to serve as an urban ultra-local distribution hub for &quot;Prime Now&quot; one- and two-hour deliveries to residents around the city.

<text>Allegory and Self: Illustrations in Sound is a studio album released by Psychic TV in 1988.

Several versions have appeared, including the original picture disc (TOPY 035) and black vinyl (TOPY 038) versions in 1988 on Temple Records, Fundamental Records (SPIN 1006) and on pink marbled vinyl (666 copies). It has also appeared on CD in at least two versions, on Spin and Cleopatra (CLEO94912 - with 3 bonus remixed tracks). It has also been reissued in Russia.

The cover graphics feature Austin Osman Spare&#x27;s &quot;General Allegory&quot; and other illustrations from his &quot;Automatic Drawings&quot; and &quot;Book Of Satyrs&quot;. In the original release there was included a book of what seems to be P-Orridge&#x27;s own Book of Satyrs, with very Spare-ish pen-and-ink drawings and illuminations and key lyrics, handwritten.

The track &quot;The Starlit Mire&quot; takes its title from the book of epigrams of the same title (written by two doctors, James Bertram and F. Russell), illustrated by Spare around 1910, in which his illustrations once more displayed his interest in the abnormal and the grotesque.

Track 6, &quot;Caresse Song,&quot; is a recording of Orridge&#x27;s daughter Caresse singing as she toys around with a keyboard.

The line-up for this recording included long-time PTV friend and collaborator Monte Cazazza. According to allmusic.com, all compositions were co-written by Genesis P. Orridge and Alex Fergusson.

== Reception ==

&quot;Trouser Press&quot; described &quot;Godstar&quot; (which is about musician Brian Jones) as &quot;a catchy pop single&quot;.

<text>Gopalkrishna Devadas Gandhi (born 22 April 1945) is a former administrator and diplomat who served as the 22nd Governor of West Bengal serving from 2004 to 2009. He is the grandson of Mahatma Gandhi and C. Rajagopalachari (Rajaji). As a former IAS officer he served as Secretary to the President of India and as High Commissioner to South Africa and Sri Lanka, among other administrative and diplomatic posts. He was the United Progressive Alliance nominee for Vice President of India 2017 elections and lost with 244 votes against NDA candidate Venkaiah Naidu, who got 516 votes.

==Early life and background==

Gopalkrishna Devadas Gandhi was born on 22 April 1945 in Delhi, to Devdas and Lakshmi Gandhi. His father was a journalist. Gandhi graduated with a master&#x27;s degree in English literature from St. Stephen&#x27;s College of Delhi University.

==Career==
He joined IAS as an officer in 1968 and served in Tamil Nadu state till 1985. Thereafter, he remained secretary to the Vice President of India (1985–1987) and joint secretary to the President of India (1987–1992).

In 1992, after retiring voluntarily from the IAS, he became minister (culture) in high commission of India, UK and director of The Nehru Centre, London, UK. This was followed by various diplomatic and administrative positions for the rest of his career, including high commissioner of India to South Africa and Lesotho (1996), secretary to the president of India (1997–2000), high commissioner of India in Sri Lanka (2000), and ambassador of India to Norway, and Iceland (2002).

On 14 December 2004, he was appointed Governor of West Bengal following the expiry of the term of office of incumbent Viren J. Shah. He was succeeded by Devanand Konwar, who was given additional charge of West Bengal. For a few months in 2006 he also took on additional duties as the Governor of Bihar.

He was the chairman of Kalakshetra Foundation, Chennai from December 2011 to May 2014. In 2015, he translated the Tamil classic, the Tirukkural, into English. He was the chairman of governing body of Indian Institute of Advanced Study, and president of its society on 5 March 2012 and served until May 2014.

Gandhi teaches at Ashoka University, where he is a professor of history and politics.

==Controversies==

While delivering the 15th D P Kohli Memorial Lecture for CBI on &quot;Eclipse at Noon: Shadows Over India&#x27;s Conscience&quot; with nearly 3000 officers of the agency in the audience, Gandhi noted that &quot;The CBI is seen as the government&#x27;s hatchet, rather than honesty&#x27;s ally. It is often called DDT — meaning not the dichloro diphenyl trichloroethane, the colourless, tasteless, odourless insecticide it should be, but the department of dirty tricks.&quot;

In 2015, he wrote a letter to the then President of India, Pranab Mukherjee, to reconsider the rejection of the mercy plea of the 1993 Mumbai serial blast convict, Yakub Memon.

==Personal life==
His paternal grandfather was Mahatma Gandhi and maternal grandfather was C. Rajagopalachari (Rajaji). He is the son of Devadas Gandhi and Lakshmi Gandhi. Gopalkrishna Gandhi is the younger brother of Rajmohan Gandhi and Ramchandra Gandhi. He and his wife Tara have two daughters.

<text>Antonio Pucci (c. 1310–1388) was a Florentine bellfounder, town crier, self-taught as a versifier, who wrote his collection, &quot;Libro di varie storie&quot; (&quot;Book of Various Tales&quot;), using a popular dialect for a popular audience. In his &quot;Centiloquio&quot; he set out in ninety-one cantos&#x27; worth of chronicle from Giovanni Villani&#x27;s &quot;Cronaca.&quot; In &quot;Le proprietà di Mercato Vecchio&quot; he praised, again in terzinas, the incomparable street life of Florence&#x27;s crowded market piazza. In poems he could blame or praise women with equal force, a favorite medieval trope. He composed &quot;cantari&quot; in the eight-line stanzas called &quot;ottava rima,&quot; telling the subjects of courtly romance in a fast-paced narrative, with an undertone of subversive populist skepticism that undercut the very conventions that the stories embraced, full of vivid contemporary color and pious sentiment, and perhaps he declaimed them in the public squares: &quot;La Reina d&#x27;Oriente&quot;, &quot;Gismirante&quot;, &quot;Apollonio di Tiro,&quot; &quot;Brito di Brettagna&quot;, &quot;Madonna Lionessa.&quot;

During the second half of the 14th century, Florence remained a centre of culture, but its literature developed a more popular character. The best-known representative of this development was town crier Antonio Pucci, whose vast verse production includes poems on local Florentine lore as well as historical and legendary verse narratives.

About 1373, &quot;New Chronicles&quot; from Giovanni Villani was versified and produced by fellow Florentine Antonio Pucci as a rhymed version in terza rima. The poetic transcription was called &quot;Centiloquio&quot;.

<text>The Réunion national football team () is the regional team of the French overseas department and region of Réunion and is controlled by the Réunionese Football League, local branch of the French Football Federation. Réunion is not a member of FIFA and is only an associate member of CAF, and is therefore not eligible to enter either the World Cup or the Africa Cup of Nations. However, it has played numerous matches, most of them against the island nations of Madagascar, Mauritius, and the Seychelles.

==History==

Réunion&#x27;s first international came in the 1947 Triangulaire, losing twice against Mauritius (2–1) and Madagascar (4–2). Réunion won their first match in the 1950 edition, beating Madagascar 3–2.

In the 1979 Indian Ocean Island Games, Réunion qualified top of their group, beating Seychelles (3–0) and Maldives (9–0). In the semi-finals, they beat Comoros (6–1), leading to a rematch against Seychelles in the final. Réunion won 2–1.

Réunion qualified for the final of the 1985 Indian Ocean Island Games, losing on penalties to Mauritius after a 4–4 draw. Réunion got out of the group stage again at the 1993 Games, beating Mauritius in the semi-finals 1–0 with Jimmy Moultanin scoring their only goal. They lost 1–0 to Madagascar in the final. They got their revenge against Madagascar in the 1998 final, drawing 3–3 in regular time before winning 7–6 on penalties.

Réunion made it to the final of the 2003 Indian Ocean Island Games losing to the hosts Mauritius 2–1. In the 2007 Games, Réunion won the competition despite scoring only two goals.

Réunion entered the inaugural 2008 Coupe de l&#x27;Outre-Mer, winning their group against Mayotte (6–1) and French Guiana (2–0), qualifying for the final, where they beat Martinique (1–0). They entered the 2010 Coupe de l&#x27;Outre-Mer, facing Martinique again in the final, losing on penalties.

Réunion advanced to the knock-out stages of the 2011 Indian Ocean Island Games, losing to Seychelles (2–1) in extra-time. They beat Mayotte 1–0 to claim third place. In the 2012 Coupe de l&#x27;Outre-Mer Réunion qualified for the final match, beating French Guiana (2–0), Saint Pierre and Miquelon (10–0) and Guadeloupe (2–1) before meeting Martinique for the third consequtive final, defeating them 10–9 on penalties. In the 2015 Games Réunion beat Mayotte 3–1 in the final and in the 2019 competition they beat Mauritius on penalties, with Mathieu Pélops saving all five attempts in the penalty shoot-out.

<text>The Babruyka ( ) is a small river in Belarus, a tributary to the Berezina (Biarezina). It flows through the eponymous city of Babruysk and is named after the beavers which used to inhabit it. Due to industrial pollution, there are no more animals inhabiting the river and its flow has been reduced to a fraction of its former self.

<doc id="1303059" wikidata="Q2633296" url="?curid=1303059" title="Popscene">
<text>&quot;Popscene&quot; is a song by English alternative rock band Blur, released as a non-album single on 30 March 1992. Despite its relatively low chart placing, it has since become critically praised and regarded as one of the pioneering songs of the Britpop genre.

==Recording==
The song was first played live in late 1991, and recorded at Matrix Studios in Holborn with producer Steve Lovell. The lyrics showed frontman Damon Albarn&#x27;s distaste for the music business, complaining that there were too many insignificant indie bands.

Musically, it was different to the style seen on the group&#x27;s first album &quot;Leisure&quot; and featured heavily flanged guitars, a Can influenced drumbeat, and brass from session players the Kick Horns. The band considered &quot;Popscene&quot; to be the loudest and best thing they had worked on at that point.

==Reception==
The single reached No. 32 on the UK Singles Chart, and was panned by both &quot;Melody Maker&quot; and &quot;NME&quot;. The Beastie Boys, guest reviewing for NME, suggested the record would sound better played at 33rpm instead of 45. The low chart placing came as a confidence blow for the band, who were £60,000 in debt. Food Records boss Andy Ross later said &quot;we were totally devastated ... we thought it was a brilliant single.&quot; The band have since said that the popularity of American grunge music contributed to the single&#x27;s failure, as they felt the song had a very British feel. Guitarist Graham Coxon said &quot;It was Nirvana that really fucked &quot;Popscene&quot; up.&quot;

Sylvia Patterson from &quot;Smash Hits&quot; rated the song two out of five. She wrote: &quot;[The song] starts off like the Inspiral Carpets in a car crash and ends up exactly like Mancunian punk-poppers from yesteryear The Buzzcocks. A bizarre commotion from hell. Not very good either.&quot;

The experience of recording &quot;Popscene&quot; led the band to believe they should simply play music in their own style and not worry about trends. The &quot;Britishness&quot; of &quot;Popscene&quot; carried over to the group&#x27;s second album, &quot;Modern Life Is Rubbish&quot;. The song was not released on the British version of the album, though it was added as an extra track in the United States and Japan. In Australia, &quot;Popscene&quot; was not released until 1998, when it was issued as a double A-side with &quot;On Your Own&quot;; it reached No. 69 on the ARIA Singles Chart.

The song has since become a fan favourite and is still performed live. Retrospective critical reaction to &quot;Popscene&quot; has been positive. Jonathan Holden, writing in the &quot;Rough Guide To Rock&quot;, declared the single to be &quot;excellent&quot; and that its &quot;punky, energetic and brass-fulfilled pop&quot; was out of place in 1992. John Harris considers the track as one of the first ever Britpop songs, and a starting point for the movement. The song had never been included on a UK Blur album, until 2009 when it was released on the compilation &quot;&quot;.

<text>The Radio Society of Great Britain (RSGB) is the United Kingdom&#x27;s recognised national society for amateur radio operators. The society was founded in 1913 as the London Wireless Club, making it one of the oldest organisations of its kind in the world. Through its work, it represents the interests of the UK&#x27;s 80,000 licensed radio amateurs in the United Kingdom and certain dependent territories of the United Kingdom at the International Amateur Radio Union, acting as a medium for communication between the licensed operators and the UK government.

== Role ==
The RSGB has traditionally acted as the organisation through which its members interact with the telecommunications regulatory authority of the United Kingdom, Ofcom. Although Ofcom has used its web site to solicit opinions directly from all amateur radio enthusiasts and other interested parties, the RSGB continues to advise and to seek to influence Ofcom on the likely impact of proposed changes in many areas – from decisions on spectrum and licensing, through to interference arising from intruders or from spurious emissions from electronic equipment such as Solar Panels, VDSL or PLT. Its advice on EMC issues is one of many services to its members and the wider amateur community.
RSGB also acts as a parent organisation to many smaller groups and societies which affiliate to it. Some of these societies form in towns or unite local areas (such as repeater groups). Other specialist groups can include contesters, a particular operating category, or even people interested in a particular amateur radio band (such as 6-meter band groups).

The society publishes a monthly magazine called &quot;RadCom&quot;, along with a range of technical books.

== History ==
The roots of the Radio Society of Great Britain can traced back to the formation of the London Wireless Club, inaugurated in West Hampstead on 5 July 1913. The first President was Alan Archibald Campbell-Swinton who was succeeded in 1920 by James Robert Erskine-Murray.

At its first meeting in September 1913, it was decided that the name should change from the London Wireless Club to the Wireless Society of London. In November 1922, the name of the Society was changed to that it holds to this day, the substitution of the term &#x27;Great Britain&#x27; for &#x27;London&#x27; being made with the view to extend the perceived scope of the Society&#x27;s work.

The RSGB made the first radio transmission across to the United States, but failed to have any receiving equipment. Many members were slightly annoyed by this fact and so formed other sections of the RSGB which were later absorbed into the RSGB itself.

During World War II, the entire RSGB Council and many of its members were recruited into MI8, also known as the Radio Security Service. Its mission was to intercept clandestine enemy transmissions.

In 2006, the RSGB cooperated with Ofcom to revise the amateur radio licence in the United Kingdom; following the formal consultation process, from 8 February 2007 the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1949 was replaced by the Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006. Changes included removing the annual licence fee and removing the requirement to log all transmissions. Amateur radio operators gained permission to operate one&#x27;s amateur radio station remotely, and the changes increased the spectrum available to the lower classes of licensees.

===2011 expenses scandal===

On 28 March 2011, the Board announced that the RSGB&#x27;s general manager had left the Society&#x27;s employment after the discovery of financial irregularities, allegedly for the amount of £41,000. RSGB Director, Don Beattie G3BJ, acted as general manager until the appointment of a new general manager, Graham Coomber G0NBI, in May 2012.

The following notice appeared on the RSGB website on 16 October 2013:
&quot;&quot;The Board is pleased to be able to report to Members that the debt owed to the Society by its previous General Manager, who left the Society in early 2011, has been repaid in full, together with statutory interest and the Society’s court fees. This will be reflected in the 2013 accounts as a write-back of the provision taken against the debt in the 2011 accounts. Details will be in the annual report and accounts which will be published in time for the AGM in 2014. The Board expresses its thanks to the Society team which has brought about the recovery of this debt and now regards the matter as closed. No further comment will be made&quot;.&quot;

===RSGB Centenary 2013===
In 2013 the RSGB celebrated its centenary with a programme of events including a special callsign G100RSGB, the RSGB Centenary Award 2013 and a construction competition. The special callsign G100RSGB travelled around the 13 RSGB regions and was operated by groups in each area.

== National Radio Centre ==
The RSGB National Radio Centre at Bletchley Park in Buckinghamshire opened in 2012. It has exhibits and demonstrations of wireless technology, the GB3RS radio station, and the RSGB archives in a newly constructed building close to the main Bletchley Park entrance. The centre has proven increasingly popular with visitor numbers rising from 26,000 in 2017, to over 90,000 in 2019.

== Future ==
There are competing demands from more and more non-amateur uses of radio (for example mobile operators and wireless devices). Despite this, the RSGB has been able to maintain existing amateur radio allocations and negotiate some new ones.

==Outreach to younger amateurs==
With the formation of the Youth Team (Formerly RSGB Youth Committee) the society is catering for the demands of the younger licensees. In 2014, The society took part in the International Amateur Radio Union&#x27;s Youngsters on the Air (YOTA) event in Finland, whilst completing a mini YOTA event in the UK. The RSGB hosted YOTA in the UK in 2017, attracting over 80 young people from all over the world to the UK to take part in radio related events. This event was organised by senior members of the RSGB with support from the youth committee. The Youth Committee was Chaired from its formation in 2014 to 2018 by Mike Jones, M5PMJ, acting as the Youth Coordinator for the UK for the International Amateur Radio Union. The society had remained an active part in the YOTA programme, being represented in 2018 in South Africa and engaging in December YOTA Months.

<text>USS &quot;Ronquil&quot; (SS-396), a , was the only ship of the United States Navy named after the ronquil, a spiny-finned fish found along the northwest coast of North America. It has a single dorsal fin and a large mouth and resembles the tropical jawfish.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Ronquil&quot; was laid down on 9 September 1943 at the Portsmouth Navy Yard, in Kittery, Maine; launched on 27 January 1944, sponsored by Mrs. C. M. Elder; and commissioned on 22 April 1944.

==Service history==
===U.S. Navy service===
==== World War II ====

After shakedown off the New England coast, &quot;Ronquil&quot; sailed for Hawaii. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 8 July 1944; and, after preparatory training, sailed on her first war patrol (31 July – 8 September 1944) in the northeastern Formosa-Sakishima Gunto area. On 24 August the submarine sank two attack cargo ships: &quot;Yoshida Maru No. 3&quot; (4,646 tons) and &quot;Fukurei Maru&quot; (5,969 tons). &quot;Ronquil&quot;’s second war patrol, from 30 September to 28 November 1944, was carried out in two phases. She first operated with a coordinated submarine attack group in the Bungo Suido area, and then joined six other submarines to carry out an antipatrol ship sweep off the Bonin Islands.

On her third war patrol, from 1 January to 14 February 1945, &quot;Ronquil&quot; patrolled the Bonins and did lifeguard duty in that area for Army bombers hitting the Japanese home islands. Her fourth war patrol from 11 March to 23 April 1945, brought her no worthwhile enemy targets but resulted in the rescue of 10 Army aviators from a B-29 bomber downed between the Bonins and Japan. The submarine&#x27;s fifth and last patrol from 19 May to 26 July 1945, took her into the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea.

The end of the war in the Pacific in mid-August 1945 found &quot;Ronquil&quot; off Pearl Harbor, training for another war patrol.

==== Post-World War II service ====
=====1945–1952=====
&quot;Ronquil&quot; returned to San Diego in the fall of 1945 and engaged in training exercises off the California coast. In January 1947, she departed San Diego for her first peacetime western Pacific deployment. This patrol lasted 114 days and took the submarine to Tahiti, the Caroline Islands, the Mariana Islands, Japan, and the Yellow Sea. On her return to San Diego, she resumed local operations before beginning a three-year period of intensive training in offensive and antisubmarine warfare, embodying lessons learned during World War II as well as new postwar developments.

=====1953–1971=====
&quot;Ronquil&quot; entered Mare Island Naval Shipyard in May 1952 for decommissioning and &quot;Guppy IIA&quot; modernization: Her hull and sail were streamlined for greater submerged speed. She received new, increased-capacity batteries for underwater endurance, and a snorkel which enabled her to use her diesels at periscope depth. New electronics, including improved sonar and fire-control systems, were installed.

&quot;Ronquil&quot; was recommissioned on 16 January 1953, and on 12 June departed for Japan. She arrived at Yokosuka before sailing on to Tokyo on 19 July to take part in the &quot;Black Ship Festival&quot; commemorating Commodore Matthew Perry&#x27;s opening of Japan in 1852. Throughout August and September, &quot;Ronquil&quot; participated in antisubmarine and other operations in the waters near Japan; this was to set the pattern for most of her later deployments.

On 11 December 1953 &quot;Ronquil&quot; returned to San Diego for a year of overhaul, refresher training, Naval Reserve training, and fleet exercises. She sailed for a second western Pacific tour on 21 March 1955, returning late in September. The next 2 years were devoted to operations off the west coast of the United States; on 31 July 1957, the submarine again deployed to the Far East for 7 months.

From 3 July to 7 July 1958, &quot;Ronquil&quot; took part, with other ships of the fleet, in an observance of the 50th anniversary of the arrival of the &quot;Great White Fleet&quot; at San Francisco. She resumed normal operations, then sailed from San Diego on 6 April 1959 for a 5-month &quot;WestPac&quot; deployment. During July and August 1960, she participated in extensive antisubmarine exercises in the eastern Pacific with United States and Canadian forces.

In the early fall of 1961 &quot;Ronquil&quot; again sailed for the Far East, returning in March 1962. After taking part in a demonstration of antisubmarine operations for the national radio and television networks, she began a period of overhaul and local operations. The submarine departed San Diego in November 1963 for duty with the United States Seventh Fleet; on her return to California, she again resumed operations off the west coast. Late in 1964 &quot;Ronquil&quot; began preparations for deployment to the Vietnam area. In February 1965 she sailed for Southeast Asia and a five-month deployment.

In mid-1966, &quot;Ronquil&quot; rejoined the Seventh Fleet, returning to San Diego in February 1967 for further work off the coast of California. This was interrupted in August 1967, when &quot;Ronquil&quot; played the part of the fictional USS &quot;Tigerfish&quot; (SSN-509) in the motion picture &quot;Ice Station Zebra&quot;.

On 26 December 1967, &quot;Ronquil&quot; was again underway for Japan. During this deployment, she took part in exercises with U.S., Royal Navy, Canadian Forces, Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, and Royal Australian Navy forces. On 2 July 1968 &quot;Ronquil&quot; returned to the United States West Coast. &quot;Ronquil&quot; departed for the East Asia on 4 July 1969, returning to San Diego on 24 December 1969.

At the end of January 1970 &quot;Ronquil&quot; began a period of repair and overhaul, followed by training and fleet exercises in the eastern Pacific. August 1970 brought another Seventh Fleet deployment. She returning to San Diego on 5 March 1971. The Vietnam Service Medal was awarded for this deployment.

On 1 July 1971, &quot;Ronquil&quot; was decommissioned, struck from the Naval Register,

====Honors and awards====
&quot;Ronquil&quot; earned six battle stars for World War II service.

* Vietnam Service Medal

=== Spanish service ===
On the day of her commissioning, &quot;Ronquil&quot; was transferred to Spain under the Mutual Security Assistance Act. She was commissioned into the Spanish Navy as &quot;Isaac Peral&quot; (S-32), named after Spanish submarine pioneer Isaac Peral. Under her new commander, Lieutenant Commander Pedro Soler Yolif, she sailed from San Diego to her new home port of Cartagena, Spain, where she arrived on 22 August 1971.

&quot;Isaac Peral&quot; faced retirement in 1982, but her service was extended until the commissioning of the new submarine . The Spanish Navy finally decommissioned &quot;Isaac Peral&quot; on 3 April 1984.

<doc id="1303091" wikidata="Q465316" url="?curid=1303091" title="Order of Victory">
<text>The Order of Victory () was the highest military decoration awarded for World War II service in the Soviet Union, and one of the rarest orders in the world. The order was awarded only to Generals and Marshals for successfully conducting combat operations involving one or more army groups and resulting in a &quot;successful operation within the framework of one or several fronts resulting in a radical change of the situation in favor of the Red Army.&quot; The Order of Victory is a standalone decoration awarded specially for service in World War II; unlike other awards such as the Hero of the Soviet Union, it does not belong to any order of ranking. In the history of the Soviet Union, the award had been awarded twenty times to twelve Soviet leaders and five foreign leaders, with one revocation. The last living recipient was King Michael I of Romania, who died on 5 December 2017.

==History==
The order was proposed by Colonel N. S. Neyelov, who was serving at the Soviet Army Rear headquarters around June 1943. The original name that Colonel Neyelov suggested was &quot;Order for Faithfulness to the Homeland&quot;; however, it was given its present name around October of that year.

On October 25, 1943, artist A. I. Kuznetsov, who was already the designer of many Soviet orders, presented his first sketch to Stalin. The sketch of a round medallion with portraits of Lenin and Stalin was not approved by the Supreme Commander. Instead, Stalin wanted a design with the Spasskaya Tower in the centre. Kuznetsov returned four days later with several new sketches, of which Stalin chose one entitled &quot;Victory&quot;. He asked Kuznetsov to slightly alter the design, and on the 5th of November a prototype was finally approved. The order was officially adopted on November 8, 1943, and was first awarded to Georgy Zhukov, Aleksandr Vasilevsky, and Joseph Stalin. All three were awarded a second order a year or more later.

The order was also bestowed to top commanders of the Allied forces. Every order was presented during or immediately after World War II, except for the controversial 1978 award to Leonid Brezhnev, who was not given a personal award, but an older one, originally awarded to Leonid Govorov, Marshal of the Soviet Union. (Govorov was already deceased, with his award returned to the state) Brezhnev&#x27;s award was revoked posthumously in 1989 for not meeting the requirements for the award.

Like other orders awarded by Communist nations, the Order of Victory could be awarded more than once to the same individual. In total, the order was presented twenty times to seventeen people (including Brezhnev).

Unlike all other Soviet orders, the Order of Victory had no serial number on it, the number was only mentioned in the award certificate. After a holder of the Order of Victory died, the award was to be given back to the state. Most of awards are now preserved by the Diamond Fund in the Moscow Kremlin. Notable exceptions are King Michael I of Romania&#x27;s Order of Victory, which is held in the collection of the Romanian Royal Family, Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s Order of Victory, which is on display at the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library and Museum in Abilene, Kansas, Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery&#x27;s Order of Victory, which is on display at the Imperial War Museum in London, and Josip Broz Tito&#x27;s Order of Victory, which is kept in the Museum of Yugoslav History in Belgrade.

==Construction details==
Against the sky, the letters &quot;СССР&quot; (USSR) appear in gold centered on the top of the medallion, while the word &quot;Победа&quot; (Victory) in white, is displayed on the red banner at the bottom, made with enamel. The total mass of the order is 78g, which consists of 47g of platinum, 2g of gold, 19g of silver, and 16 carats of diamond. The rubies in the Order are artificial, as natural rubies would differ too much in color. The medal is estimated to be worth $10 million.

Instead of being made at a mint, each Order was made in a jeweler&#x27;s workshop.

Dwight D. Eisenhower had his star valued by an American jeweler; according to Bernhard, Prince Consort of the Netherlands (who, having been Commander of the Dutch Armed Forces during the war, was interested in receiving such a prestigious award himself but never got it), Eisenhower told him that his stones were &quot;fakes&quot;.

==Ribbon==

The ribbons of various Soviet orders have been combined to create the Order Ribbon. The total length of the ribbon is 44 mm and it is mostly worn on the field uniform. The following featured orders are depicted on the ribbon (read from outside towards the center):
*Order of Glory (Орден Славы/Orden Slavy). Orange with black center stripe
*Order of Bogdan Khmelnitsky (Орден Богдана Хмельницкого/Orden Bogdana Khmelnitskogo). Light blue stripe
*Order of Alexander Nevsky (Орден Александра Невского/Orden Aleksandra Nevskogo). Dark red stripe
*Order of Kutuzov (Орден Кутузова/Orden Kutuzova). Dark blue stripe
*Order of Suvorov (Орден Суворова/Orden Suvorova). Green stripe
*Order of Lenin (Орден Ленина/Orden Lenina). Large Red stripe (center section)

==List of recipients==

==Fate of the Orders==

After the death of the recipient of the Order of Victory, it was to be given back to the state.

<doc id="1303104" wikidata="Q485568" url="?curid=1303104" title="Süper Lig">
<text>The Süper Lig (, &quot;Super League&quot;), officially known as [[Trendyol]] Süper Lig for sponsorship reasons, is a Turkish professional league for association football clubs. It is the top-flight of the Turkish football league system and is run by the Turkish Football Federation. In the 2023–2024 season, twenty clubs compete, where a champion is decided and three clubs are promoted from, and another four relegated to the 1. Lig. The season runs from August to May, with each club playing 38 matches. Matches are played Friday through Monday.

The league succeeded the Turkish Football Championship and the National Division, both being former top-level national competitions. The Süper Lig is currently 9th in the UEFA coefficient ranking of leagues based on club performances in European competitions over the last five years. A total of 75 clubs have competed in the Süper Lig, but only six have won the title to date: Galatasaray (24), Fenerbahçe (19), Beşiktaş (16), Trabzonspor (7), Başakşehir (1) and Bursaspor (1).

== History ==
Football in Turkey stems back to the late 19th century, when Englishmen brought the game with them while living in Salonica (then part of the Ottoman Empire). The first league competition was the Istanbul Football League, which took place in the 1904–05 season. The league went through several variations until the creation of the &quot;Millî Lig&quot; (Süper Lig) in 1959. Between the creation of the Istanbul League and Millî Lig, several other regional leagues took place: Adana (1924), Ankara (1922), Eskişehir (1924), İzmir (1924), Bursa (1924), and Trabzon (1922), to name a few. The first competition to bring forth a national champion was the former Turkish Football Championship, which began in 1924 and continued until 1951. The championship format was based on a knockout competition, contested between the winners of each of the country&#x27;s top regional leagues. The National Division (Turkish: &quot;Millî Küme&quot;) was the first national league competition in Turkey. Started in 1937, the National Division consisted of the strongest clubs from the Ankara, Istanbul, and İzmir leagues. The championship lasted until 1950.

In 1952 the TFF introduced professionalism in Turkish football. As a result, the former Turkish Football Championship lost its first level status. Since there was no top-level national champion in the period from 1952 to 1955, the Turkish federation sent Galatasaray, winners of the 1955–56 Istanbul League, to the European Cup in the 1956–57 season.

Protests of some Ankara and İzmir clubs regarding this decision, as well as UEFA deciding to only accept national champions to the European Cup from that season on induced the TFF to establish the Federation Cup in 1956. It is the first professional national football league in Turkey and the predecessor to the Super League(Millî Lig). The competition took place as a knock-out tournament to decide a national champion. This champion would go on to participate in the European Cup. The competition was held for two seasons until it was replaced by the Millî Lig. Beşiktaş won both editions and qualified for the European Cup during the two-year span. However, since the TFF failed to register their name for the draw in time, Beşiktaş could not participate in the 1957–58 season after all.

The top clubs of Ankara, Istanbul, and İzmir competed in the 1959 Turkish National League. The first season took place in the calendar year of 1959, instead of 1958 to 1959, since the qualifying stages took place in 1958. The 16 clubs who competed in the first season were: Adalet (Istanbul), Altay (İzmir), Ankaragücü (Ankara), Ankara Demirspor (Ankara), Beşiktaş (Istanbul), Beykoz (Istanbul), Karagümrük (Istanbul), Fenerbahçe (Istanbul), Galatasaray (Istanbul), Gençlerbirliği (Ankara), Göztepe (İzmir), Hacettepe Gençlik (Ankara), İstanbulspor, İzmirspor, Karşıyaka (İzmir), and Vefa (Istanbul). The first champions were Fenerbahçe and the first &quot;Gol Kralı&quot; (top scorer) was Metin Oktay. No clubs were promoted or relegated at the end of the first season.
The 2. Lig (Second League) was created at the start of the 1963–64 season and the Millî Lig became known as the 1.Lig (First League). Before the foundation of a second division, the bottom three clubs competed with regional league winners in a competition called the &quot;Baraj Games&quot;. The top three teams of the group were promoted to the Süper Lig. After the foundation of a new second division in 2001, known as the 1. Lig, the formerly titled 1. Lig was rebranded as Süper Lig. The Süper Lig is home of the Fenerbahçe–Galatasaray derby, the most watched football game in Turkey. It is considered to be one of the best and most intense in the world, being ranked among the greatest football rivalries of all time by various international sources.

On 12 December 2023, the Turkish Football Federation suspended all league games indefinitely following an incident during a match between MKE Ankaragucu and Caykur Rizespor which involved fans being able to successfully invade the pitch and people, including recent MKE Ankaragucu president Faruk Koca, being arrested after attacking referee Halil Umut Meler. Koca would resign from MKE Ankaragucu as well. However, on 13 December, the same day Meler was discharged from the hospital it was soon agreed that Super Lig matches would resume on 19 December.

== Format ==

There were 18 clubs in the Süper Lig until 2020. 20 Clubs are competing in the Süper Lig starting from 2020. During the course of the season (from August to May) each club plays the others twice (a double round robin system), once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents, for a total of 38 games. Teams receive three points for a win and one point for a draw. No points are awarded for a loss. Teams are ranked by total points, then head-to-head record, then goal difference, and then goals scored. At the end of each season, the club with the most points is crowned champion. If points are equal, the head-to-head record and then goal difference determine the winner. The three lowest placed teams are relegated to the 1. Lig and the top two teams from the 1. Lig, together with the winner of play-offs involving the third to seventh placed 1. Lig clubs are promoted in their place.

=== Domestic ===
==== 2016–2021: Record deal with beIN Sports====
On 28 November 2016 Qatari media group beIN (owner of Digiturk since 2015) won a 5-year deal to become the TV tender of the Süper Lig. They won the rights with a record offer worth $500M per season. Digiturk continued to offer the sports content with beIN’s support.

Before the start of the 2019–20 season, due to the wild fluctuations in value of the Turkish lira, beIN seek to renegotiate the fees for the upcoming season. The broadcaster settled on a $410 million agreement with the TFF.

On 18 November 2020, after originally signing a deal (in 2016) where the annual fees were split evenly between Turkish lira and US dollars, the wild fluctuations in value of the Turkish lira saw beIN seek to renegotiate the fees for the Süper Lig. The new reduced fee (₺2.65 billion/$340 million) had to be paid exclusively in Turkish lira, and took into account the financial realities of the COVID-19 crisis. Despite a drop in overall value, the Süper Lig’s TV rights income remained the sixth highest in Europe.

Due to the several negotiations and currency fluctuations, the 2021–22 season&#x27;s deal was decreased to $215 million.

==== 2022–2024: new two year deal with beIN ====
On 24 June 2022 TFF and beIN agreed a new two-year deal of the TV rights for an annual deal of ₺2.2 billion.

==== 2024–2027: contract renewal ====
On 2 March 2024 Turkish Football Federation stated that Qatari media group beIN has renewed its rights to broadcast Turkey&#x27;s top flight matches for three more years, until 2027. beIN will pay $182 million-a-year to broadcast Turkey&#x27;s Süper Lig and TFF First League. As such, Süper Lig becomes the 6th most valuable football league after the Big Five leagues in Europe.

<text>Bruce Harry Bellas (July 7, 1909 – July 1974) was an American photographer. He was influential in his work with male physiques and nudes. Bellas was well known under the pseudonym Bruce of Los Angeles.

==History and influence==
Bruce Harry Bellas was born in Alliance, Nebraska on July 7, 1909. He worked as a chemistry teacher there until 1947, when he began photographing bodybuilders in Los Angeles, California, beginning with taking pictures of bodybuilding competitions. In 1956, Bellas launched his own magazine, &quot;The Male Figure&quot;. Among physique photographers, Bellas&#x27; work was noted for having a distinctly campy, tongue-in-cheek sensibility. Bellas also produced a number of early homoerotic 8 mm films with titles such as &quot;Cowboy Washup&quot; and &quot;Big Gun for Hire&quot;.

Bellas was known to travel around the country, finding new models to photograph and also personally delivering nude photographs to customers, since they were liable to be seized by postal inspectors if sent through the mail.

An extensive archive of Bellas&#x27; nude male physique photographs exists today, largely intact. His impact on physique photography is largely felt and recognized, and the works of Robert Mapplethorpe, Herb Ritts, and Bruce Weber are widely considered to be influenced by Bellas&#x27; pioneering style. In 1990, the Wessel O&#x27;Connor Gallery in New York and the Jan Kesner Gallery in Los Angeles both exhibited a wide array of Bellas&#x27; work, furthering modern recognition of his impact.

Bellas died while on vacation in Canada in July 1974. He was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in the Hollywood Hills on August 9. Bellas was in a long-term relationship with favorite model Scotty Cunningham, to whom he left his estate.
