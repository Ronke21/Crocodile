<text>Thomas David Williams, known as Tommy Williams (born December 17, 1956), 
is a Republican former member of the Texas Senate, who represented District 4 in The Woodlands in Montgomery County in the Houston suburbs.

==Background==
Williams was first elected to the Texas Senate in 2002, after incumbent District 4 Senator David Bernsen, a Democrat, declined to seek re-election after redistricting changed the composition of the district. (Bernsen instead ran unsuccessfully for Texas Land Commissioner, losing that race to Jerry E. Patterson.)

After more than ten years in office, Williams, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, was in October 2013 in the process of resigning, to accept a government relations position at his alma mater, Texas A&amp;M University in College Station. On October 3, Williams confirmed that he would not run again in the Republican primary election scheduled for March 4, 2014.

Williams previously served three terms from 1997 to 2003 in the Texas House of Representatives. Williams has served as president of Woodforest Financial Services, an affiliate of Woodforest National Bank. Williams started his new position at Texas A&amp;M on December 2, 2013.

Among those seeking to fill Williams&#x27; Senate seat were neighboring State Representatives Steve Toth of District 15 in The Woodlands and Brandon Creighton of District 16 in Conroe, both of Montgomery County. Creighton defeated Toth in a runoff election to claim the seat.

<text>Garston is a suburban village in Hertfordshire, England. Garston is contiguous with Watford and now, despite retaining a local identity, is effectively a suburb. It is within the Stanborough, Woodside and Meriden wards of the borough of Watford, although a small number of its streets are in Hertsmere.

The Building Research Establishment has its headquarters within Garston.

Garston has several large secondary schools including St Michael&#x27;s Catholic High School, Parmiter&#x27;s School and Future Academies Watford, formerly known as Francis Combe. 

The A41 is the perceived border of Garston and North Watford; it crosses St Albans Road (A412) at the Dome Roundabout.

==Transport==
Garston railway station on the Abbey line is served by West Midlands Trains services. Arriva London operated a bus garage in Garston. It closed in 2018, and was completely demolished in early 2022.

<doc id="1266468" wikidata="Q2580157" url="?curid=1266468" title="Operation Dragon Rouge">
<text>Operation Dragon Rouge (, , meaning &quot;Operation Red Dragon&quot;) was a hostage rescue operation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo conducted jointly by Belgium and the United States in 1964. The operation was led by the Belgian Paracommando Regiment to rescue hostages held by Simba rebels in the city of Stanleyville.

== Background ==
By 1964, the Léopoldville government, supported by Western powers, was gaining a foothold in its fight to suppress the communist-backed Simba rebellion. Fearing an inevitable defeat, the rebels resorted to taking hostages of the local white population in areas under their control. On 28 October the Simba rebels arrested all Belgians and Americans in Stanleyville. Several hundred hostages were taken to Stanleyville and placed under guard in the Victoria Hotel.

The Léopoldville government turned to Belgium and the United States for help. In response, the Belgian army sent a task force to Léopoldville, airlifted by the U.S. 322nd Air Division. Washington and Brussels worked jointly on a rescue plan. Several ideas were considered and discarded, and all attempts at negotiating with the Simbas had failed.

== Operation ==
The Belgian task force was led by Colonel Charles Laurent. On the early morning of 24 November 1964, five American C-130 Hercules planes dropped 320 Belgian paratroopers of the Paracommando Regiment onto the airfield at Stanleyville. Once the paratroopers had secured the airfield and cleared the runway they made their way to the Victoria Hotel, prevented Simbas from killing most of the 60 hostages, and evacuated them via the airfield.

At 7:00 hrs, the hostages at Residence Victoria were rounded up by the Simba guards and ordered into the street. Around 50 of them had barricaded themselves in their rooms, after having heard the order on Radio Stanleyville at 6:30 to kill all foreigners, but most obediently moved into the street, as they were heading for the airfield. After a short march, when the Simba rebels got word that the airport of Stanleyville was now under Belgian control, the hostages were ordered to sit down in the street.

After a few minutes, when heavy firing was heard nearby, some of the Simbas opened fire on the seated Belgians and Americans. The Paracommandos intervened and stabilized the situation by killing and/or driving away the Simbas. Of the 250 hostages gathered by the rebels, 18 were dead, and 40 were heavily wounded.

Paul Carlson, an American medical missionary, was among those killed during the raid. Around 1,600 foreign nationals and 150 Congolese civilians were evacuated. In addition to the direct victims during the raid, several others were killed as a reaction to the arrival of the Belgian troops. Among these victims were many missionaries, such as the Dox brothers. By mid-December, about one month after Operation Dragon Rouge, a total of 185 foreign hostages left behind in various Simba controlled areas of the Congo, along with a few thousand Congolese civilians, had been executed by the Simba rebels.

== Aftermath ==
The operation coincided with the arrival of &quot;Armée nationale congolaise&quot; (ANC) and other foreign mercenary units—which likely included the hastily-formed 5th Mechanised Brigade and Mike Hoare&#x27;s 5 Commando—at Stanleyville, which was quickly captured. Because of growing international pressure, Belgium and the U.S. decided to abandon plans for follow-on operations in Bunia and Watsa. A second rescue operation, Operation Dragon Noir, was carried out in Paulis on 26 November. It took the central government until the end of the year to completely put down the remaining areas of the Simba rebellion.

Despite the success of the raid, Moise Tshombe&#x27;s prestige was damaged by the joint Belgian–U.S. operation which saw white mercenaries and Western forces intervene once again in the Congo. In particular, Tshombe lost the support of President Joseph Kasa-Vubu and Chief of the Army Joseph-Desiré Mobutu. Tshombe was dismissed from his post as prime minister in October 1965. In Burundi, protests occurred outside the Belgian and United States embassies.

<text>Jáchymov (; or &quot;Joachimsthal&quot;) is a spa town in Karlovy Vary District in the Karlovy Vary Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 2,400 inhabitants.

Jáchymov has a long mining tradition, thanks to which it used to be the second most populous town in the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1534. At first silver was mined here. The silver coins minted here since the 16th century gave their name to the Thaler and the dollar. After the Wieliczka Salt Mine ceased industrial exploitation in 2007, the Svornost mine (1525) became the oldest mine still in use in Europe. It was also the first (and for a long time the only) place in the world where radium was mined.

The mining cultural landscape of Jáchymov is a UNESCO World Heritage Site as a part of the Ore Mountain Mining Region. The historic centre of the town is well preserved and protected as an urban monument zone.

==Administrative division==
Jáchymov consists of five municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):

*Jáchymov (1,853)
*Mariánská (230)
*Nové Město (52)
*Suchá (69)
*Vršek (3)
==Etymology==
The town was founded in a nameless valley called in German just &quot;Thal&quot; (i.e. &quot;valley&quot;). Later it was named &quot;Sankt Joachimsthal&quot; after Saint Joachim, meaning &quot;Saint Joachim&#x27;s Valley&quot;. It later developed into the Czech name Jáchymov.

==Geography==
Jáchymov is located about north of Karlovy Vary, on the border with Germany. It lies in the Ore Mountains. The municipal territory includes the summit of the highest mountain of the whole mountain range, Klínovec at , and the third largest mountain, Božídarský Špičák at . The town proper is situated in a valley at an altitude of above sea level.

==History==

In 1512, silver was found in the area. The village of Jáchymov was founded by Štěpán Schlick in 1516 under its German name &quot;Joachimsthal&quot;. The silver caused the population to grow rapidly, and made the Counts of Schlick, whose possessions included the town, one of the richest families in Bohemia. In 1528, Ferdinand I seized the right of mining, and the Schlick family lost their profitable business.

Since 1520, the Schlicks had silver coins minted, which were called &quot;Joachimsthalers&quot;. They became known in German as &quot;Thaler&quot; and as tolar in Czech, which via the Dutch or is the etymological origin of the currency name &quot;dollar&quot;.

The fame of Jáchymov for its ore mining and smelting works attracted the scientific attention of the doctor Georg Bauer (better known by the Latin form of his name, Georgius Agricola) in the late 1527–1531, who based his pioneering metallurgical studies on his observations made here.

In 1534, Jáchymov was the second most populous town in the Kingdom of Bohemia with about 20,000 people.

In 1523, the Protestant Reformation began. In the Schmalkaldic War (1546–47) Jáchymov was occupied for a time by Saxon troops. When in 1621 the Counter-Reformation and re-Catholicisation took effect in the town, many Lutheran citizens and people from the mountains migrated to nearby Saxon White Serbia.

Following the Silesian Wars until 1918, the town was part of Austria-Hungary, head of the district with the same name, one of the 94 &quot;Bezirkshauptmannschaften&quot; in Bohemia.

In the 18th century, mining was significant in the town. In addition to silver ore, other ores were mined here: nickel, bismuth, lead, arsenic and cobalt, and near the town also tin. In the 19th century, uranium ore was also extracted in Jáchymov.

There were also other industries than mining: in 1856 and 1860, a uranium paint factory and a tobacco factory were opened. In 1873, the town was badly damaged by a large fire and lost its face. At the end of the 19th century, Maria Skłodowska-Curie discovered in a uraninite spoil dump from Jáchymov, ore containing the element radium, for which she won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Until World War I this was the foremost source of radium in the world. In 1929, Dr. Löwy of Prague discovered that &quot;mysterious emanations&quot; in the mine led to a form of cancer. Ventilation and watering measures were introduced, miners were given higher pay and longer vacations, but death rates remained high.

Following the Munich Agreement in 1938, Joachimstal was annexed by Nazi Germany and administered as part of the Reichsgau Sudetenland. Most of the German population was expelled in 1945–1946 according to the Beneš decrees.

Mining in uranium mines took place here between 1939 and 1964, for nuclear projects of Nazi and Communist facilities. It was proven that the uranium mined here was used in the German nuclear weapons program in their ultimately unsuccessful quest to build a nuclear reactor. In times of Nazi occupation and Communism large prison camps were established in the town and around it. Soviet prisoners of war first worked here, and after 1948 political and other prisoners. Opponents of the new regime (Stalinism) were forced to mine uranium ore under very harsh conditions: the average life expectancy in Jáchymov at this period was 42 years. Uranium mining ceased in 1964.

The mines today (with the exception of Svornost) are no longer in operation and, for example, in the Eduard mine complex there is now a sports complex with a biathlon shooting range. The radioactive thermal springs which arise in the Svornost mine are used under the supervision of doctors for the treatment of patients with nervous and rheumatic disorders. They make use of the constantly produced radioactive gas radon (222Rn) dissolved in the water, see Radon therapy.

==Demographics==
==Spa==
In 1864, a spring of radon-rich water was discovered in Jáchymov. The world&#x27;s first radon spa was founded in Jáchymov in 1906, joining the existing spas of the region such as Karlovy Vary, Františkovy Lázně and Mariánské Lázně.

The facility offers treatments for a range of medical conditions, based on the controversial theory of radiation hormesis. The treatments offered cover a range of neurological disorders and skin diseases, as well as various musculoskeletal conditions such as osteoarthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. The radon baths are further alleged to improve conditions of patients with diabetes, gout and conditions arising from complications of injuries and operations.

==Transport==
There is no railway to the town. The most important connection is the road I/25 leading from Ostrov to the Czech-German border. The bus line connects Jáchymov with Karlovy Vary.

==Sport==
Jáchymov is the centre of winter sports. There are three ski areas with ski lifts in the municipal territory: Novako, Klínovec and Klínovec-Neklid. In the vicinity of the town is the Eduard biathlon complex, which offers several kilometres of cross-country trails.

The town has a water park that bears the name of Georgius Agricola.

==Sights==
The town with the surrounding area forms the Jáchymov Mining Landscape, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site as part of Ore Mountain Mining Region. There are many technical monuments associated with mining activities, including the Svornost Mine, old mines, landscaping and architecture created as a result of mining.

The historic centre of the town from the 16th century is well preserved and protected by law as an urban monument zone. It is a comprehensive set of burgher houses and patrician houses with unique portals. Those that have not been preserved in the original Renaissance style have a Renaissance core and have been rebuilt mostly in the Baroque and Neoclassical style. The oldest pharmacy in what is today the Czech Republic was located in the patrician house No. 131. It was opened around 1520.

The history of mining in the area is together with the history of the town is documented in Royal Mint Jáchymov Museum, housed in the former royal mint on the town square. The mint was built in 1533–1536 and its present form is the result of several reconstructions due to fires.

Next to the mint is the town hall. It was originally the house of Hieronymus Schlick, bought by the town in 1531. It was extended in 1538–1544 and rebuilt to its present form with Art Nouveau elements in 1901–1902. in the basement of the town hall there is a unique collection of the Latin school library from the early 16th century.

In the middle of the town square is the Holy Trinity Column dating from 1703.

The Freudenstein Castle (also called Schlick&#x27;s Castle) was built like most of the town around 1520. Its purpose was the protection of mining and the town. This was probably the last castle in the Czech Republic built as a defensive element and not as an aristocratic residence. In 1634, it completely burned down and remained a ruin. Two towers with part of the fortifications have survived to this day. The so-called Schlick&#x27;s tower served the town as a signal tower. The second tower, called &quot;Prachárna&quot;, served the miners as an ammunition store.

===Sacral monuments===

The Church of All Saints was built in the early Renaissance style in 1520. It is a valuable building that is partially half-timbered.

The Church of St. Joachim was built in 1534–1540. It was the first Lutheran church in the Kingdom of Bohemia. From 1624, it was a Roman Catholic church. In 1764–1785, the originally Renaissance building was baroque rebuilt. After it was damaged by a fire, it was reconstructed in 1874-1876 in the pseudo-Gothic style.

The Evangelical church was built in the pseudo-Renaissance style in 1904 and is also a cultural monument.

===Spa architecture===
The oldest spa building is Agricola Spa Centre, built in 1906–1911. One of the landmarks of Jáchymov is the Neoclassical building of Radium Palace Hotel. It dates from 1912. It was one of the most modern hotels of its time, whose guests included Richard Strauss, Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk and Fuad I.

The Monument to Maria Skłodowska-Curie and Pierre Curie was created by sculptor Karel Lidický in 1966. The text on it recalls the discovery of radium in this area.

==Notable people==
*Georgius Agricola (1494–1555), German scholar, mineralogist and metallurgist
*Johannes Mathesius (1504–1565), German minister and a Lutheran reformer

<text>Spörer is a lunar impact crater that lies just to the north of the crater Herschel, and southeast of the lava-flooded Flammarion. To the southeast is Gyldén, and to the northeast is Réaumur.

Its diameter is 26 km. The crater is named after German astronomer Gustav Spörer.

The floor of this crater has been flooded with basaltic lava, leaving only a shallow rim above the surface. The narrow rim is roughly circular but irregular and broken in several locations. The rim has a slight outward bulge to the northwest. The interior of the crater is level and featureless.
==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Spörer.

<doc id="1266475" wikidata="Q1096878" url="?curid=1266475" title="Scuba diving">
<text>Scuba diving is a mode of underwater diving whereby divers use breathing equipment that is completely independent of a surface breathing gas supply, and therefore has a limited but variable endurance. The word &quot;scuba&quot; is an acronym for &quot;Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus&quot; and was coined by Christian J. Lambertsen in a patent submitted in 1952. Scuba divers carry their own source of breathing gas, affording them greater independence and movement than surface-supplied divers, and more time underwater than freedivers. Although the use of compressed air is common, other gas blends are also used.

Open-circuit scuba systems discharge the breathing gas into the environment as it is exhaled and consist of one or more diving cylinders containing breathing gas at high pressure which is supplied to the diver at ambient pressure through a diving regulator. They may include additional cylinders for range extension, decompression gas or emergency breathing gas. Closed-circuit or semi-closed circuit rebreather scuba systems allow recycling of exhaled gases. The volume of gas used is reduced compared to that of open-circuit, making longer dives feasible. Rebreathers extend the time spent underwater compared to open-circuit for the same metabolic gas consumption. They produce fewer bubbles and less noise than open-circuit scuba, which makes them attractive to covert military divers to avoid detection, scientific divers to avoid disturbing marine animals, and media divers to avoid bubble interference.

Scuba diving may be done recreationally or professionally in a number of applications, including scientific, military and public safety roles, but most commercial diving uses surface-supplied diving equipment for breathing gas security when this is practicable. Scuba divers engaged in armed forces covert operations may be referred to as frogmen, combat divers or attack swimmers.

A scuba diver primarily moves underwater using fins worn on the feet, but external propulsion can be provided by a diver propulsion vehicle, or a sled towed from the surface. Other equipment needed for scuba diving includes a mask to improve underwater vision, exposure protection by means of a diving suit, ballast weights to overcome excess buoyancy, equipment to control buoyancy, and equipment related to the specific circumstances and purpose of the dive, which may include a snorkel when swimming on the surface, a cutting tool to manage entanglement, lights, a dive computer to monitor decompression status, and signalling devices. Scuba divers are trained in the procedures and skills appropriate to their level of certification by diving instructors affiliated to the diver certification organizations which issue these certifications. These include standard operating procedures for using the equipment and dealing with the general hazards of the underwater environment, and emergency procedures for self-help and assistance of a similarly equipped diver experiencing problems. A minimum level of fitness and health is required by most training organisations, but a higher level of fitness may be appropriate for some applications.

==History==


===Origins===
Although underwater diving in the mode of freediving has been practiced for thousands of years, the history of scuba diving, closely linked with the history of scuba equipment, began in the 19th century and by the early twentieth century, two basic architectures for underwater breathing apparatus had been developed. Open-circuit surface-supplied equipment, where the diver&#x27;s exhaled gas is vented directly into the water, and closed-circuit scuba where the diver&#x27;s carbon dioxide is filtered from exhaled unused oxygen, which is then recirculated, with oxygen added to make up the volume when necessary. By the mid-twentieth century, high pressure gas cylinders were available and two systems for scuba had emerged: open-circuit scuba where the diver&#x27;s exhaled breath is vented directly into the water, and closed-circuit scuba where the carbon dioxide is removed from the diver&#x27;s exhaled breath which has oxygen added and is recirculated. Oxygen rebreathers are severely depth-limited due to oxygen toxicity risk, which increases with depth, and the available systems for mixed gas rebreathers were fairly bulky, designed for use with diving helmets and often relied on a constant gas supply for driving recirculation.

The first commercially practical scuba rebreather was designed and built by the diving engineer Henry Fleuss in 1878, while working for Siebe Gorman in London. His self-contained breathing apparatus consisted of a rubber mask connected to a breathing bag, with an estimated 50–60% oxygen supplied from a copper tank and carbon dioxide scrubbed by passing it through a bundle of rope yarn soaked in a solution of caustic potash, the system giving a dive duration of up to about three hours. This apparatus had no way of measuring the gas composition during use. During the 1930s and all through World War II, the British, Italians and Germans developed and extensively used oxygen rebreathers to equip the first frogmen. The British adapted the Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus and the Germans adapted the Dräger submarine escape rebreathers, for their frogmen during the war. In the U.S. Major Christian J. Lambertsen invented an underwater free-swimming oxygen rebreather in 1939, which was accepted by the Office of Strategic Services. In 1952 he patented a modification of his apparatus, this time named SCUBA (an acronym for &quot;self-contained underwater breathing apparatus&quot;), which became the generic English word for autonomous breathing equipment for diving, and later for the activity using the equipment. After World War II, military frogmen continued to use rebreathers since they do not make bubbles which would give away the presence of the divers. The high percentage of oxygen used by these early rebreather systems limited the depth at which they could be used due to the risk of convulsions caused by acute oxygen toxicity.

Although a working demand regulator system had been invented in 1864 by Auguste Denayrouze and Benoît Rouquayrol, the first open-circuit scuba system developed in 1925 by Yves Le Prieur in France was a manually adjusted free-flow system with a low endurance, which limited its practical usefulness. In 1942, during the German occupation of France, Jacques-Yves Cousteau and Émile Gagnan designed the first successful and safe open-circuit scuba, known as the Aqua-Lung. Their system combined an improved demand regulator with high-pressure air tanks, and was patented in 1945. To sell his regulator in English-speaking countries Cousteau registered the Aqua-Lung trademark, which was first licensed to the U.S. Divers company, and in 1948 to Siebe Gorman of England. Siebe Gorman was allowed to sell in Commonwealth countries but had difficulty in meeting the demand, and the U.S. patent prevented others from making the product. The patent was circumvented by Ted Eldred of Melbourne, Australia, who developed the single-hose open-circuit scuba system in 1952, which separates the first stage and demand valve of the pressure regulator by a low-pressure hose, puts the demand valve at the diver&#x27;s mouth, and releases exhaled gas through the demand valve casing.

===Early equipment===
Early scuba sets were usually provided with a plain harness of shoulder straps and a waist belt, and early scuba divers dived without a buoyancy aid. In an emergency they had to jettison their weights. In the 1960s adjustable buoyancy life jackets (ABLJ) became available, which can be used to compensate for loss of buoyancy at depth due to compression of the neoprene wetsuit and as a lifejacket that will hold an unconscious diver face-upwards at the surface, and that can be quickly inflated. The first versions were inflated from a small disposable carbon dioxide cylinder, later with a small direct coupled air cylinder, and eventually with a low-pressure feed from the regulator first-stage to an inflation/deflation valve unit with an oral inflation valve for backup. The inflation system and a dump valve lets the volume of the ABLJ be controlled as a buoyancy aid. In 1971 the stabilizer jacket was introduced by ScubaPro. This class of buoyancy aid is known as a buoyancy control device or buoyancy compensator.

===Configuration development===

A backplate and wing is an alternative configuration of a scuba harness with a buoyancy compensation bladder mounted behind the diver, sandwiched between the backplate and the cylinder or cylinders. This arrangement became popular with cave divers making long or deep dives, who needed to carry several extra cylinders, as it clears the front and sides of the diver for other equipment to be attached in the region where it is easily accessible. Sidemount is a scuba diving equipment configuration which has basic scuba sets, each comprising a single cylinder with a dedicated regulator and pressure gauge, mounted alongside the diver, clipped to the harness below the shoulders and along the hips, instead of on the back of the diver. It originated as a configuration for advanced cave diving, as it facilitates penetration of tight sections of caves since sets can be easily removed and remounted when necessary. The configuration allows easy access to cylinder valves and provides easy and reliable gas redundancy. These benefits for operating in confined spaces were also recognized by divers who made wreck diving penetrations. Sidemount diving has grown in popularity within the technical diving community for general decompression diving, and has become a popular specialty for recreational diving.

===Alternative breathing gases and technical diving===

In the 1950s the United States Navy (USN) documented enriched oxygen gas procedures for military use of what is today called nitrox, and in 1970, Morgan Wells of NOAA began instituting diving procedures for oxygen-enriched air. In 1979 NOAA published procedures for the scientific use of nitrox in the NOAA Diving Manual. In 1985 IAND (International Association of Nitrox Divers) began teaching nitrox use for recreational diving. This was considered dangerous by some, and met with heavy skepticism by the diving community. Nevertheless, in 1992 NAUI became the first existing major recreational diver training agency to sanction nitrox, and eventually, in 1996, the Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI) announced full educational support for nitrox. The use of a single nitrox mixture has become part of recreational diving, and multiple gas mixtures are common in technical diving to reduce overall decompression time.

Technical diving is recreational scuba diving that exceeds the generally accepted recreational limits and may expose the diver to hazards beyond those normally associated with recreational diving, and to greater risks of serious injury or death. These risks may be reduced by appropriate skills, knowledge and experience, and by using suitable equipment and procedures. The concept and term are both relatively recent advents, although divers had already been engaging in what is now commonly referred to as technical diving for decades. One reasonably widely held definition is that any dive in which at some point of the planned profile it is not physically possible or physiologically acceptable to make a direct and uninterrupted vertical ascent to surface air is a technical dive. The equipment often involves breathing gases other than air or standard nitrox mixtures, multiple gas sources, and different equipment configurations. Over time, some equipment and techniques developed for technical diving have become more widely accepted for recreational diving.

In 1924 the US Navy started to investigate the possibility of using helium in breathing gases, and after animal experiments, human subjects breathing heliox 20/80 (20% oxygen, 80% helium) were successfully decompressed from deep dives, In 1963 saturation dives using trimix were made during Project Genesis, and in 1979 a research team at the Duke University Medical Center Hyperbaric Laboratory started work which identified the use of trimix to prevent the symptoms of high-pressure nervous syndrome. Cave divers started using trimix to allow deeper dives and it was used extensively in the 1987 Wakulla Springs Project and spread to the north-east American wreck diving community and then worldwide.

The challenges of deeper dives and longer penetrations and the large amounts of breathing gas necessary for these dive profiles and ready availability of oxygen-sensing cells beginning in the late 1980s led to a resurgence of interest in rebreather diving. By accurately measuring the partial pressure of oxygen, it became possible to maintain and accurately monitor a breathable gas mixture in the loop at any depth. In the mid-1990s semi-closed circuit rebreathers became available for the recreational scuba market, followed by closed circuit rebreathers around the turn of the millennium. Rebreathers are currently manufactured for the military, technical and recreational scuba markets, but remain less popular, less reliable, more complex to operate, and more expensive than open-circuit equipment.

==Equipment==

Scuba diving equipment, also known as scuba gear, is the equipment used by a scuba diver for the purpose of diving, and includes the breathing apparatus, diving suit, buoyancy control and weighting systems, fins for mobility, mask for improving underwater vision, and a variety of safety equipment and other accessories.

===Breathing apparatus===

The defining equipment used by a scuba diver is the eponymous &quot;scuba&quot;, the self-contained underwater breathing apparatus which allows the diver to breathe while diving, and is transported by the diver. It is also commonly referred to as the scuba set.

Breathing gas must be supplied to the diver at ambient pressure, which is the sum of atmospheric pressure on the surface and the hydrostatic pressure due to the weight of the water above the diver. The gas may be delivered via a mouthpiece held by the teeth or a full-face mask which covers the eyes, nose and mouth, and may allow the diver to breathe through the nose and protect the diver&#x27;s airway if the diver loses consciousness.

====Open-circuit====


Open-circuit scuba discharges the gas inhaled from the scuba equipment dirctly to the environment, or occasionally into another item of equipment for a special purpose, usually to increase the buoyancy of a lifting device such as a buoyancy compensator, inflatable surface marker buoy or small lifting bag. The breathing gas is generally provided from a high-pressure diving cylinder through a scuba regulator. By always providing the appropriate breathing gas at ambient pressure, demand valve regulators ensure the diver can inhale and exhale naturally and without unnecessary effort, regardless of depth, as and when needed.

The most commonly used scuba set configuration uses a &quot;single-hose&quot; open-circuit 2-stage demand regulator, connected to a single back-mounted high-pressure gas cylinder, with the first stage connected to the cylinder valve and the second stage at the mouthpiece. This arrangement differs from Émile Gagnan&#x27;s and Jacques Cousteau&#x27;s original 1942 &quot;twin-hose&quot; design, known as the Aqualung, in which the cylinder pressure was reduced to ambient pressure in one or two stages which were all in the housing mounted to the cylinder valve or manifold. The &quot;single-hose&quot; system has significant advantages over the original system for most applications.

In the &quot;single-hose&quot; two-stage design, the first stage regulator reduces the cylinder pressure of up to about to an intermediate pressure (IP) of about above ambient pressure. The second stage demand valve regulator, supplied by a low-pressure hose from the first stage, delivers the breathing gas at ambient pressure to the diver&#x27;s mouth. The exhaled gases are exhausted directly to the environment as waste through a non-return valve on the second stage housing. The first stage typically has at least one outlet port delivering gas at full tank pressure which is connected to the diver&#x27;s submersible pressure gauge or dive computer, or a wireless pressure transmitter, to show how much breathing gas remains in the cylinder.

====Rebreather====
Less common are closed circuit (CCR) and semi-closed (SCR) rebreathers which, unlike open-circuit sets that vent off all exhaled gases, process all or part of each exhaled breath for reuse by removing the carbon dioxide and replacing the oxygen used by the diver. Rebreathers release little or no gas bubbles into the water, and use much less stored gas volume for an equivalent depth and time because exhaled gas is recovered; this has advantages for research, military, photography, and other applications. Rebreathers are more complex and more expensive than open-circuit scuba, and special training and correct maintenance are required for them to be safely used, due to the larger variety of potential failure modes.

In a closed-circuit rebreather the oxygen partial pressure in the rebreather is controlled, so it can be maintained at a relatively high safe constant level, which reduces the inert gas (nitrogen and/or helium) partial pressure in the breathing loop. Minimizing the inert gas loading of the diver&#x27;s tissues for a given dive profile reduces the decompression obligation. This requires continuous monitoring of actual partial pressures with time and for maximum effectiveness requires real-time computer processing by the diver&#x27;s decompression computer. Tissue gas loads can be much reduced compared to fixed ratio gas mixes used in open circuit scuba systems, and as a result, divers can stay down longer or require less time to decompress. A semi-closed circuit rebreather injects a constant mass flow of a fixed breathing gas mixture into the breathing loop, or replaces a specific percentage of the respired volume, so the partial pressure of oxygen at any time during the dive depends on the diver&#x27;s oxygen consumption and/or breathing rate. Planning decompression requirements requires a more conservative approach for a SCR than for a CCR, but decompression computers with a real-time oxygen partial pressure input can optimize decompression for these systems. Because rebreathers produce very little volume of exhaust bubbles, they do not disturb marine life or make a diver&#x27;s presence known at the surface; this is useful for underwater photography, and for covert work.

====Gas mixtures====


For some diving, gas mixtures other than normal atmospheric air (21% oxygen, 78% nitrogen, 1% trace gases) can be used, so long as the diver is competent in their use. The most commonly used mixture is nitrox, also called Enriched Air Nitrox (EAN or EANx), which is air with extra oxygen, often with 32% or 36% oxygen, and thus less nitrogen, reducing the risk of decompression sickness or allowing longer exposure to the same pressure for equal risk. The reduced nitrogen may also allow for no stops or shorter decompression stop times or a shorter surface interval between dives.

The increased partial pressure of oxygen due to the higher oxygen content of nitrox increases the risk of oxygen toxicity, which becomes unacceptable below the maximum operating depth of the mixture. To displace nitrogen without the increased oxygen concentration, other diluent gases can be used, usually helium, when the resultant three gas mixture is called trimix, and when the nitrogen is fully substituted by helium, heliox.

For dives requiring long decompression stops, divers may carry cylinders containing different gas mixtures for the various phases of the dive, typically designated as travel, bottom, and decompression gases. These different gas mixtures may be used to extend bottom time, reduce inert gas narcotic effects, and reduce decompression times. Back gas refers to any gas carried on the diver&#x27;s back, usually bottom gas.

===Diver mobility===
To take advantage of the freedom of movement afforded by scuba equipment, the diver needs to be mobile underwater. Personal mobility is enhanced by swimfins and optionally diver propulsion vehicles. Fins have a large blade area and use the more powerful leg muscles, so are much more efficient for propulsion and maneuvering thrust than arm and hand movements, but require skill to provide fine control. Several types of fin are available, some of which may be more suited for maneuvering, alternative kick styles, speed, endurance, reduced effort or ruggedness. Neutral buoyancy will allow propulsive effort to be directed in the direction of intended motion and will reduce induced drag. Streamlining dive gear will also reduce drag and improve mobility. Balanced trim which allows the diver to align in any desired direction also improves streamlining by presenting the smallest section area to the direction of movement and allowing propulsion thrust to be used more efficiently.

Occasionally a diver may be towed using a &quot;sled&quot;, an unpowered device towed behind a surface vessel that conserves the diver&#x27;s energy and allows more distance to be covered for a given air consumption and bottom time. The depth is usually controlled by the diver by using diving planes or by tilting the whole sled. Some sleds are faired to reduce drag on the diver.

===Buoyancy control equipment===

Buoyancy control is a critical skill for safety, and as the typical scuba diver with their basic equipment is not inherently neutrally buoyant, other equipment is used to allow control of buoyancy. Most excess buoyancy is due to the diving suit volume, and this varies with suit thermal insulation and depth.
The ability to ascend at a controlled rate and remain at a constant depth is important for correct decompression. Recreational divers who do not incur decompression obligations can get away with imperfect buoyancy control, but when long decompression stops at specific depths are required, the risk of decompression sickness is increased by depth variations while at a stop. Decompression stops are typically done when the breathing gas in the cylinders has been largely used up, and the reduction in weight of the cylinders increases the buoyancy of the diver. Enough ballast weight must be carried to allow the diver to decompress at the end of the dive with nearly empty cylinders, and enough buoyancy compensation must be possible to remain at the surface before the dive with full cylinders.

====Diver weighting====

Scuba diving equipment can make the diver buoyant, requiring the addition of ballast to make it possible to submerge and remain submerged until the diver wants to surface. The amount and distribution of dive weights affects the convenience, efficiency, environmental impact, and safety of the diver.

Buoyancy changes with depth variation are proportional to the compressible part of the volume of the diver and equipment, and to the proportional change in pressure, which is greater per unit of depth near the surface. Minimizing the volume of gas required in the buoyancy compensator will minimize the buoyancy fluctuations with changes in depth. This can be achieved by accurate selection of ballast weight, which should be the minimum to allow neutral buoyancy with depleted gas supplies at the surface at the end of the dive unless there is an operational requirement for greater negative buoyancy during the dive.

====Buoyancy compensator====
To dive safely, divers must control their rate of descent and ascent in the water and be able to maintain a constant depth in midwater. Ignoring other forces such as water currents and swimming, the diver&#x27;s overall buoyancy determines whether they ascend or descend. Equipment such as diving weighting systems, diving suits, and buoyancy compensators(BC) can be used to adjust the overall buoyancy. When divers want to remain at constant depth, they try to achieve neutral buoyancy. This minimizes the effort of swimming to maintain depth and therefore reduces gas consumption.

A buoyancy compensator (BC), also called a buoyancy control device (BCD), is the equipment used by divers to establish neutral buoyancy underwater and positive buoyancy at the surface, when needed. The buoyancy is usually controlled by adjusting the volume of gas in an inflatable bladder, which is filled with ambient pressure gas from the diver&#x27;s primary breathing gas cylinder via a low-pressure hose from the regulator first stage, directly from a small cylinder dedicated to this purpose, or from the diver&#x27;s mouth through the oral inflation valve. Ambient pressure bladder buoyancy compensators can be broadly classified as having the buoyancy primarily in front, surrounding the torso, or behind the diver. This affects the ergonomics, and to a lesser degree, the safety of the unit.

The buoyancy force on the diver is the weight of the volume of the liquid that they and their equipment displace minus the weight of the diver and their equipment; if the result is positive, that force is upwards. The buoyancy of any object immersed in water is also affected by the density of the water. The density of fresh water is about 3% less than that of ocean water. Therefore, divers who are neutrally buoyant at one dive destination will predictably be positively or negatively buoyant when using the same equipment at destinations with different water densities. The removal (&quot;ditching&quot; or &quot;shedding&quot;) of diver weighting systems can be used to reduce the diver&#x27;s weight and cause a buoyant ascent in an emergency.

Diving suits made of compressible materials decrease in volume as the diver descends, and expand again as the diver ascends, causing buoyancy changes. Diving in different environments also necessitates adjustments in the amount of weight carried to achieve neutral buoyancy. The diver can inject air into a dry suit to counteract the compression effect and squeeze, but dry suits are not suitable for general buoyancy compensation. Buoyancy compensators allow easy and fine adjustments in the diver&#x27;s overall volume and therefore buoyancy. Neutral buoyancy in a diver is an unstable state. It is changed by small differences in ambient pressure caused by a change in depth, and the change has a positive feedback effect. A small descent will increase the pressure, which will compress the gas-filled spaces and reduce the total volume of diver and equipment. This will further reduce the buoyancy, and unless counteracted, will result in sinking more rapidly. The equivalent effect applies to a small ascent, which will trigger an increased buoyancy and will result in an accelerated ascent unless counteracted. The diver must continuously adjust buoyancy or depth in order to remain neutral. Fine control of buoyancy can be achieved by controlling the average lung volume in open-circuit scuba, but this feature is not available to the closed circuit rebreather diver, as exhaled gas remains in the breathing loop. This is a skill that improves with practice until it becomes second nature.

===Diver trim===

The trim of a diver is the orientation of the body in the water, determined by posture and the distribution of weight and volume along the body and equipment, as well as by any other forces acting on the diver. Both static trim and its stability affect the convenience and safety of the diver while under water and at the surface. Midwater trim is usually considered at approximately neutral buoyancy for a swimming scuba diver, but surface trim may be at significant positive buoyancy to keep the head above water. Trim can significantly affect drag of a diver. The effect of swimming with a head up angle of about 15°, as is quite common in poorly trimmed divers, can be an increase in drag in the order of 50%.

===Underwater vision===

Water has a higher refractive index than air – similar to that of the cornea of the eye. Light entering the cornea from water is hardly refracted at all, leaving only the eye&#x27;s crystalline lens to focus light. This leads to very severe hypermetropia. People with severe myopia, therefore, can see better underwater without a mask than normal-sighted people. Diving masks and helmets solve this problem by providing an air space in front of the diver&#x27;s eyes. The refraction error created by the water is mostly corrected as the light travels from water to air through a flat lens, except that objects appear approximately 34% bigger and 25% closer in water than they actually are. The faceplate of the mask is supported by a frame and skirt, which are opaque or translucent, therefore the total field-of-view is significantly reduced and eye-hand coordination must be adjusted.

Divers who need corrective lenses to see clearly outside the water would normally need the same prescription while wearing a mask. Generic corrective lenses are available off the shelf for some two-window masks, and custom lenses can be bonded onto masks that have a single front window or two windows.

As a diver descends, they must periodically exhale through their nose to equalize the internal pressure of the mask with that of the surrounding water. Swimming goggles are not suitable for diving because they only cover the eyes and thus do not allow for equalization. Failure to equalize the pressure inside the mask may lead to a form of barotrauma known as mask squeeze. Masks tend to fog when warm humid exhaled air condenses on the cold inside of the faceplate. To prevent fogging many divers spit into the dry mask before use, spread the saliva over the inside of the glass and rinse it out with a little water. The saliva residue allows condensation to wet the glass and form a continuous wet film, rather than tiny droplets. There are several commercial products that can be used as an alternative to saliva, some of which are more effective and last longer, but there is a risk of getting the anti-fog agent in the eyes.

====Dive lights====
Water attenuates light by selective absorption. Pure water preferentially absorbs red light, and to a lesser extent, yellow and green, so the colour that is least absorbed is blue light. Dissolved materials may also selectively absorb colour in addition to the absorption by the water itself. In other words, as a diver goes deeper on a dive, more colour is absorbed by the water, and in clean water the colour becomes blue with depth. Colour vision is also affected by the turbidity of the water which tends to reduce contrast. Artificial light is useful to provide light in the darkness, to restore contrast at close range, and to restore natural colour lost to absorption. Dive lights can also attract fish and a variety of other sea creatures.

===Exposure protection===


Protection from heat loss in cold water is usually provided by wetsuits or dry suits. These also provide protection from sunburn, abrasion and stings from some marine organisms. Where thermal insulation is not important, lycra suits or diving skins may be sufficient.

A wetsuit is a garment, usually made of foamed neoprene, which provides thermal insulation, abrasion resistance and buoyancy. The insulation properties depend on bubbles of gas enclosed within the material, which reduce its ability to conduct heat. The bubbles also give the wetsuit a low density, providing buoyancy in water. Suits range from a thin (2 mm or less) &quot;shortie&quot;, covering just the torso, to a full 8 mm semi-dry, usually complemented by neoprene boots, gloves and hood. A good close fit and few zips help the suit to remain waterproof and reduce flushing – the replacement of water trapped between suit and body by cold water from the outside. Improved seals at the neck, wrists and ankles and baffles under zips produce a suit known as &quot;semi-dry&quot;.

A dry suit also provides thermal insulation to the wearer while immersed in water, and generally protects the entire body except the head, hands, and sometimes the feet. In some configurations, these are also covered. Dry suits are usually used where the water temperature is below 15 °C (60 °F) or for extended immersion in water above 15 °C (60 °F), where a wetsuit user would get cold, and with an integral helmet, boots, and gloves for personal protection when diving in contaminated water. Dry suits are designed to prevent water from entering. This generally allows better insulation making them more suitable for use in cold water. They can be uncomfortably hot in warm or hot air, and are typically more expensive and more complex to don. They add some task loading for the diver as the suit must be inflated and deflated with changes in depth in order to avoid &quot;squeeze&quot; on descent or uncontrolled rapid ascent due to over-buoyancy. Divers may also use the gas argon to inflate their dry suits because it has a low thermal conductivity.

===Monitoring and navigation===
Unless the maximum depth of the water is known, and is quite shallow, a diver must monitor the depth and duration of a dive to avoid decompression sickness. Traditionally this was done by using a depth gauge and a diving watch, but electronic dive computers are now in general use, as they are programmed to do real-time modelling of decompression requirements for the dive, and automatically allow for surface interval. Many can be set for the gas mixture to be used on the dive, and some can accept changes in the gas mix during the dive. Most dive computers provide a fairly conservative decompression model, and the level of conservatism may be selected by the user within limits. Most decompression computers can also be set for altitude compensation to some degree, and some will automatically take altitude into account by measuring actual atmospheric pressure and using it in the calculations.

If the dive site and dive plan require the diver to navigate, a compass may be carried, and where retracing a route is critical, as in cave or wreck penetrations, a guide line is laid from a dive reel. In less critical conditions, many divers simply navigate by landmarks and memory, a procedure also known as pilotage or natural navigation. A scuba diver should always be aware of the remaining breathing gas supply, and the duration of diving time that this will safely support, taking into account the time required to surface safely and an allowance for foreseeable contingencies. This is usually monitored by using a submersible pressure gauge on each cylinder. Some dive computers have a facility known as gas integration for remote monitoring of the pressure in one or more cylinders via signals from a wireless pressure transmitter mounted to the regulator first stage.

===Safety equipment===

Any scuba diver who will be diving below a depth from which they are competent to do a safe emergency swimming ascent in all reasonably foreseeable circumstances should ensure that they have an alternative breathing gas supply available at all times in case of a failure of the equipment they are breathing from at the time. Several systems are in common use depending on the planned dive profile. Most common, but least reliable, is relying on the dive buddy for gas sharing using a secondary second stage, commonly called an octopus regulator connected to the primary first stage. This system relies entirely on the dive buddy being immediately available and competent to provide emergency gas. More reliable systems require the diver to carry an alternative gas supply sufficient to allow the diver to safely reach a place where more breathing gas is available. For open water recreational divers this is the surface, for technical divers on a penetration dive, it may be a stage cylinder positioned at a point on the exit path, and for divers with a decompression obligation, it may be a depth at which decompression gas is acceptably safe to breathe. An emergency gas supply must be sufficiently safe to breathe at any point on the planned dive profile at which it may be needed. This equipment may be a bailout cylinder, a bailout rebreather, a travel gas cylinder, or a decompression gas cylinder. A bailout cylinder provides emergency breathing gas sufficient for a safe emergency ascent. When using a travel gas or decompression gas, the back gas (main gas supply) may be the designated emergency gas supply.

Cutting tools such as knives, line cutters or shears are often carried by divers to cut loose from entanglement in nets or lines.
A surface marker buoy (SMB) on a line held by the diver indicates the position of the diver to the surface personnel. This may be an inflatable marker deployed by the diver at the end of the dive, or a sealed buoyant float, towed for the whole dive. A surface marker also allows easy and accurate control of ascent rate and stop depth for safer decompression.

Various surface detection aids may be carried to help surface personnel spot the diver after ascent. In addition to the surface marker buoy, divers may carry mirrors, lights, strobes, whistles, flares or emergency locator beacons.

===Accessories and tools===

Divers may carry underwater photographic or video equipment, or tools for a specific application in addition to diving equipment.
Professional divers will routinely carry and use tools to facilitate their underwater work, while most recreational divers will not engage in underwater work.

==Breathing from scuba==

Breathing from scuba is mostly a straightforward matter. Under most circumstances, it differs very little from normal surface breathing. In the case of a full-face mask, the diver may usually breathe through the nose or mouth as preferred, and in the case of a mouth held demand valve, the diver will have to hold the mouthpiece between the teeth and maintain a seal around it with the lips. Over a long dive this can induce jaw fatigue, and for some people, a gag reflex. Various styles of mouthpiece are available off the shelf or as customised items, and one of them may work better if either of these problems occur. Mouthpiece retaining straps are available but not generally used.

The frequently quoted warning against holding one&#x27;s breath on scuba is a gross oversimplification of the actual hazard. The purpose of the admonition is to ensure that inexperienced divers do not accidentally hold their breath while surfacing, as the expansion of gas in the lungs could over-expand the lung air spaces and rupture the alveoli and their capillaries, allowing lung gases to get into the pulmonary return circulation, the pleura, or the interstitial areas near the injury, where it could cause dangerous medical conditions. Holding the breath at constant depth for short periods with a normal lung volume is generally harmless, providing there is sufficient ventilation on average to prevent carbon dioxide buildup, and is done as a standard practice by underwater photographers to avoid startling their subjects. Holding the breath during descent can eventually cause lung squeeze, and may allow the diver to miss warning signs of a gas supply malfunction until it is too late to remedy.

A breathing pattern of slow, deep breaths which limits gas velocity and thereby turbulent flow in the air passages will minimise the work of breathing for a given gas mixture composition and density, and respiratory minute volume. Skilled open-circuit divers make small adjustments to buoyancy by adjusting their average lung volume during the breathing cycle. This adjustment is generally in the order of a kilogram (corresponding to a litre of gas), and can be maintained for a moderate period, but it is more comfortable to adjust the volume of the buoyancy compensator over the longer term.

The practice of shallow breathing or skip breathing in an attempt to conserve breathing gas should be avoided as it is inefficient and tends to cause a carbon dioxide buildup, which can result in headaches and a reduced capacity to recover from a breathing gas supply emergency. The breathing apparatus will generally increase dead space by a small but significant amount, and cracking pressure and flow resistance in the demand valve will cause a net work of breathing increase, which will reduce the diver&#x27;s capacity for other work. Work of breathing and the effect of dead space can be minimised by breathing relatively deeply and slowly. These effects increase with depth, as density and friction increase in proportion to the increase in pressure, with the limiting case where all the diver&#x27;s available energy may be expended on simply breathing, with none left for other purposes. This would be followed by a buildup in carbon dioxide, causing an urgent feeling of a need to breathe, and if this cycle is not broken, panic and drowning are likely to follow. The use of a low-density diluent gas, typically helium, in the breathing mixture can reduce this problem, as well as diluting the narcotic effects of the other gases.

Breathing from a rebreather is much the same, except that the work of breathing is affected largely by flow resistance in the breathing loop. This is partly due to the carbon dioxide absorbent in the scrubber, and is related to the distance the gas passes through the absorbent material, and the size of the gaps between the grains, as well as the gas composition and ambient pressure. Water in the loop can greatly increase the resistance to gas flow through the scrubber. There is even less point in shallow or skip breathing on a rebreather as this does not even conserve gas, and the effect on buoyancy is negligible when the sum of loop volume and lung volume remains constant.

==Procedures==

The underwater environment is unfamiliar and hazardous, and to ensure diver safety, simple, yet necessary procedures must be followed. A certain minimum level of attention to detail and acceptance of responsibility for one&#x27;s own safety and survival are required, even at entry level. Most of the procedures are simple and straightforward, and become second nature to the experienced diver, but must be learned, and take some practice to become automatic and faultless, just like the ability to walk or talk. Most of the safety procedures are intended to reduce the risk of drowning, and many of the rest are to reduce the risk of barotrauma and decompression sickness. In some environments getting lost is a serious hazard, and specific procedures to minimise the risk are followed.

===Preparation for the dive===

The purpose of dive planning is to ensure that divers do not exceed their comfort zone or skill level, or the safe capacity of their equipment, are likely to accomplish the goal of the dive, and includes gas planning to ensure that the amount of breathing gas to be carried is sufficient to allow for any reasonably foreseeable contingencies. Before starting a dive both the diver and their buddy or the dive team, do equipment checks to ensure everything is in good working order, ready for use, and correctly fitted. Recreational divers are responsible for planning their own dives, unless in training, when the instructor is responsible. Divemasters may provide useful information and suggestions to assist the divers, but are generally not responsible for the details unless specifically employed to do so. In professional diving teams, all team members are usually expected to contribute to planning and to check the equipment they will use, but the overall responsibility for the safety of the team lies with the supervisor as the appointed on-site representative of the employer.

===Standard diving procedures===


Some procedures are common to almost all scuba dives, or are used to manage very common contingencies. These are learned at entry level and may be highly standardised to allow efficient cooperation between divers trained at different schools.
* Water entry procedures are intended to allow the diver to enter the water without injury, loss of equipment, or damage to equipment.
* Descent procedures cover how to descend at the right place, time, and rate; with the correct breathing gas available; and without losing contact with the other divers in the group.
* Equalisation of pressure in gas spaces is necessary to avoid barotraumas. The expansion or compression of enclosed gas spaces may cause discomfort or injury while diving. Critically, the lungs are susceptible to over-expansion and subsequent rupture if a diver holds their breath while ascending: during training divers are taught not to hold their breath while diving. Ear clearing is another critical equalisation procedure, usually requiring conscious intervention by the diver.
* Mask and regulator clearing may be needed to ensure the ability to see and breathe in case of flooding. This can easily happen, and while immediate correct response is necessary, the procedure is simple and routine and occasional incidental flooding is not considered an emergency.
* Buoyancy control generally requires frequent adjustment (particularly during depth changes) to ensure safe, effective, and convenient underwater mobility during the dive. This depends on the equipment in use and dive profile. Depth control during ascent is facilitated by ascending on a line with a buoy at the top. The diver can remain marginally negative and easily maintain depth by holding onto the line. A shotline or decompression buoy are commonly used for this purpose. Precise and reliable depth control is particularly valuable when the diver has a large decompression obligation, as it allows the theoretically most efficient decompression at the lowest reasonably practicable risk.
* Diver trim is largely dependent on equipment setup and weight and buoyancy distribution. Some configurations are inherently easier to trim then others, and an unstable setup will require constant effort to maintain desired trim. Trim may also be affected by weight shift due to gas consumption.
* Mobility – Most scuba diving propulsion and maneuvering is done by finning techniques, allowing the hands to be used for other purposes, but where long distances must be covered, diver propulsion vehicles can greatly increase horizontal range for the sane gas consumption.
* Buddy checks, breathing gas monitoring, and decompression status monitoring are carried out to ensure that the dive plan is followed and that members of the group are safe and available to help each other in an emergency.
* Monitoring the progress and status of the dive. To follow a plan the plan must be known, acceptable variations must be known, and the dive must be monitored sufficiently to be aware when acceptable variations will be exceeded, so that corrective action can be taken in time, or the dive can be safely terminated, or appropriate emergency actions taken. In most scuba diving, this is the equal responsibility of each diver, though a dive leader or instructor may have an additional responsibility to ensure that the divers are fulfilling their obligations, and where they have expert or local knowledge of the situation.
* Underwater communication: Divers cannot talk underwater unless they are wearing a full-face mask and electronic communications equipment, but they can communicate basic and emergency information using standard hand signals, light signals, and rope signals, and more complex messages can be written on waterproof slates.
* Ascent, decompression, and surfacing procedures are intended to ensure that dissolved inert gases are safely released, that barotraumas of ascent are avoided, and that it is safe to surface.
* Water exit procedures are intended to let the diver leave the water without injury, loss of, or damage to equipment.

=== Decompression ===
Inert gas components of the diver&#x27;s breathing gas accumulate in the tissues during exposure to elevated pressure during a dive, and must be eliminated during the ascent to avoid the formation of symptomatic bubbles in tissues where the concentration is too high for the gas to remain in solution, called decompression sickness, also known as &quot;the bends&quot;, and which can include symptoms such as itching, rash, joint pain, nausea and paralysis. The process of gas elimination is called decompression, and occurs on all scuba dives. Most recreational and professional scuba divers avoid obligatory decompression stops by following a dive profile which only requires a limited rate of ascent for decompression, but will commonly also do an optional short, shallow, decompression stop known as a safety stop to further reduce risk before surfacing. In some cases, particularly in technical diving, more complex decompression procedures are necessary. Decompression may follow a pre-planned series of ascents interrupted by stops at specific depths, or may be monitored by a personal decompression computer.

===Post-dive procedures===

These include debriefing where appropriate, and equipment maintenance, to ensure that the equipment is kept in good condition for later use. It is also considered a best practice to log each dive upon completion. This is done for several reasons: If a diver is planning on doing multiple dives in a day, they need to know what the depth and duration of previous dives were in order to calculate residual inert gas levels in preparation for the next dive. It is helpful to note what equipment was used for each dive and what the conditions were like for reference when planning another similar dive. For example, the thickness and type of wetsuit used during a dive, and if it was in fresh or salt water, will influence the amount of weight needed. Knowing this information and taking note of whether the weight used was too heavy or too light can help when planning another dive in similar conditions. In order to achieve a level of certification the diver may be required to present evidence of a specified number of logged and verified dives. Professional divers may be legally required to log specific information for every working dive. When a personal dive computer is used, it will accurately record the details of the dive profile, and this data can usually be downloaded to an electronic logbook, in which the diver can add the other details manually.

===Buddy, team or solo diving===


Buddy and team diving procedures are intended to ensure that a recreational scuba diver who gets into difficulty underwater is in the presence of a similarly equipped person who will understand the problem and can render assistance. Divers are trained to assist in those emergencies specified in the training standards for their certification, and are required to demonstrate competence in a set of prescribed buddy assistance skills. The fundamentals of buddy and team safety are focused on constant awareness of the location and status of the buddy, diver communication, sharing breathing gas with the buddy in an emergency, and the added situational perspective of another diver. There is general consensus that the presence of a buddy both willing and competent to assist can reduce the risk of certain classes of accidents, but much less agreement on how often this happens in practice.

Solo divers take responsibility for their own safety and compensate for the absence of a buddy with skill, vigilance and appropriate equipment. Like buddy or team divers, properly equipped solo divers rely on the redundancy of critical articles of dive gear which may include at least two independent supplies of breathing gas and ensuring that there is always enough available to safely terminate the dive if any one supply fails. The difference between the two practices is that this redundancy is carried and managed by the solo diver instead of a buddy. Agencies that certify for solo diving require candidates to have a relatively high level of dive experience – usually about 100 dives or more.

Since the inception of scuba, there has been an ongoing debate regarding the wisdom of solo diving with strong opinions on both sides of the issue. This debate is complicated by the fact that the line which separates a solo diver from a buddy/team diver is not always clear. For example, should a scuba instructor (who supports the buddy system) be considered a solo diver if their students do not have the knowledge or experience to assist the instructor through an unforeseen scuba emergency during a training dive? Should the buddy of an underwater photographer consider themselves as effectively diving alone since their buddy (the photographer) is giving most or all of their attention to the subject of the photograph? This debate has motivated some prominent scuba agencies such as Global Underwater Explorers (GUE) to stress that its members only dive in teams and &quot;remain aware of team member location and safety at all times.&quot; Other agencies have taken the position that divers might find themselves alone (by choice or by accident) and have created certification courses such as the &quot;SDI Solo Diver&quot; course and the &quot;PADI Self-Reliant Diver&quot; course in order to train divers to handle such possibilities.

===Navigation===
Scuba divers, by definition, carry their breathing gas supply with them during the dive, and this limited quantity must get them back to the surface safely. Pre-dive planning of appropriate gas supply for the intended dive profile lets the diver allow for sufficient breathing gas for the planned dive and contingencies. They are not connected to a surface control point by an umbilical, such as surface-supplied divers use, and the freedom of movement that this allows, also allows the diver to penetrate overhead environments in ice diving, cave diving and wreck diving to the extent that the diver may lose their way and be unable to find the way out. This problem is exacerbated by the limited breathing gas supply, which gives a limited amount of time before the diver will drown if unable to surface. The standard procedure for managing this risk is to lay a continuous guideline from open water, which allows the diver to be sure of the route to the surface. In less hazardous environments, pilotage and compass navigation may be used.

===Emergency procedures===
The most urgent underwater emergencies usually involve a compromised breathing gas supply. Divers are trained in procedures for donating and receiving breathing gas from each other in an emergency, and may carry an independent alternative air source if they do not choose to rely on a buddy. Divers may need to make an emergency ascent in the event of a loss of breathing gas which cannot be managed at depth. Controlled emergency ascents are almost always a consequence of loss of breathing gas, while uncontrolled ascents are usually the result of a buoyancy control failure. Other urgent emergencies may involve loss of control of depth and medical emergencies.

Two basic types of entrapment are significant hazards for scuba divers: Inability to navigate out of an enclosed space, and physical entrapment which prevents the diver from leaving a location. The first case can usually be avoided by staying out of enclosed spaces, and when the objective of the dive includes penetration of enclosed spaces, taking precautions such as the use of lights and guidelines, for which specialised training is provided in the standard procedures, and emergency procedures for finding a lost or broken gudeline. The most common form of physical entrapment is getting snagged on ropes, lines or nets, and the use of a cutting implement is the standard method of dealing with the problem. The risk of entanglement can be reduced by careful configuration of equipment to minimise those parts which can easily be snagged, and allow easier disentanglement. Other forms of entrapment such as getting wedged into tight spaces can often be avoided, but must otherwise be dealt with as they happen. The assistance of a buddy may be helpful where possible.

Divers may be trained in procedures that have been approved by the training agencies for recovery of an unresponsive diver to the surface, where it might be possible to administer first aid. Not all recreational divers have this training as some agencies do not include it in entry-level training. Professional divers may be required by legislation or code of practice to have a standby diver at any diving operation, who is both competent and available to attempt rescue of a distressed diver.

==Range and endurance==
Range and endurance in general are limited by the ability of the diver to manage a suitable breathing gas supply. Depth is also limited by physiological factors.

===Depth range===
The depth range applicable to scuba diving depends on the application and training. Entry-level divers are expected to limit themselves to about to . The major worldwide recreational diver certification agencies consider to be the limit for recreational diving. British and European agencies, including BSAC and SAA, recommend a maximum depth of Shallower limits are recommended for divers who are youthful, inexperienced, or who have not taken training for deep dives. Technical diving extends these depth limits through changes to training, equipment, and the gas mixes used. The maximum depth considered safe is controversial and varies among agencies and instructors, however, there is an international standard (ISO 24807) for technical rebreather training to , and programs that train divers for dives to .

Professional diving usually limits the allowed planned decompression depending on the code of practice, operational directives, or statutory restrictions. Depth limits depend on the jurisdiction, and maximum depths allowed range from to more than , depending on the breathing gas used and the availability of a decompression chamber nearby or on site. Commercial diving using scuba is generally restricted for reasons of occupational health and safety. Surface supplied diving allows better control of the operation and eliminates or significantly reduces the risks of loss of breathing gas supply and losing the diver. Scientific and media diving applications may be exempted from commercial diving constraints, based on acceptable codes of practice and a self-regulatory system.

===Endurance and lateral range===
Endurance is the duration that the breathing gas supply will last during a dive. It depends on the available gas supply, and gas consumption, which depends on fitness, exertion, and for open circuit scuba, on depth. The distance that can be travelled during this time depends on propulsion efficiency, which depends on whether the diver is swimming under their own power or using a diver propulsion vehicle. Finning efficiency depends on fitness, fin type, finning style and hydrodynamic drag, which depends on equipment type and configuration, and diver trim. In general terms scuba divers are slow and inefficient at best, but highly maneuverable. Use of a diver propulsion vehicle can extend the range capability by a large margin, depending on the power and endurance of the DPV and streamlining of the diver.

==Applications==

Scuba diving may be performed for a number of reasons, both personal and professional. 

===Recreational scuba===
Recreational diving is done purely for enjoyment and has a number of technical disciplines to increase interest underwater, such as cave diving, wreck diving, ice diving and deep diving. Underwater tourism is mostly done on scuba and the associated tour guiding must follow suit. There are divers who work, full or part-time, in the recreational diving community as instructors, assistant instructors, divemasters and dive guides. In some jurisdictions, the professional nature, with particular reference to responsibility for health and safety of the clients, of recreational diver instruction, dive leadership for reward and dive guiding is recognised and regulated by national legislation.

In many countries recreational diving is either not mentioned at all in laws and regulations, or specifically excluded from regulations covering occupational diving. In others, only diver training and dive-leading activities where the diver is either employed or takes a leadership position where they are responsible for the safety of others is covered by legislation. At the other extreme, countries such as Israel have statutory law covering all recreational diving activities.

The reasons to dive for recreational purposes are many and varied, and many divers will go through stages when their personal reasons for diving change, as the initial novelty of the alien environment becomes familiar and skills develop to the point where the diver is able to pay more attention to the surroundings. They may progress to developing skills needed for more challenging environments, or add compatible activities like photography, exploration, and recording aspects of the environment. Recreational diving in reasonably good conditions which are comfortably managed by the diver can produce health benefits of mood improvement.

===Professional scuba===

Divers may be employed professionally to perform tasks underwater. Some of these tasks are suitable for scuba. The choice between scuba and surface-supplied diving equipment is based on both legal and logistical constraints. Where the diver requires mobility and a large range of movement, scuba is usually the choice if safety and legal constraints allow. Higher risk work, particularly in commercial diving, may be restricted to surface-supplied equipment by legislation and codes of practice.

Underwater maintenance and research in large aquariums and fish farms, and harvesting of marine biological resources such as fish, abalones, crabs, lobsters, scallops, and sea crayfish may be done on scuba. Boat and ship underwater hull inspection, cleaning and some aspects of maintenance (ships husbandry) may be done on scuba by commercial divers and boat owners or crew.

Other specialist areas of scuba diving include military diving, with a long history of military frogmen in various roles. Their roles include direct combat, infiltration behind enemy lines, placing mines or using a manned torpedo, bomb disposal or engineering operations. In civilian operations, many police forces operate police diving teams to perform &quot;search and recovery&quot; or &quot;search and rescue&quot; operations and to assist with the detection of crime which may involve bodies of water. In some cases diver rescue teams may also be part of a fire department, paramedical service or lifeguard unit, and may be classed as public safety diving.

There are also professional divers involved with underwater environments, such as underwater photographers or underwater videographers, who document the underwater world, or scientific diving, including marine biology, geology, hydrology, oceanography and underwater archaeology. This work is normally done on scuba as it provides the necessary mobility. Rebreathers may be used when the noise of open-circuit would alarm the subjects or the bubbles could interfere with the images. Scientific diving under the OSHA (US) exemption has been defined as being diving work done by persons with, and using, scientific expertise to observe, or gather data on, natural phenomena or systems to generate non-proprietary information, data, knowledge or other products as a necessary part of a scientific, research or educational activity, following the direction of a diving safety manual and a diving control safety board.

==Safety==

The safety of underwater diving depends on four factors: the environment, the equipment, behaviour of the individual diver and performance of the dive team. The underwater environment can impose severe physical and psychological stress on a diver, and is mostly beyond the diver&#x27;s control. Scuba equipment allows the diver to operate underwater for limited periods, and the reliable function of some of the equipment is critical to even short-term survival. Other equipment allows the diver to operate in relative comfort and efficiency. The performance of the individual diver depends on learned skills, many of which are not intuitive, and the performance of the team depends on competence, communication and common goals.

There is a large range of hazards to which the diver may be exposed. These each have associated consequences and risks, which should be taken into account during dive planning. Where risks are marginally acceptable it may be possible to mitigate the consequences by setting contingency and emergency plans in place, so that injury or damage can be minimised where reasonably practicable. The acceptable level of risk varies depending on legislation, codes of practice and personal choice, with recreational divers having a greater freedom of choice.

===Hazards===


Divers operate in an environment for which the human body is not well suited. They face special physical and health risks when they go underwater or use high pressure breathing gas. The consequences of diving incidents range from merely annoying to rapidly fatal, and the result often depends on the equipment, skill, response and fitness of the diver and diving team. The hazards include the aquatic environment, the use of breathing equipment in an underwater environment, exposure to a pressurised environment and pressure changes, particularly pressure changes during descent and ascent, and breathing gases at high ambient pressure. Diving equipment other than breathing apparatus is usually reliable, but has been known to fail, and loss of buoyancy control or thermal protection can be a major burden which may lead to more serious problems. There are also hazards of the specific diving environment, and hazards related to access to and egress from the water, which vary from place to place, and may also vary with time and tide. Hazards inherent in the diver include pre-existing physiological and psychological conditions and the personal behaviour and competence of the individual. For those pursuing other activities while diving, there are additional hazards of task loading, of the dive task and of special equipment associated with the task.

The presence of a combination of several hazards simultaneously is common in diving, and the effect is generally increased risk to the diver. Many diving fatalities are the result of a cascade of incidents overwhelming the diver, who should be able to manage any single reasonably foreseeable incident. Although there are many dangers in scuba diving, divers can decrease the risks through effective responses and appropriate equipment. The requisite skills are acquired by education and training, and honed by practice. Entry level certification programmes highlight diving physiology, safe diving practices, and diving hazards, but do not provide the diver with sufficient practice to become truly adept.

Scuba diving in relatively hazardous environments such as caves and wrecks, areas of strong water movement, relatively great depths, with decompression obligations, with equipment that has more complex failure modes, and with gases that are not safe to breathe at all depths of the dive requires specialised safety and emergency procedures tailored to the specific hazards, and often specialised equipment. These conditions are generally associated with technical diving.

===Risk===

The risk of dying during recreational, scientific or commercial diving is small, and on scuba, deaths are usually associated with poor gas management, poor buoyancy control, emergency ascent, equipment misuse or failure, entrapment and entanglement, rough water conditions and pre-existing health problems. Some fatalities are inevitable and caused by unforeseeable situations escalating out of control, but the majority of scuba diving fatalities can be attributed to human error on the part of the victim. Equipment failure is rare in well-maintained open-circuit scuba that has been set up and tested correctly before the dive. Fatality rates are comparable with jogging (13 deaths per 100,000 persons per year) and are within the range where reduction is desirable by Health and Safety Executive (HSE) criteria, The most common injuries and causes of death were drowning or asphyxia due to inhalation of water, air embolism and cardiac events. The risk of cardiac arrest is greater for older divers, and greater for men than women, although the risks are equal by age 65.

According to death certificates, over 80% of the deaths were ultimately attributed to drowning, but other factors usually combined to incapacitate the diver in a sequence of events culminating in drowning, which is more a consequence of the medium in which the accidents occurred than the actual accident. Scuba divers should not drown unless there are other contributory factors as they carry a supply of breathing gas and equipment designed to provide the gas on demand. Drowning occurs as a consequence of preceding problems such as unmanageable stress, cardiac disease, pulmonary barotrauma, unconsciousness from any cause, water aspiration, trauma, environmental hazards, equipment difficulties, inappropriate response to an emergency or failure to manage the gas supply, and often obscures the real cause of death. Air embolism is also frequently cited as a cause of death, and it, too is the consequence of other factors leading to an uncontrolled and badly managed ascent, possibly aggravated by pre-existing medical conditions. About a quarter of diving fatalities are associated with cardiac events, mostly in older divers. There is a fairly large body of data on diving fatalities, but in many cases the data is poor due to the standard of investigation and reporting, or withholding information for fear of litigation or privacy concerns. This hinders research that could improve diver safety. Plausible contributing factors that have been suggested but not yet empirically validated include inexperience, infrequent diving, inadequate supervision, insufficient pre-dive briefings, buddy separation and dive conditions beyond the diver&#x27;s training, experience or physical capacity.

Decompression sickness and arterial gas embolism in recreational diving have been associated with specific demographic, environmental, and diving behavioural factors. A statistical study published in 2005 tested potential risk factors: age, asthma, body mass index, gender, smoking, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, previous decompression illness, years since certification, number of dives in the previous year, number of consecutive diving days, number of dives in a repetitive series, depth of the previous dive, use of nitrox as breathing gas, and use of a dry suit. No significant associations with risk of decompression sickness or arterial gas embolism were found for asthma, body mass index, cardiovascular disease, diabetes or smoking. Greater dive depth, previous decompression illness, number of consecutive days diving, and male sex were associated with higher risk for decompression sickness and arterial gas embolism. The use of dry suits and nitrox breathing gas, greater frequency of diving in the previous year, greater age, and more years since certification were associated with lower risk, possibly as indicators of more extensive training and experience.

Risk management has four major aspects besides equipment and training: Risk assessment, emergency planning, insurance cover, and constantly monitoring the progress of the dive and updating the perceived risk, and when appropriate, adapting the dive plan to suit.
The risk assessment for a dive is primarily a planning activity, and may range in formality from a part of the pre-dive buddy check for recreational divers, to a safety file with professional risk assessment and detailed emergency plans for professional diving projects. Some form of pre-dive briefing is customary with organised recreational dives, and this generally includes a recitation by the divemaster of the known and predicted hazards, the risk associated with the significant ones, and the procedures to be followed in case of the reasonably foreseeable emergencies associated with them. Insurance cover for diving accidents may not be included in standard policies. There are a few organisations that focus specifically on diver safety and insurance cover, such as the international Divers Alert Network

===Fitness to dive===

Fitness to dive (more specifically medical fitness to dive) refers to the medical and physical suitability of a person] to function safely in an underwater environment using diving equipment and related procedures. Depending on the circumstances, it may be established with a signed statement by the diver that they do not have any of the listed disqualifying conditions, or may involve a detailed medical examination by a physician registered as a medical examiner of divers following a procedural checklist. A legal document of fitness to dive issued by the medical examiner may be necessary. Psychological factors can also affect fitness to dive, particularly where they affect response to emergencies, or risk-taking behavior, and the use of medical and recreational drugs can influence fitness to dive, both for physiological and behavioral reasons. A person unfit to dive is considered to be at higher risk of injury or death in a diving accident.

====Medications commonly used by scuba divers====

There are no specific studies that give objective values for the effects and risks of most medications if used while diving, and their interactions with the physiological effects of diving. Any advice given by a medical practitioner is based on educated (to a greater or lesser extent), but unproven assumption, and each case is best evaluated by an expert.
Medication types that are routinely used by many divers include:
*For prevention of motion sickness
*Decongestants for keeping the eustachian tubes and sinuses open
*Malaria prophylaxis (regional)
*Anti-inflammatories and analgesics
*Cardiovascular and hypertension medication
*Antacids and gastric acid suppression medication
*Contraceptives

===Emergencies===

A scuba diving emergency is an incident while scuba diving, in which there is a high probability of death or severe injury if the problem is not resolved quickly. A diving emergency may be related to life-support, decompression stress and barotraume, incapacitation or inability to cope, or an acute medical problem.

====Life support====

The most urgent scuba emergency is running out of breathing gas under water, often referred to as an out-of-air incident. It is a true emergency, as without access to breathing gas the diver will die within a few minutes. Other interruptions to the breathing gas supply, such as regulator malfunctions, dislodging of the regulator or full-face mask, rolling off of the cylinder valve, may become emergencies if not managed promptly and effectively, though for a competent diver most of these should be inconveniences rather than emergencies if there are no compounding factors. Various situations can occur which if not managed in time will become out of gas emergencies. Loss of the continuous guideline in an overhead environment when out of sight of the exit will eventually lead to an out of gas emergency, so it is always a real emergency, but the urgency depends on when it happens. The urgency of entanglement or entrapment emergencies depends on the specific circumstances. If the entrapment is not rectified soon enough, it will lead to an out of gas emergency or a decompression emergency. This is a class of emergency where a competent buddy may well be invaluable, as they may be able to disentangle or cut the diver free more easily due to better access to, and view of, the entangling materials.

Most scuba diving, particularly recreational scuba, uses a breathing gas supply mouthpiece that is gripped by the diver&#x27;s teeth, and which can be dislodged relatively easily by impact. This is generally easily rectified unless the diver is incapacitated, and the associated skills are part of entry-level training. The problem becomes severe and immediately life-threatening if the diver loses both consciousness and the mouthpiece. Rebreather mouthpieces that are open when out of the mouth may let in water which can flood the loop, making them unable to deliver breathing gas, and will lose buoyancy as the gas escapes, thus putting the diver in a situation of two simultaneous life-threatening problems. Skills to manage this situation are a necessary part of training for the specific configuration. Full-face masks reduce these risks and are generally preferred for professional scuba diving, but can make emergency gas sharing difficult, and are less popular with recreational divers who often rely on gas sharing with a buddy as their breathing gas redundancy option.

====Decompression stress and barotrauma====

A decompression emergency occurs when the diver cannot safely complete necessary decompression while ascending. This could be due to insufficient breathing gas, inability to maintain depth at stops, or a more pressing need to surface. The urgency and severity of the emergency depends on the level of decompression stress and the risk of symptomatic decompression developing. Symptomatic decompression illness may develop during or after ascent. The urgency depends on the amount of compromised decompression, and on symptoms and when they occur. A decompression emergency is likely to develop into a medical emergency.

Irretrievable loss of buoyancy control can be an emergency depending on when it occurs, whether it is a loss of buoyancy (eg BC failure, catastrophic dry suit flood), or an excess of buoyancy (loss of weights, insufficient weighting at end of deco dive, dry suit inversion with complications), whether there is enough breathing gas in reserve, and whether there is a decompression obligation. Insufficient weighting at the end of a dive when no weights have been lost is usually an indication of inadequate training and failure of the diver to take responsibility for their own safety, and is usually caused by the diver not adequately checking that they are correctly weighted for the dive

====Incapacittion====

Any loss of consciousness underwater is an emergency that requires the immediate intervention of a rescuer to prevent drowning. Potential causes include: CNS oxygen toxicity, Hypoxia, a contaminated breathing gas supply, carbon dioxide toxicity due to rebreather scrubber breakthrough, or overwhelming work of breathing.

A dry suit flooding in frigid water presents combined risks from buoyancy loss and hypothermia. This is not as urgent as breathing emergencies, but can be a definite risk to life. Similarly, diver exhaustion may prevent a diver from taking necessary action to get to a place of safety, such as returning to the exit point, getting out of the water, or keeping their airway secure.

Panic or nitrogen narcosis may lead to inappropriate actions which may trigger another emergency condition, or cause inappropriate response to a contingency, causing it to deteriorate to an emergency.

====Medical conditions====

Diving specific medical emergencies include barotrauma, decompression sickness, immersion pulmonary edema, arterial gas embolism, carbon monoxide poisoning, carbon dioxide toxicity, oxygen toxicity and nitrogen narcosis. Cardiovascular emergency, major trauma, envenomation and other general medical emergencies are usually not practicable to treat in the water, so it is urgent for the diver to surface and get appropriate first aid as soon as possible without causing more serious injury through haste.

====Buddy separation====

Some organisations class buddy separation as an emergency, but for competent and adequately equipped divers it is more of an inconvenience, and for solo divers there is no buddy to be separated from. The urgency of buddy separation depends on circumstances, but is usually of low urgency provided both divers are competent and properly equipped, and neither is experiencing another emergency requiring the presence of a buddy. Buddy separation may represent a critical loss of equipment redundancy, but no immediate danger to life and health in most situations.

==Training and certification==
Scuba training is normally provided by a qualified diving instructor who is a member of one or more diver certification agencies or is registered with a government agency. Basic diver training entails the learning of knowledge and skills required for the safe conduct of activities in an underwater environment, and includes procedures and skills for the use of diving equipment, safety, emergency self-help and rescue procedures, dive planning, and use of dive tables or a personal dive computer.

Scuba skills which an entry-level diver will normally learn include:
* Preparing and dressing in the diving suit
* Assembly and pre-dive testing of the scuba set.
* Entries and exits between the water and the shore or boat.
* Breathing from the demand valve
* Recovering and clearing the demand valve.
* Clearing water from the mask, and replacing a dislodged mask.
* Buoyancy control using weights and buoyancy compensator, including achieving positive, negative and neutral buoyancy at the surface and in midwater. Selection of appropriate weights.
* Finning techniques, underwater mobility and manoeuvering.
* Making safe and controlled descents and ascents.
* Equalisation of the ears and other air spaces.
* Assisting another diver by providing air from one&#x27;s own supply, and receiving air supplied by another diver.
* How to return to the surface without injury in the event of a breathing gas supply interruption.
* Use of emergency gas supply systems (professional divers).
* Diving hand signals used to communicate underwater. Professional divers will also learn other methods of communication.
* Dive management skills such as monitoring depth and time and the breathing gas supply.
* Buddy diving procedures, including response to buddy separation underwater.
* Basic dive planning regarding choice of entry and exit points, planned maximum depth and time to remain within no-decompression limits.
* Limited recognition of hazards, emergency procedures, and medical evacuation may be included. Professional divers will be trained in basic first aid.
* Swimming in currents and wave surge
* Remove and refit certain items of equipment while in or under the water

Some knowledge of physiology and the physics of diving is considered necessary by most diver certification agencies, as the diving environment is alien and relatively hostile to humans. The physics and physiology knowledge required is fairly basic, and helps the diver to understand the effects of the diving environment so that informed acceptance of the associated risks is possible. The physics mostly relates to gases under pressure, buoyancy, heat loss, and optics underwater. The physiology relates the physics to the effects on the human body, to provide a basic understanding of the causes and risks of barotrauma, decompression sickness, gas toxicity, hypothermia, drowning and sensory variations. More comprehensive training often involves first aid and rescue skills, skills related to a wider range of diving equipment, and underwater work skills.

===Recreational===


Recreational diver training is the process of developing knowledge and understanding of the basic principles, and the skills and procedures for the use of scuba equipment so that the diver is able to dive for recreational purposes with acceptable risk using the type of equipment and in similar conditions to those experienced during training. Recreational (including technical) scuba diving does not have a centralised certifying or regulatory agency and is mostly self-regulated. There are, however, several international organisations of varying size and market share that train and certify divers, dive leaders, and dive instructors, and many diving related sales and rental outlets require proof of diver certification from one of these organisations prior to selling or renting certain diving products or services.

Not only is the underwater environment hazardous but the diving equipment itself can be dangerous. There are problems that divers must learn to avoid and manage when they do occur. Divers need repeated practice and a gradual increase in the challenge to develop and internalise the skills needed to control the equipment, to respond effectively if they encounter difficulties, and to build confidence in their equipment and themselves. Diver practical training starts with simple but essential procedures and builds on them until complex procedures can be managed effectively. This may be broken up into several short training programmes, with certification issued for each stage, or combined into a few more substantial programmes with certification issued when all the skills have been mastered.

Many organizations exist, throughout the world, offering diver training leading to certification: the issuing of &quot;diving certification cards,&quot; also known as a &quot;C-cards,&quot; or qualification cards. This diving certification model originated at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in 1952 after two divers died while using university-owned equipment and the SIO instituted a system where a card was issued after training as evidence of competence. Diving instructors affiliated to a diving certification agency may work independently or through a university, a dive club, a dive school or a dive shop. They will offer courses that should meet, or exceed, the standards of the certification organization that will certify the divers attending the course. Certification of the diver is done by the certification organisation on application by the registered instructor.

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has approved several ISO recreational diving standards that may be implemented worldwide, and some of the standards developed by the World Recreational Scuba Training Council and Rebreather Training Council are consistent with the applicable ISO Standards, as are equivalent standards published by the Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques and the European Underwater Federation

The initial open water training for a person who is medically fit to dive and a reasonably competent swimmer is relatively short. Many dive shops in popular holiday locations offer courses intended to teach a novice to dive in a few days, which can be combined with diving on the vacation. Other instructors and dive schools will provide more thorough training, which generally takes longer. Dive operators, dive shops, and cylinder filling stations may refuse to allow uncertified people to dive with them, hire diving equipment or have their diving cylinders filled. This may be an agency standard, company policy, or specified by legislation.

===Professional===

It is fairly common for a national standard for commercial diver training and registration to apply within a country. These standards may be set by national government departments and empowered by national legislation, for example, in the case of the United Kingdom, where the standards are set by the Health and Safety Executive, and South Africa where they are published by the Department of Labour. Many national training standards and the associated diver registrations are recognised internationally among the countries which are members of the International Diving Regulators and Certifiers Forum (IDRCF). A similar arrangement exists for state-legislated standards, as in the case of Canada and Australia. Registration of professional divers trained to these standards may be directly administered by government, as in the case of South Africa, where diver registration is done by the Department of Employment and Labour, or by an approved external agent, as in the case of the Australian Diver Accreditation Scheme (ADAS)

The following countries and organisations are members of the European Diving Technology Committee, which publishes minimum standards for commercial diver training and competence accepted by these and some other countries through membership of the IDRCF and IDSA: Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Romania, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Slovak republic, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom, International Marine Contractors Association (IMCA), International Association of Oil and Gas Producers (IOGP), International Transport Workers&#x27; Federation (ITF), International Diving Schools Association (IDSA), European Underwater Federation, and International Diving Regulators and Certifiers Forum (IDRCF). These standards include &quot;Commercial SCUBA Diver&quot;.

An example of a widely accepted training standard – EDTC 2017 &quot;Commercial SCUBA Diver&quot; – requires the professional scuba diver to be certified as medically fit to dive, and competent in skills covering the scope of:
* Administrative procedures relating to statutory requirements, employment conditions, health and safety at the workplace, and the basic theoretical grounding in physics, physiology and medicine that are relevant to their work as a diver.
* The skills required for routine diving operations, including working as part of the diving team, planning of diving operations, and diving in open water, exposed to the normal hazards of the diving environment, decompression procedures, serving as attendant to another diver, communications and the safe use of the tools appropriate to the work.
* The skills in emergency procedures for management of reasonably foreseeable emergencies, including standby diver skills for diver assistance and rescue, management of emergencies unaided where appropriate, and team procedures for handling emergencies.
* Preparation of diving and task-related equipment for use
* Provision of first aid and basic life support procedures in a diving emergency, and assistance, under supervision, in the treatment of diving disorders
* Competence to assist under supervision with chamber operations, including acting as inside attendant to an afflicted diver.

International Diving Schools Association (IDSA) provides a table of equivalence of various national commercial diver training standards.

Military scuba training is usually provided by the armed force&#x27;s internal diver training facilities, to their specific requirements and standards, and generally involves basic scuba training, specific training related to the equipment used by the unit, and associated skills related to the particular unit. The general scope of requirements is similar to that for commercial divers, though standards of fitness and assessment may differ considerably.

Canadian Association for Underwater Science (CAUS), the CMAS Scientific Committee, and the American Academy of Underwater Sciences (AAUS), issue scientific scuba diving certifications. AAUS certifications can only be achieved by taking an AAUS course administered by a AAUS organizational member. Training for the AAUS scientific diving certification includes a relatively high level of training and proficiency in diving and the use of scientific practices and operations for research and education. In some countries scientific diving is legally considered commercial diving and the training, certification and registration are identical.

==Records==
The current (2017) scuba depth record is held by Ahmed Gabr of Egypt who reached a depth of in the Red Sea in 2014, however this record is under investigation due to evidence presented in 2020 suggesting it was faked. In which case the record would revert to set by Nuno Gomes in 2005.

The record for cave penetration (horizontal distance from a known free surface) is held by Jon Bernot and Charlie Roberson of Gainesville, Florida, with a distance of .

Jarrod Jablonski and Casey McKinlay completed a traverse from Turner Sink to Wakulla Springs, on 15 December 2007, covering a distance of nearly . This traverse took approximately 7 hours, followed by 14 hours of decompression, and set the record as the longest cave diving traverse.

The current record for the longest continuous submergence using SCUBA gear was set by Mike Stevens of Birmingham, England at the National Exhibition Centre, Birmingham, during the annual National Boat, Caravan and Leisure Show between 14 February and 23 February 1986. He was continuously submerged for 212.5 hours. The record was ratified by the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot;.

<doc id="1266482" wikidata="Q2707322" url="?curid=1266482" title="Laser Radial">
<text>The Laser Radial or ILCA 6 is a popular one-design class of small sailing dinghy, originally built by Laser Performance and World sailing approved manufactures. It is a singlehanded boat, meaning that it is sailed by one person. The Laser Radial is a variant of the Laser Standard, with shorter mast and reduced sail area, allowing light sailors to sail in heavy winds. It raced by women, U18 men and by male masters. The International Class is recognised by World Sailing. The class is referred to as the &quot;Radial&quot; due to the Radial technique used to create the sail with the panels stemming from the clew (far bottom corner) and reaching up the sail to the luff (the front edge). The boat is also often called the ILCA 6 due to Laser sailboats loosing the rights to manufacturer it after selling them to the class association.

==Events==

===Olympics===
The Laser Radial was chosen for singlehanded women discipline at the Summer Olympic starting with the 2008 Olympic Games in Qingdao, China and is still being raced at the Olympics.

<text>Florence Donald Shapiro (born May 2, 1948) is an American politician from Texas. Her political career lasted over 30 years and coincided with Plano&#x27;s growth from a bedroom community of 17,000 to a city of almost 300,000 residents. After moving to Plano in 1972, she served on the Plano City Council from 1979 to 1990 and served as the city&#x27;s first female and Jewish elected mayor from 1990 to 1992.

As a Republican, Shapiro served in the Texas Senate from 1993 to 2013, representing District 2 from 1993 to 1995 and District 8 from 1995 until her retirement in 2013. Her constituency was centered in Collin County in the Dallas–Fort Worth Metroplex, especially the city of Plano.

In the Texas Senate, Shapiro chaired the State Affairs Committee and the chamber&#x27;s Education Committee from 2003 to 2013.

==Early life and education==
A first-generation American, Shapiro was born to German-born Martin and Ann Donald, both Holocaust survivors, in New York City on May 2, 1948. Shapiro&#x27;s mother was pregnant with her on the ship passage from England to New York City.

After a decade in New York City, the family moved to Dallas, Texas in 1958, and Shapiro attended and graduated from Hillcrest High School. After high school, Shapiro matriculated to The University of Texas at Austin, and was the first in her family to attend college. At UT, she met her husband Howard. and earned a B.S. in secondary education in 1970.

Shapiro began her professional career as a public school English and speech teacher at Richardson High School in Richardson, Texas for two years. She and her husband moved from Richardson to Plano in 1972, when Plano&#x27;s population was 17,500. In the 1980s, Shapiro founded and operated Shapiro &amp; Company, an advertising, public relations and events firm for 10 years before closing the company due to scheduling demands from her responsibilities in the Texas Senate.

==Political career==
===Local politics (1979-1992)===
Shapiro quit her job as a teacher in 1972 in order to have a baby and turned to community involvement. After several years as an active volunteer in Plano, Shapiro was encouraged to run for the &quot;woman&#x27;s seat&quot; on the Plano City Council. She won her first election in 1979 by 39 votes and was subsequently elected to serve six terms from 1979 to 1990. During her entire tenure, Shapiro was the only woman on the council. As a council member, Shapiro served as the president of the North Central Texas Council of Governments in 1984 and as President of the Texas Municipal League.

In 1990, Shapiro ran unopposed and was subsequently elected the first female and first Jewish Mayor of Plano. She served one term from 1990 to 1992.

===Texas Senate (1993-2013)===

At the Cotton Bowl parade in 1991, Shapiro&#x27;s friend Kay Bailey Hutchison, then the Texas State Treasurer, suggested that Shapiro run for the Texas Senate. In 1992, she ran for District 2, which included Collin County and counties in East Texas. Her campaign manager was Karl Rove, who would later work as a top aide to Governor George W. Bush (who would go on to be elected President in 2000). Shapiro was the top vote-getter in the Republican primary against Don Kent and former Plano mayor Jack Harvard, then defeated Kent by 1 percentage point in a hotly-contested run-off election, during which vandals defaced her campaign signs with swastikas due to Shapiro&#x27;s Jewish faith.

In the general election, Shapiro faced 13-year Democratic incumbent Ted Lyon. The race was so vitriolic that the &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot; ran an editorial titled &quot;Voters Didn&#x27;t Deserve This,&quot; calling for a lowering of temperatures. Shapiro won by 13 points. After the 1992 election, Shapiro rarely faced serious competition.

In the Texas Senate, Shapiro earned attention for authoring &quot;Ashley&#x27;s Laws&quot; in 1995 that increased penalties for sex offenders and improved tracking of sex offenders released from prison. In 1993, 7-year-old Ashley Estell was kidnapped, from Carpenter Park in Plano, assaulted, and murdered. &quot;Ashley&#x27;s Laws&quot; consisted on 12 bills that required, among other things, police departments to publicize the location of sex offenders after their release and require notification of schools of their presence in the area. Shapiro&#x27;s work earned her the Texas Association Against Sexual Assault&#x27;s &quot;Champion for Social Change Award&quot;. and the Children&#x27;s Advocacy Centers of Texas&#x27;s &quot;Legislator of the Year Award&quot; in 2008.

Shapiro was also involved in efforts to advocate for human rights and Holocaust education. President George W. Bush appointed Shapiro to the Honorary Delegation to Jerusalem for the celebration of the 60th anniversary of the State of Israel in May 2008. In 2009, Governor Rick Perry signed Senate Bill 482 co-authored by Shapiro and Rodney Ellis that established an 18-member Texas Holocaust and Genocide Commission, charged with improving Holocaust and genocide education and organizing memorial events in Texas.

====Governor for a Day====
In January 2005, she was elected President pro tempore of the State Senate, becoming second in the gubernatorial line of succession, behind the Lieutenant Governor of Texas. She was the first senator from Collin County to serve in that position in more than forty years. When both Governor Rick Perry and Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst were out of the state on official business on April 9, 2005, Shapiro served as the Governor for a day, the sixth woman in Texas history to do so.

===U.S. Senate speculation (2008-2011)===
====Potential special election====
In October 2007, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchinson announced that she would potentially vacate her seat in the U.S. Senate before the end of her term in 2012 to challenge incumbent Governor of Texas Rick Perry in the Republican primary of the 2010 Texas gubernatorial election. On July 15, 2008, Shapiro announced the formation of an exploratory committee for Hutchinson&#x27;s seat, chaired by her friend and former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach. Shapiro was the first candidate to formally announce an exploratory committee, but local media expected additional candidates to jump into the fray, such as U.S. Congressmen Pete Sessions and Kay Granger, former Texas Secretary of State Roger Williams, and Texas Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst.

After forming the committee, Shapiro began heavy fundraising and had raised more money than any other declared candidate by the end of 2008. Shapiro raised $226,000 in the fourth quarter of 2008 and ended the year with $373,556 in her campaign war chest.

Hutchison formally announced her gubernatorial campaign on August 17, 2009. However, Hutchison did not resign from her Senate seat, announcing on November 13, that she would remain in the Senate during the campaign.

====2012 election====
Hutchinson subsequently announced on January 13, 2011, that she would not run for re-election in 2012 and would retire after 18 years in the U.S. Senate The next day, Shapiro decided against running to replace Hutchinson in the 2012 United States Senate election in Texas, ultimately won by Texas solicitor general Ted Cruz. Shapiro, who by then had raised approximately $1 million, formally withdrew her candidacy on March 31 and announced that she would refund her donors.

===Retirement===
On September 19, 2011, Shapiro announced that she would not stand for reelection to the Texas Senate. Her seat was ultimately won by State Representative Ken Paxton, who would later serve as the Texas Attorney General.

==Post-political career==
After retiring from the Texas Senate, Shapiro worked for an education company. In 2013, Plano&#x27;s city council chambers were renamed the Senator Florence Shapiro Council Chambers in her honor.

==Personal life==
Shapiro lives in Plano, Texas with her husband Howard. They have three children and 12 grandchildren.

<doc id="1266489" wikidata="Q1196110" url="?curid=1266489" title="The Pagemaster">
<text>The Pagemaster is a 1994 American live-action/animated fantasy adventure film starring Macaulay Culkin, Christopher Lloyd, Whoopi Goldberg, Patrick Stewart, Leonard Nimoy, Frank Welker, Ed Begley Jr., and Mel Harris. The film was produced by Turner Pictures and Hanna-Barbera and released by 20th Century Fox on November 23, 1994. Culkin stars as a timid boy who uses statistics as an excuse to avoid anything he finds uncomfortable in life. But after reluctantly undertaking an errand for his father, he gets caught in a storm, which forces him to seek refuge in a library. He then finds himself trapped inside the library, where he must battle his way through literary classics come to life if he is to find his way home.

The film was written for the screen by David Casci, based on a six-page pitch by writer Charles Pogue entitled &quot;Library Days&quot;, presented to Casci by producer David Kirschner. The film was directed by Joe Johnston (live-action) and Pixote Hunt and Glenn Chaika (animation), and produced by David Kirschner and Paul Gertz. The film received generally negative reviews from critics and grossed $13.7 million from a budget of $34 million. The film&#x27;s poor box office performance, along with the 1997 film &quot;Cats Don&#x27;t Dance&quot; (which was in production at the time &quot;The Pagemaster&quot; was released), set back other animated films for the animation studio, Turner Feature Animation.

== Plot ==
Pessimistic 10-year-old Richard Tyler lives life based on statistics and fears everything. His exasperated parents have tried multiple ways to build up his courage, with little success. Richard is sent by his father to buy a bag of nails for building a treehouse. However, Richard gets caught in a harsh thunderstorm and takes shelter in a library. Despite Richard&#x27;s protests, he meets Mr. Dewey, an eccentric librarian/custodian who insists that he needs a special book and gives him a library card. Searching for a phone, Richard finds a large rotunda painted with many famous literary characters. He slips on water dripping from his coat and falls, knocking himself out. Richard awakens to find the rotunda art melting, which washes over him and the library, turning them into illustrations.

He is met by the Pagemaster, the mythical Keeper of Books and Guardian of the Written Word. Richard asks for directions to the exit, so the Pagemaster sends him through the fiction section toward the green neon exit sign. Along the way, Richard befriends three anthropomorphic books: Adventure, a swashbuckling pirate-like book; Fantasy, a sassy but caring fairy-tale book; and Horror, a fearful &quot;Hunchbook&quot; with a misshapen spine. The three agree to help Richard if he checks them out using his new library card. Together, the quartet encounters classic fictional characters. They meet Dr. Jekyll who turns into Mr. Hyde, driving them to the open waters of the Land of Adventure. However, the group is separated after Moby-Dick attacks, following the whale&#x27;s battle with Captain Ahab. Richard and Adventure are shipwrecked and picked up by the &quot;Hispaniola&quot;, captained by Long John Silver. The pirates go to Treasure Island, but find no treasure except for one gold coin, nearly causing a mutiny between the captain and the crew. Fantasy and Horror return and defeat the pirates. Silver attempts to convince Richard to leave with him but surrenders when Richard threatens him with a sword.

In the fantasy section, Richard sees the exit sign atop a mountain. However, Adventure&#x27;s bumbling awakens a dormant dragon. Richard tries to fight the dragon with a sword and shield, but the dragon swallows him. Richard finds books in the dragon&#x27;s stomach and uses a beanstalk from &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot; to escape the dragon&#x27;s mouth. He and the books climb the beanstalk to reach the exit. They enter a large dark room where the Pagemaster awaits them. Richard accuses the Pagemaster of causing the horrors that he suffered (some of which could have cost him his life). Still, the Pagemaster reveals the journey was intended to make Richard face his fears. Dr. Jekyll, Captain Ahab, Long John Silver, and the dragon reappear in a magical twister and congratulate him. The Pagemaster swoops Richard and the books into the twister, returning them to the real world.

Richard awakens, finding Adventure, Fantasy, and Horror lying next to him as real books. Mr. Dewey finds him, and even though the library policy only allows a person to check out 2 books at a time, he lets him check out all 3 books &quot;just this once&quot;.

Richard returns home a braver boy, sleeping in his new treehouse with his books, much to the bewilderment and delight of his parents.

== Cast ==
=== Live-action ===
* Macaulay Culkin as Richard Tyler, a young 10-year-old boy who seems to have a fear of everything and runs his life based on safety statistics. Culkin is the only actor in the film to portray his character in both live-action and animation.
* Christopher Lloyd as Mr. Dewey, the unconventional librarian and caretaker of a seemingly abandoned library.
* Ed Begley Jr. and Mel Harris as Alan and Claire Tyler, Richard&#x27;s supportive parents. Alan considers himself a bad father due to his continuous failed attempts to help Richard get over his fears.
* Jessica Kirschner, Brandon S. McKay, Alexis Kirschner, Guy Mansker, and Stephen Sheehan as the neighborhood kids. They make fun of Richard, who ignores them.

=== Voice cast ===
* Christopher Lloyd as the Pagemaster, the Keeper of the Books and Guardian of the Written Word. He is implied to be Mr. Dewey&#x27;s alternate form.
* Patrick Stewart as Adventure, a swashbuckling gold adventure fiction book resembling a stereotypical pirate with an eyepatch, a hook, and a peg leg.
* Whoopi Goldberg as Fantasy, a fairy-styled lavender fairy-tale book. She can be opprobrious, aggressive, and hotheaded.
* Frank Welker as Horror, a turquoise horror fiction book with a resemblance to Igor. Despite his name, he is quite the opposite of horrific.
** Welker also provides the sound effects of the dragon, Moby Dick, and the other creatures.
* Leonard Nimoy as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, the mad scientist who turned into the horrific monster.
* George Hearn as Captain Ahab, an almost psychotic whale hunter who is out to kill the white whale Moby Dick.
* Jim Cummings as Long John Silver, the ruthless usurper Captain of the &quot;Hispaniola&quot;.
* Phil Hartman as Tom Morgan, a slender and violent pirate on the &quot;Hispaniola&quot;.
* Ed Gilbert as George Merry, an obese pirate on the &quot;Hispaniola&quot;.
* B.J. Ward as the Queen of Hearts, the tyrannical ruler of Wonderland who appears in the &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; book in the dragon&#x27;s stomach.

The Pirates of the &quot;Hispaniola&quot; are voiced by Richard Erdman, Fernando Escandon, Dorian Harewood, and Robert Picardo.

== Production ==
The animation in the film was produced by Turner Feature Animation, headed by David Kirschner and supervising animator Bruce W. Smith and recently spun off from Hanna-Barbera. The crew included animators who were veterans of productions such as &quot;An American Tail&quot; (1986) (also produced by David Kirschner and composed by James Horner), &quot;The Land Before Time&quot; (1988). This was one of the first films to feature live-action, traditional animation, and CGI animation all together. One scene involving a computer-generated dragon made from paint was used, a challenge for the filmmakers. All of the fictional works featured in the film were created and first published before January 1, 1923, making them a part of the public domain in most countries. The theme songs in the film are &quot;Dream Away&quot;, sung by Babyface and Lisa Stansfield, and &quot;Whatever You Imagine&quot;, sung by Wendy Moten.

According to the film&#x27;s animation crew, the film went overbudget during animation production due to mismanagement and changes to the narrative. Joe Johnston went on to express his dissatisfaction over the production, claiming that the film was re-edited without his consent. He has since crossed &quot;The Pagemaster&quot; off his résumé.

This was also the third film in which Leonard Nimoy and Frank Welker co-starred; the first two were &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot; and &quot;The Transformers: The Movie&quot;. The two later co-starred again, 17 years later, in &quot;&quot;. Nimoy, along with David Kirschner, were also involved in Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s 1993 feature-length animated television film adaptation of Ray Bradbury&#x27;s 1972 fantasy novel, &quot;The Halloween Tree&quot;, in which Nimoy was the voice of Carapace Clavicle Moundshroud.

&quot;The Pagemaster&quot; is 20th Century Fox&#x27;s last animated feature film to use the traditional hand-painted cel method of animation. 20th Century Fox&#x27;s next animated film, &quot;Anastasia&quot;, produced by its own in-house animation division, would use a digital method of coloring and combining scanned drawings similar to Disney&#x27;s CAPS software, which would eliminate the need for cels, the multiplane camera, and many of the optical effects used for the last time in &quot;The Pagemaster&quot;.

=== Legal issue ===
The screenwriting credits for this film were the subject of a protracted legal arbitration with the Writers Guild of America (WGA) when its producer, David Kirschner, attempted to claim sole authorship of the screenplay and original story, with no credit for its original screenwriter, David Casci. Typically, proposed credits are submitted to the WGA for approval well in advance of the release of a film or the publishing of posters or novelizations on which writing credits appear. In the case of &quot;The Pagemaster&quot;, the producers attempted to claim that, as the film was now largely animated, the WGA did not have jurisdiction to determine credits. Casci had written the screenplay under a WGA contract, as well as previous live-action versions for Disney Television dating back to 1985, also written under WGA contract. These facts positioned the WGA to get involved, testing their tenuous authority over a feature film with animated elements.

After a lengthy investigation and interviews with those intimately familiar with the genesis of the &quot;Pagemaster&quot; project, including three persons within Kirschner&#x27;s own office, the WGA credit arbitration process determined that David Casci was, in fact, the primary writer, and that Kirschner did not provide a sufficient creative contribution to the writing process to warrant any screenwriting credit. Upon receiving this determination by the WGA, Fox threatened to pull out of arbitration and release the film without WGA-approved credits, positioning the WGA to be forced to file an injunction blocking the film&#x27;s heavily promoted Christmas season release.

Ultimately, a settlement was reached, and Fox released the film with both Kirschner and Casci receiving story and screenplay credit, with a third writer, Ernie Contreras, also receiving screenplay credit.

At the time, this case was the most expensive and extensive investigation of its type undertaken by the WGA on behalf of one of its members.

=== Extended and deleted scenes ===
&quot;The Pagemaster&quot; is presented in an extended cut version. During the production, some original scenes were removed, both live-action and animation. The deleted scenes and characters can be still seen during the making of the film, trailers and TV spots, SkyBox International trading cards, books and other related products. They can be also seen during the sneak peek on the 1993 VHS release of &quot;Once Upon a Forest&quot;, the 1994 VHS release of &quot;Rookie of the Year&quot;, and in the promotional trailer of the VHS release of the film on the promotional demo/screener VHS copy in 1995.

== Release ==
The film was a production by Turner Pictures. 20th Century Fox handled U.S. distribution, while Turner Pictures Worldwide handled international distribution.

The film grossed $13.7 million in North American theaters from a budget of $34 million.

== Reception ==
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 19% based on 21 reviews and an average rating of 4.3/10. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade A− on scale of A to F.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; criticized the way the film&#x27;s message came across, calling it a &quot;sad and dreary film&quot;, adding that its message seemed to be that &quot;books can be almost as much fun as TV cartoons and video arcade games&quot;. Brian Lowry of &quot;Variety&quot; said that the film&#x27;s principal appeal for adults would be its abbreviated running time, and that it did not do enough with its famous fictional characters, noting: &quot;A more inspired moment has Richard using a book, &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot;, to escape from the belly of a dragon. Unfortunately, such moments are few and far between&quot;. Rita Kempley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; gave the film a positive review, calling it a &quot;splendidly original children&#x27;s fantasy about the world of books&quot;. James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave another positive review, calling it a &quot;clever, often engaging, and always fast-paced motion picture&quot; that &quot;uses the visual medium to encourage its viewers to reach out with their imagination&quot;.

&quot;The Pagemaster&quot; earned a Razzie Award nomination for Macaulay Culkin as Worst Actor for his performance in the film (also for &quot;Getting Even with Dad&quot; and &quot;Richie Rich&quot;). He lost the award to Kevin Costner for &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot;.

== Year-end lists ==
* 10th – Sandi Davis, &quot;The Oklahoman&quot;

== Home media ==
&quot;The Pagemaster&quot; was first released on VHS and LaserDisc on April 4, 1995, by Fox Video. 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released the film on DVD on May 28, 2002, on Region 1 and Blu-ray on August 6, 2013, on Region A.

==Music==
The score was written by film composer James Horner. The soundtrack also featured two songs based on Horner&#x27;s themes. The songs were titled &quot;Whatever You Imagine&quot; by Wendy Moten which was heard during the film when all four characters finally enter into the fantasy section and &quot;Dream Away&quot; by Babyface and Lisa Stansfield is heard during the end credits. The soundtrack album was released only on Compact Disc and Cassette Tape format on October 30, 1994, and is also available in the iTunes Store.

== Book adaptations ==
Contrary to any claims, the screenplay and film are not based on any book. David Casci&#x27;s screenplay preceded all novelizations and illustrated books by several years.

A number of books based on the film exist, including an illustrated book attributed to David Kirschner and Ernie Contreras, illustrated by Jerry Tiritilli, which contained large passages from the Casci screenplay without giving Casci writing credit. The film was well into production by the time this book was introduced in the 1993 F. A. O. Schwarz Christmas Catalog. Other properties based on the film include a novelization of the film, children&#x27;s story books, pop-up books and other film ancillaries such as toys and games.

== Video game ==

Video game adaptations of the film were released the same year as the film. They were developed by Probe Software Ltd. and published by Fox Interactive. The PC and non-PC versions of the game are almost entirely different games; the PC game is an FMV adventure game and is developed by Mammoth Micro Productions, published by Turner Interactive and distributed by Turner Home Entertainment, and the non-PC versions are platformers.

<doc id="1266491" wikidata="Q1065117" url="?curid=1266491" title="Charles J. Chaput">
<text>Charles Joseph Chaput OFMCap ( ; born September 26, 1944) is an American prelate of the Catholic Church. He was the ninth archbishop of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, serving from 2011 until 2020. He previously served as archbishop of the Archdiocese of Denver in Colorado (1997–2011) and bishop of the Diocese of Rapid City in South Dakota (1988–1997). Chaput was the first archbishop of Philadelphia in 100 years who was not named a cardinal.

Chaput is a professed Capuchin Franciscan. A member of the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation in Kansas, he is the second Native American bishop and the first Native American archbishop.

==Early life==
Charles Chaput was born on September 26, 1944, in Concordia, Kansas, one of three children of Joseph and Marian Helen (née DeMarais) Chaput. His father was a French Canadian who was descended from King Louis IX. His mother was a Native American of the Prairie Band Potawatomi tribe; his maternal grandmother was the last member of the family to live on a reservation. Chaput himself was enrolled in the tribe at a young age, taking the name &quot;Pietasa&quot; (&quot;rustling wind&quot;). His Potawatomi name is &quot;the wind that rustles the leaves of the tree&quot; while his Sioux name is &quot;good eagle&quot;.

Chaput received his early education at Our Lady of Perpetual Help Grade School in Concordia. Deciding to become a priest at the age of 13, he attended St. Francis Seminary High School in Victoria, Kansas.

In 1965, at age 21, Chaput entered the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin, a branch of the Franciscans, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1967, he graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in philosophy from St. Fidelis College Seminary in Herman, Pennsylvania. On July 14, 1968, he made his solemn profession as a Capuchin friar. In 1970, he graduated Master of Arts in religious education from Capuchin College in Washington, DC.

==Priesthood==
Chaput was ordained to the priesthood for the Capuchin Order by Bishop Cyril Vogel on August 29, 1970. He received a Master of Theology degree from the University of San Francisco in 1971. From 1971 to 1974, he was an instructor in theology and spiritual director at St. Fidelis College. He then served as executive secretary and director of communications for the Capuchin province in Pittsburgh until 1977.

As a seminarian, Chaput was an active volunteer in the 1968 US presidential campaign of Senator Robert F. Kennedy. As a young priest, he supported the election of Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter as US president in 1976. Chaput was appointed pastor of Holy Cross Parish in Thornton, Colorado.

Chaput was elected vicar provincial for the Capuchin Province of Mid-America in 1977 and became secretary and treasurer for the province in 1980 and chief executive and provincial minister in 1983. He was part of a group of Native Americans who greeted Pope John Paul II when he visited Phoenix, Arizona, in 1987.

==Episcopal career==

===Bishop of Rapid City===
On April 11, 1988, Chaput was appointed bishop of the Diocese of Rapid City by John Paul II. He was consecrated on July 26, 1988, by Archbishop Pio Laghi, with Archbishop John Roach and Archbishop James Stafford serving as co-consecrators.

Chaput was the second priest of Native American ancestry to be consecrated a bishop in the United States, after Bishop Donald Pelotte. He was the first Native American to be consecrated as an ordinary bishop rather than a titular bishop. He chose as his episcopal motto: &quot;As Christ Loved the Church&quot; from Ephesians 5:25.

===Archbishop of Denver===
On February 18, 1997, Chaput was appointed by John Paul II as archbishop of the Archdiocese of Denver, replacing Archbishop James Stafford. In 2007, Chaput delivered the commencement address at Denver&#x27;s Augustine Institute. In 2008, he became the episcopal moderator of the Tekakwitha Conference.

In 2007, Chaput conducted an apostolic visitation to the Diocese of Toowoomba in Queensland, Australia, on behalf of the Congregation for Bishops. The Vatican was concerned by statements that Bishop Bill Morris had made regarding the ordination of women. In May 2011, Pope Benedict XVI removed Morris as bishop of Toowoomba after he refused to resign.

Chaput was one of five bishops who conducted a Vatican-ordered investigation into the Legionaries of Christ in 2009 to 2010. The investigation was prompted by sexual abuse accusations against the group&#x27;s founder, Reverend Marcial Maciel, who had been removed from ministry in 2006

===Archbishop of Philadelphia===
On July 19, 2011, Chaput was appointed as archbishop of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia by Pope Benedict XVI. He succeeded Cardinal Justin Rigali, who had reached retirement age of 75 in April 2010. Chaput&#x27;s strong record in handling cases of sexual abuse by priests was cited as a rationale for his appointment. He was installed on September 8, 2011.

From August 17 to 19, 2011, Chaput gave catechesis at the World Youth Day 2011 in Madrid, Spain, similar to the function he performed at the 2008 World Youth Day in Sydney. On November 14, 2014, at a meeting of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), Chaput was elected as a delegate to the 2015 Synod of Bishops on the Family pending Vatican approval. Though Chaput led a historically important see and his five immediate predecessors were cardinals, Benedict XVI did not appoint him a cardinal in his two 2012 consistories, nor did Pope Francis in any of his.

Pope Francis accepted Chaput&#x27;s letter of resignation as archbishop of Philadelphia on January 23, 2020.

==Views==
===Politics===
In his book &quot;Render unto Caesar: Serving the Nation by Living Our Catholic Beliefs in Political Life&quot;, Chaput exhorts Catholics to take a &quot;more active, vocal, and morally consistent role&quot; in the political process, arguing that private convictions cannot be separated from public actions without diminishing both. Rather than asking citizens to put aside their religious and moral beliefs for the sake of public policy, Chaput believed that American democracy depended upon a fully engaged citizenry, including religious believers, to function properly.

=== Abortion ===
Chaput has stated that absolute loyalty to the Church&#x27;s teachings on core, bioethical, and natural law doctrinal issues must be a higher priority for Catholics than their identity as Americans, their party affiliation and agenda and the laws of their country; Chaput also argues that for a Catholic, loyalty to God is more important than any other identity. He says that the martyrs and confessors gave witness to this importance.

Regarding whether Catholic politicians who support abortion rights for women should be denied communion, Chaput has written that, while denying anyone the Eucharist is a &quot;very grave matter&quot; that should be used only in &quot;extraordinary cases of public scandal&quot;, those who are &quot;living in serious sin or who deny the teachings of the Church&quot; should voluntarily refrain from receiving communion.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2004 reported that Chaput said it was sinful for Catholics to vote for Democratic US presidential nominee Senator John Kerry. He noted Kerry&#x27;s views on abortion rights, among others. According to the &quot;Times&quot;, Chaput said that anyone voting for Kerry was &quot;cooperating in evil&quot; and needed &quot;to go to confession&quot;. After the interview, Chaput criticized &quot;The New York Times&quot; for the way it construed his remarks. The archdiocese criticized the article as being &quot;heavily truncated and framed&quot; and posted a full transcript of it. He stopped responding to the paper&#x27;s inquiries for six years, in part because he believed the &quot;Times&quot; had misrepresented him. Chaput was seen by some critics as &quot;part of a group of bishops intent on throwing the weight of the Catholic Church into the elections&quot;. In public comments, his linkage of the eucharist to the policy stances of political candidates and their supporters were seen as a politicization of moral theology.

In 2009, Chaput criticized a &quot;spirit of adulation bordering on servility&quot; toward President Barack Obama, remarking that &quot;in democracies, we elect public servants, not messiahs&quot;. He said that Obama tried to mask his record on abortion rights and other issues with &quot;rosy marketing about unity, hope, and change&quot;. Chaput also dismissed the notion that Obama was given a broad mandate, saying that he was elected to &quot;fix an economic crisis&quot; and not to &quot;retool American culture on the issues of marriage and the family, sexuality, bioethics, religion in public life, and abortion&quot;.

Chaput in September 2016 said that the 2016 American presidential election offered Americans the &quot;worst choice in 50 years&quot;. In his view, both Donald Trump and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton were &quot;deeply flawed&quot; candidates.

=== Gun control ===
Following the 2019 mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, Chaput wrote that he supports background checks for purchasers of firearms, but added this comment:Only a fool can believe that &#x27;gun control&#x27; will solve the problem of mass violence. The people using the guns in these loathsome incidents are moral agents with twisted hearts. And the twisting is done by the culture of sexual anarchy, personal excess, political hatreds, intellectual dishonesty, and perverted freedoms that we&#x27;ve systematically created over the past half-century.

===LGBT rights ===
Chaput opposes same-sex marriage and questioned the upbringing of children of same-sex couples. He has said that same-sex couples cannot show children that their parents love each other in the same way that opposite-sex couples can.

In 2015, Chaput supported the dismissal of Margie Winters, the director of religious education at Waldron Mercy Academy in Merion Station, Pennsylvania. Winters had married her female partner in a civil marriage ceremony in 2007. When a parent reported their marriage to Waldron, Principal Nell Stetser asked Winters to resign; when she refused, the school did not renew her contract. Chaput said the school administrators had shown &quot;character and common sense at a moment when both seem to be uncommon&quot;.

On October 4, 2018, at the Synod on Young People and Vocations in Rome Chaput objected to the use of the terms &quot;LGBT&quot; or &quot;LGBTQ&quot; in church documents. He said:&quot;There is no such thing as an ‘LGBTQ Catholic&#x27; or a &#x27;transgender Catholic&#x27; or even a &#x27;heterosexual Catholic,&#x27; as if our sexual appetites defined who we are; as if these designations described discrete communities of differing but equal integrity within the real ecclesial community, the body of Jesus Christ.&quot; 

=== Sexual abuse ===
Chaput has denounced what he sees as a lack of orthodoxy in the church. He accused past Catholic leaders of &quot;ignorance, cowardice and laziness in forming young people to carry the faith into the future.&quot; On March 27, 2019, in a speech to Ohio seminarians, he blamed sexual abuse in the Catholic Church on &quot;a pattern of predatory homosexuality and a failure to weed that out from church life&quot;.

===Immigration reform ===
Chaput advocates reform of immigration laws to regularize the status of most undocumented immigrants as a moral imperative.

<text>Nicholas Alexander Barnett (born May 27, 1981) is an American former professional football player who was a linebacker in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Oregon State Beavers, and was selected by the Green Bay Packers in the first round of the 2003 NFL draft.

== College career ==
Barnett attended Oregon State University, where he was a four-year letter winner for the Oregon State Beavers football team (1999–2002), starting the last three seasons at strong side linebacker. As a senior, Barnett was a first-team All-Pacific-10 Conference selection. He led the conference in tackles with 121 (62 solo).

=== College statistics ===
== Professional career ==
=== Green Bay Packers ===

The Green Bay Packers selected Barnett in the first round (29th overall) of the 2003 NFL draft. Barnett was the third linebacker drafted in 2003, behind Terrell Suggs (10th overall) and Calvin Pace (18th overall).

On July 19, 2003, the Packers signed Barnett to five-year, $6 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $3.21 million. Barnett entered training camp as the &#x27;de facto&#x27; starting middle linebacker, replacing Hardy Nickerson. Head coach Mike Sherman named Barnett the starting middle linebacker to begin his rookie season. He started alongside outside linebackers Hannibal Navies and Na&#x27;il Diggs.

He made his professional regular season debut and first career start during the Green Bay Packers&#x27; season-opener against the Minnesota Vikings and made five combined tackles (one solo) during their 30–25 loss. On September 14, 2003, Barnett collected a season-high 14 combined tackles (12 solo), deflected one pass, and made his first career interception during a 31–6 victory against the Detroit Lions in Week 2. Barnett intercepted a pass by Lions&#x27; quarterback Joey Harrington, that was originally intended for tight end Mikhael Ricks, and returned it for a 13-yard gain during the fourth quarter. In Week 4, he made four combined tackles (three solo) and made his first career sack on Bears&#x27; quarterback Kordell Stewart for a five-yard loss during the first quarter of a 38–23 victory at the Chicago Bears. Barnett was inactive for the Packers&#x27; Week 13 loss at the Detroit Lions after sustaining an ankle injury during a 20–10 win against the San Francisco 49ers the previous week. He finished his rookie season in 2003 with 112 combined tackle (86 solo), three pass deflections, three interceptions, and two sacks in 15 games and 15 starts.

The Packers finished first in the NFC North with a 10–6 record in 2003. On January 4, 2004, Barnett started in his first career playoff game and made six combined tackles (three solo) during a 33–27 overtime victory against the Seattle Seahawks during the NFC Wildcard Game. The following week, he made five solo tackles and defended two passes as the Packers lost 20–17 at the Philadelphia Eagles during the NFC Divisional Round and were eliminated from the playoffs.

On April 10, 2007, Barnett signed a six-year contract extension worth $34.85 million.

Barnett missed the second half of the 2008 season after suffering a torn knee ligament during November 9&#x27;s game against the Minnesota Vikings.

Barnett suffered a season-ending wrist injury in a Week 4 matchup vs. the Detroit Lions. He was put on injured reserve on October 7, 2010. It was the second time in three seasons that Barnett ended his season on injured reserve. As of 2018 Barnett is third in all-time tackles for the Green Bay Packers. Barnett was released on July 28, after Green Bay was unable to find a trade.

=== Buffalo Bills ===
Barnett signed a three-year, $12 million deal with the Buffalo Bills on July 31, 2011. On February 11, 2013, the Bills announced that Barnett would be released from his contract along with safety George Wilson.

=== Washington Redskins ===
On July 31, 2013, Barnett agreed to a one-year deal with the Washington Redskins. He switched from the outside to inside linebacker position for the Redskins&#x27; defensive scheme. On December 24, he was placed on injured reserve after suffering a MCL sprain in the Week 16 game against the Dallas Cowboys.

<text>Kyle Janek (born January 10, 1958) is an American physician and former Republican member of the Texas Senate, having represented District 17 from November 2002 until June 2, 2008. The district includes portions of Harris, Brazoria, Fort Bend, Galveston, and Jefferson counties. Janek was not a candidate for renomination to the state Senate in the Republican primary held on March 4.

Janek resigned the seat, and Governor Rick Perry called a special election to coincide with the regular November 4 general election to fill the two years remaining in the term. Republican Joan Huffman, a former felony court judge from Houston and Democrat Chris Bell, a former U.S. representative who was Perry&#x27;s 2006 election opponent, led the field and went into a December 16 runoff. Huffman ultimately prevailed, 56-44 percent. She becomes the sixth woman serving in the state Senate.

==Biography==

An anesthesiologist by training, Janek has served in the Texas Legislature as a Republican since 1994. He received an M.D. from the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston in 1983 and has since practiced medicine. Janek is the son of former Galveston County Commissioner Eddie Janek Sr. He is the brother of Galveston politician Eddie Janek Jr., who has previously sought county office.

In 1992 Janek entered the Republican primary for Texas State Representative District 134 against two opponents, Mike Shelby and Tim Turner. Janek prevailed against Shelby, later a U.S. Attorney, in the runoff, but he lost the general election to Democrat Sue Schechter, even though the District was almost 60 percent Republican. In 1994, when Schechter chose not to seek re-election, Janek was elected. He served in the Texas House of Representatives until 2002, when he ran for the Texas Senate. Janek sought the seat being vacated by longtime District 17 Senator J. E. &quot;Buster&quot; Brown. Janek defeated attorney Gary M. Polland in the Republican primary, and then prevailed against Democratic candidate Ronnie Ellen Harrison in the general election. He was reelected again in 2006 over a Libertarian Party opponent.

Since being elected to the Senate, Janek has focused his legislative efforts on property tax reform, and the sponsorship of a state program to prevent steroid abuse among high school athletes.

On September 1, 2012, Janek began serving as the Executive Commissioner to the Texas Health and Human Services Commission.

==2008 election==

Janek resigned his Senate seat in June 2008. Joan Huffman won the subsequent special election to replace Janek.

<text>Donald Jerome Driver (born February 2, 1975) is an American former professional football wide receiver who played for the Green Bay Packers of the National Football League (NFL). After playing college football for Alcorn State University, Driver was picked by Green Bay in the seventh round of the 1999 NFL draft. He spent his entire 14-season NFL career with the Packers and holds the franchise&#x27;s all-time records for most career receptions and receiving yards. Driver was a member of the Packers team that won Super Bowl XLV. Every year in Cleveland, Driver holds the Donald Driver Football Camp for local kids which is held at the Cleveland High School Football field. Upon retirement, he won season 14 of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;.

==Early life==
Driver was born in Houston, Texas, on February 2, 1975. He was the middle child of five siblings. Driver&#x27;s parents, Marvin Driver Jr. and Faye Gray, divorced when he was just a young boy. Donald had a tough childhood living out of a U-Haul truck for a period of time during his early teens, after a collection agency confiscated his family&#x27;s possessions. Donald spent multiple nights in motel rooms that his mother had purchased with food stamps. Driver and his older brother Marvin III, began stealing cars and selling drugs during their teenage years in order to make it from day to day. Driver was quoted by &quot;USA Today&quot; stating, &quot;You try to do anything you can to provide for your family.&quot; At the age of 14 years, Donald would move in with his grandmother, Betty Lofton. This was the point of time where his life started to turn around.

Driver shone as an athlete early in his years at Milby High School in Houston. He lettered four times each in track, football, basketball and baseball. He was a Texas All-State honorable mention in football, where he played at the wide receiver, defensive back, and kickoff return positions.

==College career==
Driver attended Alcorn State University in Mississippi, where he lettered in both football and track &amp; field. He finished his college football career at Alcorn State with 88 receptions for 1993 yards (19.69 yards per catch). He was a five-time &quot;Athlete of the Year&quot; in his conference for his track and football prowess.

Driver is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.

===Track and field===
Driver is a decorated track athlete. He is an Olympic-class high jumper, being able to jump . He qualified for the 1996 Olympic Field Trials in the high jump.

He competed for the Alcorn State Braves track team, where he excelled in the high jump and earned all-conference honors his senior year. He leaped 2.30 meters in the high jump, 15.62 meters in the triple jump and 7.75 meters in the long jump.

==Professional career==
Driver was selected by the Green Bay Packers in the seventh round of the 1999 NFL draft with the 213th overall pick. He spent his entire career with the Packers.
Known as one of the most consistent wide receivers in the game, Driver was not particularly productive his first three seasons in Green Bay (1999–2001), as he was behind wide receivers Antonio Freeman and Corey Bradford on the depth chart. With the departure of Freeman and Bradford, Driver blossomed in a starting role.

Driver was solid throughout his career, often posting 1,000 receiving yards in a season. Driver had the most catches in the NFL in the middle of the field in 2006. He set a career best for yards on November 12, 2006, when he caught six passes for 191 yards, including an 82-yard touchdown against the Minnesota Vikings. Driver finished the 2006 season in the top five of the league in reception yardage with 1,295 yards. He also recorded the most receptions in his career with 92 of them, earning a spot in the 2007 Pro Bowl.
On December 16, 2007, during a 33–14 victory over the St. Louis Rams, veteran Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre broke Dan Marino&#x27;s all-time record mark of 61,361 career passing yards. The new record came on a seven-yard completion to Driver. Driver was selected for the 2008 Pro Bowl.

In the NFC Championship game on January 20, 2008, against the New York Giants, Driver had the longest play in the playoffs of the Packers&#x27; franchise history with a 90-yard touchdown catch from Favre.

On October 18, 2009, Driver became the Green Bay Packers&#x27; all-time leading receiver in catches, with 596. He went on to catch six more balls for 107 yards in a 26–0 home victory over the Detroit Lions. On September 8, 2011, Driver caught four balls for 41 yards in the opening game against the New Orleans Saints and was only one yard short of becoming the Packers&#x27; all-time leader in receiving yards. Driver finally broke the Packers&#x27; all-time receiving yardage record on September 18, 2011, against the Carolina Panthers after he caught a 10-yard pass from Aaron Rodgers, surpassing James Lofton.

On February 6, 2011, Driver was injured on his second reception of Super Bowl XLV. Out with an ankle sprain, Driver returned to the game in the end for the final plays as the Packers went on to beat the Pittsburgh Steelers 31–25. Driver finished Super Bowl XLV with two receptions for 28 yards. Despite losing playing time to Greg Jennings and Jordy Nelson, Driver was a veteran presence for a young Packers receiving corps led by NFL MVP QB Aaron Rodgers in the twilight of Driver&#x27;s career.

===Retirement===
On January 31, 2013, Driver announced his retirement on ESPN2 Mike and Mike in the Morning after spending his entire career (14 seasons) with the Green Bay Packers. He missed only four games in his career, the last one being November 18, 2012.

On February 6, 2013, the Green Bay Packers hosted a public retirement ceremony for Driver. This was the first public retirement ceremony ever held for a Packers player. It was held in the Lambeau Field Atrium with comments made by Mark Murphy, Ted Thompson, Mike McCarthy, and Driver. It was sold out in 14 minutes and hundreds of fans were in attendance. The mayor of Green Bay presented Driver with a key to the city and announced that the receiver statue that previously resided in front of the former Packers Hall of Fame and is now in downtown Green Bay would be refurbished, with the receiver wearing a No. 80 Driver jersey. The street leading to the statue was also renamed &quot;Donald Driver Way.&quot;

On July 22, 2017, Driver was inducted into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame.

Since 2004, Driver has co-hosted the statewide Packer analysis television series &quot;Inside the Huddle with Donald Driver&quot; with WLUK-TV&#x27;s sports director Drew Smith. Every Thursday Donald talks football with John Mercure on Wisconsin&#x27;s Afternoon News with John Mercure on AM 620 WTMJ. He previously served as host to the annual Offense vs. Defense softball game featuring members of the Green Bay Packers.

As a well-known athlete in the state of Wisconsin, Driver has been featured in marketing campaigns for companies such as McDonald&#x27;s, AirTran Airways, Kwik Trip, Goodwill, Jani-King and Time Warner Cable.

Throughout his career, Driver has been very active off the field, making over 300 charitable appearances since his rookie season in 1999. In the spring of 2001, Donald and his wife Betina created the &quot;Donald Driver Foundation&quot;, which offers assistance to ill children with unmanageable hospital bills, provides housing for the homeless, and donates to a variety of local charities. In December 2003, the foundation put two previously homeless families in new, fully furnished homes.

Donald has also donated much of his time and efforts to such institutions as Children&#x27;s Hospital of Wisconsin and Goodwill Industries. In 2001, Driver was awarded the &quot;Community Service Award&quot; by the Green Bay Chamber of Commerce in recognition of his outstanding community involvement. In 2005, he was awarded the Ed Block Courage award by his Green Bay teammates. Most recently, Driver was named the 2013 AMVETS Humanitarian of the Year.

Driver is also the author of three children&#x27;s books, &quot;Quickie Handles a Loss&quot;, &quot;Quickie Makes the Team&quot;, and &quot;Quickie Goes to the Big Game&quot;. The books are based on Driver&#x27;s bedtime storytelling to his three children, and are sold statewide in Wisconsin through bookstores, participating Goodwill locations, the Packer Pro Shop and on his website. He has stated that &quot;Quickie&quot; is a nickname his mother gave him because, when she would chase him around the house, she could never catch him. In the Fall of 2013, Driver released his official memoir, &quot;Driven&quot;, which included many personal stories about both his childhood and career with the Packers that he had never shared before and it made the New York Best Seller list. Two weeks after the book&#x27;s release, it made the New York Times Bestsellers list. In the Summer of 2017, Driver released a health and fitness book, &quot;The 3D Body Revolution: The Ultimate Workout + Nutrition Blueprint to Get Healthy and Lean&quot;, which featured 25 recipes and 36 exercises illustrated with clear step-by-step photos. Following its release, &quot;The 3D Body Revolution&quot; was featured as a #1 new release in Amazon&#x27;s exercise injuries and rehabilitation category.

On February 28, 2012, it was announced that Driver would join the cast of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; for season 14, paired with professional dance partner Peta Murgatroyd. Driver&#x27;s high energy and athleticism were repeatedly praised by the judges, though Driver was also notorious for not getting a perfect score, until their freestyle, from the judges. Driver and Murgatroyd made it all the way to the finale, and despite competitions from fellow finalists William Levy&#x27;s high fanbase and Katherine Jenkins&#x27; consistently high scores, Driver and Murgatroyd were declared winners on the season finale on May 22, 2012.

On June 15, 2013, Driver received a street in his name and a statue dedicated in his honor. The statue is located on the corner of Dousman Street and Donald Driver Way (formerly Pearl Street) in downtown Green Bay.

In March 2014, Donald Driver created the Donald Driver Driven To Achieve Awards. Since then, the Driven to Achieve Awards have honored 18 outstanding recipients and have given away over $1 million.

Driver currently splits his time between his home state of Texas and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, purchasing a $3 million Milwaukee loft in 2022 from fellow Wisconsin athlete Jabari Parker. He operates a nonprofit called the Donald Driver Foundation in both Wisconsin and Texas and serves as the current cultural ambassador for Milwaukee&#x27;s Marcus Center for the Performing Arts, in addition to business ventures.

<text>Colombo is a lunar impact crater that lies on the strip of rough continental terrain between Mare Fecunditatis to the east and Mare Nectaris in the west. It is located to the south of the crater Goclenius, and northwest of Cook, and is named for the late 15th and early 16th century Italian explorer Christopher Columbus.

The rim of Colombo is circular, although slightly indented along the northwest where Colombo A intrudes slightly into the interior. The inner wall is asymmetrical, being much more narrow to the north and northwest and wider to the southeast. The rim is somewhat eroded, and several tiny craterlets lie along the inner wall to the southeast. The small satellite Colombo B lies across the south-southwestern rim.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Colombo.

<text>Michael Christopher Flanagan (born November 10, 1973) is an American former professional football player who was a center for 12 seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the UCLA Bruins and was selected by the Green Bay Packers in the third round of the 1996 NFL draft with the 90th overall pick. Flanagan played from 1998 to 2005 with the Packers and then with the Houston Texans from 2006 to 2007.

==Early life and college==
Flanagan was born in Washington, D.C., and graduated from Rio Americano High School in Sacramento, California, in 1991. He is of Irish descent. At UCLA, Flanagan redshirted in 1991, played one game in 1992, and started 32 consecutive games from 1993 to 1995. He was a first-team All-Pac-10 selection in his junior and senior seasons and third-team All-America recognition as a senior. Flanagan became a starter in 1993 after Jonathan Ogden, a future NFL player, was injured. In 2002, he graduated from UCLA with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history. For three years, Flanagan earned a spot on the UCLA athletic director&#x27;s academic honor roll.

==Professional career==

===Green Bay Packers===
In the 1996 NFL draft, the Green Bay Packers selected Flanagan in the third round as the 90th overall pick. Flanagan sat out the 1996 and 1997 seasons due to an injury sustained during the 1996 preseason.

Although the Green Bay Packers traded Flanagan to the Carolina Panthers in August 1998, the trade was nullified because Flanagan did not pass a physical. With the Packers, Flanagan made his professional regular season debut on December 13, 1998, a victory over the Chicago Bears. Flanagan became the starting center in 2001. Flanagan was named to the Pro Bowl for the first time in 2003, the first Packers center to be named since 1996. Flanagan sat out the season after October 2004 due to knee surgery.

===Houston Texans===
On March 24, 2006, Flanagan signed with the Houston Texans. He was released by the Texans on February 20, 2008.

<text>Jane Gray Nelson 
(born October 5, 1951) 
is an American businesswoman who sits on the board of her husbands company and former school teacher (1973-1978) who serves as the Secretary of State of Texas since 2023. She was a Texas state senator who represented Texas Senate District 12. She was elected to the Senate in 1992 after serving two two-year terms (1988–1992) on the Texas State Board of Education. In 2023, Governor Greg Abbott appointed Nelson to succeed John B. Scott as Secretary of State. She was sworn in to that office on Saturday, January 7.

==Texas Senate==
Nelson was the highest-ranking Republican woman in the Texas Senate. The tenth woman ever elected to the Texas Senate, she was the first Republican woman ever appointed chair of a standing committee and held the distinction of being longest-serving chair of the Senate Health and Human Services Committee in Texas history. In 2015, she was appointed chair of the Senate Finance Committee, being the first woman to hold the position in the history of the Texas Senate. She also served as chair of the Sunset Advisory Commission.

During the 2013 legislative session, Nelson authored 40 bills that were passed into law by the Legislature, and she served as the Senate sponsor on 30 successful bills authored by House members. She served on 19 conference committees, including for SB 1, the appropriations bill. Nelson chaired the Article II workgroup, which increased the women&#x27;s health budget by $100 million and made significant new investments in mental health and Child Protective Services.

In October 2019, the Texas Parent Teacher Association named Nelson a Texas PTA Champion for Children for her leadership during the 86th legislative session.

In July 2021, Nelson announced she would not seek an 11th term to the Texas Senate.

===Senate Health and Human Services Committee===
In July 2013, Nelson presided over a 16-hour hearing on an abortion bill that drew testimony from over 3,800 people, including 357 who provided oral testimony. The bill, HB 3, sought to ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. The bill also required abortion facilities to upgrade to ambulatory surgical standards.

=== Senate Finance Committee ===
In 2014 Nelson was appointed chair of the Senate Finance Committee, the first woman of either party to hold that position. In that capacity she authored four state budgets. Her chairmanship ended in January 2022. In June 2022, the Senate Finance committee dedicated its conference room to Nelson in her honor.

<doc id="1266516" wikidata="Q196153" url="?curid=1266516" title="Kabeer Gbaja-Biamila">
<text>Muhammed-Kabeer Olarewaju Gbaja-Biamila Sr. ( ; born September 24, 1977), nicknamed &quot;KGB&quot;, is an American former professional football player who spent his entire nine-year career as a defensive end for the Green Bay Packers of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the San Diego State Aztecs. He was selected by Green Bay in the fifth round of the 2000 NFL draft. He was a Pro Bowl selection in 2003.

==Early life==
Gbaja-Biamila attended Crenshaw High School in Los Angeles, California, and was a three-year letterman in football and in track and field.

While attending Crenshaw High School, Gbaja-Biamila was a student-owner of Food from the &#x27;Hood, an organic food company that sprang from the 1992 Los Angeles riots. Food From the Hood eventually went on to launch a line of salad dressings that appeared in major Southern California grocery chains as well as on Amazon.com. For their work, Food From the Hood received the &quot;American Achievement Award&quot; from &quot;Newsweek&quot;, which featured both Gbaja-Biamila and other founders on its cover. On November 1, 1994 Prince Charles paid a visit to Crenshaw High School, upon an invitation from Food From the Hood.

==College career==
Gbaja-Biamila attended San Diego State University where he was a three-year starter. He finished his career with the Aztecs with a school record 33 sacks, a mark previously held by former Packer Mike Douglass at 26 sacks. He was named a first-team all-conference selection in each of his last three seasons. He graduated with a degree in business administration.

==Professional career==
In 2000, he attended the NFL Combine as an outside linebacker. He was measured at 6&#x27;3 and 5/8 while weighing in at 243 pounds. He ran a 4.65 40 yard dash but fell in part because he was a tweener (teams weren&#x27;t sure whether he had the bulk to be a DE or the ability to stick as an OLB) and some concerns over the competition he played against in college.

Gbaja-Biamila was chosen by the Packers in the fifth round of the 2000 NFL draft with the 149th overall selection. As a rookie, he appeared in seven games and recorded 1.5 sacks and nine total tackles.

Gbaja-Biamila broke out in the 2001 season. He recorded three sacks and a forced fumble in Week 1 against the Detroit Lions in a 28–6 victory. In Week 4, against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, he had another three-sack game to go with a forced fumble in the 14–10 loss. He was named NFC Defensive Player of the Month for December 2001. He finished the 2001 season with 13.5 sacks, 24 total tackles, and three forced fumbles.

In Week 5, against the Chicago Bears, Gbaja-Biamila recorded a 72-yard interception return for a touchdown in the 34–21 victory. He had a three-sack game in Week 9 against the Miami Dolphins. He finished the 2002 season with 12 sacks, 47 total tackles, six passes defensed, and four forced fumbles in 15 games and 11 starts.

In 2003, Gbaja-Biamila became the first player in Packers history to record ten or more sacks in three consecutive seasons. He finished the 2003 season with ten sacks, 47 total tackles, and three forced fumbles in 16 starts. He was selected to the Pro Bowl that year.

Gbaja-Biamila recorded four sacks in a Week 17 victory over the Chicago Bears in the 2004 season. He was named NFC Defensive Player of the Week for his game against Chicago. In 2004, Gbaja-Biamila again recorded double-digit sacks, taking down opposing quarterbacks 13.5 times.

In the 2005 season, Gbaja-Bilamila started all 16 games and recorded eight sacks, 53 total tackles, and two forced fumbles.

During the 2006 season, Gbaja-Biamila appeared in all 16 games and started three. He recorded six sacks, 40 total tackles, and two forced fumbles.

In October 2007, Gbaja-Biamila broke the Green Bay Packers sack record with 69 sacks, which was previously held by Hall of Famer Reggie White with sacks. Originally, Gbaja-Biamila was not credited with a third sack against Vikings quarterback Kelly Holcomb during the Packers vs. Vikings game on September 30. Later on in the week, the Elias Sports Bureau reviewed game footage and credited Gbaja-Biamila with a third sack on Kelly Holcomb, who was originally ruled as rushing for zero yards. He finished the 2007 season with 9.5 sacks, 26 total tackles, one pass defended, and two forced fumbles in 15 games and two starts.

Gbaja-Biamila played in seven games (one start) for the Packers in 2008, recording nine tackles, half a sack and a pass defensed. He was released on November 1 after the team activated defensive tackle Justin Harrell from the Physically Unable to Perform (PUP) list.

He was a 2013 inductee, along with Packer kicker Chris Jacke, into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame.

==NFL career statistics==
===Regular season===
===Playoffs===
==Family and personal life==
Gbaja-Biamila is the fifth child of his mother Bolatito Gbaja-Biamila (née: Anjorin) and the second child of his father Mustapha Gbaja-Biamila. He is the older brother of former NFL linebacker Akbar Gbaja-Biamila.

His middle name &quot;Ọláńrewájú&quot; means &quot;Wealth is moving forward&quot; in the Yoruba language, while his surname “Gbàjàbíàmílà” translates to &quot;One who, while fighting, pretends to be separating a fight.&quot;

Both of his parents were Muslim until his mother converted to Christianity. While he was raised in a Sunni Muslim household, during his rookie season with the Green Bay Packers he converted to Christianity.

He was the coordinator at the local Celebration Church Bayside for Crown Financial Ministries, which teaches people how to manage money using Biblical principles. He was involved in the first faith-based event at Lambeau Field called Lambeau Leap of Faith in July 2007, where thousands of Christians gathered.

He formerly served on the board of directors at Freedom House Ministries, a shelter for homeless families in Green Bay. Each year, Freedom House helps over 100 families, including over 250 children, overcome homelessness and move into stable, permanent housing and employment. In 2007, he started Kabeer&#x27;s Freedom House Sack Fund. He pledged, along with his teammates and members of the Green Bay community, $10,000 per sack registered in 2007 to go to his fund.

On April 3, 2016, Gbaja-Biamila appeared alongside 2016 Republican presidential candidates Ted Cruz and Scott Walker at a rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin.

Following retirement, he became involved with Straitway Truth Ministry, a Black Hebrew Israelite group that preaches biblical literalism, and denounced Christianity.

In 2017, Gbaja-Biamila filed for divorce from his wife, Eileen. Eileen moved out with their seven children when he denounced Christianity and made plans to move the family to Straitway&#x27;s compound in Lafayette, Tennessee. As of 2020, Gbaja-Biamila remained estranged from his eight children, the youngest of whom was born after the divorce.

Gbaja-Biamila married Bri Rainey, a member of Straitway&#x27;s Kansas City chapter, in 2019. He received approval from the church to marry Rainey after it had denied his prior requests to marry several other women. She gave birth to the couple&#x27;s first child in 2020. Gbaja-Biamila said he wanted to have 94 children, acknowledging that he&#x27;d need multiple partners to achieve the goal.

On December 17, 2019, Gbaja-Biamila was involved in an incident at his children&#x27;s school event. Two members of Straitway Praiseland, a Wisconsin branch of Straitway Truth Ministry led by Gbaja-Biamila, were arrested during an incident at Assembly of God Church in Green Bay during a Christmas pageant put on by the private Providence Academy. Jordan Salmi and Ryan Desmith attended the pageant and triggered a trespassing complaint since they did not have children at the school. When they were arrested, they reportedly had concealed weapons on them without permits. The &quot;Green Bay Press-Gazette&quot; quoted Gbaja-Biamila saying, “They got my sons — my property — doing pagan worship, and I told them I forbid it, and they dishonor me and say it’s OK for my sons to dishonor their father.” He added, “They used the sons, the children, to oppress the man, and the woman rules over them, so that the man walks in error.”

On March 17, 2020, Gbaja-Biamila was arrested and charged with contempt of court during an appearance in court for his divorce from Eileen. He refused to sign a document that allowed Eileen to access their bank accounts, arguing that as a sovereign citizen, he was not subject to the law or the court and proclaimed, &quot;I have my own laws which are superior.” During his arrest, he resisted attempts to be handcuffed, yelled at his ex-wife, and was Tasered and strapped to a chair by multiple officers.

<doc id="1266519" wikidata="Q2312651" url="?curid=1266519" title="Atole">
<text>Atole (, believed to come from Nahuatl &quot;ātōlli&quot; or from Mayan), also known as atolli, atol and atol de elote, is a traditional hot masa-based beverage of Mexican origin. Atole can have different flavors added, such as vanilla, cinnamon, and guava. Chocolate &quot;atole&quot; is known as &quot;champurrado&quot; or simply &quot;atole&quot;. It typically accompanies tamales and is very popular during Day of the Dead (observed November 2) and &quot;Las Posadas&quot; (Christmas holiday season).

== Mayan origin ==
Many Classic Maya painted vessels feature a genre of inscriptions known as the “dedicatory formula” or the “primary standard sequence” (PSS) and the two main ingredients mentioned in the contents section of the PSS were cacao and atole.

==Regional variations==
===Mexico===
In Mexico, the drink typically includes &quot;masa&quot; (corn hominy flour), water, &quot;piloncillo&quot; (unrefined cane sugar), cinnamon, vanilla, and optional chocolate or fruit. The mixture is blended and heated before serving. &quot;Atole&quot; is made by toasting &quot;masa&quot; on a &quot;comal&quot; (griddle), then adding water that was boiled with cinnamon sticks.

===Central America===
In Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and Nicaragua, &quot;atol de elote&quot; (maize &quot;atol&quot;), or simply &quot;atole&quot;, is a popular beverage. Pineapple &quot;atol&quot; (&quot;atol de piña&quot;) is also consumed in El Salvador. Guatemalan varieties include &quot;atol shuco&quot; (&quot;dirty&quot; &quot;atol&quot;, a reference to its darker color), particularly popular in the city.

===Guatemala===
In Guatemala, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development provided funding to INCAP to carry out a community randomized trial to test the hypothesis that improved protein intakes lead to better child development test scores. They were given a high-protein atole-like beverage made from INCAPARINA (a vegetable protein mixture developed by INCAP which mainly contains corn), dry skim milk, sugar, and a flavoring agent.

===New Mexico===
In many parts of Mexico and in the United States in communities with Indigenous, Hispanic, or Mexican cultural roots, &quot;atole&quot; is a traditional comfort food. It is often eaten as a breakfast or an after dinner snack on cold days.

In New Mexico, blue corn &quot;atole&quot; is finely ground cornmeal toasted for cooking, consumed as a grainy porridge-style drink served warm, usually sweetened with sugar or thinned with milk. It is usually served at breakfast like cream of wheat or oatmeal. Elders are said to have drunk &quot;atole&quot; because it gave them energy. A mother who is nursing will drink &quot;atole&quot; to give her more milk.

The Puebloan peoples of New Mexico sometimes call &quot;atole&quot; &quot;chaquehue&quot; or &quot;chaquewa&quot;.

The Ancestral Puebloans began to cultivate corn around 2000 BCE, and used advanced irrigation ditches as early as 205 CE. Later, during the time of Spanish colonialization, blue corn was irrigated by Moorish-influenced acequia systems. The Hopi plant blue corn seeds in bundles of several seeds to one hole, sometimes quite deep to reach ground water.

Atole porridge is called mush by the Diné, and includes the addition of juniper ash. It is called &quot;wataca&quot; by the Hopi. Atole flour is used to create Hopi piki bread.

==Cultural references==
The beverage is referenced in the Spanish idiom &quot;dar atole con el dedo&quot; (&quot;to give &quot;atole&quot; with the thumb&quot;), which means to placate with deception. It may originate from the idea of wet nurses using &quot;atole&quot; on their thumbs to placate infants; alternatively, it may refer to the practice of distributing tamales and &quot;atole&quot; during periods of drought in pre-Columbian Mexico.

<doc id="1266521" wikidata="Q8011847" url="?curid=1266521" title="William Henderson (American football)">
<text>William Terrelle Henderson (born February 19, 1971) is an American former professional football player who was a fullback for 12 seasons with the Green Bay Packers of the National Football League (NFL), with whom he won Super Bowl XXXI against the New England Patriots. He played college football for the North Carolina Tar Heels, and was chosen by the Packers in the third round of the 1995 NFL draft.

==Early life and college==
Henderson attended Thomas Dale High School in Chester, Virginia. He played varsity football as a freshman, sophomore, and junior, but sat out his senior year due to a knee injury.

At the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Henderson finished his career with 145 carries for 750 yards (5.17 yards per carry avg.) and 14 receptions for 97 yards (6.93 yards per rec. avg.).

==Professional career==
Henderson was drafted by the Green Bay Packers in 1995, and played every season in his career with the Packers. He came into the league as number 30, but after cornerback Doug Evans left, changed his number to 33.

Henderson was durable and effective for the Packers, solidifying the team at fullback after moving into the starting role in 1996. Nine times in his first 11 seasons he played in all 16 games. He was selected to 2004 Pro Bowl. His consistent play, especially in his later years, had many Packer players and fans calling him &quot;Old Reliable.&quot;

Henderson played in 188 games for the Green Bay Packers putting him in 5th place for &quot;Most Games Played&quot; in the team&#x27;s history. Only Brett Favre (255) Donald Driver (205), Bart Starr (196) and Ray Nitschke (190) played in more games for the Packers. He also blocked for six of the top nine individual rushing efforts in team annals — Dorsey Levens&#x27; 1,435 yards in 1997 (third), Ahman Green&#x27;s 1,883 in 2003 (first), 1,387 in 2001 (fourth), 1,240 in 2002 (sixth), 1,175 in 2000 (seventh) and 1,163 in 2004 (ninth). Henderson would be the lead blocker for a 1,000-yard running back for 9 of his 12 NFL seasons, for three different running backs: Edgar Bennett, Dorsey Levens, and Ahman Green.

Henderson was also valuable as pass catcher out of the backfield. As of 2008, he stands tenth all-time on the Packers&#x27; career receptions list with 320 (for 2,409 yards), and first among running backs. He also has 123 career rushing attempts for 426 yards.

On March 7, 2007, the Packers released Henderson amidst rumors that the Packers were trying to sign fullback Justin Griffith. GM Ted Thompson released the following statement. &quot;We are releasing William at this point so he can pursue other opportunities within the National Football League,&quot; GM Ted Thompson said. &quot;The Packers organization is extremely appreciative of his efforts over the past 12 seasons. His leadership and work ethic set an excellent example for everyone in our locker room. It is difficult to part with a high-character individual like William. He has been an influential person on several outstanding Packers teams over his career. He always will be considered a Packer.&quot; He was inducted into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame in 2011.

==Broadcasting career==
Henderson has eight years (1999–2006) of broadcasting experience as co-host of Monday Night Kickoff, a show produced by Green Bay TV station WBAY. He also worked as an analyst as part of ESPN&#x27;s NFL draft coverage April 2006.

Henderson resides in Richmond, Virginia. He was selected as Green Bay&#x27;s 2001 &#x27;Unsung Hero,&#x27; in recognition of his efforts both on the field and in the community.

<doc id="1266525" wikidata="Q15130619" url="?curid=1266525" title="British Household Panel Survey">
<text>The British Household Panel Survey (BHPS), carried out at the Institute for Social and Economic Research of the University of Essex, is a survey for social and economic research. A sample of British households was drawn and first interviewed in 1991. The members of these original households have since been followed and annually interviewed. The resulting data base is very popular among social scientists for quantitative analyses of social and economic change. One of the most important precursors of the BHPS is the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), established in the 1960s at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (US). The initial BHPS sample consisted of 10,300 individuals across Great Britain. Additional samples were recruited in Scotland and Wales in 1999 and the study was extended to Northern Ireland in 2001.

As a panel survey it is a form of longitudinal study. The BHPS was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council from its inception in 1989 until 2008. Since 2008, the BHPS has been integrated into Understanding Society: the UK Household Longitudinal Study, still run from ISER.

BHPS data are integrated into the European Community Household Panel and the Cross National Equivalent File (CNEF) which contains panel data from Australia, Canada, Germany, Great Britain and the United States.

<doc id="1266530" wikidata="Q2152208" url="?curid=1266530" title="Riemann (crater)">
<text>Riemann (pronounced &quot;REE mahn&quot;) is a lunar impact crater that is located near the northeastern limb of the Moon, and can just be observed edge-on when libration effects bring it into sight. It lies to the east-northeast of the large walled plain Gauss. To the southeast, beyond sight on the far side, is the crater Vestine.

This is a heavily battered and eroded formation that is only a remnant of its former self. The outer rim has been worn away in many places, and now forms an irregular series of ridges in a rough circle. The rim is overlain along the south-southwestern rim by Beals, and several smaller craters lie along the western and southeast rim. The most intact portion of the outer wall is along the eastern edge.

The interior floor is a mixture of level terrain mixed with rough ground where impacts have stirred up the surface. It is generally less rough in the eastern half, especially near the center. A small, bowl-shaped crater lies on the floor in the southeastern part of the interior, and the faint remnants of several other lesser craters can be observed in the surface.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Riemann.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.
* Riemann A — &quot;See&quot; Beals (crater).

<text>Matthew Bruce Mantei [MAN-tie] (born July 7, 1973) is an American former Major League Baseball relief pitcher. In his career, Mantei played with the Florida Marlins, Arizona Diamondbacks and Boston Red Sox. He batted and threw right-handed.

==Career==
Mantei had four pitches. He had two fastballs, one of which regularly hit 95 MPH and occasionally hit 100, a sharp curve and an occasional slider. He was also known to throw a knuckleball earlier in his career. Two issues concerning his play were his control and his ability for his arm to stay healthy.

Between 1995 and 1996, Mantei had only pitched in 26 games for the Marlins. He missed the 1997 season due to injury and came back in 1998 to post an ERA of 2.96 in 42 games.

After starting the 1999 season with the Florida Marlins and saving 10 games, he was traded to Arizona Diamondbacks in exchange for Vladimir Núñez, Brad Penny and Abraham Núñez. After posting 32 saves in between the two teams, Mantei finished 24th in NL MVP voting, earning three vote points. Mantei was slowed by injuries in and , when a right-elbow injury ended his season in April and he underwent Tommy John surgery ligament replacement surgery.

In , Mantei worked hard to regain his old form. Despite the fact that he missed a month in , he finished strong in the last three months of the season. He had 29 saves while posting a 2.62 ERA.

Mantei missed most of 2004 after a surgery to deal with bone spurs in his shoulder. In 12 games, he was 0–3 with an 11.81 ERA and four saves. At the end of the season he was signed by the Red Sox. 2005 was yet another injury-plagued season for Mantei, as he only pitched 26.3 innings before being placed on the disabled list for the remainder of the year.

Mantei was invited to the Detroit Tigers spring training camp in 2006 to make a comeback try. After suffering more arm troubles early in the spring, he left camp and was out of baseball until 2008.

Mantei threw a bullpen session for the Detroit Tigers on January 11, and signed a minor league contract with them. However, after experiencing discomfort in his arm a few games into spring training, he was released and retired on March 4.

In a ten-year career with Florida, Arizona, and Boston, Mantei owned a 14–18 record with a 4.07 ERA and 93 saves in 322.7 innings. He also compiled a 1.98 strikeout-to-walk ratio (396-to-200) and a 1.39 WHIP.

==Post MLB Career==
On March 4, 2014, Mantei and his family appeared on the History Channel program &quot;Counting Cars&quot;, commissioning a custom-restored 1953 Chevy truck.

<text>Darren Mallory Sharper (born November 3, 1975) is an American former professional football safety and convicted rapist who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 14 seasons. He played college football for the William &amp; Mary Tribe and was selected in the second round of the 1997 NFL draft by the Green Bay Packers, where he spent eight seasons. Sharper played his next four seasons with the Minnesota Vikings and his final two with the New Orleans Saints.

Recognized as one of the league&#x27;s top defensive backs during his career, Sharper was a five-time Pro Bowl selection and a two-time first-team All-Pro, along with being named to the second-team of the 2000s All-Decade Team. He ranks sixth in interceptions and is tied with Charles Woodson and Rod Woodson for the most defensive touchdowns.

Following Sharper&#x27;s 2010 retirement, allegations surfaced that he drugged and raped several women across various states, leading to him being charged in 2014. Sharper pled guilty to the rape and drug-related charges and was sentenced in 2016 to 20 years in prison. As a result of his guilty plea, he was removed from the College of William &amp; Mary Athletics Hall of Fame. Although the conviction did not disqualify his Pro Football Hall of Fame eligibility, Sharper never progressed beyond nomination in the voting process.
==Early life==
Sharper has an older sister, Monica, and an older brother, Jamie. The Sharpers attended Hermitage High School in Henrico County, Virginia. Jamie played for the high school football team as a linebacker. Darren played for the varsity football and basketball teams. He was named to the honor roll, had perfect attendance in three of his four years, and was active in the foreign language club and student council. Hermitage honored Sharper with a display on their &quot;Wall of Fame&quot;. Sharper graduated from Hermitage in 1993.
Following the rape allegations being substantiated, Hermitage removed all Sharper memorabilia from its school grounds.

==College career==
Sharper attended the College of William and Mary, where he played for the William &amp; Mary Tribe football team. In high school, Sharper primarily played quarterback. He wanted to be a quarterback at William &amp; Mary, as well. The college coach, Jimmye Laycock, hinted to him that, as an alternative, Sharper might join the NFL (as a defensive back). During his college career, he earned All-America honors twice and was named first-team All-Yankee Conference selection three times. As a senior in 1996, he was the Yankee Conference Defensive Player of the Year after intercepting 10 passes for a season. He finished his college career with a school record 24 career interceptions and a I-AA record 468 career interception return yards. He also set the school record with 1,027 career punt return yards.

On September 16, 2007, Sharper collected a season-high eight solo tackles, deflected two passes, and made two interceptions during a 20–17 overtime loss at the Detroit Lions in Week 2.

On May 3, 2010, the New Orleans Saints signed Sharper to a one-year, $2.25 million contract with a signing bonus of $75,000. Throughout training camp, Sharper competed to retain his position as the starting free safety against Malcolm Jenkins who was converted from cornerback.

On September 3, Sharper was placed on the physically unable to perform (PUP) list, causing him to miss the first six weeks of the 2010 NFL season. He was activated on October 24, but he later missed another two games after a further injury. Sharper finished the 2010 season with 16 combined tackles (11 solo) and a pass deflection in eight games and one start. He was selected as a second-team All Pro, despite having missed much of the season.

In August 2012, after retiring, Sharper worked briefly for WWL-TV as an analyst before leaving to take a position with NFL Network. On February 28, 2014, Sharper was officially fired from NFL Network in connection with his arrest for aggravated rape.

==NFL career statistics==
===Regular season===
==Convictions of rape and drug distribution==
===Allegations===
*On March 18, 2011, two women filed a criminal complaint against Sharper with the Miami Beach Police Department alleging they were possibly sexually assaulted after passing out at Sharper&#x27;s condo on his couch and waking up to find their underwear missing. The women were in Miami for spring break and were students from the University of Georgia. On March 17, 2011, the women had been brought to Sharper&#x27;s condo by a mutual friend, nightclub promoter Wascar Payano, and had passed out on Sharper&#x27;s couch. One of the women claimed she woke up to a man attempting to place his penis in her mouth, but pushed the man away. She stated that when she woke up again a man was lifting her dress. She immediately woke up her friend and told Payano about the incident. Both women discovered their underwear was missing and were taken to the hospital by Payano where they underwent rape examination. On March 23, 2011, Miami Beach Police Department closed the investigation five days after the incident. The Miami Beach Police Department&#x27;s records show no evidence the detective in charge of the case sent the rape kits for a detailed examination, had spoken to Darren Sharper, or had visited Sharper&#x27;s condo where the accuser said the assault had taken place.
*On February 2, 2013, Sharper was accused of helping drug a woman who was working as a model at a pre-Super Bowl party in New Orleans and was consequently raped by Sharper&#x27;s friend Brandon Licciardi. 
*On August 31, 2013, Sharper was accused of raping a woman in New Orleans.
*On September 23, 2013, Sharper was accused of drugging two women in New Orleans and raped them with his accomplice, Erik Nunez. One of the victims filed a report with the New Orleans Police Department. Sharper and his friend, Erik Nunez, raped the women.
*On October 30, 2013, Sharper was accused of drugging two women and raped one of the women in Los Angeles after meeting them in a West Hollywood night club and bringing them back to his hotel room. On November 7, 2013, the victim filed a police report with the Los Angeles Police Department.
*On November 20, 2013, Sharper, after meeting three female Arizona State University students in Tempe, Arizona, was accused of raping two of them after drugging them. Both women immediately underwent assault examinations within 12 hours of the assault and filed a police report with the Tempe Police Department.
*On January 14, 2014, Sharper, after meeting two women in West Hollywood night clubs and taking them to his hotel room, was accused of drugging them and raping one of them. Both victims reported the incident to the Los Angeles Police Department and underwent rape examinations.
*On January 15, 2014, after meeting two women and a man in a nightclub in Las Vegas, Sharper was accused of drugging all three, before taking the women to his hotel room and sexually assaulting both of them.

===Prosecutions===
====California state====
On January 17, 2014, Sharper was arrested in Los Angeles on two separate counts of sexual assault. The incidents were said to have happened in October 2013 and January 2014.

On February 14, 2014, Sharper was officially charged with two counts of rape, by use of drugs, and five related felony counts. Sharper was released on $200,000 bond, which at the request of the prosecution was raised to $1,000,000. Sharper pleaded not guilty to the charges. Conditions of his bail required him not to frequent any drinking establishment, as well as not to be alone with any women he had no relationship with prior to October 13, 2013, the date of his first alleged rape described in the indictment. Sharper faced up to 30 years in prison if convicted of all counts.

====Louisiana state and federal====
In January 2014, &quot;USA Today&quot; reported the New Orleans Police Department was investigating a sexual assault allegation against Sharper which was filed on September 24, 2013.

Officials in Orleans Parish, Louisiana, filed two charges of aggravated rape against Sharper and another two counts against Erik Nunez, 26, on February 27, 2014, related to the alleged September 2013 incident in New Orleans. Investigators said a second woman came forward with a complaint following an initial report shortly after the alleged rape. WDSU noted, &quot;Louisiana law states that a person convicted of committing aggravated rape shall be punished by life imprisonment at hard labor without benefit of parole, probation or suspension of sentence.&quot; Also on February 27, 2014, Sharper surrendered to the police in Los Angeles after an arrest warrant was issued by the authorities in Louisiana.

On December 12, 2014, an Orleans Parish grand jury indicted Sharper on two counts of aggravated rape, stating that, if convicted, he will face a mandatory life sentence. On the same day, a federal grand jury in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana returned an indictment for conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance (1 count) and distribution of a controlled substance (2 counts).

====Arizona state====
On March 12, 2014, Sharper was charged with sexual assault in Arizona. Under Arizona state law, a person commits sexual assault by knowingly engaging in sexual intercourse or oral sexual contact with another person without that person&#x27;s consent. No consent was given if the victim was incapable of consenting by reason of drugs, alcohol, sleep, or a similar impairment, and such impairment was known or should have been known to the defendant.

====Nevada state====
On March 20, 2015, Sharper was charged with two sexual assaults in Las Vegas. The purported crimes took place in January 2014 and involved two women. Nevada state legislation provides that a person subjecting another person to sexual penetration against that person&#x27;s will, or under conditions in which the perpetrator knows
or should know that the victim is mentally or physically incapable of resisting or understanding the nature of the perpetrator&#x27;s conduct, is guilty of sexual assault. The notion of sexual penetration includes sexual intercourse in its ordinary meaning.

===Guilty pleas and sentencing===
====California and Arizona====
Later on March 20, Sharper&#x27;s lawyer said that Sharper had reached a plea agreement to resolve all of the charges against him. He appeared in court in Los Angeles on March 23 to enter guilty pleas to sexual assault in Arizona, by video-conferencing, and no contest in California to raping two women he knocked out with a potent sedative mixed with alcohol. The Arizona judge sentenced him immediately to nine years in prison, with no chance for early release.

On November 29, 2016, Sharper was sentenced to 20 years in prison by Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor. Sharper&#x27;s plea deal allows serving half that time, minus time already served. As a non-violent criminal, Sharper might also be eligible for parole since raping an intoxicated person is a non-violent crime in the state of California.

====Nevada====
On March 24, 2015, Sharper pleaded guilty to a single count of attempted sexual assault on two women in Las Vegas. He agreed to serve three to eight years for this crime. He was formally sentenced on October 27, 2016.

====Louisiana and federal====
On May 29, 2015, Sharper pleaded guilty, in federal court, to conspiracy to distribute alprazolam (Xanax), diazepam (Valium) and zolpidem (Ambien) with intent to commit rape and two counts of distributing these substances with intent to commit rape. He accepted a nine-year sentence in a plea deal for all charges against him. However, on February 18, 2016, U.S. District Judge Jane Triche-Milazzo rejected the deal saying, &quot;This court cannot accept this plea agreement&quot;, and noted that a federal pre-sentence report called for a range of 15–20 years. On March 22, 2016, judge Triche-Milazzo approved a new deal under which the proposed length of imprisonment fits the above range.

On August 18, 2016, Sharper was sentenced to 220 months (18 years and 4 months) of incarceration, followed by 3 years of supervised release, and a $20,000 fine. The following week, he was sentenced by a Louisiana State judge to 20 years in prison, stemming from three counts of rape.

All imprisonments will run concurrently. Time served will count towards every charge in every state as if running all at the same time. Once out of prison, Sharper must register as a sex offender and comply with a &quot;sex treatment condition&quot;, as part of the 3-year supervision program. Court records list the total of 9 victims involved, nationwide. But, according to the judge, there may be as many as 16.

=== Incarceration ===
Sharper is imprisoned in FCI Miami with BOP# 34209-034. He is scheduled to be released in late 2028.

===Co-defendants===
Two accomplices — Brandon Licciardi of Meraux, Louisiana and Erik Nunez of New Orleans — pleaded guilty in connection with the alleged drug-and-rape plot. Licciardi is a former sheriff&#x27;s deputy in the New Orleans suburb of St. Bernard Parish. He had been on the force since 2002, but resigned after charges were filed.

On February 27, 2014, Nunez was arrested and charged, in state court, with two counts of aggravated rape purportedly taking place September 23, 2013, at Sharper&#x27;s residence in New Orleans. Additionally, he was charged with obstruction of justice between September 23, 2013, and February 28, 2014.

On December 12, 2014, Licciardi was indicted by a federal grand jury on six criminal counts including tampering with a witness (2 counts), impeding an investigation, conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance, and
distribution of a controlled substance (2 counts).

On February 6, 2015, Licciardi pleaded innocent to state charges against him, including aggravated rape on February 2, 2013, and three counts of human trafficking to facilitate sexual conduct. Additionally, he was charged with battery using a dangerous weapon.

On July 24, 2015, Nunez was federally charged with conspiracy to impede an investigation. On July 11, 2016, in exchange for a 10-year sentence, he pleaded guilty, before judge Triche-Milazzo, to conspiracy to distribute controlled substances without victim&#x27;s knowledge and with the intent to commit a sexual battery, to which he entered two separate guilty pleas in a state court of Louisiana. Under Louisiana state law, sexual battery includes touching of the victim&#x27;s private body parts while the victim is incapable of understanding the nature of the act, and this inability is, or should have been, known to the defendant.

On July 15, 2016, Licciardi pleaded guilty, before the same judge, to conspiracy to distribute controlled substances with the intent to commit crimes of violence, including rape. In state court, he pleaded guilty to three counts of human trafficking and one count of forcible rape. He agreed to a 17-year prison sentence.

On October 20, 2016, both men were formally sentenced by the federal court. On October 27, they were sentenced on Louisiana state charges. Criminal District Judge Karen Herman ordered that each defendant&#x27;s prison term mirror and run concurrently with his federal sentence.

===Analysis===
Since February 27, 2014 – Sharper&#x27;s last day at liberty – the lingering question was how he managed to hurt at least nine women over many months and still avoid incarceration despite investigation being already underway.

A criminal justice official speculated that the answer may lie in the perpetrator&#x27;s high social and financial status affording him well-qualified lawyers prosecutors hesitated to confront. &quot;If his name was John Brown, he would have been in jail&quot;, the official said. &quot;If a woman says, &#x27;He&#x27;s the guy that raped me,&#x27; and you have corroborating evidence to show they were together and she went to the hospital and she can identify him, that guy goes to jail&quot;.

Another official elaborated: &quot;The D.A.&#x27;s position and the administration&#x27;s position was, because this was a high-profile case, we want to make sure we do this the right way. It was mainly because of the celebrity-ness&quot;.

Over time, Sharper&#x27;s actions became more and more sophisticated. He did not make self-incriminating statements. He traveled often. His criminal activity spanned four states, making it hard to detect. Prescription sedatives mixed with alcohol made the victims unconscious and unable to remember, undermining their credibility with the police.

===Further proceedings===
In July 2019, Sharper filed a motion to undo his 2016 plea deal arguing that he was not adequately advised by his previous lawyers on the consequences of his guilty plea. However, the judge dismissed his motion citing that Sharper had twice admitted in open court that he understood the terms of his plea agreement.

<text>Crozier is a lunar impact crater that is located on the southwest edge of Mare Fecunditatis, a lunar mare in the eastern part of the Moon&#x27;s near side. It lies to the east-northeast of the prominent crater Colombo, and southeast of the small crater Bellot.

The narrow rim of this crater forms a distorted enclosure that has outward bulges along the northwest, southwest, and southeastern sides. The interior floor has been resurfaced and nearly filled by basaltic lava, producing a level surface with a low albedo that matches the dark hue of the nearby lunar mare. Nearly adjacent to the outer rim are the similar flooded craters Crozier D to the east and Crozier M to the southeast.

The crater is named after Irish Royal Navy officer and polar explorer Francis Crozier.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Crozier.

<text>Robert J. Gallery (born July 26, 1980) is an American former professional football player who was an offensive guard who played for eight seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the University of Iowa and received unanimous All-American recognition. He was selected with the second overall pick by the Oakland Raiders in the 2004 NFL draft. He also played for the Seattle Seahawks.

==Early life==
Gallery was born in Manchester, Iowa. He attended East Buchanan High School in Winthrop, Iowa and starred in football, basketball and track. In football, he played tight end and linebacker and also handled punting and kickoff duties. He was an all-conference honorable mention selection as a sophomore before being named first-team all-conference as a junior and senior. Gallery helped his high-school team to a three-year record of 24–8, including a 19–2 record in district play. He was a &quot;Des Moines Register&quot; Class 1A first-team all-state selection as a senior. In addition to his athletic accomplishments, Gallery earned the rank of Eagle Scout.

==College career==
Gallery attended the University of Iowa and played for the Hawkeyes football team from 1999 to 2003. His older brother Nick had been an All-Big Ten punter for the Hawkeyes, and his younger brother John later became a punter for the team. After redshirting in 1999, Gallery had three catches for 52 yards as a starting tight end as a freshman before moving to the tackle position. He started six games at the right tackle position as a freshman.

As a sophomore, Gallery started every game at left tackle and made vast improvements throughout the year. He helped Iowa lead the Big Ten Conference in scoring in 2001 as Iowa qualified for its first bowl game in four years. As a junior in 2002, Gallery started all 13 games at left tackle and was a first-team All-Big Ten selection. He helped lead Iowa to its first Big Ten title in 12 years and its first undefeated conference season in 80 years. He also won the team&#x27;s Hustle Award.

In 2003, Gallery led Iowa to another 10-win season and was voted as Iowa&#x27;s co-captain and co-MVP for the season. He was a first-team All-Big Ten selection for the second straight year and named the Big Ten offensive lineman of the year. He was recognized as a unanimous first-team All-American as a senior in 2003. He was awarded the 2003 Outland Trophy, making him the third lineman from Iowa to win the award (along with Alex Karras and Cal Jones). He was also a three-time academic All-Big Ten selection at Iowa.

Gallery graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in education. As part of his pre-professional training, he taught at two local elementary schools.

On January 9, 2023, the College Football Hall of Fame selected Gallery for induction into the 2023 Class.

==Professional career==
===Oakland Raiders===
Gallery was selected with the second overall pick in the 2004 NFL draft by the Oakland Raiders. He was regarded as &quot;the best lineman to come out of college in years&quot;, with a perfect 9.0 prospect rating, the highest for any offensive lineman.

In 2004, Gallery started 15 games at right tackle and surrendered three sacks. In 2005, he started all 16 games at right tackle and allowed 3.5 sacks. The Raiders moved him to left tackle at the beginning of the 2006 preseason. In the Raiders&#x27; first game of the 2006 regular season, Gallery was part of an offensive line that surrendered nine sacks (at least three of which were charged to him) to the San Diego Chargers. He played in 13 games during the season and allowed 10.5 sacks, placing him fourth in the league despite missing three games. In 2007, Oakland moved Gallery to left guard.

Although Gallery had generally been considered a bust at the left tackle position for which he was selected and had limited success at the right tackle position, his performance improved as a left guard.

===Seattle Seahawks===
On July 27, 2011, Gallery agreed to join the Seattle Seahawks on a three-year deal worth a reported $15 million. He was released after one season.

===New England Patriots===
On March 19, 2012, Gallery signed with the New England Patriots on a one-year deal. Gallery announced his retirement from professional football on August 4, 2012.

<doc id="1266556" wikidata="Q3870245" url="?curid=1266556" title="Napoleon Harris">
<text>Napoleon Bill Harris III (born February 25, 1979) is an American politician and former professional football player who has been a member of the Illinois Senate representing the 15th district since 2013. The 15th district stretches from Blue Island in the north, Calumet City in the east, Homewood in the west, Steger in the south, and includes all or parts of Crete-Monee, Dolton, Flossmoor, Glenwood, Thornton, Dixmoor, Markham, Midlothian, Oak Forest, Harvey, Riverdale, and South Holland.

Prior to his service in the Illinois Senate, he played as a linebacker for seven seasons in the National Football League (NFL) with the Oakland Raiders, the Minnesota Vikings, and Kansas City Chiefs at various times.

==Early life==
Harris grew up in Dixmoor, Illinois. He attended Lincoln Elementary School, Rosa L. Parks Middle School, and Thornton Township High School. He was a tri-star athlete and honor student. His father died his junior year of high school.

Harris was an honors student at Thornton Township High School in Harvey, Illinois and lettered in football and basketball. In football, he posted 23 sacks, 98 tackles, two fumble recoveries, 1 forced fumble, two safeties, and one interception and was named the Defensive Player of the Year by the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, &quot;Star Publications&quot;, &quot;Daily Southtown&quot;, and the &quot;Hammond Times&quot;. Napoleon also averaged 18 points and 10 rebounds on the No. 1 basketball team in the country.

Harris enrolled at Northwestern University, where he played college football for the Northwestern Wildcats. For one year, he was a two sport athlete playing basketball. His complete college career ranked 11th on Northwestern&#x27;s all-time tackles list with 334. All-Big Ten Conference as a senior after starting all 11 games at defensive end after moving from outside linebacker and ranked fourth on team in tackles with 78.

==NFL career==
Harris was selected in the first round of the 2002 draft by the Oakland Raiders, the 23rd overall pick. That year, he started 13 of 16 regular-season games, all three playoff games, and Super Bowl XXXVII for the Oakland Raiders and was named to the &quot;Pro Football Weekly&quot; All-Rookie team.

In 2005, Harris was acquired by the Minnesota Vikings as part of blockbuster trade which sent Randy Moss to Oakland for the seventh overall pick and a seventh-round pick in the 2005 NFL draft. The Vikings used the picks to select wide receiver Troy Williamson and cornerback Adrian Ward. Despite being traded for one of the premier players in the National Football League, Harris did not immediately live up to his potential the following season with the Minnesota Vikings. In that first season with the Vikings, he was hampered with a lingering knee injury and saw limited playing time. However, in the second season he finished second on the team with 96 tackles, 3 interceptions, 3.5 sacks and 2 fumble recoveries in 14 games.

On March 6, 2007, Harris agreed to a six-year deal with the Kansas City Chiefs. The Chiefs released Harris on October 14, 2008. Just two days after his release from the Chiefs, Harris re-joined the Minnesota Vikings on October 16. Harris started in 5 of the 10 games he played and finished his second stint with the Vikings with 32 tackles and 1 sack, and also scored his first NFL touchdown after returning a fumble 27 yards in week 12 in Jacksonville. Despite a fairly good performance, the Vikings did not hold on to him.

In May 2008, Napoleon appeared on The CW Network series &quot;The Game&quot;. Harris signed a one-year contract with the Oakland Raiders on August 24, 2009, after the team released cornerback Ricky Manning, but was released five days later.

<doc id="1266559" wikidata="Q5364854" url="?curid=1266559" title="Ellen Goodman">
<text>Ellen Goodman (born April 11, 1941) is an American journalist and syndicated columnist. She won a Pulitzer Prize in 1980. She is also a speaker and commentator.

==Career==
Goodman&#x27;s career began as a researcher and reporter for &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine between 1963 and 1965. She was a reporter at the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; starting in 1965 and has worked as an associate editor at &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; since 1967. Her column was syndicated by The Washington Post Writers Group in 1976.

In 1996, she taught at Stanford University as the first Lorry I. Lokey Visiting professor in Professional Journalism.
In 1998, Goodman received the Elijah Parish Lovejoy Award as well as an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Colby College. She compared &quot;anthropogenic warming deniers&quot; to holocaust deniers. She announced her retirement in her final column, which ran on January 1, 2010.

==Education==
Goodman attended Brookline High School in Brookline, Massachusetts for two years and graduated in 1959 from Buckingham School, now Buckingham Browne &amp; Nichols. She graduated cum laude from Radcliffe College in 1963 with a degree in modern European history. A year later, she returned to Harvard as a Nieman Fellow. At Harvard, Goodman studied the dynamics of social change. In 2007, Goodman studied gender and the news at John F. Kennedy School of Government where she was a Shorenstein Fellow.

==Personal life==
Goodman was born to a Jewish family in Newton, Massachusetts, to Jackson Jacob Holtz, and Edith (née Weinstein) Holtz. Her elder sister was the late critic and author Jane Holtz Kay. She married her first husband, Anthony Goodman, in 1963 and in 1968, gave birth to their daughter Katie Goodman, a musical comedian. After the couple divorced, she married &quot;Boston Globe&quot; journalist Robert Levey in 1982. Her stepson, Gregory Levey, died by self-immolation in 1991 protesting the First Gulf War.

==Awards==
Goodman won the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary in 1980. Another accolade is the American Society of Newspaper Editors&#x27; (now the American Society of News Editors) Distinguished Writing Award (1980). In 1988, Goodman won the Hubert H. Humphrey Civil Rights Award from the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.

She was awarded the President&#x27;s Award by the National Women&#x27;s Political Caucus in 1993. A year later, she was given the American Woman Award by the Women&#x27;s Research &amp; Education Institute. In 2008, she won the Ernie Pyle Award for Lifetime Achievement from the National Society of Newspaper Columnists. She was awarded the Ashoka Fellowship in 2014 for her work.

<doc id="1266561" wikidata="Q456210" url="?curid=1266561" title="Cold frame">
<text>In agriculture and gardening, a cold frame is a transparent-roofed enclosure, built low to the ground, used to protect plants from adverse weather, primarily excessive cold or wet. The transparent top admits sunlight and prevents heat escape via convection that would otherwise occur, particularly at night. Essentially, a cold frame functions as a miniature greenhouse to extend the growing season.

Historically, cold frames were built to be used in addition to a heated greenhouse. The name itself exemplifies the distinction between the warm greenhouse and the unheated cold frame. They were frequently built as part of the greenhouse&#x27;s foundation brickwork along the southern wall (in northern latitudes). This allowed seeds to be germinated in the greenhouse and then easily moved to the attached cold frame to be &quot;hardened-off&quot; before final planting outside. Cold frames are similar to some enclosed hotbeds, also called hotboxes. The difference is in the amount of heat generated inside. This is parallel to the way that some greenhouses are called &quot;hothouses&quot; to emphasize their higher temperature, achieved either by the solar effects alone or by auxiliary heating via a heater or HVAC system of some kind.

Cold frames are found in home gardens and in vegetable farming. They create microclimates that provide several degrees of air and soil temperature insulation, and shelter from wind. In cold-winter regions, these characteristics allow plants to be started earlier in the spring, and to survive longer into the fall and winter. They are most often used for growing seedlings that are later transplanted into open ground, and can also be a permanent home to cold-hardy vegetables grown for autumn and winter harvest.

==Construction==
Cold frame construction is a common home or farm building project, although kits and commercial systems are available. A traditional plan makes use of old glass windows: a wooden frame is built, about one to two feet tall, and the window placed on top. The roof is often sloped towards the winter sun to capture more light, and to improve runoff of water, and hinged for easy access. Clear plastic, rigid or sheeting, can be used in place of glass. An electric heating cable, available for this purpose, can be placed in the soil to provide additional heat.

==Uses==
Cold frames can be used to extend the growing season for many food and ornamental crops, primarily by providing increased warmth in early spring. This means that it&#x27;s possible to harvest vegetable crops ahead of their normal season when they are extremely expensive to buy. Some crops suitable for growing in a cold frame include lettuces, parsley, salad onions, spinach, radishes and turnips etc. One vegetable crop can occupy the whole of a cold frame or a combination of crops can be grown so that they mature in rotation in order to get a wide range of different vegetables throughout the year from a single cold frame.

==Bulb frame==

A &quot;bulb frame&quot; is a specialized kind of cold frame, designed for growing hardy or almost hardy ornamental bulbous plants, particularly in climates with wet winters. Typically it is raised further above ground level than a normal cold frame, so that the plants can be seen better when in flower. They are often used for the cultivation of winter-growing bulbs which flower in the autumn or spring. The covers are used in winter to provide some protection from very bad weather, while allowing good ventilation. Then in the summer, the covers provide dry, warm conditions which many such bulbs need.

<doc id="1266563" wikidata="Q5877236" url="?curid=1266563" title="Hogg (novel)">
<text>Hogg is a novel by American author Samuel R. Delany, written in 1969 and completed in 1995. The novel deals graphically with themes of murder, child molestation, incest, coprophilia, coprophagia, urolagnia, anal-oral contact, necrophilia and rape. It was conceptualized and written in 1969, with a further draft completed in 1973, and it was finally published with some further, though relatively minor, rewrites in 1995 by Black Ice Books. Two later editions have featured some corrections, the last of which, published by Fiction Collective Two in 2004, carries a note from Delany stating that it is definitive.

==Content==

===Preface===
The preface to the novel is titled &quot;The Scorpion Garden&quot;. It is not included in the hardback edition from 1995, although it was written in 1973. It is included in &quot;The Straits of Messina&quot; (1989).

===Description===
These acts include a substantial amount of &quot;rape, violence, and murder&quot;, such as &quot;scenes of Hogg and his gang brutally raping various women&quot; and other &quot;extensive scenes involving consumption of bodily waste.&quot; Every chapter in the novel contains graphic sexual or violent acts.

===Setting===
The main events of the novel take place on June 26, 27, and 28, 1969, in an unspecified city. The narrator mentions various nearby areas—&quot;Crawhole,&quot; &quot;Frontwater,&quot; and &quot;Ellenville&quot;—apparently fictional neighborhoods. The nameless city is described as an industrial wasteland. The events take place at docks, garbage barges, truck-stops, bars, as well as within Hogg&#x27;s truck. Many of the characters are described as workmen or wear work clothes.

In an interview with TK Enright, Delany states &quot;&quot;[Hogg&#x27;s]&quot; action takes place in Pornotopia—that is the land where any situation can become rampantly sexual under the least increase in the pressure of attention. Like its sister lands, Comedia and Tragedia, it can only be but so realistic.&quot; In the same interview Delany also states, &quot;&quot;Hogg&quot; is another of my stories that takes place in the city of Enoch.&quot; Delany&#x27;s &quot;Neveryóna&quot; takes place, in part, in Enoch.

===Plot summary===
At the start, the narrator is living with a Hispanic boy named Pedro and performing sex acts with older men in the basement of the dwelling for money, along with Pedro&#x27;s teenage sister Maria. He engages in sex with Maria, Pedro, a gang of bikers, and a group of Black men. The narrator consistently assumes the bottom role in these sex acts. One out of the group of Black men chooses the narrator specifically, remarking that he appears of possible part-Black ancestry.

The second chapter takes place sometime after the narrator has left Pedro&#x27;s. It introduces Hogg, first seen raping a woman in an alley. Hogg calls the narrator to him to &quot;finish him up&quot; orally. Hogg takes the narrator to his truck where he explains that while he is a trucker by trade, he prefers getting paid to rape women. Hogg also reveals a bit about himself and his personal history, painting a picture of his overall persona, which is one of extreme sociopathy, violence, and sexual sadism. They drive to meet Mr. Jonas, who despite his apparent wealth answers his own door and later is revealed to drive his own limousine. Mr. Jonas is Hogg&#x27;s current client. After Mr. Jonas describes Hogg&#x27;s next assignment Hogg states his intention to bring along several other men, and the narrator as well, to participate. At this point the narrator&#x27;s place as Hogg&#x27;s companion is solidly established.

Hogg and the narrator meet the other men—Nigg, Wop, and Denny—at the Piewacket bar. Nigg turns out to be the black man who the narrator first encountered at the beginning of the story. Wop is a violent Italian-American workman. Denny is a rather shy teenage boy, older than the narrator but quite a bit younger than the other men. The quintet of rapists set out to complete their jobs, which grow in succession from a single woman, a woman and her wheelchair-using daughter, and a nuclear family—mother, father and son. Each successive job increases in violence, and the victims&#x27; young children (male and female) are also descended on by the pack. During the third rape scene, Denny absconds to the family&#x27;s kitchen where he decides to pierce his own penis using a nail. Soon Denny&#x27;s penis begins to bleed, swell and pus, seemingly infected. At this point he begins repeating the phrase &quot;it&#x27;s all right.&quot;

When their last job is completed, the group retires to the Piewacket bar, where they fraternize with members of the Phantoms—the same biker gang encountered in the beginning of the novel. Nigg and one of the bikers, Hawk, hatch a scheme to sell the narrator to a black tugboat captain called Big Sambo. Without consulting Hogg, all three ride away on Hawk&#x27;s motorcycle to meet Big Sambo at the docks in Crawhole. Big Sambo talks down the price and pays Nigg and Hawk fifteen dollars for the narrator. Big Sambo is a large, physically powerful tugboat operator who keeps his twelve-year-old daughter, Honey-Pie, around as a sex object for his own pleasure.

The narrator goes walking around the docks at night, where he overhears a radio on the deck of a garbage scow. The newscaster on the radio reports on a series of murders that has occurred recently—as it turns out, the suspect is Denny. This is confirmed to the reader when it is noted that the phrase &quot;it&#x27;s all right&quot; is written in blood at the crime scenes. The Piewacket bar, where the gang had previously hung out, was attacked by Denny with gunfire. Several people including the bartender and some bikers were killed.

On the docks the narrator then meets two garbagemen: Red, a red-headed white man, and Rufus, a black man. While having sex with the narrator outside, they plan to &quot;borrow&quot; the narrator from Big Sambo and keep him at their scow on a collar and leash. They are interrupted by Whitey, a cop who patrols the area, who also has sex with the narrator. Whitey is called down to the waterfront to help investigate the murders of Mona, Harry and their year-old baby. Rufus, Red and the narrator return to the waterfront where a radio crew has recently arrived and reports live from the scene. Big Sambo sees the narrator by the docks and tells him to return to his scow.

Hogg arrives at Big Sambo&#x27;s scow and assaults Big Sambo. Hogg and the narrator leave the docks in Hogg&#x27;s truck, in which Denny was hiding from the police. After driving out of the Crawhole area and getting clear of the law, Hogg commands Denny to bathe himself, dress in clean clothes, and hitch a ride to Florida. While driving back from the truck stop Hogg declares his intentions to spend the next few months with the narrator and expresses his happiness that they are reunited. However, the narrator is formulating a plan to leave Hogg at the next opportune moment. Hogg finally asks him &quot;What&#x27;s the matter?&quot; to which he responds, &quot;Nothin,&quot;—his only line of dialog in the novel.

The off-stage murder spree by Dennis &quot;Denny&quot; Harkner is described by radio reporter Edward Sawyer as &quot;an afternoon and evening long rampage...that threatens to outdo Starkweather, Speck, and Manson together.&quot; Later in the novel it is revealed that the spree took place on June 27, 1969, more than a month before the Tate murders were perpetrated by the Manson Family on August 8, 1969.

Michael Hemmingson wrote in the journal &quot;The Review of Contemporary Fiction&quot; that Hogg,

==Literary significance and criticism==
Despite the book&#x27;s infamous reputation, several respected authors have given it their endorsement. Norman Mailer, for instance, said &quot;There is no question that &quot;Hogg&quot; by Samuel R. Delany is a serious book with literary merit.&quot; J. G. Ballard, prolific speculative fiction author and elder statesman of transgressive literature, also praised Delany&#x27;s work, citing the medium of pornography as being the &quot;most political form of fiction.&quot;

Author Dennis Cooper said in his collection &quot;Smothered in Hugs: Essays, Interviews, Feedback, and Obituaries&quot; that &quot;&quot;Hogg&quot; is tiresome and indulgent&quot; and that the &quot;pace is molasses-slow&quot;. However, he also goes on to say that &quot;the book is a highly charged object...[and] that&#x27;s reason enough to recommend it.&quot; In the preface to a later edition of &quot;Smothered in Hugs&quot;, Cooper writes, &quot;I now think Samuel Delany&#x27;s &quot;Hogg&quot; is a great novel, and I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t realize that upon first reading.&quot;

Jeffrey A. Tucker, associate professor of English at the University of Rochester, comments in his critical study &quot;A sense of wonder: Samuel R. Delany, race, identity and difference&quot; that &quot;Hogg&quot; &quot;gave expression to the author&#x27;s hostility toward a heterosexist society, an anger that had no socially constructive outlet prior to the modern Gay Rights movement.&quot;

<text>The International was a named passenger train originally operated by the Great Northern Railway between King Street Station, Seattle, Washington, and Pacific Central Station, Vancouver, British Columbia between 1950 and 1971.

==Background==
In 1913, there were three pairs of trains operating on a Vancouver, BC to Portland, Oregon route in 12 to ; with the overnight train carrying the name The Owl. In addition, there was a Vancouver–Seattle local, a Bellingham–Rockport local, and a Vancouver–New Westminster mixed. The depression took its toll on these services; through Vancouver to Portland services were discontinued, with the Seattle to Portland segment being pooled with Northern Pacific Railway and the Union Pacific Railroad from 1925.

By 1928, the Vancouver to Seattle service had been reduced to three pairs of trains: 356/357 The Owl, 358/359 International Limited, and 360 The Canadian and 355 The American. (Odd train numbers were westbound by timetable, southbound by compass, even numbers were eastbound by timetable, northbound by compass). By Spring 1937, The Owl had been discontinued, with 355/358 being limited stop and 359/360 the locals. This arrangement persisted through World War II unit 1946 when service was expanded to three pair of trains: 359/360 became the Morning Puget Sounder, 355/358 the Afternoon Puget Sounder (all limited stop) and 356/357 were restored as the unnamed locals.

In June 1950, the GN replaced both heavyweight Puget Sounders with three streamlined Internationals, although only two trainsets were needed, as each set made one-and-one-half round trips daily. In February 1956, the locals were discontinued, and the &quot;Internationals&quot; were renumbered.

In May 1960, the evening &quot;International&quot; was discontinued; the noon service became known as the afternoon service. There was an upswing of traffic during the Century 21 Exposition (the 1962 Seattle World&#x27;s Fair); to cope with this extra traffic, the Great Northern bought several 56-seat coaches from the Chicago and North Western Railway that had become surplus after the discontinuation of some of the CNW&#x27;s &quot;400&quot; trains. These were placed in GN&#x27;s short-haul streamliners, which released long-haul coaches for the &quot;Empire Builder&quot; and the &quot;Western Star&quot;.

In 1966, the Great Northern took delivery of six EMD SDP40 locomotives for use on the &quot;Western Star&quot;; they were also used on the &quot;Internationals&quot; between the westbound &quot;Western Star&quot;’s arrival, and the eastbound departure. The following year, eight EMD SDP45 locomotives joined their ranks.

In June 1969, trains 357 and 358, the morning service was discontinued in Washington state, it was October before the Canadian authorities completed their approvals. In the meantime a Vancouver to White Rock, BC shuttle service operated, but the crew usually outnumbered the passengers – if there were any. Due to the schedules needed to maintain reasonable connections with the &quot;Empire Builder&quot; and the &quot;Coast Pool Trains&quot;, two trainsets were still required.

Trains 359 and 360 continued through the Burlington Northern Railroad merger of March 1970; BN renumbered them as trains 193 and 194. They finally expired fourteen months later as one of many trains discontinued on the startup of Amtrak on May 1, 1971. Amtrak would later operate the &quot;Pacific International&quot; over the same route 1972–1981. Service returned again in 1995 as the &quot;Mount Baker International,&quot; operated by Amtrak in partnership with the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT). Since 1998, the route has been part of the &quot;Amtrak Cascades&quot; service using leased Talgo Pendular equipment, with one round trip from Seattle to Vancouver and one from Portland to Vancouver.

<doc id="1266566" wikidata="Q2669953" url="?curid=1266566" title="Journalistic objectivity">
<text>Journalistic objectivity is a principle within the discussion of journalistic professionalism. Journalistic objectivity may refer to fairness, disinterestedness, factuality, and nonpartisanship, but most often encompasses all of these qualities. First evolving as a practice in the 18th century, a number of critiques and alternatives to the notion have emerged since, fuelling ongoing and dynamic discourse surrounding the ideal of objectivity in journalism.

Most newspapers and TV stations depend upon news agencies for their material, and each of the four major global agencies (Agence France-Presse (formerly the Havas agency), Associated Press, Reuters, and Agencia EFE) began with and continue to operate on a basic philosophy of providing a single objective news feed to all subscribers. That is, they do not provide separate feeds for conservative or liberal newspapers. Journalist Jonathan Fenby has explained the notion:

To achieve such wide acceptability, the agencies avoid overt partiality. The demonstrably correct information is their stock-in-trade. Traditionally, they report at a reduced level of responsibility, attributing their information to a spokesman, the press, or other sources. They avoid making judgments and steer clear of doubt and ambiguity. Though their founders did not use the word, objectivity is the philosophical basis for their enterprises – or failing that, widely acceptable neutrality.

Objectivity in journalism aims to help the audience make up their own mind about a story, providing the facts alone and then letting audiences interpret those on their own. To maintain objectivity in journalism, journalists should present the facts whether or not they like or agree with those facts. Objective reporting is meant to portray issues and events in a neutral and unbiased manner, regardless of the writer&#x27;s opinion or personal beliefs.

== Definitions ==
Sociologist Michael Schudson suggests that &quot;the belief in objectivity is a faith in &#x27;facts,&#x27; a distrust in &#x27;values,&#x27; and a commitment to their segregation&quot;. Objectivity also outlines an institutional role for journalists as a fourth estate, a body that exists apart from government and large interest groups.

Journalistic objectivity requires that a journalist not be on either side of an argument. The journalist must report only the facts and not a personal attitude toward the facts. While objectivity is a complex and dynamic notion that may refer to a multitude of techniques and practices, it generally refers to the idea of &quot;three distinct, yet interrelated, concepts&quot;: truthfulness, neutrality, and detachment.

Truthfulness is a commitment to reporting only accurate and truthful information, without skewing any facts or details to improve the story or better align an issue with any certain agenda. Neutrality suggests that stories be reported in an unbiased, even-handed, and impartial manner. Under this notion, journalists are to side with none of the parties involved, and simply provide the relevant facts and information of all. The third idea, detachment, refers to the emotional approach of the journalist. Essentially, reporters should not only approach issues in an unbiased manner but also with a dispassionate and emotionless attitude. Through this strategy, stories can be presented in a rational and calm manner, letting the audience make up their minds without any influences from the media.

== History ==
The modern notion of objectivity in journalism is largely due to the work of Walter Lippmann. Lippmann was the first to widely call for journalists to use the scientific method for gathering information. Lippmann called for journalistic objectivity after the excesses of yellow journalism. He noted that the yellows at the time had served their purpose, but that the people needed to receive the actual news, and not a &quot;romanticized version of it&quot;.

The term &quot;objectivity&quot; was not applied to journalistic work until the 20th century, but it had fully emerged as a guiding principle by the 1890s. Michael Schudson, among a number of other communication scholars and historians, agree that the idea of objectivity has prevailed in dominant discourse among journalists in the United States since the appearance of modern newspapers in the Jacksonian Era of the 1830s. These papers transformed the press amidst the democratization of politics, the expansion of a market economy, and the growing authority of an entrepreneurial, urban middle class. Before then, American newspapers were expected to present a partisan viewpoint, not a neutral one.

The need for objectivity first occurred to Associated Press editors who realized that partisanship would narrow their potential market. Their goal was to reach all newspapers and leave it to the individual papers to decide on what slanting and commentary were needed. Lawrence Gobright, the AP chief in Washington, explained the philosophy of objectivity to Congress in 1856:

My business is to communicate facts. My instructions do not allow me to make any comments upon the facts which I communicate. My dispatches are sent to papers of all manner of politics, and the editors say they are able to make their own comments upon the facts which are sent to them. I, therefore confine myself to what I consider legitimate news. I do not act as a politician belonging to any school, but try to be truthful and impartial. My dispatches are a merely dry matter of fact and detail.

In the first decade of the twentieth century, it was uncommon to see a sharp divide between facts and values. However, Stuart Allan (1997) suggests that, during World War I, scholar propaganda campaigns, as well as the rise of &quot;press agents and publicity experts&quot;, fostered the growing cynicism among the public towards state institutions and &quot;official channels of information&quot;. The elevation of objectivity thus constituted an effort to re-legitimatize the news-press, as well as the state in general.

Some historians, like Gerald Baldasty, have observed that objectivity went hand in hand with the need to make profits in the newspaper business by attracting advertisers. In this economic analysis, publishers did not want to offend any potential advertising clients and therefore encouraged news editors and reporters to strive to present all sides of an issue. Advertisers would remind the press that partisanship hurts circulation, and, consequently, advertising revenues—thus, objectivity was sought.

Others have proposed a political explanation for the rise of objectivity; scholars like Richard Kaplan have argued that political parties needed to lose their hold over the loyalties of voters and the institutions of government before the press could feel free to offer a nonpartisan, &quot;impartial&quot; account of news events. This change occurred following the critical 1896 election and the subsequent reform of the Progressive Era.

Later, during the period following World War II, the newly formalized rules and practices of objectivity led to a brief national consensus and temporary suspension of negative public opinion; however, doubts and uncertainties in &quot;the institutions of democracy and capitalism&quot; resurfaced in the period of civil unrest during the 1960s and 1970s, ultimately leading to the emergence of the &quot;critique&quot; of objectivity.

In conclusion, there are three key factors in the origin of objectivity. The transition from a political model of journalism to a commercial model requires the production of content that can be marketed across the political and ideological spectrum. The telegraph imposes pressures on journalists to prioritize the most important facts at the beginning of the story and adopt a simplified, homogenized and generic style that could appeal to geographically diverse audiences. In the early 20th century, journalism started to define itself as a professional occupation that required special training, unique skills and self-regulation according to ethical principles. Professionalization normalized the regime of objectivity as the foundation of good journalism, providing benefits to journalists and editors/publishers.

For most of the 19th century, most of the publications and news were written by one person. Writers could express their own perspectives and opinions. However, since the 1880s, Americans started to become interested in some scientific theories and facts which narrowed the ways that writers could express their feelings. The use of technology led to more productivity and control. New tech in the news process has worked to establish a discourse of speed. The discourse of speed has also become stronger and more encompassing over time. The transformation of the newspaper produced a medium requiring a fairly sophisticated team of many different kinds of laborers. Journalists are expected to possess technical skills in computer-based and new media technologies to some extent, placing new demands on journalists now.

== Criticisms ==
Some scholars and journalists criticize the understanding of objectivity as neutrality or nonpartisanship, arguing that it does a disservice to the public because it fails to attempt to find truth. They also argue that such objectivity is nearly impossible to apply in practice—newspapers inevitably take a point of view in deciding what stories to cover, which to feature on the front page, and what sources they quote. The media critics Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky have advanced a propaganda model hypothesis proposing that such a notion of objectivity results in heavily favoring government viewpoints and large corporations. Mainstream commentators accept that news value drives selection of stories, but there is some debate as to whether catering to an audience&#x27;s level of interest in a story makes the selection process non-objective.

Another example of an objection to objectivity, according to communication scholar David Mindich, was the coverage that the major papers (most notably the &quot;New York Times&quot;) gave to the lynching of thousands of African Americans during the 1890s. News stories of the period described the hanging, immolation and mutilation of people by mobs with detachment and, through the regimen of objectivity, news writers often attempted to construct a &quot;false balance&quot; of these accounts by recounting the alleged transgressions of the victims that provoked the lynch mobs to fury. Mindich suggests that by enabling practices of objectivity and allowing them to &quot;[go] basically unquestioned&quot;, it may have had the effect of normalizing the practice of lynching.

In a more recent example, scholars Andrew Calcutt and Phillip Hammond (2011) note that since the 1990s, war reporting (especially) has increasingly come to criticize and reject the practice of objectivity. In 1998, a BBC reporter, Martin Bell, noted that he favoured a &quot;journalism of attachment&quot;, over the previously sought after dispassionate approach. Similarly, a CNN war correspondent from the US, Christiane Amanpour, stated that in some circumstances &quot;neutrality can mean you are an accomplice to all sorts of evil&quot;. Each of these opinions stems from scholar&#x27;s and journalist&#x27;s critique of objectivity as too &quot;heartless&quot; or &quot;forensic&quot; to report the human natured and emotionally charged issues found in war and conflict reporting.

As discussed above, with the growth of mass media, especially from the 19th century, news advertising became the most important source of media revenue. Whole audiences needed to be engaged across communities and regions to maximize advertising revenue. This led to &quot;[j]ournalistic [o]bjectivity as an industry standard […] a set of conventions allowing the news to be presented as all things to all people&quot;. In modern journalism, especially with the emergence of 24-hour news cycles, speed is of the essence in responding to breaking stories. It is therefore not possible for reporters to decide &quot;from first principles&quot; how they will report each and every story that presents itself—thus, some scholars argue that mere convention (versus a true devotion to truth-seeking) has come to govern much of journalism.

Brent Cunningham, the managing editor of &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot;, argues in a 2003 article that objectivity excuses lazy reporting. He suggests that objectivity makes us passive recipients of news, rather than aggressive analyzers and critics of it. According to Cunningham, the nut of the tortured relationship with objectivity lies within a number of conflicting diktats that the press was subjected to operate under: be neutral yet investigative; be disengaged yet have an impact; and be fair-minded yet have an edge. Cunningham, however, argues that reporters by and large are not ideological warriors; rather, they are imperfect people performing a difficult job that is crucial to society and, &quot;[d]espite all our important and necessary attempts to minimize [individual&#x27;s] humanity, it can&#x27;t be any other way&quot;, Cunningham concludes.

The debate about objectivity has also occurred within the photojournalism field. In 2011, Italian photographer Ruben Salvadori challenged the expectation of objective truth that the general public associates to photojournalism with his project &quot;Photojournalism Behind the Scenes&quot;. By including the traditionally invisible photographer into the frame, Salvadori sought to ignite a discussion about the ethics of the profession, and indicate a need for audiences to be active viewers who understand and recognize the potential subjectivity of the photographic medium.

Another notion circulating around the critique of objectivity is proposed by scholar Judith Lichtenberg. She points to the logical inconsistency that arises when scholars or journalists criticize journalism for failing to be objective, while simultaneously proposing that &quot;there is no such thing&quot; as objectivity. Underpinning critiques of objectivity that arose in the 1970s and 1980s, this dual theory—which Lichtenberg refers to as a &quot;compound assault on objectivity&quot;—invalidates itself, as each element of the argument repudiates the other. Lichtenberg agrees with other scholars that view objectivity as mere conventional practice: she states that &quot;much of what goes under the name of objectivity reflects shallow understanding of it&quot;. Thus, she suggests that these practices, rather than the overall notion of objectivity (whose primary aim, according to Lichtenberg, is only to seek and pursue truth), should really be the target of critique.

Journalism scholars and media critics have used the term to criticize journalists&#x27; attempt to adopt a neutral and objective point of view in reporting, as if reporting &quot;from nobody&#x27;s point of view&quot;. Jay Rosen has argued that journalists may thereby disinform their audience by creating the impression that they have an authoritative impartiality between conflicting positions on an issue. Jeremy Iggers quoted Richard S. Salant, former president of CBS News, who stated: &quot;Our reporters do not cover stories from their point of view. They are presenting them from nobody&#x27;s point of view.&quot; Iggers called Salant&#x27;s assertion &quot;plainly incoherent, as is the notion of observations untouched by interpretation&quot;. Rosen has used the term to criticize journalists who hide behind the appearance of journalistic objectivity so as to gain an unearned position of authority or trust with their audience; he advocates for transparency as a better way of legitimately earning trust. Scholars such as Rosen and Jake Lynch borrowed the term from philosopher Thomas Nagel&#x27;s 1986 book &quot;The View from Nowhere&quot;, which stated, &quot;A view or form of thought is more objective than another if it relies less on the specifics of the individual&#x27;s makeup and position in the world.&quot; Many other news media commentators have also criticized the view from nowhere in journalism. Writer Elias Isquith argues in a 2014 article for &quot;Salon&quot; that &quot;the view from nowhere not only leads to sloppy thinking but actually leaves the reader &quot;less&quot; informed than she would be had she simply read an unapologetically ideological source or even, in some cases, nothing at all&quot;. In 2019, journalist Lewis Raven Wallace published a book advocating the opposite of the view from nowhere: the &quot;view from somewhere&quot;.

== Alternatives ==
Some argue that a more appropriate standard should be fairness and accuracy (as enshrined in the names of groups like Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting). Under this standard, taking sides on an issue would be permitted as long as the side taken was accurate and the other side was given a fair chance to respond. Many professionals believe that true objectivity in journalism is not possible and reporters must seek balance in their stories (giving all sides their respective points of view), which fosters fairness.

Brent Cunningham suggests that reporters should understand their inevitable biases, so they can explore what the accepted narratives may be, and then work against these as much as possible. He points out that &quot;[w]e need deep reporting and real understanding, but we also need reporters to acknowledge all that they don&#x27;t know, and not try to mask that shortcoming behind a gloss of attitude, or drown it in a roar of oversimplified assertions&quot;.

Cunningham suggests the following to solve the apparent controversies of objectivity: 
* Journalists should acknowledge, humbly and publicly, that what they do is far more subjective and far less detached than the aura of &quot;objectivity&quot; implies. He proposes that this will not end the charges of bias, but rather allow journalists to defend what they do from a more realistic and less hypocritical position.
* Journalists should be free and encouraged to develop expertise and to use it to sort through competing claims, identifying and explaining the underlying assumptions of those claims, and making judgments about what readers and viewers need to know and understand about what is happening. 
In the words of another scholar, Faina (2012) suggests that modern journalists may function as &quot;sensemakers&quot; within the shifting contemporary journalistic environment.

Notable departures from objective news work also include the muckraking of Ida Tarbell and Lincoln Steffens, the New Journalism of Tom Wolfe, the underground press of the 1960s, and public journalism.

For news related to conflict, peace journalism may provide an alternative by introducing insights of social science into the journalism field, specifically through disciplines such as conflict analysis, conflict resolution, peace research and social psychology. The application of this empirical research to the reporting of conflict may thus replace the unacknowledged conventions (see above) which govern the non-scientific practices of &#x27;objectivity&#x27; of journalism.

== Crowdfunding ==
Recently, many scholars and journalists have increasingly become attuned to the shifts occurring within the newspaper industry, and general upheaval of the journalistic environment, as it adjusts to the new digital era of the 21st century. In the face of this, the practice of crowdfunding is increasingly being utilized by journalists to fund independent and/or alternative projects, establishing it as another relevant alternative practice to consider in the discussion of journalistic objectivity. Crowdfunding allows journalists to pursue stories of interest to them or that otherwise may not be covered adequately for a number of reasons. Crowdfunding supports journalists by funding necessary components like reporting equipment, computers, travel expenses if necessary, and overhead costs like office space or paying other staff on their team. A key component of crowdfunding and a significant motivator for journalists to use it is the lack of corporate backing. This means that the journalist has the autonomy to make editorial decisions at their sole discrection but there is equally no financial support.

According to a study conducted by Hunter (2014), journalists engaged in a crowdfunding campaign all held a similar opinion that their funders did not have control over the content and that it was the journalist who maintained ultimate jurisdiction. However, this pronouncement was complicated by the sense of accountability or responsibility incited in journalists towards their funders. Hunter (2014) notes that this may have the effect of creating a power imbalance between funders and the journalist, as journalists want to maintain editorial control, but it is in fact the funders that decide whether the project will be a success or not.

To combat this, Hunter (2014) proposes the following strategies that journalists may employ to maintain a more objective approach if desired:

* Constructing an imaginary &#x27;firewall&#x27; between themselves and their audiences
* Limiting investment from any single source 
* Clearly defining the relationship they desire with funders at the outset of the project

The type of relationship and potential pressures the journalist may feel depends on the type of investor with whom they are working, as there are passive and active investors. Passive investors will not be involved beyond making a donation on the crowdfunding platform, leaving everything up to the discretion of the journalist. In contrast, active investors have a more active role in the production of the journalistic piece, which can take various forms that may include the investor providing feedback or ideas as well as receiving early copies of the work prior to its public release.

Some journalists from the study firmly held the opinion that impartial accounts and a detached, namely &quot;objective&quot;, reporting style should continue to govern, even within a crowdfunding context. Others, however, advocated that point-of-view journalism and accurate reporting are not mutually exclusive ideals, and thus journalists still may ascribe to quality factual reporting, sans the traditional practices or understanding of objectivity.

The study on crowdfunding done by Hunter (2014) showed that audiences are keen to fund projects with a specific point of view or pieces of advocacy journalism. Journalists are often using crowdfunding to pursue stories with a point-of-view that large corporations do not pursue adequately. The journalist explains the goal of the work they are trying to pursue and what resources are needed for it on crowdfunding platforms. Based on this information, funders decide to contribute or not. The desire or acceptance of opinionated journalism is especially clear with passive investors because they donate based on the journalist&#x27;s pitch and let the journalist produce what they want. They essentially just want to support the journalist as an individual and allow them the freedom to pursue the project.

<doc id="1266567" wikidata="Q2142888" url="?curid=1266567" title="Business journalism">
<text>Business journalism is the part of journalism that tracks, records, analyzes, and interprets the business, economic and financial activities and changes that take place in societies. s widely cover the entire purview of all commercial activities related to the economy.

This area of journalism provides news and feature articles about people, places, and issues related to the business sector. Most newspapers, magazines, radio, and television-news shows include a business segment. Detailed and in-depth business journalism may appear in publications, radio, and television channels dedicated specifically to business and financial journalism.

== History ==
Business journalism began as early as the Middle Ages, to help well-known trading families communicate with each other. 

Around 1700, Daniel Defoe—best known for his novels, especially &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;—began publishing business and economic news. In 1882 Charles Dow, Edward Jones and Charles Bergstresser began a wire service that delivered news to investment houses along Wall Street. In 1889, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; began publishing. While the famous muckraking journalist Ida Tarbell did not consider herself to be a business reporter, her reporting and writing about the Standard Oil Co. in 1902 provided the template for how thousands of business journalists have covered companies ever since. Business coverage gained prominence in the 1990s, with wider investment in the stock market. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; is one prominent example of business journalism and is among the United States of America&#x27;s top newspapers in terms of both circulation and respect for the journalists whose work appears there.

== Personnel ==
Journalists who work in this branch are classed as &quot;business journalists&quot;. Their main task is to gather information about current events as they relate to business. They may also cover processes, trends, consequences, and important people in business and disseminate their work through all types of mass media.

== Scope ==
Business journalism, although common in most industrialized countries, has a very limited role in third-world and developing countries. This leaves citizens of such countries in a very disadvantaged position locally and internationally. Recent efforts to bring business media to these countries have proven to be worthwhile.

<text>Cysatus is a lunar impact crater that is located in the southern part of the Moon&#x27;s near side. It is joined to the northeastern rim of the larger crater Gruemberger, and intrudes slightly into the interior of that formation. Due south is the larger Moretus, and to the east is Curtius. These craters appear foreshortened when observed from Earth because of their far south location.

This circular crater is slightly unusual for its lack of interesting features. No notable craters lie along its rim or the flat, level interior. The inner walls are devoid of s and just slope down to the flat floor, although the width of the inner wall is narrower to the northeast than elsewhere.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Cysatus.

<text>The Nest (2002), also known as Nid de guêpes, is a French action/thriller movie, co-written and directed by Florent-Emilio Siri. The literal translation of the French title is &quot;Wasp&#x27;s Nest.&quot; The film is quasi-remake of the 1976 film, &quot;Assault on Precinct 13,&quot; which in turn was inspired by 1959&#x27;s &quot;Rio Bravo.&quot;

==Plot ==
During Bastille Day when most people are enjoying the French national holiday, a group of thieves prepare to commit a warehouse robbery at a massive industrial park. Meanwhile, Laborie, a special agent in the French special forces, is leading an international team that is escorting the captured leader of the Albanian mafia, Abedin Nexhep, who is due in court on charges of running an extensive European prostitution network. Despite the considerable security escort, Nexhep&#x27;s henchmen still manage to set up an ambush.

Laborie manages to escape with Nexhep. They take refuge in the warehouse that is being robbed of computer equipment by the group of criminals. While facing off against the would-be thieves, the Albanian mafia surround the warehouse. Soon the three groups are involved in a long firefight with everyone involved struggling to survive.

*Richard Sammel as Winfried
*Valerio Mastandrea as Giovanni
*Martial Odone as Martial
*Martin Amic as Spitz
*Alexandre Hamidi as Tony
*Angelo Infanti as Abedin Nexhep

==Production ==
&quot;Nid de Guêpes&quot; combines a director&#x27;s love of the Western, especially the old films such as the original &quot;Fort Apache&quot;, with modern European fears about transnational crime and the modern cinematic trope of the girl hero or female action hero.

The cinematography of the movie was highly influential in subsequent American cinema releases, especially the most recent remake of &quot;Assault on Precinct 13&quot;. The film closely follows John Carpenter&#x27;s original &quot;Assault on Precinct 13&quot; even down to a similar last stand and a variant of the infamous &quot;ice cream truck&quot; scene.

<text>Maclear is a lava-flooded crater on the northwest part of the Mare Tranquillitatis, a lunar mare in the eastern half of the Moon. Its diameter is 20 km. The crater is located to the southwest of the slightly larger Ross. To the southwest of Maclear is Sosigenes, while farther to the south-southeast is Arago.

With most of its interior submerged in deposits of basaltic lava, all that remains of this crater is a narrow rim projecting above the surrounding mare. The rim is not quite circular, having a flat outward bulge along the western side. But the rim is relatively uniform in width and is not significantly eroded.

The crater rim lies at the southern terminus of a rille belonging to a system that runs along the western edges of Mare Tranquillitatis. The rille system to the north of the crater is designated Rimae Maclear, while the rilles to the south-southwest are named Rimae Sosigenes. The Rimae Maclear stretches for about 100 kilometers, reaching Al-Bakri to the north along the edge of the mare.

It is named after Sir Thomas Maclear, Her Majesty&#x27;s astronomer at the Royal Observatory, Cape of Good Hope (Cape Town, South Africa), from 1833 to 1870.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Maclear.

<doc id="1266589" wikidata="Q1068091" url="?curid=1266589" title="Point particle">
<text>A point particle, ideal particle or point-like particle (often spelled pointlike particle) is an idealization of particles heavily used in physics. Its defining feature is that it lacks spatial extension; being dimensionless, it does not take up space. A point particle is an appropriate representation of any object whenever its size, shape, and structure are irrelevant in a given context. For example, from far enough away, any finite-size object will look and behave as a point-like object. Point masses and point charges, discussed below, are two common cases. When a point particle has an additive property, such as mass or charge, it is often represented mathematically by a Dirac delta function. In classical mechanics there is usually no concept of rotation of point particles about their &quot;center&quot;.

In quantum mechanics, the concept of a point particle is complicated by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, because even an elementary particle, with no internal structure, occupies a nonzero volume. For example, the atomic orbit of an electron in the hydrogen atom occupies a volume of ~. There is nevertheless a distinction between elementary particles such as electrons or quarks, which have no known internal structure, and composite particles such as protons and neutrons, whose internal structures are made up of quarks.
Elementary particles are sometimes called &quot;point particles&quot; in reference to their lack of internal structure, but this is in a different sense than that discussed herein.

==Point mass==
Point mass (pointlike mass) is the concept, for example in classical physics, of a physical object (typically matter) that has nonzero mass, and yet explicitly and specifically is (or is being thought of or modeled as) infinitesimal (infinitely small) in its volume or linear dimensions.
In the theory of gravity, extended objects can behave as point-like even in their immediate vicinity. For example, spherical objects interacting in 3-dimensional space whose interactions are described by the Newtonian gravitation behave, as long as they do not touch each other, in such a way as if all their matter were concentrated in their centers of mass. In fact, this is true for all fields described by an inverse square law.

==Point charge==

Similar to point masses, in electromagnetism physicists discuss a , a point particle with a nonzero electric charge. The fundamental equation of electrostatics is Coulomb&#x27;s law, which describes the electric force between two point charges. Another result, Earnshaw&#x27;s theorem, states that a collection of point charges cannot be maintained in a static equilibrium configuration solely by the electrostatic interaction of the charges. The electric field associated with a classical point charge increases to infinity as the distance from the point charge decreases towards zero, which suggests that the model is no longer accurate in this limit.

==In quantum mechanics==

In quantum mechanics, there is a distinction between an elementary particle (also called &quot;point particle&quot;) and a composite particle. An elementary particle, such as an electron, quark, or photon, is a particle with no known internal structure. Whereas a composite particle, such as a proton or neutron, has an internal structure.
However, neither elementary nor composite particles are spatially localized, because of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The particle wavepacket always occupies a nonzero volume. For example, see atomic orbital: The electron is an elementary particle, but its quantum states form three-dimensional patterns.

Nevertheless, there is good reason that an elementary particle is often called a point particle. Even if an elementary particle has a delocalized wavepacket, the wavepacket can be represented as a quantum superposition of quantum states wherein the particle is exactly localized. Moreover, the &quot;interactions&quot; of the particle can be represented as a superposition of interactions of individual states which are localized. This is not true for a composite particle, which can never be represented as a superposition of exactly-localized quantum states. It is in this sense that physicists can discuss the intrinsic &quot;size&quot; of a particle: The size of its internal structure, not the size of its wavepacket. The &quot;size&quot; of an elementary particle, in this sense, is exactly zero.

For example, for the electron, experimental evidence shows that the size of an electron is less than . This is consistent with the expected value of exactly zero. (This should not be confused with the classical electron radius, which, despite the name, is unrelated to the actual size of an electron.)

<text>The Stockholm Observatory (, 050) is an astronomical observatory and institution in Stockholm, Sweden, founded in the 18th century and today part of Stockholm University. In 1931, the new Stockholm Observatory (, 052), nicknamed &quot;Saltis&quot;, was inaugurated on the Karlsbaderberget at Saltsjöbaden, near Stockholm, and operated until 2001.

There are records of daily weather observations from the observatory going back to 1754.

The Stockholm Observatory site at Saltsjöbaden was established with a 40-inch (102 cm) reflecting telescope from Grubb, built in 1931. Also of historical interest is a double telescope by Grubb, the 24/20-inch refractor, with has one 24-inch aperture another 20-inch on the same mount established in 1931.

The old observatory is in modern times a museum (Observatory Museum); known for a good view of the city of Stockholm from the dome. It also has some sculptures and a walled garden. The old observatory has many items from across the centuries, including a Repsold telescope and a marble-inlaid meridian line. Many old observatory instruments involved determining the location of stars, the local time, and data was recorded manually. In the late 19th century, astrophotography became more common, and the Replsold refractor is known to have been used for making images, which had to be done with chemicals that reacted with light.

== History ==
The first observatory was established by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on the initiative of its secretary Per Elvius. Construction, according to designs by the architect Carl Hårleman, begun in 1748 and the building was completed in 1753. It is situated on a hill in a park nowadays named Observatorielunden. The first head of the observatory was Pehr Wilhelm Wargentin. Later heads of the observatory include Hugo Gyldén and Bertil Lindblad. This 18th-century observatory today functions as a museum. 

A newer observatory was built in Saltsjöbaden outside Stockholm and completed in 1931 (the architect this time being Axel Anderberg). More recent astronomical observations, however, are almost exclusively being done in observatories outside Sweden and closer to the equator.

The research institute was transferred from the academy to the university in 1973 and is since
2001 housed in the AlbaNova University Centre.

The young Hjalmar Branting, later the first social democratic prime minister of Sweden, was employed as a mathematics assistant at the Stockholm Observatory 1879–1880 and 1882–1883.

== Honors ==

In August 2000, the asteroid 36614 Saltis was discovered at the Stockholm Observatory. The asteroid was named after the nickname of the observatory&#x27;s location, Saltsjöbaden, by its discoverer Alexis Brandeker in 2003.

4043 Perolof is named after a director of the Stockholm Observatory, Per Olof Lindblad.

==Stockholm Observatory at Saltsjöbaden==

It was common for really old observatories to be built on a new site in Europe; fortunately, the old observatory is not torn down, as happened in many cases. The old site was revitalized. One issue was the increased crowding in the cities, and astronomy was becoming more focused on data from space in the late 20th century. The 40-inch (102 cm) reflector was one of the largest telescopes in the world in 1931.


==Instruments==

Some first instruments for the observatory in the 1750s were two refractors and a small quadrant. Throughout the late 1700s, the collection was increased, including a refractor from Dollond and various clocks.

The clocks would be set by a device known as a transit instrument. Other activities at that time included trying determine distances in the solar system, observing comets, and observations of the Mira (aka Omicron Ceti). The output of Mira was recorded for thirty years by the observatory.

Later instruments by the 19th century include a 7-inch Repsold refractor on an equatorial mount, which was noted to be used at the observatory for parallax observations of bright stars in 1884 edition of &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;.

<doc id="1266606" wikidata="Q379997" url="?curid=1266606" title="Babak Khorramdin">
<text>Bābak Khorramdin (, &quot;Bābak-e Khorramdin&quot;, from , &quot;Pāpak/Pābag&quot;; 795 or 798 – January 838) was one of the main Iranian revolutionary leaders of the Iranian Khorram-Dinān (&quot;Those of the joyous religion&quot;), which was a local freedom movement fighting the Abbasid Caliphate. Khorramdin appears to be a compound analogous to &quot;dorustdin&quot; &quot;orthodoxy&quot; and &quot;Behdin&quot; &quot;Good Religion&quot; (Zoroastrianism), and are considered an offshoot of neo-Mazdakism. Babak&#x27;s Iranianizing rebellion, from its base in Azerbaijan in northwestern Iran, called for a return of the political glories of the Iranian past. The Khorramdin rebellion of Babak spread to the Western and Central parts of Iran and lasted more than twenty years before it was defeated when Babak was betrayed. Babak&#x27;s uprising showed the continuing strength in Azerbaijan of ancestral Iranian local feelings.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Bābak&quot; () is a New Persian name meaning &quot;father&quot;, which is derived from the Middle Persian &quot;Pāpak/Pābag&quot; (𐬞𐬀𐬞𐬀𐬐-𐭯𐭠𐭯𐭪𐭩), a common name in pre-Islamic Iran and also the hereditary name of the Sasanian Empire, whose founder Ardashir I (), was the son of a prince named Pabag. The original name of Babak was al-Hasan.

== Background ==

Babak was born in 795 (or 798) in Bilalabad in the Mimadh district of the Ardabil area, which was part of Azerbaijan, a region in north-western Iran. The Mimadh district had provided the Sasanian &quot;marzban&quot; (&quot;margrave&quot;) of Ardabil with troops during the Muslim conquest of Iran in 633–654, which resulted in the fall of the Sasanians and the conquest of Azerbaijan. The region was briefly occupied by the Khazars in 730–731, and had since the mid 8th century been under occupation by the Arab Rawadid clan. Azerbaijan was populated by an Iranian people known as the Adhari, who although closely related, were distinct from the Persians. They spoke Adhari, which according to the 10th-century geographer al-Maqdisi, was similar to Persian.

Babak was most likely himself not of pure Persian extraction, but of Adhari. His mother Mahru (meaning &quot;Moon-Face&quot;) was a non-Muslim wet-nurse from Azerbaijan. She is described as being &quot;one-eyed&quot; in Muslim sources and furthermore, by Al-Tabari, as having become pregnant with her son after being raped by a mercenary. However, these stories are more than likely fabrications created by hostile authors in order to disgrace Babak. As for the identity of Babak&#x27;s father, there are also multiple conflicting accounts. Al-Waqidi, as quoted by Ibn Al-Nadim, states that he was an oil-seller from al-Mada&#x27;in (Ctesiphon), who had settled in Azerbaijan. Crone takes this to mean that he was of Aramean origin. However, Dinawari, a contemporary of Babak, concludes and states that there is ample evidence to support that his father&#x27;s true name was Mutahar, a descendant of Abu Muslim through his daughter, Fāṭema. C.E. Bosworth argues that more credence should be lent to this latter account, as other sources are hostile and are eager to propose lowly or otherwise less honorable origins for Babak. In the other sources, his name is variably given as Abdallah, Merdas, Matar, Amir ibn Abdallah, or Amir ibn Ahad, all which suggest that he was seemingly a Muslim. Likewise, Babak&#x27;s father is also the subject of derogatory fabrication in Muslim sources.

Masudi noted in his ″Murūj al-dhahab wa maʿādin al-jawāhir″: ″What seems to us to be true and proven is that Bābak was a son of Moṭahhar, the son of Abū Moslem&#x27;s daughter Fāṭema, and that the Fāṭemīya group of the Khurramites took their name from this Fāṭema, not from Fāṭema the daughter of God&#x27;s Prophet″.

The original faith of Babak is uncertain; he was born with the Muslim name of al-Hasan, and his three brothers, Mu&#x27;awiya, Abdallah, and Ishaq, also had Muslim names. Having a Muslim name is not in itself proof of any religious beliefs, as it was not uncommon for people to have a Muslim name in order &quot;to move freely in Muslim society by virtue of their high position in their own community, such as the Armenian princes&quot; (Crone). According to Crone, who follows Al-Waqidi, Babak&#x27;s parents were probably no more than landless villagers, but knew that Babak and his brothers&#x27; futures lay with the Arab warlords of Azerbaijan, and thus as a way of adapting to the standards of the new world, raised them as Muslims.

== Early life ==

During Babak&#x27;s youth, his travelling father was killed near Sabalan. Till the age of twelve, Babak worked as a cowherd, and afterwards entered the service of an Arab warlord named Shibl ibn al-Muthanna al-Azdi in Sarab, where he worked as a groom and servant. The &quot;ghilman&quot; (&quot;slaves&quot;) of Shibl taught Babak how to play the lute. Babak also learned to recite poetry, probably in the local Adhari dialect. According to the 11th-century writer Abu&#x27;l Ma&#x27;ali, Babak played the lute and sang songs for the locals whilst working as a fruit vendor in the village. Babak later established himself in the city of Tabriz. There he worked under another Arab warlord, Muhammad ibn Rawwad Azdi for two years, until he reached adulthood and left for his village, Bilalabad. There Babak encountered a wealthy and influential landlord named Javidhan, who was reportedly impressed with the latters cleverness, and as result recruited him into his service. Unlike the previous men Babak had served, Javidhan was a local Iranian, and the leader of one of the two Khurramite movements in Azerbaijan. The leader of the other Khurramite movement was a certain Abu Imran, who often clashed with Javidhans forces. During one of the clashes, Abu Imran was defeated and killed, whilst Javidhan was mortally wounded, dying three days later. Javidhan was succeeded by Babak, who had already converted to Khurramism under the latters service. It was most probably during this period that Babak changed his name from al-Hasan to Babak.

== Movement ==



In 755, Abu Muslim was murdered. Although he had helped the Abbasids to defeat the former Caliphs, the Umayyad dynasty, the ruling Caliph had given the order to kill him, probably because of his increasing popularity among Iranians and non-Muslims.
This incident led to many revolts, mostly by angry Khurramiyyah (&quot;Khorram-Dinān&quot;) and some Zoroastrians. This, in turn, forced the Caliphs to use more violence against the Iranian population in order to keep the eastern provinces under control. The constant revolts did not come to an end in the following decades, and the Iranian population of the Caliphate was constantly being oppressed.

Babak joined the Khurramiyyah (&quot;Khorram-Dinān&quot;). The story of joining the Khorrami movement is being told in Waqed&#x27;s account, in summary, as follows:

Under the direction of his mentor Javidhan, a leader of one of the sects of the Khorramdin, Babak&#x27;s knowledge of history, geography, and the latest battle tactics strengthened his position as a favorite candidate for commander during the early wars against the Arab occupiers.

Bābak was a highly spiritual person who respected his Zoroastrian heritage. He made every possible effort to bring Iranians together and also with leaders such as Maziar to form a united front against the Arab Caliph. According to the medieval historian, Ibn Esfandyar, who composed the book &quot;Tarikh-e Tabaristan&quot; (&quot;History of Tabaristan&quot;), Maziar said:
However, one of the most dramatic periods in the history of Iran was set under Bābak&#x27;s leadership between 816–837. During these most crucial years, they not only fought against the Caliphate, but also for the preservation of Persian language and culture.

After the death of Javidhan, Babak married Javidhan&#x27;s wife and became the Khorramis&#x27; leader, sometime in the year 816–17 during al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s reign. Babak incited his followers to rebel against the caliphate.

According to Vladimir Minorsky, around the 9th–10th century:

At that time of Babak, there were Khorramis scattered in many regions of Iran, besides Adharbayjan, reportedly in Tabarestan, Khorasan, Balkh, Isfahan, Kashan, Qom, Ray, Karaj, Hamadan, Lorestan, Khuzestan as well as in Basra, and Armenia.

Tabari records that Babak claimed he possessed Javadan&#x27;s spirit and that Babak became active in 816–817. In 819–820 Yahya ibn Mu&#x27;adh fought against Babak, but could not defeat him. Two years later Babak vanquished the forces of Isa ibn Muhammad ibn Abi Khalid. In 824–825 the caliphal general Ahmad ibn al Junayd was sent against Babak. Babak defeated and captured him.

In 827–828 Muhammad ibn Humayd Tusi was dispatched to fight Babak. He won a victory and sent some captured enemies, but not Babak, to al-Ma&#x27;mun. However, about two years later, on June 9, 829, Babak won a decisive victory over this general at Hashtadsar. Muhammad ibn Humayd lost his life. Many of his soldiers were killed. The survivors fled in disarray.

Babak&#x27;s victories over Arab generals were associated with his possession of Babak Castle on Badd, an inaccessible mountain stronghold according to the Arab historians who mentioned that his influence also extended even to the territories of today&#x27;s Azerbaijan – &quot;southward to near Ardabil and Marand, eastward to the Caspian Sea and the Shamakhi district and Shervan, northward to the Muqan (Moḡan) steppe and the Aras river bank, westward to the districts of Jolfa, Nakjavan, and Marand&quot;.

In 835–836 the caliph al-Mu&#x27;tasim sent his outstanding general Afshin against Babak. Afshin rebuilt fortresses. He employed a relay system to protect supply caravans. Babak tried to capture the money being sent to pay Afshin&#x27;s army, but was himself surprised, lost many men and barely escaped. He did succeed in capturing some supplies and inflicting some hardship on his enemies. Amongst Babak&#x27;s commander, various names have been mentioned including Azin, Rostam, Tarkhan, Mua’wiyah and Abdullah.

The next year Babak routed the forces of Afshin&#x27;s subordinate, Bugha al-Kabir. In 837–838 al-Mu&#x27;tasim reinforced Afshin and provided him clear military instructions. Patiently following these enabled Afshin to capture Babak&#x27;s stronghold of Babak Castle. Babak escaped. Al-Mu&#x27;tasim sent a safety guarantee for Babak to Afshin. This was taken to Babak who was very displeased. He said: &quot;Better to live for just a single day as a ruler than to live for forty years as an abject slave.&quot;

He decided to leave the country for the Byzantine Empire and on his way Babak met Sahl Smbatean (Sahl ibn Sunbat in Arab sources), Prince of Khachen, who was Armenian. Sahl Smbatian, however, handed Babak over to Afshin in return for a large reward. Al-Mu&#x27;tasim commanded his general to bring Babak to him. Afshin informed Babak of this and told him since Babak might never return, this was the time to take a last look around. At Babak&#x27;s request, Afshin allowed his prisoner to go to Badhdh. There Babak walked through his ruined stronghold one night until dawn.

Eventually, Bābak, his wife, and his warriors were forced to leave &quot;Ghaleye Bābak&quot; after 23 years of constant campaigns.

== Death ==

He was eventually seized by Khaydhar ibn Kawus al-Afshin and was handed over to the Abbasid Caliph. During Bābak&#x27;s execution, the Caliph&#x27;s henchmen first cut off his legs and hands in order to convey the most devastating message to his followers. It&#x27;s said that Bābak bravely rinsed his face with the drained blood pouring out of his cuts, thus preventing the Caliph and the rest of the Abbasid army from seeing his pale face, a result of the heavy loss of blood. He was then gibbeted alive whilst sewn into a cow&#x27;s skin with the horns at ear level to gradually crush his head as it dried out.

== Legacy ==

Babak Khorramdin was not well known outside academia until the 20th century; however, due to Soviet nation building efforts and Babak&#x27;s following of the teachings of Mazdak with its proto-socialist themes, Babak Khorramdin was proclaimed a national hero in the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic. For example, the Soviet era scholar Ziya Bunyadov, claimed that &quot;Babak was a national hero of Azerbaijani people&quot; while the Russian ethnologist, historian and anthropologist Victor Schnirelmann dismisses Bunyadov&#x27;s theory, criticizing Bunyadov for not mentioning that Babak spoke Persian, and ignoring the witness accounts of Babak&#x27;s contemporaries who call him Persian. To this day, in the modern Republic of Azerbaijan, Babak is a cult figure and celebrated as a national hero. A city and a district in Azerbaijan were named after Babak, and a popular Azerbaijani film was released in 1979 about his life.

In modern Iran, due to the rise of nationalism in the 20th century, and renewed interest in pre-Islamic Iran, Babak Khorramdin was rediscovered during the reign of Reza Shah, and is celebrated as a national hero. However, Babak remains a controversial figure in the Islamic Republic, whose idolization is criticized by some Shia clerics.

<text>The Argentine Condor missile was a multinational space research program started in the 1970s. It involved significant contract work being performed by German company MBB (now a group within Daimler AG), but later developed into a ballistic missiles program.

==Condor I==
The original Condor had little military capability but helped build expertise later used for the &quot;Alacrán&quot; missile program. The Alacrán program developed a functional short-range ballistic missile.

=== Specifications (Condor I) ===
* Length: 
* Maximum diameter: 
* Stages: 1
* Fuel: HTPB
* Guidance system: inertial
* Apogee: 
* Range: 
* Payload: 

== Alacrán (Condor IAIII) ==

The Alacrán missile was a short range ballistic missile derived from the Condor Missile Program.

Derived from the Condor IAIII prototype, the Alacrán missile had shorter stabilization fins, an inertial guidance system, and a 1000CAP1 cluster warhead.

=== Specifications (Condor IAIII - Alacrán) ===
* Length: 
* Maximum diameter: 
* Stages: 1
* Fuel: HTPB
* Guidance system: inertial
* Apogee: 
* Range: 
* Warhead: 1000CAM1 cluster munition warhead, 

==Condor II==

During and after the 1982 Falklands War (), France (which supplied missiles) placed an arms embargo on Argentina, causing the Argentine Air Force, under the command of Ernesto Crespo, to develop its own medium-range missile in the &quot;Condor II&quot; program.

This program was undertaken in close collaboration with Egypt, and then Ba&#x27;athist Iraq (the Iraqi version was called BADR-2000), however it was discontinued in the early 1990s by President Carlos Menem because of political pressure from the United States. The missile was developed in Falda del Carmen, Córdoba Province.

The Condor missile had a range of 800 km to 1,000 km and a 1000CAP1 500 kg cluster munition warhead.

In 1997, the Argentine Air Force reported to the US Congress that it still possessed two of the missiles that were to be destroyed.

==Condor III==
There have been reports of a &quot;Condor III&quot; program. The Condor III would have an increased range to some with the same payload as the Condor II.

<doc id="1266623" wikidata="Q7751185" url="?curid=1266623" title="Methodist Church (United States)">
<text>The Methodist Church was the official name adopted by the Methodist denomination formed in the United States by the reunion on May 10, 1939, of the northern and southern factions of the Methodist Episcopal Church along with the earlier separated Methodist Protestant Church of 1828. The Methodist Episcopal Church had split in 1844 over the issue of slavery and the impending Civil War in America. During the American Civil War, the southern denomination was known briefly as the Methodist Episcopal Church in the Confederate States of America.

Its book of liturgy used for the reunited denomination was &quot;The Book of Worship for Church and Home&quot;, editions of which were published in 1945 and later revised in 1965. They had two official hymnals, the first being &quot;The Methodist Hymnal&quot;, published in 1935 and 1939 by the same three church bodies that later became The Methodist Church. It was replaced in 1966 by &quot;The Book of Hymns&quot;.

The Methodist Church then later merged with the Evangelical United Brethren Church on April 23, 1968, to form the United Methodist Church (UMC) with its headquarters, offices and publishing houses in Nashville, Tennessee. Over the next few years most of the individual local congregations in the two bodies under the names of &quot;Methodist Church&quot; or &quot;Evangelical United Brethren Church&quot; changed the latter part of their name to: &quot;------ United Methodist Church&quot;. The new UMC became one of the largest and most widespread denominations in America. Earlier in 1946, some Methodists formed the Evangelical Methodist Church, separating from the Methodist Church, citing the influence of modernism in that church as the reason for entering into schism.

<doc id="1266636" wikidata="Q660782" url="?curid=1266636" title="Leggings">
<text>Leggings are several types of leg attire that have varied through the years. Modern usage from the 1960s onwards has come to refer to elastic close-fitting high-rise garments worn over the legs typically by women, such as leg warmers or tights. Usage from the 18th century refers to men&#x27;s wear usually made of cloth or leather that is wrapped around the leg down to the ankle. In the 19th century, leggings usually referred to infants&#x27; leg clothing that were matched with a jacket, as well as leg-wrappings made of leather or wool and worn by soldiers and trappers. Leggings prominently returned to women&#x27;s fashion in the 1960s, drawing from the form-fitting clothing of dancers. With the widespread adoption of the synthetic fibre Lycra and the rise in popularity of aerobics, leggings came to further prominence in the 1970s and 1980s, and eventually made their way into streetwear. Leggings are a part of the late 2010s into the 2020s athleisure fashion trend of wearing activewear outside sporting activities and in casual settings.

==History==

Leggings in various forms and under various names have been worn for warmth and protection by both men and women throughout the centuries. The separate hose worn by men in Europe from the 13th to 16th centuries (the Renaissance period) were a form of leggings, as are the trews of the Scottish Highlands. Separate leggings of buckskin leather were worn by some Native Americans.

The linen pantalettes worn by girls and women under crinolines in the mid-19th century were also a form of leggings, and were originally two separate garments. Leggings became a part of fashion in the 1960s, as trousers similar to capri pants but tighter.

===Military use===
Since the late 19th century, soldiers of various nations, especially infantry, often wore leggings to protect their lower leg, to keep dirt, sand, and mud from entering their shoes, and to provide a measure of ankle support. At first, these were usually &quot;puttees&quot;—strips of thick woollen cloth resembling a large bandage—which were wrapped around the leg to support the ankle. They were usually held in place by a strap attached to the cloth. Later, puttees were replaced by some armies with canvas leggings fastened with buckles or buttons, usually secured at the bottom with an adjustable stirrup that passed under the sole of the shoe, just in front of the heel. The soldier placed the leggings around his calf with the buttoned side facing out and adjusted them and the strap to achieve a proper fit. Leggings typically extended to mid-calf and had a garter strap to hold them up and were secured with a tie just below the knee. Military leggings extended to the bottom of the knee and buttoned to the bottom button on the knee breeches. They are sometimes confused with gaiters, which extend to the high ankle and are worn with full-leg trousers.

During World War II, United States Army foot soldiers were referred to as &quot;legs&quot; by paratroopers and other U.S. forces that did not wear the standard Army leggings issued with the field service shoe. Late in World War II, after experiments with the general issue of high-top combat boots and jump boots for soldiers, leggings began to disappear from military service. In 1943, the United States Army modified their field service shoe by adding a taller leather upper that reached to the lower calf; secured by a combination of laces and buckles, the new design was designated the Type III Field Boot. However, the United States Marine Corps retained canvas leggings throughout the war, and used them in combat as late as the Korean War; Marines were referred to as &quot;Yellow Leg&quot; troops by North Korean and Chinese Communist forces.

==Modern fashion==
Leggings made from a nylon-lycra blend (usually 90% nylon, 10% lycra) have long been worn during exercise. Nylon lycra leggings are often referred to as bicycle or running tights, and are shinier in appearance than those made from cotton. Some have racing stripes or reflective patterns to further distinguish them as athletic wear and provide extra safety. However, since the 1980s exercise-style leggings have also been worn for fashion and as street wear.

===For men===
At the Marni Men&#x27;s show during the Fall 2007 Fashion Week, outfits with leggings designed solely for men were introduced.

Men&#x27;s leggings, dubbed &quot;meggings&quot; (a portmanteau of the words &quot;men&quot; and &quot;leggings&quot;) were presented as the latest fashion trend for men at spring/summer 2011 fashion runways, supposed to be styled and layered beneath shorts and preferably with large, baggy, loose or long tops such as T-shirts.

K-pop idols have been wearing male leggings under shorts as a fashion item since the 2010s.

===Jeggings===
&quot;Jeggings&quot;, a registered brand name of Sanko Group, are leggings made to look like skin-tight denim jeans. Jeggings were brought on by the resurgence in style of skinny jeans in the late 2000s, when a higher demand for an even tighter style of pants came about. In 2011 &quot;Jeggings&quot; was entered into the twelfth edition of &quot;Concise Oxford English Dictionary&quot;.

===In sports===

Leggings are sometimes worn during sports and other vigorous activities. Runners, dancers, and exercisers may wear them alone or with athletic shorts over them—particularly in cold weather under a sports uniform, e.g. in soccer, with soccer shorts, shin guards and soccer socks over the leggings, under a cheerleading uniform with socks over the leggings, or field hockey players under their skirts with socks over the leggings. Leggings have even been worn by a hurling full back. Boys and men can also be seen wearing them under athletic shorts with socks over them when exercising or running track or cross country etc. Also, boys and men dancers wear leggings. Leggings and bike shorts are now accepted and allowed to be worn as part of a tennis outfit on various leagues and the professional WTA tour. 

===Use as outerwear===
There has been societal debate about whether leggings are clothing on their own, which can be worn without covering, or are an accessory only to be worn with other items covering them, such as skirts, dresses or shorts. In a 2016 poll of its readers &quot;Glamour&quot; magazine said that 61% of its readers thought that leggings should only be worn as an accessory, whereas an article that same year from &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot; concluded that &quot;...Leggings do, in fact, count as pants—provided they are opaque enough that they don&#x27;t show your underwear.&quot;

There have been a number of instances of people wearing leggings as pants who have been restricted or criticized for their actions. In 2013, schools in Sonoma County, California, banned students from wearing them as outerwear, as did a Massachusetts school in 2015. Schools in Oklahoma, Illinois, and North Carolina have enforced or suggested similar dress codes. A state legislator in Montana introduced a bill in 2015 intended to ban leggings and yoga pants.

In March 2017, three children flying on a company pass were barred from boarding a United Airlines flight by a gate agent who decided that their leggings were inappropriate. United Airlines defended its position, while rival airline Delta stated via Twitter that leggings were welcome on its flights; United said in a statement that it does not bar regular female passengers from boarding if they are wearing leggings. Although some public figures, including actress Patricia Arquette and model and actress Chrissy Teigen, were critical of United&#x27;s decision, a survey encompassing 1,800 travelers carried out by Airfarewatchdog found that 80% of their respondents backed the airline&#x27;s decision to ban &quot;inappropriate clothing&quot;, although the term was not defined in the poll.

Restrictions on wearing leggings is sometimes linked to slut shaming or body shaming, with critics noting that &quot;...not being able to wear leggings because it&#x27;s &#x27;too distracting for boys&#x27; is giving us the impression we should be guilty for what guys do.&quot;

<doc id="1266637" wikidata="Q1665432" url="?curid=1266637" title="Integrated Facility for Linux">
<text>The Integrated Facility for Linux (IFL) is an IBM mainframe and Power Systems processor dedicated to running the Linux operating system. On IBM Z and IBM LinuxONE machines, IFLs can be used with or without hypervisors such as z/VM and KVM. IFLs are one of three most common types of &quot;specialty&quot; IBM mainframe processors that give software vendors (and their customers) more granular control over software licensing and maintenance costs. (The other most common specialty processors are and ICFs). Microcode restricts IFLs to Linux workload by omitting some processor instructions not used by the Linux kernel (that other operating systems use), but the underlying processors are physically identical to general purpose processors (CPs). When IBM adds features and performance improvements to its mainframes&#x27; general purpose main processors (which can also run Linux), those features and improvements nearly always apply equally to IFLs. In fact, in recent IBM Z machines IFLs support simultaneous multithreading, a feature not available for general purpose processors.

IBM announced IFLs on August 1, 2000, and started shipping them on September 29, 2000. At the same time, IBM introduced a special Linux-only, VM-like product called the S/390 Virtual Image Facility for Linux to cater to IT staff previously unfamiliar with IBM mainframes. IBM soon discovered that z/VM was not too difficult for new IT staff to learn (and worked better), so IBM withdrew S/390 Virtual Image Facility for Linux from marketing on April 30, 2002.

Customers could purchase IFLs for all IBM mainframes as far back as the G5 series and can purchase IFLs for all recent IBM Z and LinuxONE machine models. IFLs also support select IBM software appliances such as the IBM Db2 Analytics Accelerator, zAware, and z/VSE Network Appliance, and they also supported the Z port of the now abandoned OpenSolaris operating system. Fujitsu and Hitachi also offered IFLs on certain models of their machines.

On Power Systems IFLs are also specially priced for both the processors and many software products.

<doc id="1266640" wikidata="Q7493367" url="?curid=1266640" title="Republican Party of Shelby County">
<text>The Republican Party of Shelby County is the Republican political organization for Shelby County, Tennessee. It has a long history of impacting politics in Shelby County long before the Republican Party was popular in the south.

Despite being in a heavily Democratic county, the Republican Party of Shelby County is the largest county Republican Party in the state. Though Tennessee does not register by party, it is estimated that there are roughly 272,000 Republican voters in Shelby County.

==History==
The party has its origins in the Lincoln League, which was founded by Robert Church Jr. in 1916 to promote black voter registration. Church was one of the most prominent African-American businessmen in the nation and is credited with the early development of Beale Street. By the 1950s conservative Democrats were joining the party as blacks were leaving.

In the 1970s the party remade itself as a suburb-focused party that relied on activities like backyard parties, door-to-door campaigning and telephone networks to coordinate conservative voters in the suburbs.

Starting in 1992, the party began holding a primary election to pick candidates in the general election. It was scheduled for the same day as Tennessee&#x27;s presidential primary, and represented the first partisan local elections in the County since before 1900. The county Democratic party soon copied the practice. The move meant the end of nearly a century of nonpartisan elections in the county.

<text>The Archdiocese of Denver () is a Latin Church ecclesiastical jurisdiction, or diocese, of the Catholic Church in northern Colorado in the United States.

It is part of the XIII Conference Region and includes 113 parishes, 307 priests, and an estimated 550,000 lay Catholics. The mother church of the archdiocese is the Cathedral Basilica of the Immaculate Conception in Denver. Since 2012, the archbishop of Denver has been Samuel Aquila.

==Area==

Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Clear Creek, Eagle, Garfield, Gilpin, Grand, Jackson, Jefferson, Larimer, Logan, Moffat, Morgan, Phillips, Pitkin, Rio Blanco, Routt, Sedgwick, Summit, Washington, Weld, and Yuma.

It is the metropolitan archdiocese of its ecclesiastical province. The province includes three suffragan dioceses:

* Diocese of Cheyenne
* Diocese of Colorado Springs
* Diocese of Pueblo

==History==

=== 1860 to 1890 ===
The first Catholic church in Denver was founded in 1860 by Joseph Machebeuf. It would later become St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral.

In 1868, Pope Pius IX erected the Vicariate Apostolic of Colorado and Utah, taking its territory from the Diocese of Santa Fe and the Diocese of Grass Valley. The pope named Machebeuf as the vicar apostolic. In 1870, Pius IX removed the Utah Territory from the vicariate, creating the Vicariate Apostolic of Colorado. The pope named Machebeuf as vicar apostolic.

While vicar apostolic, Machebeuf founded an academy and a school for boys in Denver, a convent of the Sisters of Loretto, St. Joseph&#x27;s Hospital in Denver, the House of the Good Shepherd and the College of the Sacred Heart in Denver. The Catholic population of Colorado increased under his tenure from a few thousand to approximately 50,000. Sacred Heart of Jesus, the first Catholic church in Boulder, was dedicated in 1877. In 1878, Frank Michaud funded the purchase of a wooden building in Fort Collins to become St. Joseph&#x27;s, the first Catholic church in that city.

On August 16, 1887, Pope Leo XIII suppressed the Apostolic Vicariate of Colorado, replacing it with the Diocese of Denver, which covered all of Colorado. The pope named Machebeuf as the first bishop of Denver. That same year, the pope named Nicholas Matz as coadjutor bishop to assist Machebeuf. When Machebeuf died in 1889, Matz automatically succeeded him as bishop.

=== 1900 to 1941 ===
During his 28-year-long tenure, Matz made Catholic education his top priority, establishing dozens of parochial schools. He demanded that Catholic parents send their children to these schools under pain of mortal sin. In 1905, he founded St. Thomas Seminary in Denver, staffed by the Vincentians. He broke ground for the new Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in 1902, later dedicating it in 1912. He also established thirty-four new parishes, a cemetery, and a diocesan newspaper. However, Matz met opposition from many priests and his ambitious building projects drove the diocese into a large amount of debt. He was a strong opponent of labor unions, especially the Western Federation of Miners.

After Matz died in 1917, Bishop John Henry Tihen of the Diocese of Lincoln was appointed bishop of Denver by Pope Benedict XV. During World War I, Tihen supported Liberty bonds and the National Catholic War Council, and organized students at Catholic schools as the U.S. Boys Working Reserve and the Children&#x27;s Red Cross Campaign. Tihen was forced to defend the church in Colorado from the Ku Klux Klan, which he condemned as &quot;an anti-Catholic and un-American society.&quot; He also supported women&#x27;s suffrage and the labor movement, and founded &quot;The Denver Catholic Register&quot; in 1905. During his tenure, Tihen organized the diocesan Catholic Charities; increased the number of parochial schools from 31 to 49, and the number of priests from 174 to 229; dedicated 41 churches; and established Loretto Heights College in Denver, three hospitals, an orphanage, and a home for the elderly. Tihan retired in 1931.

In 1931, Urban John Vehr was appointed the fourth bishop of Denver by Pope Pius XI. Vehr soon visited every parish in the diocese, wearing out the new Studebaker automobile given to him by his clergy. The number of parishes in the diocese fell from 111 in 1930 to 87 in 1940 due to the Great Depression. Vehr cooperated with the New Deal programs of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, asking priests to celebrate mass at the two dozen Civilian Conservation Corps camps established in Colorado. He reorganized diocesan affairs and placed ownership of all parish properties in the name of the bishop.

=== 1941 to 1986 ===
On November 15, 1941, Pope Pius XII elevated the Diocese of Denver to the Archdiocese of Denver. At the same time, he took territory from the Diocese of Denver to erect the new Diocese of Pueblo. The pope named Vehr as the first archbishop of Denver. Under the slogan of &quot;Every Catholic Child in a Catholic School,&quot; Vehr began a fundraising campaign to raise $3.5 million to acquire new school sites and make additions to existing ones. In 1965, Vehr launched the Archdiocesan Development Program to accommodate Colorado&#x27;s Catholic population, which had tripled in size since his arrival in 1931. He also erected 43 new parishes and expanded St. Thomas Seminary, which reached its peak enrollment of 274 seminarians during Vehr&#x27;s tenure.

When Vehr retired in 1967, Pope Paul VI appointed Bishop James Casey of Lincoln as the second archbishop of Denver. Soon after arriving in Denver, he earmarked $1 million in archdiocesan funds on efforts to help the poor. Among these efforts was the Samaritan House Homeless Shelter. He created the archdiocesan Office of Hispanic Concerns in 1968, later raising it to the vicariate level in 1981.

In 1972, Casey moved out of the episcopal mansion in Cheesman Park and into a penthouse at the Park Lane Apartments in Washington Park. He gave greater power to laity and nuns, and was forced to close or consolidate several Catholic schools. He joined the Colorado Council of Churches, and allowed Catholics to participate in the crusades of the evangelist Billy Graham. During his 19-year-long tenure, Casey dedicated 24 parishes. He also increased the number of priests from 327 to 356, and the number of Catholics in the archdiocese rose from 261,844 to 330,270. In 1983, Pope John Paul II erected the Diocese of Colorado Springs, taking territory from the archdiocese. Casey died in 1986.

=== 1986 to present ===
The next archbishop of Denver was Bishop James Stafford from the Diocese of Memphis, named by John Paul II in 1986. In 1990 the Vincentian Fathers announced the closing of St. Thomas Seminary in Denver due to falling enrollment. Stafford decided to buy the seminary property and plan a brand new institution, Saint John Vianney Theological Seminary. The new facility opened in 1999. In 1993, Stafford hosted the World Youth Day, the first such event in North America. In 1996, he launched the first capital campaign in forty years and a &quot;Strategic Plan&quot; for Catholic schools. That same year, Stafford was appointed to a position in the Roman Curia at the Vatican.

To replace Stafford, John Paul II selected Bishop Charles J. Chaput from the Diocese of Rapid City as the next archbishop of Denver. Chaput became archbishop of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia in 2011. In 2012, Pope Benedict XVI named Bishop Samuel Aquila of the Diocese of Fargo as the fifth and current archbishop of Denver.

===Reports of sex abuse===
In a 2005 &quot;Denver Post&quot; article, five men described being fondled during the 1960s when they were boys by Harold White. In 1983, one of the men wrote to Stafford, accusing White of abusing him. The archdiocese responded that White was to &quot;...receive an evaluation from competent personnel to determine whether there are any recurring difficulties.” The archdiocese allowed White to work in parish ministry until 1993. He was laicized by the Vatican in 2004.

Tim Evans, pastor at St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Parish in Fort Collins, was convicted of sexual assault in 2007. He was sentenced to 14 years to life in prison for assaulting a teenage boy. In January 2023, Scott Venti sued the archdiocese, claiming that he had been sexually abuse multiple times during the 1990s by Evans in Fort Collins.

In October 2019, Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser released the preliminary results of an eight-month investigation on sexual abuse of children by Catholic clergy in Colorado. The report stated that at least 127 children had been molested by 22 clergy serving in the archdiocese. In late 2019, a man reported to authorities that he had been sexually molested multiple times by James Moreno between 1978 and 1980 at various church locations within the archdiocese.

In October 2020, a voluntary program established by the Colorado dioceses to compensative sexual abuse victims announced that it was planning to $6.6 million in compensation to 81 victims of clergy sex abuse that year.

In December 2020, Weiser&#x27;s final report was released. It named an additional nine clergy with credible accusations of sexual abuse and 46 alleged victims in both in the archdiocese and the Diocese of Pueblo. A total 52 priests who served in the Colorado diocese were named in the final report as having committed acts of sex abuse. Among other priests, the report had comments about these individuals:

* Harold White – Accused of sexually abusing 63 children, the report called White &quot;the most prolific known clergy child sex abuser in Colorado history.&quot; The report also revealed that White was first accused of sexual abuse of children in 1960. The archdiocese then transferred him to different parishes throughout Colorado until 1993.
* John Stein – Arrested for sex abuse charges in 1946 and 1956, he was allowed to continue in ministry by the archdiocese, molested at least three children
* Charles Woodrich – Known for his work in local homeless shelters, Woodrich was accused of sexually molesting three teenagers during the 1970s and 1980s.

In August 2022, a woman sued the archdiocese, claiming sexual abuse by Marshall Gourley from age seven to 11 at the Our Lady of Guadalupe Church during the early 1980s. The plaintiff stated that the diocese had received similar complaints about Gourley during the same time period, but did nothing about them.

==Media==
Denver&#x27;s first Catholic newspaper, the &quot;Denver Catholic&quot;, published its first issue in 1900, under editor F. J. Kramer. It received the endorsement of Bishop Matz. The &quot;Catholic&quot; published its last issue in 1904, due to a lack of revenue.

In 1905, Thomas Casey began publishing the &quot;Catholic Register of Denver&quot; as an edition of the &quot;Catholic Register&quot; of Kansas City, Missouri. It became the &quot;Denver Catholic Register&quot; beginning with the next issue. In 1910, a group of priests and laymen formed the Catholic Publishing Society, which took over management of the &quot;Register&quot;, made it the diocese&#x27;s official newspaper. The owners directed that all profits go to the support of orphans. However, it proved to be a money-losing enterprise.

In 1913, Hugh McMenamin, the rector at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, bought a controlling stake in the Catholic Publishing Society and named Matthew J. Smith as its editor. Smith quickly turned the business around. In 1921, Bishop Tihen gained a controlling interest in the paper, placing it under diocesan ownership. In 1925, the diocese began publishing &quot;The Register&quot; on Tuesdays while the &quot;Denver Catholic Register&quot; continued to publish on Thursdays, as part of a plan to eventually publish daily.

In 1927, Smith launched a national edition, the &quot;National Catholic Register&quot;, with four pages of national and international news. The two editions would soon merge, as the &quot;Register&quot; became a national chain of Catholic newspapers. In 1970, Patrick Frawley&#x27;s Twin Circle Publishing Co. purchased the &quot;National Catholic Register&quot; from the archdiocese. The &quot;Denver Catholic Register&quot; reverted to being a local publication. In 2015, its name was shortened to &quot;Denver Catholic&quot;, and it became a magazine in 2020.

<doc id="1266657" wikidata="Q3189038" url="?curid=1266657" title="Julia Davis">
<text>Julia Davis (born August 1966) is an English actress, comedian, director and writer. She is known for writing and starring in the BBC Three comedy &quot;Nighty Night&quot; (2004–2005) and the comedies &quot;Hunderby&quot; (2012–2015) and &quot;Camping&quot; (2016), which she also directed. 

A nine-time BAFTA TV Award nominee, she won Best Comedy Writing for &quot;Hunderby&quot; in 2013 and the 2018 British Academy Television Award for Best Scripted Comedy for &quot;Sally4Ever&quot;. She has also received two RTS Awards and three British Comedy Awards. In addition to acting in her own works, she has appeared in a variety of other British television comedies, most notably portraying Dawn Sutcliffe in &quot;Gavin &amp; Stacey&quot; (2007–2009, 2019, 2024). Her film roles include &quot;Love Actually&quot; (2003), &quot;Cemetery Junction&quot; (2010), &quot;Four Lions&quot; (2010), and &quot;Phantom Thread&quot; (2017).

==Early life and education ==
Julia Davis was born in England in August 1966. Her mother was a secretary, and her father a civil servant. She grew up in Guildford, Surrey, before moving at the age of 14 to Bath in Somerset. She was raised in the Church of England. 

After studying for a degree in English and drama at the College of Ripon and York St John, she returned to Bath working &quot;dead-end jobs&quot;, starting a comedy double-act &quot;The Sisters of Percy&quot; with her friend Jane Roth at a local theatre group. It grew into an improv troupe with Welsh radio DJ Rob Brydon and Ruth Jones.

==Career==
===1998–2006: Career beginnings, &quot;Human Remains&quot; and &quot;Nighty Night&quot;===
Davis decided to become a comedian after a long illness. She secured her first comedy commission, &quot;Five Squeezy Pieces&quot;, from BBC Radio 4 in 1998. The series was an all-female sketch comedy show, with Meera Syal, Arabella Weir, Maria McErlane, and Claire Calman.&lt;ref name=&quot;theguardian/2004/dec/17&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

She first appeared on television in 1998 in the BBC sketch show &quot;Comedy Nation&quot;. During their radio sketch series &quot;Five Squeezy Pieces&quot;, Arabella Weir introduced Davis to Arthur Mathews and Graham Linehan who cast her as a regular cast member in the television sketch show &quot;Big Train&quot; (1998). Her career gained a further boost in 1998 after she sent a tape of various characters to Steve Coogan, who invited her to write for and participate in his shows during his 1998 national tour. Chris Morris, director of the &quot;Big Train&quot; pilot, cast her for his 1997–1999 radio series &quot;Blue Jam&quot;, its successor March–April 2000 TV show &quot;Jam&quot;, and &quot;Brass Eye&quot;. Davis went on to appear in many comedy television shows including &quot;I&#x27;m Alan Partridge&quot;, &quot;I Am Not an Animal&quot;, &quot;Dr. Terrible&#x27;s House of Horrible&quot;, &quot;Ideal&quot; and &quot;Nathan Barley&quot;.

In November 2000, &quot;Human Remains&quot;, a dark comedy television series produced by Steve Coogan&#x27;s production company Baby Cow, co-written by and co-starring Rob Brydon and Davis, debuted on BBC Two. In the six-part series, Brydon and Davis played six different couples talking to camera about their unusual relationships. The last episode of &quot;The Office&quot; features Davis, who is heard on the phone as the voice of a woman from a dating agency in conversation with David Brent. Davis also appeared in 2003 film &quot;Love Actually&quot;.

In 2004 and 2005, Davis wrote and starred in two series of the BBC Three dark comedy &quot;Nighty Night&quot;. The show is centred on her character of peroxide &quot;blonde&quot; sociopathic beauty therapist Jill Tyrell.

===2007–2010: &quot;Gavin &amp; Stacey&quot; and &quot;Lizzie &amp; Sarah&quot;===
From 2007 to 2009, she played Dawn Sutcliffe in &quot;Gavin &amp; Stacey&quot;, a role which she reprised in 2019 for a Christmas special and in 2024 in the finale. In 2006, she appeared on &quot;Little Britain Abroad&quot; as a sexy Russian mail-order bride called Ivanka.

In 2009, Davis appeared, in the guise of Steve Coogan&#x27;s personal assistant Debbie Bidwoden, in the TV film &quot;Steve Coogan – The Inside Story&quot;.

In 2010, she co-wrote and co-starred in &quot;Lizzie and Sarah&quot; with Jessica Hynes. The pilot aired on 20 March 2010 on BBC Two. It was made by Baby Cow Productions, and was considered even darker than Davis&#x27;s previous work; when the BBC did not commission a series, despite a Facebook campaign.

===2011–2014: &quot;Black Mirror&quot;, &quot;Psychobitches&quot; and &quot;Hunderby&quot;===
Davis has also starred in productions such as the BBC&#x27;s &quot;For the Love of God&quot;, &quot;The Alan Clark Diaries&quot;, &quot;Fear of Fanny&quot;, in which she played the original celebrity chef Fanny Cradock, and &quot;Persuasion&quot;, an adaptation of the Jane Austen novel. In December 2011, Davis appeared in &quot;Fifteen Million Merits&quot;, an episode of the anthology series &quot;Black Mirror&quot;, as Judge Charity on the fictional talent show &quot;Hot Shot&quot;.

On 22 December 2011, she appeared as Anne Yeaman in the Christmas special and finale of the BBC Three comedy &quot;How Not to Live Your Life&quot;. Davis appeared in the pilot episode of &quot;Bad Sugar&quot;, shown on Channel 4 on 26 August 2012. A full series was set to air in 2013, but was cancelled due to availability of the cast and writers. In 2013, Davis played various characters in BBC sketch show &quot;It&#x27;s Kevin&quot; and in &quot;Psychobitches&quot; on Sky Arts. She appeared in an episode of &quot;Inside No. 9&quot; as a stage manager. Davis created, wrote and starred in &quot;Hunderby&quot;, which aired for two series on Sky Atlantic in 2012 and 2015. For &quot;Hunderby&quot;, Davis won the BAFTA TV Craft Award for Writing – Comedy. At the 2013 BAFTA TV Awards, &quot;Hunderby&quot; was nominated for Best Scripted Comedy and Davis was nominated for Best Female Performance in a Comedy Programme. At the 2012 British Comedy Awards, &quot;Hunderby&quot; won the awards for Best New Comedy and Best Sitcom.

In 2014, she cowrote and starred in a pilot for Channel 4 called &quot;Morning Has Broken&quot;, about a struggling daytime TV host. A full series of &quot;Morning Has Broken&quot; was commissioned but ultimately did not happen. She starred as an eccentric mother in the comedy short film &quot;The Bird&quot;.

===2015–present: &quot;Camping&quot;, &quot;Sally4Ever&quot; and podcast===
In 2015, Davis and Marc Wootton created and starred in BBC Radio 4 comedy series &quot;Couples&quot;, about couples in therapy. It was reported in 2015 that Davis had been commissioned for a new series, &quot;Robin&#x27;s Test&quot;, which was later renamed &quot;Camping&quot;.

In 2016, Davis wrote, directed and starred as shallow nymphomaniac &quot;Fay&quot; in &quot;Camping&quot; on Sky Atlantic. This was her directorial debut. At the 2017 BAFTA TV Awards, &quot;Camping&quot; was nominated for Best Scripted Comedy. In 2017, Davis was featured in the Paul Thomas Anderson film &quot;Phantom Thread&quot; as Lady Baltimore. 

In 2018, Davis wrote, directed and starred in the comedy television series &quot;Sally4Ever&quot; on Sky Atlantic and HBO. Davis plays the character of Emma, who is having a lesbian affair with a woman called Sally, who is having a midlife crisis. At the 2019 BAFTA awards it won the award for Best Scripted Comedy and Davis was nominated for Best Female Performance in a Comedy Programme. She also appeared in the film &quot;Fighting with My Family&quot;.

Davis launched the podcast comedy &quot;Dear Joan And Jericha&quot; with comedian Vicki Pepperdine in 2018. The series has 28 episodes as of May 2024. Davis and Pepperdine published a book on the back of the podcast, &quot;Why He Turns Away: Dos and Don&#x27;ts From Dating to Death&quot;.

Davis played socialite Maureen, Marchioness of Dufferin and Ava, in BBC One historical drama &quot;A Very British Scandal&quot;, which premiered on BBC One on Boxing Day 2021.

In 2022, Davis appeared in two episodes of &quot;The Outlaws&quot;, as Rita.

== Influences and reviews ==
Davis cites Julie Walters as giving her the confidence to pursue a career in comedy.

Discussing her influences for the character of Jill in &quot;Nighty Night&quot;, Davis told &quot;The Guardian&quot; that &quot;Most of Jill is an amalgam of women I&#x27;ve seen or worked with in the West Country&quot;.

In her book &quot;Reclaiming Female Authorship in Contemporary UK Television Comedy&quot; (2024) Laura Minor, lecturer in television studies at University of Salford, notes that Davis is known for creating boundary-pushing black comedy that centres female anti-hero characters.

==Personal life==
 Davis is in a long term relationship with comedian Julian Barratt of &quot;The Mighty Boosh&quot;. The couple are parents to twin sons.

<doc id="1266658" wikidata="Q284256" url="?curid=1266658" title="Crystallization">
<text>Crystallization is a process that leads to solids with highly organized atoms or molecules, i.e. a crystal. The ordered nature of a crystalline solid can be contrasted with amorphous solids in which atoms or molecules lack regular organization. Crystallization can occur by various routes including precipitation from solution, freezing of a liquid, or deposition from a gas. Attributes of the resulting crystal can depend largely on factors such as temperature, air pressure, cooling rate, or solute concentration.

Crystallization occurs in two major steps. The first is nucleation, the appearance of a crystalline phase from either a supercooled liquid or a supersaturated solvent. The second step is known as crystal growth, which is the increase in the size of particles and leads to a crystal state. An important feature of this step is that loose particles form layers at the crystal&#x27;s surface and lodge themselves into open inconsistencies such as pores, cracks, etc.

Crystallization is also a chemical solid–liquid separation technique, in which mass transfer of a solute from the liquid solution to a pure solid crystalline phase occurs. In chemical engineering, crystallization occurs in a crystallizer. Crystallization is therefore related to precipitation, although the result is not amorphous or disordered, but a crystal.

== Process ==

The crystallization process consists of two major events, &quot;nucleation&quot; and &quot;crystal growth&quot; which are driven by thermodynamic properties as well as chemical properties.

&quot;Nucleation&quot; is the step where the solute molecules or atoms dispersed in the solvent start to gather into clusters, on the microscopic scale (elevating solute concentration in a small region), that become stable under the current operating conditions. These stable clusters constitute the nuclei. Therefore, the clusters need to reach a critical size in order to become stable nuclei. Such critical size is dictated by many different factors (temperature, supersaturation, etc.). It is at the stage of nucleation that the atoms or molecules arrange in a defined and periodic manner that defines the crystal structure – note that &quot;crystal structure&quot; is a special term that refers to the relative arrangement of the atoms or molecules, not the macroscopic properties of the crystal (size and shape), although those are a result of the internal crystal structure.

The &quot;crystal growth&quot; is the subsequent size increase of the nuclei that succeed in achieving the critical cluster size. Crystal growth is a dynamic process occurring in equilibrium where solute molecules or atoms precipitate out of solution, and dissolve back into solution. Supersaturation is one of the driving forces of crystallization, as the solubility of a species is an equilibrium process quantified by Ksp. Depending upon the conditions, either nucleation or growth may be predominant over the other, dictating crystal size.

Many compounds have the ability to crystallize with some having different crystal structures, a phenomenon called polymorphism. Certain polymorphs may be metastable, meaning that although it is not in thermodynamic equilibrium, it is kinetically stable and requires some input of energy to initiate a transformation to the equilibrium phase. Each polymorph is in fact a different thermodynamic solid state and crystal polymorphs of the same compound exhibit different physical properties, such as dissolution rate, shape (angles between facets and facet growth rates), melting point, etc. For this reason, polymorphism is of major importance in industrial manufacture of crystalline products. Additionally, crystal phases can sometimes be interconverted by varying factors such as temperature, such as in the transformation of anatase to rutile phases of titanium dioxide.

== In nature ==

There are many examples of natural process that involve crystallization.

Geological time scale process examples include:
* Natural (mineral) crystal formation (see also gemstone);
* Stalactite/stalagmite, rings formation;

Human time scale process examples include:
* Snow flakes formation;
* Honey crystallization (nearly all types of honey crystallize).

== Methods ==
Crystal formation can be divided into two types, where the first type of crystals are composed of a cation and anion, also known as a salt, such as sodium acetate. The second type of crystals are composed of uncharged species, for example menthol.

Crystals can be formed by various methods, such as: cooling, evaporation, addition of a second solvent to reduce the solubility of the solute (technique known as antisolvent or drown-out), solvent layering, sublimation, changing the cation or anion, as well as other methods.

The formation of a supersaturated solution does not guarantee crystal formation, and often a seed crystal or scratching the glass is required to form nucleation sites.

A typical laboratory technique for crystal formation is to dissolve the solid in a solution in which it is partially soluble, usually at high temperatures to obtain supersaturation. The hot mixture is then filtered to remove any insoluble impurities. The filtrate is allowed to slowly cool. Crystals that form are then filtered and washed with a solvent in which they are not soluble, but is miscible with the mother liquor. The process is then repeated to increase the purity in a technique known as recrystallization.

For biological molecules in which the solvent channels continue to be present to retain the three dimensional structure intact, microbatch crystallization under oil and vapor diffusion have been the common methods.

=== Typical equipment ===

Equipment for the main industrial processes for crystallization.

# &quot;Tank crystallizers&quot;. Tank crystallization is an old method still used in some specialized cases. Saturated solutions, in tank crystallization, are allowed to cool in open tanks. After a period of time the mother liquor is drained and the crystals removed. Nucleation and size of crystals are difficult to control. Typically, labor costs are very high.
# &quot;Mixed-Suspension, Mixed-Product-Removal (MSMPR)&quot;: MSMPR is used for much larger scale inorganic crystallization. MSMPR can crystalize solutions in a continuous manner.

== Thermodynamic view ==


The crystallization process appears to violate the second principle of thermodynamics. Whereas most processes that yield more orderly results are achieved by applying heat, crystals usually form at lower temperaturesespecially by supercooling. However, the release of the heat of fusion during crystallization causes the entropy of the universe to increase, thus this principle remains unaltered.

The molecules within a pure, &quot;perfect crystal&quot;, when heated by an external source, will become liquid. This occurs at a sharply defined temperature (different for each type of crystal). As it liquifies, the complicated architecture of the crystal collapses. Melting occurs because the entropy (&quot;S&quot;) gain in the system by spatial randomization of the molecules has overcome the enthalpy (&quot;H&quot;) loss due to breaking the crystal packing forces:
:formula_1
:formula_2
Regarding crystals, there are no exceptions to this rule. Similarly, when the molten crystal is cooled, the molecules will return to their crystalline form once the temperature falls beyond the turning point. This is because the thermal randomization of the surroundings compensates for the loss of entropy that results from the reordering of molecules within the system. Such liquids that crystallize on cooling are the exception rather than the rule.

The nature of the crystallization process is governed by both thermodynamic and kinetic factors, which can make it highly variable and difficult to control. Factors such as impurity level, mixing regime, vessel design, and cooling profile can have a major impact on the size, number, and shape of crystals produced.
==Dynamics==
As mentioned above, a crystal is formed following a well-defined pattern, or structure, dictated by forces acting at the molecular level. As a consequence, during its formation process the crystal is in an environment where the solute concentration reaches a certain critical value, before changing status. Solid formation, impossible below the solubility threshold at the given temperature and pressure conditions, may then take place at a concentration higher than the theoretical solubility level. The difference between the actual value of the solute concentration at the crystallization limit and the theoretical (static) solubility threshold is called supersaturation and is a fundamental factor in crystallization.

===Nucleation===

Nucleation is the initiation of a phase change in a small region, such as the formation of a solid crystal from a liquid solution. It is a consequence of rapid local fluctuations on a molecular scale in a homogeneous phase that is in a state of metastable equilibrium. Total nucleation is the sum effect of two categories of nucleation – primary and secondary.

====Primary nucleation====
Primary nucleation is the initial formation of a crystal where there are no other crystals present or where, if there are crystals present in the system, they do not have any influence on the process. This can occur in two conditions. The first is homogeneous nucleation, which is nucleation that is not influenced in any way by solids. These solids include the walls of the crystallizer vessel and particles of any foreign substance. The second category, then, is heterogeneous nucleation. This occurs when solid particles of foreign substances cause an increase in the rate of nucleation that would otherwise not be seen without the existence of these foreign particles. Homogeneous nucleation rarely occurs in practice due to the high energy necessary to begin nucleation without a solid surface to catalyze the nucleation.

Primary nucleation (both homogeneous and heterogeneous) has been modeled as follows:

:formula_3

where
: &quot;B&quot; is the number of nuclei formed per unit volume per unit time,
: &quot;N&quot; is the number of nuclei per unit volume,
: &quot;kn&quot; is a rate constant,
: &quot;c&quot; is the instantaneous solute concentration,
: &quot;c&quot;* is the solute concentration at saturation,
: (&quot;c&quot; − &quot;c&quot;*) is also known as supersaturation,
: &quot;n&quot; is an empirical exponent that can be as large as 10, but generally ranges between 3 and 4.

====Secondary nucleation====
Secondary nucleation is the formation of nuclei attributable to the influence of the existing microscopic crystals in the magma. More simply put, secondary nucleation is when crystal growth is initiated with contact of other existing crystals or &quot;seeds&quot;. The first type of known secondary crystallization is attributable to fluid shear, the other due to collisions between already existing crystals with either a solid surface of the crystallizer or with other crystals themselves. Fluid-shear nucleation occurs when liquid travels across a crystal at a high speed, sweeping away nuclei that would otherwise be incorporated into a crystal, causing the swept-away nuclei to become new crystals. Contact nucleation has been found to be the most effective and common method for nucleation. The benefits include the following:
* Low kinetic order and rate-proportional to supersaturation, allowing easy control without unstable operation.
* Occurs at low supersaturation, where growth rate is optimal for good quality.
* Low necessary energy at which crystals strike avoids the breaking of existing crystals into new crystals.
* The quantitative fundamentals have already been isolated and are being incorporated into practice.

The following model, although somewhat simplified, is often used to model secondary nucleation:
:formula_4
where
: &quot;k&quot;1 is a rate constant,
: &quot;MT&quot; is the suspension density,
: &quot;j&quot; is an empirical exponent that can range up to 1.5, but is generally 1,
: &quot;b&quot; is an empirical exponent that can range up to 5, but is generally 2.

===Growth===

Once the first small crystal, the nucleus, forms it acts as a convergence point (if unstable due to supersaturation) for molecules of solute touching – or adjacent to – the crystal so that it increases its own dimension in successive layers. The pattern of growth resembles the rings of an onion, as shown in the picture, where each colour indicates the same mass of solute; this mass creates increasingly thin layers due to the increasing surface area of the growing crystal. The supersaturated solute mass the original nucleus may &quot;capture&quot; in a time unit is called the &quot;growth rate&quot; expressed in kg/(m2*h), and is a constant specific to the process. Growth rate is influenced by several physical factors, such as surface tension of solution, pressure, temperature, relative crystal velocity in the solution, Reynolds number, and so forth.

The main values to control are therefore:
* Supersaturation value, as an index of the quantity of solute available for the growth of the crystal;
* Total crystal surface in unit fluid mass, as an index of the capability of the solute to fix onto the crystal;
* Retention time, as an index of the probability of a molecule of solute to come into contact with an existing crystal;
* Flow pattern, again as an index of the probability of a molecule of solute to come into contact with an existing crystal (higher in laminar flow, lower in turbulent flow, but the reverse applies to the probability of contact).

The first value is a consequence of the physical characteristics of the solution, while the others define a difference between a well- and poorly designed crystallizer.

===Size distribution===
The appearance and size range of a crystalline product is extremely important in crystallization. If further processing of the crystals is desired, large crystals with uniform size are important for washing, filtering, transportation, and storage, because large crystals are easier to filter out of a solution than small crystals. Also, larger crystals have a smaller surface area to volume ratio, leading to a higher purity. This higher purity is due to less retention of mother liquor which contains impurities, and a smaller loss of yield when the crystals are washed to remove the mother liquor. In special cases, for example during drug manufacturing in the pharmaceutical industry, small crystal sizes are often desired to improve drug dissolution rate and bio-availability. The theoretical crystal size distribution can be estimated as a function of operating conditions with a fairly complicated mathematical process called population balance theory (using population balance equations).

==Main crystallization processes==
Some of the important factors influencing solubility are:
* Concentration
* Temperature
* Solvent mixture composition
* Polarity
* Ionic strength
So one may identify two main families of crystallization processes:
* Cooling crystallization
* Evaporative crystallization

This division is not really clear-cut, since hybrid systems exist, where cooling is performed through evaporation, thus obtaining at the same time a concentration of the solution.

A crystallization process often referred to in chemical engineering is the fractional crystallization. This is not a different process, rather a special application of one (or both) of the above.

===Cooling crystallization===

====Application====
Most chemical compounds, dissolved in most solvents, show the so-called &quot;direct&quot; solubility that is, the solubility threshold increases with temperature.

So, whenever the conditions are favorable, crystal formation results from simply cooling the solution. Here &quot;cooling&quot; is a relative term: austenite crystals in a steel form well above 1000 °C. An example of this crystallization process is the production of Glauber&#x27;s salt, a crystalline form of sodium sulfate. In the diagram, where equilibrium temperature is on the x-axis and equilibrium concentration (as mass percent of solute in saturated solution) in y-axis, it is clear that sulfate solubility quickly decreases below 32.5 °C. Assuming a saturated solution at 30 °C, by cooling it to 0 °C (note that this is possible thanks to the freezing-point depression), the precipitation of a mass of sulfate occurs corresponding to the change in solubility from 29% (equilibrium value at 30 °C) to approximately 4.5% (at 0 °C) – actually a larger crystal mass is precipitated, since sulfate entrains hydration water, and this has the side effect of increasing the final concentration.

There are limitations in the use of cooling crystallization:
* Many solutes precipitate in hydrate form at low temperatures: in the previous example this is acceptable, and even useful, but it may be detrimental when, for example, the mass of water of hydration to reach a stable hydrate crystallization form is more than the available water: a single block of hydrate solute will be formed – this occurs in the case of calcium chloride);
* Maximum supersaturation will take place in the coldest points. These may be the heat exchanger tubes which are sensitive to scaling, and heat exchange may be greatly reduced or discontinued;
* A decrease in temperature usually implies an increase of the viscosity of a solution. Too high a viscosity may give hydraulic problems, and the laminar flow thus created may affect the crystallization dynamics.
* It is not applicable to compounds having &quot;reverse&quot; solubility, a term to indicate that solubility increases with temperature decrease (an example occurs with sodium sulfate where solubility is reversed above 32.5 °C).

====Cooling crystallizers====

The simplest cooling crystallizers are tanks provided with a mixer for internal circulation, where temperature decrease is obtained by heat exchange with an intermediate fluid circulating in a jacket. These simple machines are used in batch processes, as in processing of pharmaceuticals and are prone to scaling. Batch processes normally provide a relatively variable quality of the product along with the batch.

The &quot;Swenson-Walker&quot; crystallizer is a model, specifically conceived by Swenson Co. around 1920, having a semicylindric horizontal hollow trough in which a hollow screw conveyor or some hollow discs, in which a refrigerating fluid is circulated, plunge during rotation on a longitudinal axis. The refrigerating fluid is sometimes also circulated in a jacket around the trough. Crystals precipitate on the cold surfaces of the screw/discs, from which they are removed by scrapers and settle on the bottom of the trough. The screw, if provided, pushes the slurry towards a discharge port.

A common practice is to cool the solutions by flash evaporation: when a liquid at a given T0 temperature is transferred in a chamber at a pressure P1 such that the liquid saturation temperature T1 at P1 is lower than T0, the liquid will release heat according to the temperature difference and a quantity of solvent, whose total latent heat of vaporization equals the difference in enthalpy. In simple words, the liquid is cooled by evaporating a part of it.

In the sugar industry, vertical cooling crystallizers are used to exhaust the molasses in the last crystallization stage downstream of vacuum pans, prior to centrifugation. The massecuite enters the crystallizers at the top, and cooling water is pumped through pipes in counterflow.

===Evaporative crystallization===
Another option is to obtain, at an approximately constant temperature, the precipitation of the crystals by increasing the solute concentration above the solubility threshold. To obtain this, the solute/solvent mass ratio is increased using the technique of evaporation. This process is insensitive to change in temperature (as long as hydration state remains unchanged).

All considerations on control of crystallization parameters are the same as for the cooling models.

====Evaporative crystallizers====
Most industrial crystallizers are of the evaporative type, such as the very large sodium chloride and sucrose units, whose production accounts for more than 50% of the total world production of crystals. The most common type is the &quot;forced circulation&quot; (FC) model (see evaporator). A pumping device (a pump or an axial flow mixer) keeps the crystal slurry in homogeneous suspension throughout the tank, including the exchange surfaces; by controlling pump flow, control of the contact time of the crystal mass with the supersaturated solution is achieved, together with reasonable velocities at the exchange surfaces. The Oslo, mentioned above, is a refining of the evaporative forced circulation crystallizer, now equipped with a large crystals settling zone to increase the retention time (usually low in the FC) and to roughly separate heavy slurry zones from clear liquid. Evaporative crystallizers tend to yield larger average crystal size and narrows the crystal size distribution curve.

===DTB crystallizer===

Whichever the form of the crystallizer, to achieve an effective process control it is important to control the retention time and the crystal mass, to obtain the optimum conditions in terms of crystal specific surface and the fastest possible growth. This can be achieved by a separation – to put it simply – of the crystals from the liquid mass, in order to manage the two flows in a different way. The practical way is to perform a gravity settling to be able to extract (and possibly recycle separately) the (almost) clear liquid, while managing the mass flow around the crystallizer to obtain a precise slurry density elsewhere. A typical example is the DTB (&quot;Draft Tube and Baffle&quot;) crystallizer, an idea of Richard Chisum Bennett (a Swenson engineer and later President of Swenson) at the end of the 1950s. The DTB crystallizer (see images) has an internal circulator, typically an axial flow mixer – yellow – pushing upwards in a draft tube while outside the crystallizer there is a settling area in an annulus; in it the exhaust solution moves upwards at a very low velocity, so that large crystals settle – and return to the main circulation – while only the fines, below a given grain size are extracted and eventually destroyed by increasing or decreasing temperature, thus creating additional supersaturation. A quasi-perfect control of all parameters is achieved as DTF crystallizers offer superior control over crystal size and characteristics. This crystallizer, and the derivative models (Krystal, CSC, etc.) could be the ultimate solution if not for a major limitation in the evaporative capacity, due to the limited diameter of the vapor head and the relatively low external circulation not allowing large amounts of energy to be supplied to the system.

<doc id="1266659" wikidata="Q2141291" url="?curid=1266659" title="West Coast Customs">
<text>West Coast Customs (abbreviated by the company as WCC) is an automobile repair shop focusing on the customization of vehicles. It was started by co-founders Ryan Friedlinghaus and Quinton Dodson circa 1994. According to Friedlinghaus, he began the business with a $5,000 loan from his grandfather, but other sources claim that he raised the seed money for the business while working at his father&#x27;s liquor store. Owing to the patronage of celebrities such as Shaquille O&#x27;Neal and Sean Combs, along with appearances in the reality television programs &quot;Pimp My Ride&quot; and &quot;Street Customs&quot;, the company has gained a high degree of notoriety and has become a multimillion-dollar business.

Besides celebrities, West Coast Customs has also created vehicles for global brands such as Virgin, Nintendo, and Microsoft. It is frequently characterized as one of the best custom car shops in the United States. However, the company has also at times been accused of missing deadlines, using aggressive sales tactics, and producing low quality and potentially unsafe customized vehicles. Some observers and past employees have also criticized the company&#x27;s employment practices.

It has had some success franchising outside of the United States; it has opened franchises in Dubai, and Shanghai (as ). Other franchises, however, such as the one in Berlin, closed shortly after opening due to becoming insolvent. With a long history of different locations within the U.S. state of California, its current flagship and largest facility of is headquartered in Burbank, California.

== History ==
=== Early years; &quot;Pimp My Ride&quot; (1990–2007) ===

According to two contradictory statements in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, West Coast Customs was founded in either 1994 or 1998 by auto enthusiast Ryan Friedlinghaus. In a 2008 article, &quot;USA Today&quot; put the foundation year as 1997. The legal entity, West Coast Customs International, LLC, was incorporated in California on October 20, 2000. A young Friedlinghaus had gotten his custom vehicles featured on the covers of auto magazines by age 14, but he became frustrated with the tedium of dealing with multiple specialty shops, which led to longer times to build the vehicles. According to &quot;Entrepreneur&quot;, this frustration, coupled with his love for custom cars, was what led to his opening of his own shop.

The company moved many times in its early years, but it was at its Inglewood location that WCC began to gain a reputation for quality, which caused celebrities to have their cars modified there. According to Friedlinghaus, one of his first customers was Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, who wanted a customized Chevrolet Suburban, and this relationship helped him get contacts with other celebrities who were looking for custom automobiles. Owing to this, Music Television (MTV) offered Friedlinghaus the opportunity to have a reality television show filmed at his business with co-founder Quinton &quot;Q&quot; Dodson as the star and rapper Xzibit as the host; his acceptance of this deal led to the 2004 TV show &quot;Pimp My Ride&quot;.

&quot;Pimp My Ride&quot; was extremely successful, spawning international spin-offs, and its success increased the profile of West Coast Customs substantially. The show&#x27;s format was that the Film producer at MTV would find typical Americans with junk cars, they would be given a short interview with Xzibit, Friedlinghaus and the WCC crew to determine their interests and hobbies, and then WCC staff would take their junk car and transform it into a custom car embodying the interests and personality of its owner. In 2004, CBS News reported that the show consistently ranked first place in the 12 to 34-year-old demographic for its 9:30 pm time slot.

According to a former employee of the company at the time &quot;Pimp My Ride&quot; was filmed, most of the work on the vehicles was done behind the scenes. Cars and expectations for the final product would arrive on Monday, and employees had until the following Friday to complete a project, sometimes necessitating twelve hour work days. According to this employee, much of the off-screen labor was done by illegal immigrants from Mexico, around eleven in total. As the employees were of WCC and not MTV, MTV was apparently unconcerned about possible ramifications of this for them.

Owing to the popularity of &quot;Pimp My Ride&quot;, West Coast Customs was prominently featured in the 2005 street racing video game &quot;L.A. Rush&quot; as the car upgrade mechanism. According to the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Midway, the developer of the game, paid &quot;handsomely&quot; to be able to use the brand.

In June 2005, Friedlinghaus took over the role of host from Dodson for the fourth season.

As early as 2005, during airing of the second season of &quot;Pimp My Ride&quot;, rumors circulated that the location of the show would change and Friedlinghaus would part with MTV to host a show on a different network. These rumors were confirmed with simultaneous announcements by MTV and Friedlinghaus in 2007, after the fourth and final season with WCC as the shop.

In a 2007 interview in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that Friedlinghaus gave after the &quot;Pimp My Ride&quot; relocation from West Coast Customs to Galpin Auto Sports, Friedlinghaus credited &quot;Pimp My Ride&quot; with helping him build his brand, but said that he felt that his focus on building cars for the television show damaged his relationships with his other customers.


=== &quot;Street Customs&quot; and &quot;(Inside) West Coast Customs&quot; (2007–2018) ===
Nevertheless, after leaving &quot;Pimp My Ride&quot;, Friedlinghaus would almost immediately begin a new television program that aired simultaneously on Discovery Channel and The Learning Channel, &quot;Street Customs&quot;, produced by Pilgrim Films &amp; Television. Instead of building the cars for the people chosen by MTV, the new show followed ongoing customizations being done for consenting customers of West Coast Customs. Friedlinghaus described the difference between the two shows thus: &quot;I want to build cars on TV, not for TV.&quot; While the breakup was described as amicable, others at WCC were not so subdued: Sean Mahaney, a then-employee of WCC, reportedly said &quot;Most of the MTV people are not real car guys... They pay us to build the cars, so we do what they want even if it sucks.&quot;

&quot;Street Customs&quot; would change names twice and networks four times, but its format remained constant. While cars would still be built for individuals, more and more episodes were devoted to brands as the show ran on. Because MTV was no longer footing the bill, all episodes of the new series were about cars built for people who could afford the high cost of customization. Some notable vehicles built for celebrities in &quot;Street Customs&quot; include one for Carroll Shelby, a Cadillac for Shaquille O&#x27;Neal (according to Friedlinghaus, O&#x27;Neal had already had 30 cars built for him by WCC by July 2007), a modified Range Rover for an unnamed member of the royal family of Dubai, and a Cadillac CTS-V for Justin Bieber. Brands built for included Chronic Tacos and Vans.

According to Friedlinghaus, in an interview with &quot;The Press-Enterprise&quot;, the Great Recession affected his business heavily: he had to lay off half of the company&#x27;s employees, orders decreased, and customers opted to have used cars repaired instead of buying brand new cars to be customized.

In 2010, West Coast Customs designed three identical customized 1955 Ford F-100 pick up trucks that were prominently featured in the film &quot;The Expendables&quot;. One of these cars was for Sylvester Stallone, who sold it at auction in 2011 for $132,000. In 2015, WCC created a car by combining the body of a Ford Maverick and the internals of a Ford Ranger for another film, &quot;Mad Max: Fury Road&quot;.

After the 2009 season, the show was renamed &quot;Inside West Coast Customs&quot;. Along with this change, it was also moved to Discovery HD Theater, which later became a different specifically automotive related cable channel, Velocity.

In 2012, &quot;Jalopnik&quot; reported that the rapper will.i.am and Friedlinghaus organized a publicity stunt wherein will.i.am pretended that his car, a DeLorean modified by West Coast Customs at a cost of $700,000, was stolen. Friedlinghaus then pretended to find the supposedly stolen car. No police report was filed, nor were the police even called; &quot;Jalopnik&quot; describes the event as a &quot;viral marketing stunt gone badly&quot;.

In June 2013, Fox Sports Network took over the production of the show, dropping the word &quot;Inside&quot; from the show&#x27;s name, and continued to produce new seasons of the show until 2016. In March 2017, the television show moved back to Velocity with a new season; Velocity then renewed the show in January 2018.
On August 29, 2018, it was announced Six Flags Magic Mountain was in the process of constructing a roller coaster named West Coast Racers, which was designed in part by West Coast Customs.

== Location changes ==
The company has moved several times in its history, across 3 different counties in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, each time to larger spaces. According to Friedlinghaus, the first shop was in Laguna Niguel, California, after which it moved to Compton, California, in 1998. In 2000, it moved again to a location on Olive Street in Inglewood, California. After the first season of &quot;Pimp My Ride&quot;, the company moved yet another time to a larger location in El Segundo, California, near Los Angeles International Airport that had a room specifically for the filming. After &quot;Pimp My Ride&quot; left the company, it moved to a location in Corona, California, in preparation for the &quot;Street Customs&quot; television show.

During filming of Season 5 Episode 12 &quot;WCC&#x27;s New Zip Part 1&quot; of &quot;West Coast Customs&quot;, Friedlinghaus began moving the shop to its current location, a auto shop on West Empire Avenue in Burbank, Los Angeles County, California. The grand opening of the new facility occurred in December 2014.

== Criticism ==
=== Mistreatment of employees ===
As early as 2008, &quot;USA Today&quot; noted that Friedlinghaus&#x27;s auto shop routinely had 60-hour work weeks and employees had &quot;insane deadlines&quot; working for Friedlinghaus, a &quot;self-described micromanager&quot;. One former employee, Mauricio Hernández, who would go on to co-found the Mexican franchise of WCC, claimed in an interview with &quot;NPR&quot; that during the period of his employment at the California branch (2004–2009), he worked ten to twelve hours per day, six days per week as an undocumented worker, without Social Security or any other benefits, and that by so doing he &quot;missed...the childhood of [his] kids.&quot;

In an interview with &quot;Entertainment Scoop&quot;, when asked &quot;What does it take to be an employee at West Coast Customs?&quot; Friedlinghaus replied, &quot;Not saying, &#x27;when do I go home?&#x27; The guys who want to stay and work and get things done...it&#x27;s hard to find people that are good...[people who will do] whatever we ask them to do.&quot;

On April 23, 2014, after an investigation by the United States Department of Labor (USDOL), the company was found to have violated the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. The government found that the company was not paying employees overtime or minimum wage nor keeping proper records. During the investigation, the government found that all employees were paid a weekly salary, regardless of how many hours they worked. Because employees were frequently coerced to work overtime, this resulted in a wage of $6/hour for some employees. Furthermore, until 2011, the company attempted to skirt minimum wage and overtime laws by classifying their on-site exclusive long-term employees as independent contractors, which is illegal in the United States.

When presented with the opportunity to go to court or pay the fine assessed by USDOL, Friedlinghaus chose to pay the fine, which amounted to $157,592 in back wages for the wronged employees and $16,830 in civil penalties. In an interview with &quot;The Press-Enterprise&quot; after the fine was paid, Daniel Pasquil, the director for the wages and hour division of the West Covina office of the USDOL, noted that &quot;the most important thing is that the company did correct the violations&quot; and stressed that the company is now in full compliance.

=== Quality issues alleged ===
==== Jake Glazier&#x27;s Buick Century ====
In 2015, &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; interviewed three people who were participants on &quot;Pimp My Ride&quot;, one of whom had a vehicle that was &quot;pimped&quot; during the time that the location of the show was West Coast Customs, Jake Glazier (featured in Season 4 Episode 7, &quot;Jake&#x27;s Buick Century&quot;).

During the episode, the team at West Coast Customs were told that Glazier had recently graduated from a degree program in audio engineering, so they installed an MTX Jackhammer high fidelity sound system (with accompanying decibel meter and warning light, in the words of Xzibit, to stave off deafness) and a record player inside the dashboard. Other customizations were a flat black paint job (with a red metal flake paint job on the roof with scallops on the sides and hood to match), four-inch whitewall tires, removal of the muffler and installation of exhaust pipes, and black and white vinyl interior.

Besides problems caused by the long period of time that the vehicle was in the shop, for around one half of a year, Glazier claimed that the quality of the vehicle he received was also severely compromised. According to Glazier, when the muffler was removed, three &quot;fake&quot; exhaust pipes were substituted instead: these were used to make the engine sound much more powerful to viewers of the television show, but they made the car needlessly loud. He also claimed that very little or no mechanical work was done to the car, to the extent that he had trouble driving it home from the show&#x27;s set. Due to all of the mechanical trouble, one month after acquiring the car from West Coast Customs, he sold it to MTX Audio for $18,000. According to Glazier, MTX did not buy the car to drive it, but merely to prevent it from falling into the hands of their competitors. Glazier further claimed that when it was time to receive the car, Dana &quot;Big Dane&quot; Florence intimidated him to act more enthusiastic for the cameras, saying &quot;Listen, we put a lot of work into this. We expect you to be a little more fucking enthusiastic.&quot; Larry Hochberg, an executive producer for MTV at the time, disputed Glazier&#x27;s statements, saying that in reality great lengths were taken to provide the participants in the show with automobiles in good driving condition, and that MTV even paid for some further repairs and tows after the cameras were rolling.

Despite the problems he faced with the vehicle, and with the caveat that he appear on a show with the same format as &quot;Pimp My Ride&quot; where MTV paid for all work done until the car was delivered (and for some afterwards, depending on who one believes), Glazier said he would happily participate in the program again if given the chance.
==== Trisha Paytas&#x27; Mercedes-Benz G-Wagen ====
There have been several high-profile incidents of quality issues outside of the context of the MTV program. In 2015, Trisha Paytas, a singer-songwriter and internet personality, had her three-week-old 2014 Mercedes-Benz G-Wagen customized by WCC. Among other customizations, she requested that the car be painted pink, that Swarovski crystals be integrated into the headrests and steering wheel, and that the floormats be changed out with customized ones. According to Paytas, after bringing in her vehicle, she was promised that it would be ready by November 17, but the company missed both that deadline and a further one on December 9. After the second deadline was missed, she uploaded a vlog to YouTube about her experience, and thereafter claimed that WCC threatened her with a lawsuit if she refused to remove it. December 17 became the deadline that the company would ultimately keep, but when Paytas came to pick up the vehicle, she found that none of the electronic components worked, including those that are required for safety in the United States, such as turn signals, headlights, and windshield wipers. Furthermore, the dashboard instruments did not function. To her complaints about these issues, Paytas claims that the company told her to drive the car home and then to the Mercedes-Benz dealership from which she bought it to ask them for an in-warranty repair. Paytas uploaded yet another vlog five days after this incident, after which point WCC uploaded its own video in the form of a scrolling text public relations statement. In the statement, besides denying that they had &quot;talked down&quot; to Paytas, WCC denied that its customization was the reason for the issues with her vehicle, claimed that the vehicle was late because she had changed what she had ordered &quot;several times&quot;, denied that they had ignored Paytas as Paytas claimed, and invited Paytas to contact them with any further requests or complaints for an &quot;immediate resolution,&quot; noting that they had already committed to fix the problem (which, though they wrote it was &quot;unrelated to their services&quot;, they would do it anyway &quot;as part of providing excellent customer service&quot;). The company also noted its track record, but did not provide any concrete details. As of December 23, 2016, the statement-as-YouTube video, which has had its comments disabled, had 261 &quot;likes&quot; and 1,652 &quot;dislikes&quot;, or a ratio of 6.32 dislikes for every 1 like.

After receiving the repaired vehicle, Paytas wrote on Instagram that although &quot;it was a bit of a struggle getting [it] [...] I do love my [car] so very very much.&quot;

==== Firefall bus for Red 5 Studios ====

In 2010, Chinese online game operator The9 Limited announced &quot;Firefall&quot;, an MMO first-person shooter to be developed by Red 5 Studios as their first game. The game would enter closed beta in 2011, and open beta in 2013. Mark Kern, a video game designer, was appointed by The9 as CEO of the new Red 5 Studios. As CEO, one of Kern&#x27;s major tasks was promoting the game, and he chose to do this in part with a custom designed tour bus worth 3 million made to look like one of the vehicles in the videogame and to be converted into a game room on wheels. The customization of the bus was featured on &quot;Inside West Coast Customs&quot; in Season 3 Episode 4. While in the episode itself it is made to appear that the bus was on-time, arriving at the Los Angeles 2012 Anime Expo which took place between June 29 and July 2, in reality it arrived much later than anticipated, according to both then-CEO Mark Kern and a report by &quot;Tech in Asia&quot;. Kern also accused WCC of not delivering what he wanted and of going over budget, while &quot;Tech in Asia&quot; noted that the bus was delivered missing some of its key features, and that it missed all of the key video game conferences for the year 2011 (such as the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2012, which was held between June 5 and 7). According to their report, it now &quot;sits in a warehouse somewhere, collecting dust.&quot; A Twitter parody of the bus describes itself as a &quot;gross demonstration of capitalistic overindulgence.&quot;

== Franchises ==
West Coast Customs has attempted to franchise its brand to other parts of the world with limited success.

=== Closed franchises ===

* On September 14, 2008, a franchise was opened in a converted factory building along Revaler Straße in Friedrichshain, Berlin, but it closed and declared insolvency less than one year later on August 14, 2009. Before its closure, professional boxer Wladimir Klitschko and musician &quot;Evil&quot; Jared Hasselhoff were customers. In 2011, following the closure of the business, the building was repainted. 
* Mauricio Hernández, a former employee at the California location hired just before the debut on &quot;Pimp My Ride&quot;, co-founded a Mexican franchise with Friedlinghaus&#x27; blessing in 2009. A television show with a similar format to the American version called &quot;Tunéame la nave&quot; was first broadcast on August 14, 2009, by Azteca shortly after the opening of the new business. According to Hernández, who became the host of the show, the franchise was opened with a &quot;high&quot; fee paid to Friedlinghaus to use the brand. The show continued for six seasons on Azteca, but it is unclear if there will be a 2017 season and where it will air. This is because on May 24, 2016, during airing of season six, Hernández announced that he was abandoning the &quot;West Coast Customs&quot; brand and company in favor of his own brand, &quot;PacifiCoast Customs&quot;. In an interview with &quot;TuningMex&quot;, Hernández stated that the new company had hired 20 employees, had an initial investment of MXN 2.5 million (), and would be based in Culiacán, Sinaloa, Mexico, describing the name change as similar to cutting &quot;an umbilical cord.&quot; In a separate interview, Hernández stated that when people in Mexico think of West Coast Customs, they think of him and not Ryan Friedlinghaus, thus hinting that he does not believe that the change in name will hurt business. Hernández stated that the new company is projected to work on only twenty cars in its first year, thus guaranteeing quality and that employees will not be overworked.

=== Never opened franchises ===
* A Japanese franchise is mentioned on the official WCC website, and a website announcing that it was &quot;coming soon!&quot; became available in 2009, and was online until March 13, 2012, but by April 13, 2012, the server hosting the site began returning a 403 error, and after November 7, 2012, the server hosting the website of the Japanese franchise went offline. In a 2013 video released by HP interviewing Friedlinghaus, the Japanese franchise&#x27;s logo was displayed as , despite the fact that no such company existed at the time. An address was never provided, no Japanese media wrote about the opening of the franchise, and no further information about it has been forthcoming from WCC, so it can be assumed that the Japanese franchise never opened.
* In 2010, Dana Florence traveled to St. Petersburg, for a question-and-answer session at the &quot;Active Open Air Show Cars&quot;, according to &quot;&quot;. A Russian franchise under the name &quot;&quot; is likewise mentioned by the company, but as of January 2017, as in the case of the Japanese franchise, there is no sign of its opening.
* A Malaysian franchise is also mentioned in the 2013 HP video as &quot;&quot;. The owner of the franchise claimed that he would bring &quot;official WCC merchandise to Malaysian shores&quot; in 2013, but has made no further posts as of December 2016.

=== Open franchises ===
Despite these setbacks, some franchisees have created successful businesses. 
* In 2007, Friedlinghaus announced a Dubai franchise to be owned by Al Ghussein Global Investments, which continues to operate as of December 2016. The Dubai franchise was opened with a fee of AED 18 million (US$4.9 million) paid to West Coast Customs to use its trademark. 
* On January 14, 2016, Friedlinghaus announced a further Shanghai franchise via a Facebook post. When the franchise opened on August 18, 2016, the event was met with substantial positive coverage by Chinese media, with articles appearing in the &quot;Qilu Evening News&quot;, auto magazine &quot;Autohome&quot;, and the website of Chinese television station Phoenix InfoNews Channel. The franchise is located at No. 218 Huajiang Road in Shanghai&#x27;s Jiading District.

<doc id="1266661" wikidata="Q1853837" url="?curid=1266661" title="United World College of the Adriatic">
<text>The United World College of the Adriatic (also known as &quot;UWC Adriatic,&quot; &quot;UWCAd,&quot; or in Italian, &quot;Collegio del Mondo Unito dell&#x27;Adriatico)&quot; is an international school in Italy, and a member of the United World Colleges, a global educational movement that brings together students from all over the world with the aim to foster peace and international understanding. The college is attended by around 180 students aged between 16 and 19, from around 80 countries, who live at the college for two years and study for the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme.

The college is located in the village of Duino, near the city of Trieste, in Italy&#x27;s north-eastern region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia, and is located less than 5 km from the Slovenian border. It was founded in 1982, with the support of the Italian government and regional authorities, who are still major financial supporters of the college.

== Founding ==
The United World Colleges were established by German educator Kurt Hahn, and the college is heavily influenced by his pedagogical philosophy. Following the founding the United World College of the Atlantic in 1962, further colleges were opened in Singapore (the United World College of South East Asia) and Canada (the Lester B Pearson United World College of the Pacific).

Lord Mountbatten, then the president of the United World Colleges, collaborated with Prince Raimond of Torre e Tasso, to found the United World College of the Adriatic in Duino, the first in the movement based in a non-English speaking country. With the support of local politician, former Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs and member of Parliament , a law was passed in 1976 which ensured that the regional government of Friuli-Venezia Giulia would provide funding and support for the new institution. The college continues to benefit from support from both the government of the Autonomous Region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia, and the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation.

The college welcomed its first students in 1982. In 1984, Prince Charles, having taken on the role as president of the International Council of the United World Colleges, inaugurated the third academic year in his first visit to the college.

==Students and staff==
The school hosts around 180 students across its two year program, from over 80 countries. In the academic year 2011–12, the student body consisted of 184 students, of which approximately 15% were Italian, 15% came from elsewhere in Western Europe, 20% from Eastern Europe, 15% from the Americas, 15% from Africa and the Middle East and 20% from Asia and Oceania. The majority of students attending the college benefit from financial support, with 17% receiving full scholarships and about three quarters of the student body on partial scholarships.

Most students attending the college are selected by UWC national selection committees in their home countries on the basis of academic achievement, leadership potential, extracurricular activities involvement and personal qualities, and are awarded scholarships based on need. The Italian national committee is responsible for the selection of Italian pupils to UWC Adriatic and for all of the United World Colleges, and acts under the patronage of the President of the Italian Republic.

Teachers are also hired internationally. In addition to being responsible for classroom teaching they act as personal tutors for groups of students and contribute to the running of activities and services.

The founding headmaster of the college was David B. Sutcliffe, an influential part of the United World Colleges movement, who had been the headmaster at the first UWC, Atlantic College. Since August 2022, the Rettore (headmaster) has been Khalid El-Metaal, who was previously the deputy head at the Toronto French School in Canada, and served as Deputy Headteacher at the Modern English School of Cairo. Since 2016, the president of the college has been Ambassador Cristina Ravaglia.

==College and facilities==

The college is integrated into the village of Duino, located on the Adriatic coast between Trieste and Monfalcone, with school buildings and facilities interspersed with residential and commercial properties. Students live in residences that are spread over the village, with the smallest housing 6 students, and the largest just over 50. The largest residence is part of the complex of the Duino castle, which towers over the town.

==Academics and extracurriculars==
The core academic curriculum at the college is the International Baccalaureate diploma, a two year, pre-university programme. Courses at the college are taught in English, but students are not selected on the basis of their ability to speak English. In addition, all students are required to take Italian classes, in order to participate and contribute to their local community. The college offers a range of subjects, including some that were first developed at the school. &quot;World Arts and Cultures,&quot; which was developed at the college as a school based syllabus, is now taught by IB schools in several countries. The college has a particular focus on musical education, collaborating with the Scuola Trio di Trieste, which offers professional musical education, and, together with Luther College, hosts the International Music Festival of the Adriatic.

The college offers various physical activities that take advantage of the school&#x27;s location, directly on the coast of the Adriatic Sea and close to the Alps, including activities such a cross-country and downhill skiing, hiking, kayaking, caving, and sailing. The creative activities program offers a wide variety of choices, ranging from drama to art, pottery, choir, and photography.

In addition to the academic requirements of the IB, the college places importance on the IB&#x27;s Creativity Action Service (CAS) requirement, which means that each student is required to commit to one creative activity, one physical activity and one social service.

==Other==

Students at the college are eligible, after graduation, to participate in the Shelby Davis Scholarship program, which funds undergraduate study, based on need, for UWC students at over 90 universities in the United States, including most Ivy League universities.

Beginning in 2023, Princess Ariane of the Netherlands will study at the school. Her father, King Willem-Alexander, and older sister, Princess Alexia, both studied at the United World College of the Atlantic.

<text>The St. Lawrence and Atlantic Railroad , known as St-Laurent et Atlantique Quebec in Canada, is a short-line railway operating between Portland, Maine, on the Atlantic Ocean, and Montreal, Quebec, on the St. Lawrence River. It crosses the Canada–US border at Norton, Vermont, and Stanhope, Quebec, and is owned by short-line operator Genesee &amp; Wyoming.

The line was built by the Atlantic and St. Lawrence Railroad in the U.S. and the St. Lawrence and Atlantic Railway in Canada, meeting at Island Pond, Vermont, south of the international border. Major communities served include Portland and Lewiston in Maine; Berlin, New Hampshire; Island Pond, Vermont; and Sherbrooke and Montreal in Quebec.

==History==

The line was proposed as a connection between Portland and Sherbrooke, Quebec, in 1844 by Portland entrepreneur John A. Poor. Portland was desperate to connect its ice-free port with Montreal, and Maine was at risk of being eclipsed by a similar proposal running from nearby Boston, Massachusetts. Writer, critic, and Atlantic and St. Lawrence Railroad investor, John Neal wrote of the necessity &quot;to drive Boston out of the business and secure [a] monopoly.&quot; Montreal saw an advantage in linking with the smaller port at Portland, and Poor&#x27;s idea became a reality.

=== Atlantic and St. Lawrence Railroad ===

The Atlantic and St. Lawrence Railroad was chartered in Maine on February 10, 1845; New Hampshire on July 30, 1847; and Vermont on October 27, 1848, to build a continuous line from Portland northwest into northeastern Vermont. William Pitt Preble was the railroad&#x27;s first president. The line was originally built to the Portland gauge of . Construction started in Portland on July 4, 1846. The first section, from Portland to Yarmouth, opened July 20, 1848. Further extensions up the Royal River to Danville (now Auburn) opened in October 1848 and to Mechanic Falls in February 1849. Construction then proceeded up the Little Androscoggin River to Oxford in September 1849 and Paris in March 1850. Construction was then completed down the Alder River to the Androscoggin River at Bethel in March 1851. Simultaneous construction of Portland gauge connecting railways occurred from Danville and Mechanic Falls. Sections into and within New Hampshire opened to Gorham on July 23, 1851, and Northumberland July 12, 1852, and the full distance to Island Pond, Vermont, on January 29, 1853.

Construction began with three locomotives built in Britain, but John Poor had organized the Portland Company with locomotive erecting shops adjacent to the railroad yard and wharves at Portland. Approximately half of the early Portland Company production was 25 Portland-gauge locomotives built for the Atlantic &amp; St. Lawrence. These 4-4-0 locomotives weighing 20 to 25 tons were augmented by locomotives built elsewhere when the road was completed to Montreal.

The St. Lawrence and Atlantic Railway was chartered to build the part of the line in Quebec, and on August 4, 1851, agreed to meet the Atlantic and St. Lawrence at Island Pond. Regular operations began April 4, 1853 between Montreal (Saint-Lambert) and Portland.

===Grand Trunk Railway===
Four months later, on August 5, 1853, the Grand Trunk Railway leased the two companies, giving the Toronto-Montreal line an extension east to Portland. A branch was also built from Richmond, Quebec, northeast to Point Levi, across the St. Lawrence River from Quebec City. Grand Trunk enlarged their waterfront facilities at Portland by purchasing land from Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. The increased traffic from Portland and Point Levi to Montreal placed significant demands on the small train ferry service across the St. Lawrence at Montreal, and this was replaced by the Victoria Bridge by 1860.

The locomotives burned wood exclusively until the cost of seasoned firewood increased during the winter of 1871–72 to make other fuels competitive. Peat from Quebec was used briefly before coal became the standard. Coal was used exclusively between Portland and Gorham by 1879, but use of wood continued for a few more years north of Gorham.

Interchange with standard gauge railroads became a problem during the 1860s. Grand Trunk equipped approximately 1,000 freight cars with experimental &quot;sliding-wheels&quot; in 1863 at company shops in Sarnia, Ontario, and Pointe-Saint-Charles in Montreal. Gauge could be adjusted by removing and inserting axle pins on special tapered-gauge track segments at interchange points. Safety problems were reported despite high maintenance costs. All lines west of Montreal were converted to standard gauge on October 3 and 4, 1873. Grand Trunk purchased 200 standard gauge locomotives (including 62 from Portland Company) and converted 135 old locomotives. Ten thousand standard gauge bogies were purchased for conversion of freight cars. The railway from Portland to Montreal was standard-gauged in September 1874.

During the week preceding the change, each section foreman made sure all ties on his section were properly adzed and clear of gravel. Spikes were laid out beside each tie, and some sidings were re-gauged before the main line. Two eight-man squads were assigned to each five-mile section. They slept by the track with their tools on the night of September 25, 1874. Work began at Portland when the last Portland gauge train from Island Pond arrived at 2:00 am September 26, and the main line was ready for standard gauge trains by 9:00 am the same day. The change resulted in nearly complete replacement of locomotives on the New England line, since most of the Portland gauge locomotives were sold or scrapped. Five new &quot;Burnside&quot; 2-6-0 locomotives from Rhode Island Locomotive Works had arrived in Portland from Boston to resume service.

The GTR line to Portland was built during the boom period for New England textile mills, and various mill towns in northern New England soon saw an influx of French Canadian workers who quickly found work in the region.

Grain elevators were constructed at Portland to facilitate storage and loading of Canadian wheat for export. The first elevator was built on Galt Wharf in 1863. The elevator with capacity for 150,000 bushels burned in 1873, and was replaced with a larger elevator in 1875. Portland Elevator Company built an elevator with capacity of one million bushels in 1897, and New England Elevator Company built the largest elevator on the Atlantic coast at the time, with capacity of 1.5 million bushels, in 1901.

By 1881, all wooden bridges had been replaced by iron and stone structures, and steel rail had replaced early iron rail. Fourteen steamship lines were serving the Grand Trunk wharves at Portland by 1896 with connections to Bristol, London, Liverpool, Glasgow, and Antwerp. Fifty steamships visited Portland that winter, and as many as seven could load simultaneously from the Grand Trunk wharves. More powerful 2-6-0 mogul locomotives increased freight train length from 16 to 30 cars.

Passenger train service included the &quot;Seaside and White Mountains Special&quot; (later called the &quot;International Limited&quot;) from Chicago to Portland, equipped with plush silk and mahogany-finished Pullman, dining, sleeping, parlor, and observation cars including a library and a barber shop. By 1946 this required a change of train in Montreal, taking #16 from Montreal to Portland (and #17 the reverse trip). As late as summer, 1963, the Canadian National/Grand Trunk operated this route as a weekends only train, equipped with coffee shop car in addition to coach, for the route from Montreal to Portland.

===Canadian National Railways Berlin subdivision===
The GTR&#x27;s bankruptcy in the early 1920s saw it nationalized by the Canadian federal government, which merged it into the nascent Canadian National Railways (CNR). Unfortunately for Portland, the CNR also included various other rail lines to ice-free Canadian ports in the Maritimes, notably Halifax, Nova Scotia, and their now ex-GTR mainline to Montreal soon became a secondary mainline under CNR as traffic dropped significantly. Within a decade, annual export tonnage leaving Portland declined to 21,000 tons, from an average of 600,000 tons during the early 1920s.

Canadian National class S 2-8-2s pulled through freight trains between Portland and Island Pond, while class O USRA 0-6-0s worked those yards and class N-4 2-8-0s pulled local wayfreights within the United States. Passenger trains were usually pulled by locomotives working out of Montreal. Canadian National class E-7 2-6-0 #713 worked the Lewiston branch, and was preserved at the Canadian Railway Museum when 16 class GR-17 EMD GP9 diesel locomotives replaced steam power in 1957. Five of the GP9s were equipped with steam generators for passenger service, while the other eleven had dynamic brakes for freight service. 

Paper mills remained a major source of traffic. Annual car loadings in 1973 were 12,758 for Berlin, 5,794 for Groveton, and 1,161 for Mechanic Falls; but the Boston and Maine Railroad carried some of the traffic for the New Hampshire mills. Dressed meat from Chicago to Maine continued to use the shorter Canadian routing as long as railway reefers remained competitive with highway trucking.

From 1934 to 1939 the twice-weekly &quot;Maine Coast Special&quot; from Montreal left the Grand Trunk at Yarmouth Junction to follow the Maine Central Railroad to Portland&#x27;s Union Station and then the Boston and Maine Railroad to the beach communities of Old Orchard Beach and Kennebunkport during July and August. The CNR class U-1 4-8-2 locomotives pulling as many as 17 car trains around Dominion Day would be serviced at Rigby Yard in South Portland before making the return trip. Daily except Sunday passenger trains 16 and 17 continued to carry a railway post office between Portland and Island Pond through the 1950s. These trains remained popular with summer vacationers from Montreal, and summer weekend service continued until 1967 after daily train service ended in 1960. Passengers were transported by bus from Portland station to Old Orchard Beach. Portland station was razed in 1966.

Despite the decline in traffic being handled over the line, its strategic connection to the Atlantic Ocean for Montreal saw other use arise during World War II. Bauxite from British Guiana was shipped via rail from Portland to avoid shipping losses to U-boats during the Battle of the St. Lawrence. The Portland–Montreal Pipe Line was built to carry oil from terminals in South Portland to refineries in Montreal; the pipeline followed the GTR route along certain parts and is still in use today. Wharves at Portland were used by the United States Navy as Casco Bay became destroyer base &quot;Sail&quot; during the Battle of the Atlantic. Grand Trunk Piers housed a Navy supply pier and training schools for combat information center (CIC), night visual lookouts, surface and aircraft recognition, search and fire control radar operators, gunnery spotting, anti-aircraft machine guns, and anti-submarine warfare (ASW) attack.

CNR (CN after the 1960s) continued to operate the Portland-Sherbrooke line as its Berlin Subdivision, but traffic continued to decline. By the late 1980s, following deregulation of the U.S. railroad industry, it became a candidate for divestiture to a shortline operator.

===St. Lawrence and Atlantic Railroad===
In 1989, the St. Lawrence and Atlantic Railroad was formed to take over operation of the Island Pond-Portland section, and several years later this was extended to the border at Norton. In 1998, following Canadian deregulation, the short-line operator formed a subsidiary St. Lawrence and Atlantic Railroad (Quebec) to operate the remaining line from the border at Norton through to Sainte-Rosalie, where it connects with the CNR main line to Montreal.

====Reactivated passenger service====
In April 2012, the Maine Department of Transportation put a project out to bid which would &quot;purchase, design, and construct a portion of rail line for future passenger service to Lewiston and Auburn.&quot; The potential passenger route would operate on tracks operated by the St. Lawrence and Atlantic Railroad. prospective operators of a night train from Montréal to Boston are attempting to get access to the St. Lawrence and Atlantic right-of-way for a 2014-passenger launch.

====Bridge collapse====
A bridge over the Saint-François River near Brompton, Quebec, collapsed on January 13, 2018. There were no injuries. The preliminary opinion is that the collapse was due to an ice jam and rapid water level rise following an unseasonal day of rain.

<text>The Sender Bielstein (Transmitter Bielstein) is an FM- and TV-broadcasting facility on the 393-metre-high Bielstein mountain in the Forest of Teutoburg, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. 

Bielstein transmitter, which is the property of Westdeutscher Rundfunk and used for transmitting its programmes was established in 1951. It used until 1954 a 60-metre-tall mast. This mast was replaced in 1954 by a 102-metre-tall antenna tower. However this mast was not able to supply the whole area with FM and TV-programmes and so a taller antenna mast was soon planned. Finally in 1968 construction work started for a 298-metre-tall guyed steel tube mast. This mast, which was completed in 1970 enabled a satisfactory supply of FM- and TV-programmes in the area.

On January 15, 1985, at 6.26 MST as result of too much ice load and great wind-induced stress, one of the upper guys of the mast was torn off. As result the mast bent and cracked 160 metres above ground. Afterwards the rest of the mast collapsed as the falling upper parts destroyed the guys holding its lower parts.
Already on the afternoon of that day as replacement for the first FM-transmitter which used the mast went on air again, by using a communication tower of Deutsche Telekom as the transmission site. Three days later, TV broadcasting was also restored. On Bielstein mountain, a temporary 85-metre-tall auxiliary transmission mast for transmitting the TV and FM-programmes was erected. Of course, reception of the signals radiated from this auxiliary mast was much worse than from the former 298 metre mast and so construction work for a new 302-metre-tall guyed lattice steel mast started, which was completed in August 1986.

In April 2006 the mast got a new antenna for DVB-T broadcasting, which reduced its height to 290 metres.

<doc id="1266674" wikidata="Q3066918" url="?curid=1266674" title="Jo Ann Robinson">
<text>Jo Ann Gibson Robinson (April 17, 1912 – August 29, 1992) was an activist during the Civil Rights Movement and educator in Montgomery, Alabama.

==Early life==
Born Jo Ann Gibson, near Culloden, Georgia, on April 17, 1912, she was the youngest of twelve children. Her parents were Owen Boston and Dollie Webb Gibson, who had owned a farm. Her father died when Robinson was only 6 years old. After her father&#x27;s death, Robinson, her mother, and her eleven other siblings moved to Macon, Georgia. Robinson excelled in school and earned valedictorian at her high school in her graduating year. She became the first person in her family to graduate from college, attending Fort Valley State College.

==Career and college==
Robinson graduated from Fort Valley State College with her Bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1934. After college, she became a public school teacher in Macon, where she was married to Wilbur Robinson for a short time. Five years later, she went to Atlanta, where she earned an M.A. in English at Atlanta University. Robinson continued her education even after earning her Masters at New York&#x27;s Columbia University, and continued to study English. Shortly after, she went to teach at Mary Allen College. After teaching in Texas, she then accepted a position at Alabama State College (now Alabama State University) in Montgomery. She was also active in the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church.

==Women&#x27;s Political Council (WPC)==
 It was in Montgomery, Alabama, where Robinson joined the Women&#x27;s Political Council, which Mary Fair Burks had founded three years earlier. The WPC was an organization dedicated to inspiring African Americans to rise above the level of mediocrity that they had been conditioned to accept, to fight juvenile delinquency, increase voter registration in the African American community, and to improve their status as a group. The WPC was also in the development in women&#x27;s involvement in civic affairs, worked towards encouraging African Americans to vote, and helping women who were victims of rape.

==Segregation on Montgomery buses==
In 1949, Robinson was verbally attacked by a bus driver for sitting in the front &quot;Whites only&quot; section of the bus. The whites-only section was empty except for one person 2 rows in front of her. Out of fear that the incident would escalate and that the driver would go from verbal abuse to physical, Robinson chose to leave the bus. Her response to the incident was to attempt to start a protest boycott against bus segregation in Alabama. However, when Robinson approached fellow WPC members with her story and proposal, she was told that it was &quot;a fact of life in Montgomery.&quot; In late 1950, she succeeded Burks as president of the WPC and helped focus the group&#x27;s efforts on buses, becoming an outspoken critic of the treatment of African Americans on public transportation. To further her efforts, Robinson met with William A. Gayle, the mayor of Montgomery at the time. Robinson met with City Hall&#x27;s council, but they were not interested in what she had to say. When City Hall&#x27;s leaders were no help, Robinson took matters into her own hands and organized a boycott once again. 
The WPC made complaints to the Montgomery City Commission about the bus seating and abusive drivers. They achieved some concessions, including an undertaking that drivers would be courteous, and having buses stop at every corner in Black neighborhoods as they did in white areas.

After &quot;Brown vs. Board of Education&quot; (1954), Robinson informed the mayor of the city that a boycott would soon rise. After Rosa Parks&#x27; arrest, they seized the moment to plan the Montgomery bus boycott.

On Thursday, December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks was arrested for refusing to move from her seat in the black area of the bus she was traveling on to make way for a white passenger who was standing. Parks, a civil rights organizer, had intended to instigate a reaction from white citizens and authorities. That night, with Parks&#x27; permission, Robinson stayed up mimeographing 35,000 handbills calling for a boycott of the Montgomery bus system, with the help of the chairman of the Alabama State College business department, John Cannon, and two students. The boycott was supported and fought by many. In a 1976 interview, Robinson pointed out, &quot;That boycott was not supported by a few people; it was supported by 52,000 people&quot;. The boycott was initially planned for just the following Monday. Robinson passed out the leaflets at a Friday afternoon meeting of AME Zionist clergy, among other places, and Reverend L. Roy Bennett requested other ministers attend a meeting that Friday night and to urge their congregations to take part in the boycott. Robinson, Reverend Ralph Abernathy, two of her senior students and other WPC members then passed out the handbills to high school students leaving school that afternoon.

After the success of the one-day boycott, Black citizens decided to continue the boycott and established the Montgomery Improvement Association to focus their efforts. The Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. was elected president. Robinson never became a member of this group. She had declined an official position to the Montgomery Improvement Association because of her teaching position at Alabama State. She served on its executive board and edited their newsletter, at King&#x27;s request. Behind the scenes, Robinson also helped in carpooling African Americans to work. She was so involved King took notice in his memoir of the boycott, Stride Towards Freedom. Dr. King said of Robinson, &quot;Apparently indefatigable, she, perhaps more than any other person, was active on every level of protest&quot;. In order to protect her position at Alabama State College, and to protect her colleagues, Robinson purposely stayed out of the limelight, even though she worked diligently with the MIA. Robinson and other WPC members also helped sustain the boycott by providing transportation for boycotters.

Robinson was the target of several acts of intimidation. Robinson was arrested many times. In February 1956, a local police officer threw a stone through the window of her house. Then two weeks later, another police officer poured acid on her car. The violence was so bad that the governor of Alabama ordered the state police to guard the houses of the boycott leaders. The boycott lasted over a year because the bus company would not give in to the demands of the protesters. On December 20, 1956, the boycotts finally ended after the federal district court deemed segregated seating was unconstitutional. However, Robinson fought hard and took great pride in the eventual success of the boycott. In her memoir, Robinson wrote, &quot;An oppressed but brave people, whose pride and dignity rose to the occasion, conquered fear, and faced whatever perils had to be confronted. The boycott was the most beautiful memory that all of us who participated will carry to our final resting place.&quot; The Montgomery bus boycott broke through and gave real hope as it helped to inspire other protests because of its success and, of course, lead to many protests with the importance of nonviolence that MLK preached. After a student sit-in in early 1960, Robinson and other teachers who supported the students resigned their positions at Alabama State College. Robinson left Alabama State College and moved out of Montgomery that year. She taught at Grambling College in Louisiana for one year then moved to Los Angeles and taught English in the public school system. In Los Angeles, she continued to be active in local women&#x27;s organizations. Robinson taught in the LA schools until she retired from teaching in 1976. Robinson was strongly against discrimination. Robinson inspired many young women to join the protest and to fight. Robinson said, &quot;Women&#x27;s leadership was no less important to the development of the Montgomery Bus Boycott than was the male and minister-dominated leadership.&quot;

Robinson&#x27;s memoir, &quot;The Montgomery Bus Boycott and the Women Who Started It&quot;, edited by David J. Garrow, was published in 1987 by the University of Tennessee Press.

==Legacy==
In 2021, the Georgia Historical Society erected a historical marker for The Birthplace of Jo Ann Gibson Robinson in Monroe County, Georgia.

On September 17, 2021, the Alabama State University board of trustees voted unanimously to name a residence hall after Robinson. The naming ceremony took place in April 2022.

<doc id="1266676" wikidata="Q4774324" url="?curid=1266676" title="Anti-bias curriculum">
<text>The anti-bias curriculum is a curriculum which attempts to challenge prejudices such as racism, sexism, ableism, ageism, weightism, homophobia, classism, colorism, heightism, handism, religious discrimination and other forms of kyriarchy. The approach is favoured by civil rights organisations such as the Anti-Defamation League. Bias refers to violation of equality based on equal opportunities (formal equality) or based on equality of outcomes for different groups, also called substantive equality.

The [[Anti-racism|anti-racist]] curriculum is part of a wider social constructivist movement in the various societies of the Western World, where many scientific worldviews are seen as manifestations of Western cultures who enjoy a privileged position over societies from the &quot;Global South&quot;, along with claiming that there is a sociocultural aspect to education, i.e. that the studies of these subjects in Western societies have usually exhibited racial and cultural bias, and that they focus too much on &quot;dead white men&quot;, especially in mathematics.

== Purpose ==
The anti-bias curriculum is seen by its proponents as a catalyst in the critical analysis of various social conditions. It is implemented with the intent of reducing social oppression with the ultimate goal of &quot;social justice&quot; in mind.

== Examples ==
Margaret Thatcher, in a speech made during the Conservative Party Conference of 1987, referred to &quot;hard left education authorities and extremist teachers&quot; teaching &quot;anti-racist mathematics—whatever that may be.&quot; and later on in 2005, &quot;Fox News&quot; carried a story detailing &quot;The &#x27;anti-racist education&#x27; program in place at Newton Public Schools.&quot;

The article &quot;The Politics of Anti-Racist Mathematics&quot; by George Gheverghese Joseph goes through many different assumptions made by teachers of mathematics that can have a negative effect on students of ethnic minorities. An anti-racist approach to mathematics education could include any or all of the following:
* Discussion of the mathematical knowledge of ancient civilizations outside of Europe, and non-European contributions to mathematical knowledge and discovery;
* The avoidance of racial stereotypes or cultural bias in classroom material, textbooks, coursework topics and examination questions. For example, a wide range of names from various ethnic backgrounds might be used in word problem questions.

American mathematics instructor Shahid Muhammed has suggested that poor mathematics performance among African Americans is linked to higher anxiety caused by negative stereotyping, as he states that many associate mathematics with middle-class white people.

==Criticism==
There has been criticism of aspects of the anti-bias curriculum. Eastern Washington University professor Deirdre Almeida has stated that most anti-bias curricula omit the contributions of non-African ethnic groups, such as Native Americans, Inuit and Alaska Natives. Almeida has claimed that portrayals of Native Americans in anti-bias material conflate actual aboriginal practices with invented, obsolete or erroneous ideas about Native American culture.

Other critics, such as University of Tennessee professor J. Amos Hatch, have claimed that some anti-bias curricula can be construed as actively or passively adopting an anti-European/western racial bias, seeking to minimize contributions of ethnic Europeans in favor of other ethnic groups. Hatch has stated that this ideology has produced &quot;anti-bias&quot; curricula that are overtly biased against people of European descent or in favor of people of African descent.

<text>z/VM is the current version in IBM&#x27;s VM family of virtual machine operating systems. First released in October 2000, z/VM remains in active use and development . It is directly based on technology and concepts dating back to the 1960s, particularly IBM&#x27;s CP/CMS on the IBM System/360-67 (see article History of CP/CMS for historical details). z/VM runs on IBM&#x27;s IBM Z family of computers and can support large numbers (thousands) of Linux virtual machines. (See Linux on IBM Z.)

On 16 September 2022, IBM released z/VM Version 7.3 which requires z/Architecture, implemented in IBM&#x27;s EC12, BC12 and later models.

<doc id="1266684" wikidata="Q954120" url="?curid=1266684" title="Monty Norman">
<text>Monty Norman ( Noserovitch; 4 April 1928 – 11 July 2022) was a British film score composer and singer. A contributor to West End musicals in the 1950s and 1960s, he is best known for composing the &quot;James Bond Theme&quot;, first heard in the 1962 film &quot;Dr. No&quot;. He was an Ivor Novello Award and Olivier Award winner, and a Tony Award nominee.

==Early life==
Monty Norman was born on 4 April 1928 in Stepney in the East End of London. His father, Abraham Noserovitch (anglicised to Norman), was a Jewish cabinet maker who immigrated to the United Kingdom from Latvia when he was a child; his mother, Ann (Berlyn), who was also Jewish, worked as a seamstress. He lived with his Jewish immigrant grandparents for the first few years of his life.

As a child during World War II, Norman was evacuated to St Albans from London but later returned during the Blitz. His mother gave him his first guitar (a Gibson) when he was sixteen. As a young man he did national service in the Royal Air Force, where he became interested in pursuing a career in singing. He also worked as a barber during this time.

==Career==
During the 1950s and early 1960s, Norman was a singer for big bands such as those of Cyril Stapleton, Stanley Black, Ted Heath, and Nat Temple. He also sang in various variety shows, sharing top billing with other singers and comedy stars such as Benny Hill, Harry Secombe, Peter Sellers, Spike Milligan, Harry Worth, Tommy Cooper, Jimmy James, and Tony Hancock. One of his songs, &quot;False-Hearted Lover&quot;, was successful internationally.

From the late 1950s, he moved from singing to composing, including songs for performers such as Cliff Richard, Tommy Steele, Count Basie, and Bob Hope, and lyrics for musicals and (subsequently) films. In 1957 and 1958, he wrote lyrics for the musicals &quot;Make Me an Offer&quot;, the English-language version of &quot;Irma la Douce&quot; (based on a 1956 French musical written by Alexandre Breffort and Marguerite Monnot; the English version was nominated for a Broadway Tony Award in 1961), and &quot;Expresso Bongo&quot; (which &quot;Time Out&quot; called the first rock and roll musical). &quot;Expresso Bongo&quot;, written by Wolf Mankowitz, was a West End hit and was later made into a 1960 film starring a young Cliff Richard. Norman&#x27;s later musicals include &quot;Songbook&quot; (also known as &quot;The Moony Shapiro Songbook in New York&quot;), which was also nominated for a Broadway Tony and won an Ivor Novello Award; and &quot;Poppy&quot; (1982), which was also nominated for the Ivor Novello Award, and won the SWET award (renamed &quot;the Laurence Olivier Awards&quot; in 1984) for &quot;Best Musical&quot;. His further film work included music for the Hammer movie &quot;The Two Faces of Dr. Jekyll&quot; (1960), &quot;The Day the Earth Caught Fire&quot; (1961), the Bob Hope Eon Productions movie &quot;Call Me Bwana&quot; (1963), and the TV miniseries &quot;Dickens of London&quot; (1976). 

Norman worked for several years on his unpublished autobiography, titled &quot;A Walking Stick Full of Bagels.&quot;

== James Bond Theme ==
Norman is best known for writing the &quot;James Bond Theme&quot;, the signature theme of the James Bond franchise, and the score to the first James Bond film, &quot;Dr. No&quot;. Norman received royalty payments for the theme from 1962 on. However, as the producers were dissatisfied with Norman&#x27;s arrangement, John Barry re-arranged the theme. Barry later claimed that it was actually he who wrote the theme, but Norman won two different libel actions against Barry&#x27;s claim he was the composer, the last against &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in 2001. In the made-for-DVD documentary &quot;Inside Dr. No&quot;, Norman performed a music piece that he wrote for an unproduced stage musical based on &quot;A House for Mr Biswas&quot; several years earlier, entitled &quot;Bad Sign, Good Sign&quot;, that he claimed resembles the melody of the &quot;James Bond Theme&quot; in several places.

Norman collected around £485,000 or £600,000 in royalties between 1976 and 1999 for the use of the theme since &quot;Dr. No&quot;.

==Personal life==
Norman married actress Diana Coupland in 1956. Together, they had a daughter before divorcing in 1975. He later married Rina Caesari in 2000 or 2001. They remained married until his death. He was a worshipper at the Liberal Jewish Synagogue. 

Norman died on 11 July 2022 at a hospital in Slough. He was 94, and suffered from an unspecified short illness prior to his death.

<text>The Eifel Transmitter () is an FM and TV transmission facility for the German broadcasting company of SWR and is located on the Scharteberg near Kirchweiler, Germany. Until 1985, the Scharteberg transmitter used a 160 metre tall guyed mast. However this mast did not allow good reception in deep valleys, so in 1985 a new, 302 metre tall, guyed, steel framework mast was built, becoming the tallest structure of Rhineland-Palatinate.
The elements of this mast were built by the firm of Hein, Lehmann AG, whilst construction work was carried out by BBS AG, Ludwigshafen. The first 20 metres of the mast were built using a small crane. The mast elements in heights between 20 and 100 metres were mounted by the aid of a car crane, while for the sections above a derrick crane was used.
The new mast of Scharteberg transmitter consists of a 288 metre tall, guyed, lattice, steel structure with a square cross section, a side length of 2.1 metres and a 14 metre long GFK-cylinder on top for the UHF antenna. The total weight of the structure is 204 tons.
The mast is guyed at 4 levels, 57, 123, 195 and 273 metres above ground. It is equipped with an elevator which runs up to a height of 281 metres.
For aircraft warning 20 red neon lamps and two blinking lights with 1000 watt lamps are installed.

<text>Forvie was a village in what is now the Forvie National Nature Reserve, located at the modern location of Rockend some fourteen miles north of Aberdeen. It was one of several settlements in northeast Scotland that have been overcome by sand dunes.

There are visible remains of the 12th-century church of St Adamnan and other remains were found by a survey in the 1950s. Little is known of the village, which is believed to have been abandoned during the 15th century. There are records, however, of good oats harvests.

<text>Proletcult Theatre (Russian: Театры Пролеткульта; abbr. from Proletarian Cultural and Educational Organizations Theatre) was the theatrical branch of the Soviet cultural movement Proletcult. It was concerned with the powerful expression of ideological content as political propaganda in the years following the revolution of 1917. Platon Kerzhentsev was one of its principal practitioners.

It was used as a tool of political agitation that promoted a culture of the factory-floor and industrial motifs, but also folk singing and avant-garde. Plot was unimportant; its goal was to shock the audience with its style of performance, lighting techniques, props, radio broadcasts, blown-up newspaper headlines and slogans, projected films, circus elements, etc.

The Proletcult Theatre attempted to affect the audience psychologically and emotionally, producing a shock in the spectator, the effect of which is to make the viewer aware of the condition of their own lives. This style is often referred to as the theatre of attractions, where an attraction is any aggressive emotional shock that provides the opportunity to raise awareness of the ideological reality of life (to “defamiliarize the familiar”), particularly the mundane material reality.

Prince Serge Wolkonsky taught and gave lectures for Proletcult.

Russian film director Sergei Eisenstein was at one time in charge of the Proletcult Theatre before pursuing his film work. His most significant production for the Proletcult was an adaptation of Aleksandr Ostrovsky&#x27;s satirical comedy &quot;Enough Stupidity in Every Wise Man&quot; in April 1923. He continued many of the experimental and ideologically expressive elements of this theatrical form in his films and intellectual montage technique.

Proletcult collapsed at the end of the civil war due to external as well as internal factors, such disputes among leaders and between intellectuals and workers; it lingered on in vestigial form in the 1920s.

<text>This is a list of England cricket captains, comprising all the men, women and youths who have captained an England cricket team at official international level. The international match categories are Test, One Day International (ODI) and Twenty20 International (T20I).

International cricket began in 1877 when the England men&#x27;s team played in the first-ever Test match. England have played more Test matches, and had more captains, than any other team. In the 19th century, the captains for overseas tours were chosen by the promoters. The early tours were mostly organised by professionals, especially James Lillywhite, Alfred Shaw and Arthur Shrewsbury. Some amateur-led tours went abroad under Lord Harris and Lord Hawke. Home captains were selected by the home ground authority, who often favoured a local player. For over 73 years, commencing with the 1903–04 tour of Australia and ending with the Centenary Test in 1977, Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) organised international tours and selected the England team. On these tours, the team was called MCC in non-international matches and England in the internationals. MCC established a tradition of having amateur, rather than professional, captains. After Shrewsbury in 1886–87, there was no professional captain until Len Hutton in 1952. The amateur/professional distinction was abolished in 1962, though some former amateurs captained England after that. In 1971, Ray Illingworth captained England in their first ODI. In 1977, management of the England team was taken over by the former Test and County Cricket Board (TCCB) until 1 January 1997, and from then by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB). England played their first T20I in 2005 under the captaincy of Michael Vaughan.

The England Women&#x27;s team made their international debut on the 1934–35 tour of Australia and New Zealand when they were captained by Betty Archdale. Women&#x27;s internationals were played sporadically until the last quarter of the 20th century when ODIs became frequent. The first ODI match was played in 1973 when England Women were led by Rachael Heyhoe-Flint. England Women&#x27;s first T20I was played in 2004 under the captaincy of Clare Connor.

The England under-19 cricket team began playing Test matches in 1974 and ODI matches in 1976. Their first captains were Nigel Briers and Chris Cowdrey respectively.

In 1970, the proposed South African tour of England was aborted. To replace the tour, a series of five games was played between a &quot;Rest of the World&quot; XI and the England Test team. At the time, these matches were thought of as Test matches. However, later they were stripped of Test status.

Tahir Mirza served as editor of Dawn newspaper from September 2003 to June 2006, when he resigned from this job due to failing health.
He died on 29 May 2007 in Aga Khan Hospital, Karachi, of lung cancer.

During his long career as a journalist, he showed no regrets as having chosen journalism as his career even though it was not among the best paying jobs in Pakistan. He once told his journalist colleagues, &quot;Given a chance, I will repeat it all over again&quot;.

Another famous quote by him is...&quot;The only way to get respect is to show respect; and be always respected for your hard work. Once you do that there is no reason why anyone will not respect you&quot;.

<text>The Forvie National Nature Reserve is a national nature reserve owned and managed by NatureScot. It is located north of Newburgh in Aberdeenshire, in the northeast of Scotland. The reserve includes the Sands of Forvie, which are the fifth largest sand dune system in Britain, and the least disturbed by human activity. The dune system is an integral part of the Ythan Estuary, which also forms part of the reserve, and separates the sands from Balmedie beach.

The reserve contained at one point the largest breeding colony of breeding common eider in Britain and while they are still a protected feature of the reserve the eider colony suffered dramatic losses starting in 2006 and the subsequent years. The reserve also hosts an internationally important ternery and a protected seal haul-out containing both common seals and grey seals, predominantly the latter.

The area is designated as a both a Special Protection Area and a Special Area of Conservation under the Natura 2000 scheme, as well as being a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The site is designated a Category II protected area by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

The sands were the site of the village of Forvie that was abandoned due to drifting sands.

==Sands of Forvie==
The Sands of Forvie are one of the largest areas of blown sand in Scotland. The sand at Forvie is formed from the remains of sediment that was transported by rivers to the coast at the end of the last ice age. The sediment settled in the sea, but was gradually washed onshore by the action of waves and wind.

The sand dunes at Forvie can be divided into three distinct parts. The southernmost point of the reserve consists of a sand spit at the point where the River Ythan enters the sea. To the north the sand rests on raised beaches terraces and glaciated rocks. North of this region is an area where the sand lies on top of a rock plateau, with glacial deposits of varying depths sandwiched between the rock and the sand. The dunes are highly mobile, and can reach up to in height. As there is relatively little plant life on these mobile dunes, they have been likened to the Sahara Desert.

==Flora and fauna==

The reserve contains large areas of sandy foreshore, mobile and fixed dunes, dune pasture and lowland heath and the successional development of vegetation. The sand dunes are of various stages of evolution and contain plethora of plant species including marram grass (&quot;Ammophila arenaria&quot;), red fescue, (&quot;Festuca rubra&quot;), crowberry, (&quot;Empetrum nigrum&quot;), the cross-leaved heath (&quot;Erica tetralix&quot;), common sedge, (&quot;Carex nigra&quot;), marsh pennywort (&quot;Hydrocotyle vulgaris&quot;) and the invasive creeping willow (&quot;Salix repens&quot; ssp. &quot;argentea&quot;). Vascular plants are an identified and protected feature of the reserve under the Sands of Forvie and Ythan Estuary SSSI. 15 species are identified on reserve with 10 of which are red book listed species (&quot;Astragalus danicus&quot;, &quot;Carex maritima&quot;, &quot;Coeloglossum viride&quot;, &quot;Corollarhiza trifida&quot;, &quot;Gentianella campestris&quot;, &quot;Platanthera bifolia&quot;, &quot;Salsola kali&quot;, &quot;Mertensia maritima&quot;, &quot;Radiola linoides&quot; and &quot;Teesdalia nudicaulis&quot;) and five of which are classified as UK scarce species (&quot;Equisetum variegatum&quot;, &quot;Festuca arenaria&quot;, &quot;Ophioglossum azoricum&quot;, &quot;Potamogeton filiformis&quot;, &quot;Puccinellia distans&quot;).

Four species of tern breed at Forvie, building their nests among the dunes and on the beach. Little terns and arctic terns favour the foreshore and raised beaches, while the sandwich terns and common terns nest amongst the marram tussocks of the dune system. The breeding success of the terns has fluctuated widely over the years, and since 1995 NatureScot have undertaken selected culling of predating species, specifically crows, gulls and foxes. In addition to culling, NatureScot have also trialled the use of decoy terns to attract little terns into the areas protected from foxes by fences, as well as providing artificial shelters for tern chicks to use to avoid crows and gulls. In recent years the colonies of sandwich tern and black headed gulls have had great success in breeding with some of the highest populations recorded to date in 2019.

The mudflats of the estuary provide an important wintering ground for migratory birds such as wigeon, oystercatcher, golden plover, lapwing, dunlin, curlew and redshank, and around 15,000 geese may be seen on the estuary each spring. The reserve hosts a population of protected breeding eider that spend the breeding season on reserve, with many heading to the Tay estuary for the winter, although there is also a smaller population that remains year-round. In 2005 the reserve held a population of over 5000 eiders but has since suffered losses and in 2019 recorded a spring peak of 1323 eiders.

The cliffs in the northern part of the reserve host breeding colonies of many seabirds, including northern fulmar, shag, cormorant, kittiwake and razorbill. Raptor species such as short-eared owls, kestrel, sparrowhawk, osprey and buzzard are also regularly seen, and in total 255 species of bird have been recorded at Forvie.
Forvie is a popular site for viewing grey and common seals, which haul out onto beaches and mudflats at the mouth of the Ythan estuary. The Protection of Seals (Designated Sea Haul-out Sites) (Scotland) Order 2014 introduced additional protection for seals at 194 designated haul-out sites and in 2017 the seal haul-out site at Forvie National Nature reserve was granted this designation and legal protection. To avoid disturbance to the seals the advised viewpoint is established on the Newburgh beach. The population is growing rapidly with numbers anywhere between 1,000 and 3,000 seals present.

Bottlenose dolphins visit the seas off Forvie, and there is a population of otter on the River Ythan. Other mammals found at Forvie and those typical of northeast Scotland such roe deer, red foxes, badgers and stoats.

==History==
The coastline at Forvie has a long history of human occupation. The earliest evidence of human activity takes the form of flint working sites and shell middens, which date from around 8,000 years ago. Excavations have also revealed burial cairns from the Neolithic period (around 6,000 years ago), and kerb cairns (built to hold cremation remains) dating from the Bronze Age. Other Bronze Age objects found at Forvie include pieces of a quern-stone and fragments of pottery. The remains of a small village of 31 huts dating from around 700 BC have also been identified. Finds from the village include jet beads, bracelets, querns and pottery.

In 1959 the Sands of Forvie was declared a national nature reserve (NNR) by agreement between the Nature Conservancy Council (predecessor body of NatureScot) and the landowners; the NNR was extended in 1979 to include the Ythan Estuary. In 2003 were purchased from the landowners, with the remaining land being purchased in 2012.

===During the World Wars===

Forvie was active in World Wars I and II, although very few details are recorded on the use of the area. It was incorrectly claimed there was a nine-hole golf course from 1900 to the outbreak of World War II. The course built for Lady Cathcart in 1900 was on the west coast island Uist.

The layout of Forvie and Newburgh could be mistaken for the mouth of the River Don in Aberdeen. With this in mind, defences were put in places around the mouth of the Ythan. These consisted of pillboxes, two gun batteries and anti-tank blocks built by the 143rd Pioneer Corps. From a review of vulnerable beaches from April–October 1941, Forvie appeared on this list and was identified as &quot;blocked with mines&quot;. The minefield ran from East to West (WO ref 31/521474 to 538472). These were British Type C land mines weighing about 65 lbs each. 

Following a clear-up of the area in July 1944, a number of landmines were unaccounted for due to the shifting sands of the area. Mine clearance altered the area slightly as the Bomb Disposal Unit from the Royal Engineers used a converted Bren gun carrier (known as a wasp) as a flamethrower to scorch vegetation on the mined area. Images of the clearance and the location of the minefield is recorded in a local book covering World War II in northeastern Scotland. Records show on some days 222 mines being dealt with, the actual mine count is unknown but the area took several months to clear. On 27 July 1944, Sapper Harry Dean (28) of 11 coy, Royal Engineers was killed whilst clearing a mine at Forvie. Sapper Dean is buried in Yorkshire.

Forvie sands was used to train the Gordon Highlanders and Highland Light Infantry in desert warfare, in addition to this Forvie Moor was used to train soldiers in the use of grenade, anti-tank grenades and two-inch trench mortars. Since the war, mortar bombs have been found across the moor. Craters are still visible in the area. The soldiers training at Forvie were billeted at the Slains Lodge and buildings in Collieston.

On 3 November 1940, 30 High Explosive Bombs were dropped on Forvie Links by the Luftwaffe. This is listed in the Aberdeenshire Civil Defence register, the craters can be seen in 1941 and 1946 aerial photos.

Whilst soldiers were training there, the moor were off limits to locals. However, on Sundays, the locals could use the moor. During this time, locals collected birds eggs to use as food was rationed, and there was a plentiful supply of rabbits. On Sunday 30 November 1941, three local boys found an unexploded anti-tank grenade in a rabbit burrow that the army had been demonstrating to the home guard. One of the boys (Alex Ross), then threw it away where it exploded causing him to lose sight in one eye.

On 31 March 1941, the British steamer &quot;Melrose Abbey&quot; ran aground. On 2 April 1941 she was hit by a drifting sea mine blowing a large hole in her side, and settled on the Ythan river bed. During this time, a machine gun was posted at Forvie Sands to offer some protection for the vessel whilst plans were made to move her as she was a target for passing aircraft. The ship was refloated on 26 July 1941 and towed to Aberdeen for repairs. She was later sunk by U-356 on 27 December 1942 north-east of the Azores. Several websites confirm this sinking, but this disagrees with the information in the reference below, which states that &quot;As for Melrose Abbey, she was released from the Royal Navy in May 1945 and returned to her former owners, the Associated Humber Lines.&quot; The second reference may help to resolve this mix-up of ship names.

Beside the pill box of Forvie, two mobile naval four-inch guns were places and controlled by 942nd Defence battery.

On 26 January 1942, the SS &quot;Lesrix&quot;, which was carrying machinery, ran aground off Hackley head during a blizzard. Locals in the community aided in the rescue of some of the crew, although ten crew members were lost. A bronze medal for gallantry was given by the King to one local for his part.

During patrols on the beach and cliffs of Forvie, a dinghy was found and this sparked a search for a spy that had been landed by submarine. This spy was caught in the moray area. It was rumoured that Tillery house near Udny had fascist sympathizers, where spies and airmen were told this was a &quot;safe house&quot; during the war. Since there were also Norwegian army personnel in the area who patrolled the beaches, the coast guard and home guard were issued with passes to identify themselves to the Norwegian soldiers.

In 1948, the Forvie area was earmarked to be a bombing and artillery range for the Royal Air Force and Army, as a site further north than the existing area at Lunan Bay near Arbroath. Forvie was to be used for air to ground and dive bombing practice. This involved a gunnery range out at sea and a rifle range on the moor. This proposal was cancelled in 1950; records exist in the National Archives on the proposal.

=== Folklore ===
The deserted village of Forvie lies within the sand dunes. Excavations of the village church, which is dedicated to Saint Adamnan, shown that it was constructed in the 12th-century, and the dating of burials within the church indicate that it had become a ruin by the 15th-century: local folk history tells of a nine-day storm that occurred from a curse of three daughters deprived the inheritance of the land by dirty means, leading to the village being engulfed by sand in August 1413. The daughters were said to have prayed to heaven for the land to be made &#x27;worthless.&#x27; Their prayer concluded: &quot;Let nocht bee funde in Furvye&#x27;s glebys Bot thystl, bente and sande.&quot; The parish of Forvie was annexed by the neighbouring parish of Slains in 1573.

==Visitors==
The Forvie National Nature Reserve is visited by around 35,000 people each year. Stevenson Forvie Centre near Collieston at the northern end of the reserve provides information to visitors. The centre first opened in the 1980s, and was substantially upgraded in 1998 with funding from Shell and a bequest from a local resident, Margaret Stevenson, after whom the centre is now named.

Two waymarked trails to allow visitors to access the reserve. The Dune Trail is a circular route around the southern part of the reserve, through the dunes landscape and out to the beach, passing the site of the abandoned village and the ruins of the kirk. The Heath Trail is a circular route starting and finishing at the visitor centre, passing through the heathland of the northern part of the reserve. The two paths can be linked by a path running along the seafront.

<doc id="1266713" wikidata="Q859176" url="?curid=1266713" title="Cayley's formula">
<text>In mathematics, Cayley&#x27;s formula is a result in graph theory named after Arthur Cayley. It states that for every positive integer formula_1, the number of trees on formula_1 labeled vertices is formula_3.

The formula equivalently counts the spanning trees of a complete graph with labeled vertices .

==Proof==
Many proofs of Cayley&#x27;s tree formula are known.
One classical proof of the formula uses Kirchhoff&#x27;s matrix tree theorem, a formula for the number of spanning trees in an arbitrary graph involving the determinant of a matrix. Prüfer sequences yield a bijective proof of Cayley&#x27;s formula. Another bijective proof, by André Joyal, finds a one-to-one transformation between &quot;n&quot;-node trees with two distinguished nodes and maximal directed pseudoforests.
A proof by double counting due to Jim Pitman counts in two different ways the number of different sequences of directed edges that can be added to an empty graph on n vertices to form from it a rooted tree; see .

== History ==
The formula was first discovered by Carl Wilhelm Borchardt in 1860, and proved via a determinant. In a short 1889 note, Cayley extended the formula in several directions, by taking into account the degrees of the vertices. Although he referred to Borchardt&#x27;s original paper, the name &quot;Cayley&#x27;s formula&quot; became standard in the field.

== Other properties ==

Cayley&#x27;s formula immediately gives the number of labelled rooted forests on &quot;n&quot; vertices, namely .
Each labelled rooted forest can be turned into a labelled tree with one extra vertex, by adding a vertex with label and connecting it to all roots of the trees in the forest.

There is a close connection with rooted forests and parking functions, since the number of parking functions on &quot;n&quot; cars is also . A bijection between rooted forests and parking functions was given by M. P. Schützenberger in 1968.

=== Generalizations ===

The following generalizes Cayley&#x27;s formula to labelled forests:
Let &quot;T&quot;&quot;n&quot;,&quot;k&quot; be the number of labelled forests on &quot;n&quot; vertices with &quot;k&quot; connected components,
such that vertices 1, 2, ..., &quot;k&quot; all belong to different connected components.
Then .

<text>Prof Giorgio Abetti HFRSE (5 October 1882 – 24 August 1982) was an Italian solar astronomer.

==Life==

He was born in Padua, the son of noted astronomer Antonio Abetti. He was educated at the Universities of Padua and of Rome. He began his career at the Collegio Romano observatory in Rome as an assistant astronomer.

In the First World War he served in the Corps of Engineers with the Italian Army.

In 1921 he succeeded his father as the director of the Osservatorio Astrofisico di Arcetri, and continued until 1957. From 1925 he was also a professor at the University of Florence, and continued in this capacity until 1957.

Giorgio Abetti is noted for having led expeditions to observe solar eclipses to Siberia (1936) and Sudan (1952). He was also a visiting professor at the University of Cairo in 1948–49. He was the vice president of the International Astronomical Union in 1938, and received the &quot;Medaglia d&#x27;argento&quot; from the Italian Geographic Society (1915), the &quot;Premio reale&quot; from the Accademia dei Lincei (1925), and the &quot;Janssen medal&quot; (1937).

In 1937, Abetti received the Prix Jules Janssen, the highest award of the Société astronomique de France, the French astronomical society.

The crater Abetti on the Moon and asteroid 2646 Abetti are named to honor both him and his father.

He died in Florence on 24 August 1982.

==Bibliography==
He is the author of several popular works on astronomy.
*&quot;Handbook of Astrophysics&quot;
*&quot;Nebulae and Galaxies&quot;
*&quot;Solar Research&quot;
*&quot;Stars and Planets&quot;
*&quot;The Exploration of the Universe&quot;

<text>Mark Wilkinson (born 3 October 1952) is an English illustrator. He is best known for the detailed surrealistic cover art he created for a number of British bands.

Wilkinson&#x27;s breakthrough came through his association with the neo-prog band Marillion in the 1980s. He went on to design art for the subsequent solo career of their lead singer, Fish, as well as bands such as Judas Priest and Iron Maiden. Though versed in a number of techniques, he is considered to be a master of the airbrush.

In 2012, his sleeve for the 1984 Marillion album &quot;Fugazi&quot; was chosen by Gigwise as the 29th greatest album artwork of all time. In 2015, Wilkinson designed the artwork for the Tya Brewery in Øvre Årdal, Norway.

==Biography==
Wilkinson was inspired by 1960s artists such as Hapshash and the Coloured Coat (a collaboration between Michael English and Nigel Waymouth) and Rick Griffin.

Wilkinson&#x27;s break came with his designs for Marillion in the 1980s, who were then second only to Iron Maiden in terms of their sales of T-shirts and merchandise. Wilkinson&#x27;s first artistic creation for Marillion was the cover of their debut 12&quot; EP &quot;Market Square Heroes&quot; (1982). Subsequently, Wilkinson&#x27;s art work would be used on all of Marillion&#x27;s albums and 12&quot; releases through &quot;The Thieving Magpie&quot; (1988). When Fish left the band Wilkinson went with him, providing the artwork for many of his albums and singles; aside from compilations, &quot;Songs from the Mirror&quot; is the only studio album by Fish not to feature cover art by Wilkinson. In 1997, he collaborated with Bill Smith Studios (which had replaced him as Marillion&#x27;s official art group) on the &quot;Best of Both Worlds&quot; compilation CD. The compilation included songs from the eras of the band with and without Fish, and the record label, EMI, decided it should also include artwork reflective of both eras. In 2000, Fish and Wilkinson collaborated on a book, &quot;Masque&quot;, which, in &quot;back and forth&quot; format, described the process by which the Fish and Marillion album covers were created. Wilkinson will likely always be most closely identified with Fish and Marillion (in a similar fashion to Roger Dean&#x27;s association with Yes or Paul Whitehead&#x27;s association with Genesis).

Wilkinson&#x27;s work for Marillion gained attention and led to him designing Monsters of Rock posters. This in turn brought him to the attention of heavy metal band Judas Priest. He has named &quot;The Four Horsemen&quot; from Judas Priest&#x27;s 2008 album &quot;Nostradamus&quot; as the work he is most pleased with. He has designed miscellaneous pieces for Bon Jovi, Jimmy Page, the Who and Kylie Minogue. Outside of the music community, he has also done numerous book covers, advertisements, comic art (including a 1993 Judge Anderson episode in the Judge Dredd Megazine) and commissioned pieces.

<text>Intelligent Peripheral Interface (IPI) was a server-centric storage interface used in the 1980s and early 1990s with an ISO-9318 standard. designed for mainframe computers from IBM, Control Data Corporation, and Unisys. It replaced Storage Module Device (SMD) as the hard disk drive interface for very large hard disks.

The idea behind IPI is that the disk drives themselves are as simple as possible, containing only the lowest level control circuitry, while the IPI interface card encapsulates most of the disk control complexity. The IPI interface card, as a central point of control, is thus theoretically able to best coordinate accesses to the connected disks, as it &quot;knows&quot; more about the states of the connected disks than would, say, a SCSI interface.

IPI supports cable lengths up to . An IPI-2 bus can provide a data transfer rate in the vicinity of 6 MB/s.

In practice, the theoretical advantages of IPI over SCSI were often not realized, as they only materialized when several disks were connected to the interface, which could then easily become a bandwidth bottleneck.

IPI systems were often shipped by Sun Microsystems on original sun4 architecture servers, but the above limitation and reliability problems made them unpopular with customers, and the technology basically disappeared by the second half of the 1990s.

<text>Ioannis Vlachos (), better known as Daskalogiannis (; 1722/30 – 17 June 1771), was a wealthy shipbuilder and shipowner who led a Cretan revolt against Ottoman rule in the 18th century.

==Life and activity==

Ioannis Vlachos was born in Anopolis village in Sfakia, a then semi-autonomous region of Crete, in 1722 or 1730. His father, who was also a wealthy shipowner, sent him to be educated abroad. Due to his education, his compatriots called him &quot;Daskalos&quot; (teacher), hence his nickname &quot;Daskalogiannis&quot;, literally &quot;John the Teacher.&quot; He is referred to as a town clerk in 1750, as chairman of the region of Sfakia in 1765, and as the owner of four, three-mast merchant ships. These would have sailed from Omprosgialos and the gulf of Loutro.

Daskalogiannis knew Panagiotis Benakis at Mani and it is likely that Benakis introduced him to Count Orlov who Catherine the Great had sent to the Peloponnese in 1769 to instigate a revolt there. Many men from Sfakia also participated in the revolt which Orlov instigated in the Peloponnese.

==Leader of revolt==
In early 1770, he was contacted by Russian emissaries, who hoped to instigate a revolt amongst the Greek subjects of the Ottoman Empire. Daskalogiannis agreed to fund and organize a rebellion in Sfakia against the Turkish authorities when the Russian emissaries promised to support him. In the spring of 1770, Daskalogiannis made preparations for the revolt; he brought together men, rifles, and supplies and had defenses built at strategic locations. However, the Russian fleet in the Aegean, under Count Orlov, did not sail for Crete, and the revolt was left to rely on its own resources. The uprising began on 25 March 1770, the rebels attacked the areas of Kydonia, Apokoronas and Agios Vasilios, north east of Lefka Ori. The rebels at first, put the Turks to flight and parts of Crete had the attributes of an independent nation, including its own coins minted in a cave near Hora Sfakion. However, in a matter of only a short time the Turks had gathered together their troops again, and as early as May they had an army of 40,000 men ready at the village of Vrysses.
When the Turks attacked Daskalogiannis and his men on the Krapi plateau, the rebels suffered a crushing defeat and had to take refuge in the high mountains. The Turks held the rebels in check, while they destroyed many of the villages in the area, scattered the inhabitants&#x27; flocks of sheep, looted the province, captured many inhabitants and sold them in the slave market in Chándakas (Iraklion). Daskalogiannis&#x27; uncle, the rural dean, was also taken prisoner. 

The Russian intervention, promised to Daskalogiannis, failed to materialize and the uprising did not spread to the lowlands. On 18 March 1771 the Turks gave the rebels an ultimatum. If they surrendered they would be granted safe passage, but the ultimatum was simultaneously accompanied by a document with peace terms. The document contained 12 items:
 1. They were to pay the taxes they had refused to pay the year before.
 2. They were to surrender their arms and provisions.
 3. They were to surrender their leaders, who would be taken to Iraklion for legal proceedings.
 4. They were no longer to have neither contact with nor provision the Christian ships approaching their harbours.
 5. They were to assist in arresting the crews on the Christian ships and take them to Iraklion.
 6. The judiciary in Sfakia was to be managed by a justice of the peace appointed by the Turkish government in Iraklion.
 7. The churches were not to be either repaired or restored. As were no new churches to be built.
 8. They were to pay tithe according to the sultans&#x27; firman (statutory instrument).
 9. No tall houses (castle towers) were to be built, and no Christian symbols were allowed on the existing buildings.
 10. It was prohibited to hold religious celebrations, as was ringing forbidden.
 11. The captured Muslims were to be released.
 12. The Sfakiots were to wear the specific clothes for subjugated Greeks.

When Daskalogiannis realized that the battle was lost, he surrendered to the Turks in the hope that it would ease the situation for his compatriots. It is also said that his brother, Nikolós Sgouromállis, who had already been taken prisoner, was forced to write him a letter in which he pointed out the Turks&#x27; good will.
Daskalogiannis was taken to Iraklion together with his most trusted men, but rather than keeping the promise of the ultimatum the pasha of the town had in place a cruel punishment. On 17 June 1771 Daskalogiannis was, in the full daylight of publicity, tortured, skinned alive and then beaten to death, an ordeal that he endured in complete silence. His brother was forced to watch the torture which drove him insane.

==Family==
Daskalogiannis was married to Sgouromallini, their daughters Anthousa and Maria Daskalogianni fought alongside their father during the course of the revolt. Sgouromallini and Anthousa were killed in its aftermath. Maria was enslaved and given to the Ottoman vizier, who in turn gifted to the teftedar of Heraklion. The latter married Maria, without forcing her to convert to Islam (according to the custom of the time) and the two moved to Constantinople. After her husband&#x27;s death in 1816, Maria inherited a considerable amount of money donating to the Greek revolutionaries following the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence.

==Legacy==
Daskalogiannis was immortalized in several folk tales and songs, the most prominent of which is the celebrated epic ballad by Barba-Pantzelios, a poor cheese-maker from Mouri – &quot;To tragoudi tou Daskalogianni&quot; of 1786:

:…Φτάνουν στο Φραγκοκάστελο και στον πασά ποσώνου,
:κι εκείνος δούδει τ&#x27; όρντινο κι ευτύς τσοι ξαρματώνου.
:Ούλους τσοι ξαρματώσασι και τσοι μπισταγκωνίζου
:και τότες δα το νιώσασι πως δεν ξαναγυρίζου.

:...They arrive at Frangokastello and surrender to the pasha,
:and he gives the order to disarm them at once.
:All of them were disarmed and ill at ease,
:for now they sensed that they would never go home.

Tradition states that before Daskalogiannis and his few men made their last stand against the Ottomans, they danced the war dance Pentozalis.

The international airport of Chania (CHQ/LGSA) bears Daskalogiannis&#x27; name. A memorial statue can be seen in his hometown Anopolis. One of the regular ferries in the Crete southeast routes is named the &quot;Daskalogiannis&quot;.

<text>Bodenseesender () was a radio transmission facility of VoA, US SWR (until 1998 SWF) near Meßkirch-Rohrdorf in Southern Germany for medium wave established in 1964. It shut down on January 8, 2012, and one month later, on February 7, 2012, the last mast was demolished.

==Background==
Bodenseesender had been used since July 1, 2002 for the propagation of SWR Cont.Ra on the medium wave frequency 666 kHz, u v.a.. Until 1978 the aerial of the medium wave transmitter consisted of 4 guyed steel framework masts, which are insulated against ground. In the mid 1970s two of these masts were dismantled. One of them was rebuilt on a new site not far away from it earlier site in order to form with one of the two masts, which were not dismantled a directional aerial, while the other was rebuilt at Nierstein in Rhineland-Palatina. On the site of the latter mast a guyed steel framework mast was erected, which is also insulated against ground. At the construction of this mast, the length of the upper guys were chosen in such way, that there is no disturbation of its radiation pattern when grounded directly at the anchor blocks. So the upper guys do not have any intermediate insulators. They are only insulated toward the mast. However the guys of the lowest level are divided by one intermediate insulator electrically in two parts.


In spring 2005 the two guyed masts which were situated at 48°1′19″N, 9°7′12″E and at 48°1′24″N, 9°7′18″E were demolished.

<text>David Cyril Geary (born June 7, 1957, in Providence, Rhode Island) is an American cognitive developmental and evolutionary psychologist with interests in mathematical learning and sex differences. He is currently a Curators&#x27; Professor and Thomas Jefferson Fellow in the Department of Psychological Sciences and Interdisciplinary Neuroscience Program at the University of Missouri in Columbia.

==Education==
Geary received a BS degree in psychology from Santa Clara University (California) in 1979, and an MS from the clinical child/school psychology program at California State University at Hayward (now East Bay) in 1981. After completing the MS degree, he worked for the emergency treatment center of the Mental Research Institute in Palo Alto, California, and began the Ph.D. program at the University of California, Riverside, in 1982. His initial interests were in hemispheric laterality and associated sex differences, but focused his dissertation work on mathematical cognition under the direction of Keith Widaman (now at UC, Davis). 

==Career==
After completing his Ph.D. in developmental psychology in 1986, Geary took a one-year position at the University of Texas at El Paso and then moved to the University of Missouri, first at the Rolla campus (1987–1989) and then in Columbia. During this time, he served as chair of the Department of Psychological Sciences (2002–2005) and contributed heavily to the creation of the Ph.D. program in developmental psychology.

==Research==
Geary&#x27;s wide-ranging interests are reflected in invited addresses in a variety of departments (anthropology, biology, behavior genetics, computer science, education, government, mathematics, neuroscience, physics, and psychology) and Universities throughout the United States, as well as in Canada, Europe, and East Asia.

Geary&#x27;s research on mathematics learning, evolutionary psychology, and sex differences has been featured in many popular press outlets, including &quot;Discover&quot;, &quot;Education Week&quot;, &quot;Forbes&quot;, CBS News, and MSNBC among many others.

Geary&#x27;s research on children&#x27;s mathematical development resulted in a MERIT award from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). In 2005, the University of Missouri awarded Geary a Curators’ Professorship, and the Thomas Jefferson Professorship in 2009. Among other distinctions, he is 2009 co-recipient of the George A. Miller Award for an Outstanding Recent Article on General Psychology for the 2007 Psychological Science in the Public Interest monograph on sex differences in mathematics and science, co-authored with Halpern, Benbow, Gur, Hyde, and Gernsbacher. He is a fellow of the Association for Psychological Science (2005) and the American Association for the Advancement of Science (2011).

Geary&#x27;s research interests are centered on his four books, &quot;Children&#x27;s mathematical development (1994), Male, female (1998, 2010, second edition), Origin of mind (2005),&quot; and &quot;Evolution of vulnerability (2015)&quot;; the latter was discussed in an interview with the Guardian. He is also co-author of the 2008 &quot;Sex differences: Summarizing more than a century of scientific research,&quot; and co-editor with Drs. Berch and Mann Koepke of a five-volume series on mathematical cognition and learning.

His research on mathematical development ranged from mathematical modeling of adults’ processing of arithmetic problems;
the effects of aging on these processes;
and cross national and cross generational differences in mathematical abilities.
In this area, he is best known for his research on learning difficulties in mathematics and in 1993 published a theoretical and review article that outlined subtypes of disabilities and helped to organize subsequent research in this area. He currently directs the Missouri Longitudinal Study of Mathematical Learning and Disability.

Geary&#x27;s research in evolutionary psychology also ranges across a variety of issues, from evolution of the hominid brain to men&#x27;s hormonal responses while competing against members of their in-group or against an out-group. He has also written extensively on human paternal investment (fatherhood) and the evolution of the human family, and is one of the pioneers in evolutionary developmental psychology and evolutionary educational psychology.

His collaborators include former students, Drew H. Bailey and Benjamin Winegard with research focused in social signaling, among other topics.

==Public service==

Geary contributed to the 1998 Mathematics Framework for California Public Schools and in 2006 was appointed to the President&#x27;s National Mathematics Advisory Panel. While serving on the panel, he chaired the learning processes task group. In 2007, he was appointed by President George W. Bush to the National Board of Directors, Institute of Education Sciences (IES), and served through 2010. He is also co-author of Developing effective fractions instruction for kindergarten through 8th grade: A practice guide and an on-line overview of learning disabilities in mathematics for parents and teachers.

==Personal life==
Geary is married to Yin Xia, an applied economist. He also has a son named Mick Licken.

== Selected works ==
Geary has authored or co-authored and published over 200 articles in academic journals. His h-index according to Google Scholar is 54.

<text>Meikle Loch is an inland loch some miles north of Collieston, Aberdeenshire, Scotland. It is designated as part of the Ythan Estuary complex, along with the Sands of Forvie, as a Special Protection Area for wildlife conservation purposes. Meikle is a Scots word for large/big, which the loch is when compared to the adjacent Little Loch.

It is a eutrophic loch with limited aquatic vegetation but is important as the home to overwintering pink-footed geese. Additionally, it is an essential breeding location for three species of tern during the summer months and houses a tremendous variety of reedswamp plants.

<text>The Amana Colonies are seven villages on located in Iowa County in east-central Iowa, United States: Amana (or Main Amana, German: &quot;Haupt-Amana&quot;), East Amana, High Amana, Middle Amana, South Amana, West Amana, and Homestead. The villages were built and settled by German Radical Pietists, who were persecuted in their homeland by the German state government and the Lutheran Church. Calling themselves the True Inspiration Congregations (), they first settled in New York near Buffalo in what is now the town of West Seneca. However, seeking more isolated surroundings, they moved to Iowa (near present-day Iowa City) in 1856. They lived a communal life until 1932.

For eighty years, the Amana Colony maintained an almost completely self-sufficient local economy, importing very little from the industrializing American economy. The Amanians were able to achieve this independence and lifestyle by adhering to the specialized crafting and farming occupations that they had brought with them from Europe. Craftsmen passed their skills and techniques on from one generation to the next. They used hand, horse, wind, and water power, and made their own furniture, clothes, and other goods. The community voted to form a for-profit organization during the Great Depression, the Amana Society (&quot;Amana-Gesellschaft&quot;), which included the Amana Corporation.

Today, the Seven Villages of Amana are a tourist attraction known for their restaurants and craft shops. The colony was listed as a National Historic Landmark in 1965.

As of the 2010 Census, the population of the seven villages in order of population was as follows:

* Middle Amana (581)
* Amana (Main Amana) (442)
* South Amana (159)
* Homestead (148)
* West Amana (135)
* High Amana (115)
* East Amana (56)

The Community of True Inspiration (Amana Church) continues to worship in the Middle Amana meeting house, though &quot;Special services, Sunday school, and fellowship activities are held in the larger Main Amana meeting house.&quot;

==Early history==

===Origins in Europe===
The Amana Colony stems from a religious movement started in 1714 in Germany by Eberhard L. Gruber and Johann F. Rock. They had both grown displeased with the dogmatism of the Lutheran Church and began to study the Pietist teachings of Philipp Spener. Gruber and Rock fervently spread their beliefs and gained a following originally known as the New Spiritual Economy. They believed that God communicated through individuals with the &quot;gift of inspiration&quot;, just as he did in the days of the prophets. This individual was called an instrument () because he was thought to be used as a tool of God&#x27;s will to speak directly to his people.

To spread their beliefs, the group led by Rock and Gruber traveled through Germany, Switzerland, and the Dutch Republic. The group became known as the Community of True Inspiration, and followers were called Inspirationalists. The Inspirationalists faced the opposition of the governments of the German states because they refused to serve as soldiers and would not send their children to Lutheran public schools. Adherents to the faith were imprisoned, flogged, and stripped of their possessions. To escape persecution, many Inspirationalists moved to Hesse, the most liberal German state at the time. Here, the number of Inspirationalists greatly multiplied.

Gruber died in 1728 and Rock followed in 1749; left without an instrument, the Inspirationalists&#x27; numbers declined in the subsequent decades. Within a span of a few months starting in 1817, Michael Krausert, Barbara Heinemann, and Christian Metz were all named instruments. Although Krausert soon left the church, Metz and Heinemann were able to revive interest in the Community.

Heinemann retreated from the Community&#x27;s affairs in 1823, making Metz the sole leader of the church. The Community continued to face persecution from German states for their refusal to serve as soldiers or utilize public schools. In the 1830s, Metz conceived of the notion of leasing a large area of land as a refuge for the Community. They first leased land from a cloister near Ronneburg, then from the Arnsburg Abbey. They expanded to Engelthal Abbey in 1834, and managed all of their land holdings in common. It was at these estates that the philosophy of communal life began to grow within the Community. By the late 1830s, the Community was prospering.

===Move to America===
The Hesse government levied harsher fines and rents against the Community in the wake of economic turmoil in the late 1830s. Metz and other leaders realized that they had to find a new home for the Community. On August 27, 1842, leaders of the Community gathered at Armenburg, Germany, to discuss a movement to the United States. The Community arrived in New York on October 26. For the next three months, church leaders examined tracts of land to establish a new commune. They agreed to purchase the Seneca Indian Reservation near Buffalo, which had recently become open to European settlement following the Second Treaty of Buffalo Creek. The first settlement was called Ebenezer after the Eben-Ezer in the Books of Samuel.

Over 800 members of the Community immigrated to Ebenezer from Germany. The Community founded a &quot;provisional constitution&quot; in 1843 that defined the intentions of the community, which they called the Ebenezer Society. All lands and buildings were to be held in common, and prosperous settlers were expected to pay community expenses. The initial plan was that, after some time, the land would be divided among the people according to their contribution of money and labor. However, leaders saw that the disparity in wealth, skills and age would make it difficult for all to purchase a portion of land—the community would fall apart as a result. Therefore, the constitution was amended on October 23, 1850, to make the Community exclusively communal.

The purchase was adequate for the first 800 villagers. However, the success of the community brought new settlers, and by 1854, it was apparent that a larger tract of land was needed. Furthermore, the growth of the nearby city of Buffalo concerned church elders, who thought that it could become a bad influence. Buffalo&#x27;s growth also greatly increased nearby real estate prices, making an extension to Ebenezer financially unfeasible. Metz met with Community leaders on August 31, 1854, to discuss the situation, and the group agreed to send four men (including Metz) to search for a new home out west. The new Kansas Territory seemed like an ideal location, so the group of four traveled across the new lands. However, they could not agree on an appropriate location.

Two elders were then sent to the state of Iowa to examine the large government land grants. Finding appropriate lands near the Iowa River, they returned to Ebenezer to encourage purchase. The Inspirationalists sent four men to purchase the land and all holdings in the vicinity. The first village in what would become the Amana Colonies was laid out in 1855 ().

===Founding===
The new colony was originally to be named , German for &quot;remain faithful&quot;. However, residents found difficulty properly pronouncing the word in English. Instead, the Inspirationalists settled on &quot;Amana&quot;, a Biblical name with similar meaning. Under Iowa law, the Community had to incorporate as a business, so the Amana Society was founded as the governing body in 1859. Shortly thereafter, the Community agreed to adopt a new constitution. The resulting twelve-article document was very similar to the amended Ebenezer Constitution.

One early problem for each settler was the lack of rail access; the nearest station was in Iowa City away. However, in 1861 the Mississippi and Missouri Railroad built a railroad station in nearby Homestead. Recognizing the need for the rail connection, the Community purchased the entire village of Homestead (&quot;Heimstätte&quot;) (). This brought their land holdings to : in timberland, in cultivated fields, in grazing land, in settlements, and in vegetable gardens. Most of the land is in Iowa County, with approximately in Johnson County.

By 1862, five more villages were laid, bringing the total number to seven:
*Amana vor der Höhe (High Amana) ()
*Süd-Amana (South Amana) ()
*West-Amana (West Amana) ()
*Ost-Amana (East Amana) ()
*Mittel-Amana (Middle Amana) ()

Each village had between forty and one hundred houses, a church, school, bakery, dairy, wine-cellar, post office, sawmill, and general store. Every able-bodied man was expected to serve in the fire department, and each village had its own fire department. Most houses were two stories and built with local sandstone, which has an unusual hue. They are mostly square with gable roofs.

The last of the 1,200 Inspirationalist settlers from New York arrived in 1864. By 1908, the Community had grown to 1,800 and owned over $1.8 million in assets.

== Life until 1932 ==

===Government===
The Great Council of the Brethren, also known as the Board of Trustees, oversaw the affairs and conduct of the Amana Society. Trustees were expected to tend to the internal affairs of the Society as well as its external business interests. Trustees were elected annually by popular vote from the elders of the Community. The trustees would then elect out of their own a president, vice president, and secretary; incumbents were usually re-elected. The group met alternately in different villages on the first Tuesday of each month. Each June, the trustees were expected to keep the Society informed of the general condition of its affairs. The Great Council also served as the high court of the Community.

Each village was governed by a group of seven to nineteen elders. Decisions would be made for each village by a group of these elders led by one of the trustees. This governing board was known as the &quot;Bruderrath&quot;. Elders were selected based on their piety and spirituality. &quot;Werkzeug&quot; had the authority to appoint elders, but at times when there were no such individuals, they were selected by the Great Council. The &quot;Bruderrath&quot; had the authority to appoint foremen for each industry. Individuals could petition the &quot;Bruderrath&quot; if they sought more money, a larger house, or a lighter workload. The Head Elder had the highest level of authority in each village, even over the &quot;Bruderrath&quot; trustee.

Each community member was provided with an annual sum, with men receiving $40 to $100 a year depending on their career, women receiving $25 to $30 a year, and parents of children receiving an additional $5 to $10 per child. This money was expected to be spent at village stores. Members who failed to budget adequately would be admonished by the Community. If the member did not mend his ways, they could be expelled by the community. Members who were expelled or voluntarily left the Community would receive all of the money they had invested into the common fund plus interest.

===Marriage and children===
Originally, marriage was permitted only &quot;with the consent of God&quot; through the &quot;Werkzeug&quot;. Marriage was considered a spiritual weakness. Ceremonies were not joyous affairs, but were instead designed to impress the importance of the task upon the couple. Childbearing was similarly discouraged. Views on marriage gradually liberalized, and the Great Council was later given the authority to approve marriage. Men were not allowed to marry until they were 24 years old. If the Great Council found no fault with the union, then the couple could be wed after a year&#x27;s wait. An elder would bless the marriage and the community would provide a wedding feast. The community did not recognize divorce, and second marriages (even in the case of a widow) were considered particularly reprehensible. A citizen would be expelled from the community for one year for marrying an individual outside of the colonies, even if the partner wished to join the society.

===Dining===
There was no cooking in the homes of Amana citizens; instead, citizens originally ate together in groups of thirty to forty-five. Communal kitchens, each with its own garden, hosted meals. Men would sit at one table while women and small children would sit at another. Prayers were said in German before and after meals. Meals were not considered social affairs so conversation was discouraged.

There were as many as fifty-five communal kitchens: sixteen in Amana, ten in Middle Amana, nine in Homestead, six in South and West Amana, and four in East and High Amana. The kitchen boss () was tasked with kitchen operations: cooking, serving, preserving, and chicken husbandry. Kitchen personnel were appointed by the &quot;Bruderrat&quot;. Communal kitchens were usually large, two-story structures with an attached residence for the &quot;Küchebaas&quot;. Kitchens typically had a large brick hearth stove, a wood- or coal-burning oven, and a sink. Though kitchens originally had to bring water from the nearest well, they were the first buildings to be connected to the colony waterworks. Kitchens were named after the Küchebaas. The communal kitchen concept eroded some time around 1900, as married residents began to eat in their own homes. Food was still cooked in the communal kitchens, but housewives would take the food home. Kitchen staff and single residents still ate in the communal kitchens.

Each kitchen operated individually and had different practices. However, menus were largely standardized across the colonies to prevent any residents from receiving more than their fair share. Saturday night would offer pork sausages or pork rinds, boiled potatoes, cottage cheese with chives, bread with cream cheese, and streusel. The noon meal on Sunday was rice soup, fried potatoes, creamed spinach, boiled beef, streusel, and tea or coffee. Menus changed with the seasons; for example, more beef and pork was served in the autumn and winter because it was easier to keep fresh meat.

===Work===
Common positions held by women were in the kitchens, communal gardens, and laundry, among eight occupations. Men on the other hand had 39 different jobs to choose from, including barber, butcher, tailor, machine shop worker, and doctor. Children also participated in jobs, such as harvesting and agricultural duties for boys and kitchen work for the girls. Children stayed with their mothers until they were two years old. Then, the child would have to attend Kinderschule until the age of seven. At that point, the child would attend school six days a week, all year round until the age of fourteen or fifteen. At school, they shelled, cleaned and graded seed corn, picked fruit, and studied reading, writing and arithmetic.

Amana was known for its hospitality towards outsiders. Members would never turn a person in need away. They would feed and shelter the homeless who would pass through on the train. Some would even be hired as laborers. They would receive good wages, a permit home for the length of their stay and three meals a day in the communal kitchen. The homeless were not the only outside help. Amana would hire many outside laborers to do industrial and agricultural jobs. They worked in the woolen shop, the calico-printing shop or one of the many others.

===Worship===
Another important governing aspect of the society was the church, which was run by the Board of Trustees. Children and their parents worshiped together. Mothers with young children sat in the back of the church. Other children sat in the first few rows. Men and women were separated during worship: men on one side and women on the other side of the church (this practice continues to this day). Older people and the &quot;in-betweens&quot; who were people in their thirties and forties had to attend a separate service. The service that members attended and where the members sat was a statement of their status in society. Services were held eleven times a week and did not include musical instruments and hymn singing.

===Amana and the outside world ===
Amana would interact with the outside world in two ways, buying and selling. Each village had a center of exchange where all goods were purchased. By the 1890s, these stores were buying a great amount of goods and raw materials from the outside world. Just Middle Amana alone had more than 732 invoices from outside companies. Amana purchased anything deemed necessary to run the society efficiently, such as raw wool, oil, grease, starch, pipes and fittings. Most of the grain was purchased from the outside for their flour-mill, and the printing establishment used cotton goods from the southern states. This brings into question whether Amana was truly an economically isolated society.

===Great Change===
In March 1931, in the wake of the Great Depression, the Great Council disclosed to the Amana Society that the villages were in dire financial condition. The Depression was particularly harsh in the Colony because fire had badly damaged the woolen mill and destroyed the flour mill less than ten years earlier. At the same time, Society members were seeking more personal freedom. The Society agreed to split into two organizations: The non-profit Amana Church Society oversaw the spiritual needs of the community, while the for-profit Amana Society was incorporated as a joint-stock company. The transition was completed in 1932 and came to be known in the community as the Great Change.

==Since the Great Change==

Most residents of the Amana Colony are considered tri-lingual. They speak American English, High German (), and a dialect known as Amana German (). The language is High German in origin, but has strong influences of American English. For example, the word for rhubarb is &quot;Piestengel&quot;, combining the English word &quot;pie&quot; with the German word for stalk or stem.

The Amana Society, Inc., corporate heir to the land and economic assets of communal Amana, continues to own and manage some of farm, pasture and forest land. Agriculture remains an important economic base today just as it was in communal times. Because the land was not divided up with the end of communalism, the landscape of Amana still reflects its communal heritage. In addition, over 450 communal-era buildings stand in the seven villages—vivid reminders of the past. On June 23, 1965, the National Park Service deemed the Amana Colonies worthy of distinction as a National Historic Landmark. When the National Register of Historic Places was founded a year later, the Colonies were automatically listed.

Amana Farms is home to Iowa’s largest privately held forest. Amana Farms has built a anaerobic digester with funding from the Iowa Office of Energy Independence, which produces fertilizer, heat for buildings, and methane for generating electricity. The digester processes organic waste streams from industrial partners such as Genencor International, Cargill and the International Paper Cedar River Mill, as well as manure, thereby reducing local methane emissions.

===Amana Refrigeration===
The most widely known business enterprise that emerged from the Amana Society is Amana Refrigeration, Inc. George C. Foerstner worked in the woolen mill and became a traveling salesman for the mill after the Great Change. With the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, Foerstner recognized the need for beverage coolers. He started the Electric Equipment Company in 1934 using $3,500 of his own savings. The company was sold to the Amana Society in 1936 and renamed the Electrical Department of the Amana Society, though Foerstner remained as manager. The company was twice awarded the Army-Navy &quot;E&quot; Award during World War II for filling military contracts. Goods were produced in the Middle Amana woolen mill.

In 1947, the company produced the first commercial upright freezer. Two years later, the Amana Society sold off the Electrical Department to an investment group organized by Foerstner. Renamed Amana Refrigeration, Inc., the company grew to manufacture refrigerators and air conditioners. The Raytheon Corporation purchased Amana Refrigeration on January 1, 1965, although the Amana division was mostly autonomous. Amana produced the first practical commercial microwave oven in 1967. The division was sold to Goodman Global in 1997 and then sold to Maytag in 2001. It became part of the Whirlpool Corporation when it purchased Maytag in 2006. Whirlpool sold the Amana, Iowa refrigerator plant property to Wramia001, a Chicago-based limited liability company, in October, 2020 for $92.6 million dollars. Amana will continue to manufacture Amana, JennAir, KitchenAid, Maytag and Whirlpool refrigerators at the plant, built in 1940, under a long-term lease agreement.

===Tourism===
Today, heritage tourism has become important to the economy of the Amana area. There are hotels and bed and breakfasts that support the tourist industry, as well as many independent shops, local artists and craftspeople, and restaurants serving family-style meals. Historic preservation efforts by several local non-profit organizations, as well as the Amana Society, Inc., in conjunction with governmental, land-use and historic preservation ordinances attempt to preserve the natural and built environment of Amana.

===Education===
Clear Creek–Amana Community School District operates public schools serving the community. Amana Elementary School is in Middle Amana, and Clear Creek–Amana Middle School and Clear Creek–Amana High School are in Tiffin.

Amana High School in Middle Amana was established after a 1935 bond election. The school closed in 1991. Clear Creek–Amana Middle School was previously in Middle Amana.
