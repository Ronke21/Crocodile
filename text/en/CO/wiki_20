<doc id="1272999" wikidata="Q5969185" url="?curid=1272999" title="Support programs for OS/360 and successors">
<text>This article discusses support programs included in or available for OS/360 and successors. IBM categorizes some of these programs as utilities and others as service aids; the boundaries are not always consistent or obvious. Many, but not all, of these programs match the types in utility software.

The following lists describe programs associated with OS/360 and successors. No DOS, TPF or VM utilities are included.

==History/Common JCL==
Many of these programs were designed by IBM users, through the group SHARE, and then modified or extended by IBM from versions originally written by a user.

These programs are usually invoked via Job Control Language (JCL). They tend to use common JCL DD identifiers (in the OS, now z/OS operating systems) for their data sets:
==Dataset utilities==
===IDCAMS===
IDCAMS (&quot;Access Method Services&quot;) generates and modifies Virtual Storage Access Method (VSAM) and Non-VSAM datasets. IDCAMS was introduced along with VSAM in OS/VS; the &quot;Access Method&quot; reference derives from the initial &quot;VSAM replaces all other access methods&quot; mindset of OS/VS. IDCAMS probably has the most functionality of all the utility programs, performing many functions, for both VSAM and non-VSAM files.
The following example illustrates the use of IDCAMS to copy a dataset to disk. The dataset has 80-byte records, and the system will choose the block size for the output:
//XXXXXXXW JOB XXXXXXX,AAAA,CLASS=G,MSGCLASS=1,NOTIFY=&amp;SYSUID
//STEP001 EXEC PGM=IDCAMS
//SYSIN DD *
 REPRO INFILE(FILE01) OUTFILE(FILE02) 
//FILE01 DD DSN=PROD.FILE1.INPUT,disp=shr ...
//FILE02 DD DSN=PROD.FILE2.OUTPUT,
// DISP=(NEW,CATLG,DELETE),
// UNIT=DASD,
// SPACE=(TRK,(100,10),RLSE), 
// DCB=(RECFM=FB,BLKSIZE=0,LRECL=80)
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=* 
//SYSOUT DD SYSOUT=* 
//SYSUDUMP DD SYSOUT=*


In the example above, SYSIN control cards are coming from an in-stream file, but you can instead point to any sequential file or a PDS member containing control cards or a temporary data-set, if you wish.
Example of using SYSIN files would be something like this:
//SYSIN DD DSN=PROD.MYFILE.REPRO,DISP=SHR

or this:

//SYSIN DD DSN=PROD.MYLIB.CNTLLIB(REPRO),
// DISP=SHR
===IEBCOMPR===
IEBCOMPR compares records in sequential or partitioned data sets.

The IEBCOMPR utility is used to compare two sequential or partitioned datasets. This data set comparison is performed at the logical record level. Therefore, IEBCOMPR is commonly used to verify that a backup copy of a data set is correct (exact match to the original).

During processing, IEBCOMPR compares each record from each data set, one by one. If the records are unequal, IEBCOMPR lists the following information in the SYSOUT:
* The record and block numbers in question.
* The names of the DD statements in which the inconsistency occurred.
* The unequal records.

When comparing sequential data sets, IEBCOMPR considers the data sets equal if the following conditions are met:
:* The data sets contain the same number of records.
:* The corresponding records and keys are identical.

For partitioned data sets, IEBCOMPR considers the data sets equal if the following conditions are met:
:* The directory entries for the two partitioned data sets match - that is, the names are the same, and the number of entries are equal.
:* The corresponding members contain the same number of records.
:* The corresponding records and keys are identical.

If ten unequal comparisons are encountered during processing, IECOMPR terminates with the appropriate message.
//XXXXXXXW JOB XXXXXXX,AAAA.A.A,CLASS=G,MSGCLASS=1,NOTIFY=XXXXX
//STEP01 EXEC PGM=IEBCOMPR,ACCT=PJ00000000
// INCLUDE MEMBER=@BATCHS
//*SYSIN DD DUMMY
//SYSIN DD *
 COMPARE TYPORG=PO
//SYSUT1 DD DSN=XXXXXXX.OLDFILE,UNIT=DASD,DISP=SHR
//SYSUT2 DD DSN=XXXXXXX.NEWFILE,UNIT=DASD,DISP=SHR
//SYSUT# DD
Note: IEBCOMPR is not a very flexible or user-friendly compare program. It can&#x27;t restrict the comparison to only certain columns, it can&#x27;t ignore differences in white space, it doesn&#x27;t tell you where in the record the difference occurs, and it halts after 10 differences. On the other hand, it is fast, and it is present on all IBM mainframes. So it is very useful when an exact match is expected, such as comparing load modules that have not been reblocked, or checking that a copy worked properly. For comparisons of programs or reports, the ISPF SuperC (ISRSUPC) compare program is often used instead.

===IEBCOPY===
IEBCOPY copies, compresses and merges partitioned data sets. It can also select or exclude specified members during the copy operation, and rename or replace members.

Some of the tasks that IEBCOPY can perform include the following:
* Creating an unload of a partitioned data set (PDS) to a PS dataset, for backup or transmission.
* Copying a PDS in place to reclaim the unused space from deleted members; also called compressing a PDS.
* Copying selected members to another PDS.
* Renaming selected members of a PDS.
* Merging multiple partitioned data sets into a single PDS.
* Altering, copying and reblocking load modules.
* Members that are already present in another PDS will not get replaced unless the R option is specified.

For the IEBCOPY utility, the required job control statements for a copy are as follows:
//stepname EXEC PGM=IEBCOPY 
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=class
//MYDD1 DD DSN=xxxx.ppp.psps,DISP=SHR
//MYDD2 DD DSN=xxxx.ppp.pssp,DISP=SHR
//SYSIN DD *
 COPY INDD=MYDD1,OUTDD=MYDD2 
 SELECT MEMBER=(MEM1,MEM2,MEM3)/ EXCLUDE MEMBER=(SF,DF,SA) 
The MYDD1 and MYDD2 DD statements are names chosen by the user for the partitioned input and output data sets, respectively; The defaults are SYSUT1 and SYSUT2. You can use any valid DDNAME for these two DD statements. These DDNAMEs are specified in the utility control statements to tell IEBCOPY the name of the input and output data sets. You only need one DD statement for a PDS to be compressed.

===IEBDG===
IEBDG (&#x27;Data Generator&#x27;) creates test datasets consisting of patterned data. Control statements define the fields of the records to be created, including position, length, format, and initialization to be performed. IEBDG can use an existing dataset as input and change fields as specified in the control statements, for example replacing a name field by random alphabetic text. The contents of each field may be varied for each record, for example by rotating the characters in an alphanumeric field left or right for each subsequent record.

Example:

//XXXXXXXW JOB XXXXXXX,AAAA,CLASS=G,MSGCLASS=1,NOTIFY=&amp;SYSUID
//* CREATION OF A DATASET To BE USED LATER ON
//CRSTEP EXEC PGM=IEFBR14 
//DDCREA DD DSN=&amp;SYSUID..MVSUT.SEQOUT,DISP=(NEW,CATLG)
//* CREATION OF THE TESTDATA
//STEP1 EXEC PGM=IEBDG 
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=* 
//SEQOUT DD DSN=&amp;SYSUID..MVSUT.SEQOUT,DISP=OLD 
//SYSIN DD DATA 
 DSD OUTPUT=(SEQOUT) 
 FD NAME=FIELD1,LENGTH=30,STARTLOC=1,FORMAT=AL,ACTION=TL 
 FD NAME=FIELD2,LENGTH=30,STARTLOC=31,FORMAT=AL,ACTION=TR 
 FD NAME=FIELD3,LENGTH=10,STARTLOC=71,PICTURE=10, X
 P&#x27;1234567890&#x27;,INDEX=1 
 CREATE QUANTITY=500,NAME=(FIELD1,FIELD2,FIELD3),FILL=X&#x27;FF&#x27; 
 END 
//**********************************************************************
//* PRINTING THE TEST DATA TO SYSOUT
//STEP2 EXEC PGM=IEBGENER 
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=* 
//SYSUT1 DD DSN=*.STEP1.SEQOUT,DISP=SHR 
//SYSIN DD DUMMY 
//SYSUT2 DD SYSOUT=* 
//* DELETE THE CREATED DATASET, EVEN IF PREVIOUS STEPS ABENDED
//DLSTEP EXEC PGM=IEFBR14,COND=EVEN 
//DDDEL DD DSN=&amp;SYSUID..MVSUT.SEQOUT,DISP=(OLD,DELETE,DELETE)


===IEBEDIT===
IEBEDIT selectively copies portions of JCL.

An example of an IEBEDIT program:
//IEBEDITJ JOB ACCT,&quot;,CLASS=P,MSGCLASS=T,MSGLEVEL=(1,1),NOTIFY=&amp;SYSUID
//STEP0001 EXEC PGM=IEBEDIT
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*
//SYSUT1 DD DSN=xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz,DISP=SHR
//SYSUT2 DD SYSOUT=(*,INTRDR)
//SYSIN DD *
 EDIT TYPE=INCLUDE,STEPNAME=(STEP10,STEP5,STEP15)
//
In this example, data set xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz should contain job(s) (which should include steps named STEP5, STEP10, and STEP15). This IEBEDIT routine copies the selected steps of the job onto the SYSUT2 output file (in this example, the internal reader).

The syntax of the EDIT statement is:
[label] EDIT [START=jobname] 
[,TYPE={POSITION|INCLUDE|EXCLUDE}] 
[,STEPNAME=(namelist)] 
[,NOPRINT]
codice_1 specifies the name of the input job to which the EDIT statement applies. Each EDIT statement must apply to a separate job. If START is specified without TYPE and STEPNAME, the JOB statement and all job steps for the specified job are included in the output.

Default: If START is omitted and only one EDIT statement is provided, the first job encountered in the input data set is processed. If START is omitted from an EDIT statement other than the first statement, processing continues with the next JOB statement found in the input data set.

codice_2 specifies the contents of the output data set. These values can be coded:

codice_3 specifies that the output is to consist of a JOB statement, the job step specified in the STEPNAME parameter, and all steps that follow that job step. All job steps preceding the specified step are omitted from the operation. POSITION is the default.

codice_4 specifies that the output data set is to contain a JOB statement and all job steps specified in the STEPNAME parameter.

codice_5 specifies that the output data set is to contain a JOB statement and all job steps belonging to the job except those steps specified in the STEPNAME parameter.

codice_6 specifies the names of the job steps that you want to process.

codice_7 can be a single job step name, a list of step names separated by commas, or a sequential range of steps separated by a hyphen (for example, STEPA-STEPE). Any combination of these may be used in one namelist. If more than one step name is specified, the entire namelist must be enclosed in parentheses.

When coded with TYPE=POSITION, STEPNAME specifies the first job step to be placed in the output data set. Job steps preceding this step are not copied to the output data set.

When coded with TYPE=INCLUDE or TYPE=EXCLUDE, STEPNAME specifies the names of job steps that are to be included in or excluded from the operation. For example, STEPNAME=(STEPA,STEPF-STEPL,STEPZ) indicates that job steps STEPA, STEPF through STEPL, and STEPZ are to be included in or excluded from the operation.

If STEPNAME is omitted, the entire input job whose name is specified on the EDIT statement is copied. If no job name is specified, the first job encountered is processed.

codice_8 specifies that the message data set is not to include a listing of the output data set.

Default: The resultant output is listed in the message data set.

See here for more info: 

===IEBGENER===
IEBGENER copies records from a sequential dataset, or creates a partitioned dataset.

Some of the tasks that IEBGENER can perform include the following:
* Creating a backup of a sequential data set or a member of a PDS.
* Changing the physical block size or logical record length of a sequential data set.
* Creating an edited data set.
* Printing a sequential data set or a member of a PDS.
* Creating partitioned output data set from sequential input data set.

An example of an IEBGENER program to copy one dataset to another:
//IEBGENER JOB ACCT,&#x27;DATA COPY&#x27;,MSGCLASS=J,CLASS=A
//STEP010 EXEC PGM=IEBGENER 
//SYSUT1 DD DSN=xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz,DISP=SHR 
//SYSUT2 DD DSN=aaaaa.bbbbb.ccccc,DISP=(,CATLG),
// UNIT=SYSDA,SPACE=(TRK,(5,5),RLSE),
// DCB=(RECFM=FB,LRECL=1440)
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=* 
//SYSIN DD DUMMY 
For straight copy tasks, the sort program can often do these faster than IEBGENER. Thus many mainframe shops make use of an option that automatically routes such tasks to the sort ICEGENER program instead of IEBGENER.

On some systems it is possible to send email from a batch job by directing the output to the &quot;codice_9&quot; &quot;external writer&quot;. On such systems, the technique is as follows:
//IEBGENER JOB ACCT,&#x27;DATA COPY&#x27;,MSGCLASS=J,CLASS=A
//NORMRC EXEC PGM=IEBGENER
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*
//SYSUT1 DD *,LRECL=80
HELO &lt;SYSTEMID&gt;
MAIL FROM:&lt;USERID@SYSTEMID&gt;
RCPT TO:&lt;USERID@SYSTEMID&gt;
DATA
From: &lt;USERID@SYSTEMID&gt;
To: &lt;USERID@SYSTEMID&gt;
Subject: Test Mail

TEST MAIL FROM MAINFRAME
QUIT
//SYSUT2 DD SYSOUT=(B,SMTP),LRECL=80
//SYSIN DD DUMMY
It is also possible to attach files while sending the email from Mainframe.

===IEBIMAGE===
IEBIMAGE manipulates several types of definitions (AKA &quot;images&quot;) for the IBM 3211 printer, IBM 3800 laser printing subsystem and the IBM 4248 printer. Common uses are for forms control buffers (FCBs), character arrangement tables, character definitions and images of forms to be printed on the output along with the text, for company logos to be printed on the page, or just to print &#x27;graybar&#x27; pages (alternating gray &amp; white horizontal backgrounds, to match the previous greenbar paper). With this utility, many different forms or logos could be stored as images, and printed when needed, all using the same standard blank paper, thus eliminating the need to stock many preprinted forms, and the need for operators to stop the printer and change paper.

===IEBISAM===
IEBISAM unloads, loads, copies and prints ISAM datasets.

Extracted from IBM manual SC26-7414-08 z/OS DFSMSdfp Utilities: The IEBISAM program is no longer distributed. Starting in z/OS V1R7, ISAM data sets can no longer be processed (created, opened, copied or dumped). ISAM data
sets that are still in use must be converted to VSAM key-sequenced data sets.

Prior to z/OS V1R7, you could use access method services to allocate a VSAM key-sequenced data set and copy an ISAM data set into it.

===IEBPTPCH===
IEBPTPCH (&quot;PrinT and PunCH&quot;) prints or punches records from a sequential or partitioned dataset.

Some of the tasks that IEBPTPCH can perform include the following:
* Printing or punching an entire data set, sequential or partitioned (PDS).
* Printing or punching selected PDS members.
* Printing or punching selected records from a sequential or partitioned data set.
* Printing or punching a PDS directory.
* Printing or punching an edited version of a sequential data set or PDS.
* Check for empty dataset
//IEBPTPCH JOB
// EXEC PGM=IEBPTPCH
//SYSIN DD *
 PRINT MAXFLDS=2
 TITLE ITEM=(&#x27;Name&#x27;,22),

//SYSIN DD *
 PRINT TYPORG=PS 
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*


=== IEBTCRIN===

Read records from a 2495 Tape Cartridge Reader.

===IEBUPDAT===

Changes records in a sequential dataset or in a member of a partitioned dataset, replaced by, but not compatible with, IEBUPDTE.

===IEBUPDTE===
IEBUPDTE (&quot;UPDaTE&quot;) incorporates changes to sequential or partitioned datasets. The UNIX codice_10 utility is a similar program, but uses different input format markers (&quot;e..g&quot;, &quot;./ INSERT ...&quot; in MVS becomes &quot;@@...&quot; in Unix Patch).

Some programmers pronounce it &quot;I.E.B. up-ditty&quot;.

The IEBUPDTE utility is used to maintain source libraries. 
Some of the functions that IEBUPDTE can perform include the following:
* Creating and updating libraries
* Modifying sequential data sets or PDS members
* Changing the organization of a data set from sequential to partitioned or from partitioned to sequential.

IEBUPDTE is commonly used to distribute source libraries from tape to DASD.

IEBUPDTE uses the same job control statements required by most IEB-type utilities. The only exceptions are as follow:
* IEBUPDTE accepts a PARM parameter coded on the EXEC statement, NEW or MOD. &quot;NEW&quot; indicates that the utility control statements and the input data are contained in the SYSIN DD statement, so no SYSUT1 DD statement is needed. &quot;MOD&quot; indicates that the SYSIN DD statement contains only utility control statements, without input data. Therefore, the SYSUT1 DD statement is required to define the input data set.
* IEBUPDTE reads the input data set from either the SYSUT1 DD statement or from the SYSIN DD statement.

The job control used by IEUPDTE are as follows:
//stepname EXEC PGM=IEUPDTE,PARM=NEW 
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=class
//SYSUT1 DD ...
//SYSUT2 DD ...
//SYSIN DD ...
==Scheduler utilities==
===IEFBR14===

IEFBR14 is a dummy program, normally inserted in JCL when the only desired action is allocation or deletion of datasets.

An example of an IEFBR14 step:
//IEFBR14 JOB ACCT,&#x27;DELETE DATASET&#x27;
//STEP01 EXEC PGM=IEFBR14
//DELDD DD DSN=xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz,
// DISP=(MOD,DELETE,DELETE),UNIT=DASD
The calling sequence for OS/360 contained the return address in Register 14. A branch to Register 14 would thus immediately exit the program. However, before and after executing this program, the operating system would allocate &amp; deallocate datasets as specified in the DD statements, so it is commonly used as a quick way to set up or remove datasets.

It consisted initially as a single instruction a &quot;Branch to Register&quot; 14. The mnemonic used in the IBM Assembler was BR and hence the name: IEF BR 14. IEF is the &quot;prefix&quot; of OS/360&#x27;s &quot;job management&quot; subsystem.

This single instruction program had an error in it — it didn&#x27;t set the return code. Hence a second instruction had to be added to clear the return code so that it would exit with the correct status.

There was an additional error reported and fixed by IBM on this now two instruction program. This error was due to the IEFBR14 program not being link-edited as reenterable (simultaneously usable by more than one caller).

Some hackers have taken IEFBR14 and changed the BR 14 instruction to BR 15, thereby creating &quot;the shortest loop in the world&quot;, as register 15 contains the address of the IEFBR14 module itself, and a BR 15 instruction would simply re-invoke the module, forever.

==System utilities==
These utilities are normally used by systems programmers in maintaining the operation of the system, rather than by programmers in doing application work on the system.

===ICKDSF===
ICKDSF (&quot;Device Support Facility&quot;) installs, initializes and maintains DASD, either under an operating system, or standalone.

===IEHATLAS===

Assign alternate tracks to defective tracks.

===IEHDASDR===
IEHDASDR can performs several operations for direct access storage devices (DASD)

* Initialize a DASD volume, with optional surface checking
* Assign alternate tracks to defective tracks
* Print tracks on a DASD 
* Create a backup of a DASD volume on tape
* Restore DASD volumes from backup tapes.

IBM eventually stopped adding support for new device types to IEHDASDR and directed customers to the free DSF for initializing volumes and to the chargeable DASDR (5740-UT1) and Data Facility/Data Set Services (5740-UT3, DF/DSS) for dump/restore.

IBM removed IEHDASDR in MVS/XA.

===IEHINITT===
IEHINITT (&quot;INITialize Tape&quot;) initializes tapes by writing tape labels. Multiple tapes may be labeled in one run of the utility. IBM standard or ASCII labels may be written.

An example of an IEHINITT program:
//IEHINITT JOB ACCT,&#x27;LABEL TAPES&#x27;,MSGCLASS=J,CLASS=A
//STEP0001 EXEC PGM=IEHINITT,REGION=8M 
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=A 
//LABEL DD DCB=DEN=2,UNIT=(3490,1,DEFER) 
//SYSIN DD * 
LABEL INITT SER=123450,NUMBTAPE=3 


This example will label 3 tapes on a 3490 magnetic tape unit. Each tape will receive an IBM standard label. The VOLSER will be incremented by one for each tape labeled. Each tape will be rewound and unloaded after being labeled.

===IEHIOSUP===
IEHIOSUP updates relative track addresses (TTR) links for type IV Supervisor Call (SVC) routines in SYS1.SVCLIB. IEHIOSUP is no longer supported in OS/VS2 and later.

OPEN, CLOSE, and EOV functions are performed by a series of SVC modules that execute sequentially. Some modules contain tables used by the codice_11 macro to link to the next in the series. For performance reasons, to avoid a directory search each time, these tables contain the disk addresses of the modules rather than the names. Updates to SYS1.SVCLIB may cause these addresses to change, so IEHIOSUP needs to be run to install the correct addresses.

This is an example of the JCL required to run IEHIOSUP.

//IHEIOSUP JOB
// EXEC PGM=IEHIOSUP
//SYSUT1 DD DSNAME=SYS1.SVCLIB~DISP=OLD,UNIT=2311,
// VOLUME=SER=111111
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=A


===IEHLIST===
IEHLIST is a utility used to list entries in a Partitioned Dataset (PDS) directory or to list the contents of a Volume Table of Contents (VTOC).

The IEHLIST utility is used to list the entries contained in any one of the following:
* PDS directory
* VTOC
* Catalog (OS CVOL)

An example of an IEHLIST program:
//IEHLIST JOB ACCT,&#x27;LIST PDS&#x27;,MSGCLASS=J,CLASS=A
//STEP0001 EXEC PGM=IEHLIST,REGION=8M 
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=A
//PDS1 DD DSN=xxxx.yyyy.zzzz,DISP=OLD
//SYSIN DD *
 LISTPDS DSNAME=xxxx.yyyy.zzzz,FORMAT


This job will produce a formatted listing of the PDS directory of the PDS named xxxx.yyyy.zzzz.

An example of an IEHLIST program to list a VTOC is very similar:
//IEHLIST JOB ACCT,&#x27;LIST VTOC&#x27;,MSGCLASS=J,CLASS=A
//STEP0001 EXEC PGM=IEHLIST,REGION=8M 
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=A
//VOL1 DD VOL=SER=vvvvvv,DISP=OLD
//SYSIN DD *
 LISTVTOC VOL=SER=vvvvvv,FORMAT


===IEHMOVE===
IEHMOVE moves or copies collections of data. However, DFSMS (System Managed Storage) environments are now common, and IBM does not recommend using the IEHMOVE utility in those. A move differs from a copy in that following a move the original data set is deleted, or scratched. Some of the tasks that IEHMOVE can perform include the following:
*Moving or copying sequential and partitioned data sets
*Moving or copying multi- volume data sets
*Moving an entire volume of data sets

On the surface, IEHMOVE may seen redundant to the IEBGENER and IEBCOPY utilities. However, IEHMOVE is more powerful. The main advantage of using IEHMOVE is that you do not need to specify space or DCB information for the new data sets. This is because IEHMOVE allocates this information based on the existing data sets.

Another advantage of IEHMOVE is that you can copy or move groups of data sets as well as entire volumes of data. Because of the ease in moving groups of data sets or volumes, the IEHMOVE utility is generally favored by systems programmers.

A sample IEHMOVE job:
//stepname EXEC PGM=IEHMOVE,PARM=&#x27;LINECNT=xx,POWER=n&#x27;
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=class
//SYSUT1 DD UNIT=aaaa,VOL=SER=bbbbbb,DISP=OLD
//anyname1 DD UNIT=cccc,VOL=SER=dddddd,DISP=OLD
//anyname2 DD UNIT=eeee,VOL=SER=ffffff,DISP=OLD
//SYSIN DD ...
The DD statements for IEHMOVE, other than SYSPRINT and SYSIN, refer to DASD or magnetic tape volumes instead of individual data sets. However, referencing volumes can pose a problem, since specifying codice_12 gains exclusive access to a volume. Therefore, while your IEHMOVE job runs, that entire volume (and all datasets on it) is unavailable to other users. This is acceptable for private volumes, such as tape or mountable DASD volumes, but unacceptable public volumes.

The SYSUT1 DD statement specifies a DASD volume where three work data set required by IEHMOVE are allocated. You must specify unit and volume information for this DD statement.

IEHMOVE was one of the first systems to be developed in PL/S.

In this example, three sequential data sets (SEQSET1, SEQSET2, and SEQSET3) are moved from one disk volume to three separate disk volumes. Each of the three receiving volumes is mounted when it is required by IEHMOVE. The source data sets are not cataloged. Space is allocated by IEHMOVE.

//MOVEDS JOB ...
//STEP1 EXEC PGM=IEHMOVE

 MOVE DSNAME=SEQSET2,TO=disk=222333,FROM=disk=444444
 MOVE DSNAME=SEQSET3,TO=disk=222444,FROM=disk=444444


===IEHPROGM===
IEHPROGM builds and maintains system control data. It is also used for renaming and scratching (deleting) a data set.

Some of the tasks that IEHPROGM can perform include the following:
* Deleting (scratching) a data set or PDS member
* Renaming a data set or PDS member
* Cataloging or uncataloging a data set
* Maintaining data set passwords in the system PASSWORD dataset

For cataloging:
//SYSIN DD *
 CATLG DSNNAME=data-set-name,
 VOL=device-name=volume-number
//
===IFHSTATR===
Select and format SMF records for tape errors.

==Independent Utilities==

===IBCDASDI===
Format direct access volumes and assign alternate tracks.

=== IBCDMPRS===

Dump and restore direct access volumes.

===IBCRCVRP===

Assign alternate tracks, recover and replace data.

=== ICAPRTBL===

Load Forms Control Buffer (FCB) and Universal Character Set (UCS) buffer on printer.

==Service Aids==

These are utility program that IBM documents in service aids or diagnosis manuals. The original OS/360 Service aids had names beginning with IFC and IM*, but IBM changed the naming convention to HM* for OS/VS1 and to AM* for OS/VS2. IBM did not change the IFC convention.

===IFCDIP00===

Initializes the SYS1.LOGREC data set.

===IFCEREP0===

Summarizes and prints records from the SYS1.LOGREC error recording data set.

===GTF (Generalized Trace Facility)===

===IMASPZAP===
Verifies and/or replaces instructions and/or data in a load module, program object, or disk file.

===IMBLIST===

Formats and prints object modules, load modules, program objects and CSECT identification records.

===IMBMDMAP===

Maps load modules. The functions of this program have been subsumed by IMBLIST.

===IMCJQDMP===

Stand-alone program to format and print the system job queue. Not applicable to MVS.

===IMCOSJQD===

Format and print the system job queue. Not applicable to MVS.

===IMDPRDMP===

Formats and prints core dumps, TSO swap data set, and GTF trace data.

===IMDSADMP===

Stand-alone program to produce a high-speed or low-speed dump of main storage.

==Miscellaneous supporting programs==

===SORT===
The Sort/Merge utility is a program which sorts records in a file into a specified order, or merge pre-sorted files. It is very frequently used; often the most commonly used application program in a mainframe shop. Modern sort/merge programs also can select or omit certain records, summarize records, remove duplicates, reformat records, and produce simple reports. Sort/merge is important enough that there are multiple companies each selling their own sort/merge package for IBM mainframes.

IBM&#x27;s original OS/360 sort/merge program, 360S-SM-023, program name IERRCO00 (alias SORT), supported only IBM&#x27;s first-generation direct-access storage devices (DASD) and tapes (2400). Support for second-generation disk drives was provided by IBM program products such as 5734-SM1 and the later 5740-SM1 (DFSORT, alias ICEMAN, also SORT).

SORT is frequently executed as a stand-alone program, where it normally reads input from a file identified by DD codice_13 and writes sorted output to a file identified by DD codice_14. It is also often called from another application, via the COBOL codice_15 verb or calls to PL/I codice_16 routines, where it may use either codice_13 or codice_14 files or be passed records to be sorted by the caller and/or pass sorted records back to the caller one at a time.

The operation of SORT is directed by control statements, which are largely compatible among various IBM and third-party sort programs. The codice_15 or codice_20 statement defines the &quot;sort keys&quot;— the fields on which the data is to be sorted or merged. This statement identifies the position, length, and data type of each key. The codice_21 statement describes the format and length of the records in the input file. Other statements allow the user to specify which records should be included or excluded from the sort and specify other transformations to be performed on the data.

Keys can be any combination of EBCDIC or ASCII character data, zoned or packed-decimal, signed or unsigned fixed-point binary, or hexadecimal floating-point. Keys can be located anywhere in the record and do not have to be contiguous. Sorting can be specified on any combination of ascending and descending sequence by key.

The OS/360 sort program, IERRCO00, operates by dividing the input data into sections, sorting each section in main memory, and writing the sorted section to intermediate datasets on either direct-access storage devices (DASD) or magnetic tape. Final merge phases then merge the sections to produce the sorted output. SORT uses one of a number of techniques for distributing the sections among secondary storage devices. Usually SORT can choose the optimal technique, but this can be overridden by the user. 
SORT has three techniques that can be used if the intermediate storage is tape, and two if disk.

The tape techniques are:
* Balanced (BALN) - more efficient if more tape drives are available for intermediate storage.
* Polyphase (POLY) - used if fewer tape drives are available for intermediate storage.
* Oscillating (OSCL) - uses more main storage. The size of the input dataset must be known or closely approximated.

The disk techniques are:
* Balanced Direct Access (BALN) - uses three to six intermediate storage datasets.
* Crisscross Direct Access (CRCX) - uses six to seventeen intermediate storage datasets, requires twice the main storage of the Balanced Direct Access technique.

===Linkers===
OS/360 had only the Linkage editor, available in several configurations. DFSMSdfp added the Binder as an alternatives for load modules, and as the only option for program objects.

====Linkage Editor====

The Linkage editor creates and replaces load modules in a partitioned data set from a combination of control cards, object modules other load modules. It can rename or replace a control section (CSECT) and perform several other miscellaneous functions. It was originally available in several configurations depending on storage requirement, but the E level Linkage Editor is no longer available and the F level Linkage Editor is now known simply as the Linkage Editor. In z/OS the Linkage Editor is only present for compatibility.

====Binder====
The binder, added in DFSMS, performs the same functions as the Linkage Editor. In addition, it supports a new format, the program object, which is the functional equivalent of a load module in Partitioned Data Set Extended (PDSE), with many additional capabilities.

===Assemblers===
One assembler was usually standard, because it was required for system generation (SYSGEN) and customization.

====IETASM====
Assembler (E) was intended for OS/360 running in very small machines.

====IEUASM====
Assembler (F) was intended for normal OS/360 installations.

====IFOX00====
Assembler (XF) was the system assembler for OS/VS1 and OS/VS2, replacing Assembler (E) and (F), although it was not fully compatible with them. IBM soon made Assembler (XF) the system assembler for DOS and VM as well.

====IEV90====
Assembler (H) and Assembler (H) Version 2 are program product assemblers that are generally faster than Assemblers E, F, and XF, although not fully compatible with any of them.

====ASMA90====
IBM High Level Assembler (HLASM) is essentially a new version of Assembler (H) Version 2 and is the only assembler that IBM supports on z/OS and z/VM. It replaces all of the older assemblers, although it is not fully compatible with them.

===Compilers===
Each programming language used in a computer shop will have one or more associated compilers that translate a source program into a machine-language object module. Then the object module from the compiler must be processed by the linkage editor, IEWL, to create an executable load module.

IGYCRCTL is a common example of a compiler; it is the compiler for the current IBM Enterprise COBOL for z/OS product. (There have been several previous IBM COBOL compilers over the years, with different names, although users might provide an alias codice_22 for the current version.) There are many other compilers for various other programming languages.

Compilers available from IBM included ALGOL, COBOL, FORTRAN, PL/I, and RPG. 

===System Modification Program (SMP)===
System Modification Program (SMP) is the vehicle for installing service on OS/360 and successors, replacing, e.g., stand-alone assembly, link edit and IMAPTFLE jobs. Originally an optional facility, it is mandatory for MVS/SP and later, and the program product version, SMP/E, is included in the more recent systems, e.g., z/OS.

<text>The following is a list of towers of the [[Moscow Kremlin]]. The Kremlin Wall is a defensive wall that surrounds the Moscow Kremlin, recognizable by the characteristic notches and its towers. The original walls were likely a simple wooden fence with guard towers built in 1156. The Kremlin is flanked by 19 towers with a 20th, the Kutafya Tower, not part of its walls.

== Borovitskaya ==
The Borovitskaya Tower () is a corner tower with a through-passage on the west side of the Kremlin. It is named after Borovitsky Hill, one of the seven hills Moscow is standing on. The tower was constructed in 1490 on the spot of an old Kremlin gate by Italian architect Pietro Antonio Solari (Petr Fryazin, from or as Italians were called at that time) by order of Vasili III of Russia. In 1658 by orders of tzar Aleksey I of Russia the tower was renamed to &quot;Predtechenskaya&quot; (from the Russian word &quot;предтеча&quot;, &quot;the forerunner&quot;) after the Church of John the Forerunner, which was later destroyed during the construction of the Kremlin Armoury (&quot;Oruzheynaya Palata&quot;). The new name, however, never became popular. In 1812, the tower was damaged by an explosion staged by the retreating French army. In 1817-19, the tower was restored by architect Osip Bove. In 1935, the Soviets installed a red star on top of the tower. Following the closure of the Spassky Gate in Red Square to all traffic at the end of the 1990s, the Borovitsky Gate became the main vehicle passageway. Together with the star, its height is .

== Vodovzvodnaya ==
The Vodovzvodnaya Tower () is a corner tower on the southwestern side of Kremlin, overlooking the Moskva River. It was built in 1488 by an Italian architect Antonio Gilardi (also known as Anton Fryazin). Initially, the tower was called the Sviblova Tower (Свиблова башня) after the Sviblov boyar family, who had lived in a house adjacent to the tower from the Kremlin&#x27;s side. The tower was renamed to Vodovzvodnaya in 1633 after the installation of a water-supplying machine inside the tower (&quot;vodovzvodnaya&quot; may be translated as &quot;water-lifting&quot;). In 1805, the Vodovzvodnaya Tower was dismantled due to its dilapidation and built once again. In 1812, the retreating French army blew it up. The tower was restored in 1817-1819 by architect Osip Bove. Its height is .

== Blagoveschenskaya ==
The Blagoveschenskaya Tower (), known in English as the Annunciation Tower, was erected in 1487-1488. At its foundation are slabs of white limestone that have survived since the time of the white stone Kremlin of the 14th century. During the reign of Ivan the Terrible, the tower was used as a prison. The name of the tower comes from the miracle-working Icon of the Annunciation, which was once kept here, and is also associated with the Cathedral of the Annunciation added to the tower in the early 18th century and demolished in 1932. In the 17th century, the Portomoyniye Gates were built nearby so that palace laundresses could go to the Portomoiny raft on the Moscow River to rinse porty, or underclothes. These gates were bricked up in 1813.

The height of the tower is ( together with the weather vane that replaced the original cross in 1932).

Geographical coordinates: .

== Taynitskaya ==
The Taynitskaya Tower (; it was also called &quot;Водяная башня&quot; (&quot;Vodyanaya bashnya&quot;), or the Water Tower) is a middle tower on the south side of the Moscow Kremlin. It was built in 1485 by Antonio Gilardi on the spot of the gates to Dmitry Donskoy&#x27;s whitestone Kremlin. The Taynitskaya Tower had a secret well and a tunnel leading to the Moscow River (hence, the name &quot;Taynitskaya&quot;, or &quot;secret&quot;). In 1770, the tower was dismantled due to the construction of the Kremlin Palace by Vasili Bazhenov. It was rebuilt in the 1770s. In 1930-1933, the Soviets bricked up the gateway and filled up the well. The Taynitskaya Tower is in height.

Geographical coordinates: .

== First Unnamed ==
The First Unnamed Tower () was built next to the Taynitskaya Tower in the 1480s. It performed strictly defensive functions. In 1547, the tower was destroyed by fire after the gunpowder stored there exploded, and was rebuilt in the 17th century. In 1770, the tower was taken apart to clear the site for the Kremlin Palace. After the construction of the palace ended, the tower was rebuilt in 1783, closer to the Taynitskaya Tower. In 1812, the tower was blown up by Napoleon’s retreating troops, but it was soon restored to its original form by architect Osip Beauvais. Its height is .

Geographical coordinates: .

== Second Unnamed ==
The Second Unnamed Tower () was built in the middle of the 15th century. It had purely defensive functions. In 1680, a quadrangular structure and a tall pyramidal tent roof with a watchtower were added to the top of the tower. It is crowned with an eight-sided hipped cupola with a weather vane.

Geographical coordinates: .

== Petrovskaya ==
The Petrovskaya Tower () is named after the Church of Metropolitan Peter, which was part of the mission of the Ugreshi Monastery located near the tower in the Kremlin. The Petrovskaya Tower was destroyed by cannon fire during the Polish invasion in 1612 and then restored. In 1771, it was pulled down to construct the Kremlin Palace, but was rebuilt in 1783. In 1812, the tower was blown up by Napoleon’s retreating troops. In 1818, it was rebuilt by the architect Osip Bove. The Petrovskaya Tower was used as a service building by the Kremlin&#x27;s gardeners. Its height is .

Geographical coordinates: .

== Beklemishevskaya ==
The Beklemishevskaya Tower (, also known as &quot;Москворецкая башня&quot; (&quot;Moskvoretskaya bashnya&quot;), or Moskvoretskaya Tower) is a corner tower on the southeastern side of the Moscow Kremlin on the Moscow River. The tower was built in 1487-1488 by an Italian architect Marco Ruffo (known as Mark Fryazin in Russia). It was named after a boyar Ivan Bersen-Beklemishev, whose house had been adjacent to the tower from the Kremlin side. The Beklemishevskaya Tower was constructed for protecting the ford and the crossing over the Moscow River. There was the so-called &quot;listening&quot; vault underneath the tower, which was used for preventing the enemy from tunneling his way to the Kremlin. The Beklemishevskaya Tower is in height. During the October Revolution of 1917, the top of the tower was damaged by a shell. It was restored a year later by an architect I.V. Rylsky.

== Konstantino-Eleninskaya ==
The Konstantino-Eleninskaya Tower () is a tower on the eastern wall of the Kremlin, overlooking the so-called Basil Descent (Васильевский спуск), which begins at the Red Square and ends at the Moscow River. The tower was built in 1490 by an Italian architect Pietro Antonio Solari on the spot of gates to the whitestone Kremlin. It was named after the Church of Constantine and Helene in the Kremlin (second half of the 17th century), which would be demolished by the Soviets in 1928. The Konstantino-Eleninskaya Tower had its own gates and a lift bridge, protected by guards at all times. In the late 18th century - early 19th century the gates were bricked up and the bridge was dismantled. The tower&#x27;s height is .

Geographical coordinates: .

== Nabatnaya ==
The Nabatnaya Tower () is a tower in the southeastern section of the Kremlin wall, built in 1495. It is in height. Traditionally, there has always been a bell on top of the Nabatnaya Tower, used for notifying citizens of fires and other misfortunes in the Kremlin or on the Red Square (hence, the name Nabatnaya, which derives from the old Russian word &quot;набат&quot; - &quot;nabat&quot;, meaning &quot;alarm&quot; or &quot;tocsin&quot;). In 1680, a bellmaker Feodor Dmitriev cast the so-called Nabatny bell (alarm bell) weighing 150 poods (2.45 metric tons) and installed it on the tower. The bell subsequently broke and was re-cast by Ivan Motorin on 30 July 1714. The sound from this bell served as a signal for the spontaneous uprising of the Muscovites during the plague outbreak in 1771, which would later be called the Plague Riot (Чумной бунт). By the order of Catherine the Great, the tongue of the bell was removed after this incident. The tongueless bell remained on top of the tower for 30 more years. In the early 19th century, it was removed and transferred to the Arsenal. In 1821, the bell was moved to the Armoury, where it remains to this day in the vestibule.

== Tsarskaya ==
The Tsarskaya Tower (, translated as &quot;Tsar&#x27;s tower&quot;) is the youngest and smallest tower of all, built in 1680. It is not a tower per se, it is rather a stone terem, a tent-shaped chamber placed directly on top of the wall. Previously, there was a small wooden turret, from which, according to legend, tsar Ivan IV liked to observe what was happening on the Red Square. Hence the name, the Tsar&#x27;s Tower. The white stone bands around the posts, tall corner pyramids with gilt flags and tent roof topped with an elegant gilt weather vane make the tower look like some structure from a fairy tale.

== Spasskaya ==
The Spasskaya Tower was built in 1491 by the Italian architect Pietro Antonio Solari. Initially, it was named the Frolovskaya Tower after the Church of Frol and Lavr in the Kremlin, which is no longer there. The tower&#x27;s modern name comes from the icon of &#x27;Spas Nerukotvorny&#x27; () translated as &#x27;The Saviour Not Made by Hands&#x27;, which was placed above the gates on the inside wall in 1658 and removed in 1917. The tower is also named for the wall-painted icon of &#x27;Spas Smolensky&#x27; () translated as &#x27;Smolensky Saviour&#x27;, which was created in the 16th century on the outside wall of tower, plastered over in 1937, but reopened and restored in 2010.

The Spasskaya Tower was the first tower of the many Moscow Kremlin Towers to be crowned with the hipped roof in 1624–1625 by architects Bazhen Ogurtsov and Christopher Galloway (a Scottish architect and clock maker). According to a number of historical accounts, the clock on the Spasskaya Tower appeared between 1491 and 1585. It is usually referred to as the Kremlin chimes (Кремлёвские куранты) and designates official Moscow Time. The clock face has a diameter of . The gate of Spasskaya Tower was used to greet foreign dignitaries, and was used during formal ceremonies or processions held on Red Square.

== Senatskaya ==
The Senatskaya Tower () was built in 1491 by an architect Pietro Antonio Solari and was purely defensive in nature: it guarded the Kremlin on the Red Square side. For a long time it remained nameless. It was only in 1787, after architect Matvei Kazakov constructed the Kremlin Senate on the Kremlin’s territory, that it was given its present name. The dome of the Senate can be seen from Red Square. Inside the central part of the tower there are three tiers of vaulted chambers. In 1860, the flat tower was topped with a stone tent roof crowned, in turn, with a gilt weather vane. The tower contains a through-passage that allows VIPs to travel from the kremlin to Red Square.

== Nikolskaya ==
The Nikolskaya Tower () is a tower with a through-passage on the eastern wall of the Moscow Kremlin, which overlooks the Red Square not far from the State Historical Museum.

The Nikolskaya Tower was built in 1491 by an Italian architect Pietro Antonio Solari. It was named after Nikolaevsky (Nikolsky) Greek Monastery, which is no longer there. In 1806, the tower was rebuilt in the neo-Gothic style by an architect Luigi Rusca. In 1812, the top of the tower was blown up by the retreating French army. It was restored in 1816 by an architect Osip Bove. The Nikolskaya Tower was once again severely damaged by the artillery fire in October 1917 and was later restored by an architect Nikolai Markovnikov. In 1935, the Soviets installed a red star on top of the tower. Its current height with the star is . The original icon of Saint Nicholas of Mozhaysk, placed above the entrance on Red Square had been plastered over by Soviet authorities and was uncovered and restored in 2010 - similar to what took place on the Spasskaya Tower.

== Corner Arsenalnaya ==
The Corner Arsenalnaya Tower (, i.e. &quot;Corner Arsenal tower&quot;) is a &quot;tower&quot; of the Moscow Kremlin. It was built in 1492 by an Italian architect Pietro Antonio Solari. The construction of this tower completed the Kremlin&#x27;s line of defence from the side of the Red Square. It was called the Sobakin Tower until the early 18th century (named so after a boyar Sobakin, whose house had been adjacent to the tower from the Kremlin side). The Corner Arsenalnaya Tower received its current name after the construction of the Arsenal. The tower still has a secret well. In 1707, due to a threat of Swedish invasion, the gun slots of the Corner Arsenalnaya Tower were enlarged to fit heavy cannons. In 1812, the tower was damaged by an explosion, set up by the retreating French army. It was restored in 1816-1819 by architect Osip Bove.

The tower&#x27;s current height is over .

== Middle Arsenalnaya ==
The Middle Arsenalnaya Tower (, i.e. &quot;Middle Arsenal tower&quot;) is a Kremlin tower, built in 1495. It is located on the northwestern side of the Kremlin wall and overlooks the Alexander Garden. It is situated on the spot of a corner tower dating from the reign of Dmitry Donskoi. It was given its present name, the Middle Arsenal Tower, after the Arsenal was completed in the mid-18th century. Originally, it was called the Faceted Tower because of the shape of its façade. In 1680, an open lookout with a small pyramid-shaped top was added to the tower. In 1821, when the Alexander Garden was laid out, an ancient-style grotto was built at the foot of the tower, designed by Osip Bove.

== Troitskaya ==
 The Troitskaya Tower was built in 1495–1499 by an Italian architect Aloisio da Milano (known in Russia as Aleviz Fryazin Milanets). The tower has borne several names, including Rizopolozhenskaya, Znamenskaya, and Karetnaya. It received its current name in 1658 from the Troitskaya Coaching Inn (Троицкое подворье) in the Kremlin. The two-story basement of the tower housed a prison in the 16th–17th centuries. There is the Troitsky Bridge, which is protected by the Kutafia Tower and leads to the gates of the Troitskaya Tower. There was also a clock on top of the tower between 1585 and 1812. In 1707, due to a threat of Swedish invasion, the gun slots of the Troitskaya Tower were enlarged to fit heavy cannons. In 1935, the Soviets installed a red star on top of the Troitskaya Tower. Prior to Soviet rule the tower had an icon of the Holy Trinity atop its outward face. Because this tower was the formal entrance for huge Communist Party Congresses the icon was totally removed rather than just plastered over as were those on the Spasskaya and Nikolskaya Towers.

== Komendantskaya ==
The Komendantskaya Tower () was completed in 1495. It used to be called &quot;Kolymazhnaya&quot; after the Kremlin’s coach yard, where carriages and coaches had been kept. It was given its present name, the Commandant’s Tower, in the 19th century when the commandant of Moscow took up residence in the Kremlin’s Poteshny – or Amusement – Palace. Like all Kremlin towers, it was supplemented with a tent roof and watchtower in 1676-1686. The height of the tower on the side of the Alexander Garden is .

== Kutafya ==
The Kutafya Tower ( formerly Predmostnaya tower) is an outlying barbican tower of the Moscow Kremlin. Built in 1516 under the leadership of the Milanese architect Aloisio da Milano, in order to protect one end of the Neglinnaya River bridge that comes out of the West side of the Kremlin wall under the Troitskaya Tower. Initially, the Kutafya was surrounded by a moat and was the only access to the city through its lift bridge, nowadays the moat around the bridge has transformed into Alexander Garden. Kutafya is one of the lower height Kremlin towers which had two combat tiers and no spire, with the open-top upper landing equipped with arrowslits and machicolations, which made it a formidable obstacle to the besieging of the Kremlin fortress.

Marking today the main public entrance to the Kremlin, the Kutafya tower was modified several times through the centuries:
* in the 16th and 17th centuries, a system of dikes was built to raise the water level of the Neglinnaya river and create a moat that surrounded the tower from all sides, making its drawbridge the only entry point from the city;
* In 1668 a causeway leading through the tower to the Troitskaya Bridge was built; 
* a delicate ornamental crown in the Muscovite baroque style was built in 1685;
* the divider between the two tiers was destroyed in 1780;
* in 1867, a through-passage to the Manezhnaya Street was built as well as the arched apertures on the sides and a guard house on the south side;
* the guard house was dismantled during the restoration works of carried out in 1974-77.

The Kutafya Tower is currently 13.5 m high; it used to be 18 m but the lower part of the tower was &quot;submerged&quot; by successive constructions that heightened the street-level ground.

<doc id="1273008" wikidata="Q57173" url="?curid=1273008" title="Mikhail Skobelev">
<text>Mikhail Dmitriyevich Skobelev (; 29 September 1843 – 7 July 1882), a Russian general, became famous for his conquest of Central Asia and for his heroism during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878. Dressed in a white uniform and mounted on a white horse, and always in the thickest of the fray, he was known and adored by his soldiers as the &quot;White General&quot; (and by the Turks as the &quot;White Pasha&quot;). During a campaign in Khiva, his Turkmen opponents called him &quot;goz ganly&quot; or &quot;Bloody Eyes&quot;.

British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery assessed Skobelev as the world&#x27;s &quot;ablest single commander&quot; between 1870 and 1914 and wrote of his &quot;skilful and inspiring&quot; leadership. Francis Vinton Greene also rated Skobelev highly.

==Early life and conquest of Khiva==
Skobelev was born in Saint Petersburg on 29 September 1843, at the Petropavlovskaya prison, where his grandfather was the prison chief. His mother was Russian philanthropist Olga Skobeleva, and his father was Russian general Dmitry Ivanovich Skobelev. His youngest sister Zinaida (1856-1899) was married to Eugen Maximilianovich, 5th Duke of Leuchtenberg. After graduating from the General Staff Academy as a staff officer, he was sent to Turkestan in 1868 and, with the exception of an interval of two years, during which he was on the staff of the grand duke Michael in the Caucasus, remained in Central Asia until 1877.

During the Khivan campaign of 1873 he commanded the advance guard of General Lomakin&#x27;s column from Kinderly Bay, in the Caspian Sea, to join General Verevkin, from Orenburg, in the expedition to the Khanate of Khiva, and, after great suffering on the desert march, took a prominent part in the capture of the Khivan capital. Later, dressed as a Turkoman, he explored in a hostile country the route from Khiva to Igdy on the old riverbed of the Oxus.

In 1875, he was given an important command in the expedition against the Khanate of Kokand under General Konstantin Petrovich von Kaufmann, showing great capacity in the action of Makram, where he outmanoeuvered a greatly superior force and captured 58 guns, and in a night attack during the retreat from Andijan, routed a large force with a handful of cavalry.

==Later life, the Battle of Pleven, Geok Tepe==

He was promoted to major-general, decorated with the Order of St George, and appointed the first governor of the Ferghana Oblast. In the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878), he crossed the Danube with the 8th Corps. Skobelev commanded the Caucasian Cossack Brigade in the attack of the Green Hills at the second battle of Pleven. An infantry division under Skobelev&#x27;s command assailed the Grivitsa redoubt to the north. Schakofsky managed to take two redoubts, but by the end of the day the Ottoman forces succeeded in repulsing all the attacks and retaking lost ground. Russian losses amounted to 7,300, and the Ottomans&#x27; to 2,000.

At the capture of Lovetch on 3 September, the general distinguished himself again in desperate fighting on the Green Hills during the third battle of Pleven in which Skobelev took two southern redoubts. The Romanian 4th division, led by General George Manu, took the Grivitsa redoubt after four bloody assaults, personally assisted by Prince Carol. The next day the Turks retook the southern redoubts, but could not dislodge the Romanians, who repelled three counterattacks. From the beginning of September, Russian losses had amounted to roughly 20,000, while the Ottomans lost 5,000.

Promoted to lieutenant-general and given the command of the 16th Division, he took part in the investment of Pleven and also in the fight of 9 December, when Osman Pasha surrendered, with his army. In January 1878 he crossed the Balkans in a severe snowstorm, defeating the Turks at Sheynovo, near Shipka and capturing 36,000 men and 90 guns.

Skobelev returned to Turkestan after the war, and in 1880 and 1881 further distinguished himself by retrieving the disasters inflicted by the Tekke Turkomans: following the Siege of Geoktepe, it was stormed, the general captured the fort. Around 8,000 Turkmen soldiers and civilians, including women and children were slaughtered in a bloodbath in their flight, along with an additional 6,500 who died inside the fortress. The Russians&#x27; massacre included all Turkmen males in the fortress who had not escaped, but they spared some 5,000 women and children and freed 600 Persian slaves. The defeat at Geok Tepe and the following slaughter broke the Turkmen resistance and decided the fate of Transcaspia, which was annexed to the Russian Empire. The great slaughter cowed the Akhal-Tekke country into submission. Skobelev was removed from his command because of the massacre. He was advancing on Ashkhabad and Kalat i-Nadiri when he was disavowed and recalled to Moscow. He was given the command at Minsk. The official reason for his transfer to Europe was to appease European public opinion over the slaughter at Geok Tepe. Some have suggested that he was suffering from delusions of grandeur and showing signs of political ambition.

In the last years of his life, Skobelev engaged actively in politics, supporting the ideas of Russian nationalism and militant Pan-Slavism. He has also been credited as one of the earliest promoters of the concept &quot;Russia for Russians&quot;. At the beginning of 1882, he made speeches in Paris and in Moscow, predicting desperate strife between Slavs and Germans. He was at once recalled to St Petersburg.

== Death ==
Skobelev was staying at the Hotel Dusseaux in Moscow on 7 July 1882 when, by official account, he died suddenly of a heart attack. 

While, actually, he died of exhaustion in Moscow&#x27;s Angleterre Hotel, a brothel, in a suite of a German prostitute named Charlotte Altenrose (or, by some accounts, Altenroz, Altenroze, also known as &quot;Eleanor,&quot; &quot;Wanda,&quot; and &quot;Rosa&quot;.) His mistress went away and called a local street sweeper, who identified the deceased, and called police. Police, upon arrival pushed onlookers out of the scene, and transported Skobelev&#x27;s dead body back into the Hotel Dusseaux. Coroner cited &quot;paralysis of heart and lungs.&quot; This story immediately became a taboo in Russia with only few accounts testified about the real circumstances surrounding his death, including Frank Harris In his memoirs described how a Russian officer told him that Skobelev died in a brothel. This scenario is also alluded to in Aleksander Kuprin&#x27;s short story &quot;Temptation&quot;.

Alexander III wrote: &quot;His loss to the Russian army is one it is hard to replace, and it must be deeply lamented by all true soldiers. It is sad, very sad, to lose men so useful and so devoted to their mission.&quot; This became especially evident during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05. The Russian generals commanding in that war were men of Skobelev&#x27;s generation, but none of them had his military genius or charisma.

== Legacy ==
After Skobelev&#x27;s death, in Moscow a monument was raised in his honour on a major square on Tverskaya Street (across from the city hall, where today stands the statue of Yuri Dolgorukiy, the founder of Moscow), which was given his name, and the town of Fergana in Uzbekistan was renamed Skobelev.

Today, his name still lives, even beyond the Russian Federation: shortly after the end of the Turkish War of 1877, the Bulgarians constructed a park in Pleven, Skobelev Park, on one of the hills where the major battles for the city took place. The park is also a location of the Panorama Pleven&#x27;s Epopee 1877 memorial, where in one of the scenes of the gigantic 360 degree panoramic painting the White General is displayed charging with his horse and bare sword, leading the infantry Russian attack on the Turkish positions. A central boulevard in Sofia, the capital city of Bulgaria, also bears Mikhail Dmitriyevich Skobelev&#x27;s name.

Shortly after the entrance of the park, the bust of the famous general can be seen, watching over the city. The park contains memorials with the names of the Russian and Romanian soldiers that died for the liberation of Pleven, and is decorated with non-functional arms donated by Russia: cannons, cannonballs, gatling guns, rifles, and bayonets.

In the 1955 Soviet-Bulgarian war epic &quot;Heroes of Shipka&quot; Skobelev, played by Yevgeny Samoylov, is portrayed as one of the films main heroes.

<text>Thieves in the Night: Chronicle of an Experiment is a novel by Arthur Koestler written in 1946. Originally intended to be the first of a trilogy, Koestler later concluded that the book stood well enough on its own for further novels to be redundant.

Based on the author&#x27;s own experiences in a kibbutz, it sets up a stage in describing the historical roots of the conflict between Arabs and Jewish settlers in the British ruled Palestine.

The book tackles many subjects, such as Zionism and idealism. Koestler was a Revisionist Zionist in his teens and 20s, but in later life his attitude toward Zionism grew more distant.

The title is a Biblical reference, quoted on the title page:

:&quot;But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night.&quot; (2 Peter 3:10)

Related Biblical references:

:&quot;If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night, (how art thou cut off!) would they not have stolen till they had enough? if the grapegatherers came to thee, would they not leave some grapes?&quot; (Obadiah 1:5)

:&quot;If grapegatherers come to thee, would they not leave some gleaning grapes? If thieves by night, they will destroy till they have enough.&quot; (Jeremiah 49:9)

The first such anagram dictionary was &quot;The Crossword Anagram Dictionary&quot; by R.J. Edwards 

In the other kind of anagram dictionary, words are categorized into equivalence classes that consist of words with the same number of each kind of letter. Thus words will only appear when other words can be made from the same letters. 

Anagram dictionaries were formerly produced by hand, but can now be trivially generated from any machine-readable word list by computer by sorting words in order of their sorted letter-strings.

<text>Hanna Rose Hall (born July 9, 1984) is an American actress. She made her film debut in &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; (1994), and later appeared in Sofia Coppola&#x27;s &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot; (1999) and Rob Zombie&#x27;s &quot;Halloween&quot; (2007).

==Early life==
Hall was born in Denver, Colorado. Her family moved into the mountains when she was two years old, and she remained in Colorado until age eighteen. After high school, she lived in Hawaii and Los Angeles before moving to Vancouver, British Columbia, where she attended the Vancouver Film School.

==Career==
When she was seven years old, Hall attended Nina Axelrod&#x27;s open casting call for Robert Zemeckis&#x27;s &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;. A few callbacks later, Hall was eventually cast as young Jenny Curran. This was followed by a role as an orphaned child in the 1996 television film &quot;Homecoming&quot;, co-starring Anne Bancroft.

Hall screen tested for the role of Lux Lisbon in Sofia Coppola&#x27;s film adaptation of &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot;, but was considered too young for the part so she was cast as Cecilia Lisbon instead. She appeared in several independent films following this, before being cast in Rob Zombie&#x27;s remake of &quot;Halloween&quot; (2007) as Judith Myers. In 2009, she appeared in the independent comedy &quot;American Cowslip&quot; (2009), opposite Val Kilmer, Diane Ladd, and Cloris Leachman.

In 2012, Hall began working as a feline behavior specialist in Venice, California, directing underground plays. She has also appeared on television series, including guest roles on &quot;Criminal Minds&quot; and &quot;Masters of Sex&quot;.

<doc id="1273025" wikidata="Q944632" url="?curid=1273025" title="What a Wonderful World">
<text>&quot;What a Wonderful World&quot; is a song written by Bob Thiele (as &quot;George Douglas&quot;) and George David Weiss. It was first recorded by Louis Armstrong on August 16, 1967. In April 1968, it topped the pop chart in the United Kingdom, but performed poorly in the United States because Larry Newton, the president of ABC Records, disliked the song and refused to promote it.

After it was heard in the film &quot;Good Morning, Vietnam&quot;, it was reissued as a single in 1988, and rose to number 32 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Armstrong&#x27;s recording was inducted to the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999.

== Composition and production ==
Thiele, using the pseudonym George Douglas, co-wrote the song with George Weiss. Thiele&#x27;s real name has been used for the composer credits from 1988 onward. Thiele said the following regarding his inspiration for the song: &quot;[I]n the mid-1960s during the deepening national traumas of the Kennedy assassination, Vietnam, racial strife, and turmoil everywhere, my co-writer George David Weiss and I had an idea to write a ‘different’ song specifically for Louis Armstrong that would be called &#x27;What a Wonderful World.&#x27;&quot; Thiele also produced the original recording of the song, using his real name for the production credit. In Graham Nash&#x27;s book &quot;Off the Record: Songwriters on Songwriting,&quot; George Weiss says he wrote the song specifically for Louis Armstrong, as he was inspired by Armstrong&#x27;s ability to bring together people of different races.

One source claims the song was first offered to Tony Bennett, who turned it down, although Louis Armstrong biographer Ricky Riccardi disputes this. 

Armstrong was gigging at the Tropicana Hotel in Las Vegas, so he chose to record the song nearby at Bill Porter&#x27;s United Recording studio. The session was scheduled to follow Armstrong&#x27;s midnight show, and by 2 am the musicians were settled and tape was rolling. Arranger Artie Butler was there with songwriters Weiss and Thiele, and Armstrong was in the studio singing with the orchestra. Armstrong had recently signed to ABC Records, and ABC president Larry Newton showed up to photograph Armstrong. Newton wanted a swingy pop song like &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;, a big hit for Armstrong when he was with Kapp Records, so when Newton heard the slow pace of &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot;, he tried to stop the session. Newton was physically removed and locked out of the studio for his disruption, which resulted in Newton later refusing to promote the song.

A second problem arose with the taping session: nearby freight train whistles interrupted the music twice, forcing the orchestra to start over. Armstrong shook his head and laughed off the distractions, keeping his composure. The session ended around 6 am, going longer than expected. To be sure the orchestra members were paid extra for their overtime, Armstrong accepted only $250 musicians&#x27; union scale for his work.

==Release and reception==

Because Newton refused to promote the song, it initially sold fewer than 1,000 copies in the US. It was a major success in the United Kingdom, however, reaching number 1 on the UK Singles Chart. In the US, it eventually reached number 116 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Bubbling Under Chart. It was also the biggest-selling single of 1968 in the UK, where it was among the last pop singles issued by His Master&#x27;s Voice before it became an exclusively classical music label. The song made Armstrong the oldest male to top the UK Singles Chart. (His record was broken in 2009 when a remake of &quot;Islands in the Stream&quot; recorded for Comic Relief—which included the 68-year-old Tom Jones—reached number 1.)

ABC Records&#x27; European distributor EMI forced ABC to issue a &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot; album in 1968 (catalogue number ABCS-650). It did not chart in the United States, due to ABC not promoting it, but charted in the UK where it was issued by Stateside Records with catalogue number SSL 10247 and peaked on the British chart at number 37.

==Enduring success==

The song gradually became something of a pop standard. An episode of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; produced in 1977 and broadcast early in 1978 featured Rowlf the Dog singing the song to a puppy. In 1978, it was featured in the closing scenes of BBC radio&#x27;s &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, and was repeated for BBC&#x27;s 1981 TV adaptation of the series. In 1988, Armstrong&#x27;s recording was used in the film &quot;Good Morning, Vietnam&quot; (despite its setting in 1965, two years before the song was recorded) and was re-released as a single, reaching number 32 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in February 1988. It charted at number 1 for the fortnight ending June 27, 1988 on the Australian chart. 

When the ABC television sitcom &quot;Family Matters&quot; premiered in 1989, Armstrong&#x27;s version of &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot; was used as the show&#x27;s theme song. However, after the fifth episode, it was replaced by the original song &quot;As Days Go By&quot;.

In 2001, rappers Ghostface Killah, Raekwon, and the Alchemist released &quot;The Forest,&quot; a song that begins with three lines of lyric adapted from &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot;, altered to become &quot;an invitation to get high&quot; on marijuana. The rappers and their record company, Sony Music Entertainment, were sued by Abilene Music, the owners of &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot;. The suit was thrown out after Judge Gerard E. Lynch determined that the altered lyric was a parody, transforming the uplifting original message to a new one with a darker nature.

After it was released digitally, Armstrong&#x27;s 1967 recording had sold over 2,173,000 downloads in the United States as of April 2014.

In 2021, it was ranked at No. 171 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s &quot;Top 500 Best Songs of All Time&quot;.

==Eva Cassidy and Katie Melua version==
In 2007, Georgian-British singer-songwriter Katie Melua recorded a version of &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot; with American singer and guitarist Eva Cassidy, who had died in 1996. Recorded by Melua singing over the original Cassidy track, the duet was released in late 2007 as a charity single for the British Red Cross. Melua, who considers Cassidy one of her musical idols, had previously sung with Cassidy in this manner on Christmas Eve 2006, when she performed &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; on the BBC One television program &quot;Duets Impossible&quot; with a videotape of Cassidy singing the song. This version of &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot; was available for purchase only at Tesco stores and on the Tesco Direct website.

Upon its release, the single debuted at number 45 on the Scottish Singles Chart on the week of December 9, 2007. The next week, the song rose 44 positions to number one while also debuting at number one on the UK Singles Chart, giving both Cassidy and Melua their first number-one single in the United Kingdom. It became the first UK number-one single to be available through only one retailer, with 97 percent of its weekly 56,114 sales coming from the physical CD format sold at Tesco. The song quickly descended the UK chart after peaking, spending five weeks in the UK top 100. The cover was also successful in Sweden, reaching number 19 in November 2008, and became a minor hit in the Wallonia region of Belgium.

When the song reached number one in the UK, Melua thanked everyone who bought the single, saying, &quot;Thank you to everyone who has shown such festive goodwill.&quot; The duet was later included on her 2008 compilation album &quot;The Katie Melua Collection&quot;.

<text>Ghana elects on national level a head of state, the president, and a legislature. The president is elected for a four-year term by the people. According to the constitution, each President can be elected for only two (four-year) terms after which they are no longer eligible to run for Presidency. The Parliament of Ghana has 275 members, elected for a four-year term in single-seat constituencies. Unlike the Presidency, parliamentarians are eligible to run for as many terms as possible so long as they are of sound mind.

== Electoral system of Ghana ==
The presidential election is won by having more than 50% of valid votes cast, whilst the parliamentary elections is won by simple majority, and, as is predicted by Duverger&#x27;s law, the voting system has encouraged Ghanaian politics into a two-party system, creating extreme difficulty for anybody attempting to achieve electoral success under any banner other than those of the two dominant parties. Elections have been held every four years since 1992. 

Presidential and parliamentary elections are held alongside each other, generally on 7 December every four years.

To qualify as a Presidential candidate, the person is required to be Ghanaian citizens by birth, be at least 40 years old, and must be of sound mind. Again, the person must either be nominated by a political party or stand as independent candidate, provided the necessary requirements are met, including a full payment of presidential filing fees. Presidential campaigns typically span several months to years leading up to Election Day. Candidates are allowed to engage in rallies, debates, and media appearances to communicate their vision and developmental policies (manifestos) for the country and garner support from voters. Ghanaian citizens aged 18 and above are eligible to vote in presidential elections. 

Ghana is divided into constituencies, each represented by a Member of Parliament (MP).  Similar to the Presidential elections, each political party presents a list of candidates for each constituency, and voters cast their ballots. Non-aligned or independent candidates are equally eligible to stand for parliamentary elections. Candidates&#x27; filing fees for parliamentary elections is always lower compared to the presidential filing fees. 

The Presidential and Parliamentary elections are organized, conducted and supervised by the Electoral Commission of Ghana(EC), the official body responsible for public elections and referendums in Ghana. The Commission, headed by the Electoral Commissioner, operates independently and has the mandated by the constitution to ensure the integrity and transparency of the electoral process. The EC also superintendents over nationwide voter registration, candidate nomination, ballot printing, polling station setup, collation, tabulation and announcement of election results.

== Ethnic voting in Ghana ==
Ethnic voting is the idea that people utilize candidates&#x27; ethnic identity to decide who can be best trusted to follow through with their promises for goods to their constituents as payment for their vote. This form of vote buying in which one&#x27;s vote is paid for through a targeted public good is known as clientelism and is especially popular in sub-Saharan African countries. Kanchan Chandra, one of the leading academics in Ethnic Politics, claims that there are several causes for this phenomenon in Africa. First, the individual has an incentive to seek out public goods for their vote because of one&#x27;s perception that their vote individually will not lead to altering the election. Through this logic, Chandra displays that there is an incentive for people to organize for casting their vote within this context because, even if the one does not benefit from this vote individually, their collective vote may allow this group some access to favoritism from the candidate if they win thus establishing greater value in their collective votes. Furthermore, the candidate has an incentive to provide benefits to groups for their vote because an individual method of distributing jobs and services may create conflict in which providing a good to one voter may deprive another voter of that same good; therefore, a group method of distribution both allows for less conflict and greater insurance for the voter that the candidate will follow through on their end. To gain access to a salient group that desires jobs and services to target as well as establish credibility among that group, candidates often use their own ethnic identity, or coethnics, as a targeted community. Furthermore, the history of colonialism within most African countries means that ethnic identity tends to be more salient and available for candidates&#x27; access through appeals to shared ethnicity.

=== Ethnic Voting and Composition of Region ===
Ethnic favoritism in Ghana has been shown to be a method of gaining votes; however, the effectiveness among voters may vary between diverse and homogeneous communities. While not conducted in Ghana, research in sub-Saharan Africa has found that community investments are significantly more likely to occur in which there are more homogeneous communities. This displays how communities largely composed of one ethnicity may be benefiting from ethnic voting at the local level. The allocation of public goods to a homogeneous area is claimed to be a direct result of ethnic favoritism. While examining how people in Ghana vote within homogeneous, rural communities versus more diverse communities, another study finds support for this theory in that more homogeneous communities are more likely to vote for the party that supports their ethnicity. Furthermore, when there are ethnic minorities within a homogeneous and rural community, they are more likely to vote for the opposition party or their non-coethnic. The researcher explains this as voting based on the mutual benefit of targeted public goods. In this example, minorities within this homogeneous and rural community would equally benefit from the public goods placed in their area as the majority. Therefore, the minority is more likely to advocate for this candidate even though they do not specifically favor their ethnic identity. In contrast, other researchers argue that minority groups within these communities vote along non-coethnic lines due to voter intimidation. This is supported by observing how voting among these minorities for non-coethnic candidates does not vary between locations that have public goods and those that do not. Another researcher&#x27;s findings display how the choice of voting by ethnicity may depend also on public versus private goods. Similarly, another researcher finds that homogeneous communities are more likely to vote for the candidate that supports their ethnic identity and minorities within those ethnically homogeneous communities are more likely to support the opposition party because they are more likely to obtain access to public goods that the homogeneous community receives. Additionally, this study also finds that diverse and urban communities often have less ethnic voting when considering public goods. However, this study also finds that ethnic minorities are more likely to have an expectation that they will receive private goods if they are within poor communities, even if they are the ethnic minority of a community.

Additionally, research shows the ethnic voting at the local level in Ghana may have greater implications for national elections. For example, ethnic voting towards the presidency may depend on the amount of clientelism taking place for local elections. This theory, &quot;reverse coattails&quot;, supports the idea that clientelism surrounding ethnicity at the local level incentivizes individuals to participate at the party level thus aligning them with the party of a presidential candidate that their local official supports. Therefore, the support that local officials gain through co-ethnic clientelism also creates support for the executive candidate in the same party.

=== Implications of Ethnic Voting ===
Research has also displayed that the ethnic association created within politics may cause greater conflict and implicit biases between ethnic groups. Because candidates have mobilized ethnic groups through clientelist practices, ethnic groups create stronger ties to their ethnicity around times of competitive elections. By examining how people define themselves (by ethnicity, language, economic status, etc.), one cross-national study found data that when elections are closer and more competitive, it is more likely that people will identify with the ethnic category associated with their ethnicity. This supports the idea that ethnic identity is largely bound to politics because it has historically been used as a political tool. In Ghana, this theory has been supported by studying the microeconomic interactions between people of different ethnic groups. After collecting data on the price of taxis in a field experiment at various time points around an election, the study found that non-coethnics were charged more, on average, than non-ethnics. However, at election time, non-coethnics that were affiliated with an opposing political party (non-copartisans) were charged even more, while non-coethnics affiliated with the same party (copartisans) were charged less. Thus, when ethnic groups are nested in political parties, it can reduce discrimination between ethnic groups within a party but exacerbate discrimination between ethnic groups affiliated with opposing parties.

=== Alternative Opinions ===
Although these studies argue that ethnic voting is prevalent in Ghana due to the lack of political information available, other research indicates Ghanaian people do not vote primarily due to ethnicity. This research emphasizes that, although there is less information available to Ghanaian people, they are still more likely to choose a candidate based on past performance and policy plans. Therefore, there are articles indicating that the prevalence of clientelism and ethnic voting only account for a small portion of the population. Other research indicates that while clientelism is a signal of viability to voters in Ghana, it is not alone capable of &quot;buying&quot; one&#x27;s vote. Therefore, candidates are still reliant on the information they are able to obtain concerning past political performance to judge candidates&#x27; performances. This election organization in which gifts are necessary to be seen as a viable candidate is seen as manufactured by years of clientelist practices. As candidates from different parties competed to buy votes, this transaction became standard as a way of interacting with voters.

<doc id="1273037" wikidata="Q3160640" url="?curid=1273037" title="Jake Thackray">
<text>John Philip &quot;Jake&quot; Thackray (27 February 1938 – 24 December 2002) was an English singer-songwriter, poet, humourist and journalist. Best known in the late 1960s and early 1970s for his topical comedy songs performed on British television, his work ranged from satirical to bawdy to sentimental to pastoral, with a strong emphasis on storytelling, making him difficult to categorise.

Thackray sang in a lugubrious baritone voice, accompanying himself on a nylon-strung guitar in a style that was part classical, part jazz. His witty lyrics and clipped delivery, combined with his strong Yorkshire accent and the northern setting of many of his songs, led to his being described as the &quot;North Country Noël Coward&quot;, a comparison Thackray resisted, although he acknowledged his lyrics were in the English tradition of Coward and Flanders and Swann, &quot;who are wordy, funny writers&quot;. However, his tunes derived from the French &quot;chansonnier&quot; tradition: he claimed Georges Brassens as his greatest inspiration and he was also influenced by Jacques Brel and Charles Trenet. He also admired Randy Newman. He was admired by, and has influenced, many performers including Jarvis Cocker, Alex Turner, Benjamin Clementine, Mike Harding, Momus, Ralph McTell, Morrissey, and Jasper Carrott.

==Early life==
John Philip Thackray was born in Leeds, West Riding of Yorkshire, the son of Ernest Thackray, a policeman, and Ivy May Thackray, née Armitage. He was educated at the Jesuit St. Michael&#x27;s College in Leeds and St David&#x27;s College, a Catholic boarding seminary in Dolgellau, north-west Wales. He considered joining the priesthood but instead chose to study English Literature and Language at Durham University. After graduation he spent three years abroad teaching English, mainly in France – in Lille, in Brittany and in the Pyrenees – but also including six months in Algeria at the height of the war for independence in 1961–1962. During his time in France he had some of his poetry published and discovered the &quot;chansonnier&quot; tradition and in particular the work of Georges Brassens. &quot;I missed out on rock and all my influences were French,&quot; he would later say. In 1966, he had two brief columns – &quot;What is a Prof?&quot; and &quot;What is a Student?&quot; published in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Listener&quot; magazine.

==Musical career==
In 1963 Thackray returned to his native Yorkshire, teaching at Intake School in Rodley, Leeds. Teaching himself to play the guitar, he found that one way to get unruly pupils to take an interest in their studies was through his songs. This and performing in folk clubs led to appearances on local BBC radio programmes, which brought him to the attention of producer Norman Newell. Thackray recorded thirty demos with Newell, eleven of which were soon to be re-recorded and released as his debut album, &quot;The Last Will and Testament of Jake Thackray&quot;, in 1967. Many of the songs were given Newell’s trademark orchestral accompaniment in an attempt to broaden the album’s appeal beyond folk audiences. Its title track exhorted his friends to mark his death with a party, and then forget him. The album also included &quot;Lah-Di-Dah&quot;, in which a prospective bridegroom assures his bride he loves her so much that he will try to be nice to her dreadful family.

This in turn led to a BBC television slot, composing a weekly topical song for Bernard Braden&#x27;s consumer magazine programme &quot;Braden&#x27;s Week&quot;. He was not immediately popular — his first appearance in late 1968 provoked letters demanding his dismissal — but he eventually won over the audience. After &quot;Braden&#x27;s Week&quot; was cancelled in 1972, Thackray took up the same role on its successor show, &quot;That&#x27;s Life!&quot;. In nearly thirty years of performing he would make over a thousand radio and TV appearances, including slots on &quot;The David Frost Show&quot; and &quot;Frost Over America&quot;, and his own show, &quot;Jake&#x27;s Scene&quot;, on ITV.

In 1968, he married Sheila Marian Clarke-Irons, a 21-year-old student. His second album, &quot;Jake&#x27;s Progress&quot;, was recorded at Abbey Road Studios while the Beatles put the finishing touches to their &quot;Abbey Road&quot; album next door. Released in 1969, it abandoned the orchestral arrangements of its predecessor for a small acoustic band. It included the song &quot;The Blacksmith and the Toffee Maker&quot;, which Thackray adapted from a story in Laurie Lee&#x27;s &quot;Cider with Rosie&quot;. He began recording a new album in 1970, but these recordings were scrapped. In 1971 he released &quot;Live Performance&quot;, a live recording of 14 songs from his 1970 performance at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London (an expanded, 29-song double CD of the same performance would be released in 2006).

A third studio album, &quot;Bantam Cock&quot;, followed in 1972. Its title track became a folk standard and was covered by folk singer Fred Wedlock, folk group the Corries and comedian Jasper Carrott among others. Other songs included &quot;Isabel Makes Love upon National Monuments&quot;, &quot;Sister Josephine&quot;, and &quot;Brother Gorilla&quot;, an English adaptation of Georges Brassens&#x27; &quot;Le Gorille&quot;. In 1973 he opened for Brassens when he performed at the inauguration of the Sherman Theatre in Cardiff, which he would describe as the high spot of his career.

After &quot;Bantam Cock&quot; Thackray&#x27;s television appearances continued, but his recording career stalled. A compilation album, &quot;The Very Best of Jake Thackray&quot;, was released in 1975. His final studio album, &quot;On Again! On Again!&quot;, appeared in 1977. Its title track, a comedic, long-winded tirade about women who talk too much, would see Thackray accused of misogyny, but the album also included &quot;The Hair of the Widow of Bridlington&quot;, a song of female self-determination in the face of social disapproval. It also featured two more Brassens adaptations, &quot;Isabella&quot; (based on Brassens&#x27; &quot;Marinette&quot;) and &quot;Over to Isobel&quot; (based on &quot;Je rejoindrai ma belle&quot;). The same year he published a book of lyrics, &quot;Jake&#x27;s Progress&quot;, illustrated by Bill Tidy.

From the late 1970s, he had made most of his living on the live circuit, touring in Europe, North America and the Far East, but in 1981 he returned to television with &quot;Jake Thackray and Songs&quot;, a six-part series on BBC2 featuring Thackray and guests, including Richard and Linda Thompson and Ralph McTell, performing in a variety of venues. An album of the same name, recorded live at the Stables Theatre, Wavendon, Milton Keynes, as part of the recordings for the TV show, followed. A BBC-licensed DVD of Jake Thackray and Songs was released in 2014. Thackray&#x27;s last release during his life was a compilation, &quot;Lah-Di-Dah&quot;, released in 1991.

Although he gave up teaching for show business, Thackray did not really like being what he called &quot;a performing dick&quot;. He was uncomfortable with big audiences, and favoured pubs and community halls as performance venues in preference to grander ones such as the London Palladium (although he appeared there in a Royal Variety Performance). He became disillusioned with stage life. He is recorded as saying &quot;I&#x27;d never liked the stage much and I was turning into a performing man, a real Archie Rice [the hack music hall comic in John Osborne&#x27;s &quot;The Entertainer&quot;], so I cancelled gigs and pulled out&quot;. He was plagued by a self-doubt and a breakdown in confidence that Ralph McTell describes as &quot;catastrophic&quot;. His style of work was also falling out of fashion: his literate, witty lyrics and tales of rural Yorkshire had little resonance in the punk and Thatcher years, folk audiences had lost interest in contemporary song and, in the days of alternative comedy, his bawdy humour was deemed sexist and outdated. He ultimately gave up performing in the early 1990s and turned to journalism: for four years he wrote a weekly column for the &quot;Yorkshire Post&quot;.

==Retirement and death==
In the 1990s, Thackray withdrew to his home in Monmouth, South Wales, where he had settled with his family in the late 1960s. Beset by health and financial problems: he had become an alcoholic and was declared bankrupt in 2000. He had always been an observant Roman Catholic and became increasingly religious in his later years, limiting his musical activities to performing the Angelus at his local church. He died of heart failure on 24 December 2002, at the age of 64, leaving his widow, Sheila, from whom he was separated, and three sons: Bill, Sam and Tom.

==Revival in interest==
In May 2002, a group of fans formed the Jake Thackray Project with the intention of making more of Thackray&#x27;s work available to the public. With Thackray&#x27;s cooperation, the project team, led by record producer David Harris, received permission from EMI to produce a double CD of 42 songs not on any then-available release, limited to 200 copies, which was released in November 2002 with cover art by Bill Tidy. After Thackray&#x27;s death the following month, EMI consented to a further edition of 100 copies. This revival of interest led to the release of two mass market CDs the following year: &quot;The Very Best of Jake Thackray&quot; on EMI, and &quot;The Jake Thackray Collection&quot; on HMV. The Jake Thackray Project went on to release a remastered live recording (the CD &quot;Live in Germany&quot;), and two DVDs: the privately recorded &quot;Live at the Unicorn&quot; (2009) and the BBC-licensed &quot;Jake Thackray and Songs&quot; (2014). A musical written by Barnsley-born poet Ian McMillan based on Thackray&#x27;s songs and their characters, &quot;Sister Josephine Kicks the Habit&quot;, premiered in 2005 and toured the north of England. A rewrite by Alan Plater was due to tour the UK in 2007, but was put on hold following the death of executive producer Ian Watson. In 2014 Jake Thackray was featured on the BBC Radio Four &#x27;Great Lives&#x27; Series.

2006 saw a major retrospective. EMI released an expanded, 29-song double CD edition of &quot;Live Performance&quot;, and &quot;Jake in a Box&quot;, a 4-CD box set containing Thackray&#x27;s four studio albums and six singles in their entirety, plus 25 unused tracks recorded in the &quot;Last Will and Testament&quot; sessions in 1967, eleven songs recorded for the abandoned album in 1970 and a handful of other rarities. Comedian and writer Victor Lewis-Smith produced a television documentary, &quot;Jake on the Box&quot;, for the BBC. In 2014, The Jake Thackray Project released a DVD of &quot;Jake Thackray and Songs&quot;, by arrangement with BBC music, featuring all of Thackray&#x27;s performances from the television series, along with songs by three of the guest artists, Alex Glasgow, Pete Scott and Ralph McTell. In 2020, attempts to create a one-man show celebrating his life and work — accompanied by excerpts of his performances — formed a subplot in the mockumentary &quot;Meet the Richardsons&quot; in which Jon Richardson expresses his admiration for Thackray&#x27;s life and works.

<doc id="1273043" wikidata="Q4745288" url="?curid=1273043" title="American Tune">
<text>&quot;American Tune&quot; is a song by the American singer-songwriter Paul Simon. It was the third single from his third studio album, &quot;There Goes Rhymin&#x27; Simon&quot; (1973), released on Columbia Records. The song, a meditation on the American experience, is based on the melody of the hymn &quot;O Sacred Head, Now Wounded&quot; and bears a striking resemblance to JS Bach’s “Erkenne mich, mein Hüter“. The song reached number 35 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

==Lyrics==
In an interview with Tom Moon in 2011, Paul Simon was asked about political references in his songs, and he said: &quot;I don’t write overtly political songs, although &#x27;American Tune&#x27; comes pretty close, as it was written just after Nixon was elected.&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;Billboard&quot; described it as a &quot;discourse on inner security while being far from home.&quot; &quot;Cash Box&quot; called it a &quot;gorgeous, haunting, highly lyrical track&quot; and said that the &quot;soft vocal performance is heightened by sweet string section.&quot; &quot;Record World&quot; said that it &quot;should touch the hearts and ears of many Americans&quot; with a &quot;beautiful melody wrapped around meaningful lyrics.&quot;

It is ranked number 262 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

Years after the song&#x27;s release, the Los Angeles Times wrote &quot;It does not ring with the loud anger that runs through our time. It is mournful, as if unspooling in the candlelight of a day’s end,&quot; and praised the song for its tender, timeless nature, noting it as a &quot;visceral [reminder] of our history.&quot;

==Music==
The tune is based on the melody of the hymn &quot;O Sacred Head, Now Wounded&quot; (German: &quot;O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden,&quot; text by Paul Gerhardt). The common name for this hymn tune is &quot;Passion Chorale.&quot; The well-known hymn is itself a reworking of an earlier secular song, &quot;Mein G&#x27;müt ist mir verwirret,&quot; composed by Hans Leo Hassler.

==Personnel==
* Paul Simon – vocals, acoustic guitar 
* Bob James – keyboards
* Bob Cranshaw – bass guitar
* Grady Tate – drums
* Del Newman – string arrangement

==Live performances==
&quot;American Tune&quot; became a concert favorite, both for Simon and in reunion concerts with Simon&#x27;s former singing partner, Art Garfunkel. The song appears on several of Simon&#x27;s solo live albums and on Simon and Garfunkel&#x27;s post-breakup live albums, most famously &quot;The Concert in Central Park&quot;. A live version with a string quartet appeared on Simon&#x27;s 1977 album &quot;Greatest Hits, Etc.&quot; Simon performed the song live on November 18, 2008, during the airing of &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;, and on September 11, 2015, to close out the last show of the first week of &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;. In his surprise appearance at the 2022 Newport Folk Festival, Simon introduced Rhiannon Giddens to sing the song, with lyrics adjusted to include the lines, &quot;We didn&#x27;t come here on the Mayflower / We came on a ship in a blood red moon&quot;. Giddens backed the song with banjo, while Simon accompanied on guitar. 

==Cover versions==
The song has been covered by many artists, notably Rhiannon Giddens, Willie Nelson, Eva Cassidy, Ann Wilson, Shawn Colvin, Allen Toussaint, Gretchen Peters, Indigo Girls, Starland Vocal Band, Dave Matthews, Trey Anastasio, John Boutté, Keane, Glen Phillips, Jerry Douglas, Kurt Elling, Curtis Stigers, Darrell Scott, Storyhill, and Stacey Kent. Mandy Patinkin covered the song in Yiddish on his 1998 album &quot;Mamaloshen&quot;.

In 2017, Elvis Costello released a non-album single version under the pseudonym &quot;The Imposter&quot;. In 2020, Dave Matthews performed &quot;American Tune&quot; for &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2023, Rufus Wainwright performed &quot;American Tune&quot; on his tour with the Amsterdam Sinfonietta through the Netherlands.

Simon&#x27;s own unfinished demo recording, with incomplete lyrics, was released as a bonus track on the 2004 CD reissue of &quot;There Goes Rhymin&#x27; Simon&quot;.

==Use and references in popular culture==
The song has been featured in the television series &quot;The Wonder Years&quot;, and used as the opening and closing song to Ken Burns&#x27; documentary &quot;The Statue of Liberty&quot;. A cover version by Crooked Still was used for the closing credits of the final episode of the 2022 series The English.

Simon performed the song at the pre-inaugural concert for Jimmy Carter, held at the Kennedy Center in Washington on January 19, 1977, the evening before Carter&#x27;s swearing-in as president.

In late October 2008, the progressive advocacy group Progressive Future produced a 60-second television ad featuring &quot;American Tune&quot; in support of Senator Barack Obama&#x27;s presidential campaign. The &quot;what&#x27;s gone wrong&quot; line underscored a photo of President George W. Bush and Obama&#x27;s opponent John McCain standing close together.

<text>A lattice tower or truss tower is a freestanding vertical framework tower. This construction is widely used in transmission towers carrying high-voltage electric power lines, in radio masts and towers (a self-radiating tower or as a support for aerials) and in observation towers. Its advantage is good shear strength at a much lower weight than a tower of solid construction would have as well as lower wind resistance.

In structural engineering, the term &quot;lattice tower&quot; is used for a freestanding structure, while a &quot;lattice mast&quot; is a guyed mast supported by guy lines. Lattices of triangular (three-sided) cross-section are most common, particularly in North America. Square (four-sided) lattices are also widely used and are most common in Eurasia. A lattice towers is often designed as either a space frame or a hyperboloid structure.

Before 1940, they were used as radio transmission towers especially for short and medium wave. Occasionally lattice towers consisting of wood were utilized. The tallest wooden lattice tower was at Mühlacker, Germany. It had a height of and was built in 1934 and demolished in 1945. Most wood lattice towers were demolished before 1960. In Germany, the last big radio towers consisting of wood were the transmission towers of the Golm transmitter and the transmitter Ismaning. They were demolished in 1979 and 1983 respectively.

The tallest free-standing lattice tower is the Tokyo Skytree, with a height of . The Petronius Compliant Tower is the tallest supported lattice tower at , being partially submerged. The city most renowned for lattice towers is Cincinnati, Ohio, which features four towers above 900 feet in height. Tokyo is the only other city in the world that has more than one above that height.

The majority of the tallest steel lattice towers in the world are actually built in water and used as oil platforms. These structures are usually built in large pieces on land, most commonly in Texas or Louisiana, and then moved by barge to their final resting place. Since a large portion of these towers is underwater, the official height of such structures is often held in dispute. The steel lattice truss for these structures, known as jackets in the oil industry, are typically far more robust and reinforced than their land-based counterparts, sometimes weighing more than 50,000 tons as is the case for the Bullwinkle and Baldpate platforms, whereas tall (above 1,000 feet) land-based lattice towers range from a high of 10,000 tons as is the case in the Eiffel Tower to as low as a few hundred tons. They are built to a higher standard to support the weight of the oil platforms built on top of them and because of the forces to which they are subjected. As a result, the cost to build these structures can run into the hundreds of millions. These costs are justified due to the resulting oil and gas revenues, whereas land-based towers have a much lower stream of revenue and therefore the capital costs of towers are typically much less.


== Timeline of world&#x27;s tallest lattice tower ==
Since end of the 19th century, tall lattice towers were built. Lattice towers have even held the absolute height record. They are among the tallest free-standing architectural structures and hold a number of national records, such as the tallest free-standing or even overall tallest structure of a country.

<text>The Best Practicable Environmental Option (BPEO) is the idea that there is a unique, supremely beneficial—or least environmentally damaging—method of disposing wastes in a cost-effective manner, in both the short- and long-term.

== Definition ==
According to the 12th Report of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution (RCEP), the BPEO is defined as “the outcome of a systematic and consultative decision- making procedure which emphasizes the protection and conservation of the environment across land, air and water”. The BPEO goal, curated by the United Kingdom&#x27;s RCEP, identifies and evaluates proposed disposal methods using environmental and economic auditing tools that ultimately aim to provide environmentally and economically viable solutions; solutions that may be easily coordinated with the laws, institutions and policies governing the control of pollution.

Philosophically, the BPEO concept is similar to the practice of sustainable development. The rationale behind the BPEO is “polluter-orientated—not policy-, planning-, or environmentally-, directed”—an ideology that is intended to facilitate the comparison of disposal options by associating each practice with its respective environmental impacts. This comparison establishes the opportunity to change current disposal practices and implement less environmentally harmful options. From a criterion standpoint, the BPEO must meet certain standards of practicality for successful implementation in legislative and social aspects—otherwise, the BPEO would only be the best ‘environmental’ option.

Although the BPEO is determined by the previously defined criteria, the concept emphasizes that the waste hierarchy—reduce, reuse, recycle, recovery and disposal—cannot be applied without taking into consideration the environmental, economic and social impacts associated with the options considered, given that the BPEO must be economically and socially sustainable as well.

== Development ==

=== History ===
Early derivatives of BPEO formed due to the notable concern and focus on environmental auditing—as such, to understand the development of BPEO, it is critical to understand the origins of environmental auditing. Environmental auditing was originally developed as a business management tool to address concerns about compliance with legislation and regulations. Further, “environmental auditing provides environmental performance[s]” and has the capability to identify “any negative environmental impacts” and evaluate “the opportunities to change current practices in order to improve that performance”. For that reason, environmental auditing tools are necessary for the establishment of the BPEO. However, environmental auditing was highly regarded long before the creation of the BPEO—in fact, this auditing mechanism played a primary role in the establishment of BPEO&#x27;s predecessor, BPM, or “best practicable means”. Additionally, “BATNEEC”, also known as “BAT”, or the “best available technology not entailing excessive cost” is a concept closely associated with BPEO—and, unsurprisingly, derives from the early BPM construct. The ideology behind the BPEO is based largely on the basis of its early counterparts, but is intended to harmoniously merge the primary concerns behind BPM, BAT, and other like-minded concepts—environmental, economic, and social concerns.

=== Reason for Establishment ===
The concept of the BPEO was introduced by the RCEP due its identification of the “need for a more unified approach to regulatory control over pollutant discharges than that which prevailed at the time”. Prior to the development of the BPEO, “separate and effectively independent controls over the disposals of waste to air, water and land” had been in effect; the UK, however, desired a more uniform approach to waste management. Further, the RCEP sought to identify the “optimum overall environmental solution for any given waste stream”—and so the BPEO came to be, with the intention to direct pollution &quot;to the medium where the least damage would be done”. At the time of creation, a primary reason for the development of the BPEO was to develop a “systematic audit trail” that would allow for transparent decision making. This audit trail involved the development of the BPEO&#x27;s seven key stages: (1) “define the objective”, (2) “generate options”, (3) “evaluate the options”, (4) “summarise and present the evaluation”, (5) “select the BPEO”, (6) “review the BPEO”, and (7) “implement and monitor”. The development of these stages was a notable event in the early history of the BPEO concept, as this procedural development extended the idea beyond its early focus, pollution control, and prompted the expansion of the scope to include “all projects affecting the environment”—while simultaneously expanding the reasoning behind the establishment of the BPEO concept to include the need for broader considerations of environmental factors, as well as the demand for the establishment of more cost-effective and socially feasible waste management options.

In the simplest of terms, the BPEO idea was established as an attempt to institute a method that could determine the soundest waste disposal practices using a holistic approach. With respect to the reasoning for the development of the BPEO, it is critically important to note that the UK&#x27;s RCEP recognized the demand for a structured concept, rather than a rigid decision making tool—and, therefore, put forth the BPEO process as a “framework concept, linked to an underlying systematic process” as opposed to a precise, regulated tool. A notable appeal of the BPEO concept resides within the fundamentals of the approach—as it is one that is holistic in nature and allows for the identification of a “preferred overall strategy” in which the environment is considered wholly, rather than atomistically, and does not demand for strict optimization of the processes. For example, the flexibility of this framework concept is exemplified by the fact that two distinct locations may have different BPEO&#x27;s for the same type of waste.

Stakeholder involvement—or the participation of “anyone with an active interest in waste management”—is possibility the most obvious, publicly understood driving factor behind the establishment and identification of the BPEO. The involvement and encouragement of those individuals interested in practical, environmentally sound waste management processes is said to have made a significant impact on the RCEP&#x27;s decision to curate the BPEO.

== Implementation ==
The BPEO is determined by identifying and analyzing factors for the management of the waste in question. Key variables include the environmental impact, cost, compliance and technical viability arising from the different types of waste management methods identified. Since the BPEO may be different for the same type of waste originating from differing locations, the RCEP developed a simple four-step universal procedure, shown as follows, that allows for the determination of the BPEO, relative to the area in the scope of the assessment: “(1) Researching current waste types, amounts and waste disposal routes, (2) Analyzing potential waste management routes, (3) Identifying, and where possible quantifying, impacts relating to cost, legislation, global and local environment, [and] (4) Providing the tools and guidance to help waste producers to identify their BPEO”.

Of primary importance to the determination and implementation of the BPEO are the potential environmental impacts, increased cost-effectiveness, and social feasibility. In determining the BPEO, identifying and analyzing waste management options is a critical part of the process. Additionally, given the framework nature of the BPEO concept, the flexibility afforded allows for a BPEO determination that is unique to the type of waste, location, and any other relevant data points—and allows for the specifics of the analysis to incorporate as many strategic tools or analysis methods as desired.

For example, the Montrose Port Authority (MPA), in its “Maintenance Dredging BPEO” report, used the Waste Hierarchy Assessment (WHA) to determine the BPEO. After considering multiple options, it was determined that the current method of disposal—identified during a previous BPEO analysis—has remained the BPEO. Specifically, for the MPA, the decision to have the current disposal method remain at a licensed disposal ground was determined after identifying and analyzing a wealth of environmental, economic, social factors that led to the following conclusion—altering the disposal method, specifically to a means of land-based disposal in a terrestrial landfill, would be cost-prohibitive, impractical, and not environmentally sustainable.  In this particular instance, the current BPEO at the time of review was determined to remain the BPEO, as all other options considered were determined to be less viable options. The Maintenance Dredging BPEO determination by the Montrose Port Authority serves as a prominent example of the importance of determining the BPEO using the herein described process—as the BPEO framework allows for the determination of the best, most practicable, environmentally conscious, cost effective waste management option possible.

== Critique ==
The ideology behind the BPEO expresses concern for social improvements—in addition to the focus on economic viability, a reduction in overall resource consumption, and its associated environmental impacts—though, in reality, the methodology and practical resources used to determine the BPEO, by way of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and economic auditing tools, rely on strategic tools with little regard for the determining or monitoring of the practicality of social impacts. In fact, doctoral candidates from the Open University conducted a BPEO review that reinforces the aforementioned thinking—their findings support “the idea that LCA would allow a systematic examination of a waste management option and its environmental impacts both up-stream and down-stream of the waste disposal unit” though “there is little, if any, literature that considers the combination of LCA with financial and social modelling techniques” in determining the BPEO. These scholars go on to highlight the importance of considering the “international obligations, the national policy framework, and policy guidance at a local level” to effectively determine the BPEO—noting the fact that “none of these [social] factors can be considered by a financial model or LCA alone”.

<text>Jurgis Baltrušaitis (2 May 1873 – 3 January 1944) was a Lithuanian symbolist poet and translator, who wrote in Lithuanian and Russian and was an exponent of iconology. He was the father of art historian and critic Jurgis Baltrušaitis Jr.

==Writer==

Baltrušaitis was born to a family of farmers in Paantvardys village near Jurbarkas, which was then under Imperial Russian rule. In 1885, he entered Kaunas gymnasium, and graduated in 1893; he then entered the Faculty of Physical and Mathematical Sciences at Moscow University. At the same time he attended lectures in the Faculty of History and Philology.

From 1895 onwards Baltrušaitis began to take part in editing Moscow-based literary magazines, and he began to work in Russian. He joined the Symbolist movement, and, in association with Sergei Polyakov, set up the publishing house &quot;Scorpio&quot;, which published the chief Russian Symbolist magazines such as &quot;Vesy&quot; and &quot;Severnyie Tzvety&quot; as well as collections of Russian Symbolist poets.

Baltrušaitis published three collections of poetry in Russian, and another three in Lithuanian. Authors he translated into Russian translations include Henrik Ibsen, Oscar Wilde, August Strindberg, Knut Hamsun and Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio.

==Politician==

Between 1900 and 1914, Baltrušaitis lived in Italy and Norway and spent much time traveling in other countries in Western Europe. During World War I and the subsequent Russian Revolution he was in Russia, where he actively participated in the Lithuanian political struggle for independence. In 1919 he was elected President of the Russian Union of Writers, and was known for his efforts to help and rescue many writers and intellectuals during the first years of the Bolshevik regime.

After Lithuania regained independence in 1918, Baltrušaitis was appointed Lithuania&#x27;s ambassador to Russia in 1920 and held this position until 1939. In 1932 he was honored with a doctorate by Vytautas Magnus University in Kaunas. In 1939, Baltrušaitis was appointed a counselor of the Lithuanian embassy in Paris. Following the annexation of Lithuania by the Soviet Union, his son, Jurgis Baltrušaitis Jr., an art historian and art critic, served as a diplomat for the Lithuanian diplomatic service which continued to represent Lithuanian interests in some Western countries. Baltrušaitis Sr. died in Paris in January 1944; he is buried at Montrouge Cemetery.

<text>The Tour métallique de Fourvière (&quot;Metallic tower of Fourvière&quot;), a landmark of Lyon, France, is a steel framework tower which bears a striking resemblance to the Eiffel Tower, which predates it by three years. With a height of , previously before installation of the TV broadcasting antenna, and weighing 210 tons, the &quot;metallic tower&quot; was built between 1892 and 1894.

During the Exposition universelle of 1914 in Lyon it had a restaurant and an elevator capable of taking 22 people up to the summit. Although used as an observation tower until November 1, 1953, nowadays it serves as a television tower and is not accessible to the public. At 372 metres (1220&#x27;), it is the highest point in Lyon.

<doc id="1273079" wikidata="Q4892601" url="?curid=1273079" title="Bermuda Agreement">
<text>The Bermuda Agreement (formally Agreement between the government of the United Kingdom and the government of the United States relating to Air Services between their respective Territories), reached in 1946 by American and British negotiators in Bermuda, was an early bilateral air transport agreement regulating civil air transport. It established a precedent for the signing of approximately 3,000 other such agreements between countries. The Agreement was replaced by the Bermuda II Agreement, which was signed in 1977 and effective in 1978.

==Background==

During World War II, transatlantic air service between Britain and America was limited to Boeing 314 flying boat service between Baltimore and Foynes, which Pan American World Airways had begun in July 1939. British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) also flew the route using three Boeing 314s purchased from Pan Am.

The Bermuda Agreement arose in the wake of the Chicago Conference of 1944, where the United States and United Kingdom disagreed about economic control of international air transport. The US and UK had generally agreed on the first two freedoms of the air (overflight and landings for repair/refueling) but the UK and several other countries refused to accept the US position on the third, fourth and fifth freedoms regarding the handling of passenger and cargo traffic. Specifically, the US sought the freedom for its carriers to determine capacity and frequencies on international routes, while the UK sought predetermined routes and an equal division of capacity between the two nations&#x27; carriers on those routes. Britain had lost much of its air fleet in the course of World War II and was reluctant to place itself in full competition with the stronger American air fleet.

Prior to the Bermuda Agreement, the United States signed bilateral aviation agreements with several other European countries (Ireland, Norway, Sweden and Denmark), and had signed a multilateral Transport Agreement with several European and Latin American countries, but service to and from the United Kingdom had to be negotiated with the British government on an ad hoc basis. As of late 1945, the UK had limited transatlantic traffic by the US to 14 services per week, 500 seats per week and a minimum fare of $375.

In July 1945, the US government granted Pan Am, Trans World Airlines (TWA) and American Export Airlines (shortly thereafter acquired by American Airlines and renamed American Overseas Airlines) the right to operate transatlantic service. American began its Douglas DC-4 service between New York and Bournemouth that October. Pan Am announced its own DC-4 service in October 1945 at prices less than 50% of the previous flying boat fares, which led the British government to pressure both Pan Am and the US government to back away from what Britain described as a &quot;wholly uneconomic proposition.&quot;

The US and UK governments agreed in late 1945 to meet and discuss the terms of a bilateral aviation agreement. Bermuda was chosen to host the meeting due to its location between the two countries and isolation from their respective governments. In a sign of the rapidly advancing technology of the time, the British delegation arrived in January by Boeing 314 flying boats, and departed in February by Lockheed 049 Constellation pressurized landplanes.

==Key terms==
Unlike the existing bilateral and multilateral aviation agreements, the Bermuda Agreement defined specific routes on which each countries&#x27; carriers could fly, with the right to pick up or discharge international traffic (but no cabotage rights) at any point along the routes:

* British carriers:
** London – New York – San Francisco – Honolulu / Midway / Wake / Guam / Manila – Singapore / Hong Kong
** London – New York – New Orleans – Mexico
** London – New York – Cuba – Jamaica / Panama – Colombia / Ecuador / Peru / Chile
* United States carriers: 
** US points – London – Netherlands / Germany / Scandinavia / Russia
** US points – London – Belgium – Central Europe – Near East – India
** Honolulu – Hong Kong – China / India
** Honolulu – Hong Kong – Singapore – Netherlands East Indies

The inclusion of many fifth freedom routes (beyond the United States and British Isles) reflected the fact that many territories such as Hong Kong, Singapore and India were still British colonies at the time the agreement was signed, and that many third countries were eager for air service and willing to provide rights to British and American carriers without restrictions.

As a compromise on the capacity issue, the Bermuda Agreement provided for equitable principles that &quot;there shall be a fair and equal opportunity for the carriers of the two nations to operate on any route between their respective territories (as defined in the Agreement) covered by the Agreement and its Annex&quot; and that &quot;in the operation by the air carriers of either Government of the trunk services described in the Annex to the Agreement, the interest of the air carriers of the other Government shall be taken into consideration so as not to affect unduly the services which the latter provides.&quot;

Fares were made subject to regulatory approval by authorities in each country or by the International Air Transport Association, effectively giving the IATA immunity from US antitrust law, which immunity remained in effect on North Atlantic routes until 1979.

==Operations under the agreement==
===1940s===

Pan Am took delivery of the Lockheed 749 Constellation in June 1947 and began its &quot;round-the-world&quot; route with eastbound stops in New York, Gander, Shannon, London, Istanbul, Dhahran, Karachi, Calcutta, Bangkok, Manila, Shanghai, Tokyo, Guam, Wake, Midway, Honolulu and San Francisco, taking advantage of Bermuda Agreement fifth freedom rights.

Newfoundland, an essential refueling stop on any transatlantic air route in the 1940s, was part of Britain at the time the Bermuda Agreement was signed. In 1949, following its accession as a Canadian province, the United States signed an agreement with Canada to provide for fifth freedom rights to and from Gander.

===1950s===

Pan Am acquired AOA from American Airlines in 1950, concentrating the US-UK air travel market to three carriers: Pan Am, TWA and BOAC.

BOAC, still Britain&#x27;s sole transatlantic carrier, sought to compete with Pan Am&#x27;s &quot;round the world&quot; service by offering an &quot;all-red&quot; route from Britain to Australia via Canada, but bilateral agreements between the UK and these countries stalled in the early 1950s. BOAC proceeded to open a London-Chicago route in May 1954, with the intention to extend the service to San Francisco and Tokyo. The San Francisco extension was not realized until 1957, and US government approval for the Tokyo service did not come until 1959 due to objections by Northwest Airlines.

BOAC introduced de Havilland Comet jet service on the London-New York route in 1958. TWA began jet service on the New York-London-Frankfurt route in 1959.

===1960s===

The United States began to exercise an even more dominant position in the transatlantic market during the 1960s. One key issue was that Pan Am and TWA began to use the hub and spoke system to feed passengers from many US destinations through a transatlantic &quot;gateway&quot; and on to Europe, giving the US carriers an advantage in serving secondary markets. Partly as a result of this competitive pressure, the market share of BOAC on transatlantic routes fell from 37.8% in 1961–62 to 30.9% by 1966–67.

===1970s===

The British government added a privately owned carrier, British Caledonian, to the transatlantic market in 1973, with flights from London&#x27;s Gatwick Airport to New York and Los Angeles. BCal was forced to exit the market in 1976 after the British government determined that competition was not improving Britain&#x27;s overall market share.

==Termination==
In 1976, the British government announced its intention to renounce the agreement, beginning the negotiation of the Bermuda II Agreement which became effective in 1978. Although the UK initially sought an equal division of capacity between UK and US carriers, the final Bermuda II agreement largely preserved the liberal capacity provisions of Bermuda I.

The Bermuda agreements were replaced in two stages on 30 March 2008, and 24 June 2010, by the EU–US Open Skies Agreement between the European Union (representing 25 European countries) and the United States, providing for an Open Skies regime even more liberal than Bermuda I.

==Effect on other aviation agreements==

Both the United States and the United Kingdom made the Bermuda Agreement their model for bilateral agreements with other countries until Bermuda II. The only major exception during this era was the 1966 agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union, which designated Pan Am and Aeroflot as the operating carriers from each country and left commercial details of service to the airlines&#x27; prior agreement. Although most other agreements during this era followed the Bermuda I model, they tended to include fewer and fewer fifth and sixth freedom rights (traffic rights to and from third countries) as time went on, as the increased range of aircraft made such rights less necessary. The general principles of the Bermuda Agreement were also followed by other countries, such as Canada in its various bilateral agreements.

<text>Laura Jean Libbey (March 22, 1862 – October 25, 1924) was an American writer.

==Biography==
Libbey lived most of her life in Brooklyn, New York. Her parents were Thomas and Elizabeth Libbey. She began writing around age 20. Over the course of her career, she completed 82 novels.

Some of Libbey&#x27;s stories first appeared as serialized stories in papers such as &quot;The New York Family Story Paper&quot;, &quot;The Fireside Companion&quot;, and the &quot;New York Ledger&quot;. During the 1880s her stories were popular enough for Libbey to negotiate high paying exclusive contracts with specific papers. These serialized stories were later reprinted in dime novel format by publishers of cheap fiction such as George Munro, Arthur Westbrook, and John Lovell.

Over fifteen million copies of her books were published. According to &quot;The American Bookseller&quot;, Libbey&#x27;s 1889 &quot;The Pretty Young Girl&quot; was &quot;the hit of the season&quot; in selling 60,000 copies in thirty days. At one point, Libbey reported she was earning $60,000 a year, but this number may have been exaggerated.

Three of Libbey&#x27;s stories were made into films: &quot;When Love Grows Cold&quot; (1926), &quot;A Poor Girl&#x27;s Romance&quot; (1927), and &quot;In a Moment of Temptation&quot; (1928). Libbey also wrote 120 plays, many based on her previously published stories.

Known as the &quot;working-girl&quot; novelist, Libbey&#x27;s stories were romances about employed young women without family support. Her earliest stories (published in the 1880s) were moralistic and focused on the difficulties of factory work. The stories published in the 1890s and 1900s focused more on the process of finding an appropriate romantic partner.

According to Joyce Shaw Peterson, Libbey&#x27;s heroines show signs of being proto-feminists. They work for a living, they are spirited, they are proud, they have integrity. When abducted they often manage to run away on their own. However, their permanent safety always depends upon male protection. There is no female solidarity in Libbey&#x27;s stories, other women are jealous rivals for the attentions of men. Employment is an opportunity to find a wonderful husband, not a chance to find freedom and self-definition. Overall, Libbey&#x27;s stories were outside the feminist stream of the time which focused on economic independence.

Libbey also worked as an editor. From 1891 to 1894 she edited George Munro&#x27;s &quot;Fashion Bazaar&quot;. Her financial records indicate that she received $10,400 a year for her editorial work.

Supposedly Libbey&#x27;s mother forbade her from marrying. Two years after Libbey&#x27;s mother died in 1896 she married a Brooklyn lawyer by the name of Van Mater Stilwell. Libbey was 36 years old when she married.

Libbey died at her home in Park Slope on October 25, 1924, after complications from cancer surgery. She is buried in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn. Libbey&#x27;s papers are held by Rutgers University.

<doc id="1273087" wikidata="Q7605386" url="?curid=1273087" title="Steam shovel">
<text>A steam shovel is a large steam-powered excavating machine designed for lifting and moving material such as rock and soil. It is the earliest type of power shovel or excavator. Steam shovels played a major role in public works in the 19th and early 20th century, being key to the construction of railroads and the Panama Canal. The development of simpler, cheaper diesel, gasoline and electric shovels caused steam shovels to fall out of favor in the 1930s.

==History==

===Origins and development===
Grimshaw of Boulton &amp; Watt devised the first steam-powered excavator in 1796. In 1833 William Brunton patented another steam-powered excavator which he provided further details on in 1836. The steam shovel was invented by William Otis, who received a patent for his design in 1839. The first machines were known as &#x27;partial-swing&#x27;, since the boom could not rotate through 360 degrees. They were built on a railway chassis, on which the boiler and movement engines were mounted. The shovel arm and driving engines were mounted at one end of the chassis, which accounts for the limited swing. Bogies with flanged wheels were fitted, and power was taken to the wheels by a chain drive to the axles. Temporary rail tracks were laid by workers where the shovel was expected to work, and repositioned as required.

Steam shovels became more popular in the latter half of the nineteenth century. Originally configured with chain hoists, the advent of steel cable in the 1870s allowed for easier rigging to the winches.

Later machines were supplied with caterpillar tracks, obviating the need for rails.

The full-swing, 360° revolving shovel was developed in England in 1884, and became the preferred format for these machines.

===Growth and uses===

Expanding railway networks (in the US and the UK) fostered a demand for steam shovels. The extensive mileage of railways, and corresponding volume of material to be moved, forced the technological leap. As a result, steam shovels became commonplace. 
American manufacturers included the Marion Steam Shovel Company founded in 1884, the Bucyrus Company and the Erie Shovel Company, now owned by Caterpillar.

The booming cities in North America used shovels to dig foundations and basements for the early skyscrapers.

One hundred and two steam shovels worked in the decade-long dig of the Panama Canal across the Isthmus of Panama. Of these, seventy-seven were built by Bucyrus; the remainder were Marion shovels. These machines &#x27;moved mountains&#x27; in their labors. The shovel crews would race to see who could move the most dirt.

Steam shovels assisted mining operations: the iron mines of Minnesota, the copper mines of Chile and Montana, placer mines of the Klondike – all had earth-moving equipment. With the burgeoning open-pit mines – first in Bingham Canyon, Utah – shovels became prominent. The shovels removed hillsides. As a result, steam shovels were used globally from Australia to Russia to coal mines in China. Shovels were used for construction, road and quarry work.

Steam shovels became widely used in the 1920s in the road-building programs in North America. Thousands of miles of State Highways were built in this era, together with factories and many docks, ports, buildings, and grain elevators.

===Successors===
During the 1930s steam shovels were supplanted by simpler, cheaper diesel-powered excavating shovels that were the forerunners of those in use today. Open-pit mines were electrified at this time. Only after the Second World War, with the advent of robust high-pressure hydraulic hoses, did the more versatile hydraulic excavators take pre-eminence over the cable-hoisting winch shovels.

Many steam shovels remained at work on the railways of developing nations until diesel engines supplanted them. Most have since been scrapped.

Large, multi-ton mining shovels still use the cable-lift shovel arrangement. In the 1950s and 1960s, Marion Shovel built massive stripping shovels for coal operations in the Eastern US. Shovels of note were the Marion 360, the Marion 5900, and the largest shovel ever built, Marion 6360 &quot;The Captain&quot; – with a bucket – while Bucyrus constructed one of the most famous monsters: the Big Brutus, the largest still in existence. The &quot;GEM of Egypt&quot; (GEM standing for &quot;Giant Excavating Machine&quot; and Egypt referring to the Egypt Valley in Belmont County, eastern Ohio where it was first employed), which operated from 1967 to 1988, was of comparable size. It has since been dismantled. Although these big machines are still called &quot;steam shovels&quot;, they are more correctly known as &quot;power shovels&quot; since they use electricity to power their winches.

==Operation==


A steam shovel consists of:
* a bucket, usually with a toothed edge, to dig into the earth
* a &quot;dipper&quot; or &quot;dipper stick&quot; connecting the bucket to the boom
* a &quot;boom&quot; mounted on the rotating platform, supporting the dipper and its control wires
* a boiler
* a water tank and coal bunker
* steam engines and winches
* operator&#x27;s controls
* a platform on which everything is mounted
* wheels (or sometimes caterpillar tracks or railroad wheels)
* a house (on the platform) to contain and protect &#x27;the works&#x27;

The shovel has several individual operations: it can raise or luff the boom, extend the dipper stick with the boom or crowd engine, and raise or lower the dipper stick. Some shovels can rotate the platform on which the bulk of the machine is mounted on a turntable above its truck, similar to a modern excavator, while others, particularly those with longer bodies, have a turntable at the base of the boom, and rotate the boom.

When digging at a rock face, the operator simultaneously raises and extends the dipper stick to fill the bucket with material. When the bucket is full, the shovel is rotated to load a railway car or motor truck. The locking pin on the bucket flap is released and the load drops away. The operator lowers the dipper stick, the bucket mouth self-closes, the pin relocks automatically and the process repeats.

Steam shovels usually had at least a three-man crew: engineer, fireman and ground man. There was much jockeying to do to move shovels: rails and timber blocks to move; cables and block purchases to attach; chains and slings to rig; and so on. On soft ground, shovels used timber mats to help steady and level the ground. The early models were not self-propelled, rather they would use the boom to manoeuvre themselves.

==Preservation==

Most steam shovels have been scrapped, although a few reside in industrial museums and private collections.

===The Le Roy Marion===

The world&#x27;s largest intact steam shovel is a Marion machine, dating from either 1906 or 1911, located in Le Roy, New York. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008.

===Ruston Proctor Steam Navvy No 306===

Dating from 1909, this machine – Ruston&#x27;s called it a &#x27;crane navvy&#x27; – is the oldest surviving steam navvy in the world. It was originally used at a chalk pit at Arlesey, in Bedfordshire, England. After the pit was closed, the steam navvy was simply abandoned and &#x27;lost&#x27; as the pit became flooded with water. By the mid-1970s, the area had become a local beauty spot, known as &quot;The Blue Lagoon&quot; (from chemicals from the quarry colouring the water), and after long periods of drought, the top of the rusty navvy could be seen protruding from the water. Ruston &amp; Hornsby expert Ray Hooley heard of its existence, and organised the difficult task of rescuing it from the water-filled pit. Hooley arranged for its complete restoration to working order by apprentices at the Ruston-Bucyrus works. Subsequently it passed into the care of the Museum of Lincolnshire Life.
The museum was unable to make full use of the machine, and, not being stored under cover, its condition deteriorated.
In 2011, Ray Hooley donated the machine to the Vintage Excavator Trust at Threlkeld Quarry and Mining Museum in Cumbria. It was moved to the quarry in 2011, and (as of 2013) full restoration is once again under way.

===1923 Bucyrus Model 50-B===

Twenty-five Bucyrus Model 50-B steam shovels were sent to the Panama Canal to build bridges, roads, and drains and remove the huge quantities of soil and rock cut from the canal bed. All the shovels but one were scrapped at Panama. The survivor was shipped back to California and then brought to Denver. In the early 1950s, it was transported to Rollinsville by Roy and Russell Durand, who operated it at the Lump Gulch Placer, six miles south of Nederland, Colorado, until 1978. This steam shovel is one of two (the other at the Western Minnesota Steam Thresher&#x27;s Reunion in Rollag, MN) remaining operational Bucyrus Model 50-Bs, and is preserved at the Nederland Mining Museum. Roots of Motive Power in Willits, CA has also acquired a 50-B and operates it for the public once a year at their Steam Festival in early September.

===Northwest Model===
Two shovels sit abandoned in Zamora, California, north of Sacramento beside I 5.

==In fiction==
*The classic children&#x27;s book &quot;Mike Mulligan and His Steam Shovel&quot; features a steam shovel as a main character. 
*A steam shovel, clearly illustrated with a boiler and smoke rings, also known as a &quot;Snort&quot;, features towards the climax of the children&#x27;s book &quot;Are You My Mother?&quot; by P. D. Eastman. The little bird is returned to its nest by the steam shovel.
*In the &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot; TV series, a steam shovel named Ned appears as a minor character. A rail-mounted steam shovel named Marion also appears in Thomas &amp; Friends, beginning with the movie &quot;Tale of the Brave&quot;.
*In the Australian children&#x27;s TV series &quot;Mr. Squiggle&quot;, Bill the Steam Shovel provides comic relief and produces steam from his &quot;nose&quot; when he laughs.
* In the Clive Cussler novel &quot;The Saboteurs&quot;, steam shovels play a key part of the storyline in the sabotage of the building of the Panama Canal.
* In Lackadaisy, Rocky turns one into a makeshift Siege Engine by setting Sandbags on the control levers, then climbing into the bucket with a sack of Dynamite.
*In the 1932 Laurel and Hardy film &quot;Their First Mistake&quot;, whilst on the telephone to Ollie, Stan mentions that he has two tickets for the &#x27;Cement Worker&#x27;s Bazaar&#x27; and if they attend they may win a steam shovel.

<text>Superficial muscular aponeurotic system (or superficial musculoaponeurotic system) (SMAS) is a thin yet tough unitary tissue plane of the face formed by facial fasciae, subcutis connective tissue, and facial muscles. Its composition varies, containing muscle fibres in some areas, and fibrous or fibroaponeurotic tissue in others. It connects to the dermis via vertical septa. It does not attach to bone. In most areas, a distinct plane can be defined deep to the SMAS (continuous with that formed between the platysma and underlying investing layer of deep cervical fascia).

Superiorly, the SMAS extends to the galea aponeurotica of the scalp, becoming continuous with temporoparietal fascia (at the zygomatic arch) and galea. It becomes continuous with the platysma muscle inferiorly (inferior to the inferior border of the mandible), and indistinct laterally (inferior to the zygomatic arch). Anteromedially, it blends with the epimysium of some facial muscles; a link between facial muscles and the skin of the face is thereby established, enabling facial expression. Over the parotid gland, the SMAS is firmly united with the superficial layer of parotid fascia.

== Clinical significance ==
The SMAS is clinically important in facial plastic surgery for rhytidectomy (facelift procedure). During this procedure, the SMAS is accessed through an arch-shaped incision anterior to the ear; a portion of the SMAS is then excised and the remaining SMAS is stretched by drawing it posterior-ward and suturing it, thus making the skin of the face which overlies the SMAS taut.

<text>Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) are a spectrum of autoimmune diseases characterized by acute inflammation of the optic nerve (optic neuritis, ON) and the spinal cord (myelitis). Episodes of ON and myelitis can be simultaneous or successive. A relapsing disease course is common, especially in untreated patients.

* Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is a particular disease within the NMOSD spectrum. It is characterised by optic neuritis and longitudinally extensive myelitis. In more than 80% of NMO cases, the cause is immunoglobulin G autoantibodies to aquaporin 4 (anti-AQP4), the most abundant water channel protein in the central nervous system.
* Less common diseases with other manifestations are also part of the NMOSD spectrum.

==Signs and symptoms==
The signs and symptoms of NMOSD depend on the neurologic structures the disease affects, and, to some extent, the antibodies involved.

===Spinal cord effects===
The most common initial manifestation of the disease is inflammation of the spinal cord (myelitis). Myelitis causes spinal cord dysfunction, which can result in muscle weakness, paralysis in the limbs, lost or reduced sensation, spasms, loss of bladder and bowel control, or erectile dysfunction. The myelitis can be transverse, affecting an entire cross-section of the spinal cord, and showing bilateral symptoms.

===Optic effects===
The second most common initial manifestation of the disease is inflammation of the optic nerve and/or optic chiasm (optic neuritis, ON). ON may lead to varying degrees of visual impairment with decreased visual acuity, although visual field defects, or loss of color vision, may occur in isolation or prior to formal loss of visual acuity. Compared to idiopathic ON and ON due to multiple sclerosis (MS), ON due to NMOSD more often results in severe visual loss at onset, with bilateral involvement, and permanent visual deficits.

===Brain effects===
Less commonly than the spinal cord and optic nerve, NMOSD can affect the brain stem. Lesions in the brain stem or upper cervical spinal cord can cause respiratory insufficiency. Lesions in the area postrema of the medulla oblongata can cause vomiting or hiccups, as well as pain and tonic spasms. Additional brain lesions are common but often asymptomatic (though cognitive deficits, as well as depression, may be underdiagnosed sequalae). Lesions may also affect the diencephalon, mostly in Aquaporin-4–Immunoglobulin-G (AQP4-IgG) NMOSD.

===Disease course===
Signs and symptoms usually follow a relapsing and remitting course, but occasionally can be progressive (monophasic). Deficits can be temporary or permanent, the latter especially in the absence of treatment.

===Fatigue===
Fatigue is a common symptom, with studies showing that as many as 77% of people with NMOSD have fatigue. Fatigue has been found to correlate with quality of life in people with NMOSD.

===Comparison with MS===
NMO and multiple sclerosis (MS) can be similar in clinical and radiological presentation, and MS may very rarely present with an NMO-like phenotype (e.g. in patients with long-standing MS resulting in confluent spinal cord lesions mimicking the longitudinally extensive spinal cord lesions typically seen in NMO). In consequence, NMO was in the past wrongly considered a clinical variant of MS. However, NMO is not related to MS in the vast majority of cases and differs from MS substantially in terms of pathogenesis, clinical presentation, magnetic resonance imaging, cerebrospinal fluid findings, disease course, and prognosis.

==Causes==
NMOSD is caused by an autoimmune attack on the nervous system. In more than 80% of cases, IgG autoantibodies against aquaporin-4 (anti-AQP4+) are the cause, and in 10–40% of the remaining cases, IgG antibodies against MOG are the cause. The cause of the remaining cases is still unknown, and it is likely heterogeneous.

Why autoimmunity develops is largely unknown. Multiple genetic and environmental factors are known to increase the risk of developing NMOSD. The strongest risk factor is being female, especially in AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD. Multiple human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles are associated with NMOSD.

NMO was associated in the past with many systemic diseases. Some researchers have pointed out that some other cases could be paraneoplastic. It appears that lupus can produce NMO-IgG autoantibodies, leading to cases of lupus-derived NMO.

The discovery of NMO-IgG (anti-AQP4) has opened a new avenue of research into the causes.

==Pathophysiology==
===Anti-AQP4+ variants===
NMOSD is usually caused by autoantibodies targeting aquaporin 4 (AQP4), a channel protein in the cell membrane that allows water to pass through the membrane. AQP4 monomers form tetramers, and the tetramers aggregate. AQP4 is found in astrocytes, which are the basis for the glymphatic system. Thus, NMOSD involving AQP4-IgG can be considered an astrocytopathy or autoimmune astrocytic channelopathy, since the astrocytes are semi-selectively destroyed.

The astrocytes surround the blood–brain barrier (BBB), a system responsible for preventing substances in the blood from entering the brain. For antibodies from the blood to reach astrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS), they must cross the BBB, the mechanism of which is not completely known. Some reports point to the metalloproteinase-2 and interleukin-6 as culprits responsible for the BBB failure. There is broad consensus that AQP4/NMO-IgG initially enters the brain via BBB-deficient sites such as the area postrema, where there is access to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In any case, anti-AQP4 is produced mainly intrathecally.

Within astrocytes, AQP4 is primarily found in astrocytic foot processes that abut blood vessels and the linings of the brain (meninges). NMOSD brain lesions, as seen under a microscope, show IgG, Immunoglobulin M (IgM), inflammatory cells, and complement deposits around blood vessels. AQP4-IgG is a member of the IgG1 immunoglobulin family, which is an activator of the complement system, which seems to play an integral part in the autoimmune response. There is a loss of astrocytes, and sometimes also a loss of neurons and oligodendrocytes. Loss of cells other than astrocytes is a consequence of collateral inflammatory damage or astrocyte dysfunction.

NMOSD selectively affects the optic nerve, spinal cord, and brain stem. This selectivity can be explained by the increased amount of AQP4 in these structures, and, furthermore, by the increased amount of AQP4 aggregates in the optic nerve and spinal cord. The increased BBB permeability at the area postrema helps explain involvement there. AQP4 is present in tissues outside the central nervous system (e.g. the kidneys), but these tissues aren&#x27;t affected in NMOSD, at least in part because of the presence of autoimmune downregulators outside of the central nervous system.

In NMOSD, areas of brain tissue that appear normal in conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can show damage in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), although less so compared to multiple sclerosis (MS).

Most research into the pathology of NMO has focused on the spinal cord. The damage can range from inflammatory demyelination to necrotic damage of the white and grey matters. The inflammatory lesions in NMO have been classified as type II lesions (complement-mediated demyelination), but they differ from MS pattern II lesions in their prominent perivascular distribution. Therefore, the pattern of inflammation is often quite distinct from that seen in MS.

AQP4-IgG levels are coarsely correlated with NMOSD disease activity, those levels generally increasing before relapse and declining during remission, with higher levels being correlated to more severe disease manifestation.

NMO-IgG-negative cases are less understood. It seems that astrocytes are spared in these cases.

===Anti-MOG+ variants===
The second most frequent autoantibody in NMO is MOG-IgG, which targets myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). MOG is an integral membrane glycoprotein found on the surface of oligodendrocytes and the outermost surface of myelin sheaths. Its function is not entirely known. MOG-IgG is produced outside the central nervous system (CNS) despite MOG existing only in the CNS (with the BBB separating the two), leading to the hypothesis that MOG drained via cerebral spinal fluid into lymph nodes causes autoimmune reaction formation.

MOG-IgG-positive NMOSD brain lesions, as seen under a microscopic, show demyelination with preservation of oligodendrocytes and axons, presence of inflammatory cells, and IgG and complement deposits. MOG-IgG levels coarsely correlate with disease severity, with levels being higher during active disease, and higher levels being associated with more severe disease manifestation.

Antibodies against MOG are considered mostly absent in similar diseases, such as MS. Therefore, it can be said that anti-MOG diseases are grouped within AQP4-IgG-negative NMOSD.

Together with anti-AQP4 disease, anti-MOG diseases form the wider part of the NMO spectrum. The NMO cases are classified in four classes, according to the presence or absence of any of these two main auto-antibodies.

The clinical course and the response to therapy is different for various diseases classed within these groups, showing a better prognosis for those in the NMO-Ab(−)/MOG-Ab(−) group, and a worse prognosis for those in the NMO-Ab(+)/MOG-Ab(+) group. The MOG-related NMO can be radiologically identified by the conus involvement. Myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody–positive patients were more likely to have conus involvement on spinal magnetic resonance imaging.

==Diagnosis==
NMOSD is diagnosed using consensus clinical criteria, which have undergone multiple revisions, most recently in 2015.

Diagnostic criteria are more relaxed for seropositive AQP4–IgG cases than they are for seronegative AQP4-IgG ones. If AQP4-IgG is detected, then one core clinical criterion, along with the ruling out of alternative diagnoses, is sufficient for NMOSD diagnosis.

If AQP4-IgG is undetected, or its status is unknown, two core clinical criteria, each with supportive MRI findings, along with the ruling out of alternative diagnoses, are needed for an NMOSD diagnosis.

Rarely, it has been reported that some courses of anti-NMDAR are consistent with NMO. Preliminary reports suggest that other autoantibodies may play a role in rare cases of NMO.

NMOSD with MOG-IgG is considered a manifestation of anti-MOG associated encephalomyelitis.

=== Spectrum constituents ===
After the development of the NMO-IgG test, the spectrum of disorders comprising NMO was expanded. The spectrum is now believed to consist of:
* Standard NMO, according to the diagnostic criteria described above
* Limited forms of NMO, such as single or recurrent events of longitudinally extensive myelitis, and bilateral simultaneous or recurrent optic neuritis
* Asian optic-spinal multiple sclerosis (OSMS), or AQP4+ OSMS. This variant can present brain lesions like MS does, but it should not be confused with an AQP4-negative form of inflammatory demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system spectrum, sometimes called &quot;optic-spinal MS&quot;
* Longitudinally extensive myelitis or optic neuritis associated with systemic autoimmune disease
* Optic neuritis or myelitis associated with lesions in specific brain areas such as the hypothalamus, periventricular nucleus, and brainstem
* NMO-IgG negative NMO: AQP4 antibody-seronegative NMO poses a diagnostic challenge. Some cases could be related to anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) autoantibodies.

=== Differential diagnosis ===
AQP4-Ab-negative NMO presents problems for differential diagnosis. The behavior of the oligoclonal bands can help to establish a more accurate diagnosis. Oligoclonal bands in NMO are rare and they tend to disappear after attacks, while in MS they are nearly always present and persistent. It is important to notice for differential diagnosis that, though uncommon, it is possible to have longitudinal lesions in MS.

Another problem for diagnosis is that AQP4-ab in MOG-ab levels can be too low to be detected. Some additional biomarkers have been proposed.

NMO differs from MS in that it usually has more severe sequelae after an acute episode than standard MS, which infrequently presents as transverse myelitis. In addition oligoclonal bands in the CSF as well as white matter lesions on brain MRIs are uncommon in NMO, but occur in over 90% of MS patients.

Recently, the presence of AQP4 has been found to distinguish standard MS from NMO; but as MS is a heterogeneous condition, and some MS cases are reported to be Kir4.1 channelopathies (autoimmunity against the potassium channels), it is still possible to consider NMO as part of the MS spectrum. Besides, some NMO-AQP4(−) variants are not astrocytopathic, but demyelinating.

Tumefactive demyelinating lesions in NMO are not usual, but they have been reported to appear in several cases mistakenly treated with interferon beta.

Also, an overlap with Sjögren syndrome has been reported.

=== Evolution of diagnostic criteria ===
Since the discovery of the AQP4 autoantibody, it has been found that it appears also in patients with NMO-like symptoms that do not fulfill the clinical requirements to be diagnosed with NMO (recurrent and simultaneous optic nerve and spinal cord inflammation).

The term neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) has been designed to allow incorporation of cases associated with non-AQP4 biomarkers. Therefore, it includes all the clinical variants due to anti-AQP4, plus other non-related but clinically similar syndromes such as anti-MOG associated encephalomyelitis. Some cases with MOG+ and AQP4+ antibodies have been found.

These variants are expected to respond to the same treatments as standard NMO. Some authors propose to use the name &quot;autoimmune aquaporin-4 channelopathy&quot; for these diseases, while others prefer a more generic term &quot;AQP4-astrocytopathy&quot;, which also includes deficiencies of AQP4 with a non-autoimmune origin.

==Treatment==
There is no cure for NMO, but it is treatable. Some patients recover, but many are left with impairment of vision and limbs, which can be severe in some cases.

===Attacks===
Long term neurologic deficits are the cumulative effects of acute attacks, emphasizing the importance of acute treatment. Traditionally, attacks have been treated with short courses (3–5 days) of high dosage intravenous corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone IV (Solu-Medrol). Early initiation of treatment with steroids has been shown to improve vision-related outcomes after acute attacks. However, there is no high-level evidence for steroids affecting long-term outcomes; this treatment strategy was borrowed from that for similar diseases (idiopathic optic neuritis and multiple sclerosis).

Plasmapheresis can be an effective treatment when attacks progress after the administration of corticosteroids. This treatment involves the patient&#x27;s own blood being pumped out, blood cells being removed from the plasma and mixed with a solution, then the new blood mixture being pumped back in.

===Secondary prevention===
Prophylactic treatment, to prevent relapses of NMO, is generally employed; but the exact duration of such treatment is debatable.

====FDA-approved pharmaceuticals====
FDA-approved pharmaceuticals against AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD, shown to be effective in phase III clinical trials, first became available in 2019. As of 2020, they are among the most expensive drugs worldwide. They are not available in pill form, which, along with their high price, limits their accessibility. These new drugs&#x27; effectiveness against AQP4-IgG-negative NMOSD is unknown.

==== Off-label treatments ====
Many treatments are used despite the lack of phase III clinical trials testing their efficacy. Neither inferiority nor superiority to the newer, FDA approved drugs has been clearly demonstrated; and, considering their being relatively inexpensive and being availability in pill format, these drugs are the current standard treatment. Most of these medications affect the immune system in various ways.

It is important to note that certain immunosuppressants used to treat MS—such as interferon-β, fingolimod, natalizumab, and alemtuzumab—worsen NMO disease progression and should not be used to treat NMO.

==Prognosis==
Normally, some improvement appears in a few weeks, but severe residual symptoms and even disability may persist.

The disease can be monophasic, i.e. a single episode with permanent remission afterwards. However, at least 85% of patients have a relapsing form of the disease with repeated attacks of transverse myelitis and/or optic neuritis. In patients with the monophasic form, the transverse myelitis and optic neuritis occur simultaneously or within days of each other. On the other hand, patients with the relapsing form are more likely to have weeks or months between the initial attacks, and to have better motor recovery after the initial transverse myelitis event. Relapses usually occur early, with about 55% of patients having a relapse in the first year and 90% in the first five years.

It is possible that the relapsing form is related to the anti-AQP4+ seropositive status and the monophasic form related to its absence. Unlike MS, NMO rarely has a secondary progressive phase in which patients have increasing neurologic decline between attacks without remission. Instead, disabilities arise from the acute attacks.

Approximately 20% of patients with monophasic NMO have permanent visual loss, and 30% have permanent paralysis in one or both legs. Among patients with relapsing NMO, 50% have blindness or paralysis within five years. In some patients (33% in one study), transverse myelitis in the cervical spinal cord resulted in respiratory failure and subsequent death. However, the spectrum of NMO has widened, due to improved diagnostic criteria; and the options for treatment have improved. As a result, researchers believe these estimates will be lowered.

== Epidemiology ==
Prevalence varies by region, ranging from 0.5 to 10 cases per 100,000 people. Unlike MS, prevalence has not been found to be related to latitude. NMO is more common in women than men, with women comprising over two-thirds of patients and more than 80% of those with the relapsing form of the disease.

A retrospective study found that prevalence of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders was 1.5% among a random sample of neurological patients, with a MS:NMOSD ratio of 42:7. Among 13 NMOSD patients, 77% had long spinal cord lesions, 38% had severe optic neuritis, and 23% had brain or brainstem lesions. Only 56% had clinically definite NMO at follow-up.

NMO is more common in Asians than Caucasians. In fact, Asian optic-spinal multiple sclerosis (OSMS) (which constitutes 30% of the cases of MS in Japan) has been suggested to be identical to NMO (differences between OSMS and classic MS in Japanese patients). In the indigenous populations of tropical and subtropical regions, MS is rare; but when it appears, it often takes the form of OSMS.

The majority of NMO patients have no affected relatives, and it is generally regarded as a nonfamilial condition.

Rarely, NMO may occur in the context of other autoimmune diseases (e.g. connective tissue disorders, paraneoplastic syndromes) or infectious diseases. In some cases, the etiology remains unknown (idiopathic NMO).

==History==
First reports on an association of spinal cord with optic nerve disorders date back to the late 18th and early 19th century. However, only an 1870 report by Sir Thomas Clifford Allbutt created sustained interest on the part of neurologists and ophthalmologists in this rare syndrome. In 1894, Eugène Devic and his PhD student Fernand Gault described 16 patients who had lost vision in one or both eyes and within weeks developed severe spastic weakness of the limbs, loss of sensation, and often of bladder control. They recognized these symptoms were the result of inflammation of the optic nerve and spinal cord, respectively.

In 2002, Mayo Clinic researchers identified a humoral mechanism, targeting a perivascular protein, as the culprit of NMO, and in 2004 an unknown specific autoantibody was found. In 2005 they identified the aquaporin 4 protein as the target of the disease, and developed the first in-house test to aid in the diagnosis of NMO by detection of an antibody, AQP4-IgG, in the blood. The first quantitative ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) kits were soon developed, However, serum AQP4-IgG titer only moderately reflects disease activity, severity, or neurological prognosis. Later, some other autoantibodies were found in NMO AQP4-negative cases, such as anti-MOG IgG, but some NMO anti-AQP4-negative cases still remain idiopathic.

==Research directions==
Since the discovery of AQP4 involvement, some research studies have focused on targeted treatment aimed at anti-aquaporin 4 antibodies. The most established method for antibody removal is plasmapheresis. A number of drugs are being studied: aquaporumab (non-pathogenic antibody blocker of AQP4-IgG binding), sivelestat (neutrophil elastase inhibitor), and eculizumab (complement inhibitor).

There is little research into the primary causes of the anti-AQP4 auto-antibodies. It has been noticed that some cases could be paraneoplastic.

In addition, several NMO variants have been discovered with antibodies other than those against AQP4, turning NMO into a heterogeneous disease. Six different patterns of damage have been reported in NMO, raising the possibility of six different types of auto-antibodies. As of 2019, only three of them are known.

===Research into new autoantibodies===
An autoantibody—glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)—was found in 2016, in transverse myelitis (LETM) and atypical NMO, leading to the concept of autoimmune GFAP astrocytopathy.

Other autoantibody being researched is flotillin. It has been found in seronegative NMO and some MS patients.

Finally, other proteins under study are connexin 43 and anti-AQP1, although, as of 2015, there are only initial reports about the involvement of these proteins.

The group AQP4+/MOG+ is very small and it can be considered a coincidence of two completely separate diseases in the same person. Assuming these cases can be verified, five different kinds of NMO are being considered:
* NMO derived from an autoimmune channelopathy (AQP4-Ab+) – around 80% of total NMO cases
* NMO derived from an anti-MOG associated encephalomyelitis – around 10% of total cases
* Connexin-43 NMO
* Aquaporin-1 associated NMO which could be related to pattern III MS
* Idiopathic NMO, defined by the absence of all previous antibodies

===Antibody negative neuromyelitis optica===

Some cases of NMO are not due to autoantibodies. They constitute an overlap between NMO and MS.

As of 2019 some statistical studies showed that antibody-negative NMO can be classified into three groups, and that this classification has a pathogenic meaning.

Later studies have increased the number of groups up to four.

<text>In finance, the Treynor reward-to-volatility model (sometimes called the reward-to-volatility ratio or Treynor measure), named after American economist Jack L. Treynor, is a measurement of the returns earned in excess of that which could have been earned on an investment that has no risk that can be diversified (e.g., Treasury bills or a completely diversified portfolio), per unit of market risk assumed.

The Treynor ratio relates excess return over the risk-free rate to the additional risk taken; however, systematic risk is used instead of total risk. The higher the Treynor ratio, the better the performance of the portfolio under analysis.

==Formula==
:formula_1

where: 

:formula_2 Treynor ratio,

:formula_3 portfolio &quot;i&quot;&#x27;s return,

:formula_4 risk free rate

:formula_5 portfolio &quot;i&quot;&#x27;s beta

== Example ==

Taking the equation detailed above, let us assume that the expected portfolio return is 20%, the risk free rate is 5%, and the beta of the portfolio is 1.5. Substituting these values, we get the following 
:formula_6

==Limitations==
Like the Sharpe ratio, the Treynor ratio (&quot;T&quot;) does not quantify the value added, if any, of active portfolio management. It is a ranking criterion only. A ranking of portfolios based on the Treynor Ratio is only useful if the portfolios under consideration are sub-portfolios of a broader, fully diversified portfolio. If this is not the case, portfolios with identical systematic risk, but different total risk, will be rated the same. But the portfolio with a higher total risk is less diversified and therefore has a higher unsystematic risk which is not priced in the market.

An alternative method of ranking portfolio management is Jensen&#x27;s alpha, which quantifies the added return as the excess return above the security market line in the capital asset pricing model. As these two methods both determine rankings based on systematic risk alone, they will rank portfolios identically.

<text>Harper is an American publishing house, the flagship imprint of global publisher, HarperCollins, based in New York City. Founded in New York in 1817 by James Harper and his brother John, the company operated as J. &amp; J. Harper until 1833, when it changed its name to Harper &amp; Brothers, reflecting the inclusion of Joseph and Fletcher Harper. Harper began publishing &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, and other periodicals beginning in the 1850s. From 1962 to 1990, the company was known as Harper &amp; Row after its merger with Row, Peterson &amp; Company. Harper &amp; Row was purchased in 1987 by News Corporation and combined with William Collins, Sons, its United Kingdom counterpart, in 1990 to form HarperCollins, although the Harper name has been used in its place since 2007.

==History==
===J. &amp; J. Harper (1817–1833)===
James Harper and his brother John, printers by training, started their book publishing business, J. &amp; J. Harper, in New York City in 1817. Their two brothers, Joseph Wesley and Fletcher, joined them in the mid-1820s.

===Harper &amp; Brothers (1833–1962)===

The company changed its name to &quot;Harper &amp; Brothers&quot; in 1833. The headquarters of the publishing house was located at 331 Pearl Street, facing Franklin Square in Lower Manhattan near the present-day Manhattan approach to the Brooklyn Bridge.

Harper &amp; Brothers began publishing &quot;Harper&#x27;s New Monthly Magazine&quot; in New York City, in 1850. The brothers also published &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; (starting in New York City in June 1857), &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazar&quot; (starting in New York City on November 2, 1867), and &quot;Harper&#x27;s Young People&quot; (starting in New York City in 1879).

George B. M. Harvey became president of Harper&#x27;s on November 16, 1899.

&quot;Harper&#x27;s New Monthly Magazine&quot; ultimately became &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, now published by the Harper&#x27;s Magazine Foundation. &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; was absorbed by &quot;The Independent&quot; (New York; later Boston) in 1916, which merged with &quot;The Outlook&quot; in 1928. &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazar&quot; was sold to William Randolph Hearst in 1913, became &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, and is now simply &quot;Bazaar&quot;, published by the Hearst Corporation.

In 1924, Cass Canfield joined Harper &amp; Brothers and held various executive positions until he died in 1986. In 1925, Eugene F. Saxton joined the company as an editor, and he was responsible for publishing many well-known authors, including Edna St. Vincent Millay and Thornton Wilder. In 1935, Edward Aswell moved to Harper &amp; Brothers as an assistant editor of general books and eventually became editor-in-chief. Aswell persuaded Thomas Wolfe to leave Scribner&#x27;s, and, after Wolfe&#x27;s death, edited the posthumous novels, &quot;The Web and the Rock&quot;, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Go Home Again&quot;, and &quot;The Hills Beyond&quot;.

===Harper &amp; Row (1962–1990) ===
In 1962, Harper &amp; Brothers merged with Row, Peterson &amp; Company to become Harper &amp; Row. Harper&#x27;s religion publishing moved to San Francisco and became Harper San Francisco, which is now HarperOne, in 1977. Harper &amp; Row acquired Thomas Y. Crowell Co. and J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co. in the 1970s; Crowell and the trade operations of Lippincott were merged into Harper &amp; Row in 1980. In 1988, Harper &amp; Row purchased the religious publisher Zondervan, including subsidiary Marshall Pickering.

===HarperCollins (1990–present)===

Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Corporation, now News Corp, acquired Harper &amp; Row in 1987, and William Collins, Sons in 1990. The names of these two national publishing houses, Harper &amp; Row in the United States and Collins in the United Kingdom, were combined along with the Harper&#x27;s torch icon and Collins&#x27; fountain icon to create HarperCollins. The company has since expanded its international reach with further acquisitions of formerly independent publishers. The Harper imprint began being used in place of HarperCollins in 2007.

==Paperbacks==
After the purchase of Harper &amp; Row by News Corporation, HarperCollins launched a new mass-market paperback line to complement its existing trade paperback Perennial imprint. It was known as Harper Paperbacks from 1990 to 2000, HarperTorch from 2000 to 2006, and Harper from 2007 to the present.

<text>The Restigouche River (, ) is a river that flows across the northwestern part of the province of New Brunswick and the southeastern part of Quebec.

The river flows in a northeasterly direction from its source in the Appalachian Mountains of northwestern New Brunswick to Chaleur Bay. Its meander length is approximately . The Restigouche is fed by several tributaries flowing south from Quebec&#x27;s Notre Dame Mountains on the western edge of the Gaspé Peninsula (Kedgwick River, Gounamitz River, Patapédia River, and Matapedia River) as well as the Upsalquitch River flowing north from New Brunswick&#x27;s &quot;Chaleur Uplands&quot;.

Located mostly in New Brunswick, the river forms the inter-provincial boundary between the two provinces from its confluence with the Patapédia River to its mouth at Dalhousie, New Brunswick and Miguasha, Quebec where it discharges into Chaleur Bay.

The estuary is in length, extending from the river&#x27;s discharge point at Dalhousie in the east to Tide Head, New Brunswick in the west and is an important stopover for sea ducks, especially black scoters and surf scoters, during migration. This estuary has been designated an Important Bird Area by the Canadian Wildlife Service.

The Royal Canadian Navy has named two warships after this river: and .

The source of Restigouche River is located at the confluence of the Little Main Restigouche River and Kedgwick River. This confluence is located:
* West of the village center of Kedgwick, New Brunswick;
* South of the confluence of the Patapédia River, which is located at the border between Quebec and New Brunswick;
* Southwest of Campbellton, New Brunswick, crossing the Restigouche River.

From the confluence of the Little Main Restigouche River and Kedgwick River (in New Brunswick), the Restigouche river flows on up to the confluence, distributed according to the following segments:

Higher Courses of the Restigouche River (upstream of the [[Kedgwick River]])(segment of )

* to the Northeast, forming a curve to the Northwest, to the Soldiers Creek (from the east);
* North, in a curve to the East, until UpperDowns Gulch (from the southwest);
* to the Northeast, to Tracy Brook (from the West);
* to the Southeast until Haffords Brook (from the South);
* Eastward, forming a curve oriented toward the southeast until Stillwater Brook (from the east);
* North, to the confluence of the Patapedia River (from the West) which forms the boundary between the Quebec and New Brunswick.

Middle course of the river (upstream of the [[Patapédia River]]) (segment of )

From the confluence of the Patapédia River, the Restigouche river flows:

* to the northeast, to the stream of Wild Chalet (from the north or from the Quebec);

==History==

The name &quot;Restigouche&quot; may have been derived from the Mi&#x27;gmaq name &quot;Listuguj&quot; for the First Nations band that lives in the area around the Restigouche River. Lustagooch probably indicates &quot;good river&quot;. Both spellings have been used from earliest times: Restigoch (Jesuit Relations, 1642); Ristigouche (Denys, 1672); Restigousche (Des Barres, 1778).

Home to the Mi&#x27;gmaq Nation for centuries, the Restigouche watershed is a land of many mountains and unspoiled vistas, as well as significant timber resources. French settlers established several communities on its banks during the 17th and 18th centuries but the area remained largely void of European settlement until the decades following the French and Indian War. The Battle of Restigouche was a naval action between British and French forces which was fought on the river in 1760 during the latter stages of the war. Those French vessels were to supply Quebec with supplies and ammunition following the loss of the battle of the Plains of Abraham, but since the ships never made it, the city never had a chance to be retaken.

The establishment of the colony of New Brunswick for United Empire Loyalists refugees following the American Revolutionary War saw modest influx of several families to the area but the most significant impact came from Scottish settlers following the Highland Clearances. Many Scottish families found work in the infancy of the timber industry and were at the forefront of industrialization of the forests throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries. The Restigouche River and its tributaries became a highway for log drives, bringing timber to the dozens of sawmills at Campbellton, and Dalhousie. Further industrialization saw pulp and paper mills established in those communities by the 1930s to take advantage of the Restigouche watershed&#x27;s timber resources.

==Salmon fishing==
The river is a destination for Atlantic salmon fishing. Fly fishing/angling has become a significant source of revenue for many outfitters in the region and a of the Restigouche has been designated part of the Canadian Heritage Rivers System.

According to Restigouche Lodge between 15,000 and 25,000 salmon enter the Restigouche each year, which attracts anglers from all over the world. While many Atlantic salmon are reluctant to strike, the Restigouche variety are aggressive, and once hooked, they fight hard and are highly acrobatic.

The Restigouche River is known for its exclusivity, clear water and large Atlantic salmon. Fish over pounds are landed somewhere on the Restigouche every year; salmon weights in the high range are considered common. Early spring through the end of June is the best time for catching these salmon.

 For more than 100 years, the world&#x27;s wealthiest people have come to enjoy the river&#x27;s tranquil beauty and perfect canoeing conditions to fish for salmon. Among the VIPs who have been guests at the river&#x27;s fishing lodges include the Duke of Windsor and Wallis Simpson, Hubert Humphrey, Ted Williams, Lord Beaverbrook, Bing Crosby, Louis St. Laurent, Maurice Richard, Norman Schwarzkopf, George H. W. Bush, and Brian Mulroney, to name but a few.

Part of the draw for salmon fishing on rivers in New Brunswick and Quebec is its exclusivity - the provincial government&#x27;s Department of Natural Resources auctions fishing leases for physical sections of the river and riverbed to the highest bidder. Many private fishing lodges have been established on the Restigouche which are owned and operated by major corporations and the wealthy. Such leases are time-limited and, for the best fishing pools, can reportedly run into the millions of dollars for fishing rights lasting for only a few years. Leaseholders must obey all provincial conservation laws by hiring their own fish wardens to patrol each leased section of the river and all persons sanctioned by a particular leaseholder to fish in a lease must hold a provincial angling license. The general public are permitted a right of navigation on the river, as per Canada&#x27;s &quot;Navigable Waters Protection Act&quot;; however, they are not permitted to drop anchor in, or cause any disturbance to the river bottom, and are not permitted to fish in a particular lease area.

New Brunswick&#x27;s wealthy Irving family has owned a lodge for many years at one of the best fishing holes on the river – the confluence of the Kedgwick with the Restigouche – and the Government of New Brunswick also maintains a &quot;rustic&quot; lodge in nearby Larry&#x27;s Gulch which has operated as an exclusive resort/get away for politicians and friends of the government in office. William Kissam Vanderbilt enjoyed fishing on the river so much that he had a private fishing lodge built, hiring the famous New York City architect Stanford White to design and oversee construction of the property called Kedgwick Lodge and fueling the love affair of corporate America with the Restigouche.

The Canadian business elite outside of the Maritimes have not been nearly as enamoured with the river as Americans, although several prominent Toronto families including the Eatons did have a presence. This is largely due to the relative proximity of the river to Boston, New York and Philadelphia, which helped make the region a small summer colony.

The designation of a stretch of the Upper Restigouche as a Heritage River in 1998 was not the first attempt to preserve this area. Early issues with over-fishing by new arrivals to the area led to the implementation, in 1824, of one of the earliest examples of conservation laws in North America. This culminated in the implementation of the Fisheries Act in 1858 and &quot;opened the door for private hunting and fishing clubs by granting them fishing leases ….&quot; The efforts of conservationists continue today with groups such as the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society. This group claims that only 1 percent of the Restigouche watershed is protected from development.

===&quot;The Ristigouche&quot;===
&quot;The Ristigouche and its Salmon Fishing With a Chapter on Angling Literature&quot; is a limited-edition book about the Restigouche River, written by Dean Sage and published by David Douglas in Edinburgh in 1888. It is notable for containing a portfolio of 16 etchings and engravings and numerous page decorations, depicting various aspects of the river by notable artists of the day including Stephen Parrish, Henry Sandham, Charles A. Platt, Anna Lea Merritt, Charles Oliver Murray, and George W. Aikman. With its initial print run of just 105 numbered copies &quot;The Ristigouche&quot; is, according to Bonhams, the &quot;rarest and most beautiful book on salmon fishing&quot;. Bonhams sold a copy in 2007 for US$18,000.

<text>The Farrer hypothesis (also called the L/M hypothesis, the Farrer–Goulder hypothesis and the Farrer–Goulder–Goodacre hypothesis) is a possible solution to the synoptic problem. The theory is that the Gospel of Mark was written first, followed by the Gospel of Matthew and then by the Gospel of Luke, with Matthew and Luke using the earlier gospel(s) as sources.

It has mainly been advocated by English biblical scholars. It is named for Austin Farrer, who wrote &quot;On Dispensing With Q&quot; in 1955, but it has been picked up by other scholars including Michael Goulder and Mark Goodacre.

==Overview==

The Farrer theory has the advantage of simplicity, as there is no need for hypothetical sources. Instead, advocates of the Farrer theory argue, the Gospel of Mark was used as source material by the author of Matthew. Lastly, Luke used both of the previous gospels as sources for his Gospel.

Farrer set out his argument in an essay &quot;On dispensing with Q&quot;. He says that the two-source hypothesis, as set out by B. H. Streeter thirty years earlier, &quot;wholly depends on the incredibility [i.e., disbelief] of St Luke having read St Matthew&#x27;s book&quot;, since otherwise the natural assumption would be that one was dependent on the other, rather than that they were both dependent on a further source.

This assumption could be displaced by, for example, identifying material appearing in both Matthew and Luke that was very different from either of them, which, when extracted, appears to be a work in its own right, with a beginning, middle and end. Neither of these factors are found in Q, as reconstructed by scholars. He also says (writing before the publication of the Gospel of Thomas) that &quot;we have no reason to believe that documents of the Q type were plentiful&quot;, which would have made the hypothesis that Matthew and Luke drew on one more likely.

Nor is it obvious, Farrer says, that a book like Q was likely to be produced as a written manual of the teaching of Christ, since the reconstruction of it requires it to also have significant narrative elements interspersed with the teaching, and to have an interest in symbolism from the Old Testament.

==Arguments for and against==

===Arguments for===

In his 1955 paper &quot;On Dispensing with Q&quot;, Austin Farrer made the case that if Luke had been acquainted with the gospel of Matthew, there would be no need to postulate a lost Q gospel. Farrer&#x27;s case rested on the following points:

* The Q hypothesis was formed to answer the question of where Matthew and Luke got their common material if they did not know of each other&#x27;s gospels. But if Luke had read Matthew, the question that Q answers does not arise.
* We have no evidence from early Christian writings that anything like Q ever existed.
* When scholars have attempted to reconstruct Q from the common elements of Matthew and Luke, the result does not look like a gospel.
** Although many scholars originally thought of Q as a sayings gospel, a collection of teachings with no narrative content, all alleged reconstructions of Q from the common parts of Matthew and Luke include narrative about John the Baptist, Jesus&#x27; baptism and temptation in the wilderness, and his healing of a centurion&#x27;s servant.
** However, they don&#x27;t include an account of Jesus&#x27; death and resurrection.
** But from the earliest Christian writings, we see a strong emphasis on precisely the element that a putative Q omits, Jesus&#x27; death and resurrection.
* Some scholars have attempted to overcome problems with Q reconstructions by claiming we cannot know the actual contents of the Q gospel. However, postulating Luke&#x27;s acquaintance with the gospel of Matthew overcomes these same problems and gives the source for the common material.

The most notable argument for the Farrer hypothesis is that there are many passages where the text of Matthew and Luke agree in making small changes to that of Mark (what is called the double tradition). This would follow naturally if Luke was using Matthew and Mark, but is hard to explain if he is using Mark and Q. Streeter divides these into six groups and finds separate hypotheses for each.

Farrer comments that &quot;[h]is argument finds its strength in the fewness of the instances for which any one hypothesis needs to be invoked; but the opposing counsel will unkindly point out that the diminution of the instances for each hypothesis is in exact proportion to the multiplication of the hypotheses themselves. One cannot say that Dr. Streeter&#x27;s plea is incapable of being sustained, but one must concede that it is a plea against apparent evidence&quot;.

Goodacre puts forth an additional argument from &quot;fatigue&quot;, meaning cases where a derivative passage begins to make changes to its source but fails to sustain them and lapses back into the original version. For example, the parable of the talents is more coherent in Matthew, but less so in Luke, who attempted to increase the number of servants from three to ten. The several instances where this is observed point to Luke using Matthew rather than contrariwise.

===Streeter&#x27;s five arguments against===

Five arguments are given by Streeter for the impossibility of Luke relying on Matthew.
#The first is that he would not have omitted some of the Matthean texts that he did because they are so striking. Farrer replies that they were omitted because they do not conform to the &#x27;edifice&#x27; that Luke is building.
#The second is that Luke sometimes preserves a more primitive version of a text that is also in Matthew. Farrer replies that this depends on being able to identify the more primitive text; for example, &quot;Blessed are the poor in spirit&quot; suits Matthew&#x27;s theology, but it would be natural for Luke to drop the &quot;in spirit&quot; to fit his concern with the poor.
#The third is that Luke follows Mark&#x27;s order but does not do the same with Matthew. Farrer asks, in reply, why he should: &quot;Is it surprising that he should lay his plan on Marcan foundations, and quarry St. Matthew for materials to build up his house?&quot;
#The fourth is that Luke uses the material less well than Matthew. Farrer replies that this may be so, but he would not be the first adapter to have produced a less skilful result, the only issue was whether it would suit Luke&#x27;s message better to have the material arranged in this way.
#The final argument is that Luke does not use the material within the same Marcan paragraphs as Matthew. Farrer points out that he takes them out of a Marcan context and reproduces them elsewhere. In chapters 10–18, Luke reassembles the teaching material in a way which makes the points that he wants to make, often by pairing sayings that have not been paired together before. This may have been to produce a Christian Deuteronomy, just as it was argued that Matthew&#x27;s gospel was in the form of a Christian Pentateuch.

<text>The Chevrolet SSR (Super SportRoadster) is a retro-styled retractable hardtop convertible pickup truck manufactured by Chevrolet between 2003 and 2006.

During the 2003 and 2004 model years, the SSR used General Motors&#x27; 5.3 L &quot;Vortec 5300&quot; V8. Performance was 7.7 seconds for with a 15.9 second time at .

For the 2005 model year, the SSR used the &quot;LS2&quot; V8 engine also used in the C6 Corvette, Trailblazer SS, and Pontiac GTO, now offering a manual transmission option, the six-speed Tremec, for the first time. Performance improved dramatically with the LS2; the 6-speed manual version had an advertised 0– acceleration time of 5.29 seconds. In addition, GM badges were added to the vehicle.

For 2006, output of the LS2 increased to .

==Design==
The SSR&#x27;s styled design was inspired by Chevrolet&#x27;s late-1940s Advance Design trucks, in particular the 1947–1955 pickups. The vehicle rode on a GMT368 platform specific to it, a version of the period&#x27;s highly adaptable GMT360, and featured a steel body retractable hardtop designed by Karmann and built by ASC. The body of the pickup, namely the front fenders, was made with deep draw stampings, a forming technique that had not been used in automotive stampings in decades, and required a &quot;relearning&quot; of the forming technique. The production model was based on the &quot;SuperSport Roadster&quot; concept car shown at the 2000 Detroit Auto Show. In contrast to the production vehicle, this concept car used the chassis from the Chevrolet S-10 pickup. An early-production SSR was the pace car for the 2003 Indianapolis 500 auto race.

==Sales==
The SSR was introduced as a 2003 model on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2002 (December 31). In spite of marketing efforts which included the SSR being used as the pace car for the 2003 Indianapolis 500, it sold below expectations with under 9,000 sales at US$42,000 each. Citing a 301-day supply of SSRs, General Motors in December of that year announced five weeks of layoffs at Lansing Craft Center, the factory that made the SSR. On November 21, 2005, GM announced that it would close the Craft Center in mid-2006, implying the production ending for the SSR. The final SSR, a unique black-on-silver model (Highest VIN 1GCES14H06B126138), was built on March 17, 2006. Analysts estimate that 24,150 SSRs were produced in total. Of the total production, 24,112 were available for sale to the public.

== Features ==

The Chevrolet SSR offered many luxury amenities as standard equipment. Standard equipment on all SSR&#x27;s included power windows and door locks, keyless entry, luxury leather-trimmed bucket seats, front side SRS airbags, an AM/FM stereo radio with cassette and CD players and a four-speaker audio system, carpeted floor mats, 19-inch front and 20-inch rear tires and cast-aluminum wheels, a body-colored rear tonneau cover, a power-retractable hardtop convertible roof, carpeted flooring for the interior and rear cargo compartment area, a driver information center, dual-zone manual air conditioning, a power-adjustable driver&#x27;s seat, dual front SRS airbags, a leather-wrapped, tilt-adjustable steering wheel, and a cruise control, among other features. Options were few, but included the General Motors (GM) OnStar in-vehicle telematics system, polished cast-aluminum wheels, Teak decking and metal strakes for the rear cargo compartment area, rear onboard storage saddle bags, SSR-embroidered carpeted floor mats, dual power-adjustable bucket seats with driver&#x27;s seat memory, an AM/FM stereo radio with a six-disc, in-dash CD changer, XM Satellite Radio, and a Bose six-speaker premium audio system with an amplifier, steering wheel-mounted audio system and OnStar controls, color-keyed interior accent trim, dual-zone automatic air conditioning, and an auxiliary center gauge package. Many of these options were part of the 1SB Equipment Package, which replaced the standard 1SA Equipment Package.

== Motorsports ==
An attempt was made at a land speed record using a highly modified version of an SSR during the Bonneville Speed Week in August 2011. In spite of the team&#x27;s efforts, the SSR in question was deemed ineligible to race in the class that they intended to compete in due to an air dam that did not conform to the class rules. They were permitted to race the pickup for &quot;time only&quot; but the pickup proved unstable at speeds approaching . The pickup never reached speeds anywhere near close enough to take the record. That same year, a 1996 GMC Sonoma put the class record even further out of reach by running nearly faster than the previous record.

<text>Paul Mathias Tellier, (born 1939) is a Canadian businessman and former public servant and lawyer.

==Biography==
Born in Joliette, Quebec, Tellier earned his undergraduate degree from the University of Ottawa and his law degree from the University of Oxford. He entered Canada&#x27;s civil service in the 1970s and rose through the ranks of the federal bureaucracy through several high-profile deputy minister portfolios, culminating as the nation&#x27;s top civil servant from August 12, 1985 to June 30, 1992, when he was appointed Clerk of the Privy Council, in the Privy Council Office of Canada, during Brian Mulroney&#x27;s ministry. Mulroney reduced Tellier&#x27;s role as Clerk between 1986 and 1989, when he appointed Dalton Camp as his personal Deputy Minister.

In 1992, he left the civil service and was appointed by Mulroney as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Crown corporation Canadian National Railway (CN). Tellier was a driving force behind the successful privatization of the company in 1995 and was widely seen as being the principal instigator behind CN&#x27;s purchase of Illinois Central, which saw the company expand its focus from an exclusively east-west orientation into a north-south one. As such it was one of the first companies to reap the benefits of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Following a failed bid to merge CN with BNSF Railway in 2000, Tellier oversaw the purchase and integration of Wisconsin Central. He also was responsible for hiring a management team that focused on making CN a &quot;scheduled&quot; freight railway, largely by promoting former Illinois Central president Hunter Harrison to a vice-president position at CN.

In January 2003, Tellier stepped down from CN, (Harrison assumed the presidency of the company) to take a three-year posting as the President and CEO of Bombardier. This was largely seen in the Canadian business community as an attempt by Bombardier to turn itself around following several lacklustre years of growth in the aerospace and passenger rail vehicle markets. Tellier oversaw Bombardier and sold its recreational vehicle production to the Beaudoin family, Bombardier&#x27;s majority shareholders. Tellier also made several major cuts in the workforce and attempted to adjust and refocus the company on its core business activities. On December 13, 2004, it was announced that Tellier was leaving Bombardier, after he told the company that he did not want to stay for the full three years of his contract. Tellier also serves as an executive on the board of directors of Bell Canada and Rio Tinto Alcan.

In 1992, he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada. In 2004, the second St. Clair Tunnel was named in his honor.

Since November 2006, Paul Tellier has served as joint chairman on the Prime Minister&#x27;s Advisory Committee on the Public Service of Canada. This committee gives advice to the Prime Minister and the Clerk of the Privy Council on the renewal of the Public Service, with the objective of shaping it into an institution geared to excellence, distinguished by highly engaged and highly skilled people performing critical tasks with professionalism and efficiency.

In October 2007, he was appointed by Prime Minister Harper to a panel responsible for reviewing Canada&#x27;s military mission in the War in Afghanistan.

Paul Tellier is the son of Maurice Tellier, and the grandson of Sir Joseph-Mathias Tellier, who was the brother of Louis Tellier. He is also a third cousin of Luc-Normand Tellier.

<doc id="1273117" wikidata="Q2981690" url="?curid=1273117" title="Isle of Demons">
<text>The Isle of Demons is a phantom island once associated with Quirpon Island, Newfoundland, in Canada. It was generally shown as two islands. It began appearing on maps in the beginning of the 16th century and disappeared in the mid-17th century. It could also simply be a translation from First Nations people who often avoided areas where a person had died, believing it was haunted by spirits. This results in many islands with the same naming theme.

It was believed that the island was populated by demons and wild beasts which would torment and attack any ships that passed or anyone that was foolish enough to wander onto the island. A French noblewoman, Marguerite de La Rocque, was marooned on an island in the mid-16th century, allegedly because of an affair with a young man on her ship. This island is a possible site of their abandonment, and residents and visitors have claimed to see the couple. Across the centuries, many historians, novelists, poets, and singers have retold the story of Marguerite abandoned on the island. It is believed that the island of the marooning is most likely Harrington Harbour, Quebec. 

The Isle of Demons first appears in the 1508 map of Johannes Ruysch. It may simply be a relocated version of the older legendary island of Satanazes (&quot;Devils&quot; in Portuguese) that was normally depicted in 15th century maps in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean just north of Antillia. With the Atlantic better mapped with the trans-oceanic voyages of the 1490s, Ruysch may simply have transplanted old Satanazes to a more suitable location.
The Isle of Demons continues to appear as late as the 1556 map of &quot;La Nueva Francia&quot; by Giacomo Gastaldi – that is, after Jacques Cartier&#x27;s expeditions (1534, 1535, 1541) had explored much of Newfoundland and the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The &quot;Isola de Demoni&quot; is depicted by Gastaldi as a substantially large island roughly encompassing northern Newfoundland, with figurative depictions of flying demons.

<text>The dark-sky movement is a campaign to reduce light pollution. The advantages of reducing light pollution include an increased number of stars visible at night, reducing the effects of electric lighting on the environment, improving the well-being, health and safety of people and wildlife, and cutting down on energy usage. Earth Hour and National Dark-Sky Week are two examples of such efforts.

The movement started with professional and amateur astronomers alarmed that nocturnal skyglow from urban areas was blotting out the sight of stars. For example, the world-famous Palomar Observatory in California is threatened by sky-glow from the nearby city of Escondido and local businesses. For similar reasons, astronomers in Arizona helped push the governor there to veto a bill in 2012 which would have lifted a ban on illuminated billboards.

Nocturnal animals can be harmed by light pollution because they are biologically evolved to be dependent on an environment with a certain number of hours of uninterrupted daytime and nighttime. The over-illumination of the night sky is affecting these organisms (especially birds). This biological study of darkness is called scotobiology. Light pollution has also been found to affect human circadian rhythms.

The dark-sky movement encourages the use of full-cutoff fixtures that cast little or no light upward in public areas and generally to encourage communities to adopt lighting regulations. A 2011 project is to establish &quot;dark sky oasis&quot; in suburban areas.

== Dark-sky lighting ==
Dark-sky lighting is a concept important to the dark-sky movement, as it minimizes light pollution. The concept was started in the 1950s by the city of Flagstaff, Arizona. Flagstaff is a city of over 70,000 people, but because of its effectively controlled lighting, the skies are dark enough to see the Milky Way, and the light dome over the city viewed from some distance has been measured as less than 10% as bright as that over a similarly-sized city (Cheyenne, Wyoming) that has not sought to protect its night skies. Lights should be shielded on the top and sides so light doesn&#x27;t go up to the sky and only used when needed (use motion detectors and only the wattage necessary). To minimize the visual brightness of skyglow and reduce glare and most other biological impacts, amber-colored lighting is critical (such as formerly high- and low-pressure sodium, or now amber LED - see Skyglow#Dependence_on_light_source). The International Dark-Sky Association certifies fixtures as dark sky friendly, and these will have the IDA Fixture Seal of Approval.

== Skyglow ==
Skyglow is the illumination of the night sky or parts of it, resembling an orange &quot;smog&quot;. It occurs from both natural and human-made sources. Artificial skyglow is caused by the over-illumination of the sky from large city centres, shopping centres, or stadiums. It consists of light that is either emitted directly upward or reflected from the ground that is then scattered by dust and gas molecules in the atmosphere, producing a luminous background or light dome. These artificial skyglows cause the sky to be up to 100 times brighter in urban areas than a naturally dark sky that is unaffected by artificial light. Natural skyglow can come from natural light sources, such as the Sun, the Moon, the stars, or auroras.

Some communities are becoming aware of this problem and are putting forth efforts to minimize the hazy, orange skyglow. A community in particular is the city of Merritt, British Columbia. An article published July 8, 2010 states that they are making minor changes to lighting in and around Merritt, such as the installment of down-cast lighting to commercial buildings, as part of their light pollution abatement program. The benefits of this technological change include &quot;saving energy through better focused lights, preserving the environment by reducing excess light that may affect flora and fauna, reducing crime and increasing safety by more adequately illuminating areas, and reducing health risks.&quot;

== Scotobiology ==

Scotobiology is the study of the role darkness plays in living organisms. It shows that the interruption of darkness by light pollution creates drastic effects for most organisms, changing their food gathering and feeding habits, their mating and reproduction behavior, or their migration behavior (in birds and insects) and social behavior. Approximately 30% of vertebrates and 60% of invertebrates are nocturnal, meaning that they depend on darkness. Their everyday behaviors are biologically evolved to adapt in uninterrupted darkness.

Human health is also adversely affected by the effects of light pollution. Light during nighttime hours has been linked to human cancers and psychological disorders.

== Dark-sky preserves ==

Dark-sky preserves are the main contributors to the dark-sky movement. They are protected areas found mostly in national parks that have a zero light pollution policy set in by the government and, in the US, controlled by the National Dark Sky Association.

As of February 6, 2012, there were 35 formally recognized dark-sky preserves in the world with Canada in the lead containing 15 preserves. These preserves are located in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia. Other countries that have dark-sky preserves are the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Spain, United Kingdom, and the United States. A list of designated parks is maintained by the Dark Skies Advisory Group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

The parks are put in place by the Dark Sky Places program with the intention to remind us that the night sky serves just as much importance to our culture and history as our day-time sky.

== International Dark-Sky Association ==

The International Dark-Sky Association (IDA) began in 1988. A non-profit, it manages the Fixture Seal of Approval program, which offers a third-party rating system judging the &quot;sky-friendliness&quot; of lighting fixtures. Another prominent outreach effort is the IDA Dark Sky Places program, created after a proposal from the Flagstaff Dark Skies Coalition in 2001 and the recognition of Flagstaff as the First International Dark-Sky Community in October 2001. IDA now recognizes over 200 Dark Sky Places worldwide. In 2009, the IDA opened an office for public policy and government affairs in Washington, D.C. to inform lawmakers and lobbyists about the energy efficiency of outdoor lighting and to promote the adoption of energy-saving measures. The IDA advances dark sky awareness and protection through promotion of guidelines developed in collaboration with lighting industry partners (e.g. IESNA). The recently published (2020) Five Principles of Responsible Outdoor Lighting, are:

* Useful: Use light only if it is needed
* Targeted: Direct light so it falls only where it is needed
* Low Level: Light should be no brighter than necessary
* Control: Use light only when it is needed
* Warm -colored: Use warmer color lights where possible

<doc id="1273119" wikidata="Q438573" url="?curid=1273119" title="William Henry Vanderbilt III">
<text>William Henry Vanderbilt III (November 24, 1901April 14, 1981) was an American politician who served as Governor of Rhode Island from 1939 to 1941, and a member of the wealthy and socially prominent Vanderbilt family.

==Early life==
Vanderbilt was born in New York City on November 24, 1901. He was the son of Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt and Ellen &quot;Elsie&quot; French. Vanderbilt&#x27;s father was a great-grandson of Cornelius Vanderbilt, who founded the family fortune in railroads and shipping. William Vanderbilt&#x27;s parents divorced in 1908, and through his father&#x27;s second marriage he had two half-brothers, Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt Jr., and George Washington Vanderbilt III. In 1915, his father perished in the sinking of the . Contemporary newspaper articles reporting on the 1917 appraisal of his father&#x27;s estate state that William received a Trust Fund of $4,612,086 ($109,789,986.59 in 2023 when adjusted for inflation), a life interest in $400,000, as well as the Congressional Gold Medal presented by the 38th US Congress to William&#x27;s great-great grandfather Cornelius &#x27;the Commodore&#x27; Vanderbilt I after the US Civil War which had come to signify the Headship of the Vanderbilt Dynasty.

===Education===
Vanderbilt was educated at St. George&#x27;s School in Middletown, Rhode Island (Class of 1919) and the Evans School in Mesa, Arizona. He attended Princeton University but dropped out during his first year. In 1940, Vanderbilt received an honorary LL.D. from Bates College.

==Career==
===First World War===
Shortly before the United States declared war on Germany during the First World War, Vanderbilt dropped out of St. George&#x27;s School upon his appointment as a midshipman in the U.S. Naval Coast Defense Reserve to rank from March 20, 1917. As he was only 15 at the time, he was one of the youngest Americans to have served in the war.

During his service in the Navy, Vanderbilt served on the torpedo test ship from April 17 to May 31, 1917, the Naval Torpedo Station in Newport from June 1, 1917 to March 7, 1918, aide for information Second Naval District from March 7 to July 15, 1918, in Norfolk, Virginia from July 23 to September 16, 1918, New London, Connecticut from September 19 to November 14, 1918 and as a plank owner of the newly commissioned destroyer from November 11, 1918 to August 30, 1919. While serving on the &quot;Evans&quot;, Vanderbilt went on a cruise to Europe from June to August 1919. He was discharged from the Navy shortly after the end of the cruise, having not yet reached his 18th birthday.

===Inheritance===
When he turned 21, the then legal age of majority, in 1922, Vanderbilt inherited a $5 million trust fund plus the 450 acre (1.8 km2) Oakland Farm in Portsmouth, Rhode Island, one of his father&#x27;s estates that included a number of thoroughbred horses. He made the farm his permanent home until the end of the Second World War.

===The Short Line===
In 1925, Vanderbilt started a coach bus company, called The Short Line, carrying passengers between Newport and Providence. Within a few years he expanded the business to serve points throughout New England and New York. The Short Line was purchased by George Sage in 1955 and, in 1970, was renamed Bonanza Bus Lines. Bonanza eventually merged with the Coach USA bus line in 1998 and was sold to Peter Pan Bus Lines in 2003. The Short Line&#x27;s original terminal building in Newport still stands and is located near the intersection of Spring and Touro streets.

As a state senator and successful business leader, Vanderbilt was also a champion of the Mount Hope Bridge which connects Aquidneck Island with the mainland on the road north to Providence, Rhode Island from Newport. He was named the Chairman of the Mount Hope Bridge Commission and gave the opening address at the bridge&#x27;s dedication on October 24, 1929. When it was completed, the Mount Hope Bridge was the longest suspension bridge in New England, and one of the longest in the country.

===Political career===
Vanderbilt was a member of the Republican Party. In 1928 he was a delegate to the Republican National Convention from Rhode Island and that year was elected to the Rhode Island State Senate. Vanderbilt served in the State Senate for six years (1929–1935) and then took time off to be with his ailing wife, Anne Gordon Colby. On her recovery, he re-entered political life and successfully ran for Governor of Rhode Island in 1938. He served one two-year term from January 1939 to January 1941. His refusal to dole out patronage to fellow Republicans, however, weakened his power base, and a scandal over wire-tapping by a private detective firm he had hired to investigate election fraud, cost him re-election in 1940.

===Navy service during World War II===
In May 1941 Vanderbilt, an officer in the Naval Reserve, was called to active duty in June 1941 with the rank of lieutenant commander and initially assigned to the Panama Canal Zone. He was promoted to commander on August 15, 1942. In 1942 Vanderbilt was assigned as executive officer of the Special Operations Branch of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) under General William J. Donovan. In May 1944 he was assigned to the staff of Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, commander in chief of the Pacific Fleet, in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. He was promoted to the rank of captain prior to the end of the war.

===Later life===
After his discharge from the Navy at the end of the war, Vanderbilt left Rhode Island and retired to a farm in South Williamstown, Massachusetts. Oakland Farm and its 150 acres in Portsmouth, Rhode Island was sold to Robert R. Young and divided into housing lots by the end of the 1940s.

Vanderbilt died of cancer on April 14, 1981, at the age of 79. He was buried in the Southlawn Cemetery in Williamstown, Massachusetts. He is one of the few descendants of William Henry Vanderbilt not to be buried in the family tomb on Staten Island. His estate, filed in the Berkshire County Probate Court in April 1982, was valued at approximately $1.7 million.

==Personal life==

Vanderbilt married Emily O&#x27;Neill Davies (1903–1935), granddaughter of Daniel O&#x27;Neill, owner of the &quot;Pittsburgh Dispatch&quot; newspaper, and daughter of Frederick Martin Davies on November 1, 1923 at Grace Church, New York. Emily was the grandniece of Frederick Townsend Martin, a prominent writer of the 1920s. The couple gave birth to a daughter:

* Emily &quot;Paddy&quot; Vanderbilt (b. 1925-2024), who married Jeptha Wade, both graduates of MIT.

The couple&#x27;s marriage was troubled and Emily sued for divorce in Paris in the summer of 1926, but reconciled. She again sued for divorce in Newport, Rhode Island which was granted in June 1928. She later married Sigourney Thayer (1896–1944), for less than a year, and then Raoul Whitfield (1896–1945), shortly before her death in 1935.

On December 27, 1929, Vanderbilt married for the second time to Anne Gordon Colby (1909–1974) of West Orange, New Jersey. Together, they had three children:

* Anne Vanderbilt (1931-2014), who was married Samuel Adams Hartwell, Sr.
* Elsie Vanderbilt, who married Andre Walter George Newburg (1928–2018) in 1954 and M. Bernard Aidinoff (1929–2016) in 1996.
* William H. Vanderbilt IV (b. 1945)

This marriage also ended in divorce in 1969 after 40 years of marriage, and Vanderbilt promptly remarried the following year to Helen Cummings Cook (d. 1997), who was previously married to John R. Cook, founder of Warren Cable Co., who survived him in death.

==Awards==
For his service in the Navy, Vanderbilt was entitled to the following medals:
*World War I Victory Medal
*Naval Reserve Medal
*American Defense Service Medal with &quot;BASE&quot; clasp
*American Campaign Medal
*Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal
*World War II Victory Medal

<text>The Gallerie dell&#x27;Accademia is a museum gallery of pre-19th-century art in Venice, northern Italy. It is housed in the Scuola della Carità on the south bank of the Grand Canal, within the sestiere of Dorsoduro. It was originally the gallery of the Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia, the art academy of Venice, from which it became independent in 1879, and for which the Ponte dell&#x27;Accademia and the Accademia boat landing station for the &quot;vaporetto&quot; water bus are named. The two institutions remained in the same building until 2004, when the art school moved to the Ospedale degli Incurabili.

==History==

===Early history===

The Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia was founded on 24 September 1750; the statute dates from 1756. The first director was Giovanni Battista Piazzetta; Gianbattista Tiepolo became the first president after his return from Würzburg.

It was one of the first institutions to study art restoration starting in 1777 with Pietro Edwards, and formalised by 1819 as a course.

In 1807 the academy was re-founded by Napoleonic decree. The name was changed from Veneta Academia di Pittura, Scultura e Architettura to Accademia Reale di Belle Arti, &quot;royal academy of fine arts&quot;, and the academy was moved to the Palladian complex of the Scuola della Carità, where the Gallerie dell&#x27;Accademia are still housed. The collections of the Accademia were first opened to the public on 10 August 1817.

===Later history===
The Gallerie dell&#x27;Accademia became independent from the Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia in 1879. Like other state museums in Italy, it falls under the Ministero per i Beni e le Attività Culturali, the Italian Ministry of Culture and Heritage.

==Building==

The Napoleonic administration had disbanded many institutions in Venice including some churches, convents and Scuole. The Scuola della Carità, the Convento dei Canonici Lateranensi and the church of Santa Maria della Carità thus became the home of the Accademia. The Scuola della Carità was the oldest of the six Scuole Grandi and the building dates back to 1343, though the scuola was formed in 1260. The Convento dei Canonici Lateranensi was started in 1561 by Andrea Palladio, though it was never fully completed. The facade of Santa Maria della Carità was completed in 1441 by Bartolomeo Bon.

==Collection==


The Gallerie dell’Accademia contains masterpieces of Venetian painting up to the 19th century, generally arranged chronologically though some thematic displays are evident.

Artists represented include: Giovanni d&#x27;Alemagna, Jacopo and Leandro Bassano, Lazzaro Bastiani, Jacopo, Gentile and Giovanni Bellini, Bernardo Bellotto, Paris Bordone, Hieronymus Bosch, Canaletto, Antonio Canova, Vittore Carpaccio, Giulio Carpioni, Rosalba Carriera, Cima da Conegliano, Pietro da Cortona, Domenico Fetti, Jacobello del Fiore, Fra Galgario, Pietro Gaspari, Luca Giordano, Giovanni Antonio and Francesco Guardi, Giorgione, Francesco Hayez, Giulia Lama, Charles Le Brun, Johann Liss, Leonardo da Vinci, Pietro and Alessandro Longhi, Lorenzo Veneziano, Johann Carl Loth, Lorenzo Lotto, Francesco Maffei, Giovanni Mansueti, Andrea Mantegna, Rocco Marconi, Michele Marieschi, Hans Memling, Michele di Matteo da Bologna, Palma Vecchio and Giovane, Paolo Veneziano, Giovanni Battista Piazzetta, Piero della Francesca, Bonifacio de&#x27; Pitati, Giambattista Pittoni, Mattia Preti, Sebastiano and Marco Ricci, Benedetto Rusconi, Carlo Saraceni, Giovanni Battista and Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo, Jacopo and Domenico Tintoretto, Titian, Cosmè Tura, Paolo Veronese, Giorgio Vasari, Antonio, Bartolomeo and Alvise Vivarini, Giuseppe Zais, Francesco Zuccarelli.

The collection includes Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s drawing of the &quot;Vitruvian Man&quot;, which is displayed only rarely as the work, being on paper, is fragile and sensitive to light. In 2019, the Louvre in Paris requested the loan of the drawing for its exhibition of works by Leonardo. The request was refused by a cultural heritage group. A court tribunal in Venice, however, decided that the work would suffer no ill effects if shipped with great care and displayed under controlled conditions. The work was, therefore, part of the Louvre&#x27;s exhibition from 24 October 2019 to 24 February 2020.

<text>Tryvannstårnet (the Tryvann tower) is an 118-metre (387 feet) tall broadcasting tower near Oslo, located 529 metres (1,736 feet) above mean sea level on the summit of Tryvannshøyden hill overlooking lake Tryvann.

Tryvannstårnet was built in 1962 and has an observation deck at a height of 60 metres (197 feet), from which, weather conditions permitting, the view extends to the border with Sweden and Gaustatoppen mountain. The observation deck was closed in 2005 because of new fire safety regulations which would have required expensive modifications which coincided with rapidly declining visitor numbers. In the 1980s and 1990s annual visitor numbers averaged 100,000, but in the last year it was open to the public, only 25,000.

There is a large underground shelter beneath Tryvannstårnet.

The tower became redundant in 2018 when TV and radio broadcasting went digital, and the City of Oslo attempted to sell it, but without success. It was put on the market again in 2024, valued at somewhere between NOK14 million and NOK42 million, and on 21st January 2025 it was announced that Oslo property developer Christian Ringnes had bought the tower and the surrounding three acres of forest for NOK14 million ($1.25 million). He intends to renovate the building and reopen it as a café and restaurant complex.

<text>Execution Rocks Light is a lighthouse in the middle of Long Island Sound on the border between New Rochelle and Sands Point, New York. It stands tall, with a white light flashing every 10 seconds. The granite tower is painted white with a brown band around the middle. It has an attached stone keeper&#x27;s house which has not been inhabited since the light was automated in 1979.

== History ==
This island on which this lighthouse sits is claimed to derive its name from colonial New York, when slaveowning settlers of Sands Point murdered enslaved people by chaining them to the rocks during low tide to let them drown; this tale is first recorded by Robert Caro in 1974. A 1964 account in &quot;The Journal of Long Island History&quot; claims that in fact, murderers were manacled with chains to staples driven into the rock at low tide. A more likely etymology is that the British Admiralty named them Executioner&#x27;s Rocks because so many ships ran aground on the treacherous rocks. References to &quot;the Execution Rocks&quot; in the Long Island Sound pre-date the American Revolution, existing as far back as 1766.

On March 3, 1847, the United States Congress appropriated $25,000 for creation of Execution Rocks Lighthouse. Designed by Alexander Parris, construction was completed in 1849, although it was not lit until 1850. Over the years, it has survived both a fire and a shipwreck.

The island is under the authority of the United States Coast Guard and is off limits to the public. It can be seen, however, during the Long Island Lighthouse Society&#x27;s &quot;Spring Cold Coast Cruise&quot;, and from the Throgs Neck Bridge.

A Daboll trumpet was added to Execution Rocks Light on Jan 25, 1869.

Before being executed for murder, serial killer Carl Panzram claimed in a posthumous autobiography that in the summer of 1920 that he raped and killed a total of ten sailors and dumped their bodies at sea near Execution Rocks Light.

On November 25, 1958, Execution Rocks Light was the location of a pivotal scene in the first-season episode &quot;The Bird Guard&quot; of the television series &quot;Naked City&quot;.

On May 29, 2007, the Department of the Interior identified Execution Rocks Light Station as surplus under the National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act of 2000.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2007 as Execution Rocks Light Station. On January 27, 2009, the Secretary of the Interior announced that Execution Rocks Light would be transferred to the Philadelphia-based Historically Significant Structures, which would partner with the Science Museum of Long Island to restore the light.

== Chronology ==

A chronological history of the lighthouse from the Coast Guard:

*1847, March: Congress appropriated $25,000 for the light to be built.
*1849, May: Construction was completed.
*1850: The lighthouse was first lit.
*1856: A fourth order Fresnel lens was installed.
*1868: The keeper&#x27;s quarters were added. The keeper no longer had to live in the cramped space inside the tower.
*December 8, 1918: A fire with an unknown origin caused $13,500 in damage. The engine house and machinery were destroyed, the tower and oil house were damaged and the windows, woodwork, gutters and eaves were also damaged.
*December 5, 1979: The lighthouse was automated. A VEGA lantern replaced the Fresnel lens.
*2010: Historically Significant Structures Inc. is giving tower climb tours of the lighthouse in the summer.

<text>An atmospheric diving suit (ADS), or single atmosphere diving suit is a small one-person articulated submersible which resembles a suit of armour, with elaborate pressure joints to allow articulation while maintaining an internal pressure of one atmosphere. An ADS can enable diving at depths of up to for many hours by eliminating the majority of significant physiological dangers associated with deep diving. The occupant of an ADS does not need to decompress, and there is no need for special breathing gas mixtures, so there is little danger of decompression sickness or nitrogen narcosis when the ADS is functioning properly. An ADS can permit less skilled swimmers to complete deep dives, albeit at the expense of dexterity.

Atmospheric diving suits in current use include the Newtsuit, Exosuit, Hardsuit and the WASP, all of which are self-contained hard suits that incorporate propulsion units. The Hardsuit is constructed from cast aluminum (forged aluminum in a version constructed for the US Navy for submarine rescue); the upper hull is made from cast aluminum, while the bottom dome is machined aluminum. The WASP is of glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) body tube construction.

==Definition and classification==
An atmospheric diving suit is a small one-person submersible with articulated limbs encasing the diver. Water- and pressure-tight joints allow articulation while maintaining an internal pressure of one atmosphere. Mobility may be through thrusters for mid-water operation, though this is not a requirement, and articulated legs may be provided for walking on the substrate.

Thornton (2000) distinguishes an ADS from a submersible in that the ADS has human powered articulated limbs, as opposed to remotely operated articulated limbs. It is not clear whether this would exclude servo-assisted limbs encasing those of the operator, as a powered exoskeleton, but it might be reasonable to include them as atmospheric diving suits.

An atmospheric diving suit may be classified as a crewed submersible and a self-propelled, crewed, one-atmosphere underwater intervention device, but has also been classified as an atmospheric diving system.

== Purpose and requirements ==
The underwater environment exerts major physiological stresses on the diver, which increase with depth, and appear to impose an absolute limit to diving depth at ambient pressure. An atmospheric diving suit is a small submersible with a pressure hull which accommodates a single occupant at an internal pressure of about one atmosphere. The provision of hollow arm spaces with pressure resistant joints to carry manually operated manipulators, and usually separate leg spaces, similarly articulated for locomotion, makes a suit resemble a bulky suit of plate armour, or an exoskeleton, with elaborate joint seals to allow articulation while maintaining internal pressure.

An atmospheric diving suit is equipment intended primarily to isolate the occupant from the ambient pressure of the underwater environment, and provide any necessary life-support while the suit is in use. While using the suit, the diver will expect to perform useful work, and get to and from the place where the work is to be done. These functions require sufficient mobility, dexterity and sensory input to do the job, and this will vary depending on the details of the work. Consequently, the work possible in an atmospheric suit is limited by the suit construction.

Mobility at the surface and on deck can be managed by launch and recovery systems, Mobility underwater generally requires neutral or moderately negative buoyancy, and either the ability to walk or swim, or the use of finely controllable thrusters. Both walking and thruster propulsion have been applied with some success. Swimming has not been effective.

The dexterity to perform useful work is limited by joint mobility and geometry, inertia, and friction, and has been one of the more difficult engineering challenges. Haptic perception through manipulators is a major limitation on finer control, as the friction of the joints and seals greatly reduces the sensitivity available.

Operator visual input is relatively easy to provide directly by using transparent viewports. A wide field of view can be achieved simply and structurally effectively by using a transparent partial dome over the diver&#x27;s head. Close-up views of the manipulators are limited by joint flexibility and geometry of the suit&#x27;s arms. External sound and temperature perception are greatly attenuated, and there is no sense of touch through the suit. Communications must be provided by technology, as there is normally no-one else in the immediate vicinity.

=== Design constraints ===
The main environmental factors affecting design are the ambient hydrostatic pressure of the maximum operating depth, and ergonomic considerations regarding the potential range of operators. The structure and mechanics of the suit must reliably withstand the external pressure, without collapsing or deforming sufficiently to cause seals to leak or joints to experience excessive friction, and the full range of movement must not change the internal or external displaced volume, as this would have consequences for the amount of force required to move the joints in addition to the friction of the joint seals. Insulation is relatively simple, and can be applied to the inside of the suit and in the form of clothing on the diver. Active heating and cooling are also possible using well established technology. Mass changes can be used to provide initial and emergency buoyancy conditions by way of fixed and ditchable ballast weights.

Ergonomic considerations include the size and strength of the user. The interior dimensions must fit or be modifiable to fit a reasonable range of operators, and operating forces on joints must be reasonably practicable. The field of vision is constrained by the helmet design or viewport positioning, though closed circuit video can extend it considerably in any direction. General underwater conditions of visibility and water movement must be manageable for the range of conditions in which the suit is expected to be used. Marine thrusters may be mounted on the suit to help with maneuvering and positioning, and sonar and other scanning technologies may help provide an augmented external view.

=== Hazards and failure modes ===
The primary structural failure modes of an ADS are buckling collapse in compression, leaks, and lockup of joints. Leaks and buckling in compression both cause a reduction in buoyancy. Joint leaks and locking of articulating joints may be reversible when pressure is reduced. Electrically ignited fire is also possible.

Systems failures may include loss of power, communications, or propulsion, or life-support systems failure, such as failure of scrubbing the carbon dioxide from the breathing air, or failure of internal temperature control. Recovery from most of these would be by aborting the dive and making an emergency ascent. Bailout to emergency breathing system and ditching of ballast to establish positive buoyancy may be necessary. If the ADS is tethered it can be lifted. The most dangerous consequence is catastrophic leakage, which is likely to be fatal.

There has been one fatal incident involving an ADS in the modern era. A WASP was dropped in August 1999 due to a structural failure in a recently tested launch and recovery system, and the diver was killed by the impact with the launch platform. This is in the context of tens of thousands of operational man-hours by WASPs without serious incidents.

==Comparison with alternative technologies==

Several advantages over ambient pressure diving are claimed, but dexterity is less. There are also advantages and disadvantages in comparison with remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs):
*No decompression is required. Decompression from saturation takes approximately 1 day per 30 msw plus 1 day, during which time the divers are unproductive. This is particularly expensive when the total dive time is relatively short. 
*Consecutive dives can be made to any depths within the operating range. Saturation divers are very limited in safe excursion range from storage depth.
*Thrusters, when provided, can provide moderate mid-water and current capability.
*Manipulatory capacity and dexterity are better than ROVs. Less special tooling is required for most work. Depth perception of the diver is better than remote viewing via a ROV cameras.
*Deep applications are possible compared with ambient pressure diving. The industry accepted maximum depth for routine saturation diving is 300 msw. ADS operations can go deeper. However, ROVs and crewed submersibles can go much deeper.

For some work the most effective method can be a combination of ADS and ROV, in other cases, ADS and ambient pressure diver.

== History ==
=== Early designs ===

In 1715, British inventor John Lethbridge constructed a &quot;diving engine&quot;. Essentially a wooden barrel about in length with two holes for the diver&#x27;s arms sealed with leather cuffs, and a viewport of thick glass. It was reportedly used to dive as deep as , and was used to salvage substantial quantities of silver from the wreck of the East Indiaman , which sank in 1719 off the Cape Verde islands. A similar design made of copper was used by Jacob Rowe on the same salvage contract.

The first armored suit with real joints, designed as leather pieces with rings in the shape of a spring (also known as accordion joints), was designed by Englishman W. H. Taylor in 1838. The diver&#x27;s hands and feet were covered with leather. Taylor also devised a ballast tank attached to the suit that could be filled with water to attain negative buoyancy. While it was patented, the suit was never actually produced. It is considered that its weight and bulk would have rendered it nearly immobile underwater.

Lodner D. Phillips designed the first completely enclosed ADS in 1856. His design comprised a barrel-shaped upper torso with domed ends and included ball and socket joints in the articulated arms and legs. The arms had joints at shoulder and elbow, and the legs at knee and hip. The suit included a ballast tank, a viewing port, entrance through a manhole cover on top, a hand-cranked propeller, and rudimentary manipulators at the ends of the arms. Air was to be supplied from the surface via hose. There is no indication, however, that Phillips&#x27; suit was ever constructed.
The first properly anthropomorphic design of ADS, built by the Carmagnolle brothers of Marseilles, France in 1882, featured rolling convolute joints consisting of partial sections of concentric spheres formed to create a close fit and kept watertight with a waterproof cloth. The suit had 22 of these joints: four in each leg, six per arm, and two in the body of the suit. The helmet had 25 individual glass viewing ports spaced at the average distance of the human eyes. Weighing , the Carmagnole ADS never worked properly and its joints never were entirely waterproof. It is now on display at the French National Navy Museum in Paris.

Another design was patented in 1894 by inventors John Buchanan and Alexander Gordon from Melbourne, Australia. The construction was based on a frame of spiral wires covered with waterproof material. The design was improved by Alexander Gordon by attaching the suit to the helmet and other parts and incorporating jointed radius rods in the limbs. This resulted in a flexible suit which could withstand high pressure. The suit was manufactured by British firm Siebe Gorman and trialed in Scotland in 1898.
American designer Macduffee constructed the first suit to use ball bearings to provide joint movement in 1914; it was tested in New York to a depth of , but was not very successful. A year later, Harry L. Bowdoin of Bayonne, New Jersey, made an improved ADS with oil-filled rotary joints. The joints use a small duct to the interior of the joint to allow equalization of pressure. The suit was designed to have four joints in each arm and leg, and one joint in each thumb, for a total of eighteen. Four viewing ports and a chest-mounted lamp were intended to assist underwater vision. Unfortunately, there is no evidence that Bowdoin&#x27;s suit was ever built, or that it would have worked if it had been.

Atmospheric diving suits built by German firm Neufeldt and Kuhnke were used during the salvage of gold and silver bullion from the wreck of the British ship SS &quot;Egypt&quot;, an 8,000 ton P&amp;O liner that sank in May 1922. The suit was relegated to duties as an observation chamber at the wreck&#x27;s depth of , and was successfully used to direct mechanical grabs which opened up the bullion storage. In 1917, Benjamin F. Leavitt of Traverse City, Michigan, dived on the SS &quot;Pewabic&quot; which sank to a depth of in Lake Huron in 1865, salvaging 350 tons of copper ore. In 1923, he went on to salvage the wreck of the British schooner &quot;Cape Horn&quot; which lay in of water off Pichidangui, Chile, salvaging $600,000 worth of copper. Leavitt&#x27;s suit was of his own design and construction. The most innovative aspect of Leavitt&#x27;s suit was the fact that it was completely self-contained and needed no umbilical, the breathing mixture being supplied from a tank mounted on the back of the suit. The breathing apparatus incorporated a scrubber and an oxygen regulator and could last for up to a full hour.

In 1924 the &quot;Reichsmarine&quot; tested the second generation of the Neufeldt and Kuhnke suit to , but limb movement was very difficult and the joints were judged not to be fail-safe, in that if they were to fail, there was a possibility that the suit&#x27;s integrity would be violated. However, these suits were used by the Germans as armored divers during World War II and were later taken by the Western Allies after the war.

From 1929 to 1931 two atmospheric pressure one-person submersible &quot;suits&quot; designed by Carl Wiley were used in the successful salvage of the steamship &quot;Islander&quot; which sank in the Stevens Passage near Juneau, Alaska on 15 August 1901, with a large amount of gold dust in the cargo. The suits operated at a maximum depth of . They were each equipped with a mechanical arm with a grasping claw at the end operated from within the suit. The suits were capable of traversing a hard, reasonably smooth substrate on wheels, and were used to place the steel cables used to raise the wreck by tidal lift (with an tide range) under a catamaran barge in stages, while it was towed to shallow water. The suits had electrical power, and the diver/pilot used an oxygen rebreather. These suits have also been described as diving bells and observation chambers, as they do not match the usual definition of an atmospheric diving suit, but they were more than just observation chambers, being capable of work, and were independently mobile, so do not match the usual definition of a diving bell either. They were an unusual type of tethered crewed submersible.

In 1952, Alfred A. Mikalow constructed an ADS employing ball and socket joints, specifically for the purpose of locating and salvaging sunken treasure. The suit was reportedly capable of diving to depths of and was used successfully to dive on the sunken vessel SS &quot;City of Rio de Janeiro&quot; in of water near Fort Point, San Francisco. Mikalow&#x27;s suit had various interchangeable instruments which could be mounted on the end of the arms in place of the usual manipulators. It carried seven 90-cubic foot high pressure cylinders to provide breathing gas and control buoyancy. The ballast compartment covered the gas cylinders. For communication, the suit used hydrophones.

===The modern suit===
====Peress&#x27; &quot;Tritonia&quot;====

Although various atmospheric suits had been developed during the Victorian era, none of these suits had been able to overcome the basic design problem of constructing a joint which would remain flexible and watertight at depth without seizing up under pressure.

Pioneering British diving engineer, Joseph Salim Peress, invented the first truly usable atmospheric diving suit, the &quot;Tritonia&quot;, in 1932 and was later involved in the construction of the famous JIM suit. Having a natural talent for engineering design, he challenged himself to construct an ADS that would keep divers dry and at atmospheric pressure, even at great depth. In 1918, Peress began working for WG Tarrant at Byfleet, United Kingdom, where he was given the space and tools to develop his ideas about constructing an ADS. His first attempt was an immensely complex prototype machined from solid stainless steel.

In 1923, Peress was asked to design a suit for salvage work on the wreck of SS &quot;Egypt&quot; which had sunk in the English Channel. He declined, on the grounds that his prototype suit was too heavy for a diver to handle easily, but was encouraged by the request to begin work on a new suit using lighter materials. By 1929 he believed he had solved the weight problem, by using cast magnesium instead of steel, and had also managed to improve the design of the suit&#x27;s joints by using a trapped cushion of oil to keep the surfaces moving smoothly. The oil was virtually non-compressible and readily displaceable, which would allow the limb joints to move freely even under great pressure. Peress claimed the Tritonia suit could function at , where the pressure was , although this was never proven.

In 1930, Peress revealed the Tritonia suit. By May it had completed trials and was publicly demonstrated in a tank at Byfleet. In September Peress&#x27; assistant Jim Jarret dived in the suit to a depth of in Loch Ness. The suit performed perfectly, the joints proving resistant to pressure and moving freely even at depth. The suit was offered to the Royal Navy which turned it down, stating that Navy divers never needed to descend below . In October 1935 Jarret made a successful deep dive to more than on the wreck of the off south Ireland, followed by a shallower dive to in the English Channel in 1937 after which, due to lack of interest, the Tritonia suit was retired.

The development in atmospheric pressure suits stagnated in the 1940s through 1960s, as efforts were concentrated on solving the problems of deep diving by dealing with the physiological problems of ambient pressure diving instead of avoiding them by isolating the diver from the pressure. Although the advances in ambient pressure diving (in particular, with scuba gear) were significant, the limitations brought renewed interest to the development of the ADS in the late 1960s.

====The JIM suit====

The &quot;Tritonia&quot; suit spent about 30 years in an engineering company&#x27;s warehouse in Glasgow, where it was discovered, with Peress&#x27; help, by two partners in the British firm Underwater Marine Equipment, Mike Humphrey and Mike Borrow, in the mid-1960s. UMEL would later classify Peress&#x27; suit as the &quot;A.D.S Type I&quot;, a designation system that would be continued by the company for later models. In 1969, Peress was asked to become a consultant to the new company created to develop the JIM suit, named in honour of the diver Jim Jarret.
The first JIM suit was completed in November 1971 and underwent trials aboard in early 1972. In 1976, the JIM suit set a record for the longest working dive below , lasting five hours and 59 minutes at a depth of . The first JIM suits were constructed from cast magnesium for its high strength-to-weight ratio and weighed approximately in air including the diver. They were in height and had a maximum operating depth of . The suit had a positive buoyancy of . Ballast was attached to the suit&#x27;s front and could be jettisoned from within, allowing the operator to ascend to the surface at approximately . The suit also incorporated a communication link and a jettisonable umbilical connection. The original JIM suit had eight annular oil-supported universal joints, one in each shoulder and lower arm, and one at each hip and knee. The JIM operator received air through an oral/nasal mask that attached to a lung-powered scrubber that had a life support duration of approximately 72 hours. Operations in arctic conditions with water temperatures of for over 5 hours were successfully carried out using woolen thermal protection and neoprene boots. In water the suit was reported to be uncomfortably hot during heavy work.
As technology improved and operational knowledge grew, Oceaneering upgraded their fleet of JIMs. The magnesium construction was replaced with glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) and the single joints with segmented ones, each allowing seven degrees of motion, and when added together giving the operator a very great range of motion. In addition, the four-port domed top of the suit was replaced by a transparent acrylic dome as used on WASP, this allowed the operator a much-improved field of vision. Trials were also carried out by the Ministry of Defence on a flying Jim suit powered from the surface through an umbilical cable. This resulted in a hybrid suit with the ability of working on the sea bed as well as mid water.

In addition to upgrades to the JIM design, other variations of the original suit were constructed. The first, named the SAM Suit (designated A.D.S III), was a completely aluminium model. A smaller and lighter suit, it was more anthropomorphic than the original JIMs and was depth-rated to . Attempts were made to limit corrosion by the use of a chromic anodizing coating applied to the arm and leg joints, which gave them an unusual green color. The SAM suit stood at in height, and had a life support duration of 20 hours. Only three SAM suits would be produced by UMEL before the design was shelved. The second, named the JAM suit (designated A.D.S IV), was constructed of glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) and was depth-rated for around .

===WASP===

The WASP atmospheric diving system is part way between a one person submersible and an atmospheric diving suit, in that there are articulated arms which contain and are moved by the operator&#x27;s arms, but the operator&#x27;s legs are contained in a rigid housing. Mobility is provided by two vertical and two horizontal foot-switch controlled electrical marine thrusters. Operating depth was quoted as 

WASP is high, wide, and front to back. Ballasted weight in air approximately , for neutral buoyancy in water, but buoyancy can be increased by up to during operation, and ballast can be jettisoned in an emergency. WASP is transported on a support frame.

==Current suits==
In 1987, the &quot;Newtsuit&quot; was developed by the Canadian engineer Phil Nuytten, and a version was put into production as the &quot;Hardsuit&quot; by Hardsuits International. The Newtsuit is constructed to function like a &#x27;submarine you can wear&#x27;, allowing the diver to work at normal atmospheric pressure even at depths of over . Made of wrought aluminium, it had fully articulated joints so the diver can move more easily underwater. The life support system provides 6–8 hours of air, with an emergency back-up supply of an additional 48 hours. The Hardsuit was used to salvage the bell from the wreck of the SS &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; in 1995. The latest version of the Hardsuit designed by Oceanworks, the &quot;Quantum 2&quot;, uses higher power commercially available ROV thrusters for better reliability and more power as well as an atmospheric monitoring system to monitor the environmental conditions in the cabin.

A more recent design by Nuytten is the Exosuit, a relatively lightweight and low powered suit intended for marine research. It was first used in 2014 at the Bluewater and Antikythera underwater research expeditions.

The ADS 2000 was developed jointly with OceanWorks International and the US Navy in 1997, as an evolution of the Hardsuit to meet US Navy requirements. The ADS2000 provides increased depth capability for the US Navy&#x27;s Submarine Rescue Program. Manufactured from forged T6061 aluminum alloy it uses an advanced articulating joint design based on the Hardsuit joints. Capable of operating in up to of seawater for a normal mission of up to six hours it has a self-contained, automatic life support system. Additionally, the integrated dual thruster system allows the pilot to navigate easily underwater. It became fully operational and certified by the US Navy off southern California on August 1, 2006, when Chief Navy Diver Daniel Jackson submerged to .

From the project&#x27;s beginning until 2011, the US navy spent $113 million on the ADS.

<text>Edward Francis Gallagher (1873 – March 28, 1929) was a vaudeville actor and half of the comedy act Gallagher and Shean. Their story was told in an animated movie &quot;Mr. Gallagher and Mr. Shean&quot; (1931) by Max Fleischer and Dave Fleischer, who also created Koko the Clown and Betty Boop. Gallagher and Shean also reportedly made an early sound film at the Theodore Case studio in Auburn, New York, in 1925.

==Biography ==
Gallagher was born in 1873 in San Francisco, California.

For fifteen years, Gallagher partnered with Joe Barrett in a comedy act that was best known for military burlesques, particularly &quot;The Battle of Too Soon.&quot; Gallagher subsequently teamed with Al Shean to create the act Gallagher and Shean. While the act was successful, the men apparently did not like each other much.

Gallagher first performed with Shean in 1912 in the operetta &quot;The Rose Maid&quot;, which ran for 176 performances at the Globe Theatre in New York. The duo broke up in 1914, not performing again until 1920 and then stayed together until 1925. They had a featured part in the 1922 Ziegfeld Follies, earning a salary of US$1500 a week (approximately $ today).

His fourth wife was actress Anne Luther.

He had a nervous breakdown in 1925 and in 1927 was institutionalized at the River Crest Sanitarium in Astoria, New York, where he died on March 28, 1929. He was buried in Kensico Cemetery.

==Legacy==
Helen Gallagher, his third wife, a former Ziegfeld girl, and Jack Solomon launched what would become Gallagher&#x27;s Steak House in November 1927. She married Solomon after Gallagher&#x27;s death.

<text>Gerda &quot;Jane&quot; Bernigau (5 October 1908 – 23 March 1992) was an &quot;SS Oberaufseherin&quot; in Nazi concentration camps before and during World War II.

==Camp work==
Bernigau was born on 5 October 1908, in Sagan, Germany (now Żagań, Poland). She worked in orphanages as a young woman. 

In 1938, she joined the camp staff at the Lichtenburg early camp in eastern Germany. There, because of her willingness to get her job done, she was eventually promoted to chief wardress (&quot;Oberaufseherin&quot;) over the vast system of Gross-Rosen women&#x27;s satellite camps. In May 1939, Bernigau was sent to Ravensbrück concentration camp as a guard.

In September 1942 (or 1943), Bernigau was sent as a wardress to the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp satellite camp at Sankt Lambrecht. Bernigau was posted to the Gross-Rosen concentration camp in 1944 as chief wardress and dealt with the initial training of female guard candidates until they were dispersed out to Langenbielau/Reichenbach for completion of their course. 

She was awarded the &quot;Kriegsverdienstkreuz II. Klasse ohne Schwerter&quot; medal in 1944 for her devotion to the Third Reich and her camp services, and she had tremendous power over her subordinate female guards as well as the women prisoners in the sub-camps. In her 2008 book, &quot;A Narrow Bridge to Life&quot;, Bella Gutterman wrote: &quot;The commander of Gross-Rosen inspected the camps frequently and went on field trips to choose appropriate locations for new camps. SS Chief Supervisor Jane Bernigau did a stint in Gross-Rosen and sometimes accompanied the commander on visits that had been chosen for new camps. She also joined him in visits to camps and factories where the employment of prisoners had to be regularized.&quot;

==Evasion of justice==
In February 1945 Bernigau accompanied male SS leaders from Gross-Rosen to Reichenau, from where she fled during May 1945, and was never prosecuted for war crimes. 

After the war she lived in West Germany. According to the German historian Isabell Sprenger, Bernigau was several times interrogated by the authorities, for the last time in 1976. She died in Husum in March 1992 at the age of 83.

<text>Gana la Verde was a controversial game show which first aired in 2004 that promised the contestants (would-be immigrants to the US) legal help with getting a green card. There was a mild controversy when the advertising suggested that a green card would be the automatic prize for the victor. The events on the show, often testing a character&#x27;s stomach or willpower, were similar to &quot;Fear Factor&quot;, another controversial game show that aired at the same time.

The program played on third-party Spanish-language channels in Los Angeles, San Diego, Houston, and Dallas. The program was created by Lenard Liberman, executive vice president of Liberman Broadcasting. The show was produced and directed by Spanish-language producer Adrian Vallarino (&quot;El Show de Don Cheto&quot;) and hosted by Mexican action sports personality George X. The show wrapped production after its third season at the beginning of 2005 but re-runs were still being aired once a week as of September 2007.

<text>George Washington Vanderbilt II (November 14, 1862 – March 6, 1914) was an American art collector and member of the prominent Vanderbilt family, which amassed a huge fortune through steamboats, railroads, and various business enterprises. He commissioned the construction of a 250-room mansion, the largest privately owned home in the United States, which he named Biltmore Estate.

==Biography==
George W. Vanderbilt II was the youngest child of William Henry Vanderbilt and Maria Louisa Kissam. Though there is no evidence to suggest that he referred to himself using a numerical suffix, various sources have called him both George Washington Vanderbilt II and III. Biltmore recognizes him as George W. Vanderbilt III, because he had two uncles by that name, the first of whom died at the age of four.

As the youngest of William&#x27;s children, George was said to be his father&#x27;s favorite and his constant companion. Relatives described him as slender, dark-haired, and pale-complexioned. Shy and introverted, his interests ran to philosophy, books, and the collection of paintings in his father&#x27;s large art gallery. He acquired a private library of more than twenty thousand volumes. In addition to frequent visits to Paris, France, where several Vanderbilts kept homes, George Vanderbilt traveled extensively and became fluent in several languages.

His father owned elegant mansions in New York City and Newport, and an country estate on Long Island. When William died in 1885 of a stroke, he left a fortune of approximately $200 million, the bulk of which was split between his two elder sons, Cornelius Vanderbilt II and William K. Vanderbilt. George W. Vanderbilt had inherited $2 million from his grandfather and received another million dollars on his 21st birthday from his father. Upon his father&#x27;s death, he inherited $5 million more, as well as the income from a $5 million trust fund.

He ran the family farm at New Dorp and Woodland Beach, now the neighborhood of Midland Beach, on Staten Island, New York, where he was born, then lived with his mother in Manhattan until his own townhouse at 9 West 53rd Street was completed in 1887. The Vanderbilt family business was operated by his elder brothers. This left him time for intellectual pursuits. In 1891, he joined the New York Society of the Sons of the American Revolution. The next year Vanderbilt gifted his private gallery on 58th Street in Manhattan to the American Fine Arts Society. During the early 1900s, the Vanderbilts developed a pair of residences at 645 and 647 Fifth Avenue. George was the first owner of number 647.

==Biltmore==
Living in one or another of his family residences well into adulthood, Vanderbilt decided to construct his own country mansion and estate in 1888. For this purpose, he acquired 125,000 acres of woodland in North Carolina, employing the architect Richard Morris Hunt to design a limestone house modeled on the Chateau de Blois and other chateaux of the Loire Valley. With up to four acres of floor space, this is believed to be the largest domestic dwelling ever constructed in the United States.

At Biltmore, Vanderbilt led the life of a country gentleman. Having a great interest in horticulture and agriscience, he oversaw experiments in scientific farming, animal bloodline breeding, and silviculture (forestry). His goal was to run Biltmore as a self-sustaining estate. In 1892, Frederick Law Olmsted suggested that Vanderbilt hire Gifford Pinchot to manage the forests on the estate. According to Pinchot, who went on to be the first Chief of the United States Forest Service, Biltmore was the first professionally managed forest in the U.S. It was also the site of the Biltmore School of Forestry, the first such school in North America, established in 1898 by Dr. Carl A. Schenck.

Vanderbilt was known for his generosity toward his employees at Biltmore. Every year, he held a Christmas celebration for their children, complete with decorated tree and presents for each child, even those who could not make it to the party. He also paid all the expenses of the Cathedral of All Souls, an Episcopal cathedral he&#x27;d built and was a parishioner of, located directly across from the Biltmore Estate&#x27;s main gate in Biltmore Village (the model village he had built for those who had worked to build the Estate or were employed on the Estate), so that the church&#x27;s weekly collection could go directly to charity and outreach.

==Family==
On June 1, 1898, Vanderbilt married Edith Stuyvesant Dresser (January 17, 1873 – December 21, 1958) at the American Cathedral in Paris, France. George and Edith had one daughter together, Cornelia Stuyvesant Vanderbilt (August 22, 1900 - February 7, 1976).

In 1912, George and Edith booked passage on the doomed &quot;Titanic,&quot; but they changed their plans at the last minute via telephone, instead sailing on her sister ship, &quot;Olympic&quot;. &quot;Olympic&quot; left port before &quot;Titanic&quot;, and the Vanderbilts arrived in New York before the sinking. Accounts vary, but it has been suggested that a family member (reportedly his wife&#x27;s well-travelled sister) warned the pair from travelling on &quot;Titanic&quot;, saying, &quot;so many things can go wrong on a maiden voyage&quot;. It&#x27;s possible the warning was acknowledged and heeded. In any case, Edith, in a letter to her friend Emily Ford Skeel (sister of Paul Leicester Ford), explained: &quot;For no reason whatsoever we decided to sail on the &quot;Olympic&quot; and had only 18 hours to get ready in. We were homesick, and simply felt we must get home, and changed our ship, as I say, at the Eleventh hour!&quot; Unfortunately, however, a servant to the Vanderbilts, Frederick Wheeler, perished aboard &quot;Titanic&quot; in second class, as, due to the close timing of their switch, the Vanderbilts were forced to leave most of their luggage aboard &quot;Titanic&quot;, and so Wheeler retained his ticket to travel with it.

==Death==
Vanderbilt died of complications following an appendectomy in Washington, D.C., on March 6, 1914. He was interred in the Vanderbilt family mausoleum at the Moravian Cemetery in New Dorp in Staten Island, New York.

He died from a pulmonary embolus, 
a blood clot in the lungs, about 10 days after surgery.

==Legacy==

After his death, Vanderbilt&#x27;s widow sold approximately of the Biltmore property to the United States Forest Service at $5 an acre, fulfilling her husband&#x27;s wishes to create the core of Pisgah National Forest. She sold additional land as finances demanded; today, about remain. Edith Dresser Vanderbilt later married Peter Goelet Gerry (1879–1957), a United States Senator from Rhode Island.

The Vanderbilts&#x27; only child, Cornelia Stuyvesant Vanderbilt, married a British aristocrat, the Hon. John Francis Amherst Cecil (a descendant of William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley) in 1924. Their sons, George and William, eventually inherited the property. George Cecil, the elder of the two sons, chose to inherit the majority of the estate&#x27;s land and the Biltmore Farms Company, which was more profitable than the house at the time. The younger son, William Cecil, was thus left with Biltmore House, and he is credited with preserving the chateau which (though still privately owned) is open to the public.

<doc id="1273170" wikidata="Q1141986" url="?curid=1273170" title="Otocinclus">
<text>Otocinclus is a genus of catfish in the family Loricariidae native to South America, commonly known as &quot;dwarf suckers&quot; or &quot;otos&quot;. This genus, like other loricariids, is characterized by rows of armour plating covering the body, as well as the underslung suckermouth. They are generally small in size; &quot;O. tapirape&quot; is the smallest of the species (2.4 cm), while &quot;O. flexilis&quot; is the biggest (5.5 cm). These species have adaptations that allow them to breathe air. A duct forms at the junction between the esophagus and the stomach and expands into an enlarged, ring-like diverticulum, characteristic of this genus, which allows air-breathing. &quot;Otocinclus&quot; are popular aquarium fish, and they are often purchased as algae eaters. It is difficult to breed them in captivity, and only wild caught &quot;Otocinclus&quot; are available to hobbyists. This genus is widely distributed east of the Andes of South America, throughout the lowlands from northern Venezuela to northern Argentina, but are generally absent from the Amazon and the Orinoco lowlands.

==Etymology==
The &quot;Otocinclus&quot; name is derived from the Greek &quot;oto&quot;, meaning ear and the Latin &quot;cinclus&quot;, meaning a latticework, an allusion to the holes in the head in the region of the ear.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Otocinclus&quot; is the most basal genus of the tribe Hypoptopomatini of the subfamily Hypoptopomatinae. However, phylogenetic relationships are currently under study and this genus may eventually be relocated. Its monophyly is supported by seven derived features. &quot;O. batmani&quot;, &quot;O. bororo&quot;, &quot;O cocama&quot;, &quot;O. huaorani&quot;, &quot;O. mariae&quot; and &quot;O. mura&quot; form a monophyletic group within this genus. A monophyletic group is also formed by &quot;O. flexilis&quot;, &quot;O. mimulus&quot; and &quot;O. xakriaba&quot;, which all share mimicry as a synapomorphy.

==Species==
There are currently 19 recognized species in this genus:

*&quot;Otocinclus arnoldi&quot; 
* &quot;Otocinclus batmani&quot; 
* &quot;Otocinclus bororo&quot; 
* &quot;Otocinclus caxarari&quot; 
* &quot;Otocinclus cocama&quot; 
* &quot;Otocinclus flexilis&quot; 
* &quot;Otocinclus hasemani&quot; 
* &quot;Otocinclus hoppei&quot; 
* &quot;Otocinclus huaorani&quot; 
* &quot;Otocinclus juruenae&quot; 
* &quot;Otocinclus macrospilus&quot; 
* &quot;Otocinclus mangaba&quot; 
* &quot;Otocinclus mariae&quot; 
* &quot;Otocinclus mimulus&quot; 
* &quot;Otocinclus mura&quot; 
* &quot;Otocinclus tapirape&quot; 
* &quot;Otocinclus vestitus&quot; 
* &quot;Otocinclus vittatus&quot; 
* &quot;Otocinclus xakriaba&quot; 

&quot;Macrotocinclus affinus&quot; was considered to be a member of &quot;Otocinclus&quot; until it was moved to its own monotypic genus, &quot;Macrotocinclus&quot;. The name &quot;Otocinclus affinus&quot; is still used in the aquarium trade, however it actually refers to members of &quot;O. vittatus&quot;, &quot;O. vestitus&quot; and &quot;O. macrospilus.&quot; and &quot;O. huaorani&quot;.

==Ecology==
Species of this genus are diurnal and generally are found in small streams or along the margins of larger rivers, clinging to substrates using their suckermouth. The fish of this genus primarily feed on algae or aufwuchs on roots, stones, macrophytes and broad-leaved grasses. They inhabit well-oxygenated, moderate- to slow-flowing environments, often near river banks. They are found near the surface of the water, but are often associated with vegetation or other structures. They lay adhesive eggs and do not guard them; this is in contrast to many other loricariids where the male builds a nest and guards the eggs. These fish live in shoals or schools. &quot;Otocinclus&quot; are able to breathe air. Prior to surfacing, they will release air through their gills and mouth. Upon returning to the bottom, the fish do not need to pump their buccal cavities, indicating they are absorbing oxygen from the swallowed air.

&quot;O. flexilis&quot;, &quot;O. mimulus&quot; and &quot;O. xakriaba&quot; are considered to be Batesian mimics of certain &quot;Corydoras&quot; species (&quot;C. diphyes&quot;, &quot;C. garbei&quot;, &quot;C. nattereri&quot; and &quot;C. paleatus&quot;, respectively). These &quot;Corydoras&quot; species have bony plates of armor and strong spines as defenses, making them less palatable; by mimicking these species in size and coloration, &quot;Otocinclus&quot; spp. avoid predation.

<doc id="1273177" wikidata="Q1451366" url="?curid=1273177" title="Concrete Rose">
<text>Concrete Rose is the fourth studio album by American singer Ashanti, released on December 14, 2004, by The Inc. Records and Def Jam Recordings. In addition to working with frequent collaborators Irv Gotti, Chink Santana, and 7 Aurelius, Ashanti also enlisted new collaborators Malcolm Flythe, Jimi Kendrix, and Demi-Doc, to assist. The album features guest appearances from rappers T.I., Ja Rule, and Lloyd.

The album debuted at number seven on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the United States, with first-week sales of 254,000 units. Outside the United States, the album was less successful, with its strongest ranking being in the top 20 in Japan and the top 30 of the UK Albums Chart. Critical reception to the project was mixed, with most deeming the album unoriginal. Nonetheless, the album did receive a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and gained gold status in Japan and the United Kingdom.

&quot;Concrete Rose&quot; was preceded by lead single &quot;Only U&quot;, which received positive reviews and reached the top-twenty in several countries. The album and its promotion was vastly overshadowed by the legal troubles that faced The Inc. and Gotti, who was arrested on money laundering charges only a month after &quot;Concrete Rose&quot;″s release. As a result, Def Jam severed ties with The Inc. in May 2005, and refused to promote the album&#x27;s second single &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Them&quot;, which only charted moderately in Ireland and the United Kingdom.

== Background ==
Following the success of her sophomore studio album &quot;Chapter II&quot;, Ashanti confirmed in November 2003 that she had begun planning her third studio album, due to be out in mid-2004. In February 2004, Ashanti said the album had &quot;a new sound, a new flavor&quot;, and said she wanted &quot;to touch on more topics that I didn&#x27;t touch on with the first and the second record.&quot; She also confirmed that she had already recorded three songs for the album. By July, Ashanti confirmed she had already finished the record, and planned its release for November.

== Singles and promotion ==
The song &quot;Turn It Up&quot;, featuring rapper Ja Rule, was initially released as the lead single off the album. However, it was downscaled to a buzz single after The Inc. decided to release &quot;Only U&quot; as &quot;Concrete Rose&quot;″s lead single instead. The song, released on October 26, 2004, reached the top ten of several countries, including Ireland (#4), Japan (#), and the United Kingdom (#2); the song also reached the top twenty in Germany (#12), New Zealand (#14), Switzerland (#12), and the United States (#13).

The album was largely overshadowed by the legal issues surrounding Murder Inc./The Inc. and its head, Irv Gotti. In January 2003, during recording of &quot;Chapter II&quot;, the offices Murder Inc. were raided during an investigation into Gotti&#x27;s ties to gangster Kenneth McGriff. In November, Murder Inc. changed its name to The Inc., in an attempt to distance the company from its several controversies. Between November 2004 and January 2005, Gotti, McGriff, and several employees and associates of The Inc. were arrested on charges of money laundering, racketeering, and murder, regarding to the killing of rapper E-Money Bags. In April 2005, Ashanti chose &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Them&quot; to be the second single from the album. The single failed to chart in the United States; however, charted moderately well in Ireland (#41) and the United Kingdom (#38).

== Critical reception ==

&quot;Concrete Rose&quot; received mixed reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 47, based on 10 reviews, which indicates &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews. Andy Kellman from Allmusic found that &quot;disregarding the ill-suited standards, an Ashanti album is always good for a handful of strong singles, as &quot;Concrete Rose&quot; helps indicate [...] it&#x27;s no better or worse than her 2002 debut or 2003&#x27;s &quot;Chapter II&quot;, with the standout singles, decent album cuts, and filler fluff provided in equal doses.&quot; &quot;USA Today&quot; journalist Steve Jones found that with &quot;Concrete Rose&quot; Ashanti &quot;sticks closely to her usual formula of engaging beats and airy vocals [...] Still, she is consistent enough to make this &quot;Rose&quot; bloom full time.&quot; Nicholas Tayor from PopMatters called the album &quot;a decent, 54-minute collection of mostly mid-tempo tracks by a decent R&amp;B singer.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; noted that &quot;a more confident-sounding Ashanti is onboard for her third time out. Powered by sensual lead single &quot;Only You,&quot; &quot;Concrete Rose&quot; contains several other equally rhythmic jams.&quot;

Hattie Collins, writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, found that &quot;Ashanti doesn&#x27;t stray from the R&amp;B rulebook that has so far seen her sell some 7m albums in the US alone – namely a hip-hop backdrop of hard-knock beats tempered by a soul-lite vocal [...] A lack of originality and too much filler mark Ashanti more as a pedestrian than the princess she purports to be.&quot; Steve Appleford from the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that Ashanti and &quot;Concrete Rose&quot; sound &quot;trapped, sapped of strength and ideas, and buried beneath all the worst cold and calculated production tendencies of her label [...] What follows is modern R&amp;B; formula at its most flat and uninspired. For all her lovesick panting, pleading and purring, Ashanti is never emotionally engaged with the songs, which aren&#x27;t worth the trouble anyway.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Raymond Fiore remarked that &quot;the thin-voiced vixen&#x27;s third disc bruises both genres with a slew of mostly midtempo clunkers built with her weapons of choice: faux grit and forced sensuality.&quot; In his review for &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;, Sal Cinquemani wrote: &quot;Ashanti is incapable of doing slinky or sexy and, despite her incessant attempts at vamping, she can&#x27;t all-out sing either – she&#x27;s even upstaged by a Hammond organ.&quot;

== Chart performance ==
During the week of Christmas, &quot;Concrete Rose&quot; debuted at number seven on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with first-week sales of 254,000 units. On the Top R&amp;B/Hip Hop Albums chart the album debuted at number two where it spent a total of 28 consecutive weeks on the chart. On January 14, 2005, the album was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for one million shipped units. By April 2008, the album had sold 871,000 copies, according to Nielsen Soundscan. In total, it remained on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart for 20 consecutive weeks.

Elsewhere, &quot;Concrete Rose&quot; debuted or peaked at number 16 in Japan, number 25 in the United Kingdom, number 36 in Germany, and number 65 in Canada. In Japan, the album was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ). In the United Kingdom, it also peaked at number four on the UK R&amp;B Albums chart and was eventually certified Gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI).

<doc id="1273179" wikidata="Q767054" url="?curid=1273179" title="Royal Christmas message">
<text>The King&#x27;s Christmas message (or The Queen&#x27;s Christmas message in a queen&#x27;s reign), formally as His Majesty&#x27;s Most Gracious Speech, and informally as the Royal Christmas message) is a broadcast made by the sovereign of the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms to the Commonwealth of Nations each year at Christmas. The tradition began in 1932 with a radio broadcast by King George V via the British Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s Empire Service. The message is broadcast on television, radio, and the Internet via various providers. It is usually broadcast at 15:00 GMT on Christmas Day. Unlike some other speeches, such as the King&#x27;s Speech at the State Opening of Parliament which is written by the government, the Christmas speech is a personal message written by the monarch with input from spouses and direct advisors.

==History==

The idea for a Christmas message from the sovereign to the British Empire was first proposed by the founding director-general of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), John Reith, in 1922 when he approached King George V about making a short broadcast on the newly created radio service. The King declined, however, believing that radio was mainly an entertainment. Reith approached the King again ten years later, in 1932, as a way to inaugurate the Empire Service (now the World Service) and the King finally agreed after being encouraged to do so by Queen Mary and Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald. That year, King George V read the first Royal Christmas message, which was scripted by Rudyard Kipling; the King was originally hesitant about using the relatively untested medium of radio, but was reassured after a summertime visit to the BBC and agreed to carry out the concept and read the speech from a temporary studio set up at Sandringham House. The 1934 Christmas broadcast was introduced from Ilmington Manor by 65-year-old Walton Handy, a local shepherd, with carols from the church choir and the bells ringing from the town church, and reached an estimated 20 million people in Australia, Canada, India, Kenya, South Africa and the United Kingdom.

While his brother, King Edward VIII, abdicated just before his first Christmas as king, King George VI continued his father&#x27;s Christmas broadcasts; it was in his 1939 reading delivered in the opening stages of the Second World War that he uttered the famous lines: &quot;I said to the man who stood at the Gate of the Year, &#x27;Give me a light that I may tread safely into the unknown.&#x27; And he replied, &#x27;Go out into the darkness, and put your hand into the Hand of God. That shall be to you better than light, and safer than a known way.&#x27;&quot;

For many years, the King&#x27;s speech came at the end of an hour-long broadcast of greeting from various parts of the British Empire and Commonwealth which typically included interviews with ordinary people of many occupations such as an innkeeper in an English village, a miner in South Africa, and a lifeguard in Australia with the King&#x27;s speech serving as a bond tying the Commonwealth together.
King George VI&#x27;s daughter and successor, Queen Elizabeth II, delivered her first Christmas message from her study at Sandringham House, at 3:07 PM on 25 December 1952, approximately ten months after her father&#x27;s death. Five years later, the message was broadcast on television for the first time. It has been an annual television broadcast every year since, with the exception of 1959 and 1963 when the Queen was heavily pregnant; and 1969: that year, no message was given because a special documentary film, &quot;Royal Family&quot;, had been produced during the summer in connection with the investiture of the Prince of Wales. It was therefore decided not to do a broadcast at Christmas, but the Queen issued a written message instead.

Until 1996, the Christmas broadcast was always produced by the BBC; the monopoly was ended when it was announced that, from 1997, the message would be produced and broadcast alternately by the BBC and its main rival, Independent Television News (ITN), with a biennial rotation. It was reported by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; that this decision was made after the BBC decided to screen an interview with Diana, Princess of Wales, on its current affairs programme &quot;Panorama&quot;. This was denied by Buckingham Palace which said the new arrangements &quot;reflect the composition of the television and radio industries today&quot;. Beginning in 2011, Sky News was added to the rotation.

Sky News recorded the Queen&#x27;s Christmas message for Christmas 2012, the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee year, and for the first (and only) time it was recorded in 3D. Buckingham Palace was reported to have stated: &quot;We wanted to do something a bit different and special in this Jubilee year, so doing it for the first time in 3D seemed a good thing, technology wise, to do.&quot;

Under the reign of Queen Elizabeth II, the themes and direction of the speeches were decided by the Queen and the text was largely written by the Queen herself, sometimes with assistance from her husband Prince Philip and her staff. In the later years of her reign, the speeches became more personal and religious in tone. Her son and successor, King Charles III, reportedly writes the script of his Christmas messages himself without input from staff.

Traditionally, the message begins with the British national anthem &quot;God Save the King&quot; (or &quot;Queen&quot;), (except for 1968, 1986–2000, 2002, and 2007 in which it ended the message).

==Broadcast==

The message typically combines a chronicle of that year&#x27;s major events, with specific focus on the Commonwealth of Nations, and with the sovereign&#x27;s own personal milestones and feelings on Christmas. It is one of the few instances when the sovereign speaks publicly without advice from any ministers of the Crown in any of the monarch&#x27;s realms. Planning for each year&#x27;s address begins months earlier, when the monarch establishes a theme and appropriate archival footage is collected and assembled; the actual speech is recorded a few days prior to Christmas.

Timing:

* On the internet, as in the United Kingdom, broadcast of the King&#x27;s Christmas message is embargoed until 15:00 GMT on 25 December.
* New Zealand is the first country in the Commonwealth to broadcast the message over the airwaves, at 18:06 local time (5:06 am GMT) by Radio New Zealand on RNZ National, then again at 18:50 by Television New Zealand on TVNZ1.
* In Australia, the message is broadcast by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation at 15:20 local time (5:20 am to 8:20 am GMT, depending on the time zone).
* In Canada, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation broadcasts the message generally at noon local time on CBC Television (3:30 pm to 8 pm GMT depending on the time zone), and at 11:50 am local time on CBC Radio One and CBC Music. Some private stations such as CTV also carry the speech.
* Outside of the Commonwealth, C-SPAN in the United States airs the King&#x27;s message at times that vary depending on the network&#x27;s schedule. No American radio station airs the broadcast, although some areas bordering Canada can receive it via the CBC.

=== Other Christmas messages ===

In the past, the Governor of Hong Kong, as the representative of the British monarch, played this role; the tradition was carried on by the Chief Executive of Hong Kong upon the territory&#x27;s transfer of sovereignty to China in 1997.

In 1931, Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands delivered her first Christmas message on the airwaves, which was also broadcast to the Dutch East Indies, Suriname and the other Dutch West Indies via shortwave radio station PCJJ. During the reign of her daughter Juliana, the Royal Christmas message was to become an annual tradition.

Heads of state of other countries have adopted the tradition of a message at Christmas, including the King of Sweden, the King of the Belgians, the Grand Duke of Luxembourg, the Prince of Liechtenstein, the President of Germany, and the King of Spain. The Pope makes a Christmas address as part of his &quot;Urbi et Orbi&quot;.

The President of the United States also gives out Christmas messages as part of the President&#x27;s Weekly Address. Some of these messages come out within a few days before Christmas or on Christmas Day. The president may also give a Christmas message to soldiers serving in the U.S. Armed Forces. The opposition party may also give out their Christmas messages as part of their response to the President&#x27;s weekly address. In addition, beginning in 1986, US President Ronald Reagan and Soviet Union general secretary Mikhail Gorbachev exchanged televised New Year&#x27;s Day addresses to the other&#x27;s respective nations. This exchange continued between President George H. W. Bush and Gorbachev until the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

The Prime Minister of Canada records a short Christmas greeting.

=== New Year messages ===

Others have modified the practice by issuing a statement to coincide with the New Year; this is done by the British Prime Minister, who issues a New Year message which extensively reflects on the last year and the government&#x27;s intentions in the new year. The Archbishop of Canterbury, spiritual leader of the Anglican Communion, also gives a speech on New Year&#x27;s Day.

Foreign leaders also carrying this tradition include:

* the Governors-General of Canada, Jamaica, and New Zealand;
* the King of Denmark, the King of Norway, the Emperor of Japan, the Prince of Monaco, the King of Thailand, and the Sultan of Brunei;
* the Presidents of Cameroon, China, Finland, France, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Ivory Coast, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Senegal, and the Russian Federation;
* the Chancellor of Germany and the Prime Ministers of Denmark and Iceland.

The Yang di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia makes speeches on his official birthday in June and on National Heroes Day in July, while the Prime Minister of Malaysia also makes speeches not only on New Year&#x27;s Day but also on the night of Eid ul-Fitr and on the eve of Independence Day. The Prime Minister of Singapore addresses the nation on the country&#x27;s national day.

The King of Morocco makes speeches on the anniversaries of his accession (Throne Day), the Revolution of the King and the People and the Green March.

<text>Scaphites is a genus of heteromorph ammonites belonging to the Scaphitidae family. They were a widespread genus that thrived during the Late Cretaceous period.

==Morphology==
&quot;Scaphites&quot; generally have a chambered, boat-shaped shell. The initial part (juvenile stage) of the shell is generally more or less involute (tightly coiled) and compressed, giving no hint of the heteromorphic shell form yet to come. The terminal part (adult stage) is much shorter, erect, and bends over the older shell like a hook. They have transverse, branching ribs with tubercles (small bumps) along the venter.

Reconstructions of the body within the shell can be made to portray &quot;Scaphites&quot; as either a benthic (bottom-dwelling) or planktonic animal, depending on where the center of gravity is located. Since useful fossils of the soft-body parts of cephalopods are highly rare, little is known about how this animal actually fit into its shell and lived its life.

==Age==
Because &quot;Scaphites&quot; and its relatives in the superfamily Scaphitoidea are restricted to certain ages of the Cretaceous (&quot;ca.&quot; 144 to 66.4 million years ago), they are useful in some areas as an index fossil. A notable example is the Late Cretaceous Western Interior Seaway in North America, in which several endemic lineages of scaphite species evolved and now serve as the basis for a highly resolved regional biostratigraphy.

== Species ==

* &quot;Scaphites uintensis&quot; † 
* &quot;Scaphites warreni&quot; † 
* &quot;Scaphites whitfieldi&quot; † 

== Distribution ==
Fossils of &quot;Scaphites&quot; have been found in Antarctica, Armenia, Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada (Alberta, British Columbia, Northwest Territories), Denmark, France, Germany, Greenland, India, Italy, Japan, Madagascar, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and the United States (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Kansas, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Wyoming).

<text>Harold Stirling Vanderbilt CBE (July 6, 1884 – July 4, 1970) was an American railroad executive, a champion yachtsman, an innovator and champion player of contract bridge, and a member of the Vanderbilt family.

==Early life==
He was born in Oakdale, New York, the third child of William Kissam Vanderbilt and Alva Erskine Smith. To family and friends he was known as &quot;Mike&quot;. His siblings were William Kissam Vanderbilt II and Consuelo Vanderbilt.

His maternal grandfather was Murray Forbes Smith. As the great-grandson of the shipping and railroad tycoon Cornelius Vanderbilt, he was born to great wealth and privilege; as a child he was raised in Vanderbilt mansions, traveled frequently to Europe, and sailed the world on yachts owned by his father. His nephew, Barclay Harding Warburton III, founded the American Sail Training Association.

Vanderbilt was educated by tutors and at private schools in Massachusetts, including St. Mark&#x27;s School, Harvard College (AB 1907), and Harvard Law School, which he attended from 1907 to 1910.

==Career==
After Harvard Law, he joined the New York Central Railroad, the centerpiece of his family&#x27;s vast railway empire, of which his father was president.

On his father&#x27;s death in 1920, Harold inherited a fortune that included the Idle Hour country estate at Oakdale, New York (on Long Island) and equity in several railway companies, including Detroit, Toledo &amp; Milwaukee Railroad, the Genesee Falls Railway, the Kanawha and Michigan Railway, the Kanawha and West Virginia Railroad, the New Jersey Junction Railroad, the New York Central Railroad, the New York and Harlem Railroad and the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad.

Following the death of his brother William in 1944, he remained the only active representative of the Vanderbilt family involved with the New York Central Railroad. He served as a director and member of the executive committee until 1954, when the New York Central was subjected to a hostile takeover by business tycoon Robert R. Young. Young committed suicide four years later.

===World War I===

Vanderbilt nearly lost his yacht, the &quot;Vagrant&quot;, on Britain&#x27;s entry into the First World War. The British competitor for the 1914 America&#x27;s Cup, &quot;Shamrock IV&quot;, was crossing the Atlantic with the steam yacht &quot;Erin&quot;, destined for Bermuda, when Britain declared war on Germany on August 5, 1914. The British crews received word of the declaration of war by radio. As the commodore of the New York Yacht Club, Vanderbilt sent the &quot;Vagrant&quot; from Rhode Island to Bermuda to meet the &quot;Shamrock IV&quot; and &quot;Erin&quot;, and to escort them to the US. Meanwhile, among the first things done in Bermuda on the declaration was to remove all maritime navigational aids. The &quot;Vagrant&quot; arrived on the 8th. Having no radio, the crew were unaware of the declaration of war and finding all of the buoys and other navigational markers missing, they attempted to pick their own way in through the Narrows, the channel that threads through the barrier reef. This took them directly to the fore of St. David&#x27;s Battery, where the gunners were on a war footing and opened fire. This was just a warning shot, which had the desired effect. The &quot;Shamrock IV&quot; and &quot;Erin&quot; arrived the next day. The America&#x27;s Cup was cancelled for that year.

In March 1917, Vanderbilt was commissioned a lieutenant (junior grade) in the United States Naval Reserve. When the United States entered World War I, he was called to active duty on April 9, 1917, and assigned as commanding officer of the scout patrol boat USS &quot;Patrol No. 8&quot; (SP-56), which operated out of Newport, Rhode Island. He was reassigned on July 20 to command the Block Island, Rhode Island, anti-submarine sector and on November 17 the New London, Connecticut, sector. While at Block Island, one of his subordinates was Chief Machinist Mate Harold June who would go on to serve as a pilot with Commander (later admiral) Richard E. Byrd&#x27;s 1929 Antarctic Expedition. June was one of four men who were aboard the first aircraft to fly over the South Pole. Upon Vanderbilt&#x27;s reassignment, the officers and men of the Block Island sector presented him with an engraved naval officer&#x27;s sword as a token of their esteem. The sword is now displayed at the Marble House in Newport.

On July 17, 1918, he was reassigned to the US Navy forces in Europe and reported to Submarine Chaser Detachment 3 at Queenstown, Ireland, in August. He served with Detachment 3 until the unit was disbanded on November 25, 1918 – shortly after the Armistice was signed. He was placed on inactive duty December 30, 1918, and was promoted to lieutenant on February 26, 1919, retroactive to September 21, 1918. He was discharged from the Naval Reserve on March 26, 1921.

===Sailing career===
As a boy, Harold Vanderbilt spent part of his summers at the Vanderbilt mansions—the Idle Hour estate in Long Island, New York, on the banks of the Connetquot River; Marble House at Newport, Rhode Island; and later at Belcourt, the Newport mansion of his stepfather, Oliver Belmont. As an adult, he pursued his interest in yachting, winning six King&#x27;s Cups and five Astor Cups at regattas between 1922 and 1938. He served as commodore of the New York Yacht Club from 1922 to 1924. In 1925, he built his own luxurious vacation home at Palm Beach, Florida, that he called &quot;El Solano&quot;. (John Lennon, formerly of the Beatles, purchased it shortly before his 1980 murder.)

Vanderbilt achieved the pinnacle of yacht racing in 1930 by defending the America&#x27;s Cup in the J-class yacht &quot;Enterprise&quot;. His victory put him on the cover of the September 15, 1930, issue of &quot;Time&quot; magazine (see image above). In 1934 Harold faced a dangerous challenger from the United Kingdom, &quot;Endeavour&quot;, owned by the aviation pioneer and industrialist Thomas Sopwith. &quot;Endeavour&quot; won the first two races but Vanderbilt&#x27;s &quot;Rainbow&quot; then won four races in a row and successfully defended the Cup. In 1937 he won again in &quot;Ranger&quot;, the last of the J-class yachts to defend the Cup. He was posthumously elected to the America&#x27;s Cup Hall of Fame in 1993.

In the fall of 1935, Harold began a study of the yacht racing rules with three friends: Philip Roosevelt, president of the North American Yacht Racing Union (predecessor to US Sailing); Van Santvoord Merle-Smith, president of the Yacht Racing Association of Long Island Sound; and Henry H. Anderson. &quot;The four men began by attempting to take the right-of-way rules as they were and amending them. After about six weeks of intensive effort, they finally concluded that they were getting exactly nowhere. It was the basic principles, not the details, that were causing the problems. They would have to start from scratch.&quot;

In 1936, Vanderbilt, with assistance from the other three had developed an alternative set of rules, printed them, and mailed a copy to every yachtsman that he knew personally or by name in both the United States and England. These were virtually ignored, but a second edition in 1938 was improved, as were following versions. Vanderbilt continued to work with the various committees of the North American Yacht Racing Union until finally in 1960 the International Yacht Racing Union (predecessor to the International Sailing Federation or ISAF) adopted the rules that Vanderbilt and the Americans had developed over the previous quarter century.

===Bridge===
Vanderbilt was also a card game enthusiast. In 1925, while on board SS &quot;Finland&quot;, he originated changes to the scoring system through which the game of contract bridge supplanted auction bridge in popularity. Three years later he endowed the Vanderbilt Cup awarded to the winners of the North American championship (now the Vanderbilt Knockout Teams, or simply &quot;the Vanderbilt&quot;, one of the North American Bridge Championships marquee events). In 1932, and again in 1940, he was part of a team that won his own trophy; it remains one of the most prized in the game. Vanderbilt also donated the World Bridge Federation Vanderbilt Trophy, awarded from 1960 to 2004 to the winner of the open category at the quadrennial World Team Olympiad, and since 2008 to the winner of the corresponding event at the World Mind Sports Games.

Vanderbilt invented the first , which he called the &quot;Club Convention&quot; but which has since become more usually known as the Vanderbilt Club. The strong club, or forcing club, family of has performed exceptionally well in world championship play. He wrote four books on the subject.

Vanderbilt, Ely Culbertson, and Charles Goren were the three people named when &quot;The Bridge World&quot; inaugurated a bridge &quot;hall of fame&quot; in 1964 and they were made founding members of the ACBL Hall of Fame in 1995.

In 1969, the World Bridge Federation (WBF) made Vanderbilt its first honorary member. In 1969, he became a WBF Honorary Member, and was inducted into the ACBL Hall of Fame in 1964.In 1941, he was made ACBL Honorary Member of the Year and won the Wetzlar Trophy in 1940.

He won the North American Bridge Championships twice and the Vanderbilt twice, the first in 1932 and the last in 1940. He was a runner-up at the North American Bridge Championships and during the Vanderbilt in 1937.

===Later life===
In 1930, after a property dispute with the Town of Palm Beach, Florida, Vanderbilt moved several miles south to an undeveloped area called Manalapan, where he purchased 500 feet of oceanfront property and built a mansion called Eastover. In 1931, he filed papers to incorporate the Town of Manalapan and became the Town&#x27;s first mayor, serving from 1952 until 1966. He was a town councilman for 32 years and was called &quot;mayor emeritus&quot; when he retired from public service. In 1934, his sister, Consuelo Vanderbilt Balsan, built her own mansion on Hypoluxo Island, across the water from Eastover.

In addition to sailing, Vanderbilt was a licensed pilot, and in 1938 he acquired a Sikorsky S-43 &quot;Flying Boat&quot;.

At the outbreak of the Second World War, Vanderbilt&#x27;s yachts &quot;Vagrant&quot; and &quot;Vara&quot;, which was under construction, were seized by the United States Navy. The &quot;Vagrant&quot; was designated as YP-258 and later as PYc-30. Navy official Edmond J. Moran met with Vanderbilt in New York, to present him with a check for $300,000 as compensation for the &quot;Vara&quot;. Upon receiving the check, Vanderbilt signed it over to the USO, so the money could be used to benefit servicemen. The &quot;Vara&quot; was completed, renamed as the USS &quot;Valiant&quot;, and designated as PC-509 (later as PYc-51).

==Personal life==
Vanderbilt married Gertrude Lewis Conaway, of Philadelphia, in 1933. They had no children.

==Death and burial==
Harold Stirling Vanderbilt died on July 4, 1970. Ironically, this was only two weeks after the Penn Central Railroad, successor to the New York Central Railroad, had declared bankruptcy (on June 21, 1970). He and his wife are interred at Saint Mary&#x27;s Episcopal Cemetery in Portsmouth, Rhode Island, their graves marked with only simple flat stones. It is uncertain why he chose to be buried in Rhode Island rather than in the Vanderbilt family mausoleum on Staten Island. It is noteworthy, however, that he is buried in the same cemetery as his business rival Robert R. Young.

==Legacy==

Harold Vanderbilt had a keen interest in the success of Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, founded in 1873 through the financial sponsorship of his great-grandfather. A longtime member of the university&#x27;s Board of Trust, he served as its president between 1955 and 1968. He helped guide the institution through a time in history when racial integration of the student body was a divisive and explosive issue. In 1962, Vanderbilt attended one of the first meetings of the Vanderbilt Sailing Club and provided funding for the club to purchase its first fleet of dinghies, Penguins. The university annually offers several scholarships named in his honor, and on the grounds in front of Buttrick Hall, an approximately sixteen foot tall statue of Vanderbilt, designed by sculptor Joseph Kiselewski, was erected in his honor in 1965.

In 1947, Vanderbilt was invested as an honorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) by King George VI. The letters patent conferring the honor on him (signed by Queen Mary in her capacity as grand master of the order) and the insignia of the order are on display in the Trophy Room at the Marble House summer estate in Newport, Rhode Island.

In 1963, Vanderbilt assisted the Preservation Society of Newport County in acquiring Marble House in Newport, Rhode Island, which his mother had sold more than 30 years earlier. Their bid was successful, and the property was converted into a museum that has been open to the public since the mid-1960s and holds documents and artifacts related to his life.

A sailing drink, Stirling Punch, was named in Vanderbilt&#x27;s honor.

Vanderbilt&#x27;s private railroad car, New York Central 3, was renovated and has operated luxury charter trips at the rear of regularly-scheduled Amtrak and Via Rail Canada trains.

Vanderbilt was inducted into the National Sailing Hall of Fame in 2011. He was inducted into the Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame in 2014.

Following his death, contemporary newspapers reported that his Will dispersed his estate amongst many Charities and Universities, including over $40,000,000 to Vanderbilt University and $6,600,000 to Harvard University.

<text>Roque Luis Santa Cruz Cantero (; born 16 August 1981) is a Paraguayan professional footballer who plays as a striker for Paraguayan Primera División club Libertad. He is the record goal scorer and has earned over 100 caps for the Paraguay national team, thus he is regarded as one of the best players in the nation&#x27;s history. Santa Cruz has scored goals at a professional level in each of the last four decades.

Santa Cruz started his career with Olimpia, progressing through their youth system to the first-team squad where he made his debut at the age of 15 in 1997. He finished his career with the club having scored 13 goals in 24 Primera División appearances where Olimpia claimed the 1997, 1998 and 1999 Primera División titles. Santa Cruz scored three goals in four appearances for Paraguay at the 1999 FIFA World Youth Championship before debuting for the Paraguay national team at the 1999 Copa América, where he scored three goals in four appearances. He immediately joined Bundesliga club Bayern Munich in August 1999 for a fee of €5 million, which was the highest transfer fee in Paraguayan football until 2019. where he scored five goals in 28 league appearances in his first season. He faced a series of injuries and heavy competition from teammates Giovane Élber, Roy Makaay and Claudio Pizarro which limited his impact and restricted his appearances for the club.

Santa Cruz was part of a successful team for Bayern, winning numerous Bundesliga, DFB-Pokal and DFB-Ligapokal titles. He also won the 2000–01 UEFA Champions League and the 2001 Intercontinental Cup. He left Bayern Munich in July 2007 to join Blackburn Rovers for a transfer fee of €5 million, where he scored 19 goals in the 2007–08 Premier League season. In June 2009, he joined Manchester City for a fee of £17.5 million on a four-year deal. Since his transfer, he was loaned out to Blackburn and Real Betis.

He represented Paraguay at the 2002, 2006 and 2010 FIFA World Cup tournaments, and at the 1999, 2007, 2011 (where Paraguay finished runners-up) and 2015 Copa América tournaments. He retired from international football in 2016, but reversed his decision in May 2019.

==Club career==

===Olimpia Asunción===

====1990–1999====
Santa Cruz joined Primera División Paraguaya club Olimpia Asunción&#x27;s youth academy at the age of nine, where he became the top scorer during several seasons. The club&#x27;s first-team coach, Luis Cubilla, invited Santa Cruz to train with the team aged 15, and the player eventually made his first-team appearance in the 1997 Primera División Paraguaya at the age of 15, during the Torneo Clausura on 27 July when he entered the field in the 80th minute for Alfredo Mendoza in the Paraguayan derby against Cerro Porteño.

=====1998 season=====
During the group stages of the 1998 Copa Mercosur, Santa Cruz scored his first goal of the competition in the 11th minute of Olimpia Asunción&#x27;s 4–2 away victory against Argentine side Racing Club on 14 October 1998. The club finished in second position of their group with ten points, and advanced to the quarter-finals to face José Luís Chilavert&#x27;s Vélez Sársfield. During the first-leg of the quarter-final match on 27 October, Santa Cruz scored in the 65th minute of Olimpia&#x27;s 4–3 away victory. One week later, Santa Cruz scored a brace for Olimpia as they claimed a 2–1 home victory in the second leg on 4 November 1998. His goals came in the 24th and 40th minutes of the first half. All of his three goals were scored against his international teammate Chilavert. Bayern Munich&#x27;s eyes looked at Santa Cruz for the first time after he scored his double past José Luís Chilavert. The club was later eliminated from the competition at the semi-final stage by Palmeiras, who would go on to win the tournament. During the 1998 Primera División Paraguaya season, Santa Cruz scored three goals in nine appearances as Olimpia were crowned champions of the league. The club had also reached the knock-out stages of the 1998 Copa Libertadores, where they were eliminated by Argentina&#x27;s Colón.

=====1999 season=====
During the 1999 Primera División Paraguaya season, Santa Cruz scored 10 goals in 14 appearances as Olimpia claimed the league title. Santa Cruz participated at the 1999 Copa Libertadores, where Olimpia were drawn in Group 3 with Cerro Porteño, eventual champions Palmeiras and Corinthians. In Olimpia first group stage match, against Cerro Porteño on 24 February, Santa Cruz scored a second-half double past Aldo Bobadilla in the 58th and 89th minutes as his side were defeated 4–3. On 5 March, Santa Cruz played a full 90 minutes in his side&#x27;s second group stage match, a 4–2 home victory against Palmeiras. Santa Cruz again featured for Olimpia in their third group stage fixture, a 1–1 away draw against Palmeiras on 12 March. In Olimpia&#x27;s fourth group stage fixture, Santa Cruz featured in the entire match as his side drew 2–2 at home against Cerro Porteño on 17 March. On 26 March, Santa Cruz played a full 90 minutes in Olimpia&#x27;s 2–1 home defeat against Corinthians in their fifth Copa Libertadores group stage fixture. Olimpia had been 1–0 in front since the 31st minute of the match, before Corinthians would go on to score two goals in the second half.

On 16 May 1999, a Bayern Munich delegation composed of Franz Beckenbauer, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, Uli Hoeneß, Søren Lerby and Giovanni Branchinni entered surprisingly into the Estadio General Pablo Rojas to see a game between 12 de Octubre and Olimpia Asunción, in which Santa Cruz scored and was Man of the Match, making Bayern Munich hurry with the transfer process. The following day during a reunion with Olimpia&#x27;s president, Osvaldo Dominguez Dibb, who wanted the sale to reach US$10 million, said &quot;Pay the sum, or Roque stays at Olimpia&quot;, stamping his hand on his desk table. To unblock the situation, Santa Cruz&#x27; father, Aproniano, renounced a 30% of the transfer that corresponded him and Santa Cruz joined Bayern Munich without obstacles.

Santa Cruz had scored two goals in five Copa Libertadores appearances and would not take part in his club&#x27;s last group stage fixture, a 4–0 away defeat against Corinthians on 9 April, due to his participation for Paraguay U20 at the 1999 FIFA World Youth Championship, which was disputed at the same time. Santa Cruz played in his last &quot;Superclásico&quot; against Cerro Porteño in a 1–0 home victory during the 1999 Apertura on 30 May. Santa Cruz also played in his last competitive match for Olimpia Asunción a 1–0 win against Colegiales, on 6 June. The first contacts with Bayern Munich were via telephone and the US$20 million that the Olimpia Asunción president wanted for the transfer was considered by Bayern Munich a very elevated cost. His involvement with Paraguay&#x27;s national teams, the striker was awarded with the Paraguayan Footballer of the Year award in 1999, and Olimpia club president Osvaldo Domínguez Dibb had assessed Santa Cruz to value from around US$20 million, however Santa Cruz was eventually sold to Bayern Munich for US$7 million, the transfer fee becoming the record transfer in Paraguayan football. He later revealed that he had the chance to join Real Madrid before he eventually signed with Bayern in 1999.

Santa Cruz confessed that his teammates and himself had been mis-treated by Osvaldo Domínguez Dibb after bad performances from the first-team where the players&#x27; salaries were not deposited into their bank accounts in order for the players to personally collect it in person from the president and would be threatened by guns and knives. &quot;I remember that we once lost an important regional derby. The president entered the sleeping room where we all spent the night ahead of games and unloaded his gun in the ceiling. That wasn&#x27;t all though. When a player had put in a bad performance, Osvaldo just strolled up to his car and urinated inside it while the player was standing right next to him. The president always wanted us to come up to him to pick up our monthly wages. If you hadn&#x27;t played well that month, he stood up and asked &#x27;What is it you want?&#x27; while tapping a machine gun on his desk. That always prompted players to wait for their money until they had put in some better performances again.&quot;

===Bayern Munich===

====1999–2000 season====

He was also voted as Blackburn&#x27;s Player of the Season.

====2008–09 season====
Following a successful 2007–08 campaign, there was much transfer speculation surrounding Santa Cruz at the start of the 2008–09 Premier League. However, he signed a four-year contract with Blackburn in August to end the speculation. Prior to the start of the 2008–09 season, Blackburn signed Roque&#x27;s younger brother, Julio, who had arrived from Paraguayan Primera División side Cerro Porteño. He scored his first goal of the 2008–09 season in round 1 in a 3–2 away victory against Everton on 16 August. His second goal of the season came on 27 September in a 2–1 away win against Newcastle United.

During an away fixture against Portsmouth in December 2008, Santa Cruz&#x27;s front door was forced open and his house was raided by three men who held his wife, Giselle, at knifepoint to her throat. His children were forced into a downstairs room while the robbers searched the house upstairs with his wife as she was forced her to hand over thousands of pounds worth of jewellery. Santa Cruz&#x27;s house was less than a mile from Liverpool winger Jermaine Pennant&#x27;s mansion, which was attacked by ram-raiders the day before.

On 6 December, he scored in Blackburn&#x27;s 3–1 loss against Liverpool. He became a target for Manchester City following their takeover by the billionaire Abu Dhabi United Group. In January 2009, they had bids of £12 million and £16 million rejected by Blackburn, with the club stating it would take £25 million for them to even consider selling their star striker. On 2 February 2009, City failed to meet the reported £25 million asking price. During the fifth round of the 2008–09 FA Cup, he scored within 90 seconds to give Blackburn the lead in their 2–2 draw against Coventry City on 14 February. He scored his fourth and final goal of the 2008–09 season in a 2–1 away loss against Manchester United on 21 February. On 20 April, there were rumours that he was planning to leave Rovers after the 2008–09 season, less than 12 months after signing a new deal with the Premier League club, although he denied these rumours, saying that they were &quot;lost in translation&quot;. Blackburn finished on the season in 15th position of the Premier League table with 41 points; Santa Cruz scored just 4 goals in 20 league appearances.

===Manchester City===

====2009–10 season====
On 21 June 2009, it was reported that Santa Cruz was undergoing a medical at Manchester City ahead of a proposed summer transfer worth £17.5 million on a four-year deal.

Santa Cruz debuted for Manchester City in the 2009–10 Premier League season in a 3–1 home victory against West Ham United on 28 September, where he was substituted onto the field for Shaun Wright-Phillips in the 81st minute. 

Santa Cruz scored his first goal for Manchester City in a 5–1 League Cup win against Scunthorpe United on 28 October. He scored his first league goals for Manchester City, a brace in a 4–3 home victory against Sunderland on 19 December, a game which proved to be Mark Hughes&#x27; last game at the club. Santa Cruz&#x27;s appearances, however, were limited when Roberto Mancini took over as manager, due to a succession of injuries coupled with a lack of form. He scored his third and final league goal for the 2009–10 season in a 2–1 away victory against Fulham on 21 March. Santa Cruz had made only 19 league appearances as Manchester City finished the season in fifth position, where they qualified for the 2010–11 UEFA Europa League.

====2010–11 season====
Roberto Mancini continued to leave out Santa Cruz during the 2010–11 season, and he made it clear that he wanted to leave. Mark Hughes, who by then was manager of Fulham, had insisted on signing him, but a transfer never materialized. From September 2010 to January 2011, he had made just one league appearance, a 0–0 draw against Birmingham City on 13 November where he had been substituted onto the field for James Milner in the 66th minute. He had also made one League Cup appearance in a 2–1 away loss to West Bromwich Albion on 22 September. In December, he received a loan offer from Serie A outfit Lazio for the remainder of the season, though it was rejected as he preferred a permanent move away from Eastlands.

====Loan to Blackburn====
On 14 January 2011, Santa Cruz returned to Blackburn on loan for the remainder of the 2010–11 season. After Santa Cruz passed his medical, he said, &quot;When Blackburn showed an interest in me, it was very easy to decide,&quot; to BBC Radio Lancashire. His first game for Blackburn was in a 2–0 away loss against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on 15 January, where he was substituted onto the field in the 46th minute for Nikola Kalinić.

In December, Brazilian Série A outfit Cruzeiro had made a bid for Santa Cruz and had also offered Manchester City their highly rated 17-year-old youngster, Léo Bonatini, as part of the deal. He admitted that he was aware of interest from Cruzeiro, but stated that the challenge of consolidating his club&#x27;s position in La Liga was more important than moving on to pastures new. He scored his first goal of 2012 in a 2–0 home victory against Sporting de Gijón on 8 January. One week later, he was substituted onto the field for Ireney in the 46th minute at the Camp Nou in a 4–2 loss against Barcelona on 15 January, where he scored in the 52nd minute with a right-footed shot to level the scores at 2–2.

After notching seven league goals in 33 La Liga appearances, he announced his desire to stay with Betis after being deemed surplus to requirements at Manchester City.

=====Transfer speculation=====
On 17 June 2012, it was reported again that Mark Hughes, at that point managing Queens Park Rangers, was keen on signing Santa Cruz for the 2012–13 season. On 6 July 2012, it was reported that he was close to signing with Betis on a permanent deal but had hit problems due to his elevated wage demands. On 13 July 2012, it was reported that Argentine Primera División club Newell&#x27;s Old Boys had expressed their interest in signing him after the club employed former Paraguay national team head coach Gerardo Martino as the first-team manager for the 2012–13 season.

On 10 June 2013, it was reported that José Luís Chilavert had stated that Santa Cruz had pretended to be injured in order to miss the match against Germany at the round of 16 stage of the 2002 World Cup. Chilavert claimed that this was because Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, who at the time was vice president of Bayern Munich (which was the club were Santa Cruz had played at from 1999 to 2007), had visited the hotel that Paraguay were staying at and had apparently told Santa Cruz not to play against Germany.

Francisco Arce defended Santa Cruz, informing that &quot;Chilavert comes out to say stupid things every now and then. Don&#x27;t believe him. Roque is the most professional person that I have ever met in my time in the national team, he is a man that doesn&#x27;t have a stain in any place&quot;.

Prior to the match in 2002, the media stated that the match would have special significance for Santa Cruz due to playing for a German club. Prior to the match, Santa Cruz said, &quot;I&#x27;m very excited – I have been dreaming of this. If I have a chance I will kill them – I know all their tricks. It will be a special game for me against my friends and colleagues from Bayern Munich, but I don&#x27;t take it as a personal challenge. I have been living there for three years and I like the country very much, but I think they will understand that I must do my best and I won&#x27;t need motivating. Germany are a powerful team, with players of the highest calibre, and their name is written into World Cup history,&quot; and in 2013 Santa Cruz himself then stated to Paraguay&#x27;s Telefuturo that Chilavert&#x27;s comments were false because they were stated more than ten years after the incident. Santa Cruz also stated that what had been said was painful because alongside Chilavert he had shared many experiences but the people had seen Santa Cruz play and were aware of his professionalism.

===2006 FIFA World Cup===
Santa Cruz was in doubt for the 2006 World Cup as he had been recovering from a knee injury, however, he recovered in time for the start of the tournament and was eventually selected in the 23-man squad by coach Aníbal Ruiz. Despite wearing the number 24 shirt during the World Cup qualification campaign, he was handed the number 9 for the tournament. Santa Cruz was part of the starting XI players in Paraguay&#x27;s first match against England on 10 June. He was partnered upfront alongside Nelson Valdez in the eventual 1–0 loss. Santa Cruz again started in Paraguay&#x27;s 1–0 loss to Sweden on 15 June, where he was substituted off of the field for Dante López in the 63rd minute. Santa Cruz played a full 90 minutes of Paraguay&#x27;s third group stage match against Trinidad and Tobago on 20 June, he had assisted Nelson Cuevas with a pass in scoring Paraguay&#x27;s second goal in the 86th minute of the 2–0 victory. Paraguay finished in third position of their respective group, obtaining three points for their win against Trinidad and Tobago.

===2007 Copa América===
Santa Cruz was selected for the 2007 Copa América under new coach Gerardo Martino. In Paraguay&#x27;s first group stage match against Colombia on 28 June, Santa Cruz scored a hat-trick in his side&#x27;s 5–0 victory. His first goal was a left-footed chip in the 30th minute, his second goal was a right-footed shot in the 46th minute assisted from an Édgar Barreto pass, and his third goal was a header in the 80th minute assisted from a cross by Carlos Bonet. Santa Cruz played a full 90 minutes of Paraguay&#x27;s 3–1 victory against the United States on 2 July. Santa Cruz was substituted onto the field for Jonathan Santana in the 81st minute of Paraguay&#x27;s last group stage fixture, a 1–0 loss against Argentina on 5 July. Paraguay had finished in second place of their respective group, having obtained six points from their two wins. They advanced to the quarter final stages where they faced Mexico on 8 July, where Santa Cruz played a full 90 minutes of Paraguay&#x27;s 6–0 loss.

===2010 FIFA World Cup===
Santa Cruz scored three times during qualification for the 2010 World Cup, including the opening goal of a 2–0 defeat of Brazil in Asunción, as &quot;La Albirroja&quot; finished third in the CONMEBOL standings.

Despite injury restricting him to a substitute appearance in the team&#x27;s opening match of the tournament finals against champions Italy, Santa Cruz went on to start in Paraguay&#x27;s second and third Group F matches, as well as the round of 16 defeat of Japan in Pretoria. This result took Paraguay to its first ever World Cup quarter-final, where the team lost 0–1 to eventual champions Spain, with Santa Cruz appearing as a 72nd-minute substitute.

===2011 Copa América===
Santa Cruz was part of Paraguay&#x27;s starting eleven players for the 2011 Copa América. On 3 July, he played in Paraguay&#x27;s opening group stage fixture, a 0–0 draw against Ecuador. He played 83 minutes of the match before being substituted off of the field for Pablo Zeballos. In Paraguay&#x27;s second group stage fixture on 9 July, Santa Cruz Paraguay&#x27;s first goal in the 54th minute of their 2–2 draw against Brazil in Córdoba. Santa Cruz was awarded as the Man of the Match of the 2–2 draw. His goal brought him to a total of 25 goals for Paraguay, making him the joint all-time leading goal scorer of the Paraguay national team&#x27;s history, with José Saturnino Cardozo.

On 13 July, Santa Cruz played just 39 minutes of Paraguay&#x27;s last group stage match against Venezuela before being replaced by Nelson Valdez. The match finished as a 3–3 draw and Paraguay finished in third place of their respective group, with three points, qualifying for the quarter finals stages. On 17 July, Santa Cruz would not take part in Paraguay&#x27;s quarter final match against Brazil. Paraguay eventually beat Brazil 2–0 via penalty shoot-out and qualified for the semi-final. In Paraguay&#x27;s semi-final victory against Venezuela on 20 July, Santa Cruz was substituted onto the field in the 73rd minute for Nelson Valdez, however due to an injury, he was substituted off of the field in the 80th minute for Osvaldo Martínez.

===2014 FIFA World Cup qualification===
On 7 June 2013, in a 2014 World Cup qualification match against Chile, Santa Cruz scored his 26th international goal and became the leading goalscorer for Paraguay. Nevertheless, Paraguay did not qualify for the World Cup.

===2015 Copa América and late career===
Santa Cruz captained Paraguay in their 2015 Copa América fourth-place campaign, making five appearances, four of which as a starter, scoring no goals. He was also called up for the Copa América Centenario on the following year, but missed out on the tournament through injury. In May 2019, he was named in the preliminary 40-man squad for the 2019 Copa América, but did not make the final cut. As of 2023, his latest appearance for the national team has been in a 2018 World Cup qualifier against Peru on 11 November 2016.

==Style of play==
Santa Cruz was described in his 2010 World Cup profile as having &quot;long caused problems for opposing defences with his natural flair for goalscoring and surging runs into the penalty box&quot;.

==Personal life==
Santa Cruz, who is a naturalised Spanish citizen, married Giselle Tavarelli, the sister of his former national team and Olimpia teammate Ricardo Tavarelli, in 2003. They have a son named Tobias (born 17 December 2003), a daughter named Fiorella (born 11 November 2005), a son named Benjamin (born 2010) and a daughter named Alaia (born in Spain in July 2014). Roque Santa Cruz is a practising Roman Catholic.

His father, Aproniano Santa Cruz, is also his agent, and his mother is Celina. Santa Cruz has a younger brother named Julio who plays for Asunción-based club Nacional, a second brother named Diego who was also a professional football player, and another brother named Oscar who died in 2005.

Santa Cruz is a friend of long-time Bayern Munich teammate Owen Hargreaves, who taught him the English language. Hargreaves and Santa Cruz lived nearby to each other in the city of Manchester while Santa Cruz was playing for Blackburn in 2007.

In 2004, Santa Cruz was the subject of the song &quot;Ich, Roque&quot; by the German band Sportfreunde Stiller.

Santa Cruz was chosen by the German newspaper &quot;Die Welt&quot; as the sexiest footballer of the 2006 World Cup. He has appeared on the cover of the German version of &quot;Pro Evolution Soccer 6&quot;.

On 28 June 2007, during Paraguay&#x27;s 5–0 group stage victory over Colombia at the 2007 Copa América, Santa Cruz became the 60th player to score a hat-trick in the history of Copa América hat-tricks.

In July 2021, Santa Cruz said that former France defender Lilian Thuram was the hardest defender he played against.

<doc id="1273206" wikidata="Q1451359" url="?curid=1273206" title="Ashanti's Christmas">
<text>Ashanti&#x27;s Christmas is the third studio album by American singer Ashanti, released on November 18, 2003, by The Inc. Records. Chiefly produced by label head Irv Gotti, it is a follow-up to her second studio album, &quot;Chapter II&quot; (2003) and her first Christmas album. &quot;Ashanti&#x27;s Christmas&quot; consists of ten tracks, featuring four original songs co-penned by Ashanti and six cover versions of Christmas standards and carols, including &quot;The Christmas Song&quot;, &quot;Silent Night&quot;, &quot;Winter Wonderland&quot; and others.

The album earned largely negative reviews from music critics, who panned its production and Ashanti&#x27;s singing. &quot;Ashanti&#x27;s Christmas&quot; peaked at number 160 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number 43 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. As for singles, Ashanti released a medley which featured the songs &quot;Christmas Time Again&quot;, &quot;The Christmas Song&quot;, and &quot;Hey Santa&quot;. A video was shot for the medley and it received moderate rotation on BET and MTV. A reworked version of the original song &quot;Time of Year&quot; would later appear on Ashanti&#x27;s second Christmas project, the 2013 EP &quot;A Wonderful Christmas with Ashanti&quot;.

Caroline Sullivan from &quot;The Guardian&quot; found that Ashanti exhibits &quot;zip&quot; on &quot;Ashanti&#x27;s Christmas&quot;, further writing: &quot;Her pure tones complement a very contemporary minxy streak that&#x27;s dying to unwrap all those exciting presents. &quot;Hey Santa&quot; is the stand-out: a list of demands (&quot;How about a diamond bracelet, a baby-blue convertible...&quot;) delivered with the charm that typifies the rest of the album.&quot; Slant Magazine editor Alexa Camp felt that the &quot;production values on &quot;Ashanti’s Christmas&quot; are so bargain-basement that they actually match the poor girl’s singing abilities. Occasionally (and I stress occasionally), Ashanti’s voice actually outshines the low-budget, Casio keyboard production and Karaoke machine synth strings.&quot;

AllMusic editor David Jeffries found that &quot;Ashanti&#x27;s Christmas&quot; features Irv Gotti&#x27;s &quot;least slick and least satisfying production work. Ashanti&#x27;s voice fits sweet holiday music well, and she could deliver an excellent Christmas album given the chance, but it seems Gotti can&#x27;t be bothered to surround her with anything worthwhile [...] A drum machine that chugs on and on before someone has the good sense to turn it off takes up the last 30 seconds of the 20-minute album. It&#x27;s a perfectly lifeless moment that caps off a perfectly humdrum album.&quot; In another negative review, Tracy E. Hopkins from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that &quot;if you&#x27;re looking for spirit, you won&#x27;t find it on Ashanti&#x27;s joyless Christmas album.&quot; She noted that &quot;the thin-piped songbird nearly redeems herself, however, on the sentimental &quot;Time of Year&quot; and karaoke-worthy covers of Donny Hathaway&#x27;s &quot;This Christmas&quot; and the old standby &quot;Silent Night.&quot; But even those songs don&#x27;t generate enough warmth to shake off the album&#x27;s bah humbugs.&quot;

==Chart performance==
&quot;Ashanti&#x27;s Christmas&quot; debuted at number 167 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the week of December 6, 2003. It eventually peaked at number 160 two weeks later. It also reached number 13 on the Top Holiday Albums chart. On December 16, 2003, &quot;MTV News&quot; reported that the album had sold 37,000 copies in the United States.

<text>Hagersville is a community in Haldimand County, Ontario, Canada.

==History==
Upon the construction of Highway 6, known formerly as the Plank Road, a small village popped up around 1855 when Charles and David Hager bought most of the land in the centre of the area. David Almas owned the land on the east side of the road, while John Porter owned the land in the west end.

The building of the Canada Southern Railroad in 1870, and of the Hamilton and Lake Erie Railway three years later helped to make Hagersville a prosperous village in 1879.

Close by the rail crossing was The Junction Hotel, later becoming The Lawson Hotel after a change in ownership. Perhaps it was best known as Murph&#x27;s Place when retired NHL player Ron Murphy took ownership. It was also known as the Hagersville Inn, but today it is known as The Old Lawson House. In 1852, Charles Hager built a frame hotel at the corner of the Plank Road and Indian Line. Hagersville&#x27;s first post office was in this hotel and Joseph Seymour suggested the community be called Hagersville to honour the Hager brothers. As of 2020, the Lawson property offered rooms as affordable housing for many residents.
During World War II No. 16 Service Flying Training School RCAF was established by the Royal Canadian Air Force as part of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan at 274 Concession 11 Walpole southwest of Hagersville. No. 16 SFTS opened on 8 August 1941 and closed on 30 March 1945. After the RCAF finished with the site it was used by the Canadian Army for various purposes and was known as Camp Hagersville. The camp was closed in 1964. Between the 1960s and 1990s, the camp was used as a residence for youth and then a flea market. As of 2013 the site was an industrial park. Some of the military homes are still there, and the housing area is known as &quot;White Oaks Village&quot;. A good view of the site and the old hangars is had from Concession 10 Walpole. The base was located at .

In 1990, a large uncontrolled tire fire emitted fumes of toxic smoke into the atmosphere for seventeen days. The fire itself occurred on Concession 13 Walpole, about 8km from Hagersville, but media credited it to Hagersville since it was the largest town in close proximity. The so-called &quot;Hagersville Tire Fire&quot; has reportedly been linked to long-term health issues, including some &quot;rare, aggressive cancers,&quot; among firefighters who experienced the event first-hand.

==Location and airports==

*Hagersville&#x27;s nearest airports are Hamilton/John C. Munro International Airport (CYHM) () (formerly Mount Hope Airport), Toronto Pearson International Airport (YYZ) (), and Buffalo Niagara International Airport (BUF) ().

<doc id="1273216" wikidata="Q5620619" url="?curid=1273216" title="Gus Bell">
<text>David Russell &quot;Gus&quot; Bell Jr. (November 15, 1928 – May 7, 1995) was an American professional baseball player and scout. He played in Major League Baseball as a center fielder from 1950 to 1964, most prominently as a member of the Cincinnati Reds, where he was a four-time All-Star and a member of Cincinnati&#x27;s National League pennant-winning team. Bell had 100 or more runs batted in four times during his Reds career and batted .292 or better six times.

Bell also played for the Pittsburgh Pirates, New York Mets and Milwaukee Braves. He was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 1964.

==Family==
A native of Louisville, Kentucky, and graduate of Bishop Benedict Joseph Flaget High School, Bell was nicknamed &quot;Gus&quot; as a youngster because he was a fan of longtime MLB player Gus Mancuso. 

Gus Bell was the oldest member of a rare three-generation major league family. His son Buddy has been a third baseman, coach, manager and front-office executive in the majors since 1972, and his grandsons, former MLB infielders David and Mike, became coaches, managers or player development officials after their playing careers.

The elder Bell wore uniform #25 during his nine years with the Cincinnati Reds (known as the &quot;Redlegs&quot; from 1953 to 1958). Buddy Bell wore 25 in tribute to his father during much of his playing and managing career, including his 1985–88 tenure with the Reds. David Bell, who managed the Reds from 2019 to 2024, carried on the tradition when he took Cincinnati uniform #25 as well.

==Career==
===Pittsburgh Pirates===
Bell was 18 years old when he made his pro debut in the Pirates&#x27; farm system in 1947. In both 1948 and 1949, he batted over .300, and led the Eastern League in hits during the latter season. A torrid start to his 1950 season at Triple-A Indianapolis — he hit .400 with 66 hits in 38 games — earned him a call-up to Pittsburgh. He debuted on May 30 playing both ends of a Memorial Day doubleheader against the St. Louis Cardinals at Forbes Field, and went four for ten; then, the following day, against the Boston Braves, he maintained the same pace, with two hits in five at bats. He ended his rookie season with a .282 batting mark in 111 games as the Bucs&#x27; starting rightfielder.

Bell played for the Pirates through , leading the National League in triples with 12 in , and driving in 89 runs. On June 4, 1951, he hit for the cycle against the Philadelphia Phillies. In 2004, his grandson David hit for the cycle; Gus Bell and David Bell are the only grandfather-grandson duo in major league history to hit for the cycle.

But a terrible 1952 campaign, during which the Pirates compiled a franchise-worst 42–112 record and Bell slumped to a .250 batting mark in 131 games, led to his October 14, 1952, trade to the Cincinnati Reds for three players.

===Cincinnati Redlegs/Reds===
During his nine years with Cincinnati from through , Bell achieved success and popularity. A four-time NL All-Star selection (1953–54, 1956–57), he enjoyed his best seasons in 1953, when he hit .300 with 30 home runs and 105 RBI, and in , batting .308 with 27 home runs and 104 RBI. Four times, he recorded more than 100 RBI in a season and hit 103 home runs from 1953 to .

Bell hit home runs in three consecutive at-bats on May 29, 1956. During the 1956 season, Bell, Ted Kluszewski and Bob Thurman became the second trio of teammates each to have three-home run games in the same season. The feat had been accomplished by the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1950 (Duke Snider, Roy Campanella and Tommy Brown) and subsequently was equally by the Cleveland Indians in 1987 (Cory Snyder, Joe Carter and Brook Jacoby).

In , Bell and six of his teammates – Ed Bailey, Johnny Temple, Roy McMillan, Don Hoak, Wally Post and Frank Robinson — were voted to the National League All-Star starting lineup, the result of a ballot stuffing campaign by Cincinnati fans. Bell remained on the team as a reserve, but Post was taken off altogether due to injury. Bell and Post were replaced as starters by Hank Aaron and Willie Mays. Bell entered the game as a pinch hitter for Robinson in the seventh and drove in both Mays and Bailey with a double against Early Wynn.

Bell&#x27;s last season as a regular outfielder was , when he started 122 of the Reds&#x27; 154 games. In 1961, his final year with Cincinnati, he was a part-time player (starting 54 games) on the Reds&#x27; first pennant-winning team in 21 years. In the 1961 World Series, Bell was called on to pinch hit in Games 3, 4 and 5 and went hitless in three at bats. One day after the conclusion of the Fall Classic, won by the New York Yankees four games to one, Bell was the eighth overall selection in the primary phase of the National League expansion draft by the New York Mets.

===New York Mets===
Bell started the season with the Mets, and on April 11, 1962, he was the starting right fielder in the Mets&#x27; inaugural game. He became the first base runner in Met history after hitting a single in the second inning of an 11–4 loss to the Cardinals. But he collected only 15 hits in 101 at bats (.149) in 30 games with the expansion club.

===Milwaukee Braves===
On May 21, 1962, Bell was sent to Milwaukee to complete a November 1961 transaction in which the Mets acquired veteran slugger Frank Thomas. He batted .285 in 79 games (with 53 games started as an outfielder) to raise his 1962 season average to .241. But he had only six more MLB at bats as a Brave in 1963–64 until he was released on May 12, 1964, during the roster cutdown then in effect in the major leagues.

==Post-playing career==
Bell was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 1964. After his playing career, he worked for an auto dealership, ran a temporary employment agency, and was a scout for the Cleveland Indians and Texas Rangers. Bell died in May 1995, at Bethesda North Hospital near Cincinnati, at the age of 66; he had recently had a heart attack. He was survived by seven children and 36 grandchildren.

On what would have been Bell&#x27;s 83rd birthday – November 15, 2011 – he was inducted into the Louisville Catholic Sports Hall of Fame, with a speech by his grandson David.

<text>Killer Instinct 2 is a 1996 fighting game developed by Rare, published by Nintendo and manufactured by Midway for arcades as a sequel to &quot;Killer Instinct&quot; (1994). A modified version of &quot;Killer Instinct 2&quot; was published for the Nintendo 64 as &quot;Killer Instinct Gold&quot; the same year. A Super Nintendo Entertainment System version of &quot;Killer Instinct 2&quot; was developed and completed, but never released. A digital port of the game for the Xbox One is bundled with the second season of &quot;Killer Instinct&quot; (2013), under the title &quot;Killer Instinct 2 Classic&quot; in 2014.

==Gameplay==
As with most fighting games and indeed its predecessor, two characters square off with the goal of depleting the opponent&#x27;s life bar. As with the original &quot;Killer Instinct&quot;, when a character&#x27;s original life bar is fully depleted, he or she will fall to the ground, and immediately begin on his or her second lifebar.

As with the first game, &quot;Killer Instinct 2&quot; relies on an automatic combo subsystem in its matches. The matches, as with &quot;Killer Instinct&quot;, revolve around a three strength system (Quick, Medium and Fierce). However, normal moves have lost a lot of their priority and range, as well as gaining extra recovery time. Throws have been added into the game to deal with blocking characters (as opposed to the top attack in &quot;Killer Instinct&quot;). Additionally, characters can be knocked down much easier with normal moves than in the first game, ending the possibility of opening with a &#x27;glitch&#x27; combo and also weakening the effectiveness of normal moves. Normal special moves no longer are judged on priority, but instead follow a three tiered &#x27;rock, paper, scissors&#x27; system, in which a certain special move will always break another certain special move (similar to the three tiered system in &quot;Soulcalibur&quot;).

Additionally, a Super bar has been added to the game (similar to &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot; or &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; series). This super bar fills as a fighter takes damage or executes an attack that is blocked by the opponent. After the bar reaches a certain point, the player can use a multi-hit Super Move which is usually an extended version of a normal special move.

The combo system has its roots in the original &quot;Killer Instinct&quot;. By pressing a certain strength button after an opener move, a player will launch an auto-double and initiate the combo system of the game. Unlike the first game, players can now open up combos with new and much less risky moves than before (most notable a close Fierce punch or close Fierce kick). Additionally, Super Moves can be placed into combos, greatly increasing their damage and potency as well as being unbreakable. Additionally combos can be extended using throws, super linkers, manual-doubles, and super end specials. As a result of the weakened normal moves and other changes to the system, combos have now become more devastating in &quot;Killer Instinct 2&quot;. In an apparent effort to help ease this dominance, combo breakers are now easier to perform. Unlike combo breakers in the first game, which also required a three tiered &#x27;rock, paper, scissors&#x27; system based on strength to break, combos are now broken depending on the type of attack. Punches break kick doubles, and kicks will break punch doubles.

Parry, an advanced new addition, allow an open counter-attack after a successful parry block. A player can assume a standing defensive position and cause the attacker to temporarily freeze if the parry is successful, and from there either perform a special stunning technique or a three-hit variant of a Special Move.

The finishing moves have also been reworked. Now each character can only execute these attacks when the opponent&#x27;s second life bar flashes red (unlike the first &quot;Killer Instinct&quot; the opponent falls when he or she loses all of his or her energy bars). Each character has two Ultimate combo moves (one of them can be executed without executing a combo), the Humiliation sequences were dropped, and the Ultra combo feature is still intact. Unlike the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; Fatalities, the &quot;Killer Instinct 2&quot;″s finishing moves do not feature brutality or blood.

==Plot==
&quot;Killer Instinct 2&quot; follows on where the first installment left off. Eyedol&#x27;s death at the hands of Black Orchid accidentally sets off a time warp, transporting some of the combatants back in time and allowing the Demon Lord Gargos (Eyedol&#x27;s opponent) to escape from Limbo.

Now, trapped 2000 years in the past, the warriors that survived &quot;Killer Instinct&quot;, along with several new faces, fight for the right to face Gargos in combat. Each character that survived the journey from the first game have corresponding backstories, while new characters in this installment are native inhabitants of this past time period. Some fighters, like returning fighter T.J. Combo, just want to get home. Others, like new character Tusk, want to bring an end to Gargos and his reign of evil. This time there is no tournament or prize money, just a fight to the finish with the fate of the future hanging in the balance.

===Characters===

The game features a total roster of 11 characters. Black Orchid, Jago, Sabrewulf, Spinal and T.J. Combo return from the previous title. A new Fulgore Mark II prototype replaces the Fulgore Mark I from the first game while Glacius is replaced by another member of the same species, who assumes the former&#x27;s name. Eyedol, Chief Thunder, Cinder, and Riptor were omitted from the roster; Gargos, Kim Wu, Maya, and Tusk were introduced in their place.

Each character in the game has four or eight different endings. Which ending the player gets depends whether or not the player kills (by using a finishing move instead of simply depleting their health) one or more certain character(s) during the course of the game, as well as destroy certain objects on stages. For example, Jago&#x27;s endings both involve Fulgore and B. Orchid (if Fulgore does not kill Jago and B. Orchid, they team up and destroy him), as well as Ultratech&#x27;s destruction (on Fulgore&#x27;s museum stage). Thus, killing or not killing them, as well as destroying or not destroying Ultratech, over the course of the game alters the outcomes of his endings:
* If he kills Fulgore, destroys Ultratech, and spares Orchid, his enjoyment of his enemy&#x27;s demises is only sweetened by the discovery that Orchid is his older sister, and the two siblings return to the present without Ultratech.
* If he kills Fulgore, and spares Ultratech and Orchid, the two siblings return to the present to battle the rebuilt Ultratech.
* If he spares both their lives, but destroys Ultratech, Orchid saves him from Fulgore&#x27;s attack and they return to the present without Ultratech.
* If he spares both their lives, as well as Ultratech&#x27;s, he and Orchid return to the present to battle the rebuilt Ultratech right after destroying Fulgore.
* If he kills both of them, as well as destroys Ultratech, he relishes his victory over Fulgore, but feels an inexplicable emptiness in his heart which he must live with for the rest of his days.
* If he kills both of them, but spares Ultratech, he is forced to fight Ultratech alone.
* If he kills Orchid and destroys Ultratech, but doesn&#x27;t destroy Fulgore, the cyborg will eventually kill him, but without Ultratech, Fulgore searches for an ancestor of Jago&#x27;s (as well as Orchid&#x27;s) to erase his nemesis from existence.
* If he kills Orchid, but doesn&#x27;t destroy Fulgore nor Ultratech, the cyborg will eventually kill him, and fulfills Ultratech&#x27;s original purposes by seizing control of the world.

==Development and release==
Development began shortly after the release of its predecessor. This was done by a small team led by Lee Schneuman and Ken Lobb. One of its programmers Martin Hollis left partway as development started to work on &quot;Goldeneye 007&quot; (1997). According to Lobb, eliminating excessive defense play &quot;was the absolute highest priority. I felt that this was not a problem for experts, but it hurt beginners. We now reward the aggressor big time&quot;. The team used the same hardware from its predecessor. They believed the characters needed redesigns. Kevin Bayliss, who served as designer, redesigned each characters to suit the sequel after its events. The game’s music was primarily composed by Robin Beanland, who had worked with Graeme Norgate on its predecessor and with the other team. Norgate contributed to some tracks, but left partway in development to compose music for &quot;Blast Corps&quot; (1997) and &quot;Goldeneye 007&quot;.

===&quot;Killer Instinct Gold&quot;===

&quot;Killer Instinct Gold&quot; is an upgraded version of &quot;Killer Instinct 2&quot; that was released for the Nintendo 64 shortly after the launch of the console. The game suffered some graphical downgrades and the endings for each character do not change (as they would in the Arcade version) due to the memory limitations of the Nintendo 64 cartridge. Other than that, &quot;Killer Instinct Gold&quot; remains faithful to the original &quot;Killer Instinct 2&quot;.

The new features include:
* Team Battles, in which one can fight with up to 11 characters.
* Team Elimination Battles, in which one has to finish his or her opponents off with Finishing Moves (finishing moves similar to &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;&#x27;s Fatalities, which can be executed immediately) instead of simply depleting their life bar with normal moves, or they will simply return later on in the match (however as the computer player will sometimes use Gargos as the last opponent, victims can be removed from play anyway as he lacks a finishing move).
* Training and Advanced Training, in which the player can learn the moves of the character they have chosen as well as the correct execution of combos, doubles, auto-doubles link moves, etc.
* Options menu, which allows the player to modify certain data, such as the speed of the game, the color of the blood, button configuration, sound and manage Controller Pak data.
* Unlockable content, such as alternate colors for characters and scenarios, and faster degrees of speed for the game.
* The game&#x27;s final boss Gargos is playable with a code.

&quot;Killer Instinct Gold&quot; is compatible with the Nintendo 64&#x27;s Controller Pak to save options and high scores, though the cartridge also includes internal save. Due to cartridge size limitations, several frames of character animation and the FMVs were removed, the later being replaced with 2d animations. Each character&#x27;s multiple endings were also reduced to one ending a character; these new endings sometimes combining elements from more than one of a character&#x27;s arcade endings.

The stages were recreated in full 3D, as opposed to the scaling and distorting FMVs used for the stage backgrounds in the arcade version, allowing more dynamic camera takes at the beginning of the battle, while using less memory consumption.

&quot;Killer Instinct Gold&quot; was later included as part of the &quot;Rare Replay&quot; compilation.

===&quot;Killer Instinct 2 Classic&quot;===
A digital port of the game&#x27;s arcade version, titled &quot;Killer Instinct 2 Classic&quot;, was released as part of the &quot;Season 2 Ultra Edition&quot; of &quot;Killer Instinct&quot; for the Xbox One. The digital version of the game was developed by Code Mystics and published by Microsoft Studios and supports online multiplayer via Xbox Live.

==Soundtrack==
&quot;Killer Instinct Gold&quot; also released its original soundtrack, as the first &quot;Killer Instinct&quot; under Rare Label, titled &quot;Killer Instinct Gold Cuts&quot;. It is a 16-track-audio-CD, which includes original tracks from the Arcade versions plus two remixes and the Training Mode track. The soundtrack, along with several unreleased &quot;KI2&quot; demo tracks, was included as part of the &quot;Killer Instinct Season 2&quot; double-album set released on August 4, 2015.

==Reception==
Though not as critically acclaimed as its predecessor, &quot;Killer Instinct 2&quot; still garnered positive reviews and was a commercial success. Critics praised its improvements, combo system, graphics, and sound, but others were critical of its inconsistent frame rate, slow pace, and lack of advancement from its predecessor. A reviewer for &quot;Next Generation&quot; commented that while the game includes new fighting elements such as a super bar, the essence of the original game is essentially recycled. He also criticized that while the characters are larger and more detailed, this is at the cost of slower game speed and a choppier frame rate. Summarizing that &quot;if you like the style of fighting that relies more on memorizing combos than hand-eye coordination and, in a way, skill, &quot;Killer Instinct II&quot; is full of that same fighting style&quot;, he scored it 3 out of 5 stars.

Brazilian magazine &quot;SuperGamePower&quot; gave the arcade version 5 out of 5 on all five categories.

In 2013, Rich Knight and Gus Turner of &quot;Complex&quot; included it on their list of 25 best 2D fighting games of all time, stating that &quot;not quite as good as the first, &quot;Killer Instinct 2&quot;″s greatest strength and weakness were one and the same: it played too much like &quot;Killer Instinct&quot;. ... A solid game, but not enough so to overshadow its predecessor&quot;.

<doc id="1273241" wikidata="Q1413217" url="?curid=1273241" title="Žižkov Television Tower">
<text>The Žižkov Television Tower () is a transmitter tower built in Prague between 1985 and 1992. Designed by the architect Václav Aulický and the structural engineer Jiří Kozák, it stands high above the city&#x27;s traditional skyline from its position on top of a hill in the district of Žižkov, from which it takes its name. The tower is an example of high-tech architecture.

==Characteristics==
The structure of the tower is unconventional, based on a triangle whose corners go up in steel columns, consisting of three tubes with a double steel wall, filled with concrete. They support nine &#x27;pods&#x27; and three decks for transmitting equipment. One of the three pillars extends considerably higher than the others, providing both the necessary height for radio antennas and the structure&#x27;s rocket and gantry appearance. In its time it was a unique technology, which authors have patented.

The tower stands 216 metres (709 feet) high, with the observatory at 93 metres, the hotel room at 70 metres, restaurants (with a capacity of 180 people) at 66 metres. Three elevators transport passengers at a speed of 4 m/s.

Three of the pods, positioned directly beneath the decks at the top, are used for equipment and are inaccessible to the public. The remaining six pods are open to visitors, providing a panoramic view of Prague and the surrounding area. The lower three, approximately half-way up the length of the pillars at 63 metres (207 feet), house a restaurant and café bar.

Construction of the tower cost $19 million. It weighs 11,800 tonnes and is also used as a meteorological observatory. It is a member of the World Federation of Great Towers.

Since 2006, to mark the 125th anniversary of the elevation of Žižkov into a city and the 15th anniversary of the commissioning of the transmitter, the transmitter is illuminated in different colors every evening, usually in the colors of the state tricolor.

After switching to digital TV broadcasting and removing the old analogue broadcast equipment by 2012, the owner decided to use the free space for a new colocation datacenter.

On 13 February 2013 a luxury one room hotel was added to the tower. The room sits upstairs from the reopened restaurant and a spiral staircase provides private access. Inside the room is a large bed and a free standing bathtub from where the guest can view the city.

==David Černý sculptures==

In 2000, ten fiberglass sculptures by Czech artist David Černý called &quot;Miminka&quot; (Babies), crawling up and down were temporarily attached to the tower&#x27;s pillars. The sculptures were admired by many and were returned in 2001 as a permanent installation. Another three Babies, made from bronze, can be found in Prague&#x27;s Kampa Park. For cleaning and structural checks, these Babies were removed from the tower in 2017. After examination of the condition of the sculptures was made a decision to replace them with identical duplicates, which were installed on their original positions in 2019. The original Babies were returned to David Černý.

==Reception==

Although official criticism during the time of its construction was impossible, the tower was lambasted unofficially for its &#x27;megalomania&#x27;, its &#x27;jarring&#x27; effect on the Prague skyline and for destroying part of a centuries-old Jewish cemetery situated at the tower&#x27;s foundations. The tower&#x27;s foundation was simply dug up through the layer of the cemetery, tombstones were crushed by heavy equipment and the bones were carried away to landfill. The tower received a spate of nicknames, mostly alluding to its rocket-like shape, like &quot;Baikonur&quot;, after the Soviet cosmodrome or &quot;Jakeš&#x27;s finger&quot; (&quot;Jakešův prst&quot;), after the then-Secretary General of the Czechoslovak Communist Party. 

In recent years, the tower&#x27;s reputation among Czechs has improved and the crawling Babies (together with the statue Piss by the same author) were published by The Guardian in 2007 as the greatest attraction of Prague.

<doc id="1273245" wikidata="Q2299910" url="?curid=1273245" title="William Kissam Vanderbilt II">
<text>William Kissam Vanderbilt II (October 26, 1878 – January 8, 1944) was an American motor racing enthusiast and yachtsman, and a member of the prominent Vanderbilt family.

==Early life==
He was born on October 26, 1878, in New York City, the second child and first son of William Kissam Vanderbilt and Alva Erskine Smith. His maternal grandfather was Murray Forbes Smith. Known as Willie K., he was a brother to Harold Stirling Vanderbilt and Consuelo Vanderbilt. Born to a life of luxury, he was raised in Vanderbilt mansions, traveled to Europe frequently, and sailed the globe on yachts owned by his father.

Willie was educated by tutors and at St. Mark&#x27;s School. He attended Harvard University but dropped out after two years.

==Career==
While a great part of his life was filled with travel and leisure activities, Willie&#x27;s father put him to work at the family&#x27;s New York Central Railroad offices at Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan. As such, in 1905 he joined other Vanderbilts on Fifth Avenue, hiring the architectural firm McKim, Mead &amp; White to design a mansion at 666 Fifth Avenue.

Already extremely wealthy from a trust fund and from his income as president of the New York Central Railroad Company, on his father&#x27;s death in 1920 Willie inherited a multimillion-dollar fortune.

===Life as an heir===
Although he developed an interest in horse racing and yachting, he was particularly fascinated with automobiles. At age 10, during a stay in the south of France he had ridden in a steam-powered tricycle from Beaulieu-sur-Mer the 7 kilometers to Monte Carlo. As a twenty-year-old, in 1898 he ordered a French De Dion-Bouton motor tricycle and had it shipped to New York. Soon, he acquired other motorized vehicles and before long began to infuriate citizens and officials alike as he sped through the towns and villages of Long Island, New York, en route to &quot;Idle Hour&quot;, his parents&#x27; summer estate at Oakdale.
A skilled sailor, he took part in yacht racing, winning the Sir Thomas Lipton Cup in 1900 with his new sailing yacht he had named &quot;Virginia&quot; in honor of his new bride. In 1902, Vanderbilt began construction on his own country place at Lake Success on Long Island that he named &quot;&quot;Deepdale&quot;.&quot; In 1903 he bought &quot;Tarantula&quot;, the first turbine-powered steam yacht in the World.

However, sailing took second place to his enthusiasm for fast cars. In 1904, Willie set a new land speed record of in a Mercedes-Benz at the Daytona Beach Road Course at Ormond Beach, Florida. That same year, he launched the &quot;Vanderbilt Cup&quot;, the first major trophy in American auto racing. An international event, designed to spur American manufacturers into racing, the race&#x27;s large cash prize drew the top drivers and their vehicles from across the Atlantic Ocean who had competed in Europe&#x27;s Gordon Bennett Cup. Held at a course set out in Nassau County on Long Island, New York, the race drew large crowds hoping to see an American car defeat the mighty European vehicles. However, a French Panhard vehicle won the race and fans would have to wait until 1908 when 23-year-old George Robertson of Garden City, New York, became the first American to win the Vanderbilt Cup.
The Vanderbilt Cup auto races repeatedly had crowd control problems and at the 1906 race a spectator was killed. Seeing the potential to solve the safety issue as well as improve attendance to his race, and with encouragement from AAA official A. R. Pardington, Vanderbilt formed a corporation to build the Long Island Motor Parkway, one of the country&#x27;s first modern paved parkways that could not only be used for the race but would open up Long Island for easy access and economic development. Construction began in 1907 of the multimillion-dollar toll highway that was to run from the Kissena Corridor in Queens County over numerous bridges and overpasses to Lake Ronkonkoma, a distance of . However, the toll road was never able to generate sustainable profits and in 1938 it was formally ceded to the county governments in lieu of the $80,000 due in back taxes.

His new high-speed road complemented a train service that allowed a rapid exit from Manhattan. Becoming the first suburban automobile commuter, in 1910 Willie began work on the much more elaborate and costly &quot;&quot;Eagle&#x27;s Nest&quot; estate at Centerport, Long Island. An avid collector of natural history and marine specimens as well as other anthropological objects, he traveled extensively aboard his yacht as well as overland to numerous destinations around the globe. He acquired a vast array of artifacts for his collection during his well-documented travels and after service with the United States Navy during World War I, he published a book titled &quot;A Trip Through Sicily, Tunisia, Algeria, and Southern France&quot;.&quot; A few years later, he engaged William Belanske, an artist from the American Museum of Natural History to take part with him in a scientific voyage to the Galapagos Islands. By 1922, Vanderbilt had commissioned the construction of a single-story building on his Long Island estate to serve as a public museum, and less than a decade later a second story was added on to accommodate the growing collection. William Belanske, who had accompanied Vanderbilt on his Galapagos voyage, was employed as the full-time curator of this museum.

===Military service===

In 1913, Vanderbilt traded in his steam turbine yacht &quot;Tarantula&quot; for a new motor yacht, also named . On May 9, 1917, the United States Navy commissioned the second &quot;Tarantula&quot; at Brooklyn Navy Yard as a patrol boat, with the hull number SP-124, and appointed Lieutenant Vanderbilt as its commander. The Navy chartered the yacht from him for the duration of the war. He was assigned to patrol duty in the waters of the 3rd Naval District, and escorted convoys in waters off New York and New Jersey. On October 1, 1917, he was released from active duty and given a temporary leave of absence to resume his duties of vice-president of the New York Central Railroad. A few months later, he was elected president of the New York Central Railroad and acted in this capacity for the remainder of the war.

After the war, Vanderbilt was promoted to the rank of lieutenant commander in the Naval Reserve on May 17, 1921. He remained in the Naval Reserve until he was transferred to the Honorary Retired List on January 1, 1941, for physical disability.

===Residences===
In 1925, he traded the luxury yacht &quot;Eagle&quot; for ownership of Fisher Island, Florida, a place he used as a winter residence. He built a mansion complete with docking facilities for his yacht, a seaplane hangar, tennis courts, swimming pool, and an eleven-hole golf course. This home was called &quot;Alva Base&quot; and the architect was Maurice Fatio. In addition to this property, and his Long Island estate, &quot;Eagle&#x27;s Nest&quot;, which was designed by Warren &amp; Wetmore, Vanderbilt also owned a farm in Tennessee and Kedgwick Lodge, a hunting lodge designed for his father by architect Stanford White, on the Restigouche River in New Brunswick, Canada.

==Personal life==
In 1899, Vanderbilt married Virginia Graham Fair (1875–1935), a wealthy heiress whose father, James Graham Fair, had made a fortune in mining the famous Comstock Lode. They spent their honeymoon at the &quot;Idle Hour&quot; estate but disaster struck when fire broke out and the mansion burned to the ground. Before their separation and divorce, Vanderbilt and his wife had a son and two daughters, the younger of whom was named for his sister:

* Muriel Vanderbilt (1900–1972), who married three times, the first in 1925 to Frederic Cameron Church, Jr. She later married Henry Delafield Phelps and John Payson Adams.
* Consuelo Vanderbilt (1903–2011) who first married Earl E. T. Smith (1903-1991), the U.S. Ambassador to Cuba, in 1926. They divorced in 1935 and she married to Henry Gassaway Davis III (1902-1984), who was and the grandson of Henry G. Davis and recently divorced from her cousin, Grace Vanderbilt. They divorced in 1940 and she married William John Warburton III (1895-1979) in 1941. They divorced in 1946 and in 1951, she married Noble Clarkson Earl Jr. (1900–1969).
* William Kissam Vanderbilt III (1907–1933), who inherited his father&#x27;s love of fast cars and exotic travel, was killed in an automobile accident in South Carolina while driving home to New York City from his father&#x27;s Florida estate.

The Vanderbilts separated after ten years of marriage but did not formally divorce until 1927 when he wanted to remarry. Divorce proceedings were handled by his New York lawyers while he and Rosamund Lancaster Warburton (1897–1947), a former wife of Barclay Harding Warburton II and an heir to the John Wanamaker department store fortune, waited discreetly away from the media at a home in the Parisian suburb of Passy, France. When the divorce was final, the couple were married at the &quot;Hotel de Ville&quot; (city hall) in Paris on September 5, 1927. Vanderbilt became a legal stepfather to Barclay Harding Warburton III once they wed.

Vanderbilt died on January 8, 1944, of a heart ailment. He was interred in the Vanderbilt Family Cemetery and Mausoleum on Staten Island, New York. His estate was valued at $35,815,614, from which approximately $18,844,000 in Federal Estate Taxes and $5,600,000 in New York Estate taxes were deducted.

===Legacy===
In 1931, Vanderbilt had the Krupp Germaniawerft in Kiel, Germany, build for him the 264-foot diesel yacht &quot;Alva&quot;. The &quot;Alva&quot; was donated by Vanderbilt to the U.S. Navy on November 4, 1941. The &quot;Alva&quot; was converted to a gunboat and commissioned as the USS &quot;Plymouth&quot; (PG-57) on December 29, 1941. The &quot;Plymouth&quot; was primarily employed as a convoy escort on the East Coast and in the Caribbean and was sunk by a torpedo from a German U-boat on August 5, 1943, at 21.39 with the loss of 95.

By the 1940s, Vanderbilt had organized his will so that, upon his death, the &quot;Eagle&#x27;s Nest&quot; property along with a $2 million upkeep fund would be given to Suffolk County, New York, to serve as a public museum. Since 1950, the site has operated as the Suffolk County Vanderbilt Museum.

<text>Oualata or Walata () (also Biru in 17th century chronicles) is a small oasis town in southeast Mauritania, located at the eastern end of the Aoukar basin. Oualata was important as a caravan city in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries as the southern terminus of a trans-Saharan trade route and now it is a World Heritage Site.

The whole Oualata commune has a total size of 93,092 km², mostly consisting of desert. The main town is located in the south of the commune.

==History==
The Oualata area is believed to have been first settled by an agro-pastoral people akin to the Mandé Soninke people who lived along the rocky promontories of the Tichitt-Oualata and Tagant cliffs of Mauritania facing the Aoukar basin. There, they built what are among the oldest stone settlements on the African continent.

The town formed part of the Ghana Empire and grew wealthy through trade. At the beginning of the thirteenth century Oualata replaced Aoudaghost as the principal southern terminus of the trans-Saharan trade and developed into an important commercial and religious centre. By the fourteenth century the city had become part of the Mali Empire.

An important trans-Saharan route began at Sijilmasa and passed through Taghaza with its salt mines and ended at Oualata. The French historian estimated that in the Middle Ages the town would have accommodated between 2000 and 3000 inhabitants. 

Moroccan explorer Ibn Battuta found the inhabitants of Oualata were Muslim and mainly Massufa, a section of the Sanhaja. He was surprised by the great respect and independence that women enjoyed. He only gives a brief description of the town itself: &quot;My stay at Iwalatan (Oualata) lasted about fifty days; and I was shown honour and entertained by its inhabitants. It is an excessively hot place, and boasts a few small date-palms, in the shade of which they sow watermelons. Its water comes from underground waterbeds at that point, and there is plenty of mutton to be had.&quot; The town&#x27;s original Mande name &quot;Biru&quot; had already shifted to the Berber &quot;Iwalatan&quot;, a reflection of the changing identity of the residents. This would change again with the town&#x27;s Arabization, and the development of the current name, &quot;Walata&quot;.

From the second half of the fourteenth century Timbuktu gradually replaced Oualata as the southern terminus of the trans-Sahara route and it declined in importance, becoming an increasingly poor backwater in comparison to the previous wealth of the town. The Berber diplomat, traveller and author Leo Africanus visited the region in 1509–1510, and gives a description in his book &quot;Descrittione dell’Africa&quot;: &quot;Walata Kingdom: This is a small kingdom, and of mediocre condition compared to the other kingdoms of the blacks. In fact, the only inhabited places are three large villages and some huts spread about among the palm groves.&quot; By that time, the composition of the kingdom seems to have changed to reflect a large Songhai-speaking population residing within the town. &quot;The language of this region is called Songhai, and the inhabitants are black people, and the most friendly unto strangers.&quot; Oualata was a tributary of the Songhai Empire; also reflected within Africanus&#x27; book &quot;Descrittione dell’Africa&quot; explaining &quot;In my time this region was conquered by the king of Timbuktu and the prince of Oualata fled into the deserts, whereof the king granted him peace conditionally that he pay great yearly tribute and so the prince has remained tributary to the king of Timbuktu until this present.&quot;

==Description==
The old town covers an area of about 600 m by 300 m, some of it now in ruins. The sandstone buildings are coated with banco and some are decorated with geometric designs. The mosque now lies on the eastern edge of the town but in earlier times may have been surrounded by other buildings. Oualata is home to a manuscript museum, and is known for its highly decorative vernacular architecture. It was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996 together with Ouadane, Chinguetti and Tichitt.

<text>The C-One is a single-board computer (SBC) created in 2002 as an enhanced version of the Commodore 64, a home computer popular in the 1980s. Designed by Jeri Ellsworth and Jens Schönfeld from Individual Computers, who manufactured the boards themselves, the C-One has been re-engineered to allow cloning of other 8-bit computers.

==Design==
The machine uses a combination of configurable Altera field-programmable gate array (FPGA) chips and modular CPU expansion cards to create compatibility modes that duplicate the function of many older home computers. The default CPU is the W65C816S (by Western Design Center) which is used in Commodore 64 compatibility mode as well as the C-One&#x27;s native operating mode. The C-One is not merely a software emulator, it loads various core files from a card to configure the FPGA hardware to recreate the operation of the core logic chipsets found in vintage computers. This provides for a very accurate and customizable hardware emulation platform. The C-One is not limited to recreating historical computers: its programmable core logic can be used to create entirely new custom computer designs.

In 2004, the platform was expanded to include an Amstrad CPC core made by Tobias Gubener.

In 2006, Peter Wendrich ported his FPGA-64 project (originally intended for a Xilinx FPGA) and enhanced it for the C-One. This core supported both PAL and NTSC machine emulation, and aimed to be cycle-exact and emulate many of the bugs and quirks of the original hardware.

In 2008, after development of an &quot;Extender&quot; card which added a third FPGA, Tobias Gubener added Amiga 500 compatibility by porting Dennis van Weeren&#x27;s Minimig code to the board. This core replaced the physical 68000 CPU and the PIC chip from the original with his own TG68 CPU core on the FPGA. developments to this core include features not possible with the original Minimig board.

In 2009, Peter Wendrich released a &quot;preview&quot; of a next-generation C64 core called &quot;Chameleon 64&quot;, with a greatly expanded specification compared to his earlier core. A new version of the CPC core was also released in mid-2009, featuring an embedded SymbOS core for control of device emulation, and a clock unlocked mode for CPU speeds of up to 80 MHz.

So far, C-One circuit boards have been produced by German company Individual Computers, and they sell for €333 with the FPGA extender card.

<text>Douglas K. Ousterhout is a retired craniofacial surgeon who practiced in San Francisco, CA, United States. His specialty was facial feminization surgery for trans women, and he was widely considered the foremost facial feminization surgeon in the United States. 
Ousterhout also pioneered facial masculinization surgery for people undergoing female-to-male gender reassignment. Ousterhout received MD and DDS degrees from the University of Michigan Ann Arbor. He is a voluntary clinical professor of surgery in the School of Medicine and an adjunct professor of dentistry in the Dental School at University of California, San Francisco.

Facial feminization surgery (FFS) began in 1982 when Darrell Pratt, a plastic surgeon who performed sex reassignment surgeries, approached Ousterhout with a request from a trans woman, a patient of Pratt&#x27;s who wanted plastic surgery to make her face appear more feminine, since people still reacted to her as though she were a man. Ousterhout&#x27;s prior practice had involved reconstructing faces and skulls of people who had suffered birth defects, accidents or other trauma. Ousterhout was interested in helping but knew that he didn&#x27;t know what a &quot;female face&quot; was, so he investigated by first reading the physical anthropology from the early 20th century to identify what features were &quot;female&quot;, then by deriving measurements defining those features from a series of cephalograms taken in the 1970s, and then by working with a set of several hundred skulls to see if he could reliably differentiate which were females and which were males using those measurements. Ousterhout then began working out what surgical techniques and materials he already used that he could apply in order to transform a male face into a female face; he pioneered most of the procedures involved in FFS and was involved in their subsequent improvements as well.

FFS generally involves advancing the hairline, making the forehead smaller and rounder, reducing the brow ridge, shortening and narrowing the nose, shortening the upper lip, shortening the chin, narrowing the jaw, and reducing the laryngeal prominence. As of 2006 there were only about twelve surgeons in the world performing FFS.

Notable Ousterhout patients who have written about their surgery include Lynn Conway, Andrea James, and Nicole Hamilton.

== Wine ==
Ousterhout and wife Nancy also own and manage Ousterhout Wine and Vineyards. &quot;Wine &amp; Spirits&quot; website featured their 2012 Zinfandel as part of National Zinfandel Day in 2015 and their 2011 Zinfandel as part of the 2014 California Wine Month celebration.

== Personal life ==
Ousterhout lived in the &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot; home, which he bought in 1997. The title character in the movie, played by Robin Williams, is a divorced man who pretends to be an older female nanny so he can be around his children. Ousterhout briefly knew Williams and liked the connection, explaining, &quot;I turn boys&#x27; faces into girls&#x27; faces. It seemed only natural.&quot; In 2015, a disgruntled former patient tried to set the front door on fire.

<doc id="1273260" wikidata="Q1111851" url="?curid=1273260" title="Chapter II (Ashanti album)">
<text>Chapter II is the second studio album by American singer and songwriter Ashanti. It was released by Murder Inc. and Def Jam Records on July 1, 2003, in the United States. Ashanti reteamed with Murder Inc. head Irv Gotti and producer Chink Santana to work on the album. &quot;Chapter II&quot; features a guest appearance by rapper Ja Rule, Chink Santana, and Gunnz. Critical reception towards the album was generally mixed, with critics commending the album&#x27;s autobiographical lyrics, and its fun yet light nature, while other critics felt &quot;Chapter II&quot; lacked creativity and personality and relied too heavily on the formula of her debut album (2002).

Upon its release, the album debut at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart with first-week sales of 326,000 units. It also reached the top ten in Canada, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. &quot;Chapter II&quot; was eventually certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in August 2003 and gained gold status in Japan and the United Kingdom. At the 46th Annual Grammy Awards, it earned Ashanti three nominations for Best Contemporary R&amp;B Album, Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance, and Best R&amp;B Song. &quot;Chapter II&quot; spawned three singles, including the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number two song &quot;Rock wit U (Awww Baby)&quot;, the R&amp;B ballad &quot;Rain on Me&quot; and &quot;Breakup 2 Makeup (Remix)&quot;.

== Promotion ==
Murder Inc. selected &quot;Rock wit U (Awww Baby),&quot; which they considered a continuation from her debut single &quot;Foolish&quot; (2002), to be released as the album&#x27;s first single from &quot;Chapter 2&quot;. Issued on May 19, 2003, the song became a commercial success stateside and Ashanti&#x27;s third solo top ten hit. It peaked at number two on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, while reaching number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Internationally, it was a moderate success, reaching the top five in Canada and Japan, the top ten in the United Kingdom, top twenty in Australia, and the top forty in Ireland, New Zealand, and Switzerland.

The album&#x27;s second single &quot;Rain on Me&quot;, was released on August 11, 2003. It peaked at number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number two on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Elsewhere, it reached the top twenty in Belgium and the United Kingdom. In 2004, &quot;Rain on Me&quot; earned Ashanti a Grammy Award nomination for Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance. In 2004, a remix version of &quot;Breakup 2 Makeup&quot; featuring labelmate Black Child was released as a single. It served as the lead single from Ashanti&#x27;s remix compilation album &quot;Collectables by Ashanti&quot;, released in 2005, reaching number 76 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;Chapter II&quot; received mixed reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 51, based on 11 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews. &quot;The New York Times&quot; writer Kelefa Sanneh remarked that &quot;Chapter II&quot; &quot;isn&#x27;t perfect, but once you edit out the skits (which are, without exception, excruciating), you&#x27;re left with an album that&#x27;s graceful, beguiling and above all, light, in the best sense of the word.&quot; &quot;People&quot; magazine noted that &quot;the singer&#x27;s sophomore CD, though, proves wrong those who thought she would be a one-hit-album wonder. &quot;Chapter II&quot;, which continues the same hip-hop soul theme as her self-titled debut, is the equivalent of a good beach read: It&#x27;s easy, breezy listening that doesn&#x27;t require much brainpower.&quot;

&quot;Billboard&quot; wrote that &quot;Chapter II&quot; &quot;doesn&#x27;t stray too far from its predecessor&quot; and complimented the autobiographical songs on the album. Ernest Hardy from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; found that the &quot;album is filled with the same beat-driven, slickly produced midtempo tracks and ballads that made up her debut [and] the disc&#x27;s best moments have a decidedly old-school feel to them [...] Still, dullard schoolgirl insights into love and heartache dominate the album; add some boring between-song skits about &#x27;haters,&#x27; and &quot;Chapter&quot; II wears thin long before its halfway mark.&quot; While he complimented Ashanti for her writing credits on the album, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; journalist Tom Sinclair felt that &quot;&quot;Chapter II&quot; is too mired in tired R&amp;B conventions to achieve true magnificence.&quot;

Allmusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine found that &quot;the songs have about as much personality as Ashanti&#x27;s voice, but that actually is a point in its favor, since it keeps everything on an even keel and makes Gotti and Santana&#x27;s stylish production the star. They are the secret ingredients that make &quot;Chapter II good&quot; romantic mood music for the summer.&quot; Alexa Camp from &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; wrote that &quot;the album&#x27;s got some great tunes, but they&#x27;d be better suited for someone like Mary J. Blige, whom Shany &amp; Co. bite off.&quot; Robert Christgau gave &quot;Chapter II&quot; a &quot;C&quot; rating in his review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, calling it a &quot;pathologically modest follow-up.&quot; PopMatters from Maurice Bottomley assured that &quot;&quot;Chapter 2&quot; is not going to feature as any scribe&#x27;s R&amp;B album of the year.&quot;

== Commercial performance ==
In the United States, &quot;Chapter II&quot; debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with first-week sales of 326,000 units sold. While it became Ashanti&#x27;s second chart topper, it was a considerable decline from her previous effort &quot;Ashanti&quot;, which had opened to sales of 502,500 units in April 2002. In total, it remained on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart for 30 consecutive weeks. In addition, it reached the top position on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top R&amp;B/Hip Hop Albums chart, where it stayed at the top spot for two consecutive weeks. On August 14, 2003, The album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Towards the end of 2003, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked the album at number 54 and 27 respectively on its &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums year end chart lists. By January 2005, &quot;Chapter II&quot; had sold 1.5 million copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

Elsewhere, &quot;Chapter II&quot; reached the top five on the Canadian and UK Singles Chart. It was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), indicating sales in excess of 100,000 copies, and also went gold in Japan. In Switzerland, it reached the top ten, debuting and peaking at number nine on the Swiss Albums Chart, making it Ashanti&#x27;s highest-charting album to date. &quot;Chapter II&quot; also entered the top 20 in Australia and Germany. To date, the album has sold 3 million copies worldwide.

<text>The State Anthem of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic was the national anthem of Uzbekistan when it was a republic of the former Soviet Union.

==Background==
The anthem was used 1947 to 1991. The music was composed by Mutal Burkhanov, and the words were written by Timur Fattah and Turab Tula. The anthem, such as those of the Tajik SSR and the Turkmen SSR, opens with a salute to the Russian people. The Uzbeks are not mentioned until the fourth line.

The melody is used in the current national anthem of Uzbekistan, with different lyrics. It is one of the four remaining post-Soviet countries, along with Russia, Belarus, and Tajikistan, to continuously use their Soviet-era anthems with different lyrics. The Soviet-era lyrics were removed after the Uzbek SSR changed its name to the Republic of Uzbekistan and declared independence on 31 August 1991, when Abdulla Oripov wrote new lyrics adopted in 1992.

<text>The Puijo tower is an observation tower at the top of Puijo hill in Kuopio, Eastern Finland. Opened in 1963, the tower is tall and has a revolving restaurant with 100 seats. It was the first tower with a revolving restaurant in the Nordic countries. The restaurant was an inspiration to Erkki Lindfors, the mayor of Tampere, who got the idea to build a similar one in his home town, resulting in the Näsinneula tower, which opened in 1971. The current Puijo tower has been visited by over 5.5 million tourists.

The current tower is the third overall. When it was completed on 27 July 1963, the second one, built in 1906, was dismantled. The first tower was built in 1856. On the western side of the tower there are three ski jumping hills.

<doc id="1273278" wikidata="Q2727828" url="?curid=1273278" title="Vanderbilt Cup">
<text>The Vanderbilt Cup was the first major trophy in American auto racing.

==History==
An international event, it was founded by William Kissam Vanderbilt II in 1904 and first held on October 8 on a course set out in Nassau County on Long Island, New York. The announcement that the race was to be held caused considerable controversy in New York, bringing a flood of legal actions in an attempt to stop the race. The politicians soon jumped in, holding public hearings on the issue. Vanderbilt prevailed and the inaugural race was run over a course of winding dirt roads through the Nassau County area.

Vanderbilt put up a large cash prize hoping to encourage American manufacturers to get into racing, a sport already well organized in Europe that was yielding many factory improvements to motor vehicle technology. The race drew the top drivers and their vehicles from across the Atlantic Ocean, some of whom had competed in Europe&#x27;s Gordon Bennett Cup. The first Long Island race featured seventeen vehicles and the newspaper and poster art promotion drew large crowds hoping to see an American car defeat the mighty European vehicles. However, George Heath won the race in a Panhard and another French vehicle, a Darracq, took the Cup the next two years straight. Crowd control was a problem from the start and after a spectator, Curt Gruner, was killed in 1906, the race was cancelled. Meanwhile, in France, the first Grand Prix motor racing event had been run on June 26, 1906, under the auspices of the Automobile Club de France in Le Mans. One of the competitors was American Elliot Shepard, the son of Margaret Vanderbilt-Shepard and a cousin of William Kissam Vanderbilt.

Learning from his cousin about the success of the French Grand Prix and the rapid expansion of Grand Prix racing in other European countries, William Vanderbilt conceived a way to solve the safety issue as well as improve attendance to his race. Vanderbilt formed a company to build the Long Island Motor Parkway, one of the country&#x27;s first modern paved parkways that could not only be used for the race but would open up Long Island for easy access and economic development. Construction began in 1907 of the multimillion-dollar toll highway, to run from the Kissena Corridor in Queens County over numerous bridges and overpasses to Lake Ronkonkoma, a distance of . The 1908 race was held over parts of the new highway and much to the delight of the large crowd on hand, 23-year-old local hero George Robertson from Garden City, New York became the first American to win the event driving the American Locomobile, which was the company&#x27;s first gas-powered car and designed by famed engineer Andrew L. Riker (built in Bridgeport, Connecticut) &quot;(in 1908, George Robertson (wearing #16) took the win in this car, ahead of fellow Locomobile pilot Joe Florida in third, becoming the first United States-built car to win in international competition)&quot;.

The Vanderbilt Cup was held successfully on Long Island until 1911 when it was showcased at Savannah, Georgia in combination with the American Grand Prize. The next year it moved to a racecourse in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, then for three years in California: Santa Monica in 1914 and 1916, San Francisco in 1915. The race was canceled after the United States joined the Allies in World War I in 1917. Some of the drivers who participated in the Vanderbilt Cup became famous names, synonymous with automobiles and racing such as Louis Chevrolet, Vincenzo Lancia and Ralph DePalma.

The Vanderbilt Cup was not held again until 1936 when William Kissam Vanderbilt II&#x27;s nephew, George Washington Vanderbilt III picked up the cause and sponsored a race at the new facilities at Roosevelt Raceway. Once again, the Europeans were enticed by the substantial prize money and Scuderia Ferrari entered three Alfa Romeo racers. A lack of American competition and a less-than-exciting course layout saw the race run for only two years, both won by Europeans.

==Trophies==
The original Cup is cast of silver and measures 2.5 feet (0.76 m) in height. It bears the image of William K. Vanderbilt II driving his record-setting Mercedes at the Daytona Beach Road Course in 1904. The trophy today is stored at a Smithsonian Institution storage facility and is not available to be seen by the public.

The George Vanderbilt Cup is on display at Museo Nicolis in Verona.

== 1960s attempted revivals ==

After the 1937 event, the Vanderbilt name would not return to the United States motor racing scene for more than twenty years. During the 1960s, in an attempt to &quot;leverage the legacy&quot; the of Vanderbilt Cup history and name, the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) sanctioned several events featuring tertiary levels of competition, with the exception of the 1960 event, which drew two notable drivers: Jim Rathmann and Rodger Ward. Sponsored by Cornelius Vanderbilt IV, the 1960 race was run as a Formula Junior event and held again at Roosevelt Raceway. In 1965, 1967, and 1968, the Bridgehampton Sports Car Races were billed as the Vanderbilt Cup. Upon conclusion of the SCCA-sanctioned Bridgehampton event in 1968, the Vanderbilt Cup name disappeared for 28 years.

==Revival trophy==
In 1996, the sport of Indy car racing had become embroiled in a &quot;Split&quot; between Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART) and the Indy Racing League (IRL). Tony George, the owner of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and the IRL, announced that the top 25 entries in IRL points standings would be guaranteed starting positions in the 1996 Indianapolis 500. That would leave only 8 &quot;at-large&quot; spots for the CART-based teams. On December 18, 1995 CART teams, convinced they were being deliberately locked out from the 1996 Indy 500, and the victims of a &quot;power grab&quot; by Tony George, announced their intentions to boycott that event. The owners, along with CART president and CEO Andrew Craig, jointly announced plans for a new race, the Inaugural U.S. 500, to be held at Michigan International Speedway the same day.

In an attempt to enhance the prestige of their new event and in recognition of William Kissam Vanderbilt&#x27;s place in automotive racing history, CART had a facsimile of the original Vanderbilt Cup created as the winner&#x27;s trophy for the 1996 U.S. 500. After only one running, the U.S. 500 on Memorial Day weekend was discontinued. The &quot;U.S. 500&quot; name was instead used for the July race (formerly known as the Michigan 500).

After serving as the U.S. 500 winner&#x27;s trophy through 1999, CART designated the Vanderbilt Cup as its series championship trophy in 2000. Names of U.S. 500 winners from 1996 to 1999, and the CART series champions from 2000 on-wards, were to be etched into the new Cup. Upon CART&#x27;s demise in 2003 its successor, the Champ Car World Series (CCWS), continued using the Vanderbilt Cup copy.

After the bankruptcy of the CCWS in 2008 its assets were purchased by the IRL, unifying the most prestigious level of American open-wheel racing under a single sanctioning body. Tony George expressed an interest in having the Vanderbilt Cup copy replace the IRL&#x27;s then-current Indy car National Champion&#x27;s trophy, known as the Silver Cup. However, no change was made. Since the 2011 season the IRL - rebranded as the IndyCar Series since 2012 - has awarded National Champions the Astor Challenge Cup.

<text>W.I.T.C.H. (stylised as W.i.t.c.h.) is an Italian fantasy Disney comics series created by Elisabetta Gnone, Alessandro Barbucci, and Barbara Canepa. The series features a group of five teenage girls who become the guardians of the classical elements of energy, water, fire, earth, and air, and protectors of the mythical Kandrakar, the center of the universe. The story follows them as they handle their new magical powers and responsibilities, as well as their lives as adolescents. The comics art illustration heavy inspiration from manga and its illustrations conventions. The names of the five characters form the titular acronym, despite the characters not actually being witches.

The series was first published by Disney Italy in April 2001. The final issue of &quot;W.I.T.C.H.&quot; was released in October 2012, concluding the series&#x27; 139 issue run.

The comics spawned a franchise with a variety of printed media, including both reprinted and original content, as well as audiovisual media. The first two arcs (&quot;The Twelve Portals&quot; and &quot;Nerissa&#x27;s Revenge&quot;) were loosely adapted into an animated series, itself influenced by anime, which aired from 2004 to 2006. In 2005, a video game based on the franchise was released in Europe, and in 2007 a soundtrack album including theme songs for the TV series as well as music inspired by the comics was released.

In 2004, series creators Alessandro Barbucci and Barbara Canepa unsuccessfully sued Disney for rights to &quot;W.I.T.C.H.&quot; after issues with management at the publishing company. As a result, Canepa founded her own comics company.

On October 4, 2023, a reboot graphic novel, &quot;W.I.T.C.H. - Il cuore dell&#x27;amicizia&quot;, was published in Italy.

==Background and production==
Upon seeing the success of &quot;PKNA - Paperinik New Adventures&quot; with young male audiences, some of the writers began thinking of a similar concept that would work for young female audiences. Elisabetta Gnone, Alessandro Barbucci and Barbara Canepa came up with the original concepts and designs. Gnone co-wrote the first issue of the series with Francesco Artibani. Gnone and Artibani originally created a concept that would last nine issues, but upon seeing the impressive sales numbers, a further three issues were ordered, rounding out the 12-issue first saga.

In 2004, tensions arose between the &quot;W.I.T.C.H.&quot; artists and Disney&#x27;s publishing (Buena Vista). Series creators Barbucci and Canepa unsuccessfully sued Disney for the initial rights to &quot;W.I.T.C.H.&quot;, with Artibani acting as a witness in support of the two artists in court. After the lawsuit failed, Artibani and other artists decided to end their working relationships with Disney due to the &quot;difficult management and company.&quot;

After breaking off with Buena Vista and in the middle of her trial against them, Canepa created her own comic book company, Soleil. She described it as a way to become &quot;more sincere and uncensored&quot; with her comics. Soleil was unable to secure the rights to &quot;W.I.T.C.H.&quot; from Disney, and instead focused on original projects. Canepa stated that she intended to keep all the rights to her comics; she said, &quot;After my experience with Disney, it&#x27;s important for me to protect myself.&quot;

Around the same time as the rights trial, Disney filed an unsuccessful copyright infringement lawsuit against Rainbow SpA, the studio behind &quot;Winx Club&quot; (a series cited as the main competition for &quot;W.I.T.C.H.&quot;). In its April 2004 suit, the corporation claimed the &quot;Winx Club&quot; concept copied that of &quot;W.I.T.C.H.&quot;; all of the claims were rejected in August, when Rainbow SpA won the case against Disney by providing proof that &quot;Winx Club&quot; production began before the &quot;W.I.T.C.H.&quot; comic was available. 

== Characters ==
The main characters are the five current Guardians (with respective elemental powers in parentheses):

*Wilhelmina &quot;Will&quot; Vandom (energy)
*Irma Lair (water)
*Taranee Cook (fire)
*Cornelia Hale (earth)
*Hay Lin (air)

Each of the five Guardians&#x27; powers are fueled by Kandrakar itself, and transmitted to the Heart via the Aurameres, the physical representations of the five elements in the forms of colored orbs. The Aurameres grant the same powers to each generation of Guardians.

When the Guardians transform, they change form and grow wings. The wings do not allow them to fly (except for Hay Lin), but after they get the New Powers they can all fly.

== Setting ==

=== Heatherfield ===
Located on Earth, this city is the home of the five Guardians.

===Kandrakar===
A sacred, ethereal, spiritual world in the very center of the entire universe itself, where time and space do not exist. In the Fortress, the wisest of thousands of other planets and worlds are gathered to discuss the state of the worlds which are of their concern. They simply observe and do not interfere. The fifth and last Guardian is rightful keeper of the mystical Heart of Kandrakar, an ancient and immensely powerful crystal orbicular pendant which gives the girls&#x27; their ability to transform into their taller, stronger and more elaborate Guardian costumes. Hay Lin&#x27;s paternal grandmother lives here with the Oracle when she &quot;dies&quot; unexpectedly on Earth.

=== Metamoor ===
Metamoor is a world ruled by the Escanor, who originates from Earth. For a long time Metamoor, and its capital Meridian, was isolated from the rest of the universe because it was ruled by the evil prince Phobos. With help of the Guardians and the Meridian people the rightful heiress to the throne, Elyon, could reign again. Elyon is the last of the Escanor.

=== Arkhanta ===
Arkhanta is an Earth-like world ruled by Ari. Ari accused the Oracle for not wanting to cure his son. Even the banshee Yua was unable to help him. With trickery, Ari could keep Yua in his scarlet citadel forever. Despite all this, Ari brought prosperity to his people. Knowing they had received everything thanks to the powers of Yua, the people are both happy and disturbed. Fortunately, after the Guardians released Yua and healed Ari&#x27;s son Maqui, any threat of Yua&#x27;s anger was over. On his turn Ari ended his hostility against Kandrakar.

===Basiliade===
Basiliade is the home world of the Oracle (Himerish), Endarno, and Orube. It makes up part of a binary solar system.

==Comics==
=== Part I: The Twelve Portals ===
The first saga introduced a world called Metamoor, ruled by a tyrannical ruler named Prince Phobos. Years ago, Prince Phobos caused the disappearances of his parents and took over the capital city of Metamoor, Meridian. To prevent him from spreading tyranny throughout the universe, the Oracle - the ruler of Kandrakar - lowered a veil over the planet, separating Metamoor from the rest of the universe under Kandrakar&#x27;s protection. However, twelve portals opened between Meridian and Earth, creating a series of passageways for the desperate refugees and monsters of Meridian to infiltrate Earth. The portals also weakened the veil; in order to prevent its total collapse, generations of Guardians were sent to protect it. In the present day, five girls are chosen to become the new Guardians: Will Vandom, the Guardian of Energy and the Keeper of the Heart; Irma Lair, the new Guardian of Water; Taranee Cook, the Guardian of Fire; Cornelia Hale, the Guardian of Earth; and Hay Lin, the Guardian of Air. Together, they must prevent the collapse of the veil and promote justice throughout the universe under the guidance of the Oracle of Kandrakar.

The first saga also introduced Elyon Brown, a childhood friend of Cornelia. The Guardians&#x27; first mission was to close the twelve portals, but as they found out for themselves, Elyon had betrayed them. It is revealed that Elyon is Prince Phobos&#x27;s younger sister who had disappeared from Meridian more than a decade ago. After Prince Phobos&#x27;s right-hand man, Lord Cedric, revealed Elyon of her true alien heritage, he manipulated her into thinking that the Guardians were her enemies. The Guardians had to find a way to defeat Prince Phobos and bring Elyon back home. In Meridian, however, there is a rebellion taking place led by Caleb, whom Cornelia had seen in her dreams for years. They sought to overthrow Prince Phobos and put Elyon on the throne, as she is the legitimate ruler. The Guardians later worked together with the rebels and eventually, Elyon realized her mistake for trusting Lord Cedric. Prince Phobos had planned to absorb his sister&#x27;s powers for himself during her coronation, but with the Guardians&#x27; help Elyon escaped and later battled against him for the crown. The final battle was successful, but not without some losses. Prince Phobos transformed Caleb back into a crystal flower, his most primitive form as a Murmurer. This devastated Cornelia greatly to the point where it would haunt her in the next series. As Elyon is crowned Queen and the Light of Meridian, the world of Metamoor is finally liberated. The Oracle lifted the veil off of Metamoor and light shines on the world once again. Both Prince Phobos and Cedric are imprisoned in the Tower of Mist.

=== Part II: Nerissa&#x27;s Revenge ===
The Guardians must face an old enemy of Kandrakar – Nerissa, the corrupted ex-Guardian and the previous Keeper of the Heart. When the Oracle realized how the immense power of the Heart was corrupting Nerissa, he took it away from her and gave it to Cassidy, the former Guardian of Water. Obsessed with her lost power and blinded by jealousy, Nerissa tricked Cassidy and killed her. As punishment, Nerissa was stripped of her magic and sentenced to sleep, alone and friendless, in Mount Thanos for an eternity, only until all five elements-Water, Fire, Earth, Air and Pure/Absolute Energy- united into one single being.

When Cornelia accidentally, and unknowingly, absorbed all five elements into herself, the seal on Nerissa&#x27;s tomb broke, setting her free. When Caleb is kidnapped, the Guardians must face Nerissa along with her four Knights of Vengeance. While successful in their rescue mission, they end up losing Luba who sacrificed herself to save them. Hoping to steal the Heart she craved for so long, Nerissa later attacked the girls through their dreams in order to weaken them but failed. She was later successful in stealing the Heart back by tricking Will into giving it to her.

With the very symbol and essence of Kandrakar itself now entirely corrupted by Nerissa&#x27;s hatred and vengeance, the former Guardian leader and her Knights of Vengeance attacked the sacred Temple of Kandrakar itself. Will later acquired the Star of Cassidy, a copy of the mystical Heart from the spirit/ghost of Cassidy, the late and original Guardian of Water. With it, Will and her fellow Guardians faced Nerissa in Kandrakar. In the final battle, Nerissa was ultimately destroyed by the combined strength of the second generation of Guardians. Despite their victory, Cornelia is deeply heartbroken when Caleb left her due to their complicated relationship.

=== Part III: A Crisis on Both Worlds ===
Crisis after crisis threatens to break up the girls once and for all. Will&#x27;s father, Thomas Vandom, returns into her life after years of absence, and his intentions are anything but loving and trustful. Later, Taranee went on strike because she felt that the Oracle is using them to carry out his missions and sentences. A new character, Orube, joins the remaining Guardians on their new mission to defeat a new enemy; Ari, the powerful lord of Arkhanta and they must prevent him from rising and destroying the Oracle. Ari&#x27;s son, Maqi, suffered from a strange disorder since birth and the Oracle had refused to help Ari cure his son. Angered and blinded by rage, Ari captured a banshee, named Yua, and tried to use her wish-granting power to oppose the Oracle and Kandrakar (but it could not be done). The longer Yua was held prisoner and serving as Ari&#x27;s slave, the more powerful Ari becomes, and soon, he would have enough power to overthrow the Oracle.

Taranee later rejoined the quintet and together, they were able to defeat Ari and set Yua free. Liberated, Yua kidnapped Maqi because she wanted Ari to suffer for holding her imprisoned for many years against her will. Ari and the Guardians followed her into the swamp where she and her banshee sisters live and fought them to bring Maqi back. However, Maqi was nearly killed during the confusion of the battle. He was later saved and cured when the Guardians and Orube offered their magical, elemental gifts from the nymph Xin Jing herself to him.

Although their missions on the world Arkhanta was successful, the girls have a whole bunch of new problems on Earth that needs their attention: Interpol discovers the secret of the five Guardians&#x27; and wants to capture them and use their astounding abilities as Guardians of Kandrakar for their dark intentions. As if that was not enough, the girls&#x27; Astral Drops decide to rebel after months of being taken advantage of by the Guardians. The Astral Drops started to cause numerous problems between the Guardians&#x27; families, teachers, and individual boyfriends&#x27; and eventually they ran away to another city. The Guardians later recaptured the Astral Drops and decided to liberate them from slavery by sending to another city entirely.

=== Part IV: Trial of the Oracle ===
The members of the Congregation are questioning the Oracle&#x27;s recent actions, and he shocked everyone by putting himself on trial. The Guardians are called in to recall his recent unsatisfactory deeds and he was later found guilty by Endarno and was banished back into his home world, Basilíade. Back home in Heatherfield, Will confronted Orube and Matt, while Principal Knickerbocker goes to drastic measures to raise the girls&#x27; grades at Sheffield. In Kandrakar, the council has elected Endarno the new Oracle. After Endarno has been chosen, he makes the life of the Guardians difficult by trying to prove to the Congregation that they are too young and immature. He also convinced the Congregation that Elyon, the queen and the Light of Meridian, is dangerous and unfit to rule over Metamoor. Many times he tried to get the Guardians to arrest their old friend and bring him the Crown of Light. But W.I.T.C.H. managed to hide Elyon from Endarno by smuggling her back to Earth and had Orube protect her. Moreover, Endarno is someone else than he appears to be...an old enemy coming back for revenge and an even bigger thirst for more power. 
Elyon and Yan Lin discovered that &quot;Endarno&quot; is actually the consciousness and evil will of Prince Phobos, who has been using the physical self of the true Endarno, in his new quest for power and revenge.

Queen Elyon then wields her vital life energy to Yan Lin, who then gives it to Will to hide within the Heart of Kandrakar for safeguarding. The Guardians were able locate the old Oracle, now called Himerish, upon the discovery of his old identity before leaving for Kandrakar, with the help of Orube. Together, they tried to free Elyon from her prison and put a stop to Cedric and Phobos before Endarno (Phobos) is formally instated as the Oracle. In the end, Himerish was able to locate the real Endarno and he, in turn, revealed to the Council that the Endarno that they knew was, in actuality, the malicious Prince Phobos&#x27; mind and spirit in his body. Elyon returned to power on her world of Meridian, Cedric was back in the Tower of Mist, and Prince Phobos, rather than being locked up in prison again, threw himself into the endless void of Kandrakar.

=== Part V: The Book of Elements ===
The five classical elements themselves have something in store for the Guardians who utilize and represent them. Each Guardian has discovered new and much stronger abilities, yet their elemental abilities are going out of control. Even the Triumvirate of Kandrakar does not have full understanding about it. At the same time, Cedric is disposed of his magical strength and power and gets a second chance from Oracle Himerish. He returns to &quot;Ye Olde Book Shop&quot; to live a decent life, under supervision from the Guardians. Nevertheless, he searches for a useful resource to regain his powers in hopes of getting revenge on the Guardians. He finds his luck in the Book of Elements, written by Jonathan Ludmoore (which the Guardians later found out). About a century before, Jonathan Ludmoore was an alchemist who came from Metamoor and it was Prince Phobos who had sent him to Heatherfield in order to open the Twelve Portals. After completing his mission, Ludmoore discovered that the city is a place where all five elements—Water, Fire, Earth, Air, Quintessence—met and stayed. He experimented on the elements but it trapped Ludmoore in his own book and released all five elemental stones throughout the city.

After Matt was swallowed by the Book of Elements (thanks to Cedric), the Guardians must cooperate with Cedric in order to save Matt. The book gives them riddles as clues and the Guardians must use these riddles to look for the scattered elemental stones. Endarno warned the Guardians that in order to capture these stones, they must face the Elemental Guards that stand and protect them. One by one, the girls were able to find the stones, and back in the bookstore, Cedric and Orube slowly fell deeply in love. However, the Guardians, Cedric, and Orube were sucked into the world of the book when Will refuses to surrender the Heart of Kandrakar. Cedric was later killed by Ludmoore and dissolved into ink when he tried to protect Orube from Ludmoore&#x27;s deadly gaze. The Guardians later found Matt and managed to defeat Ludmoore once and for all (with Matt&#x27;s help). While Orube mourns for Cedric&#x27;s death, Will&#x27;s mother, Susan Vandom, married her history teacher, Dean Collins. Orube left and a magical portal in the shape of the Heart of Kandrakar later appeared in the basement of the &quot;Ye Olde Book Shop&quot;.

=== Part VI: Ragorlang ===
When Hay Lin stayed over at the Lyndons&#x27; home, she meets Karl and Tecla Ibsen, an elderly couple who appeared to have a connection with Eric&#x27;s new school. Karl tells Hay Lin about the Ragorlang, a monster that absorbs the thoughts, the voices, and the sounds of its victims. Coincidentally, a few students at Eric&#x27;s school are getting inactive as if they had lost their youthful strength. The same evening, Hay Lin gets attacked by a Ragorlang and was saved just in time by the other Guardians. Soon they discover who is behind the new threat: Tecla Ibsen. She wanted to be young and beautiful again and used her magical ability to conjure up and control the Ragorlangs, ordering them to steal the youthful strength of the teenagers by absorbing their thoughts and voices. The Guardians managed to defeat her and her Ragorlang. Unfortunately, Tecla returns, but as a frail, older woman, who cannot summon a fully grown Ragorlang. Tecla brainwashed a magical girl named Erin, making her believe that the Guardians are the Ragorlangs and that it was their fault that her brother, Kader, went missing. At first, Erin uses her magic to make the girls hate each other while posing as an exchange student. The Guardians eventually helped her find her brother despite their hate for her.

This saga also introduced a strange optometrist, named Folkner, who stationed himself in Sheffield to monitor the students&#x27; health. The Guardians found out that he is a Ragorlang hunter who wishes to hunt down Tecla Ibsen. She later regain full power due to leaked magics from Kandrakar and attacked the Guardians with a new pact of Ragorlangs. Despite being able to use the Shadow Heart against the Guardians, she was defeated when the last of her Ragorlangs was absorbed into a box created by Folkner. Obsessed with the dark power, Folkner unleashed the powers and became a supreme Ragorlang himself. He was later killed by the Guardians and was sucked into his own Ragorlang box at the end of the saga, and Karl and Tecla were both accepted into the Congregation of Kandrakar after admitting their mistakes.

=== Part VII: New Power ===
The Guardians must face another, more ancient enemy: Dark Mother! She was once Queen Meter of Spring and made flowers bloom beneath her feet. But when she became corrupted, she transformed into &quot;the Dark Mother&quot; and attacked Kandrakar with a vengeance. She was ultimately defeated by the combined strength of the elemental Queens of Water, Fire and Air and was cast into the dark void where she continued to wait patiently in chains until she could be released. In silence, Dark Mother sent a seed and planted it deep within kandrakar, where it would serve as her infiltrator against the Fortress of Light.

The five Guardians of Kandrakar each receive further developed and considerably stronger Guardian powers over the five elements upon undergoing a vision-quest to unlock the very roots of their abilities as well as their highest potential. Matt now serves as their new trainer and mentor after being recruited by the Oracle to prepare them for their upcoming battle against Dark Mother. One by one, the Guardians found the root of their elements and obtained full control over their new and much stronger abilities. Meanwhile, Dark Mother escaped (thanks to Will) and set off to take over Kandrakar. Thanks to her tree, which she had planted beforehand, Dark Mother enslaved the minds of Kandrakar, except for Yan Lin. The Guardians later faced her in one last battle and Dark Mother was sealed in a stone tomb. Oracle Himerish relinquished his place to the original Air Guardian, Yan Lin, who foresaw the incoming threat and departed without even saying goodbye.

In the side story, Susan became pregnant to Dean&#x27;s child. Issue #80 focuses on the birth of Will&#x27;s younger half-brother, William Vandom-Collins who happens to possess a little magic of his own.

=== Part VIII: Teach 2b Witch ===
The Guardians must find and teach the magical people of Heatherfield how to fully control their new abilities. Oracle Yan Lin assisted them by giving them new weapons to help greatly strengthen and magnify their powers and abilities as well as the key to the W.I.T.C.H. Van, a special on-the-road-school which houses five magical laboratories connected to each Guardians&#x27; elements, personalities, and skills. Kandor, a member of the Congregation is sent to be their new bus driver and care-taker. Meanwhile, a new enemy is watching their every move: Foreman Takeda the CEO and scientist of Takeshita Inc. Takeda vowed to destroy all magic because he believed that it is responsible for his daughter&#x27;s illness. Mariko, his eldest daughter, discovered the Fast World and her mind now trapped there. Takeda enlisted the help of Liam, a mysterious boy that Mariko met in the Fast World and they fell in love, to spy on the Guardians and ordered him to kidnap Will&#x27;s little brother. Using Liam and William as bait, Takeda lured the Guardians into his lair and used his cold technologies to trap the Guardians into the &#x27;Fast World forever&#x27;. However, his plan was thwarted by his youngest daughter, Shinobu, who saw her father&#x27;s cruelty and had him frozen by his own robotic minions.

While looking for Liam and William in the Fast World, the Guardians encounter the malicious ruler Arkaam, the White Queen, who wished to rule all of the Fast World under her tyranny and possessed a deep desire to kill the Black Queen. It is revealed that the identity of the Black Queen is Mariko&#x27;s conscious and Shinobu&#x27;s sister. In the confusing of their escape, Liam was killed by the White Queen after she stabbed him with her sword. Although successful in bringing William back, Will and her friends are horrified that the White Queen and her army had followed them to their world. In their last battle, invading White Queen and her army were dissipated by the Guardians&#x27; powerful sound frequency. After hearing Mariko&#x27;s accusation and Shinobu&#x27;s forgiveness, Takeda forgot his vendetta and rejoined his family.

* Beginning from issue #97 onward, most W.I.T.C.H. comic issue is its own story.

=== Part IX: 100% Witch ===
Starting from issue #97 of the previous saga, each issue has its own story. The Guardians now face their daily problems from families, friends, and school. The stories ranged from facing their first day of returning to Sheffield Institute to finding out more about both of their parents&#x27; pasts and abilities. At the same time, they must face several new enemies who wanted to destroy them. Many of these villains included the Runics, a group of five evil wizards who control the dark powers of the elements; and Nihila, the Queen of Darkness who desire to weave and control everyone&#x27;s destinies with her magical Loom. The series also introduced new missions where the Guardians must assist the beings of the natural worlds; from listening to the voice of the Earth to helping Mareeve, the Saarineen, avoid marrying the King of the Sharks, Orristurr. Later on, the stories ranged from the girls delivering a letter to the North Pole, Dean&#x27;s parents visiting the girls and their mothers having lunch together.

=== Part X: Ladies vs. W.I.T.C.H. ===

== Reception ==

=== Critical response ===
Valentina De Zanche of &quot;i-D&quot; described the main characters of &quot;W.I.T.C.H&quot;. as the &quot;emblem of the Y2K style,&quot; writing, &quot;One of the strengths of the comic, which has become an essential model emulated by dozens of products of the same genre, was in fact to propose five protagonists with as many different and well-defined profiles in terms of character and, of course, of style and choice of looks. Despite being endowed with super powers, it was easy to empathize with one of the W.I.T.C.H. and feel like one of them, empathizing with their difficult situations and worrying about them when the secret of double identity was put at risk—always more fascinating trick than any superhero.&quot; Mara Pace of &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot; called &quot;W.I.T.C.H.&quot; a &quot;very successful product,&quot; saying, &quot;What prompted American Mickey Mouse managers to export this comic made in italy? The captivating narrative structure and the quality of the design, which mixes European tradition and Japanese suggestions, have certainly played a fundamental role.&quot; Beatrice Manca of &quot;Fanpage.it&quot; stated that the comic book series became a &quot;cult,&quot; stating, &quot;For many women now almost in their thirties, the W.I.T.C.H have been confidants, friends, models. Once transformed, with their wings and mythical green and purple costumes, they joined forces to fight enemies. But in everyday life they experienced the powers of friendship, loyalty, courage. They had their flaws: they quarreled, walked away, lied to their parents. But that&#x27;s exactly what we felt close to them: they were looking for their way.&quot;

&quot;La Nazione&quot; referred to &quot;W.I.T.C.H&quot; as a &quot;truly magical editorial phenomenon,&quot; asserting, &quot;The masterful characterization of the characters is among the most striking strengths of the series, along with the centrality given to the emotional sphere of the heroines.&quot; Laura Thornton of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; compared the &quot;W.I.T.C.H&quot; comic books to the 2004 television adaptation of the same name, writing, &quot;While both comic and show are wonderful stories, they aren&#x27;t the &quot;same&quot; story. The comic puts more focus on interpersonal relationships and realistically depicting how the girls come to terms with their newfound duties and friendship, while the show focuses more on the action, adventure and laughs to be had along the way.&quot; &quot;Fumettologica&quot; included &quot;W.I.T.C.H&quot; in their &quot;20 Comics To Remember Released In 2001&quot; list, asserting, &quot;Not (only) the best, not (only) guilty pleasure, but the most indicative of our memory, partly because they are truly representative of that publishing year, partly because their influence extended well beyond 2001 alone.&quot; 

=== Sales and revenue ===
In 2001, &quot;W.I.T.C.H.&quot; sold more than 6 million copies in the first year of its publication, making it the most successful tween magazine launch ever. In 2004, The Walt Disney Company announced that the &quot;W.I.T.C.H.&quot; comic book series was available in more than 60 countries, with more than 1 million copies of the comic book series being sold every month. In France and Germany, more than 100 000 copies were sold monthly. In Italy, more than 200 000 copies were sold every month. The company revealed that the &quot;W.I.T.C.H.&quot; comic book series sold more than 20 million copies worldwide and generated more than 100 million dollars. In 2005, the comic book series had been released in over 65 countries. The &quot;W.I.T.C.H.&quot; franchise generated more than $500 million in revenues so far, including from comic books sales. In 2022, Angelo Delos Trinos of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; called the comic book series a &quot;massive success&quot; in Scandinavia.

=== Accolades ===

<text>George Washington Vanderbilt III (September 23, 1914 – June 24, 1961) was an American yachtsman and scientific explorer who was a member of the prominent Vanderbilt family.

==Early life==
Born in Newport, Rhode Island, he was the younger son of Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt and Margaret Emerson. He was the brother of Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt Jr. and a half-brother to William Henry Vanderbilt III from his father&#x27;s first marriage to Ellen &quot;Elsie&quot; French. In 1915, when George was less than a year old, his father perished in the sinking of the RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot;. His inheritance was estimated as high as . He received the first quarter of his inheritance at 21, then 25, 30, and the last at 35. Contemporary newspaper articles covering the 1917 appraisal of his father&#x27;s estate in the New York Surrogate&#x27;s Court report that he received $2,553,204 under his father&#x27;s Will.

His mother, Margaret, remarried two more times, first to Raymond T. Baker, with whom she had a daughter, Gloria Baker (1920–1975), and second, to Charles Minot Amory.

He was a grandson of Cornelius Vanderbilt II and Alice Claypoole Gwynne and was named in honor of his great-great-uncle George Washington Vanderbilt and his great-uncle George Washington Vanderbilt II. Vanderbilt&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Isaac Edward Emerson, was a very wealthy businessman who made a fortune in a variety of business ventures including patent medicines, the most notable of which was Bromo-Seltzer. A sailing enthusiast, Emerson instilled a love for the sport in young George from an early age and as an adult, he used his sailing skills and wealth for scientific research.

He attended the St. Paul&#x27;s School in Concord, New Hampshire and the Adirondack-Florida School studying at the Saranac branch in New York as well as in Miami.

==Career==
In 1936 and 1937, George Vanderbilt sponsored a renewal of auto races for the Vanderbilt Cup, founded by his uncle, William Kissam Vanderbilt II, in 1904.

During World War II, he served in the U.S. Navy like his two brothers. He was promoted to lieutenant on May 1, 1943, and received the Legion of Merit award.

===Scientific research===
Vanderbilt did not attend college, but by the time he turned 21, he had already led two expeditions to Panama and Africa, with some lasting up to 10 months, bringing back various snakes, fish, insects and birds. In 1937, he went on a six month with the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences to the South Seas, bringing back 20,000 species of birds, fish and reptiles. He owned several yachts and used them to conduct scientific expeditions all over the globe. His voyages conducted important research in expeditions to Africa in 1934 and aboard the schooner &quot;Cressida&quot;, he made an ocean journey in 1937 to the South Pacific (visiting many islands with a wide geographic range) that carried out a systematic study of more than 10,000 fish specimens (434 species in 210 genera).

His fifth major expedition was on the schooner &quot;Pioneer&quot; in 1941 to the Bahamas, Caribbean Sea, Panama, Galapagos Archipelago and Mexican Pacific Islands.

He established the George Vanderbilt Foundation, of which he was president, for scientific research around marine biology. However, outside of academic circles, his important work has mostly been overshadowed by the lavish lifestyles and the Vanderbilt mansions of some of the other members of the Vanderbilt family.

==Personal life==

George Vanderbilt was married four times throughout his life. His first marriage was in 1935, when he married Lucille &quot;Lulu&quot; Miriam Parsons (1912–2013). Lulu was born in Montclair, New Jersey and her father, J. Lester Parsons, founded the international re-insurance firm of Crum &amp; Forster in 1896. Together, George and Lulu had:
*Lucille Margaret Vanderbilt (1938 - 2018), who was married to Philip Brady, Jr from 1958 until their divorce 1962. Later in 1962, she married Robert Mathews Balding, divorcing in 1970. Her third and final marriage was to Wallace Fennel Pate (1933-1993).

In 1950, the Vanderbilts divorced, and Lulu married Ronald Bush Balcom (d. 1994), a champion skier who had previous attained celebrity when he became the third husband of Standard Oil heiress Millicent Rogers. Also in 1950, George Vanderbilt married Anita C. Zabala Howard at his home in South Carolina. She was a descendant of one of California&#x27;s first Spanish families and the former wife of California sportsman Lindsay C. Howard. They divorced in 1958 after nearly 8 years of marriage.

In 1958, he married for the third time to Joyce &quot;Josh&quot; Branning, (1926–2016) daughter of Enid and Ralph Branning. They later divorced and, in 1963, she married Edward L. Doheny III (d. 1999), grandson of Edward L. Doheny.

On March 23, 1961, he married Louise Mitchell Paine in Scottsdale, Arizona. She was a member of the Board of Directors of the Children’s Cancer Fund of America and was the daughter of Harold E. Mitchell and had previously been married to Edward Bragg Paine (d. 1951). Edward&#x27;s widow later married Lord Malcolm Douglas-Hamilton. Vanderbilt&#x27;s marriage to Paine only lasted for three months as Vanderbilt died in June 1961.

===Residences===
In 1935, he purchased the Charles W. Sloane estate on Middle Neck Road in Sands Point on the Long Island Sound, shortly after his first marriage. In 1937, he had commissioned a home by society architects Treanor &amp; Fatio on the property. He sold the home to Henry Lustig, founder of the Longchamps chain of restaurants, in 1945.

In 1946, he purchased in Siskiyou County near Lake Shastina and the Shasta–Trinity National Forest in northern California. In 1949, he built a large ranch house known as &quot;Shadow Valley Ranch&quot;, along with a guest cottage, carriage house, tennis court, riding trails, waterfalls and several barns. The home was host to many important people of the times, including overnight guests Harry Truman, John Wayne, Audrey Hepburn, Spencer Tracy, Clark Gable, Alan Ladd and Ginger Rogers. The house was sold by his widow in 1990 and burned down in 2012.

He also lived in Honolulu, Hawaii for 25 years and owned the Arcadia Plantation in Georgetown, South Carolina, which had been purchased by his grandfather, Dr. Emerson, in 1906.

His former yacht, the &quot;Pioneer&quot;, is now the &quot;Yankee Clipper&quot;, which sails with passengers in the Caribbean for Windjammer Barefoot Cruises.

===Death===
On June 24, 1961, George Washington Vanderbilt apparently committed suicide by leaping from his 10th floor suite at the Mark Hopkins Hotel in San Francisco, California. His wife said he was despondent over unspecified business setbacks. Investigators found large amounts of alcohol in his blood stream.

<doc id="1273291" wikidata="Q6254136" url="?curid=1273291" title="John Ralston (American football)">
<text>John R. Ralston (April 26, 1927 – September 14, 2019) was an American football player, coach, and sports executive. He served as the head football coach at Utah State University (1959–1962), Stanford University (1963–1971), and San Jose State University (1993–1996), compiling a career college football record of 97–81–4. Ralston also coached the Denver Broncos of the National Football League (NFL) from 1972 to 1976, amassing a record of 34–33–3, and the Oakland Invaders of the United States Football League (USFL) in 1983 and part of the 1984 season, tallying a mark of 9–12. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1992.

==Early life, education, and playing career==
Born in Oakland, California, Ralston and his family moved to Norway, Michigan, when he was eight years old. On graduating from Norway High School in 1944, he went to the University of California, Berkeley and played linebacker there on two Rose Bowl teams before earning his physical education degree in 1951.

==Coaching career==
Ralston began his coaching career in 1952 at San Lorenzo High School in San Lorenzo, California, just south of Oakland. He subsequently was an assistant coach at Mt. Diablo High School in Concord, California. in 1953 and 1954. He then spent three seasons as an assistant coach at Cal from 1955 to 1958. Ralston was then named head coach at Utah State University in 1959. In four years there, he compiled a 31–11–1 record and won two Skyline Conference championships. Ralston moved to Stanford University in 1963 and, over nine seasons, built a mark of 55–36–3. In his last two seasons, 1970–1971, Ralston&#x27;s teams won two Pacific-8 titles and notched back-to-back Rose Bowl victories over Ohio State and Michigan, both of whom were undefeated coming into the Rose Bowl game. Under Ralston&#x27;s tutelage, Stanford quarterback Jim Plunkett won the Heisman Trophy in 1970.

In 1972, Ralston departed the San Francisco Bay Area again, this time for the Rocky Mountains and the Denver Broncos. The Broncos finished with a 5–9 record in 1972. In 1973, a year which included the &quot;Orange Monday&quot; game played in front of a prime-time national television audience in which the Broncos came from behind to earn a tie on Jim Turner&#x27;s 35-yard field goal, Ralston coached the team into first place with a 6–3–2 record. With their first winning season in franchise history under their belt and with the AFC West title on the line, the Broncos&#x27; season ended with a 21–17 loss to the Oakland Raiders. Ralston was the UPI&#x27;s choice as AFC Coach of the Year after Denver achieved its first-ever winning season at 7–5–2. In 1974, Ralston coached the Broncos to a 7–6–1 record for their second consecutive winning season. In 1975 the Broncos finished with a 6–8 record, but the following year the team improved and finished with a 9–5 record. The record was not, however, good enough to qualify the Broncos for the playoffs. Having lost his GM duties in December, Ralston then resigned as coach in late January 1977. In five seasons with the Broncos, Ralston guided the team to winning seasons three times and an overall record of 34–33–3; despite this, he never went to the playoffs during his Bronco (and NFL head coaching) tenure. Red Miller, hired to replace Ralston, wound up coaching the Broncos to the playoffs in his rookie season that saw them go all the way to Super Bowl XII.

After leaving the Broncos, Ralston held several assistant coaching jobs which included the Philadelphia Eagles, the San Francisco 49ers, the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League, and as a head coach in the USFL with the Oakland Invaders. Ralston also coached in Europe. He was the head coach of the Dutch Lions, the national football team of the Netherlands. With the Lions, Ralston won the bronze medal in the European Championships in Helsinki, Finland in 1991. After being inducted to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1992, Ralston came out of retirement in 1993 to be head coach at San Jose State University. After the 1996 season, Ralston resigned from the position to become special assistant to athletic director Tom Brennan. Ralston later became special assistant to the football team, where he remained until the 2013 season. He died on September 14, 2019, at the age of 92.

<doc id="1273305" wikidata="Q3083237" url="?curid=1273305" title="Morgan 4/4">
<text>The Morgan 4/4 is a British motor car which was produced by the Morgan Motor Company from 1936 to 2018. It was Morgan&#x27;s first car with four wheels, the name indicating that the model has four wheels and four cylinders (earlier Morgans had been three-wheelers, typically with V-twin engines). Early publicity and advertising material variously referred to the model as &quot;4/4&quot;, &quot;4-4&quot;, &quot;Four Four&quot;, and similar names, but from the outset the factory designation was always &quot;4/4&quot;. 

Apart from a break during World War II (and the period March 1951 to September 1955) the 4/4 was in continuous production from its debut until 2018. Engine capacity has increased from the 1,122 cc Coventry Climax engine in 1936 to a 1.8-litre Ford engine in 2004. From 2009 until the model was discontinued in 2018 a 1.6-litre Ford Sigma engine was fitted. Power has ranged from over the decades.

==4/4 Two-Seater==
The original open two-seater 4/4 was introduced in 1936 and became the most popular of the three body options available. 663 were built by 1939 and 249 more from 1946 to 1950, representing 53% of the overall production.

For the first years, the car had a 1,122cc Coventry Climax engine with , superseded from 1939 by a Standard Special 1,267cc overhead valve engine with . A four-speed Meadows gearbox was used until 1938, then a Moss gearbox.

===4/4 Four-Seater===
The four-seat version was introduced in 1937; 99 examples were built by 1939 and a further 140 from 1946 to 1950.

===4/4 Drophead Coupé===
The Drophead Coupé was introduced in 1938 with 58 built by 1939 and another 106 from 1946 to 1950. This has a better folding roof and permanent window frames, along with certain other creature comforts.
==4/4 Series II==

The Series II was introduced in 1955 with 386 built by October 1960. Although very similar in appearance to the model it replaced, it was virtually a new car with a chassis based on the one used in the Morgan Plus 4. The traditional independent front suspension using sliding pillars and coil springs was fitted with a rigid axle and semi-elliptic leaf springs at the rear. Disc wheels were fitted as standard items.

A side-valve 1,172 cc Ford 100E engine was used with a Ford three-speed gearbox. The engine produced . Hydraulic brakes with drums were fitted. It was also available in &#x27;Competition&#x27; form with Aquaplane head conversion, twin S.U. carburettors, and an improved gearshift linkage.

Inside there was a bench seat back and individual squabs covered in PVC, with leather as an option, and rubber floor covering. A heater was available as an option as was a rev counter and more surprisingly, direction indicators.

In 1956, The Motor magazine tested a Series II and recorded a top speed of , acceleration from 0- in 26.9 seconds and a fuel consumption of . The test car cost £713 including taxes.
==4/4 Series III==

The short-lived Series III was introduced in October 1960 and 58 were built by November 1961 when the Series IV arrived. The chassis was essentially the same as that used on the Series II but the track was increased by 2 inches (50mm). Hydraulic shock absorbers replaced the old Hartford friction type.

A overhead valve 997cc Ford Anglia 105E engine and Ford four-speed gearbox were used.
==4/4 Series IV==

The Series IV introduced October 1961 with 114 built by March 1963 had a 62 bhp, 1340 cc, Ford Classic 109E engine and Ford four-speed gearbox. Front disc brakes were now fitted.

&quot;The Motor&quot; magazine tested a Series IV in 1962 and found it had a top speed of , acceleration from 0- in 18.6 seconds and a touring fuel consumption of . The test car cost £729 including taxes on the home market.
==4/4 Series V==

The Series V was introduced in February 1963 with 639 built by March 1968.

A 65 bhp, 1498cc, Ford Cortina 116E engine and Ford four-speed gearbox were used.
==4/4 1600==

The car was further updated in 1968 to become the 1600 with two- and four-seat open bodies available. The 4/4 1600 also benefitted from minor improvements to the body, including door handles from the Land Rover.

===Ford Kent Crossflow engine===
The 4/4 1600 was introduced in February 1968 fitted with a variety of Ford 1599 cc Kent engines of type 2737E (70 bhp), type 2737GT (95.5 bhp) and type 2265E (95.5 bhp) from 1971 and a Ford four-speed gearbox. Detail improvements took place over the years, with fluted taillights introduced in 1971 and three (rather than two) windscreen wipers being installed from 1976 on. Safety improvements include dual circuit brakes, a padded dashboard, and a cable-operated clutch; these all appeared in 1971.

A total of 3513 were built by March 1982.

===Fiat Twin-Cam engine===
The Morgan 4/4 1600 TC was introduced in November 1981. Offered as a more powerful alternative to the Ford-engined variants, this was fitted with a , 1584 cc Fiat twin-cam engine and five-speed Fiat gearbox.

96 were built by November 1985. Morgan also went on to install the 2-litre version of the Fiat Twin Cam in the new Plus Four, from 1985.

===Ford CVH engine===
Introduced in March 1982 with a Ford 1597 cc CVH engine and Ford four-speed gearbox until 1984, after which it was replaced with the five-speed gearbox from the Ford Sierra. The 4/4 received the Plus Four&#x27;s wider wings beginning in 1985. From 1986 steering was changed from the original cam and peg to a Gemmer recirculating ball system.

1652 were built by November 1991.

===Ford CVH EFI engine===
From November 1991, a Ford 1597 cc CVH engine with electronic fuel injection was used. 187 were built by January 1993, when the 1800 version was introduced.
==4/4 1800==
===Ford Zetec engine===

Starting in April 1993, the Morgan 4/4 used a Ford 1,796cc 16-valve Zetec R engine.

====Runabout====

In 2003, Morgan launched a new entry-level model named the Runabout based on the 4/4. It was available in three standard colours only, with a standard no-option specification. The Runabout could be recognised by the reduced number of bonnet louvres.

===Ford Duratec engine===
From 2006 to 2009, the 4/4 sported a Ford Duratec 1,798 cc 16-valve all-alloy engine of Mazda origins. On these models the exhaust is on the right side. In January 2006, a &quot;70th Anniversary Special edition&quot; was presented, celebrating 70 years having passed since the introduction of the 4/4. This received black paint and special wheels, similar to those used on the original &quot;flat-rad&quot; Morgan. 142 were planned to be made. In spite of seventy years of production, the accumulated figure had not yet reached 10,000 in 2006.

==4/4 1.6 Litre (2009–2018)==
From 2009 to 2018, the Ford Sigma engine was used. This model displaces 1,595 cc and produces , enough for a top speed. The engine drives the rear wheels via a five-speed manual gearbox. Initially, a Ford gearbox was used, then from 2012 a Mazda unit was fitted.

<doc id="1273314" wikidata="Q985527" url="?curid=1273314" title="Tichit">
<text>Tichit, or Tichitt (, ), is a village at the foot of the Tagant Plateau in central southern Mauritania that is known for its vernacular architecture and proximity to the Dhar Tichitt archaeological sites. The main agriculture in Tichit is date farming, and the village is also home to a small museum.

Tichitt Airport has two unpaved runways designated in a barren area southeast of the village.

==History==
===Neolithic===
This region includes a long sandstone cliff formation that defines the northern limit of the Hodh depression, near the former lake of Aoukar.

The Neolithic sites of Dhar Tichitt were settled around 2000 BC by agropastoral communities known as the Tichitt culture. Archaeologists including P.J. Munson, Augustin F.C. Holl, and S. Amblard have found some evidence that millet was farmed there from the date of the communities&#x27; foundation. The settlements were generally situated on the cliffs and included stone buildings. They are the oldest surviving archaeological settlements in West Africa and the oldest stone-built settlements south of the Sahara. They are thought to have been built by the proto-Soninke people and were possibly the precursor of the Ghana Empire. Hundreds of rock art images have been discovered, depicting various animals and hunting scenes. The area was abandoned around 500 BC probably because of the onset of more arid conditions.

===Medieval===
The town of Tichitt was founded in the 12th century as a caravan stop on the Trans-Saharan trade route linking Oualâta to Chinguetti and eventually Sijilmasa. According to legend, seven towns have been built on top of each other at the site. 

The Azer dialect of Soninke was spoken in Tichit from the era of the Wagadou Empire until the early 20th century. The name &#x27;Tichit&#x27; may be derived from a term meaning &#x27;language of the blacks&#x27; in the Tuareg languages. 

===Modern===
The town was self-sufficient and boasted several thousand inhabitants in the early 20th century, but desertification and sand encroachment have led to the abandonment of many structures. In 1996, it was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In 1999, torrential rains caused flooding that damaged 80% of the town.

<text>In 1913 and 1914, Portugal issued postage stamps specifically for Tete Province, now part of Mozambique.

==Background==
The 1913 stamps were those of the Vasco da Gama issue of 1898, overprinted &quot;REPUBLICA / TETE&quot; and a new denomination in centavos. Each of the eight values from Macau, Portuguese Africa and Timor were overprinted, yielding a total of 24 stamps. In 1914, the omnibus Ceres issue of Portugal included 16 values for Tete, ranging from 1/4 centavo to one escudo. Subsequently, Tete reverted to using the stamps of Mozambique. Although these stamps are not rare, none costing the collector over about US$10, genuinely-used examples are harder to find, and command a premium of about 50-100% over unused.

<text>Ashanti is the debut studio album by American singer Ashanti, released on April 2, 2002, by Murder Inc. and Def Jam Recordings. It was recorded in New York City and Los Angeles between 2001 and 2002, during the period of time where Ashanti was writing for other artists. The album features guest vocals from Gotti, Ja Rule, and the late the Notorious B.I.G. Contributions to the album&#x27;s production came from a wide range of producers, including Irv Gotti, 7 Aurelius, Chink Santana, Jared Thomas and Reggie Wright.

&quot;Ashanti&quot; debuted at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart with first-week sales of 503,000 units, the biggest first-week sales for a debut female artist up to then. The album was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of three million copies on December 17, 2002. It earned Ashanti three Grammy Award nominations for Best New Artist, Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance and Best Contemporary R&amp;B Album, winning in the latter category. &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine ranked &quot;Ashanti&quot; at number 100 on its Top 200 Albums of the Decade. The album has sold six million copies worldwide.

The album was promoted by four singles. &quot;Foolish&quot; was released as the lead single from the project and peaked atop the record charts of 15 nations, including the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Two subsequent singles additionally became top ten charting hits: &quot;Happy&quot;, &quot;Baby&quot;. She also performed on several television shows and award ceremonies. Furthermore, Ashanti later opened for the North American leg for Mariah Carey&#x27;s worldwide concert tour &quot;Charmbracelet World Tour&quot;.

==Background==
When Ashanti was 14, she was discovered by P. Diddy&#x27;s Bad Boy Records. Initially, she went to Bad Boy Records and sang one of Mary J. Blige&#x27;s songs in front of P. Diddy and Biggie Smalls. After being impressed by her singing ability, Diddy later signed her to a development deal, but, due to a bad contract, Ashanti did not sign with Diddy. This ultimately led to a record deal with Jive Records in 1994. This relationship soured when Jive tried to make Ashanti into a pop singer. Ashanti subsequently involved herself in schoolwork, cheerleading, and running on her school&#x27;s track team. She was an honor student in English and belonged to the English club where she began writing poetry. She was also in the Drama club and performed in a few plays. She put college pursuits aside when Epic Records approached her with a contract in 1998. However, the label&#x27;s management changes quickly made Ashanti a low priority. She continued to perform at local New York clubs and began hanging out at the Murder Inc. recording studio, hoping for another big break.

Ashanti was first noticed by Irv Gotti because of her vocal skills. Ashanti initially asked him to produce a few demo songs for her to record so she could say she had some strong tracks by the big time producer but Gotti had a different idea. He asked her to pen hooks for his rap artists and to perform with them in duets. Ashanti provided the melodic response to their call. Ashanti was first featured as a background vocalist on rapper Big Pun&#x27;s song &quot;How We Roll&quot;. In the same year, Ashanti was featured on fellow labelmate Cadillac Tah&#x27;s singles &quot;Pov City Anthem&quot; and &quot;Just Like a Thug&quot;. She also appeared on the 2001 &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; soundtrack as a featured artist on rapper Vita&#x27;s 2001 hip hop remake of Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Justify My Love&quot; and on the solo track &quot;When a Man Does Wrong&quot;. She appeared as a background vocalist on &quot;I&#x27;m Real (Murder Remix)&quot;, a collaboration by labelmate Ja Rule and Jennifer Lopez (she also appeared in the music video for &quot;Aint It Funny (Murder Remix)&quot;, the second duet between Lopez and Rule, for which she wrote and also sang background vocals on), and was featured on Fat Joe&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s Luv?&quot; and Ja Rule&#x27;s &quot;Always on Time&quot;. &quot;What&#x27;s Luv?&quot; and &quot;Always on Time&quot; were released simultaneously and became two of the biggest hit songs of 2002. Ashanti became the first female artist to occupy the top two positions on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart simultaneously when &quot;Always on Time&quot; and &quot;What&#x27;s Luv?&quot; were at numbers one and two, respectively.

==Promotion==
The album&#x27;s lead single, titled &quot;Foolish&quot; was released on February 11, 2002. The song became Ashanti&#x27;s biggest solo successes to date, spending ten consecutive weeks on top of the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles &amp; Tracks charts. It was eventually first ranked on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles 2002 year-end charts for eleven straight weeks (Tying with Nelly&#x27;s single &quot;Dilemma&quot;, but not for eleven straights weeks). It was a breakthrough hit internationally entering the top five in the United Kingdom, the top ten in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Germany and Japan, and the top twenty in Switzerland and the Netherlands. &quot;Foolish&quot; was later officially remixed, titled &quot;Unfoolish&quot;, with guest appearances from a decease rapper The Notorious B.I.G., was released only just for radio ads.

The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Happy&quot; was released on June 17, 2002. The song peaked at number 8 on US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and number 6 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs charts. The single became Ashanti&#x27;s second top ten hit as a solo artist. It was a moderate success internationally, reaching the top ten in the Netherlands, the top twenty in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and the top forty in Australia, Ireland, Switzerland and France. The album&#x27;s third single, &quot;Baby&quot; was released on September 9, 2002. The song peaked at number 15 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and number 7 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs charts. The single became Ashanti&#x27;s third top-twenty hit as a solo artist in her career. &quot;Dreams&quot; was released as a promotional single, with a live-performance music video with clips from Ashanti&#x27;s career.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Ashanti&quot; earned generally mixed reviews from music critics. AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave it a three-out-of-five-star rating and praised the &quot;modern, post-hip-hop soul&quot; sound, stating the album has &quot;fairly fresh beats and lightly insistent hooks, and is just naughty enough&quot;. However, he felt it lacked distinctive material: &quot;It&#x27;s not bad by any means, and it has its moments, but at 17 tracks, including skits, it all becomes a blur. A pleasing blur, one that shows promise, but a blur all the same.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; commended the album&#x27;s &quot;coy hooks&quot; and &quot;jagged-edged rappers&quot;, continuing to say &quot;her voice is supple and pretty but rarely rises above a whisper, making it a background instrument even when it&#x27;s Ashanti&#x27;s turn to shine&quot;. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; had a mixed view of the album, writing &quot;Ashanti&#x27;s breathy, cooing vocals are well suited to the mellow mood of this collection&quot;, however was unimpressed because it was not &quot;substantial&quot;.

In another mixed review, &quot;Slant&quot; critic Sal Cinqueman found that, &quot;the songs are infectious and fine-tuned and most of the album is underscored with bristling live instrumentation [...] But tracks like the flute-infused &quot;Happy&quot; are admittedly — and perhaps too obviously — influenced by other R&amp;B divas like Mary J. Blige and rarely give way to anything fresh or new. Ultimately, &quot;Ashanti&quot; fails to carve a unique niche for the budding singer.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Kris Ex complimented the album&#x27;s overall production with its &quot;bass-heavy, slow-burning R&amp;B grooves that sound like everything else on R&amp;B radio&quot; and noted that Ashanti&#x27;s &quot;voice is the perfect radio-ready R&amp;B; instrument: strong enough to ride over street-savvy beats but unassuming enough to be open to interpretation; better than Britney but less distinctive than Mary J. Blige.&quot; Alluding to her previous collaborations, &quot;People&quot; magazine wrote that &quot;it’s one thing to sing a hook on someone else’s record, quite another to carry your own album, as Ashanti fails to do on this desultory debut [...] Ashanti, with her sweet but slight soprano, doesn’t have the grit and power of [other] divas. It doesn’t help that, despite sporadic sampling [...] lack memorable melodies.&quot;

==Legacy==
Her debut album earned Ashanti three Grammy nominations for Best New Artist, Best Contemporary R&amp;B Album and Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance at the 45th Annual Grammy Awards. The same year, she also received two additional Grammy nominations for other projects, both in the category of Best Rap/Sung Collaboration. Ashanti took home a record 8 Billboard Music Awards, winning all the categories she was nominated for.

&quot;Billboard&quot; magazine ranked &quot;Ashanti&quot; at number 100 on magazine&#x27;s Top 200 Albums of the Decade. In April 2002, &quot;Ashanti&quot; sold 503,000 copies in its first week of release in the United States, becoming a record-breaking feat. It was the highest first week sales for a female artist&#x27;s debut ever. The album stayed atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for three consecutive weeks. In the same week, she became the first female performer to simultaneously hold the top two places on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart with &quot;Foolish&quot; and &quot;What&#x27;s Luv&quot; (with Fat Joe).

She broke records again by having three top ten songs (&quot;Foolish&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s Luv&quot;, and &quot;Always on Time&quot; (with Ja Rule)) on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 charts in the same week. Only The Beatles have achieved this up to that point. In 2009, Billboard.com reported that Ashanti has had the most top 10 songs (16 to date) on the R&amp;B/Hip-hop charts by a female for that respective decade. The album&#x27;s lead single was named the 19th most successful song of the 2000s on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Songs of the Decade. As of June 2012, it is the third best selling physical single of the 21st century.

<doc id="1273337" wikidata="Q897003" url="?curid=1273337" title="Haroun and the Sea of Stories">
<text>Haroun and the Sea of Stories is a 1990 children&#x27;s novel by Salman Rushdie. It is Rushdie&#x27;s fifth major publication and followed &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot; (1988). It is a phantasmagorical story that begins in a city so miserable and ruinous that it has forgotten its name.

&quot;Haroun and the Sea of Stories&quot; is an allegory for problems existing in society at the time of its publication, especially in the Indian subcontinent. It presents these problems from the perspective of the young protagonist, Haroun. Salman Rushdie dedicated this book to his son, from whom he was separated for some time. Many elements of the story deal with the problems of censorship, an issue particularly pertinent to Rushdie because of the fatwa against him issued in 1989 by Ayatollah Khomeini. The book is highly allusive and contains puns in multiple languages. Many of the major characters&#x27; names allude to some aspect of speech or silence.

It is available as an audiobook read by Rushdie himself.

==Plot summary==
At the beginning of the story, protagonist Haroun Khalifa lives with his father Rashid, a famous storyteller and doctor, and his mother Soraya, until the latter is seduced by their neighbour &quot;Mr. Sengupta&quot; to leave home. Rashid is hired to speak on behalf of local politicians but fails his initial assignment. Rashid and Haroun are taken to the &quot;Valley of K&quot; by courier &quot;Mr. Butt,&quot; to speak for &quot;Snooty Buttoo,&quot; another politician. Attempting to sleep aboard Buttoo&#x27;s yacht, Haroun discovers &quot;Iff the Water Genie,&quot; assigned to detach Rashid&#x27;s imagination, and demands to speak with Iff&#x27;s supervisor, the Walrus, to argue against this decision. They are then carried to the eponymous &quot;Sea of Stories&quot; by an artificial intelligence in the form of a hoopoe, nicknamed &quot;Butt&quot; after the courier. In the Sea of Stories, Haroun learns the Sea is endangered by antagonist &quot;Khattam-Shud,&quot; who represents the end.

In the Kingdom of Gup, King Chattergy, Prince Bolo, General Kitab, and the Walrus announce their plans for war against the neighbouring kingdom of Chup, to recapture Bolo&#x27;s betrothed Princess Batcheat and to stop the pollution of the Sea of Stories. Rashid joins them here, having witnessed Batcheat&#x27;s kidnapping. Thereafter, Haroun and his companions join the Guppee army of &quot;Pages&quot; toward Chup, where they befriend Mudra, Khattam-Shud&#x27;s former second-in-command.

Haroun, Iff, Butt the Hoopoe, and Mali, the stories&#x27; gardener, investigate the Sea&#x27;s &quot;Old Zone&quot; and are captured by Khattam-Shud&#x27;s animated shadow, who plans to plug the Story Source at the bottom of the Sea. Before he can do so, Mali destroys the machines used by Khattam-Shud to poison the Sea, and Haroun restores the Sea&#x27;s long-annulled alternation between night and day, thus destroying the antagonist&#x27;s shadow and those assisting him, and diverting the giant &quot;Plug&quot; meant to seal the Source. In Chup, the Guppee army destroys the Chupwalas&#x27; army and releases Princess Batcheat; whereupon Khattam-Shud himself is crushed beneath a collapsing statue commissioned by himself. Thereafter the Walrus promises Haroun a happy ending of his own story. On return to the human world, Rashid reveals Haroun&#x27;s adventures to local citizens, who expel Snooty Buttoo.

When Rashid and Haroun return home, the people of their city are loosened from the shackles of their misery and remember the name of their home, Kahani. Soraya returns to her son and husband.

The novel concludes with an appendix explaining the meaning of each major character&#x27;s name.

==Places==
* A work of magic realism, the story begins and takes place partly in &quot;a sad city&quot; which is located beside &quot;a mournful sea full of glumfish,&quot; which were so miserable to eat that they made people &quot;belch with melancholy.&quot; This city is thickly populated by people, of whom only the lead character Haroun and his parents are ever happy, while in the north of the city are factories wherein sadness is allegedly manufactured and exported. The factories produce air pollution that is only relieved during rain, which also heralds the arrival of pomfret into the nearby waters. 
* Most of the Earthly locations present in the book are located in the fictional nation of Alifbay, which is a combination of first two letters of the Arabic script based Urdu alphabet, Alif and Bay, and therefore contains many places named after letters, such as the &quot;Valley of K&quot; and the &quot;Tunnel of I (which was also known as J).&quot;
* In the center of the Valley of K is the Dull Lake, which is said in the novel&#x27;s appendix to be named after the Dal Lake in Kashmir. This implies that Kashmir is the place on which K is based. The Dull Lake itself is the location of the Moody Land, a landscape whose weather changes to reflect the emotions of the people currently present in it.
* The larger part of the plot occurs on a fictional moon of Earth, named Kahani, whose orbit is controlled by a &quot;Process Too Complicated To Explain&quot; also referred to in the book as the &quot;P2C2E.&quot; These processes enable it to fly over every single point on Earth like a satellite. Kahani consists of a massive ocean, which is composed of an infinite number of stories, each story taking the form of a current or stream of a unique colour. The colours encompass the whole visible spectrum and extend beyond into spectra that are not known to exist. The name &quot;Kahani&quot; itself means &quot;Story&quot; in Urdu and Hindi, and is ultimately revealed to be the name of the sad city; a revelation that removes the sadness from the city&#x27;s people.
* The Moon Kahani is, throughout most of the plot, divided into two sections equal in size, one of which is kept in perpetual daylight and the other in perpetual darkness. The two are separated by a narrow strip of twilight, which is marked by a forcefield named Chattergy&#x27;s Wall. The daylight side is called Gup, a Hindi and Urdu word (meaning &quot;gossip,&quot; &quot;nonsense,&quot; or &quot;fib&quot; in English) and the night-darkened side is called Chup (meaning &quot;quiet&quot;). Inhabitants of Gup value speech and are called &quot;Guppees,&quot; meaning &quot;talkative people,&quot; while inhabitants of Chup are stated to have historically valued silence and are called &quot;Chupwalas,&quot; meaning &quot;quiet fellows.&quot; At the South Pole of Kahani is a spring known as the Source of Stories, from which originated all stories ever communicated. The prevention of this spring&#x27;s blockage, therefore, forms the climax of the novel&#x27;s plot. Much of the plot on the Moon Kahani can be seen as depicting the contrast between a liberal society and dictatorship.

==Characters==

* Haroun: The main character/central consciousness of the story. A young, curious, courageous, outspoken child. He struggles throughout most of the story with a form of attention-deficit disorder caused by his mother running away with Mr. Sengupta at exactly eleven o&#x27;clock, and under its influence, he is unable to concentrate for a longer period of time. But he eventually overcomes his disorder at the climax, never to suffer from it again. He and his father are both named after the &quot;legendary Caliph of Baghdad, Haroun al-Rashid, who features in many &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; tales. Their surname Khalifa actually means Caliph.&quot;
* Rashid: Haroun&#x27;s father, known as the Shah of Blah and the Ocean of Notions for his ability to devise stories impromptu, Rashid is a professional storyteller sometimes hired by corrupt politicians to persuade constituents in their favor. His attachment to his wife and to his practice of storytelling is probably his greatest psychological weaknesses; when either of them is lost, he becomes depressed and tends to lose the other. In the story, to recover the latter, he travels to Kahani by means known as &quot;Rapture,&quot; through which he is able to travel inside his dreams and wake up in the world, his dream has created. 
* Soraya: Haroun&#x27;s mother and Rashid&#x27;s wife, who is tired of his imagination and leaves him for the dull and dreary Mr. Sengupta. In the end, she returns to Rashid and revives her affection for her husband and son. Upon her return, the depression overwhelming Rashid and the syndrome manifested by Haroun do not reappear. 
* Mr. Sengupta: Haroun&#x27;s neighbour, who elopes with Soraya. As a rule, Mr. Sengupta despises imagination and stories, which sets the stage for his later appearance on Kahani as antagonist Khattam-Shud. Khattam-Shud&#x27;s. His name is a legitimate Bengali surname.
* Miss Oneeta: Mr. Sengupta&#x27;s obese, talkative, self-important, overwhelmingly emotional, generous wife, disappointed in her husband after he has eloped with Soraya. In her dismay, she disowns him and her married name. It is she who reveals that Soraya has deserted her family and that her act has given Haroun his disorder, and also announces her return.
* Mr. Butt: The mail courier, a reckless driver who, when requested to provide transport for Haroun and Rashid (who is expected to speak at an election of public officers), ignores all other demands to take them to their destination before dusk. 
* Snooty Buttoo: A corrupt politician who hires Rashid to convince constituents that he (Buttoo) should be re-elected. Buttoo is a class-conscious, pompous, arrogant, self-assured person whose chief hold over his constituents is that he has been re-elected before. To persuade Rashid to sympathize with him, he offers both Rashid and Haroun a stay on a luxurious houseboat called &quot;The Arabian Nights Plus One.&quot; He is ultimately driven from his district by popular demand.
* Butt the Hoopoe: A mechanical Hoopoe who becomes Haroun&#x27;s steed in Kahani, capable of almost all known mental feats, including telepathy (the latter producing a recurrent joke that he &quot;spoke without moving [his] beak&quot;). He is also capable of flying at impossible speeds, between Earth and Kahani. 
* Iff: A &quot;water genie&quot; from Kahani who accompanies Haroun in Kahani. Iff&#x27;s task is to control Rashid&#x27;s imagination, in the form of waters transmitted to Rashid via an invisible faucet. Iff himself is a benevolent character having a blue moustache and beard; an effusive, somewhat cantankerous personality; and a habit of speaking in lists of synonyms.
* Prince Bolo: A possible parody of the archetypal awe-inspiring hero or Prince Charming, Bolo is a reckless, slightly stupid, melodramatic figure, nominally the leader of the charge to rescue Princess Batcheat from Chup, but holding little authority; prone to becoming excited at the least provocation; and obsessed with rescuing Batcheat, so that all other things appear to him of little significance. 
* Princess Batcheat: A damsel in distress. Batcheat is the daughter of King Chattergy, ruler of Gup, and the fiancée of Prince Bolo. She is somewhat foolish; sentimental; reckless; and completely infatuated with Bolo, who is the only person to think her beautiful. Her name is pronounced &quot;Baat-cheat,&quot; which is translated as &quot;conversation.&quot; When Princess Batcheat is captured by Chupwalas during an excursion to the border between Gup and Chup, they plot to sew her mouth shut and rename her Khamosh, meaning &quot;silent,&quot; but they never carry this out.
* General Kitab: Literally &quot;General Book,&quot; General Kitab is the commander of the Guppee Army, called the &quot;Library.&quot; It consists of a multitude of Pages. The General participates in every debate regarding the worth of the cause on which the army has embarked, and frequently forms such debates on purpose to resolve all conflict of interest or opinion. The whole army, therefore, takes part in every campaign of Rogerian argument, whose sole aim is to produce conciliation and eventual unity among the Pages. Because Guppee laws permit unlimited freedom of speech, these debates are unrestrained to an extent that would (as Haroun remarks) be considered insubordination in the reader&#x27;s world. 
* King Chattergy: Princess Batcheat&#x27;s father and Prince Bolo&#x27;s father-in-law, who forms the nominal head of Gup&#x27;s government but has little real power. He is given very little role in most of the story. 
* Blabbermouth: A female Page of the Library of Gup. Blabbermouth is a talkative, ill-tempered, stubborn, unscrupulous, quarrelsome and courageous girl who despises Princess Batcheat, disguises herself as a boy (due to lack of equal rights for girls), and is skilled at the art of juggling. Blabbermouth joins the army of Gup to march on Chup. She saves many lives by impeding a bomb attack attempted by Khattam-Shud&#x27;s ambassador. Thereupon she is exposed as a girl and expelled from the army by Bolo. She then becomes an aide to Mudra, an ally of the Guppees, with whom she is implied to be infatuated.
* Mudra: Second-in-command to Khattam-Shud, who becomes disgruntled with his master&#x27;s policies and defects to the Guppee side. His shadow, like the shadows of each and every person in Chup, can behave independently of himself and is, therefore, his sidekick. Mudra himself is an able warrior skilled in the art of hand-to-hand combat. Mudra is nearly mute, being able only to communicate his own name and that he &quot;speaks&quot; by Abhinaya, the sign language used in classical Indian dance. His own name is said in the appendix to be the generic term for all signs used in this language. After the climax, Mudra becomes President of Chup.
* Khattam-Shud: The villain of the story, whose name means &quot;completely finished.&quot; As a character, he is the &quot;Prince of Silence and the Foe of Speech&quot; feared by most Guppees. He is the ruthless ruler of Chup and in some sense the Kahanian counterpart of Mr. Sengupta. Khattam-Shud is the founder of a religion whose supreme commandment is abstinence from speech. In Chup City, schools, law-courts, and theaters had to close. Khattam-Shud tries to poison the Sea so that all stories go wrong and come to a bad end.
* The Eggheads: Here, the technicians of Kahani: white-coated, completely bald, enthusiastic, cheerful, and intelligent. The Eggheads of Gup City are said to be the inventors of all &quot;Processes Too Complicated To Explain,&quot; by which impossible feats such as Kahani&#x27;s bizarre orbit, the creation of artificial happy endings for stories, and the transmission of &quot;story water&quot; to Earthly storytellers are easily accomplished. They are in awe of their superintendent, the Walrus, for his possession of a moustache.
* Walrus: The superintendent of the Eggheads, distinguished from them by his possession of a small moustache that gives him his name.
* Plentimaw Fish: Angelfish the size of giant sharks. The name is derived from their multiplicity of mouths, through which they constantly ingest the stories conveyed by the waters. Inside their bodies, the stories combine to form new stories. 
* Mali: A &quot;Floating Gardener&quot; composed of interwoven flowering vines and water plants that behave as a single organism. He is one of many, whose task is to prevent stories from becoming irretrievably convoluted and to cut away weeds on the Ocean&#x27;s surface. Floating Gardeners are divided into a hierarchy of classes, of which Mali belongs to the First Class, presumably the highest. Mali, and presumably other Floating Gardeners, is virtually invulnerable, being able to withstand any and all attacks made against him by the Chupwalas. 

==Allusions/references to other works==

* &quot;Sea of the Rivers of Story&quot; is the English equivalent of &quot;Kathāsaritsāgara&quot;, the title of an 11th-century collection of Indian legends.
* Elements of the story are indicated to have been drawn from Baum&#x27;s &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, and Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, as well as having been compared to the popular children&#x27;s novel &quot;The Phantom Tollbooth.&quot;
* Another obvious reference is to the stories of &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;. Haroun, the son of Rashid Khalifa refers to Harun al-Rashid, a caliph who ruled from 786 to 809 and who features frequently in Thousand and One Nights stories.
* &quot;Iff the Water Genie&quot; is a reference to the genie in &quot;Aladdin&#x27;s Magic Lamp.&quot; Haroun steals Iff&#x27;s magic wrench, and as a result, Iff is forced to do Haroun&#x27;s bidding, just as the genie did when Aladdin came into possession of the magic lamp.
* The Walrus plays off of The Beatles song &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; and Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;The Walrus and the Carpenter.&quot;
* When the character Mudra is first encountered, the noises he emits are the gurgling sound &quot;Gogogol&quot; and the coughing noise &quot;Kafkafka,&quot; as references to writers Nikolai Gogol and Franz Kafka, whose names they are distorting. Rushdie makes another reference to Kafka when Iff describes the Plentimaw Fish in the sea, who swallow stories, as hungry artists.
* A reference is made to the folktale &quot;Rapunzel&quot; in the book&#x27;s fourth chapter.
* Haroun encounters a warrior who is fighting his own shadow. This is possibly a reference to J. M. Barrie&#x27;s &quot;Peter Pan&quot;.
* &quot;Goopy&quot; and &quot;Bagha,&quot; the names of the Plentimaws, allude to the characters Goopy and Bagha created by Bengali author Upendrakishore Ray Chowdhury. His grandson, the Academy Award-winning director Satyajit Ray, directed two films with Goopy and Bagha as protagonists.

==Adaptations==
*A play based on the book was adapted for the stage by Tim Supple and David Tushingham. It had its stage premiere in 1998 at the Royal National Theatre in London.
*An opera, &quot;Haroun and the Sea of Stories&quot;, by Charles Wuorinen with libretto by James Fenton, written in 2001, was premiered at the New York City Opera in Fall 2004.

<text>Ouadane or Wādān () is a small town in the desert region of central Mauritania, situated on the southern edge of the Adrar Plateau, 93 km northeast of Chinguetti. The town was a staging post in the trans-Saharan trade and for caravans transporting slabs of salt from the mines at Idjil.

The old town, a World Heritage Site, though in ruins, is still substantially intact, while a small modern settlement lies outside its gate.

Ouadane is the closest town to the Richat Structure, a massive circular landmark visible from space.

The whole Ouadane commune has a total size of 118,210 km², mostly consisting of desert. The main town is located in the south-west of the commune. 

==History==
The early history of Ouadane is uncertain but it is possible that the town prospered from the trans-Saharan gold trade. In the middle of the 11th century, the Arabic geographer al-Bakri described a trans-Saharan route that ran between Tamdoult near Akka in Morocco to Aoudaghost on the southern edge of the Sahara. This route was used for the transport of gold during the time of the Ghana Empire. In his account al-Bakri mentioned a series of place names but these have not been identified and historians have suggested several possible routes. In 1961 the French historian Raymond Mauny proposed a route that passed through Ouadane but Suzanne Daveau later argued in favour of a more direct route that crossed the Adrar escarpment to the east of the town. The volume of caravan traffic would have declined from the beginning of the 13th century when the oasis town of Oualata located 360 km to the east replaced Aoudaghost as the southern terminus of the trade route.

The first written reference to the town is in Portuguese by Ca&#x27; de Mosto in middle of the 15th century in a muddled account that confused the salt mines of Idjil with those of Taghaza. At about the same date Gomes Eanes de Zurara described Ouadane as the most important town of the Adrar region and the only one with a surrounding wall. Fifty years later Valentim Fernandes wrote a detailed account of the trade in slabs of salt from the Idjil mines and role of Ouadane as an entrepôt. He described Ouadane as a &#x27;town&#x27; with a population of 400 inhabitants. By contrast Duarte Pacheco Pereira in his &quot;Esmeraldo de situ orbis&quot; (written in 1505-1508) described the town as having approximately &quot;300 hearths&quot; which would suggest between 1,500 and 1,800 people. The Idjil sebkha lies roughly 240 km northwest of Ouadane, to the west of the town of Fderîck. The date when salt was first extracted from the sebkha is unknown. It is usually assumed that exploitation of the Idjil mines began after the mid 11th century as al-Bakri did not mention them. Instead he described a salt mine at a place that he called &#x27;Tatantal&#x27;. Historians have usually assumed this corresponds to Tegahza but his description could possibly also apply to the mines at Idjil.

According to Pereira, in 1487 the Portuguese built an entrepôt in Ouadane in an attempt to gain access to the trans-Saharan gold, salt and slave trade. The entrepôt was probably short lived and is not mentioned in the detailed description provided by Fernandes.

In the 16th century the Moroccans made various attempts to take control of the trans-Saharan trade in salt and especially that in gold from the Sudan. They organised military expeditions to occupy Ouadane in 1543-44 and again in 1584. Then in 1585 they occupied Taghaza and finally in 1591 their victory in the battle of Battle of Tondibi led to the collapse of the Songhay Empire.

Tegherbeyat, the upper ruined section of the town, is almost certainly the oldest. It would have originally contained a mosque but nothing has survived. The ruins of the lower section of the town include a mosque that was probably built in the 15th century when the town expanded. Some of the horseshoe arches are still standing and some walls still have the remains of clay plaster, suggesting that the mosque was abandoned sometime in the 19th century. 
The mosque measured 24 m north–south at its eastern end and 17 m north–south at its western end where the minaret would have stood. From east to west it would have measured 15 m. The terrace was supported by five rows of horseshoe arches. At the eastern end are the remains of an external mirhab and a courtyard measuring 13 by 12 meters that would have been used in hot weather.
