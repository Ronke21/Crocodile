<text>College is a subway station on Line 1 Yonge–University in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located at Yonge Street and College Street/Carlton Street.

==History==
College station opened in 1954 as part of the original stretch of the Yonge line from to stations. The address originally given to the station was 448 Yonge Street, which is still used on TTC system maps, but the TTC official website uses 3 Carlton Street.

==Station description==

The station lies under Yonge Street south from College and Carlton streets. The entrances on the northeast and southeast corners of the intersection are stairwells directly from the sidewalk. At the southwest corner the entrance is through the former Eaton&#x27;s store at College Park, with escalators connecting from the street and additional stairs to the station. These three entrances join to the concourse, below the street at the north end of the station, where the collector&#x27;s booth, turnstiles and a Gateway Newstands are located. Below this, on the lowest level, are the two side platforms which can be reached by escalators and stairs. There are no elevators in this station, which means it is not accessible for persons with physical disabilities.

==Station access upgrades==
In 2022, the TTC began constructing a second entrance at College station. The second entrance will be south of the main entrance, and riders will be able to access it from the basement level of the College Park building. The second entrance will have a concourse level under Yonge Street with Presto fare gates and an elevator and a staircase to each of the north- and southbound platforms. These elevators will connect to the street-level concourse. Riders will be able to use the College Park elevators from street level and a passage to reach the new concourse where riders will use either a short staircase or a ramp to enter the concourse. Construction is expected to be completed by 2026.
==Architecture and art==

The station features &quot;Hockey Knights in Canada&quot;, a pair of murals that are named after &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;; one depicting the Toronto Maple Leafs on the southbound side and facing the Montreal Canadiens on the northbound side, depicting the decades-old rivalry between the two clubs. They were created by Charles Pachter in 1984, when the Toronto Maple Leafs still played at nearby Maple Leaf Gardens.

Before proceeding with the design, the TTC sought to obtain permission from both clubs. The Canadiens agreed as did Maple Leaf general manager Gerry McNamara. However, when Maple Leafs owner Harold Ballard learned of the plan to feature both teams, he refused permission to use the Leafs insignia unless plans for the Canadiens mural were scrapped. The TTC thus moved to remove the logos from the murals, until chairman Julian Porter, himself a lawyer knowledgeable on copyright issues, intervened and decided to take Ballard to court, believing that the artistic works could make free use of the logo even without Ballard&#x27;s permission. TTC commissioner June Rowlands also intervened insisting that all the players wear helmets, to set an example of safety for the city&#x27;s youth.

== Subway infrastructure in the vicinity ==
North of the station, the tunnel turns off-street, paralleling Yonge Street to the east. South of the station, the subway continues under Yonge Street to Dundas station.

In early 2011, the TTC began work to re-install a double crossover south of the station. The crossover will allow trains to turn back at the station, allowing for more flexibility during emergencies. The crossover had existed from the day the subway opened until the mid-1980s when it was removed due to financial, maintenance and safety concerns and because it was not regularly used. The original crossover was not powered or signaled, meaning that supervisory personnel had to be on scene to manually operate the switches, and ensure safe train passage. On November 21, 2020, automatic train control was activated at College station, allowing the crossover to be remotely operated for train turnbacks.

== Nearby landmarks ==
Nearby landmarks include the College Park mall, the College Park courts, the Residences of College Park, the Toronto Police Headquarters, and Maple Leaf Gardens. Some Toronto Metropolitan University students use this station though the campus is situated closer to the next station, Dundas.

== Surface connections ==

A transfer is required to connect between the subway system and these surface routes:

<text>Wellesley is a subway station on Line 1 Yonge–University in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located on Wellesley Street East, east of Yonge Street.

==History==
Wellesley station opened in 1954 as part of the original stretch of the Yonge line from to stations, and was listed as a heritage property by the City of Toronto in 1984. The address given for this listing of 16 Wellesley Street East/15 Dundonald Street, which differs from the TTC address, more accurately describes the location of the station structure which runs between those streets, to the rear of the properties fronting on the east side of Yonge Street.

On February 6, 2006, the only baby to be born on the subway, Mary Kim of Scarborough, was delivered on the Wellesley platform. Her mother Sun Hee Paik took the subway with her family to St. Michael&#x27;s Hospital from their Scarborough home. She did not make it to the downtown hospital, going into labour on the train. Her husband delivered the baby after they disembarked at Wellesley and Toronto EMS arrived later to help finish the birth and send the mother and child to St. Michael&#x27;s. TTC officials later promised to provide Mary with lifetime transit access.

Construction began in early 2018 to make the station fully accessible, including the addition of two elevators and accessible fare gates. On July 22, 2020, the station became accessible with the completion of the elevator construction. As part of the enhancements for accessibility, provision was made for the future installation of an artwork on the curved wall opposite the two new elevators.

=== Second exit ===
Wellesley was the last downtown TTC subway station with only one street entrance. Plans for a second exit to be located on Wellesley street were tendered in 2011. Construction work for the portion internal to the station began in the fourth quarter of 2014. The projected completion date was initially the second quarter of 2017 but the work was not completed for years after. The mezzanine level leads to two separate exits on Dundonald Street, at 17 Dundonald and at the residential entrance of 597-599 Yonge Street. The TTC claimed that it has completed all work within its control by mid-2017, and that the opening had been delayed by the construction of two condominium buildings. However, despite residents having moved into 17 Dundonald in the second quarter of 2018, the station entrance in the building was not opened until July 27, 2020. Residents of 599 Yonge Street began to take residency in late 2022. As of January 2025, the entrance in that building remains closed.

==Station description==
This station is located on the north side of Wellesley Street East east of Yonge Street. It is built on two levels, with the main Wellesley Street entrance and bus platform at street level and the subway platforms located on the lower level. There are elevators from street level to the two platforms. A Gateway Newstands can be found in the station. There is a second automatic entrance on Dundonald Street.

==Subway infrastructure in the vicinity==

North of the station the tunnel was constructed by cut and cover into Bloor station, where it crosses over Yonge station on Line 2 Bloor–Danforth. South of the station, the tunnel is mostly of a similar construction towards College station. The strip of land occupied by this section of the subway is distinguished by being used mainly for public parks or parking lots.

<text>Inferno (alias Sandy Anderson) is a superheroine in the DC Comics universe. The character is a former ally of the Legion of Super-Heroes in the future, but currently resides in the present day.

==Fictional character biography==
The name &quot;Sandy Anderson&quot; first appeared when several Legionnaires, including Inferno, were placed in an illusionary world representing rural 1950s America where, among other things, all their names were anglicized to names that might exist then, making it unclear whether that is her name or whether it is just a close approximation. The &quot;Inferno&quot; miniseries from 1997-1998 has her refer to Sandy as her name and shows a flashback where she is called Ms. Anderson, establishing this as her actual name. Her parents are John and Maja Anderson.

As depicted in the post-&quot;Zero Hour&quot; reimagining of the LSH storyline, Inferno is depicted as a rather bloodthirsty character who initially works for a group called the Workforce. She works alongside Live Wire after he resigns from the Legion. As a member of the Workforce, she is shown killing opponents by immolating them, much to the chagrin of Legion members.

She was part of the Legion group and was sent to the 20th century by the Emerald Eye. She assists with battling the Sun-Eater, as detailed in &quot;The Final Night&quot;. Later, not feeling any affiliation to the Legion, she elected to remain there when the others returned to the 30th century.

There, she spent some time affiliated with a strange shopping mall and several homeless teenagers. During this time, she had to deal with the problem of unwittingly moving locations while asleep. She was later recruited to the invading force sent to Zandia to avenge the murder of the parents of Empress. The force was made up of many young superheroes such as Damage, the Wonder Twins, and Young Justice.

Inferno has not appeared in the original Legion continuity, although she may have been based on a character named Beauty Blaze who was created for the Legion of Super-Villains, but ultimately unused.

In Mark Waid&#x27;s rebooted Legion, Inferno is a member of a group called the Wanderers, a &quot;black ops&quot; group of adult heroes who opposed the Legion because they will not take orders. The rebooted Inferno comes from Mercury and has green skin.

<doc id="1304298" wikidata="Q5557665" url="?curid=1304298" title="G. R. Santosh">
<text>Ghulam Rasool Santosh (1929 – March 10, 1997), also known as G. R. Santosh, was a Kashmiri painter and poet. He was best known for his themes inspired by Kashmir Shaivism. In 1979, he became the recipient of Sahitya Akademi Award for his poem titled &quot;Be Soakh Rooh&quot;.

==Early life==
He was born Ghulam Rasool in a Kashmiri Muslim family of modest means in the &quot;Chinkral Mohalla&quot; habba kadal neighborhood of old Srinagar. He dropped out of school after his father&#x27;s death and took up odd jobs like writing, painting signboards, weaving silk and whitewashing walls. In 1954 he won a scholarship to study fine arts under a celebrated Indian painter, N. S. Bendre in the faculty of Arts, at Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda, in the state of Baroda, in the state of Gujarat, in western India.

Around the same time, he did what was considered unusual and unacceptable in conservative Kashmiri society - he married his childhood sweetheart, Santosh, who was a Kashmiri Pandit, and also assumed her name.

==Career==
In the early 1960s, Santosh studied Tantric (mystical) art and Kashmir Shaivism. In 1964 he adopted this style to create some of the best examples of modern Tantric paintings. His paintings are known for the vibrancy of colors, neat lines, spiritual energy and sensuousness. His paintings have been exhibited in notable international shows including the Tenth São Paulo Art Biennial, 1969 and the &#x27;Neo-Tantra: Contemporary
Indian Art Inspired by Tradition&#x27; exhibition at University of California, Los Angeles, 1985.

Santosh also wrote plays, poetry and essays in Kashmiri. He was also an authority on Kashmiri Shaivism, and was one of the very few people who could read and write the ancient, and almost-extinct, Kashmiri script called Sharda.

==Death==
He died on March 10, 1997, in New Delhi, India. He was survived by his wife, a son and a daughter.

<doc id="1304300" wikidata="Q421717" url="?curid=1304300" title="Polyurea">
<text>Polyurea is a type of elastomer that is derived from the reaction product of an isocyanate component and an amine component. The isocyanate can be aromatic or aliphatic in nature. It can be monomer, polymer, or any variant reaction of isocyanates, quasi-prepolymer or a prepolymer. The prepolymer, or quasi-prepolymer, can be made of an amine-terminated polymer resin, or a hydroxyl-terminated polymer resin.

The resin blend may be made up of amine-terminated polymer resins, and/or amine-terminated chain extenders. The amine-terminated polymer resins do not have any intentional hydroxyl moieties. Any hydroxyls are the result of incomplete conversion to the amine-terminated polymer resins. The resin blend may also contain additives or non-primary components. These additives may contain hydroxyls, such as pre-dispersed pigments in a polyol carrier. Normally, the resin blend does not contain a catalyst(s). This is because the reaction between an isocyanate and amine is extremely fast and hence does not need catalysis. 

==Polymer structure==

The word polyurea is derived from the Greek words πολυ- - poly- meaning &quot;many&quot;; and ουρίας - oûron meaning &quot;to urinate&quot; (referring to the substance urea, found in urine). Urea or carbamide is an organic compound with the chemical formula (NH2)2CO. The molecule has two amine groups (–NH2) joined by a carbonyl functional group (C=O). In a polyurea, alternating monomer units of isocyanates and amines react with each other to form urea linkages. Ureas can also be formed from the reaction of isocyanates and water which forms a carbamic acid intermediate. This acid quickly decomposes by splitting off carbon dioxide and leaving behind an amine. This amine then reacts with another isocyanate group to form the polyurea linkage. This two step reaction is used to make what is commonly but improperly called polyurethane foam. The carbon dioxide that is liberated in this reaction is the primary blowing (foaming) agent especially in many polyurethane foams which more precisely should be called polyurethane/urea foams.

==Uses== 
Polyurea and polyurethane are copolymers used in the manufacture of spandex, which was invented in 1959.

Polyurea was originally developed in automotive applications in the 1980s but other applications such as protecting tabletop edges followed. Its fast reactivity and relative moisture insensitivity made it useful for coatings on large surface area projects, such as secondary containment, manhole and tunnel coatings, tank liners, and truck bed liners. Excellent adhesion to concrete and steel is obtained with the proper primer and surface treatment. They can also be used for spray molding and armor. Some polyureas reach strengths of 40 MPa (6000 psi) tensile and over 500% elongation making it a tough coating. The quick cure time allows many coats to be built up quickly. The high strength, impact and abrasion resistance of polyurea coatings is a key reason for their use.
In 2014, a polyurea elastomer-based material was shown to be self-healing, melding together after being cut in half. The material also includes inexpensive commercially available compounds. The elastomer molecules were tweaked, making the bonds between them longer. The resulting molecules are easier to pull apart from one another and better able to rebond at room temperature with almost the same strength. The rebonding can be repeated. Elastic, self-healing paints and other coatings recently took a step closer to common use, thanks to research being conducted at the University of Illinois. Scientists there have used &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; components to create a polymer that melds back together after being cut in half, without the addition of other chemicals.

Polyurea has become a preferred long term solution for narrowboats. The traditional coating with bitumen, known as &quot;blacking&quot; is being replaced with the practice of using polyurea coatings. The clearest advantage is that it is not necessary to reapply a coat every 3–4 years. It is thought that polyurea coatings last 25–30 years.

Commercial trademarks for Polyurea include Line-X, GLS 100R, and Pentens SPU-1000, to name a few. There are multiple possible polyurea formulations. The Polyurea Development Association is a trade association that represents the interests of polyurea coating manufacturers.

<text>Bloor–Yonge is a subway station on Line 1 Yonge–University and Line 2 Bloor–Danforth in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Located in Downtown Toronto, under the intersection of Yonge Street and Bloor Street, it is the busiest subway station in the system, handling over 200,000 passengers on an average weekday.

==History==
The station was opened in 1954 and designed by Charles B. Dolphin. It was originally named &quot;Bloor&quot;, and connected with a pair of enclosed platforms in the centre of Bloor Street to allow interchange with Bloor streetcars within the fare-paid zone. When the streetcars were replaced with the Bloor-Danforth subway in 1966, the station began to be shown on maps as &quot;Bloor–Yonge&quot;. However, actual platform signs still show &quot;Bloor&quot; on the Yonge–University line and &quot;Yonge&quot; on the Bloor–Danforth line, following a naming style common in New York subway station complexes, where only the platform&#x27;s cross street is shown on the platform signs.

Similarly, the automated station announcement system installed from 2007 to 2008 refers to the station as &quot;Bloor&quot; on Line 1 and &quot;Yonge&quot; on Line 2 respectively. The new Toronto Rocket subway trains that operate on Line 1 refers to the station as &quot;Bloor–Yonge&quot; along with &quot;Change for Line 2&quot;. It is the only TTC station named in this way; all other interchanges share the same name for both lines; i.e. .

The station used to feature a small retail concourse along the corridor leading from the entrance at the south side of Bloor Street. This concourse was closed and disappeared during the construction of the office building at 33 Bloor Street East in the late 1980s.

Due to its congestion, the TTC has had to expand the station. In 1992, it took advantage of building construction over the Yonge–University portion of the station to open it out and widen the platforms.

In 1996, the station became accessible with elevators as one of the TTC&#x27;s first accessible stations.

The TTC experimented with crowd-control measures on the southbound platform of the Yonge–University level on November 24, 2009, and made these permanent as they allowed for improved passenger flow by discouraging crowding near the stairs leading to the Bloor–Danforth level. These measures also reduced dwell times by a few seconds, such that a few more trains can enter the station during rush hour without building additional capacity.

Increasing ridership has led to overcrowding of the station and discussion of a potential Relief Line. The TTC took various crowd-control measures during peak periods; empty trains were often dispatched to the station to clear the platform. Signal upgrades and other improvements on Line 1 have relieved the station and line of some crowding, but a study conducted by Metrolinx concluded that the benefits would only last until 2031.

, a trial for new numerical signage referring to the subway routes such as Line 1 for the Yonge line and Line 2 for the Bloor line were phased in on signs and maps at the station.

In April 2019, as a 6-month trial project, the TTC installed floor decals along platform edges to direct rush-hour crowds boarding trains. The decals, located near where the train doors open, indicate where passengers on the platform should stand in order not to block passengers leaving the train. The decals have two background colours – grey and blue – where the blue decals (with a wheelchair symbol) indicate where passengers with mobility problems should board. The blue decals are installed near platform elevators. Such decals have already been successfully used at York University station.

==Subway infrastructure in the vicinity==
North of the station the Yonge–University line crosses under Church Street in a tunnel then emerges to the surface at the Ellis Portal, continuing in an open cut through Rosedale Station. South to Wellesley Station, the line was constructed by cut-and-cover, with the surface areas now occupied by a Toronto Parking Authority multi-storey garage at Charles Street and three parks maintained by the City of Toronto – George Hislop Park, Norman Jewison Park, and James Canning Gardens south of that.

The east–west Bloor–Danforth centre platform was constructed under the existing north–south Yonge–University side platforms, and is fully accessible by elevator.

Between Yonge and Sherbourne Station to the east, the Bloor–Danforth line crosses to the south side of Bloor Street in a long section of bored tunnel, rather than the shallow cut-and-cover method used to construct most of the line. Cumberland Terrace, a two-storey shopping centre, has been built over the right of way west of Yonge Street to Bay Street.

==Entrances==

There are six entrances to Bloor–Yonge station. The main entrances along with the fare collector booth and elevators are located at the northeast side via the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Centre and at the southeast side via the Xerox building. There is also an unmanned automatic entrance at the northeast corner which leads directly to the Line 2 platform and is accessible only to Presto card holders since January 2018. All entrances are located near the intersection of Bloor and Yonge streets.

==Nearby landmarks==
Nearby landmarks include the Toronto Reference Library, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Centre, and 2 Bloor Street West.

== Future expansion ==
Since April 2019, the TTC has been proposing a major upgrade to Bloor–Yonge station, including adding a second Line 2 platform similar to the platform added at Union station in 2014. The project is mainly to address platform crowding. At that time, the estimated cost was $1.1billion. By October 2020, the project cost had risen to $1.5billion and had a target completion of 2029. The project includes:
* A new Line 2 platform for eastbound traffic and conversion of the existing centre platform for westbound traffic only
* Extension and widening of both Line 1 platforms at the north end
* A new substation
* 5 new fan plants
* A new station entrance
* Platform screen doors

==Surface connections==

Transfers to buses occur at curbside stops located at Bloor Street and Yonge Street outside the station. TTC routes serving the station include:

<doc id="1304312" wikidata="Q1437483" url="?curid=1304312" title="Brownian noise">
<text>In science, Brownian noise, also known as Brown noise or red noise, is the type of signal noise produced by Brownian motion, hence its alternative name of [[random walk]] noise. The term &quot;Brown noise&quot; does not come from the color, but after Robert Brown, who documented the erratic motion for multiple types of inanimate particles in water. The term &quot;red noise&quot; comes from the &quot;white noise&quot;/&quot;white light&quot; analogy; red noise is strong in longer wavelengths, similar to the red end of the visible spectrum.

==Explanation==
The graphic representation of the sound signal mimics a Brownian pattern. Its spectral density is inversely proportional to &quot;f&quot; 2, meaning it has higher intensity at lower frequencies, even more so than pink noise. It decreases in intensity by 6 dB per octave (20 dB per decade) and, when heard, has a &quot;damped&quot; or &quot;soft&quot; quality compared to white and pink noise. The sound is a low roar resembling a waterfall or heavy rainfall. See also violet noise, which is a 6 dB &quot;increase&quot; per octave.

Strictly, Brownian motion has a Gaussian probability distribution, but &quot;red noise&quot; could apply to any signal with the 1/&quot;f&quot; 2 frequency spectrum.

==Power spectrum==
A Brownian motion, also known as a Wiener process, is obtained as the integral of a white noise signal:
formula_1
meaning that Brownian motion is the integral of the white noise formula_2, whose power spectral density is flat:
formula_3

Note that here formula_4 denotes the Fourier transform, and formula_5 is a constant. An important property of this transform is that the derivative of any distribution transforms as
formula_6
from which we can conclude that the power spectrum of Brownian noise is
formula_7

An individual Brownian motion trajectory presents a spectrum formula_8, where the amplitude formula_5 is a random variable, even in the limit of an infinitely long trajectory.

==Production==
Brown noise can be produced by integrating white noise. That is, whereas (digital) white noise can be produced by randomly choosing each sample independently, Brown noise can be produced by adding a random offset to each sample to obtain the next one. As Brownian noise contains infinite spectral power at low frequencies, the signal tends to drift away infinitely from the origin. A leaky integrator might be used in audio or electromagnetic applications to ensure the signal does not “wander off”, that is, exceed the limits of the system&#x27;s dynamic range. This turns the Brownian noise into Ornstein–Uhlenbeck noise, which has a flat spectrum at lower frequencies, and only becomes “red” above the chosen cutoff frequency.

Brownian noise can also be computer-generated by first generating a white noise signal, Fourier-transforming it, then dividing the amplitudes of the different frequency components by the frequency (in one dimension), or by the frequency squared (in two dimensions) etc. Matlab programs are available to generate Brownian and other power-law coloured noise in one or any number of dimensions.

===Sample===

==Experimental evidence==
Evidence of Brownian noise, or more accurately, of Brownian processes has been found in different fields including chemistry, electromagnetism, fluid-dynamics, economics, and human neuromotor control.

===Human neuromotor control===
In human neuromotor control, Brownian processes were recognized as a biomarker of human natural drift in both postural tasks—such as quietly standing or holding an object in your hand—as well as dynamic tasks. The work by Tessari et al. highlighted how these Brownian processes in humans might provide the first behavioral support to the neuroscientific hypothesis that humans encode motion in terms of descending neural velocity commands.

<text>In vexillology, a state flag is either the flag of the government of a sovereign state, or the flag of an individual federated state (subnational administrative division).

==Government flag==
A state flag is a variant of a national flag (or occasionally a completely different design) specifically designated and restricted by law or custom (theoretically or actually) to use by a country&#x27;s government or its agencies. For this reason, they are sometimes referred to as &quot;government flags&quot;. In many countries the state flag and the civil flag (as flown by the general public) are identical, but in other countries, notably those in Latin America, central Europe, and Scandinavia, the state flag is a more complex version of the national flag, often featuring the national coat of arms or some other emblem as part of the design. Scandinavian countries also use swallowtailed state flags, to further differentiate them from civil flags.

In addition, some countries have state ensigns, separate flags for use by non-military government ships such as guard vessels. For example, government ships in the United Kingdom fly the Blue Ensign.

State flags should not be confused with the national flag as used by military organizations; these are referred to as war flags and naval ensigns.

===National flags with separate state and civil versions===
== Flag of a federated state (subnational entity) ==
In Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, the United States, and some other federalized countries, the term state flag can have a different usage, as it frequently refers to an official flag of any of the individual states or territorial subdivisions that make up the nation.

To avoid confusion with the first meaning of the term, however, such a flag would be more precisely referred to as &quot;the flag of the state of X&quot;, rather than &quot;the state flag of X&quot;. For this usage, see also:

* Flags of the Argentine provinces
* Flags of the Australian states
* Flags of the Austrian states
* Flags of the Brazilian states
* Flags of the Canadian provinces
* Flags of the German states
* Flags of the Malaysian states
* Flags of the Mexican states
* Flags of the Nigerian states
* Flags of Pakistani provinces and territories
* Flags of the U.S. states and territories

<text>The 2004 United States presidential election in Florida took place on November 2, 2004, as part of the 2004 United States presidential election. Voters chose 27 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.

Florida was won by incumbent President George W. Bush by a 5.01% margin of victory. Prior to the election, most news organizations considered this a tossup, or swing state, but was eventually described as leaning towards Bush near the end of the campaign. Once again, Florida was under the national spotlight due to its high number of electoral votes and recent memory of the controversy surrounding the 2000 Florida vote. Turnout was much higher, going from an estimated 6 million voters in 2000 to over 7.5 million voters showing up to vote in 2004. 

Bush&#x27;s more comfortable victory in Florida this time around was attributed to the popularity of his brother, Jeb, who the state&#x27;s governor and had approval ratings greater than 60%. Kerry became the first Democrat since Michael Dukakis in the 1988 election to not flip a single county in the state, although he did improve on Al Gore&#x27;s margins in Gadsden County and Jefferson County. This was the last time a Republican won a majority of the state&#x27;s popular vote until 2020.

==Campaign==
===Predictions===
There were 12 news organizations who made state-by-state predictions of the election. Here are their last predictions before election day.

===Polling===


Throughout the general election, candidates exchanged narrow leads in the state. The final 3 poll averaged showed Bush leading with 49% to Kerry&#x27;s 47%.

===Fundraising===
Bush raised $16,956,510. Kerry raised $7,285,151.

===Advertising and visits===
This state was heavily targeted as a swing state. Over the course of the election, Bush visited the state 15 times to Kerry&#x27;s 18 times. Also, both candidates spent heavily on television advertisements, spending an estimated $3 million each week.

== Analysis ==
During the 2004 U.S. presidential election, numerous allegations of irregularities were made concerning the voting process in Florida. These allegations included missing and uncounted votes, machine malfunction, and a lack of correlation between the vote count and exit polling.

In the prior election, Ralph Nader obtained over 2% of the vote, thus Bush won with less than 50% of the vote, making his approval rating and his brother&#x27;s approval ratings the deciding factor of the state. Polls throughout the campaign indicated that Florida was too close to call, prompting concerns about a repeat of the 2000 fiasco. However, the high popularity of George W. Bush&#x27;s brother, Republican Governor Jeb Bush, contributed to a relatively comfortable victory for Bush, by a margin of 5% over his Democratic rival, John Kerry. Despite this, Florida remained the most Democratic of the 11 states of the former Confederacy, and Kerry&#x27;s 5% loss in Florida was the closest he came to carrying any Confederate state.

While the South Florida metropolitan area mostly voted for Kerry, the other parts of the state mainly supported Bush, being culturally closer to the rest of the southern United States than to Miami, home to large Hispanic and Jewish populations, as well as retirees and transplants from the largely liberal Northeastern United States.

Key to Bush&#x27;s victory was increased turnout in Republican areas. Bush&#x27;s margin of victory in several counties topped 70%, particularly in the Florida Panhandle. Bush also won a significant number of heavily populated and fast-growing areas including Jacksonville, the entire Tampa Bay area, Southwest Florida, Orlando, the Space Coast, and Ocala.

Osceola and Hillsborough counties would not vote Republican again until 2024.

, this is the last time that the city of Orlando has voted Republican in a presidential election.

== Results ==

===By county===

===By congressional district===
Bush won 18 of 25 congressional districts. Both candidates won a district held by the other party.
== Electors ==
Technically the voters of Florida cast their ballots for electors: representatives to the Electoral College. Florida is allocated 27 electors because it has 25 congressional districts and 2 senators. All candidates who appear on the ballot or qualify to receive write-in votes must submit a list of 27 electors, who pledge to vote for their candidate and his or her running mate. Whoever wins the majority of votes in the state is awarded all 27 electoral votes. Their chosen electors then vote for president and vice president. Although electors are pledged to their candidate and running mate, they are not obligated to vote for them. An elector who votes for someone other than his or her candidate is known as a faithless elector.

The electors of each state and the District of Columbia met on December 13, 2004, to cast their votes for president and vice president. The Electoral College itself never meets as one body. Instead the electors from each state and the District of Columbia met in their respective capitols.

The following were the members of the Electoral College from Florida. All were pledged to and voted for George W. Bush and Dick Cheney.

<doc id="1304318" wikidata="Q1040680" url="?curid=1304318" title="Rosedale station (Toronto)">
<text>Rosedale is a station on Line 1 Yonge–University of the Toronto subway. It is located on the east side of Yonge Street at Crescent Road.

Despite its proximity to downtown Toronto, it is one of the lesser used stations in the subway system, averaging only riders daily in . This reflects the fact that no high volume surface bus routes connect to the station and the affluent Rosedale neighbourhood has a lower population density and lacks major destinations.

There is only one entrance to the station, the entrance acts as the concourse, and the subway platforms are directly below. Wi-Fi service is available at this station.

, construction had started to install two elevators to make Rosedale station accessible. The elevators will connect the street-level concourse to each of the north- and southbound platforms. Construction is expected to be completed in mid-2025.

== Architecture ==

This open-air station has separate canopies over the two platforms. Two pedestrian bridges allow access to the northbound platform on the east side, one from the main entrance off Crescent Road and the other from the bus platforms on the west side of the station.

The station, designed by John B. Parkin in 1947 and opened in 1954, was designated as a heritage property, under PART IV of the &quot;Ontario Heritage Act&quot; by City of Toronto By-law 440-90, passed August 13, 1990.
Despite the station&#x27;s historic designation the original large green-blue Vitrolite panels and black trim on the platform walls were replaced by small square dark green tiles in a unique criss-cross pattern with yellow lettering and no trim.

== Subway infrastructure in the vicinity ==

After leaving Bloor station northbound, the Yonge–University line crosses under Church Street in a tunnel and emerges to the surface at the &quot;Ellis Portal&quot;, running in a cutting through Rosedale station. Originally the line continued north in open cut all the way to the &quot;Price Portal&quot;, where the tunnel resumed, but a one-block section from Rowanwood Drive to Price was roofed over in 2002 for parking.

==Budd Sugarman Park==

The southwesterly portion of the property, which is surplus to the needs of the TTC for use as part of the subway or bus station, has been developed as a public park. The park is named in honour of the civic activist Budd Sugarman, who died in 2004. In 2008 the City of Toronto, Parks, Forestry and Recreation Division proposed an expansion of the park along Yonge Street and a reconfiguration of the bus loop. This was rejected by the TTC on the grounds that it would negatively affect passengers and bus operations, while providing no transit benefits, and eliminate any potential long term development of the site, which is contrary to a stated policy of encouraging development at subway stations.

== Nearby landmarks ==
Nearby landmarks include Ramsden Park and the Studio Building.

<doc id="1304319" wikidata="Q568575" url="?curid=1304319" title="Jan Frans van Bloemen">
<text>Jan Frans van Bloemen (baptized 12 May 1662 - buried 13 June 1749) was a Flemish landscape painter mainly active in Rome. Here he was able to establish himself as the leading painter of views (vedute) of the Roman countryside depicted in the aesthetic of the classical landscape tradition.

==Life==
Born in Antwerp, Jan Frans van Bloemen was a younger brother of Pieter van Bloemen. He likely trained with his brother. Between 1681 and 1684, he was in his native Antwerp a pupil of Anton Goubau, a painter of market scenes and bamboccianti (low-life) subjects situated in Roman or Mediterranean settings.

He travelled to Paris around 1682 and resided there for a few years. He then moved to Lyon where his brother Pieter van Bloemen was staying. He probably met the painter Adriaen van der Kabel around this time. Via Turin, Jan Frans and Pieter van Bloemen travelled on to Rome where in 1688 they were registered in the parish of Sant’Andrea delle Fratte. In 1690 a third painting brother, Norbert van Bloemen (1670–1746), joined them as well. Whereas Pieter returned to Antwerp in 1694 and Norbert left for Amsterdam before 1724, Jan Frans remained in Rome for the rest of his life, except for a few trips to Naples, Sicily and Malta, which he undertook with his brother Pieter. The Dutch-born painter Caspar van Wittel, who lived in Rome since 1675, became the godfather of his first child.

Van Bloemen was successful in Rome and received commissions for the painting of large vedute from prominent patrons such as the Queen of Spain Elizabeth Farnese, the Roman nobility and the Pope.

He joined the Bentvueghels, the association of Dutch and Flemish artists in Rome, where he took the nickname &quot;Orizzonte&quot; or &quot;Horizonti&quot;. This nickname referred to the distance he painted in his landscapes. While van Bloemen was a much locally patronized painter, he was unable to gain acceptance into the pre-eminent Roman painter&#x27;s guild, the Accademia di San Luca, until he was over 70 years old. Some of the resistance may have arisen from the Roman establishment&#x27;s disdain for landscape painting as a demonstration of skill.

Among his pupils were Franz Ignaz Oefele, Gabrielle Ricciardelli, and Nicolò Bonito. He died in Rome in 1749.

==Work==

Van Bloemen predominantly painted classical landscapes, taking his inspiration from the Roman &quot;Campagna&quot;. His landscapes, with their recession through a series of planes, soft, warm lightning and classical and religious subject matter, drew on the examples of artists such as Claude Lorrain and Gaspard Dughet. Van Bloemen&#x27;s paintings are exquisitely imbued with that &quot;difficult-to-define pastoral ambience&quot; which helped to make him such a great painter in the eyes of his contemporaries. His vedute fall into the category that combine reality with imaginary elements.

His landscapes have an Arcadian lushness, with mountains, streams, distant hamlets, and small inhabitants painted with imprecise &quot;pittura di tocco&quot; (&#x27;painting of touch&#x27;) using small dotting and spirited brush-strokes. Unlike van Wittel, van Bloemen did not generally depict views of areas distant from Rome such as the Tiber Valley or the Alban hills. His subjects were limited to views in the immediate vicinity of Rome, an outline of which was typically visible in his compositions. Van Bloemen was in particular known for his &#x27;estate views&#x27; representing the estates of the nobility in the Roman Campagna. His views aim to associate the modern estate view with the classical arcadian landscape. Rather than offering the wide panoramic views, distant horizon and atmospheric effects associated with topographical landscapes, van Bloemen&#x27;s estate views emphasize minute observation of reality and a limited viewpoint. The estates are thus made to appear as immutable features of the local landscape.

He worked together with other painters who painted the figures in his landscapes such as Carlo Maratti, Placido Costanzi and Pompeo Batoni. However, he only relied on such collaboration with figure painters in the last decades of his life when he produced his most ambitious classicising compositions. Even then he only relied on these figure specialists for the most prominent figures in the foreground while he took care of the minor characters. In fact, van Bloemen was an accomplished staffage painter and he was very skilled at quickly learning to imitate the style of his collaborators. As a result, many of the figures in his paintings that are attributed to prestigious contemporaries were actually by his own hand. He collaborated most frequently with Placido Costanzi. He regarded the pair of paintings representing &quot;The Flight to Egypt&quot; and &quot;The Rest on the Flight to Egypt&quot; as his best collaboration with Placido Costanzi who painted the figures.

His landscape drawings, which often depict imaginary ruins, have been confused with those of his brother Pieter, who is better known for his drawings of figures and animals. Jan Frans van Bloemen also made pen drawings of buildings in and around Rome.

<text>Eleanor of Castile (1241 – 28 November 1290) was Queen of England as the first wife of Edward I. She was educated at the Castilian court and also ruled as Countess of Ponthieu in her own right () from 1279. After diplomatic efforts to secure her marriage and affirm English sovereignty over Gascony, 13-year-old Eleanor was married to Edward at the monastery of Las Huelgas, Burgos, on 1 November 1254. She is believed to have birthed a child not long after.

Fuller records of Eleanor&#x27;s life with Edward start from the time of the Second Barons&#x27; War onwards, when Simon de Montfort&#x27;s government imprisoned her in Westminster Palace. Eleanor took an active role in Edward&#x27;s reign as he began to take control of Henry III&#x27;s post-war government. The marriage was particularly close; Edward and Eleanor travelled together extensively, including the Ninth Crusade, during which Edward was wounded at Acre. Eleanor was capable of influencing politics but died too young to have much effect.

In her lifetime, Eleanor was disliked for her property dealings; she bought up vast lands such as Leeds Castle from the middling landed classes after they went into arrears on loan repayments to Jewish moneylenders, and the Crown forced them to sell their bonds. These transactions associated Eleanor with the abuse of usury and the supposed exploitation of Jews, bringing her into conflict with the church. She profited from the hanging of over 300 Jewish alleged coin clippers and after the expulsion of the Jews in 1290, she gifted the former Canterbury Synagogue to her tailor. Eleanor died at Harby near Lincoln in late 1290; following her death, Edward built a stone cross at each stopping place on the journey to London, ending at Charing Cross, known as Eleanor crosses. This series of monuments may have included the renovated tomb of Little St Hugh – who was falsely believed to have been ritually murdered by Jews – to bolster her reputation as an opponent of supposed Jewish criminality.

Eleanor exerted a strong cultural influence. She was a keen patron of literature and encouraged the use of tapestries, carpets and tableware in the Spanish style, as well as innovative garden designs. She was a generous patron of the Dominican friars, founding priories in England, and supporting their work at Oxford and Cambridge universities. Notwithstanding the sources of her wealth, Eleanor&#x27;s financial independence had a lasting impact on the institutional standing of English queens, establishing their future independence of action. After her death, Eleanor&#x27;s reputation was shaped by conflicting fictitious accounts – both positive and negative – portraying her as either the dedicated companion of Edward I or as a scheming Spaniard. These accounts influenced the fate of the Eleanor crosses, for which she is probably best known today. Historians have generally neglected Eleanor and her reign as a topic of serious study, but she has received more attention since the 1980s.

== Early life ==

=== Birth and childhood ===
Eleanor was born in Burgos to Ferdinand III of Castile and Joan, Countess of Ponthieu. She was named after her paternal great-grandmother Eleanor of England, the daughter of Eleanor of Aquitaine and Henry II of England.

Eleanor was the second of five children; her elder brother Ferdinand was born in 1239/40, her younger brother Louis in 1242/43, and two brothers who were born after Louis&#x27;s death in childhood. Because her parents were separated for 13 months while King Ferdinand was on a military campaign in Andalusia – from which he returned to the north of Spain in February 1241 – Eleanor was probably born towards the end of that year. The courts of her father and her half-brother Alfonso X of Castile were known for their literary atmosphere. Both kings encouraged extensive education of the royal children so it is likely Eleanor was educated to a standard higher than the norm, a likelihood that is reinforced by her later literary activities as queen. Eleanor was at her father&#x27;s deathbed in Seville in 1252.

===Prospective bride to Theobald II of Navarre===
Eleanor&#x27;s marriage in 1254 to the future Edward I of England was not the only marriage her family planned for her. The kings of Castile had long made a tenuous claim to be paramount lords of the Kingdom of Navarre due to sworn homage from Garcia VI of Navarre in 1134. In 1253, Ferdinand III&#x27;s heir Alfonso X of Castile – Eleanor&#x27;s half-brother – appears to have stalled negotiations with England in the hope she would marry Theobald II of Navarre. The marriage would have afforded several advantages: the Pyrenees kingdom afforded passage from Castile to Gascony; and Theobald II was not yet of age so an opportunity to rule or potentially annex Navarre into Castile existed. To avoid Castilian control, in August 1253, Margaret of Bourbon – mother and regent to Theobald II – allied with James I of Aragon instead, and as part of that treaty, solemnly promised Theobald would never marry Eleanor.

===Marriage===
In 1252, Alfonso X resurrected an ancestral claim to the Duchy of Gascony in the south of Aquitaine – the last possession of the Kings of England in France – which he claimed had formed part of the dowry of Eleanor of England. Henry III of England swiftly countered Alfonso&#x27;s claims with both diplomatic and military moves. Early in 1253, the two kings began to negotiate; after haggling over the financial provision for Eleanor, Henry and Alfonso agreed she would marry Henry&#x27;s son Edward, who now held the title of Duke of Gascony, and Alfonso would transfer his Gascon claims to Edward. Henry was anxious for the marriage to take place; he willingly abandoned the already-made, elaborate preparations for the knighting of Edward in England and agreed Alfonso would knight Edward on or before the next Feast of Assumption.

Eleanor and Edward were married at the monastery of Las Huelgas, Burgos, on 1 November 1254. Edward and Eleanor were second cousins once removed because Edward&#x27;s grandfather King John of England and Eleanor&#x27;s great-grandmother Eleanor of England were the son and daughter of King Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine. Following the marriage, they spent nearly a year in Gascony and Edward ruled as lord of Aquitaine. During this time Eleanor, aged thirteen and a half, almost certainly gave birth to her first child, a short-lived daughter. Eleanor travelled to England alone in mid 1255 and Edward followed her a few months later.

Henry III resolved the Gascon crisis but Eleanor&#x27;s position in England would have been difficult; some of her relatives travelled to England soon after her marriage. Eleanor&#x27;s brother Henry of Castile stayed in England for three years, hoping Henry III would help him reconcile with his father Alphonso. While Eleanor was still young and childless, the prospect of a new Castilian family faction at court would have been troubling for those surrounding Henry, making Eleanor&#x27;s position precarious.

===Second Barons&#x27; War===
There is little record of Eleanor&#x27;s life in England until the 1260s, when the Second Barons&#x27; War between Henry III and his barons divided the kingdom. During this time, Eleanor actively supported Edward&#x27;s interests, importing archers from Ponthieu, France. Eleanor was in England during the war, and held Windsor Castle and baronial prisoners for Edward. Rumours Eleanor was seeking fresh troops from Castile led the baronial leader Simon de Montfort to order her removal from Windsor Castle in June 1264 after the defeat of the royalist army at the Battle of Lewes.

Edward was captured at Lewes and imprisoned, and Eleanor was confined at Westminster Palace. After Edward&#x27;s and Henry&#x27;s army defeated the baronial army at the Battle of Evesham in 1265, Edward took a major role in reforming the government, and Eleanor rose to prominence. In July 1266, after she had birthed three short-lived daughters, Eleanor gave birth to a son John, who was followed in early 1268 by a second boy named Henry, and in June 1269 by a healthy daughter named Eleanor.

===Crusade===
Eleanor of Castile came from a family who were heavily involved in the Crusades; Eleanor appears to have been very committed to the church&#x27;s call to arms, and took a vow to participate. Women were not obliged to travel to fulfil their vow and if not prohibited from doing so were discouraged. Although other female members of her family had travelled on crusade, it was an unusual thing to do.

By 1270, England was at peace, and Edward and Eleanor left to join Edward&#x27;s uncle Louis IX of France on the Eighth Crusade. Louis died at Carthage before they arrived; the couple spent the winter in Sicily then proceeded to Acre in the Holy Land, where they arrived in May 1271. Eleanor gave birth to a daughter, who is known as Joan of Acre for her birthplace.

The crusade was a militarily failure but Baibars of the Bahri dynasty was worried by Edward&#x27;s presence at Acre and in June 1272, an assassination attempt was made on Edward. Edward was wounded in the arm by a dagger that is thought to have been poisoned. The wound quickly became seriously inflamed and a surgeon saved Edward by excising the diseased flesh after Eleanor was led away from his bed &quot;weeping and wailing&quot;.

Eleanor and Edward left Acre in September 1272. In Sicily that December, they learnt of Henry III&#x27;s death on 16 November. Following a trip to Gascony, where their next child Alphonso – named for Eleanor&#x27;s half-brother Alfonso X – was born, Edward and Eleanor returned to England and were crowned together on 19 August 1274.

==Queen consort of England==
Available evidence indicates Eleanor and Edward were devoted to each other, and it appears that Edward was faithful to her in the marriage. The couple were rarely apart; Eleanor accompanied Edward on military campaigns in Wales, giving birth to their son Edward at Caernarfon Castle on 25 April 1284. Their household records narrate incidents that imply a comfortable, even humorous, relationship. Each year on Easter Monday, Edward allowed Eleanor&#x27;s ladies to trap him in his bed and paid them a token ransom so he could go to her bedroom on the first day after Lent; this custom was so important to Edward that in 1291, on the first Easter Monday after Eleanor&#x27;s death, he gave her ladies the money he would have given them if she had been alive. Edward disliked ceremonies; in 1290, he refused to attend the marriage of Earl Marshal Roger Bigod, 5th Earl of Norfolk; Eleanor paid minstrels to play for him while he sat alone during the wedding.

===Land acquisition and unpopularity===

Eleanor&#x27;s acquisition of lands was unprecedented for an English queen: between 1274 and 1290, she acquired estates worth about £2,600 yearly. This provided a majority of her expenditure, which amounted to £8,000 a year at the time of her death, while income from her dower lands was worth £4,500, to which she would be entitled in the event of Edward&#x27;s death. Edward initiated this process, as he wanted the queen to hold lands sufficient for her financial needs without drawing on funds needed for government, and to be independent if she was widowed. The process began after the Battle of Evesham when Eleanor received the grant of lands formerly held by rebels.

Between 1270 and 1281, a significant method for Eleanor to acquire land was the cheap purchase of debts owed by Christian landlords to Jewish moneylenders. In exchange for cancelling the debts, she received the lands pledged against the debts. Since the early 1200s, the Jewish community had been taxed well beyond its means, leading to a reduction in the capital the small number of rich Jewish moneylenders had to support their lending. Jews were also disallowed from holding land assets. Bonds for lands could be sold to recoup against a defaulted debt but these could only be traded by royal permission, meaning Eleanor and a select group of very wealthy courtiers were the exclusive beneficiaries of these sales. The periodic excessive taxes of the Jews called &quot;tallages&quot; would force them to sell their bonds very cheaply, and these would be bought by courtiers. Access to these cut-price land bonds can be viewed as a form of royal patronage.

 By the 1270s, this situation had led the Jewish community into a desperate position while Edward, Eleanor and a few others gained vast new estates. According to contemporaries, however, the problem resulted from Jewish &quot;usury&quot;, which contributed to a rise in anti-Semitic beliefs. Eleanor&#x27;s participation in Jewish usury and dispossession of middling landowners caused her to be criticised, both by members of the landed classes and by the church. An example of a cheaply-purchased estate is the release of Leeds Castle to Edward and Eleanor by William de Leybourne; it became a favourite residence. Through these acquisitions, Eleanor gained an &quot;unsavoury reputation&quot;. Records of her unpopularity are common: for instance, Walter of Guisborough highlighted her reputation and preserved a contemporaneous poem reflecting her acquisitiveness. The annalist of Dunstable Priory noted in a contemporary notice of her death: &quot;a Spaniard by birth, she acquired many fine manors&quot;. John Peckham, Archbishop of Canterbury, warned Eleanor&#x27;s servants about her activities in the land market and her association with the highly unpopular moneylenders:
A rumour is waxing strong throughout the kingdom and has generated much scandal. It is said that the illustrious lady queen, whom you serve, is occupying many manors, lands, and other possessions of nobles, and has made them her own property – lands which the Jews have extorted with usury from Christians under the protection of the royal court.

Peckham also warned Eleanor of complaints against her officials&#x27; demands upon her tenants.

The majority of the lands Eleanor acquired were not acquired through the cheap acquisition of Jewish bonds. This method declined after 1275, and especially after 1281, because the Crown had largely removed the wealth of the Jewish community. By the late 1280s, Eleanor&#x27;s income from the lands she had acquired was sufficient to fund future purchases. Eleanor&#x27;s selection of lands was judicious, and aimed at consolidation of her estates. Neighbouring rather than isolated lands were chosen, and the price of the potential acquisitions was less important than whether it would make sense for her estate&#x27;s management. Eleanor was able to seek lands because of the intelligence gathered by her advisors, and had tremendous advantages and wealth in being able to choose such strategies. She was also able to compromise with those whose lands were being purchased. It was not necessarily important to her strategy whether lands were immediately handed to her, or for the lowest possible price, for instance, which distinguished her from other courtiers, whose acquisitions tended to be more straightforwardly immediately profitable. There is evidence Eleanor&#x27;s managers could impose very strict terms, and that she would have known of their actions; and she paid close attention to her property dealings. Eleanor acquired debts that had to be cleared on her succession to Ponthieu in 1279, and went on to acquire 24 properties in the region in the following years, partly financed from her English income.

Eleanor&#x27;s executors&#x27; financial accounts record the payments of reparations to many of those who brought actions before the judicial proceedings in 1291, done on Eleanor&#x27;s request shortly before her death to provide redress for wrongdoings in her property dealings. She is likely to have been aware of the heavy-handed tactics of her administrators because she was regularly notified of activities regarding her estates. Notwithstanding the manner by which she acquired her estates and income, Eleanor of Castile&#x27;s queenship is significant in English history for the evolution of a stable financial system for the king&#x27;s wife and for the honing this process gave the queen-consort&#x27;s prerogatives.

===Other income===
As queen, Eleanor had income other than that from her estates. Queen&#x27;s gold was paid as an additional sum of ten percent on taxes. She also benefited from revenues from vacant estates, and could be granted income from trials and seizures, but the income she received from these sources was at the king&#x27;s discretion rather than being a right.

Eleanor was granted significant income from hidden or unclaimed assets resulting from trials. For instance, during the late 1270s, Jews were targeted for coin-clipping offences. Although the evidence was largely fictional, around ten percent of the Jewish population – over 300 individuals – was sentenced to death; their assets were seized and forfeit to the Crown, together with fines for those who escaped hanging. Over £16,500 was collected, from which Eleanor received a significant portion. Other income from Jews came from seizures of their property at death, particularly if Eleanor had close financial relationships with them. Following the 1290 Edict of Expulsion, with which the whole Jewish population was expelled from England, their houses, debts and other property was forfeit to the Crown. Around £2,000 was raised for the Crown from sales but much was given away in about 85 grants to courtiers, friends and family; Eleanor gave the synagogue at Canterbury to her tailor.

===Political influence===
Eleanor was given little overt political role; even in diplomatic matters her role was minor. Edward heeded her advice on the age at which their daughters could marry foreign rulers, preventing her 12-year-old daughter Eleanor from leaving England in 1282. Eleanor of Castile was in part educated in diplomatic practices – such as giving gifts to visiting princes and envoys, as a means to win influence, and in the art of interceding to reduce friction from disputes – by Edward&#x27;s mother Eleanor of Provence. While Edward honoured his obligations to Eleanor&#x27;s father Alfonso X, his support may be seen as relatively limited. When Alfonso&#x27;s need was desperate in the early 1280s, Edward did not send English knights to Castile but sent knights from Gascony, which was closer to Castile.

Eleanor played a role in Edward&#x27;s counsels but she did not overtly exercise power except on occasions when she was appointed to mediate disputes between nobles in England and Gascony. Eleanor directed Edward&#x27;s attention to Vegetius when she commissioned an Old French translation of &quot;De Re Militari&quot; while on Crusade in Acre in 1272. She also intervened in disputes, for instance to limit the consequences of the Baronial rebellions and to defend the Earl of Cornwall in 1287 against charges of incompetence, arguing they were unjustified. Eleanor was a &quot;clever operator&quot; at court with &quot;unique influence&quot; due to Edward&#x27;s love for her. She appears to have limited her role to avoid the wide criticism her mother-in-law had experienced, and perhaps due to her immediate concerns with pregnancies and building her landholdings.

Edward was prepared to resist Eleanor&#x27;s demands or to stop her if he felt she was excessive in her activities, and he expected his ministers to restrain her if her actions threatened to inconvenience important people in his realm; on one occasion, the Lord Chancellor Robert Burnell assured the Bishop of Winchester, from whom the queen was demanding the repayment of a debt the bishop owed her, that he would speak with the queen and that afterwards the business would end happily for the bishop. As queen, Eleanor&#x27;s major opportunity for power and influence would have come later in her life, when her sons grew older, by promoting their political and military careers.

====Promotion of her relatives====
Eleanor patronised many of her relatives, though as queen, given the unpopularity of foreigners in England, and the criticism of Henry III and Eleanor of Provence&#x27;s generosity to them, Eleanor of Castile was cautious to choose which cousins to support. Rather than marry her male cousins to English heiresses, which would put English wealth in foreign hands, Eleanor arranged marriages to English barons for her female cousins. Edward strongly supported Eleanor in these endeavours, which provided him and his family – alongside Eleanor in her potential widowhood – with an expanded network of potential supporters.

In a few cases, Eleanor&#x27;s marriage projects for her female cousins provided Edward, as well as her father-in-law Henry III, with opportunities to sustain healthy relations with other realms. The marriage of Eleanor&#x27;s kinswoman Marguerite de to the Earl of Ulster, one of the most-influential English noblemen in Ireland, gave Edward a new family connection in Ireland and also with Scotland because Marguerite&#x27;s cousin Marie de Coucy was the mother of Edward&#x27;s brother-in-law Alexander III. The earliest of Eleanor&#x27;s recorded marriage projects linked one of her Châtellerault cousins with a member of the Lusignan family, Henry III&#x27;s highly favoured maternal relatives, strengthening the king&#x27;s ties with that family and creating a new tie between the English king and a powerful family in Poitou, northern Gascony.

===Cultural and other interests===
Although she was allowed no overt political role, Eleanor found other satisfying outlets. She was an active patron of literature, maintaining the only royal scriptorium known to have existed at the time in Northern Europe, with scribes and at least one illuminator to copy books for her. Some of the works produced were vernacular romances and saints&#x27; lives but Eleanor&#x27;s tastes were wider than that and were not limited to the products of her own writing office. The number and variety of new works written for her show her interests were broad and sophisticated.

After Eleanor succeeded her mother as Countess of Ponthieu in 1279, a romance about the life of a fictional, ninth-century count of Ponthieu was written for her. Eleanor commissioned an Arthurian romance with a Northumbrian theme, possibly for the marriage of the Northumbrian lord John de Vescy, who married a close friend and relation of hers. In the 1280s, Archbishop Peckham wrote a theological work for Eleanor to explain angels and their roles. She almost certainly commissioned the Alphonso Psalter, which is now in the British Library, and is also thought to be the commissioner of the Bird Psalter, which bears the arms of Alphonso and his prospective wife. Eleanor&#x27;s accounts reveal her corresponding in 1290 with an Oxford master about one of her books. There is also evidence Eleanor exchanged books with her brother Alfonso X. Eleanor is assumed to have spoken French, which was her mother&#x27;s language and the dominant language of the English court. All of the extant literary works created for Eleanor are in French.

In the domestic sphere, Eleanor emphasised comfort and made changes to residences to reflect her taste. She commissioned piped bath works at Leeds Caste and tiled bathrooms elsewhere, echoing the bathroom culture of Castile. Eleanor popularised the use of tapestries and carpets; the use of hangings and especially floor coverings was noted as a Spanish extravagance on her arrival in London but by the time of her death, it was much in vogue among rich magnates. Eleanor also promoted the use of fine tableware, elegantly decorated knives, and forks, though it is uncertain whether forks were used as personal eating utensils or as serving pieces from the common bowls or platters. She also had considerable influence on the development of garden design in the royal estates. Extensive spending on gardens, including the use of water features (such as fountains) – commonly found in Castilian garden designs – is in evidence at her properties and in most places she stayed. The picturesque Gloriette (or elevated garden building) at Leeds Castle was developed during Eleanor&#x27;s ownership; she also introduced fishponds, aviaries with song birds, and Spanish flora to her gardens and grounds. Her household food supplies appear to have reflected her Spanish upbringing; they include olive oil, French cheese and fresh fruit. She also kept a connection with Acre and her time in the Crusades, ordering foodstuffs and other items from Acre throughout her time in England.

Eleanor had a keen interest in hunting, particularly with dogs. The royal family appears to have stayed each February at Quenington in the Cotswolds for hunting. She was a keen horse rider and employed Spanish horse-breeders. Eleanor enthusiastically played chess and backgammon, and passed this interest to her children.

===Religious views and patronage===
Contemporaneous monastic chroniclers are noticeably silent on Eleanor&#x27;s piety, which was considered an important quality of a queen. The lack of material may be due to Eleanor&#x27;s distance from the English Bishops, who represented traditional hierarchy, and her preference for the Dominican Order of Friars, to whom she was a patron, founding several priories in England and supporting their work at Oxford and Cambridge Universities. Eleanor&#x27;s piety was intellectual and reinforced the idea the higher powers were in Eleanor&#x27;s favour. Apart from her religious foundations, Eleanor was not given to direct good works; she left her chaplains to distribute alms for her. Eleanor gave significant funds to charitable foundations.

===Eleanor as a mother===
Eleanor birthed between 14 and 17 children, only six of whom survived into adulthood. Most of Eleanor&#x27;s children were born at Windsor, although she gave birth to three while on travels. It has been suggested Eleanor and Edward were more devoted to each other than to their children. As king and queen, it was impossible for them to spend much time in one place; when the children were very young, they could not tolerate the rigours of constant travel with their parents. The children had a household that was staffed with attendants who were carefully chosen for competence and loyalty, and with whom the parents regularly corresponded. The children lived in this comfortable establishment until they were about seven years old, after which they began to accompany their parents on important occasions. By the time they were 13, the children spent much of their time with their parents. In 1290, Eleanor sent one of her scribes to join her children&#x27;s household, probably to help with their education.

Eleanor&#x27;s children were frequently cared for by relatives and other trusted families. In 1274, when their six-year-old son Henry lay dying at Guildford neither parent made the short journey from London to see him but Edward&#x27;s mother Eleanor of Provence tended to Henry. Henry had lived with his grandmother while his parents were absent on crusade, and because he was just two years old when they left England in 1270, he could not have had substantial memories of them when they returned to England in August 1274, only weeks before his death. The dowager queen was a more familiar and comforting presence to her grandson than his parents would have been. Edward and Eleanor allowed her mother Joan, Countess of Ponthieu to raise their daughter Joan of Acre (1274–1278) in Ponthieu; the practice of fostering noble children in other dignified households was common. Edward and Eleanor regretted allowing Joan of Ponthieu to foster Joan; when six-year-old Joan travelled to England in 1278, they found she had been spoilt; she was a spirited child and at times defiant.

===Character===
To her immediate friends and family, Eleanor appears to have been kind, loyal and considerate, and although not overtly charming; she appears to have had a sense of humour, employing two fools, for example. Her taste in everyday clothes and emphasis on repairing rather than replacing where possible, contrasting with her predecessors and successors, suggests some practicality in her nature. With those outside her inner circle, Eleanor was frequently harsh and manipulative, and is known to have frequently lost her temper.

Two letters from Peckham show some people thought Eleanor urged Edward to rule harshly, and that she could be a severe woman who did not take it lightly if anyone crossed her, contravening contemporaneous expectations that queens should intercede with their husbands on behalf of the needy, the oppressed and the condemned. Edward warned a convent of nuns: &quot;if they knew what was good for them&quot;, they would accede to the queen&#x27;s wishes and accept into their house a woman the convent had refused, whose vocation Eleanor had decided to sponsor. Records from the king&#x27;s administrations shows Hugh Despenser the Elder, who agreed to allow Eleanor to hold one of his manors for a term of years to clear his debt to her, thought it well to demand official assurances from the King&#x27;s Exchequer the manor would be restored to him as soon as the queen had recovered the exact amount of the debt. A chronicle written at St Albans in 1307–1308 includes the first positive assessment of Eleanor&#x27;s character, though the chronicler may have been writing to flatter her son Edward II, who had succeeded his father in 1307.

== Death ==

Eleanor of Castile had birthed at least 16 children, suggesting she was not frail. Shortly after the birth of her last child, financial accounts from Edward&#x27;s household and her own show frequent payments for medicines for the queen&#x27;s use. The nature of the medicines is not specified in these documents, so the nature of Eleanor&#x27;s illness cannot be deduced until late 1287, when Eleanor is recorded as having a double quartan fever, while she was in Gascony with Edward. This suggests she was suffering from a strain of malaria. Malaria is not directly fatal but weakens its victims and makes them vulnerable to opportunistic infections. Among other complications, the liver and spleen become enlarged, brittle and susceptible to injury, which may cause death from internal bleeding. It is also possible that hereditary heart conditions caused Eleanor&#x27;s death.

Eleanor returned from Gascony in August 1289, and there are signs from early 1290 that Eleanor may have been aware of her impending death. Arrangements were made for the marriage of her daughters Margaret and Joan, and negotiations for the marriage of young Edward of Caernarfon to Margaret, the Maid of Norway, heiress of Scotland, were hurried on. In mid 1290, a tour north through Eleanor&#x27;s properties began, but proceeded much more slowly than usual, and the autumn Parliament was convened in Clipstone rather than in London. Eleanor&#x27;s children were summoned to visit her in Clipstone, despite warnings travel might endanger their health. Following the conclusion of the Parliament, Eleanor and Edward set out on the short distance from Clipstone to Lincoln. By this time, Eleanor was travelling fewer than per day.

Eleanor&#x27;s final stop was at the village of Harby, Nottinghamshire, less than from Lincoln. The journey was abandoned and the queen was lodged in the house of Richard de Weston, the foundations of which can still be seen near Harby&#x27;s parish church. After piously receiving the Church&#x27;s last rites, Eleanor died there on the evening of 28 November 1290, aged 49 and after 36 years of marriage. Edward was at Eleanor&#x27;s bedside to hear her final requests.

Edward was greatly affected by Eleanor&#x27;s death, shown for instance in his January 1291 letter to the abbot of Cluny in France, in which he sought prayers for the soul of the wife &quot;whom living we dearly cherished, and whom dead we cannot cease to love&quot;. Only one of Eleanor&#x27;s four sons survived childhood, and even before she died, Edward worried over the succession: if that son died, their daughters&#x27; husbands might cause a succession war. Edward therefore married again, in 1299 to Margaret of France. He delighted in the sons his new wife bore, but attended memorial services for Eleanor to the end of his life.

===Procession, burial and monuments===

Eleanor&#x27;s embalmed body was borne in great state from Lincoln to Westminster Abbey, through the heartland of Eleanor&#x27;s properties, and accompanied for most of the way by Edward and a substantial cortege of mourners. Edward ordered the erection of memorial crosses at the site of each overnight stop between Lincoln and Westminster. These artistically significant monuments, which were based on crosses in France marking Louis IX&#x27;s funeral procession, enhanced the image of Edward&#x27;s kingship and bear witness to his grief. Eleanor crosses stood at Lincoln, Grantham, Stamford, Geddington, Hardingstone near Northampton, Stony Stratford, Woburn, Dunstable, St Albans, Waltham, Westcheap and Charing. Only three of these monuments have survived, none in their entirety. The cross at Geddington is the best-preserved example. All three monuments have lost their crosses &quot;of immense height&quot; that originally surmounted them; only the lower stages remain. The Waltham cross has been heavily restored and to prevent further deterioration, its original statues of Eleanor are now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.

The monument now known as &quot;Charing Cross&quot; in London, in front of the Charing Cross railway station, was built in 1865 to publicise the railway hotel at Charing station. The original Charing cross was at the top of Whitehall on the south side of Trafalgar Square; it was destroyed in 1647 by Puritans and later replaced with a statue of Charles I.

In the 13th century, embalming involving evisceration and separate burial of heart and body was not unusual. Eleanor was afforded an unusual triple burial; her viscera, heart and body were separately buried. Eleanor&#x27;s viscera were buried in Lincoln Cathedral, where Edward placed a duplicate of the Westminster tomb. The Lincoln tomb&#x27;s original stone chest survives; its effigy was destroyed in the 17th century and was replaced with a 19th-century copy.

Also built in the same style as the Eleanor crosses and Eleanor&#x27;s tomb at Lincoln was the renovated shrine of &quot;Little Saint Hugh&quot;, a cult that was based on a false ritual murder allegation made against Jews. It is likely the association with Eleanor was made to help improve her posthumous reputation because she had been closely associated with the abuse of Jewish loans. According to historians Caroline and Joe Hillaby, the crosses and tomb amounted to a &quot;propaganda coup&quot;, rehabilitating Eleanor&#x27;s image and portraying her as the protector of Christians against the supposed criminality of Jews following the expulsion of the Jewry.

Eleanor&#x27;s heart was buried in the Dominican priory at Blackfriars, London, along with that of her son Alphonso. The accounts of her executors show the monument constructed at the priory to commemorate her heart burial was richly elaborate, and included wall paintings and a metallic angelic statue that stood under a carved stone canopy. It was destroyed in the 16th century during the dissolution of the monasteries.

Eleanor&#x27;s funeral took place in Westminster Abbey on 17 December 1290. Eleanor&#x27;s tomb, which she had probably ordered before her death, consists of a marble chest with carved mouldings and shields – originally painted – of the arms of England, Castile and Ponthieu. The chest is surmounted by William Torel&#x27;s gilt-bronze effigy of Eleanor in the same pose as the image on her great seal. 

==Historical reputation==
Despite her negative reputation in her lifetime, the St Albans Chronicle and the Eleanor Crosses assured Eleanor of Castile a romantic and flattering, if slightly obscure, standing in the two centuries following her death. In 1586, the antiquarian William Camden first published in England the tale of Eleanor saving Edward&#x27;s life at Acre by sucking his wound. Camden ascribed the construction of the Eleanor crosses to Edward&#x27;s grief at the loss of a heroic wife, who had risked her own life to save his. In 1587, Raphael Holinshed&#x27;s &quot;Chronicles of England, Scotland and Ireland&quot; described Eleanor as &quot;the jewel [Edward I] most esteemed ... a godly and modest princess, full of pity, and one that showed much favour to the English nation, ready to relieve every man&#x27;s grief that sustained wrong and to make them friends that were at discord, so far as in her lay.&quot;

A counter-narrative that was driven by rising anti-Spanish feeling in England from the Reformation may have begun to emerge. &quot;The Lamentable Fall of Queene Elenor&quot;, a popular ballad sung to the popular tune &quot;Gentle and Courteous&quot;, is thought to date from the 1550s, and to be an indirect attack on the half-Spanish queen Mary Tudor and her husband Philip II of Spain. The song depicts Eleanor as vain and violent: she demands of the king &quot;that ev&#x27;ry man / That ware long lockes of hair, / Might then be cut and polled all&quot;; she orders &quot;That ev&#x27;ry womankind should have / Their right breast cut away&quot;; she imprisons and tortures the Lady Mayoress of London, eventually murdering the Mayoress with poisonous snakes; she blasphemes against God on the common ground at Charing, causing the ground to swallow her up; and finally, miraculously spat up by the ground at Queen&#x27;s Hithe, and now on her death-bed, she confesses to murder of the Mayoress and to committing infidelity with a friar, by whom she has borne a child.

This was followed in the 1590s by George Peele&#x27;s &quot;The Famous Chronicle of King Edward the First&quot;. The first version of this, written in the early 1590s, is thought to have presented a positive depiction of the relationship between Eleanor and Edward. If so, it disappeared with little trace. The surviving revised version, which was printed in 1593, depicts Eleanor as a haughty &quot;villainess capable of unspeakable treachery, cruelty, and depravity&quot;; she is also depicted as intransigent and hubristic, &quot;concerned primarily with enhancing the reputation of her native nation, and evidently accustomed to a tyrannous and quite un-English exercise of royal prerogative&quot;; delaying her coronation for twenty weeks so she can have Spanish dresses made, and proclaiming she shall keep the English under a &quot;Spanish yoke&quot;. The misdeeds attributed to her in &quot;The Lamentable Fall of Queene Elenor&quot; are repeated and expanded upon; Eleanor is now also shown to box her husband&#x27;s ears. Eleanor confesses to adultery with her brother-in-law Edmund Crouchback and to conceiving all of her children, except Edward I&#x27;s heir Edward II, in adultery; this revelation prompts her unfortunate daughter Joan of Acre, who is fathered by a French friar, to drop dead of shame. This portrait of Eleanor owes little to historicity, and much to the then-current war with Spain and English fears of another attempt at invasion, and is one of a number of anti-Spanish polemics of the period.

It is likely Peele&#x27;s play and the ballad associated with it had a significant effect on the survival of the Eleanor Crosses in the 17th century. Performances of the play and reprints of &quot;The Lamentable Fall&quot; – which was reprinted in 1628, 1629, 1658, and 1664, testifying to its continuing popularity – meant that by the time of the Civil War, this hostile portrait of Eleanor was probably more-widely known than the positive depictions by Camden and Hollingshed. The loss of most of the crosses can be documented or inferred to have occurred between 1643 and 1646, Civil War years during which religious monuments that reflected elements of Catholic practices were targeted for destruction; for example, Parliament&#x27;s Committee for the Demolition of Monuments of Superstition and Idolatry ordered the removal of the Charing Cross in 1643. Eleanor&#x27;s reputation began to become more positive following the 1643 publication of Sir Richard Baker&#x27;s &quot;A History of the Kings of England&quot;, which retold the myth of Eleanor saving her husband at Acre. Thereafter, Eleanor&#x27;s reputation was largely positive and ultimately derived from Camden, whose work was uncritically repeated by historians. In the 19th century the self-styled historian Agnes Strickland used Camden to write the most-positive account of Eleanor. None of these writers used contemporaneous chronicles or records to provide accurate information about Eleanor&#x27;s life.

Such documents began to become widely available in the late 19th century, but when historians began to cite them to suggest Eleanor was not the perfect queen Strickland depicted, many rejected the correction and frequently expressed indignant disbelief anything negative was said about Eleanor. Although historians now more commonly study queenship in its own right and regard medieval queens as worthy of attention, the study of consorts remains uneven; however, Eleanor of Castile&#x27;s career can today be examined as the achievement of an intelligent and determined woman who was able to meet the challenges of a demanding life, though her qualities were often expressed in unpleasant or controversial ways.

<doc id="1304321" wikidata="Q6931228" url="?curid=1304321" title="Mucoid plaque">
<text>Mucoid plaque (or mucoid cap or rope) is a pseudoscientific term used by some alternative medicine advocates to describe what is claimed to be a combination of harmful mucus-like material and food residue that they say coats the gastrointestinal tract of most people. The term was coined by Richard Anderson, a naturopath and entrepreneur, who sells a range of products that claim to &quot;cleanse&quot; the body of such purported plaques.

Many such &quot;colon cleansing&quot; products are promoted to the public on websites that have been described as making misleading medical claims. The presence of laxatives, bentonite clay, and fibrous thickening agents in some of these &quot;cleansing agents&quot; has led to suggestions that the products themselves produce the excreted matter regarded as the plaque.
The concept of a &#x27;mucoid plaque&#x27; has been dismissed by medical experts as having no anatomical or physiological basis.

==History==

Various forms of colon cleansing were popular in the 19th and early 20th century. In 1932, Bastedo wrote in the Journal of the American Medical Association about his observation of mucus masses being removed during a colon irrigation procedure: &quot;When one sees the dirty gray, brown or blackish sheets, strings and rolled up wormlike masses of tough mucus with a rotten or dead-fish odor that are obtained by colon irrigations, one does not wonder that these patients feel ill and that they obtain relief and show improvement as the result of the irrigation.&quot;

While colonic irrigation enjoyed a vogue in the early 20th century as a possible cure for numerous diseases, subsequent research showed that it was useless and potentially harmful. With the scientific rationale for &quot;colon cleansing&quot; disproven, the idea fell into disrepute as a form of quackery, with a 2005 medical review stating that &quot;there is no evidence to support this ill-conceived theory that has been long abandoned by the scientific community.&quot; Similarly, in response to claims that colon cleansing removes &quot;toxins&quot;, Bennett Roth, a gastroenterologist at the University of California, stated that &quot;there is absolutely no science to this whatsoever. There is no such thing as getting rid of quote-unquote &#x27;toxins.&#x27; The colon was made to carry stool. This is total baloney.&quot; The preoccupation with such bowel management products has been described as a &quot;quaint and amusing chapter in the history of weird medical beliefs.&quot; Nevertheless, interest in colonic &quot;autointoxication&quot; as a cause of illness, and in colonic irrigation as a cure, enjoyed a revival in alternative medicine at the end of the 20th century.

The term &quot;mucoid plaque&quot; was coined and popularized by naturopath and entrepreneur Richard Anderson, who sells a range of products that claim to cleanse the body of such purported plaques by causing them to be eliminated. Anderson describes a mucoid plaque as a rubbery, ropey, generally green gel-like mucus film that covers the epithelial cells of the hollow organs, particularly of the alimentary canal. Anderson also claims the plaque can impair digestion and the absorption of nutrients, hold pathogens, and cause illnesses such as diarrhea, bowel cancer, allergies and skin conditions. Based on these claims, he promotes efforts to remove the plaque, and sells a range of products to this end.

Though Anderson argues that his beliefs are backed by scientific research, his claims are primarily supported by anecdotal evidence rather than empirical data, and doctors have noted the absence of mucoid plaques. Anderson claims this is due to medical textbooks failing to cover the concept, which results in doctors not knowing what to look for.

==Medical evaluation==
Practicing physicians have dismissed the concept of mucoid plaque as a hoax and a &quot;non-credible concept&quot;. A pathologist at the University of Texas School of Medicine addressed Anderson&#x27;s claims directly, saying that he has &quot;seen several thousand intestinal biopsies and have never seen any &#x27;mucoid plaque.&#x27; This is a complete fabrication with no anatomic basis.&quot;

Another pathologist, Edward Friedlander, noted that, in his experience, he has never observed anything resembling a &quot;toxic bowel settlement&quot;, and that some online photographs actually depict what he recognises as a blood clot. Commenting on claims that waste material can adhere to the colon, Douglas Pleskow, a gastroenterologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, stated, &quot;that is the urban legend. In reality, most people clear their GI tract within three days.&quot;

In a review of websites promoting products that claim to remove &#x27;mucoid rope&#x27; or plaque from consumers&#x27; intestines, Howard Hochster of New York University wrote that these websites are &quot;abundant, quasi-scientific, and unfortunately convincing to a biologically uneducated public.&quot; He noted that although such sites are entertaining, they are disturbing in that they promote a belief that has no basis in physiology.

Hochster also noted that a preparation marketed to remove mucoid plaque contains laxatives and bulky fibrous ingredients. Thus, the rope-like fecal material expelled from people who consume this product &quot;certainly is a result of the figs and senna in this preparation,&quot; rather than any sort of pathologic &#x27;plaque&#x27;. Other &#x27;colon cleanser&#x27; products contain bentonite clay that, when ingested, would also result in production of bulky stools.

In many cases, customers purchase supplement products that are said to help the body excrete the so-called &#x27;mucoid plaque&#x27;. The customer may consume a number of pills, and then within 12–48 hours, will pass a rope-like fecal material in their subsequent bowel movements. This fecal material is said to be the &#x27;mucoid plaque&#x27;. However, analysis of supplements consumed by the customer shows that the active ingredient is very similar to that of clay used in clumping cat litter. This clay takes a negative mould of the large intestine which is then excreted during the customer&#x27;s next bowel movement.

<doc id="1304325" wikidata="Q1040659" url="?curid=1304325" title="Summerhill station">
<text>Summerhill is a subway station on the Yonge–University line in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located on Shaftesbury Avenue just east of Yonge Street, with the entrance being at the north end of the train platforms.

Like Rosedale station, the next station to the south, it is currently among the least-used stations, with only average weekday ridership. This is mainly due to it having no surface transit connections, except the parallel Yonge Street bus, and no major local destinations. The station has to rely entirely on the immediate Summerhill residential neighbourhood for passengers.

==History==

Summerhill station opened in 1954 as part of the original Yonge line. 

The tunnel connecting Summerhill station with St. Clair station (which is the next station north) originally ended immediately north of the station at Summerhill Avenue and continued in an open cut as far as Pleasant Boulevard. Various sections of this open cut were roofed over as the years passed, and since the early 1980s it has been entirely under cover, except when one block was opened to allow new construction above it. Passengers who look out from the train into the tunnel on this section can still see the sloping sides of the original cut, the stumps of lamp posts and trees, and the undersides of six bridges which still carry six streets (Woodlawn, Summerhill, Shaftesbury, Scrivener, Price and Rowanwood streets) over the line.

South of the station, the tunnel emerges to the surface at Rowanwood Drive. Originally, the line surfaced at Price Portal, but a one-block section from Rowanwood Drive to Price Street was roofed over in 2002 for parking.

In a February 2020 meeting of the TTC board, the TTC proposed a secondary exit for emergency use. The station entrance is at the north end of the station. The proposed exit would be at the south end of the station and emerge to the surface at Scrivener Square. There would be underground corridors to connect the platforms to the new exit, with one corridor running under the subway tracks from the northbound platform to the west side of the tracks.

Construction started in the fourth quarter of 2021 to install elevators to the side platforms; they will connect the north and south platforms to the street level concourse. Construction is scheduled for completion by late 2025.

== Nearby landmarks ==

*The Catholic Pastoral Centre, which includes the offices of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Toronto, is on the northeast corner of Yonge and Shaftesbury beside the station entrance.
*Just south of the station is the Canadian Pacific Railway’s former North Toronto station, now restored and repurposed as an LCBO liquor store. GO Transit’s Midtown line, proposed as recently as 2000 but not a current priority, would have seen that station reopened and served by commuter trains, bypassing Toronto&#x27;s downtown Union Station, which would have turned Summerhill into a major interchange between local public transport and mainline railways.
*The station is a meeting point for walking clubs heading east to the Rosedale Ravine via a staircase from Shaftesbury Avenue down to David A. Balfour Park.
*The Toronto Lawn Tennis Club is also nearby.

== Surface connections ==
All connecting bus routes require a transfer and can be boarded at curbside stops.

TTC routes serving the station include:

<doc id="1304344" wikidata="Q1041215" url="?curid=1304344" title="St. Clair station">
<text>St. Clair is a subway station on Line 1 Yonge–University in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The station opened in 1954 as part of the original Yonge Street subway.

==Description==
The station is located between St. Clair Avenue East and Pleasant Boulevard 
behind the buildings on the east side of Yonge Street. The station has three vertical levels: Main entrance level (level with St. Clair Avenue), concourse level (level with Pleasant Boulevard) and subway platform level. There are elevators, escalators and stairways connecting the levels.

The station has four entrances, all of which accept Presto cards and tickets:
* Main entrance is at street level on its south side of St. Clair Avenue East. This is a staffed, wheelchair-accessible entrance. There is a McDonald&#x27;s restaurant within the station building beside the entrance door.
* The secondary entrance, also wheelchair accessible, is located at the concourse level which is also street level with Pleasant Boulevard. This used to be staffed entrance, until January 5, 2020.
* A third entrance is from the concourse level of St. Clair Centre at 2 St. Clair Avenue East, at the northeast corner with Yonge Street. Stairs at the entrance lead down to the subway platforms.
* A fourth entrance, open during peak hours, is accessed from 1 St. Clair Avenue East (Scotiabank), a building at the southeast corner of the intersection with Yonge Street. Stairs lead to the station concourse level.

The St. Clair streetcar loop runs counter-clockwise behind buildings on the south side St. Clair Avenue East. There are two streetcar platforms within the fare-paid zone: an arrival platform roughly perpendicular to St. Clair Avenue, and a departure platform parallel to the avenue. Both platforms are on the main entrance level.

A bus terminal is located on the south side of the station parallel to and accessed from Pleasant Boulevard. It is on the concourse level within the fare-paid zone next to the station&#x27;s secondary entrance. A multi-storey building stands over the bus roadway and platform.

==History==
On March 30, 1954, the station opened along with the original Yonge subway (Eglinton to Union station).

Originally, in 1954, the station&#x27;s streetcar loop handled streetcars coming from Mount Pleasant Road as well as St. Clair Avenue West. Three routes with four destinations used to pass through the loop all sharing the same track. The streetcar services at the loop were:
* St. Clair route, both westbound to Keele Street and eastbound to Mount Pleasant Road and Eglinton Avenue
* Earlscourt route, westbound to Lansdowne Avenue
* Rogers route (rush hour service), westbound to Rogers Road and Bicknell Avenue

In 1974, the Rogers streetcar route was converted to bus, ending direct rush-hour service between Rogers Road and St. Clair station. This abandonment was due to a streetcar shortage.

On March 30, 1975, the St. Clair route east of St. Clair station became the separate Mt. Pleasant streetcar route. This ended the one-seat ride from Mount Pleasant Road to St. Clair Avenue West thus forcing a change of vehicle at St. Clair station.

On July 25, 1976, the Mt. Pleasant streetcar line was converted to diesel bus, ending streetcar service east of St. Clair station. The Metro Roads Department, responding to complaints from motorists about streetcars on Mount Pleasant Road slowing traffic, forced the line&#x27;s abandonment.

On November 29, 1977, trolley buses replaced diesel buses on route 74 Mt. Pleasant and followed the former streetcar route; thus, the Mount Pleasant trolley buses used the streetcar loop and platforms at St. Clair station rather than the bus terminal. The trolley buses operated out of the Eglinton Garage, the site being used today as the Eglinton station bus terminal.

In 1978, the Earlscourt and St. Clair streetcar routes were merged as the 512 route. With the introduction of the CLRV, streetcar destination signs showed a route number instead of a route name. With this change, St. Clair station served only one streetcar route, although some 512 streetcars continued to be signed as terminating at Lansdowne Avenue during the rush hours.

On December 28, 1991, the trolley buses on route 74 Mt. Pleasant were replaced by diesel buses, which again used the station&#x27;s bus terminal.

Since 2007, the station has been fully accessible with the addition of elevators, escalators and stairway connecting all levels.

==Subway infrastructure in the vicinity==
North of the station, the tunnel jogs west to cross to the west side of Yonge Street. At the &quot;Muir Portal&quot; the line runs in an open cut for 1.3 kilometres, between Yonge Street and the Davisville Yard, the TTC&#x27;s original subway yard.

South of the station, the train continues to travel in a tunnel. Originally, the area south of the station was open-cut until Summerhill Avenue, immediately before Summerhill station; the line continued in open cut as far as Pleasant Boulevard, just before the next station to the north, St. Clair. Various sections of this open cut were roofed over as the years passed, and since the early 1980s it has been entirely under cover, except when one block was opened out and re-covered, to allow new construction above it. Passengers who look out into the tunnel on this section can still see the sloping sides of the original cut, the stumps of lamp posts and trees, and the undersides of four road bridges.

Nearby landmarks include the David A. Balfour Park (Vale of Avoca section of Rosedale ravine), St. Michael&#x27;s Cemetery, Deer Park, Moore Park, Upper Canada College, and Forest Hill.

<text>is a 2002 historical drama film directed by Yōjirō Takita loosely based on real historical events. &quot;When the Last Sword Is Drawn&quot; won the Best Film award at the 2004 Japanese Academy Awards, as well as the prizes for Best Actor (Kiichi Nakai) and Best Supporting Actor (Kōichi Satō). It received a further eight nominations.

==Synopsis==
The film tells the story of two Shinsengumi samurai. Saitō Hajime (played by Kōichi Satō) is a heartless killer. Yoshimura Kanichiro (played by Kiichi Nakai) appears to be a money-grabbing and emotional swordsman from the northern area known as Nambu Morioka.

The main storyline is set during the fall of the Tokugawa shogunate, but it is told in a series of flashbacks as Saitō and another man reminisce. The themes include conflicting loyalty to the clan, lord, and family.

More than just swordplay, it is the story of a man willing to do anything for the good of his family, even if it means never being able to see them.

<text>Liocranidae is a family of araneomorph spiders first described by Eugène Simon in 1897. They are one of several groups called &quot;sac spiders&quot;. The holarctic genus &quot;Agroeca&quot; is the best-known, but it also includes various genera of more obscure spiders that still lack a diagnosis. Two species in the North American genus &quot;Neoanagraphis&quot; are found in the extremely dry conditions in the Mojave, Sonoran and Chihuahuan deserts. Females live in animal burrows while males wander and are the ones most often caught in pitfall traps.

<doc id="1304350" wikidata="Q178597" url="?curid=1304350" title="Robert Bloet">
<text>Robert Bloet (sometimes Robert Bloett; died 1123) was Bishop of Lincoln 1093–1123 and Chancellor of England. Born into a noble Norman family, he became a royal clerk under King William I. Under William I&#x27;s son and successor King William II, Bloet was first named chancellor then appointed to the See of Lincoln. Continuing to serve the king while bishop, Bloet remained a close royal councillor to William II&#x27;s successor, King Henry I. He did much to embellish Lincoln Cathedral, and gave generously to his cathedral and other religious houses. He educated a number of noblemen, including illegitimate children of Henry I. He also was the patron of the medieval chronicler Henry of Huntingdon, and was an early patron of Gilbert of Sempringham, the founder of the Gilbertine monastic order.

==Early life==
Bloet was a member of the Norman noble family that held Ivry in Normandy. Bloet was related in some manner to Hugh, the Bishop of Bayeux from 1015 to 1049, and Hugh&#x27;s brother John, who was Bishop of Avranches from 1060 to 1067. Another relative was Richard Bloet, Abbot of St Albans Abbey.

==Chancellor and bishop==
Bloet was a royal clerk in the household of King William I of England. He accompanied William I&#x27;s son, William Rufus, when Rufus traveled to England to claim the throne after William I&#x27;s death. Rufus named Bloet as chancellor by January 1091, but then named Bloet to the See of Lincoln in March 1093 after the death of Remigius de Fécamp. Bloet was appointed at the same time that Anselm was appointed Archbishop of Canterbury, during a severe illness when Rufus feared he was dying. Bloet was consecrated at Hastings not long before 22 February 1094, probably on 12 February the day after the dedication of the church at Battle Abbey. By 19 March 1094 he had been replaced as chancellor by William Giffard.

Prior to Bloet&#x27;s consecration, the Archbishop of York, Thomas of Bayeux, who had previously had a claim to supervise the see of Lincoln, tried to prevent the Archbishop Anselm&#x27;s consecrating Bloet. Thomas argued that the area of Lindsey, which was within the diocese of Lincoln, really belonged to the archdiocese of York. The medieval chronicler Hugh the Chanter alleged that Bloet gave Rufus £3,000 to intervene on Bloet&#x27;s side when Thomas attempted to assert York&#x27;s claim to Lindsey, but another medieval chronicler, Henry of Huntingdon, who knew Bloet well, said that the sum was £5,000. This payment secured Rufus&#x27; support in the dispute between York and Lincoln, which was settled in Lincoln&#x27;s favour. The sum of £5,000 was extremely large, eight times what &quot;Domesday Book&quot; records as the bishop of Lincoln&#x27;s annual income. The king gave York the abbeys of Selby and St Oswald, Gloucester in return for the settlement in favour of Lincoln. Bloet also refused to profess obedience to Anselm, but when King William intervened on Anselm&#x27;s side, Bloet made the profession to Anselm.

Bloet was one of the chief administrative officers of the kingdom under William II, often associated with Ranulf Flambard, Urse d&#x27;Abetot, and Haimo the dapifer. As a bishop, he moved the newly founded monastery of Stow to Eynsham instead. This church was considered a proprietary church and the bishops of Lincoln retained the right to appoint the abbot and installing the abbot in office. The monks of Stow had been established by his predecessor. Bloet also gave lands to the priory of Bermondsey, which became a Cluniac priory during Rufus&#x27; reign.

Even after becoming a bishop, Bloet continued to witness royal writs, witnessing six of Rufus&#x27; writs while bishop, to add to his 11 witnessed writs during his chancellorship. Bloet was one of the bishops in 1097 that attempted to persuade Anselm when the archbishop was in a dispute with Rufus over travelling to Rome to consult with the papacy. When Anselm refused to be persuaded not to go, the king ordered him to leave the kingdom, with the support of most of the bishops and nobility.

==Under Henry I==
Bloet continued to be an advisor to the king even after Rufus was succeeded by King Henry I, and was a supporter of Henry during the rebellion of 1102. During the rebellion, Bloet was sent by King Henry to besiege Tickhill Castle, which surrendered when the king joined Bloet with a larger army. When the king and Anselm clashed over investiture, the king persuaded Bloet to consecrate a number of the king&#x27;s abbatial appointments in 1102 and 1103. Throughout Henry&#x27;s reign, Bloet continued to be a trusted councillor, and was often trusted with advising the queen when the king was absent from England. Bloet is only recorded as accompanying the king outside England once, in 1114. He served as a royal justice often, being named by Henry of Huntingdon as one of the justices who were not restricted to one or a few counties but who served throughout England. During Henry&#x27;s reign, Bloet witnessed 155 royal documents.

When the new see at Ely was established in 1109 in a former abbey, it was carved out of Bloet&#x27;s diocese who was compensated for the loss by a grant of land. This grant included the town of Spaldwick in Huntingdonshire. He was one of the councillors who urged Henry to appoint William of Corbeil to the archbishopric of Canterbury in 1123, although Bloet died before Corbeil was selected. Bloet was opposed to the other candidates, as they were monks, and he wanted a non-monk appointed at Canterbury. In 1114, when Canterbury was vacant, he had also opposed the appointment of a monk to Canterbury. During the reign of Henry, Bloet accepted the supervision of St Albans abbey, ruled by his relative Richard, when Richard objected to the harshness of the archbishop of Canterbury and switched the abbey&#x27;s obedience to Lincoln instead. Bloet continued to be a benefactor to Albans throughout his episcopate. He doubled the number of canons in the cathedral chapter at Lincoln Cathedral during his episcopate. He also embellished the newly built Lincoln Cathedral and gave the cathedral many gifts of objects and lands. Most of his surviving episcopal documents concern the consecration of churches in his diocese or the confirmation of donations to religious houses. He also founded a hospital in Lincoln dedicated to the Holy Sepulchre.

Henry of Huntingdon, the medieval chronicler, wrote a letter entitled &quot;De contemptu mundi&quot; where he related a story from right before Bloet&#x27;s death that Bloet felt he had fallen from King Henry&#x27;s favour. Bloet allegedly told Huntingdon that the bishop had lost two lawsuits. However, the whole letter is concerned with setting out examples of prominent men who suffered a fall from grace, so possible bias on Huntingdon&#x27;s part must be kept in mind. There are also records of two legal proceedings involving Bloet at the end of Bloet&#x27;s life, and although Bloet lost both cases, neither was a loss of much income or prestige. In one, he was allowed to continue to hold the property, although instead of it being judged as his land alone, the settlement was that Bloet held it of St Augustine&#x27;s Abbey in Canterbury. The other lawsuit involved Bloet&#x27;s attempt to hold a manor free of dues owed to Westminster Abbey, which was settled in the Abbey&#x27;s favour, although Bloet continued to hold the land. Nor is there any lessening of the rate of Bloet&#x27;s witnessing to royal documents. It appears that Bloet&#x27;s lost lawsuits were decided by other royal justices, and while he may have lost some favour with the king, he did not fall completely out of favour either.

==Death and legacy==
Bloet was a married bishop, and he appointed his son Simon as Dean of Lincoln. It was in Bloet&#x27;s household that the medieval historian Henry of Huntingdon was brought up. He died on 10 January 1123 at Woodstock, Oxfordshire and was buried at Lincoln. He had a sudden fit while out riding with King Henry and Roger of Salisbury, the Bishop of Salisbury, and collapsed in the king&#x27;s arms before dying shortly thereafter without absolution, which combined with his style of living led many contemporaries to conclude he was condemned to Hell. His last words were &quot;Lord king, I am dying&quot; which he uttered right before collapsing into Henry&#x27;s arms. His entrails were buried at Eynsham, but the rest of his body was buried in Lincoln Cathedral near the southern entrance in front of St. Mary&#x27;s altar.

Henry of Huntingdon records that noblemen sent their children to be educated at Bloet&#x27;s household, whether or not they were destined for a career in the church. King Henry&#x27;s illegitimate son Robert of Gloucester was educated in Bloet&#x27;s care. Another illegitimate son of Henry&#x27;s, Richard of Lincoln, was also in Bloet&#x27;s household for an education. Gilbert of Sempringham, who founded the Gilbertine Order, was also educated in Bloet&#x27;s household, entering it before Bloet&#x27;s death and continuing there under Bloet&#x27;s successor Alexander of Lincoln. Besides educating laymen, Bloet educated his own household clergy, including sending some of them to study under Ivo, Bishop of Chartres. He was known for his ostentatious manner of living, and served personally in war when needed. The medieval chronicler William of Malmesbury claimed that he hated monks. Henry of Huntingdon, however, remembered him as handsome, cheerful and affable. Earlier in his episcopate, Bloet had aided Christina of Markyate&#x27;s family in their attempts to get the hermit to marry, at one point giving a judicial judgement that she must marry, which she refused to do. It was only after Bloet&#x27;s death that Christina was able to be consecrated as a recluse at St Albans Abbey.

<text>Davisville is a subway station on Line 1 Yonge–University in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located at 1900 Yonge Street, where it intersects with Chaplin Crescent and Davisville Avenue. The station opened in 1954 as part of the original Toronto subway. In 2002, this station became accessible with elevators. 

==Description==

The station is on three levels: the entrances are located on street level, the concourse and collector booths are on the mezzanine (second) level, and the subway platforms are on the lower level.

There are four entrances that connect the station to two buildings in the area:
* three accessible entrances from the TTC head office
* an unstaffed entrance at 1910 Yonge Street, near Chaplin Crescent, which leads directly to the northbound subway platform

An artwork titled &quot;100 Years with the TTC&quot; is displayed at the mezzanine level of the station; it celebrates the 100th anniversary of the TTC. Working with STEPS Public Art, an organization that develops public art installations, artist Rosena Fung designed the work using contributions by 12 school students, the winners of a contest to depict futuristic vehicles.

== Subway infrastructure in the vicinity ==

The station is constructed above ground, but below street level, with separate canopies over each platform. It is adjacent to the Davisville Subway Yard, which is visible from the trains and platforms. The station has a unique semi-active third platform, on the yard side - actually referred to as the &quot;Davisville Buildup&quot; - which can be used by trains entering or leaving the yard on service or as an alternate route if one of the running lines is blocked.

The line continues in open cut in both directions: north as far as the &quot;Berwick Portal&quot;, immediately before Eglinton station; and south as far as the &quot;Muir Portal&quot;, roughly halfway to St. Clair station, from which it continues in tunnel.
== Nearby landmarks ==

Nearby landmarks include the Mount Pleasant Cemetery, the Upper Canada College campus, and the TTC&#x27;s main administrative office building, the William McBrien Building. The station&#x27;s bus platforms are under the western half of the building at street level, and the open-air northbound subway platform abuts against the building&#x27;s west wall.

The former Canadian National Railways Belt Line Railway railway corridor crosses over the subway tracks south of the station. It has been converted into a pedestrian and biking trail, called the Beltline Trail.

<text>Eglinton is a subway station on Line 1 Yonge–University of the Toronto subway. Located on Eglinton Avenue, it is central to the Yonge–Eglinton neighbourhood in Midtown Toronto. Eglinton station is the seventh busiest station of the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC).

Line 5 Eglinton will serve Eglinton station upon completion of the line, which was scheduled for 2024. Eglinton will then become an interchange station for the two lines.

==Description==
===Line 1 station===
The current station is on three levels, with entrances scattered throughout the street level in the surrounding area of Yonge Street and Eglinton Avenue. The concourse, fare gates and bus terminal as well as several shops are on the second level, and the Line 1 platform is on the lower level.

Eglinton station is the only one of the original 1954 subway stations (Eglinton to Union on Line 1) to retain its original vitreous marble wall tiles. The other 1954 subway stations used similar wall tiles with variations in colour schemes, but at the other stations, the tiles were replaced because of deterioration.

The Line 1 tracks approach the station from the south in an open cut before going underground at the Berwick Portal immediately before the station. Here the tracks divide sharply to go either side of the island platform. There is a crossover at this location, from when the station was the terminus of the line to reverse trains. North of the station, the line swings to the east, to run directly under Yonge Street in a bored tunnel.

===Line 5 station===
The Line 5 station structure (under construction) will cross the structure for Line 1 and have 5 levels:
* The street level, with an entrance near the southwest corner of Eglinton Avenue and Yonge Street
* The concourse level of the existing station
* The LRT upper concourse level, which will be slightly lower than the Line 1 platform level, and be split into east and west sections by the Line 1 tracks and platform
* The LRT lower concourse level, which will run under the Line 1 tracks and platform
* The LRT platform level, which will be the deepest level of the station complex upon completion of Line 5
There is a double crossover on the east side of the Line 5 station to reverse trains.

===Bus terminal===
The Eglinton station bus terminal is located at the south side of the station. The terminal&#x27;s platforms and bus loop lie mostly within the building of a former bus garage. There is a station entrance and waiting room at the northeast corner of the bus terminal. From this entrance, passengers can descend to the Line 1 platform, and from the waiting room passengers can walk along a passageway connecting the bus terminal to the main concourse above the Line 1 platforms. Platforms on the south side of the terminal serve eastbound bus routes while those on the northside serve westbound routes. Buses can enter the terminal from either Berwick Avenue or Duplex Avenue.

===Entrances===

There are six entrances to the station in the surrounding area:

====Current====
* An entrance at the southwest corner of Yonge Street and Eglinton Avenue (Canada Square)
* An accessible, automatic entrance at Yonge Street, north of Berwick Avenue, which leads directly to the bus platform level

====Temporarily closed====
The following entrances were temporarily closed to accommodate Line 5 construction at Eglinton station:
* An entrance at the southeast corner of Yonge Street and Eglinton Avenue, at the CIBC
* An entrance on the northwest corner of Yonge Street and Eglinton Avenue
* An entrance at 2300 Yonge Street via the food court level of Yonge Eglinton Centre
* An entrance at the northeast corner of Yonge Street and Eglinton Avenue, at the TD Bank

===Public art===
As part of a program to install artworks at six of the stations along Line 5 Eglinton, Eglinton station will feature an artwork titled &quot;Light from Within&quot; by artists Rodney LaTourelle and Louise Witthoeft. The artwork will be installed above the escalators leading down to the Line 5 platform. The 13-ton panel will be made of mirrored glass tiles and is inspired by minerals, crystals and gemstones evoking the &quot;subterranean nature of rapid transit&quot;, according to the artists.

==Line 5 construction==

Twenty-four weekend closures of Line 1 Yonge–University at Eglinton station were scheduled for 2018 alone for construction activities related to Line 5 Eglinton. The first closure was scheduled for February 10 and 11, 2018.

Structures to be constructed at Eglinton station as part of the Line 5 project are:
* Main entrance to Line 5 to be located just west of the existing, to-be-retained station entrance at the southwest corner of Eglinton Avenue and Yonge Street.
* Replacement entrances at the northwest, northeast and southeast corners of the intersection of Yonge Street and Eglinton Avenue connecting to underground concourses. 
* LRT platforms with rails laid 22 metres below ground.
* Separate Line 5 concourse at a lower level than the Line 1 platform. 
* Northward extension of the existing Line 1 platform providing room for escalator/elevator access down to the Line 5 concourse level.
* Emergency exit and ventilation shaft at 7 Eglinton Avenue East in a four-story structure to also be used as a Salvation Army church.
* Facility services building to be located over the Line 1 portal at Berwick Avenue, which will house a ventilation capable of emergency smoke extraction.

In November 2013, the TTC originally proposed to shift the current Line 1 platform approximately northward of its current location. Such a change would have allowed smoother flows of passenger traffic between the platforms for Lines 1 and 5, and avoided a situation where all transferring passengers are bottlenecked by only one transfer path, similar to the busy Bloor–Yonge station. The pocket track at the north end of the station would have had to be abandoned. However, this proposal was modified by March 2018 to shift the Line 1 platform north by only , allowing the pocket track to be retained. In the new area there will be an elevator and escalators down to the Line 5 concourse. At the south end of the platform, the elevator and stairs to the south station entrance would be retained but the platform edge would be walled off in this area. The northern platform extension opened on May 14, 2023.

==History==
Eglinton station opened in 1954 as the northern terminus of the original Yonge subway line, today a part of Line 1 Yonge–University. In 1954, the Yonge subway ran from Eglinton station to Union station, and replaced the Yonge streetcar line. Eglinton station sits on the site of the former Eglinton Carhouse, a streetcar facility opened in 1922, partly closed in 1951 to construct the subway line, and fully closed in 1954.

When opened in 1954, Eglinton station had a different bus terminal from what exists today. Eglinton&#x27;s first bus terminal was located at the south side of Eglinton Avenue, just north of the current bus terminal. It initially had nine parallel bays within the fare-paid zone, each with a covered platform and staircases leading down to an east–west, underground concourse. There was also a platform 10 outside the fare-paid zone. In 1963, platforms 11–13 were added on the west side of platform 10 to handle increasing suburban traffic. The bus terminal had its own street entrance facing Eglinton Avenue at the north end of platform 10, about 50 metres east of Duplex Avenue.

With its opening in 1954, Eglinton station hosted trolley bus service serving neighbourhoods north of Eglinton Avenue. One bay was for 97 Yonge trolley buses to Glen Echo Loop, and two bays were for 61 Nortown trolley buses with separate bays for eastbound and westbound trips. The Nortown route was U-shaped serving Mount Pleasant Road east of the station, and Avenue Road to the west. The Eglinton garage, at the site of today&#x27;s Eglinton station bus terminal, serviced trolley buses as well as diesel buses.

In 1973, Line 1 was extended to York Mills station and Eglinton station ceased to be a terminal station. Along with the extension, a pocket track was installed on the north side of the station to reverse some Line 1 trains. Also with the extension, Glen Echo Loop was closed and the Yonge trolley bus route was converted to diesel. This left Nortown as the only trolley bus route serving Eglinton station.

In 1991, the Nortown trolley bus route was converted to diesel, ending trolley bus service at Eglinton station.

In 2004, the original bus terminal from 1954 was closed because of safety concerns over its aging infrastructure. A replacement bus terminal was opened in the former bus garage just south of the old bus terminal.

In 2004, this station became accessible with the addition of elevators, and also with the closure of the old bus terminal which had required passengers to use stairs to reach the buses.

In 2016, the original bus terminal from 1954 was demolished to make way for construction of Line 5.

On November 17, 2016, Eglinton became the last station on Line 1 to be Presto enabled.

In October 2021, automatic train control (ATC) was extended to Eglinton station. On May 14, 2023, the northern platform extension on Line 1 opened. ATC had been adjusted the previous day so that trains stopped further north. The southern 24metres of the platform was closed off for passenger boarding and disembarking.

==Nearby landmarks==
There are several high-rise buildings at or near the corner of Yonge Street and Eglinton Avenue. Built directly over the station is the Canada Square Complex, which is home to TVOntario studios and the head offices of Canadian Tire. Yonge Eglinton Centre is at the northwest corner of Yonge and Eglinton. Further south is the residential Minto Midtown. Another nearby destination is Eglinton Park, west of Eglinton station.

<text>Lawrence is a subway station on Line 1 Yonge–University in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located under Yonge Street at Lawrence Avenue, in the Bedford Park, Lawrence Park and Lytton Park neighbourhoods.

==Description==
The station is on four levels, all the entrances to the station are at street level, the concourse and collector level is on the second level, the bus platform is on the third level, and the subway platform is on the lower level. Both the subway and bus levels have a centre platform.

Out of view from customers, there is an attic extending above and along the length of the subway platform. The attic contains ventilation equipment, a TTC substation and a city sewer pipe. There is a double crossover just south of the subway platforms.
There are four entrances to the station located in the surrounding area:
* Entrance on Lawrence Avenue, west of Yonge Street, leading to the south-side mezzanine level
* Entrance on Lawrence Avenue, east of Yonge Street, leading to the south-side mezzanine level
* Entrance via sidewalk staircase at Bedford Park Avenue, leading to the north-side mezzanine level
* Entrance via sidewalk staircase at Ranleigh Avenue, leading to the north-side mezzanine level

The south-side mezzanine leads down to the bus and subway levels. The unstaffed north-side mezzanine leads directly to the subway level.

==History==
Lawrence station was opened in 1973 as an intermediate stop between , the former northern terminus of the Yonge line, and , which acted as a temporary terminus for a year until the subway was further extended to . Lawrence station is one of the deepest stations on the subway system, as it provides a transition in depth between Eglinton station and York Mills station in the Hoggs Hollow valley. It was constructed using the cut-and-cover method down to the platform level. Lawrence was the first station in the network to feature an underground bus terminal.

On April 23, 2007, TTC employee Antonio Almeida was killed in the tunnel just south of the station when a platform on his work car was dislodged.

In 2012, a series of renovations repaired the deteriorating concrete of the bus roadway and tunnel walls. Between the fourth quarter of 2012 and mid-2015, four high-capacity fire ventilation fans were installed at the station.

In 2015, the owner of the building at 3080 Yonge Street (at the northwest corner of Lawrence Street West) proposed to incorporate the TTC entrance at that corner into a renovation project for the building. The old TTC entrance building would be demolished; the renovated building would incorporate a new TTC entrance at ground level. The TTC requested that there be provision for an elevator. These renovations were carried out, and the renovated TTC entrance was opened.

==Future==
By mid-2022, work had begun to make Lawrence station accessible. Two elevators will be added, one from street level to the concourse level and a second from the concourse to the bus and subway levels. A new stairway will be added from the concourse to the subway platform. Signage and wayfinding will be improved throughout the station. The station will have a fifth entrance to house the elevator from street level to the concourse; it will be located on the north side of a Tim Hortons outlet, a few doors north of the existing entrance at the northwest corner of Yonge Street and Lawrence Avenue. The project requires partial closures within the station. In November 2023, the underground bus terminal was closed, resulting in the diversion of buses from Lawrence Avenue West to Eglinton station via Avenue Road, and buses from Lawrence Avenue East to the Roe Loop at Roe Avenue and Avenue Road. In July 2024, the main entrances at the south side of the station were closed limiting station access to the northern secondary entrances. , project completion is expected in mid-2025.

==Nearby landmarks==
* Parks that run through Chatsworth and Blythwood ravines from Chatsworth Drive and Cheritan Avenue to Bayview Avenue.
* Alexander Muir Memorial Gardens
* Toronto Public Library Locke Branch
*Lawrence Park Collegiate Institute

== Surface connections ==

Buses enter the station counter to the normal traffic directions so that bus doors will face the centre bus platform.

TTC routes serving the station include:
==George Milbrandt Parkette==
George Milbrandt Parkette is located at the northeast corner of Yonge Street and Lawrence Avenue East, and shares the small rectangular plot of land with the Lawrence station entrance at that location. At the request of George Milbrandt, acting on behalf of the Bedford Park Residents&#x27; Association, the Toronto City Council created the park in 1998. In 1999, the City named the parkette after Milbrandt, who had promoted the parkette&#x27;s creation for 25 years. The parkette has simple landscaping including shade trees, park benches, grading and grass.

<text>York Mills is a subway station on Line 1 Yonge–University in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located at 4015 Yonge Street at the intersection of Wilson Avenue and York Mills Road in the neighbourhood of Hoggs Hollow.

== History ==

The station opened in 1973, in what was then the Borough of North York, and replaced as the northern terminus of the Yonge line. One year later, the subway was extended to .

The original bus terminal was above ground, in a standard island configuration surrounded by bus bays, and at that time was also used by GO Transit buses, with transfers required for connecting TTC buses.

The current underground TTC bus platforms and GO Bus Terminal were built between 1985 and 1992 with the development of the York Mills Centre, with the TTC platforms inside the fare-paid area.

In 2007, this station became accessible with elevators.

By 2015, the tiles on the walls, floors and stairs had been replaced at this station. On the outer walls at track level the alternating light and dark green tiles were replaced by very light green metal panels with a dark green accent strip along the top. Moreover, in 2015 the station&#x27;s 263 space commuter parking lot was sold to developers.

== Entrances ==
*Northwest corner of Wilson and Yonge – street level entrance
*Northeast corner of York Mills and Yonge – entrance via York Mills Centre
*Old York Mills Road east of Yonge – Kiss and Ride, automatic entrance (accessible only by Presto card as of February 2018)

The construction of a mixed-use development at the northwest corner of Wilson Avenue and Yonge Street requires the demolition of the subway station entrance at that corner. , the TTC is planning a new accessible entrance to be built within the new development. The expected completion is in 2025.

== Art ==

A tapestry called &quot;Breaking Ground&quot; by artist Laurie Swim was installed in the station in 2010 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of an accident that took place in Hoggs Hollow. On March 17, 1960, the incident popularly known as the &quot;Hoggs Hollow Disaster&quot; occurred. Five young Italian immigrant workers were killed while constructing a tunnel for a water main. The details of the accident, where they were trapped 35 feet underground in a cramped, dimly lit tunnel, sparked a public outcry over the lack of safety standards in construction and ultimately led to an improvement in working conditions in Ontario.

== Subway infrastructure in the vicinity ==
The line passes under the Don River West Branch just south of the station platforms. The original plan was for an elevated station and a high-level bridge over the river, but local residents objected and the underground layout was substituted. Consequently, trains approach the station from both directions on a steep downgrade.

<doc id="1304376" wikidata="Q4798035" url="?curid=1304376" title="Arthur Blomfield">
<text>Sir Arthur William Blomfield (6 March 182930 October 1899) was an English architect. He became president of the Architectural Association in 1861; a Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1867 and vice-president of the RIBA in 1886. He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied Architecture.

==Background==
He was the ninth son of Charles James Blomfield, Anglican Bishop of London, who began a programme of new church construction in the capital. Born in Fulham Palace, Arthur Blomfield was educated at Rugby and Trinity College, Cambridge. He was then articled as an architect to Philip Charles Hardwick, and subsequently obtained a large practice on his own account.

The young Thomas Hardy joined Blomfield&#x27;s practice as assistant architect in April 1862, and the writer remained friends with Blomfield. He became president of the Architectural Association in 1861; a Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1867 (proposed by George Gilbert Scott, H. Brandon and J. P. Seddon); and vice-president of the RIBA in 1886. In 1889, he was knighted. He was awarded the Royal Gold Medal in 1891.

He was twice married. His first wife was Caroline Harriet Smith (1840–1882) and his second wife, Lady Blomfield, was an author and humanitarian. Two of his daughters, Mary Esther and Ellinor Blomfield, were supporters of the suffragette movement and famously made a representation to the King. Two of his sons, Charles James and Arthur Conran Blomfield, were brought up to his own profession, and of which they became distinguished representatives. His nephew, Sir Reginald Blomfield, apprenticed under him, went on to design numerous buildings, public works, and sculpture, including the Cross of Sacrifice or War Cross, for the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. These are in Commonwealth cemeteries in many countries.

He died at the Royal Society in London on 30 October 1899 aged 70 and was buried on 3 November in Broadway, Worcestershire, where he lived at Springfield House.

==Major works==

Blomfield designed St Peter&#x27;s in Eastgate in 1870 as a replacement for a medieval church. The church as it now stands is the combined work of three eminent architects: nave and chancel by Blomfield, south aisle by Temple Moore (1914) and the chancel decoration by George Frederick Bodley (1884).
In 1882 Blomfield designed the Royal College of Music in London. In 1887 he became architect to the Bank of England and, in association with Arthur Edmund Street, designed the Law Courts branch of the Bank of England in Fleet Street. A. E. Street was the son of the architect G. E. Street.

In 1890–7 he rebuilt the nave of St Saviour&#x27;s parish church, Southwark (now Southwark Cathedral), replacing an earlier reconstruction of 1839–40. It is a notable example of his use of a Gothic Revival style. He was highly regarded as a restorer; a spokesman for the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings said of his 1898 restoration of Salisbury Cathedral spire &quot;conducted in the most conservative way possible ... I am confident that anyone who had been privileged to see the work that is being done ... would not withhold his subscriptions even though he was as ardent an anti-restorer as your obedient servant.&quot;

In 1899 he completed St George&#x27;s Anglican Cathedral in Georgetown, Guyana, which was the tallest wooden church in the world until 2003 when the Peri Monastery near Săpânţa in northern Romania was completed.

<doc id="1304378" wikidata="Q1756682" url="?curid=1304378" title="Lactiplantibacillus plantarum">
<text>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (formerly &quot;Lactobacillus arabinosus&quot; and &quot;Lactobacillus plantarum&quot;) is a widespread member of the genus &quot;Lactiplantibacillus&quot; and commonly found in many fermented food products as well as anaerobic plant matter. &quot;L. plantarum&quot; was first isolated from saliva. Based on its ability to temporarily persist in plants, the insect intestine and in the intestinal tract of vertebrate animals, it was designated as a nomadic organism. &quot;L. plantarum&quot; is Gram positive, bacilli shaped bacterium. &quot;L. plantarum&quot; cells are rods with rounded ends, straight, generally 0.9–1.2 μm wide and 3–8 μm long, occurring singly, in pairs or in short chains. &quot;L. plantarum&quot; has one of the largest genomes known among the lactic acid bacteria and is a very flexible and versatile species. It is estimated to grow between pH 3.4 and 8.8. &quot;Lactiplantibacillus plantarum&quot; can grow in the temperature range 12 °C to 40 °C. The viable counts of the &quot;L. plantarum&quot; stored at refrigerated condition (4 °C) remained high, while a considerable reduction in the counts was observed stored at room temperature (25 ± 1 °C).

== Metabolism ==
&quot;Lactiplantibacillus plantarum&quot; are homofermentative, aerotolerant Gram-positive bacteria that grow at , but not at , and produce both isomers of lactic acid (D and L). Many lactobacilli including &quot;L. plantarum&quot; are unusual in that they can respire oxygen and express cytochromes if heme and menaquinone are present in the growth medium. In the absence of heme and menaquinone, oxygen is consumed by NADH-peroxidase with hydrogen peroxide as intermediate and water as end product. The peroxide, it is presumed, acts as a weapon to exclude competing bacteria from the food source. In place of the protective enzyme superoxide dismutase present in almost all other oxygen-tolerant cells, this organism accumulates millimolar quantities of manganese polyphosphate. Manganese is also used by &quot;L. plantarum&quot; in a pseudo-catalase to lower reactive oxygen levels. Because the chemistry by which manganese complexes protect the cells from oxygen damage is subverted by iron, these cells contain virtually no iron atoms; in contrast, a cell of &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; of comparable volume contains over one-million iron atoms. Because of this, &quot;L. plantarum&quot; cannot be used to create active enzymes that require a heme complex, such as true catalases.

&quot;L. plantarum&quot; can also reduce insoluble terminal electron acceptors, such as iron oxides or solid electrodes through extracellular electron transfer when riboflavin and quinone (such as 1 4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid, DHNA) are present. &quot;L. plantarum&quot; uses extracellular electron transfer to increase the NAD+/NADH ratio, accelerate fermentation, generate more ATP through the substrate-level phosphorylation, and accumulate more biomass.

&quot;Lactiplantibacillus plantarum&quot;, like many lactobacilli, can be cultured using MRS media.

==Genomes==
The genome sequencing of the lactic acid bacterium &quot;L. plantarum&quot; WCFS1 shows more molecular details. The chromosome contains 3,308,274 base pairs. The GC content of &quot;L. plantarum&quot; is 44.45% with the average protein count 3063. According to the experiment from Wageningen Centre for Food Sciences, the rRNA number of &quot;L. plantarum&quot; WCFS1 is 15, and the number or tRNA is 70.

==Products==

===Silage===
&quot;Lactiplantibacillus plantarum&quot; is the most common bacterium used in silage inoculants. During the anaerobic conditions of ensilage, these organisms quickly dominate the microbial population, and, within 48 hours, they begin to produce lactic and acetic acids via the Embden-Meyerhof Pathway, further diminishing their competition. Under these conditions, &quot;L. plantarum&quot; strains producing high levels of heterologous proteins have been found to remain highly competitive. This quality could allow this species to be utilized as an effective biological pretreatment for lignocellulosic biomass.

===Food products===
&quot;Lactiplantibacillus plantarum&quot; is commonly found in milk products, meat and a lot of vegetable fermentations including sauerkraut, pickles, brined olives, kimchi, Ogi, sourdough, and other fermented plant material, and also some cheeses, fermented sausages, and stockfish. The high levels of this organism in food also makes it an ideal candidate for the development of probiotics. In a 2008 study by Juana Frias et al., &quot;L. plantarum&quot; was applied to reduce the allergenicity of soy flour. The result showed that, compared to other microbes, &quot;L. plantarum&quot;-fermented soy flour showed the highest reduction in IgE immunoreactivity (96–99%), depending upon the sensitivity of the plasma used. &quot;L. plantarum&quot; is also found in dadiah, a traditional fermented buffalo milk of the Minangkabau people, native to Sumatra.

&quot;Lactobacillus plantarum&quot; strain K21 is a gram-positive bacteria isolated from fermented vegetables. It has the ability to hydrolyze bile salt when it is provided as a supplement. In fat mice, K21 also reduces the levels of cholesterol and triglyceride, and inhibits the accumulation of lipid in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes.
Furthermore, it reduces the level of plasma leptin, mitigates liver damage and alleviates glucose intolerance. Finally K21 inhibits body weight gain and fat mass accumulation.

===Therapeutics===
Because it is abundant, of human origin, and easy to grow, &quot;L. plantarum&quot; has been tested for health effects. It has been identified as a probiotic, which suggests its value for further research and application. &quot;L. plantarum&quot; has significant antioxidant activities and also helps to maintain intestinal permeability. It is able to suppress the growth of gas-producing bacteria in the intestines and may benefit some patients who suffer from IBS. It helps to create microbe balance and stabilize digestive enzyme patterns. &quot;Lactiplantibacillus plantarum&quot; has been found in experiments to increase hippocampal brain derived neurotrophic factor, which means &quot;L. plantarum&quot; may have a beneficial role in the treatment of depression. The ability of &quot;L. plantarum&quot; to survive in the human gastro-intestinal tract makes it a possible &quot;in vivo&quot; delivery vehicle for therapeutic compounds or proteins.

&quot;Lactiplantibacillus plantarum&quot; is a constituent in VSL#3. This proprietary, standardized formulation of live bacteria may be used in combination with conventional therapies to treat ulcerative colitis and requires a prescription.

=== Antimicrobial property ===
The ability of &quot;L. plantarum&quot; to produce antimicrobial substances helps them survive in the gastrointestinal tract of humans. The antimicrobial substances produced have shown significant effect on Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.

=== Activity against AIDS-defining illnesses ===
As a result of initial HIV infection, the gut has been found to be a prime center of immune activity. The immune systems&#x27; Paneth cells of the gut attack HIV by producing interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), which results in extensive collateral damage—sloughing of tight intestinal lining, witnessed as severe diarrhea. This destruction of the gut lining allows fungal pathogens to invade, e.g., &quot;Cryptococcus&quot; species, resulting in an AIDS-defining illness such as cryptococcosis, representing 60% to 70% of all AIDS-defining cases, but not necessarily only the gut. In rhesus macaques, &quot;L. plantarum&quot; is able to reduce (destroy) IL-1β, resolving inflammation, and accelerating gut repair within hours.

== Biochemistry ==
The entire genome has recently been sequenced, and promoter libraries have been developed for both conditional and constitutive gene expression, adding to the utility of &quot;L. plantarum&quot;. It is also commonly employed as the indicative organism in niacin bioassay experiments, in particular, AOAC International Official Method 944.13, as it is a niacin auxotroph.

<doc id="1304380" wikidata="Q1277260" url="?curid=1304380" title="Earl of Dunbar">
<text>The title Earl of Dunbar, also called Earl of Lothian or Earl of March, applied to the head of a comital lordship in south-eastern Scotland between the early 12th century and the early 15th century. The first man to use the title of Earl in this capacity was Gospatric II, Earl of Lothian, son of Gospatric, Earl of Northumbria. It descended to George de Dunbar, 11th Earl of March, whose titles &amp; estates were declared forfeit by the Scottish parliament in 1435, and retired into obscurity in England. His son Patrick retained a barony at Kilconquhar in Fife.

The title of Earl of Dunbar was revived in 1605 for George Home, 1st Lord Hume of Berwick, Chancellor of the Exchequer, and &quot;his heirs male&quot;. This title became dormant only six years after its creation, upon Home&#x27;s death in 1611. Some of his kinsmen were said to be acknowledged as &quot;de jure&quot; holders of the title, but none of them ever appears to have assumed the title. 

There have been no subsequent creations; however, two other peerages with similar names are Lord of Dunbar and Viscount of Dunbar.

==First creation==

===Using title &quot;Earl of Lothian&quot;===
*Gospatric II, Earl of Lothian (died 1138)
*Gospatric III, Earl of Lothian (died 1166)

===Using title &quot;Earl of Dunbar&quot;===
*Waltheof, Earl of Dunbar (died 1182)
*Patrick I, Earl of Dunbar (1154–1232)
*Patrick II, Earl of Dunbar (1186–1249)
*Patrick III, Earl of Dunbar (1213–1289)

===Using mainly the title &quot;Earl of March&quot;===
*Patrick IV, Earl of March (1242–1308)
*Patrick V, Earl of March (1284–1368)
*George I, Earl of March (1340–1422)
*George II, Earl of March (c. 1370–1457)

==Earls of Dunbar, Second Creation (1605)==

*George Home, 1st Earl of Dunbar (c.1556–1611) – died without male issue

Subsequent claimants to the title

*John Home, &quot;de jure&quot; 2nd Earl of Dunbar (a 1628), brother of 1st Earl, according to the Lord Advocate in 1634, he “conceiving his fortune too mean, forebore to assume the dignity”. He died without male issue.
*George Home, &quot;de jure&quot; 3rd Earl of Dunbar (a 1637), son of Alexander Home of Manderston and nephew of 1st Earl, certified in his claim in 1634 by the same Lord Advocate.
*Alexander Home, &quot;de jure&quot; 4th Earl of Dunbar (d. 1675), son of 3rd Earl, said to have been confirmed in title by Charles II in 1651 but which does not appear in the &quot;Great Seal of Scotland&quot;. Died without male issue.
*Alexander Hume, of Manderstone, &quot;de jure&quot; 5th Earl of Dunbar (b. 1651, d. 4 January 1720 Aurich, Germany), nephew of 4th Earl. Capt. of a troop of horse in the service of the States of Holland, later &quot;Geheimrat&quot; in Aurich, Germany. To him 14 October 1689, William III, King of England, Ireland and Scotland confirmed the Earldom of Dunbar exemplifying the previous confirmation thereof by Charles II. It is not known if Alexander Hume styled himself &quot;Earl of Dunbar&quot; in Germany, where he and his descendants rather are known as &quot;Grafen (Counts) Hume of Manderstone&quot;. He married the daughter of Leonard Fewen, General Steward of Emden, who inherited the manor house and estate of Stikelkamp at Hesel, East Frisia. His son—Leonard Hume (1684–1741), &quot;de jure&quot; 6th Earl of Dunbar—inherited the estate in Stikelkamp from his father. Leonard married Gesina Bruncken (1701–1763). A son of Leonard—Heere Andries Hume—was &quot;de jure&quot; the 7th Earl of Dunbar (b. 1738 in Norden). Leonard&#x27;s daughter Helena Hume of Manderstone (1722–1784) inherited the estate of Stikelkamp; she married Bebäus Scato Kettwig; their daughter Isabella (1742–1797) married Eger Carl Christian Lantzius-Beninga (1744–1798); the Lantzius-Beninga family owned the Stikelkamp estate until 1971, when it was purchased by the Landkreis Leer. Note: No claimant has progressed his claim before the House of Lords Committee for Privileges to a satisfactory conclusion. This Committee was—until the Dissolution of Parliament on 12 April 2010—the only body which was authorised to decide whether or not a claimant may be confirmed in the title. The Lord Advocate of Scotland, for instance, has no authority in these matters, especially in the 17th century, given the corruption and nepotism rampant at that time. The usual way to establish the right to inherit a title is to apply for a Writ of Summons to attend Parliament (a procedure that will have to be reviewed in the light of new legislation abolishing the hereditary parliamentary rights of peers). Then the Committee for Privileges examines the validity of the documentation supporting the line of descent of the claimant and his relationship to the previous holder of the peerage title. Currently, there are several authorities who theoretically could recognize the use of the title &quot;Earl of Dunbar&quot;, issued by William III.

In 1721 James Murray (c.1690–1770), second son of David Murray, 5th Viscount of Stormont, was created Earl of Dunbar, Viscount of Drumcairn and Lord of Hadykes in the Jacobite Peerage by James Francis Edward Stuart, the &quot;Old Pretender&quot;. These creations were never recognised by the British government.

In 1776, John Home, descended from David, second son of Sir David Home of Wedderburn, appears to have had the title&#x27;s privileges upheld for him (given &quot;retour&quot;) as heir male of the Earl of Dunbar, but the service was reduced by the Court of Session, at the instance of Sir George Home of Blackadder, Bt., a descendant of Sir David through an immediate younger brother of Alexander Home, the first of Manderston (grandfather of George, 1st Earl).

In 1810 Sir John Home of Renton, Bt., served notice that he was preparing a case to lay before The House &quot;to the title, honour, and dignity of Earl of Dunbar, as heir male to the first patentee&quot;. He appears not to have pursued the case to a conclusion.

During the 19th century Mr Home Drummond of Blair Drummond, Perthshire, as descended from, and heir male of, Patrick Home of Renton, uncle of George, 1st Earl of Dunbar, also had a claim to that peerage.

<doc id="1304381" wikidata="Q1041444" url="?curid=1304381" title="Sheppard–Yonge station">
<text>Sheppard–Yonge (formerly Sheppard) is an interchange station on Line 1 Yonge–University and Line 4 Sheppard of the Toronto subway. The station is located at the southern end of North York City Centre. It is the fourth-busiest station in the system, after , and , serving a combined total of approximately people per day in .

==History==
Sheppard–Yonge first opened as Sheppard in 1974, when the Yonge–University subway line was extended north from to . The extension was planned to open in two stages with Sheppard as the temporary terminus, but construction north of was delayed by various problems and in 1973, York Mills was opened as the temporary terminus instead; Sheppard and Finch stations opened in 1974. The H-2 class subway cars delivered in 1971 included destination signs for &quot;Sheppard via downtown&quot; on the expectation that it would be a terminal station.

The station was expanded and renamed &quot;Sheppard–Yonge&quot; in 2002 with the opening of the Sheppard subway line, for which this station became the western terminus. The renaming was similar to that of Bloor–Yonge station. Unlike Bloor–Yonge, where the signs on Line 1 platforms still read &quot;Bloor&quot; and those on the Line 2 Bloor–Danforth read &quot;Yonge&quot;, Sheppard–Yonge is given its full name on both sets of platforms; all existing signs within the station were changed to give the new name. At that time, this station became accessible with elevators. When the automated announcements were installed on Toronto&#x27;s subway trains, Line 1 trains referred to the station as &quot;Sheppard&quot; while Line 4 trains referred to the station as &quot;Sheppard–Yonge&quot;, the new Toronto Rocket subway trains refer to the station on both Lines 1 and 4 as &quot;Sheppard–Yonge&quot; followed by &quot;Change for Line 1/4&quot; respectively.

==Station description==
The station is located under Yonge Street at Sheppard Avenue, and is built on five levels. All seven entrances are located at street level, as is the bus platform. The three levels below are concourse levels, which provide access to the bus platform and the two subway lines. The subway platforms are on the two lower levels, with the Yonge–University line on the bottom and the newer Sheppard line crossing above.

==Entrances==
There are six entrances – five automated entrances (all of which are only accessible by Presto card) and one staffed entrance:

==Architecture and art==
The station on the Sheppard line was designed by architectural firm NORR Limited. The construction of the Sheppard line included the integration of the bus terminal at street level into the fare-paid zone.

The artwork in the station, entitled &quot;Immersion Land&quot; and created by the artist Stacey Spiegel, consists of panoramic posterized murals created from 150 digital photos rendered onto single-colour mosaic tiles. The artwork depicts rural scenery along Yonge Street or Highway 11 somewhere between Lake Ontario and North Bay, and is located on the upper (Line 4 Sheppard) platform level.

==Subway infrastructure in the vicinity==

The Sheppard line tracks cross above the Yonge line. Line 4 has side platforms (unique among TTC terminal stations), but there is also a roughed-in centre platform. Should the station become a busy transfer point, this platform will be opened and trains will open all their doors, allowing riders to enter on one side and exit on the other to improve efficiency.

Both lines have a crossover just beyond the platforms, with Line 1&#x27;s being to the south and Line 4&#x27;s to the east. As Sheppard-Yonge is a terminus for Line 4, its crossover is used to regularly reverse trains, with Line 1&#x27;s being used only for occasional short turns. Trains normally pull into the south platform on Line 4 to allow passengers to board and alight before returning in the direction from which they came; the north platform is used only for passengers disembarking from trains that are going out of service.

A connecting track from the southbound Line 1 track south of the station, used only if non-revenue trains or work cars need to be transferred between the two lines, curves around to a point west of Yonge on Line 4&#x27;s single tail track, slightly more than one train-length east of the end of the track, with a second (which becomes the eastbound track) diverging from the connector, which passes under it. This provides an area where trains can be stored clear of the line. East of the station, Line 4 converges with a second connecting track from northbound Line 1.

<doc id="1304415" wikidata="Q66262" url="?curid=1304415" title="Max Gerson">
<text>Max Gerson (October 18, 1881 – March 8, 1959) was a German-born American physician who developed the Gerson therapy, a pseudoscientific dietary-based alternative cancer treatment that he falsely claimed could cure cancer and most chronic, degenerative diseases. Gerson therapy involves a plant-based diet with coffee enemas, ozone enemas, dietary supplements, and raw calf liver extract; the latter was discontinued in the 1980s after patients were hospitalized for bacterial infections.

Gerson described his approach in the book &quot;A Cancer Therapy: Results of 50 Cases&quot; (1958). The National Cancer Institute evaluated Gerson&#x27;s claims and concluded that his data showed no benefit from his treatment. The therapy is both ineffective and dangerous. Serious illness and deaths have resulted from Gerson therapy.

==Early life and career==
Gerson was born to a Jewish family in Wongrowitz, German Empire (Wągrowiec, now in Poland), on October 18, 1881. In 1909, he graduated from the Albert Ludwig University of Freiburg. He began practicing medicine at age 28 in Breslau (Wrocław, now in Poland), later specializing in internal medicine and nerve diseases in Bielefeld. By 1927, he was specializing in the treatment of tuberculosis, developing the Gerson-Sauerbruch-Hermannsdorfer diet, claiming it was a major advance in the treatment of tuberculosis. Initially, he used his therapy as a supposed treatment for migraine headaches and tuberculosis. In 1928, he began to use it as a claimed treatment for cancer. When the Nazis came to power in 1933 Gerson left Germany, emigrating to Vienna, where he worked in the West End Sanatorium. Gerson spent two years in Vienna, before moving to France in 1935, associating with a clinic near Paris before moving to London in 1936. Shortly thereafter, he moved to the United States, settling in New York City.

==In the United States==
Gerson emigrated to the United States in 1936, passed his medical board examination, and became a U.S. citizen in 1942. In the U.S., Gerson applied his dietary therapy to several cancer patients, claiming good results, but other workers found his methodology and claims unconvincing. Proponents of Gerson therapy believe a conspiracy headed by the medical establishment prevented Gerson from publishing proof that his therapy worked. In 1958, Gerson published a book in which he claimed to have cured 50 terminal cancer patients: &quot;A Cancer Therapy: Results of 50 Cases&quot;. In 1953, Gerson&#x27;s malpractice insurance was discontinued and, in 1958, his medical license in New York was suspended for two years.

===Death===
Gerson died on March 8, 1959, of pneumonia. A conspiracy theory has subsequently spread that Gerson was murdered following a lifetime of supposed persecution.

==Gerson therapy==
Initially, Gerson used his therapy as a treatment for migraine headaches and tuberculosis. In 1928, he began to use it as a supposed treatment for cancer.

Gerson therapy is based on the belief that cancer is the result of a deteriorating metabolism from an impaired liver function. Gerson therapy aims to restore the body to health by repairing the liver and return metabolism to its normal state. The therapy promotes the idea that cancer is caused by alteration of cell metabolism by processed food and toxic environmental substances which alter its sodium and potassium content. It also emphasizes limiting sodium and increasing potassium intake to detoxify the liver. Coffee enemas are said to cause excretion of toxic breakdown products by the liver and through the colon wall. None of these ideas are supported by scientific research. Gerson commented that his therapy aimed to create a &quot;near normal condition of the oxidizing system in the body, to which malignant cells with the fermentation system cannot adapt&quot;. 

Gerson therapy claims to treat the disease by having patients consume a plant-based diet including hourly glasses of vegetable juice, raw calf&#x27;s liver extracts and various dietary supplements. Meals are restricted to baked potatoes, oatmeal, salad, cooked and raw vegetables and fruits. Meat and dairy is excluded and only introduced in small amounts back into the diet after 4 or 6 weeks. Berries, nuts, salt, vegetable oils and drinking water are forbidden indefinitely. All canned, frozen and refined foods are excluded and a special grinder and press is required for juicing.

In addition, patients receive enemas of coffee, castor oil and hydrogen peroxide or ozone. Since 1983, Gerson therapy has involved the use of ozone enemas, where up to 150mg of ozone is administered rectally.

After Gerson&#x27;s death, his daughter Charlotte Gerson (March 25, 1922 - February 10, 2019) continued to promote the therapy, founding the &quot;Gerson Institute&quot; in 1977. The original protocol also included raw calf&#x27;s liver taken orally, but this practice was discontinued in the 1980s after ten patients were hospitalized (five of them comatose) from January 1979 to March 1981 in San Diego, California, area hospitals due to infection with the rare bacterium &quot;Campylobacter fetus.&quot; This infection was seen only in those following Gerson-type therapy with raw liver (no other cases of patients having sepsis with this microbe, a pathogen in cattle, had been reported to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the previous two years). Nine of ten hospitalized patients had been treated in Tijuana, Mexico; the tenth followed Gerson therapy at home. One of these patients who had metastatic melanoma died within a week of his septic episode. Many of the patients had low sodium levels, thought to be associated with the very low sodium Gerson diet. The photographer Garry Winogrand died of gallbladder cancer in a Gerson Clinic in Tijuana.

===Evidence===
Gerson&#x27;s therapy has not been independently tested or subjected to randomized controlled trials, and thus is illegal to market in the United States. The Gerson Institute promotes the therapy by citing patient testimonials and other anecdotal evidence. Gerson published a book discussing the alleged success of the therapy in 50 patients, but a review by the U.S. National Cancer Institute was unable to find any evidence that Gerson&#x27;s claims were accurate. The NCI found that no &quot;in vivo&quot; animal studies had been conducted. Similarly, case series by Gerson Institute staff published in the alternative medical literature suffered from methodological flaws, and no independent entity has been able to reproduce the claims.

Attempts to independently check the results of the therapy have been negative. A group of 13 patients sickened by elements of the Gerson therapy were evaluated in hospitals in San Diego in the early 1980s; all 13 were found to still have active cancer. An investigation by Quackwatch found that the institute&#x27;s claims of cure were based not on actual documentation of survival, but on &quot;a combination of the doctor&#x27;s estimate that the departing patient has a &#x27;reasonable chance of surviving&#x27;, plus feelings that the Institute staff have about the status of people who call in&quot;.

The American Cancer Society reported that &quot;[t]here is no reliable scientific evidence that Gerson therapy is effective in treating cancer, and the principles behind it are not widely accepted by the medical community. It is not approved for use in the United States.&quot; In 1947, the National Cancer Institute reviewed 10 claimed cures submitted by Gerson; however, all of the patients were receiving standard anticancer treatment simultaneously, making it impossible to determine what effect, if any, was due to Gerson&#x27;s therapy. A review of the Gerson therapy by Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center concluded: &quot;If proponents of such therapies wish them to be evaluated scientifically and considered valid adjuvant treatments, they must provide extensive records (more than simple survival rates) and conduct controlled, prospective studies as evidence&quot;. In 1959, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) again reviewed cases of patients treated by Gerson. The NCI found that the available information did not prove the regimen had benefit. Cancer Research UK states that &quot;Available scientific evidence does not support any claims that Gerson therapy can treat cancer [...] Gerson therapy can be very harmful to your health.&quot;

===Safety concerns===

Gerson therapy can lead to several significant health problems. Serious illness and death have occurred as a direct result of some portions of the treatment, including severe electrolyte imbalances. Proponents of the therapy advise ceasing conventional cancer treatment, and this further risks causing harm.

Continued use of enemas may weaken the colon&#x27;s normal function, causing or worsening constipation and colitis. Other complications have included dehydration, serious infections and severe bleeding. 

The therapy is not recommended for pregnant or breast-feeding women and certain cancers and illnesses.

Coffee enemas have contributed to the deaths of at least three people in the United States. Coffee enemas &quot;can cause colitis (inflammation of the bowel), fluid and electrolyte imbalances, and in some cases septicemia&quot;. The recommended diet may not be nutritionally adequate. The diet has been blamed for the deaths of patients who substituted it for standard medical care.

Jessica Ainscough, better known as &quot;The Wellness Warrior&quot;, was a major proponent of the Gerson diet after her diagnosis with cancer. She rejected medical treatment and followed the diet strictly, documenting her progress in a popular blog. She died from her untreated cancer in February 2015, aged 29.

<doc id="1304423" wikidata="Q773799" url="?curid=1304423" title="North York Centre station">
<text>North York Centre is a subway station on Line 1 Yonge–University of the Toronto subway system. The station is located under Yonge Street, where it is intersected by Park Home Avenue and Empress Avenue. The station, the system&#x27;s first and only infill station, opened in 1987 to serve North York City Centre, a high density business district in the Willowdale neighbourhood.

==History==
North York Centre opened in 1987 in what was then the City of North York as an infill station of the Yonge–University line.

This station was added by excavating alongside the existing tracks, on a level section of route provided for this purpose when the line was built. The view across the tracks between platforms is not as open as most stations, as the solid concrete wall had to retain its load-bearing strength, and smaller openings were cut.

In late 2007 the TTC began work to make the station accessible to those with limited mobility, and in November 2009 the work was completed. Two elevators were installed to take passengers from mezzanine level to the subway platforms. Persons in wheelchairs or with other mobility restrictions are now able to enter from street level by way of existing facilities in the major buildings on both sides of the station.

==Public art==
Artwork in the station consists of &quot;North York Heritage Murals&quot; by North York artists Nicholas and Susana Graven, located at the platform level. The two murals, each made of over 5000 pieces of glazed ceramic tiles using a process invented by Artessa Studios of North York, depict scenes of North York in the 19th century in an abstract way and are titled:
*&quot;Top of the North Hill—1850s&quot; on the northbound platform (surtitled with the historic place names &quot;Don Mills, Flynntown, L&#x27;Amoreaux, Lansing, Milneford, Newtonbrook, Oriole, O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s Corners, Willowdale&quot;), and
*&quot;Traffic at Yonge and Sheppard—1860s&quot; on the southbound platform (surtitled with the historic place names &quot;Downsview, Dublin, Eglinton, Elia, Emery, Fairbank, Fisherville, Humber Summit, Kaiserville, York Mills, Weston&quot;).
The historic place names shown above each of the murals are names of historic communities near an imaginary line from the northwest to the southeast through the historic Lansing.

== Nearby landmarks ==

Direct underground level connection from the station are: on the east side with the Empress Walk shopping, entertainment and residential complex; and on the west side with City Centre, which includes commercial office and retail space as well as a cluster of City of Toronto facilities that include Mel Lastman Square, North York Civic Centre, North York Central Library and Douglas Snow Aquatic Centre. Other nearby landmarks include Earl Haig Secondary School, Gibson House, Meridian Arts Centre and York Cemetery.

<doc id="1304433" wikidata="Q1713499" url="?curid=1304433" title="Megaesophagus">
<text>Megaesophagus, also known as esophageal dilatation, is a disorder of the esophagus in humans and other mammals, whereby the esophagus becomes abnormally enlarged. Megaesophagus may be caused by any disease which causes the muscles of the esophagus to fail to properly propel food and liquid from the mouth into the stomach (that is, a failure of peristalsis). Food can become lodged in the flaccid esophagus, where it may decay, be regurgitated, or maybe inhaled into the lungs (leading to aspiration pneumonia).

==Humans==
Megaesophagus may occur secondary to diseases such as achalasia or Chagas disease. Achalasia is caused by a loss of ganglion cells in the myenteric plexus. There is a marked lack of contraction within the muscles involved in peristalsis with a constant contraction of the lower esophageal sphincter. Dilation of the esophagus results in difficulty swallowing. Retention of food bolus is also noted.

==Other animals==
===Dogs===
Megaesophagus can also be a symptom of the disease myasthenia gravis. Myasthenia gravis is a neuromuscular disease where the primary symptom is weakness in various body parts of the dog. However, when myasthenia gravis occurs in older dogs it is thought of as an immune-mediated disease. Often when myasthenia gravis is diagnosed in older dogs the first symptom the dog may manifest is megaesophagus.

Myasthenia gravis occurs when acetylcholine receptors (nicotinic acetylcholine receptors) fail to function properly, so that the muscle is not stimulated to contract. There is an invention known as the &quot;bailey chair&quot; that uses the force of gravity to push down liquids and food into the dog&#x27;s stomach. Usually dogs are known to understand when it is time to eat in their bailey chair, and this helps prevent issues. Bailey chairs can be made and are sold. Also, a simple chair turned upside down can be successfully used for this purpose.
In two unrelated incidents in Latvia and Australia megaesophagus developed in dogs that had eaten certain brands of dog food; however, no agent that could have caused the disorder has been found in lab tests of the food.

====Diagnosis====

An important distinction in recognizing megaesophagus is the difference between when a dog regurgitates or vomits. When a dog regurgitates there is usually not as much effort involved as when a dog vomits. Often when regurgitating, the dog will tip its head down and the liquid and/or food will almost appear to &quot;spill out&quot; of its throat.

One of the primary dangers to a dog with megaesophagus is aspiration pneumonia. Because the food stays lodged in the throat, it can often be inhaled into the lungs causing aspiration pneumonia. One way to avoid this is to make sure that every time the dog eats or drinks anything, that the dog sits for at least 10 minutes afterward or is held in a sitting up or begging position. This disorder has a guarded prognosis, however, a successful management technique is vertical feeding in a Bailey chair.

==== Affected breeds ====
* Basset Fauve de Bretagne
* Bernese Mountain Dog
* Bichon Frise
* Boston Terrier
* Chihuahua
* Cocker Spaniel
* Dachshund
* English Springer Spaniel
* French Bulldog
* German Shepherd
* German Spitz
* Golden Retriever
* Great Dane
* Greyhound
* Irish Setter
* Irish Wolfhound
* Italian Greyhound
* Labrador Retriever
* Miniature Schnauzer
* Newfoundland dog
* Rottweiler
* Shar Pei
* Shih Tzu
* Welsh Corgi
* Welsh Terrier
* Wire Fox Terrier
* Yorkshire Terrier
===Cats===
Affected breeds:
* American Shorthair
* Persian (cat)
* Siamese (cat)

===Horses===
Megaesophagus is rare in horses. It is more frequently reported in Friesian horses than in other breeds. Congenital megaesophagus is usually identified when a foal begins to eat solid food from the ground; prior to this, as the foal nurses milk from its mother, the milk passes easily down into the stomach. The most common signs are difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) and inhalational pneumonia.

<doc id="1304440" wikidata="Q1041196" url="?curid=1304440" title="Finch station">
<text>Finch is the northern terminus subway station of the eastern section of Line 1 Yonge–University in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located under Yonge Street, north of Finch Avenue.

Finch is the busiest TTC bus terminal and the sixth-busiest subway station, serving approximately people per day. The station connects with other transit agencies at the adjoining Finch Bus Terminal.

==History==
The station was opened on March 29, 1974, in what was then the Borough of North York, by provincial premier Bill Davis and borough mayor Mel Lastman. It replaced as the northern terminus of the line. Houses which once fronted the station along Yonge Street were demolished. Finch was created using the cut-and-cover technique as a way to save money.

In 1999, this station became accessible with elevators.

In April 2006, work began on creating a new exit from the bus station on the western stub of Pemberton Avenue. This new exit was created because of the passenger and vehicular congestion that was created during the rush hour periods. In the morning rush hour, buses took an average of 1 minute and 58 seconds to travel the 40 metres from the station to Yonge Street, with some waiting up to 4 minutes. The new exit was completed in January 2007.

==Station description==
===Station layout and features===
Stairs, escalators, and elevators lead from the bus platform down three levels to the train platform. The upper concourse, one floor below the bus platform, is a corridor running the length of the bus platform. It collects the landings of all of the terminal&#x27;s stairs and escalators and leads to another bank of stairs and escalators down to the lower concourse.

The lower concourse level is the main concourse of the subway station. It is divided into the fare-paid and unpaid areas. The unpaid area is a long corridor, part of which runs alongside the fare-paid area lined with several automated Presto card fare gates and staffed entrances. It contains connections to office towers (North American Life, Place Nouveau, and condominiums on Pemberton Avenue), the regional bus terminal, and the &quot;kiss-and-ride&quot; passenger drop-off facility; it also contains Presto card fare vending machines. The fare-paid area houses a few shops, including Gateway Newstands and Tim Hortons, florist, lottery booth, clothing shop, and stairs and escalators down to the subway platform.

===Entrances===
Passengers can enter the station from eight different entrances located in the Finch Avenue and Yonge Street area. Accessible entrances can be found on Yonge Street at Hendon Avenue, by the Finch Bus Terminal, and at the North American Centre. Other non-accessible entrances can be found at 5775 and 5765 Yonge Street, Pemberton Avenue, and at the northeast corner of the Yonge Street and Finch Avenue intersection.

There is an emergency exit between Finch and stations at the northeast corner of Church Avenue and Yonge Street. The site was once the Willowdale United Church, demolished to make way for subway construction. Stairs from the subway tunnel surface into a brick building in the old cemetery.

===Parking lots and passenger drop-off facility===

There are two major TTC parking lots (referred to as the car park in directional signage) at Finch Station for use by commuters. They are named the East Lot and the West Lot, and are located north of Bishop/Hendon, east and west of Yonge Street respectively. The lots have a combined capacity of 3,227 parking spaces, the most of any TTC facility.

In addition to the parking lots, Finch station also features a relatively elaborate &quot;kiss-and-ride&quot; passenger drop-off/pick-up facility, which is connected to the lower concourse level of the station (outside the fare-paid area) by pedestrian tunnels. The area has a round, indoor waiting area for passengers, with about 20 temporary parking spaces circularly surrounding the structure. It is adjacent to the west parking lot.

On the north side of Bishop Avenue, slightly east of the station (along the southern edge of the GO bus terminal) is a parking lane for taxicabs. This is best accessed by exiting the subway station at the stairs/escalator to the north-east corner of Yonge and Bishop (the GO bus terminal).

==Ridership==

The ridership at Finch station has been relatively stable since 2007, with a peak ridership of 101,940 in 2011 and the lowest ridership in 2016 with 85,720 riders.

==Architecture and art==
Krystyna Sadowska&#x27;s sculpture &quot;Rhythm of Exotic Plants&quot; (1965) is displayed on the lower concourse level, outside the fare-paid area; A stainless-steel plaque celebrating the station&#x27;s opening is also located on the lower concourse. A smaller plaque is located at the south subway platform.

==Subway infrastructure in the vicinity==
North of the station, there are two tail tracks extending beyond the end of the platform, plus a third in between them, to store subway trains. South of the station, there is a diamond crossover for arriving trains to cross over to the southbound track, and for departing trains on the northbound track to depart via the southbound track.

==Surface connections==


When the subway is closed, buses do not enter the station, and an on-street transfer is required. TTC routes serving the station include:
==Nearby landmarks==
* Plaque on the North American Life building commemorating the birthplace of former Canadian Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson
* Newtonbrook Plaza
* Finch&#x27;s Hotel (historic landmark that no longer exists)

==Future==
A planned extension of Line 1 Yonge–University from Finch to Richmond Hill in York Region would add at least new 5 stations. First proposed in 2007 as part of MoveOntario 2020, the current plan was announced in April 2019 by Premier Doug Ford. In September 2022, Metrolinx awarded a contract to Black &amp; McDonald Limited to upgrade Finch station before the start of construction on the extension. Work was to include improvements to the electrical system that powered trains and extending the waterless sprinkler system over the tail tracks that were to become the new mainline north of the station.&lt;ref name=&quot;Metrolinx-2022/09/29&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the Transit City proposal called for a new LRT line, then known as the Etobicoke–Finch West LRT line, to run along Finch Avenue West from Humber College station to Finch station. While the portion from Humber College to Finch West station was under construction by 2022 as Line 6 Finch West, the Province of Ontario had no plans to construct the portion between Finch West and Finch stations .&lt;ref name=&quot;TheStar-2019/04/10&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<doc id="1304443" wikidata="Q7893066" url="?curid=1304443" title="2004 United States presidential election in Pennsylvania">
<text>The 2004 United States presidential election in Pennsylvania took place on November 2, 2004, and was part of the 2004 United States presidential election. Voters chose 21 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.

Pennsylvania was won by Democratic nominee John Kerry by a 2.50% margin of victory. Although no Republican carried this state in a presidential election since Bush&#x27;s father George H. W. Bush in 1988, early polling showed the race was a toss-up, thus was considered as a possible target for the Republicans. Prior to the election, most news organizations considered this a toss-up, or a crucial swing state. Later polling favored Kerry, leading half of the news organizations to predict that Kerry would win the state, but the other half still considered it a swing state. Although the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania voted for the Democratic presidential nominee in six subsequent elections since 1992, the margins of victory had become smaller over the past elections. On election day, Kerry won the state with 50.92% of the vote, but won only 13 of the 67 counties in Pennsylvania. Most of these 13 counties have the highest populations in the commonwealth. The biggest key to Kerry&#x27;s victory was winning Philadelphia County with 80.44% of the vote.

Bush was the first president elected to two terms in office without carrying Pennsylvania either time since Woodrow Wilson in 1912 and 1916, and is to date the only Republican presidential candidate to win the presidency without carrying the state at least once, as well as the most recent Republican to win without the state. Although Pennsylvania was also not carried by the winner of the 2000 presidential race, this election also marked the first time since 1968 that Pennsylvania voted against the winner of the national popular vote.

As of 2024, this is the most recent election to date in which Pennsylvania would vote for the losing candidate, thus the state is tied with Wisconsin and Michigan for the longest bellwether streak in the nation.

==Primaries==
===Eligibility===
In order to vote in the primary, one must have been:
# &quot;A citizen of the United States for at least one month before the next primary, special, municipal, or general election.&quot;
# &quot;A resident of Pennsylvania and the election district in which the individual desires to register and vote for at least 30 days before the next primary, special, municipal, or general election.&quot;
# &quot;At least 18 years of age on or before the day of the next primary, special, municipal, or general election.&quot;
# A registered member of the party holding the primary

Convicted felons could not vote from prison and were not allowed to register to vote for five years after being released from prison.

===Registration===
Individuals could register to vote at County Voter Registration offices, through the mail, at a Department of Transportation office, or at various other government agency offices.

Voters must have been registered 30 days prior to the election in order to be eligible to vote.

===Democratic primary election===

The Democratic primary took place on April 27, 2004. It was open to registered Democrats only.

====Results====
Note: 27 delegates remained uncommitted until they reached the floor of the convention. Kerry eventually received all 178 delegates from Pennsylvania.

===Republican primary election===
The Republican primary took place on April 27, 2004. It was open to registered Republicans only. Incumbent President George W. Bush ran unopposed.

==General election==
===Predictions===
There were 12 news organizations who made state-by-state predictions of the election. Here are their last predictions before election day.

===Polling===
Al Gore won Pennsylvania in 2000 with just over 50% of the vote. In late October 2004, the state was split at 47% on whether or not to approve of Bush. But Kerry won the poll 48% to 46% in the last Mason Dixon poll. Throughout the election of 2004, Kerry won most of the polls in the upper 40% to lower 50% range. However, Bush polled within the margin of error, usually in the mid 40% range. In the last Real Clear Politics average Kerry was leading with 48% and by almost a 1% margin.

===Fundraising===
Bush raised $5,030,349. Kerry raised $4,998,861.

===Advertising and visits===
President Bush campaigned heavily and visited the state of Pennsylvania over twenty times in 2004. It was not enough to flip the state, as John Kerry won the undecided Pennsylvanians. He won the state&#x27;s electors with almost 51% of the vote, outperforming Vice President Al Gore&#x27;s performance four years earlier.

==Analysis==
This Kerry victory can be attributed to the overwhelmingly Democratic cities of Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Erie. Although Kerry-held cities that voted for the Senator by narrow margins assisted him in advancing his margin over President Bush, many political analysts underscored the fact that if Philadelphia were excluded, President George W. Bush would have won Pennsylvania by a fairly slim margin, with 2,663,748 versus 2,395,890 for Kerry. Although Pennsylvania is closely divided in most elections, it did not vote Republican in a presidential election from 1992 to 2012. 

Philadelphia and Pittsburgh were the biggest contributors to Kerry&#x27;s victory in Pennsylvania. However, many independents in suburban Philadelphia counties (Bucks, Delaware, Montgomery, and somewhat in Chester) voted for Kerry, which may well have been the deciding factor. Kerry also had narrow margins of victory around cities like Allentown, Scranton, Erie, and the traditionally Democratic Pittsburgh suburbs; he also garnered many votes in certain rural areas such as parts of the Poconos and the Laurel Highlands, and in cities like Reading, Johnstown, Harrisburg, and State College. Bush&#x27;s margins were extremely large in central Pennsylvania and the sparsely populated Northern Tier, with traditional GOP cities such as Lancaster, Lebanon, York, Altoona, Huntingdon, and Williamsport strongly throwing their support behind him. This area, along with rural western Maryland, was the most conservative in the Mid-Atlantic.

, this is the last presidential election that the Democratic candidate won Washington County, Beaver County and Fayette County. This is also the last election in which Dauphin County and Centre County voted for the Republican candidate. This is also the last time that Chester County gave a majority to a Republican, although Mitt Romney did win the county with a plurality in 2012. This is the last time Democrats won a majority of congressional districts in the state.

==Results==
===By county===


====Counties that flipped from Democratic to Republican====
* Cambria (largest municipality: Johnstown)
* Carbon (largest municipality: Lehighton)
* Greene (largest municipality: Waynesburg)
* Lawrence (largest municipality: New Castle)
* Mercer (largest municipality: Hermitage)

===By congressional district===
Kerry won 10 of 19 congressional districts, including four held by Republicans. Bush won 9 districts, including one held by a Democrat.
==Electors==
Technically the voters of Pennsylvania cast their ballots for electors: representatives to the Electoral College. Pa. is allocated 21 electors because it has 19 congressional districts and 2 senators. All candidates who appear on the ballot or qualify to receive write-in votes must submit a list of 21 electors, who pledge to vote for their candidate and his or her running mate. Whoever wins the majority of votes in the state is awarded all 21 electoral votes. Their chosen electors then vote for president and vice president. Although electors are pledged to their candidate and running mate, they are not obligated to vote for them. An elector who votes for someone other than his or her candidate is known as a faithless elector.

The electors of each state and the District of Columbia met on December 13, 2004, to cast their votes for president and vice president. The Electoral College itself never meets as one body. Instead the electors from each state and the District of Columbia met in their respective capitols.

The following were the members of the Electoral College from the state. All 21 were pledged for Kerry/Edwards.

<text>Major Bummer is a humorous comic book produced by DC Comics in the late 1990s. It was created by writer John Arcudi and artist Doug Mahnke. For the series&#x27;s brief run, the main character was 19-year-old Lou Martin, who Arcudi described as &quot;smart enough that he might be able to cure cancer if he applied himself, but he&#x27;d rather use his brain to try and steal cable&quot;.

&quot;Major Bummer&quot; was cancelled after issue #15 - &quot;Sales were bad and there was just no way to keep this book going&quot;, wrote editor Peter Tomasi in the letter pages of the last issue.

==Concept and development==
Creator John Arcudi developed the concept of the series in 1992 and pitched it to DC Comics under the title &quot;Captain Slack-Ass&quot;. DC rejected this title and also insisted that the series be set in the mainstream DC Universe.

Arcudi and penciler Doug Mahnke, both of whom were in their 30s when the series was produced, admitted that they found it hard to empathize with a teenage slacker. Mahnke went so far as to visit malls and sketch passing teenagers just &quot;to get reference&quot;.

==Plot synopsis==
Two alien college students, Zinnak and Yoof, are doing their thesis on heroes in Earth culture. To further their study, they send through the mail EEMs or Extreme Enhancement Modules that, when opened, endow the recipient with superpowers.

Due to the incompetence of Yoof, an EEM is sent to Lou Martin, a slacker, instead of Martin Louis, an upwardly mobile young lawyer and philanthropist. Lou receives superhuman strength and intelligence. Unfortunately, because Lou is so lazy, he is only able to use his intelligence either subconsciously or during moments of extreme concentration. Despite this flaw, Lou was an erudite and intelligent individual already. Gaining powers is actually an inconvenience to him. Lou&#x27;s EEM is designed to attract trouble and the other superhumans whom Martin would have chosen to lead.

The other &quot;superheroes&quot; are Val Andrist, the environmentalist daughter of an Ice Cream magnate who can fly; Francis Dutton, an aromatherapist hippie with a sonic scream; Lauren Isley, an elderly woman who can predict the future (but is so absent-minded she got confused with the past); a cat that became a giant when scared; and &quot;Gecko&quot;, a nerdish man who can stick to walls.

EEMs were also gifted to a group of supervillains and attracted to one another in order to ensure battles would occur (e.g. the loser-turned-monster Nunzio, whom Lou brain-damaged via unintentional electrocution). Other stories involved a Nazi dinosaur from a parallel universe named Tyrannosaurus Reich, a demon-possessed toddler, carnivorous alien worms, an overly adoring fan of Lou&#x27;s that tried to kill him to make him more famous, and an alien time traveler that destroyed time.

==Supervillains==
* Tyrannosaurus Reich is a supervillain who was featured in &quot;Major Bummer&quot; #5. T. Reich was pulled to earth through a dimensional portal from a dimension inhabited by Nazi dinosaurs.

<text>Jacques-François Blondel (8 January 1705 – 9 January 1774) was an 18th-century French architect and teacher. After running his own highly successful school of architecture for many years, he was appointed Professor of Architecture at the Académie Royale d&#x27;Architecture in 1762, and his &quot;Cours d&#x27;architecture&quot; (&quot;Course of Architecture&quot;, 1771–1777) largely superseded a similarly titled book published in 1675 by his famous namesake, François Blondel, who had occupied the same post in the late 17th century.

==Career==
Born in Rouen, he initially trained under his uncle Jean-François Blondel (1683–1756), architect of Rouen. Jacques-François was in Paris by 1726 and continued his studies with Gilles-Marie Oppenord, from whom he acquired a knowledge of rococo. He also worked with Jean Mariette, contributing to the latter&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Architecture françoise&quot; (1727, 1738), as a writer and as an architectural engraver. Blondel developed into a conservative and thorough architect, whose rationally ordered mind consolidated French classical tradition and practice.

His first independent publication was the hugely influential encyclopedic work, &quot;De la Distribution des Maisons de Plaisance, et de la Décoration des Edifices en General&quot;, issued at Paris, 1737–38. It contained 155 carefully engraved plates. His &quot;Distribution des Maisons de Plaisance&quot; and other engraved work attracted a commission to produce thirteen of the engravings for the festival book commemorating the &quot;fêtes&quot; that celebrated the wedding of Madame Elizabeth of France with Dom Philippe of Spain, published in 1740.

That same year he opened his own private school in Paris, the &quot;École des Arts&quot;, sanctioned by the Académie in 1743. In the ensuing years a long sequence of architects profited from his discourse: Boullée, Brongniart, Chalgrin, La Guêpière, Desprez, de Wailly, Gondoin, Ledoux, Guimard and Rondelet, and to foreigners who would bring Neoclassicism home with them: the Anglo-Swedish Sir William Chambers, and the Dane Caspar Frederik Harsdorff. &quot;Blondel was the most significant French architectural educator of the eighteenth century...his objective was to establish design principles for domestic architecture that correspond to the classical principles already in practice for civil structures&quot;.

In his clear and rational &quot;Architecture françoise&quot;, a four-volume work published from 1752 to 1756, he covered the past century and more of French buildings in and near Paris, setting them in their historical context and providing a wealth of detailed information that would otherwise have been lost. In the preface, he remarked, &quot;I have used simple terms and a popular style with the intention of being understood by layman and artist alike; having noticed that recent books about architecture are either badly organised or overlong.&quot; He originally planned eight volumes, but only the first four were published. The work brought him to official notice; he was inducted into the Académie Royale d&#x27;Architecture in 1755 and appointed architect to Louis XV.

Though his executed body of work was small, mostly confined to work he executed at Metz under commission of the duc de Choiseul, his approach was soundly grounded: for Diderot&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; he wrote the article on masonry, as well as architecture, and contributed nearly 500 articles between 1751 and his death in 1774.

In 1762, he was appointed Professor of Architecture at the Académie, closing his own school and introducing his comprehensive curriculum to the Académie. His &quot;Cours d&#x27;architecture ou traité de la décoration, distribution et constructions des bâtiments contenant les leçons données en 1750, et les années suivantes&quot; began appearing in 1771 and ran to nine volumes by 1777, a volume of plates to each two volumes of text; the last volumes were seen through the press by his disciple Pierre Patte. His &quot;Cours d&#x27;architecture&quot; is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Petit Blondel&quot; to distinguish it from the &quot;Grand Blondel&quot;, his &quot;Architecture françoise&quot;.
Blondel&#x27;s practical, encyclopedic approach, largely ignoring the excesses of Rococo, had survived changes in taste and remained in the mainstream of French architectural training for several decades more.

==Personal life==
Blondel married Marie Anne Garnier in 1729. Their son, Georges-François Blondel, who was born in 1730, became an architectural engraver. They also had a daughter, Claudine Angelique. After his first wife&#x27;s death in 1755, Jacques-François married Manon Balletti in 1760. Their son, Jean-Baptiste Blondel, who later became an architect for the city of Paris, was born in 1764. During his final illness, Jacques-François requested to be taken to his classrooms at the Louvre, where he died surrounded by his books, his architectural models, and his students.

<text>Günzburg (; Swabian: &quot;Genzburg&quot;) is a town in Bavaria, Germany. It is a &quot;Große Kreisstadt&quot; and the capital of the Swabian district Günzburg. This district was constituted in 1972 by combining the city of Günzburg – which had not previously been assigned to a &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) – with the district of Günzburg and the district of Krumbach.

Günzburg lies where the river Günz enters the Danube, and has a population of about 20,350.

Legoland Deutschland Resort is located in Günzburg.

==History==

Günzburg was founded in about 70 BC by the Romans to defend the borders of their land along the Danube; it was known as &quot;Castellum Guntia&quot;, &quot;Gontia&quot; or &quot;Contia&quot;. The name comes from that of the Celtic goddess Gontia. It consisted of a fort, later replaced by at least one other on the same site, a fairly large civilian settlement and most likely an important bridge over the Danube.

After the Romans left in the fifth century, the Alamanni tribe settled there. In around 700 the nearby castle of &quot;Ricinis&quot; was mentioned by the Cartographer of Ravenna as one of the five most important castles of Alemannia. In 1065 first documentary evidence appears of the town itself as &quot;Gunceburch&quot;.

In 1301 the town became part of the Habsburg house and was developed into the centre of the Margraviate of Burgau; for a time (1803–1805) it was even the capital of all Further Austria.

Very near Günzburg is the site where the &quot;Leipheim Horde&quot; was defeated by the Swabian army in 1525 during the German Peasants&#x27; War. The same site saw the first flight by a Messerschmitt Me 262 in 1942.

In 1770 the city was visited by French queen Marie Antoinette. She broke her journey towards France for two days and was joined by her father’s sister, Princess Anne Charlotte of Lorraine. Together, they made a pilgrimage to the church of Maria Königin Bild, near Limbach.

On 9 October 1805, elements of the Sixth Corps of Napoléon&#x27;s Grande Armée assaulted Austrian positions in Günzburg. The first assault was initiated by the 25th Light Infantry and the 27th and 50th Infantry Regiments of the Line (under Pierre-Louis Binet de Marcognet), while the second consisted of only the 59th Infantry Regiment of the Line, under Mathieu de la Bassé; around one thousand Austrian prisoners were taken, and six guns captured. In 1806, through the Franco-Bavarian alliance, Günzburg was integrated into the Kingdom of Bavaria.

In April 1945, near the end of the Second World War, the city of Günzburg was bombed by the allies. Among other targets that were severely damaged or destroyed were the nearby town of Denzingen, the castle, and a munitions train that was in the train station.

Günzburg has flourished, boasting a thriving downtown shopping area, scenic views of the nearby historic castle, and one of the top five Legoland theme parks in Germany. It is also home of the football player Stefano Celozzi, who moved to Günzburg in 2016.

==Main sights==

The attractions of Günzburg include the Church of Our Lady (&quot;Frauenkirche&quot;) built by Dominikus Zimmermann, the margraves&#x27; castle (the only Habsburg castle built in Germany), the &quot;Reisensburg&quot; fort, today the congress centre of the University of Ulm and the nearly-intact old town centre.

In 2002 Legoland built a theme park near the town.

<doc id="1304522" wikidata="Q5045293" url="?curid=1304522" title="Carols by Candlelight">
<text>Carols by Candlelight is an annual Australian Christmas tradition that was popularised in Melbourne in 1938. The tradition has since spread around the world. It involves people gathering, usually outdoors in a park, to sing carols by candlelight, featuring live performances by both national and international celebrities accompanied by a symphony orchestra.

== Vision Australia&#x27;s Carols by Candlelight ==
Vision Australia&#x27;s Carols by Candlelight is the oldest Carols by Candlelight event in Australia.

=== History ===
Carols by Candlelight, held in Melbourne, Victoria, was introduced in 1938 by radio announcer Norman Banks, of Melbourne radio station 3KZ. Whilst walking home from his night-time radio shift on Christmas Eve in 1937, he passed a window and saw an elderly woman sitting up in bed inside listening to Away in a Manger being played on the radio and singing along with her face being lit by candlelight. Wondering how many others spent Christmas alone, he had the idea to gather a large group of people to all sing Christmas carols together by candlelight. The first ever event was held in Alexandra Gardens the following Christmas in 1938, and was attended by around 10,000 people.

Following World War II, the Carols became so well patronised that the decision was made to move it to the neighbouring park in Kings Domain. In 1959, the newly constructed Sidney Myer Music Bowl provided a permanent venue, where they are still held more than 60 years on as of 2023.

Funds raised from donations, ticket, and candle sales are given to Vision Australia (formerly the Royal Victorian Institute for the Blind, (RVIB)). However, originally, all profits went to the Austin Hospital. During World War II the Red Cross and the Australian Comforts Fund joined the Austin Hospital as co-recipients, and in the immediate post-war era the RVIB received funds, as did the Austin Hospital.

In recent years, the dress rehearsal on 23 December has become open to the public. Tickets to the event are cheaper than the main event, while funds raised still go towards Vision Australia. The event has become almost as popular as the main event in recent years.

Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there were no crowds for the 2020 event; it was the first time no crowds were allowed since its 1938 inception. Crowds were allowed in 2021, but all attendees (10,000 people) needed to have had the COVID vaccination.

===Hosts and broadcast===
The event was originally hosted by its founder Melbourne sports broadcaster Norman Banks and broadcast live over radio station 3KZ.

The 1956 Carols By Candlelight was the first to be broadcast on television, as part of GTV9&#x27;s pre-launch test transmission, with 3KZ maintaining a separate radio broadcast of the event.

When Banks left 3KZ in 1952, Philip Gibbs became host. During the time that Gibbs was hosting, the program became a radio/TV simulcast on 3KZ and ATV-0, with ATV-0&#x27;s first telecast in 1969, extending to other stations across the 0-10 Network (now Network Ten). From 1979 it was telecast nationally through the Nine Network. Later radio broadcast partners included 3MP, 3AW and 3EE and across the Macquarie Radio Network as well as Vision Australia&#x27;s own national radio network.
The event was also previously linked to Ray Martin, who hosted the carols for 18 years.
The event is also broadcast and telecast live to eastern Asia, many Pacific Islands and New Zealand.

=== Performers ===
Performers for the event vary from year to year. Regular performers include David Hobson, Marina Prior, Silvie Paladino, Denis Walter and Anthony Callea. Australian children&#x27;s band Hi-5 headlined children&#x27;s segments from 1999 to 2019. Nine Network stars have starred in the event in recent years. Contestants from The Voice Australia have also starred in the event from 2012 to 2020.

The Vision Australia&#x27;s Carols by Candlelight Choir, Australian Girls Choir and National Boys Choir of Australia appear on the show each year as supporting acts in numerous of the performances.

In 1938, the massed choirs were led by Horace Stevens, who was followed in the position by Max Balderson. Since 1988, Douglas Heywood has held the position of Choral Director. 

The long-serving musical director from 1984 to 2002 was Geoff Harvey. Since 2003, John Foreman has filled the position.

In earlier years, Carols by Candlelight had a strong classical music theme, and a noticeable religious influence. The Sun Aria winner for each year was automatically invited to sing at Carols by Candlelight. However, since the 1960s, the program has certainly moved toward popular culture.

Ray Martin holds the record for hosting the most Carols by Candlelight shows, from 1988 to 2007. He sang at only one show, in 1996, when he sang Harry Connick Jr&#x27;s &quot;When My Heart Finds Christmas&quot;.

==Other carols events==
Most cities and towns in Australia hold a night-time carols event in the lead-up to Christmas.

In the Adelaide suburb of Modbury, the annual Civic Park Carols attracts the second biggest crowd of its type (community) in Australia, with about 40,000 people attending the seventh edition in 2018.

===Hobart===
In Hobart, due to the urban nature of the city, there are three main carols services. One each in Clarence, Glenorchy and the main ceremony is held in the Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens by Variety - the Children&#x27;s Charity of Tasmania.

===Canberra===
In Canberra the annual Carols by Candlelight is held in Commonwealth Park on Stage 88. 2019 will be its 75th occurrence. This is the second longest-running Carols in a capital city.

<doc id="1304527" wikidata="Q860180" url="?curid=1304527" title="Charles Blondin">
<text>Charles Blondin (born Jean François Gravelet, 28 February 182422 February 1897) was a French tightrope walker and acrobat. He toured the United States and was known for crossing the Niagara Gorge on a tightrope.

During an event in Dublin in 1860, the rope on which he was walking broke and two workers were killed, although Blondin was not injured.

He married three times and had eight children. His name became synonymous with tightrope walking.

== Early life ==
Blondin was born on 28 February 1824 in Hesdin, Pas-de-Calais, France. His birth name was Jean-François Gravelet, though he was known by many other names and nicknames: Charles Blondin, Jean-François Blondin, Chevalier Blondin, and The Great Blondin. At the age of five, he was sent to the École de Gymnase in Lyon and, after six months of training as an acrobat, made his first public appearance as &quot;The Boy Wonder&quot;. His superior skill and grace, as well as the originality of the settings of his acts, made him a popular favourite.

== North America ==

Blondin went to the United States in 1855. He was encouraged by William Niblo to perform with the Ravel troupe in New York City and was subsequently part proprietor of a circus. He especially owed his celebrity and fortune to his idea to cross the Niagara Gorge (on the Canada–U.S. border) on a tightrope, long, in diameter and above the water, near the location of the current Rainbow Bridge. This he did on 30 June 1859, and a number of times thereafter, often with different theatrical variations: blindfolded, in a sack, trundling a wheelbarrow, on stilts, carrying his manager Harry Colcord on his back, sitting down midway while he cooked and ate an omelette, or standing on a chair with only one of its legs balanced on the rope.

== Britain and Ireland ==
On 23 August 1860, he performed at the Royal Portobello Gardens, on South Circular Road, Portobello, Dublin, on a rope feet above the ground. While he was performing, the rope broke, which led to the collapse of the scaffolding. Blondin was not injured, but two workers who were on the scaffolding fell to their deaths. An investigation was held, and the broken rope (reportedly in diameter and in circumference) examined. No blame was attributed at the time to either Blondin or his manager; the judge said that the rope manufacturer had a lot to answer for. The organiser of the event, a Mr. Kirby, said he would never have another one like it. A bench warrant for the arrest of Blondin and his manager was issued when they did not appear at a further trial, having returned to the US.

In 1861, Blondin first appeared in London, at the Crystal Palace, turning somersaults on stilts on a rope stretched across the central transept from the ground. He performed in September 1861 in Edinburgh, Scotland, at the Royal Botanic Gardens (then called the Experimental Gardens) on Inverleith Row.

The following year, Blondin was back at the same venue in Dublin, this time performing above the ground. He gave a series of other performances in 1862, as well, again at the Crystal Palace, and elsewhere in England and Europe. On 6 September 1873, Blondin crossed Edgbaston Reservoir in Birmingham. A statue built in 1992 on the nearby Ladywood Middleway marks his feat.

In October 1869, Blondin appeared in London at The Crystal Palace Harvest Fete. He traversed the long rope on a bicycle expressly made for the occasion. The bicycle was manufactured by Messrs. Gardiner and Mackintosh, engineers at New Cross and had no weights or attachments of any kind. The bicycle was a replica of a normal bicycle with the exception of the wheels which were deeply grooved to hold the rope.

On 3 August 1896, at the age of 71, Blondin walked on a tightrope across Waterloo Lake in Roundhay Park Leeds, several times. On one crossing he was blindfolded and on another he stopped to cook himself an omelette and eat it.

== Later years and death ==
After a period of retirement, Blondin reappeared in 1880 and starred in the 1893–94 season of the pantomime &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot; at the Crystal Palace, organised by Oscar Barrett. His final performance was in Belfast, Ireland in 1896.

Blondin died from complications of diabetes at his &quot;Niagara House&quot; in Ealing, London, on 22 February 1897, at age 72 and was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery. His estate at death was valued at £1,832 (£ as of ).

==Personal life==
Charles Blondin married Marie Blancherie on 6 August 1846, legitimising their son Aime Leopold, after which they had two more children. It is not known what happened to his French family after he went to the United States.

While in the U.S. he married a second wife, Charlotte Lawrence in Boston, Massachusetts in 1852. Together they had five children: Adele (b. 1854), Edward (b. 1855), Iris (b. 1861), Henry Coleman (b. 1862), and Charlotte (b. 1866).
In 1895, Blondin married again, this time in the United Kingdom. His third wife, Katherine James, had nursed him through a back injury earlier that year. Although much younger, Katherine survived him by only four years, dying of cancer in 1901 at the age of 36.

== Legacy ==
During his lifetime, Blondin&#x27;s name became so synonymous with tightrope walking that many employed the name &quot;Blondin&quot; to describe others in the sport. For example, there were at least five people working with variations of the Blondin name in Sydney in the 1880s, the most famous of whom was Henri L&#x27;Estrange—&quot;the Australian Blondin&quot;. So popular had tightrope walking become, that one Sydney resident wrote to the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; to complain of &quot;the Blondin business&quot; that saw people walking on high wires wherever the opportunity arose. He noted that he had seen one walking on a wire in Liverpool Street in the city with a child strapped to his back. The practice which had become so popular was both dangerous and, the correspondent thought, likely to be unlawful, particularly in the risk of harming others. In reporting on the fall of a woman from a tightrope at an 1869 performance of Pablo Fanque&#x27;s Circus in Bolton, the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot; described the tightrope walker, Madame Caroline, as a &quot;female Blondin&quot;.

Two streets in Northfields, London, are named in his honour: Blondin Avenue and Niagara Avenue; they were formerly the site of part of Hugh Ronalds&#x27; renowned nursery. Blondin Park in the same area is also named after him.

During the run-up to the 1864 United States presidential election, Abraham Lincoln compared himself to &quot;Blondin on the tightrope, with all that was valuable to America in the wheelbarrow he was pushing before him.&quot; A political cartoon in &quot;Frank Leslie&#x27;s Budget of Fun&quot; took up this quotation on 1 September 1864 depicting Lincoln on a tightrope, pushing a wheelbarrow and carrying two men on his back—Navy Secretary Gideon Welles and War Secretary Edwin Stanton—while &quot;John Bull&quot;, Napoleon III, Jefferson Davis (representing England, France, and the Confederacy, respectively), and Generals Grant, Lee and Sherman (representing the military) looked on, among others.

<doc id="1304540" wikidata="Q14621039" url="?curid=1304540" title="Black Flash">
<text>The Black Flash is a fictional comic book character from DC Comics. Created by writers Grant Morrison and Mark Millar, and artist Ron Wagner, the character had cameos in &quot;The Flash&quot; vol. 2 #138 (June 1998), before appearing in full in &quot;The Flash&quot; vol. 2 #141 (September 1998).

==Fictional character background==
=== Original depiction ===
The Black Flash essentially fulfills the same role as Death for those who possess super-speed in the DC Universe, returning the speedster to their power source: the Speed Force. It is reportedly seen before the deaths of Barry Allen and Johnny Quick. Max Mercury has also seen the Black Flash while having had several near-death experiences.

The specter speedster came for Wally West to draw back to the Speed Force, but instead took Linda Park. Having seen portents of Wally&#x27;s death, Max Mercury and Jesse Quick intercepted Wally before reaching the museum where Linda was waiting, with Linda thus being struck by the lightning that was meant to kill Wally. It later returns to try to take Wally again, freezing time except for those who possess a connection to the Speed Force. Max Mercury, Jay Garrick, and Jesse Quick all attempt to assist Wally by distracting the Black Flash; Wally finally defeats the Black Flash by racing the creature to the end of time, to a point where Death would have no meaning, causing the creature to dissipate.

The Black Flash appears to Bart Allen when the Flash loses his powers while battling the Rogues at the Getty Center. Despite a clash with Inertia (another possible candidate for the Black Flash), Bart is killed shortly thereafter by the panicked Rogues when it appears Bart would win, even without powers.

Most recently, the Black Flash is revealed to represent the Speed Force&#x27;s dark aspect which is responsible for the empowerment of Wally&#x27;s children. His connection to death is limited to those connected to the Speed Force. While an issue of &quot;Captain Atom&quot; suggests Death of the Endless, the Black Racer, and Nekron are all aspects of the same force, Neil Gaiman (creator of Death of the Endless) disagrees with this idea, stating that his creation is the ultimate personification of Death.

During the &quot;Final Crisis&quot;, Wally theorizes that the Black Racer pursuing himself and Barry is in fact the Black Flash.

A charred corpse, appearing to be the Black Flash, was found in Iowa by two boys in &quot;The Flash: Rebirth&quot;.

The Black Flash is sent hunting after the Force Barrier&#x27;s destruction, killing Psych and attacking Steadfast and Fuerza. The cosmically enhanced Hunter Zolomon takes Barry into the &quot;Forever Force&quot; (timestream) built by the Speed Force to which the Black Flash chases the two speedsters to kill, hoping to heal the Speed Force. Zoom later sacrifices himself to the Force Barrier in order to finally heal the Speed Force, trapping the Black Flash.

=== Barry Allen ===

The second Black Flash is Barry Allen due to Professor Zoom altering the Speed Force for a time.

=== Eobard Thawne ===

The third Black Flash is the reanimated corpse of Eobard Thawne, the Reverse-Flash, equipped with a power ring as a member of the Black Lantern Corps.

==Other versions==
An original incarnation of the Black Flash, Jesse Quick, appears in &quot;Ame-Comi Girls: Featuring Duela Dent&quot; #3.

==In other media==
===Television===
Two incarnations of the Black Flash appear in the Arrowverse series &quot;The Flash&quot;.
* An original incarnation, Hunter Zolomon / Zoom, appears as the Speed Force&#x27;s enforcer.
* The Black Lantern form of Eobard Thawne / Reverse-Flash appears in the eighth season finale &quot;Negative&quot; due to the Negative Still Force.

===Video games===
* The original incarnation of the Black Flash appears in &quot;Justice League Heroes: The Flash&quot;. Wally West / Flash is chased by the Black Flash when the player dies. Escaping the Black Flash is increasingly difficult after each death.
* The original incarnation of the Black Flash appears in &quot;Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure&quot;.
* The Eobard Thawne incarnation of the Black Flash appears as an alternate skin for Barry Allen / Flash in &quot;&quot;.
* The original incarnation of the Black Flash appears in &quot;DC Legends&quot;.

===Miscellaneous===
A demonic version of the Black Flash (also known as the Speed Demon and Black Racer) appears in &quot;Smallville Season 11&quot; #12. It seeks out Impulse and Jay Garrick&#x27;s souls, but comes into conflict with the former and Superman. As the fastest of the two speedsters, the Black Flash primarily focuses its attention on Impulse until the latter sacrifices himself to destroy the demonic speedster, which goes on to inspire Garrick to come out of retirement and form the Teen Titans.

<doc id="1304566" wikidata="Q2895175" url="?curid=1304566" title="Micromys">
<text>Micromys is a genus of small rodents in the subfamily Murinae. The genus contains two living species: the widespread Eurasian harvest mouse (&quot;Micromys minutus&quot;) of much of Europe and Asia; and the more restricted Indochinese harvest mouse (&quot;Micromys erythrotis&quot;) of Vietnam, southern China, and perhaps nearby regions. Fossils of &quot;Micromys&quot; date back to the Late Miocene and include at least 10 extinct species, which form several lineages.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Micromys&quot; is not closely related to any other murine genus, which has made elucidating its phylogenetic relationships difficult. Previously, it was placed in a distinct murine clade also containing &quot;Hapalomys&quot;, &quot;Chiropodomys&quot;, and &quot;Vandeleuria&quot;, but studies have since found this clade to be polyphyletic, and instead found &quot;Micromys&quot; to belong to a division of its own that forms a sister group to the tribe Rattini, which contains the true rats among many other genera. It has been debated over whether &quot;Micromys&quot; belongs in its own tribe (Micromyini) or is a basal member of the Rattini, but the American Society of Mammalogists presently classifies it in Rattini.

==Geographic range==
&quot;M. minutus&quot; lives throughout Europe and northern Asia. Distribution ranges from northwest Spain through most of Europe, across Siberia to Korea, north to about 65 degrees in Russia, south to the northern edge of Mongolia. There are also isolated populations in southern China west through Yunnan.

==Habitat==
&quot;M. minutus&quot; prefers habitats characterized by tall grasses. These would include high meadows, reed grass plots, bushland interspersed with grasses and grain fields. In Italy and East Asia, they also make a home in rice fields. Population density may be very high in favorable environments. Originally, these mice lived in humid regions with high, long-lasting grasses growing near rivers, ponds, and lakes. With the advent of human encroachment, however, &quot;M. minutus&quot; has been forced to live along roadsides and in crop fields. When land is cleared or crops harvested, this mouse is left homeless. The problem is solved by the mouse either forming a shallow burrow in the soil, or finding shelter in the barn or silo. Not all mice are so lucky, however, and many mice die after being rendered homeless.

==Physical description==

&quot;M. minutus&quot; is a small mouse, ranging in size from long, with a tail that is usually long. It has large eyes and ears, which permits it to see the slightest motions and hear the faintest sounds in the darkness. It has a small, blunt nose encircled by vibrissae. The fur is soft and thick, with the upper parts of the body a brownish color with a yellowish or reddish tinge, and the under parts white to buffy colored. The prehensile tail is bicolored and lacks fur at the very tip, and the feet are fairly broad. The feet are specially adapted for climbing, with the outer of the five toes on each foot being large and more-or-less opposable. This mouse can grip a stem with each hindfoot and its tail, leaving the forepaws free for collecting food. It can also use its tail for balance as it scurries along long grass stems. The fur is somewhat thicker and longer in the winter than in the summer. As with other members of its subfamily, &quot;M. minutus&quot; has moderately low crowned teeth with rounded cusps on the biting surface arranged in three longitudinal rows. The masseter muscle, as well as the lateral muscle of the jaw, are moved forward on the maxillary, providing very efficient, effective gnawing action. The auditory bullae are large, and it is thought that the size of these resonating chambers enables the mouse to detect low frequency sounds carried over great distances, and thus be better able to escape predation.

<text>Kamenz () or Kamjenc (Sorbian, ) is a town (&quot;Große Kreisstadt&quot;) in the district of Bautzen in Saxony, Germany. Until 2008 it was the administrative seat of Kamenz District. The town is known as the birthplace of the philosopher and poet Gotthold Ephraim Lessing and Bruno Hauptmann, convicted kidnapper of the Lindbergh baby. It lies north-east of the major city of Dresden.

==Geography==

This small town is located in the west of the Upper Lusatia historic region (West Lusatia), about northeast of Dresden and about northwest of Bautzen. Situated on the Black Elster river, between the West Lusatian Hills and the Lusatian Highlands rising in the south, the town was built on greywacke and granite rocks which were mined here for centuries. Kamenz railway station is the terminus of Lübbenau–Kamenz and Kamenz–Pirna railway lines. It is served by &quot;Regionalbahn&quot; trains from Dresden Hauptbahnhof, operated by the Städtebahn Sachsen.
The Hutberg hill west of the town centre, at an elevation of , is the site of an extended landscape park laid out in 1893. It is known for its major rhododendron and azalea collections flowering at Pentecost. In 1864 the Lessing Tower was erected on the hilltop, offering a panoramic view over the West Lusatian lands and the Upper Lusatian Heath and Pond Landscape in the north. About 32% of the nature in former Kamenz District is under protection, including a network of routes for riding by bicycle and hiking.

===Divisions===

The town Kamenz consists of Thale Kamenz and the following &quot;Ortschaften&quot; or municipal divisions:

*Bernbruch
*Biehla
*Brauna (incl. Liebenau, Petershain, Rohrbach and Schwosdorf)
*Cunnersdorf (incl. Hausdorf and Schönbach)
*Deutschbaselitz/Němske Pazlicy
*Jesau/Jěžow
*Lückersdorf-Gelenau (Lückersdorf, Gelenau and Hennersdorf)
*Thonberg/Hlinowc
*Wiesa/Brěznja
*Zschornau-Schiedel (Zschornau/Čornow and Schiedel)
== History ==
The settlement arose in the late 12th century, when a fortress was erected at the location of today&#x27;s old town, in order to secure the junction of the medieval Via Regia trade route with the Black Elster river. From here, the Via Regia offered important transport links from the Low Countries up to Silesia.

In 1225, written records first mentioned the town; Kamenz became an independent city in 1319, when Holy Roman Emperor Louis IV enfeoffed the West Lusatian lands to the Luxembourg king John of Bohemia. In 1346, the citizens joined the Lusatian League for protection against robber barons and to maintain public peace (&quot;Landfrieden&quot;). The town was nevertheless besieged and finally occupied by Hussite forces in 1429, who also devastated the nearby town of Wittichenau before they marched against Bautzen. In 1469, along with the Lusatian League, the town recognized the rule of King Matthias Corvinus and passed to Hungary, and in 1490 it returned to the Czech Crown, then under the rule of Polish Prince Vladislaus II. In 1493, King Vladislaus II of Bohemia had a Franciscan monastery established north of the Kamenz town walls, dedicated to Saint Anne in 1512.
Kamenz citizens officially turned Protestant in 1536. In the Schmalkaldic War of 1546/47, the Upper Lusatian towns refused to support the troops of the Habsburg emperor Ferdinand I against the Protestant princes and were penalised with the loss of numerous privileges. The Franciscan convent finally dissolved in 1564.

With the 1635 Peace of Prague, the Lusatias passed from the Bohemian Crown to the Electorate of Saxony. Several witch-hunts are documented in the 17th century. In 1707 a fire destroyed large parts of the old town. A second major fire on 4 and 5 August 1842 destroyed much of the city.

In 1896, Kamenz became garrison town of the &quot;Königlich Sächsisches Reserve-Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 242&quot;, part of the German 53rd Reserve Division. During World War II a subcamp of Gross-Rosen concentration camp was located in the town from 1944 to 1945, where forced labourers worked for a Daimler-Benz aircraft engine factory. The airfield northeast of the town was used by Luftwaffe &quot;Schlachtgeschwader 2&quot; and &quot;Sturzkampfgeschwader 77&quot; units.

After the war, the town became part of the Soviet occupation zone and East Germany. Until 1990, an officer candidate school of the East German Air Force Staff (&quot;Offiziershochschule Franz Mehring&quot;) was located at the Kamenz Airfield. The former municipality Schönteichen was merged into Kamenz in January 2019.

<text>Kusel (; written &quot;Cusel&quot; until 1865) is a town in the Kusel district in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It is the seat of the Kusel-Altenglan &quot;Verbandsgemeinde&quot; and is also the district seat.

The well-known operatic tenor Fritz Wunderlich was born in Kusel.

==Geography==

===Location===
Kusel lies on the Kuselbach in Rhineland-Palatinate&#x27;s southwest, in the North Palatine Uplands roughly 30 km northwest of Kaiserslautern. The Kuselbach rises in the outlying centre of Diedelkopf where the Bledesbach and the Pfeffelbach (or Aalbach) meet. The dale is hemmed in by a row of mountains, on the left bank the Ödesberg (375 m), and on the right the Gaisberg (355 m), the Roßberg (314 m) and the Herrchenberg (385 m). The floor of the dale lies roughly 220 m above sea level. Prominent landmarks just beyond the town&#x27;s limits are Lichtenberg Castle to the west and the Remigiusberg (368 m) and the Potzberg (562 m) to the east. With roughly 5,000 inhabitants, Kusel challenges Cochem for the title of Germany&#x27;s smallest district seat.

===Neighbouring municipalities===
Kusel borders in the north on the municipalities of Körborn and Blaubach, in the northeast on the municipality of Altenglan, in the east on the municipality of Rammelsbach, in the southeast on the municipality of Haschbach am Remigiusberg, in the south on the municipality of Schellweiler, in the southwest on the municipality of Ehweiler, in the west on the municipality of Pfeffelbach and in the northwest on the municipality of Ruthweiler.

===Constituent communities===
The town of Kusel is divided foremost into the &quot;Kernstadt&quot; (Inner Town) and the historic &quot;Altstadt&quot; (Old Town), with the former ringing the latter, and also into the &quot;Stadtteil&quot; of Diedelkopf, which has melded onto the Inner Town, the residential area “Am Holler” and a further &quot;Stadtteil&quot;, Bledesbach.

===Town’s layout===
The town was from the Middle Ages until the 19th century ringed with a town wall that had three town gates and five towers. In the town core, the mediaeval street layout has been preserved to this day, although the old buildings were burnt out almost utterly in a great fire in 1794. The town centre is characterized by buildings from the 19th century bearing the marks of Classicism and Historicism. Spreading out over the town&#x27;s west end in the dale, from the mid-19th century until the end of the Second World War, was a major industrial area whose main focus was clothmaking. Some of the old industrial buildings have remained, but are no longer used by industry. A new major industrial area arose after the war in the town&#x27;s east end. New residential areas were built as early as the 19th century in the neighbourhoods around Bahnhofstraße (“Railway Station Street”) and Tuchrahmstraße (“Tenter Street” – a not at all surprising street name for a town with a history of clothmaking), with others following in the 20th century, such as Am Holler (“At the Elderberry Tree”), In der Haischbach and around the outlying centre of Diedelkopf. The most important administrative buildings stand on Trierer Straße (district administration, the financial office, the local court, the police station) and on the Marketplace (Town Hall, which also serves as the administrative centre of the &quot;Verbandsgemeinde&quot;). The Evangelical church (&quot;Stadtkirche&quot; or “Town Church”) likewise stands on &quot;Marktplatz&quot; (the Marketplace), while the Catholic church stands on the edge of the Old Town on Lehnstraße. Since 1980, a cultural centre has stood on the Roßberg with a school centre (vocational schools and Hauptschule) and the great &quot;Fritz-Wunderlich-Halle&quot;. Further schools are scattered across the town, the Gymnasium in the west on Walkmühlstraße (“Walking Mill Street”), the Realschule on Lehnstraße, the &quot;Luitpoldschule&quot; (the town&#x27;s oldest school building) near the Marketplace on Luitpoldstraße, the &quot;Hollerschule&quot; (for children with learning difficulties) and the &quot;Jakob-Muth-Schule&quot; (for children with mental handicaps), both on Hollerstraße. The new hospital was built in 1984 and stands west of town, just beyond the limit in the municipality of Ruthweiler. Barracks arose in 1965 at the Windhof (despite the name, &quot;not&quot; a wind farm) near the Ödesberg in the town&#x27;s north end. Various sports facilities are spread over the town&#x27;s whole area. The main thoroughfare is &quot;Bundesstraße&quot; 420, which runs through town by way of Glanstraße, Fritz-Wunderlich-Straße and western Trierer Straße. Until the time after the Second World War, a railway line also ran through the town, roughly parallel to &quot;Bundesstraße&quot; 420. Today, Kusel only has an end-of-line station on the Kusel—Landstuhl line. The railway station in the town&#x27;s east end has since been torn down.

===Climate===
Yearly precipitation in Kusel amounts to 863 mm, which is rather high, falling into the highest third of the precipitation chart for all Germany. At 74% of the German Weather Service&#x27;s weather stations lower figures are recorded. The driest month is April. The most rainfall comes in December. In that month, precipitation is 1.8 times what it is in April. Precipitation varies moderately. At 50% of the weather stations, lower seasonal swings are recorded.

==History==

===Antiquity===
In the area around the town, many Celtic graves from the Iron Age have been unearthed. The Celtic population adopted Roman culture once Julius Caesar had conquered Gaul, and there have been Gallo-Roman archaeological finds throughout the region as well as in Kusel itself. In the time of the Migration Period (or &quot;Völkerwanderung&quot;), the area was first conquered by the Burgundians and then later by the Alemanni. As a result of the 496 Battle of Tolbiac (Zülpich), Kusel found itself under Frankish hegemony, and became, either by sale or donation, part of the Imperial domain around Kaiserslautern.

===Middle Ages===
In the 7th century, a Frankish kingly estate was built on the ruins of an old Roman estate. This served as a lodging, the &quot;Curtis Cosla&quot;. Since the name &quot;Cosla&quot; is of Celtic origin, it cannot be ruled out that there might have been continuous habitation here since prehistoric times. Thus, it is assumed that the town already existed when the so-called &quot;Remigiusland&quot; was given to the Bishopric of Reims. A royal donation to Reims did not come about through King Clovis I’s efforts towards Saint Remigius as it is claimed in Flodoard’s account of the history of the Bishopric of Reims, but rather more likely through Merovingian King Childebert II’s efforts towards Archbishop Egidius of Reims sometime between 575 and 590. In 850, the estate had its first documentary mention. In the 9th century, the estate and the surrounding lands found themselves in the ownership of the Archbishopric of Reims, whose founder was Saint Remigius. The formerly kingly estate underwent changes by monks, who made of it a monastic estate, and thus it became the centre of ecclesiastical and economic interests in the &quot;Remigiusland&quot;. A preserved altar text bears witness to a church consecration performed in 902 by Archbishop Herive from Reims. It was an earlier church, Saint Remigius’s Church (&quot;Remigiuskirche&quot;), that stood where the Evangelical church now stands, on the marketplace. Herive declared it the first “mother church” for the whole area. In 931, the estate at Kusel along with the surrounding area was transferred to the Abbey of Saint-Remi in Reims. In 1127, the monks from Reims built a Benedictine collegiate foundation on the nearby Remigiusberg (mountain), which made the Remigiusberg into the ecclesiastical hub of the whole &quot;Remigiusland&quot;. The estate at Kusel, represented by a court &quot;Schultheiß&quot;, became an administrative seat. From the beginning, Kusel was the centre of the &quot;Remigiusland&quot;. After the Carolingian Empire had been partitioned, however, Reims had a great deal of difficulty exerting its claims over its more distant holdings in Germany. In 10th-century documents, Kusel is described as an &quot;abbatia&quot; (“abbey”, by Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor in 952) and once as a &quot;curtis&quot; (“estate” by Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor in 965). Kusel must thus in the 10th century still have been the location of a monastery and an estate. The town&#x27;s and the &quot;Remigiusland’s&quot; ownership by the Archbishopric of Reims was acknowledged by all German kings into the High Middle Ages, as was ownership by the Abbey of Saint-Remi in Reims beginning in 952. Kusel, as an abbey and estate town, must have been a key location for the Archbishopric of Reims at this time. It is not known when the abbey was dissolved. It obviously no longer existed about 1125 when the new Benedictine provostry was founded on the Remigiusberg east of town. This founding stripped Kusel of its importance to the Archbishopric of Reims as an estate. Further information from the High Middle Ages is sparse. If the “mystery poet” Cäsarius von Heisterbach&#x27;s poem can be taken seriously, Kusel Market was plundered in the early 13th century, and this deed would surely have been perpetrated by vassals of neighbouring counts attacking Reims holdings. About 1112, a scion of the Nahegau counts named Gerlach was hired as an &quot;Advocatus&quot; (or, to use the German form of the word, &quot;Vogt&quot;) to protect the &quot;Remigiusland&quot;. As &quot;Vogt&quot; (lay church official charged with looking after church properties) over further ecclesiastical holdings of the Archbishopric of Reims and the Bishopric of Verdun, and as holder in his own right of lands in the Nahegau, he founded the County of Veldenz (1127–1444). Thus arose a power struggle between the owners of the &quot;Remigiusland&quot; – since 952 the Abbey of Saint-Remi in Reims – and the Counts of Veldenz. Clear signs of the power struggle were the castles, built unlawfully by the Counts of Veldenz, Castle Lichtenberg and Michelsburg on the Remigiusberg. The former was built nearby about 1214, and is nowadays known as Germany&#x27;s biggest castle ruin (425 m long, 382 m above sea level). In 1387, Kusel was mentioned in a document from the Counts of Veldenz as &quot;Cuscheln der Stat&quot;, the last word being an archaic form of &quot;Stadt&quot;, the German word for “town”. Town fortification with moats, walls, towers and gates began. In 1444, Kusel was transferred to the Duchy of Palatine Zweibrücken, for the Counts of Veldenz had died out in the male line. Castle Lichtenberg became the &quot;Oberamt&quot; of Lichtenberg. The struggle over the small Reims area was also pursued by the Dukes (originally Counts Palatine) of Zweibrücken. This struggle ended only in 1552, when the &quot;Remigiusland&quot; was sold to Zweibrücken for 8,500 Rhenish guilders. Kusel is known to have been granted town rights on the Kaiserslautern model in 1347 by Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor, as witnessed by a text in the Obermoschel town book. No document of the actual deed is preserved, however. Information appearing in some sources, according to which Kusel already had town rights in the 12th century, cannot be confirmed. In 1386, Kusel was first described as a town in a document that has survived to the present day. After the monastery on the Remigiusberg was founded and Castle Lichtenberg was built, the so-called &quot;Kuseler Oberhof&quot; (“Kusel High Court”) continued to exist. This was a court of &quot;Schöffen&quot; (roughly “lay jurists”) that kept its function as a legal institution even after the &quot;Remigiusland&quot; was sold to the Counts Palatine of Zweibrücken. In 1758, Zweibrücken administration of the &quot;Oberamt&quot; of Lichtenberg was moved back to Kusel.

===Modern times===

In the 16th century, the Kusel region was thrice stricken by the Plague. Several times, Kusel was utterly destroyed. The first great destruction came in 1635 during the Thirty Years&#x27; War when Croatian troops of the Imperial army under General Matthias Gallas got into the town by cunning, killed more than half the townsfolk and then set the town ablaze. It took 40 years to build the town back up, but then came the second great destruction in 1675 or 1677 (sources differ), wrought by French King Louis XIV&#x27;s soldiers during the Franco-Dutch War. Much of the town was once again burnt down. There were further great losses among the populace, and parts of the town were destroyed.

====Recent times====
During the French Revolution, Kusel was burnt down for the third time in 1794. Within half an hour, all the town&#x27;s inhabitants had to leave, under threat of death, before the soldiers set all the houses on fire. The town burnt down and only two houses were left standing, among them the Reformed inspectorate house, today the Evangelical deaconry building. Nevertheless, French Revolutionary troops meant to spare the people&#x27;s lives. One story has it that the town was burnt down because somebody there was printing counterfeit assignats. This assertion cannot be proved, but there were certainly false assignats in town, as there were almost everywhere, and it is believed that the French were even offered false assignats in a bid to ransom some hostages. It is likelier, though, that the burning of Kusel was meant as a general example to others in the hope that they would thereafter desist from falsifying assignats. According to another version of the story, six houses were left standing afterwards. The deed is said in this case to have been a punishment for the town&#x27;s having supplied a few townsmen who had been held hostage in Metz with &quot;money&quot; (not specifically assignats), which had then turned out to be counterfeit, and apparently made in Kusel. It has also been hypothesized that it was actually Kasel (near Trier) that was supposed to be destroyed, and that Kusel was burnt down instead owing to a spelling mistake in the soldiers’ orders. Kusel grew gradually into a town of craftsmen and weavers. On 26 July 1794, French Revolutionary troops occupied the town (and burnt it down). During the time of French rule, Kusel kept its administrative function, but only as the seat of a canton. As compensation for the town&#x27;s destruction, though, the institution of a peace court was promised. The town lay during the time of French annexation in the Arrondissement of Birkenfeld and the Department of Sarre. In 1813 the army of Napoleon, retreating to France after his defeat at the battle of Leipzig, stopped at Kusel the 24 November; general Frédéric Henri Walther died in town that night from sequels of the battle. After victory over Napoleon in 1815, Kusel was at first subject to a joint Prussian-Bavarian-Austrian &quot;Landesadministrationskommission&quot; (“State Administration Commission”), which was responsible for ascertaining new borders. Under the new order, the town was assigned in 1818 to the Bavarian &quot;Rheinkreis&quot; – a new exclave of that kingdom created by the Congress of Vienna – as the seat of a &quot;Landkommissariat&quot; (later &quot;Bezirksamt&quot; and now district). During the 19th century, the town&#x27;s industrialization began, which also led to the downfall of such traditional crafts as hat making, linen weaving and stocking knitting. Dwellers of the villages around Kusel for decades travelled worldwide plying their trade as travelling musicians (&quot;Wandermusikanten&quot;). Kusel is often seen nowadays as the hub of this movement, even though the town itself yielded very few of these &quot;Wandermusikanten&quot;. The first watermain was laid in 1824. Voluntary donations funded the &quot;Maximilianbrunnen&quot; (fountain). Between 1850 and 1880, important cloth and knitting yarn factories were founded (Zöllner, Ehrenspeck, Fickeissen). In 1868, the railway from Landstuhl to Kusel was built, which brought the town great economic advantages. In the local quarries, “cuselite” was being mined for use as paving stones and for building railways. Also springing up were breweries, machine foundries, wool weaving factories, brickyards, printing shops and smithies making chains or nails. The town also became the regional agricultural hub with its livestock markets (later the Autumn Fair). Towards the end of the Second World War, the town was repeatedly bombed by Allied fighter-bombers and also by bigger aircraft. One air raid alone, on 6 January 1945, destroyed much of the town and killed 37 people. After 1945, new industrial operations arose, new building areas were opened (Holler-Siedlung) and schools were built. Further political changes came only with the realignment of political entities after the war and with the founding of the new state of Rhineland-Palatinate. As early as 1939, the village of Diedelkopf was amalgamated with Kusel, while the same was done with the village of Bledesbach on 17 March 1974. In the course of administrative restructuring in Rhineland-Palatinate in 1968, the town became the seat of a &quot;Verbandsgemeinde&quot; administration. Today the &quot;Verbandsgemeinde&quot; of Kusel-Altenglan consists of 34 municipalities. The district has remained, although its boundaries have now and then been adjusted. After the First World War, the Canton of Waldmohr in the &quot;Bezirksamt&quot; of Homburg was grouped into the Kusel district, while after the Second World War, six municipalities in the Oster valley passed to the Saarland. Further realignments took place as part of the administrative restructuring of 1969 to 1972. In 1964, Kusel became a garrison town. A smaller garrison was already in the town in 1938, billeted in a simple barracks camp. Only after the Second World War did the barracks buildings on the &quot;Windhof&quot; come into being. They are named the &quot;Unteroffizier-Krüger-Kaserne&quot;.

===Population development===
In 1609, a population count yielded a figure of 568 inhabitants. In the final stage of the Thirty Years&#x27; War, there may have been few people left living in the town. The population figure was strongly bolstered, however, by returning refugees and newcomers by the time of the Franco-Dutch War, but quickly fell down once again in the destruction wrought in that war. It was the French themselves who promoted quick repopulation. In 1693 there were 150 people living in Kusel. Only about the middle of the 18th century, though, did the town&#x27;s population once again reach its 1609 level. According to lists of losses, at the time when the French burnt the town down, 1,334 people called Kusel home. The people now lived in the ruins or sought shelter in the outlying villages. By 1802, the town once again had 1,267 inhabitants. Population growth went into a marked upswing brought on by the industrialization that was now setting in, although the trend was not quite as strong as it was in some of the Palatinate&#x27;s other towns and cities. The 6,000 mark was reached only after the Second World War, and only for a short time. In 1928, Kusel had 3,588 inhabitants who broke down denominationally thus: 3,019 Protestants, 486 Catholics, 66 Jews, 12 dissenters.

The following table shows population development over the centuries for Kusel:
===Town’s name===
The oldest known form of the town&#x27;s name, &quot;Cosla&quot;, is to be found in the &quot;Remigiustestament&quot;, a document that is likely a forgery by Archbishop Hincmar of Reims (806-882). It is a Celtic word matching the names of a whole series of little brooks and rivers in France that bear the name Côle, such as this one. The circumflex accent in this name indicates a suppressed S. The town&#x27;s name originally referred to the brook that flowed through town, making its meaning simply “settlement on the Cosla brook”. Other forms of the name that the town has borne over the ages are &quot;Chuosla&quot; (902), &quot;abbatiam nomine Coslam&quot; (952), &quot;Chusela&quot; (about 1200), &quot;Cuslea&quot; (1217), &quot;Cussla&quot; (1127), &quot;Consula&quot; (1235), &quot;zu Cuselen&quot; (1314), &quot;Koschela&quot; (1347), &quot;Cuscheln die Stadt&quot; (1387), &quot;Kuschel&quot; (1395), &quot;Cuselle&quot; (1428), &quot;Cussel&quot; (1747) and &quot;Cusel&quot; (1824).

===Vanished villages and cadastral names===
Although forestry and agriculture only play a minor role in the town&#x27;s economy these days, Kusel has a rather great area within its limits and extensive woodlands. These are found mainly in the Winterhell, on the Gaisberg and around the Gailbach. Rural cadastral names within town limits often refer to vanished villages, for example “Dimbsweiler Höh”, “Grehweiler” and “Haupweiler Grund”. Former owners’ names also show up in rural cadastral names such as “Lauers Bösch” and “Metternachs Wieß”. The Family Metternach was a mediaeval noble family with great landholds in the Kusel area. Yet other rural cadastral names refer to the land&#x27;s attributes, like “Bruchhell” (“wet sloped land”) or “Weingarten” (literally “wine garden”, and therefore “vineyard”). Indeed, there was winegrowing in Kusel until the 18th century. The rural cadastral name “Feist”, despite its meaning (“fat” or “adipose”), is geological in origin, for it refers to a particular Permian formation known in German as &quot;Feistkonglomerat&quot;. Vanished villages known from records to have existed within Kusel&#x27;s current limits are Heubweiler, Dimschweiler and Peychnillenbach.

==Religion==

The area between the marketplace and the &quot;Neues Tor&quot; (“New Gate”) on Trierer Straße, which is still only lightly settled today, may well originally have been the place where the Archbishopric of Reims established its estate. Here stood a monastery with a church. The first church, mentioned in 902, can be considered a forerunner to today&#x27;s &quot;Stadtkirche&quot; (“Town Church”). Going by the earlier church&#x27;s foundations, attempts have been made to reconstruct the old church in model form. This small Romanesque church had fallen into disrepair over the ages, not least of all because so many wealthy townsmen over time had had themselves buried in it. It was torn down in 1712, and on the same spot rose the new Baroque church, built by Master Builder Johannes Koch from Zweibrücken. In 1794, though, this church was destroyed when the French burnt the town down. Wall remnants were then torn down, and between 1829 and 1831, building work yielded the Classicist Town Church that still stands today. With respect to denominational development, the ecclesiastical policy practised by the Counts Palatine of Zweibrücken held true for Kusel. Thus, beginning in 1523, Duke Ludwig II put forth efforts to establish the Reformation according to Martin Luther’s teachings. Ludwig II died only nine years later, though, in 1532, and his brother Ruprecht, who was Ludwig’s son’s regent in the time before the boy, Wolfgang, was old enough to assume leadership duties, pushed the late Ludwig’s policy through and reformed the County Palatine under the principle of &quot;cuius regio, eius religio&quot;. Count Palatine (Duke) Johannes I, Ludwig II’s grandson, Wolfgang’s son and a follower of the reformer John Calvin led the County Palatine to another great turn in its denominational history in 1588. All subjects now had to set aside their Lutheran faith and adopt Reformed beliefs according to Calvin’s teachings (Calvinism). This forcible conversion led to various problems, particularly among the Evangelical clergy. This change in religious belief was imposed on all places in the Duchy of Palatine Zweibrücken. The difference between Luther’s and Calvin’s teachings should be briefly explained. An example of Lutheran teaching is the concept that man does not find his way to God simply by doing good works, but only through belief (&quot;sola fide&quot;). Calvinist teaching, on the other hand, holds that man’s fate is predetermined by God, and that the faithful can fulfil this predetermination and must submit themselves to strict church discipline through obedience and diligence, and by forgoing worldly pleasures. Disobedience to God, however, is the way to hell (double predestination). The sociologist Max Weber (1864–1920) took the view that Calvin’s demands led to an “inner asceticism”, which bestowed great wealth upon man. If Weber&#x27;s thesis was right, this would mean that Calvin was – unwittingly and perhaps also unwillingly – among those who paved the way for capitalism. The town&#x27;s Catholic Christians from the late 17th century onwards had the right to use the Town Church for their own services along with the Reformed Christians under a simultaneum. For Christians of the Lutheran denomination, a small church was built at the southern town wall on the Bangert and consecrated in 1748. After the union of the Calvinists and the Lutherans in the Union of 1818, the little Lutheran church was turned over to the Catholics. When a new Catholic church was completed on Lehnstraße, the former Lutheran church was torn down. There were other churches in Kusel. From the High Middle Ages on, Saint Giles’s Church (&quot;Ägidienkirche&quot;) stood near the great Town Church. It was used as a graveyard chapel. It fell into disrepair after the town graveyard was moved in 1564. Meanwhile, a burial chapel was built at the new graveyard in the Weibergraben. This was torn down when the town graveyard was moved once again in 1896 to the place where it still lies today, on the road to Rammelsbach. Moreover, the little &quot;Kreuzkapelle&quot; (“Cross Chapel”) stood available to travellers and those passing through before the &quot;Untertor&quot; (“Lower Gate”) in the Middle Ages. After the Reformation, it was abandoned and in 1702 it was torn down. In 1900 there were plans to build a synagogue. Since many Jews were then leaving the town, however, the plans never came to fruition. Until the time of the Third Reich, when they were deported to the camps by the Nazis, there was a room on Ziegelgässchen (“Little Brick Lane”) where Jews could gather. Other religious communities in town are the Baptists or &quot;Evangelische Freikirche Kusel&quot; (Free Baptist Community) with a centre since 1985 in Kusel-Diedelkopf, Trierer-Straße 117, and some 40 members (2000), and the New Apostolic Church since 1933 with some 180 members and a centre at Fritz-Wunderlich-Straße 24. In 2007, 62.2% of the inhabitants were Evangelical and 18.4% were Catholic. The rest either adhered to other faiths or professed none.

==Politics==

===Town council===

The council is made up of 20 council members, who were elected by proportional representation at the municipal election held on 25 May 2014, and the honorary mayor as chairwoman.

Municipal elections yielded the following results:

===Mayor===
Kusel&#x27;s mayor is Jochen Hartloff (SPD).

===Coat of arms===
The German blazon reads: &quot;In Grün ein aufgerichteter, wachsender, goldener Krummstab, belegt mit einem silbernen Schräglinkswellenbalken.&quot;

The town&#x27;s arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Vert issuant from base a bishop&#x27;s staff Or surmounted by a bend sinister wavy argent.

The main charge in these arms, the bishop&#x27;s staff, is a reference to the village&#x27;s former allegiance to the Archbishopric of Reims, which held Kusel and the countryside all around it, the so-called &quot;Remigiusland&quot;, up until the 16th century. The “bend sinister wavy” (slanted wavy stripe) stands for the Kuselbach, the brook that flows through town. The arms in this composition go back to old town seals, particularly one used as far back as 1624. The arms were approved in 1841 by King Ludwig I of Bavaria (Kusel lay in the Kingdom of Bavaria at that time owing to the new, post-Napoleonic order imposed by the Congress of Vienna).

===Town partnerships===
Kusel fosters partnerships with the following places:
* Toucy, Yonne, France since 1973
* Zalaegerszeg, Zala County, Hungary since 1997

===Buildings, theatres and museums===
The building development at the marketplace is dominated by the Town Hall (&quot;Rathaus&quot;) with its carillon, the Classicist Evangelical town church and the &quot;Hutmacherbrunnen&quot; (“Hatter’s Fountain”). The church distinguishes itself with its clear lines, a (rare) strictly symmetrical construction of the altar-pulpit-organ area and the hefty, monolithic round sandstone columns that bear the galleries’ weight. The town church is one of the region&#x27;s – perhaps one of Germany&#x27;s – loveliest Classicist churches.
Roughly six kilometres’ driving distance from downtown Kusel stands Castle Lichtenberg. With a length of 425 m, it is Germany&#x27;s biggest castle ruin. It stands near Thallichtenberg. Integrated into the complex is the Musikantenland Museum, which documents the history of the &quot;Musikantenland&quot;. For more about this cultural phenomenon, see the relevant sections in the article about Hinzweiler (Musikanten and Otto Schwarz). The GEOSKOP museum of the primeval world was opened at the castle as an outpost of the &quot;Pfalzmuseum für Naturkunde&quot; (Palatine Museum for Natural History) in 1998. It is devoted mainly to the geological history of the local rotliegend rocks.

At the Fritz-Wunderlich-Halle, a multipurpose hall used for presentations, theatre and concert productions, and used by the school centre on the Roßberg as an auditorium, a cultural programme of surprising comprehensiveness for such a small town is offered in collaboration with the local authorities. This includes a goodly number of appearances by both German and international touring theatre troupes. Almost all the classics have played on the stage at least once. The &quot;Fritz-Wunderlich-Halle&quot; was built in 1980 at the school centre on the Roßberg with seating for some 650 spectators.
Kusel&#x27;s most important museum is the &quot;Stadt- und Heimatmuseum&quot; (Town and Local History Museum) on Marktstraße, which houses an extensive collection from the town&#x27;s history. On show there are, among other things, a permanent exhibit dealing with the great singer and Kusel native Fritz Wunderlich’s life – a favourite among visitors – and another about historically typical household devices of the Palatinate.

===Regular events===
The kermis (church consecration festival) formerly held on the third weekend in August is now no longer of any importance. The &quot;Kuseler Messe&quot; (“Kusel Fair”) or &quot;Kuseler Herbstmesse&quot; (“Kusel Autumn Fair”), now held on the first weekend in September (Friday evening until Tuesday) is said to be one of the Western Palatinate’s biggest folk festivals. Moreover, there are the Shrovetide (&quot;Fasching&quot;) market and the Christmas market. On the second Thursday in every month, on the Koch’sches Gelände, a flea market is held. On the second weekend in June, the &quot;Hutmacherfest&quot; (“Hatters’ Festival”) is celebrated in the Old Town (&quot;Altstadt&quot;). On 29 May 2010, the yearly &quot;Team-Triathlon Kusel&quot; was launched for the eleventh time. It is one of Rhineland-Palatinate&#x27;s biggest leisure-sport events. It involves a combined cycling-swimming-walking relay by teams that must always be made up of three participants, who must be at least 15 years old on the day of the competition. On 25 September 2010, the ninth &quot;Team-Duathlon Kusel&quot;, with a length of 42 km, took place.

===Clubs===
Many clubs promote the town&#x27;s community life. Particularly worthy of mention are the transport club, the Carnival club, the sport club, the gymnastic club, the Evangelical church choir and the music club. Famous are the church choir&#x27;s musical events held each year on the fourth Sunday in Advent, and the concerts given by the West Palatine Symphony Orchestra (music club). The choir is nowadays associated with a Gospel choir, which enjoys great popularity.

===Sport and leisure===
Kusel&#x27;s biggest leisure facility is the &quot;Verbandsgemeinde&quot;-run &quot;Spaß- und Freizeitbad&quot; (“Fun and Leisure Pool”) in Diedelkopf. It consists of an indoor swimming pool with hot tub, tanning bed, pools for children, non-swimmers and swimmers, the last with a diving setup, and also of an outdoor swimming pool with a playground for children, non-swimmers and swimmers, a fun pool. Also found here are a 64 m-long waterslide that ends in summer at the outdoor swimming pool and in winter at a heated outdoor arm of the indoor swimming pool, and a miniature golf course. Besides two football pitches, one in the outlying centre of Diedelkopf and the other near the way out of town going towards Haschbach am Remigiusberg, there are indoor and outdoor tennis courts on the radial road going towards Blaubach.

==Economy and infrastructure==

===Economic structure===
Given the town&#x27;s central location, many markets were held in Kusel even as far back as the Middle Ages, although these often had to put up with stiff competition from other traditional markets in other nearby places. The town&#x27;s economic life in the late 18th century was characterized by many small craftsmen&#x27;s workshops. There were wool and linen weavers, doublet and hose knitters, clothmakers and hatters as well as walking mills and gristmills, tanneries and several breweries. At the same time, dealers travelling overland from the town did a brisk trade with these products. In the age of industrialization, few of these craftsmen managed to expand their workshops or to switch to new, effective production methods. Thus, many small craft businesses had to cease work, and production was soon concentrated in a few bigger companies. Establishing themselves as such were a few businesses in textile manufacturing. In 1857, the Fink Brothers (their name is actually German for “Finch”) opened a cloth factory on Trierer Straße that had what were then state-of-the-art looms. This factory burnt down in 1865 and was never restored. Besides the Fink Brothers’ factory, two other great textile mills set up shop in Kusel, the Zöllner plant and the Ehrenspeck plant. At the former, it was mostly durable material that was made, for work clothes, such as tirtey (“midweight woollen fabric in twill weave, with a combination of carded woollen yarns in the weft and cotton yarns in the warp. Mostly used for work trousers.”) and buckskin cloth (not leather, but rather a “thick, smooth cotton or woollen fabric”). In 1885 the Zöllner plant, too, burnt down, but unlike the Fink Brothers’ factory, it rose from the ashes and in the years before the First World War, it even underwent an important expansion. It flourished until about 1930, when the Great Depression set in. It was then taken over by Karl Hermann and run until 1958 as the &quot;Westpfälzische Tuchfabrik&quot; (“West Palatine Cloth Factory”). The Ehrenspeck plant arose from a craft business. It was built on Trierer Straße in 1867. Here, fine knitted wares were made, but this plant, too, burnt down, in 1928. Later, in a portion of the plant, vigogne spinning was temporarily done (this fabric is made of natural, sometimes along with artificial, fibres in imitation of vicuña wool). Moving into the factory after the Second World War was the &quot;Tuchfabrik Kahnes&quot;, which specializes in making synthetic non-woven fabrics. About 1960, the factory was moved to Haschbacher Straße. The Kahnes Cloth Factory is the only such factory that is still in business in Kusel. Besides the textile works, there were the Schleip nail factory and the Christian Gilcher machine factory in Kusel, both of which are now gone. From the several small breweries originally in town, two grew into major businesses, Koch and Emrich. Koch merged in 1972 with the &quot;Bayerische Brauerei&quot; in Kaiserslautern, and afterwards was closed. After the building was torn down, a great vacant lot was left, which later saw only minor building (an underground parking garage and the Café Rothenturm). The Emrich Brewery continued as a private brewing company until 1998, when it, too, was closed. A major production business in Kusel today is the high-speed printing machine factory, a subsidiary of Albert in Frankenthal. A computer industry production facility has also located in Kusel, the firm Owen Electronics, as has an important software business, Transware, inpremises formerly occupied by the cloth factory. The town&#x27;s economic life is otherwise represented foremost by supermarkets and retail businesses, which are housed in an industrial park beside &quot;Bundesstraße&quot; 420 between Kusel and Rammelsbach.

===Authorities===
Kusel is seat of the town, &quot;Verbandsgemeinde&quot; and district administration of Kusel, a financial office, a forestry office, a surveying and cadastral office and a branch of the &quot;Bundesagentur für Arbeit&quot;. The Rhineland-Palatinate weights and measures authority (&quot;Eichbehörde&quot;) once kept an office in Kusel, but this has disappeared. It was housed in the Luitpoldschule building. Stationed in Kusel is the &quot;Artillerielehrregiment 345&quot; (“Artillery Teaching Regiment 345”; formerly the &quot;Panzerartillerielehrregiment 345&quot;), although within the framework of Bundeswehr reform, this is supposed to be moved to Idar-Oberstein. There is an Amtsgericht that belongs to the Landgericht (state court) region of Kaiserslautern and the Oberlandesgericht (superior state court) region of Zweibrücken.

===Education===
Historical records yield the first proof of a school in Kusel in 1535. The pupils were all boys, and the assistant pastor had to teach. There was an intention to open a Latin school, but only a small percentage of the schoolchildren was interested in Latin instruction. In 1580, the &quot;Deutsche Schule&quot; (“German School”) was founded, and attendance was compulsory for all boys. In 1743, a girls’ school arose next to the boys’ school. Soon afterwards, other classes suited to denominational orientation were founded, and there were now new attempts to teach Latin. The Catholic school was attended by schoolchildren from 50 villages in the area. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, schooling had to be suspended for years. No purpose-built schoolhouse stood anywhere in town. Classes were held wherever they could be held, and often schoolteachers used their own houses. Only in the early 19th century did the town have major schoolhouses built, a Protestant one up from the &quot;Stadtkirche&quot; (“Town Church”) and a Catholic one near where the town hall now stands. In 1912, all primary school classes were moved to the newly built &quot;Luitpoldschule&quot;. Only after the Second World War was another school built, this one for primary school and Hauptschule, called the &quot;Hollerschule&quot;. The &quot;Luitpoldschule&quot; and the &quot;Hollerschule&quot; nowadays house primary school classes, with a kindergarten. A new Hauptschule for the whole &quot;Verbandsgemeinde&quot; was built at the school centre on the Roßberg, coming into service in 1981. The Latin school was finally established in 1836, and it was converted into a Progymnasium (a kind of general Gymnasium) in 1892. In 1924, it was taken over by the state, and can be said to be the forerunner of today&#x27;s Gymnasium. About 1865, the town established a higher school for girls, and at about the same time, a teacher training school came into being. A new school building was built near the town hall, in the area where the administrative wing for the &quot;Verbandsgemeinde&quot; now stands. After the &quot;Bezirksamt&quot; (now the district administration) was moved to Trierer Straße about 1879, the former tribunal building – later for a time a museum and the town library – could now be used as a schoolhouse. In 1925, the teacher training school was closed. Only temporarily after the Second World War did a teacher training institute once again exist in Kusel, the &quot;Pädagogische Akademie&quot;. It was housed in various buildings throughout the town, in its latest time mainly in a newly built building next to the gymnasium on Lehnstraße, which is now the Realschule. The &quot;Pädagogische Akademie&quot; was moved to Kaiserslautern in 1954. After the Lehnstraße building&#x27;s conversion, the Gymnasium moved in. Within a few years, though, the school had outgrown the building, and an even bigger school building was built on Walkmühlenstraße (“Walking Mill Street”). This now has some 1,100 students. In 1965, the Realschule was established at the Lehnstraße building. Today&#x27;s vocational training schools have their origins in a commercial and agricultural further education school that was founded in 1872. In the days before the First World War, there were departments for particular vocational groups. The school&#x27;s name changed several times. Beginning in 1922, it was called &quot;Fortbildungsschule mit Fachklassen&quot; (“Further Education School with Subject Classes”), and as of 1930, it bore the sesquipedalian name &quot;Berufsfortbildungsschule&quot; (“Vocational Further Education School”). After the school was at first likewise housed in the former tribunal building, it was able to move into a new building on Hollerstraße in 1954. Even this building, though, was soon outgrown. The school, now called &quot;Berufsbildende Schulen&quot; (“Vocational Training Schools”), moved along with the Hauptschule in 1981 to the school centre on the Roßberg. Along with the &quot;Berufsbildende Schulen&quot; there was, as of 1952, the Heitmann private trade school, housed in the former tribunal building. This has since been merged into the &quot;Berufsbildende Schulen&quot;. The special school for children with learning difficulties has existed since 1968. It is nowadays housed in the former vocational school on Hollerstraße and is called the &quot;Jakob-Muth-Schule für Lernbehinderte&quot;. The school now has a branch for children with speech difficulties. Not long before the school for children with learning difficulties, the school for children with mental handicaps was founded, which was later housed in Liebsthal and Blaubach but moved back to Kusel in 1983. It now bears the name &quot;Schule mit Förderschwerpunkt für ganzheitliche Entwicklung&quot; (“School with Promotional Focus on Integrated Development”) and is housed in the building that formerly housed the &quot;Hollerschule&quot;. The &quot;Jakob-Muth-Schule&quot;, the former school for children with mental handicaps, exists today as the &quot;Schule mit Förderschwerpunkt Lernen und Sprache&quot; (“School with Promotional Focus Learning and Speech”) at the building that formerly housed the vocational school on Hollerstraße. The following educational institutions also exist today in Kusel: the folk high school (administered, like all others in the district, directly by the district), the district music school, the educational psychology service, a branch of the &quot;Reha-Zentrum Landstuhl&quot; (rehabilitation), the &quot;Staatliches Studienseminar für das Lehramt an Grund- und Hauptschulen&quot; (state teacher training college for primary and secondary levels), a Realschule plus and a Wirtschaftsgymnasium, the last two both at the school centre on the Roßberg. There are also a few other kindergartens. A district and town library is run in joint sponsorship with the district.

===Transport===
Kusel was from the Middle Ages an important way station on the through road leading from Zweibrücken to Meisenheim. In the 19th century, this road lost its original importance with the laying of the Landstuhl–Kusel railway that linked Kusel to Kaiserslautern, which at first was used mainly to transport crushed stone from the quarries in Rammelsbach. The railway was demanded by industrialists and businessmen from Kusel. A further improvement was brought by the Glan Valley Railway when it arrived in the early 20th century. There were rumours, too, that a north-south railway line through Kusel was to be built, but this was never done. Roads of regional importance, foremost among them the &quot;Glantalstraße&quot; (Glan valley road), were expanded in the 19th century. Fundamentally improved were the transport conditions in the time before the Second World War, when the &quot;Westwall&quot; (Siegfried Line) was built. The railway was extended to Türkismühle with a spur to Ottweiler (&quot;Ostertalbahn&quot;), although abandonment of this line began in 1963 and was completed by 1969. More effective was the building of an army road from Oppenheim to Neunkirchen in the Saarland. This is the road now known as &quot;Bundesstraße&quot; 420 and it runs through Kusel, leading from Nierstein in Rhenish Hesse to Ottweiler in the Saarland. Roughly 7 km to the east, in Konken, is an interchange onto the Autobahn A 62 (Kaiserslautern–Trier), whose completion finally furnished a link to a north-south road. Local public transport is integrated into the VRN, which offers service using &quot;Rheinland-Pfalz-Takt&quot; (“Rhineland-Palatinate scheduling”). Run since the timetabling change in December 2008 are Deutsche Bahn AG trains of the Talent type. Since line closures in 1970 (&quot;Westrichbahn&quot;) and 1981 (part of the &quot;Glantalbahn&quot;), Kusel station has been the terminus of the &quot;Glantalbahn&quot; rail service, which runs to Kaiserslautern over the Landstuhl–Kusel railway.

::A medical doctor, Koch came from the well known family of officials named Koch and was long a governmental councillor in the County Palatine of Zweibrücken, later settling down in Kusel as a doctor. He became known for his vehement criticism of Kusel’s officialdom, whom he accused of great contributory negligence in the great fire of 1794. He put down his allegations in the writ &quot;Spezies Facti&quot;, which appeared soon after the town was burnt down. After the fire, Koch moved to Neuwied.
* Karl Philipp Koch (b. 1737; d. 1813 in Kusel)

He took over the office of church steward for the &quot;Oberamt&quot; of Lichtenberg from his father. He, too, like his brother, was known in connection with the great fire of 1794. After the fire, he moved with two other townsmen from Kusel, Hans Matzenbacher and Philipp Gouturier, to Paris, to receive compensation from the welfare board for Kusel townsmen (it had been the French who had burnt the town down).

Moreover, he also put together collections of birds and beetles. All his collections met with great regard. Koch bequeathed them to the Universities of Munich and Erlangen. Also by Koch were two important scientific works: &quot;Crustaceen, Myriapoden und Arachniden, ein Beitrag zur deutschen Fauna&quot;, 40 issues from 1835 to 1844, and &quot;Die Arachniden, getreu nach der Natur abgebildet und beschrieben&quot; in 16 volumes with 543 coloured tables, Nuremberg 1831-1849.

His theoretical discussions on the problems of Himalayan expeditions form a basis for modern mountaineering in high ranges that recommend forgoing large expeditions and instead putting individual effort in the fore. At the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, Bauer received a gold medal for the books about mountains that he had published.

<text>The 2004 United States presidential election in Ohio took place on November 2, 2004, and was part of the 2004 United States presidential election. Voters chose 20 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. Ohio was won by incumbent President George W. Bush by a 2.11% margin of victory. Prior to the election, most news organizations considered Ohio as a swing state. The state&#x27;s economic situation gave hope for John Kerry. In the end, the state became the deciding factor of the entire election. Kerry conceded the state, and the entire election, the morning following election night, as Bush won the state and its 20 electoral votes.

The close contest was the subject of the 2006 documentary film &quot;...So Goes the Nation&quot;, the title of which is a reference to Ohio&#x27;s 2004 status as a crucial swing state. Had Kerry won the state, he would have won the presidency with 272 electoral votes despite losing the popular vote, and would have been the first Democrat to achieve this feat; this also meant that if Bush lost the state, he would have lost re-election with 266 electoral votes, and been a one-term president despite winning the popular vote, which would have made him the first Republican to achieve this feat.

As of the 2024 U.S. presidential election, this is the last time Ohio voted more Democratic than the nation as a whole, as well as the last time where Hamilton County, the home of Cincinnati, voted for a Republican presidential candidate. Bush became the first Republican to win the White House without carrying Stark County since Benjamin Harrison in 1888.

* 2004 Ohio Democratic presidential primary

==Campaign==
===Predictions===
There were 12 news organizations that made state-by-state predictions of the election. Here are their last predictions before election day.

===Polling===
Pre-election polling showed a lot of volatility throughout the general election. In September, Bush was gaining momentum here, reaching over 50% in several polls and even reaching double digit margins in some. By October, Kerry gained back momentum as he started winning many of the polls, leading with from 48% to as high as 50%. The last 3 polls averaged Kerry leading 49% to 48%.

===Fundraising===
Bush raised $7,349,944, while Kerry raised $3,428,504.

===Advertising and visits===
Both candidates campaigned heavily. Bush visited the state 18 times to Kerry&#x27;s 23 times. Almost every week, over $10 million was spent on television advertising.

==Analysis==
CNN&#x27;s exit polling showed that Bush barely won the state. He won with 52% among male voters, while it was tied 50–50 among female voters. 53% of the voters approved of Bush&#x27;s job as president. Bush dominated in the rural areas, while Kerry dominated and won most of the counties with large populations. Overall, Bush won most of the counties and congressional districts in the state. All the congressional districts Kerry won were in the northern section of the state.

==Results==
===By county===


==== Counties that flipped from Democratic to Republican ====
* Clark (largest municipality: Springfield)

====Counties that flipped from Republican to Democratic====
* Stark (largest municipality: Canton)

===By congressional district===
Bush won 13 of 18 congressional districts, including one held by a Democrat.
==Electors==
Technically the voters of Ohio cast their ballots for electors: representatives to the Electoral College. Ohio is allocated 20 electors because it has 18 congressional districts and 2 senators. All candidates who appear on the ballot or qualify to receive write-in votes must submit a list of 20 electors, who pledge to vote for their candidate and his or her running mate. Whoever wins the majority of votes in the state is awarded all 20 electoral votes. Their chosen electors then vote for president and vice president. Although electors are pledged to their candidate and running mate, they are not obligated to vote for them. An elector who votes for someone other than his or her candidate is known as a faithless elector. The electors of each state and the District of Columbia met on December 13, 2004, to cast their votes for president and vice president. The Electoral College itself never meets as one body. Instead the electors from each state and the District of Columbia met in their respective capitols. The following were the members of the Electoral College from the state. All 20 were pledged for Bush/Cheney.

== Objection to certification of Ohio&#x27;s electoral votes ==

On January 6, 2005, Senator Barbara Boxer joined Representative Stephanie Tubbs Jones of Ohio in filing a congressional objection to the certification of Ohio&#x27;s Electoral College votes due to alleged irregularities including disqualification of provisional ballots, alleged misallocation of voting machines, and disproportionately long waits in predominantly African-American communities. Ohio&#x27;s polling locations and equipment are determined by two Democrats and two Republicans serving on the county&#x27;s Board of Elections, which ensures that any decision made about polling resources is bipartisan. The Senate voted the objection down 74–1; the House voted the objection down 267–31. At the time, it was only the second congressional objection to an entire U.S. state&#x27;s electoral delegation in American history; the first instance was in 1877, when all the electors from three Southern states in the 1876 United States presidential election were challenged, and one from Oregon. The third instance was in 2021, when Republicans objected to the certification of the electors from Arizona and Pennsylvania. An objection to a single faithless elector was also filed in 1969.

<text>Papagomys is a genus of very large rats in the tribe Rattini of the subfamily Murinae, with body masses of . It contains two species, which are known only from the Indonesian island of Flores:

*Flores giant rat &quot;Papagomys armandvillei&quot;
*Verhoeven&#x27;s giant rat &quot;Papagomys theodorverhoeveni&quot; (possibly extinct, only known from subfossil remains)
A possible unnamed third species is also known from subfossil remains.

Both species have records extending to the early Late Pleistocene. The species are thought to be terrestrial, preferring closed habitats, with &quot;P. armandvillei&quot; known to engage in burrowing. They are thought to be omnivores, consuming leaves, fruit and invertebrates.

<doc id="1304652" wikidata="Q2621636" url="?curid=1304652" title="The Yellow Album">
<text>The Yellow Album is &quot;The Simpsons&quot;″ second album of originally recorded songs, released as a follow-up to the 1990 album &quot;The Simpsons Sing the Blues&quot;. Though it was released in 1998, it had been recorded years earlier, after the success of the first album. The title is a play on the name of the Beatles&#x27; self-titled 1968 album, commonly known as &quot;The White Album&quot;, with the skin color of the characters of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. In addition, the cover is a parody of the Beatles&#x27; 1967 album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;.

The parody was also used for a couch gag in Season 8 &quot;Simpsons&quot; episodes &quot;Bart After Dark&quot; and &quot;The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show&quot; (until it was replaced in reruns of the latter episode with the couch gag from &quot;Kamp Krusty&quot;, where the Simpsons find the Flintstones on their couch and Fred invites Homer to sit with him). A similar version of it is on the inside of the United Kingdom version of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; Season 9 DVD. An outtake named &quot;My Name Is Bart&quot; is a parody of musician Prince&#x27;s 1992 single &quot;My Name Is Prince&quot;. In 1993, it was also reported that Matt Groening had penned a rap song to be performed by Bart.

James L. Brooks, producer of the show, wanted to produce a follow-up album based on the popular reception of the debut, but creator Matt Groening was against it. The cast then recorded &quot;The Yellow Album&quot;, but it was not released until 1998, at which time it suffered poor reception. The album was to be released in February 1993 and feature Prince, Linda Ronstadt, and C+C Music Factory. Plans were in the works for music videos to accompany &quot;The Yellow Album&quot;.

==Production==
Greg Haver cowrote and produced &quot;Ten Commandments of Bart&quot;.

==Album artwork==
The &quot;Yellow Album&quot; cover artwork, illustrated by Bill Morrison (although signed by Matt Groening as with all &quot;Simpsons&quot; promotional art), is a parody of the cover art for the Beatles album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, replaced with characters from &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.

In 2005, the artist and designer Kaws (commissioned by Nigo) created &quot;The Kaws Album&quot;, a &quot;traced interpretation&quot; of &quot;The Yellow Album&quot;. In 2019, Sotheby&#x27;s auction house in Hong Kong sold &quot;The Kaws Album&quot; for 115.9 million Hong Kong dollars, or about $14.7 million U.S. dollars, a new auction record for the artist at the time. &quot;Yellow Album&quot; artist Bill Morrison felt &quot;ripped off&quot; by this, re-igniting a conversation about the appropriation of commercial illustrations for fine art (see Roy Lichtenstein).

==Critical reception==

There was some hype leading up to the release of the album. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; writer David Browne said he &quot;eagerly await[ed]&quot; it in March 1993, a month before it was set to be released.

Nevertheless, the album received mixed to negative reviews. &quot;The Star-Telegram&quot; compared the album to the &quot;South Park&quot; album &quot;Chef Aid&quot;, arguing that &quot;the subversion [included in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;South Park&quot;] is only skin-deep, especially when both shows thrive on the type of money-grubbing merchandising that results in junk like &quot;Chef Aid: The South Park Album&quot; and &quot;The Simpsons The Yellow Album&quot;, both released just in time for Christmas.&quot; The &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot; said the album &quot;is an uninspired collection whose best feature is a too-tiny takeoff on the cover of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;,&quot; noting that songs such as &quot;Ten Commandments of Bart&quot; sounded dated, though others like &quot;Sisters Are Doin&#x27; It for Themselves&quot; are praiseworthy.

==Track listing==

&quot;My Name Is Bart&quot; is a bonus track only found on promotional copies of the album.

<doc id="1304654" wikidata="Q14711273" url="?curid=1304654" title="Reed Arena">
<text>Reed Arena is a sports arena and entertainment venue located at the corner of Olsen Boulevard and Kimbrough Boulevard in College Station, Texas. This facility is used for Texas A&amp;M University basketball games and commencement ceremonies, concerts, trade shows, family entertainment, and Texas A&amp;M student programs, including the on-campus Aggie Muster. The building replaced the G. Rollie White Coliseum, and is named for Dr. &amp; Mrs. Chester J. Reed, a 1947 A&amp;M graduate whose donations made the new arena possible.

In 2005, Reed Arena served as the site of men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s first round NIT games, as the men played Clemson and the women played Tulsa.

In recent years, Reed Arena has gained a reputation as one of the most hostile arenas in the nation, coinciding with the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s Aggie basketball teams&#x27; rise to national prominence. This is partly due to a group of students calling themselves the Reed Rowdies, which have been instrumental in helping to create an energetic fan atmosphere during basketball games similar to that of football games at Kyle Field.

==Facilities==
Reed Arena first opened its doors in 1998 as a member of Texas A&amp;M Special Event Facilities. The arena was named after its primary donor Chester J. Reed, Texas A&amp;M Class of 1947. The building hosts many official functions for Texas A&amp;M University. With enough indoor seating capacity for 12,500 guests, the arena makes an ideal location for the university&#x27;s graduation ceremonies, freshmen convocation, and Aggie Muster ceremonies. The main purpose behind building the arena was to house the Texas A&amp;M&#x27;s men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams. However, unlike all the other athletic facilities on campus, Reed Arena operates under the Department of Finance, not the Athletic Department.

While in the planning stages, Chester Reed donated an operations endowment to help run the building during its first five years. However, due to initial over-estimating of revenue and budget shortfalls during construction, this endowment was unable to make the arena become self-sufficient. For all of these reasons mentioned above, Reed Arena cannot just focus on basketball and other university events. As a necessary function, the Arena has developed pipelines of support from a multitude of different stakeholders and events that operate both within the local community and internationally. In its many years of operation, Reed Arena has hosted a wide variety of famous performers including Bill Cosby, Garth Brooks, The Dixie Chicks, as well as the performers of WWE, Cirque du Soleil, and Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus.

The $36 million Reed Arena was designed by the Houston firm Lockwood, Andrews, and Newman, Inc. and built in 1998 by Dallas-based Huber, Hunt and Nichols, Inc. The arena has seats for 12,989 fans, while an additional 2,000 people can be accommodated on the main floor for concerts.

Reed Arena is able to provide group accommodations on many different levels. Events can greatly vary in size; the Arena can accommodate an event involving thousands of patrons or a small meeting that contains only 15 participants on any given day. The arena floor contains of column-free space, large enough to accommodate 150 exhibit booths or a 1,800 seat banquet. This figure almost doubles the space any other building in the Bryan/College Station area. The second floor contains four rooms, which can be used to accommodate smaller events. The lower level of the arena also contains a multi-purpose room, a full-service commercial kitchen, and numerous types of dressing rooms.

===Cox-McFerrin Center===
In February 2006, the 12th Man Foundation, a fund raising organization associated with Texas A&amp;M Athletics, announced plans for an effort to build the Cox-McFerrin Center, a addition to Reed Arena, providing new men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball locker rooms, practice gyms, and player lounges. On February 2, 2007, the A&amp;M System Board of Regents approved a revised plan, increasing the size of the facility to and a total cost of $21.5 million.

<doc id="1304657" wikidata="Q1016730" url="?curid=1304657" title="Gejiu">
<text>Geiju () (, ; Hani: &quot;Goqjef&quot;; formerly known as Kochiu) is a county-level city in Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province, China, with 202,000 urban inhabitants (ranked 14th largest city in Yunnan). It is the site of China&#x27;s largest tin deposits and its main industry is mining.

==Location==
Gejiu is located on the top of a mountain to the north of the Red River (pinyin &quot;Hong He&quot;) valley, which flows from Xiangyun, Yunnan, to Vietnam. To the southwest in this valley is Nansha, which lies directly below the town of Yuanyang. To the northwest of Gejiu lies Jianshui County, and to the north, Jijie Town, one of its subordinate towns. Mengzi, the capital city of Honghe prefecture, lies 12 miles east of Gejiu.

==Layout==
The town is located in a crater-like depression around a lake on top of a mountain. The main road enters the town from the north through a thin pass. To the east and west are steep cliffs. Those to the west are too steep to inhabit, however, extensive new construction along the eastern suburbs has created many new residential areas.

==Administrative divisions==
Administratively, the County-level City of Gejiu consists of 10 township level units: 
* 2 subdistricts :Chengqu (城区街道), which includes the urban district, and Datun (大屯街道);
* 6 towns: Xicheng (錫城镇), Shadian (沙甸镇), Jijie (雞街镇), Laochang (老廠镇), Kafang (卡房镇), and Manhao (蔓耗镇);
* 2 townships: Jiasha (贾沙乡) and Baohe (保和乡)

== History ==
Originally, Gejiu was called &quot;Gejiuli,&quot; which is a small mining settlement in Yunnan Province . Under the Yuan (1206–1368) and Ming (1368–1644) dynasties the mining of silver started.

In the late 17th and 18th centuries, mining in Yunnan boomed, but tin mining in Gejiu did not develop until the second half of the 18th century.

In the 1880s, Gejiu was established as a subprefecture (廳) under Mengzi County, which was about east of the former.

In 1889, Mengzi was opened as a treaty port to serve as a gateway for trade between the Qing Government and what was then French Indochina.

It was not until the French in Vietnam built the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway in 1910 when Gejiu began to develop. One of the main purposes in constructing this railway was to service the mine trading.

During the last years of the Qing dynasty, the mining of tin was organized by the Chinese-owned Gejiu Tin Company, but the company was deficient in capital, technical skill, and managerial efficiency and therefore was replaced by a joint state-private company, Gejiu Tin-Mining Company, under which production boomed.

After the 1911 Revolution, Gejiu was further developed due to its location up in the mountains, surrounded by abundant tin deposits.

A branch line was built from Gejiu to Mengzi between 1915 and 1928 to better serve the transport needs of the tin mine.

By the 1930s, Gejiu tin accounted for 80 percent of the traffic exported on the railway. Tin production is said to have reached 10,000 tons in 1938.

After 1949, the management passed to the state-owned Yunnan Tin-Mining Corporation, which by 1955 had reached and exceeded the pre-war production figures. In addition to the city&#x27;s tin mine, which remained the chief product, Gejiu had also become a major producer of lead, and a thriving metallurgical industry has been developed. Tin articles made in Gejiu were highly acclaimed in China. Coal for smelting was supplied to the city from nearby Kaiyuan to the north, located on the rail line to Kunming. There is some engineering and chemical production closely allied with Gejiu&#x27;s metallurgical industries.

Today, Gejiu is a relatively modern prosperous county-level city in Yunnan, with a lakeside setting and with a backdrop of rocky hills.

== Landforms ==
The city of Gejiu surrounds a lake which, however, was not naturally formed. A turning point in the city&#x27;s history was when a mining accident occurred sometime in the 1950s, when water welled up through the mines which led to groundwater rising to the surface, and this flooded a large part of the narrow valley that the city was located in. This accident may well have turned out to be a blessing in disguise for Gejiu, as it provided a nice scenic lake right in the city center. An already cramped upland location became even more cramped after this flood, which has resulted in an extremely dense, high-rise center compared to other small Chinese cities that are built on plains. Later, the adjacent area to the flood-caused lake was turned into a park. Today, the town is protected from further flooding by an underground spillway.

==Climate==
It is a typical subtropical highland climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;), with a low temperature variation but cold for latitude.

==Ethnography==
The populace is primarily Han Chinese. However, minorities such as the Muslim Hui, Dai from the nearby Red River valley, and Hani from the surrounding mountains (see Yuanyang) are also present.

==Economy==
In addition to tin reserves, iron and coal are also found in Gejiu.

==Welfare==
The city is the home of the Gejiu Children&#x27;s Welfare Institute, an orphanage for Yunnan children.

<text>Novae was initially one of the few great Roman legionary fortresses along the empire&#x27;s border, forming part of the defences (limes Moesiae) along the Danube in northern Bulgaria. The settlement later expanded into a town in the Roman province of Moesia Inferior, later Moesia Secunda.

It lies about 4 km east of the modern town of Svishtov.

The fortress is one of the few along the &quot;limes&quot; to have been excavated and now open to the public. 

==Location and topography==

Novae is situated on the southern bank of the Danube at Pametnicite near Svishtov.

The legionary fortress (&quot;castra legionis&quot;) covers an area of 18 hectares on a slope towards the river-bank, its highest point in the southern part of the site being 30m higher. Its topography resulted in terraced levels within the defensive walls.

At present mainly the central part of the site has been excavated and restored.

==History and archaeology==

Permanent Roman military presence in the Lower Danubian region started after Augustus had established himself as sole ruler of the Roman state in 30 BC and adopted a strategy to move the empire&#x27;s south-eastern European border from Macedonia to the line of the Danube providing a major river supply route between the Roman armies in the region. Marcus Licinius Crassus fought a successful campaign against the Moesi and Augustus formally proclaimed victory in 27 BC. The region was organised as the Roman province of Moesia in the last years of Augustus&#x27; reign, around 6 AD.

Around 45 AD Legio VIII Augusta took part in the suppression of the Thracian uprising, and founded its fortress at Novae. The site was chosen to control a river crossing and the key section of the Danube from the mouth of the Osum River (Asamus) up to the mouth of the Yantra River, near Iatrus, a choice that was justified by later successes.

After the death of Nero, the dislocation of many legions within the Empire resulted in replacement by emperor Vespasian in 69–70 AD of Legio VIII Augusta by Legio I Italica, which stayed in Novae at least to the 430s. In 86 the province was divided and Novae, together with Durostorum, became one of two legionary bases within the borders of Moesia Inferior. During the Dacian wars of Domitian (85–89) Novae did not suffer significant damage, which may indicate that the main operations took place in the western and eastern part of the province. The legion was followed by craftsmen, servicemen, traders and other camp followers who settled down in the fortress vicinity creating the canabae legionis. At the same time another settlement (vicus) emerged ca. 3 km to the east of the camp, in the place Ostrite Mogili

Novae served as a base of operations for Roman campaigns against Barbarian tribes including Trajan&#x27;s Dacian Wars, and the last time during Maurice&#x27;s Balkan campaigns. The legion was also responsible for bridge construction over the Danube.

Until the Flavian period the fortress walls were built from earth and wood. During the campaigns of Trajan the walls were replaced by stone wall up to 3m thick with square towers. Apart from the new defensive walls, the monumental building of headquarters (principia) with the new Trajanic basilica, and the new building of a hospital (valetudinarium) were built at the place of the former Flavian baths (thermae). It is possible that during the Antonine period the legion controlled the area beyond the Yantra River. The most prosperous times for Novae, as well as for the province, were during the Severan dynasty.

In 250 Novae was attacked by the Goths of Cniva but escaped damage, although the canabae and the nearby settlements were completely destroyed. In the second half of the 3rd century Novae was systematically attacked and destroyed by &quot;barbarians&quot;. From the 4th century onwards when the legion was divided into detachments occupying small forts and fortlets, civil buildings constituted the main part of internal buildings of Novae. The new streets with pavements were built from re-used stone, often bearing inscriptions. Many glass workshops were established, both in the town, as well as in its surroundings. At a certain moment the area of 8 ha to the east of the legionary base was surrounded by the new defensive walls.

The latest evidence for the presence of the legion is dated by a series of inscriptions from 430, 431 and 432.

In the late 5th and 6th centuries Novae was the seat of a bishop. The cathedral and neighbouring buildings were built over the legionary barracks west of the former legionary headquarters. The last period of prosperity was during the reign of Justinian (527–565) when the defensive walls were rebuilt and reinforced, but the attacks of Slavs and Avars eventually end the existence of the ancient town. In 9th–11th centuries the church and a cemetery existed in the western part of the town.

Novae is supposed to be the home of the saint named Lupus, who is venerated in Greek and Romanian traditions.

Recent excavations have revealed the via principalis and other buildings. In 2018, possible Roman soldiers&#x27; burials were discovered near Novae.

==Civilian settlements and the extramural area==
The civil settlement (canabae legionis) were situated to the west of the legionary base. Another civil vicus has been located over 2 km east of the fortress, at Ostrite Mogili. One of the settlements was granted municipal rights, but only one inscription testifies this status. A splendid villa to the west of the defensive walls, within the canabae, could have been an official residence was destroyed by the Gothic invasions in mid-3rd century.

Other minor settlements and places of cult were located but not systematically excavated.

The area to the south-east and east of the fortress was occupied by the necropolis, which was recently excavated., while the military amphitheater is postulated on the north-eastern side of the camp.

Water supply to the fortress, particularly the baths including the nearby &quot;nymphaeum&quot; and to the town was ensured by three known aqueducts, one of which was at least 9 km long and fed the distribution tank (&quot;castellum divisorum&quot;) at the south-east corner of the fortress.

During the late Roman period the town was enlarged by a new line of defensive walls and covered 26 hectares jointly with the former legionary base.

==Name of the site==

Novae (Novae) might have referred to the &quot;canabae (canabae legionis I Italicae Novae)&quot;, when the fortress itself had the name &quot;castra legionis I Italicae&quot;. Literary sources give the name of Novae or, in accusative form Novas, and the Greek transcription Nόβας given by Procopius, Theophanes Confessor and Anonymous Ravennatis. The Greek form Nόβαι appears rather rare; an earlier form mentioned by Ptolemy is Nooῦαι.

One hypothesis derives the name from Νόης &quot;Nóēs&quot;, a river mentioned by Herodotus, which is then identified with the stream (now variously known as &quot;Dermendere&quot;, &quot;Tekirdere&quot;, &quot;Golyamata Bara&quot;, or &quot;Belyanovsko Dere&quot;) at whose mouth the fortress was located.

<doc id="1304685" wikidata="Q88412" url="?curid=1304685" title="Julius Leopold Klein">
<text>Julius Leopold Klein (Hungarian: Klein Gyula Lipót; 1810 – 2 August 1876) was a German writer of Jewish origin born at Miskolc, Hungary.

==Life==
Klein was educated at the gymnasium in Pest, and studied medicine in Vienna and Berlin. After travelling through Italy and Greece, he settled as a man of letters in Berlin, where he remained until his death.

==Works==
He was the author of many dramatic works, among others the historical tragedies &quot;Maria von Medici&quot; (1841), &quot;Luines&quot; (1842), &quot;Zenobia&quot; (1847), &quot;Moreto&quot; (1859), &quot;Maria&quot; (1860), &quot;Strafford&quot; (1862), and &quot;Heliodora&quot; (1867); and the comedies &quot;Die Herzogin&quot; (1848), &quot;Ein Schützling&quot; (1850), and &quot;Voltaire&quot; (1862). The tendency of Klein as a dramatist was to become bombastic and obscure, but many of his characters are vigorously conceived, and in nearly all his tragedies there are passages of brilliant rhetoric.

Klein is chiefly known as the author of the elaborate though uncompleted &quot;Geschichte des Dramas&quot; (1865–1876), in which he undertook to record the history of the drama from the earliest times. He died when about to enter upon the Elizabethan era, to the treatment of which he had looked forward as the chief part of his task. The work, which is in thirteen bulky volumes, gives proof of immense learning, but is marred by eccentricities of style and judgment.

Klein&#x27;s &quot;Dramatische Werke&quot; were collected in 7 vols. (1871–1872).

<text>The Avenger Air Defense System, designated AN/TWQ-1 under the Joint Electronics Type Designation System, is an American self-propelled surface-to-air missile system which provides mobile, short-range air defense protection for ground units against cruise missiles, unmanned aerial vehicles, low-flying fixed-wing aircraft, and helicopters.

The Avenger was originally developed for the United States Armed Forces and is currently used by the U.S. Army. The Avenger system was also used by the U.S. Marine Corps.

==History==
Originally developed as a private venture by Boeing in the 1980s, the Avenger was developed over a period of only 10 months from initial concept to delivery for testing to the U.S. Army. Initial testing was conducted in May 1984 at the Army&#x27;s Yakima Training Center in the U.S. state of Washington. During testing three FIM-92 Stinger missiles were fired. During the first test firing, on April 1984, the system achieved a direct hit while the Avenger was moving at .

The second test firing, conducted at night while stationary, also achieved a direct hit. The third test firing, conducted while on the move and in the rain, did not achieve a direct hit, but did pass within the missile&#x27;s kill range, so the shot was scored as a tactical kill. All three test shots were conducted by operators who had never fired the missile before.

In August 1987, the U.S. Army awarded Boeing the first production contract for 325 units. On 1 November 1988, the first unit was delivered. In 1989, the system began its Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) series of tests. The tests were conducted in two stages with Stage 1 consisting of acquisition and tracking trials at Fort Hunter Liggett, California, and Stage 2 consisting of live-fire testing at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico. In February 1990, the Avenger system was deemed operationally effective and began replacing the M163 and M167 VADS. Two variants were deployed based on the Humvee chassis: M998 HMMWV Avenger and M1097 Heavy HMMWV Avenger.

By January 1997, the Army had received over 900 units of the Avenger system.

The first operational deployment of the system occurred during the buildup for the Persian Gulf War. With the success of this deployment, the U.S. Army signed an additional contract for another 679 vehicles, bringing the total order to 1,004 units. The Avenger was again deployed in support of NATO operations during the Bosnian War. The Avenger system received widespread public exposure when it was placed around the Pentagon during the first anniversary of the September 11 attacks of 2001. The Avenger was also deployed during the U.S. military&#x27;s operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.

In 2004, the U.S. Army had 26 battalions with Avenger Short-Range Air Defense (SHORAD) capabilities, but prioritization of other weapon systems during operations in Afghanistan and Iraq caused that number to drop to nine by early 2017, of which two were within the active force and seven were in the Army National Guard. Of the over 1,100 Avengers built only about 400 remain in service. In March 2018, in response to renewed Russian aggression since the 2014 annexation of Crimea, the 678th Air Defense Artillery Brigade deployed to Europe, the first time an American air defense unit had been sent there since the Cold War. The Army plans to deploy 72 Avenger sets to support U.S. European Command.

During protests regarding the Dakota Access Pipeline near Standing Rock, the North Dakota National Guard deployed an Avenger system as an observation platform. It was employed for over a month to observe areas within Morton County where numerous instances of criminal trespass and mischief had occurred. The unarmed Avenger was used to support public safety in southern Morton County. The Avenger system was removed in order to deescalate any tensions its presence may have caused.

In April 2017, an Avenger fired Stingers at two UAVs in a test on Eglin Air Force Base, marking the missile&#x27;s first interception of a UAV target. While Stingers are usually loaded with direct impact warheads for use against aircraft and cruise missiles, these were equipped with proximity fuzes that enabled them to detonate near the target, giving them the ability to destroy small UAVs. Since small UAVs do not produce large heat signatures, the Avenger uses a laser rangefinder in combination with an antenna on the warhead to direct the missile on target. The Stingers shot down an MQM-170C Outlaw and a smaller, unidentified system, demonstrating the fuze&#x27;s ability to detect and destroy moving mini-drones weighing as little as .

On 30 September 2020, the U.S. Army awarded General Dynamics a contract to deliver the Interim Maneuver SHORAD (IM-SHORAD), a Stryker armored vehicle fitted with heavier weapons to replace the outdated, unarmored, and undergunned Avenger Humvee.

In November 2022, four Avenger air defense systems were included as part of a $400 million military aid package supporting Ukraine during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine to defend critical civilian infrastructure against cruise missile and Iranian-made Shahed-136 lethal drone attacks which were launched by Russia in October 2022. Another eight were included in a package in January 2023. The first arrived in Europe in early February and were seen in service by late March. Ukraine has received in total some 20 units, as of September 2024, with the crews being trained in Europe by United States instructors.

==Overview==
The Avenger comes mainly in three configurations, the Basic, Slew-to-Cue, and the Up-Gun.

The Basic configuration consists of a gyro-stabilized air defense turret mounted on a modified heavy Humvee. The turret has two Stinger missile launcher pods, each capable of firing up to 4 fire-and-forget infrared/ultraviolet guided missiles in rapid succession. The Avenger can be linked to the Forward Area Air Defense Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (FAAD C3I) system, which permits external radar tracks and messages to be passed to the fire unit to alert and cue the gunner.

The Slew-to-Cue (STC) subsystem allows the commander or gunner to select a FAAD C3I reported target for engagement from a display on a Targeting Console developed from VT Miltope&#x27;s Pony PCU. Once the target has been selected, the turret can be automatically slewed directly to the target with limited interaction by the gunner.

The Up-Gun Avenger was developed specifically for the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment for the Regiment&#x27;s 2005 deployment to Iraq. The modification was designed to allow the Avenger to perform unit and asset defense in addition to its air defense mission. The right missile pod was removed and the M3P 12.7 mm (.50) cal machine gun was moved to the pod&#x27;s former position. This allowed for the removal of the turret&#x27;s cab safety limits which enabled the gun to be fired directly in front of the HMMWV. Eight of the unit&#x27;s Avengers were modified to this configuration. With the 3rd ACR&#x27;s redeployment from Iraq, the Up-Gun Avenger completed its role in Operation Iraqi Freedom and the Avengers have been scheduled to be converted back to STC systems.

==Variants==
===Boeing/Shorts Starstreak Avenger===

Boeing teamed with Shorts Brothers PLC (now part of Thales) to offer an Avenger system in which one Stinger pod was replaced with a pod of four Starstreak Hyper-velocity laser-guided missiles, in the hopes of attracting a U.S. Army contract under the Forward Area Air Defense System Line-of-Sight Rear (FAADS-LOS-R) program. Test installation was carried out in mid-1990 and firing trials followed from mid-1991 in the U.K. Starstreak would have complemented the Stinger by improving the overall systems ability to deal with low hovering helicopters which frequently do not provide enough contrast for lock-on by infrared guided missiles. Starstreak also has the ability to be used against un-armored and lightly armored ground vehicles.

===Boeing/Matra Guardian===
In the 1990s Boeing teamed with Matra of France to offer the Avenger modified by the substitution of standard triple launcher boxes for Matra Mistral missiles in place of the quadruple Stinger pods of the standard Avenger. One demonstrator vehicle was built in 1992 and test firings took place in France. The project was dropped around 1997.

===Avengers during the Iraq War===
Due to the lack of serious airborne threats during much of the Iraq War, along with the pressing need for ground assets for combat roles such as convoy protection, the Avenger was pressed into this role. The FLIR/laser rangefinder combined with the 12.7 mm (.50) cal machine gun has proved to be very effective, but was limited by no-fire zones, particularly to the front of the vehicle. A program was instituted to remove one of the missile pods and move the machine gun to that position to enable a 360° field of fire. The upgrade also increased the ammunition capacity to 650 rounds.

===Avenger DEW===
Another potential variant proposed by Boeing is an Avenger with a Directed Energy Weapon (DEW). Boeing completed an initial test of a 1 kW laser mounted where the right missile pod would be. The M3P 12.7 mm (.50) cal has been replaced by the M242 Bushmaster as its close defense weapon.

===Avenger Multi-Role Weapon System===
Test firing demonstrations of this variant took place in 2004. It is modified by re-locating the M3P machine gun over the turret cab to allow a 360-degree field of fire, increasing ready-use machine gun ammunition stowage to 600 rounds, and providing the option to substitute launchers for 2 FGM-148 Javelin missiles in place of 1 Stinger pod.

===Accelerated Improved Interceptor Initiative (AI3)===
In February 2012, Raytheon was awarded a contract to develop the AI3, a modified AIM-9 Sidewinder missile mounted on the Avenger launcher, to perform counter rocket, artillery, mortar (C-RAM), counter unmanned aerial vehicle (C-UAV), and counter cruise missile duties.

In 2013, the US Army decided to not buy the system.

In August 2014, the system successfully intercepted a UAV and cruise missile target featuring a semi-active radar homing seeker in a test.

===Other variants===
Boeing have proposed that the Avenger PMS turret could be mounted on other vehicles such as Unimog truck, BV-206 all-terrain vehicles, M113 APC, and M548 tracked cargo carrier as well as being used as a stationary ground mount on a pallet for defense of static targets. The Avenger PMS has been demonstrated with a mock-up of two 70 mm helicopter-type rocket pods carrying a total of 36 rockets to give the system greater multi-mission utility. Other missiles such as the Bofors RBS 70/Bolide have been proposed for use on the Avenger PMS.

In March 2017, Boeing revealed a modernized Avenger system fitted with AIM-9X Sidewinder and Longbow Hellfire missiles on the sides and a directed energy weapon affixed to the top. It is also planned to be integrated onto other platforms including the JLTV, Stryker, and Bradley Fighting Vehicle. While Boeing had configured a Stryker with the Avenger turret to fulfill the Army&#x27;s Interim Maneuver-Short-Range Air Defense (IM-SHORAD) requirement, the Army ultimately decided against the idea, feeling it would require major modifications to the vehicle and because of the company&#x27;s desire for the service to supply the turrets, of which there were a limited amount existing readily in the inventory.

During a 2017 joint French-Egyptian naval exercise, an AN/TWQ-1 Avenger was mounted onto the helicopter flight deck of a Mistral-class amphibious assault ship to provide ad-hoc close-range air defense. The ship was originally slated to be sold to Russia, but the sale was canceled due to international sanctions imposed on Russia following the Annexation of Crimea. The ship was sold to the Egyptian navy without the originally planned Russian air defense systems.

<doc id="1304709" wikidata="Q3247916" url="?curid=1304709" title="River Alt">
<text>The River Alt is an urban river that flows across Merseyside in England. The river has suffered from heavy pollution from industry and sewage upstream and run-off from farmland in its lower reaches. It empties into the River Mersey, near to where the Mersey itself flows into the Irish Sea. The river has benefited from clean-up schemes and a de-culverting process to improve its water quality and provide a better environment for wildlife.

==Etymology==

The river&#x27;s name might be of Latin origin (meaning &quot;muddy river&quot;) but the banks of the river are lined by villages and places with names of Old Norse derivation. The name &quot;Alt&quot; could also be derived from Brittonic &quot;alt&quot;, which can either mean &#x27;cliff&#x27; or as is more likely in this case, &#x27;burn, mountain stream&#x27; (Welsh allt, Irish &quot;ált&quot;). Thirdly, the obscure Celtic element &quot;*al-&quot;, suffixed with the Brittonic nominal suffix &quot;-ed&quot; may underlie this name.

==Route==
The Alt runs from Hag Plantation in Huyton at , through Croxteth Park, roughly follows the M57 motorway south of Kirkby, then flows north of Aintree and south of Maghull. It then runs south of Formby and empties into the Irish Sea, near the edge of the River Mersey estuary at Hightown.

The Alts upper waters deriving from small streams and, in particular, one arising at Hag Plantation in Huyton. This is the location of the primary source of the river and is also the Huyton Wetlands Site of Biological Interest (SBI). The Alt then flows at a low gradient across an alluvium plain in a northwesterly direction before turning southwards and emptying into the River Mersey at Hightown between Crosby and Formby.

The Alt&#x27;s catchment boundary reaches as far as Banks and Crossens in the north and out to Burscough and Kirkby in the east. It drains a catchment area of and flows a distance of from source to the Mersey Estuary.

The river flows through varying types of land: Sherwood Sandstone in the Huyton area, Coal Measures in the West Derby area and eventually Mercia Mudstone in the Maghull/North Sefton area. The estuary forms part of the Ribble and Alt Estuaries Special Protection Area for wildlife.

Before the installation of tidal floodgates at Hightown in the 18th Century, the river was once called a &quot;troublesome little river&quot; its ever changing course cutting through the field boundaries, threatening roads and bridges and was rumoured to have wiped out the hamlet of Altmouth sometime between 1577 and 1713. However, studies of mapping have shown that there was never a village symbol at Altmouth on the maps, although one mapman stated there was a village there, but was unclear as to if it was on the north or south side of the river mouth. Flooding along the river was a problem until the 1960s when work to straighten and canalise the river, plus the opening of pumping stations at Crossens in 1959 and Altmouth in 1972, ended the regular inundation of fields by water from the sources and from the sea. The river downstream of Maghull is rich agricultural land, but of it is below sea level and so requires the pumping stations to prevent tidal incursions into the river. The river was once well known for its fish and large quantities of eels were trapped upstream and in its tributaries. Flatfish like dabs, plaice and flounder were caught in the estuary and the tidal reaches, vast cockle beds were worked in the estuary.

The river began to change in the early 20th century as Liverpool expanded and industry, then new housing began to grow along its banks. By the 1970s, the pollution had affected the river so much, it was listed as being class 3 or 4, which meant that apart from bloodworms, there was no life in the river. Part of this problem lies with when the river was culverted and housing was erected near to and over the river, the wastewater pipes from the dwellings were wrongly connected to discharge their water directly into the river.

New sewage farms at Croxteth and Hillhouse plus modernisation to existing sewage farms and the decrease in heavy industry in Knowsley, Kirkby and Aintree began to clean up the river and by the early 1990s freshwater fish began to colonise the river from tributaries like Sudell Brook and Downholland Brook. By 2000, the river was well known among local anglers for its healthy population of pike, chub, bream, roach and sticklebacks. Herons, kingfishers and, in summer, egrets can often be seen in the water. In 2016, the Environment Agency released 9,000 fish into the river to replenish stocks.

The Alt is still not clean due to its heritage as a handy dumping ground for sewage and industrial waste. Currently it has a moderate ecological rating but a fail rating for chemicals due to heavy metals in its silt. However, in 2006, the amount of wildlife that lived in and around the river earned it a clean bill of health from the Environment Agency.

===Improvements===
In 1996, a long, and a wide section of the river flowing through Knowsley, was rehabilitated from a straight, narrow stretch of water into a low floodplain where the water would spread out into several courses over the plain. The main channel was diverted and several smaller channels were created by the addition of berms to separate them. This has allowed plants to thrive and offers a floodplain where there was not one before.

In June 2014, a new section of the river was de-culverted and was lengthened through the addition of bends to improve the river&#x27;s quality and also provide a greenspace for the nearby residents of Croxteth. Initially tied in with a development plan connected with Stonebridge Cross, the section was opened to daylight to create a meandering riverside that stretched to and would help when the river was in flood as well as improve the area for wildlife.

<text>Omar Amin (born Johann Jakob von Leers; 25 January 19025 March 1965) was an &quot;Alter Kämpfer&quot; and an honorary &quot;Sturmbannführer&quot; in the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; in Nazi Germany, where he was also a professor known for his anti-Jewish polemics. He was one of the most important ideologues of the Third Reich, serving as a high-ranking propaganda ministry official. He later served in the Egyptian Information Department, as well as an advisor to Gamal Abdel Nasser. He published for Goebbels, in Peron&#x27;s Argentina, and for Nasser&#x27;s Egypt. He converted to Islam, and changed his name to Omar Amin.
==Early life and education==
Johann von Leers was born in Vietlübbe, in the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Germany on 25 January 1902. He studied law at the universities of Berlin, Kiel, and Rostock, and eventually worked as an attache in the German Foreign Office. He joined the Viking League Free Corps and then Adler und Falke. Leers became actively involved in völkisch politics during the Weimar Republic and joined the Nazi Party in 1929. He was a district speaker and leader of the National Socialist Students&#x27; League, and in 1933 signed the Gelöbnis treuester Gefolgschaft, the &quot;vow of most faithful allegiance&quot; to Adolf Hitler.

==Career==
===Weimar Republic===
During the late 1920s, Leers was the leading foreign policy critic of the Strasserist wing of the Nazi Party and was a staunch critic of Alfred Rosenberg.

===Nazi Germany===
Supporting himself by writing freelance articles for the Nazi Party press, after the Nazis came to power in 1933, Leers was summoned by Joseph Goebbels to work in the propaganda ministry, where he was assigned to proliferate party propaganda, eventually penning 27 books between 1933 and 1945.

Leers was a proponent of &quot;realpolitik&quot;, advocating a race-free foreign relations policy on the basis of relationship and alliance. He wrote the memo which led to the exemption of non-Jewish racial minorities from race laws in the Third Reich in 1934, 1936, and 1937.

In 1936, Leers was commissioned into the Waffen-SS as an under-&quot;Sturmbannführer&quot;, eventually becoming a full honorary &quot;Sturmbannführer&quot;. He went on to serve as a lecturer at the University of Jena. 

Leers wrote the notorious anti-Semitic tract (published and popular during the Third Reich), &quot;Juden sehen dich an&quot; (&quot;Jews Are Looking at You&quot;). He was fluent in five languages, including Dutch and Japanese.

Jeffrey Herf reports that in December 1942 Leers published an article in &quot;Die Judenfrage&quot;, a journal which belonged to the anti-Semitic intellectual world, entitled &quot;Judaism and Islam as Opposites&quot;. As the title indicates, the author&#x27;s perspective is Hegelian, presenting Judaism and Islam in terms of thesis and antithesis. This essay also reveals the ingratiating National Socialist perspective which Leers projected on the Islamic past, as well as the intensity of his hatred for Judaism and Jewry. The following passage is part of the original text:

:Mohammed&#x27;s hostility to the Jews had one result: Oriental Jewry was completely paralyzed. Its backbone was broken. Oriental Jewry effectively did not participate in [European] Jewry&#x27;s tremendous rise to power in the last two centuries. Despised in the filthy lanes of the mellah (the walled Jewish quarter of a Moroccan city, analogous to the European ghetto) the Jews vegetated there. They lived under a special law (that of a protected minority), which in contrast to Europe did not permit usury or even traffic in stolen goods, but kept them in a state of oppression and anxiety. If the rest of the world had adopted a similar policy, we would not have a Jewish Question... As a religion, Islam indeed performed an eternal service to the world: it prevented the threatened conquest of Arabia by the Jews and vanquished the horrible teaching of Jehovah by a pure religion, which at that time opened the way to a higher culture for numerous peoples ...

===After the Second World War===
In 1945, Leers fled from Germany to Italy, where he lived for five years, then in 1950 migrated to Argentina, where he continued his propaganda activities. During this period he was a contributor to &quot;Der Weg&quot;, a Nazi publication founded in Buenos Aires in 1947. He was praised by Haj Amin al-Husseini, Grand Mufti of Jerusalem and a Nazi wartime ally, for his loyalty to Arab nationalism. Thereafter he moved from Argentina to Egypt.

In Buenos Aires, Leers became editor of &quot;Der Weg&quot; and praised the American neo-fascist Francis Parker Yockey and his book for its understanding of Russia, which was heavily influenced by Oswald Spengler&#x27;s concept of &quot;pseudomorphosis&quot;.

The Swedish journalist and writer Elisabeth Åsbrink probed the reasons for Sweden&#x27;s centrality in the European far-right scene in her book &quot;1947: When Now Begins&quot;. In it, she portrays Per Engdahl (1909–1994), the leader of the Swedish fascist movement, who created an escape route for Nazis from all parts of Europe. This route passed through northern Germany and Denmark, leading to Malmö in Sweden. From there, the fleeing Nazis were smuggled to various places in southern Sweden and then sent by ship from Gothenburg to South America. Engdahl claimed to have &quot;saved&quot; about 4,000 Nazis in this way. One of those whom Engdahl assisted was Johann von Leers, who &quot;arrived in Malmö in 1947, and ... got to Buenos Aires, where he edited a paper that became a communications channel between Nazis in Europe and those who ended up in Latin America&quot;.

Leers was later persuaded to migrate to Egypt by Haj Amin al-Husseini, who by then was a Palestinian leader living in Egypt, with whom he was in close contact. There, he converted to Islam and changed his name to Omar Amin, as a gesture to his benefactor, and became the political adviser to the Information Department under Muhammad Naguib and Gamal Abdel Nasser, as well as being friendly with al-Husseini. Eventually he became the head of President Nasser&#x27;s &#x27;Israeli&#x27; propaganda unit and served as head of the Institute for the Study of Zionism, managing anti-Israeli propaganda. Leers was a mentor of Ahmed Huber and networked with Muslim emigres in Hamburg, while also being an acquaintance of Otto Ernst Remer in the country.

Leers died in Egypt on 5 March 1965, aged 63. His remains were returned to Germany at the expense of the Egyptian government and in June 1965 were buried in Schutterwald, in an islamic funeral.

Lin began her career as a commercial model in 1993 and gained pan-Asian prominence for her role as Xia Ziwei in the megahit TV series &quot;My Fair Princess&quot; (1998-1999). She followed the success with TV series such as &quot;The Duke of Mount Deer&quot; (2000), &quot;Romance in the Rain&quot; (2001), &quot;Boy &amp; Girl&quot; (2003), &quot;Affair of Half a Lifetime&quot; (2004), &quot;Beauty&#x27;s Rival in Palace&quot; (2010), &quot;The Glamorous Imperial Concubine&quot; (2011) and &quot;The Way We Were&quot; (2014). While focusing mostly on TV, she also starred in films such as &quot;The House That Never Dies&quot; (2014), &quot;The Devotion of Suspect X&quot; (2017) and &quot;Miss Andy&quot; (2020). As a singer, she released six albums, beginning with &quot;Heartbeat&quot; (1999). 

Since Lin started her own studio in 2009, she has been producing TV dramas and TV films starring herself, both in mainland China and Taiwan. Her production debut &quot;The Glamorous Imperial Concubine&quot; (2011) won her Best Producer at the 2012 TV Drama Awards Made in China, and her first Taiwanese drama production &quot;The Way We Were&quot; (2014) won three out of seven nominations, including Best Television Series at the 50th Golden Bell Awards.

According to &quot;Apple Daily&quot;, Lin was the third highest-earning Taiwanese drama actress in 2011, and the top-earner in 2012 and 2013. Lin ranked 30th on &quot;Forbes&quot; China Celebrity 100 list in 2013, 36th in 2014, 82nd in 2015, and 68th in 2017.

==Early life==
Lin was born and raised in Wugu, New Taipei City, Taiwan. Her father was a businessman, and her mother a housewife. Her English name, Ruby, is from her mother&#x27;s love of the jewel. As the eldest of four children in family, Lin has two younger brothers—one a year younger and the other six years younger—and a half-sister, ten years younger, from her father’s second marriage after divorcing from Lin&#x27;s mother when Lin was 7. After her parents&#x27; divorce, Lin lived with her mother, who took her to visit relatives in Japan every year. She graduated from Ri Xin Primary School and Zhong Dian High School. Lin originally planned on going to the United Kingdom to study after high school graduation. However, she was discovered by a talent agent at the age of seventeen, during her second year in high school, and started working as a part-time commercial model. Her first TV commercial was for a tea brand in 1994.

Lin’s parents were initially opposed to her involvement in the entertainment industry. After appearing in several commercials, her parents eventually agreed to let her sign with an entertainment-management company. She officially joined Jessie and Jones Entertainment Ltd on her 20th birthday, shortly after graduating from high school.

==Career==

===Early work: 1995–1996===
When Lin received her first experience in front of the camera in 1995, for a minor role, she started to develop a passion for acting. After filming her first TV commercial, Lin caught the attention of TV and film directors, and many companies began seeking her for roles. She received her first role in the film &quot;School Days&quot;, with Jimmy Lin and Takeshi Kaneshiro. From 1995 to 1997 after MD completed, Lin had roles in several Taiwanese TV series and began to attract attention and buzz from the media. In 1996, Lin went to China for the first time to film; she considered this a period of valuable experience and a time that she began to learn about acting.
===Breakthrough: 1997–2001===
After playing minor roles in various series and films, Lin was selected by Taiwanese writer Chiung Yao to audition for a main role in the comedic period drama &quot;My Fair Princess&quot;, a joint production by mainland China and Taiwan which was adapted from Chiung Yao&#x27;s own novel. Originally picked for the role of Princess Saiya, Lin was ultimately chosen by the company to play Xia Ziwei instead, as the actress scheduled to play the main role was unavailable.
The drama quickly became a phenomenal sensation, appealing to large audiences in mainland China, Hong Kong, South Korea, and Southeast Asia. Lin rose to prominence and became a household name overnight.

After &quot;My Fair Princess&quot;, Lin starred in a number of successful television series. In 2000 she starred in Hong Kong TVB&#x27;s production of &quot;The Duke of Mount Deer&quot; with Dicky Cheung, Shu Qi and other well-known artists. In this series, Lin played Princess Jian Ning – a sassy, funny girl. This role demonstrated her acting range, since it differed from the nice, sweet image she had developed from her role in &quot;My Fair Princess&quot;. The following year, she starred in &quot;Romance in the Rain&quot;, a costume drama based in the 1930s and 1940s, also written by Chiung Yao. The series was a commercial success and recorded the highest ratings of the year. For two consecutive years (2000 and 2001), Lin was included in the Top Ten Most Famous Asian Superstars. The same year, she was selected in fourth place in &quot;Malaysia 2001 Heavenly Kings &amp; Queens&quot;.

As Lin felt she had achieved all she could in television, she started venturing into films. In 2000, she appeared in three Hong Kong films - &quot;Winner Takes All&quot;, &quot;Comic King&quot; and the action movie &quot;China Strike Force&quot; with Aaron Kwok and Taiwanese actor-singer Leehom Wang. Although Lin had only a supporting role, she considered it a learning experience. With these films, she made inroads into the Hong Kong market.

===Mainstream success: 2002–2005===
Since 2002, Lin focused on her career in mainland China. In 2003, she starred in three series - &quot;Half Life Fate (Pinyin: Ban Sheng Yuan)&quot; (adapted from Zhang Ailing&#x27;s novel &quot;Eighteen Springs&quot;), &quot;Boy &amp; Girl&quot; and &quot;Flying Daggers&quot;. Lin was chosen for the female lead in the TV version of &quot;Half Life Fate&quot;; the film version was directed by Ann Hui, a well-known Asian director. For Lin, it was a challenging role and she was under pressure.

Lin&#x27;s work yielded good results; her performance enhanced her fame, earning accolades for capturing her screen character Man Zhen&#x27;s 14 years of arduous life. The series was broadcast in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea. The same year, Lin also appeared in the youth romantic TV series &quot;Boy &amp; Girl&quot;; it was broadcast in China by CCTV, receiving the highest rating of all series aired in 2003. With this series, Lin was selected one of the Top 10 actresses of the year; of those 10 actresses, she was the only one from Taiwan. She then appeared in the ancient martial arts TV series &quot;Flying Daggers&quot;, based on Gu Long&#x27;s novel. It was her first 
martial-arts series, and Lin played against type – portraying a cold assassin, rather than her usual gentle damsel. These three series were released in 2003 throughout Asia, contributing to Lin&#x27;s rise in popularity and recognition. Though Lin focused on TV series, she continued to appear in films such as the adventure drama &quot;Life Express&quot; (with Richie Ren) and the romantic comedy &quot;Love Trilogy&quot; (with Francis Ng and Anita Yuen), which was relatively successful in China.

Lin sparked a trend towards China-Korea collaborations when she starred in the 2004 production &quot;Amor de Tarapaca&quot; (co-starring Korean actor Han Jae Suk). Lin was involved in another original Korean screenplay &quot;Magic Touch of Fate&quot;, co-starring Taiwanese actor Alec Su and Korean idol Kangta. This series is the highest-budgeted miniseries in Asian television history (as of 2011). By this time, Lin had been in show business for almost a decade, with nearly non-stop filming. She wanted to go back to school; since high school, studying abroad had been her dream. In the winter of 2004, after filming &quot;Magic Touch of Fate&quot;, Lin decided to study language and acting for three months in New York City. While she was there, Lin studied English at Study Group International and performance at the New York Film Academy.

Returning home to Taiwan with a new passion for acting in February 2005, Lin starred in &quot;Paris Sonata&quot;. For her role in &quot;Paris Sonata&quot;, she learned to play piano two months before filming. After &quot;Paris Sonata&quot;, she selected the TV drama &quot;Sound of Colors&quot; (a remake of Jimmy Liao&#x27;s book) as her next work, portraying a blind radio DJ. Lin&#x27;s performance as a blind girl received good reviews from audiences and the news media. This drama was broadcast in many countries, including Hong Kong, Taiwan, Philippines, Vietnam and the United States. This was followed by the dramas &quot;Star Boulevard&quot; and &quot;Da Li Princess&quot;, which were expected to be released in 2008 by CCTV.

===Another Milestone: 2006–2009 ===

In 2006, Lin&#x27;s starred in the television series &quot;Ancestral Temple&quot; where she further expanded her acting range. After three months of filming in Huang Shan, China, the series was completed at the end of October 2006. Its broadcast by CCTV-1 was planned for 2008. On June 6, 2006, Lin won the Most Popular Actress in Taiwan award at the 2nd Chinese TV Drama Award ceremony in Beijing. She has also been regularly featured in polls as one of the Top 10 contemporary Chinese actors.

At the end of 2006, Lin bid farewell to her management company Zhong Jie, after a 10-year relationship, and on November 30, 2006 ceremoniously signed with Huayi Brothers Film and Television group for a reported $10 million. Hua Yi Bros. is (as of 2011) the largest management and domestic movie-making company in China. In September 2007, she guest-starred in CCTV&#x27;s historical drama &quot;Su DongPo&quot;. In this series she played the first wife of Su Dongpo (writer, poet, artist, calligrapher, pharmacologist, and statesman of the Song dynasty, one of the major poets of the time), played by Lu Yi.

After filming the digital film &quot;Evening of Roses&quot;, Lin took on more challenging roles. In late 2007, she co-starred as Daji with Ray Lui in &quot;The Legend and the Hero 2&quot; (also known as &quot;Fengshen Bang&quot;), one of the major vernacular Chinese novels written during the Ming dynasty. After speculation over who would receive the leading role of Daji (who was known for her beauty and cruelty which ruined a dynasty), the role was offered to Lin. When Lin committed to play Daji, she could not escape comparison with Fan Bingbing, who played the same role in the first part of the series. Lin&#x27;s performance received generally positive comments from media. &quot;NetandTV&quot; commented, &quot;In comparison to the previous version, the bright spot in this new version&#x27;s Daji gets a new makeover. Ruby Lin&#x27;s look gave Daji a brand-new definition&quot;. Lin has often said &quot;comparing with other people is meaningless, I just wants a breakthrough from past looks, to surpass myself.&quot;

 In 2008, Lin returned to Taiwan for the series &quot;Love in Sun Moon Lake&quot;, playing an aboriginal woman; this was the first TV series to obtain permission for mainland Chinese actors to film in Taiwan. It was also announced that Lin had been cast as Sun Shangxiang in the new &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; TV adaptation directed by Gao Xixi, titled &quot;Three Kingdoms&quot;.

That same year, Lin also received the Most Stylish Actress in China award at the QQ 2006 China Entertainment Star Awards.

In 2009, Estee Lauder chose her as &quot;My Cover Girl in 2009&quot; for their Chinese and Taiwan markets for ¥1 million, according to media reports. In 2015, Estee Lauder announced again that Lin was their new brand spokesperson for Taiwan region.
In 2010, based on the popularity of her new series and film, Lin was spokesperson for more than 20 brands (including Japanese and Korean brands). Media named her as &quot;commercial queen&quot;. Lin also won the Most Charming Actress of the Year award at the 2010 China Fashion Weekly Awards.

In Asia as elsewhere, endorsement contracts for well-known brands are evidence of stardom. Ruby Lin has been a spokesperson for such brands as Mentholatum (2000–2003), Coca-Cola (2000), Christian Dior watches (2006–2007), ESPRIT (2001), Liuhengsei casual wear (since 2001), VOV Cosmetics (since 2006), China Mobile (since 2007), Pantene (2003–2006), Sofie Pantiliners (2002–2005), D&amp;D jewelry (2001–2005), Japanese company Glico, Oriks (since 2011), and HTC (2015), ReFa CARAT (since 2017) and Shiseido Elixir (since 2017). Lin also served as ACAP Wild Aid&#x27;s Rhino Ambassador for 2004–2005 and Winnie the Pooh Friendship Ambassador in 2001. Lin&#x27;s endorsements provided the majority of her income in 2007. In December 2009, Ruby Lin was chosen Best Artist for Advertisements at the annual China International Commercial and Art Awards. After Lin gave birth to her first child in early 2017, she became the new ambassador of brand for children and infants such as Fisher-Price and Pro-Kido Milk by Yili. In 2019, Nuna signs Lin as first Asian brand ambassador.

<doc id="1304731" wikidata="Q1631096" url="?curid=1304731" title="Hotel del Coronado">
<text>The Hotel del Coronado, also known as The Del and Hotel Del, is a historic beachfront hotel in Coronado, California, just across San Diego Bay from San Diego. A rare surviving example of an American architectural genre—the wooden Victorian beach resort—it was designated a California Historical Landmark in 1970 and a National Historic Landmark in 1977. It is the second-largest wooden structure in the United States (after Tillamook Air Museum in Tillamook, Oregon).

When the hotel opened in 1888, it was the largest resort hotel in the world. It has hosted presidents, royalty, and celebrities, and been featured in numerous films and books.

== History ==
=== San Diego land boom ===
In the mid-1880s, the San Diego region was experiencing one of its first real estate booms. At that time, it was common for a California developer to build a grand hotel as a draw to an otherwise barren landscape; examples include The Hollywood Hotel in Hollywood, the Raymond Hotel in Pasadena, the Hotel Del Monte in Monterey, and Hotel Redondo in Redondo Beach.

=== Coronado Beach Company ===
In November 1885, a group of five investors bought Coronado and North Island, about 4,000 acres, for $110,000. Those people were E. S. Babcock, retired railroad executive from Evansville, Indiana; Hampton L. Story, of the Story &amp; Clark Piano Company of Chicago; Jacob Gruendike, president of the First National Bank of San Diego; Heber Ingle; and Joseph Collett.

In April 1886, Babcock and Story created the Coronado Beach Company, then additional enterprises to support the development of Coronado. The Coronado Ferry Company built wharves and storage facilities and developed a ferryboat service between Coronado and San Diego; The Coronado Water Company piped fresh water under San Diego Bay from the San Diego River; The Coronado Railroad Company provided rail lines in Coronado, and eventually a &quot;Belt Line&quot; connected Coronado to San Diego via the Strand. The Hotel del Coronado boasted one of the largest electrical power plants in the state, providing service to the entire community of Coronado until the 1920s.

The men hired architect James W. Reid, a native of New Brunswick, Canada, who first practiced in Evansville and Terre Haute. His younger brother Merritt Reid, a partner in Reid Brothers, the Evansville firm, stayed in Indiana, and brother Watson Reid helped supervise the 2,000 laborers needed.

=== Babcock&#x27;s vision ===
Babcock&#x27;s visions for the hotel were grand:

It would be built around a court... a garden of tropical trees, shrubs and flowers... From the south end, the foyer should open to Glorietta Bay with verandas for rest and a promenade. On the ocean corner, there should be a pavilion tower, and northward along the ocean, a colonnade, terraced in grass to the beach. The dining wing should project at an angle from the southeast corner of the court and be almost detached, to give full value to the view of the ocean, bay, and city.&quot;

=== Construction ===
If the hotel were ever to be built, one of the numerous problems to overcome was the absence of lumber and labor in the San Diego area. The lumber problem was solved with contracts for exclusive rights to all raw lumber production of the Dolbeer &amp; Carson Lumber Company of Eureka, California, which was one of the West&#x27;s largest. Planing mills were built on-site to finish raw lumber shipped directly from the Dolbeer &amp; Carson lumber yards, located on the shores of Humboldt Bay. To obtain brick and concrete, Reid built his own kilns. He also constructed a metal shop and ironworks.

Construction of the hotel began in March 1887, &quot;on a sandspit populated by jack rabbits and coyotes&quot;. Labor was provided largely by Chinese immigrants from San Francisco and Oakland.

The Crown Room was Reid&#x27;s masterpiece. Its wooden ceiling was installed with pegs and glue, and not a single nail was used.

Landscaping for the hotel was completed by Kate Sessions.

==== Planning for fire hazards ====
Reid&#x27;s plans were being revised and added to constantly. To deal with fire hazards, a freshwater pipeline was run under San Diego Bay. Water tanks and gravity flow sprinklers were installed. He also built two giant cisterns with concrete walls a foot thick in the basement to store rainwater. Although these cisterns were never used for rainwater, they were reputedly very handy for storing alcoholic beverages during Prohibition. Reid also installed the world&#x27;s first oil furnace in the new hotel, prompting a Los Angeles oil company to build tankers to carry the oil to Coronado. Electric lighting in a hotel was also a world first. The electric wires were installed inside the gas lines, so if the electricity didn&#x27;t work, they could use gas to illuminate the rooms. Contrary to popular rumor, Thomas Edison was not involved in the installation of The Del&#x27;s electrical system. The electricity was installed by the Mather Electric Company out of Chicago (sometimes referred to as Mather-Perkins Company). An early Del brochure touted its &quot;Mather incandescent electric lamps, of which there are 2,500.&quot; Electricity was still new to San Diego, having been introduced in 1886.

In 1904, the Hotel del Coronado introduced the world&#x27;s first electrically lighted, outdoor living Christmas tree. From the &quot;San Diego Union&quot;, December 25, 1904: &quot;The tree selected for the honor is one of the three splendid Norfolk Island pines on the plaza [grassy area in front of the hotel]. It has attained a height of fifty feet and its branches stand proudly forth. All day yesterday electricians were busy fitting it up and by night 250 lights of many colors gave beauty to the fine old pine. Lanterns, great and small, hung from its boughs. And now that an open-air Christmas tree has been introduced, it is likely that another Christmas Eve will find many California gardens aglow with light scattered from living foliage.&quot;

=== Grand opening and real estate bust ===
When the 399-room hotel opened for business in February 1888, 1,440 San Diegans traveled across the bay. Reports of the new grand hotel were wired across the country, but just as the hotel was nearing completion, the Southern California land boom collapsed.
Babcock and Story needed additional funds at a time when many people were deserting San Diego. Babcock turned to Captain Charles T. Hinde and sugar magnate John D. Spreckels, who lent them $100,000 to finish the hotel. The Coronado Beach Company was then capitalized with three million United States dollars. The company directors at this time were E.S. Babcock, John Diedrich Spreckels, Captain Charles T. Hinde, H.W. Mallett, and Giles Kellogg. By 1890 Spreckels bought out both Babcock and Story. The Spreckels family retained ownership of the hotel until 1948.

The original grounds had many amenities, including an Olympic-sized saltwater pool, tennis courts, and a yacht club with architecture resembling the hotel&#x27;s grand tower. A Japanese tea garden, an ostrich farm, billiards, bowling alleys, hunting expeditions, and deep sea fishing were some of the many features offered to its guests.

=== Kate Morgan and Room 502 ===

Kate Morgan (c. 1864 – 1892) was an American housemaid who died in her mid-twenties under mysterious circumstances during her stay at the Hotel del Coronado. She checked into the hotel alone under the name “Lottie A Bernard” from Detroit. Five days later, on November 29, 1892, Kate was found dead from a gunshot wound to her head. The San Diego County coroner determined the wound was self-inflicted, but skeptics claim the bullet with which she was killed does not match the gun found in her hand.

To this day, Kate Morgan is thought by locals to haunt the hotel, and the hotel itself has an entire page about Kate Morgan. The Hotel del Coronado offers tours of Room 502, the room in which Kate Morgan stayed. Room 502 is the most requested room at the Hotel del Coronado.

=== Prince Edward and Wallis Simpson ===
On April 7, 1920, Edward, Prince of Wales was honored with a grand banquet in the Crown Room. Despite speculation that he met his future wife and Coronado resident Wallis Simpson at the event – her then-husband Earl Winfield Spencer Jr. was the first commanding officer of nearby Naval Air Station San Diego – most historians believe they met later. Edward and Wallis wrote in their memoirs that they met much later.

=== Hollywood&#x27;s playground ===
The popularity of the hotel was established before the 1920s. It already had hosted Presidents Harrison, McKinley, Taft, and Wilson. By the 1920s, many of Hollywood&#x27;s stars made their way to the hotel during the 1920s and 1930s, especially during the era of Prohibition. Douglas Fairbanks, Charlie Chaplin, Rudolph Valentino, Clark Gable, Errol Flynn, Mae West, Joan Crawford, Katharine Hepburn, Bette Davis, and Ginger Rogers among the well-known actors who stayed at the hotel.

On New Year&#x27;s Day 1937, during the Great Depression, the gambling ship SS &quot;Monte Carlo&quot;, known for &quot;drinks, dice, and dolls&quot;, was shipwrecked on the beach about a quarter mile south of the Hotel del Coronado.

=== World War II ===
During World War II, many West Coast resorts and hotels were taken over by the U.S. government for use as housing and hospitals. The Hotel del Coronado housed many pilots who were being trained at nearby North Island Naval Air Station on a contract basis, but it was never commandeered. General manager Steven Royce convinced the Navy to abstain from taking over the hotel because most of the additional rooms were being used to house the families of officers. He pointed out that &quot;the fathers, mothers, and wives were given priority to the rooms because it may be the last time they will see their sons and husbands.&quot; Ultimately the Navy agreed, and the hotel never was appropriated.

The hotel was designated as a &quot;wartime casualty station&quot;. It began a victory garden program, planting vegetables on all spare grounds around the hotel.


=== Post-war ===
Barney Goodman purchased the hotel from the Spreckels in 1948. From the end of World War II until 1960, the hotel began to age. While still outwardly beautiful, neglect was evident. In 1960, local millionaire John Alessio purchased the hotel and spent $2 million on refurbishment and redecorating. Popular Hollywood set designer Al Goodman was commissioned by Alessio to oversee the hotel&#x27;s restoration and refurbishments, which notably included the Grand Ballroom, the Victorian Room Lounge, and the Victorian elevator grille.

Alessio sold the hotel to M. Larry Lawrence in 1963. Lawrence&#x27;s initial plan was to develop the land around the hotel and ultimately, to demolish it, but he later changed his mind. During his tenure, Lawrence invested $150 million to refurbish and expand much of the hotel. He doubled its capacity to 700 rooms. He added the Grande Hall Convention Center and two seven-story Ocean Towers just south of the hotel.

The Lawrence family sold the hotel to the Travelers Group after Lawrence died in 1996. The Travelers Group completed a $55 million upgrade of the hotel in 2001, which included seismic retrofitting.

=== 21st century ===
While retaining its classic Victorian look, the hotel continues to upgrade its facilities. In July 2005, the hotel obtained approval to construct up to 37 limited-term occupancy cottages and villas on the property. They also received approval to add up to 205 additional rooms.

The hotel received a Four Diamond rating from the American Automobile Association in 2009 and was listed in 2011 by &quot;USA Today&quot; among the top 10 resorts in the world.

The hotel has been sold in several transactions between financial institutions. In 2003, Travelers sold the property to CNL Hospitality Properties Inc. and KSL Recreation Corp (CNL/KSL). This ownership group completed a $10 million upgrade of 381 rooms in June 2005. The hotel was then owned by the Blackstone Group LP (60%), Strategic Hotels &amp; Resorts Inc. (34.5%), and KSL Resorts (5.5%). When Strategic Hotels &amp; Resorts Inc. bought its stake in 2006, the hotel was valued at $745 million; as of 2011, the hotel was valued at roughly $590 million. In 2014, Strategic Hotels &amp; Resorts became full owners of the hotel. In December 2015, Blackstone purchased Strategic Hotels &amp; Resorts.

In March 2016, Blackstone sold Strategic Hotels &amp; Resorts to Anbang Insurance Group, a Beijing-based Chinese insurance company, in a $6.5 billion deal involving multiple resorts. Anbang thus bought 16 luxury American hotel properties including the Hotel del Coronado. Fifteen of the 16 were immediately transferred to Anbang. However, the sale of the Hotel del Coronado was held up because of concerns expressed by the federal inter-agency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews acquisitions of U.S. businesses by foreign investors for possible national security risks. The agency was concerned about the hotel&#x27;s proximity to major Navy bases. In October 2016, it was reported that the deal had fallen through and the hotel would remain in Blackstone&#x27;s ownership.

In August 2017, Hilton Hotels and Resorts took over the management of the Hotel del Coronado as part of their Curio Collection. The resort is still owned by Blackstone and the name Hotel del Coronado has not changed.

The Hotel del Coronado was then inducted into Historic Hotels of America, the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, in 2018.

The hotel began a redevelopment and expansion in February 2019 to add a new entryway, more guest rooms, parking garages, another restaurant, and more. The remodel is projected to last three years and cost $400 million.

On March 26, 2020, the hotel closed temporarily, due to the COVID-19 epidemic. This was the first time in the property&#x27;s 132-year history that it had closed its doors to guests. It reopened on June 26, 2020.

In 2021, the hotel&#x27;s historic main lobby, front facade, and front veranda were restored, for $14 million. In 2022, the hotel opened a new wing, Shore House at the Del, featuring 75 one-, two- and three-bedroom residential-style units. The historic main wing closed in January 2024 for one year for a more than $160 million renovation, the final portion of the resort&#x27;s $550 million makeover. The upgrades will encompass all Victorian guest rooms, suites, and event spaces, including the Crown Room. The remodeled guest rooms will re-open throughout 2025. 

== Notable guests ==
Notable guests of the hotel have included 
Thomas Edison, Marilyn Monroe, L. Frank Baum, Charlie Chaplin, King Kalakaua of Hawaii, Vincent Price, Babe Ruth, James Stewart, Bette Davis and Katharine Hepburn. More recently, guests have included Kevin Costner, Whoopi Goldberg, Gene Hackman, George Harrison, Keanu Reeves, Brad Pitt, Madonna, Barbra Streisand, and Oprah Winfrey.

The following presidents have stayed at the hotel: Benjamin Harrison, William Howard Taft, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.

The hotel is also known for hosting opulent weddings, and is often cited as one of the most expensive wedding locations in California. The wedding capacity is about 300 people in total, with several event spaces for guests. It has become a celebrity wedding destination over time, with basketball star LeBron James also considering the hotel as a wedding location in 2013.

Films&lt;br&gt;
The hotel was first featured in a film when it was used as a backdrop for &quot;The Married Virgin&quot; (1918). Since then, it has been featured in at least 13 other films, including: &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; (1959), starring Marilyn Monroe, Jack Lemmon, and Tony Curtis, where it represented the &quot;Seminole Ritz&quot; in southern Florida; &quot;$&quot; (1971) starring Goldie Hawn and Warren Beatty; &quot;Wicked, Wicked&quot; (1973), which was completely filmed on location there; &quot;The Stunt Man&quot; (1980), starring Peter O&#x27;Toole; &quot;The Girl, the Gold Watch &amp; Everything&quot; (1980) starring Pam Dawber; and &quot;My Blue Heaven&quot; (1990), starring Steve Martin and Rick Moranis.

The science historian James Burke filmed his special &quot;The Neuron Suite&quot; at the Coronado.

The Hotel del Coronado was the primary location for the filming of the fantasy-comedy feature film &quot;Daydream Hotel&quot;, which had its world premiere at the 1st Annual Coronado Island Film Festival in January 2016.

Literature
* In &quot;Moran of the &quot;Lady Letty&quot;: A Story of Adventure Off the California Coast&quot; (1898) by Frank Norris, a shanghaied San Francisco dandy wins in a showdown against a Chinese triad gang on the shore of the Baja California Peninsula, teaching them the lesson: &quot;Don&#x27;t try to fight with white people.&quot; Triumphant from the final showdown the protagonist sails to San Diego and makes a dramatic appearance at a society soiree in the hotel&#x27;s &quot;incomparable round ballroom&quot;.
* L. Frank Baum, author of &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, did much of his writing at the hotel, and is said to have based his design for the Emerald City on it. However, other sources say the Emerald City was inspired by the &quot;White City&quot; of the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair of 1893.
* Ambrose Bierce used the hotel as the setting for his short story, &quot;An Heiress From Redhorse&quot;.
* It also was the setting for Richard Matheson&#x27;s novel &quot;Bid Time Return&quot; (1975); however, for the movie version, &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; (1980), the story setting and filming were moved to the Grand Hotel (Mackinac Island) on Mackinac Island, Michigan.
* Lorin Morgan-Richards, a children&#x27;s author, has frequented the hotel and written and illustrated works while staying in the turret room. The cover of his book &quot;Dark Letter Days&quot; shows the image of the Del.
* In the 2016 novel &quot;The Wrong Side of Goodbye,&quot; by Michael Connelly, protagonist Harry Bosh finds the negative of a photograph taken in front of the hotel of a woman holding a baby, which allows the investigator to identify the town and also provides a date.

Music
* The Hotel del Coronado is the setting of the Dashboard Confessional song &quot;Stolen&quot;.

Stage productions&lt;br&gt;
Each December since 1994, Lamb&#x27;s Players Theatre and the hotel have presented &quot;An American Christmas&quot;, a 3-hour &quot;Feast &amp; Celebration&quot; set 100 years earlier, in the hotel&#x27;s ballroom.

The stage musical adaptation of &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; takes place at the hotel, as a tribute to the fact that the original movie was filmed there.

Television&lt;br&gt;
The hotel stood in for the fictional Mansfield House during host segments of the NBC anthology series &quot;Ghost Story&quot; in 1972. The storylines of &quot;Baywatch&quot; season 4, episodes 14 and 15, called &quot;Coronado del Soul&quot; Parts 1 and 2, evolve in and around the hotel.

The grounds and some interior areas were used in 3 episodes of Antiques Roadshow broadcast as S23 E7, S23 E8 and S23 E9 in February and April 2019.

Postage stamp&lt;br&gt;
The hotel is featured on a US Postage Stamp honoring director Billy Wilder, with images of Marilyn Monroe and the hotel from &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot;.

<text>Vatican Radio (; ) is the official broadcasting service of Vatican City.

Established in 1931 by Guglielmo Marconi, today its programs are offered in 47 languages, and are sent out on short wave, DRM, medium wave, FM, satellite and the Internet. Since its inception, Vatican Radio has been maintained by the Jesuit Order. Vatican Radio preserved its independence during the rise of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany.

Today, programming is produced by over 200 journalists located in 61 countries. Vatican Radio produces more than 42,000 hours of simultaneous broadcasting covering international news, religious celebrations, in-depth programs, and music. The current general director is Father Federico Lombardi, S.J.

On 27 June 2015, Pope Francis, in a &quot;motu proprio&quot; apostolic letter, established the Secretariat for Communications in the Roman Curia, which absorbed Vatican Radio effective 1 January 2017, ending the organization&#x27;s 85 years of independent operation.

==History==
===1930s===
Vatican Radio began broadcasting with the callsign HVJ on two shortwave frequencies using 10 kilowatts (kW) of power on 12 February 1931, with the pontificial message &quot;Omni creaturae&quot; of Pope Pius XI. Also in attendance was Guglielmo Marconi and Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli, who would become Pope Pius XII. Its first director was physicist Giuseppe Gianfranceschi, who was also the president of the Accademia dei Nuovi Lincei.

In 1933, a permanent microwave link was established between the Vatican Palace and the summer residence of the papacy, Castel Gandolfo.

In 1936, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) recognized Vatican Radio as a &quot;special case&quot; and authorized its broadcasting without any geographical limits. On 25 December 1937 a Telefunken 25 kW transmitter and two directional antennas were added. Vatican Radio broadcast over 10 frequencies.

===World War II===

Following a December 1939 report from Cardinal August Hlond of Poznań detailing the oppression of the Catholic Church in Poland, Pope Pius XII decided, among other measures, to use Vatican Radio to provide &quot;information regarding the condition of the church in Poland.&quot; The German broadcast on 21 January 1940 compared German activities to &quot;what the Communists imposed on Spain in 1936&quot;; the English service noted the attacks on the Church were not limited to the Soviets.

During World War II, Vatican Radio&#x27;s news broadcasts were (like all foreign broadcasts) banned in Germany. During the war, the radio service operated in four languages.

While some critics have said Pope Pius XII was too quiet regarding the Holocaust, Jacques Adler examined the transcripts of wartime broadcasts over the Vatican Radio. Adler argues that it exposed Nazi persecution of the Church and opposed collaboration with Nazism. It appealed to Catholics to remain true to their faith&#x27;s injunctions: to defend the sanctity of life and the unity of humankind. In so doing the Pope pursued a policy of spiritual resistance to Nazi ideology and racism.

===1940s and 1950s===
In 1948, services expanded to 18 languages.

Due to space constraints, the Holy See acquired a 400-hectare (1½ sq. mi.) area located 18 kilometres (11 miles) north of Rome at Santa Maria di Galeria (GC: ). The Italian Republic granted the site extraterritorial status in 1952.

In 1957, a new broadcasting center was placed in operation, with a Philips 100 kW shortwave transmitter, two 10 kW shortwave transmitters, and one 120 kW mediumwave transmitter, with 21 directional and one omnidirectional antenna. The next phase involved two 100 kW transmitters aimed at Africa and Oceania, a 250 kW mediumwave transmitter for Europe, and a 500 kW transmitter for the Far East and Latin America.

Radio Vaticana was one of 23 founding broadcasting organisations of the European Broadcasting Union in 1950.

===2000s===
In the 21st century, Vatican Radio has experimented with digital transmission technologies (DRM, T-DAB, T-DMB) and has used electronic newsletters, podcasts, and other new technologies to distribute its programming. Vatican Radio and CTV began their own YouTube channel in 2010, operating in four languages, and operates six Twitter accounts.

In May 2009 it was announced that Vatican Radio would begin broadcasting commercial advertisements for the first time in July. The decision was made to meet the radio&#x27;s rising costs, namely 21.4m euros a year. All advertisements would have to meet &quot;high moral standards&quot;. Vatican Radio stopped transmitting short- and medium-wave broadcasts to North America, South America, and Europe on Sunday 1 July 2012. The Vatican Press Office closed Vatican Information Service in August 2012.

In 2014 Michael Gannon, from Ireland, became the first person with Down Syndrome to work at any Vatican office, which he did as an intern at Vatican Radio.

As of 2016, Vatican Radio had a staff of 355 people who produce more than 66 hours of daily programming in 45 languages on air, and 38 languages on the website. Programs are broadcast via short wave, FM and satellite.

Vatican Radio has been losing between €20 and €30 million annually. With its absorption into the Curia&#x27;s Secretariat for Communications on 1 January 2017 Vatican Radio director Msgr. Dario Viganò has indicated that he plans to pare down short-wave radio operations and institute cost control measures in the service&#x27;s other broadcast operations.

On 24 March 2017, Vatican Radio made its final English-language shortwave transmission to Asia after 59 years of service. Vatican Radio&#x27;s English Service for Asia has then continued online.

==Television and satellite==
During the 1930s, the station made experimental television broadcasts. Apart from a brief experimental revival in the 1950s (callsign HVJ, started 1953. Channel 8 on the French standard for VHF, had plans to switch to the standard used in the rest of Europe), it was not until the 1990s that a regular &#x27;satellite&#x27; television service began. The programs of TV2000 include programming from Vatican Television Center.

Vatican Channel HD is available in English and Italian on the satellite through Eutelsat Hot Bird 13°est (11334 MHz, pol.H, Sr 27500,3/4) as well as on terrestrial TV in the Rome metropolitan area, and Vatican Media Europe multilanguage on Hot Bird 13B (12475 MHz, pol.H, Sr 29900, 3/4).

Vatican Radio Europe is available via satellite through Eutelsat Hot Bird 13°est (12476 MHz, pol.H, Sr 29900, 3/4) and Radio Vaticana 5, in Italian Eutelsat 9B (12466 MHz, pol.V, Sr 41950, 3/4).

==Transmitters==

The signals are transmitted from a large shortwave and medium-wave transmission facility for Radio Vatican. The Santa Maria di Galeria Transmitter was established in 1957 and it is an extraterritorial area in Italy belonging to the Holy See. Vatican Radio&#x27;s interval signal, Christus Vincit, is a well-known sound on shortwave radio.

One aerial for the medium wave frequency 1530 kHz which consists of four grounded freestanding towers arranged in a square, which carry wires for a medium wave aerial on horizontal crossbars. The direction of this aerial can be changed.

From May 2014 to December 2016 the antennas of Santa Maria di Galeria were progressively decommissioned, which radiated the medium wave signal on 1530 kHz with programs destined for Italy, Europe and the Mediterranean area.

==Radiation controversy==

The Santa Maria di Galeria transmitter site is the subject of a dispute between the station and some local residents who claim the non-ionising radiation from the site has affected their health.

<text>Steve Wong Ka Keung (; born 13 November 1964) is a Hong Kong musician, singer, songwriter, and the bassist for the rock band Beyond. He is also the younger brother of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Wong Ka Kui, who died in 1993.

== Life and career ==

=== 1964–1999: Early life and Beyond ===
Wong was born on 13 November 1964 in British Hong Kong and his ancestry traces back to Taishan, Guangdong. He played music with Kubert Leung in a band. In late 1983 he joined Beyond to replace the band&#x27;s original bassist Lee Wing Chiu (李榮潮). From the album &quot;Modern Stage&quot; (現代舞台)&#x27;s release in 1988, Wong began singing on some tracks, notably &quot;Cold Rain Night&quot; (冷雨夜) with lyrics by him and music by his brother Wong Ka Kui.

In June 1993, his brother Wong Ka Kui died in an accident in Japan. In 1994 Beyond released the album &quot;2nd-Floor Band Room&quot; (二樓後座) and from then lead guitarist Paul Wong and he received the role of Beyond lead vocalist and main songwriter.

In late 1999, Beyond announced their launch of solo career. In 2002 Wong formed the group Picasso Horses with several young musicians and then signed a contract with Universal Records to cultivate bands.

=== 1999–present: Solo career ===
Wong is also a songwriter for many artists, including Leo Ku, Eason Chan, Amanda Lee, Jordan Chan, Faye Wong, etc.

In July 2009, Wong and Paul Wong ran three continuous sessions of concert in Hong Kong Coliseum despite private discord between them.

Wong held &quot;Wong Ka Keung It&#x27;s Alright Live Concert&quot; on 4 to 5 June 2013, in Kowloonbay International Trade &amp; Exhibition Centre.

Wong was the manager for the rock duo Soler, but they stopped their collaboration due to discord.

In December 2015, Wong attended BPA&#x27;s 3rd annual dinner, sang Beyond’s signature works &quot;Love You&quot; (喜歡你) and &quot;Glorious Years&quot; (光輝歲月) with a couple of civil servants and took a photo with former chief executive Leung Chun Ying, leading to controversy from some netizens.

After that, Wong became a spokesman for a Gionee advertisement where a 3D projected image of his brother Wong Ka Kui appeared and they hugged each other, resulting in the second controversy but from fans.

== Personal life ==
He is now married to Makiko Mizuguchi from Japan, and they have two sons.

<text>The 2004 United States presidential election in Georgia took place on November 2, 2004. Voters chose 15 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.

Georgia was won by incumbent President George W. Bush by a 16.60% margin of victory. Prior to the election, all 12 news organizations considered this a state Bush would win, or otherwise a red state. Bush performed almost five points better than he did in 2000. He also won a wide majority of the counties and congressional districts. The results of the state were similar to other states in the South, such as Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Louisiana. Like those states, the exit polling showed racial polarization as Bush dominated among white voters, which made up almost 70% of the vote, and Kerry dominated among African American voters, which made up 30% of the state&#x27;s population. Software engineer and talk show host Michael Badnarik (L-TX) would finish third in the popular vote in Georgia, getting 0.56% of the vote, one of his best statewide performances in the nation.

In this election, Georgia voted 14.14% to the right of the nation at-large.

As of 2024, this remains the last time that Georgia has been decided by a double-digit margin in a presidential election, and the last time it voted to the right of Tennessee, Louisiana, West Virginia, and Arkansas. Georgia was one of 10 states that George W. Bush won twice which had only backed George H. W. Bush once. This was the first time that Georgia voted Republican three elections in a row. Bush became the first of two Republican presidential candidates to win Georgia twice, followed by Donald Trump, and is the only one ever to do so in consecutive elections.

*2004 Georgia Democratic primary

==Campaign==
===Predictions===

There were 12 news organizations that made state-by-state predictions of the election. Here are their last predictions before election day.

===Polling===
Bush won every single pre-election poll and won each by a double-digit margin of victory and with over 50% of the vote. The final 3 polls averaged Bush leading 56% to 41%.

===Fundraising===
Bush raised $6,656,076. Kerry raised $2,282,977.

===Advertising and visits===
Neither campaign advertised or visited this state during the fall election.

== Analysis ==
Like other Deep South states during the 2004 election, the political demographics of Georgia was based more around the racial majority in each county, with white Georgians voting more Republican and black Georgians voting more Democratic. Democratic dominance in the state occurred in mostly black-majority counties in the region as well the urban center of the city of Atlanta (located mostly in central Fulton County) along with its core suburban counties of Clayton and DeKalb. Athens-Clarke County, home of the University of Georgia, also supported Kerry&#x27;s bid, largely as a consequence of being a college town with traditionally left-leaning political views. Since just about every other part of Georgia had a majority white population, Republican dominance occurred in just about every other part of the state including suburban Atlanta where a significant portion of the state&#x27;s population resides. Suburban Atlanta also includes northern Fulton County (the former Milton County area) which despite being part of this heavily urban and majority-minority county, is predominantly-White, suburban, and perhaps the most affluent area in the state of Georgia. This area also voted heavily in favor of Republican presidential incumbent George W. Bush.

In other down ballot races, Republicans gained Georgia&#x27;s Class III U.S. Senate seat which was then held by Zell Miller (D) with Johnny Isakson&#x27;s (R) victory in the open seat race to succeed him and also gained control of the Georgia House of Representatives, and thus control of both houses of the Georgia General Assembly (having already gained control of the Georgia State Senate in 2002), for the first time since Reconstruction. However, despite these achievements, Democrats gained one of Georgia&#x27;s U.S. House seats with John Barrow&#x27;s (D) victory over incumbent Representative Max Burns (R).

As of the 2024 presidential election, this is the last election in which the Metro Atlanta counties of Douglas, Rockdale, and Newton—now Democratic strongholds—voted Republican. This is also the last time Sumter County, the home county of former Democratic president Jimmy Carter, voted Republican and the last in which Webster County voted Democratic, as well as the last election in which Georgia was decided by a double-digit margin. Baldwin and Washington counties would not vote Republican again until 2024.

== Results ==

(*Tancredo was not the Republican Party&#x27;s nominee in 2004.)

===By county===


==== Counties that flipped from Democratic to Republican ====

===By congressional district===
Bush won 9 of 13 congressional districts, including two held by Democrats.
== Electors ==
Technically the voters of Georgia cast their ballots for electors: representatives to the Electoral College. Georgia is allocated 15 electors because it has 13 congressional districts and 2 senators. All candidates who appear on the ballot or qualify to receive write-in votes must submit a list of 15 electors, who pledge to vote for their candidate and his or her running mate. Whoever wins the majority of votes in the state is awarded all 15 electoral votes. Their chosen electors then vote for president and vice president. Although electors are pledged to their candidate and running mate, they are not obligated to vote for them. An elector who votes for someone other than his or her candidate is known as a faithless elector.

The electors of each state and the District of Columbia met on December 13, 2004, to cast their votes for president and vice president. The Electoral College itself never meets as one body. Instead the electors from each state and the District of Columbia met in their respective capitols.

The following were the members of the Electoral College from the state. All were pledged to and voted for George W. Bush and Dick Cheney.

<doc id="1304778" wikidata="Q16153726" url="?curid=1304778" title="List of presidential appointees to the Council of State (Ireland)">
<text>The President of Ireland has the right to appoint a maximum of seven members of the Council of State, which advises the President in exercising certain reserve powers. As well as the seven (or fewer) appointees, the Council has seven &quot;ex officio&quot; members and a variable number of life members by right of former office. An appointed member&#x27;s term ends when the President&#x27;s term ends, although a new or re-elected President may re-appoint members. If an appointed member accedes to one of the positions conferring &quot;ex officio&quot; membership of the Council, this creates a vacancy which the President may fill via another appointment.

==History==
The first President, Douglas Hyde, who took office in 1938, did not nominate members till the Council first met in January 1940; all six nominees were Oireachtas members, and not members of the Fianna Fáil government party.

For long, Presidents included senior serving politicians on the Council. Éamon de Valera said during the 1937 debate on the proposed Constitution, &quot;this Council of State ... will ordinarily contain the leaders of the big Parties in the Dáil.&quot; Upon Richard Mulcahy&#x27;s 1971 death, de Valera invited Fine Gael leader Liam Cosgrave to join but Cosgrave declined. Fine Gael objected in 1991 that Mary Robinson had become the first President not to have the Leader of the Opposition in the Council. Robinson had promised to appoint two representatives of the Opposition, but the practice of including the Leader was not a fixed rule. In early 1995, after the Fianna Fáil-led government was replaced by a Fine Gael-led government without a general election, Mary Robinson asked Monica Barnes of Fine Gael to resign from the council of state to allow Mary O&#x27;Rourke of Fianna Fáil to be appointed instead to increase the Opposition voice. The Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution issued a 1998 report dealing with the Presidency, which recommended that the President be &quot;empowered to nominate two members of the Dáil who belong to parties other than the party or parties that form the government for the life of that government&quot;.

Early Presidents included one or two representatives of minorities; there were several of Anglo-Irish, Protestant, or ex-Unionist backgrounds, and the Jewish Bob Briscoe. In campaigning in the 1990 presidential election, Mary Robinson promised to reform the Council of State. She criticised it for consisting &quot;mainly of senior or retired politicians&quot; and promised to make it &quot;truly representative of the community as a whole&quot;. Prior to 1990, Presidents generally reappointed members from the previous term; new members were appointed only when a vacancy arose by a previous appointee&#x27;s death or accession to ex-officio membership. Patrick Hillery considered new appointees upon assuming office in 1976, and was advised there was no precedent for informing former Councillors of their exclusion; Hillery decided &quot;it would be too hurtful to drop any of the members&quot;. Robinson abandoned this practice by appointing seven new members; Mary McAleese did likewise at both her first and second terms. Michael D. Higgins appointed six first-timers and Catherine McGuinness, who had served under Patrick Hillery. For his second term he appointed seven first-timers.

During the 2011 presidential election campaign, candidate Mary Davis, best known for her Special Olympics activism, pledged to nominate a person with intellectual disability to the Council. This proposal attracted some criticism as tokenism, but was endorsed by Fergus Finlay. During a debate on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;, candidates were later asked whether they thought Denis O&#x27;Brien would be &quot;a suitable person to be on the Council of State&quot;. After the victory of Labour Party candidate Michael D. Higgins, the party denied that its leader Eamon Gilmore had suggested nominees to Higgins.

<text>Alexander Hislop (1807 – 13 March 1865) was a Free Church of Scotland minister known for his criticisms of the Catholic Church. He was the son of Stephen Hislop (died 1837), a mason by occupation and an elder of the Relief Church. Alexander&#x27;s brother was also named Stephen Hislop and became well known in his time as a missionary to India and a naturalist.

Alexander was born and raised in Duns, Berwickshire. He was for a time parish schoolmaster of Wick, Caithness. In 1831 he married Jane Pearson. He was for a time editor of the &quot;Scottish Guardian&quot; newspaper. As a probationer he joined the Free Church of Scotland at the Disruption of 1843. He was ordained in 1844 at the East Free Church, Arbroath, where he became senior minister in 1864. He died of a paralytic stroke in Arbroath the next year after being ill for about two years.

He wrote several books, his most famous being &quot;The Two Babylons: Papal Worship Proved to be the Worship of Nimrod and His Wife&quot;, which is discredited by many historians.

==&quot;The Two Babylons&quot;==
This book, initially published in 1853 as a pamphlet, was greatly revised and expanded and released as a book in 1858.

In the book, Hislop argued that the Catholic Church was a Babylonian mystery cult and pagan, but Protestants worshipped the true Jesus and the true God. He believed that Catholic religious practices are pagan practices that were grafted onto true Christianity during the reign of Constantine. Then, the merger between the Roman state religion and its adoration of the mother and child was transferred to Christianity, merging Christian characters with pagan mythology. The goddess was renamed &quot;Mary&quot;, and Jesus was the renamed &quot;Jupiter-Puer&quot;, or &quot;Jupiter the Boy&quot;.

Hislop believed that the goddess, in Rome called Venus or Fortuna, was the Roman name of the more ancient Babylonian cult of Ishtar, whose origins began with a blonde-haired and blue-eyed woman named Semiramis.

According to Hislop, Semiramis was an exceedingly beautiful woman, who gave birth to a son named Tammuz, was instrumental as the queen, and wife of Nimrod the founder of Babylon, and its religion, complete with a pseudo-Virgin Birth. Later, Nimrod was killed, and Semiramis, pregnant with his child, claimed the child was Nimrod reborn. 

Hislop attempted to show that the cult and worship of Semiramis spread globally, her name changing with the culture. In Egypt she was Isis, in Greece and Rome she was called Venus, Diana, Athena, and a host of other names, but was always prayed to and central to the faith which was based on Babylonian mystery religion. According to Hislop, Constantine, though claiming to convert to Christianity, remained pagan but renamed the gods and goddesses with Christian names to merge the two faiths for his political advantage.

Constantine&#x27;s endorsement of the tradition was a turning point for Early Christianity. In 313, Constantine issued the Edict of Milan legalizing Christian worship. The emperor became a great patron of the Church, and set a precedent for the position of the Christian Emperor within the Church and the notion of orthodoxy, Christendom, and ecumenical councils that would be followed for centuries as the State church of the Roman Empire.

<text>The 23rd Division was an infantry division of the British Army raised in 1914 in the Great War as part of Kitchener&#x27;s Army. The division was sent to France in August 1915 under the command of Major-General Sir James Melville Babington C.B. C.M.G. During the war the division fought on the Western Front until October 1917 when it moved to the Italian Front. It remained in Italy and was disbanded by March 1919.

== History ==
===1914–1915===
====Formation and training====
The division formed part of Kitchener&#x27;s third New Army, with concentration of units beginning on 16 September, the 68th Brigade at Bullswater and the 69th and 70th brigades, together with Royal Engineers companies at Frensham. It was commanded by Maj. Gen. James Melville Babington, who was at first hampered by a lack of clerks, cooks and a means of communicating orders, other than verbally. Together with other New Army divisions, uniforms of any description were not received until mid October, by which time many of the civilian clothes the men wore were reduced to rags. Division artillery began to be formed in early November. Initial weapons training was carried out with small numbers of Lee-Metford rifles and French 90mm guns. The division was concentrated at Aldershot in January 1915, where the division train was formed. Khaki uniforms were received at the end of February and the division moved to the Shorncliffe area in March and continued training. In May the division moved to Borden where 18-pounders and 4.5 inch howitzers were issued to the division artillery and in June the Infantry received its rifles. On 16 August the division was inspected by the King and next day received its orders for embarkation.

====France====
On arrival in France the division was concentrated near St Omer with the Guards and the 24th divisions, forming XI Corps, where it continued training. In early September the division was transferred to III Corps and in mid September took over part of the front line in the nursery sector of Armentières where, because of the high water table, much of the front line was defined by breastworks.

The 103rd and 105th Artillery brigades were lent to the 8th Division for a diversionary attack in support of the Battle of Loos in late September and won the division&#x27;s first bravery awards, the rest of the division provided a smoke barrage.

In early October the 70th Brigade was exchanged with the (regular army) 24th Brigade of the 8th Division, with two battalions in it being exchanged with battalions in the other brigades (the 2nd East Lancashire Regiment going to the 68th Brigade, the 1st Sherwood Foresters to the 69th Brigade and the 13th Durham Light Infantry and the 10th Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment replacing them in the 24th Brigade, a similar process happening in the 8th Division). This not only gave the service battalions the benefit of the regulars experience but also gave the regulars a boost in morale by association with fresh troops.

The division&#x27;s first V.C was won on 4 November by Pte Thomas Kenny of 13th D.L.I., rescuing an officer in heavy fog after a patrol was ambushed. On the night of the last day of the year the division launched its first trench raid with 116 officers and men of the 10th Northumberland Fusiliers and a party of Royal Engineers.

===1916===
In late February the division was relieved by the 34th Division, and after a short rest was sent to the front near Souchez, south of Lens. Here the division&#x27;s artillery was used to support the 47th (1/2nd London) Division in early April as a feint and again in late May to counter a German advance. In mid June the division was relieved by the 47th Division and by the end of the month was in reserve at Rainneville behind the Somme front.

====Somme====

Ordered to relieve the 34th Division the 23rd entered the Somme battle on 3 July, and subsequently advanced toward and captured Contalmaison by 10 July. The divisions second V.C. was won by 2nd Lt Donald Bell of the 9th Yorkshire Regiment on 5 July when he and two others (who both won the D.C.M.) rushed a machine gun nest. The division was relieved on 11 July, except for the 68th Brigade which joined the 34th Division on 11 July and took part in an abortive attack on Pozières on the night of 16/17 July, the artillery remained in action supporting the 1st Division. Indicative of the high morale of the division, the sick list for 14 July was one man. By 20 July the division once again had its three original brigades, the 70th Brigade returning from 8th Division where it had suffered heavy losses in the first day of the Somme battle and the 68th returning from the 34th Division.

On 25 July the division began to relieve the 1st Division east of Contalmaison, and began with each brigade in turn fighting along a trench called &quot;Munster Alley&quot; towards Martinpuich. The division&#x27;s third V.C was won by Pte William Short of 8th West Yorkshire Regiment on 5 August. The division was relieved on 8 August by the 15th Division, and was sent to the relatively quiet sector of Ploegsteert Wood near Armentières.

Returning to the Somme in mid-September, the division was placed in reserve for the early part of the Battle of Flers-Courcelette, and over 18/19 September relieved the 15th Division and took over part of the 50th Division&#x27;s line. Here they held the line and conducted raids, until advancing on 25 September at the request of the Canadians on the division&#x27;s left to support their advance. The position, a trench called &#x27;26th Avenue&#x27; was occupied by 70th Brigade on 27 September after a German withdrawal, after an earlier attack failed when it was occupied, the subsequent advance and occupation of Destremont Farm on 29 September just outside the village of Le Sars was heavily contested. On 3 October in the initial advance on Le Sars, the division&#x27;s fourth V.C. was won by 2nd Lt Henry Kelly. The village and positions around it, were captured by 68th and 69th brigades on 7/8 October, earning praise from III Corps, 50th and 15th division commanders. On 9 October the division was relieved by 15th Division, and was transferred to X Corps in the Ypres Salient.

Arriving at Ypres between 17 and 20 October, the division relieved the 2nd Australian Division around Sanctuary Wood and the Menin Ridge Road. While there they conducted patrols and trench raids and were in turn subjected to occasional artillery bombardments. On 10 December 1916 the division was required to execute one its commissioned officers, 2/Lt. Eric Poole, of the 11th (Service) Battalion, West Yorkshire Regiment, who had been sentenced to death by a court martial for desertion from his unit during the Somme Offensive. The division was relieved by the 38th Division in the Ypres sector on 25 February 1917.

===1917===
While out of the line the division was rested and trained, returning to the Ypres front line between 6 and 8 April and taking over positions held partly by the 38th and 47th divisions, south of where it had been previously. On 9 April the Germans launched an intense bombardment followed by an infantry assault which fell on the 70th Brigade. The division was quickly withdrawn from the line on 28 April, replaced by the 19th Division and given special training for the upcoming battle to improve the positions around Ypres.

====Messines Ridge====

The division returned to the front line on 10 May in the region of Hill 60 and began preparations for the attack. These preparation were observed by the Germans on the higher ground who assaulted the line on 13 May, which was repulsed, this attracted counter raiding by the 70th Brigade on 16 and 20 May. During this time the division&#x27;s easily observed artillery attracted heavy German counter battery fire with serious casualties resulting. The division was to form the left flank of the advance on a front ~2000 yards wide, with its furthest advance ~1400 yards deep. After the artillery bombardment and the detonation of 19 mines on 7 June, the 69th and 70th brigades (the 69th reinforced with the 11th Northumberland Fusiliers and 12th Durham Light Infantry) advanced over the ridge and down each side of the valley on the southern flank of the Klein-Zillebeke spur, with fresh battalions leap-frogging the others when the second phase line had been reached. The new line was held until the 24th Division relieved them on 13 June.

The division returned to the line between 26 and 28 June in the area of Battle wood and Mt Sorrel and began preparations for the next phase of the planned assault. During a German raid on 7 July the division&#x27;s fifth V.C. was won by 2nd Lt. Frederick Youens. The division was relieved in the line by 24th Division by 23 July.

====Third Battle of Ypres====
The battle to deny the Germans the heights east and north of Ypres began on 31 July, while the division was still in training. On 23 August the division was placed in reserve, with the 70th Brigade briefly reinforcing the 14th Division after a German attack until 30 August when the division was relieved. From 3 September the division began to make preparations for its attack due east, at first along either side of the Menin Road, and then north of it, on a front 1,000 yards wide with the objective up to 2000 yards away. The division moved into the line on 15 September. The attack began on 20 September with the 68th and 69th brigades advancing, one battalion of each brigade was to secure each of the three phase lines with the fourth as a reserve. The first line was captured within the hour, the advance to the second faced resistance from pill-boxes and dug-outs as did the advance to the third. The division held this line under German artillery fire until 25 September, relieved by the 33rd and 39th divisions. In this attack the division had lost 397 killed, 1,724 wounded and 179 missing, it had captured 596 prisoners.

Relief was short-lived, as on 27 September the division returned to the front to reinforce the 33rd Division, which had been counterattacked after its arrival. The 69th and 70th brigades fought off further attacks, while the division artillery suffered Mustard Gas attacks, the halting of one determined counterattack on 1 October earning the thanks of the Second Army Commander. The division left the front line on 3 October when relieved by the 5th Division, only to return on 8 October to relieve 7th Division in front of Polygon Wood. Required only to hold the line the division was subject to heavy shelling and lost 275 killed and 954 injured before relief on 14 October.

On 28 October the division was ordered to make ready to move by rail, and on 31 October the destination was confirmed as Italy.

====Italy====

The division arrived in Italy and concentrated around Mantua, South of Verona as part of XIV Corps on 11 November, 16 days after the Battle of Caporetto. From here on 19 November the division marched out to the front line, with the 69th and 70th brigades relieving the 70th Italian Division on the western part of the Montello and the adjoining plain South of the Piave River from 2–4 December. They immediately began to reorganise the defences to the standard defence in depth pattern used in Flanders and began patrols. Relief by the 41st Division, which like the 23rd had also been sent to Italy, began on 13 February 1918, by which time the division had suffered 38 dead and 136 wounded mostly due to artillery and air attack, comparatively small numbers compared to Flanders.

===1918–1919===
The relief was short-lived as the 5th and 41st divisions were withdrawn from Italy to meet the impending German spring offensive (the Germans had also withdrawn six of their divisions from Italy), the division returned to the Montello from 24 to 26 February, and by 8 March patrolling was impossible due to the height of the Piave river. The division was quickly relieved by the 51st Italian Division and by 16 March was out of the line.

====The Asiago Plateau====
It was quickly redeployed to the hills south of, and overlooking the Asiago plain, with its back to the edge of the Asiago plateau, some 3500 feet above the coastal plain, another different environment to Flanders, the 68th and 70th brigades taking over from the 11th Italian Division. Patrolling and raids were once again possible in spite of the cold and snow, and there was very little fire from the Austrian artillery. Relieved by the 48th Division on 23 April the division went into reserve around Trissino.

It was planned to return the division to the plateau on 19 May, for an offensive timed for mid June, on the march back men began to fall sick with influenza, which swept through the division over the next few weeks. Back on the plateau, early June saw raiding of the Austrian lines, when it was learned that the Austrians planned their own offensive for 14 June. After bombarding only the front lines, the Austrian advance was stopped on the 68th Brigade front after three hours by rifle and machine gun fire, here Lt. Jack Youll of 11th Northumberland Fusiliers won the V.C. securing the junction between the 23rd and 48th divisions. To their left the 70th Brigade&#x27;s front line was partly overrun, it was restored by headquarters details and some Italian trench mortar-men led by Lt. Col. Charles Hudson of the 11th Sherwood Foresters for which he received the V.C. Further Austrian assaults were broken up by artillery.

In late July the division was relieved by the 48th Division after having further reinforced the front and reserve lines and conducted trench raids against the Austrians. On 19 August the division returned to the plateau for a planned attack, relieving the 48th Division, and began to conduct trench raids. One of these consisting of over 360 officers and men of 10th Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment failed to achieve surprise and was strongly opposed, despite this, 70 prisoners were taken for the loss of 2 dead, 48 injured and 6 missing. In September the reorganisation that had been applied to divisions in France in March was now applied in Italy, and each brigade lost one of its battalions. The 13th Durham Light Infantry, 9th Yorkshire Regiment and the 11th Sherwood Foresters left the division on 11 September, eventually to form the 74th Brigade of the reconstituted 25th Division.

News was received that the division was expected to return to France, and relief of the division from the plateau completed by 27 September by 20th Italian division, and training in open battle commenced around Costa Bissara then Trissino. Since arriving on the plateau the division had taken over 700 prisoners and deserters.

====Vittorio Veneto====

The planned move to France was cancelled and an attack on the Piave front was to be mounted in its place with the 7th and 23rd British divisions, for which the training remained appropriate. The division took its place in the line on the right bank of the Piave river on 21 October, where the river runs in braided channels over one mile wide around an island, Grave di Papadopoli, which the Austrians used as a post in front of their main line. On the night of 25–26 October the 8th Yorkshire Regiment captured the northern part of the Grave, troops from the 7th division the southern part. The 68th and 69th brigades crossed the river on 27 October, and the planned 3000 yard advance was achieved in spite of the division&#x27;s left flank being unsupported by the 58th Italian division which could not cross the river. The Austrians were, however, demoralised and were retreating behind a rear-guard. The next day the divisions advance of 3,500 yards was done by mid afternoon, during which Pte. Wilfred Wood of the 10th Northumberland Fusiliers won the V.C. for subduing a machine gun nest. Early on 28 October the river Monticano was crossed by the 69th brigade, and in securing the bridgehead (amongst other actions) Sgt William McNally of the 8th Yorkshire Regiment won the division&#x27;s ninth and last V.C.. Stiffening resistance meant the day&#x27;s advance was much less than expected. By the afternoon of 31 October the 69th brigade was in the town of Sacile some 15 miles from the Piave, where the last shot was fired by the division. The advance continued through the remains of Austrian columns attacked by aircraft, until the armistice signed on 3 November came into effect the next day, by which time the division was east of the river Tagliamento.

The division remained in Northern Italy while its men were demobilised, with the division finally disbanded in early March 1919.

During the war the division had suffered 23,574 men killed, wounded and missing.

==Battle insignia==
The practice of wearing battalion specific insignia (often called battle patches) in the B.E.F. began in mid 1915 with the arrival of units of Kitchener&#x27;s Armies and was widespread after the Somme Battles of 1916. The patches shown were worn by the division during 1917. There was no overall division scheme for the battle patches, they were adopted gradually from mid 1916.
==Related formation==

The 23rd (Northumbrian) Division was a 2nd Line Territorial Army duplicate of the 1st Line 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division that was formed shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War and was disbanded in July 1940 after suffering heavy losses in France before the Battle of Dunkirk.

<text>Zhang Jiaxiang (; 30 October 1932 – 29 December 2019), also known as Chia-Hsiang Chang, is a Chinese astronomer affiliated with Purple Mountain Observatory, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and president of the Minor Planet Foundation at that observatory.

He discovered 5384 Changjiangcun, an inner main-belt asteroid of the Hungaria family at the Purple Mountain Observatory in 1957 named after the village near Zhangjiagang, China. It is his only discovery credited by the Minor Planet Center under the name &quot;C.-H. Chang&quot;.

== Biography ==
Zhang Jiaxiang was born on 30 October 1932 in Nanjing, Jiangsu, Republic of China. In 1951, he first joined the Purple Mountain Observatory as a technician, supervised by director Zhang Yuzhe.

In 1957, Zhang Yuzhe and Zhang Jiaxiang published a paper discussing the orbit of artificial satellites. From 1965 to 1972, Zhang led the project of orbit determination of the first Chinese artificial satellite and thereafter the systematic studies of the orbit of Chinese synchronous satellite. His group discovered more than 150 new minor planets and four comets. In the 1990s, he accurately predicted a series of collision times between 19 comet nuclei and Jupiter, based on his self-established numerical model of the Solar System dynamics. He then served as the chief scientist for the construction of the Near Earth Object Telescope.

In recognition of his contributions, the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard &amp; Smithsonian named the asteroid 4760 Jia-xiang after him.

Zhang died on 29 December 2019, aged 87.

<doc id="1304825" wikidata="Q630089" url="?curid=1304825" title="EMD E-unit">
<text>EMD E-units were a line of passenger train streamliner diesel locomotives built by the General Motors Electro-Motive Division (EMD) and its predecessor the Electro-Motive Corporation (EMC). Final assembly for all E-units was in La Grange, Illinois. Production ran from May 1937, to December, 1963. The name &quot;E-units&quot; refers to the model numbers given to each successive type, which all began with E. The E originally stood for eighteen hundred horsepower (1800 hp = 1300 kW), the power of the earliest model, but the letter was kept for later models of higher power.

The predecessors of the E-units were the EMC 1800 hp B-B locomotives built in 1935. These had similar power and mechanical layouts to the E-units, but in boxcab bodies on AAR type B two-axle trucks.

EMC also introduced the TA model in 1937, selling six to the Rock Island. This had similar carbody styling, but otherwise had more in common with UP M-10001, M-10002, and M-10003 to M-10006, in that it was a 1,200 hp (900 kW), single-engined unit on B-B trucks instead of the E-units&#x27; A1A-A1A wheel arrangement. It is not part of the E-unit series.

The EMD F-units followed the basic B-B truck design of the TA model, but with a V-16 EMD 567 prime mover generating 1350 hp as introduced in 1939.

E-units standardized the two engine configuration for passenger locomotives to maximize power and, while the less-reliable Winton Diesel prime movers were in use, faced a less severe loss of power should one of the engines become disabled. While E-units were used singly for shorter trains, longer trains needed multiple locomotive units; many railroads used triple units. E-units could be purchased with or without cabs; units with a cab are called A units or lead units, while cabless units are called B units or booster units. B units did contain hostler controls, but they could not be so controlled on the main line. The locomotive units were linked together with cables which enabled the crew in the lead unit to control the trailing units. Railroads tended to buy either ABA sets (two cab-equipped units facing in opposite directions with a booster in between) or ABB sets (a single cab with a pair of boosters). The former did not need to be turned to pull in either direction, but B units were less expensive than A units and gave a smoother line to the train.

As locomotives of EMC&#x27;s own standardized design produced in-house, expandable to meet various power requirements, the E-units marked the arrival of Diesel power benefiting from economies of scale and were adequate for full-sized consists, a significant threshold in the viability of Diesel motive power as a replacement for steam in passenger service.

== Development ==

The EA/EB, E1, and E2 models were powered by twin 900 hp Winton 201A V-12 engines in each power unit. They were standardized mechanically and in overall design. Union Pacific&#x27;s E2 cab unit was distinguished from the slant-nosed EA and E1 units by its bulbous nose, round porthole style windows, and stainless steel ornamentation on the pilot and nose. The &quot;E&quot; designation originated to denote the locomotive units&#x27; Eighteen hundred horsepower, as opposed to the Twelve hundred horsepower &quot;T&quot; units but was later used to refer to all carbody constructed twin-engine mainline passenger locomotives units produced by EMC. Their twin V-12 diesel engine layout, Blomberg A-1-A trucks, and wheelbase would become the standard for all future E models. EMC/EMD has built all of its major components since 1939.

The E3, E4, E5, and E6 had the new GM-EMC 567 purpose-designed locomotive engines, for a total of . They had the sharply raked &quot;slant nose&quot;, and square windows on the sides (with the exception of Union Pacific orders with porthole style windows). Production stopped in 1942. The E5 designation was used for Chicago Burlington and Quincy&#x27;s stainless steel clad locomotives in keeping with their &quot;Zephyr&quot; theme.

The EA/EB, E1, E2, E4, and E5 model names reflected EMC&#x27;s early convention of assigning a model name for each individual customer order. EMC started to change that convention with the multiple-customer E3 model and the new naming convention was fully incorporated with the E6 model.

The E7 was introduced in 1945, and became the best selling E model. It had the improved 567 &quot;A&quot; engine, and the F style &quot;bulldog nose&quot;.

The E8 and E9 were the final E models. The E8 had 12-V567B engines ( total), while the E9 had uprated 12V-567C engines ( total). They both used the same body style, with a grille along the top of the sides the length of the loco, and several &quot;porthole&quot; windows below it.

Model descriptions are as originally built; EMC/EMD locomotives are often rebuilt to newer standards.

== Engines ==
While there were some cosmetic differences between E-unit models, the major line of development was technological, and largely that of increasing power. The first model, the EA/EB, was rated at 1800 hp (1300 kW), then the E3 was rated at 2,000 hp. The last model, the E9, was rated at 2,400 hp (1800 kW).

Early models (EA/EB through E2) used the Winton 201-A engine that had been developed in the early 1930s by the partnership of General Motors and Winton. While this engine represented a breakthrough in power-to-weight ratios and output flexibility for Diesel engines, it was a compromise between marine and locomotive requirements and wasn&#x27;t well suited to the sustained full throttle operation often needed in railroad service. It was not unusual for heavy repairs to be done &quot;en route&quot; on one engine while the other engine propelled the train at reduced speed. The 201-A engines used in E-units were 900 hp (700 kW) V12s. Experience with the 201-A, which was the first two-stroke Diesel engine in operational use, was invaluable in the development of the next-generation Diesel engine, the EMD 567, a purpose-designed engine that achieved a factor-of-five improvement in piston life for locomotive use.

The E3 introduced the 567 series engine, which would power all later E units, the 567 being a mechanically aspirated two stroke 45 degree V-type with displacement per cylinder, a total of per engine. Models E3 through E9 used the EMD model 567 engine, named after its engine displacement in cubic inches per cylinder. The 567 model had been developed by EMD specifically for locomotive use, and exhibited excellent performance and reliability in high speed passenger train service. The 567 had a greater displacement per cylinder than the 201-A and ran at a higher maximum rpm, elements which when combined gave greater engine output. The 12V-567 V12 model used in the E3 through E6 developed 1000 hp (750 kW). The E7 model used the 12V-567A rated at 1000 hp (750 kW). The E8 used the more advanced 567B unit, with improved exhaust manifolds and other enhancements to give 1,125 hp each. More development resulted in the 1200 hp (900 kW) 567C engine used in the E9.

== Trucks ==
All E-units used the same EMD passenger truck design by engineer Martin Blomberg. This was an A1A-A1A truck, with the outer axles powered and the center axle unpowered. Like the well-known two-axle Blomberg B trucks, these trucks had outside spring hangers between the wheels for better cushioning of side-to-side motion. Also like the Blomberg B, there were no drop equalizers between the axles. Two direct current generators powered four traction motors, two on each truck, in an A1A-A1A arrangement. This truck design was used on all E units and on CB&amp;Q 9908 and MP 7100 power cars. The success of the design is shown by the few changes to it over the years.

== Styling ==
The EA and E1 had sloping noses with recessed headlights, while the E2 had a more bulbous &quot;bulldog&quot; nose. Models E3 through E6 had a sloping nose but with a protruding headlight, while models E7 through E9 used a less sloped (closer to vertical) style like the freight F-units. A patent of 1937 signed by several EMC engineers defined the styling.

Many older E-units were updated to newer styles. The E8 introduced the one-piece stamped Farr stainless-steel side grilles that made a continuous band from front to rear just below the roof, but these were often retrofitted to earlier units. Side windows were half-rounded on the EA/EB, square on the E1, round on the E2, square on most E3 through E7 units, and rounded portholes again on the E8 and E9, but again many railroads updated older locomotives.

The E5 units were unique, produced for the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad in all stainless steel with fluted lower carbody sides, to match the railroad&#x27;s Zephyr passenger trains.

== Other changes ==
Other improvements occurred independently of the change in engine design. The E8, for example, was the first model to incorporate electric cooling fans, and offer dynamic braking as an option.

==Models==
== Surviving E-units ==
A number of E-units survive, many are in good running order. Several railroads retain sets that haul passenger specials, management inspection specials, etc. Others survive in museums or on short lines. 

The Illinois Railway Museum in Union, Illinois has one of the largest collections of operable and preserved E&#x27;s including CB&amp;Q E5 9911A and WSOR 102, one of the few remaining operable B units.

The Southeastern Railway Museum in Duluth, Georgia has Southern Railway #6901, an E8 that once powered the &quot;Southern Crescent&quot;.

<doc id="1304831" wikidata="Q7974510" url="?curid=1304831" title="Watertown Regional Airport">
<text>Watertown Regional Airport , formerly Watertown Municipal Airport, is two miles northwest of Watertown in Codington County, South Dakota, United States.

The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2015-2019 categorized it as a &quot;non-primary commercial service&quot; facility. Federal Aviation Administration data says it had 4,348 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2013, a decrease of 30.5% from 6,254 enplanements in 2012.

== History ==
During World War II, the airfield was used by the United States Army Air Forces as a Second Air Force cold weather bomber training base as an auxiliary to Sioux Falls Army Air Field, and by Air Proving Ground Command.

B-17 Flying Fortress and B-24 Liberator units underwent advanced training before going overseas. One unit that trained here was the 702d Bombardment Squadron of the 445th Bombardment Group.

==Facilities==
The airport covers 919 acres (372 ha) at an elevation of 1,749 feet (533 m). It has two runways: 12/30 is 6,898 by 100 feet (2,103 x 30 m) concrete and 17/35 is 6,893 by 100 feet (2,101 x 30 m) concrete.

In the year ending December 31, 2022 the airport had 12,276 aircraft operations, average 34 per day: 89% general aviation, 6% airline, and 5% air taxi. 52 aircraft were then based at the airport; 43 single-engine, 4 multi-engine, 3 jet, and 2 glider.

From 2012 to 2018, runways 17/35 and 12/30 were overhauled using concrete, replacing worn out asphalt on both runways.

The airport opened its new, state-of-the-art passenger terminal August 10, 2022. The new terminal has two levels, two gates and a movable jet bridge.

The airport has free parking.

== Notable visitors ==
President Barack Obama landed at the airport twice, first in 2008 during his presidential campaign, and on May 8, 2015, to address the graduating class of 2015 from Lake Area Technical Institute. Both times, President Obama arrived on a Boeing 757, during his campaign, on a chartered North American Airlines 757, and as president, using a smaller version of Air Force One (the Boeing C-32).

==Airlines and destinations==
Air service to Watertown is provided by Denver Air Connection using 50-seat Embraer ERJ-145ERs, with daily flights to Chicago and Denver.

=== Historical airline service ===
Airline flights at Watertown started about 1935, with a local company, Watertown Airways, operating scheduled service between Minneapolis–St. Paul International Airport and Watertown. This route continued through South Dakota with additional stops in Huron, Pierre, Phillip, Rapid City, and Spearfish. By 1938, Mid-Continent Airlines was operating a route from Minneapolis-St. Paul to Omaha, Nebraska, with Watertown as one of the intermediate stops. Upon the 1952 acquisition of Mid-Continent by Braniff International, Braniff took over the operation of this route until 1959. North Central arrived in 1957 and successor Republic left in 1985. The first jet flights were North Central DC-9s in 1968.

Mesaba Airlines, operating as Northwest Airlink, and later, Delta Connection, served Watertown for years, with daily Saab 340s to Minneapolis/St. Paul. When Delta quit using the Saab 340 in December 2011, and announced the end of air service to Watertown, flights from Minneapolis temporarily used Delta&#x27;s Canadair Regional Jet 200, until Great Lakes Airlines took over 4 months later.

Great Lakes Airlines offered daily non-stop 19-seat (later 9-seat) Beechcraft 1900Ds to Minneapolis/St. Paul, until city officials voted to end the service, citing unreliability of the airline. Great Lakes ended service to the airport on September 30, 2015.

On August 15, 2016, Aerodynamics, Inc. (later California Pacific Airlines) began flying to Watertown with daily service to Denver, via Pierre, using Embraer 145 jet aircraft. However, the airline suspended all operations nationwide and ended flights to Pierre and Watertown on January 17, 2019.

Air service to Watertown resumed on April 3, 2019, with SkyWest Airlines operating as United Express, using 50-seat Canadair Regional Jet 200s. $3.24 million (or $44.44 per seat) of annual funding from the Essential Air Service program for flights to Denver ended on June 30, 2021. Denver Air Connection was selected for a new contract starting July 1, 2021; at that time, SkyWest also announced their intentions to remain in the Pierre and Watertown markets. SkyWest ended service to Watertown in January 2022.

Sun Country Airlines flew several seasonal charter Boeing 737-800s to Laughlin/Bullhead City International Airport in Arizona, known as &quot;casino or gamblers&#x27; flights,&quot; in coordination with travel agencies in Watertown. These trips ended in 2015.

<doc id="1304851" wikidata="Q7892791" url="?curid=1304851" title="2004 United States presidential election in Iowa">
<text>The 2004 United States presidential election in Iowa took place on November 2, 2004, as part of the 2004 United States presidential election in which all 50 states plus the District of Columbia participated. Voters chose seven electors to represent them in the Electoral College via a popular vote pitting incumbent Republican President George W. Bush and his running mate, Vice President Dick Cheney, against Democratic challenger and Senator from Massachusetts John F. Kerry and his running mate, Senator from North Carolina John Edwards. Six third parties were also on the ballot.

Iowa was won by President George W. Bush by a 0.67% margin of victory, or 10,059 votes, despite losing the state to Al Gore four years earlier. Prior to the election, most news organizations considered this a swing state. The Democrats had won Iowa in the previous four presidential elections, though only narrowly in 2000. Gore had won the state by only 0.32 percentage points, or 4,144 votes, a much weaker margin compared to the prior three elections. In 1988, Democrat Michael Dukakis won the state by 10.21% even in an otherwise Republican landslide year, and Bill Clinton carried the state by 6.02% in 1992 and 10.34% in 1996. Iowa was one of just two states, along with New Mexico, to vote for Gore in 2000 but flip to Bush in 2004, although it was won both times by narrow margins. Iowa was one of two states to be won by George W. Bush in at least one of his presidential runs that his father George H. W. Bush never carried, the other being West Virginia.

Bush became the first Republican to win Iowa since Ronald Reagan had done so in 1984. As of the 2024 presidential election, this is the last time a Republican won Iowa by only a plurality. Until 2020, this was the last time Iowa did not vote for the same candidate as neighboring Wisconsin. This election marked a new streak of Iowa voting for the winning ticket in every election along with Florida and Ohio until 2020, when all three voted for the losing candidate. With Iowa, Florida, and Ohio&#x27;s winning streaks no longer being intact, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania are now all tied for the longest streaks of siding with the winner, all three of which most recently failing to do so when they backed Kerry during his losing presidential bid in 2004.

Bush is also the only US president to win the White House without Iowa and then carry it upon winning re-election. This is the opposite of Woodrow Wilson and FDR, as they are the only two presidents to have carried Iowa upon winning office but lose it upon re-election.

* 2004 Iowa Democratic presidential caucuses

==Campaign==
===Predictions===
There were 12 news organizations who made state-by-state predictions of the election. Here are their last predictions before election day.

===Polling===
Polls showed the state was a pure tossup with neither candidate reaching a consistent lead. The last three polls averaged both candidates at 48%, with the last-second deciders the key to victory. The final RealClearPolitics average gave Bush leading with a margin of 0.3%, with 47.4% to Kerry at 47.1% and Nader at 1.0%.

===Fundraising===
Bush raised $671,335. Kerry raised $449,980.

===Advertising and visits===
The Kerry campaign visited the state 11 times to Bush&#x27;s 10 times. Both campaigns spent between $400,000 to $600,000 each week in television advertising.

==Analysis==
Kerry&#x27;s strength in the state lay in the highly populated counties of Polk (Des Moines), Linn (Cedar Rapids), Scott (Davenport), Johnson (Iowa City), and Black Hawk (Waterloo). Johnson County, home to the University of Iowa, gave Kerry 64.01% of its vote, Kerry&#x27;s best performance in the state. However, Kerry also did well in a series of rural and small-town counties in northeastern Iowa and along the Mississippi River, many of which had been traditionally Democratic since at least the 1980s. He won eight of the ten counties along the Mississippi River, including Dubuque County, which had given Gore his margin in the state in 2000. The 1st and 2nd congressional districts were both carried by Kerry, despite being represented by Republicans in Congress. Dubuque is located within the 1st district while the 2nd district contains Cedar Rapids, Iowa City, and Muscatine.

However, Bush performed respectably even in areas of Democratic strength; in only two counties did he obtain less than 40% of the vote. Additionally, he was able to offset Kerry&#x27;s strength in the population centers and in the northeast and Mississippi River counties with landslide margins in a series of rural counties in the west of the state, as well as by dominating the state&#x27;s south. Bush&#x27;s best performance in the state was in Sioux County, where he won with 85.87% of the vote. His raw vote margin in Sioux County of 11,970 votes alone was greater than his raw vote margin over Kerry statewide. Bush won three congressional districts in the state: the 3rd district, home to the Democratic city of Des Moines and its Republican suburbs, gave Bush a razor thin 50–50 margin, despite re-electing Democrat Leonard Boswell to Congress. The 4th district also gave Bush a narrow margin, giving him 51% of the vote. The now obsolete 5th district in the western part of the state was home to Iowa&#x27;s most Republican areas, having elected Steve King to Congress in 2002; it gave Bush a landslide 21-point margin.

In terms of counties carried, both candidates flipped counties. Bush flipped four that voted for Gore in 2000, while Kerry flipped five that voted for Bush in 2000. This election coincided with the 2004 United States Senate election in Iowa, where Republican Chuck Grassley was effortlessly re-elected with 70.83% of the vote.

Iowa would return to the Democratic column in the next two elections, voting for Barack Obama by 9.54% in 2008 and 5.81% in 2012. However, in 2016, it returned to the Republican column when Donald Trump would win the state by 9.41%, the largest margin of victory for a Republican presidential nominee in the state since Ronald Reagan&#x27;s in 1980.

==Results==
===By county===

====Counties that flipped from Democratic to Republican====

* Cedar (largest city: Tipton)
* Greene (largest city: Jefferson)
* Louisa (largest city: Wapello)
* Winnebago (largest city: Forest City)

====Counties that flipped from Republican to Democratic====

* Fayette (largest city: Oelwein)
* Jasper (largest city: Newton)
* Jefferson (largest city: Fairfield)
* Poweshiek (largest city: Grinnell)
* Winneshiek (largest city: Decorah)

===By congressional district===
Bush won 3 of 5 congressional districts, including one held by a Democrat. Kerry won two held by Republicans.
==Electors==
Iowa voters cast their ballots for electors: representatives to the Electoral College. Iowa has 7 electors because it has 5 congressional districts and 2 senators. All candidates who appear on the ballot or qualify to receive write-in votes must submit a list of 7 electors, who pledge to vote for their candidate and their running mate. Whoever wins the majority of votes in the state is awarded all 7 electoral votes. Their chosen electors then vote for president and vice president. Although electors are pledged to their candidate and running mate, they are not obligated to vote for them. An elector who votes for someone other than his or her candidate is known as a faithless elector.

The electors of each state and the District of Columbia met on December 13, 2004, to cast their votes for president and vice president. The Electoral College itself never meets as one body. Instead the electors from each state and the District of Columbia meet in their respective capitols.

The following were the members of the Electoral College from Iowa. All were pledged to and voted for Bush and Cheney.

<text>Tyuyamunite (pronounced tuh-YOO-ya-moon-ite) is a very rare uranium mineral with formula Ca(UO2)2V2O8·(5–8)H2O. It is a member of the carnotite group. It is a bright, canary-yellow color because of its high uranium content. Also, because of tyuyamunite&#x27;s high uranium content, it is radioactive. It was named by Konstantin Avtonomovich Nenadkevich, in 1912, after its type locality, Tyuya-Muyun, Fergana Valley, Kyrgyzstan.

==Formation and transformation==
Tyuyamunite is formed by the weathering of uraninite, a uranium-bearing mineral. Tyuyamunite, being a hydrous mineral, contains water. Yet when it is exposed to the atmosphere it loses its water. This process changes tyuyamunite into a different mineral known as metatyuyamunite Ca(UO2)2(VO4)2·3-5H2O.

<text>Captain Midnight (later rebranded on television as Jet Jackson, Flying Commando) is an American adventure franchise first broadcast as a radio serial from 1938 to 1949. The character&#x27;s popularity throughout the 1940s and into the mid-1950s extended to serial films (1942), a television show (1954–1956), a syndicated newspaper strip (1942 – late 1940s), and a comic book title (1942–1948).

==Radio origins==
Sponsored by the Skelly Oil Company, the Captain Midnight radio program was the creation of radio scripters Wilfred G. Moore and Robert M. Burtt, who had previously scored a success for Skelly with their boy pilot adventure serial &quot;The Air Adventures of Jimmie Allen&quot;.

Developed at the Blackett, Sample and Hummert advertising agency in Chicago, &quot;Captain Midnight&quot; began as a syndicated show on October 17, 1938, airing through the spring of 1940 on a few Midwest stations, including Chicago&#x27;s WGN. In 1940, Ovaltine, a product of The Wander Company, took over sponsorship. With Pierre Andre as announcer, the series was then heard nationally on the Mutual Radio Network where it remained until 1942. It moved to the Merchandise Mart and the NBC Blue Network in September 1942. When the U.S. Government broke up the NBC Red and Blue Networks, Ovaltine moved the series back to Mutual, beginning September 1945, where it remained until December 1949.

The show was known for the imaginative use of exciting technological advancements to create narrative thrills, inspiring young audiences to dream of future advances.

==Premise==

The title character, originally Captain Jim &quot;Red&quot; Albright, was a World War I U.S. Army pilot. His Captain Midnight code name was given by a general who sent him on a high-risk mission from which he returned at the stroke of 12. When the show began in 1938, Albright was a private aviator who helped people, but his situation changed in 1940. When the show was taken over by Ovaltine, the origin story explained how Albright was recruited to head the Secret Squadron, an aviation-oriented paramilitary organization fighting sabotage and espionage during the period prior to the United States&#x27; entry into World War II. The Secret Squadron acted both within and outside the United States.

When the United States was attacked at Pearl Harbor, which curiously was foreshadowed in the program, the show shifted the Secret Squadron&#x27;s duties to fight the more unconventional aspects of the war. Besides the stock villain, Ivan Shark, the war years introduced Axis villains Baron von Karp, Admiral Himakito and von Schrecker. The Secret Squadron wartime activities were usually outside the continental United States, with adventures in Europe, South America, the Pacific, and continental Asia. War-related subject matter included the theft of an experimental Flying Wing aircraft, radar coupled antiaircraft guns, jet aircraft and other weapons.

After the war, some of the newer villains used war surplus equipment to carry out their activities. Secret Squadron activities shifted to contending with criminals as well as spies. The action continued to operate internationally, with adventures in South America and Africa as well as within the United States.

The show was extremely popular, with an audience in the millions. Just under half the listeners were adult, and it was a favorite of World War II United States Army Air Force crews when they were stationed in the U.S. Radio premiums offered by the series (usually marked with Midnight&#x27;s personal symbol of a winged clock with the hands pointing to midnight) included decoders. These Code-O-Graphs were used by listeners to decipher encrypted messages previewing the next day&#x27;s episode, usually broadcast once a week. Other premiums included rings, telescopes, and World War II items. (The broadcast messages were encrypted with relatively trivial monoalphabetic substitution ciphers with word division.)

The scripts depicted women who were treated as equals, not just characters waiting to be rescued. Both Joyce Ryan of the Secret Squadron and Fury Shark, daughter of villain Ivan Shark, pulled their own weight in the adventures. Joyce went on commando raids and became involved in aerial dogfights during World War II.

==Characters==

*Captain Midnight – World War I aviator who leads the Secret Squadron, though he spends much time in the field actively contending with crime, espionage, and sabotage. He is an extremely skilled aviator with an ability to fly almost any aircraft superlatively. The Captain is usually accompanied by a team consisting of three Secret Squadron members (played by Ed Prentiss, Bill Bouchey and Paul Barnes, with Ed Prentiss also playing his part as Captain Midnight the longest).
*Chuck Ramsay – Captain Midnight&#x27;s ward, a young man in his late teens or early twenties who is a Secret Squadron agent. Prior to the formation of the Secret Squadron, he shared adventures with his guardian. A member of Captain Midnight&#x27;s usual team, he was played by Jules Getlin, Dolph Nelson, Billy Rose, Jack Bivans and Johnny Coons.
*Ichabod &quot;Ikky&quot; Mudd – The Secret Squadron&#x27;s Chief Mechanic. Mudd knew Captain Midnight briefly before the Secret Squadron&#x27;s formation, and joined the Squadron shortly after it was formed. A member of Captain Midnight&#x27;s usual team played by Hugh Studebaker, Sherman Marks, Art Hern, and Sid Melton on television, he was responsible for the development of the Code-O-Graph and also developed some weapons before and during World War II.
*Joyce Ryan – A young woman in her late teens or early twenties who is a Secret Squadron agent. She was originally discovered as an amnesiac by Captain Midnight and Chuck Ramsay during a 1941 skirmish with the forces of Ivan Shark. She became a Secret Squadron member after several adventures with Captain Midnight, Chuck Ramsay, and Ichabod Mudd, replacing an earlier female companion named Patsy Donovan. Prior to World War II, she regained her memory and elected to remain in the Secret Squadron. A member of Captain Midnight&#x27;s usual team, she was played by Marilou Neumayer and Angeline Orr.
*Agent Kelly, SS-11 – Lyle William Kelly, a Secret Squadron agent who frequently accompanied Captain Midnight&#x27;s usual team on their adventures. Kelly was Captain Midnight&#x27;s usual liaison to his superior, Major Barry Steele. Kelly was played by Olan Soule.
*Major Barry Steele – U.S. Army Intelligence officer recalled from inactive duty as Captain Midnight&#x27;s superior officer. Steele usually worked in the background but often provided the Secret Squadron with data and equipment. He often provided assignments for the Secret Squadron but left its administration to Captain Midnight.
*&quot;Mr. Jones&quot; – Pseudonym used by the mysterious highly placed government official who created the Secret Squadron and made Captain Midnight its commander, implicitly the President of the United States.
*Ivan Shark – Ruthless criminal mastermind who developed a highly efficient mercenary organization. Shark often sold services of his organization to agents of foreign governments. Played by Boris Aplon, he was the default villain on the radio program. Although he was captured or thought killed many times, he always returned to plague the hero until, in the final episode, he was eaten by a polar bear while Captain Midnight watched from a plane overhead.
*Fury Shark  – Ivan Shark&#x27;s devoted daughter and sadistic second in command in his organization. She frequently took command when Ivan Shark was unable to function (e.g., in prison). Highly intelligent, she always proved herself capable. She was played by Rene Rodier and Sharon Grainger.
*Gardo – One of Ivan Shark&#x27;s principal aides. Gardo was portrayed as being loyal but relatively slow witted, and frequently the butt of Shark&#x27;s wrath. Occasionally acted as Ivan Shark&#x27;s pilot.
*Fang – One of Ivan Shark&#x27;s pre-war aides, Fang was an Asian, who always addressed Shark as &quot;Master.&quot; His presence vanished after World War II.
*The Barracuda – Head of an extensive criminal organization similar to Ivan Shark&#x27;s, but headquartered in the Orient. The Barracuda headed the Tiger Tong, a Chinese gang, and had his own private air force. Killed in 1942.
*Baron von Karp – Nazi World War II villain with whom the Secret Squadron contended, first in the United States, then in occupied Europe.
*Admiral Himakito – Japanese officer with whom the Secret Squadron contended in the Pacific theater during World War II.

==In other media==
===Film===

Popular actor-stunt man Dave O&#x27;Brien had the title role in the Columbia Pictures 15-episode serial &quot;Captain Midnight&quot; (1942). The serial used some of the characters from the radio show, but differed significantly from the radio program. Missing were the Secret Squadron and the Squadron equipment. The Captain Midnight character was presented as a masked secret identity for Captain Albright. The serial was later aired (one chapter per week) on select TV stations in the fall of 1953 and early 1954, under the title &quot;Captain Midnight&#x27;s Adventure Theatre&quot;. (The TV show began a bit later, on September 4, 1954, on a weekly basis on CBS.

===Television===
The &quot;Captain Midnight&quot; TV series, produced by Screen Gems and starring Richard Webb, began September 9, 1954, on CBS, continuing for 39 episodes until January 21, 1956. Each episode was thirty minutes. (The first season ran 26 episodes from September 9, 1954, through February 26, 1955; the second season ran 13 episodes from October 29, 1955, through January 21, 1956). The sponsors were Ovaltine and Kix Cereal/General Mills.

In the television program, Captain Midnight (now a veteran of the Korean War) heads the Secret Squadron as a private organization, in contrast to the radio show. As with the Fawcett comic, the only other character of the radio show held over was Ichabod (Ikky) Mudd (played by Sid Melton), who was used for comic relief. Another regular character was Dr. Aristotle &quot;Tut&quot; Jones, Midnight&#x27;s resident scientist, played by character actor Olan Soule. (Soule was the only actor to perform in both the radio program and the television program. In the radio program, he played Agent Kelly, SS-11.)

The aircraft featured in the series is the Douglas D-558-2 Skyrocket, named the Silver Dart, and was based on using both models and occasionally stock footage. The series filmed at the Ray Corrigan Ranch in Simi Valley, California. Unlike other TV action heroes, Captain Midnight never ventured into space, but rather was confined to Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Viewers could send away for a special decoder device and membership kit by including the inner wax seal from a jar of Ovaltine to &quot;Capt. Midnight, Box P, Chicago 77, Illinois&quot;.

The show was produced by George Bilson, with theme music by Don Ferris. Special effects were handled by the Dallons brothers. Some episodes included movie actors such as Frank Lacteen, Sally Fraser, Harry Lauter, I. Stanford Jolley, Mel Welles, Byron Foulger, Shelley Fabares, Buddy Baer and others.

When the TV series went into syndication in 1958 via Telescreen Advertising, Ovaltine was no longer the sponsor. However, The Wander Company owned the rights to the character&#x27;s name &quot;Captain Midnight,&quot; forcing a title change by Screen Gems from &quot;Captain Midnight&quot; to &quot;Jet Jackson, Flying Commando&quot;, and all references in the episodes to Captain Midnight were redubbed &quot;Jet Jackson.&quot; The series (as &quot;Jet Jackson&quot;) was syndicated well into the early 1960s. The &quot;Jet Jackson&quot; name was also used for the show&#x27;s syndication in Australia in order to avoid confusion with a fictional bushranger also named Captain Midnight.

===Comic strip===

A newspaper comic strip, based closely on the radio program, debuted in 1942. The strip, bylined by &quot;Jonwan&quot; (Erwin L. Hess) was drawn in a style similar to that of Milton Caniff. The major characters of the radio show were retained, including Joyce Ryan, Chuck Ramsay, Ichabod Mudd and Major Barry Steele. The strip was released by the Chicago Sun Syndicate on June 29, 1942, and ran until the late 1940s. France Herron wrote the strip from 1942 to 1944.

The strip had some differences from the radio show and did not reprise the radio adventures. In the strip, Captain Midnight was referred to as &quot;an unofficial fighter for freedom,&quot; which is at variance from the radio show, where the Secret Squadron was set up by a high governmental official (&quot;Mr. Jones&quot;), which the hero was recruited to head (unless, of course, &quot;unofficial&quot; meant, in the modern pop-culture sense, &quot;subject to official disavowal if caught or killed on a politically sensitive mission&quot;). Even with the variants, it was far closer to the radio show than any of the other spinoffs.

===Comic book===
Dell Comics published Captain Midnight adventures in &quot;The Funnies&quot; #57 (Captain Midnight&#x27;s first appearance in comics), #59, 61–63 (Sept. 1941, Nov. 1941–Mar. 1942) and &quot;Popular Comics&quot; #76–78 (June–August 1942).

Fawcett published 67 issues of &quot;Captain Midnight Comics&quot; from Sept. 1942 to Sept 1948. Otto Binder was one of the writers on the comic book. The Fawcett character bore little resemblance to the radio character, and only the character Ichabod Mudd appeared regularly in the comic as the sidekick Sgt. Twilight.

Captain Midnight in the comic wore a skintight scarlet suit and used an array of gizmos like Doctor Mid-Nite which released clouds of blinding darkness, the infra-red &quot;Doom-Beam Torch&quot; which he used to burn his emblem into walls and unlucky villains, and a &quot;Gliderchute&quot; (similar to the flying Wingsuit) attached to the sides of his costume.

In his Captain Albright secret identity he was a genius-level inventor like Edison. He had a secret laboratory in the desert.

The Fawcett &quot;Captain Midnight&quot; series was reprinted in England by L. Miller &amp; Son in 40 issues in 1950–1953.

In 2010, Moonstone Books&#x27; revival of the Hillman Periodicals 1940s title &quot;Air Fighters Comics&quot; published its issue #1, which included a new Captain Midnight story.

In 2012, Dark Horse Comics reintroduced the character, with a three-part story written by Joshua Williamson with art by Victor Ibañez and Pere Pérez. In June 2013, &quot;Captain Midnight&quot; #1 was released by the same publisher as an ongoing series.

===Books===
In 1942 Whitman Publishing released &quot;Joyce of the Secret Squadron&quot; as part of the Authorized Editions series.

In 2000, McFarland released &quot;Radio&#x27;s Captain Midnight: The Wartime Biography.&quot; The contents were derived from the Ovaltine-sponsored radio programs, covering the adventures through the close of World War II.

In 2010, Moonstone Books published a collection of new Captain Midnight short stories entitled &quot;Captain Midnight Chronicles&quot;. The book&#x27;s stories reflect an amalgamated version of the Captain Midnight character and his supporting cast, and incorporate elements from the various media incarnations of the character, including the radio and television series, the Columbia movie serial and Fawcett comic book.

<text>Yuanyang County (; Hani: &quot;Yeiqyaq&quot;) is located in Honghe Prefecture in southeastern Yunnan province, China, along the Red River. It is well known for its spectacular rice-paddy terracing. In 2013, part of the county formed the Honghe Hani Rice Terraces World Heritage Site, the 45th World Heritage Site in China.

==Overview==
It covers an area of and has a population of approximately 365,000 (2002), of which 88% belong to ethnic minorities and 95% is associated with agriculture. The majority of the inhabitants of the county are from the Hani ethnic group. The GDP of Yuanyang county in 2021 was 9,312 million Yuan. The administrative seat of the county is the town of &quot;Nansha&quot; (a.k.a. New Yuanyang) down in the Red River valley at an elevation of 240 meters. It is situated towards the north-east of the former administrative seat &quot;Xinjie&quot; (a.k.a. Old Yuanyang or just Yuanyang) to which it is connected by a long twisting mountain road. To the south of Old Yuanyang, the town of Panzhihua is positioned near the top of another major valley of rice-terraces. There are a total of 928 settlements in Yuanyang county, 826 of them being inhabited by only one single ethnic group.

The town of Old Yuanyang is a Hani minority settlement atop a ridge of the Ailao mountain range at an elevation of around 1570 metres. It is a popular destination with photographers due to the vast areas of nearby mountains which have been cultivated into terraced rice paddies for at least the past 1300 years by the Hani people. Despite its scenic and cultural attractions, mass tourism has not developed in this region, mainly due to its remote location, lack of a nearby airport and road conditions.

The terraced areas of interest to visitors are mainly found between 1000 and 2000 metres above sea level. The winter temperatures here, although never freezing, are such that they only support one rice crop a year. After the harvest, from mid-September till mid-November depending on the elevation, the terraces are filled with water until April, when planting begins.

The vast majority of the ethnic minority women in Yuanyang county still wear traditional clothes as their daily attire. The main ethnic group is the Hani who share the region with several other minorities such as the Yi and Miao. Market days in the villages tend to be very colourful when the different minority groups in the vicinity, each in their own traditional costume, come together to trade and socialise.

==Administrative divisions==

Vertical distribution of the various ethnic minority groups
The Hani and Yi, the creators of the monumental rice terraced mountains which have made Yuanyang famous, are the original inhabitants of these regions. Both their languages belong to the Tibeto-Burman group. Their villages can mainly be found between 1300 and 1600 metres above sea level.

The Dai moved here 700 years ago, and the Zhuang 400 years ago. Both their languages belong to the Tai–Kadai language group. Their villages are situated in the warmer areas below 700 metres elevation, near and along the rivers. Their main crop is rice grown in paddy fields.

The Miao and Yao (of the Hmong–Mien language group) are fairly recent arrivals to the region, only settling here 200 and 270 years ago. Their villages are in the cooler and drier upland areas, between 1600 and 1800 metres above sea level, where they grow maize.

<text>William Willis (1 May 183714 February 1894) was an Irish medical doctor who joined the British mission in Japan in 1861.

==Biography==
Willis was born in Maguiresbridge, County Fermanagh, Ireland in 1837. In 1855 he was enrolled at the faculty of medicine in the University of Glasgow (Scotland), where he completed his pre-medical and pre-clinical studies. He then transferred to the University of Edinburgh. After his graduation in May 1859 with the thesis &quot;Theory of ulceration&quot; he became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh and received the degree of Doctor of Medicine of the University with a thesis on the &quot;Theory of Ulceration&quot;. He then worked at the Middlesex Hospital located in London. In 1861 he was accepted for a medical post with the British legation in Japan. He reached Edo in May 1862 to begin his duties as medical officer and clerk under Sir Harry Smith Parkes. Between 1862 and 1867 he worked mainly in Yokohama. Being there on the day of Charles Lennox Richardson&#x27;s death at the hands of retainers of daimyō Shimazu Hisamitsu (otherwise Shimazu Saburō), Willis performed the autopsy.

Among his students was Takaki Kanehiro, the first scientist-physician to prove that beriberi was connected to malnutrition, and the founder of Japan&#x27;s first private medical college. During the unsettled years at the end of the Tokugawa bakufu and the early Meiji Restoration, Willis treated the British nationals wounded in the Namamugi Incident and the Bombardment of Kagoshima.

Willis later participated to the Boshin War as the head of medical operations for the Satsuma Domain. During the Battle of Toba–Fushimi, he set up a military hospital in the temple of Shōkokuji (相国寺) in Kyoto, not far from the front line. He continued to support the medical operations of the Satsuma side throughout the Boshin War.

Willis was later appointed professor and clinical chief of the &quot;Igakko&quot; (later the faculty of medicine of Tokyo Imperial University).

In 1870, Willis resigned to become head of the hospital and medical school in Kagoshima at the invitation of Saigō Takamori. The institution later became the medical department of Kagoshima University. Willis married a Japanese woman in Kagoshima, Enatsu Yae (1850-1931), the daughter of a former retainer of Shimazu Nariakira, with whom he had a son, Albert (1873-1943). With the outbreak of the Satsuma Rebellion in 1877, Willis returned to Tokyo.

Willis returned to England in 1881, and became a Fellow of the Royal Surgical Medical Association (F.R.C.S.).

In 1885, Willis was appointed, on the recommendation of his good friend Ernest Satow, as a doctor with the British Consulate General in Bangkok. In addition to public hospitals, he established a large-scale private hospital in Bangkok, and treated King Rama V and the king&#x27;s brother, returning to England in 1892.

According to Satow, Willis was unusually tall at 190.5 cm, and weighed 127 kg.

<doc id="1304919" wikidata="Q532061" url="?curid=1304919" title="Angel of Retribution">
<text>Angel of Retribution is the fifteenth studio album by English heavy metal band Judas Priest, released in 2005. It is the band&#x27;s first album since 1990&#x27;s &quot;Painkiller&quot; to feature Rob Halford. The album debuted at on the US Billboard 200 chart, which makes it the fourth highest charting Judas Priest album in the US. The album was produced by Roy Z, who co-wrote the song &quot;Deal with the Devil&quot;. It won a 2005 Metal Hammer award for Best Album. In the 2005 &quot;Burrn!&quot; magazine Readers&#x27; Pop Poll, it was voted Best Album of the Year and Best Album Cover.

==Album information==
&quot;Angel of Retribution&quot; was originally scheduled to be released in late 2004, but the label changed the release date to early 2005, hoping for better sales. Early pressings have the year 2004 printed on the covers. In a descriptive detail about the album, Glenn Tipton explains, &quot;We&#x27;ve got a lot of energy. We&#x27;re firing on all cylinders and it&#x27;s obvious on this album. I think it&#x27;s the most natural JUDAS PRIEST album. A lot of people who have listened to it have said it&#x27;s timeless. You couldn&#x27;t really date it.&quot; Rob Halford adds, &quot;That decade that we were out of each other&#x27;s company just seems to have vanished in smoke. When we got together to begin writing the new material for &#x27;Angel of Retribution&#x27;, it was really a continuation of where we would have been had we made the next record after &#x27;Painkiller&#x27;. All the pieces were already in place.&quot;

Six of the album&#x27;s songs have been performed live, with &quot;Hellrider&quot;, &quot;Deal With the Devil&quot;, &quot;Worth Fighting For&quot; and &quot;Revolution&quot; only appearing on 2005 setlists. &quot;Judas Rising&quot; was also performed in 2005 and returned for the 2011–12 and 2019 tours, and &quot;Angel&quot; being added to the setlist in 2008-9 and then reappearing for a few shows in 2018.

==Lyrical references==
Within the album, nods to the sound of past albums and songs are found, as well as lyrics that apparently reference earlier songs. The song &quot;Demonizer&quot; references both &quot;The Hellion&quot; from &quot;Screaming for Vengeance&quot;, as well as &quot;Painkiller&quot; from &quot;Painkiller&quot;. &quot;Hellrider&quot; mentions the title track of &quot;Ram It Down&quot;, and &quot;Tyrant&quot; from &quot;Sad Wings of Destiny&quot;. &quot;Eulogy&quot; references &quot;Stained Class&quot; and &quot;The Sentinel&quot; from the albums &quot;Stained Class&quot; and &quot;Defenders of the Faith&quot;, respectively. Finally, &quot;Worth Fighting For&quot; acts as a sequel/prequel to &quot;Desert Plains&quot; from &quot;Point of Entry&quot;.

The song &quot;Deal With the Devil&quot; can be viewed as an autobiography of Judas Priest, telling their origins from the Black Country of England&#x27;s West Midlands, mentioning their transitory days gigging around England and practising at the Church of Holy Joseph in Walsall, which is where Judas Priest was effectively born. &quot;Deal With the Devil&quot; also mentions the song &quot;Blood Red Skies&quot; from &quot;Ram It Down&quot; and &quot;Take on the World&quot; from &quot;Killing Machine&quot;.

==Reception==
The album generally received favourable reviews from critics and fans. However, Classic Rock Magazine reviewer Geoff Barton awarded the album three out of five stars in March 2005, dropping the overall score solely due to his dislike of the track &#x27;&quot;Lochness&quot;. Barton claimed that the track sends &#x27;the entire record crashing down in flames... Lochness is so ill-conceived, so long-drawn out, droning and dismal, that is single-handedly destroys what would otherwise have been a triumphant Halford-led return.&#x27; The song, however, has since been reappraised by many fans as underrated.

==DualDisc==
The album was released on the DualDisc format which had traditional CD content on one side and DVD content on the other side. The DVD side of this album featured a documentary entitled &quot;Reunited&quot; as well as the entire album in an enhanced audio format. It was released as a 2-disc set containing Compact Disc audio and DVD video in Europe, Japan and USA.

<doc id="1304940" wikidata="Q7892945" url="?curid=1304940" title="2004 United States presidential election in New Jersey">
<text>The 2004 United States presidential election in New Jersey took place on November 2, 2004, and was part of the 2004 United States presidential election. Voters chose 15 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.

New Jersey was won by Democratic nominee John Kerry by a 6.68% margin of victory. Prior to the election, most news organizations considered it as a state Kerry would win, or a blue state. Due to the impact of the September 11, 2001 attacks, however, and Governor James McGreevey&#x27;s resignation following threats of a sexual harassment lawsuit, the state was considered a potentially closer than usual race. Polls showed Senator John F. Kerry with a slim lead throughout the campaign and the Republicans invested some campaign funds in the state. In the end, Kerry carried New Jersey by a somewhat comfortable margin, albeit narrower than usual for most other 21st-century Democrats.

This is the first time since 1880 in which the Republican nominee won the popular vote without New Jersey, and the first time it voted for the popular vote loser since 1976. To date, this is the last election in which the Republican candidate won Somerset County. 

==Primaries==
* 2004 New Jersey Democratic presidential primary

==Campaign==
===Predictions===
There were 12 news organizations who made state-by-state predictions of the election. Here are their last predictions before election day.

===Polling===
Kerry won most preelection polls taken in this state albeit by small margins. The final 3 polling average showed the Democratic leading 49% to 42%.

===Fundraising===
Bush raised $5,934,011. Kerry raised $6,513,274.

===Advertising and visits===
President George W. Bush visited Marlton, New Jersey, in Burlington County for a rally on October 18, 2004.

==Analysis==
Generally, Kerry was very dominant in the urban centers of the state, particularly in Essex, Hudson, and Camden Counties. However, Bush made inroads in Bergen County, where many wealthy residents reside, and in other South Jersey counties. Bush controlled largely rural parts of the state, such as the Northwest (Hunterdon, Somerset, and Morris are also among the 10 wealthiest counties in America) and Salem County. Monmouth County&#x27;s wealthy population and Ocean and Cape May Counties&#x27; older population also contributed to Bush&#x27;s relative success in this largely Democratic state.

This would also be the first election in which a Northern Democrat carried New Jersey since 1960 when fellow Massachusetts Democrat John F. Kennedy did so. The previous three Democratic presidential candidates to carry the state were all from the South (Lyndon B. Johnson was from Texas, Bill Clinton from Arkansas, and Al Gore from Tennessee), even though New Jersey is a northern state. This is the first time a president was elected twice without ever carrying any of the state&#x27;s electoral votes either time, and only the second occasion (after 1864) that any president won two terms without ever carrying the state&#x27;s popular vote either time.

==Results==
===By county===


====Counties that flipped from Democratic to Republican====
*Salem (largest municipality: Pennsville Township)
*Monmouth (largest municipality: Middletown Township)

===By congressional district===
Kerry won 7 of 13 congressional districts.
==Electors==
Technically the voters of NJ cast their ballots for electors: representatives to the Electoral College. NJ is allocated 15 electors because it has 13 congressional districts and 2 senators. All candidates who appear on the ballot or qualify to receive write-in votes must submit a list of 15 electors, who pledge to vote for their candidate and his or her running mate. Whoever wins the majority of votes in the state is awarded all 15 electoral votes. Their chosen electors then vote for president and vice president. Although electors are pledged to their candidate and running mate, they are not obligated to vote for them. An elector who votes for someone other than his or her candidate is known as a faithless elector.

The electors of each state and the District of Columbia met on December 13, 2004, to cast their votes for president and vice president. The Electoral College itself never meets as one body. Instead the electors from each state and the District of Columbia met in their respective capitols.

The following were the members of the Electoral College from the state. All 15 were pledged for Kerry/Edwards.

<doc id="1304973" wikidata="Q968149" url="?curid=1304973" title="Sett">
<text>A sett or set is a badger&#x27;s den. It usually consists of a network of tunnels and numerous entrances. The largest setts are spacious enough to accommodate 15 or more animals with up to of tunnels and as many as 40 openings. Such elaborate setts with extensive tunneling take many years for badgers to complete. One sett in Southern England spreads over an estimated area in excess of 2,000 square metres – precise measurement has not been attempted. Another sett, in north-eastern Germany, has been shown to have been in use for over ten thousand years. Setts are typically excavated in soil that is well drained and easy to dig, such as sand, and situated on sloping ground where there is some cover.

Sett tunnels are usually between beneath the ground, and they incorporate larger chambers used for sleeping or rearing young. These chambers are lined with dry bedding material such as grass, straw, dead leaves or bracken. Tunnels are wider than they are high, typically around wide by high, which matches a badger&#x27;s wide and stocky build.
The material excavated by the badgers forms large heaps on the slope below the sett. Among this material may be found old bedding material, stones with characteristic heavy scratch-marks, and sometimes even the bones of long-dead badgers cleared out by later generations. Most setts have several active entrances, several more that are used rarely, and some that have fallen into disuse.

Setts are not always excavated entirely in soil. Sometimes they are under the shelter of a shed, or in a pile of timber or rocks. Badgers also excavate them under man-made structures like building foundations, concrete sidewalks, and paved roadways. This can lead to subsidence, and other damage to such structures.

Badger colonies often use several setts: a large main sett in the center of a colony&#x27;s territory and occupied by most of a colony&#x27;s members, and one or more smaller outlier setts. Outlier setts may have only two or three entrances and may be used by a small number of colony members when nearby food sources are in season or in autumn when the main sett is crowded with the year&#x27;s young.

Badgers typically retreat to their setts at daybreak and come out at dusk. In cold regions, setts are dug below the level at which the ground freezes, and all members of the clan sleep in the same chamber, possibly to share body heat.

Sometimes setts or parts of setts that are not being used by badgers are occupied by rabbits or foxes.

==Legal protections==
In the United Kingdom, badger setts are protected from disturbance or destruction under the Protection of Badgers Act 1992.

<doc id="1304976" wikidata="Q7893142" url="?curid=1304976" title="2004 United States presidential election in Wisconsin">
<text>The 2004 United States presidential election in Wisconsin took place on November 2, 2004, and was part of the 2004 United States presidential election. Voters chose 10 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.

Wisconsin was won by Democratic nominee John Kerry by a 0.38% margin of victory. Although no Republican carried this state in a presidential election since Ronald Reagan in 1984, early polling showed the race was a toss-up, thus was considered as a possible target for the Republicans. Prior to the election, most news organizations considered this a toss-up, or a crucial swing state, and faced similar political scrutiny to neighboring Michigan, Minnesota, and Iowa. On election day, Kerry barely carried the state over President George W. Bush. The results in Wisconsin were nearly identical to the results from four years earlier, when Al Gore squeaked by Bush, and the 2020 presidential election when Joe Biden had a similarly narrow victory in Wisconsin against Donald Trump.

As of 2024, this is the most recent election to date in which Wisconsin would vote for the losing candidate, thus the state is tied with Michigan and Pennsylvania for the longest bellwether streak in the nation. This was also only the third time since 1960 (after 2000 and 1988) that it would vote for the losing candidate. Bush is to date the only presidential candidate to win two terms in office without carrying Wisconsin at least once, as well as the most recent Republican to win without the state.

==Primaries==
* 2004 Wisconsin Democratic presidential primary
* 2004 Wisconsin Republican presidential primary

==Campaign==
===Predictions===
There were 12 news organizations that made state-by-state predictions of the election. Here are their last predictions before election day.

===Polling===
Pre-election polling had Bush and Kerry winning polls, with neither candidate grasping a strong lead. The last 3 poll averages showed Bush leading 49% to 46%.

===Fundraising===
Bush raised $1,993,040. Kerry raised $1,130,602.

===Advertising and visits===
Bush visited the state 12 times. Kerry visited the state 14 times. A total of between $1.3 million to $3.6 million was spent each week.

==Analysis==
Wisconsin has voted for the Democratic presidential nominee in the last four elections before the fifth time in 2004. The urban centers of Milwaukee and Madison tend to vote strongly Democratic. The suburbs of those cities are politically diverse but tend to vote Republican. Counties in the western part of the state tend to be liberal, a tradition passed down from Scandinavian immigrants. The rural areas in the northern and eastern part of the state are the most solidly Republican areas in Wisconsin.

The CNN exit polls showed a dead heat between the two. However, the deciding factor for Kerry&#x27;s victory was union members who voted for him with 62%, while non-members (83% of the population) voted for Bush with just 52% of the vote.

==Results==
===By county===


====Counties that flipped from Republican to Democratic====
*Iron (Largest city: Hurley)
*Price (Largest city: Park Falls)

====Counties that flipped from Democratic to Republican====
*Columbia (Largest city: Portage)

===By congressional district===
Bush and Kerry each won four of eight congressional districts.
==Electors==
Technically the voters of Wisconsin cast their ballots for electors: representatives to the Electoral College. Wisconsin is allocated 10 electors because it has 8 congressional districts and 2 senators. All candidates who appear on the ballot or qualify to receive write-in votes must submit a list of 10 electors, who pledge to vote for their candidate and his or her running mate. Whoever wins the majority of votes in the state is awarded all 10 electoral votes. Their chosen electors then vote for president and vice president. Although electors are pledged to their candidate and running mate, they are not obligated to vote for them. An elector who votes for someone other than his or her candidate is known as a faithless elector.

The electors of each state and the District of Columbia met on December 13, 2004, to cast their votes for president and vice president. The Electoral College itself never meets as one body. Instead the electors from each state and the District of Columbia met in their respective capitols.

The following were the members of the Electoral College from the state. All 10 were pledged for Kerry/Edwards.

# Martha Toran

# Jan Banicki
# Daniel Hannula
# Steve Mellenthin
# Glenn Carlson
# Linda Honold
