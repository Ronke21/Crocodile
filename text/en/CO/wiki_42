<text>Shifnal () is a market town and civil parish in Shropshire, England, about east of Telford, 17 miles (27 km) east of Shrewsbury and 13 miles (20 km) west-northwest of Wolverhampton. It is near the M54 motorway and A5 road aka Watling Street. At the 2001 census, it had a population of 6,391, increasing to 6,776 at the 2011 census.

==Etymology==
Shifnal is thought to be the place named &quot;Scuffanhalch&quot; in a 9th-century charter, as a possession of the monastery at Medeshamstede (later Peterborough Abbey). Though this seems a dubious claim, and the ancient charter is in fact a 12th-century forgery, the full picture is more complex. Sir Frank Stenton considered that &quot;Scuffanhalch&quot;, along with &quot;Costesford&quot; (Cosford) and &quot;Stretford&quot;, formed part of a list of places which had once been connected with Medeshamstede; and the charter purports to have been issued by King Æthelred of Mercia, during much of whose reign the bishop of Mercia was Sexwulf (or &quot;Saxwulf&quot;), founder and first abbot of Medeshamstede.

The first part of the name &quot;Shifnal&quot; is reckoned to be a personal name, &quot;Scuffa&quot;, while the second part, from &quot;halh&quot;, means a valley, thus describing the town&#x27;s topography.

Unusually, the name of the town has alternated through the centuries between Idsall and Shifnal. Idsall (said to be relating to potential Roman links) is mentioned in a 9th-century charter as &quot;Iddeshale&quot;, meaning &quot;Idi&#x27;s nook&quot; or corner. A nook is said to be an area of land of approximately . It is often conjectured that the two names of Idsall and Shifnal were names of settlements on the east and west sides respectively of Wesley Brook, a brook which runs through the town, and is a tributary of the River Worfe. In the 19th century, J. C. Anderson, in his &quot;Shropshire its Early History and Antiquities&quot;, wrote that Idsall means &quot;Hall of Ide&quot;, and that Shifnal is &quot;Hall of Sceafa&quot;.

&quot;A Key to English Place-names&quot; has an entry for Shifnal that reads &#x27;*Scuffa&#x27;s nook of land&#x27;. It was also known as Iddeshale, &#x27;*Idi&#x27;s nook of land&#x27;.

==History==
===Pre-Norman===
The town most probably began as an Anglian settlement, established by the end of the 7th century.
The oldest part of the town is said to be the area around St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Church Street and Innage Road where excavations have turned up evidence of ancient buildings.

===Norman===
The village, as it would have been in 1086, is recorded in the Domesday Book within the hundred of Alnodestreu. The initial part of the entry states:

Robert, son of Theobald, holds of Earl Roger Iteshale. Earl Morcar held it.&quot;

This entry records that possession was lost by the Saxon Earl Morcar when he rebelled against the Norman conquerors.

The church of St Andrew has a Norman chancel and was almost certainly built on the site of an earlier church. It was a collegiate church or minster with a chapter of priests ministering to the needs of congregations in outlying settlements. St Andrew&#x27;s lost its collegiate status when it was given to Shrewsbury Abbey c. 1087.

===Plantagenet period===
In 1245 Walter de Dunstanville, the Crusader and lord of the manor, applied to King Henry III for, and was granted, a market charter for the town. Walter then laid out a broad market street that is Broadway, Bradford Street, Market Place and Park Street for the markets. This area to the east of the stream was known as Shifnal and gradually this name superseded Idsall as the town&#x27;s name.

Just outside of Shifnal are the Caynton Caves, a system carved into the sandstone. Local legend has them made by followers of the Knights Templar 700 years ago, although Historic England – the government body responsible for historic monuments – believes the caves were probably excavated in the late 18th or early 19th Century.

===Tudor and Stuart times===
Shifnal had something of an early industrial revolution during the late 16th century with the construction of a charcoal fired blast furnace near to the Manor House.

A fire swept through the town on 7 July 1591, setting alight the roof of the church. The fire is thought to have been started by a maidservant&#x27;s candle that accidentally set fire to some hanging flax. The fire devastated many, if not all, of the buildings east of the Wesley Brook. The church, although damaged with its bells melted and reportedly reduced to its standing walls, and the timber-framed Old Idsall House at its foot to the east (a listed building), are said to be the only two buildings to have survived the fire that destroyed the rest of the settlement. This is now commemorated by a blue plaque fixed to the wall of the house. After the fire, Elizabeth I sent money to help rebuild the town.

A wall memorial tablet inside St Andrew&#x27;s Church is for Mary Yates – known locally as Nanny Murphy – who walked to London as a teenager just after the Great Fire in 1666, married her third husband Joseph Yates when she was 92, and died at the age of 127. There is a Nanny Murphy&#x27;s Lane just to the north of Shifnal. The same stone memorial tablet records that William Wakely was baptised on 1 May 1590 and was buried on 28 November 1714, after living through the reigns of eight kings and queens.

The best example of Shropshire Scroll, a 16th-century style of swirling wall painting unique to the county, was uncovered in 2010 by renovators in a Grade II listed property on Broadway. The 2 m by 2.5 m work, on display at what is now the Black Orchid hair salon, had been hidden behind a wall for more than a century.

===18th and 19th centuries===
Aston Hall, built about 1720 at the east side of the town, was home to tobacco plantation and slave owners, George Austin and John Moultrie, the latter rising to be acting governor of East Florida. Austin was born in the town in 1710, the son of a mercer and went to South Carolina where he became involved in developing tobacco plantations, one of which he named Shifnal, 1,415 acres next to the Ashepoo river and which had 85 slaves. Austin became one of the wealthiest men in the colonies, but following disputes with his business partner, Henry Laurens, returned to England in 1762 and settled at Aston Hall. Austin was also responsible for the first person of colour recorded as living in Shifnal. In 1766 Benjamin Priouleu &quot;a black servant to Mr Austin&quot; was baptised in the town. 19 years later the parish records note that Lucy Bartlet &quot;a black woman&quot; was buried there. In 1771, Moultrie became Lieutenant-Governor of Florida and encouraged a road-building programme. He became acting governor when his predecessor, James Grant, was invalided home in 1771 and held the position until 1774. Three of his brothers were key players on opposing sides of the American War of Independence.

Thomas Beddoes, a well-known physician, was born in 1760 at Balcony House, named for a room projecting above the roof line, on the east side of Market Place. This building later became the Star Hotel.

A Baptist church was established in Aston Street at the end of the 18th century, but it closed down before the 20th century.

Thomas Telford upgraded Watling Street, the turnpike road that passed through the town, in the late 18th century. This road carried traffic from London to Shrewsbury, Chester and Holyhead for Ireland, bringing considerable prosperity to the town.

There had been a regular stagecoach service through the town from 1681, but when mail coaches began to pass through from 1785 transport became important in the local economy, rising to 18 coaches a day by 1829. Passengers could rest from their travels at three coaching inns: the Jerningham Arms, the Star Hotel and the Unicorn. At the beginning of the 19th century, the Holyhead mail coach could travel from London to Shifnal in 27 hours: by 1831 that had been reduced that to 16.5 hours, using 150 horses along the route. However traffic was already declining by 1844, when there were only nine coaches a day. When the railways reached the town in 1849 the remaining trade rapidly disappeared.

During this period of prosperity many new houses were built, lending Shifnal a Georgian air. The name Idsall was still used to distinguish the area around the St Andrew&#x27;s Church and the Manor from the market and commercial area of Shifnal.

There are records of a parish workhouse in operation in Shifnal in 1777 with accommodation for up to 40 inmates. A new parish workhouse was built on Park Street in 1817. It was adopted as the workhouse for the Shifnal Poor Law Union and was enlarged in 1840–1 at about £800. The number of inmates was never more than 100. The buildings later became part of Shifnal Hospital before being turned into homes.

In 1855 a house on Broadway, used by the town&#x27;s 200-odd Catholics for mass, was burnt down during an anti-Irish riot. Lord Stafford replaced it in 1860 with a combination school and church he built on land he donated at the corner of Victoria Road and Shrewsbury Road. The school closed about 1917, but the building has continued as a church. The present presbytery on Victoria Road, the original school-master&#x27;s house, still has Lord Stafford&#x27;s coat of arms above the door.

The railway line from London and Birmingham to Holyhead was constructed through Shifnal at high level in the late 1840s. The massive viaduct for the railway divided the town: its construction was a considerable engineering achievement, crossing the marshy valley of the Wesley Brook on foundations laid on coarse twigs and vast numbers of sheep fleeces. The original cast iron arched bridge was replaced in 1953 by a more functional but less attractive steel one. The opening of the line on 12 November 1849 brought an abrupt end to the already declining coaching traffic. The viaducts constructed were cast by Horseley Ironworks.

===The Shifnal Bank Fraud===

One of the biggest bank frauds in Victorian Britain took place in Shifnal when a director and staff stole almost £244,000, worth the equivalent of £16 million today. Alongside the &#x27;insider jobs&#x27; were allegations of blackmail, cover-ups and fraudsters being helped to escape.

The Shropshire Banking Company was formed in 1836 from four local banks: in Newport, Wellington, Coalbrookdale and Shifnal. Shifnal became its head office and Abraham Darby IV, of the historic iron master dynasty, was among its first chairmen.

Initially the bank seemed to do well, paying local investors dividends of 12.5 per cent a year, and was successful enough to need new premises in Park Street, Shifnal, with heavy security measures but, in 1856, the bank was forced to write off £193,834 to cover losses through fraud. It emerged that one of the directors, John Horton, had taken an unauthorised overdraft of £10,000 &quot;against worthless security&quot;. Horton, who was being paid £300 a year as a director, was forced to resign. However his fraud was dwarfed by the £234,000 siphoned off by the bank&#x27;s manager, Allen, and his cashier Gilbert over a decade.

Although the police arrived to arrest Allen in Shifnal he managed to slip away while they were on the premises, one version has him vaulting over the counter to escape, reportedly after being tipped off by the bank&#x27;s directors.

Gilbert gave information about his part of the fraud on the understanding that, if he paid back what he had stolen, he would not be prosecuted. Although he returned £53,000 in cash and £87,000 worth of securities, this was still £25,000 short of what he had taken.

Allen meanwhile had taken £159,000, and it appears that this was never returned: all the directors found were vague statements about speculation in mining and railway shares.

The incident had the air of a cover-up, with the full story suppressed by the directors: newspaper reporters were barred from a crisis shareholders&#x27; meeting at the Jerningham Arms opposite; a barrister was brought in to represent the directors and &quot;skilfully parry&quot; questions from angry shareholders, who were prevented from reading out statements &quot;for some insufficient reason&quot;.

Allen was never prosecuted: a report in &quot;The Shrewsbury Chronicle&quot; says Allen &quot;told directors he would expose them and break up the company. It would seem from the fact of him having left the neighbourhood upon the hint being given to him by some of the directors, that they are afraid of his threat&quot;.

When shareholders demanded to know why Allen had been allowed to escape the directors said &quot;it was on best advice&quot; and refused to reveal more on &quot;the ground of the impolicy of telling all they knew of the past&quot;.

To cover the losses the bank&#x27;s directors lent it £120,000: £100,000 from Henry Dickenson, who took over as chairman, and £5,000 each from four others: they never asked for their loans to be repaid, and their cash injection was used as a foundation to raise more money from shareholders.

The Shropshire Banking Company recovered quickly under Dickenson; six months later the directors were given a unanimous vote of thanks by shareholders and it grew steadily over the next few years, finally being bought by Lloyds Bank in 1874.

===The 20th and 21st centuries===
Hinckesman&#x27;s Brewery Company was established at Hinnington spring, just south of the town, in 1897, and changed its name to the Shifnal Brewery Company in 1899. After closing in 1910 the name was revived in 1927 before being acquired by Broadway Brewery (Shifnal) in 1934. In turn this was acquired by Banks&#x27;s of Wolverhampton in 1960.

The Star Hotel was demolished after a fire in 1911.

The Eight Bells or Ring of Bells was occupied in 1911 by the Pitchford family, descendants of the nobility who took their name from the area of Pitchford in Shropshire. Herbert James Pitchford ran the Eight Bells among other public houses. He served in the Welsh Regiment, and died in Flanders in the First World War. His name appears on the Menin Gate in Belgium and on the war memorial in St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Shifnal, near the Eight Bells public house. Today the building is occupied by the Oddfellows Wine Bar.

The railway bridge over Market Place was rebuilt in 1953: the open spandrels of the original arch were replaced with a plain lined flat panel construction.

The town expanded further during the 1960s. In 2015 it was revealed that planning permission had been granted for a total of 1,167 homes across the town, meaning its population was expected to grow by 50 per cent by 2020.

The town&#x27;s branch of Barclays Bank was targeted by robbers on 6 May 1991. They drilled into the strongroom and escaped with £50,000. The same bank was subject to armed robberies in March 2013 and March 2017. Its closure was announced a few weeks after the latter, leaving Shifnal without a bank for the first time since 1824.

In 2009 one of the town&#x27;s biggest employers, Wrekin Construction, went into administration with the loss of 420 jobs in Shropshire, Yorkshire, Northamptonshire and Cheshire and more than £45 million to creditors. Among the business&#x27;s assets was the Gem of Tanzania, valued on the business&#x27;s balance sheets at £11 million. However it emerged that the 2 kg uncut stone&#x27;s value had been forged and it was eventually sold for just £8,000.

In late 2018 plans for a second, far larger expansion of Shifnal, were revealed by Shropshire Council. The proposals, which caused considerable local controversy and led to a public meeting, included up to another 1,500 homes, 40 hectares of employment land and a bypass south of the town by 2036. Large areas of farmland would be needed for the development.

==Culture==
&quot;The Reliques of Ancient English Poetry&quot; was based on a manuscript discovered in Shifnal.

The collection of collection of ballads and popular songs, collected by Bishop Thomas Percy and published in 1765, was primarily based on a folio discovered at the Shifnal home of Percy&#x27;s friend Humphrey Pitt. It was on the floor, and Pitt&#x27;s maid had been using the leaves to light fires. Once rescued Percy used 45 of the ballads in the folio for his book of 180, adding others from sources – broadside ballads collected by diarist Samuel Pepys and &quot;Collection of Old Ballads&quot; published in 1723, possibly by Ambrose Philips. Percy was encouraged to publish by his friends Samuel Johnson and the poet William Shenstone, who also found and contributed ballads.

Charles Dickens, whose grandmother was reputedly employed at nearby Tong Castle, visited the town on several occasions and many believe that the buildings in his book, &quot;The Old Curiosity Shop&quot;, were based on those in the town. Shifnal Historical Society report that he was very taken with the architecture of the town, and for that reason, he based &quot;The Old Curiosity Shop&quot; on the Unicorn public house, later known as Naughty Nell&#x27;s.

The diarist Hannah Cullwick (26 May 1833 – 9 July 1909) was born in Shifnal. Cullwick revealed less-known aspects of the relations between Victorian servants and their masters. Working in domestic service, she caught the attention of Arthur Munby, a prominent barrister and philanthropist, who was making a close study of the conditions of working women. To escape poverty, she married him reluctantly and secretly in 1873, and her diaries provide detailed information on the lives of working-class Victorian servant women. She is buried, under her married name, Munby, in St Andrew&#x27;s churchyard.

Mary Arnold, later known as the writer Mrs Humphry Ward, went to boarding school in the town at Rock Terrace. Her schooldays gave background for one of her later novels, &quot;Marcella&quot; (published 1894).

It is widely believed that Shifnal had some inspiration for P. G. Wodehouse&#x27;s fictional town Market Blandings – or rather, the town is mentioned numerous times in the Blandings Castle saga.

In 1968, the Shifnal Carnival was launched, a revival of the Shifnal Club Day – itself deriving from an annual parade by the &#x27;Dove Club&#x27; friendly society. Taking place on the last Saturday of June, a funfair is set up on the main street, as well as the usual procession.

In 2010, after research as part of the town plan, the Shifnal Festival was revived due to residents expressing interest for a festival of arts, culture and entertainment. It ran for three years, spawning groups such as an amateur dramatics company and a children&#x27;s manga society.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC West Midlands and ITV Central. Television signals are received from either the Wrekin or Sutton Coldfield TV transmitters. Local radio stations are BBC Radio Shropshire, Hits Radio Black Country &amp; Shropshire, Greatest Hits Radio Black Country &amp; Shropshire, and Capital North West &amp; Wales. The town is served by the local newspaper, Shropshire Star.

==Transport==
Hourly buses are provided by Banga Bus service 891 Monday to Saturday, providing links to Telford, Cosford and Wolverhampton. Arriva Midlands provide links to Bridgnorth.

The main railway station is on the Wolverhampton–Shrewsbury line with services to Shrewsbury, Telford, Wolverhampton and Birmingham New Street.

A community library run by the council is located on Broadway.

The Shifnal War Memorial club, on Priorslee Road, is used by a variety of organisations and for many social events. It was opened in 1921 with an extensive recreation ground alongside, and completely rebuilt after a disastrous fire in 1982.

The Millennium Sensory Garden lies between St Andrew&#x27;s Church and Innage Road. It contains a memorial erected by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission of 13 soldiers of the First World War and 4 of the Second World War, who are all buried in the churchyard. The garden is voluntarily maintained by a dedicated group of committee members and friends and obtained the Queen&#x27;s Golden Jubilee Award 2003 and Green Pennant Award 2007–08.

Shifnal Police Station, behind the library, was closed in 2013, but re-opened in August 2019 as a community cafe and gardens.

===Sports===
There are several sporting facilities in Shifnal, including the Idsall Sports Centre, which is attached to Idsall School; the school, in the past, receiving a number of prominent football celebrities from the nearby FA School of Excellence at Lilleshall.

* Table tennis 
* Rugby
* Football
* Tennis
* Cricket
* Basketball

Shifnal Town FC currently compete in the , whilst Shifnal United are in the lower Mercian Regional Football League (Premier Division).

Shifnal formerly had a squash club and swimming pool for 35 years, but these have closed, replaced with a housing development.

Shifnal Golf Club was opened in 1913. Initially its course was nine holes on Lodge Hill, to the south of the town, where seven winds are said to meet. The clubhouse was then a room in a private house, Sunnyside.

==Education==
There are several pre-school nursery and day centres in the town, as well as two primary schools: Shifnal Primary School, on Curriers Lane; and St. Andrew&#x27;s Church of England Primary School, on Park Lane. The town has two further schools, Idsall School, in Coppice Green, a comprehensive secondary school; and Young Options College, in Lamledge Lane, an independent specialist secondary school.

<text>The House of Cantacuzino (; ) is a Romanian aristocratic family of Greek origin. The family gave a number of princes to Wallachia and Moldavia, and it claimed descent from a branch of the Byzantine Kantakouzenos family, specifically from Byzantine Emperor John VI Kantakouzenos (reigned 1347–1354). After the Russo-Ottoman War of 1710–11, a lateral branch of the family settled in Russia, receiving the princely (&quot;Knyaz&quot;, as opposed to &quot;Velikij Knyaz&quot;) status. In 1944, Prince Ștefan Cantacuzino settled in Sweden, where his descendants form part of the unintroduced nobility of that country.

==Origin of the family==

Members of the family claim that the genealogical links between the original House of Kantakouzinos and the subsequent House of Cantacuzino have been extensively researched. The family first appears among the Phanariotes in the late 16th century, with Michael &quot;Şeytanoğlu&quot; Kantakouzenos, after a gap of over a century from the Fall of Constantinople. Whether the family is indeed linked to the Byzantine imperial house of Kantakouzenos is disputed, as it was usual among wealthy Greeks of the time to assume Byzantine surnames and claim descent from the famous noble houses of their Byzantine past. The first member of the family to publicly stress his imperial descent on an international level was the adventurer and pretender Radu Cantacuzino (1699–1761), who produced a genealogy linking himself to Emperor John VI Kantakouzenos, though it contained several invented figures. Radu also changed his coat of arms from the earlier arms depicting an eagle holding a cross, to a new rendition with more shields representing various families and regions, a version still in use by the family today.

The eminent Byzantinist Steven Runciman considered the latter-day Kantakouzenoi &quot;perhaps the only family whose claim to be in the direct line from Byzantine Emperors, as authentic&quot;, but according to the historian Donald Nicol, &quot;Patriotic Rumanian historians have indeed labored to show that ... of all the Byzantine imperial families that of the Kantakouzenos is the only one which can truthfully be said to have survived to this day; but the line of succession after the middle of the fifteenth century is, to say the least, uncertain.&quot;

The origin of the Byzantine family can be traced to Smyrna. The Greek scholar Konstantinos Amantos suggested that &quot;Kantakouzenos&quot; derives from , ultimately from the locality of Kouzenas, a name for the southern part of Mount Sipylon near Smyrna. Donald Nicol agrees with this theory, and lists some connections the Kantakouzenoi had with the locale in the 11th and 13th centuries.

==Origin of the Romanian branch==

The Greek Kantakouzenos family had been active in Constantinople and Greece during the Greek War of Independence, but several branches of the original Greek family were created via the migrations and establishment of Kantakouzenos family members to different parts of Europe. Two of those new branches were the Romanian (Wallachian and Moldavian) Cantacuzino branch as well as the Russian branch (which is an offshoot of the Wallachian-Moldavian one, among the Russian branch&#x27;s members Prince Michael who married in 1892 Olga Nikolaievna, daughter of Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia). As a consequence of the Russian Revolution and the Soviet occupation of Romania after World War II, (between 1944 and 1947) the last two branches now mostly live in Western Europe and North America.

According to Jean-Michel Cantacuzène and Mihail Sturdza, the origin of the Cantacuzino family in Romania is traced to Andronikos Kantakouzenos (1553–1601; also known as Andronik), a Greek financier from Constantinople, son of the &quot;Prince of the Greeks&quot; Michael &quot;Şeytanoğlu&quot; Kantakouzenos. Andronikos had among his several sons two who became &quot;boyars&quot; in what today is Romania and founded the yet-surviving new branches of Cantacuzino:
* &quot;boyar&quot; Georgios &#x27;Iordaki&#x27; Kantakouzenos became forefather of the Moldavian branch, which soon branched to Cantacuzino-Deleanu and Cantacuzino-Pasceanu.
* &quot;boyar&quot; Konstantinos &#x27;Kostaki&#x27; Kantakouzenos married an heiress (daughter) of the late reigning prince Radu Șerban, onetime ruler of Wallachia, and they founded the Wallachian branches which soon clashed against the Ghica family over power.

<doc id="1282769" wikidata="Q1626369" url="?curid=1282769" title="Battle of Fort Stevens">
<text>The Battle of Fort Stevens was an American Civil War battle fought July 11–12, 1864, in Washington County, D.C. in present-day Northwest Washington, D.C., during the Valley campaigns of 1864 between forces under Confederate Lieutenant General Jubal Early and Union Major General Alexander McDowell McCook. 

Early&#x27;s attack, less than from the White House, caused consternation in the U.S. government, but reinforcements under Maj. Gen. Horatio G. Wright and the strong defenses of Fort Stevens minimized the threat. Early withdrew after two days of skirmishing after attempting no serious assaults. Then U.S. President Abraham Lincoln personally observed the battle&#x27;s fighting.

==Background==
In June 1864, Lt. Gen. Jubal Early was dispatched by Gen. Robert E. Lee with the Second Corps of the Army of Northern Virginia from the Confederate lines around the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia, with orders to clear the Shenandoah Valley of Federals and, if practical, to invade Maryland; disrupt the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad; and, if possible, threaten Washington, D.C. The hope was that a movement into Maryland would force Union Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant to send troops to defend Washington against the threat and reduce his strength to take the Confederate capital of Richmond.

After driving off the Army of West Virginia under Maj. Gen. David Hunter after the Battle of Lynchburg on June 18, the Second Corps marched northward through the valley, entering Maryland on July 5 near Sharpsburg. They then turned east towards Frederick, where they arrived on July 7. Two days later, as the Second Corps prepared to march on Washington, Maj. Gen. Lew Wallace, leading a small Union force composed mostly of garrison troops, bolstered by the eleventh-hour addition of two brigades of the VI Corps sent from Richmond under Maj. Gen. James B. Ricketts, attempted to resist the Confederate advance at the Battle of Monocacy.

The July 9 battle lasted from about 6 a.m. to around 4 p.m. Early&#x27;s corps ultimately drove off the Union troops, the only substantial force between it and the capital. Still, the battle cost Early precious time that would have been better spent in advancing the toward Washington City. After the battle, Early resumed his march on the District of Columbia and arrived at its northeast border near Silver Spring around noon on July 11. Because of the battle and then the long march through the stifling summer heat, and unsure of the strength of the Union position in front of him, Early decided not to send his army against the fortifications around Washington until the next day.

Early&#x27;s invasion of Maryland had the desired effect on Grant, who dispatched the rest of the VI Corps and XIX Corps under Maj. Gen. Horatio G. Wright to Washington on July 9. As Lee wrote to James Seddon, the Confederate Secretary of War, on July 19:

The steamships carrying the Union force started to arrive in Southeast Washington around noon on July 11, about the same time that Early reached the outskirts of Fort Stevens with the lead elements of his troops.

=== Defense of Washington ===

The Washington City, D.C., prepared for the Confederate assault amid one of the worst hot spells in its history. It lasted 47 days without rain, with temperatures exceeding . The U.S. Congress and prominent residents left town to escape the heat as much as the impending Confederate advance. However, President Lincoln remained near the city, staying with his family at the Soldier&#x27;s Home in present-day Northwest Washington, although a steamer waited on the Potomac to evacuate them if the situation became dire. Meanwhile, refugees from surrounding counties began to enter the relative safety of the city.

Overall command for defense of the District was given to Major General Christopher C. Augur as commander of the XXII Corps. Major Generals Quincy Gillmore and Alexander McCook commanded the Northeast sector and the reserve post at Blagden Farm, respectively. Augur commanded 31,000 troops and 1,000 artillery pieces in 160 fortifications, batteries, and trenches. Eighty-seven fortifications were north of the Potomac (facing Early&#x27;s approach) with 484 heavy guns and 13,986 men. Land was cleared surrounding the city to create open fields of fire. Six companies of the 8th Illinois Cavalry were stationed in front of the northern defenses.

Despite the impressive array, Washington&#x27;s defenses were unformidable. General John G. Barnard, Grant&#x27;s engineering officer, noted that many of the troops were not actually fit for duty because they were new recruits, untried reserves, recovering from wounds, or worn-out veterans. Bernard estimated that instead of 31,000, the actual number of usable troops was around 9,600. The capital was more vulnerable to Confederate attack than it seemed since with around 10,000 troops, the Confederate army matched the effective Union troop strength.

===Union command structure===

The arrival of the VI Corps, about 10,000 men, brought desperately needed veteran reinforcements. It also added another high-ranking officer into a jumbled Union command. The Washington defenses played host to a number of generals ejected from major theaters of the war or incapacitated for field command by wounds or disease. Maj. Gen. Alexander M. McCook, who had been relieved of command after the 1863 Battle of Chickamauga, was placed in command of the Defenses of the Potomac River &amp; Washington, superseding Christopher Columbus Augur, who commanded the Department of Washington. Augur also commanded the XXII Corps, whose troops manned the capital&#x27;s defensive works. Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck called upon Maj. Gen. Quincy A. Gillmore in New York City to take command of a detachment from the XIX Corps. The Union Army&#x27;s Quartermaster General, Brig. Gen. Montgomery C. Meigs, took command of an &quot;Emergency Division,&quot; composed of federal employees who were armed during the raid, directly under the command of McCook. Even Lincoln personally arrived at the battlefield. McCook tried to sort out the problem of too many high-ranking generals in the face of Early&#x27;s advance. He was unable to rid himself of the generals, and their attempts to gain leverage over one another, but a somewhat-workable command structure was established. With McCook in overall command, Gillmore commanded the northeast line of fortresses (Fort Lincoln to Fort Totten), Meigs commanded the northern line of forts (Fort Totten to Fort DeRussy—including Fort Stevens) and Augur&#x27;s First Division commander, Martin D. Hardin, commanded the northwest line of forts (Fort DeRussy to Fort Sumner). Wright and the VI Corps were initially to be held in reserve but McCook immediately decided against it and stated that he felt veteran troops needed to take the front lines against Early&#x27;s troops.

As it was, Hardin&#x27;s troops engaged in some light skirmishing, but as McCook intended, it was to be Wright&#x27;s veterans who bore the brunt of the fighting.

==Battle==

At about the time Wright&#x27;s command was arriving in Washington, Early&#x27;s corps began to arrive at the breastworks of Fort Stevens, yet Early delayed the attack because he was still unsure of the federal strength defending the fort, much of his army was still in transit to the front, and the troops he had were exhausted due to the excessive heat and the fact that they had been on the march since June 13. Additionally, many of the Confederate troops had looted the home of Montgomery Blair, the son of the founder of Silver Spring, Maryland. They found barrels of whiskey in the basement of the mansion, called Blair Mansion, and many troops were too drunk to get a good start in the morning. This allowed for further fortification by Union troops.

Around 3 p.m., with the bulk of their force present, the Confederates commenced skirmishing, probing the defense maintained by Brig. Gen. Martin D. Hardin&#x27;s division of the XXII Corps with a line of skirmishers backed by artillery. Near the start of the Confederate attack the lead elements of the VI and XIX Corps arrived at the fort, reinforcing it with battle-hardened troops. The battle picked up around 5 p.m. when Confederate cavalry pushed through the advance Union picket line. A Union counterattack drove back the Confederate cavalry and the two opposing lines confronted each other throughout the evening with periods of intense skirmishing. The Union front was aided by artillery from the fort, which shelled Confederate positions, destroying many houses that Confederate sharpshooters used for protection.

President Lincoln, his wife Mary, and some officers rode out to observe the attack, either on July 11 or July 12, and were briefly under enemy fire that wounded a Union surgeon standing next to Lincoln on the Fort Stevens parapet. Lincoln was brusquely ordered to take cover by an officer, possibly Horatio Wright, although other probably apocryphal stories claim that it was Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., Private John A. Bedient of the 150th Ohio Infantry, the fort commander, other privates of the Ohio National Guard, or Elizabeth Thomas.

Additional Union reinforcements from the VI and XIX Corps arrived overnight and were placed in reserve behind the line. The skirmishing continued into July 12, when Early finally decided that Washington could not be taken without heavy losses which would be too severe to warrant the attempt. Union artillery from Fort Stevens attempted to clear out Confederate sharpshooters hidden in the buildings and fields in front of the fort; when the artillery fire failed to drive them off, the VI Corps brigade of Daniel Bidwell, supported by Oliver Edwards&#x27; brigade and two Veteran Reserve Corps regiments, attacked at about 5 p.m. The attack was successful, but at the cost of over 300 men. VI Corps member Elisha Hunt Rhodes recalled:

==Aftermath==
Early&#x27;s force withdrew that evening, headed back into Montgomery County, Maryland, and crossed the Potomac River on July 13 at White&#x27;s Ferry into Leesburg, Virginia. The Confederates successfully brought the supplies they seized during the previous weeks with them into Virginia. Early remarked to one of his officers after the battle, &quot;Major, we didn&#x27;t take Washington but we scared Abe Lincoln like hell.&quot; Wright organized a pursuit force and set out after them during the afternoon of the 13th.

==Battlefield and cemeteries==
Fort Stevens is now maintained by the National Park Service under the administration of the Civil War Defenses of Washington. The fort is located near 13th Street NW between Rittenhouse and Quackenbos Streets NW and is the only part of the battlefield currently preserved; the remainder was developed following 1925. The Battleground National Cemetery was established two weeks after the battle and is located nearby, at 6625 Georgia Avenue NW, containing the graves of 40 Union soldiers killed in the battle; 17 Confederate soldiers are buried on the grounds of Grace Episcopal Church, slightly north of current downtown Silver Spring, Maryland, at the intersection of Georgia Avenue and Grace Church Road.

The Rev. James B. Avirett, the pastor at Grace Church, was instrumental in interring the Confederate soldiers at Grace Episcopal Church.

<doc id="1282785" wikidata="Q686387" url="?curid=1282785" title="Saraburi">
<text>Saraburi City (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) is the provincial capital of Saraburi Province in central Thailand. In 2020, it had a population of 60,809 people, and covers the complete &quot;tambon&quot; Pak Phriao of the Mueang Saraburi district.

== Location ==
Saraburi sits on the banks of the Pa Sak River, around 60 km upstream from the confluence with the Chao Phraya River and around 60 km downstream from the Pasak Chonlasit Dam.

The city is around 100 km northeast of Bangkok, 40 km northeast of Phra Nakhon Sri Ayutthaya, and 50 km west of Khao Yai National Park.

== History ==
Saraburi was founded in 1549 as a base for troop recruitment by King Maha Chakkraphat due to the threat of the growing Burmese Toungoo Dynasty.

In 1624, Wat Phra Phutthabat was built by King Songtham of Ayutthaya on the city.

The royal decree established the Saraburi Municipality on 10 December 1835 with an area of 5 square kilometers.

== Demographics ==
Since 2005, the population of Saraburi has been fluctuating up and down, however, the city&#x27;s population in 2005 is greater than what it is as of 2020.

<doc id="1282794" wikidata="Q2865178" url="?curid=1282794" title="Arthur Jones (inventor)">
<text>Arthur Allen Jones (November 22, 1926 – August 28, 2007) was the founder of Nautilus, Inc. and MedX, Inc. and the inventor of the Nautilus exercise machines, including the Nautilus pullover, which was first sold in 1970. Jones was a pioneer in the field of physical exercise i.e. weight and strength training. He was born in Arkansas, and grew up in Seminole, Oklahoma.

==Accomplishments==
Jones&#x27;s ideas tried to move the public&#x27;s notion of bodybuilding and strength-training exercise away from the Arnold Schwarzenegger school of training, which involved hours in the gym using free weights, to high intensity training. This involves short, single sets, with each set taken to the point of complete muscular failure with a frequency of once or at most twice a week with the intention to maximize muscular hypertrophy and strength increases. Jones said: “The secret, if there is one, is high intensity. And when you actually train with high-intensity, you don’t need a lot of volume.” 

Famous individuals who trained under Jones&#x27;s supervision include Casey Viator (who participated in the Colorado Experiment), Eddie Robinson (who worked with and participated in and trained under Jones&#x27;s Nautilus leverage line), IFBB professional bodybuilders Mike and Ray Mentzer (both won the Mr. America IFBB and AAU respectively), Sergio Oliva (winner of every major bodybuilding contest and was also the only individual to win the Mr. Olympia over Arnold Schwarzenegger who placed 2nd), Boyer Coe (Mr. America, Mr.International, Mr.Universe etc.) and Dorian Yates (6x Mr. Olympia).

Jones&#x27;s publications included the &quot;Nautilus Bulletins&quot;, which dispelled contemporary myths of exercise and resistance training. He also wrote and published &quot;The Cervical Spine, Lumbar Spine And The Knee,&quot; which provided for the first time a complete description of the function of the lumbar spine and its true range of motion.

Additional publications included the results of Jones&#x27;s studies on the differing responses of muscular structures exposed to varying amounts of exercise throughout limited and unlimited range of motion. Jones labeled these responses as type S response for specific and type G for general. He was among the first researchers to experiment with exclusively eccentric training on test subjects and among the first to suggest the superiority and importance of eccentric training for strength. He was the inventor of infimetric and akinetic exercise equipment. He was the first exercise machine designer to utilize cams, as opposed to pulleys, in exercise machines, making possible for the first time resistance that varied along the force curves generated by human muscular structures.

It was the advent of Nautilus machines that made resistance training appealing to the general public, fueling the fitness boom of the 1970s and 80s and resulting in Nautilus gyms in strip malls across America.

Nautilus, Inc. markets the Bowflex, Stairmaster and Nautilus product lines. These new product lines are not affiliated with Jones. The Bowflex &quot;power rod&quot; bending technology is in part based on Jones&#x27;s ideas due to its use of variable resistance.

The Nautilus machines and the company he formed to sell them made Jones a multimillionaire and landed him on the &quot;Forbes&quot; list of the 400 richest people. At one point, financial analysts estimated that Nautilus was grossing $400 million annually. He sold Nautilus Inc. in 1986 for $23 million. He also sold MedX Corporation in 1996 and then retired.

==Death==
On August 28, 2007, Jones died from natural causes at his home in Ocala, Florida, at age 80. He was survived by two daughters and two sons.

== Inventions ==
Arthur Jones was a prolific inventor, holding numerous patents (many of which were assigned to Nautilus or MedX), most notably the elliptical cam (which replaces the pulley) to provide variable resistance through the range of motion.

==Other interests==
Jones often prided himself on being a generalist, something which he describes as a move away from the stubbornness and short-sightedness of &#x27;specialists&#x27;. He attributed this in part to his upbringing in a family of physicians, as he found their attitudes toward medicine revolved around what they were taught and nothing else. One of his favorite quotes was Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;specialization is for insects.&quot; He often cited that his observations gained from flying allowed him to understand the requirements for developing exercise machines. He believed in the competent man, that, as Heinlein also said, &quot;a man should be able to put food on the table, build a house, tan a hide and deliver a baby.&quot;

Jones traveled and &#x27;adventured&#x27; widely, occasionally with friend and fellow adventurer Roy Pinney (Jones&#x27;s cameraman for a syndicated TV series called &quot;Wild Cargo&quot;), setting up camp for two years or so at a time in different places such as Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and Mexico City. His motto was &quot;younger women, faster airplanes, and bigger crocodiles.&quot; Jones&#x27;s Lake Helen, Florida, Nautilus building was the home of Gomek, an 18-foot salt water crocodile that Jones was trying to grow to world record size. He was also an aficionado of venomous spiders and reptiles, a large collection of which was also housed in the Nautilus building. He ran a business that involved the importation of a variety of wild animals, ranging from tropical fish to snakes, parrots and monkeys. Jones&#x27;s household included a jaguar named &quot;Gaylord&quot; that had free run of the house and even slept on the bed with his daughter. He once retrofitted several of his jumbo jets in order to transport 63 baby elephants, that had been orphaned in Africa, to his Jumbo Lair compound in Florida. Jones filmed the entire operation for television and entitled it &quot;Operation Elephant&quot;.

Jones was the creator of the &quot;Jumbolair&quot; estate, originally created as a haven of 350 acres (1.4 km2) for orphaned African elephants and other wildlife. He also kept two rhinos and a 600 lb male silverback gorilla that he named Mickey on the Jumbo Lair compound.

After WWII, he developed and owned a zoo in Slidell, Louisiana where he provided animals for the 1956 Roger Corman movie &quot;Swamp Women&quot;.

He also founded MedX Corporation, in which he invested 120 million dollars, to develop medical-based exercise and testing equipment for the cervical spine, lumbar spine and the knee.

In 1962, he wrote, produced, and directed the movie &quot;Voodoo Swamp&quot;.

<doc id="1282819" wikidata="Q1064180" url="?curid=1282819" title="Hillingdon">
<text>Hillingdon is an area of Uxbridge within the London Borough of Hillingdon, centred 14.2 miles (22.8 km) west of Charing Cross. It was an ancient parish in Middlesex that included the market town of Uxbridge. During the 1920s the civil parish bore a rapid, planned increase in population and housing, and was absorbed by Uxbridge Urban District in 1929. It has formed part of Greater London since 1965.

Much of Hillingdon has lasting, albeit minor, administrative effect as the current Hillingdon East ward for electing councillors to Hillingdon London Borough Council. In November 2010, the ward had a recorded population of 12,403.

==History==

===Toponymy===
The name &quot;Hillingdon&quot; appears in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; (1086) as &quot;Hillendone&quot;, possibly meaning &quot;hill of a man named Hille&quot;. The name could also mean &#x27;hill of a woman named Hilda&#x27;.

===Local government===
Hillingdon was an ancient parish, and had within it the chapelry of Uxbridge, which became a separate civil parish in 1866. When a local board of health was created for Uxbridge, the western part of Hillingdon parish was included within it. Under the Local Government Act 1894, Hillingdon parish was divided in two along the boundary of the board of health district. Hillingdon West became, with Uxbridge, part of the Uxbridge Urban District. Hillingdon East, now governed by the Hillingdon East Parish Council, became part of the Uxbridge Rural District. Uxbridge Rural District and the parish council were abolished in 1928, with the Hillingdon East parish being added to the Uxbridge Urban District. Both Hillingdon East and Hillingdon West parishes were abolished in 1938 and added to Uxbridge parish. In 1965, under the London Government Act 1963, Hillingdon became the name of the westernmost borough of Greater London.

===Urban development===
The A40 (Western Avenue) was rerouted in the early 1990s to run slightly north of its original route, thereby allowing traffic to flow without interruption at the junction of Hillingdon Circus. Hillingdon tube station was required to be demolished in order for the new road to be constructed, and a new station was opened further south along the line in 1994, winning the Underground Station of the Year award for that year.

==Parliamentary constituency==
Hillingdon is a traditional Conservative stronghold lying within the Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency, represented from 2015 until 2023 by Boris Johnson. Before that, John Randall MP had represented the constituency since 1997, following the death of fellow Conservative Sir Michael Shersby.

==Education==
Primary schools in Hillingdon include Oak Farm Juniors, St Bernadette&#x27;s Roman Catholic Primary School, St Helen&#x27;s College, Hillingdon Primary and Ryefield Primary.

Secondary schools, ACS Hillingdon, Bishopshalt School, Oak Wood School, Vyners School and Swakeleys School for Girls.

Moorcroft School in Colham Green is a special school, run by the Eden Academy Trust. It was formerly located at Moorcroft Park on Harlington Road, the old Moorcroft House hospital site.

==Transport==
Hillingdon tube station is served by the Metropolitan and Piccadilly lines of the London Underground.

West Ruislip tube station is served by the Central line of the London Underground.
The Oxford Tube and Oxford X90 services between Oxford and central London also serve Hillingdon.

Bus route U2 serves Hillingdon, operating between Uxbridge station and Brunel University.

===Church of St John the Baptist===

The church of St John the Baptist stands at the top of Hillingdon Hill, at its junction with Royal Lane. It was built in 1629, replacing an earlier building deemed to have become unsafe. In 1846, the architect George Gilbert Scott (father of George Gilbert Scott Junior) was asked to design an extension, as the increasing population meant the church was becoming too cramped. This extension was completed between 1847 and 1848 by the Fassnidge builders from Uxbridge.

On 8 November 1940, a bomb fell on the south side of the church, damaging many of the windows on the south and east sides of the church. The windows were repaired after the war. The barrel roof of the chancel was renovated in 1953 to commemorate the coronation of Elizabeth II. In 1964, a vestry was built on the north-eastern side of the church. There is a notable brass on the north wall of the south aisle dedicated to John, 8th Baron Strange of Knokin and his wife Jacquetta (1509). The nearest station to the church is Uxbridge which is at the distance of 1.73 km.

===Hillingdon Court===

Hillingdon Court was built in 1858 by Sir Charles Mills as his family home, after he had bought separate adjacent properties in Vine Lane. Both buildings were demolished and the plots combined to allow the construction of the new property. The mansion remained in the family&#x27;s ownership until Charles Mills, 2nd Baron Hillingdon died in 1919. Part of the estate was bought by the local authority, while the mansion was bought by the Roman Catholic Order of the Sacred Heart and became a nursing home in 1920. After the Second World War, the mansion became a girls&#x27; school, and in 1978 it was bought by ACS International Schools to become ACS Hillingdon. Under the ownership of ACS International Schools, the mansion has been extended and converted in parts to meet the needs of a school. The area of land bought by the local authority remains today as Hillingdon Court Park.

<text>Maha Sarakham is the capital city of Maha Sarakham province in Thailand&#x27;s northeastern (Isan) region. Sarakham, as it is known to its inhabitants, is in a rice-growing area on the southern Khorat plain, straddling the Chi River. Mahasarakham is 475 km northeast of Bangkok and 73 km southeast of Khon Kaen.

The city has long been known as a regional education centre, the so-called &quot;Taxila of Isan&quot; (taking this name from the ancient Hindu centre of learning). It is home to six colleges, as well as Mahasarakham University (MSU) and Maha Sarakham Rajabhat University. Sarakham has the feel of a student town with the younger, more cosmopolitan population much in evidence in the downtown campus area and near MSU&#x27;s second campus seven kilometres away at Kham Riang.

For a time Mahasarakham ranked with Sisaket as among the poorest cities in Isan. This is changing, partly under the influence of the rapidly growing student population. Today Maha Sarakham possesses two cinemas, a modern department store and market, and branches of major retailers. There has been extensive building, especially on the eastern fringes of the city.

Maha Sarakham has no railway station or airport, and the main transport links are via express bus, or by road connections to the airports in Khon Kaen and Roi Et. Recently the road link south was upgraded and is now mainly dual carriageway highway.

<doc id="1282836" wikidata="Q310434" url="?curid=1282836" title="Gigantopithecus">
<text>Gigantopithecus ( ; ) is an extinct genus of ape that lived in southern China from 2 million to approximately 300,000 to 200,000 years ago during the Early to Middle Pleistocene, represented by one species, Gigantopithecus blacki. Potential identifications have also been made in Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia. The first remains of &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot;, two third molar teeth, were identified in a drugstore by anthropologist Ralph von Koenigswald in 1935, who subsequently described the ape. In 1956, the first mandible and more than 1,000 teeth were found in Liucheng, and numerous more remains have since been found in at least 16 sites. Only teeth and four mandibles are known currently, and other skeletal elements were likely consumed by porcupines before they could fossilise. &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; was once argued to be a hominin, a member of the human line, but it is now thought to be closely allied with orangutans, classified in the subfamily Ponginae.

&quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; has traditionally been restored as a massive, gorilla-like ape, potentially when alive, but the paucity of remains make total size estimates highly speculative. The species may have been sexually dimorphic, with males much bigger than females. The incisors are reduced and the canines appear to have functioned like cheek teeth (premolars and molars). The premolars are high-crowned, and the fourth premolar is very molar-like. The molars are the largest of any known ape, and have a relatively flat surface. &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; had the thickest enamel by absolute measure of any ape, up to in some areas, though this is only fairly thick when tooth size is taken into account.

&quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; appears to have been a generalist herbivore of C3 forest plants, with the jaw adapted to grinding, crushing, and cutting through tough, fibrous plants, and the thick enamel functioning to resist foods with abrasive particles such as stems, roots, and tubers with dirt. Some teeth bear traces of fig family fruits, which may have been important dietary components. It primarily lived in subtropical to tropical forest, and went extinct about 300,000 years ago likely because of the retreat of preferred habitat due to climate change, and potentially archaic human activity. &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; has become popular in cryptozoology circles as the identity of the Tibetan yeti or the American bigfoot, apelike creatures in local folklore.

==Discovery==
===Research history===

&quot;Gigantopithecus blacki&quot; was named by anthropologist Ralph von Koenigswald in 1935 based on two third lower molar teeth, which, he noted, were of enormous size (the first was &quot;&quot;Ein gewaltig grosser (...) Molar&quot;, the second was described as &quot;der enorme Grösse besitzt&quot;&quot;), measuring . The specific name &quot;blacki&quot; is in honour of Canadian palaeoanthropologist Davidson Black, who had studied human evolution in China and had died the previous year. Von Koenigswald, working for the Dutch East Indies Mineralogical Survey on Java, had found the teeth in a drugstore in Hong Kong where they were being sold as &quot;dragon bones&quot; to be used in traditional Chinese medicine. By 1939, after purchasing more teeth, he determined they had originated somewhere in Guangdong or Guangxi. He could not formally describe the type specimen until 1952 due to his internment by Japanese forces during World War II. The originally discovered teeth are part of the collection of the University of Utrecht.

In 1955, a survey team that was led by Chinese palaeontologist Pei Wenzhong was tasked by the Chinese Institute of Vertebrate Palaeontology and Palaeoanthropology (IVPP) with finding the original &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; locality. They collected 47 teeth among shipments of &quot;dragon bones&quot; in Guangdong and Guangxi. In 1956, the team discovered the first &quot;in situ&quot; remains, a third molar and premolar, in a cave (subsequently named &quot;&quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; Cave&quot;) in Niusui Mountain, Guangxi. Also in 1956, Liucheng farmer Xiuhuai Qin discovered more teeth and the first mandible on his field. From 1957 to 1963, the IVPP survey team carried out excavations in this area and recovered two more mandibles and more than 1,000 teeth. In 2014, a fourth confirmed mandible was discovered in Yanliang, Central China. Indicated by extensive rodent gnawing marks, teeth primarily accumulated in caves likely due to porcupine activity. Porcupines gnaw on bones to obtain nutrients necessary for quill growth, and can haul large bones into their underground dens and consume them entirely, except the hard, enamel-capped crowns of teeth. This may explain why teeth are typically found in great quantity, and why remains other than teeth are so rare.

Confirmed &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; remains have since been found in 16 different sites across southern China. The northernmost sites are and Longgu Cave, just south of the Yangtze River, and southernmost on Hainan Island in the South China Sea. An isolated canine from Thẩm Khuyên Cave, Vietnam, and a fourth premolar from Pha Bong, Thailand, could possibly be assigned to &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot;, though these could also represent the extinct orangutan &quot;Pongo weidenreichi&quot;. Two mandibular fragments each preserving the last two molars from in Central Java, Indonesia, described in 2016 could represent &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot;. The oldest remains date to 2.2 million years ago from Baikong Cave, and the youngest to 295 to 215 thousand years ago from Shuangtan and Gongjishan Caves.

===Classification===
====&quot;G. blacki&quot;====

In 1935, von Koenigswald considered &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; to be closely allied with the Late Miocene &quot;Sivapithecus&quot; from India. In 1939, South African palaeontologist Robert Broom hypothesised that it was closely allied with &quot;Australopithecus&quot; and the last common ancestor of humans and other apes. In 1946, Jewish German anthropologist Franz Weidenreich described &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; as a human ancestor as &quot;&quot;Gigantanthropus&quot;, believing that the human lineage went through a gigantic phase. He stated that the teeth are more similar to those of modern humans and &quot;Homo erectus&quot; (at the time &quot;Pithecanthropus&quot; for early Javan specimens), and envisioned a lineage from &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot;, to the Javan ape &quot;Meganthropus&quot; (then considered a human ancestor), to &quot;Pithecanthropus&quot;, to &quot;Javanthropus&quot;&quot;, and finally Aboriginal Australians. This was part of his multiregional hypothesis, that all modern races and ethnicities evolved independently from a local archaic human species, rather than sharing a more recent and fully modern common ancestor. In 1952, von Koenigswald agreed that &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; was a hominin, but believed it was an offshoot rather than a human ancestor. Much debate followed whether &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; was a hominin or not for the next three decades until the Out of Africa hypothesis overturned the and multiregional hypotheses, firmly placing humanity&#x27;s origins in Africa.

&quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; is now classified in the subfamily Ponginae, closely allied with &quot;Sivapithecus&quot; and &quot;Indopithecus&quot;. This would make its closest living relatives the orangutans. However, there are few similar traits (synapomorphies) linking &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; and orangutans due to fragmentary remains, with the main morphological argument being its close affinities to &quot;Sivapithecus&quot;, which is better established as a pongine based on skull features. In 2017, Chinese palaeoanthropologist Yingqi Zhang and American anthropologist Terry Harrison suggested that &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; is most closely allied to the Chinese &quot;Lufengpithecus&quot;, which went extinct 4 million years prior to &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot;.

In 2019, peptide sequencing of dentine and enamel proteins of a &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; molar from Chuifeng Cave indicates that &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; was indeed closely allied with orangutans, and, assuming the current mutation rate in orangutans has remained constant, shared a common ancestor about 12–10 million years ago in the Middle to Late Miocene. Their last common ancestor would have been a part of the Miocene radiation of apes. The same study calculated a divergence time between the Ponginae and African great apes about 26–17.7 million years ago.

Cladogram according to Zhang and Harrison, 2017:

====&quot;&quot;G. bilaspurensis&quot;====
In 1969, an 8.6 million year old mandible from the Sivalik Hills in northern India was classified as &quot;G. bilaspurensis&quot; by palaeontologists Elwyn L. Simons and , who believed it was the ancestor of &quot;G. blacki&quot;. This bore resemblance to a molar discovered in 1915 in the Pakistani Pothohar Plateau then classified as &quot;Dryopithecus giganteus&quot;. Von Koenigswald reclassified &quot;D. giganteus&quot; in 1950 into its own genus, &quot;Indopithecus&quot;, but this was changed again in 1979 to &quot;G. giganteus&quot;&quot; by American anthropologists Frederick Szalay and Eric Delson until &quot;Indopithecus&quot; was resurrected in 2003 by Australian anthropologist . &quot;G. bilaspurensis&quot; is now considered a synonym of &quot;Indopithecus giganteus&quot;, leaving &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; monotypic (with only one species), &quot;G. blacki&quot;.

==Description==
===Size===
Total size estimates are highly speculative because only tooth and jaw elements are known, and molar size and total body weight do not always correlate, such as in the case of postcanine megadontia hominins (small-bodied primate exhibiting massive molars and thick enamel). In 1946, Weidenreich hypothesised that &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; was twice the size of male gorillas. In 1957, Pei estimated a total height of about . In 1970, Simons and American palaeontologist Peter Ettel approximated a height of almost and a weight of up to , which is about 40% heavier than the average male gorilla. In 1979, American anthropologist Alfred E. Johnson Jr. used the dimensions of gorillas to estimate a femur length of and humerus length of for &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot;, about 20–25% longer than those of gorillas. In 2017, Chinese palaeoanthropologist Yingqi Zhang and American anthropologist Terry Harrison suggested a body mass of , though conceded that it is impossible to obtain a reliable body mass estimate without more complete remains. This size would make &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; the biggest primate ever recorded.

The average maximum length of the upper canines for presumed males and females are and , respectively, and Mandible III (presumed male) is 40% larger than Mandible I (presumed female). These imply sexual dimorphism, with males being larger than females. Such a high degree of dimorphism is only surpassed by gorillas among modern apes in canine size, and is surpassed by none for mandibular disparity.

===Teeth and jaws===
Like other apes, &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; had a dental formula of , with two incisors, one canine, two premolars, and three molars in each half of the jaw for both jaws. The canines, due to a lack of honing facets (which keep them sharp) and their overall stoutness, have been suggested to have functioned like premolars and molars (cheek teeth). Like other apes with enlarged molars, the incisors of &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; are reduced. Wearing on the tongue-side of the incisors (the lingual face), which can extend as far down as the tooth root, suggests an underbite. Overall mandibular anatomy and tooth wearing suggests a side-to-side movement of the jaw while chewing (lateral excursion). The incisors and canines have extremely long tooth roots, at least double the length of the tooth crown (the visible part of the tooth). These teeth were closely packed together.

In the upper jaw, the first premolar (P3) averages in surface area, the second premolar (P4) , the first and/or second molars (M1/2, which are difficult to distinguish) , and the third molar (M3) . In the lower jaw, P3 averages , P4 , M1/2 , and M3 . The molars are the biggest of any known ape. Teeth continually evolved to become larger and larger. The premolars are high-crowned, and the lower have two tooth roots, whereas the upper have three. The lower molars are low-crowned, long and narrow, and waist at the midline—which is more pronounced in the lower molars—with low-lying and bulbous cusps and rounded-off crests.
The tooth enamel on the molars is in absolute measure the thickest of any known ape, averaging in three different molars, and over on the tongue-side (lingual) cusps of an upper molar. This has attracted comparisons with the extinct &quot;Paranthropus&quot; hominins, which had extremely large molars and thick enamel for their size. However, in relation to the tooth&#x27;s size, enamel thickness for &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; overlaps with that of several other living and extinct apes. Like orangutans and potentially all pongines (though unlike African apes) the &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; molar had a large and flat (tabular) grinding surface, with an even enamel coating, and short dentine horns (the areas of the dentine layer which project upwards into the top enamel layer). The molars are the most hypsodont (where the enamel extends beyond the gums) of any ape.

==Palaeobiology==
===Diet===

&quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; is considered to have been a herbivore. Carbon-13 isotope analysis suggests consumption of C3 plants, such as fruits, leaves, and other forest plants. The robust mandible of &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; indicates it was capable of resisting high strains while chewing through tough or hard foods. However, the same mandibular anatomy is typically seen in modern apes which primarily eat soft leaves (folivores) or seeds (granivores). &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; teeth have a markedly lower rate of pitting (caused by eating small, hard objects) than orangutans, more similar to the rate seen in chimpanzees, which could indicate a similarly generalist diet.

The molar-like premolars, large molars, and long rooted cheeked teeth could point to chewing, crushing, and grinding of bulky and fibrous materials. Thick enamel would suggest a diet of abrasive items, such as dirt particles on food gathered near or on the ground (like bamboo shoots). Similarly, oxygen isotope analysis suggests &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; consumed more low-lying plants such as stems, roots, and grasses than orangutans. Dental calculus indicates the consumption of tubers. &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; does not appear to have consumed the commonplace savanna grasses (C4 plants). Nonetheless, in 1990, a few opal phytoliths adhering to four teeth from &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; Cave were identified to have originated from grasses; though, the majority of phytoliths resemble the hairs of fig family fruits, which include figs, mulberry, breadfruit and banyan. This suggests that fruit was a significant dietary component for at least this population of &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot;.

The 400,000–320,000-year-old Middle Pleistocene teeth from Hejiang Cave in southeastern China (near the time of extinction) show some differences from Early Pleistocene material from other sites, which could potentially indicate that the Hejiang &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; were a specialised form adapting to a changing environment with different food resources. The Hejiang teeth display a less level (more crenulated) outer enamel surface due to the presence of secondary crests emanating from the paracone and protocone on the side of the molar closer to the midline (medially), as well as sharper major crests. That is, the teeth are not as flat.

In 1957, based on hoofed animal remains in a cave located in a seemingly inaccessible mountain, Pei had believed that &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; was a cave-dwelling predator and carried these animals in. This hypothesis is no longer considered viable because its dental anatomy is consistent with herbivory. In 1975, American palaeoanthropologist Tim D. White drew similarities between the jaws and dentition of &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; and those of the giant panda, and suggested they both occupied the same niche as bamboo specialists. This garnered support from some subsequent researchers, but thicker enamel and hypsodonty in &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; could suggest different functionality for these teeth.

The species&#x27; reliance on barks and twigs for nutrition led to its demise.

===Growth===
A &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; permanent third molar, based on an approximate 600–800 days required for the enamel on the cusps to form (which is quite long), was estimated to have taken four years to form, which is within the range (albeit, far upper range) of what is exhibited in humans and chimpanzees. Like many other fossil apes, the rate of enamel formation near the enamel-dentine junction (dentine is the nerve-filled layer beneath the enamel) was estimated to begin at about 4 μm per day; this is seen in only baby teeth for modern apes.

Protein sequencing of &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; enamel identified alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein (AHSG), which, in modern apes, is important in bone and dentine mineralisation. Because it was found in enamel, and not dentine, AHSG may have been an additional component in &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; which facilitated biomineralisation of enamel during prolonged amelogenesis (enamel growth).

===Pathology===
&quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; molars have a high cavity rate of 11%, which could mean fruit was commonly included in its diet. The molars from &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; Cave frequently exhibit pitting enamel hypoplasia, where the enamel improperly forms with pits and grooves. This can be caused by malnutrition during growth years, which could point to periodic food shortages, though it can also be induced by other factors. Specimen PA1601-1 from Yanliang Cave shows evidence of tooth loss of the right second molar before the eruption of the neighboring third molar (which grew slantedly), which suggests this individual was able to survive for a long time despite impaired chewing abilities.

===Society===
The high levels of sexual dimorphism could indicate relatively intense male–male competition, though considering the upper canines only projected slightly farther than the cheek teeth, canine display was probably not very important in agonistic behaviour, unlike modern non-human apes.

==Palaeoecology==

&quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; remains are generally found in what were subtropical evergreen broadleaf forest in South China, except in Hainan which featured a tropical rainforest. Carbon and oxygen isotope analysis of Early Pleistocene enamel suggests &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; inhabited dense, humid, closed-canopy forest. Queque Cave featured a mixed deciduous and evergreen forest dominated by birch, oak, and chinkapin, as well as several low-lying herbs and ferns.

The &quot;&quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; fauna&quot;, one of the most important mammalian faunal groups of the Early Pleistocene of southern China, includes tropical or subtropical forest species. This group has been subdivided into three stages spanning 2.6–1.8 million years ago, 1.8–1.2 million years ago, and 1.2–0.8 million years ago. The early stage is characterised by more ancient Neogene animals such as the gomphotheriid proboscidean (relative of elephants) &quot;Sinomastodon&quot;, the chalicothere &quot;Hesperotherium&quot;, the suid &quot;Hippopotamodon&quot;, the tragulid , and the deer &quot;Cervavitus&quot;. The middle stage is indicated by the appearance of the panda &quot;Ailuropoda wulingshanensis&quot;, the dhole &quot;Cuon antiquus&quot;, and the tapir &quot;Tapirus sinensis&quot;. The late stage features more typical Middle Pleistocene animals such as the panda &quot;Ailuropoda baconi&quot; and the stegodontid proboscidean &quot;Stegodon&quot;. Other classic animals typically include orangutans, macaques, rhinos, the extinct pigs &quot;Sus xiaozhu&quot; and &quot;Sus peii&quot;, muntjac, &quot;Cervus&quot; (a deer), gaur (a cow), the bovid &quot;Megalovis&quot;, and more rarely the large saber-toothed cat &quot;Megantereon&quot;. In 2009, American palaeoanthropologist Russell Ciochon hypothesised an undescribed, chimp-sized ape he identified from a few teeth coexisted with &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot;, which in 2019 was identified as the closely related &quot;Meganthropus&quot;. Longgudong Cave may have represented a transitional zone between the Palaearctic and Oriental realms, featuring, alongside the typical &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; fauna, more boreal animals such as hedgehogs, hyenas, horses, the bovid &quot;Leptobos&quot;, and pikas.

== Extinction ==

&quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; fossil sites range across Guangxi, Guizhou, Hainan and Hubei Provinces, but those post-dating about 400,000 years ago are only known from Guangxi. Its youngest remains in China are roughly 295,000 to 215,000 years old, but there is a possible occurrence in the Late Pleistocene in Vietnam. The former correlates with a cooling trend marked by intensifying seasonality and monsoon strength in the region, which led to the encroachment of rainforests by open grasslands. Because &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; teeth dating to this time show evidence of dietary shifts and chronic nutritional stress, it may have been less successful at adapting to these environmental stressors compared to contemporary great apes — namely &quot;Pongo weidenreichi&quot; and &quot;Homo&quot; — which could have led to its extinction. Similarly, &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; seems to only have been consuming C3 forest plants, instead of the C4 savannah plants which were becoming more common during this time. Savannas remained the dominant habitat of Southeast Asia until the Late Pleistocene.

Human activity in southern China is known as early as 800,000 years ago but does not become prevalent until after the extinction of &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot;, so it is unclear if pressures such as competition over resources or overhunting were factors. Zhang et al. in 2024 suggested that there is no evidence of any archaic hominin involvement in the early extinctions of the Pleistocene of southern China.

==Cryptozoology==
&quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; has been used in cryptozoology circles as the identity of the Tibetan yeti or American bigfoot, apelike monsters in local folklore. This began in 1960 with zoologist Wladimir Tschernezky, briefly describing in the journal &quot;Nature&quot; a 1951 photograph of alleged yeti tracks taken by Himalayan mountaineers Michael Ward and Eric Shipton. Tschernezky concluded that the yeti walked like a human and was similar to &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot;. Subsequently, the yeti attracted short-lived scientific attention, with several more authors publishing in &quot;Nature&quot; and &quot;Science&quot;, but this also incited a popular monster hunting following for both the yeti and the similar American bigfoot which has persisted into the present day. The only scientist who continued trying to prove such monsters exist was anthropologist Grover Krantz, who continued pushing for a connection between &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; and bigfoot from 1970 to his death in 2002. Among the binomial names he came up with for bigfoot included &quot;Gigantopithecus canadensis&quot;. Scientists and amateur monster hunters both dismissed Krantz&#x27;s arguments, saying he readily accepted clearly false evidence.

<text>Hell&#x27;s Angels is a 1930 American pre-Code independent epic war film directed and produced by Howard Hughes and director of dialogue James Whale. Written by Harry Behn and Howard Estabrook and starring Ben Lyon, James Hall and Jean Harlow, it was released through United Artists. It follows two dissimilar brothers, both members of the British Royal Flying Corps during the First World War.

The film was originally shot as a silent film. &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;, which ushered in the sound era, premiered several weeks before the start of principal photography for &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot; and left the public clamoring for talking pictures. A year and a half later, Hughes decided to convert his film to sound. The original female lead, Norwegian-American Greta Nissen, had to be replaced due to her accent. Jean Harlow became a major star as her successor. The production took three years (1927–1930) and Hughes spared no expense, so that despite being one of the highest-grossing films of the early sound era, it did not recoup its exorbitant $2.8 million cost.

Hughes and pilot Harry Perry designed many of the stunts for the dogfighting scenes. When Paul Mantz, the principal stunt pilot, informed Hughes that a stunt in the final scene was too dangerous, Hughes piloted the aircraft himself, but crashed; he suffered a skull fracture and had to undergo facial surgery as well. Three stunt pilots and a mechanic died in accidents during filming.

Most of the footage is black-and-white, but there are several one-color-tinted scenes for dramatic effect, such as a nighttime gun duel; part-screen full-color for the flames consuming a German Zeppelin; and full-screen full-color for one sequence, which is the only color footage of Harlow&#x27;s career.

In spite of the difficulties, it was and is today considered a landmark of early sound and color use, and of the epic action film genre. 
== Plot ==

Roy and Monte Rutledge are very different British brothers. Straitlaced Roy loves and idealizes the supposedly demure Helen, but Monte is a womanizer. Their German friend and fellow University of Oxford student Karl is against the idea of having to fight England if another war breaks out.

Meanwhile, in Munich, the oblivious Monte is caught in the arms of a woman by her German officer husband, who insists upon a duel the next morning. Monte flees that night. When Roy is mistaken for his brother, he goes ahead with the duel and is shot in the arm.

Karl is conscripted into the German Navy, and the two British brothers enlist in the Royal Flying Corps. Monte gets a kiss from a girl at the recruiting station.

When Roy finally introduces Monte to Helen, she invites Monte to her flat. Monte tries to rebuff her advances for his brother&#x27;s sake but gives in. The next morning, however, he is for once ashamed of himself.

Meanwhile, Karl is an officer aboard a Zeppelin airship sent to bomb Trafalgar Square, London. As the bombardier-observer, he is lowered below the clouds in a spy basket. He deliberately guides the Zeppelin over water, where the bombs have no effect. Four RFC fighters are sent to intercept the Zeppelin. Roy pilots one, with Monte as his gunner. To gain altitude and speed more quickly, the airship commander decides to sacrifice Karl by cutting the cable that secures his pod. When that is not enough, he orders everything possible to be jettisoned. He then accepts the advice of another officer; the officer and other crewmen obediently leap to their deaths &quot;for Kaiser and fatherland.&quot; German machine gunners shoot down three aircraft; Roy and Monte survive a crash landing. After his machine guns jam or run out of ammunition, the last British pilot aloft dives his fighter into the dirigible, setting it ablaze. The brothers narrowly avoid being killed by the crashing Zeppelin.

Later, Monte is branded a coward in France for shirking his duty when another pilot takes his place and is shot down. Roy and Monte step up when a staff colonel asks for two volunteers for a suicide mission. They are to destroy a vital enemy munitions depot. They will sneak in using a captured German bomber the next morning so that a British brigade will have a chance in their otherwise hopeless afternoon attack.

Roy discovers a drunk Helen in a nightclub with Captain Redfield that night. When he tries to take her home, she turns on him, revealing that she never loved him, that she was, in fact, not the young innocent he believed her to be. Devastated, Roy joins Monte for some carousing. Monte decides not to go on the mission and nearly persuades Roy to do the same, but in the end, Roy drags Monte back to the airfield.

They blow up the German munitions dump but get caught in the act by the Imperial German Flying Corps squadron nicknamed the Flying Circus and led by the legendary &quot;Red Baron&quot; - Manfred von Richthofen. Monte defends the bomber with a machine gun until their squadron arrives, and a dogfight breaks out. Their buddy &quot;Baldy&quot; shoots down the one German still targeting the bomber, but then von Richthofen swoops in and shoots the brothers down. They are captured.

As their use of a German plane violated the laws and customs of war, the brothers have the option of talking or facing a firing squad by none other than Roy&#x27;s old dueling opponent. Monte decides to reveal all he knows of the attack to save his own life. Unable to change his brother&#x27;s mind, Roy convinces Monte that he should speak with the German general alone. He offers to tell what he knows on the condition that there is no witness to his treason but demands a pistol to kill Monte so no one will know of his cowardice. The general gives him his gun and one bullet. Roy cannot persuade Monte to do the right thing and has no choice but to shoot his brother in the back. Afterward, Roy is executed. The British attack gets off to a successful start.

==Production==

&quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot; had been originally conceived as a silent, with James Hall and Ben Lyon as Roy and Monte Rutledge, and Norwegian silent film star Greta Nissen cast as Helen, the female lead, and was to be directed by Marshall Neilan. Principal photography began on October 31, 1927, with interiors shot at the Metropolitan Studio in Hollywood. A few weeks into production, however, Hughes&#x27; overbearing production techniques forced Neilan to quit. Hughes first hired Luther Reed, on loan from Paramount but still was in conflict over directing roles before hiring a more pliable director, Edmund Goulding, but took over the directing reins when it came to the frenetic aerial battle scenes.

The advent of the sound motion picture came with the arrival of &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;, which premiered several weeks before the start of &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot; principal photography. This left the public clamoring for talking pictures and a year and a half into production, after divorcing his wife, the death of two stunt pilots and a mechanic, going through two directors and 2 million dollars, Hughes incorporated the new technology into the half-finished film, but Greta Nissen became the first casualty of the sound age, due to her pronounced Norwegian accent. He paid her for her work and cooperation, and replaced her, because her accent would make her role as a British aristocrat ludicrous. The role was soon filled with a teenage up-and-coming star found by Hall in a revue, and hired by Hughes himself, Jean Harlow.

When Hughes made the decision to turn &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot; into a talkie, he hired a then-unknown James Whale, who had just arrived in Hollywood following a successful turn directing the play &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; in London and on Broadway, to direct the talking sequences; it was Whale&#x27;s film debut, and arguably prepared him for the later success he would have with the feature version of &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot;, &quot;Waterloo Bridge&quot;, and, most famously, the 1931 version of &quot;Frankenstein&quot;. Unhappy with the script, Whale brought in Joseph Moncure March to re-write it. Hughes later gave March the Luger pistol used in the famous execution scene near the film&#x27;s ending.

One talking scene, filmed in Multicolor but printed by Technicolor, provides the only color film footage of Jean Harlow. (Multicolor was not prepared to print the number of inserts needed for the wide release Hughes wanted.) The inexperienced actress, just 18 years old at the time she was cast, required a great deal of attention from Whale, who shut down production for three days while he worked Harlow through her scenes.

During principal photography, Hughes, along with pilot Harry Parry, designed many of the aerial stunts for the dogfighting scenes. Pioneering aerial cinematographer Elmer Dyer captured many of the aerial scenes with Paul Mantz flying as the principal stunt pilot, leading the team of actual World War I pilots hired by Hughes. Hughes, himself an accomplished aviator, personally directed the aerial scenes from overhead, using radio control to coordinate the flying maneuvers.

Mantz considered the final scene, in which an aircraft had to make a steep pullout after a strafing mission, too dangerous, and reported that his pilots would not be able to do the maneuver safely. Hughes piloted the aircraft himself, but as Mantz had predicted, he failed to pull out, crashed and was seriously injured with a skull fracture. He spent the next few days recuperating in the hospital, where he underwent facial surgery. Three other aviators and a mechanic were killed during the film&#x27;s production. Pilot Al Johnson crashed after hitting wires while landing at Caddo Field, near Van Nuys, California, where most of the location filming took place. Pilot C. K. Phillips crashed while delivering an S.E.5 fighter to the Oakland shooting location. Rupert Syme Macalister, an Australian pilot, was also killed, and mechanic Phil Jones died during production after he failed to bail out before the crash of a German Gotha bomber, piloted by Al Wilson, which had been doubled by Igor Sikorsky&#x27;s Sikorsky S-29-A, his first biplane built after his arrival in the United States. In total, 137 pilots were used in filming the last major flying scene.

Due to the delay while Hughes tinkered with the flying scenes, Whale managed to entirely shoot his film adaptation of &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; and release it a month before &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot; was released; the gap between completion of the dialogue scenes and completion of the aerial combat stunts allowed Whale to be paid, sail back to England, and begin work on the subsequent project, making &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot;, Whale&#x27;s actual (albeit uncredited) cinema debut, but his &quot;second&quot; film to be released.

With the majority of the film shot and in editing, Hughes realized a similar film, Darryl F. Zanuck&#x27;s &quot;The Dawn Patrol&quot;, would become a competitor at the box office. After attempting to lease all available period aircraft to stall his competitor, Hughes brought a lawsuit through the Caddo Company and the Gainsborough Corporation, that alleged that the screenplay of &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot; was plagiarized. The lawsuit resulted in &quot;The Dawn Patrol&quot; being rushed through post-production in order to be in theaters before &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot;. In late 1930, Warner Bros. and Zanuck won the suit.

The film was widely reported as being one of the most expensive films ever made, by contemporary sources, with a reputed budget of $4 million. However, this is a myth created by Hughes to publicise the film, and the accounts for &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot; reveal that it in fact cost only $2.8 million, considerably less than the $4 million cost of &quot;Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ&quot;, released three years earlier.

==Reception==
&quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot; received its premiere at Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre in Hollywood on May 27, 1930. All the stars and makers of the film attended, as well as Cecil B. DeMille, Buster Keaton, Gloria Swanson, Dolores del Río, Loretta Young and Grant Withers, Norma Talmadge, Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks, Billie Dove, Joe E. Brown, Joel McCrea, Bebe Daniels, Charles Farrell, Ruth Roland and Ben Bard, Mary Brian, Jackie Coogan, Sally Eilers and Hoot Gibson, Lawrence Tibbett, Sally Blane, Wheeler and Woolsey, Joseph Schildkraut, and Charlie Chaplin with his girlfriend Georgia Hale. A program with leather cover was designed for the premiere by famed aviation illustrator Clayton Knight. Reviews were universal in acclaim for the flying scenes but the mundane plot and maudlin characterizations were also noted. The &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot; screening revealed many traits of pre-code Hollywood. In addition to some fairly frank sexuality, there was a surprising amount of adult language (for the time) during the final dogfight sequence, e.g. &quot;son of a bitch&quot;, &quot;goddamn it&quot;, and &quot;for Christ&#x27;s sake&quot;, along with the words &quot;ass&quot;, &quot;hell&quot;, and a few uses of &quot;God&quot; in other scenes.

While Harlow, Lyon and Hall received mixed reviews for their acting, Hughes was praised for his hard work on the filming and aircraft sequences. Morduant Hall, reviewer for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, was especially critical about Harlow&#x27;s performance, saying, &quot;his film is absorbing and exciting. But while she is the center of attraction, the picture is a most mediocre piece of work.&quot;

Harlow had top billing on the posters but in the film itself, she was billed third under Lyon and Hall.

It earned $2.5 million for its backers at the box office, which made it one of the highest grossing sound films of its era, but still slightly less than its $2.8 million production costs.

Tony Gaudio and Harry Perry were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Cinematography.

==Legacy==
* In 1962, film director Stanley Kubrick cited &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot; as one of his 10 favorite films that influenced his later career.
* The 1977 TV film &quot;The Amazing Howard Hughes&quot; has one passage where Hughes (Tommy Lee Jones) directs the Zeppelin segment over and over in non-stop takes: although he did repeated takes, Hughes, in reality, shot the Zeppelin scenes and left the partially shot footage untouched except for adding sound. According to film experts, he did not do any retakes of the Zeppelin sequence.
* Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;The Aviator&quot;, a 2004 biopic of Hughes, during the opening act portrays the making of &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot; and later its premiere at Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre.
* The line &quot;Would you be shocked if I put on something more comfortable?&quot;, spoken by Jean Harlow, was nominated for the American Film Institute 2005 list AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes.

&quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot; has been re-released on VHS and DVD formats by Universal Studios, which in later years acquired the rights to the film. In its original British release, the censor cut more than 30 minutes from the film.

The involvement of Howard Hughes in &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot; spawned a niche within enthusiasts in entertainment, aviation and militaria collectibles groups. Aviation enthusiasts have referenced the quality and authenticity of World War I aviation in the film.

<text>Norwegian dialects () are commonly divided into four main groups, &#x27;Northern Norwegian&#x27; (), &#x27;Central Norwegian&#x27; (), &#x27;Western Norwegian&#x27; (), and &#x27;Eastern Norwegian&#x27; (). Sometimes &#x27;Midland Norwegian&#x27; () and/or &#x27;South Norwegian&#x27; () are considered fifth or sixth groups.

The dialects are generally mutually intelligible, but differ significantly with regard to accent, grammar, syntax, and vocabulary. If not accustomed to a particular dialect, even a native Norwegian speaker may have difficulty understanding it. Dialects can be as local as farm clusters, but many linguists note an ongoing regionalization, diminishing, or even elimination of local variations.

Spoken Norwegian typically does not exactly follow the written languages &quot;Bokmål&quot; and &quot;Nynorsk&quot; or the more conservative &quot;Riksmål&quot; and &quot;Høgnorsk&quot;, except in parts of Finnmark (where the original Sami population learned Norwegian as a second language). Rather, most people speak in their own local dialect. There is no &quot;standard&quot; spoken Norwegian.

== Evolution ==
Owing to geography and climate, Norwegian communities were often isolated from each other until the early 20th century. As a result, local dialects had a tendency to be influenced by each other in singular ways while developing their own idiosyncrasies. Oppdal Municipality, for example, has characteristics in common with coastal dialects to the west, the dialects of northern Gudbrandsdalen to the south, and other dialects in Sør-Trøndelag from the north. The linguist Einar Haugen documented the particulars of the Oppdal dialect, and the writer Inge Krokann used it as a literary device. Other transitional dialects include the dialects of Romsdal and Arendal.

On the other hand, newly industrialized communities near sources of hydroelectric power have developed dialects consistent with the region but in many ways unique. Studies in such places as Høyanger, Odda, Tyssedal, Rjukan, Notodden, Sauda, and others show that koineization has effected the formation of new dialects in these areas.

Similarly, in the early 20th century a dialect closely approximating standard Bokmål arose in and around railway stations. This was known as (&quot;station language&quot;) and may have contributed to changes in dialect around these centers.

== Social dynamics ==

Until the 20th century, upward social mobility in a city like Oslo could in some cases require conforming speech to standard Riksmål. Studies show that even today, speakers of rural dialects may tend to change their usage in formal settings to approximate the formal written language. This has led to various countercultural movements ranging from the adoption of traditional forms of Oslo dialects among political radicals in Oslo, to movements preserving local dialects. There is widespread and growing acceptance that Norwegian linguistic diversity is worth preserving.

The trend today is a regionalisation of the dialects causing smaller dialectal traits to disappear and rural dialects to merge with their nearest larger dialectal variety.

There is no standard dialect for the Norwegian language as a whole, and all dialects are by now mutually intelligible. Hence, widely different dialects are used frequently and alongside each other, in almost every aspect of society. Criticism of a dialect may be considered criticism of someone&#x27;s personal identity and place of upbringing, and is considered impolite. Not using one&#x27;s proper dialect would be bordering on awkward in many situations, as it may signal a wish to take on an identity or a background which one does not have. Dialects are also an area from which to derive humour both in professional and household situations.

== Distinctions ==
There are many ways to distinguish among Norwegian dialects. These criteria are drawn from the work &quot;Vårt Eget Språk/Talemålet&quot; (1987) by Egil Børre Johnsen. These criteria generally provide the analytical means for identifying most dialects, though most Norwegians rely on experience to tell them apart.

=== Grammars and syntax ===

==== Infinitive forms ====
One of the most important differences among dialects is which ending, if any, verbs have in the infinitive form. In Old Norwegian, most verbs had an infinitive ending (-a), and likewise in a modern Norwegian dialect, most of the verbs of the dialect either have or would have had an infinitive ending. There are five varieties of the infinitive ending in Norwegian dialects, constituting two groups:

One ending (western dialects)
* Infinitive ending with -a, e.g., , , common in southwestern Norway, including the areas surrounding Bergen (although not in the city of Bergen itself) and Stavanger (city)
* Infinitive ending with -e, e.g., , , common in Troms, Finnmark, areas of Sogn og Fjordane and Møre og Romsdal, southern counties, and a few other areas.
* Apocopic infinitive, where no vowel is added to the infinitive form, e.g., , , common in certain areas of Nordland

Two different endings (eastern dialects)
* Split infinitive, in which some verbs end with -a while others end with -e; e.g. versus , common in Eastern Norway
* Split infinitive, with apocope, e.g., (//) versus , common in some areas in Sør-Trøndelag and Nord-Trøndelag

The split distribution of endings is related to the syllable length of the verb in Old Norse. &quot;Short-syllable&quot; () verbs in Norse kept their endings. The &quot;long-syllable&quot; () verbs lost their (unstressed) endings or had them converted to -e.

==== Dative case ====
The original Germanic contextual difference between the dative and accusative cases, standardized in modern German and Icelandic, has degenerated in spoken Danish and Swedish, a tendency which spread to Bokmål too. Ivar Aasen treated the dative case in detail in his work, &quot;Norsk Grammatik&quot; (1848), and use of Norwegian dative as a living grammatical case can be found in a few of the earliest Landsmål texts. However, the dative case has never been part of official Landsmål/Nynorsk.

It is, however, present in some spoken dialects north of Oslo, Romsdal, and south and northeast of Trondheim. The grammatical phenomenon is highly threatened in the mentioned areas, while most speakers of conservative varieties have been highly influenced by the national standard languages, using only the traditional accusative word form in both cases. Often, though not always, the difference in meaning between the dative and accusative word forms can thus be lost, requiring the speaker to add more words to specify what was actually meant, to avoid potential loss of information.

==== Future tense ====
There are regional variations in the use of future tense, for example, &quot;He is going to travel.&quot;:
: &quot;.&quot;
: &quot;.&quot;

==== Syntax ====
Syntax can vary greatly between dialects, and the tense is important for the listener to get the meaning. For instance, a question can be formed without the traditional &quot;asking-words&quot; (how, where, what, who..)

For example, the sentence &quot;?&quot; (in Bokmål), &quot;?&quot; (in Nynorsk), literally: &quot;How much is the clock?&quot; i.e. &quot;What time is it?&quot; can be put in, among others, the following forms:
: &quot;?&quot; (Is the clock much?) (stress is on &quot;the clock&quot;)
: &quot;?&quot; (Is it much, the clock?) (stress on &quot;is&quot;)
: &quot;?&quot; (literally: &quot;What is the clock?&quot;)
: &quot;?&quot; (literally: What the clock is?), or, using another word for clock, &quot;?&quot;
: &quot;?&quot; (literally: What is she?).

=== Pronunciation of vowels ===

==== Diphthongization of monophthongs ====
Old Norse had the diphthongs , , and , but the Norwegian spoken in the area around Setesdal has shifted two of the traditional diphthongs and innovated four more from long vowels, and, in some cases, also short vowels.

West Norwegian dialects have also innovated new diphthongs. In Midtre you can find the following:

==== Monophthongization of diphthongs ====
The Old Norse diphthongs , , and have experienced monophthongization in certain dialects of modern Norwegian.

This shift originated in Old East Norse, which is reflected in the fact that Swedish and Danish overwhelmingly exhibit this change. Monophthongization in Norway ends on the coast west of Trondheim and extends southeast in a triangle into central Sweden. Some Norwegian dialects, east of Molde, for example, have lost only and .

==== Leveling ====
(/ in Norwegian) This is a phenomenon in which the root vowel and end vowel in a word approximate each other. For example, the old Norse has become or in certain dialects. There are two varieties in Norwegian dialects – one in which the two vowels become identical, the other where they are only similar. Leveling exists only in inland areas in Southern Norway, and areas around Trondheim.

==== Vowel shift in strong verbs ====
In all but Oslo and coastal areas just south of the capital, the present tense of certain verbs take on a new vowel (umlaut), e.g., becomes (in Oslo, it becomes ).

=== Pronunciation of consonants ===

==== Eliminating in the plural indefinite form ====
In some areas, the is not pronounced in all or some words in their plural indefinite form. There are four categories:
* The is retained – most of Eastern Norway, the South-Eastern coast, and across to areas north and east of Stavanger.
* The disappears altogether – Southern tip of Norway, coastal areas north of Bergen, and inland almost to Trondheim.
* The is retained in certain words but not in others – coastal areas around Trondheim, and most of Northern Norway
* The is retained in certain words and in weak feminine nouns, but not in others – one coast area in Nordland.

==== Phonetic realization of ====
Most dialects realize as the alveolar tap or alveolar trill . However, for the last 200 years the uvular approximant has been gaining ground in Western and Southern Norwegian dialects, with Kristiansand, Stavanger, and Bergen as centers. The uvular R has also been adopted in aspiring patricians in and around Oslo, to the point that it was for some time fashionable to &quot;import&quot; governesses from the Kristiansand area. In certain regions, such as Oslo, the flap has become realized as a retroflex flap (generally called &quot;thick L&quot;) , which exists only in Norway, a few regions in Sweden, and in completely unrelated languages. The sound coexists with other retroflexions in Norwegian dialects. In some areas it also applies to words that end with &quot;rd,&quot; for example with (farm) being pronounced . The uvular R has gained less acceptance in eastern regions, and linguists speculate that dialects that use retroflexes have a &quot;natural defense&quot; against uvular R and thus will not adopt it. However, the dialect of Arendal retains the retroflexes, while featuring the uvular R in remaining positions, e.g. .

In large parts of Northern Norway, especially in the northern parts of Nordland county and southern parts of Troms county, as well as several parts of Finnmark county, another variant is still common: the voiced post-alveolar sibilant fricative . In front of voiceless consonants, the realisation of this R is unvoiced as well, to . Thus, where one in the southern and Trøndelag dialects will get or or , in areas realising voiced R as , one will get .

==== Palatalization ====
In areas north of an isogloss running between Oslo and Bergen, palatalization occurs for the n (IPA ), l (), t () and d () sounds in varying degrees. Areas just south and southwest of Trondheim palatalize both the main and subordinate syllable in words (e.g., ), but other areas only palatalize the main syllable ().

==== Voicing of plosives ====
Voiceless stops () have become voiced () intervocalically after long vowels (, vs. , ) on the extreme southern coast of Norway, including Kristiansand, Mandal and Stavanger. The same phenomenon appears in Sør-Trøndelag and one area in Nordland.

==== Segmentation ====
The geminate in southwestern Norway has become , while just east in southcentral Norwegian the final is lost, leaving . The same sequence has been palatalized in Northern Norway, leaving the palatal lateral .

==== Assimilation ====
The second consonant in the consonant clusters , , and has assimilated to the first across most of Norway, leaving , , and respectively. Western Norway, though not in Bergen, retains the cluster. In Northern Norway this same cluster is realized as the palatal lateral .

==== Consonant shift in conjugation of masculine nouns ====
Although used less frequently, a subtle shift takes place in conjugating a masculine noun from indefinitive to definitive, e.g., from to (, [beçːen] or ). This is found in rural dialects along the coast from Farsund Municipality to the border between Troms and Finnmark.

==== The kj - sj merger ====
Many people, especially in the younger generation, have lost the differentiation between the (written ) and (written ) sounds, realizing both as . This is by many considered to be a normal development in language change (although as most language changes, the older generation and more conservative language users often lament the degradation of the language). The functional load is relatively low, and as often happens, similar sounds with low functional loads merge.

=== Tonemes and intonation ===

There are great differences between the intonation systems of different Norwegian dialects.

=== Vocabulary ===
==== First person pronoun, nominative plural ====
Three variations of the first person plural nominative pronoun exist in Norwegian dialects:
* , (pronounced ), common in parts of Eastern Norway, most of Northern Norway, coastal areas close to Trondheim, and one sliver of Western Norway
* , or , in Southern and most of Western Norway, areas inland of Trondheim, and a few smaller areas
* , common in areas of Sør-Trøndelag, Gudbrandsdalen, Nordmøre and parts of Sunnmøre.

==== First person pronoun, nominative singular ====
There is considerable variety in the way the first person singular nominative pronoun is pronounced in Norwegian dialects. They appear to fall into three groups, within which there are also variations:
* and , in which the hard &#x27;g&#x27; may or may not be included. This is common in most of Southern and Western Norway, Trøndelag, and most of Northern Norway. In some areas of Western Norway, it is common to say .
* (pronounced ), in a few areas in Western Norway (Romsdal/Molde) and Snåsa in Nord Trøndelag
* , jè , or jei , in areas around Oslo, and north along the Swedish border, almost to Trondheim, as well as one region in Troms

==== Personal pronouns ====
==== Possessive pronouns ====
==== The word &quot;not&quot; ====
The Norwegian word for the English &quot;not&quot; exists in these main categories:
: – Oslo, Kristiansand, Bergen, Ålesund, most of Finnmark, Vestfold and lowland parts of Telemark, and some cities in Nordland.
: – most of Southern, Northern, Western Norway and high-land parts of Telemark.
: – Trøndelag
: - parts of Salten District, Nordland
: or ittje – areas north of Oslo, along the Swedish border
: , ente or ette – Mostly along the Swedish border south of Oslo in Østfold
: /

Examples of the sentence &quot;I am not hungry,&quot; in Norwegian:
: : &quot;.&quot; (Bokmål)
: : &quot;.&quot; (Nynorsk)
: : &quot;.&quot; (Romsdal)
: : &quot;.&quot; (Trøndelag)
: : &quot;.&quot; (Salten)
: : &quot;.&quot; (Narvik)
: : &quot;.&quot; (Hærland)

<text>Radu Ştefan Mazăre (born 5 July 1968) is a Romanian ex-politician. His political activity began with his election to the lower house of the Parliament on the Democratic Party (PD) list, which he left in 1997 to serve as an independent. In 2000, he defeated all party-supported contestants to be elected mayor of Constanța, one of Romania&#x27;s largest cities and its foremost seaport. Joining the Social Democratic Party (PSD) in 2003, he went on to win the following three elections with a comfortable majority. In 2015, during his fourth term, Mazăre resigned amid accusations of corruption, citing the unbearable stress caused by what he claimed to be politically motivated investigations. In 2017, he fled while under bail to Madagascar, claiming the right of asylum, but he was extradited back to Romania on 20 May 2019 to serve a 9-year sentence in prison. His brother, Alexandru Mazăre, also served as an MP.

==Education==
He is a graduate of the &quot;Mircea cel Bătrân&quot; Naval Academy (Electromechanics Department) in Constanța, class of 1991.

==Career==
He founded the now-defunct &quot;Telegraf&quot; newspaper, the now-defunct Neptun TV channel and was a shareholder of the Conpress Holding. He joined the Democratic Party (PD) and was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1996. He later resigned due to &quot;differences between electoral promises and [the] realities of government&quot;.

==Controversies==

He is considered one of the top 300 richest people in Romania and was accused of being a so-called &quot;local baron&quot; of the Social Democratic Party (PSD). 

In November 2008, &quot;The Diplomat&quot; reported that the National Anti-corruption Department had accused Mazăre, along with 36 other municipal employees, of corruption, abuse of public service, forgery, and criminal complicity. The group was charged with giving €114 million ($144 million) worth of state-owned land along the coast of the Black Sea and public beaches in Constanta and Mamaia to individuals, including Mazăre&#x27;s family. Mazăre was awarded 5,000 Romanian Lei in damages after the Anti-corruption Department refused to provide information about the qualification of the experts. 
Another controversial event took place in July 2009 when, during a fashion show, Radu Mazăre participated wearing a Nazi Wehrmacht uniform, together with his son, who was also wearing a Nazi uniform. He explained that he &quot;always liked this uniform, and admired the rigorous organization of the German army&quot;. According to Mazăre, &quot;I checked it before I put it on but the swastika was very small and I didn&#x27;t see it&quot;. Two days later he issued a public apology to Jewish organisations, declaring that by wearing the uniform he wanted to pay homage to Claus von Stauffenberg, a leading member of the failed plot to kill Adolf Hitler during World War II.

Radu Mazăre in the year 2003 introduced the &quot;tax for increasing the degree of peace and security in carrying out economic activities in Constanța, Mamaia and Sat Vacanţa&quot; (taxa pentru creșterea gradului de liniște și siguranță în derularea activităților economice în Constanța, Mamaia și Sat Vacanță). This tax was attacked and canceled by the prefect of Constanța county Dănuț Culețu in 2006. Although this tax was considered abusive, it was reintroduced in disagreement with 31337 debtors from Constanta, in 2009. Among the population, this tax was also called: &quot;Mazăre&#x27;s Protection tax&quot; or ”The Al Capone Tax”. The tax remained uncontested until 2015, when the president of the ACIA, civic activist Andrei Popescu, initiated a campaign to collect signatures to end this abuse. The campaign had a real support from the people of Constanta, gathering over 7,000 signatories.

In early 2015, Mazăre was placed under indictment and investigated for corruption-related offenses by the National Anticorruption Directorate.

In July 2017, after nine years of trial, Mazăre was convicted and given a three-year suspended sentence for the illegal sales.

At the end of 2017, Mazăre fled to Madagascar, where he owns a holiday resort, asking for the right of asylum.

In May 2018, Mazăre received a six and a half-year prison sentence for abuse of power in a case related to the sale of a 15,000 sqm-plot of land in the Mamaia resort, subject to appeal. Subsequently, on 8 February 2019, Mazăre was handed a final 9-year imprisonment sentence in the Mamaia affair.
In May 2019 he was repatriated to Romania under an international warrant, to serve 9 years in prison.

<doc id="1282862" wikidata="Q3322718" url="?curid=1282862" title="Montgomery C. Meigs">
<text>Montgomery Cunningham Meigs (; May 3, 1816 – January 2, 1892) was a career United States Army officer and military and civil engineer, who served as Quartermaster General of the U.S. Army during and after the American Civil War. Although a Southerner from Georgia, Meigs strongly opposed secession and supported the Union. His record as Quartermaster General was regarded as outstanding, both in effectiveness and in ethical probity, and Secretary of State William H. Seward viewed Meigs&#x27; leadership and contributions as key factors in the Union victory in the war.

Meigs was one of the principal architects of Arlington National Cemetery. Meigs&#x27;s decision to locate the cemetery on Robert E. Lee&#x27;s family estate, Arlington House, was partly a gesture to humiliate Lee for siding with the Confederacy.

==Early life and education==

Meigs was born in Augusta, Georgia, in May 1816. He was the son of Dr. Charles Delucena Meigs and Mary Montgomery Meigs. His father was a nationally known obstetrician and professor of obstetrics at Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia. His grandfather, Josiah Meigs, graduated from Yale University, where he was a classmate of future dictionary creator Noah Webster and American Revolutionary War general and politician Oliver Wolcott, and later was president of the University of Georgia. Montgomery Meigs&#x27; mother, Mary, was the granddaughter of a Scottish family from Brigend with somewhat distant claims to a baronetcy, which emigrated to America in 1701.

Meigs&#x27; father apprenticed as a physician in Philadelphia until 1812, at which time he moved to Athens, Georgia. He enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia three years later, in 1815, the same year he began to practice medicine in Georgia. Charles Meigs received his medical degree from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in 1817, and that summer he moved his family, which then included a one-year-old Montgomery, to Philadelphia and established a practice there. The Meigs family was wealthy and well-connected, and Charles Meigs was a strong supporter of the Democratic Party. Meigs had an extremely good memory, and his father instilled in him a sense of duty and a desire to pursue honorable causes. Young Montgomery received schooling at the Franklin Institute and then a preparatory school for the University of Pennsylvania. Meigs learned French, German, and Latin, and studied art, literature, and poetry. He enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania when he was only 15 years old. A hard worker, he was one of the top students at the university.

The Meigs family had extensive ties to the military and to the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York. Montgomery Meigs wished to serve in the United States Army. West Point was the only well established engineering school in the United States at the time. Through family connections, Meigs won an appointment to West Point, entering in 1832. He excelled academically at West Point, although he said he spent too much time with athletics and outdoor activities. He was among the top three students in French and mathematics, and did well in history. He graduated fifth out of a class of 49 in 1836, and he had more good conduct merits that ranked in the top third his class.

He received a commission as a second lieutenant in the 1st U.S. Artillery, but most of his army service was with the Corps of Engineers, in which he worked on important engineering projects.

In his early assignments, Meigs helped build Fort Mifflin and Fort Delaware, both on the Delaware River, and Fort Wayne on the Detroit River. He also served under the command of then-Lt. Robert E. Lee to make navigational improvements on the Mississippi River. Beginning in 1844, Meigs also was involved with the construction of Fort Montgomery on Lake Champlain in upstate New York.

Within a few days of each other, in late March 1853, Meigs became responsible for supervising both the building of the Washington Aqueduct and the enlargement of the United States Capitol. His favorite pre-Civil War engineering project was the Washington Aqueduct, which he supervised from 1852 to 1860. It involved constructing the monumental Union Arch Bridge across Cabin John Creek, designed by Alfred L. Rives, which for 50 years remained the longest single-span masonry arch in the world. From 1853 to 1859, he also supervised the building of the wings and dome of the United States Capitol and, from 1855 to 1859, the extension of the General Post Office Building.

In the fall of 1860, as a result of a disagreement over procurement contracts, Meigs incurred the ill will of the Secretary of War, John B. Floyd, and was banished to Tortugas in the Gulf of Mexico to construct fortifications there and at Key West, including Fort Jefferson, Florida. Upon the resignation of Floyd a few months later, Meigs was recalled to his work on the aqueduct at Washington.

==Civil War==

Just before the outbreak of the Civil War, Meigs and Lt. Col. Erasmus D. Keyes were quietly charged by President Abraham Lincoln and Secretary of State William H. Seward with drawing up a plan for the relief of Fort Pickens in Florida, by means of a secret expedition. In April 1861, together with Lieutenant David D. Porter of the Navy, they carried out the expedition, embarking under orders from the President without the knowledge of either the Secretary of the Navy or the Secretary of War.

On May 14, 1861, Meigs was appointed colonel, 11th U.S. Infantry, and on the following day, promoted to brigadier general and Quartermaster General of the Army. The previous Quartermaster General, Joseph Johnston, had resigned and become a general in the Confederate Army. Meigs established a reputation for being efficient, hard-driving, and scrupulously honest. He molded a large and somewhat diffuse department into a great tool of war. He was one of the first to fully appreciate the importance of logistical preparations in military planning, and under his leadership, supplies moved forward and troops were transported over long distances with ever-greater efficiency.

James G. Blaine, commenting on Meigs&#x27; work in the quartermaster&#x27;s office, said:
Montgomery C. Meigs, one of the ablest graduates of the Military Academy, was kept from the command of troops by the inestimably important services he performed as Quartermaster General. Perhaps in the military history of the world there never was so large an amount of money disbursed upon the order of a single man ... The aggregate sum could not have been less during the war than fifteen hundred million dollars, accurately vouched and accounted for to the last cent.

U.S. Secretary of State William H. Seward&#x27;s estimated that &quot;without the services of this eminent soldier the national cause must have been lost or deeply imperiled.&quot;

While Meigs served as Quartermaster General throughout the war he went on an extensive inspection tour from August 1863 to January 1864. During that time Colonel Charles Thomas acted in his stead back in Washington, D.C. Meigs&#x27; field services during the Civil War included command of Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s base of supplies at Fredericksburg and Belle Plain, Virginia (1864); command of a division of War Department employees in the defense of Washington at the time of Jubal A. Early&#x27;s raid (July 11 to 14, 1864); personally supervising the refitting and supplying of Major General William T. Sherman&#x27;s army at Savannah (January 5 to 29, 1865), Goldsboro, and Raleigh, North Carolina and reopening Sherman&#x27;s lines of supply (March to April 1865). He was brevetted to major general on July 5, 1864.

A staunch Unionist, Meigs detested the Confederacy. His feelings led directly to the establishment of Arlington National Cemetery. On July 16, 1862, Congress passed legislation authorizing the U.S. federal government to purchase land for national cemeteries for military dead, and put the U.S. Army Quartermaster General in charge of this program. The Soldiers&#x27; Home in Washington, D.C., and the Alexandria Cemetery were the primary burying grounds for war dead in the D.C. area, but by late 1863 both cemeteries were full. In May 1864, Union forces suffered large numbers of dead in the Battle of the Wilderness. Meigs ordered that an examination of eligible sites be made for the establishment for a large new national military cemetery. Within weeks, his staff reported that Arlington Estate was the most suitable property in the area. The property was high and free from floods (which might unearth graves), it had a view of the District of Columbia, and it was aesthetically pleasing. It was also the home of Robert E. Lee, future General-in-Chief of the Confederacy, whom Meigs considered a traitor, and denying Lee use of his home after the war was a valuable political consideration. Although the first military burial at Arlington had been made on May 13, Meigs did not authorize establishment of burials until June 15, 1864. Meigs ordered that the estate be surveyed and that be set aside for use as a cemetery.

===The logistics system===
There was a notable disparity between the Union and Confederate logistical situations. The Confederacy had a longstanding supply deficit, which only intensified as the war dragged on. Union forces, on the other hand, usually had enough food, ammunition, weapons, and other supplies. The Union logistics system, even as it penetrated deeper into the South, maintained its efficiency. Historians credit these achievements to Meigs. Union quartermasters were responsible for most of the $3 billion spent for the war. They operated out of sixteen major depots, which formed the basis of the system of procurement and supply throughout the war. As the war expanded, operation of these depots became much more complex, with an overlapping and interweaving relationship between the army and government operated factories, private factories, and numerous middlemen. The purchase of goods and services through contracts supervised by the quartermasters accounted for most of federal military expenditures, apart from the wages of the soldiers. The quartermasters supervised their own soldiers, and cooperated closely with state officials, manufacturers and wholesalers trying to sell directly to the army; and representatives of civilian workers looking for higher pay at government factories. The complex system was closely monitored by congressmen anxious to ensure that their districts won their share of contracts. The system grew in efficiency to the point Union troops on long marches would simply throw away excess knapsacks, bedrolls, overcoats, and other pieces of clothing and equipment that they felt were weighing them down, fully confident that they would be resupplied at some point in the near future.

===Wartime deaths===
In October 1864, his son, 1st Lieutenant John Rodgers Meigs, was killed at Swift Run Gap in Virginia and was buried at a Georgetown Cemetery. Lt. Meigs was part of a three-man patrol which ran into a three-man Confederate patrol. Lt. Meigs was killed, one man was captured, and one man escaped. To the end of his life, Meigs believed that his son had been murdered after being captured—despite evidence to the contrary. The younger Meigs was laid to rest in Oak Hill Cemetery in Georgetown in Washington, D.C. Both Abraham Lincoln and Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton attended the interment. He was later re-interred at Arlington National Cemetery.

Meigs was also present for Lincoln&#x27;s death. At 10:00 pm on the evening of April 14, 1865, Meigs heard that William Seward had been attacked by a knife-wielding assailant. Meigs rushed to Rodgers House, Seward&#x27;s home on Lafayette Square just across the street from the White House. Shortly after arriving at Seward&#x27;s home, Meigs learned of the shooting of Lincoln. He rushed to the Petersen House across from Ford&#x27;s Theatre, where Lincoln lay dying. Meigs stood at the front door of the house for the rest of the deathwatch. He alone decided who was admitted to the house. When Lincoln died at 7:22 am on April 15, Meigs moved into the parlor to sit with the president&#x27;s body. During Lincoln&#x27;s funeral procession in the city five days later, Meigs rode at the head of two battalions of quartermaster corps soldiers.

==Role in developing Arlington National Cemetery==

Meigs played a critical role in developing Arlington National Cemetery, both during the Civil War and afterward.

Although most burials initially occurred near the freedmen&#x27;s cemetery in the estate&#x27;s northeast corner, in mid-June 1864 Meigs ordered that burials commence immediately on the grounds of Arlington House. Brigadier General René Edward De Russy was living in Arlington House at the time and opposed the burial of bodies close to his quarters, forcing new interments to occur far to the west (in what is now Section 1 of the cemetery). But Meigs still demanded that officers be buried on the grounds of the mansion, around the Lees&#x27; former flower garden. The first officer burial had occurred there on May 17, but with Meigs&#x27; order another 44 officers were buried along the southern and eastern sides within a month. By May 31, more than 2,600 burials had occurred in the cemetery, and Meigs ordered that a white picket fence be constructed around the burial grounds. In December 1865, Robert E. Lee&#x27;s brother, Smith Lee, visited Arlington House and observed that the house could be made livable again if the graves around the flower garden were removed. Meigs hated Lee for betraying the Union, and ordered that more burials occur near the house to make it politically impossible for disinterment to occur.

Meigs himself designed and implemented most of the changes at the cemetery in the 15 years after the war. In 1865, for example, Meigs decided to build a monument to Civil War dead in the center of a grove of trees west of the Lee&#x27;s flower garden. U.S. Army troops were dispatched to investigate every battlefield within a radius of the city of Washington, D.C. The bodies of 2,111 Union and Confederate dead were collected, most of them from the battlefields of First and Second Bull Run, as well as the Union army&#x27;s retreat along the Rappahannock River (which occurred after both battles). Although Meigs had not intended to collect the remains of Confederate war dead, the inability to identify remains meant that both Union and Confederate dead were interred below the cenotaph. U.S. Army engineers chopped down most of the trees and dug a circular pit about wide and deep into the earth. The walls and floor were lined with brick, and it was segmented it into compartments with mortared brick walls. Into each compartment were placed a different body part: skulls, legs, arms, ribs, etc. The vault was half full by the time it was ready for sealing in September 1866. Meigs designed a tall, long, wide grey granite and concrete cenotaph to rest on top of the burial vault. The Civil War Unknowns Monument consists of two long, light grey granite slabs, with the shorter ends formed by sandwiching a smaller slab between the longer two. On the west face was an inscription describing the number of dead in the vault below, and honoring the &quot;unknowns of the Civil War&quot;. Originally, a Rodman gun was placed on each corner, and a pyramid of shot adorned the center of the lid. A circular walk, centered from the center of the memorial, provided access. A walk led east to the flower garden, and another west to the road. Sod was laid around the memorial, and planting beds filled with annual plants emplaced.
Meigs made additional major changes to the cemetery in the 1870s. In 1870, he ordered that a &quot;Sylvan Hall&quot;—a series of three cruciform tree plantings, one inside the other—be planted in the &quot;Field of the Dead&quot; (in what is now Section 13). A year later, Meigs ordered the McClellan Gate constructed. Located just west of the intersection of what is today McClellan and Eisenhower Drives, this was originally Arlington National Cemetery&#x27;s main gate. Built of red sandstone and red brick, the name &quot;MCCLELLAN&quot; tops the simple rectangular gate in gilt letters. But just below the name was inscribed the name &quot;MEIGS&quot;—a tribute to himself which Meigs could not help making. Due to the growing importance of the cemetery as well as the much larger crowds attending Memorial Day observances, Meigs also decided a formal meeting space at the cemetery was needed. A grove of trees southwest of Arlington House was cut down, and an amphitheater (today known as the Tanner Amphitheater) was constructed in 1874. Meigs himself designed the amphitheater.

Meigs continued to work to ensure that the Lee family could never take control of Arlington. In 1882, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in &quot;United States v. Lee&quot; that the seizure of the Arlington estate at a tax sale by the United States was illegal, and returned the estate to George Washington Custis Lee, General Lee&#x27;s oldest son. He, in turn, sold the estate back to the U.S. government for $150,000 in 1883. To commemorate the retention of the estate, in 1884 Meigs ordered that a Temple of Fame be erected in the Lee flower garden. The U.S. Patent Office building had suffered a massive fire in 1877. It was torn down and rebuilt in 1879, but the work went very slowly. Meigs ordered that stone columns, pediments, and entablatures which had been saved from the Patent Office be used to construct the Temple of Fame. The Temple was a round, Greek Revival, temple-like structure with Doric columns supporting a central dome. Inscribed on the pediment supporting the dome were the names of great Americans such as George Washington, Ulysses S. Grant, Abraham Lincoln, and David Farragut. A year after it was built, the names of Union Civil War generals were carved into its columns. Since not enough marble was available to rebuild the dome, a tin dome (molded and painted to look like marble) was installed, instead. The Temple of Fame was demolished in 1967.

==Postbellum career and death==

Meigs became a permanent resident of the District of Columbia after the war. He purchased a home located at 1239 Vermont Avenue NW (at the corner of Vermont Avenue and N Street).

As Quartermaster General after the Civil War, Meigs supervised plans for the new War Department building (constructed between 1866 and 1867), the National Museum (constructed in 1876), the extension of the Washington Aqueduct (constructed in 1876), and for a hall of records (constructed in 1878). Along with fellow Quartermaster Brigadier General Roeliff Brinkerhoff, Meigs edited a volume entitled, &quot;The Volunteer Quartermaster&quot;, a treatise which was considered the standard guide for the officers and employees of the quartermaster&#x27;s department up until World War I.

From 1866 to 1868, to recuperate from the strain of his war service, Meigs visited Europe. From 1875 to 1876, he made another visit to study the organization of European armies, this time with nephew and Army officer Montgomery M. Macomb assigned as &quot;aide-de-camp&quot;. After his retirement on February 6, 1882, he was succeeded by Daniel H. Rucker and became architect of the Pension Office Building, now home to the National Building Museum. He was a regent of the Smithsonian Institution, a member of the American Philosophical Society, a co-founder of the Philosophical Society of Washington, and one of the earliest members of the National Academy of Sciences.
===Pension Building (1882 to 1887)===
Following the end of the Civil War, the US Congress passed legislation that greatly extended the scope of pension coverage for both veterans and their survivors and dependents, notably their widows and orphans. This greatly increased the number of staff needed to administer the new benefits system. More than 1,500 clerks were required, and a new building was needed to house them. Meigs was chosen to design and construct the new building, now the National Building Museum. He broke away from the established Greco-Roman models that had been the basis of government buildings in Washington, D.C., until then, and was to continue following the completion of the Pension Building. Meigs based his design on Italian Renaissance precedents, notably Rome&#x27;s Palazzo Farnese and Palazzo della Cancelleria.
Included in his design was a long sculptured frieze executed by Caspar Buberl. Since creating a work of sculpture of that size was well out of Meigs&#x27;s budget, he had Buberl create 28 different scenes (totaling in length), which were then mixed and slightly modified to create the continuous long parade that includes over 1,300 figures. Because of the way the 28 sections are modified and mixed up, only somewhat careful examination reveals the frieze to be the same figures repeated over and over. The sculpture includes infantry, navy, artillery, cavalry, and medical components, as well as a good deal of the supply and quartermaster functions. Meigs&#x27;s correspondence with Buberl reveals that Meigs insisted that one teamster, &quot;must be a negro, a plantation slave, freed by war,&quot; be included in the quartermaster panel. This figure was ultimately to assume a position in the center, over the west entrance to the building.

When Philip Sheridan was asked to comment on the building, his reply echoed the sentiment of many of the Washington establishment of the day, that the only thing that he could find wrong with the building was that it was fireproof. (A similar quote is also attributed to William T. Sherman, so the story might well be apocryphal.) The completed building, sometimes referred to as &quot;Meigs&#x27;s Old Red Barn&quot;, was created by using more than 15,000,000 bricks, which, according to the wits of the day, were all counted by the parsimonious Meigs.

===Death===
Meigs contracted a cold on December 27, 1891. Within a few days, it turned into pneumonia. Meigs died at home at 5:00 pm on January 2, 1892. His body was interred with high military honors in Arlington National Cemetery. General orders issued at the time of his death declared, &quot;the Army has rarely possessed an officer ... who was entrusted by the government with a great variety of weighty responsibilities, or who proved himself more worthy of confidence.&quot;

==Family==
In 1841, Meigs married Louisa Rodgers (1816–1879), the daughter of Commodore John Rodgers. Their children included:

*John Rodgers Meigs (1842–1864), a West Point graduate and Army officer who was killed in action during the Civil War
*Mary Montgomery Meigs (1843–1930), the wife of Army officer Joseph Hancock Taylor, who was the son of Union Army Brigadier General Joseph Pannell Taylor, and nephew of President Zachary Taylor
*Charles Delucena Meigs (1845–1853), who was named for Meigs&#x27; father
*Montgomery Meigs (1847–1931), a civil engineer who enjoyed a long career in railroad, bridge, canal, power plant, and road construction
*Vincent Trowbridge Meigs (1851–1853)

<text>The Christian Democratic Union (, &quot;UDC), formerly known asPopular Democracy(,DP&quot;&#x27;) was a Christian democratic political party in Ecuador. It was formed in the 1970s by centrist Christian Democrats who had left the Social Christian Party and the left wing of the Conservative Party who were oriented towards Liberation theology. It officially registered as a political party in 1979. It was originally considered a centre-left party. Later in the 1990s, it shifted to the centre-right.

It reached its first great success in 1978 when party member Osvaldo Hurtado became the running mate on the successful presidential ticket of Jaime Roldós of the Concentration of People&#x27;s Forces. Hurtado served as President of Ecuador from 1981 to 1984 due to Roldós&#x27;s death in office. It was Ecuador&#x27;s largest political party, having won 35% of the seats in the 1998 elections to the Congreso Nacional. In the 1998 presidential elections, party member Jamil Mahuad was elected president, and after a coup d&#x27;état and brief military rule, he was succeeded in 2000 by the vice-president, Gustavo Noboa, who was also in the party.

At the legislative elections, 20 October 2002, the party won 4 out of 100 seats. In 2006, it dropped the name of Popular Democracy and took the current one. At the elections, held in October 2006, it won 2 seats in the Congress. It had no presidential candidate.

The UDC was a member of the Christian Democrat Organization of America, continental organization of the Centrist Democrat International.

In 2013, the UDC was dissolved after the National Congress of the party.

<doc id="1282878" wikidata="Q181333" url="?curid=1282878" title="Francis II Rákóczi">
<text>Francis II Rákóczi (, ; 27 March 1676 – 8 April 1735) was a Hungarian nobleman and leader of the Rákóczi&#x27;s War of Independence against the Habsburgs in 1703–1711 as the prince () of the Estates Confederated for Liberty of the Kingdom of Hungary. He was also Prince of Transylvania, an Imperial Prince, and a member of the Order of the Golden Fleece. Today he is considered a national hero in Hungary.

His name is historically also spelled Rákóczy, in , in , in , in (, ), in , in .

Although the Hungarian parliament offered Rákóczi the royal crown, he refused it, choosing instead the temporary title of the &quot;Ruling Prince of Hungary&quot;. Rákóczi intended to bear this military-sounding title only during the anti-Habsburg war of independence. By refusing the royal crown, he proclaimed to Hungary that it was not his personal ambition that drove the war of liberation against the Habsburg dynasty.

==Childhood==
He was the richest landlord in the Kingdom of Hungary and the count (&quot;comes perpetuus&quot;) of the &quot;Comitatus Sarossiensis&quot; (in Hungarian &quot;Sáros&quot;), now in northeastern Slovakia, from 1694 on. He was the third of three children born to Francis I Rákóczi, elected ruling prince of Transylvania, and Ilona Zrínyi, who was the daughter of Petar Zrinski, Ban of Croatia, and niece of Petar&#x27;s older brother, Miklós Zrínyi. His paternal grandfather George Rákóczi II and great-grandfather George I Rákóczi were also princes of Transylvania. He had a brother, George, who died as a baby before Francis was born, and a sister, Julianna Rákóczi, later Countess of Aspremont-Lynden, who was four years older than Francis. His father died when he was four months old.

Upon Ferenc I&#x27;s death, his widow requested guardianship of her children; however, the advisors of Emperor Leopold I insisted that he retain guardianship of both Ferenc and his sister, especially as Francis I had willed this before death. Despite further difficulties, Zrínyi was able to raise her children, while the Emperor retained legal guardianship. The family lived in the castle of Munkács (today &quot;Mukacheve&quot;, in Ukraine), Sárospatak and Regéc until 1680, when Ferenc&#x27;s paternal grandmother, Sofia Báthory, died. Then, they moved permanently into the castle of Munkács. Rákóczi retained strong affection for this place throughout his life. Aside from his mother, Rákóczi&#x27;s key educators were György Kőrössy, castellan to the family, and János Badinyi.

==End of the Thököly uprising==

Zrínyi&#x27;s second husband, Imre Thököly, took little interest in Rákóczi&#x27;s education, as he was by then heavily involved in politics. However, the failure of the Turks to capture the Habsburg capital in the Battle of Vienna in 1683 frustrated Thököly&#x27;s plans to become King of Upper Hungary. When the Turks began to grow suspicious of his intentions, Thököly proposed sending the young Rákóczi to Constantinople as a guarantee of his goodwill. But Rákóczi&#x27;s mother opposed this plan, not wishing to be separated from her son.

In 1686 Antonio Carafa besieged their residence, the castle of Munkács. Zrínyi successfully led the defence of the castle for three years, but capitulated in 1688. The two Rákóczi children fell again under the guardianship of Leopold I, and moved to Vienna with their mother. They regained their possessions, but could not leave the city without the Emperor&#x27;s permission.

At the age of 17, the Emperor emancipated Rákóczi from his mother, thereby allowing him to own property. His sister Julianna had interceded for him after marrying a powerful Austrian, General Aspremont. Rákóczi lived with the Aspremonts until his marriage in September 1694, to 15-year-old Princess Charlotte Amalie of Hesse-Wanfried, daughter of Charles, Landgrave of Hesse-Wanfried and a descendant of Saint Elizabeth of Hungary. The couple moved to the Rákóczi castle at Sárospatak, where Rákóczi began to manage his properties.

The Treaty of Karlowitz on 26 January 1699, forced Thököly and Zrínyi into exile. Rákóczi remained in Vienna under the Emperor&#x27;s supervision. Relying on the prevalent anti-Habsburg sentiment, remnants of Thököly&#x27;s peasant army started a new uprising in the Hegyalja region of Northeastern present-day Hungary, which was part of the property of the Rákóczi family. They captured the castles of Tokaj, Sárospatak and Sátoraljaújhely, and asked Rákóczi to become their leader, but he was not eager to head what appeared to be a minor peasant rebellion. He quickly returned to Vienna, where he tried his best to clear his name.

Rákóczi then befriended Count Miklós Bercsényi, whose property at Ungvár (today &quot;Ужгород (Uzhhorod)&quot;, in Ukraine), lay next to his own. Bercsényi was a highly educated man, the third richest man in the kingdom (after Rákóczi and Simon Forgách), and was related to most of the Hungarian aristocracy.

==Rákóczi uprising==

As the House of Habsburg was on the verge of dying out in Spain, France was looking for allies in its fight against Austrian hegemony. Consequently, they established contact with Rákóczi and promised support if he took up the cause of Hungarian independence. An Austrian spy seized this correspondence and brought it to the attention of the Emperor. As a direct result of this, Rákóczi was arrested on 18 April 1700, and imprisoned in the fortress of Wiener Neustadt (south of Vienna). It became obvious during the preliminary hearings that, just as in the case of his grandfather Péter Zrínyi, the only possible sentence for Ferenc was death. With the aid of his pregnant wife Amelia and the prison commander, Rákóczi managed to escape and flee to Poland. Here he met with Bercsényi again, and together they resumed contact with the French court.
Three years later, the War of the Spanish Succession caused a large part of the Austrian forces in the Kingdom of Hungary to temporarily leave the country. Taking advantage of the situation, Kuruc forces began a new uprising in Munkács, and Rákóczi was asked to head it. He decided to invest his energies in a war of national liberation, and accepted the request. On 15 June 1703, another group of about 3000 armed men headed by Tamás Esze joined him near the Polish city of Ławoczne. Bercsényi arrived too, with French funds and 600 Polish mercenaries.

Most of the Hungarian nobility did not support Rákóczi&#x27;s uprising, because they considered it to be no more than a peasant rebellion. Rákóczi&#x27;s famous call to the nobility of Szabolcs County seemed to be in vain. He did manage to convince the Hajduk (Hungarian soldiers) (emancipated peasant warriors) to join his forces, so his forces controlled most of Kingdom of Hungary to the east and north of the Danube by late September 1703. He continued by conquering Transdanubia soon after.
Since the Austrians had to fight Rákóczi on several fronts, they felt obliged to enter negotiations with him. However, the victory of Austrian and British forces against a combined French-Bavarian army in the Battle of Blenheim on 13 August 1704, provided an advantage not only in the War of the Spanish Succession, but also prevented the union of Rákóczi&#x27;s forces with their French-Bavarian allies.

This placed Rákóczi into a difficult military and financial situation. French support gradually diminished, and a larger army was needed to occupy the already-won land. Meanwhile, supplying the current army with arms and food was beyond his means. He tried to solve this problem by creating a new copper-based coinage, which was not easily accepted in Hungary as people were used to silver coins. Nevertheless, Rákóczi managed to maintain his military advantage for a while – but after 1706, his army was forced into retreat.

A meeting of the Hungarian Diet (consisting of 6 bishops, 36 aristocrats and about 1000 representatives of the lower nobility of 25 counties), held near Szécsény (Nógrád County) in September 1705, elected Rákóczi to be the &quot;vezérlő fejedelem&quot; – (ruling) prince – of the Confederated Estates of the Kingdom of Hungary, to be assisted by a 24-member Senate. Rákóczi and the Senate were assigned joint responsibility for the conduct of foreign affairs, including peace talks.

Encouraged by England and the Netherlands, peace talks started again on 27 October 1705 between the Hungarians and the Emperor. Both sides varied their strategy according to the military situation. One stumbling block was the sovereignty over Transylvania – neither side was prepared to give it up. Rákóczi&#x27;s proposed treaty with the French was stalled, so he became convinced that only a declaration of independence would make it acceptable for various powers to negotiate with him. In 1706, his wife (whom he had not seen in 5 years, along with their sons József and György) and his sister were both sent as peace ambassadors, but Rákóczi rejected their efforts on behalf of the Emperor.

In 1707 during the Great Northern War he was one of the candidates to the throne of Poland, supported by Elżbieta Sieniawska.

On Rákóczi&#x27;s recommendation, and with Bercsényi&#x27;s support, another meeting of the Diet held at Ónod (Borsod county) declared the deposition of the House of Habsburg from the Hungarian throne on 13 June 1707. But neither this act, nor the copper currency issued to avoid monetary inflation, were successful. Louis XIV refused to enter into treaties with Prince Rákóczi, leaving the Hungarians without allies. There remained the possibility of an alliance with Imperial Russia, but this did not materialize either.

At the Battle of Trencsén (German: &quot;Trentschin&quot;, Latin: &quot;Trentsinium&quot;, Comitatus Trentsiniensis, today Trenčín in Slovakia), on 3 August 1708 Rákóczi&#x27;s horse stumbled, and he fell to the ground, which knocked him unconscious. The Kuruc forces thought him dead and fled. This defeat was fatal for the uprising. Numerous Kuruc leaders transferred their allegiance to the Emperor, hoping for clemency. Rákóczi&#x27;s forces became restricted to the area around Munkács and Szabolcs County. Not trusting the word of János Pálffy, who was the Emperor&#x27;s envoy charged with negotiations with the rebels, the Prince left the Kingdom of Hungary for Poland on 21 February 1711.

==Peace agreement==
In Rákóczi&#x27;s absence, Sándor Károlyi was named Commander-in-Chief of the Hungarian forces, and quickly negotiated a peace agreement with János Pálffy. Under its provisions, 12,000 rebels laid down their arms, handed over their flags and took an oath of allegiance to the Emperor on 1 May 1711 in the fields outside Majtény, in Szatmár county.

The Peace of Szatmár did not treat Rákóczi particularly badly. He was assured clemency if he took an oath of allegiance to the Emperor, as well as the freedom to move to Poland if he wanted to leave the Kingdom of Hungary. He did not accept these conditions, doubting the honesty of the Habsburg court, and he did not even recognize the legality of the Peace Treaty, as it had been signed after the death of the Emperor Joseph I on 17 April 1711, which terminated the plenipotential authority of János Pálffy. Subsequently, his Hungarian properties, Munkács and its castle, Szentmiklós (today Palanok Castle, Mukacheve and Chynadiyovo, Ukraine) and 200 villages were confiscated (and, in 1726, given by Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor to Elector-Archbishop Lothar Franz von Schönborn who had helped to defeat Rákóczi).

==Exile==
Rákóczi was offered the Polish Crown twice, supported by Tsar Peter I of Russia. He turned the offers down, though, and remained in Poland until 1712, where he was the honored guest of the Polish aristocracy. For a while he lived in Gdańsk under the pseudonym of &quot;Count of Sáros&quot;.

He left Gdańsk on 16 November 1712, and went to England, where Queen Anne, pressured by the Habsburgs, refused to receive him. Rákóczi then crossed the Channel to France, landing in Dieppe on 13 January 1713. On 27 April he handed a memorandum to Louis XIV reminding him of his past services to France and asking him not to forget Hungary during the coming peace negotiations for the War of the Spanish Succession. But neither the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 nor the Treaty of Rastatt in 1714 made any mention of Hungary or Rákóczi. No provisions were even made to allow Rákóczi&#x27;s two sons, who were kept under surveillance in Vienna, to rejoin their father.

Prince Rákóczi, although not recognized officially by France, was much in favour in the French court. But after the death of Louis XIV on 1 September 1715, he decided to accept the invitation of the Ottoman Empire (still at war with the Habsburgs) to move there. He left France in September 1717, with an entourage of 40 people. and landed at Gallipoli on 10 October 1717. He was received with honors, but his desire to head up a separate Christian army to help in the fight against the Habsburgs was not under serious consideration.
The Ottoman Empire signed the Peace Treaty of Passarowitz with Austria on 21 July 1718. Among its provisions was the refusal of the Turks to extradite the exiled Hungarians. Two years later, the Austrian envoy requested that the exiles be turned over, but the Sultan refused as a matter of honor. Rákóczi and his entourage were settled in the town of Tekirdağ (Rodostó in Hungarian), relatively distant from the Ottoman capital, and a large Hungarian colony grew up around this town on the Sea of Marmara. Bercsényi, Count Simon Forgách, Count Antal Esterházy, Count Mihály Csáky, Miklós Sibrik, Zsigmond Zay, the two Pápays, and Colonel Ádám Jávorka were among many who settled there, sharing the sentiment of the writer Kelemen Mikes, who said, &quot;I had no special reason to leave my country, except that I greatly loved the Prince.&quot;
Rákóczi lived in the Turkish town of Tekirdağ for 18 years. He adopted a set routine: rising early, attending daily Mass, writing and reading in the mornings, and carpentry in the afternoons; visited occasionally by his son, György Rákóczi. Further military troubles in 1733 in Poland awakened his hopes of a possible return to Hungary, but they were not fulfilled. Rákóczi was 59 years old when he died on 8 April 1735.

Rákóczi&#x27;s last will, dated 27 October 1733, left something to all his family members as well as to his fellow exiles. He left separate letters to be sent to the Sultan and to France’s Ambassador to Constantinople, asking them not to forget about his fellow exiles. His internal organs were buried in the Greek church of Rodosto, while his heart was sent to France. After obtaining the permission of the Turkish authorities, Rákóczi&#x27;s body was taken by his faithful chamberlain Kelemen Mikes to Constantinople on 6 July 1735 for burial in Saint-Benoît (then Jesuit) French church in Galata, where he was buried, according to his last wishes, next to his mother Ilona Zrínyi.

His remains were moved on 29 October 1906 to the St. Elisabeth Cathedral in Kassa, Hungary (today Košice, Slovakia), where he is buried with his mother Ilona and his son.
== Personal life ==
On 26 September 1694 in Cologne, he married Landgravine Charlotte Amalie of Hesse-Wanfried, member of the Hesse-Wanfried branch of the House of Hesse, eldest daughter of Charles, Landgrave of Hesse-Wanfried by his second wife, Countess Alexandrine Juliane of Leiningen-Dagsburg (1651-1703).

===Memorials===

His equestrian statue with the famous motto &quot;Cum Deo Pro Patria et Libertate&quot; (&quot;With God for Fatherland and Liberty&quot;) written on its red marble base was erected in front of the Hungarian Parliament Building on Lajos Kossuth Square in 1937, the work of János Pásztor. In the 1950s, the first two words, &quot;Cum Deo&quot; (i.e., &quot;With God&quot;), were removed for ideological reasons; in 1989, they were restored.

When, after 1945, the great Millennium Monument on Heroes&#x27; Square was purged of statues of the Habsburg kings of Hungary, the best Hungarian sculptor of the period, Zsigmond Kisfaludi Strobl, made a new statue of Rákóczi instead of King Lipót II. It was erected in 1953 together with a relief on the base depicting the meeting of Rákóczy and Tamás Esze.

===Places and institutions===
There are 11 Rákóczi streets and 3 Rákóczi squares in Budapest (see: Public place names of Budapest), including one of the most prominent avenues, named (&quot;Rákóczi Avenue&quot;), forming the boundary between Districts VII and VIII. The street was named after him on 28 October 1906 when his remains were brought back to Hungary from Turkey and a long funeral march went along the street to the Eastern Railway Station. , in District VIII, was also named after him in 1874.
A bridge on the Danube at Budapest is named Rákóczi Bridge after him.

In Hungary two villages bear the name of Rákóczi. Rákóczifalva in Jász-Nagykun-Szolnok County was established in 1883 on the former estate of Rákóczi where the Prince had a hunting lodge. The neighbouring Rákócziújfalu became an independent village in 1950 (before that it was part of Rákóczifalva).

The village of Zavadka, today in Ukraine next to the Veretski Pass (Hungarian: &quot;Vereckei-hágó&quot;) where Rákóczi arrived at Hungary in the beginning of the uprising in 1703 and where he said goodbye to his followers in 1711 going into exile was renamed Rákócziszállás in 1889. The neighbouring village of Podpolóc (today Pidpolozzya) where Rákóczi spent a night in 1703 was renamed that year Vezérszállás. After 1918 the two villages got back their former names.

Mount Bovcar (today Bovtsars&#x27;kyy Verkh in present-day Ukraine) and the neighbouring Bovcar Spring was named by the local Rusyn people after Rákóczi who drank from the spring on 18 February 1711. () means &quot;the Tsar was here&quot; in Rusyn language.

The library of Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén county in Miskolc () is named after him.

The house in which he lived has been transformed into Rákóczi Museum, Tekirdağ, open to the visitors every day except Mondays.

===Banknotes===
Rákóczi&#x27;s portrait can be found on Hungarian banknotes. Before it was withdrawn from circulation, it was on the 50-forint note. Since then it has been transferred to the 500-forint note.

===Rákóczi March===

A well-known patriotic tune of the 18th–19th centuries (composer unknown) is named after Rákóczi, as it was reputed to be his favourite, although actually it was composed only in the 1730s. Hector Berlioz orchestrated the piece, and it was also used by Franz Liszt as the basis of his Hungarian Rhapsody No.15. The Rákóczy March remains a popular piece of Hungarian state and military celebrations.

<text>Thrillington is an album produced by English musician Paul McCartney, under the pseudonym Percy &quot;Thrills&quot; Thrillington. It was released in April 1977 in the UK and in May 1977 in the US. It is an instrumental covers album of Paul and Linda McCartney&#x27;s 1971 album &quot;Ram&quot;.

Recorded in June 1971, the album was shelved upon the formation of Wings, and was not released for nearly six years. When &quot;Thrillington&quot; was finally issued, it did not attract much attention, and did not chart. McCartney initially kept his involvement with the project a secret; nevertheless, the project&#x27;s nature and the rather bizarre pseudonym chosen for the credited artist led the few contemporary reviewers who wrote about &quot;Thrillington&quot; to conclude that &quot;Percy Thrillington&quot; was in fact McCartney working incognito. McCartney formally revealed himself to be Percy Thrillington in 1989, and the following year also admitted to being &quot;Clint Harrigan&quot;, who wrote the album&#x27;s liner notes.

In addition to reissues in 1995 and 2018, &quot;Thrillington&quot; was re-issued as part of the deluxe edition of &quot;Ram&quot; in 2012.

==History==
The album was recorded in June 1971 and with an intended release shortly thereafter. Paul McCartney produced the sessions, although he did not play or sing at all on the album, and all arrangements were by Richard Anthony Hewson, who was asked to work on the orchestration before &quot;Ram&quot; had yet been released. The album was completed in three days of recording sessions, but when Paul and Linda decided to form Wings, the (at that point untitled) &quot;Thrillington&quot; album was shelved.

In late 1976, McCartney decided to release the long-in-storage project, and devised a plan to publicize the album while obscuring his own involvement with it. In preparation for the release of &quot;Thrillington&quot;, McCartney invented the fictitious socialite Percy Thrillington, and even took out ads in various UK music papers announcing Thrillington&#x27;s so-called comings and goings to generate curiosity and interest.

Released in April 1977, McCartney&#x27;s name was mentioned only in the main liner notes where he is described as a friend of Percy. &quot;Thrillington&quot; went mostly unnoticed upon its release although it was reviewed by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine and mentioned in the &quot;Random Notes&quot; section. &quot;Variety&quot; also reviewed the album, noting that &quot;Whether Percy Thrillington is Paul McCartney or not is really irrelevant. What matters is that he (they) is (are) having fun.&quot;

Because it was widely assumed that &quot;Thrillington&quot; was the product of McCartney working under a pseudonym, the album became a collector&#x27;s item. McCartney finally admitted his role to journalist Peter Palmiere at a Los Angeles press conference on 27 November 1989 during his world tour: &quot;What a great question to end the conference. The world needs to know! But seriously it was me and Linda – and we kept it a secret for a long time but now the world knows! – you blew it!&quot;

In 1990 Paul McCartney also admitted to Palmiere, via an autograph request, that he was indeed Clint Harrigan – the liner notes writer for &quot;Thrillington&quot; and Wings&#x27; &quot;Wild Life&quot; album. The first person to reveal the identity of Clint Harrigan was John Lennon, who stated as much during a well-publicised letter feud with McCartney in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; (&quot;And your writing inside of the Wings album [Wild Life] isn&#x27;t exactly the Realist is it?&quot;) in December 1971.
The full story of the &quot;Thrillington&quot; album was told in detail in 1995 in Beatles fanzine &quot;Good Day Sunshine&quot; and in music journalist Ian Peel&#x27;s book &quot;The Unknown Paul McCartney&quot; (Reynolds &amp; Hearn, 2002). Peel tracked down various musicians who brought McCartney&#x27;s vision to life – including Richard Hewson, Herbie Flowers and the Mike Sammes Singers – as well as those that were involved in creating its mythology.

==Re-release==
&quot;Thrillington&quot; was issued on CD in 1995 and 2018, the latter with an accompanying vinyl version.

&quot;Thrillington&quot; was re-issued as part of the deluxe edition of &quot;Ram&quot; on 21 May 2012. To coincide with this release, McCartney started a Twitter account under the Thrillington name, posting tweets in a manner similar to the original newspaper announcements. The album was re-issued on CD, vinyl, and limited edition coloured vinyl on 18 May 2018.

<text>What You Cache Is What You Get (WYCIWYG) is a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) scheme commonly displayed in the address bar of Gecko-based Web browsers like Mozilla Firefox as when the Web browser is retrieving cached information. WYCIWYG is a play on the related acronym WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get).

==Usage==

Mozilla Firefox implements a registered, strictly internal URI scheme to sort and later reference locally cached pages that were generated or modified by a script on the client side (a common practice for Web 2.0 sites).

==Security issues==

In 2007 Michał Zalewski reported that it was possible to bypass the same-origin checks and read from cached (wyciwyg) documents. It was possible at that time to access documents without proper same domain policy checks. This could have enabled an attacker to steal sensitive data, perform cache poisoning and execute their own code or display own content with URL bar and SSL certificate data of the original page (URL spoofing). This was fixed in Firefox 2.0.0.5 and SeaMonkey 1.1.3.

<text>Loredana Groza (born 10 June 1970) or mononymously Loredana is a Romanian singer. She is known for continuously reinventing herself and for approaching numerous music styles throughout her discography, ranging from pop to traditional music and manele. In 1987, Groza released her debut single &quot;Bună seara, iubito&quot; (&quot;Good Evening, Love!&quot;), which—even though it was banned and censored in Romania for alleged inappropriate lyrics—became successful and one of her signature songs. Her album of the same name would go on to sell 1.5 million copies, making it the best-selling record of all time in Romania. Over the years, Groza released several acclaimed albums and hit songs, including &quot;Apa&quot; in 2012, which reached number two on the native Airplay 100 chart. The singer was a coach on the Romanian version of the televised competition &quot;The Voice&quot; for its first seven seasons.

== Life and career ==
Loredana Groza was born in Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej (now known as Onești), Romania, on 10 June 1970. She started singing at the age of three and continued to sing throughout her school years. When she was 14, she was noticed by composers Dumitru Moroșanu and Zsolt Kerestely, who invited her to Bucharest for the talent show &quot;Steaua fără nume&quot; (&quot;The Star Without a Name&quot;) although she was too young, as the minimum admission age was 17. She competed in the talent show in 1986, at 16 years old, and won the big prize. In the same year, she competed in the Mamaia Music Festival, where she was awarded the best newcomer prize, which made her the youngest winner ever.

In 1987, at the Costinești Music Festival, she met the acclaimed composer Adrian Enescu, who wrote the song &quot;O inimă de 16 ani&quot; (&quot;A 16-Year-Old Heart&quot;) for her; this was followed by an entire record, her debut album &quot;Bună seara, iubito!&quot; (&quot;Good Evening, Love!&quot;) (1988). Although the title song was not broadcast on Romanian television because of the communist censorship, both the song and the album were huge successes, with the latter being sold in 1.5 million copies. In 1989, Enescu and Lucian Avramescu produced her second album, &quot;Un buchet de trandafiri&quot; (&quot;A Bouquet of Roses&quot;), which was also successful. After a career hiatus until 1994, Groza made a comeback with the album &quot;Atitudine&quot; (&quot;Attitude&quot;) and toured Romania with the band Direcția 5 in 1995. 1995 was also the release year of the album &quot;Născută toamna&quot; (&quot;Born in Autumn&quot;), whilst the gold-certified &quot;Tomilio&quot; followed in 1996. In 1998, Groza released the hugely successful hit single &quot;Lumea e a mea&quot; with B.U.G. Mafia.

Groza appeared on the cover of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine in 2000, which sold out and confirmed her status of a sex symbol. In 2001, Enescu and the singer worked together again for the album &quot;Diva înamorată&quot;. Two albums inspired by traditional music followed in 2001 and 2002: &quot;Agurida&quot;, and &quot;Zarza, vânzătoarea de plăceri&quot; (&quot;Zarza, the Pleasure Seller&quot;). From 2003 to 2006, Groza released the albums &quot;Fata cu șosete de diamant&quot; (&quot;The Girl with Diamond Socks&quot;), &quot;Extravaganza&quot;, and &quot;Jamparalele&quot;. The latter received a gold certification for sales in Romania and included Groza&#x27;s successful hit single &quot;Lele&quot;, with which she attempted to represent Romania at the Eurovision Song Contest 2006. She had previously taken part in the Romanian national final for the contest in 1994 and 1996 with the songs &quot;Nu adio&quot; (&quot;Not Goodbye&quot;) and &quot;Visăm America&quot; (&quot;We Dream of America&quot;), respectively. In 2012, Groza released her highest-charting single on national charts, &quot;Apa&quot;, which reached number two on the Airplay 100. In 2014, she premiered another top 10 hit, &quot;Risipitor&quot; (&quot;Wasteful&quot;).

Groza was chosen to dub the singing voice of Gloria in Happy Feet Two and Barbara Gordon in Lego Batman: The Movie.

<text>The Battle of Monocacy (also known as Monocacy Junction) was fought on July 9, 1864, about from Frederick, Maryland, as part of the Valley Campaigns of 1864 during the American Civil War. Confederate forces under Lt. Gen. Jubal A. Early defeated Union forces under Maj. Gen. Lew Wallace. The battle was part of Early&#x27;s raid through the Shenandoah Valley and into Maryland in an attempt to divert Union forces from their siege of Gen. Robert E. Lee&#x27;s army at Petersburg, Virginia.

The battle was the northernmost Confederate victory of the war. Afterward, the Union troops retreated to Baltimore, Maryland, and the Confederates continued toward Washington. But because the battle had delayed Early&#x27;s march for a day, Union reinforcements had time to get to the Union capital before the Confederates. Early launched an attack on Washington on July 12 at the Battle of Fort Stevens, but the Confederates were unsuccessful and retreated to Virginia.

==Background==
In May and June, as part of the Valley Campaigns of 1864, Union General-in-Chief Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant planned a coordinated movement of troops against Confederates in Virginia. It was during this campaign that Lt. Gen. Jubal Early&#x27;s Confederates defeated Union forces to open a path to Washington, D.C. After skirmishing with Maj. Gen. David Hunter&#x27;s men outside Lynchburg, Virginia, on June 17 and 18, Early increased his forces to nearly 16,000 men and continued to Martinsburg, West Virginia. The outnumbered Union troops had evacuated the town. On June 19, a small Union force at Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, burned the bridge across the Potomac River.

Grant reacted to Early&#x27;s raids at Martinsburg and Harpers Ferry by dispatching two brigades, about 5,000 men, from the 3rd Division of the VI Corps, under Brig. Gen. James B. Ricketts, from City Point, Virginia, to Harpers Ferry on July 5, 1864. Until Union troops arrived to defend Washington, the only Federal force between Early and the Union capital was a 2,300-man force (mostly Hundred Days Men) under the command of Maj. Gen. Lew Wallace. At the time, Wallace, who would become better known as the author of &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;, was in command of the Union&#x27;s Middle Department and VIII Corps, based in Baltimore. Few of Wallace&#x27;s men had battle experience. Although Wallace had experience as a battlefield commander, having been the Union Army&#x27;s youngest major general at the time of his promotion, his military career faltered after he was blamed for the high casualties taken on the first day at the Battle of Shiloh.

In the meantime, agents of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad at Cumberland, Maryland, and Harpers Ferry reported signs of Early&#x27;s advance on June 29. John W. Garrett, the president of the railroad and a Union supporter, passed this intelligence, and subsequent reports reached Wallace on July 3. Garrett was concerned about protecting a railroad bridge at Monocacy Junction, Maryland, where it crossed the Monocacy River. The bridge was important to rail connections at Harpers Ferry and points farther west, so Wallace agreed to bring a force to the Monocacy to protect it.

==Preparing for battle==
On July 3, acting on his own without orders from his superiors or informing them of his intentions, Wallace dispatched Brig. Gen. Erastus B. Tyler and men from the 1st Maryland Infantry and 3rd Maryland Infantry, Potomac Home Brigade, to Monocacy Junction to establish defensive positions. After Garrett&#x27;s agents reported the Confederate attack at Harpers Ferry, Wallace relayed the information to Gen. Henry Halleck, then ordered his brigades at Baltimore to be ready to move. Wallace departed for Monocacy Junction on July 4 to assess its defenses.

Uncertain whether Baltimore or Washington was the Confederate objective, Wallace knew he had to delay their approach until reinforcements could reach either city. Wallace saw Monocacy Junction, also called Frederick Junction, southeast of Frederick, as the most logical point to defend Baltimore and Washington. A plain extended north and west from the river at Monocacy Junction to the Catoctin Mountains, away. From Monocacy Junction, the B&amp;O Railroad&#x27;s bridge crossed the river at the foot of a bluff. A wooden bridge provided the Georgetown Pike access to Washington across the Monocacy River, a short distance downriver, while a stone bridge took Baltimore Pike across the Monocacy upriver. Two blockhouses, one near the junction and another on the bluff above the railroad bridge, provided additional protection. A 24-pound howitzer was installed at the blockhouse on the bluff. If Wallace could stretch his force across of the stream to protect both turnpike bridges, the railroad bridge, and several river fords, he could force Early to disclose the strength and objective of the Confederate force and delay him as long as possible.

Initially, Wallace&#x27;s forces along the river at Monocacy Junction consisted of Tyler&#x27;s brigades and a cavalry force of 230 troopers from the 8th Illinois Cavalry Regiment commanded by Lt. Col. David R. Clendenin. Wallace moved in additional troops to assist them, including the 11th Maryland, a field artillery unit, and Ohio units from Annapolis and Baltimore. Wallace&#x27;s men skirmished with Early&#x27;s cavalry west of Frederick on July 7, but later retreated toward Monocacy Junction to avoid being surrounded. Following the skirmishing on July 7 and 8, when Confederate cavalry drove Union units from Frederick, Early demanded, and received, $200,000 ransom from the city to save it from destruction.

Wallace&#x27;s prospects improved when word arrived that the first contingent of VI Corps troops, commanded by Ricketts, had reached Baltimore. Although they were originally ordered to travel by rail to Harpers Ferry, Ricketts and about 3,300 of his men arrived at Monocacy Junction, where Wallace stopped them on the evening of July 8. Ricketts agreed to remain at the Monocacy to assist Wallace. When Wallace informed Halleck that the Confederates were threatening the road to Washington, Halleck wired Grant to send reinforcements to the capital. The Union troops at Monocacy Junction would have to delay Early&#x27;s troops, who were within a two-days&#x27; march of Washington.

On Saturday, July 9, the combined forces of Wallace and Ricketts, about 6,800 men, were positioned at the bridges and fords of the river. The higher elevation of the river&#x27;s east bank formed a natural breastwork for some of the men, while Tyler&#x27;s brigade occupied the two block-houses and trenches his soldiers had dug near the bridges. Ricketts&#x27;s division occupied the Thomas and Worthington farms on the Union left, using the fences as breastworks. Confederate troop estimates ranged from 14,000 to 28,000 men, nearly double the size of the Union forces.

==Opposing forces==

==Battle==
Wallace’s objectives for the battle were simple: keep the road to Washington secure as long as possible and maintain a line of retreat for his men. On July 9, between 9 and 10 a.m., Confederate Maj. Gen. Stephen Dodson Ramseur&#x27;s division encountered about 3,500 of Rickett&#x27;s men along the bluffs overlooking the bridge where the Georgetown Pike crossed the river, while Maj. Gen. Robert E. Rodes&#x27;s division clashed with Tyler&#x27;s brigade, who were guarding the Baltimore Pike and its stone bridge across the river. Clendenin&#x27;s Union cavalry was downstream, watching the river. Prisoners taken during this phase told the Confederates that the entire VI Corps was present, which seemed to have heightened the Confederates&#x27; caution and they did not initially press their numerical advantage.

Believing that a frontal attack across the Monocacy would be too costly, Early sent Brig. Gen. John McCausland&#x27;s cavalry of about 1,100 men down Buckeystown Road to find a ford and outflank the Union line. McCausland crossed the Monocacy below the McKinney-Worthington ford, about a mile downstream from the Georgetown Pike bridge, and attacked Wallace&#x27;s left flank. Due to the rolling terrain, McCausland&#x27;s men did not notice that four regiments of Ricketts&#x27;s veteran troops had taken a position along a fence separating the Worthington and Thomas farms. Consequently, the Union line was able to fire a single volley that destroyed McCausland&#x27;s front line and panicked the remaining Confederates. McCausland rallied his brigade and launched another attack, but was unable to break the Union line and retreated.

When the cavalry could not break the Union flank on its own, Early sent Maj. Gen. John B. Gordon&#x27;s infantry division across the ford to assist in the attack. Gordon launched a three-pronged attack with three brigades against Ricketts&#x27;s center and both flanks. Ricketts&#x27;s right flank was pushed back, allowing the Confederates to enfilade the Union line. Pressure from Ramseur&#x27;s attack on the Union center and Confederate artillery fire from across the river kept Wallace from reinforcing Ricketts&#x27;s men. Unable to hold the Union line, Wallace ordered a retreat toward Baltimore, leaving Tyler&#x27;s brigade holding the stone bridge with a small force of men. Clendenin&#x27;s cavalry remained south on the Georgetown Pike as a rearguard. Rodes&#x27;s Confederate troops made one final push to capture the stone bridge about 6 p.m., but most of the Union troops were already headed toward Baltimore. At the end of the day, the outnumbered Union forces had withstood five attacks before they were forced to retreat.

==Aftermath==

By late afternoon on July 9, following this northernmost Confederate victory of the war, the Federals were retreating toward Baltimore, leaving behind more than 1,294 dead, wounded, or captured. Early&#x27;s army had won the field at Monocacy, but at the cost of an estimated 700 to 1,000 men killed or wounded and the loss of a day&#x27;s march.

Wallace telegrammed Halleck that his forces fought until 5 p.m., but the Confederate forces, which he estimated at 20,000 men, had overwhelmed them and forced a retreat. One critical objective had been accomplished: the Union troops at Monocacy Junction had delayed Early’s advance on Washington by a full day.

After hearing of the retreat, Grant, exercising his powers as general-in-chief, put Maj. Gen. E. O. C. Ord in command of Wallace’s troops. (Wallace did not learn that he had been replaced until July 11, after his forces reached Baltimore; however, he still retained responsibility for the administration of the Middle Department.) When government officials became aware of the efforts that Wallace and his men had made to save Washington, the situation changed. Wallace was restored to full command of VIII Corps and the Middle Department on July 28.

With Wallace&#x27;s retreat to Baltimore, the road lay open to Washington. On July 10 the Confederates began the march toward the Union capital. By midday on Monday, July 11, Early arrived at Fort Stevens, from where he could see the dome of the U.S. Capitol through his glasses. With his troops straggling behind him, exhausted from the heat and the long march, Early decided to delay the attack on the fort until July 12. Although artillery exchanges and skirmishes occurred on July 11, prior to the full-scale attack, Early was too late. VI Corps, the Union troops that Grant had dispatched to Washington, had already arrived and was prepared to defend the city. The Confederate infantry, reduced to 8,000 men, was unable to continue. By July 14 Early had crossed the Potomac at White&#x27;s Ferry into Virginia.

The battle at Monocacy cost Early a day&#x27;s march and his chance to capture Washington. Thwarted in the attempt to take the Union capital, the Confederates retreated into Virginia, ending their last campaign to carry the war into the North. Union forces in the area pursued Early, but due to a divided military command, they were unable to defeat him. In response, Grant formed the Middle Military Division, covering Maryland, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, the District of Columbia, and the Shenandoah Valley, to coordinate the offense against Confederate forces in the valley.

General Early wrote in a report of the 1864 campaign:
Grant assessed Wallace&#x27;s delaying tactics at Monocacy in his memoirs:
In late July, Wallace gave orders to collect the bodies of the dead and bury them on the battlefield. He also proposed a monument to be erected on the site with an inscription that would read: &quot;These men died to save the National Capital, and they did save it.&quot; (Wallace&#x27;s proposed monument was never built, but five others were erected in honor of those who died in the battle.)

==Battlefield preservation==

The battlefield remained in private hands for more than one hundred years before portions of it were acquired in the late 1970s to create the Monocacy National Battlefield. The park was dedicated in July 1991. Five monuments were erected at the site, including tributes to Union troops from New Jersey, Vermont, and Pennsylvania, as well as to the Confederate force who fought in the battle. The American Battlefield Trust and its partners have acquired and preserved 445 acres of the Monocacy battlefield as of mid-2023.

==In popular culture==
The American independent film, &quot;No Retreat from Destiny: The Battle That Rescued Washington&quot;, is a 2006 docudrama about the Battle of Monocacy.

The battle is featured in the novel &quot;Valley of the Shadow&quot; (2015) by Ralph Peters.

<doc id="1282933" wikidata="Q13897032" url="?curid=1282933" title="Jack plane">
<text>A jack plane is a general-purpose woodworking bench plane, used for dressing timber down to size in preparation for truing and/or edge jointing. It is usually the first plane used on rough stock, but for rougher work it can be preceded by the scrub plane. The versatility of the jack plane has led to it being the most common bench plane in use. The name jack plane is sometimes used interchangeably with the longer fore plane.

== Description ==

Jack planes are typically long and wide, with wooden planes sometimes being slightly wider. The blade is wide. Historically wooden jack planes in the United States have typically been long, (180 to 230 mm) long with irons wide.

Under the commonly used Stanley Bailey numbering system for metal-bodied planes the long #5 plane is a jack. However, not all early metal plane manufacturers used the same number scheme for their planes. For example Millers Fall and Sargent used different numbers to refer to the same planes.

== Name ==
The name jack plane dates back to at least the 17th century, and was a term used to describe many tools used for rough work. Being a common first name the term jack came to be used as a disdainful name for the common man, as well as common tools and jobs. The jack plane has also become associated with the related term &quot;jack of all trades&quot; as they can be adjusted to perform some of the work of both smoothing and jointer planes, especially on smaller pieces of work.

== History ==
As with other bench planes, until the end of the 19th century the bodies of jack planes were predominantly wooden, typically made out of beech (&quot;Fagus sylvatica&quot; in Europe, &quot;Fagus grandifolia&quot; in North America). Wooden planes were largely superseded by iron-bodied planes and to a lesser extent transitional planes. Although there were earlier all-metal planes, Leonard Bailey patented a number of highly influential all-metal planes and improvements in the late 19th century. Despite the predominance of the heavier iron-bodied planes, vintage wooden planes remain in common use, while new wooden jack planes are available from a small number of manufacturers.

== Use ==
The irons (blades) on jack planes are often ground with a slight camber, allowing more material to be removed without marring the work. For a finer finish, the irons can also be ground like a smoothing plane – with a straight edge and a very slight curve on the corners.

The cut is generally set deeper than on most other planes as the plane&#x27;s purpose is to rapidly remove stock rather than to gain a good finish (smoothing planes are used for that). In preparing stock, the jack plane is used after the scrub plane and before the fore plane or jointer plane and the smoothing plane.

The woodworker will often start planing across or diagonal to the grain (&quot;traversing&quot;) to roughly level the workpiece before planing in the direction of the grain.

<doc id="1282951" wikidata="Q259152" url="?curid=1282951" title="Rocío Jurado">
<text>María del Rocío Mohedano Jurado (, 18 September 1943 – 1 June 2006), better known as Rocío Jurado, was a Spanish singer and actress. She was born in Chipiona (Cádiz) and nicknamed &quot;La más grande&quot; (&quot;The Greatest&quot;).

In 2000 in New York City, she won the prize &quot;La voz del Milenio&quot; for best female voice of the 20th century. Rocío Jurado sold more than 16 million records, making her one of the best-selling Spanish female singers. She received 5 platinum and 30 gold discs.

==Childhood and youth==
Rocío Jurado was born on Calvo Soto Street #11, Chipiona (Cádiz) in Andalusia, Spain. Her father, Fernando Mohedano Crespo (died at 36 years old), was a shoemaker and flamenco singer in his spare time; her mother, Rocío Jurado Bernal (died at 52 years old because of pancreatic cancer), was housewife and amateur performer of Andalusian traditional music. Rocío Jurado was the eldest of 3 children, Gloria (1950) and Amador (1953) and she had 3 nephews and 5 nieces.

At home, Rocío Jurado learned to love music; her first public performance was at the age of eight, in a play at Colegio La Divina Pastora. She learned to work hard when she was a girl, She sang in the church, and took part in some festivals organized by her school when she was fifteen. After her father&#x27;s death, she helped with the precarious family finances. She worked as a shoemaker and as a fruit picker, and still had time to show up at Radio Sevilla contests. She came to be known as &quot;The Girl of the Awards&quot; after winning every radio station contest she entered. A friend of her mother introduced her to Manolo Caracol, her teacher.

Pastora Imperio immediately hired Rocío for the tablao (flamenco stage) she ran: El Duende, one of the first of the tablaos period. Being a minor, she had to wear clothes that made her appear older to avoid drawing the attention of the authorities.

Her workmate, the flamenco singer and dancer Cañeta de Málaga, who had also arrived in Madrid under age to seek her art and was hired in El Duende, recalls in an interview how the young Rocío sang &quot;sus alegrías, sus tientos y sus cosas de la Piquer&quot;. Rocío had always said that she was born in 1944 because when she arrived in Madrid to sing in 1960 she was a minor. Until she was 16 she could not sing in the tablaos, so she falsified her date of birth, adding two more years by saying that she was born in 1944 instead of 1946. 

== Artistic life ==
Professionally, Rocío Jurado emerged with a repertoire mostly of copla, an Andalusian traditional genre that was beginning to lose force which she revitalized with energetic performances, as much in voice as in stage presence.

Popular in the 60&#x27;s and early 70&#x27;s, in part on account of some appearances as an actress in television and film as in the Curro Jiménez series, Rocío made the leap to international stardom by adopting a melodic repertoire of romantic ballad  with orchestral instruments and a personal image (make-up, hairdressing and costumes) in accordance with the European style.

Rocío alternated the flamenco tailed dress (bata de cola) with sumptuous evening dresses, sometimes highly commented on for their audacity. In the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s Rocío recorded her most unmistakable successes: &quot;Como una ola&quot;, &quot;Señora&quot;, &quot;Como yo te amo&quot;, &quot;Ese hombre&quot;, &quot;Se nos rompió el amor&quot;, &quot;A que no te vas&quot;, &quot;Muera el amor&quot;, &quot;Vibro&quot;... Many of them composed by Manuel Alejandro and recorded by José Antonio Álvarez Alija.

The prolonged celebrity of Rocío lies in the romantic songs rather than in its purely Andalusian folkloric facet. She was famous for these ballads also in Hispano-America, where perhaps she remained in fashion for longer than in Spain, which explains her later scores with Mexican and Caribbean rhythms: &quot;Me ha dicho la luna&quot;, &quot;Te cambio mi bulería&quot;...She recorded duets with famous figures from that continent: with José Luis Rodríguez &quot;El Puma&quot; the song &quot;Amigo amor&quot; and with Ana Gabriel the ambiguous song &quot;Amor silencio&quot;. In 1990 participated in a show of tribute to Lola Flores in Miami, in which she recorded the duet &quot;Dejándonos la piel&quot;. 

Nevertheless, the romantic successes of international reach did not remove Rocío from its more Andalusian facet. The most convincing declaration of Rocío Jurado in this sense would arrive years later when already she was an outstanding interpreter of the &quot;copla&quot; and ballads. In 1982 she applied her extraordinary talents to flamenco singing in a double LP with the collaboration of two main figures of this genre: the guitarist Manolo Sanlúcar and the singer Juan Peña &quot;Lebrijano&quot;. Titled &quot;Ven &amp; Sígueme&quot;, she discovered that the famous singer also moved with ease on the roads of &quot;Cante jondo.&quot; In spite of an already well-developed lyric, the multifaceted artist demonstrates her knowledge and her compass in a series of rigorously traditional folk singing and interpreted with great affection. The filmmaker Carlos Saura took notice and used the voice of Rocío in two feature films: &quot;El amor brujo&quot; with Cristina Hoyos in 1986 and &quot;Sevillanas&quot; in 1992 where she plays with such important figures in the flamenco world as Paco de Lucía, Camarón de la Isla, Tomatito, Lola Flores, Manuela Carrasco or Matilde Coral among many others.

Rocío Jurado was one of the protagonists of the spectacle &quot;Azabache&quot;, a musical based on Andalusian copla in which she took part with other artists specialized in this genre, such as Nati Mistral, Juanita Reina, Imperio Argentina and María Vidal. They released this spectacle during the Universal Exposition of Seville in 1992 (Expo &#x27;92).

In 1998, on the occasion of the Festival of Jerez de la Frontera dedicated to flamenco dancing, the Theatre Villamarta had to announce that they were sold out for the Rocío&#x27;s gala weeks before the spectacle and before any other spectacles. An homage to the singer was made with the adaptation using &quot;bulerías&quot;, a Flamenco variety of the song &quot;Se nos rompió el amor&quot; made by Fernando de Utrera. This song was originally composed by Manuel Alejandro but it was Rocío who had made it popular.

Rocío&#x27;s voice was recognised internationally. She was awarded with the Best Female Voice of the 20th century in 2000. This award was conceded in 2000 in New York City by a group of journalists of the spectacle. In addition, in 1985, she sang for the President of the United States of America, Ronald Reagan in the White House. She was so popular that her death merited an article in the &quot;Billboard&quot; website. On 2 April 1988, Rocío received the award &quot;América&quot;, which recognised the Best Latin Voice. The ceremony took place at the Caesars Palace Casino (Las Vegas). In 2011, the Spanish media group Antena 3 released a TV Movie (mini series) about Rocío&#x27;s life titled &quot;Como alas al viento&quot;.

==Illness and death==
In August 2004, she had a high-risk surgery at the Montepríncipe Hospital (Madrid). Later on 17 September, she would announce at a press conference that she had pancreatic cancer. In June 2005, the XIV &quot;Festival de la Yerbabuena&quot; was dedicated to her at Las Cabezas de San Juan, a village from Seville. She accepted with her childhood friend Juan Peña, &quot;El Lebrijano,&quot; the award which was given to her father.

After more than a year of professional inactivity, Rocío re-appeared in December 2005, with a special programme in the Spanish Public Television (TVE) called &quot;Rocío, siempre&quot;, where she demonstrated her condition. The spectacle, which was filmed in two different sessions included an important part dedicated to the folkloric music and the other to her famous ballads and her other hits. She sang in duet some of the songs with the most famous Spanish singers: Raphael, Mónica Naranjo, Paulina Rubio, David Bisbal, Malú and others.

In January 2006, Rocío Jurado was hospitalized in the MD Anderson Hospital in Houston (Texas), for a check-up and to have a small surgery. An allergic reaction to one of the medicines provoked her hospitalization in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) twice, which delayed her return to Spain until March 2006. The same day she returned to Spain, the government gave her an award for her work merits (Medalla al Mérito en el Trabajo), which was announced to her once she landed in Spain.

On 1 June 2006, at 4:15 am, Jurado died surrounded by her close relatives in her house in La Moraleja, an affluent residential area located in the municipality of Alcobendas, a northern suburb of Madrid. The cause of death was the pancreatic cancer she had been struggling with. Her brother and manager, Amador Mohedano Jurado, announced her death in front of the residence at 6 o’clock in the morning. Her body was transferred to the Centro Cultural de la Villa at Plaza de Colón in central Madrid, where the funeral chapel was visited by over 20,000 individuals. Finally, her body was transferred to Chipiona and buried at the local San José cemetery, where a mausoleum was built in her honour.

== Private life ==
Rocío was the first main Spanish celebrity to abandon the use of typical traditional clothes and replace them with clothes from great international high couturiers and stylists, although she never forgot her origins. On 21 May 1976, when she married Spanish boxer Pedro Carrasco at the Sanctuary Virgen de Regla, she wore a traditional costume with a comb and flounces. They only had one daughter, Rocío Carrasco Mohedano. In private, she sometimes recognized that she did not have time to dedicate to her daughter; she had long tours in Latin America and Europe which separated her from her daughter. After she was divorced in July 1989 and after obtaining the marriage annulment, Rocío married bullfighter José Ortega Cano on 17 February 1995 at her house in the country Dehesa Yerbabuena, in front of over 2300 guests. The ceremony was broadcast live (and prerecorded) on the main television channels on country. At the end of 1999, the couple adopted two Colombian children, José Fernando and Gloria Camila, who were presented in public in the Spanish magazine &quot;¡Hola!&quot;.

<text>Chipiona is a town and municipality located on the Atlantic coast in the province of Cádiz, Spain. According to the 2012 census, the city has a population of 18,849 inhabitants, but this amount increases greatly during the summer holiday period. The town covers an area of 33 km2. Being in the lower valley of the River Guadalquivir it is very flat with a maximum terrestrial height of 4 metres. It is bordered on the north-west by Sanlúcar de Barrameda and on the south-east by the port of Rota.

It is the town of birth of singer Rocío Jurado and where her body now rests.

Chipiona is also home to the lighthouse Punta del Perro. The town is also well known for several varieties of Moscatel.

==Places of interest==

*The Chipiona lighthouse is the most emblematic monument of the town. It is the largest lighthouse in Spain, the 3rd in Europe and the 5th in the world. Its height from the base is about 69 meters, dates from 1867 and is located in the Punta del Perro. It was built to prevent ships having problems accessing the river Guadalquivir and colliding with the Salmedina Rocks.
*The Marina: the early 1990s saw the construction of the Marina, located near the mouth of the Guadalquivir, in 2008 it was subjected to a process of enlargement.
*The Shrine of Our Lady of Regla: The current building of the shrine dates from the early 20th century, built by the Franciscan missionary community, with the help of the Duke of Montpensier. It was originally an ancient castle fortress of a 14th-century family, Ponce de Leon, who donated it to the Hermits of St. Augustine in 1399 to convert it into a church.
*Chipiona Castle: houses the Museum of Cadiz and the New World.
*Muscat Museum: Opened in 2012. Located in the Catholic Agricultural Cooperative.

==History==
===Antiquity===
According to the geographers Strabo (Strabo, III, 1, 9) and Pomponius Mela (Mela, III, 4), of Ancient Greece and Rome respectively, a lighthouse existed at the mouth of the Guadalquivir River called Turris Caepionis. This was probably because it was built on the orders of the Roman Consul Quintus Servilius Caepion or his successors. The lighthouse marked a dangerous place for shipping and the opening of a navigable river, the Guadalquivir. Chipiona takes its name from the Roman Consul Caepion.

This area has also been identified as the site of the legendary Ars Gerionis, the tomb of Geryon, which stood at the end of a narrow cape that jutted into the sea, probably in what is now a reef known as the Stone of Salmedina, near Salmedina, or just Salmedina. These claims are based solely on the evidence of the literature and Roman archaeological findings dating from the second century B.C.

===Middle Ages===

Legend relates that the disciples of St. Augustine in Africa, fleeing the invasion of the Vandals, came by sea to Chipiona with the image of the Virgin of Regla. Tombstones have been found near the Shrine of Our Lady of Regla from the time of the Visigoths. After the islamization of the Iberian Peninsula in 711, according to tradition, the hermits hid the image in a cistern about thirty paces from the citadel, now a monastery. The picture remained hidden until a member of the Order of St. Augustine found it in the 14th century, according to legend, following a revelation from heaven. A Shrine to Our Lady of Regla was built around the cistern.

In 1251 Chipiona was conquered by King Ferdinand III, and again more definitively in 1264 by his son Alfonso X the Wise. In 1297, King Ferdinand IV granted Guzman el Bueno, founder of the House of Medina Sidonia, the Lordship of Sanlúcar, to which Chipiona belonged.

In 1303 the eldest daughter of Guzman el Bueno and Maria Alonso Coronel, Isabel Perez de Guzman, Fernan married Ponce de León, receiving as a dowry the towns of Rota and Chipiona, thereby becoming independent both of the Lordship of Sanlúcar and joining the possessions of the Ponce de León family, descendent of the Arcos House.
===Modern Age===

In 1755, Chipiona was severely hit by the tsunami that was caused by the Andalusian and Portuguese Atlantic coast Lisbon earthquake. The effects of the tsunami came to town about an hour after the earthquake, killing four people and leaving flooded streets and beaches, estimating the actual damage to 238 815.

The image of Christ of Mercy was pulled in procession to request the withdrawal of the waters, a procession that is repeated every year in November, from the chapel that bears the name of Christ to the so-called Cross of the Sea (Cruz del Mar).

Earthquake Narration by the Community of the Holy Convent of Nuestra Señora Santa María de Regla, on December 6, 1755

&quot; On the aforementioned November 1 there wasn&#x27;t any news from sunrise until 10 o&#x27;clock in the morning it was a serene and peaceful day, still and calm sea, a slight north wind. But, being as 10am, being this Community as a high choir solemnly singing the Terce, it began to feel that the choir, and the church with strange swaying motion and this, as visibly noticeable, that lectern, church lamps, candlesticks from the altar, and all the temple shook and moved like a crib, from one side to the other, as viewed from the North to the South.&quot;

&quot; We were warned that this was a terrible earthquake, and although it caused a corresponding fright in everybody, and we had the suspicion that the whole building, which [is] of stone, would collapse over us all, we lacked the freedom to leave the choir, all linked by the same superior impulse, and full of sure confidence in Patronage of Our Holy Image, which was clear to the eye on her majestic throne. At that point we bowed our knees, and straining our devotion, we continued with the canonical time more consistently.&quot;

&quot; The tremor would last for ten to twelve minutes, knowing the land had returned to be quiet, and natural stillness, the Community started to take their seats, each recognising the Divine Mercy, and the patronage of Holy Mary of Rule, Our Lady, we escaped the threatening havoc with such happiness that there is not the least harm experienced in all areas of the convent.&quot;

&quot; Cantóse conventual Mass without the least suspicion, and concluded, was sung the sixth hour on the end of it, it would be like the 11 and fourth, there was a terrible roar of the sea, and found to be elevated both waves, violently throwing water on said bastion, and on the cliffs of the convent, were overwhelmed by a gunner, who was in it (which did not suffer any damage, having invoked the patronage of Our Holy Image), and fell upon the walls of the convent, and running for their flooded trenches surrounded the Church and its 2 sides to enter through the front door of the Farm, looking to the East.&quot;

&quot; Surprised by this unanticipated boost the ocean, some religious who were outside, and within the choir, acceleration fled to the fields, keeping others in the same choir.&quot;

==Demographics==
==Festivities and traditions==

*Carnival: Carnival is a celebration with a long tradition in the municipality, the oldest documented reference to it being an 1896 City Council Edict, which regulates the proceedings and confirms that the celebration clearly dates from an earlier era. During the Franco period carnival celebrations were banned in Spain. In 1984 the institution was restored and since then the festival is held annually in the months of February and March. The festival closes with a horse parade, which is followed throughout the region
*Easter: Chipiona has two penitential brotherhoods: 
*&quot;the Sisterhood and Nazarene Brotherhood of Our Father Jesus Captive, dating from 1960. The Virgin of Sorrows is an eighteenth-century anonymous work. The Brotherhood performs penitence on the day of Holy Thursday.&quot;
*&quot;the Brotherhood Holy Christ of Mercy, which performs penitence on Good Friday. The image of Christ of Mercy has enjoyed great popular support since the Great Lisbon Earthquake of November 1755, during which the image of Christ was paraded in supplication. This event is commemorated on 1 November each year, when the image of the Holy Christ of Mercy is paraded in a procession of thanksgiving. In 2006 the Brotherhood also paraded the image of Our Lady of Piety, to whom penitence is performed on Wednesday of Holy Week.&quot;
*Pinar Pilgrimage: Pilgrimage is held on the first Sunday of June in the Pinar de la Villa, in which the Virgin of Regla del Pinar, after transferring three days previously to the Shrine of Our Lady of Regla, returns to its pinewood accompanied by horsemen, carts and the general public.
*Our Lady of Mount Carmel: The patron saint of sailors is paraded on her feast day of 16 July, being taken out to sea at noon and paraded through the seas of the Villa. During the afternoon a procession through the main streets of the town ending with a fireworks display on the beach of the Sea Cross (Cruz del Mar). 
*Evening Rule: They are dedicated to Our Lady of Regla and celebrated at the Shrine of Our Lady of Regla. Culminating with the release of Our Lady of Regla on September 8 and ending with a fireworks display on the beach of Regla.
*Halloween and Feast of All Saints: It is increasingly frequent in the evening of October 31 children go out dressed as monsters and spooks in the streets to ask for candy from door to door. On November 1, Feast of All Saints, a Thanksgiving procession of the Holy Christ of Mercy takes place to recognise the miracle performed in the Lisbon tsunami.
*Christmas: The city is decorated with Christmas lights. The Association of Bethlehem &quot;Caepionis&quot; was formed and organises many activities, such as nativity courses, making Christmas cards, a live nativity scene, a nativity scene contest or the Sermon of Christmas. Zambombás (drum bands) are traditionally organised by different neighbourhoods and village associations. On the afternoon of January 5 there is the procession of the Three Kings of the East, which since 2009 have performed a worship of the Child of God in the Plaza Pio XII.

<text>A sopaipilla, sopapilla, sopaipa, or cachanga is a kind of fried pastry and a type of quick bread served in several regions with Spanish heritage in the Americas. The word sopaipilla is the diminutive of sopaipa, a word that entered Spanish from the Mozarabic language of Al-Andalus. The original Mozarabic word &quot;Xopaipa&quot; was used to mean bread soaked in oil. The word is derived in turn from the Germanic word &quot;suppa&quot;, which meant bread soaked in liquid.

A sopaipilla is traditionally made from leavened wheat dough (or a mixture of wheat flour and masa harina) to which some shortening such as butter is added. After being allowed to rise, the dough is rolled into a sheet that is then cut into circular, square or triangular shapes, 8–10 cm in size for the longest dimension (if intended for a dessert) or 15–20 cm (if intended to be stuffed for a main course). These pieces are then deep-fried in oil, sometimes after being allowed to rise further before frying: the frying causes them to puff up, ideally forming a hollow pocket in the center.

==History==

Fried cakes have been made by humans since the development of the earliest pottery vessels that could hold oil or fat, around 5000 to 3000 BCE. In ancient times, frying cakes was a primitive substitute for baking, requiring only fire and a simple vessel. Every culture has developed some form of the dish. Sopaipilla is a version found in Latin American cuisine, Tex-Mex cuisine and the cuisine of the Southwestern United States.

==Variations==

There are yeasted and quick bread variations of sopaipillas. Some batters are enriched by the addition of pumpkin ().

===Argentina===

In Argentina, this pastry is known under other names apart from sopaipa, supaipa and sopaipilla including &quot;torta frita&quot;, &quot;kreppel&quot; (from regional German &quot;Kreppel&quot;), and &quot;chipá cuerito&quot;.

===Chile===
In Chile, sopaipillas (or sopaipas) are known to have been eaten at least since 1726. Although traditional Chilean sopaipillas made in central Chile include cooked ground pumpkin in their dough, this is typically not the case in the south. Depending if they are served as a pastry or bread Chilean sopaipillas are traditionally served with either pebre (a sauce of chili pepper, onion, garlic and coriander) or boiled in &quot;chancaca&quot; sauce (a homemade hot syrup cooked with panela, orange peel and cinnamon, and then they are called &quot;sopaipillas pasadas&quot;). They are also served with mustard, ketchup, hot butter, avocado or cheese. In Chile sopaipillas are traditionally homemade and eaten during days of heavy rain, as well as enjoying widespread popularity as street food, especially during winter. Chilean sopaipillas are round and flat, sporting holes pricked through the centre of the dough, usually by a fork.

From Chiloé Archipelago to the south, sopaipillas have rhomboid form. They are a relevant ingredient in &quot;reitimientos&quot;, a traditional feast related to rendering fats after a pig slaughter.

===Peru===
In Peru, the name for this fried pastry is &quot;cachanga&quot;, and it may be either sweet or sour. Generally prepared during breakfast time, this traditional food of the Peruvian cuisine is prepared differently depending on the region, with one of the recipes involving the usage of cinnamon. The main difference between this form of sopaipilla and the other versions is that they are larger, thinner, and more rigid.

===United States===

Sopapillas in New Mexican cuisine are pillow-shaped fried pastry dough, distinct from Latin American variations. Similar to Native American frybread, they are typically served as a bread, and used to mop up sauces, scoop up tidbits, dab up flavors, or are shredded into stews. It has been called &quot;the doughnut of the Southwest&quot;, while other authors have said &quot;this non-yeasted, simply flavored bread is definitely not a donut, but it&#x27;s not really a fritter either&quot;.

In New Mexico, they are often filled with savory ingredients such as ground beef or chicken, covered with chile and cheese, and served with lettuce and tomato as an entree. They are also eaten as a dessert, drizzled with honey or anise syrup.

Sopaipillas in Tex-Mex cuisine are a puffed pastry, but otherwise similar to New Mexican-style sopaipillas, except that they are always served as a dessert item, coated with cinnamon sugar and served with honey. Many Tex-Mex restaurants in Texas and Oklahoma will serve dessert sopaipillas as part of the complimentary &quot;set-up&quot;: chips and salsa served before the meal, along with sometimes queso sauce, pickled vegetables and flour tortillas and sopaipillas served at the end of the meal.

Sopaipilla and strudel were together designated as Texas&#x27; state pastries from 2003 to 2005.

===Uruguay===
In Uruguay, a variant of the sopaipilla is known as torta frita. Tortas fritas are made of flour, salt and water and shortened with cow fat, stretched into a thin large shaped dough (20-25 cm) and deep fried in cow fat. They are usually salty, but it is a common custom to cover them with sugar or quince cheese and eat them as a snack.
They are commonly prepared on rainy days.

<doc id="1282996" wikidata="Q3602899" url="?curid=1282996" title="&quot;A&quot; Is for Alibi">
<text>&quot;A&quot; Is for Alibi is the first mystery novel in Sue Grafton&#x27;s &quot;Alphabet&quot; series, and was published by Holt, Rinehart and Winston in 1982. Featuring sleuth Kinsey Millhone, it is set in the southern California city of Santa Teresa, the &quot;nom de plume&quot; for Santa Barbara. She wrote the book during a divorce and admits about her husband that she &quot;would lie in bed at night thinking of ways to kill him&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave the book a lukewarm review.

==Plot summary==
Kinsey Millhone, a private detective, investigates the death of a prominent divorce lawyer Laurence Fife. His murder eight years earlier was blamed on his wife, Nikki Fife. Upon being released from prison, Nikki hires Kinsey to find the real murderer. In the course of the investigation, Kinsey becomes involved with Charlie Scorsoni, the late Mr. Fife&#x27;s former law partner. She discovers Fife&#x27;s death has been linked to that of a woman in Los Angeles, his law firm&#x27;s accountant; both died after taking poisonous oleander capsules, which had been substituted for allergy pills. Kinsey tracks down the accountant&#x27;s parents and former boyfriend. She then goes to Las Vegas to interview Fife&#x27;s former secretary, Sharon Napier, who is killed minutes before Kinsey arrives. Back in California, Kinsey is mystified that Nikki&#x27;s son, Colin, recognizes Laurence&#x27;s first wife, Gwen, in a photograph. Kinsey surmises that Gwen was having an affair with her ex-husband at the time of his death. She accuses Gwen, who confesses. Shortly afterwards, she too is dead, killed in a hit-and-run crash.

Kinsey has solved the case she was hired to investigate; but in a plot twist, she discovers that her previous notions about the accountant&#x27;s death were entirely wrong: in fact, it was Scorsoni who killed her when she discovered he was skimming dividend money from estate accounts under his management. Scorsoni used the same method that Gwen used to kill Fife, so it would be assumed the same person committed both murders. In a final confrontation, he chases Kinsey across the beach, armed with a knife. Kinsey hides in the shore line, and she is forced to remove her shoes and pants. Before Scorsoni can kill her, she shoots him dead.

A secondary storyline involves Millhone&#x27;s surveillance of Marcia Threadgill, suspected of insurance fraud in a trip-and-fall case. Although Millhone believes she has successfully documented Threadgill&#x27;s deception, the insurance firm that contracted Millhone to investigate Threadgill moves to pay her claim anyway, citing potential legal costs and complications, including the risk of reprisal.

==Publication history==
The first printing of &quot;&quot;A&quot; Is for Alibi&quot; was 7,500 copies, with initial sales of about 6,000.

==Critical analysis==
Grafton openly admits that she conceived the story from her own &quot;fantasies&quot; of murdering her husband while going through a divorce.

The novel&#x27;s style typical hardboiled detective fiction, according to the authors of &quot;&#x27;G&#x27; is for Grafton&quot;, who describe it as &quot;laconic, breezy, wise-cracking&quot;. Grafton frames the narrative as a report Kinsey Millhone writes during the course of her investigation, written in the first-person narrative.

&quot;&quot;A&quot; for Alibi&quot; is dedicated to author Chip Grafton, Sue Grafton&#x27;s father, &quot;who set me on this path&quot;. Chip Grafton was a municipal bond attorney in Kentucky who pursued a secondary career as a crime novelist, winning minor acclaim for four novels. He died on January 31, 1982 at age 72, four months before &quot;&#x27;A&#x27; is for Alibi&quot; was published.

==Reviews==
Writing when the book was released, &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; said this was a &quot;shakily plotted but otherwise terrific start for a new detective series&quot;. The reviewer looked forward to the rest of the Alphabet Series, &quot;fine dialogue, a great eye for people and places&quot;, if the author can tighten up her plots.

Looking back at the series soon after the author&#x27;s death, &quot;Library Journal Reviews&quot; remarked on the slow build up to successful reviews, including a quote from its own review: &quot;Critic Sarah Weinman notes that pseudonymous New York Times critic Newgate Callendar dismissed &quot;A Is for Alibi&quot; as &quot;competent enough, but not particularly original.&quot; Alas, LJ&#x27;s reviewer was equally unenthusiastic in an April 1, 1982, review, waving the book aside as &quot;nothing to take it out of the ordinary.&quot; Before those less enthusiastic words, they had said, &quot;The female detective is well drawn and the plot moves at a fast clip&quot;.

<text>Sweden Rock Festival is a rock festival outside the town of Sölvesborg in Blekinge in southern Sweden. The festival offers the best possible mix of classic rock, hard rock, metal, blues and related genres.

The first version of the festival, known as Sommarfestivalen i Olofström, was held in Olofström in 1992. In 1993 the festival moved to Karlshamn, and changed its name to Karlshamn Rock Festival. In 1998, the festival moved to Norje, although the name Karlshamn Rock Festival was kept. In 1999 the name was changed to the Sweden Rock Festival.

When the festival began in 1992, it featured nine relatively unknown bands and it only lasted one day. The next year the festival was expanded to two days and more bands were added to the line-up. From 1993 to 2002 the festival would last two days; over those years it would also begin to feature bigger name acts. In 2000 the festival was expanded to three days but it returned to two days the following year.

From 2003 to 2006 the festival lasted three days and had by then featured some of the biggest acts. From 2007 the festival has been expanded to four days and will feature approximately 120 different bands/artists.

Some notable appearances in the past have been Aerosmith, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Mötley Crüe, Dio, Bruce Dickinson, Yngwie Malmsteen, Twisted Sister, Whitesnake, Uriah Heep, Europe, Deep Purple, Accept, Motörhead, Saxon, Nazareth, Poison, Status Quo, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Scorpions, Porcupine Tree, Kamelot, Def Leppard, Alice Cooper, Testament, W.A.S.P, ZZ Top, The Orchestra, Thin Lizzy, Ted Nugent, Slayer and Guns N&#x27; Roses.

The festival has also worked as a comeback scene for bands like Triumph and &quot;Thundersteel&quot; line-up Riot.

Bachman &amp; Turner started their world reunion tour here in June 2010. In 2013 both Rush and Kiss together with Europe were headliners for the festival.

The COVID-19 pandemic caused the festival to be cancelled in 2020 and 2021.

<text>The guard is a ground grappling position in which one combatant has their back to the ground while attempting to control the other combatant using their legs. In pure grappling combat sports, the guard is considered an advantageous position, because the bottom combatant can attack with various joint locks and chokeholds, while the top combatant&#x27;s priority is the transition into a more dominant position, a process known as passing the guard. In the sport of mixed martial arts, as well as hand-to-hand combat in general, it is possible to effectively strike from the top in the guard, even though the bottom combatant exerts some control. There are various types of guard, with their own advantages and disadvantages.

The guard is a key part of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu where it can be used as an offensive position. It is also used, but not formally named, in Judo though it is sometimes referred to as &quot;dō-osae&quot; in Japanese, meaning &quot;trunk hold&quot;. It is called the &quot;front body scissor&quot; in catch wrestling.

==Pulling Guard==
Transitioning directly from standing to the guard position is known as pulling guard. Tsunetane Oda, a judo groundwork specialist who died in 1955, demonstrated the technique on video.

==Closed Guard==

Sometimes referred to as full guard, the closed guard is the typical guard position. In this guard the legs are hooked behind the back of the opponent, preventing them from standing up or moving away. The opponent needs to open the legs up to be able to improve positioning. The bottom combatant might transit between the open and closed guard, as the open guard allows for better movement, but also has a bigger risk of the opponent passing the guard.
== Half Guard ==
Half guard is a position where the guard player wraps both of their legs around one of their opponent&#x27;s legs. The half guard can favour the passer or the guard player, depending on the many details of the position such as body positioning and grips. The position affords many options for the guard player to initiate techniques such as sweeps and submission holds. 

Variants of half guard include the deep half guard, the Z-guard and the reverse De La Riva guard.
==Open Guard==

The open guard is typically used to perform various joint locks and chokeholds. The legs can be used to move the opponent, and to create leverage. The open guard allows the opponent to stand up or try to pass the guard, so this position is often used only temporarily to set up sweeps or other techniques. Open guard is also a general term that encompasses a large number of guard positions where the legs are used to push, wrap or hook the opponent without locking the ankles together around them.
===Butterfly Guard===
The butterfly guard involves both of the legs being hooked with the ankles in between the opponents legs, against the inside of the opponents thighs. The opponent is controlled using both legs and arms. The leverage in the butterfly guard allows powerful sweeps. The guard also allows one to elevate or set the opponent off balance and because of this it is particularly useful in avoiding damage and allows transitions to other dominant positions. The analogous technique in wrestling and catch wrestling is called double elevator.

===X-Guard===
The X-guard is an open guard where one of the combatants is standing up and the other is on their back. The bottom combatant uses the legs to entangle one of the opponent&#x27;s legs, which creates opportunities for powerful sweeps. The X-guard is often used in combination with butterfly and half guard. In a grappling match, this is an advantageous position for the bottom combatant, but in general hand-to-hand combat, the top combatant can attack with stomps or soccer kicks. Likewise, skilled use of the x-guard can prevent the opponent from attempting a kick, or throw them off balance should they raise a leg. The x-guard was developed by Alexandre &quot;Gigi&quot; Paiva [in the 1990&#x27;s,?] and popularized by Marcelo Garcia.
===Spider Guard===
The spider guard comprises a number of positions all of which involve controlling the opponents arms while using the soles of the feet to control the opponent at the biceps, hips, thighs or a combination of them. It is most effective when the sleeves of the opponent can be grabbed. The spider guard can be used for sweeps and to set up joint locks or chokeholds.
=== De La Riva Guard===

The De La Riva guard (also called jello guard) is an open guard popularized by Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioner Ricardo De La Riva, who was successful with it in competition. The guard consists of one of the legs wrapped behind the opponent&#x27;s leg from the outside, the ankle held with one hand, and the other hand grips one of their sleeves. The De La Riva guard offers a number of sweeps, transitions and submissions, and is more recently used in combination with spider guard.
===Rubber Guard===
The rubber guard is a position that keeps an opponent down in your guard. The position was used by Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioner Nino Schembri and popularized and made into a system by Eddie Bravo. Many techniques have been developed from this position including sweeps, submissions, and striking defense. By using a leg to hold an opponent down, one arm is free to work on submissions, sweeps or to strike the opponent&#x27;s trapped head.
===50-50 Guard===

The 50-50 (Fifty-fifty) guard is a position popularized by Roberto “Gordo” Correa and extensively used by the Mendes Brothers, Rafael and Guilherme Mendes, Bruno Frazzato, Ryan Hall and Ramon Lemos from the Atos Jiu-Jitsu Team. In other grappling systems such as catch wrestling and Sambo, it is a form of the &quot;outside leg triangle&quot; type of leg control. In this position, the fighter on the bottom crosses a triangle on the opponent&#x27;s leg, which allows for the leg to be dominated while leaving the arms free to work on sweeps and submissions. This position has been heavily criticized for use in competitions with restricted use of leglocks due to the potential of stalling a match when the fighter on top cannot pass the guard and the fighter on the bottom cannot successfully perform a sweep.

==Passing the Guard==
In order to overcome the primary defense of one&#x27;s opponent, their guard, and attain a more dominant position, such as side mount, full mount, or knee on stomach a practitioner must pass the guard. There are several ways of doing so; many involve pain compliance whereby the practitioner persuades the opponent to release their guard through an abrasive action. Examples of this type of action would be digging the practitioner&#x27;s forearms into the inner thigh of the opponent, standing and attempting a &quot;can opener&quot; neck crank, or in the case of a mixed martial arts setting, to simply strike the opponent until the guard is released. Passing the guard however has perils of its own, as it has a tendency to leave the practitioner particularly vulnerable to counterattack in the form of sweeps and submissions.

===Simple guard pass===
Simple guard pass also known as the arm/leg pull is a guard pass demonstrated in &quot;The Essence Of Judo&quot; by Kyuzo Mifune, and it is an unnamed technique described in &quot;The Canon Of Judo&quot;. In Brazilian Jiu Jitsu this pass is commonly referred to as the Toreando/Bull Fighter Pass. The main characteristic of the pass is the practitioner side-stepping around the opponent&#x27;s legs whilst simultaneously pulling aside the opponent&#x27;s leg or pinning the opponents legs to the ground.

=== Stacking guard pass ===
Stacking Guard Pass is also demonstrated in The Essence Of Judo by Mifune, and it is also an unnamed technique described in &quot;The Canon Of Judo.&quot; The main characteristic of the technique is the practitioner lifting the opponent and stacking them, into a possible neck crank or blood choke submission, when the practitioner is in the opponent&#x27;s open guard.

===Near knee guard pass===
Near Knee Guard Pass is also demonstrated in The Essence Of Judo by Mifune as well as Canon of Judo by Mifune. In Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, this guard pass is commonly referred to as the Knee Over Pass. The main characteristic of this pass is the practitioner driving their knee over the opponent&#x27;s same side thigh while in the opponent&#x27;s open guard.

<doc id="1283013" wikidata="Q951670" url="?curid=1283013" title="Spalax">
<text>Spalax is a genus of rodent in the family Spalacidae, subfamily Spalacinae (blind mole-rats). It is one of two extant genera in the subfamily Spalacinae, alongside &quot;Nannospalax&quot;.&quot;&quot;

Species in this genus are found in eastern Europe and western &amp; central Asia. They are completely blind and have a subterranean lifestyle.

== Taxonomy ==
Prior to 2013, &quot;Spalax&quot; was widely considered the only member of Spalacinae, with all blind mole-rat species being grouped within it. However, phylogenetic and morphological evidence supported some of the species within it forming a distinct lineage that diverged from the others during the Late Miocene, when a marine barrier formed between Anatolia and the Balkans. These species were reclassified into the genus &quot;Nannospalax&quot;, making &quot;Spalax&quot; one of two extant spalacine genera.&quot;&quot;

==Species of genus &quot;Spalax&quot; ==

*Mehely&#x27;s blind mole-rat&quot;, S. antiquus&quot;
*Sandy blind mole-rat, &quot;S. arenarius&quot;
*Giant blind mole-rat, &quot;S. giganteus&quot;
*Bukovina blind mole-rat, &quot;S. graecus&quot;
*Oltenia blind mole-rat, &quot;S. istricus&quot; (possibly extinct)
*Greater blind mole-rat, &quot;S. microphthalmus&quot;
*Kazakhstan blind mole-rat, &quot;S. uralensis&quot;
*Podolsk blind mole-rat, &quot;S. zemni&quot;

<doc id="1283016" wikidata="Q4734817" url="?curid=1283016" title="Alpenrose Dairy">
<text>Alpenrose Dairy is a dairy and home delivery company located in the Hayhurst neighborhood of southwest Portland, Oregon, since 1916. It was owned by the Cadonau family for several generations until being sold to Smith Brothers Farms, a family-owned dairy located in Kent, Washington, in August 2019. 

The brand was named after the alpine rose (&quot;Rosa pendulina&quot;) by the Swiss-born wife and early co-owner of the dairy. Alpenrose is a &quot;supplier of dairy products to retail, wholesale and ingredient customers in Portland and throughout the Northwest&quot;. In 2020, addressing the growing demand for delivery services the company introduced Alpenrose Home Delivery, a weekly grocery delivery service that provides customers with Alpenrose brand dairy products and other locally-made grocery items. Deliveries are facilitated by the company&#x27;s fleet of milkmen and milkwomen, who deliver groceries by neighborhood and are unique to the service.

The grounds of the dairy include:
*Circuit d&#x27;Alpenrose, a velodrome, one of only 25 such tracks in the United States. The track was built to host the 1967 National Championships. At 268.43 meters around with a radius and a 43-degree bank, Alpenrose is one of the steepest velodromes in the country. Alpenrose is home to the only North American Six-day race. It hosts races all summer, and annually draws the largest velodrome crowd in North America for the Alpenrose Challenge, in mid-July.

*Alpenrose Field, the site of baseball and softball games, including Little League Softball World Series games, from 1956 to 2019.
*Dairyville, a replica of a western frontier town, with false-front shops, a doll museum, an ice cream parlor, a harness-maker&#x27;s store, a music shop, and a 600-seat opera house with a pipe organ (with 4000 pipes).
*A quarter-midget racing arena.

Products from Alpenrose include milk, ice cream, eggs, and various cultured dairy products.

== Dairyville ==

Dairyville was added to Alpenrose sometime in the 1960s. As stated above, the replica frontier town consists of a few streets of false front stores, a doll museum, an ice cream parlor, a music shop and a 600-seat opera house. The theater&#x27;s pipe organ was salvaged from the Portland Civic Auditorium. Dairyville is typically open to the public on holidays and during the summer months.

For decades, Dairyville has hosted an annual holiday event called &quot;Christmas in Dairyville&quot;. In addition to a gift shop and a house where children can have their photos taken with Santa Claus, there&#x27;s also &quot;Storybook Lane&quot;, an elaborate, walk-through attraction. Visitors wander through a snowy, moonlit mock-village inhabited by farm animals and displays based on Mother Goose&#x27;s fables. The attraction also includes a tiny fire station for kids to play in. Elsewhere on the property, choir groups from local schools perform. Dairyville&#x27;s opera house also hosts nightly screenings of comedy shorts featuring The Three Stooges and Laurel and Hardy, along with more contemporary entertainment like the 2004 film adaptation of &quot;The Polar Express&quot;. The event ended its annual run in 2005 but returned again for the 2011 Christmas season.

Dairyville&#x27;s assets were auctioned off in 2020 and several of the items remain in the public view. Some of the iconic red/gold carriages pulled by miniature horses in parades were bought and restored by Nob Hill Christmas Historical Society and now walk in the annual Starlight Parade, in addition several rows of seats from the Theater and reels of film from the Theater are publicly made available in Christmas time at the Nob Hill storage facility to enjoy a short from Shirley Temple or 3 Stooges . The Calliope that clown Rusty Nails would walk with in the Parade was bought by the son of the wagons original builder. Later in 2021 it was sold to a local collector to be preserved and displayed locally. The houses from Storybook Lane were bought by 2 parties, one private collector in Sandy Oregon as well as the Nob Hill Christmas Historical Society. 

== Lawsuit ==
On March 4, 2019, a lawsuit was filed in Multnomah County Circuit Court by three members of the Cadonau family against two other family members, alleging they are planning to sell the dairy and immediately stop all community events at Alpenrose. The family has since settled differences and dropped the lawsuit.
In February 2021 the property was closed to events and all other uses.

== Future Development ==
Lennar Northwest, Inc, represented by Westlake Consultants, Inc. submitted a &quot;preapplication concept&quot; for developing the Alpenrose property. The application &quot;proposes a 193-lot single-family detached residential land division&quot;.

The proposal includes:

* Pre-application project summary. 
* Land Division Preapplication Meeting -- Applicant Questions (May 18, 2021)
* Land Division Preapplication Concept (map)
* Early Assistance application
* Notice of a Pre-Application Conference (held June 17, 2021)
* Pre-Application Conference report (dated August 4, 2021)

<text>Keres (), also Keresan (), is a Native American language, spoken by the Keres Pueblo people in New Mexico. Depending on the analysis, Keres is considered a small language family or a language isolate with several dialects. If it is considered a language isolate, it would be the most widely spoken language isolate within the borders of the United States. The varieties of each of the seven Keres pueblos are mutually intelligible with its closest neighbors. There are significant differences between the Western and Eastern groups, which are sometimes counted as separate languages.

==Classification==
Keres is now considered a language isolate. In the past, Edward Sapir grouped it together with a Hokan–Siouan stock. Morris Swadesh suggested a connection with Wichita. Joseph Greenberg grouped Keres with Siouan, Yuchi, Caddoan, and Iroquoian in a superstock called Keresiouan. None of these proposals has been validated by subsequent linguistic research.

=== Internal classification ===
In 2007, there was an estimate total of 10,670 speakers.
* Keres
** Eastern Keres: total of 4,580 speakers (1990 census)
*** Cochiti Pueblo &quot;Kotyit dialect&quot;: 600 speakers (2007)
*** San Felipe Pueblo &quot;Katishtya dialect&quot;: 2,340 speakers (2007)
***Kewa Pueblo (formally Santo Domingo Pueblo) &quot;Kewa dialect&quot;: 2,850 speakers (2007)
*** Zia Pueblo &quot;Ts&#x27;ia dialect&quot;: 500 speakers (2007)
*** Santa Ana Pueblo &quot;Tamaiya dialect&quot;: 390 speakers (2007)
** Western Keres: total of 3,391 speakers (1990 census)
*** Acoma Pueblo &quot;Áakʼu dialect&quot;: 1,930 speakers (2007)
*** Laguna Pueblo &quot;Kawaika dialect&quot;: 2,060 speakers (2007)
==Phonology==
Keresan has between 42 and 45 consonant sounds, and around 40 vowel sounds, adding up to a total of about 85 phonemes, depending on the analysis and the language variety. Based on the classification in the World Atlas of Language Structures, Keres is a language with a &quot;large&quot; consonant inventory.

The great number of consonants relates to the three-way distinction between voiceless, aspirated and ejective consonants (e.g. /t tʰ tʼ/), and to the larger than average number of fricatives (i.e. /s sʼ ʂ ʂʼ ʃ ʃʼ h/) and affricates, the latter also showing the three-way distinction found in stops.

The large number of vowels derives from a distinction made between long and short vowels (e.g. /e eː/), as well as from the presence of tones and voicelessness. Thus, a single vowel quality may occur with seven distinct realizations: /é è e̥ éː èː êː ěː/, all of which are used to distinguish words in the language.

===Consonants===
The chart below contains the consonants of the proto-Keresan (or pre-Keresan) from Miller &amp; Davis (1963) based on a comparison of Acoma, Santa Ana, and Santo Domingo, as well as other features of the dialects compiled from &quot;The Language of Santa Ana Pueblo&quot; (1964), &quot;Kansas Working Papers in Linguistics&quot; (1987), and &quot;The Phonemes of Keresan&quot; (1946), and the &quot;Grammar of Laguna Keres&quot; (2005).

===Vowels===
Keresan vowels have a phonemic distinction in duration: all vowels can be long or short. Additionally, short vowels can also be voiceless. The vowel chart below contains the vowel phonemes and allophones from the information of the Keresan languages combined from &quot;The Language of Santa Ana Pueblo&quot; (1964), &quot;The Phonemes of Keresan&quot; (1946), and Kansas Working Papers in Linguistics (1987).

Notes:
* Western Keres does not have phonemic /oː/ or /o/, though both vowels may occur phonetically. Eastern Keres words containing /o/ show /au/ in Western Keres. For instance, the first vowel in the word-sentence &quot;Sraúka̠cha̠&quot; – “I see you”:
** Kotyit Keres: [ʂóːkʰɑ̥tʃʰɑ̥]
** Kʼawaika Keres: [ʂɑ̌ukʰɑ̥tʃʰɑ̥]

==== Voiceless vowels ====
All Keresan short vowels may be devoiced in certain positions. The phonemic status of these vowels is controversial. Maring (1967) considers them to be phonemes of Áákʼu Keres, whereas other authors disagree. There are phonetic grounds for vowel devoicing based on the environment they occur, for instance word-finally, but there are also exceptions. Vowels in final position are nearly always voiceless and medial vowels occurring between voiced consonants, after nasals and ejectives are nearly always voiced.
* Word-final devoicing: &quot;because&quot;
* Word-medial devoicing: &quot;white paint&quot;

===Tones===
Acoma Keres has four lexical tones: high, low, falling and rising. Falling and rising tones only occur in long vowels and voiceless vowels bear no tones:

===Syllable structure===

Most Keresan syllables take a CV(V) shape. The maximal syllable structure is CCVVC and the minimal syllable is CV. In native Keresan words, only a glottal stop /ʔ/ ⟨ʼ⟩ can close a syllable, but some loanwords from Spanish have syllables that end in a consonant, mostly a nasal (i.e. /m n/ but words containing these sequences are rare in the language.

Due to extensive vowel devoicing, several Keresan words may be perceived as ending in consonants or even containing consonant clusters.
* Word-internal cluster: &quot;yʼâakạ srûunị&quot; ‘stomach’ /jˀɑ̂ːkḁʂûːni/ &gt; [jɑ̂ːkḁʂûːni] ~ [jɑ̂ːkʂûːni]
* Word-final coda: &quot;úwàakạ&quot; ‘baby’; /úwɑ̀ːkḁ/ &gt; [úwɑ̀ːkʰḁ] ~ [úwɑ̀ːkʰ]

==== Phonotactics ====
The only sequence of consonants (i.e. consonant cluster) that occurs in native Keresan words is a sequence of a fricative /ʃ ʂ/ and a stop or affricate. Clusters are restricted to beginnings of syllables (i.e. the syllable onset). When the alveolo-palatal consonant /ʃ/ occurs as C1, it combines with alveolar and palatal C2, whereas the retroflex alveolar /ʂ/ precedes bilabial and velar C2s, which suggest a complementary distribution. Consonant clusters may occur both word-initially and word-medially.

== Orthography ==
Traditional Keresan beliefs postulate that Keres is a sacred language that must exist only in its spoken form. The language&#x27;s religious connotation and years of persecution of Pueblo religion by European colonizers may also explain why no unified orthographic convention exists for Keresan. However, a practical spelling system has been developed for Laguna (Kʼawaika) and more recently for Acoma (Áakʼu) Keres, both of which are remarkably consistent.

In the Keres spelling system, each symbol represents a single phoneme. The letters ⟨c q z f⟩ and sometimes also ⟨v⟩ are not used. Digraphs represent both palatal consonants (written using a sequence of C and ⟨y⟩), and retroflex consonants, which are represented using a sequence of C and the letter ⟨r⟩. These graphemes used for writing Western Keres are shown between ⟨...⟩ below.

=== Consonant symbols ===
==== Signage at Acoma Pueblo ====
Signs at Acoma Pueblo sometimes use special diacritics for ejective consonants that differ from the symbols above, as shown in the table:


=== Vowel symbols ===
Vowel sounds are represented straightforwardly in the existing spellings for Keresan. Each vowel sound is written using a unique letter or digraph (for long vowels and diphthongs). However, there are two competing representations for the vowel /ɨ/. Some versions simply use the IPA ⟨ɨ⟩ whereas others use the letter ⟨v⟩ (the sound /v/ as in &quot;veal&quot; does not occur in Keresan). Voiceless vowels have also been represented in two ways; either underlined or with a dot below (see table).

==== Diacritics for tone ====
Tone may or may not be represented in the orthography of Keresan. When represented, four diacritics may be used above the vowel. Unlike the system used for Navajo, diacritics for tone are not repeated in long vowels. 
=== Keres orthography and alphabetical order ===
Although Keresan is not normally written, there exists one dictionary of the language in which words are listed in any given order. In this dictionary of Western Keres, digraphs count as single letters, although ejective consonants are not listed separately; occurring after their non-ejective counterparts. The symbol for the glottal stop ⟨ʼ⟩, for long vowels (e.g. ⟨aa ee ii⟩ etc.) are not treated as separate letters.
Letters〈f q x z〉are not used to write Keres, whereas the letters ⟨ɨ o v⟩ are only used in some dialects.

== Morphosyntax ==
Keresan is a split-ergative language in which verbs denoting states (i.e. stative verbs) behave differently from those indexing actions, especially in terms of the person affixes they take. This system of argument marking is based on a split-intransitive pattern, in which subjects are marked differently if they are perceived as actors than from when they are perceived as undergoers of the action being described.

The morphology of Keresan is mostly prefixing, although suffixes and reduplication also occur. Keresan distinguishes nouns, verbs, numerals and particles as word classes. Nouns in Keresan do not normally distinguish case or number, but they can be inflected for possession, with distinct constructions for alienable and inalienable possession. Other than possession, Keresan nouns show no comprehensive noun classes.

=== Word order ===
Keresan is a verb-final language, though word order is rather flexible.

==== Negation ====
Negation is doubly marked in Keresan. In addition to the adverb &quot;dzaadi&quot;, verbs index negation through a suffix (e.g. &quot;-u&quot;).
* &quot;Gukacha&quot; &#x27;S/he saw her/him&#x27;
* Dzaadi gukachau &#x27;S/he didn&#x27;t see her/him&#x27;

=== Verbal morphology ===
The verb is a central grammatical category in Keres, conveying the most information about events in communicative acts. Through its morphemes, Keresan verbs code not only person and number of the initiator of the action (e.g. “Tammy drinks decaf”) as is common in Indo-European languages, but also how the initiator is implicated in the action. For instance, the three verbs that describe Tammy&#x27;s actions in “Tammy kicked the ball” vs. “Tammy jumped” vs. “Tammy sneezed” require different levels of effort from Tammy, that is when &quot;kicking&quot; vs. &quot;jumping&quot; vs. &quot;sneezing&quot;.

Additionally, the person and number of the undergoer of the action are all coded on the verb (e.g. the word &quot;gukacha&quot; means “S/he sees her/him”, a full sentence in English). The ways the speaker assesses the action (i.e. evidentiality, as in “I think Tammy arrived from class” vs. “Tammy arrived from class”). Finally, the internal temporal structure of the action (i.e. aspect, as in “Tammy was sneezing in class” vs. “Tammy sneezed in class”) is also coded in Keresan verbs.

According to Maring (1967), the Keresan verb is organized around the following grammatical categories (pp. 39–40)

* Subject/Object relations
** &quot;Subject of intransitive verbs:&quot; marked by a prefix that distinguishes 3-4 persons in the singular (see below).
** &quot;Subject of transitive verbs:&quot; marked by a prefix that distinguishes 3-4 persons in the singular (see below).
** &quot;Object of transitive verbs:&quot; marked by a prefix that combines with the subject prefix, or by a suffix
* Number relations
** &quot;Singular:&quot; usually marked by a prefix
** &quot;Dual:&quot; can be marked by a prefix, partial reduplication or by suffixes
** &quot;Plural:&quot; can be marked by a prefix, partial reduplication, by suffixes or by suppletive stem forms (i.e. singular and plural forms are not related etymologically)
* Temporal relations
** &quot;Future:&quot; is marked on the verb by a series of prefixes that also encode number
* Modality relations
** &quot;Indicative&quot;
** &quot;Dubitative&quot;
** &quot;Hortative&quot;
*** &quot;Negative hortative&quot;
** &quot;Negative&quot;
*** &quot;Future negative&quot;
* Voice relations
** &quot;Active&quot;
** &quot;Passive&quot;
** &quot;Reflexive&quot;
** &quot;Reciprocal&quot;
* Aspect
** &quot;Imperfective&quot;
** &quot;Inceptive&quot;
** &quot;Repetitive&quot;
** &quot;Continuative&quot;
** &quot;Habitual&quot;
** &quot;Inchoative&quot;
** &quot;Perfective&quot;

==== The verbal prefix ====
In Keres, the verbal prefix carries information from five different grammatical categories: argument role, modality, polarity, person and number. That is, a single Keresan verb prefix codes who initiated the action and how implicated that entity is (the subject/case), whom underwent the effects of the action (the direct object), the speaker&#x27;s assessment of the action (the modality) and whether it occurred or not (polarity). On the other hand, information about when the action took place (i.e. tense) is expressed elsewhere in a clause, mostly by adverbs.

===== Number =====
Keresan verbs distinguish three numbers: singular, dual (two entities) and plural (more than two entities); and four persons: first (the speaker), second (the hearer), third (a known, definite or salient entity being talked about) and fourth (a non-salient, unknown or indefinite entity being talked about, also known as obviative) persons. The plural and dual forms are often marked by reduplication of part of the stem (gukacha&quot; ‘s/he saw it’ vs guʼukacha&quot; ‘the two of them saw it’).

===== Argument role =====
Languages encode two main types of actions: those in which the main participant initiates an action that produces change in an object (e.g. &quot;kick a ball, buy a gift, cook a dish, read a book&quot;); and those in which the action produces no (perceived) change in the world or that have no object (&quot;sneezing, breathing, growing, diving&quot;, etc.). Actions that take an object are encoded by transitive verbs, whereas those that take no object are expressed via intransitive verbs.

====== Intransitive verbs ======
In Indo-European languages like English, all intransitive verbs behave similarly (‘They sneeze/breathe/dive/think’/etc.). In Keresan, actions that take no object are conceptualized in two distinct ways depending on how the initiator of the action is implicated. More active-like intransitive verbs (e.g. ‘to sneeze’) are coded through one set of morphemes, whereas actions conceptualized as involving the initiator at a lesser degree (e.g. ‘to believe’) are coded using a separate set of prefixes.

Ideas expressed in Indo-European languages with adjectives are most often encoded by verbs in Keresan. That is, in Keresan one express the idea in the sentence ‘He is selfish’ by saying something along the lines of ‘He &quot;selfishes&quot;’. In such “actions”, the entity that is characterized by them is not implicated in the action directly (i.e. it&#x27;s beyond their control), and thus belong in the Inactive intransitive category. The different sets of prefixes are shown below:

====== Transitive verbs ======

=== Aspect ===
Aspect in Keresan is signalled by suffixes.

=== Time (tense) adverbials ===
The category of tense is expressed in Keresan via adverbs that indicate when the action about which one is speaking took place.

== Lexicon ==
New words are coined through a number of roots that are combined to pre-existing ones. Compounding is a common strategy for word building, although derivation also occurs.

=== Numerals ===
The Keresan numeral system is a base 10 system. Numerals 11–19, as well as those between the multiple of tens, are formed by adding the word &quot;kʼátsi&quot; (/ kʼátsʰɪ / &#x27;ten&#x27;) &quot;f&quot;ollowed by the word &quot;dzidra (&quot;/tsɪtʂa/ &#x27;more&#x27;). Numerals 20 and above are formed by adding a multiplicative adverb (&quot;-wa&quot; or &quot;-ya&quot;) to the base number and the word &quot;kʼátsi&quot;.

=== Loanwords from Spanish ===
European colonizers arriving in the Southwest US brought with them material culture and concepts that were unknown to the peoples living in the area. Words for the new ideas introduced by Spaniards were often borrowed into Keres directly from Early Modern Spanish, and a large number of these persists in Modern Keresan.

==Proto-language==

Selected Proto-Keresan reconstructions of plants, animals, and toponyms by Miller and Davis (1963) are given below. The IPA transcription is based on the authors&#x27; description. Underlined consonants in reconstructions refer to uncertainties by the authors regarding aspiration (p. 312); these are shown as capitalized consonants in the IPA. 

== In popular media ==
Keres was one of the seven languages sung in the Coca-Cola &quot;It&#x27;s Beautiful&quot; commercial during the 2014 Super Bowl featuring &quot;America the Beautiful&quot;.

<doc id="1283026" wikidata="Q1624258" url="?curid=1283026" title="¡Hola!">
<text>¡Hola! is a weekly Spanish-language magazine specializing in celebrity news, published in Madrid, Spain, and in 15 other countries, with local editions in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Greece, Indonesia, Mexico, Pakistan, Peru, Philippines, Puerto Rico, Thailand, United Kingdom, United States and Venezuela. It is the second most popular magazine in Spain after &quot;Pronto&quot;. The title means &quot;Hello!&quot; in English and it is the parent magazine of the British magazine &quot;Hello!&quot;, &quot;Hello! Canada&quot; and &quot;Hola! USA&quot;.

==History and profile==
&quot;¡Hola!&quot; was founded in Barcelona on 2 September 1944 by Antonio Sánchez Gómez, who continued to run the magazine until his death in the 1970s. He employed mainly relatives and to this day &quot;¡Hola!&quot; remains a predominantly family run organisation, with Sánchez&#x27;s wife still stepping in to provide layout for important royal wedding spreads. Later the headquarters of the magazine moved to Madrid.

Initially designed as a family magazine, Sánchez soon realized the potential for profit in the women&#x27;s industry and initially focused on the doings of royalty, as well as offering a self-help section. Then the magazine became a gossip magazine, although the Spanish version still relies heavily on royalty for their gossip, whilst the English and Latin American versions focus more on Hollywood. The former Spanish Prime Minister Felipe González gave his first interview to the magazine when he was in office.

The magazine continues to grow and its edition in Argentina was launched in 2010.

==Circulation==
The combined readership of &quot;¡Hola!&quot; and its various sister magazines is more than a million a week, a large growth from the original 4,000 copies which sold in its first week of production in 1944. The circulation of the magazine was 654,836 copies in 1993, making it the second best-selling magazine in Spain. The magazine was the third best selling magazine in the country with a circulation of 627,514 copies in 1997.

The circulation of &quot;¡Hola!&quot; was 553,042 copies in 2005. Its circulation was 537,270 copies in 2008 and 475,049 in 2009.

<doc id="1283028" wikidata="Q519877" url="?curid=1283028" title="Kri-kri">
<text>The kri-kri (&quot;Capra hircus cretica&quot;), sometimes called the Cretan goat, Agrimi, or Cretan Ibex, is a feral goat inhabiting the Eastern Mediterranean, previously considered a subspecies of wild goat. The kri-kri today is found only in Greece: specifically on Crete and on three small islands off its coast (Dia, Thodorou, and Agii Pantes); as well as on the island of Sapientza (Messenian Oinousses) off the southwestern coast of Peloponnese, where it was brought in great numbers in order to protect the species from extinction.
The kri-kri has a light brownish coat with a darker band around its neck. It has two horns that sweep back from the head. In the wild they are shy and avoid humans, resting during the day. The animal can leap some distance or climb seemingly sheer cliffs.

The kri-kri is not thought to be indigenous to Crete, most likely having been imported to the island during the time of the Minoan civilization. It was once common throughout the Aegean but the peaks of the 2,400 m (8,000 ft) White Mountains of Western Crete are their last strongholds—particularly a series of almost vertical 900 m (3,000 ft) cliffs called &#x27;the Untrodden&#x27;—at the head of the Samaria Gorge. This mountain range, which hosts another 14 endemic animal species, is protected as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. In total, their range extends to the White Mountains, the Samaria National Forest and the islets of Dia, Thodorou, and Agii Pandes. Recently some were introduced onto two more islands.

By 1960, the kri-kri was under threat, with a population below 200. It had been the only meat available to mountain guerillas during the German occupation in World War II. Its status was one reasons why the Samaria Gorge became a national park in 1962. There are still only about 2,000 animals on the island and they are considered vulnerable: hunters still seek them for their tender meat, grazing grounds have become scarcer and disease has affected them. Hybridization is also a threat, as the population has interbred with ordinary goats. Hunting them is strictly prohibited.
Archaeological excavations have unearthed several depictions of the kri-kri. Some academics believe that the animal was worshiped during antiquity. On the island, males are often called &#x27;agrimi&#x27; (, i.e. &#x27;the wild one&#x27;), while the name &#x27;sanada&#x27; () is used for the female. The kri-kri is a symbol of the island, much used in tourism marketing and official literature.

As molecular analyses demonstrate, the kri-kri is not, as previously thought, a distinct subspecies of wild goat. Rather, it is a feral domestic goat, derived from the first stocks of goats domesticated in the Levant and other parts of the Eastern Mediterranean around 8000-7500 BCE. Therefore, it represents a nearly ten-thousand-year-old &quot;snapshot&quot; of the first domestication of goats.

<text>Scaredy Cat is a 1948 Warner Bros. &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoon directed by Chuck Jones. The short was released on December 18, 1948, and stars Porky Pig and Sylvester the Cat. The cartoon is notable in that it marks the first time the name &quot;Sylvester&quot; is used for the popular feline character. In previous shorts, the cat is unnamed, except for in the 1947 cartoon &quot;Tweetie Pie&quot; in which he is referred to as &quot;Thomas&quot;.

This is the first of three comedy horror-themed cartoons that starred the duo, with the other two being &quot;Claws for Alarm&quot; (1954) and &quot;Jumpin&#x27; Jupiter&quot; (1955). They all had the running theme of Porky and Sylvester settling down for the night in a location that was dangerous, with Porky being oblivious and Sylvester being aware and trying to alert Porky, but only succeeding in annoying him.

==Plot==
Porky purchases a new home from a real estate agent, which turns out to be an old Gothic-style house. His pet cat Sylvester is frightened by the creepy-looking place, but Porky finds it &quot;quaint&quot; and &quot;peaceful&quot; and looks forward to his first night there. Sylvester gets spooked by a bat and jumps inside Porky&#x27;s coat, and Porky chastises him by pointing out that the bat is harmless before declaring that he is going upstairs to bed while Sylvester will sleep in the kitchen.

Unknown to Porky, Sylvester clings to him all the way to the bedroom and into bed. When Porky discovers him in the bed, he kicks him down the stairs, telling him to stay in the kitchen. Suddenly, Sylvester sees that the house is overrun with murderous mice who are in the process of carting off the previous owners&#x27; cat to be decapitated by a mouse wearing a black hood and holding an executioner&#x27;s ax. Terrified, Sylvester races upstairs and hides in Porky&#x27;s nightshirt. Sylvester tries to explain to Porky by demonstrating (in mime) what occurred downstairs, but Porky criticizes the &quot;ridiculous acting&quot; and orders Sylvester back to the kitchen. Too frightened to comply, Sylvester pulls a gun from a dresser drawer and prepares to shoot himself in the head rather than face whatever fate the mice have in store for the pair. Horrified, Porky disarms Sylvester and is forced to let him share the bed in order to alleviate his trouble.

As Porky and Sylvester are sleeping, four mice push the bed out of the window, and it sticks on a pole. Porky, half-asleep and thinking it is cold in the room, asks Sylvester to close the window. Sylvester proceeds to do so, himself barely awake and walking on thin air, as the pole springs the bed back into the room. Sylvester closes a tiny curtain on a birdhouse, gets back into the bed that is not there and falls to the ground. He comes through the bedroom door with a big lump on his head. At that moment, he sees that the mice are about to drop an anvil on Porky from a crawlspace above the bed. Sylvester grabs the anvil at the last moment. Porky awakes and sees Sylvester poised above him with it in his hands. Porky questions Sylvester&#x27;s intentions before dropping it on the cat&#x27;s head and leading the way back to the kitchen. Descending the staircase, Sylvester sees the hooded mouse roll a bowling ball down the banister, targeted directly at Porky, who has reached the bottom. Sylvester races down the stairs and shoves Porky out of the way so hard that the pig ends up in the kitchen headfirst in a laundry basket. Meanwhile, at the base of the staircase, Sylvester teeters and then falls to the floor unconscious after his head is flattened by the bowling ball intended for Porky.

Porky storms back from the kitchen (not noticing the basket being lowered below the floor) demanding to know why Sylvester pushed him. Seeing the cat knocked out, Porky suggests it is just a ploy to gain sympathy. Over the next few scenes, as he lifts Sylvester, carries him to the kitchen and puts him in the basket, an oblivious Porky barely escapes many attempts, via several tools and weapons, by the mice to kill him. Sylvester, out cold in the basket, is lowered below the floor just after 1:00 A.M. and is raised up again just before 4:00 A.M., without the basket and with the normally black portions of his fur having turned completely pale gray. Traumatized, he makes his way to Porky&#x27;s room where he startles the pig awake with his gruesome appearance. Finally at his wits&#x27; end, Porky drags him downstairs, and goes into the kitchen by himself to show Sylvester there is nothing to fear. After a few seconds of silence, Sylvester looks in the kitchen and sees the mice parading as they did earlier with the other cat, only now it is Porky who bound and gagged and on his way to be decapitated. As the mice take him away, a weeping Porky holds up a sign that reads &quot;YOU WERE RIGHT – SYLVESTER&quot;. Sylvester is horrified and immediately flees out of the house. As he rests to catch his breath, his conscience (a miniature Sylvester wearing a wizard&#x27;s robe and carrying a star-tipped wand) appears with an easel. Using the easel to draw diagrams and charts, the conscience berates Sylvester for cowardly leaving Porky to save his own skin, reminding how Porky raised him as a kitten, showing him the &quot;comparative sizes&quot; of a cat to a mouse, and demanding that he return to the house to take action. Reinvigorated, Sylvester grabs a tree branch for use as a weapon, then decides to use the whole tree instead and races back into the mouse-infested house to fight. He sends the hundreds of murderous mice running for their lives, much to his conscience&#x27;s delight.

With the mice now all supposedly gone for good, Porky graciously apologizes to Sylvester and thanks him for saving his life. One leftover mouse (the executioner) pops out of the longcase clock behind Sylvester, wielding a large wooden mallet. Seeing this, Porky warns Sylvester to look out, but the mouse clobbers Sylvester on the head, knocking him unconscious, much to Porky&#x27;s shock. The mouse then yanks off his hood, revealing that he has transformed into a Lew Lehr caricature wearing a Napoleonic-era bicorne hat. The rodent then chuckles and declares, &quot;Pussycats is the cwaziest peoples!&quot;

==Reception==
In Jerry Beck&#x27;s 2020 compendium &quot;The 100 Greatest Looney Tunes Cartoons&quot;, animator Yvette Kaplan expresses her admiration for this short&#x27;s script as well as for its pairing of Porky and Sylvester:

==Notes==
*This is the first short in which the cartoon cat is referred to as &quot;Sylvester&quot;, as prior to that he is either unnamed or, in the case of the 1947 release &quot;Tweetie Pie&quot;, is named &quot;Thomas&quot;. Sylvester&#x27;s name was based on the Latin scientific name for the European wildcat, &quot;Felis silvestris&quot;. This is also the first Sylvester cartoon directed by Chuck Jones.
*This was the only one of five 1948 WB cartoons to get a Blue Ribbon reissue prior to 1956 and with the original credits cut. The others are &quot;Daffy Dilly&quot;, &quot;The Foghorn Leghorn&quot;, &quot;Kit for Cat&quot;, and &quot;You Were Never Duckier&quot;. &quot;Scaredy Cat&quot; is the latest-released cartoon to have its credits cut upon reissue. In 1998, for the &quot;THIS VERSION&quot; of the short, the original opening and credits were restored. This print was used on the &quot;Golden Collection&quot;, without the notice at the end.
*This is the first of three Jones cartoons which placed Porky Pig and Sylvester (in a rare non-speaking role as Porky&#x27;s pet) in a spooky setting where only Sylvester was aware of the danger, the other two films being &quot;Claws for Alarm&quot; (1954) and &quot;Jumpin&#x27; Jupiter&quot; (1955).
*Parts of this cartoon were used in the 1977 Halloween TV special &quot;Bugs Bunny&#x27;s Howl-oween Special&quot;.
*The high-pitched yelling from the fleeing mice was re-used in &quot;Kiss Me Cat&quot; (1953), when the mouse family runs away from the &quot;magnified&quot; kitten Pussyfoot. The same track is also used in &quot;Forward March Hare&quot; (1953), when his fellow soldiers run for cover as Bugs uses an ammunition shell to nail his calendar to a wall. Interestingly, the former cartoon also depicts the cats as the heroes and the mice as the villains rather than vice versa, much like this cartoon. Both WB shorts were also directed by Jones.

<doc id="1283032" wikidata="Q1769214" url="?curid=1283032" title="Porno for Pyros (album)">
<text>Porno for Pyros is the debut studio album by the American alternative rock band Porno for Pyros, released on April 27, 1993, by Warner Bros. Records. Jane&#x27;s Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro and bassist Eric Avery, battling substance abuse issues, had left the band in 1991 in an attempt to stay clean, though the other half of the band wished to continue creating music. The remaining members of Jane&#x27;s Addiction, Perry Farrell and Stephen Perkins, were joined by guitarist Peter DiStefano and future Jane&#x27;s Addiction bassist Martyn LeNoble, and continued under the new band name Porno for Pyros. The band (and album) name is a reference to the 1992 Los Angeles riots, which are mentioned throughout the songs on the album as a recurring theme.

The album was certified Gold in the US by the RIAA and contained the No. 1 Modern rock single &quot;Pets&quot;.

==Music==
Before the album&#x27;s release, the musical direction and focus of the band and album were said to be &quot;laid-back&quot;, &quot;ethnic-influenced&quot; and &quot;edgy and experimental&quot;. Critics often compared the sound of &quot;Porno for Pyros&quot; to that of Jane&#x27;s Addiction upon its release, noting many parallels in song structure and overall sound. Many of the songs on the album were written in Jane’s Addiction.

Such comparisons may be unavoidable; three of Porno for Pyros&#x27; founding four members (Farrell, Perkins and LeNoble) have either been past or are current members of Jane&#x27;s Addiction. In addition, a number of songs on &quot;Porno for Pyros&quot;, namely &quot;Blood Rag&quot; and &quot;Bad Shit&quot;, were written during the pre-1992 Jane&#x27;s Addiction period, although they would remain unfinished and unrecorded until the &quot;Porno for Pyros&quot; album.

The songs &quot;Cursed Female&quot; and &quot;Cursed Male&quot; were released as the album&#x27;s first single. The songs appear on the album as two separate tracks. In addition to the two respective album versions, the single also included the two songs together in medley form as a single track. This medley was also released on the album&#x27;s second (and highest charting) single, &quot;Pets&quot;.

Another non-album B-side, &quot;A Little Sadness&quot;, was released as a track on &quot;Porno for Pyros&quot;&#x27; fourth and final single, &quot;Sadness&quot;. Recorded during the album sessions but left off in favor of its namesake, the song was a complete reworking and rerecording of &quot;Sadness&quot;. &quot;A Little Sadness&quot; featured primarily acoustic guitars, subdued vocals, bongos and saxophone, a sharp contrast to its electric progenitor. In an unusual move, a video was created for the B-side rather than the album track.

&quot;Porno for Pyros&quot;, &quot;Packin&#x27; .25&quot; and &quot;Black Girlfriend&quot; all referenced or were inspired by the 1992 Los Angeles riots.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Newsday&quot; noted that &quot;the playing is a little more minimalist than Jane&#x27;s Addiction, with Perkins&#x27;s percussion often spare and subtle (though prominent in the mix), while DiStefano&#x27;s guitar is decidedly more earthbound than that of Jane&#x27;s often adventurous David Navarro.&quot; &quot;Trouser Press&quot; opined that &quot;the relentless stupidity of Farrell&#x27;s wishfully scandalous dilettantism ... adds to the misery, but that’s nothing new for him.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;songs jump from drifting ballad to wah-wah funk to blaring power chords, from bluesy rock to Perkins&#x27;s hard-rock version of Latin rhythms... The volatile, turbulent music scrabbles at emotions that rock rarely touches.&quot;

<doc id="1283036" wikidata="Q814935" url="?curid=1283036" title="Accession of Turkey to the European Union">
<text>Turkey is negotiating its accession to the European Union (EU) as a member state, following its application to become a full member of the European Economic Community (EEC), the predecessor of the EU, on 14 April 1987.

After the ten founding members in 1949, Turkey became one of the first new members (the 13th member) of the Council of Europe in 1950. The country became an associate member of the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1963 and was an associate member of the Western European Union from 1992 to its end in 2011. Turkey signed a Customs Union agreement with the EU in 1995 and was officially recognised as a candidate for full membership on 12 December 1999, at the Helsinki summit of the European Council.

Negotiations for full membership were started on 3 October 2005. Progress was slow: out of the 35 chapters necessary to complete the accession process, only 16 had been opened and one had been closed by May 2016. The early 2016 refugee deal between Turkey and the European Union was intended to accelerate negotiations after previous stagnation and allow visa-free travel through Europe for Turks.

Since 2016, accession negotiations have stalled. The EU has accused and criticized Turkey for human rights violations and deficits in rule of law. In 2017, EU officials said that the strong presidency created by the 2017 Turkish constitutional referendum would violate the Copenhagen criteria of eligibility for an EU membership.

On 20 February 2019, a European parliament committee voted to suspend the accession talks, sparking criticism from the government of Turkey. Turkey&#x27;s accession negotiations have therefore effectively come to a standstill and no further chapters can be considered for opening or closing and no further work towards the modernisation of the EU-Turkey Customs Union is foreseen.

On 30 January 2023, the Table of Six (then-main opposition alliance) in Turkey released a memorandum of understanding for common policies. It re-affirmed the opposition&#x27;s intent to continue the EU accession talks if they were to be elected in that year&#x27;s elections.
It is one of nine current EU candidate countries, together with Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, and Ukraine.

==History==

===Background===
After the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s collapse following World War I, Turkish revolutionaries led by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk emerged victorious in the Turkish War of Independence, establishing the modern Turkish Republic as it exists today. Atatürk, President of Turkey, implemented a series of reforms, including secularisation and industrialisation, intended to &quot;Europeanise&quot; or Westernise the country. During World War II, Turkey remained neutral until February 1945, when it joined the Allies. The country took part in the Marshall Plan of 1947, became a member of the Council of Europe in 1950, and a member of NATO in 1952. During the Cold War, Turkey allied itself with the United States and Western Europe. The Turkish position vis-à-vis Europe has been characterized as &quot;Europe has been an object of desire as well as a source of frustration for Turkish national identity in a long and strained history&quot;.

===Brief history of major events===
===1950s–1990s===
Turkey first applied for associate membership in the European Economic Community in 1959, and on 12 September 1963 signed the &quot;Agreement Creating An Association Between The Republic of Turkey and the European Economic Community&quot;, also known as the Ankara Agreement. This agreement came into effect the following year on 12 December 1964. The Ankara Agreement sought to integrate Turkey into a customs union with the EEC whilst acknowledging the final goal of membership. In November 1970, a further protocol called the &quot;Additional Protocol&quot; established a timetable for the abolition of tariffs and quotas on goods traded between Turkey and the EEC.

On 14 April 1987, Turkey submitted its application for formal membership into the European Economic Community. The European Commission responded in December 1989 by confirming Ankara&#x27;s eventual membership but also by deferring the matter to more favourable times, citing Turkey&#x27;s economic and political situation, as well its poor relations with Greece and the conflict with Cyprus as creating an unfavourable environment with which to begin negotiations. This position was confirmed again in the Luxembourg European Council of 1997 in which accession talks were started with central and eastern European states and Cyprus, but not Turkey. During the 1990s, Turkey proceeded with closer integration with the European Union by agreeing to a customs union in 1995. In 1999, following the Greek-Turkish earthquake diplomacy, Greece lifted its opposition to Turkey&#x27;s accession to the European Union. Moreover, the Helsinki Summit European Council of 1999 proved a milestone as the EU recognised Turkey as a candidate on equal footing with other potential candidates.

===2000s===
The next significant step in EU–Turkey relations came with the December 2002 Copenhagen European Council. According to it, &quot;the EU would open negotiations with Turkey &#x27;without delay&#x27; if the European Council in December 2004, on the basis of a report and a recommendation from the Commission, decides that Turkey fulfills the Copenhagen political criteria.&quot; French President Jacques Chirac and German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder expressed joint support for the December 2004 European Commission summit meeting agenda for Turkey joining the European Union.

The European Commission recommended that the negotiations should begin in 2005, but also added various precautionary measures. The EU leaders agreed on 16 December 2004 to start accession negotiations with Turkey from 3 October 2005. While Austria and Germany initially wanted to leave open the possibility that negotiations with Turkey would lead to a privileged partnership, less than full membership, accession negotiations were ultimately launched with the &quot;shared objective&quot; of membership.

Turkey&#x27;s accession talks have since been stalled by a number of domestic and external problems. Both Austria and France have said they would hold a referendum on Turkey&#x27;s accession. In the case of France, a change in its Constitution was made to impose such a referendum, but later another constitutional change has enabled the parliament (if a large majority of its members agrees) to prevent such a referendum. The issue of Cyprus continues to be a major obstacle to negotiations. European officials have commented on the slowdown in Turkish reforms which, combined with the Cyprus problem, led the EU&#x27;s Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn in March 2007 to warn of an impending &#x27;train crash&#x27; in the negotiations. Due to these setbacks, negotiations again came to a halt in December 2006, with the EU freezing talks in 8 of the 35 key areas under negotiation.

In 2007, Turkey stated that they were aiming to comply with EU law by 2013, but Brussels refused to back that as a deadline for membership. In 2006 President of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso said that the accession process will take at least until 2021. In a visit to Germany on 31 October 2012, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan made clear that Turkey was expecting membership in the Union to be realised by 2023, the 100th Anniversary of the Turkish Republic, implying that they could end membership negotiations if the talks had not yielded a positive result by then. Turkish President Abdullah Gül said that upon completing the accession process Turkey will hold a referendum for Turkish membership in the European Union.

In December 2009, EU member the Republic of Cyprus blocked 6 chapters of Turkish accession negotiations, including those on Judiciary and Fundamental Rights, Energy and Education and Culture, arguing that Turkey needs to first normalise relations with Cyprus. As a result, no chapters have been opened since June 2010. Hence, there is no chapter Turkey could open other than the difficult and economically detrimental chapters Competition Policy, Social Policy and Employment, and Public Procurement that most candidate countries open at the end of accession as all other chapters were blocked. In February 2013, Turkish Deputy Undersecretary of the Ministry for EU Affairs, Burak Erdenir, claimed that the EU had yet to communicate to Turkey the benchmark criteria for opening chapters 23 and 24, Judiciary &amp; Fundamental Rights and Justice, Freedom &amp; Security, which was to be done after screening of the chapters was completed in 2006, thus making it impossible to comply with them. He also suggested this was a deliberate attempt to slow their accession process.

===Positive agenda (2012–13)===
After over two years of no chapter openings, the European Commission set up a &quot;Positive Agenda&quot; designed to focus on common EU-Turkey interests. EU Commissioner for expansion Stefan Füle describes that the goal was &quot;to keep the accession process alive and put it properly back on track after a period of stagnation which has been a source of frustration for both sides.&quot; The EU Commission mentioned a broad range of areas as the main elements of the Agenda such as &quot;intensified dialogue and cooperation on political reforms&quot;, &quot;visa&quot;, &quot;mobility and migration&quot;, &quot;energy&quot;, &quot;fight against terrorism&quot;, &quot;further participation of Turkey in Community programmes&quot;, &quot;town twinning&quot;, &quot;trade and the Customs Union&quot; and &quot;supporting efforts to align with the acquis, including on chapters where accession negotiations cannot be opened for the time being&quot;. The proposal was considered favorably on the condition that it serves as an instrument in support of and complementary to the negotiation process with the EU.

In the framework of &quot;Positive Agenda&quot;, Working Groups were established on 8 chapters (&quot;3-Right of Establishment and Freedom to Provide Services&quot;, &quot;6-Company Law&quot;, &quot;10-Information Society and Media&quot;, &quot;18-Statistics&quot;, &quot;23-Judiciary and Fundamental Rights&quot;, &quot;24-Justice, Freedom and Security&quot;, &quot;28-Consumer and Health Protection&quot;, and &quot;32-Financial Control&quot;). The &quot;Positive Agenda&quot; kick-off meeting was held on 17 May 2012 in Ankara with the participation of Stefan Füle, EU Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy. As a result of the Working Groups meetings held so far, a total of four closing benchmarks were confirmed to have been met by Turkey in three chapters (Company Law, Consumer and Health Protection as well as Financial Control chapters).

On 20 June 2013, in the wake of Ankara&#x27;s crackdown on mass demonstrations in Taksim Square, Germany blocked the start to new EU accession talks with Turkey. According to the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, one Turkish official said that such a move could potentially break off political relations with the bloc.

A Eurobarometer poll which included EU countries and candidate countries as well, showed that 43% of Turks viewed the EU positively, as compared with 60% six months previously. In the same poll, 29% of Turks polled expressed support for an EU Constitution, the lowest level of support among EU countries and candidates polled. Germany said that its reservation stems from a technical issue, but then-Chancellor Angela Merkel, an opponent of Turkish entry into the EU, described herself as &quot;shocked&quot; after Ankara&#x27;s use of overwhelming police force against mostly peaceful demonstrators. France stated that they would not waive their veto over unfreezing four accession chapters with Turkey until after the elections for the European Parliament in June 2014.

===Stalled talks (2016–present)===

EU–Turkey relations have deteriorated following President Erdoğan&#x27;s crackdown on supporters of the 2016 Turkish coup d&#x27;état attempt. While Erdoğan stated that he approved the reintroduction of the death penalty to punish those involved in the coup, the EU announced that it strongly condemned the coup attempt and would officially end accession negotiations with Turkey if the death penalty was reintroduced. On 25 July 2016, President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker said that Turkey was not in a position to become a member of the European Union in the near future and that accession negotiations between the EU and Turkey would be stopped immediately if the death penalty was brought back. Erdoğan stated in November 2016 that he was considering putting Turkey&#x27;s continued negotiations with the EU on membership to a referendum in 2017. In November 2016, the European Parliament voted in favour of a non-binding resolution to request that the European Commission temporarily suspend membership negotiations due to the &quot;disproportionate repressive measures&quot; of the government to the coup. On 13 December, the European Council (comprising the heads of state or government of the member states) resolved that it would open no new areas in Turkey&#x27;s membership talks in the &quot;prevailing circumstances&quot;; Turkey&#x27;s path toward autocratic rule makes progress on EU accession impossible.
In 2016, EU member Austria opposed Turkey&#x27;s EU membership.

In April 2017, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) voted to reopen its monitoring procedure against Turkey. This vote is widely understood to deal a major blow to Turkey&#x27;s prospect of eventual EU membership, as exiting that process was made a precondition of EU accession negotiations back in 2004. In June 2017, members of the European Parliament expressed that the strong presidency created by the 2017 Turkish constitutional referendum violate the Copenhagen criteria of eligibility for an EU membership. On 6 July 2017, the European Parliament approved a resolution calling for the suspension of full membership negotiations between the EU and Turkey.

The European Commission&#x27;s long-term budget proposal for the 2021–2027 period released in May 2018 included pre-accession funding for a Western Balkan Strategy for further enlargement, but omitted Turkey.

In March 2018, Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz opposed Turkey&#x27;s EU accession talks and urged it to halt membership talks. On 26 June 2018, the EU&#x27;s General Affairs Council stated that &quot;the Council notes that Turkey has been moving further away from the European Union. Turkey&#x27;s accession negotiations have therefore effectively come to a standstill and no further chapters can be considered for opening or closing and no further work towards the modernisation of the EU-Turkey Customs Union is foreseen.&quot; The Council added that it is &quot;especially concerned about the continuing and deeply worrying backsliding on the rule of law and on fundamental rights including the freedom of expression.&quot;

On 20 February 2019, a European parliament committee voted to suspend the accession talks, sparking criticism from the government of Turkey. On 13 March 2019, the European Parliament unanimously voted for a halt to the full membership negotiations between the EU and Turkey. On 19 May 2021, the European Parliament unanimously accepted the call for the suspension of accession negotiations between the EU and Turkey. In July 2023, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan brought up Turkey&#x27;s EU membership application during a NATO summit in Vilnius, linking it to Sweden&#x27;s accession to NATO. According to Dagens Nyheter&#x27;s data, in September 2023, 60% of Swedes said that Sweden opposes Turkey&#x27;s EU membership and will not support the membership process, while 7% said that Sweden does not oppose Turkey&#x27;s EU membership and will support the membership process.

===Pre-accession support to Turkey===

The European Commission&#x27;s long-term budget proposal for the 2021-2027 period released in May 2018 included pre-accession funding for a Western Balkan Strategy for further enlargement, but omitted Turkey.

==Expected impact of joining==

===Effect upon the EU===
The problem of Turkey&#x27;s membership of the EU is compounded by conflicting views as to what the EU should ultimately become. This has played a significant role in the debate, due in part to the European debt crisis and the fact that as a result of this the eurozone and the EU overall is more federalised on both fiscal, legal and political levels than it was at the time of Turkey&#x27;s application or at the time that Turkey was accepted as a candidate. Generally those members of the EU who support a rights-based free trade bloc do not oppose Turkey as adamantly as those who support a broader political union. The latter, in particular, were concerned that unification would be frustrated and the European project threatened by Turkey&#x27;s inclusion.

Proponents of Turkey&#x27;s membership argue that Turkey&#x27;s geographical location will contribute to peace. According to the Swedish foreign minister, Carl Bildt, &quot;the accession of Turkey would give the EU a decisive role for stability in the eastern part of the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, which is clearly in the strategic interest of Europe&quot;. Poland is a key supporter for Turkey&#x27;s bid to join the EU, while the United Kingdom has expressed support previously, but not since leaving the EU.

Upon joining the EU, Turkey&#x27;s 83 million inhabitants would bestow the largest number of MEPs in the European Parliament. Turkey now has a larger population than Germany. However, a single country can only hold a maximum of 96 seats in the European Parliament.

Turkey&#x27;s membership would also affect future enlargement plans, especially the number of nations seeking EU membership, grounds on which Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing has opposed Turkey&#x27;s admission. Giscard has suggested that it would lead to demands for accession by Morocco. Morocco&#x27;s application is already rejected for &quot;not being a European country&quot;; Turkey, unlike Morocco, has 3% of its territory in Europe. The vast majority of its population lives in the Asian side of the country. On the other hand, the country&#x27;s largest city, Istanbul, lies mostly in Europe. On the other hand, Cyprus, which is geographically located in Asia, joined the European Union in 2004. French President Nicolas Sarkozy stated in January 2007 that &quot;enlarging Europe with no limit risks destroying European political union, and that I do not accept ... I want to say that Europe must give itself borders, that not all countries have a vocation to become members of Europe, beginning with Turkey which has no place inside the European Union.&quot;

EU member states must unanimously agree on Turkey&#x27;s membership for the Turkish accession to be successful. A number of nations may oppose it; notably Austria; Germany (former chancellor Angela Merkel has long rejected Turkey&#x27;s accession bid, and has proposed a &quot;privileged partnership&quot; instead); and France (where some are anxious at the prospect of a new wave of Muslim immigrants, given the country&#x27;s already large Muslim community).

Negotiations to remove the French constitutional requirement for a compulsory referendum on all EU accessions after Croatia resulted in a new proposal to require a compulsory referendum on the accession of any country with a population of more than 5% of the EU&#x27;s total population; this clause would mainly apply to Turkey and Ukraine.

The current situation according to the French constitution is as follows: if of the delegates (from the Senate and the Parliament) agree to the accession of Turkey, there will be no referendum.

===Benefits to Turkey===
Upon accession to the EU, Turkey expects to receive economic development aid. There is also an expectation that there will be an increase in European foreign investment in the Turkish economy, further driving economic growth. During potential economic crisis events, Turkey could benefit from EU assistance.

Free movement of people across the EU will give many Turkish people the opportunity to migrate to other parts of Europe in search of work, or a higher standard of living. The option of migration out of Turkey will inevitably ease tensions in the east of the country, as the prospect of a better standard of living will tend to cool separatist tendencies. However, there have been problems concerning irregular transit migration through Turkey to the EU.

Some secularists in Turkey envisage that the accession of Turkey will contribute to the spread of secular western values in Turkey. Conversely, some non-secularists in Turkey envisage that accession will contribute to the further growth and acceptance of Islam in Europe. The EU accession bid has stimulated Turkey&#x27;s political and legal reforms and intensified the democratisation process.

Given Turkey&#x27;s large and growing population, Turkey will have a correspondingly large representation in the European Parliament (2nd and equal with Germany, with 96 seats in EU parliament). This will give Turkey a strong direct influence over EU policies.

==Turkish membership issues==

===Economy===

Turkey has the world&#x27;s 11th largest GDP-PPP and 17th largest Nominal GDP. The country is a founding member of the OECD and the G-20 major economies.

Turkey has taken advantage of a customs union with the European Union, signed in 1995, to increase its industrial production destined for exports, while at the same time benefiting from EU-origin foreign investment into the country. In 2008, Turkey&#x27;s exports reached US$141.8 billion (main export partners: Germany 11.2%, UK 8%, Italy 6.95%, France 5.6%, Spain 4.3%, US 3.88%; total EU exports 56.5%.) However, larger imports amounting to about US$204.8 billion threaten the balance of trade (main import partners: Russia 13.8%, Germany 10.3%, China 7.8%, Italy 6%, USA 4.8%, France 4.6%, Iran 3.9%, UK 3.2%; total EU imports 40.4%; total Asia imports 27%).

The opening of talks regarding the Economic and Monetary Policy acquis chapter of Turkey&#x27;s accession bid was expected to begin in June 2007, but were stalled by France. Turkey became the European Union&#x27;s fifth-largest trade partner in 2015 according to data released by Eurostat.

Turkey is set to receive EUR 9.2bn from the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance, a funding mechanism for EU candidate countries.

===Population===

, the population of Turkey stood at 71.5 million with a yearly growth rate of 1.5%. The Turkish population is relatively young, with 25.5% falling within the 0–15 age bracket. As of February 2023, the population of Turkey is approximately 87 million people.

Turkey&#x27;s large population could alter the balance of power in the representative European institutions. Upon joining the EU, Turkey would be allocated the largest number of MEPs in the European Parliament. This is because the European Parliament distributes seats to member states according to their population. Therefore, if Turkey is admitted, it could influence the EU legislation and administration in line with its own policies.

If Turkey were to join the European Union, Istanbul would become the most populous metropolis in the EU (as of 2004).

===Foreign relations with EU member states===
Turkey has no diplomatic relations with Cyprus as Turkey does not recognize the government of the Republic of Cyprus.
====Cyprus====
Cyprus was divided when, on 20 July 1974, Turkey invaded and occupied a third of the island in response to an Athens-engineered coup aimed at annexing Cyprus to Greece. Since then, Turkey has refused to acknowledge the Republic of Cyprus (an EU member since 2004) as the sole authority on the island, and recognizes the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus since its establishment in 1983. The Turkish invasion in 1974 and the resulting movement of refugees along both sides of the Green Line, and the establishment of the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus in 1983, form the core issues which surround the ongoing Cyprus dispute.

Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots backed the 2004 Annan Plan for Cyprus aimed at the reunification of the island, but the plan was subsequently rejected by Greek Cypriots on the grounds that it did not meet their needs. According to Greek Cypriots, the latest proposal included maintained residence rights for the many Anatolian Turks who moved to Cyprus after the invasion (and their descendants who were born on the island after 1974), while the Greek Cypriots who lost their property after the Turkish invasion would be granted only a restricted right of return to the north following the island&#x27;s proposed reunification. Although the outcome received much criticism in the EU as well, the Republic of Cyprus was admitted into the EU a week after the referendum.

The Turkish government has refused to officially recognise the Republic of Cyprus until the removal of the political and economic blockade on the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. Turkey&#x27;s non-recognition of the Republic of Cyprus has led to complications within the Customs Union. Under the customs agreements which Turkey had already signed as a precondition to start EU membership negotiations in 2005, it is obliged to open its ports to Cypriot planes and vessels, but Turkey has not complied so far; refusing to do so until the EU eases the international isolation of Northern Cyprus. In February 2013, Turkish EU Minister Egemen Bağış told the Republic of Cyprus, &quot;if you truly want salvation, truly want peace, then remove your blockade of Ercan Airport to EU member countries and Turkey will open its ports to you.&quot;

Turkey&#x27;s refusal to implement a trade pact between Turkey and the EU that requires the Turkish government to allow Greek Cypriot vessels to use its air and seaports has prompted the EU to freeze eight chapters in Turkey&#x27;s accession talks.

In November 2009, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Cemil Çiçek declared that, should Turkey be forced to choose between supporting either EU membership or Turkish Cypriots, &quot;[then] Turkey&#x27;s choice will forever be to stand next to the Turkish Cypriots. Everybody should understand this.&quot;

====Greece====

The issue of Turkish membership has been contentious in Greece. An opinion poll from 2005 suggested that only 25% of Greeks believe Turkey has a place in the European Union. The former Greek Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis stated that Turkish membership of the EU could only be predicated upon, &quot;full compliance, full accession&quot; in December 2006. In 2005 the European Commission referred to relations between Turkey and Greece as &quot;continuing to develop positively&quot; while also citing a key barrier to progress being Turkey&#x27;s ongoing claim of &quot;casus belli&quot; over a dispute about territorial waters boundaries.
In September 2017, Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, mentioned that halting accession talks with Turkey would be a strategic mistake by the European Union, amid a war of words raging between Germany and Turkey. Also, former Greek Prime Minister, George Papandreou, has urged European Union leaders to keep the doors open to Turkey and to continue dialogue with the Turkish government, in an apparent reference to the former German Chancellor Angela Merkel&#x27;s calls for the suspension of accession talks with Turkey.

===Religion===


Turkey has a secular constitution, civil and judicial system with no official religion, although the country&#x27;s most prominent imam (currently Ali Erbaş) is a civil servant and head of the Religious Affairs Directorate, or &quot;Diyanet&quot;. 82% of the Turkish population is Muslim of whom over 70% belong to the Sunni branch of Islam. A minority is affiliated with syncretic Alevi branch. A separate study published in 2019 found 89.5% of Turks identify as Muslim. Turkey would be the first and only Muslim-majority country to join or belong to the European Union. Current EU states typically contain large Muslim minorities. By contrast, Christians are believed to compose only 0.2% of Turkey&#x27;s population.

Official population census polls in Turkey do not include information regarding a person&#x27;s religious belief or ethnic background due to the regulations set by the Turkish constitution, which defines all citizens of the Republic of Turkey as Turkish in terms of nationality, regardless of faith or race.

There is a tradition of secularism in Turkey. The state has no official religion nor promotes any, and actively monitors . The constitution recognises the freedom of religion for individuals, whereas religious communities are placed under the protection of the state; but the constitution explicitly states that they cannot become involved in the political process (by forming a religious party, for instance) or establish faith-based schools. No party can claim that it represents a form of religious belief; nevertheless, religious sensibilities are generally represented through conservative parties. Turkey used to prohibit by law the wearing of religious headcover and theo-political symbolic garments for both sexes in government buildings, schools, and universities; the law was upheld by the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights as legitimate in the &quot;Leyla Şahin v. Turkey&quot; case on 10 November 2005. However, in 2010, the prohibition of wearing headscarves in universities was lifted.

Cultural differences between Muslim-majority Turkey and predominantly Christian Europe play an important part in the entire debate on Turkish accession to the European Union.

===Armenian genocide recognition===
In 2004, the French Foreign Minister Michel Barnier stated that Turkey must recognise the systematic massacres of Armenians in 1915 as a genocide. However, he insisted that although France did not set a precondition for European Union entry regarding the matter, he stated that France would raise the issue during negotiations. The President of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, stated that it must be a precondition for Turkey to recognise the systematic massacres of Armenians in 1915 as genocide.

The government of Turkey rejects such a precondition for EU membership and does not accept it as a part of the EU membership criteria.

In 2006, the European Parliament voted against a proposal to formally add the issue as a membership criterion for Turkey. A similar proposal by Greek and Greek Cypriot MEPs was also rejected by the European Parliament in 2011.

===LGBT rights in Turkey===

Although homosexuality is not a crime in Turkey, in contravention of European Union directives on human rights; Turkey temporarily banned LGBT pride parades in 2015 and 2016. Reasons given for the ban were &quot;security concerns&quot;, and &quot;religious sensitivities of the public&quot; caused by holding the parade during the month of Ramadan.

===Article 301===
Article 301 states that &quot;a person who publicly insults the Turkish nation, the State of the Republic of Turkey, or the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, shall be punishable by imprisonment of between six months and two years&quot; and also that &quot;expressions of thought intended to criticise shall not constitute a crime.&quot;

The EU was especially critical of this law during the September 2005 trial of novelist Orhan Pamuk over comments that recognised the deaths of thirty thousand Kurds and a million Armenians. Enlargement commissioner Olli Rehn and members of the European Parliament called the case &quot;regrettable&quot;, &quot;most unfortunate&quot;, and &quot;unacceptable&quot;. After the case was dropped three months later, Turkey&#x27;s Foreign Minister Abdullah Gül indicated that Turkey may abandon or modify Article 301, stating that &quot;there may be need for a new law&quot;. In September 2006, the European Parliament called for the abolition of laws, such as Article 301, &quot;which threaten European free speech norms&quot;. On 30 April 2008, the law was reformed. According to the reform, it is now a crime to explicitly insult the &quot;Turkish nation&quot; rather than &quot;Turkishness&quot;; opening court cases based on Article 301 require the approval of the Justice Minister; and the maximum punishment has been reduced to two years in jail.

Kemal Kerinçsiz, a patriotic lawyer, and other members of &quot;Büyük Hukukçular Birliği&quot; (Great Jurists Union) headed by Kerinçsiz, have been &quot;behind nearly all of [Article 301] trials.&quot; In January 2008, Kerinçsiz was arrested for participating in an ultra-nationalist underground organisation, Ergenekon, allegedly behind the attacks on the Turkish Council of State and Cumhuriyet newspaper, the assassination of several Christian missionaries and Armenian-Turkish journalist Hrant Dink, as well as allegedly plotting the assassination of Nobel laureate Orhan Pamuk. The Ergenekon trials were later attributed to a plot organized by a &quot;foreign-based Gulenist terror organization&quot; and all charges were dropped after the attempted military coup by Gulenists on 15 July 2016. 

===Women&#x27;s rights===


Turkey gave women the right to vote in 1930 for municipal elections. In 1934 this right was expanded for the national elections, while women were also given the right to become elected as MPs in the Turkish Parliament, or for being appointed as Ministers, Prime Minister, Speaker of the Parliament and President of the Republic. In 1993 Tansu Çiller became the first female Prime Minister of Turkey.

In its second report on women&#x27;s role in social, economic, and political life in Turkey, the European Parliament emphasised that respecting human rights, including women&#x27;s rights, is an essential condition for Turkey&#x27;s membership in the EU. According to the report, Turkey&#x27;s legal framework on women&#x27;s rights &quot;has in general been satisfactory, but its substantive implementation remains flawed.&quot;

===Conscientious objectors===
Turkey is one of two states (along with Azerbaijan) among the 47 members of the Council of Europe which refuse to recognise the status of conscientious objectors or give them an alternative to military service, other than a reduction of service by paying a tax.

==Public reactions==
===In the EU===
Public opinion in EU countries generally opposes Turkish membership, though with varying degrees of intensity. The Eurobarometer September–October 2006 survey shows that 59% of EU-27 citizens were against Turkey joining the EU, while only about 28% were in favour. Nearly all citizens (about 9 in 10) expressed concerns about human rights as the leading cause. In the earlier March–May 2006 Eurobarometer, citizens from the new member states were more in favour of Turkey joining (44% in favour) than the old EU-15 (38% in favour). At the time of the survey, the country whose population most strongly opposed Turkish membership was Austria (con: 81%), while Romania was most in favour of the accession (pro: 66%). On a wider political scope, the highest support came from the Turkish Cypriot Community (pro: 67%) (which is not recognised as a sovereign state and is &quot;de facto&quot; not EU territory and out of the European institutions). These communities were even more in favour of the accession than the Turkish populace itself (pro: 54%). Opposition in Denmark to Turkish membership was polled at 60% in October 2007, despite the Danish government&#x27;s support for Turkey&#x27;s EU bid.

There is a trend in declining support since 2000 that has continued due to the 2013 Gezi protests and the Purges in Turkey (2016–present). In the past support for Turkish accession came especially from left-wing parties, but more recently both sides of the political spectrum in Europe have been highly critical of Turkey&#x27;s human rights record. Opposition to Turkish accession is higher in countries such as Bulgaria and Germany which have a high population of Turkish diaspora or Muslims in Europe. YouGov polls from 2016 and 2019 have found respondents from France, Germany, Denmark, Finland and Sweden to have the largest net opposition to Turkey&#x27;s EU bid out of several other choices, including Israel and Russia.

===In Turkey===
The opening of membership talks with the EU in December 2004 was celebrated by Turkey with much fanfare, but the Turkish populace has become increasingly sceptical as negotiations were delayed based on what it views as lukewarm support for its accession to the EU and perceived double standards in its negotiations particularly with regard to the French and Austrian referendums. A mid-2006 Eurobarometer survey revealed that 43% of Turkish citizens view the EU positively; just 35% trust the EU, 45% support enlargement and just 29% support an EU constitution.

Moreover, Turks were divided on whether to join at all. A 2007 poll put Turkish support for accession to the EU at 41.9% (up from 32% in 2006), with 27.7% opposed and 24.0% indifferent. A 2009 poll showed that support for accession had risen to 48%, even as negative views of the EU had risen from 28% to 32%. A 2013 poll showed Turkish support for the EU bid at one third of the population, and opposition to double that share.

According to the Transatlantic Trends survey for 2013, 60% of Turks have an unfavourable view of the European Union and most Turks believe that working with Asia is more important to their national interests than working with Europe. Around 44% of Turks believe EU membership could be good for the economy in contrast with 61% for EU citizens. During an interview with Euractiv, EU Minister Egemen Bağış stated that: &quot;This is what Europe needs to do; they need to say that when Turkey fulfills all requirements, Turkey will become a member of the EU on date X. Then, we will regain the Turkish public opinion support in one day.&quot;

==Official viewpoints==
===Major current viewpoints===
* 2014 EU Presidential candidates Jean-Claude Juncker (EEP) and Martin Schulz (S&amp;D) promised that Turkey would never join the European Union while either one of them were President, reasoning that Turkey had turned its back on European democratic values. Juncker won the election and became the new president of the EU in November 2014. He stated that April: 

* Primary reasons for Turkey&#x27;s persistent requests to join the EU are, among others, the many Turks in Europe and the importance of trade between the two. Turkey is, however, also increasingly disappointed with the widespread opposition to its accession among EU member states. In September 2012, Turkish Prime Minister Erdoğan was asked by CNN if Turkey still wants to join the EU. His response: &quot;There are 5 million Turks in Europe and 3 million Turks in Germany alone. We are a natural member of the European Union. Germany invited Turkish workers 50 years ago, however, 50 years have passed and we have waited at the European Union&#x27;s doorstep. No other country has experienced such a thing. We will be patient until a point. However, when we cross that point, we will bring light to the situation and decide accordingly.&quot; During a trip to Yalta, Erdoğan expressed his stern disappointment regarding the EU accession process: &quot;We are still an EU negotiating candidate. At such a position, I wish EU accession. Otherwise, such a scenario would affect a large region including Ukraine and Turkey.&quot;
* Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel has repeatedly opposed full membership of Turkey to the EU at German-Turkish summits, advocating instead a privileged partnership. Some Christian Democrats back fuller support for Turkey, risking the chancellor becoming more isolated in advocating for a &quot;privileged partnership&quot;. In September 2011, on the occasion of the visit of the Turkish president Gül, Merkel said: &quot;We don&#x27;t want the full membership of Turkey. But we don&#x27;t want to lose Turkey as an important country&quot;, referring to her idea of a strategic partnership. In 2006, Chancellor Merkel said &quot;Turkey could be in deep, deep trouble when it comes to its aspirations to join the European Union&quot; regarding its refusal to open up its ports to European Union member Cyprus. Again in 2014, when Erdogan urged Merkel to strongly support his country&#x27;s bid, there was no sign the chancellor had relinquished her skepticism. She revealed after the two had talked: &quot;I personally said that we are in a negotiation process that has certain outcome and no fixed time frame. It is no secret and nothing has changed in my view that I am sceptical about full membership for Turkey.&quot; In a TV debate in September 2017, then-German chancellor Angela Merkel and her challenger Martin Schulz both said that they would seek an end to Turkey&#x27;s membership talks with the European Union.
* Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy opposed the entrance of Turkey in the European Union, arguing the country was too big, too poor, and too culturally different to join the EU. Former President Francois Hollande, however, reaffirmed support for Turkey in 2012, intending to smooth the way for French companies seeking contracts in Turkey. Franco-Turkish relations remained tense after Turkey imposed a law in 2009 that criminalised recognition of the killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks in 1915 as a genocide; a move France&#x27;s Constitutional Court reversed, in turn, causing French firms&#x27; share of foreign investment in Turkey to shrink from 6% in 2009 to 3% in 2012. Leaders of French infrastructure companies were especially eager to enter the Turkish markets for nuclear security and rail infrastructure, expected to respectively be worth $40 and $50 billion by 2020.

===Timeline===
* In September 1999, following a thaw in Greek-Turkish relations after mutual help in earthquake relief, Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou told &quot;The Guardian&quot; &quot;Greece not only wants to see Turkey in the EU, it wants to be pulling the cart of a European Turkey&quot;, and that it was within his nation&#x27;s interests as a way to avoid &quot;continual conflict and tension with the block and European standards&quot;. 
*/ In November 2002, then-French President and then-President of the European Convention Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing said in an interview with the French newspaper Le Monde, &quot;Turkey is an important country close to Europe, but it is not a European country. It is not a European country because its capital is not in Europe and 95% of its population lives outside Europe.&quot; he said. Estaing continued as follows: &quot;The Union should now focus on internal financial problems and the construction of European harmony instead of expansion. Those who most support Turkey joining the Union are actually opponents of the European Union. In fact, the majority of European Council members are against Turkey joining, but the Turks were never told this. Turkey joining the European Union would mean the end of the European Union.&quot;
* The 2005 EU Progress Report stated that: &quot;On 29 July 2005, Turkey signed the Additional Protocol adapting the EC Turkey Association Agreement to the accession of 10 new countries on 1 May 2004. At the same time, Turkey issued a declaration stating that the signature of the Additional Protocol did not amount to recognition of the Republic of Cyprus. On 21 September, the EU adopted a counter-declaration indicating that Turkey&#x27;s declaration was unilateral, did not form part of the Protocol, and had no legal effect on Turkey&#x27;s obligations under the Protocol. The EU declaration stressed that recognition of all Member States was a necessary component of the accession process. It also underlined the need for supporting the efforts of the Secretary General of the UN to bring about a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem which would contribute to peace, stability and harmonious relations in the region.&quot;
* In November 2006, the European Commission members decided to suspend parts of the talks with Turkey regarding accession, as Turkish officials said that they will not open Turkish ports to traffic from the Republic of Cyprus until the EU eases its embargo on Turkish-controlled northern Cyprus.
* In 2007, European Commission President José Manuel Barroso said that Turkey is not ready to join the EU &quot;tomorrow nor the day after tomorrow&quot;, but its membership negotiations should continue. He also called on France and other member states to honour the decision to continue accession talks, describing it as a matter of credibility for the Union.
* On 28 June 2007, Portuguese State Secretary for European Affairs Manuel Lobo Antunes affirmed that &quot;Turkey should join the EU once it has successfully completed membership talks, which are likely to run for at least a decade.&quot; &quot;We think it is important and fundamental that Turkey joins the European Union once it fulfils all the conditions and all the criteria,&quot; he said, adding that &quot;Portugal aims in the next six months to &#x27;put the process on track&#x27;.&quot;
* On 5 November 2008, the Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini declared that &quot;the Italian government will support the inclusion of Turkey in the European Union with all its strength.&quot; He indicated that &quot;the Italian Parliament will give a &#x27;clear word&#x27; when necessary with the &#x27;enormous majority&#x27; of the Berlusconi government, but also with &#x27;the opposition&#x27; which it knows it can count on.&quot; &quot;Turkey&#x27;s inclusion will not be a problem, but it will be part of the solution for strengthening Europe in relations with other countries, such as the Caucasus region&quot; he added.
* On 13 November 2008, the Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi urged the EU to &quot;accelerate Turkey&#x27;s membership bid&quot; and pledged to &quot;help Ankara gain accession.&quot; Berlusconi pledged to &quot;try and win over those EU members resistant to Turkey&#x27;s application.&quot; &quot;Regarding the opposition shown by certain countries – some of which are important countries – I am confident we will be able to convince them of the strategic importance of Turkey, within the European framework, as a country bordering the Middle East,&quot; Berlusconi declared.
*/ On 29 May 2009, French President Nicolas Sarkozy cancelled a visit to Sweden scheduled for 2 June 2009, to avoid a clash on the question of Turkey&#x27;s EU membership just a few days before the European elections and a month before Stockholm took over the EU&#x27;s rotating presidency. The French President, who is an outspoken opponent of Turkey&#x27;s entry to the European Union, did not want to highlight the strong divergence of views on this topic with Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt, the French newspaper &quot;Le Monde&quot; reported on 28 May 2009. Sweden favours further EU enlargement, including to Turkey. Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt told the French newspaper &quot;Le Figaro&quot; that &quot;the EU has &#x27;a strategic interest&#x27; in Turkey&#x27;s EU integration and warned against &#x27;closing the door&#x27; to Ankara.&quot; &quot;If we judge Cyprus to be in Europe, although it is an island along Syria&#x27;s shores, it is hard not to consider that Turkey is in Europe,&quot; Bildt said, referring to Sarkozy&#x27;s repeated statements that Turkey is not a European country and does not belong to Europe. In the &quot;Le Figaro&quot; interview, Bildt said: &quot;My vision of Europe is not as defensive as I observe it with other people.&quot; The French president&#x27;s trip to Sweden was cancelled the day after the interview was published. &quot;Nicolas Sarkozy cancelled his visit because of the Carl Bildt interview,&quot; one French minister told &quot;Le Monde&quot;. &quot;The president wanted to avoid a clash on Turkey and did not want that his visit to Sweden interferes with the elections [five days later].&quot; In March 2013, King Carl XVI of Sweden said that &quot;The EU will become stronger with Turkey&quot;
* On 5 April 2009, Spanish Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero stated that &quot;Spain firmly supports Turkey&#x27;s candidature to enter the EU, provided it meets the necessary requisites.&quot; Zapatero told Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan that &quot;Spain&#x27;s position is &#x27;firm, clear and solid&#x27; in favour of Turkey&#x27;s candidature to enter the European Union.&quot; &quot;We must &#x27;open the door&#x27; for Turkey to enter &#x27;the EU peace and cooperation project&#x27;, provided it meets the necessary requisites for integration,&quot; Zapatero added; before remarking that &quot;Turkey&#x27;s entrance is good both for Turkey and for the EU.&quot;
* In November 2009, Greek President Karolos Papoulias stated that he would not support Turkey&#x27;s accession &quot;as long as Ankara behaves as an occupying force in Cyprus.&quot;
* On 4 November 2009, David Miliband, the Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom, during a visit to Turkey underlined the UK government&#x27;s support for Turkey&#x27;s bid to join the European Union, saying: &quot;I am very clear that Turkish accession to the EU is important and will be of huge benefit to both Turkey and the EU.&quot;
* On 27 July 2010, David Cameron, former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, during a visit to Turkey promised to &quot;fight&quot; for Turkey&#x27;s membership of the European Union, saying he is &quot;angry&quot; at the slow pace of negotiations. He added that &quot;a European Union without Turkey at its heart is not stronger but weaker... not more secure but less... not richer but poorer.&quot; On 22 May 2016, Cameron said that &quot;it is not remotely on the cards that Turkey is going to join the EU any time soon. They applied in 1987. At the current rate of progress they will probably get round to joining in about the year 3000 according to the latest forecasts.&quot; 
* On 23 December 2010, President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy he said &quot;Turkish reform efforts have delivered impressive results.&quot; He continued &quot;Turkey plays an ever more active role in its neighbourhood. Turkey is also a full-standing member of the G-20, just like five EU countries and the EU itself. In my view, even before an outcome of the negotiations, the European Union should develop a close partnership with the Turkish Republic.&quot;
* In March 2011, then-Finnish President Tarja Halonen pledged her country&#x27;s full support for Turkey&#x27;s European Union membership process.
* On 3 July 2013, at an election rally of the Christian Democrat Party in Düsseldorf, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble stated that Turkey should not join the European Union as it is not part of Europe.
* On 7 June 2013, Turkey&#x27;s Undersecretary of the Ministry of EU Affairs Haluk Ilıcak said &quot;The process means more than the accession. Once the necessary levels are achieved, Turkey is big enough to continue its development without the accession. Our aim is to achieve a smooth accession process.&quot;
* In 2013, Czech Republic Prime Minister Petr Nečas said: &quot;We continue to believe that Turkey should be given the chance to become a full-fledged member of the European Union after it meets all accession criteria&quot;. He described Turkey as an important partner to the EU and praised the constructive role it plays in the Middle East region.
* In March 2016, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said that democracy and freedom were &quot;phrases&quot; which had &quot;absolutely no value&quot; in Turkey, after calling for journalists, lawyers and politicians to be prosecuted as terrorists. 
* In July 2016, European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini announced that EU membership negotiations would be terminated if the death penalty was reinstated in Turkey. 
* In August 2016, then-Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern called for the suspension of full membership negotiations between the EU and Turkey.
* In March 2017, in a speech given to supporters in the western Turkish city of Sakarya, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said &quot;my dear brothers, a battle has started between the cross and the half moon&quot; (referring to Christianity and Islam respectively) after insulting European government politicians as &quot;Nazis&quot; in the weeks before. The same month, he threatened that Europeans would &quot;not be able to walk safely on the streets&quot; if they kept up banning Turkish ministers from addressing rallies in Europe. European politicians rejected Erdoğan&#x27;s comments.
* In the context of the imminent Turkish constitutional referendum in April 2017, the Vice President of the European Parliament, Alexander Graf Lambsdorff, summarized the state of affairs as this: &quot;In law Turkey is still a candidate, in fact, it is not. Nobody believes in Brussels or in Ankara for that matter that Turkey will eventually join the European Union. And that is why we say it is better to make a new start and put the relationship on a new foundation.&quot;
* In a TV debate in September 2017, then-German chancellor Angela Merkel and her then challenger Martin Schulz both said that they would seek an end to Turkey&#x27;s membership talks with the European Union.
* In September 2017, then-Finnish foreign minister Timo Soini, announced that they were in favor of not stopping Turkey&#x27;s membership negotiations with the European Union. 
* In December 2017, then-Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz announced that they were in favor of stopping Turkey&#x27;s accession negotiations with the European Union. 
* On 17 July 2018, then-Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, in an interview with the Greek newspaper Kathimerini, called for ending full membership negotiations between the EU and Turkey and developing relations instead of full membership negotiations. Kurz said: &quot;I have been speaking out for years about developing an honest relationship with Turkey.&quot; Kurz continued as follows: &quot;EU membership negotiations with Turkey should be stopped immediately. Turkey has continuously moved away from Europe and its values over the last few years. We should also focus on exploring other forms of cooperation between our neighbors the EU and Turkey.&quot;
* In September 2023, Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer, in an interview with the German newspaper Die Welt, called for the termination of full membership negotiations between the EU and Turkey and the development of a new concept within the relations between the EU and Turkey.
* In September 2023, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan announced that the European Union was well into a rupture in its relations with Turkey and that they could part ways, if necessary, during Turkey&#x27;s European Union membership process.
* On 17 December 2024, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, in his meeting with President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, stated that they wanted to open a new page in EU-Turkey relations, that Turkey&#x27;s EU accession negotiations were a strategic goal, that the customs union should be updated again, and that visa liberalization negotiations should be resumed. He announced that they expect the EU-Turkey summit to be held as soon as possible.

<text>The blind mole-rats, also known as the fossorial or subterranean mole rats, are a subfamily (Spalacinae) of rodents in the family Spalacidae, found in eastern Europe and western and central Asia. The hystricognath mole-rats of the family Bathyergidae are completely unrelated, but some other forms are also in the family Spalacidae. Zokors (subfamily Myospalacinae), root rats, and bamboo rats (subfamily Rhizomyinae) are spalacids also sometimes referred to as mole rats.

Blind mole-rats are in the family Spalacidae, but are unique enough to be given a separate subfamily, Spalacinae. Alternate opinions on taxonomy consider the blind mole-rats to be the only members of the family Spalacidae and rank other spalacid subfamilies as full families. Other authors group all members of the superfamily Muroidea into a single family, Muridae. The Spalacinae contains two genera and eight species. Some authorities treat all species as belonging to a single genus, &quot;Spalax&quot;, but more recent studies indicate a deep divergence between both lineages dating back to the Late Miocene, supporting them as being distinct genera.&quot;&quot;

Spalacinae mole-rats are truly blind. Their very small eyes are completely covered by a layer of skin. Unlike many other fossorial rodents, blind mole-rats do not have enlarged front claws and do not appear to use their forearms as a primary digging tool. Digging is almost exclusively conducted using their powerful front teeth, which are separated from the rest of the mouth by a flap of skin. When a blind mole-rat closes its mouth, its incisors are still on the outside. Blind mole-rats may have evolved from spalacids that used their front limbs to dig, because their olecranon processes are large relative to the rest of their arms. The olecranon process is a part of the ulna bone where muscles attach, and digging animals tend to have enlarged olecranon processes to provide a large surface for their large and powerful muscles to attach.

Because they are completely blind, blind mole-rats have been important laboratory animals in tests on how eyes and eye proteins function. Although blind mole-rats have only atrophied subcutaneous eyes and are sightless, their circadian rhythm is kept. A few publications, such as Avivi &quot;et al.&quot;, 2002, have proven that the circadian genes that control the biological clock are expressed in a similar manner as in sighted, above-ground mammals.

<text>Galeries Lafayette () is an upmarket French department store chain, the biggest in Europe. Its flagship store is on Boulevard Haussmann in the 9th arrondissement of Paris but it now operates a number of locations in France and other countries. In 2019, Galeries Lafayette recorded earnings of over five billion euros. It is a part of the company Groupe Galeries Lafayette and has been a member of the International Association of Department Stores since 1960.

== History ==
In 1894, Théophile Bader and his cousin Alphonse Kahn opened a fashion store in a small haberdasher&#x27;s shop at the corner of rue La Fayette and the Chaussée d&#x27;Antin, in Paris. In 1896, their company purchased the entire building at 1 rue La Fayette; in 1905 they acquired the buildings at 38, 40 and 42 boulevard Haussmann and 15 rue de la Chaussée d&#x27;Antin. Bader commissioned the architect Georges Chedanne and his pupil Ferdinand Chanut to design the store at the Haussmann location, where a glass and steel dome and Art Nouveau staircases were finished in 1912.

From 1921 Maurice Dufrêne directed the &quot;Maîtrise&quot; workshop of the &quot;Galeries Lafayette&quot;.
This workshop for decorative art and furniture followed the &quot;Primavera&quot; of the Printemps store founded in 1912 by René Guilleré, Paul Follot&#x27;s &quot;Pomone&quot; of , and the &quot;Studium&quot; of the Grands Magasins du Louvre.

In 2018, twenty-two stores in small and mid-sized French cities were turned into franchises and sold to FIB (Financière Immobilière Bordelaise) a company owned by Michel Ohayon. The decision to convert the stores to franchises was done as Galeries Lafayette wanted to focus on expansion internationally and online.

During 2021 eleven stores were franchised with seven sold to &quot;Société des Grands Magasins&quot; and the three sold to &quot;FIB&quot; who previously took over twenty two stores in 2018. The eleventh store in Avignon was given to Philippe Sempéré and Nicolas Chambon who also operate the Béziers store.

As of 2022, Galeries Lafayette has opened over 50 stores (including subsidiarised stores) in France alone along with twelve outlet stores.

== Paris Haussmann ==

Galeries Lafayette Haussmann, the flagship store, is located on Boulevard Haussmann in the 9th arrondissement of Paris, near Opera Garnier, at the corner of Rue La Fayette, close to Chaussée d&#x27;Antin – La Fayette Paris Métro station. It is a fashion flagship store. A wide range of brands are available at the store to suit all budgets, from ready to wear to haute couture. The architecture of the store is art nouveau, with a remarkable dome and a panoramic view of Paris that has made it a tourist attraction of the French capital city. Galeries Lafayette in Paris hosts a popular weekly fashion show for visitors.

=== History ===
In 1893, Théophile Bader and Alphonse Kahn opened a store in Paris, on the corner of rue La Fayette and rue de la Chaussée d’Antin, selling novelty gifts. In 1896, the company purchased the entire building at number 1, rue La Fayette followed in 1903 by numbers 38, 40, and 42 on Boulevard Haussmann, as well as number 15, rue de la Chaussée d’Antin.

==== Aryanization during Nazi occupation ====
During Nazi occupation of France in 1940, Les Galeries Lafayette underwent a process of &quot;Aryanization&quot;, that is the removal of Jewish owners and their replacement by non-Jewish owners. Théophile Bader, Raoul Meyer, Max Heilbronn, the store&#x27;s administrators and 129 Jewish employees were forced to resign. The property of Bader, Meyer and Heilbronn families was taken.

The Galeries Lafayette group was transferred to non-Jewish Svedberg owners: the Swiss Aubert and the French industrialist Harlachol.

==== Architecture ====
Théophile Bader appointed the architect Georges Chedanne to head up the first major renovations which were completed in 1907. Ferdinand Chanut, Georges Chedanne&#x27;s apprentice, designed the store&#x27;s high Neo Byzantine dome. This store&#x27;s inauguration ceremony took place in October 1912.

In 1932, the store was renovated with an Art Déco style by an architect named Pierre Patou.

==== Fashion and events ====
Théophile Bader acquired production facilities in order to make clothing exclusively for Galeries Lafayette under its own private label. He also manufactured affordable versions of designer wear.

This store then expanded to include menswear, furniture, toys and tableware departments and get involved in organizing events such as the rooftop landing by French pilot Jules Védrines in 1919.

In 1922, it opened arts workshops under the artistic direction of Maurice Dufrêne in order to produce affordable furniture, fabric, carpets, wallpaper, pottery, and other household goods.

Following the Second World War, the store underwent a complete makeover.

During the 1950s it hosted large international exhibitions, such as &quot;The Best of Italian Manufacturing&quot; in 1953.

In the 1960s, young designers began launching their ready-to-wear lines at the store. The first designer to become famous was Laura, in 1962. A little while later she went on to become known as Sonia Rykiel.

From 1980 to 1999 &quot;Fashion Festivals&quot;, were organized, in order to select designs for the store. In 1984, the store opened a designer department including designs from, Jean-Paul Gaultier and Thierry Mugler.

From 2001 to 2015, Jean-Paul Goude collaborated with the brand on advertising campaigns in order to give the store a modern identity.

<text>Pop &#x27;Im Pop! is a 1950 Warner Bros. &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; theatrical cartoon short directed by Robert McKimson and written by Warren Foster. The short was released on October 28, 1950, and stars Sylvester the Cat, Hippety Hopper and Sylvester Jr., in the latter&#x27;s first appearance.

== Plot ==
A circus features the attraction &quot;Gracie, the Fightin&#x27; Kangaroo!&quot;. When Gracie goes off to perform, she leaves her young son, Hippety Hopper, alone in her dressing room. Hippety slips on a pair of his mother&#x27;s boxing gloves, and wanders off (along the way, treading in wet cement, much to the anger of the workman who is paving the new sidewalk, falling into a pink dress and causing several cars to crash).

Meanwhile, Sylvester is bragging to his son about how he took on a mouse about his own size. Hippety shows up behind him, frightening Sylvester. Junior urges Sylvester to fight Hippety, as they both think he&#x27;s a giant mouse, and says that if he doesn&#x27;t, he&#x27;ll &quot;disillusion a child&#x27;s faith in his father.&quot; The result is a fight between Hippety and Sylvester. Hippety wins at first, but then Sylvester chases him off with an axe. Along the way, they pass the workman, who treads in his own cement as if daring the participants in the chase to do the same – but when they do not, he stands in the center of the sidewalk and plays &quot;Taps&quot; on a bugle as he sinks.

Sylvester is led to the circus, and right when Junior enters his sight, he starts gloating again Sylvester says he wished Hippety was twice as big, with 4 arms and 2 heads. Ironically, Gracie comes out with Hippety in her pouch, causing both the cats to run off. Hippety gives them a friendly wave good-bye.

== Cast ==
* Mel Blanc as Sylvester, Sylvester Jr., Carny Barker, and Stage Manager.

== Legacy ==
Gracie makes a brief cameo during the final scene of &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; with several other Looney Tunes characters. She is colored light brown in the film.

<doc id="1283050" wikidata="Q784514" url="?curid=1283050" title="Clerks II">
<text>Clerks II is a 2006 American black comedy film written and directed by Kevin Smith, the sequel to his 1994 film &quot;Clerks&quot;, and his sixth feature film to be set in the View Askewniverse. The film stars Brian O&#x27;Halloran, Jeff Anderson, Rosario Dawson, Trevor Fehrman, Jennifer Schwalbach Smith, Jason Mewes, and Smith, and picks up with the original characters from &quot;Clerks&quot;: Dante Hicks, Randal Graves and Jay and Silent Bob ten years after the events of the first film. Unlike the first film, which was shot in black and white, this film was shot mostly in color.

The film screened out of competition at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival and won the Audience Award at the 2006 Edinburgh International Film Festival before receiving a theatrical release on July 21, 2006 to critical and commercial success, grossing $27 million worldwide from a $5 million budget. A third film was released in 2022.

== Plot ==
Ten years after the events of the first film, Dante Hicks arrives at the Quick Stop convenience store for another day of work, only to find, upon opening the security shutters, that the store is on fire. Randal Graves, Dante&#x27;s best friend, had left the coffee pot on after closing the night before. Because Quick Stop and the adjacent RST Video have been destroyed in the fire, Dante and Randal begin working at a Mooby&#x27;s fast food restaurant along with devout Christian teenager Elias Grover and their manager Becky Scott.

A year later, Dante is planning to leave his minimum wage lifestyle and move to Florida with his wealthy but overbearing fiancée Emma Bunting, whose parents will provide them with a home and a car wash business to run as wedding gifts. Afraid of losing his best friend, Randal becomes resentful towards Dante and Emma&#x27;s relationship. Jay and Silent Bob have followed Dante and Randal, and now loiter outside of Mooby&#x27;s. Although they no longer use drugs (after being arrested for possession, sent to rehab, and supposedly becoming devout Born again Christians), the duo continue to sell them and perform their typical antics in the parking lot.

Dante tells Becky that he is worried about dancing at his wedding, so she takes him up to the restaurant&#x27;s roof to teach him some moves. Dante soon releases his inhibitions and begins dancing to The Jackson 5&#x27;s &quot;ABC&quot;. When the song ends, Dante, caught up in the moment, confesses his love for Becky, and she reveals that she&#x27;s pregnant as a result of a one-night stand they had at work a few weeks prior. Becky tells Dante not to tell anyone about the baby. However, he tells Randal but threatens to beat Randal up should he tell anyone. Becky finds out and, furious at Dante for telling Randal, drives off.

Randal encourages Dante to leave Mooby&#x27;s in search of Becky, so he can set up a surprise going away party for him. Randal hires &quot;Kinky Kelly and the Sexy Stud,&quot; a donkey show act, complete with a fog machine, for the party. When Dante returns, he mistakes the fog for fire and calls the fire department, but upon discovering that it&#x27;s not a fire, proceeds to watch with Randal, Jay, Silent Bob, and a very drunk/stoned Elias.

The group discovers that &quot;Kinky Kelly&quot; is, in fact, the donkey, while the man, whom Randal thought to be the pimp, is &quot;The Sexy Stud&quot;. When Becky returns, she admits that she too loves Dante. As they kiss, Emma arrives with a cake she made for Dante. She throws her engagement ring at Becky, dumps the cake over Dante&#x27;s head, knees him in the crotch, and storms off in tears.

The fire and police departments arrive and Dante, Randal, Elias, Jay, Silent Bob, and The Sexy Stud are arrested as a result of the show. In their jail cell, Dante gets into a heated argument with Randal, angry with him for ruining his life and expresses his eagerness to start a new life without him, while Randal becomes indignant and condemns Dante for his willingness to live his life under the standards of others and for abandoning their friendship, revealing how upset he is that Dante is moving away. The two then finally realize how much they care about their friendship.

Randal proposes that they buy the Quick Stop and re-open it themselves, although Dante says that neither have the money to do it. Jay and Silent Bob offer to lend them the money (from the royalty money they collected from the &quot;Bluntman and Chronic&quot; movie in &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot;) provided that they can hang out outside of the store anytime they want without the police being called. Randal accepts their offer, but Dante is uncertain, prompting Randal to emotionally confess his fear of losing Dante. Moved by Randal&#x27;s confession, Dante agrees to the proposition. Shortly after, the group is released off-screen without being charged since (as the Sexy Stud had assured them) you can&#x27;t be imprisoned for watching an inter-species sex act.

Soon afterwards, Dante, having embraced fatherhood, proposes to Becky at Mooby&#x27;s, who happily accepts. After both the Quick Stop and RST Video are rebuilt, Dante and Randal hire Elias to work at RST Video.

In the very last scene, with the stores open, Dante tells Randal, both having finally taken control of their lives, &quot;Can you feel it? Today is the first day of the rest of our lives.&quot; The color then evaporates from the film and the camera pulls back to reveal the milk maid from the first movie still going through all the gallons.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
In 1999, the original title was slated to be &quot;Clerks 2: Hardly Clerkin″&quot; (cf. Jerry Lewis&#x27;s &quot;Hardly Working&quot;), as seen in the credits of &quot;Dogma&quot;. Smith later modified the title to &quot;The Passion of the Clerks&quot;, lampooning the title of Mel Gibson&#x27;s &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot;. According to the DVD documentary, the title was changed to simply &quot;Clerks II&quot;, due to negative reaction to the &quot;Passion&quot; title. The film was shot from September to November 2005. It was originally scheduled for a 2005 release, and then a January 2006 release, but the production was pushed back due to other projects and Kevin Smith&#x27;s involvement in the romantic comedy &quot;Catch and Release&quot;.

Smith released production diaries on the &quot;Clerks II&quot; website (see links below). They chronicle the entire making of the film from the first rehearsals all the way through to the final release. Some of these web diaries are also available on the two-disc DVD of the film. Smith released a Web-only teaser trailer on the &quot;Clerks II&quot; website on January 9, 2006, and a web-only trailer on April 2, 2006. Smith also released several shorts featuring action figures from his previous films to promote the film.

Before the release of the film, Smith had mentioned releasing an MP3 file commentary to be downloaded and listened to in movie theaters via iPod. Ultimately, theater owners and exhibitors objected, and the plan was scrapped. The abandoned commentary, featuring Smith, Scott Mosier and Jeff Anderson, is included on the DVD.

The bookend Quick Stop scenes are in black and white (to simulate the original visual style of &quot;Clerks&quot;), while the rest of the film is in color. Smith has said that much of the film&#x27;s color was desaturated almost to the point where the film had a similar texture to the first film. The contrast in color saturation used can be seen in the &quot;ABC&quot; sequence in which a more vibrant and saturated color temperature is used to give a warm and sunny look that adds to the playful nature of the piece.

On the film&#x27;s MySpace account, a contest was held in which the first 10,000 MySpace users who added &quot;Clerks II&quot; as a friend would have their name in the theatrical and DVD end credits; the list follows the View Askew and Weinstein Company logos. The names are not present in the credits on the Region 2 DVD.

=== Locations ===
The Mooby&#x27;s restaurant was a shut-down Burger King at 8572 Stanton Ave in Buena Park, California (near Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm), that has since been demolished. The final days of principal photography were filmed at the Quick Stop and RST Video store in Leonardo, New Jersey, with some exceptions, the most notable being the go-kart scene, which was shot at Speedzone in Industry, California. The opening sequence where Randal and Dante are driving to work is a montage of Route 35, mostly in Middletown, New Jersey.

=== Casting ===
Brian O&#x27;Halloran, Jeff Anderson, Jason Mewes, and Kevin Smith all reprised their roles from the first film.

According to the DVD commentary, Kevin Smith originally wanted to cast his wife Jennifer Schwalbach Smith as Becky. Executive producer Harvey Weinstein objected, however, wanting a known actress to play the role for marketing reasons. Other actresses that Smith had met with were Sarah Silverman and Bryce Dallas Howard who both declined. Smith recalls having lunch with Howard who said she was interested in the film but ultimately passed in order to do &quot;Lady in the Water&quot;. Silverman said she didn&#x27;t want to play the Becky character as she had been cast as girlfriends in numerous other productions and feared type-casting, but loved the script and would have been more than willing to play the part of Randal Graves. Rachel Weisz was another name the studio considered, but Smith figured she would turn the role down and never offered her the part. Ellen Pompeo expressed an interest but could not commit due to scheduling difficulties with &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;. Finally, the role was offered to Rosario Dawson who loved the script. She later said that reading the &quot;donkey show&quot; scene sealed the deal for her. Schwalbach Smith was given the secondary female role of Emma Bunting. Smith also cast his daughter Harley Quinn Smith as the little girl Dante waves to in the window of a restaurant and his mother Grace as the Milk Maid, reprising her role from the first film. Walt Flanagan makes a cameo appearance as a customer who asks for a &quot;pack of cigarettes&quot; (after the film changes from color to black and white), in a nod to the first film as well.

The character of Elias was played by Trevor Fehrman who had previously worked in Anderson&#x27;s film &quot;Now You Know&quot;. Smith saw him in the film and was impressed enough to give him a part. In keeping with Smith&#x27;s tradition of casting actors that he has previously worked with, both Jason Lee and Ben Affleck had parts in the film. Lee played Lance Dowds and Affleck played a random Mooby&#x27;s customer. After finding no one else who could pull off being the Sexy Stud, Smith turned to crew member Zak Knutson to fill the role.

== Release ==
=== Rating ===
The film was originally planned to be released without an MPAA film rating, in order to avoid receiving an NC-17. Smith claimed &quot;If we put it in front of the ratings board they&#x27;d be like, &#x27;You&#x27;re insane. We have to create a new rating for that.&#x27;&quot; However, he later submitted it, and it received an R rating without any edits.

=== Box office ===
The film opened in 2,150 theaters and grossed $10.1 million domestically in its first weekend. The film&#x27;s theatrical gross was $24.1 million domestically, plus an additional $2.8 million from other territories foreign, against its production budget of $5 million.

==Reception==
&quot;Clerks II&quot; holds a 63% approval rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 166 reviews with an average rating of 6.10/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Clerks II&quot; dishes up much of the graphic humor and some of the insight that made the 1994 original a cult hit.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 65 out of 100, based on 29 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

In a review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, A. O. Scott wrote that: Justin Chang&#x27;s review at &quot;Variety&quot; called it a &quot;softer, flabbier and considerably higher-budgeted follow-up to Kevin Smith&#x27;s 1994 indie sensation that nevertheless packs enough riotous exchanges and pungent sexual obscenities to make its 97 minutes pass by with ease.&quot;

At an advance screening for critics, Joel Siegel walked out of the film approximately 40 minutes in, during a scene in which the characters attempt to procure a donkey for sexual purposes. Smith claimed on his website that Siegel &quot;bellowed&quot; the phrase &quot;Time to go! This is the first movie I&#x27;ve walked out on in thirty fucking years!&quot; &quot;TV Guide&quot; film critic Maitland McDonagh, who said she was sitting next to Siegel, largely confirms Smith&#x27;s account but insists that Siegel did not curse or &quot;bellow.&quot; However, she reports that he left from the farthest possible exit, thereby making sure everyone noticed his departure. On his blog, Smith criticized Siegel for unprofessional conduct. Cinegeek wrote a profanity-laced tirade in which Stephen and Suzie Lackey referred to the critic performing sexual acts on director M. Night Shyamalan in regard to his praise for &quot;The Village&quot; before having seen it. Smith later confronted Siegel in a live interview on &quot;Opie and Anthony&quot;; Siegel apologized for cursing and causing a scene, and told Smith that he thinks he is a &quot;fine filmmaker,&quot; while still defending his decision to walk out.

British presenter and film critic Jonathan Ross has been largely critical of the film, saying he disliked it even more than the first film; he expressed distaste that the film was voted by viewers of his &quot;Film 2006&quot; show into the top ten of the year, in which it ranked sixth. It was voted the third-funniest film of 2006 by IMDb users and the ninth-best reviewed comedy by Rotten Tomatoes.

The film received an eight-minute standing ovation at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival.

== Soundtrack ==

After the conclusion of the high definition optical disc format war in February 2008, &quot;Clerks II&quot; was released on Blu-ray Disc on February 3, 2009 with two additional special features.

== Sequel ==

On February 9, 2017, Smith revealed on Facebook that although a script had been completed, &quot;Clerks III&quot; had been cancelled as &quot;one of the four leads opted out of the flick&quot;. He later revealed that Jeff Anderson was the one who opted out. On October 1, 2019, Smith announced on Instagram that &quot;Clerks III&quot; was happening and that Anderson agreed to reprise his role as Randal. 

Principal photography began on August 2, 2021 in Red Bank, New Jersey. Filming wrapped on August 31, 2021. The film was released on September 13, 2022 in the United States by Lionsgate (whose film studio acquired the catalogue of The Weinstein Company from Spyglass Media Group and now owns &quot;Clerks II&quot;, although the rights to the first &quot;Clerks&quot; are with Paramount Pictures through their ownership of the Miramax film library) and Fathom Events.

<doc id="1283067" wikidata="Q3773358" url="?curid=1283067" title="Good God's Urge">
<text>Good God&#x27;s Urge is the second and final studio album by American alternative rock band Porno for Pyros. It was released in 1996 on Warner Bros. It was the band&#x27;s first album to feature bass guitarist Mike Watt, who assisted the band in finishing the album after Martyn LeNoble left before all his bass tracks had been completed. There were three singles released from the album.

In addition to Watt, many guest musicians lent their musical talents to various songs. &quot;Porpoise Head&quot; featured Daniel Ash, David J and Kevin Haskins from Bauhaus, Love and Rockets and the Bubblemen. &quot;Good God&#x27;s Urge&quot; also marked a reunion of ex-Jane&#x27;s Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro, who played guitar on the album track &quot;Freeway.&quot; The song also featured Navarro&#x27;s Red Hot Chili Peppers bandmate, Flea.

Farrell&#x27;s then-girlfriend, Christine Cagle, appeared on the album cover. Photographer John Eder described the photoshoot as &quot;increasingly chaotic and weird&quot;, and said the cover was one of the last shots of the night.

The album was devised over a two-year &quot;surf trip&quot; that saw the band visiting places like Tahiti, Indonesia, Samoa, Costa Rica, and Mexico, leading to a more acoustic and less hard rock sound. The trips doubled as occasions for the band to detox from their severe drug addictions, which informed the lyrics of songs like &quot;Porpoise Head&quot; and &quot;Tahitian Moon&quot;. Recording took place at Shangri-La in Malibu, California.

LeNoble left the band before recording completed due to drug addiction and clashes with Farrell, who was growing increasingly paranoid from crack cocaine use. LeNoble was frustrated with the business structure of Porno for Pyros, set up as a company with Farrell as the sole owner, thus depriving the other band members of publishing rights. LeNoble was hospitalised after he left due to the severity of his drug addiction.

Porno for Pyros went on a hiatus shortly after the tour (featuring Watt on bass) promoting the album&#x27;s release due to guitarist Peter DiStefano cancer diagnosis. They were set to reform in 2019 to perform at singer Farrell&#x27;s birthday celebration, but those plans were scrapped due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Good God&#x27;s Urge-era lineup of Farrell, DiStefano, Perkins, and Watt performed in 2020 as part of a Lollapalooza webcast, and in 2022 as part of the Welcome to Rockville festival.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Trouser Press&quot; wrote that &quot;while he helpfully turns the attack down to an alluringly cool semi-acoustic breeze on parts of &quot;Good God’s Urge&quot;, Farrell can’t improve his obnoxious personality, which renders the album another love-it/hate- it proposition.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;the music gets atmospheric, experimental and interesting.&quot; &quot;CMJ New Music Monthly&quot; called the record &quot;more pleasantly stoned than the first album.&quot;

<text>A season pass is a form of video game monetization in which consumers purchase a discounted package for current and future downloadable content (DLC) and/or expansion packs for a video game atop its base cost. A game may have a single season pass or, for some lifestyle games, new season passes over time. The name originates from the concept of a season pass/ticket for sports (although more akin to acquiring the box set of a season from a TV series). First introduced around 2011, the use of season passes became commonplace among triple-A and mobile game publishers by the end of the 2010s. Season passes can be controversial because the contents of a season pass are not fully itemized beforehand or may not contain all planned DLC, with some instances of season passes being called scams by the gaming press.

== Approach ==
Season passes may be available to purchase alongside the game prior to its release, or may be available after the game&#x27;s release. Once purchased, the player gains all content that has been released to date under that season pass and eligible for future, unannounced content. Many season passes state the type of content that players will get even though the exact content may be unknown at the time.

Season passes may cover all planned expansion content for a game and represents a one-time purchase. In other cases, season passes cover the content of a game for a limited period of time, on the order of months to years, which allow the developer to continue to add more content in lieu of developing a wholly new title as to continue to draw in revenue. For example, Ubisoft&#x27;s &quot;Rainbow Six Siege&quot; has used annual season passes that give players that purchase them access to new playable characters (&quot;operators&quot;), maps, weapons, and game modes. Some of these elements can be obtained by players without a season pass, using in-game credits, while other content remains exclusive to those with the pass. Ubisoft has considered this a better approach for players rather than developing a sequel. Similarly, &quot;Destiny 2&quot; used an annual pass model for its second year of content, providing players with access to exclusive content through three DLC drops over the course of the year; for the game&#x27;s third year, they switched to a season pass model, with each season&#x27;s seasonal pass available to purchase à la carte. For some games with recurring season passes, content from older passes may become integrated into the base game at no additional cost.

== History ==
One of the first season passes in video games was used by Rockstar Games with &quot;L.A. Noire&quot; in 2011. Later the same month, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment continued the trend with &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, Electronic Arts released their EA Sports Season Ticket in August 2011. By the mid 2010s, season passes had become common in AAA games. By the end of the decade, season passes continued to be offered for many games, although some publishers began to forgo offering them in favor of free DLC due to the negative publicity created by their announcement shortly after release. The rising popularity of loot boxes and Microtransactions at the time also played a role in the decreasing popularity of the season pass, although the gaming press has speculated that this may result in less post-release content overall.

== Controversy ==
Season passes have been criticized for being anti-consumer, as they psychologically pressure customers to spend more money. It is also impossible to know if they are worth buying since they cannot be reviewed until they are released, and the discounts they offer are sometimes offset by poor-quality content that the player would otherwise not have bought. Additionally, if a game performs poorly in the market, the prices of the DLC for it can fall faster than any discount people would have received by immediately buying its season pass.

Andrew Reiner of &quot;Game Informer&quot; called some season passes &quot;scams coming from money-hungry corporations&quot; because so little information is divulged that consumers can be subject to bait-and-switch tactics, like using a lower-quality studio to develop the content, or delaying the content&#x27;s release significantly.

&quot;GamesRadar+&quot; criticized multiplayer season passes as splitting the community of online games, praising games that had instituted a different model that was more dependent on cosmetic DLC rather than downloadable maps, such as &quot;For Honor&quot; and &quot;Titanfall 2&quot;. &quot;Shacknews&quot; criticized a number of games for having disappointing season passes, such as &quot;Evolve&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

<text>Li Fang-Kuei (; 20 August 190221 August 1987) was a Chinese linguist known for his studies of the varieties of Chinese, his reconstructions of Old Chinese and Proto-Tai, and his documentation of Dene languages in North America.

==Biography==
Li Fang-Kuei was born on 20 August 1902 in Guangzhou during the final years of the Qing dynasty to a minor scholarly family from Xiyang, a small town in Shanxi roughly south of Yangquan. Li&#x27;s father Li Guangyu () received his imperial examination degree in 1880, and served in minor official posts in the late 19th to early 20th century.

Li was one of the first Chinese people to study linguistics outside China. Originally a student of medicine, he switched to linguistics when he went to the United States in 1924. He earned a BA in linguistics at the University of Michigan in 1926 after only two years of study. He then did graduate study under Edward Sapir at the University of Chicago, where he was Sapir&#x27;s first graduate student. From Sapir he learned phonetics, field methods, and American Indian languages. Sapir also encouraged him to study East and Southeast Asian languages, leading to his work on Thai and Sino-Tibetan. Li was also a student of Leonard Bloomfield at this time, from whom Li learned Germanic linguistics and textual analysis. Li also studied Indo-European linguistics, especially Greek and Latin, from Carl Darling Buck at Chicago, and in 1928 Buck secured a 6-month fellowship at Harvard University for him, where he studied Sanskrit and Tibetan.

Li conducted field studies of the indigenous languages of the Americas. His first exposure to fieldwork was his study of the Mattole language of northern California. He received an MA in 1927 and a PhD in 1928. His dissertation &quot;Mattole: An Athabaskan Language&quot; was published in 1930. Following the completion of his PhD, Li traveled to Europe during 1928–1929 with letters of recommendation from Franz Boas, and visited linguists there including Walter Simon. Li also spent 3 months in 1929 in Canada&#x27;s Northwest Territories, living on an island in the middle of the Mackenzie River conducting fieldwork on the Hare language.

After his fieldwork on Hare, in 1929 he returned to China and, along with Y. R. Chao and Luo Changpei, became a researcher at the Institute of History and Philology () of the Academia Sinica then located at Beijing. From this point on, he performed field studies of several Tai languages, including the Longzhou and Wuming dialects spoken by the Zhuang people, while at the same time conducting deep investigations into Old Chinese and Tibetan. Li&#x27;s revisions of Bernhard Karlgren&#x27;s reconstructions of Middle Chinese and Old Chinese were widely used by students of ancient Chinese from their publication in the 1970s until the late 1990s.

Li taught Chinese language and linguistics at Yale University from 1938 to 1939, and after World War II taught at Harvard University from 1946 to 1948. During the same period he was working on a dictionary at the Harvard–Yenching Institute, followed by another year teaching at Yale from 1948 to 1949, where his students included Nicholas Bodman. In 1949, he became professor of Chinese at the University of Washington, where he taught from 1949 to 1969, after which he taught at the University of Hawaiʻi until his retirement in 1974. In 1977, he published a comparative reconstruction of Tai languages, the result of more than forty years of research. He also worked at Academia Sinica, now in Taiwan, in 1973.

Li died in San Mateo County, California, survived by his wife Xu Ying () and their daughter Lindy Li Mark, a professor of anthropology who taught at California State University, Hayward and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, as well as their son Peter Li and daughter Annie Li. His alma mater Tsinghua University began to publish his complete works in 2005.

<text>Propria Cures (Latin for &quot;Mind your own business&quot;) is a Dutch satirical student newspaper, published biweekly in Amsterdam. Established in 1890, it is one of the oldest student newspapers in the Netherlands. It is principally concerned with Dutch literature, media and politics. Since its establishment, &quot;Propria Cures&quot; (colloquially, &quot;PC&quot;) has been a forum for freethinkers, bohemians and rising talents.

&quot;PC&quot; specialises in printing what no one else is willing or able to say, leading, over the years, to a number of quarrels and incidents. &quot;PC&quot; was banned during World War II. In 1958, editor Herbert Leupen wrote a critical obituary for Pope Pius XII, and, as a result, was kidnapped by a group of Catholic students from Delft. &quot;Propria Cures&quot; also became one of the few journals in post-war Dutch publishing history to have been convicted of blasphemy, when in 1965, the newspaper published a fictional interview with Jesus, referring to him as a &quot;carpenter&#x27;s son who pulled himself up through active self-help&quot;. The newspaper was fined 100 guilders. In 1975, printers refused to publish a drawing by Aat Velthoen showing Dutch prime minister Joop den Uyl having intercourse with Queen Juliana. Two pages of the newspaper remained empty. A week later, &quot;PC&quot; found another printer, willing to publish the drawing. In 1992, &quot;Propria Cures&quot; published a photo montage of writer Leon de Winter lying in a mass grave, expressing the opinion that De Winter was exploiting his Jewish background. &quot;PC&quot; was convicted in court and had to pay 10,000 guilders in damages as well as publish an apology.

&quot;PC&quot; employs a large number of guest editors in addition to its regular staff. Its editors have often gone on to become well-known Dutch writers, media figures or politicians after their tenure, and have included figures like polemicist Menno ter Braak, poet and novelist J. Slauerhoff, Godfried Bomans, Hella Haasse, Hugo Brandt Corstius, sociologist Abram de Swaan, or former EU Commissioner Frits Bolkestein. Guest editors have included Willem Frederik Hermans, Karel van het Reve, Theo van Gogh, Youp van &#x27;t Hek, and Herman Koch. the editors of &quot;PC&quot; are Aron Groot, Maarten van Dorp, Alexandra Philippa and Willem Fintelman.

<text>Hóra Sfakíon () or Sfakia (Σφακιά ) is a town on the south coast of Crete, Greece. It is the capital of the remote and mountainous region of Sfakiá, and is a small town of just 322 inhabitants (2021 census). It lies on the south coast near the end of the Imbros Gorge, 74 km south of Chania. It has two small harbours, where the ferry boats from Agia Roumeli dock, which in the summer bring the hikers from the Samaria Gorge to take buses back to the northern coast. From Hóra Sfakíon ferries also go to the nearby coastal town of Loutro and the island Gavdos.

Hóra Sfakíon is a small village with a main harbourfront of tavernas, two minimarkets, a butcher, and a bakery. There is a quiet local beach immediately west of the village, and several pebbly beaches nearby. Hóra Sfakíon has a variety of tourist accommodations: rooms, studios, and apartments. The local economy is based on tourism, fishing, olive-oil production, and sheep and goat herding.

Hóra Sfakíon prospered during the Venetian and Turkish occupations and up to the 18th century carried on a flourishing trade with its own small fleet. It was said to have had a hundred churches, but it suffered badly from wartime bombardment during the Battle of Crete and the Allied evacuation that followed.

Hóra Sfakíon is famous as one of the centers of resistance against the occupying forces of both the Venetians and the Turks. The impenetrable White Mountains to the north combined with the rocky beaches on the south helped the locals fight off all invaders. Anopolis, a village near Hóra Sfakíon, is the birthplace of one of the most celebrated Cretan revolutionaries, Daskalogiannis.

<doc id="1283105" wikidata="Q58863" url="?curid=1283105" title="Wolfgang Kapp">
<text>Wolfgang Kapp (24 July 1858 – 12 June 1922) was a German conservative and nationalist and political activist who is best known for his involvement in the 1920 Kapp Putsch. He spent most of his career working for the Prussian Ministry of Finance and then as director of the Agricultural Credit Institute in East Prussia. During World War I, Kapp was a vocal annexationist and critic of the government&#x27;s policies, which he saw as not aggressive enough. His strong dislike of parliamentary government and the Weimar Republic led him to take a leading role in the 1920 putsch that bears his name. Following the putsch&#x27;s failure to overthrow the German government, Kapp went into exile in Sweden. He returned to Germany in late 1921 to appear in court, but died while under medical care before he could testify.

==Early life==
Kapp was born in New York City where his father Friedrich Kapp, a political activist and later Reichstag delegate for the National Liberal Party, had settled after the failed European revolutions of 1848. In 1870 the family returned to Germany, and Kapp&#x27;s schooling continued in Berlin at the Friedrich Wilhelm Gymnasium. Wolfgang Kapp married Margarete Rosenow in 1884; the couple had three children. Through his wife&#x27;s family, Kapp acquired connections with politically conservative elements. He studied law at the Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen and the Georg-August University of Göttingen, where he became a member of the student organization Corps Hannovera Göttingen. In 1886, he completed his doctorate in law and was appointed to a position in the Prussian Ministry of Finance the same year.

In 1907, through the intercession of his friend Elard von Oldenburg-Januschau, an influential Junker from East Prussia, Kapp took over the lucrative position of director of the East Prussian Agricultural Credit Institute, a post he held until March 1920. He successfully lobbied for the agricultural workers&#x27; movement, peasant settlement and agricultural debt relief, and against strong opposition he founded a non-profit public life insurance company. In 1912 he was elected to the supervisory board of Deutsche Bank. He was also an honorary doctor of the University of Königsberg.

== Political activist ==
During the First World War, Kapp became widely known among the German population as one of the most high-profile advocates of far-reaching German war goals. He called for extensive annexations and high reparations payments from the nations of the Triple Entente. He considered it indispensable that occupied Belgium be permanently linked to the German Empire militarily, economically and politically, that German naval bases be established on the coast of Flanders and that vigorous action be taken against Great Britain.

As a vocal advocate of unrestricted submarine warfare, Kapp came into conflict with Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg, who sought to prevent it out of fear that it would lead to America entering the war. A pamphlet of Kapp&#x27;s published in the early summer of 1916 entitled &quot;The National Circles and the Chancellor&quot; () criticized German foreign and domestic policy under Bethmann Hollweg. The pamphlet evoked an indignant reply from Bethmann Hollweg in the Reichstag in which he spoke of &quot;loathsome abuse and slanders&quot;.

In reaction to the Reichstag Peace Resolution of 1917, Kapp and Grand Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz founded the German Fatherland Party (), of which Kapp was briefly the chairman. Through a by-election, he became a member of the last Reichstag of the Empire on 2 Feb 1918 for a constituency in Gumbinnen, East Prussia. Kapp felt the defeat of the First World War as a national disgrace. He became a proponent of the stab-in-the-back myth, the belief that the German army had remained undefeated in the field and was stabbed in the back by Jews and communists at home. He joined the German National People&#x27;s Party (DNVP) in 1919 and participated in the anti-republican National Union ().The members, which included General Erich Ludendorff, Colonel Max Bauer and Captain Waldemar Pabst, were the core group behind the Kapp Putsch that attempted to overthrow the Weimar Republic.

==Putsch==
On 10 March 1920, General Walther von Lüttwitz decided to stage a coup after Reichswehr Minister Gustav Noske relieved him of the command of several Reichswehr divisions. Kapp, who was in Berlin with a delegation from East Prussia, met with Lüttwitz to help plan the coup. On 13 March, the Marinebrigade Ehrhardt, a large Freikorps unit, was able to take control of Berlin’s government quarter after the cabinet of Gustav Bauer and other leading officials fled the city. Kapp declared the government deposed, the Weimar National Assembly and the Prussian government dissolved, then named himself German chancellor and minister president of Prussia and Lüttwitz Reichswehr minister and commander-in-chief of the Reichswehr.

The putsch failed to take hold and was over by 18 March. It collapsed due a general strike, lack of participation by the Reichswehr and the refusal of the majority of government officials to take orders from Kapp. He and Lüttwitz also had differing goals. Kapp wanted a complete overthrow of the government, while Lüttwitz had more limited and personal aims. Kapp handed his offices over to Lüttwitz on 17 March and fled to Sweden.

Lüttwitz went into exile in Hungary then returned to Germany in 1924 after being granted amnesty.

== Exile and death ==
The German government did not ask for Kapp&#x27;s extradition, and he was granted permanent residency in Sweden. The trial against his co-conspirators in the putsch began in December 1921. After Dietrich von Jagow was sentenced to five years in prison, Kapp returned to Germany intending to claim his innocence and that the true criminals were those behind the German Revolution of 1918–1919. Before he could testify, a medical examination in the prison in Leipzig where he was being held found a tumor behind his right eye. He died of cancer shortly after the operation to remove it.

<text>.jobs is a sponsored top-level domain (sTLD) in the Domain Name System of the Internet. As indicated by its name, the domain is restricted to employment-related sites.

The domain was approved by ICANN on April 8, 2005, as part of the second group of new TLD applications submitted in 2004. It was installed in the DNS root in September 2005, and began accepting registrations later in the year.

==Intended use==
The intended use of the domain is for companies and organizations to register some version of their corporate names and use it for a site aimed at those seeking employment with that company, or, &quot;.jobs&quot; can target a specific market. For example, manufacturing.jobs could represent employment for a specific corporation, or market sector.

In 2010, Employ Media LLC applied to ICANN to extend the charter under which Employ Media is authorized to sell the domains. If accepted, Employ Media plans to create hundreds of thousands and perhaps a million new, niche job boards and sell domains such as Chicago.jobs to third parties. The International Association of Employment Web Sites and dozens of other employment services organizations have objected.

It has been suggested that subdomains of other domains, such as &quot;jobs.example.com&quot;, can be used without any new registrations on the part of the companies involved. However, there is no general consensus among companies or industry sectors for any such naming scheme, like there is for the www prefix and other prefixes, so the proponents of argue the domain can gain a market presence by allowing recruiters to communicate a simple, direct URL destination of employment opportunities to job seekers.

In 2013, Employ Media partnered with Cnjobs Technology which is headed by Dr. Renjun Bao to expand to greater China.

<text>The domain name mobi is a generic top-level domain (gTLD) in the Domain Name System (DNS) of the Internet. The name is short for &quot;mobile&quot;.

The domain was approved by ICANN on 11 July 2005, and is managed by the mTLD global registry. It was originally financially backed and sponsored by Google, Microsoft, Nokia, Samsung, Ericsson, Vodafone, T-Mobile, Telefónica Móviles, Telecom Italia Mobile, Orascom Telecom, GSM Association, Hutchison Whampoa, Syniverse Technologies, and Visa, with an executive from each company serving on mTLD&#x27;s board of directors. In February 2010, Afilias acquired mTLD Top-Level Domain Ltd. (known publicly as &quot;dotMobi&quot;). In March 2017, .mobi became an unsponsored generic top-level domain, using the same terms offered to new gTLDs.

==Operation==
DotMobi domain names have been available for registration by the public since 26 September 2006.

dotMobi engaged with the W3C Mobile Web Initiative (MWI) to help formulate the MWI Best Practices for mobile content. The practices outlined a number of ways to achieve good user experiences on mobile Web-enabled devices, and recognized several methods of implementing these practices.

mTLD has released a free testing tool called Ready.mobi (later &quot;mobiForge&quot;) to analyze the mobile readiness of websites. It does a free page analysis and gives a .mobi Ready score from 1 to 5. This report tests the mobile-readiness of the site using dotMobi&#x27;s recommended best practices.

dotMobi does not itself mandate any particular technology, but does recommends that .mobi sites produce user experiences consistent with their guidelines and specifically optimized for mobile phones.

By 2024, the old authoritative WHOIS domain for .mobi had been allowed to expire, which created a vulnerability that included allowing for the creation of fraudulent digital certificates.

===mobiForge===
&quot;mobiForge&quot; is a mobile development and design resource site run dotMobi. mobiForge functions both as a platform to announce product updates to the developer community and discussion forums for each of dotMobi&#x27;s products and services. mobiForge was launched in November 2006 as dev.mobi. It was announced at the Mobile 2.0 Conference in San Francisco, along with the launch of ready.mobi. dev.mobi underwent a major redesign in September 2008 and was rebranded as mobiForge and moved to mobiForge.com

==Reception==
Originally dotMobi focused on promoting the creation of two separate device-dependent World Wide Webs, one desktop-based and the other mobile-based. Because of this, Tim-Berners Lee brought up concerns of excess Internet content redundancy.

Providing content tailored to particular devices can be done by other means than a specific TLD, such as using hostnames within an existing domain, HTTP content negotiation, cascading style sheets, or other forms of adaptation. The popularization of responsive web design has caused the domain name to be relocated for use on mobile services and mobile apps websites.

<doc id="1283119" wikidata="Q1634413" url="?curid=1283119" title="Southern Front (Soviet Union)">
<text>The Southern Front was a front, a formation about the size of an army group of the Soviet Army during the Second World War. The Southern Front directed military operations during the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina in 1940 and then was formed twice after the June 1941 invasion by Germany, codenamed Operation Barbarossa.

During the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina in 1940, the Soviets deployed three armies (12th, 5th and 9th). Altogether the Soviet Southern Front opposing Bessarabia and Bukovina consisted of 32 (or 31) rifle divisions, 2 (or 3) motorised rifle divisions, 6 cavalry divisions, 11 tank brigades, 3 airborne brigades (one in reserve), 14 corps artillery regiments, 16 artillery regiments of the Reserve of the Supreme High Command and 4 heavy artillery divisions. These force totalled around 460,000 men, ca. 12,000 guns and mortars, ca. 3,000 tanks and 2,160 aircraft.

==First Formation==

After the German invasion, the Southern Front was re-created on June 25, 1941 from the forces in the Moscow and Odessa Military Districts, and included the 9th Army. From July 1941 the 44th Fighter Aviation Division was part of the Front&#x27;s air forces. It was commanded by General Ivan V. Tiulenev from June 1941 to August 1941. Lieutenant General Dmitri I. Ryabyshev took over on 30 August 1941 and held command until 5 October, when Colonel General Yakov Cherevichenko took command, until December 1941. During 1941 the Front fought in the border battles in the southern Ukraine, defended Odessa, and then conducted the defense and successful counteroffensive at Rostov-on-Don. 

Lieutenant General Rodion Ia. Malinovsky arrived in December and held the reins until July 1942. In 1942 the Front took part in the Donbass, Barvenko-Lozovaia, and Voronezh-Stalingrad (Volgograd) operations. According to Glantz and Bonn, the Front then suffered a notable failure at the Second Battle of Kharkov. The Front received additional forces from the (disbanded) Southwestern Front on July 12, 1942 and was formally disbanded on July 28, 1942, with the forces transferred to the North Caucasus Front.
=== Commanders ===
* Army General Ivan Tyulenev (21 June 1941 - 20 August 1941), 
* Lieutenant General Dmitry Ryabyshev (30 August 1941 - 5 October 1941),
* Colonel General Yakov Cherevichenko (5 October 1941 - December 1941),
* Lieutenant General Rodion Malinovsky (December 1941 - 28 June 1942).

==Second Formation==

In July 1942, three armies (the 1st, 5th and 7th Reserve Armies) out of the Supreme High Command reserve were moved into the Stalingrad sector and redesignated the 64th, 63rd and 62nd armies respectively. They formed the core of the Stalingrad Front on 12 July. The Stalingrad Front was then divided into the Stalingrad Front, under General Lieutenant V.N. Gordov, and the Southeastern Front, under Colonel General Andrei I. Yeremenko on 7 August 1942 as the Battle of Stalingrad began. Stalin had actually taken the decision to split the two fronts on 3 August at 0300 despite protest from his advisors. The Tsaritsa gully in Stalingrad was the dividing line. Yeremenko&#x27;s new South-Eastern Front included the 51st, 57th, and 64th Armies. They were then re-transformed into the Don and Southwestern Fronts on 28 September with the Southeastern Front becoming the Stalingrad Front (Second Formation).

The Southern Front was re-formed from the Stalingrad Front on January 1, 1943, and Colonel General Andrei I. Yeremenko stayed in command, until February 1943. General Lieutenant Rodion Malinovsky [promoted to Colonel General in February 1943] then filled in until Lieutenant General Fyodor I. Tolbukhin took command in March 1943. Tolbukhin was promoted to Colonel General in April. He would command the Front into 1944. 

On 1 April 1943 Southern Front comprised 
*2nd Guards Army, 
*5th Shock Army, 
*28th Army, 
*44th Army, 
*51st Army, 
*8th Air Army, 
*and a significant number of Front troops. 

Among the Front troops were the 
*3rd Guards Cavalry Corps (5th and 6th Guards, 32nd Cavalry Divisions, 14th Guards Anti-Tank Artillery Regiment, 3rd Guards Separate Anti-Tank Battalion, 64th Guards Mortar Battalion), 
*4th Guards Cavalry Corps (9th and 10th Guards, 30th Cavalry Divisions, 152nd Guards Anti-Tank Artillery Regiment, 4th Guards Separate Anti-Tank Battalion, 68th Guards Mortar Battalion, 255th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment)
* 5th Guards Cavalry Corps (11th and 12th Guards, 63rd Cavalry Divisions, 150th Guards Anti-Tank Artillery Regiment, 5th Guards Separate Anti-Tank Battalion, 72nd Guards Mortar Battalion, 585th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment), 
*3rd Guards Mechanized Corps,
*4th Guards Mechanized Corps, 
*76th Fortified Region, 
*78th Fortified Region, 
*116th Fortified Region.

Southern Front was renamed the 4th Ukrainian Front on October 20, 1943.

=== Commanders ===
* Colonel-General Andrei Yeremenko (January 1, 1943 - February 2, 1943)
* Lieutenant General Rodion Malinovsky (February 2, 1943 - March 22, 1943), Colonel-General since February 12, 
* Colonel General Fyodor Tolbukhin March 22, 1943 - October 20, 1943), Colonel-General since April 28, Army general since September 21

<text>Lawrence Norfolk (born 1963) is a British novelist known for historical works with complex plots and intricate detail.

==Biography==
Though born in London, Norfolk lived in Iraq until 1967 and then in the West Country of England. He read English at King&#x27;s College London and graduated in 1986. He worked briefly as a teacher and later as a freelance writer for reference book publishers.

In 1992 he won the Somerset Maugham Award for his first novel, &quot;Lemprière&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;, about events surrounding the publication, in 1788, of John Lemprière&#x27;s &quot;Bibliotheca Classica&quot; on classical mythology and history.
The novel starts out as a detective story and mixes historical elements with steampunk-style fiction. 
It imagines the writing of Lemprière&#x27;s dictionary as tied to the founding of the British East India Company and the Siege of La Rochelle generations before; it also visits the Austro-Turkish War.

Norfolk based his second novel, &quot;The Pope&#x27;s Rhinoceros&quot;, on the story of an actual animal; see Dürer&#x27;s Rhinoceros. Themes in the work include the lost city of Vineta in the Baltic, the sack of Prato, and the Benin bronze-making culture on the river Niger.

The third novel, &quot;In the Shape of a Boar&quot;, juxtaposes the flight of a Bukovina Jew in World War II with the legend of Atalanta in Calydon.

<text>A hairdresser is a person whose occupation is to cut or style hair in order to change or maintain a person&#x27;s image. This is achieved using a combination of hair coloring, haircutting, and hair texturing techniques. A hairdresser may also be referred to as a &#x27;barber&#x27; or &#x27;hairstylist&#x27;.

==History==

===Ancient hairdressing===

Hairdressing as an occupation dates back thousands of years. Both Aristophanes and Homer, Greek writers, mention hairdressing in their writings.

Many Africans believed that hair is a method to communicate with the Divine Being. It is the highest part of the body and therefore the closest to the divine. Because of this Hairdressers held a prominent role in African communities. The status of hairdressing encouraged many to develop their skills, and close relationships were built between hairdressers and their clients. Hours would be spent washing, combing, oiling, styling and ornamenting their hair. Men would work specifically on men, and women on other women. Before a master hairdresser died, they would give their combs and tools to a chosen successor during a special ceremony.

In ancient Egypt, hairdressers had specially decorated cases to hold their tools, including lotions, scissors and styling materials. Barbers also worked as hairdressers, and wealthy men often had personal barbers within their home. With the standard of wig wearing within the culture, wigmakers were also trained as hairdressers. In ancient Rome and Greece household slaves and servants took on the role of hairdressers, including dyeing and shaving. Men who did not have their own private hair or shaving services would visit the local barbershop. Women had their hair maintained and groomed at their homes. Historical documentation is lacking regarding hairstylists from the 5th century until the 14th century. Hair care service grew in demand after a papal decree in 1092 demanded that all Roman Catholic clergymen remove their facial hair.

===Europe===

The first appearance of the word &quot;hairdresser&quot; is in 17th century Europe, and hairdressing was considered a profession. Hair fashion of the period suggested that wealthy women wear large, complex and heavily adorned hairstyles, which would be maintained by their personal maids and other people, who would spend hours dressing the woman&#x27;s hair. A wealthy man&#x27;s hair would often be maintained by a valet. It was in France where men began styling women&#x27;s hair for the first time, and many of the notable hairdressers of the time were men, a trend that would continue into contemporary times. The first famous male hairdresser was Champagne, who was born in Southern France. Upon moving to Paris, he opened his own hair salon and dressed the hair of wealthy Parisian women until his death in 1658.

Women&#x27;s hair grew taller in style during the 17th century, popularized by the hairdresser Madame Martin. The hairstyle, &quot;the tower,&quot; was the trend with wealthy English and American women, who relied on hairdressers to style their hair as tall as possible. Tall piles of curls were pomaded, powdered and decorated with ribbons, flowers, lace, feathers and jewelry. The profession of hairdressing was launched as a genuine profession when Legros de Rumigny was declared the first official hairdresser of the French court. In 1765 de Rumigny published his book &quot;Art de la Coiffure des Dames&quot;, which discussed hairdressing and included pictures of hairstyles designed by him. The book was a best seller amongst Frenchwomen, and four years later de Rumigny opened a school for hairdressers: Academie de Coiffure. At the school he taught men and women to cut hair and create his special hair designs.

By 1777, approximately 1,200 hairdressers were working in Paris. During this time, barbers formed unions, and demanded that hairdressers do the same. Wigmakers also demanded that hairdressers cease taking away from their trade, and hairdressers responded that their roles were not the same, hairdressing was a service, and wigmakers made and sold a product. de Rumigny died in 1770 and other hairdressers gained in popularity, specifically three Frenchmen: Frederic, Larseueur, and Léonard. Leonard and Larseueur were the stylists for Marie Antoinette. Leonard was her favorite, and developed many hairstyles that became fashion trends within wealthy Parisian circles, including the &quot;loge d&#x27;opera&quot;, which towered five feet over the wearer&#x27;s head. During the French Revolution he escaped the country hours before he was to be arrested, alongside the king, queen, and other clients. Léonard emigrated to Russia, where he worked as the premier hairdresser for Russian nobility.

===19th century===

Parisian hairdressers continued to develop influential styles during the early 19th century. Wealthy French women would have their favorite hairdressers style their hair from within their own homes, a trend seen in wealthy international communities. Hairdressing was primarily a service affordable only to those wealthy enough to hire professionals or to pay for servants to care for their hair. In the United States, Marie Laveau was one of the most famous hairdressers of the period. Laveau, located in New Orleans, began working as a hairdresser in the early 1820s, maintaining the hair of wealthy women of the city. She was a voodoo practitioner, called the &quot;Voodoo Queen of New Orleans,&quot; and she used her connections to wealthy women to support her religious practice. She provided &quot;help&quot; to women who needed it for money, gifts and other favors.

French hairdresser Marcel Grateau developed the &quot;Marcel wave&quot; in the late part of the century. His wave required the use of a special hot hair iron and needed to be done by an experienced hairdresser. Fashionable women asked to have their hair &quot;marceled.&quot; During this period, hairdressers began opening salons in cities and towns, led by Martha Matilda Harper, who developed one of the first retail chains of hair salons, the Harper Method.
===20th century===

Beauty salons became popularized during the 20th century, alongside men&#x27;s barbershops. These spaces served as social spaces, allowing women to socialize while having their hair done and other services such as facials. Wealthy women still had hairdressers visit their home, but, the majority of women visited salons for services, including high-end salons such as Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s Red Door Salon.

Major advancements in hairdressing tools took place during this period. Electricity led to the development of permanent wave machines and hair dryers. These tools allowed hairdressers to promote visits to their salons, over limited service in-home visits. New coloring processes were developed, including those by Eugène Schueller in Paris, which allowed hairdressers to perform complicated styling techniques. After World War I, the bob cut and the shingle bob became popular, alongside other short haircuts. In the 1930s complicated styles came back into fashion, alongside the return of the Marcel wave. Hairdressing was one of the few acceptable professions during this time for women, alongside teaching, nursing and clerical work.

=== Specialties ===

Some hairstylists specialize in particular services, such as colorists, who specialize in coloring hair.

== By country ==

===United States===

Occupationally, hairdressing is expected to grow faster than the average for all other occupations, at 20%. A state license is required for hairdressers to practice, with qualifications varying from state to state. Generally a person interested in hairdressing must have a high school diploma or GED, be at least 16 years of age, and have graduated from a state-licensed barber or cosmetology school. Full-time programs often last 9 months or more, leading to an associate degree. After students graduate from a program, they take a state licensing exam, which often consists of a written test, and a practical test of styling or an oral exam. Hairdressers must pay for licenses, and occasionally licenses must be renewed. Some states allow hairdressers to work without obtaining a new license, while others require a new license. About 44% of hairdressers are self-employed, often putting in 40-hour work weeks, and even longer among the self-employed. In 2008, 29% of hairstylists worked part-time, and 14% had variable schedules. As of 2008, people working as hairdressers totaled about 630,700, with a projected increase to 757,700 by 2018.
== Occupational health hazards ==
Like many occupations, hairdressing is associated with potential health hazards stemming from the products workers use on the job as well as the environment they work in. Many beauty products, such as hair dyes and chemical relaxers, contain hazardous substances like formaldehyde and parabens. These can cause skin irritation, respiratory problems, and long-term health effects, including cancer and reproductive issues. Exposure risks are highly variable throughout the profession due to differences in the physical workspace, such as use of proper ventilation, as well as individual exposures to various chemicals throughout one&#x27;s career. Hairdressers encounter a variety of chemicals on the job due to handling products such as shampoos, conditioners, sprays, chemical straighteners, permanent curling agents, bleaching agents, and dyes. While the U.S. Food and Drug Administration does hold certain guidelines over cosmetic products, such as proper labeling and provisions against adulteration, the FDA does not require approval of products prior to being sold to the public. This leaves opportunity for variations in product formulation, which can make occupational exposure evaluation challenging. However, there are certain chemicals that are commonly found in products used in hair salons and have been the subject of various occupational hazard studies.

=== Formaldehyde ===
Formaldehyde is a chemical used in various industries and has been classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer or IARC as “carcinogenic to humans”. The presence of formaldehyde and methylene glycol, a formaldehyde derivative, have been found in hair smoothing products, such as the Brazilian Blowout. The liquid product is applied to the hair, which is then dried using a blow dryer. Simulation studies as well as observational studies of working salons have shown formaldehyde levels in the air that meet and exceed occupational exposure limits. Variations in observed levels are a function of ventilation used in the workplace as well as the levels of formaldehyde, and its derivatives, in the product itself.

=== Aromatic amines ===
Aromatic amines are a broad class of compounds containing an amine group attached to an aromatic ring. IARC has categorized most aromatic amines as known carcinogens. Their use spans several industries including use in pesticides, medications, and industrial dyes. Aromatic amines have also been found in oxidative (permanent) hair dyes; however due to their potential for carcinogenicity, they were removed from most hair dye formulations and their use was completely banned in the European Union.

Phthalates

Phthalates are a class of compounds that are esters of phthalic acid. Their main use has been as plasticizers, additives to plastic products to change certain physical characteristics. They have also been widely used in cosmetic products as preservatives, including shampoos and hair sprays. Phthalates have been implicated as endocrine disrupting chemicals, compounds that mimic the body&#x27;s own hormones and can lead to dysregulation of the reproductive and neurologic systems as well as changes in metabolism and cell proliferation.

=== Health considerations ===

==== Reproductive ====
Most hairdressers are women of childbearing age, which lends to additional considerations for potential workplace exposures and the risks they may pose. There have been studies linking mothers who are hairdressers with adverse birthing outcomes such as low birth weight, preterm delivery, perinatal death, and neonates who are small for gestational age. However, these studies failed to show a well-defined association between individual risk factors and adverse birthing outcomes. Other studies have also indicated a correlation between professional hairdressing and menstrual dysfunction as well as subfertility. However, subsequent studies did not show similar correlations. Due to such inconsistencies, further research is required.

Oncologic

The International Agency for Research on Cancer or IARC, has categorized occupational exposures of hairdressers and barbers to chemical agents found in the workplace as “&quot;probably carcinogenic to humans&quot;” or category 2A in their classification system. This is due in part to the presence of chemical compounds historically found in hair products that have exhibited mutagenic and carcinogenic effects in animal and in vitro studies. However, the same consistent effects have yet to be fully determined in humans. There have been studies showing a link between occupational exposure to hair dyes and increased risk of bladder in male hairdressers but not females. Other malignancies such as ovarian, breast and lung cancers have also been studied in hairdressers, but the outcomes of these studies were either inconclusive due to potential confounding or did not exhibit an increase in risk.

==== Respiratory ====
Volatile organic compounds have been shown to be the largest inhalation exposure in hair salons, with the greatest concentrations occurring while mixing hair dyes and with use of hair sprays. Other notable respiratory exposures included ethanol, ammonia, and formaldehyde. The concentration of exposure was generally found to be a function of the presence or absence of ventilation in the area in which they were working. Studies have exhibited an increased rate of respiratory symptoms experienced such as cough, wheezing, rhinitis, and shortness of breath among hairdressers when compared to other groups. Decreased lung function levels on spirometry have also been demonstrated in hairdressers when compared to unexposed reference groups.

==== Dermal ====
Contact dermatitis is a common dermatological diagnosis affecting hairdressers. Allergen sensitization has been considered the main cause for most cases of contact dermatitis in hairdressers, as products such as hair dyes and bleaches, as well as permanent curling agents contain chemicals that are known sensitizers. Hairdressers also spend a significant amount of time engaging in wet work with their hands being directly immersed in water or by handling of wet hair and tools. Overtime, this type of work has also been implicated in increased rate of irritant dermatitis among hairdressers due to damage of the skins natural protective barrier

<text>Yugh ( ; Yug) is a Yeniseian language, closely related to Ket, formerly spoken by the Yugh people, one of the southern groups along the Yenisei River in central Siberia. It went extinct by 1972. It was once regarded as a dialect of the Ket language, which was considered to be a language isolate, and was therefore called &quot;Sym Ket&quot; or &quot;Southern Ket&quot;; however, the Ket considered it to be a distinct language. By the early 1990s there were only two or three nonfluent speakers remaining, and the language was virtually extinct. The 2002 census recorded 19 ethnic Yugh in all of Russia. In the 2010 census, only one ethnic Yugh was counted, also stating their proficiency in Yugh, while in the 2020 census, 7 ethnic Yugh were counted, 2 of them stating that they were speakers of Yugh.

<doc id="1283132" wikidata="Q696557" url="?curid=1283132" title="Bombing of Darwin">
<text>The Bombing of Darwin, also known as the Battle of Darwin, on 19 February 1942 was the largest single attack ever mounted by a foreign power on Australia. On that day, 242 Japanese aircraft, in two separate raids, attacked the town, ships in Darwin Harbour and the town&#x27;s two airfields in an attempt to prevent the Allies from using them as bases to contest the invasion of Timor and Java during World War II.

Darwin was lightly defended relative to the size of the attack, and the Japanese inflicted heavy losses upon Allied forces at little cost to themselves. The urban areas of Darwin also suffered some damage from the raids and there were a number of civilian casualties. More than half of Darwin&#x27;s civilian population left the area permanently, before or immediately after the attack.

The two Japanese air raids were the first, and largest, of more than 100 air raids against Australia during 1942–1943. The event happened just four days after the Fall of Singapore, when a combined Commonwealth force surrendered to the Japanese, the largest surrender in British history.

==Background==
In 1942, Darwin—the capital of the Northern Territory—was a small town with limited civil and military infrastructure. Due to its strategic position in northern Australia, the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) and Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) had constructed bases near the town in the 1930s and the early years of World War II. Darwin&#x27;s pre-war population was 5,800.

As early as August 1941, Darwin had been a key in the South Pacific air ferry route designed to avoid routes through the Japanese mandate in the central Pacific for bomber reinforcement of the Philippines. The first flight to use the route occurred when nine B-17D bombers of the 14th Bombardment Squadron (H) left Hawaii on 5 September and passed through Darwin 10–12 September. By October 1941, plans were underway to position fuel and supplies with two ships, including , being chartered and actively engaged in that purpose when war came. By November 1941 Australia had agreed to allow the establishment of training bases, maintenance facilities, munitions storage, communications, and improvement of airfields, including at Darwin, to meet the needs of the B-17 bombers in Australia.

Following the outbreak of the Pacific War in early December 1941, Darwin&#x27;s defences were strengthened. In line with plans developed before the war, several Australian Army and RAAF units stationed in the town were sent to the Netherlands East Indies (Dutch East Indies; NEI) to strengthen the defences of the islands of Ambon and Timor. An improvised plan for support of the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies was completed in Washington on 20 December 1941 by the U.S. Army General Staff. It envisioned Darwin as the hub of transshipment efforts to supply those forces by landing supplies at Brisbane, shipping overland to Darwin, and onward by air and blockade-running ships. In reality, transport to Darwin by sea was necessary. Supplies and shipping intended both to build the Darwin base and to support the Java and Philippine forces were gathered in Darwin and the vicinity. In the two months before the air raids, all but 2,000 civilians were evacuated from the town. Japanese submarines &quot;I-121&quot; and &quot;I-123&quot; laid mines off Darwin in January 1942.

By mid-February 1942, Darwin had become an important Allied base for the defence of the NEI. The Japanese had captured Ambon, Borneo, and Celebes between December 1941 and early-February 1942. Landings on Timor were scheduled for 20 February, and an invasion of Java was planned to take place shortly afterwards. In order to protect these landings from Allied interference, the Japanese military command decided to conduct a major air raid on Darwin. On 10 February a Japanese reconnaissance aircraft overflew the town, and identified an aircraft carrier (actually the seaplane tender ), five destroyers, and 21 merchant ships in Darwin Harbour, as well as 30 aircraft at the town&#x27;s two airfields.

Among the ships in harbour were those returned the morning before the attack from the convoy escorted by involved in the failed effort to reinforce Timor. &quot;Houston&quot; had departed for Java but left &quot;Mauna Loa&quot; and the &quot;Meigs&quot; which had attempted to transport Australian troops to Timor and the U.S. Army transports &quot;Portmar&quot; and &quot;Tulagi&quot; which had embarked a U.S. infantry regiment at Darwin.

==Prelude==

===Opposing forces===

Despite Darwin&#x27;s strategic importance to the defence of Australia, the city was poorly defended. The Australian Army&#x27;s anti-aircraft defences comprised sixteen QF 3.7-inch AA guns and two 3-inch AA guns to counter aircraft flying at high altitude and a small number of Lewis Guns for use against low-flying raiders. The crews of these guns had conducted little recent training due to ammunition shortages. The air forces stationed in and near the town comprised No. 12 Squadron, which was equipped with CAC Wirraway advanced trainers (which had been pressed into service as fighters), and No. 13 Squadron which operated Lockheed Hudson light bombers. Six Hudsons, 3 from No. 2 Squadron and 3 from No. 13 Squadron, also arrived at Darwin on 19 February after having been evacuated from Timor. None of the six Wirraways at Darwin on the day of the raid were serviceable. At the time of the event, there was no functional radar to provide early warning of air raids, and the town&#x27;s civil defences were dysfunctional. The Lowe Commission, led by Victorian judge Charles Lowe and appointed to investigate the raids shortly after they occurred, was informed that the Australian military estimated that Darwin would have needed 36 heavy anti-aircraft guns and 250 fighter aircraft to defend it against a raid of the scale which occurred on 19 February. In addition to the Australian forces, ten United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) Curtiss P-40 Warhawks were passing through Darwin en route to Java on the day of the attack. The P-40 pilots were largely inexperienced in combat.

A total of 65 Allied warships and merchant vessels were in Darwin harbour at the time of the raids. The warships included the United States Navy (USN) destroyer and seaplane tender . The RAN ships in port were the sloops and , corvettes and , auxiliary minesweepers and , patrol boat &quot;Coongoola&quot;, depot ship , examination vessel , lugger , and four boom-net ships. Several USN and Australian troopships were in the harbour along with a number of merchant vessels of varying sizes. Most of the ships in the harbour were anchored near each other, making them an easy target for air attack. Moreover, no plans had been prepared for how the ships should respond to an air raid.

In addition to the vessels in port, the American Army supply ships and &quot;Florence D.&quot;, former Philippine vessels acquired as part of the South West Pacific Area command&#x27;s permanent Army fleet earlier in February, were near Bathurst Island bound for the Philippines with arms and supplies on the morning of the raid.

Darwin was attacked by aircraft flying from aircraft carriers and land bases in the NEI. The main force involved in the raid was the 1st Carrier Air Fleet which was commanded by Vice-Admiral Chūichi Nagumo. This force comprised the aircraft carriers , , , and and a powerful force of escorting surface ships. All four carriers had participated in the attack on Pearl Harbor at the start of the Pacific War. In addition to the carrier-based aircraft, 54 land-based bombers also struck Darwin in a high-level bombing raid nearly two hours after the first one struck at 0956. These comprised 27 G3M &quot;Nell&quot; bombers flying from Ambon and another 27 G4M &quot;Betty&quot; bombers operating from Kendari in Celebes.

==Air raids==

===First raid===

The four Japanese aircraft carriers launched 188 aircraft on the morning of 19 February. The main objective of their crews was attacking ships and port facilities in Darwin Harbour. Their aircraft comprised 81 Nakajima B5N (&quot;Kate&quot;) light bombers, 71 Aichi D3A (&quot;Val&quot;) dive bombers, and an escort of 36 Mitsubishi A6M (&quot;Zero&quot;) fighters. While the B5N was a purpose-built torpedo bomber, it could instead carry up to of bombs and there is no evidence of torpedoes being used on this occasion; the D3A could carry up to of bombs. All of these aircraft were launched by 8.45 am. This wave was led by Commander Mitsuo Fuchida, who had also commanded the first wave of attackers during the raid on Pearl Harbor.

On their way to Darwin, Zeros shot down a US Navy PBY Catalina and strafed a USAAF C-47 Skytrain on the ground, near Melville Island. At 9.35 am Father McGrath of the Sacred Heart mission on Bathurst Island, who was also an Australian coastwatcher, sent a message using a pedal radio to the Amalgamated Wireless Postal Radio Station at Darwin that a large number of aircraft were flying overhead and proceeding southward. The message was then relayed to the Royal Australian Air Force Operations at 9.37 am. No general alarm was given until about 10 am as the RAAF officers there wrongly judged that the aircraft which had been sighted were the ten USAAF P-40s, which were returning to Darwin at the time after reports of bad weather forced them to abort a flight to Java via Kupang, West Timor. As a result, the air raid sirens at Darwin were not sounded before the raid.

Flying escort in a Zero fighter, Petty Officer Yoshikazu Nagahama was separated from his squadron while he was attacking the PBY flying boat and arrived over the city alone ahead of the strike force, which was making a turn to attack from the south. He engaged five US Army Air Force P-40 Warhawk fighters and single-handedly shot down four of them.

The Japanese raiders began to arrive over Darwin at 9:58 am. HMAS &quot;Gunbar&quot; was the first ship to be attacked, being strafed by several Zero fighters. At about this time, the town&#x27;s air raid sirens were belatedly sounded. The Japanese bombers then conducted dive bombing and level bombing attacks on the ships in Darwin Harbour. These attacks lasted for 30 minutes, and resulted in the sinking of three warships and six merchant vessels, and damage to another ten ships. The ships sunk were the USS &quot;Peary&quot;, HMAS &quot;Mavie&quot;, , (which exploded while docked at Darwin&#x27;s main wharf), , , . The oil tanker &quot;Karalee&quot; and the coal storage hulk &quot;Kelat&quot; sank later. At least 21 labourers working on the wharf were killed when it was bombed.



All but one of the P-40s of Major Floyd Pell&#x27;s 33rd Pursuit Squadron, was shot down or destroyed on the ground at RAAF Darwin by the Japanese. Japanese aircraft bombed and strafed the base and civil airfield, as well as the town&#x27;s army barracks and oil store. All of these facilities were seriously damaged.

The bombers began to leave the Darwin area at about 10:10. On their way back to the carriers, their crews noted two Philippine-registered freighters lying just outside the port: &quot;Florence D.&quot; and &quot;Don Isidro&quot;. This information contributed to planning for the second raid that afternoon (which sank both vessels).

Japanese losses may have been as few as five aircraft and three crew. Another 34 Japanese aircraft landed safely with battle damage. Warrant Officer Katsuyoshi Tsuru and First Petty Officer (1st class) Takezo Uchikado were killed when their Aichi dive bomber (bu. no. &quot;3304&quot;; tail no. AII-254) crashed near RAAF Darwin. Petty Officer Hajime Toyoshima (a.k.a. Tadao Minami) was taken prisoner after crash-landing his damaged Zero (bu. no. b. n.&quot;5349&quot;; tail no. BII-124) on Melville Island. Those who ditched near the Japanese fleet and were rescued included Flyer 1st class Yoshio Egawa and the Aichi crew of Flyer 1st class Takeshi Yamada and Flyer 1st class Kinji Funazaki. In 2013, a reference was discovered in Japanese records to a Nakajima torpedo bomber suffering wheel damage from a &quot;gunshot&quot; and both crew (names unknown) being rescued after ditching (by the destroyer ).

Allied ground fire was relatively intense and may have claimed all but two of the Japanese aircraft lost. Only one of the USAAF P-40 pilots remained airborne throughout the first attack, 1st Lieutenant Robert Oestreicher, who has also been credited by US and Japanese sources with one Aichi shot down and one damaged. Toyoshima&#x27;s Zero is considered to have been brought down by small arms fire from Sappers Tom Lamb and Len O&#x27;Shea of the 19th Battalion. Most aviation historians believe Tsuru and Uchikado&#x27;s Aichi was brought down by ground fire, possibly from a major Australian Army camp at Winnellie. Egawa reported that the damage to his Zero came from hitting a tree at Darwin.

===Second raid===

The second wave, made up of 54 land-based medium bombers (27 Mitsubishi G3M and 27 Mitsubishi G4M) arrived over Darwin just before midday. The town&#x27;s air raid sirens were sounded at 11:58 am when the bombers were sighted. The Japanese force separated into two groups flying at . One of these formations attacked RAAF Base Darwin from the south-west while the other approached from the north-east. The two formations arrived over the base at the same time, and dropped their bombs simultaneously. The Japanese bombers then turned, and made a second attack on the base. Due to defective fuses, the Australian heavy anti-aircraft flak gunners were unable to shoot down or damage any of the high-flying Japanese aircraft. The bombers left the Darwin area at about 12:20 pm.

This raid inflicted extensive damage on the RAAF base, though casualties were light. Of the RAAF aircraft at the base, six Hudson light bombers were destroyed and another Hudson and a Wirraway were badly damaged. Two American P-40s and a B-24 Liberator bomber were also destroyed. Six RAAF personnel were killed. Lewis and Ingman list 30 aircraft destroyed.

The Japanese carrier force launched a small number of D3A dive bombers during the afternoon of 19 February to attack the &quot;Florence D.&quot; and &quot;Don Isidro&quot;. &quot;Don Isidro&quot; was the first of these two ships to be attacked, and was rapidly sunk north of Melville Island. Eleven of her 84-strong crew were killed. The dive bombers also attacked &quot;Florence D.&quot; and sank her off Bathurst Island with the loss of four crewmen. All of the survivors from &quot;Don Isidro&quot; were rescued by the corvette on 20 February. Some of &quot;Florence D.&quot;″s survivors landed on Bathurst and Melville Islands while the remainder were rescued by &quot;Warrnambool&quot; on 23 February. Among the survivors of &quot;Florence D.&quot; were the rescued crew of a U.S. Navy PBY piloted by then Lt Thomas H. Moorer (later to become Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff).

&quot;Admiral Halstead&quot;, strafed and with plates damaged by near misses, was brought to the pier where U.S. Army volunteers along with survivors of the U.S. and Philippine vessels helped unload her 14,000 drums of aviation gasoline.

==Aftermath==
===Consequences===
Of major military consequence was the loss of most of the cargo shipping available to support efforts in Java and the Philippines with Java being effectively sealed off from further surface shipments from Australia.

The air raids caused chaos in Darwin, with most essential services including water and electricity being badly damaged or destroyed. Fears of an imminent invasion spread and there was a wave of refugees, as some of the town&#x27;s civilian population fled inland. There were reports of looting, with provost marshals being among the accused. According to official figures, 278 personnel belonging to RAAF North-Western Area Command (NWA) were considered to have deserted as a result of the raids, although it has been argued that the &quot;desertions&quot; were mostly the result of ambiguous orders given to RAAF ground staff after the attacks. In the words of journalist Douglas Lockwood, after the second Japanese air raid, the commander of RAAF Darwin, Wing Commander Stuart Griffith:
 summoned his senior administrative officer, Squadron Leader Swan, and gave a verbal order that all airmen were to move half a mile down the main road and then half a mile inland. At this vague rendezvous point [...] arrangements would be made to feed them. The order led to utter chaos. In being passed by word of mouth from one section to another, sometimes with officers present and sometimes not, it became garbled to the extent it was unrecognisable against the original. In its ultimate form it was interpreted, especially by those desiring such an interpretation, of an impending order for immediate and general evacuation of the area. Highly exaggerated rumours of an impending Japanese invasion had already reached the base from the town and spread quickly among those wanting to believe them. In the absence of restraint, men gathered their belongings and abandoned their stations.
While the NWA staff could see what was happening and issued countermanding orders &quot;the damage was done and hundreds of men were already beyond recall&quot;.

The Australian Army also faced difficulty controlling some of its own troops from looting private property, including &quot;furniture, refrigerators, stoves, pianos, clothes[,] [and] even children&#x27;s toys&quot; due to the breakdown of law and order after the bombing and the ensuing chaos. Many civilian refugees never returned, or did not return for many years, and in the post-war years some land they owned in Darwin had been expropriated by government bodies in their absence, made legal by the &quot;Darwin Lands Acquisition Act 1945&quot;.

The bombing of Darwin resulted in the destruction of 7 of the 11 above ground storage tanks, located on Stokes Hill, in raids on 19 February 16 March and 16 June 1942. This led to the construction of underground oil storage tunnels in Darwin in 1943.

==Casualties and damage==

The number of people killed during 19 February raids is disputed. The Lowe Commission, which investigated them in March 1942, estimated 243 victims but, assuming a few were unidentified, concluded &quot;I am satisfied that the number is approximately 250 and I doubt whether any further investigation will result in ascertaining a more precise figure.&quot;

Some researchers and government officials, including John Bradford (author of &quot;In the Highest Traditions – RAN Heroism Darwin 19 February 1942&quot;), Dr. Peter Stanley (the Australian War Memorial&#x27;s Principal Historian and author of several books about Australian military history), Tom Womack (author of &quot;The Dutch Naval Air Force against Japan&quot;), Paul Rosenzweig (author of &quot;Darwin 1942: a reassessment of the first raid casualties&quot;), and Rear Admiral Kevin Scarce (governor of South Australia) have said there were 250–262 fatalities.

However, a plaque unveiled in Darwin in 2001 gave the total as 292. The plaque indicated 10 sailors had been killed aboard the but the US Navy said there were 13 fatalities and Peter Grose, author of &quot;An Awkward Truth&quot;, said fifteen – he wrote: &quot;With the William B. Preston total corrected to 15, a figure of 297 known dead is the best count anyone is likely to achieve...the full death toll is likely to be a little over 300, perhaps as many as 310 or 320.&quot; Lewis and Ingman have revised that to 14 in their 2013 book &quot;Carrier Attack&quot;.

In 2000, Darwin historian Peter Forrest, who spoke to survivors and researched the attacks for an unpublished book, said (as paraphrased by a journalist), &quot;the first Japanese air raids on Darwin probably killed more than double the official figure of 243&quot;, but by 2002 had lowered his estimate to &quot;anything up to double that 243&quot;.

Other estimates put the toll far higher: one soldier who was there claimed to have seen barges filled with bodies towed out to sea, a member of one of the burial teams recounted seeing uncounted bodies &quot;shoved in a large hole dug by a bulldozer&quot; (paraphrased), according to some sources, former Darwin Mayor (1921–1922) Jack Burton estimated 900 people were killed; Harry Macredie, who helped rescue survivors and recover bodies in the harbour said, &quot;we definitely estimate over 1,000&quot;, Rex Ruwoldt, one of the soldiers attacked that day, says that a few days after the raid he was told over the field telephone that Army Intelligence estimated 1,100 were killed. According to an AP article about the 50th anniversary of the attacks &quot;some estimates say as many as 1,000 died&quot;. Bradford and Forrest said they spoke to survivors who estimated as many as 1,500 people died.

Stanley, Grose, Rosenzweig, and Tom Lewis rejected such numbers. The former said &quot;it was certainly not the 1,024 claimed recently in unsubstantiated reports&quot; and Grose wrote &quot;numbers such as 1,100 are fancifully high&quot;.

By contrast, there is less dispute over the number of injured during the attacks. The Lowe Commission estimated &quot;between 300 and 400&quot; people were wounded. Lewis said the number was over 400, about 200 of which were seriously injured. Womack wrote that 311 were wounded. Australian military historian Chris Coulthard-Clark put the total between 250 and 320. Grose wrote: &quot;if 900 or 1100 died, why were the numbers of injured so low? The count of the injured is more accurate, because they were treated in hospital or shipped out aboard the &quot;Manunda&quot; [a hospital ship]. The hospitals and &quot;Manunda&quot; noted names and numbers of those they treated.&quot;

===Myths and inaccuracies===
The Japanese raid was unlike the attack on Pearl Harbor in that it was launched against a nation that had already declared war on Japan (on 8 December 1941). It was similar in that it was a successful aerial surprise attack on a naval target that came as a great shock to the attacked nation. While the number of bombs dropped on Darwin (681 bombs weighing by 205 bombers) exceeded those dropped on Pearl Harbor (457 bombs [including 40 torpedoes]) weighing by 273), loss of life was much greater at Pearl Harbor (more than 2,400 people) than Darwin (236 people) due to the presence of capital ships and the catastrophic loss of a single battleship, the , and its 1,177 men.

A frequently repeated myth is that the Australian government downplayed the damage from the bombing raids on Darwin, in a &quot;cover-up&quot;. The newspapers of the day disprove this claim. On the day of the attack the prime minister is quoted on the front pages of most newspapers:
&quot;Damage to property was considerable&quot;, he said, &quot;but reports so far to hand do not give precise particulars about the loss of life.&quot; &quot;The Government regards the attacks as most grave, and makes it quite clear that a severe blow has been struck on Australian soil.&quot;

==Further Japanese raids==

After the 19 February 1942 Japanese raid, the Northern Territory and parts of Western Australia&#x27;s north were bombed approximately 100 times between 4 March 1942 and 12 November 1943. One of the heaviest attacks took place on 16 June 1942 when a Japanese force set fire to the oil fuel tanks around the harbour and inflicted severe damage to the vacant banks, stores and railway yards. The Allied navies largely abandoned the naval base at Darwin after the initial 19 February attack, dispersing most of their forces to Brisbane, Fremantle, and other, smaller, seaports. Conversely, Allied air commanders launched a build-up in the Darwin area, building more airfields and deploying many squadrons.

The four IJN aircraft carriers (&quot;Akagi&quot;, &quot;Kaga&quot;, &quot;Hiryū&quot;, and &quot;Sōryū&quot;) that participated in the Bombing of Darwin were later sunk during the Battle of Midway in June 1942.

==Commemoration and depictions in popular culture==

A memorial ceremony has been held every year since at least 2009. On 19 February at the Cenotaph in Darwin, at 9:58 am, a World War II air-raid siren sounds to mark the precise time of the first attack.

A fictionalised version of the raid features prominently in the 2008 film &quot;Australia&quot;.

<text>Siebren Erik Hazelhoff Roelfzema (3 April 1917 – 26 September 2007) was a Dutch writer who became a resistance fighter and RAF pilot during the Second World War. Near the end of the war he was adjudant (assistant) to Queen Wilhelmina. He was made Knight 4th class of the Military William Order. He is perhaps best known for his book (Soldier of Orange) which described his experiences in the war. His book was later made into a film. The book and the film about it eventually were made into the most successful Dutch musical ever, premiering 30 October 2010.

==Early life==

Roelfzema was born in the former Dutch East Indies in Surabaya, on Java, when it was under colonial rule. He was from a patrician family, which is listed in the . He was the second child of Siebren Erik Hazelhoff Roelfzema and his wife Cornelia Vreede. His older sister, Ellen, had been born two years before. His father managed rubber and coffee plantations. In the 1930s the family returned to the Netherlands so the children could be provided with a good education. They initially moved to The Hague, and later moved on to Wassenaar. He played soccer and was a member of the Hague Football Association.

Roelfzema started writing in his teens. From 16 years of age onward he was committed to becoming a writer. He attended Leiden University and was a member of the Leidsch Student Corps &quot;Minerva society&quot; while living at Rapenburg 56 across the canal from the . During his hazing initiation, the president of his student corps, Ernst de Jonge, threw a soup tureen at a group of new students, striking Roelfzema in the head and cutting his scalp. De Jonge had been an Olympic rower at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, and was very popular among the students. His accidental wounding of Roelfzema was the basis for their forming a friendship.

After completing his first year of study, Roelfzema took time off to travel to the United States and crossed the country by freighthopping and hitchhiking. In 1939, he wrote a book of this experience, titled &quot;Rendezvous in San Francisco&quot;, which became a bestseller in the Netherlands.

==War in Europe==
Following his trip abroad Roelfzema returned to Leiden University to continue his studies. When war broke out in Europe in September, 1939, Roelfzema and his fellow students supposed Holland would remain neutral as it had during the First World War. When the Soviet Union invaded Finland in November he traveled there to cover the conflict, working as a war correspondent for the , the and the . Afterwards he wrote a book about it, titled (The Smoldering Fire).

Following the conclusion of the war in Finland in March 1940, he returned home and resumed his life as a student at Leiden. He was there at the time of the German invasion of the Netherlands on 10 May 1940. Roelfzema joined the Dutch army reserve, but the Netherlands was overrun by the German army in five days, bringing the war to a close before he was deployed. Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands fled to London to establish the government in exile there.

Roelfzema continued his studies during the occupation and became involved in the Dutch underground. In October, the faculty at Leiden received a letter demanding to know if they were of Jewish heritage. On 23 November all the Jewish staff at the university were dismissed. The dean of the Law School, Professor Rudolph Cleveringa, gave a speech on 26 November 1940 condemning these dismissals. He and several other of the law professors were arrested. This instigated a 48-hour strike by the students. In response the Germans closed the university.
In February 1941, Roelfzema wrote his &#x27;Leids manifesto&#x27;, which criticized German demands of excluding the Jewish students from the student societies. It called upon the students of Leiden to resist the policies of the German occupiers. He printed it at his own expense, and, during the night of 14/15 February, Roelfzema and eleven of his compatriots posted it all over Leiden. Ten days later, the board of the university made a request of the students that they resist the German occupiers no further. Roelfzema wrote a reply on 6 March, pledging in principle to commit no more opposition at the university. In April he was arrested by the secret police and held for a week at the notorious &quot;Orange hotel&quot;, a political prison run by the Germans in Scheveningen.

In the midst of the unrest and disruption, the Germans re-opened Leiden University for ten days. As it happened, Roelfzema had been studying hard and took this opportunity to take exams. Taking his exams in formal tuxedo, as was the custom of his student society, Minerva, he passed and was awarded his doctorate in law on 10 June 1941. He was the first member of his class to attain the degree. Leiden University was closed again soon afterwards. Three weeks later, he was an , a Dutchman who escaped Nazi control by finding a way to reach England. Roelfzema, Peter Tazelaar, Bram van der Stok, Gerard Volkersz and Toon Buitendijk posed as crew members aboard the , a Swiss freighter bound for New York City. The ship was intercepted in the North Sea by the British cruiser , suspecting her to be a German supply ship. The &quot;Devonshire&quot; escorted her to Tórshavn, in the Faroe Islands, were the stowaways were brought ashore. Roelfzema persuaded the captain of the British cruiser to give them passage to Britain.

==Activities in England==
Once in London, Roelfzema became involved in a secret service group of escaped young Dutchmen called the Mews, after Chester Square Mews, the neighborhood in London where they lived. The group was being run under the direction of François van &#x27;t Sant, director of the Dutch Military Intelligence and Security Service (CID, ). The agents were trained under Colonel Euan Rabagliati of MI9. Their operation was called &#x27;Contact Holland&#x27;, whose goal was to establish links with the disparate Dutch resistance groups, support them and coordinate their activities in the Netherlands. Most agents were brought into the Netherlands by parachute drop. This required the agent to be trained in parachuting and exposed them to the risks of doing so at night. Roelfzema, Peter Tazelaar and Chris Krediet came up with an alternative method of insertion. They proposed gaining access to the Netherlands by sea. They would use a Motor Gun Boat (MGB) to cross the English Channel, covering the last stretch of water by taking a small boat and rowing into shore.

Due to internal politics Van &#x27;t Sant was required to step down from his position with intelligence and control of the CID was transferred to Colonel Mattheus de Bruyne of the Dutch Marine Corps. De Bruyne lacked experience in intelligence work and did not have a good grasp on the subtlety required. He failed to recognize the fact that his agents were often arrested and yet were continuing to broadcast messages, except now they were under the control of the Germans. The usual procedure for transmitting messages was to include small errors. If an agent was forced to work for the Germans, he would leave out the errors. The result should be that contact was aborted immediately. De Bruyne concluded that the agents simply forgot to use the security-checks and even sent messages to remind them. This would tip-off the German intelligence and the agent would be replaced with a German and sent off to a concentration camp. Other intelligence mistakes by De Bruyne included attaching detailed maps of the landing sites at Noordwijk, Scheveningen and Walcherento to the walls of his London office and leaving them up. Observing this, Louis d&#x27;Aulnis, an agent of the CID, elected not to announce where his landing place would be beforehand, a measure which ended up saving his life.

In their first mission, Peter Tazelaar was to deliver radio equipment and bring two men back from the occupied Netherlands to join the government-in-exile in Britain. Roelfzema had met Tazelaar when the two men had worked as stokers on the &quot;St. Cregue&quot; during their escape. Roelfzema had often spent time at the seaside resort of Scheveningen and knew that every Friday night a large party was held at the Kurhaus of Scheveningen (Grand Hotel) which had been taken over by the Germans as a headquarters. Their plan was to approach Scheveningen late at night and take Tazelaar into shore by dinghy.
In the pre-dawn hours of 23 November 1941, Tazelaar, Roelfzema, Krediet and Lieutenant Francis &#x27;Bob&#x27; Goodfellow rowed in on a small dinghy. When they neared the surf, Roelfzema and Tazelaar slipped off the boat and waded onto the beach. Tazelaar was then helped out of his wetsuit to reveal the black tuxedo he was wearing beneath it. Roelfzema then poured a generous amount of brandy over Tazelaar and left him, returning to the dinghy. Reeking of brandy, Tazelaar managed to pass himself off as a drunken party goer and staggered past the sentries stationed around the hotel. Two months later he returned to the beach with three others for a return to England. They were waiting on the beach for Roelfzema but the arrived on the scene first. Tazelaar and one other were able to escape. With no contact to England, he had to return overland, taking his chances traveling through Belgium, France, Switzerland, Spain and Portugal, before reaching England three months later.

Roelfzema led fifteen small-boat missions to the shores of the Netherlands. He was in charge of the insertion mission, while a Royal Navy lieutenant was in charge of the Motor Gun Boat carrying them. The small group would wait for the dark of a moonless night to attempt their missions, with Roelfzema going ashore with whoever was being dropped. 108 such returned to the Netherlands by parachute or boat to support the resistance. Only half survived the war.

On 22 February 1942, Roelfzema&#x27;s &#x27;transport service&#x27; performed an infiltration for his friend Ernst de Jonge. They rowed ashore at Katwijk. Roelfzema had already become suspicious that something was amiss with their insertion operations. He feared they were being betrayed by Nazi sympathizers present amongst the officers of the exiled government. Some three months after De Jonge&#x27;s drop, a courier on his way to England was picked up by the secret police. He was carrying detailed reports written by De Jonge that had been transferred onto three roles of microfilm. De Jonge heard about the arrest but refused to go into hiding. Three days later, on 22 May, De Jonge and two of his fellow agents were arrested at an apartment in Rotterdam. They were brought to Kamp Haaren. From there they were transferred to Assen. Roelfzema did not hear from him again; De Jonge and a group of 52 others were sent to the Rawicz concentration camp in Poland. Of that group, 47 were sent over to Mauthausen, where they were executed. Ernst de Jonge remained with six others at Rawicz and died there in September 1944; he has no known grave.

With the capture of De Jonge, Roelfzema blamed de Bruyne. When de Bruyne instructed Roelfzema to provide information to another branch of the exiled Dutch government, Roelfzema refused for fear that it had been infiltrated by Nazi sympathizers. De Bruyne was angry with this insubordination and moved to have Roelfzema court-martialed. Queen Wilhelmina intervened and recommended him for the Netherlands&#x27; highest honor, the (Military Order of William). The court-martial proceedings were set aside and the was bestowed upon Roelfzema in the summer of 1942 by the Queen. Following this he met with Dutch Navy minister Johan Furstner and the court-martial was cancelled. Roelfzema had had enough of working with the secret service. He resigned from the Mews and volunteered to serve in the Royal Air Force.

The British military historian M. R. D. Foot has confirmed the degree of German penetration of SOE&#x27;s Dutch networks, something SOE denied during the War. In his history of the Special Operations Executive, he wrote that the Allied intelligence effort in the Netherlands had been penetrated from the start of the war. Two Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) agents, Captain Sigismund Payne Best and Major Richard Stevens, had been captured in November 1939 during the Venlo Incident. This culminated in the capture of some 50 British and Dutch agents by the and the in Operation North Pole.

==Flying with the RAF==

To fly for the RAF Roelfzema first had to qualify. Poor vision had disqualified him earlier from mandatory service in the Dutch reserves. The glasses he wore for visual correction should have disqualified him from pilot training as well. Ever resourceful, Roelfzema worked around this by smuggling in a lens and palming it during his vision test. He passed and was sent to Canada for flying school. He trained in single-seat fighter aircraft and was awarded the gold cufflinks on graduating his training course given to the best pilot cadet in the training group.

On returning to England he found himself sidelined, unable to get posted to an operational squadron. An unlikely avenue was with the elite Pathfinder Force of Bomber Command&#x27;s most experienced and best pilots, whose job it was to guide the Bomber stream of the RAF night bombers through all weathers to their targets in Germany. While lamenting his situation with girlfriend Midge Cooper at a public house, &#x27;Hamish&#x27; Mahaddie happened by. Mahaddie was a wing commander with the Pathfinders, who frequented the public houses after giving talks on Pathfinder techniques to see if he could recruit any pilots for his force. &quot;Here&#x27;s just the man we need!&quot; said Cooper. Though hesitant to take on an inexperienced pilot, Mahaddie granted Roelfzema a spot at RAF Warboys, where the group trained pilots on twin-engine aircraft and night flying in preparation to work in the PFF. To obtain a position in the squadron, Roelfzema needed to score an &quot;above average&quot; in the training course, which he did. Thus the near-sighted novice fighter pilot was posted to the elite PFF, flying the De Havilland Mosquito.

Roelfzema flew with 139 Squadron. His aircraft was unarmed and relied on its speed to escape from German night fighters and luck to get through the flak. Normally Bomber Command crews were considered to complete a tour after 30 sorties. In the Pathfinder Force crews initially were required to complete 60 sorties but later this was reduced to 45. Roelfzema completed 72 operational sorties, including 25 missions over Berlin, the most heavily defended city in the Reich. For his service the RAF awarded him the Distinguished Flying Cross. While serving in the RAF, Roelfzema flew with pilots and aircrews from other nations that had become occupied by Nazi Germany, whom he saw as comrades in arms. Years later he came to realize that working with Danes, Poles and others gave him a broader sense of the world which he came to appreciate.

==Adjudant to the Queen==

In early 1945, with France and parts of the Netherlands liberated, Roelfzema was appointed adjudant (assistant) to Queen Wilhelmina. To his surprise and delight, Peter Tazelaar had been selected as well. The two accompanied her back to the Netherlands when she returned 13 March 1945, after a five-year exile in London. The Queen landed in Antwerp, Belgium, and traveled west by car to Maldegem, where she turned north to enter the Netherlands at Eede. The Queen chose Eede as the point to enter her country because the village and surrounding area had been severely damaged by the war, resulting in many victims. The arrival of the Queen symbolized the end of years of oppression and loss of freedom and the beginning of a period of peace and prosperity. She stepped out of her armored carriage and walked firmly over the border, which was marked for the occasion. Years later, she recalled the border crossing in her memoirs as &quot;One of the greatest events of my life&quot;. He flew the Queen home on the liberation of the Netherlands in May of that year. Shortly afterwards Roelfzema attended the two future Dutch monarchs, Princess Juliana and her daughter Princess Beatrix, on the aeroplane which brought them back to the Netherlands on the Gilze en Rijen flight of 2 May 1945. He helped Beatrix take her first few steps on liberated Dutch soil.
At the Queen&#x27;s inauguration in The Hague on 6 July 1945, Roelfzema was in attendance at the Queen&#x27;s request. He was also on hand when the princesses returned at Teuge Airport 2 August 1945.

==After the war==
After the Second World War, Queen Wilhelmina offered him a permanent appointment as her adjudant but he declined this position. Shortly thereafter he emigrated to the United States, became a US citizen and married his long-time girlfriend Margaret &quot;Midge&quot; Cooper. He worked in Hollywood, initially as an actor and then as a writer. He moved on to work in the television industry as a writer for the first &quot;Today Show&quot; program and later helped to launch &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; in New York City. He also wrote for a number of Dutch newspapers. In 1950 he was approached by Dutch admiral Conrad Helfrich, who asked him to help support the Moluccans. The Moluccas are a group of islands north and west of New Guinea. The islanders are predominantly Christian. Following the withdrawal of the Dutch from the Dutch East Indies, the Molluccans declined to be a part of the newly formed Republic of Indonesia, which was Muslim-dominated and under the rule of Sukarno, who had become increasingly authoritarian. They declared their independence as the Republic of South Maluku.

Sukarno was in the process of forcibly taking control of the islands. Roelfzema was approached to contact the resistance on the Moluccas and document that Sukarno was using military force against them. This evidence was to be presented to the United Nations, where the case of the Molaccan people could be heard. He was provided with a small float plane in the Philippines, a Republic RC-3 Seabee and a former aviator from the US Navy to fly the aircraft to Ambon in the Mollucas. The aircraft turned out to be overloaded and could not get airborne. Roelfzema and the pilot spent the next three days removing the aircraft&#x27;s wheels to lighten it. After three days the pilot gave up and left Roelfzema to deal with the mission and the aircraft. He had not flown since the war five years previously and had never flown a float plane. He reached the Mollucas and obtained the evidence requested to support the claim before the UN. His efforts created a lot of public interest, which Roelfzema made use of to bring attention to the plight of the people of the Moluccas.

In 1956 he was appointed director of Radio Free Europe, and moved to Munich. In the late 1950s Roelfzema had a number of meetings in New York City with fellow Dutch national Ben van Marken, where they discussed their mutual interest in auto-racing. In 1963 he and Van Marken became co-founders of &#x27;Racing Team Holland&#x27;, a Dutch motorsport team.

In November 1968 he married for the second time, to Karin Steensma, an interior decorator. At this time he was contacted by a Dutch publishing company whose primary holding was a Dutch newspaper. They asked if he would convey his war experiences for a series of articles to run in their paper and they proposed to send a ghost writer to take down narration and compose the pieces. After twenty years in the business world, he longed to return to his first calling of writing. He wanted to write about what had happened to him and his friends during the war. As a writer, he had the ability to express himself about what they had gone through, where he knew the others could not. Steensma supported his decision. He agreed to write the articles himself, if they would give him an advance and publish them in book form at the end. They agreed and he set about his task. After a year of work his book was published in 1970 under the title (The Rattlesnake Cave). Roelfzema was not happy with the book, the title, the cover, the publisher or how the book was being promoted. After six months it had sold some 13,000 copies in Holland. Roelfzema purchased the rights to the book, reworked it to make the stories flow together better, changed the title and got Prince Bernhard to write a foreword. This second presentation was titled &quot;&quot; (Soldier of Orange), for his association with the royal family. It became an international bestseller.

In 1971 his son Erik invited him to visit him at his home on Maui, at the time a remote location. Roelfzema found the landscape, climate, smells and friendliness of the islands reminded him of his childhood home in Java. He felt he was coming home, purchased land there and after introducing his wife Karin to the island, the couple moved there together. They lived on Maui for a number of years before moving to a more remote location on the big island of Hawaii.

Prominent Dutch film maker Paul Verhoeven took an interest in Roelfzema&#x27;s and brought it to the screen. He cast Rutger Hauer in the part of Erik Hazelhoff Roelfzema. Roelfzema was on the set as a consultant and the two became lifelong friends. With the release of the film in 1977, Roelfzema gained greater public attention and Hauer was made into an international film star. The film won the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Foreign Film in 1979. One year later, in 1980, it received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Foreign Language Film. In 2010 the story was brought to the stage as a musical. The musical version of &quot;Soldier of Orange&quot; was presented in a unique rotating theater, which was special built in an old hangar at the former military airport at Valkenburg, which is located between Wassenaar and Katwijk near Leiden. The musical was very well received.

Roelfzema joined Barnwell Industries as a director in 1977. He encouraged the company&#x27;s chairman to look to Hawai&#x27;i as a possible location to headquarter the business. He was instrumental in bringing the Tennessee-based energy company to Hawai&#x27;i in the early 1980s. The company drilled the first commercial geothermal well in Puna on the Big Island in 1980. The company is a leader in development in Hawai&#x27;i and performs oil and natural gas exploration in Canada and North America. Alex Kinzler, Barnwell president, said Roelfzema was an active and valued member of their board. While living in Hawaii Roelfzema became a member of the Waimea Outdoor Circle, a group that fosters environmental preservation and the enhancement of nature through education and community involvement. Outdoor Circle is a statewide environmental non-profit that works with branches throughout the Hawaiian Islands to protect Hawai&#x27;i&#x27;s unique natural beauty.

He was close to Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, who visited at his home on the Big Island of Hawaii. In 1980, Roelfzema played a ceremonial role as one of two kings of arms at the coronation of Queen Beatrix. Roelfzema wrote a second autobiography, &quot;In Pursuit of Life&quot;, in 2000. He died on 26 September 2007 at his home in Āhualoa near Honokaa, on the Island of Hawaii, at the age of 90. He was survived by his wife, Karin Steensma, his son Erik, step-daughter Karna Hazelhoff-Castellon, granddaughter Meadow Melelani Hazelhoff Roelfzema, and great-grandsons Jake and Siebren.

In his research for his biography of Dutch statesman François van &#x27;t Sant, Dutch author Sytze van der Zee discovered a letter from Van &#x27;t Sant to Queen Wilhelmina, where he informed her that a date had been set for a coup to overturn the acting Dutch government. The letter gave the date for the coup as 24 April 1947. It also outlined some of the ministers to be appointed to serve in a new government. Erik Hazelhoff Roelfzema was listed as one of the men that could be relied upon. The coup never took place.

==The Erik Hazelhoff Roelfzema Prize in Literature==
In 2009 a foundation was established in memorial to promote writing and the ideals of Erik Hazelhoff Roelfzema. The foundation offers a bi-yearly literary prize in two categories: the Erik Hazelhoff Roelfzema Young Talent Prize, awarded to the best master&#x27;s thesis written in Dutch or English at a Dutch or Flemish university, and the Erik Hazelhoff Roelfzema Biography Prize awarded to the best Dutch-language Biography. The Young Talent Prize aims to encourage young academic writers. The Biography Prize aims to promote interest in and the reading of biographical works among the Dutch. The thinking of Erik Hazelhoff Roelfzema and the standards and values that characterized his life are used as a guide in evaluating submissions. Princess Irene accepted the position of guardian of the &quot;Erik Hasselhoff Roelfzema Foundation Prize&quot;.

==Awards==
Hazelhoff Roelfzema was acclaimed in the Netherlands as one of the nation&#x27;s greatest heroes of the war. He was the recipient of the highest Dutch military honour. His experiences during the war became known throughout the world through his writings on those events and the film. Late in his life he was given the Dutch American Heritage Award. He did not see himself as unusual and when honoured was ever mindful of the friends that he had lost. In an interview in July with De Telegraaf, Hazelhoff Roelfzema said he had received too much recognition for his wartime exploits. &quot;I became a war hero because I stuck out, because I wrote about my experiences&quot;.

He went on to offer:
