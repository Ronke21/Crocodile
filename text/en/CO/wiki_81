<text>In economics, an isocost line shows all combinations of inputs which cost the same total amount. Although similar to the budget constraint in consumer theory, the use of the isocost line pertains to cost-minimization in production, as opposed to utility-maximization. For the two production inputs labour and capital, with fixed unit costs of the inputs, the equation of the isocost line is
:formula_1

where w represents the wage rate of labour, r represents the rental rate of capital, K is the amount of capital used, L is the amount of labour used, and C is the total cost of acquiring those quantities of the two inputs.

The absolute value of the slope of the isocost line, with capital plotted vertically and labour plotted horizontally, equals the ratio of unit costs of labour and capital. The slope is:

:formula_2

The isocost line is combined with the isoquant map to determine the optimal production point at any given level of output. Specifically, the point of tangency between any isoquant and an isocost line gives the lowest-cost combination of inputs that can produce the level of output associated with that isoquant. Equivalently, it gives the maximum level of output that can be produced for a given total cost of inputs. A line joining tangency points of isoquants and isocosts (with input prices held constant) is called the expansion path.

==The cost-minimization problem==
The cost-minimization problem of the firm is to choose an input bundle (&quot;K&quot;,&quot;L&quot;) feasible for the output level &quot;y&quot; that costs as little as possible. A cost-minimizing input bundle is a point on the isoquant for the given &quot;y&quot; that is on the lowest possible isocost line. Put differently, a cost-minimizing input bundle must satisfy two conditions:

# it is on the &quot;y&quot;-isoquant
# no other point on the &quot;y&quot;-isoquant is on a lower isocost line.

==The case of smooth isoquants convex to the origin==

If the &quot;y&quot;-isoquant is smooth and convex to the origin and the cost-minimizing bundle involves a positive amount of each input, then at a cost-minimizing input bundle an isocost line is tangent to the &quot;y&quot;-isoquant.
Now since the absolute value of the slope of the isocost line is the input cost ratio formula_3, and the absolute value of the slope of an isoquant is the marginal rate of technical substitution (MRTS), we reach the following conclusion:
If the isoquants are smooth and convex to the origin and the cost-minimizing input bundle involves a positive amount of each input, then this bundle satisfies the following two conditions:

* It is on the &quot;y&quot;-isoquant (i.e. &quot;F&quot;(&quot;K&quot;, &quot;L&quot;) = &quot;y&quot; where &quot;F&quot; is the production function), and
* the MRTS at (&quot;K&quot;, &quot;L&quot;) equals &quot;w&quot;/&quot;r&quot;.

The condition that the MRTS be equal to &quot;w&quot;/&quot;r&quot; can be given the following intuitive interpretation. We know that the MRTS is equal to the ratio of the marginal products of the two inputs. So the condition that the MRTS be equal to the input cost ratio is equivalent to the condition that the marginal product per dollar is equal for the two inputs. This condition makes sense: at a particular input combination, if an extra dollar spent on input 1 yields more output than an extra dollar spent on input 2, then more of input 1 should be used and less of input 2, and so that input combination cannot be optimal. Only if a dollar spent on each input is equally productive is the input bundle optimal.

An isocost line is a curve which shows various combinations of inputs that cost the same total amount . For the two production inputs labour and capital, with fixed unit costs of the inputs, the isocost curve is a straight line . The isocost line is always used to determine the optimal production combined with the isoquant line .

if w represents the wage rate of labour, r represents the rental rate of capital, K is the amount of capital used, L is the amount of labour used, and C is the total cost of the two inputs, than the isocost line can be

C=rK+wL

In the figure, the point C / w on the horizontal axis represents that all the given costs are used in labor, and the point C / r on the vertical axis represents that all the given costs are used in capital . The line connecting these two points is the isocost line. 

The slope is -w/r which represents the relative price. Any point within the isocost line indicates that there are surplus after purchasing the combination of labor and capital at that point. Any point outside the isocost line indicates that the combination of labor and capital is not enough to be purchased at the given cost. Only the point in the isocost line shows the combination that can be purchased exactly at the given cost . 

If the prices of the t factors change, the isocost line will also change . Suppose w rises, so that the maximum amount of labor that can be employed at the same cost will decrease, that is, the intercept of the isocost line on the L axis will decrease; and because r remains unchanged, the intercept of the isocost line on the K axis will remain unchanged.

<doc id="1301559" wikidata="Q97226587" url="?curid=1301559" title="Leibniz formula for π">
<text>In mathematics, the Leibniz formula for [[Pi|]], named after Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, states that
formula_1

an alternating series.

It is sometimes called the Madhava–Leibniz series as it was first discovered by the Indian mathematician Madhava of Sangamagrama or his followers in the 14th–15th century (see Madhava series), and was later independently rediscovered by James Gregory in 1671 and Leibniz in 1673. The Taylor series for the inverse tangent function, often called &quot;Gregory&#x27;s series&quot;, is
formula_2

The Leibniz formula is the special case formula_3

It also is the Dirichlet -series of the non-principal Dirichlet character of modulus 4 evaluated at formula_4 and therefore the value of the Dirichlet beta function.

==Proofs==
=== Proof 1 ===
formula_5

Considering only the integral in the last term, we have:
formula_6

Therefore, by the squeeze theorem, as , we are left with the Leibniz series:
formula_7

=== Proof 2 ===
Let formula_8, when formula_9, the series formula_10 converges uniformly, then 
formula_11

Therefore, if formula_12 approaches formula_13 so that it is continuous and converges uniformly, the proof is complete, where, the series formula_14 to be converges by the Leibniz&#x27;s test, and also, formula_12 approaches formula_13 from within the Stolz angle, so from Abel&#x27;s theorem this is correct.

== Convergence ==

Leibniz&#x27;s formula converges extremely slowly: it exhibits sublinear convergence. Calculating to 10 correct decimal places using direct summation of the series requires precisely five billion terms because for (one needs to apply Calabrese error bound). To get 4 correct decimal places (error of 0.00005) one needs 5000 terms. Even better than Calabrese or Johnsonbaugh error bounds are available.

However, the Leibniz formula can be used to calculate to high precision (hundreds of digits or more) using various convergence acceleration techniques. For example, the Shanks transformation, Euler transform or Van Wijngaarden transformation, which are general methods for alternating series, can be applied effectively to the partial sums of the Leibniz series. Further, combining terms pairwise gives the non-alternating series
formula_17

which can be evaluated to high precision from a small number of terms using Richardson extrapolation or the Euler–Maclaurin formula. This series can also be transformed into an integral by means of the Abel–Plana formula and evaluated using techniques for numerical integration.

== Unusual behaviour ==
If the series is truncated at the right time, the decimal expansion of the approximation will agree with that of for many more digits, except for isolated digits or digit groups. For example, taking five million terms yields
formula_18

where the underlined digits are wrong. The errors can in fact be predicted; they are generated by the Euler numbers according to the asymptotic formula
formula_19

where is an integer divisible by 4. If is chosen to be a power of ten, each term in the right sum becomes a finite decimal fraction. The formula is a special case of the Euler–Boole summation formula for alternating series, providing yet another example of a convergence acceleration technique that can be applied to the Leibniz series. In 1992, Jonathan Borwein and Mark Limber used the first thousand Euler numbers to calculate to 5,263 decimal places with the Leibniz formula.

==Euler product==
The Leibniz formula can be interpreted as a Dirichlet series using the unique non-principal Dirichlet character modulo 4. As with other Dirichlet series, this allows the infinite sum to be converted to an infinite product with one term for each prime number. Such a product is called an Euler product. It is:
formula_20
In this product, each term is a superparticular ratio, each numerator is an odd prime number, and each denominator is the nearest multiple of 4 to the numerator. The product is conditionally convergent; its terms must be taken in order of increasing .

<text>Frederick Karl Gampper Jr. (28 August 1893 - 3 March 1961) was a dirigible pilot with license #53 issued by the Aero Club of America, and a licensed free balloon pilot. His mentors included Ralph H. Upson and Herman Kraft.

==Biography==
Frederick Karl Gampper worked for Goodyear from around 1913 to 1921, primarily in their lighter-than-air division. He was supervisor of dirigible operations, liaison to the Navy, pilot and instructor in Key West and Akron at Goodyear&#x27;s Wingfoot Lake facility from 1917 to 1921. Gampper was chief pilot of the &quot;Wingfoot Air Express&quot;, an early Goodyear blimp that was to make history in Chicago on Monday, July 21, 1919, when the worst dirigible disaster in United States history occurred on that date. Because the blimp was overweight on this occasion, Gampper had to allow a thinner pilot to make the flight. The highly flammable hydrogen in the blimp ignited over downtown Chicago causing the airship to crash through the skylight of the Illinois Trust and Savings Building. The accident killed one crew member, two passengers, and ten bank employees. In the aftermath of the crash, Chicago changed rules for flights over the city as well as closing the Grant Park Airstrip and creating Chicago Air Park.

Gampper left Goodyear in 1921 to assume the role of chief pilot of the Commercial Airship Syndicate, Ltd., one of the first commercial airlines in the United States. They ran mail and passengers between Kansas City, Missouri and Oklahoma City. The Syndicate&#x27;s offices were located at the Gumbel Building in Kansas City, and their small Goodyear Pony Blimp was hangared at a location along the river. The company closed after their hangar and blimp were destroyed during a windstorm.

Gampper&#x27;s greatest contribution to lighter-than-air flight was as a teacher to many of the men who would go on to design, command, and fly America&#x27;s great dirigibles: the &quot;USS Shenandoah (ZR-1)&quot;, &quot;USS Los Angeles (ZR-3)&quot;, &quot;USS Macon (ZRS-5)&quot;, and &quot;USS Akron (ZRS-4)&quot;.

Much of his collection is with the Smithsonian Air And Space Museum, Washington, D.C. on loan from his grandson, James Michael Gampper. It consists of blueprints, manuals, newspaper articles, brochures and photographs of airships and balloons during the early part of the 20th century. The airships included are the US Army airship &quot;Roma&quot;, the &quot;Wingfoot Express&quot;, and the Pony Blimp at Commercial Air Syndicate.

<text>NWChem is an ab initio computational chemistry software package which includes quantum chemical and molecular dynamics functionality.
It was designed to run on high-performance parallel supercomputers as well as conventional workstation clusters. It aims to be scalable both in its ability to treat large problems efficiently, and in its usage of available parallel computing resources. NWChem has been developed by the Molecular Sciences Software group of the Theory, Modeling &amp; Simulation program of the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (EMSL) at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). The early implementation was funded by the EMSL Construction Project.

NWChem is currently being redesigned and reimplemented for exascale computing platforms (NWChemEx ).

== Capabilities ==

* Molecular mechanics
* Molecular dynamics
* Hartree–Fock (self-consistent field method)
* Density functional theory
* Time-dependent density functional theory
* Post-Hartree–Fock methods, including MP2 in the resolution of identity approximation (RI-MP2), multiconfigurational self-consistent-field (MCSCF) theory, selected configuration interaction (CI), Møller–Plesset perturbation theory (MP2, MP3, MP4), configuration interaction (CISD, CISDT, CISDTQ), and coupled cluster theory (CCSD, CCSDT, CCSDTQ, EOMCCSD, EOMCCSDT, EOMCCSDTQ). The Tensor Contraction Engine, or TCE, provides most of the functionality for the correlated methods, and can be used to develop additional many-body methods using a Python interface.

<doc id="1301568" wikidata="Q983432" url="?curid=1301568" title="Agesander of Rhodes">
<text>Agesander (also &quot;Agesandros&quot;, &quot;Hagesander&quot;, &quot;Hagesandros&quot;, or &quot;Hagesanderus&quot;; or ) was one, or more likely, several Greek sculptors from the island of Rhodes, working in the first centuries BC and AD, in a late Hellenistic &quot;baroque&quot; style. If there was more than one sculptor called Agesander they were very likely related to each other. The very important works of the groups of &quot;Laocoön and His Sons&quot;, in the Vatican Museums, and the sculptures discovered at Sperlonga are both signed by three sculptors including an Agesander.

==Sculptures==
The name Agesander is only found in ancient literature in Pliny the Elder, but occurs in several inscriptions, though between them these certainly refer to a number of different individuals. Until the discovery at Sperlonga in 1959, only one work which Agesander executed was known, although this is one of the most famous of all classical sculptures. Pliny records that in conjunction with Athenodorus and Polydorus, Agesander sculpted &quot;Laocoön and his Sons&quot;, although modern art historians generally view the trio as being either &quot;high-class copyists&quot;, or working in a Pergamese baroque style created some two centuries earlier.
In 1959 a very large set of sculptures were discovered at Sperlonga, and are now in a museum there created for them. One section, the ship&#x27;s prow of the &quot;Scylla group&quot;, was signed by the same three names, this time with the names of their fathers, but in a different order. Sperlonga is the classical &quot;Spelunca&quot; mentioned by Tacitus and others, on the coast between Rome and Naples, where the emperor Tiberius had a celebrated villa. Tiberius was nearly killed when the grotto containing the statues collapsed in 26 AD, as Tacitus recounts, so they must predate this. The sculptures were in thousands of fragments, and reconstruction of the smaller pieces continues, amid much scholarly argument. The scenes all feature stories of Odysseus, and are in a similar style to the &quot;Laocoön&quot;, but with many significant differences, not least in quality, being uneven but generally of much lower skill and finish (the group is also considerably larger). Both the Sperlonga works and the &quot;Laocoön&quot; were probably created in Italy for very wealthy Roman patrons very likely from the Imperial circle; they were certainly owned by the Imperial family later, as Pliny says the &quot;Laocoön&quot; belonged to the Emperor Titus in his day.

==Inscriptions==
Agesander is named first by Pliny as artist of the &quot;Laocoön&quot;, with Athenodoros second, but in the &quot;signature&quot; inscription at Sperlonga his name comes second to Athenodoros, who is &quot;Athenodoros, son of Agesander&quot;. The others are &quot;Agesandros, son of Paionios&quot; (Paionios is a rare name) and &quot;Polydoros, son of Polydoros&quot;. It is thought that strict seniority governed the sequence of names in such cases and, barring a simple mistake by Pliny, that it cannot be the same Agesander in both Pliny and Sperlonga. It was common for Rhodians to be named after their grandfathers, with the same names alternating over many generations for as long as several centuries. An inscription on a base for a statue at Lindos, firmly dated to 42 BC, records &quot;Athenodorus, son of Agesander&quot;, but again it is unclear how these two names relate to the other references – in fact both names were very common on Rhodes, though infrequent elsewhere. Conversely Polydorus, the last named in both inscriptions, is generally a common Greek name, but much less so on Rhodes, and as a sculptor seems only known from Pliny, whereas an Athenodorus was evidently famous, recorded on several bases for sculptures (all found or recorded detached from their sculptures), more as a label or caption than a signature. In some he is again &quot;Athenodorus, son of Agesander&quot;. This is also the name of a priest recorded in an inscription at Lindos datable to 22 BC, which also records a possible brother &quot;Agesander, son of Agesander&quot;; either of these might have been sculptors also, or not. 
&quot;Agesandros, son of Paionios&quot; occurs in other honorific inscriptions, including a very grand one on Rhodes listing over twenty related individuals, and Paionios&#x27;s own father is another Agesander. E. E. Rice says this inscription can be dated fairly closely to &quot;–50 BC, probably closer to 50 BC&quot;, and identifies Agesandros with the Sperlonga sculptor. As an example of the proliferation of these names, another &quot;Agesander, son of Agesander, son of Athenodorus&quot; is recorded as a military man on Rhodes, and was probably born about 120 BC, but there is no evidence to connect him with sculpting.

One possibility is that either or both of the trios containing Agesander possessed the same names as sculptors from an earlier period, perhaps as members of the same family or workshop tradition.

Controversy over the general date of Agesander&#x27;s life, or the lives of various Agesanders, has never been settled; it was previously discussed on the grounds of artistic style, but now the evidence of inscriptions has come into play. The 18th-century art historian Johann Joachim Winckelmann felt certain that, as sculptor of the &quot;Laocoön&quot; group, he was a contemporary of Lysippos in the 4th century BC; others have placed him as late as the 70s AD, in the reign of Vespasian. The death of Pliny in the eruption that destroyed Pompeii in 79 AD provides a &quot;terminus ante quem&quot; for the &quot;Laocoön&quot;, just as the collapsing grotto at Sperlonga in 26 AD does for those works. Modern scholarly consensus puts the likely time frame for these works as between 50 BC and 70 AD, though lively controversy continues as to more precise dating: a French article of 1997 was called &quot;Un conflit qui s&#x27;éternise: La guerre de Sperlonga&quot;, or &quot;A conflict which is becoming endless: the War of Sperlonga&quot;.

Rice makes the confident and convenient but perhaps unwarranted assumption that only one Athenodoros, the son of Agesander, practiced as a sculptor, and that he signed the Lindos statue in 42 BC, a prestigious commission not likely to be given to a young artist. Reconstructing his proposed and putative career as a famous sculptor, Athenodoros flourished up to perhaps about 10 BC, working in Italy for perhaps most of the latter part of his career. Some time before about 10 BC he was first the second sculptor of the &quot;Laocoön&quot;, probably under his father Agesandros, and at a later date was the lead sculptor of Sperlonga. He was probably also related to the Sperlonga Agesander, son of Paionios, although this Agesander was not his father, and Rice does not speculate how the Sperlonga Agesander (the second name listed on the inscription there) might fit in.

<doc id="1301574" wikidata="Q530124" url="?curid=1301574" title="Order of Culture">
<text>The is a Japanese order, established on February 11, 1937. The order has one class only, and may be awarded to men and women for contributions to Japan&#x27;s art, literature, science, technology, or anything related to culture in general; recipients of the order also receive an annuity for life. The order is conferred by the Emperor of Japan in person on Culture Day (November 3) each year. It is considered equivalent to the highest rank (Grand Cordon) of the Order of the Rising Sun, the Order of the Sacred Treasure, and the Order of the Precious Crown. The only orders that Japanese emperors bestow on recipients by their own hands are the Collar of the Supreme Order of the Chrysanthemum, the Grand Cordon of each order, and the Order of Culture.

The badge of the order, which is in gold with white enamel, is in the form of a Tachibana orange blossom; the central disc bears three crescent-shaped jades (&quot;magatama&quot;). The badge is suspended on a gold and enamel wreath of mandarin orange leaves and fruit, which is in turn suspended on a purple ribbon worn around the neck.

==System of recognition==

The Order of Culture and Persons of Cultural Merit function together in honoring contributions to the advancement and development of Japanese culture in a variety of fields such as academia, arts and others.

===Order of Culture===
The Emperor himself presents the honor at the award ceremony, which takes place at the Imperial Palace on the Day of Culture (November 3). Candidates for the Order of Culture are selected from the Persons of Cultural Merit by the Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, upon hearing views of all the members of the selection committee for the Persons of Cultural Merit. The Minister then recommends the candidates to the Prime Minister so that they can be decided by the Cabinet.

===Persons of Cultural Merit===

The system for Persons of Cultural Merit was established in 1951 by the &quot;Law on Pensions for the Persons of Cultural Merit.&quot; Since the Constitution of Japan stipulates that &quot;No privilege shall accompany any award of honor, decoration or any distinction&quot; (Article 14), the government is not allowed to provide pensions or rewards to recipients of the Order of Culture. The purpose is to honor persons of cultural merit (including recipients of the Order of Culture) by providing a special government-sponsored pension (3.5 million yen per year). Since 1955, the new honorees have been announced on the Day of Culture, the same day as the award ceremony for the Order of Culture.

At first the person who instituted the games and defrayed the expenses was the &quot;agonothetes&quot;; but in the great public games, such as the Olympic Games and Pythian Games, these presidents were the representatives of different states, or were chosen from the people in whose country the games were celebrated; thus at the Panathenaic Games at Athens ten &quot;&quot; were elected for four years to superintend the various contests.

In English, by confusion with the native &quot;-s&quot; plural form, the singular &quot;agonothete&quot; and plural &quot;agonothetes&quot; are sometimes encountered.

<doc id="1301579" wikidata="Q11499112" url="?curid=1301579" title="Church and state in medieval Europe">
<text>Church and state in medieval Europe was the relationship between the Catholic Church and the various monarchies and other states in Europe during the Middle Ages (between the end of Roman authority in the West in the fifth century to their end in the East in the fifteenth century and the beginning of the Modern era).

==Origins==
Church gradually became a defining institution of the Roman Empire. Emperor Constantine issued the Edict of Milan in 313 proclaiming toleration for the Christian religion, and convoked the First Council of Nicaea in 325 whose Nicene Creed included belief in &quot;one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church&quot;. Emperor Theodosius I made Nicene Christianity the state church of the Roman Empire with the Edict of Thessalonica of 380.

Pope Leo the Great defined the role of the state as being a defender of the church&#x27;s cause and a suppressor of heresies in a letter to the Eastern Roman Emperor Leo I: &quot;You ought unhesitatingly to recognize that the Royal Power has been conferred to you not only for the Rule of the world, but especially for the defense of the Church, so that by suppressing the heinous undertakings you may defend those Statutes which are good and restore True Peace to those things which have been disordered&quot;.

After the fall of the Roman Empire in the 5th century, there emerged no single powerful secular government in the West. There was however a central ecclesiastical power in Rome, the Catholic Church. In this power vacuum, the church rose to become the dominant power in the West. The church started expanding in the 10th century, and as secular kingdoms gained power at the same time, there naturally arose the conditions for a power struggle between church and state over ultimate authority.

The earliest vision of Christendom was a vision of a Christian theocracy, a government founded upon and upholding Christian values, whose institutions are spread through and over with Christian doctrine. In this period, members of the Christian clergy wield political authority. The specific relationship between the political leaders and the clergy varied but, in theory, the national and political divisions were at times subsumed under the leadership of the Catholic Church as an institution. This model of Church–State relations was accepted by various Church leaders and political leaders in European history.

The classical heritage flourished throughout the Middle Ages in both the Byzantine Greek East and the Latin West. In the Greek philosopher Plato&#x27;s ideal state there are three major classes, which was representative of the idea of the &quot;tripartite soul&quot;, which is expressive of three functions or capacities of the human soul: &quot;reason&quot;, &quot;the spirited element&quot;, and &quot;appetites&quot; (or &quot;passions&quot;). Will Durant made a convincing case that certain prominent features of Plato&#x27;s ideal community were discernible in the organization, dogma and effectiveness of &quot;the&quot; Medieval Church in Europe:

... For a thousand years Europe was ruled by an order of guardians considerably like that which was visioned by our philosopher. During the Middle Ages it was customary to classify the population of Christendom into laboratores (workers), bellatores (soldiers), and oratores (clergy). The last group, though small in number, monopolized the instruments and opportunities of culture, and ruled with almost unlimited sway half of the most powerful continent on the globe. The clergy, like Plato&#x27;s guardians, were placed in authority... by their talent as shown in ecclesiastical studies and administration, by their disposition to a life of meditation and simplicity, and ... by the influence of their relatives with the powers of state and church. In the latter half of the period in which they ruled [800 AD onwards], the clergy were as free from family cares as even Plato could desire [for such guardians]... [Clerical] Celibacy was part of the psychological structure of the power of the clergy; for on the one hand they were unimpeded by the narrowing egoism of the family, and on the other their apparent superiority to the call of the flesh added to the awe in which lay sinners held them... In the latter half of the period in which they ruled, the clergy were as free from family cares as even Plato could desire.

The Catholic Church&#x27;s peak of authority over all European Christians and their common endeavours of the Christian community — for example, the Crusades, the fight against the Moors in the Iberian Peninsula and against the Ottomans in the Balkans — helped to develop a sense of communal identity against the obstacle of Europe&#x27;s deep political divisions. This authority was also used by local Inquisitions to root out divergent elements and create a religiously uniform community.

The conflict between Church and state was in many ways a uniquely Western phenomenon originating in Late Antiquity (see Saint Augustine&#x27;s &quot;City of God&quot; (417)). The Papal States in Italy, today downsized to the State of Vatican, were ruled directly by the Holy See. Moreover, throughout the Middle Ages the Pope claimed the right to depose the Catholic kings of Western Europe, and tried to exercise it, sometimes successfully (see the investiture controversy, below), sometimes not, as with Henry VIII of England and Henry III of Navarre. However, in the Eastern Roman Empire, also known as the Byzantine Empire, Church and state were closely linked and collaborated in a &quot;symphony&quot;, with some exceptions (see Iconoclasm).

Before the Age of Absolutism, institutions, such as the Church, legislatures, or social elites, restrained monarchical power. Absolutism was characterized by the ending of feudal partitioning, consolidation of power with the monarch, rise of the state, rise of professional standing armies, creation of professional bureaucracies, codification of state laws, and the rise of ideologies that justify the absolutist monarchy. Hence, absolutism was made possible by new innovations and characterized as a phenomenon of Early Modern Europe, rather than that of the Middle Ages, where the clergy and nobility counterbalanced as a result of mutual rivalry.

==Historical events==
===Investiture controversy===

When the Holy Roman Empire developed as a force from the tenth century, it was the first real non-barbarian challenge to the authority of the Church. A dispute between the secular and ecclesiastical powers emerged known as the Investiture Controversy, beginning in the mid-eleventh century and was resolved with the Concordat of Worms in 1122. While on the surface it was over a matter of official procedures regarding the appointments of offices, underneath was a powerful struggle for control over who held ultimate authority, the King or the Pope.

===Philip the Fair===
Pope Boniface VIII put some of the strongest claims to temporal as well as spiritual supremacy of any Pope and intervened incessantly in foreign affairs. He proclaimed that it &quot;is necessary for salvation that every living creature be under submission to the Roman pontiff&quot;, pushing Papal Supremacy to its historical extreme. Boniface&#x27;s quarrel with Philip the Fair became so resentful that he excommunicated him in 1303. However, before the Pope could lay France under an interdict, Boniface was seized by Philip. Although he was released from captivity after three days, he died of shock one month later. No subsequent popes were to repeat Boniface VIII&#x27;s claims.

===Thomas Becket===
Although initially close to King Henry II, as Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Becket became an independent figure. King Henry devoted his reign to the restoration of the royal customs of his grandfather King Henry I, as part of this he wanted to extend his authority over the Church and limit its freedoms. The Becket dispute revolved around the Constitutions of Clarendon, a document which Becket and the Pope largely condemned. Becket eventually fled England and went into exile in France; during these six years there were a number of attempts at restoring peace. The fourth meeting at Fréteval ended in an agreement and Becket decided to return to Canterbury. However the King reneged on his promises made at Fréteval and in response Becket produced a number of censures on royal officials and clergymen. Four barons of the King sought to gain the King&#x27;s favour and therefore proceeded to Canterbury Cathedral to confront Becket; some claim that they intended to scare and possibly arrest Becket rather than to kill him. Nonetheless after a heated argument the four barons murdered Becket on the steps of the altar in Canterbury Cathedral. The King publicly expressed remorse for this killing, but took no action to arrest Becket&#x27;s killers. He attended Canterbury in sackcloth and ashes as an act of public penance. Later in 1174 he submitted himself before the tomb of Thomas Becket, thus recognizing St. Thomas&#x27;s sanctity.

===Guelphs and Ghibellines===
The conflict between the Guelphs and Ghibellines began as part of the secular-papal struggle. Guelf (also spelled Guelph) and Ghibelline, were members of two opposing factions in German and Italian politics during the Middle Ages. The split between the Guelfs, who were sympathetic to the papacy, and the Ghibellines, who were sympathetic to the German (Holy Roman) emperors, contributed to chronic strife within the cities of northern Italy in the 13th and 14th centuries.
===First Crusade===
There was some uncertainty about what would happen to Jerusalem after it was conquered in 1099. Godfrey de Bouillon refused to take the title &quot;king&quot;, and was instead called &quot;Defender of the Holy Sepulcher&quot;. Dagobert of Pisa was named Patriarch in 1100, and attempted to turn the new state into a theocracy, with a secular state to be created elsewhere, perhaps in Cairo. Godfrey soon died however and was succeeded by his brother Baldwin, who did not hesitate to call himself king and actively opposed Dagobert&#x27;s plans. By Dagobert&#x27;s death in 1107, Jerusalem was a secular kingdom.

<text>Adric is a fictional character played by Matthew Waterhouse in the long-running British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. He was a young native of the planet Alzarius, which exists in the parallel universe of E-Space. A companion of the Fourth and Fifth Doctors, he was a regular in the programme from 1980 to 1982 and appeared in 11 stories (40 episodes). The name Adric is an anagram derived from the physicist Paul Dirac.

==Character history==
Adric first appears in the Fourth Doctor serial &quot;Full Circle&quot;. Attempting to escape from the mistfall threatening his community, he stumbles across and finds refuge in the TARDIS, which has been drawn into E-Space via a wormhole-like phenomenon known as a Charged Vacuum Emboitment. He stows away when the Doctor, Romana and K9 Mark II leave Alzarius and becomes a companion in the following serial, &quot;State of Decay&quot;, accompanying them on the rest of their adventures in E-Space. He remains with the Doctor when Romana and K-9 leave and the TARDIS finds its way back into its own universe.

With a brilliant mathematical mind and wearing a star-shaped badge for mathematical excellence, Adric is well aware of his own intelligence. This, coupled with his relative immaturity, leads to a personality that is abrasive and occasionally crosses over into arrogance. As a result, Adric is one of the least popular, or even &quot;most hated&quot;, of the Doctor&#x27;s companions among fans of the programme. However, Adric also seeks validation from the Doctor and those around him, and is often hurt and resentful if he feels he is being sidelined or unable to contribute. As an Alzarian, Adric is a member of a highly adaptable species, theoretically capable of genetically evolving to suit any environment, although it is unknown whether his particular substrain is capable of this. It is known that he possesses an inhumanly rapid rate of healing, though not to the extent he can regenerate amputated body parts.

Adric is present when, during the events of &quot;Logopolis&quot;, the Fourth Doctor falls from the Pharos Project radio telescope and regenerates into his fifth incarnation. He continues to travel in the TARDIS along with new companions Nyssa and Tegan, but his travels come to an end in &quot;Earthshock&quot; when he tries to stop a Cyberman-controlled freighter from crashing into Earth. The navigational controls are locked by logic codes, and Adric is entering the solution to the last code when the computer is destroyed by a dying Cyberman. He dies in the crash, while his crewmates watch in horror on the TARDIS viewscreen. His last words before the explosion kills him are &quot;Now I&#x27;ll never know if I was right.&quot; Adric dies not knowing that the freighter he was trying to stop would become the &quot;meteor&quot; that would wipe out the dinosaurs and lead to the rise of mammals and eventually humans (see Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event and Alvarez hypothesis).

Adric&#x27;s death affects his companions deeply. In &quot;Time-Flight&quot;, Tegan tries to persuade the Doctor to go back in time and save him, but the Doctor refuses to break the Laws of Time, even though it obviously pains him. In an effort to stop Nyssa and Tegan from travelling further, the Xeraphin try to use an illusion of Adric, pleading that if they travelled further they would kill him. They see through the deception when they realise Adric is still wearing his badge (which the Doctor had destroyed in order to kill the Cyber Leader) and travel forth, giving Adric another illusory death scene. Adric also appears as a hallucination at the end of &quot;The Caves of Androzani&quot;, and his name is the last word that the Fifth Doctor says before regenerating into the Sixth Doctor.

Decades later, in &quot;The Power of the Doctor&quot;, Tegan works to help UNIT fight back an invasion of Cybermen. An artificial intelligence projection of the Thirteenth Doctor appears before assuming the form of the Fifth Doctor. The two reconcile, with the Doctor assuring Tegan he has not forgotten about any of his companions. Tegan asks what the Doctor thinks is on her mind when surrounded by Cybermen. &quot;Adric,&quot; the Doctor responds.

==Appearances in other media==
Adric&#x27;s sole appearance in the Virgin Missing Adventures range was in the Lance Parkin novel &quot;Cold Fusion&quot;, during which he meets the Seventh Doctor, who treats Adric warmly despite the future Doctor&#x27;s distaste for his past self, with the Seventh&#x27;s companion Roz comparing the Doctor&#x27;s interaction with Adric to a grandfather complimenting a grandson. Adric also appears in the Past Doctor Adventures novel &quot;Divided Loyalties&quot;, which pits the Doctor against his old foe the Celestial Toymaker. Adric&#x27;s image also appears as a manifestation of the Doctor&#x27;s guilt in the Virgin New Adventures novel &quot;&quot; by Paul Cornell, and a ghost of Adric features in the novel &quot;Empire of Death&quot; by David Bishop.

Adric appears in the Big Finish Productions audio drama &quot;The Boy That Time Forgot&quot;, portrayed by Andrew Sachs. In the story, he is unintentionally saved by Block Transfer Computations subconsciously sent to him by the Doctor during a &#x27;seance&#x27;; this caused him to be sent into a pocket dimension, based on an Aztec jungle and populated primarily by giant scorpions and insects. Kept alive for centuries by the computations, Adric is eventually reunited with the Doctor and Nyssa when they seek the TARDIS after its theft by Thomas Brewster (&quot;The Haunting of Thomas Brewster&quot;). Driven insane by centuries of isolation and bitterness, Adric refuses to accept the Doctor&#x27;s opinion that he is now essentially just an elderly teenager having tantrums when he doesn&#x27;t get his way, and attempts to force Nyssa to become his bride. The Doctor admits that he permitted Adric to die, only for Adric to forgive him and use the last of his strength to send his friends home and recover the TARDIS, before dying himself.

In the IDW Publishing comic &quot;Doctor Who: The Forgotten&quot; by Tony Lee, a manifestation of Adric appears in the TARDIS Matrix, saving the Tenth Doctor&#x27;s life and, in the process, dying a second time. This time, however, Adric is aware of his sacrifice, stating that &quot;it&#x27;s not a pointless death&quot;.

Adric appears in &quot;Universes Beyond: Doctor Who&quot; as &quot;Adric, Mathematical Genius.&quot; He is identified as a human, and the card references his &quot;ultimate sacrifice.&quot;

==Other mentions==
A vision of Adric is seen, along with every other companion aside from Leela, on the scanner screen in &quot;Resurrection of the Daleks&quot;.

Adric&#x27;s death is discussed between an older Tegan and a hologram projection of the Fifth Doctor in &quot;The Power of the Doctor&quot; after the former is reunited with the Cybermen.

Adric&#x27;s death is mentioned by the Fifteenth Doctor in the 60th Anniversary Specials as he and the Fourteenth Doctor discuss Fourteen retiring.

==Concept and creation==
During the production of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;&#x27;s eighteenth season it became clear that Romana (Lalla Ward) and K9 would be leaving the series and that Tom Baker would depart his role as the Doctor at the conclusion of the season. To give viewers a sense of continuity it was decided that new companions should be introduced during the series, with the first, Adric being added as early as possible so he would be well established by the season&#x27;s climax. He was described as a &quot;cosmic Artful Dodger&quot; by producer John Nathan-Turner who intended him to be &quot;a roguish roughneck&quot;, whose charm would offset the criminal tendencies which emerged from his upbringing. However Waterhouse later noted that the Adric was written differently in each story and thus the character suffered from a lack of development.

Unimpressed by Waterhouse&#x27;s acting ability, Tom Baker suggested that, &quot;Because of his amazing appearance, Matthew should have played Adric like Sabu – a little wild boy who couldn&#x27;t speak. I would talk to him rather like Basil Fawlty talks to Manuel, and he&#x27;d just nod or shake his head. But John [Nathan-Turner] didn&#x27;t like that idea.&quot; Andrew Sachs, who played Manuel, would later portray Adric in a single story for Big Finish Productions.

<text>Philippe Henri de Girard (February 1, 1775 – August 26, 1845aged 70) was a French engineer and inventor of the first flax spinning frame in 1810, and the person after whom the town of Żyrardów in Poland was named. He was also the uncredited inventor of food preservation using tin cans.

==Biography==
Girard was born in the village of Lourmarin in the &quot;département&quot; of Vaucluse, France, to a wealthy aristocratic family. As a child, he was sent by his parents to some of the most notable French schools of the era. However, in the effect of the French Revolution, his family was forced to flee France and young Philippe had to abandon his studies in order to help his family earn money for living.

In May 1810 Napoleon I tried to stop English cotton fabrics from entering the continent of Europe and offered a reward of one million francs to any inventor who could devise the best machinery for the spinning of flax yarn. After only a short period Philippe de Girard took out a French patent for important inventions for both dry and wet methods of spinning flax. He was not awarded the prize money and failed to gain the recognition he felt was deserved. He had been counting on the prize money to pay the expenses of his invention, and he got into serious financial difficulties. So he accepted, when in 1815 he was invited by the Austrian government to establish a spinning mill in Hirtenberg near Vienna, which employed his spinning frames. However, it failed to prove a commercial success. 

In 1817 Girard returned to France with a prototype of his spinning machinery ready, but the internal situation of France after the fall of Napoleon Bonaparte prevented the new French authorities from payment of the debts and eventually, Girard sold his patent to England.
His inventions were patented in England in 1814, by Horace Hall (possibly a pseudonym).
It would not have been easy for a French man to introduce a new development into England at this point in history. It never really caught on.

In the British Isles James Kay was initially credited with the invention. Although, on December 2, 1826, shortly after Kay’s patent was awarded, Girard seems to have been prompted to write to the editor of &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; complaining about this and pointing out he had been the inventor. A court invalidated Kay&#x27;s patent in 1839, stating it was too similar to Horace Hall&#x27;s, a decision upheld on appeal in 1841. The fact that Horace Hall made no complaint might suggest this name being a pseudonym.

Several years afterward the situation in France improved and Girard started the first modern textile factory in Lille. Initially the business was a failure and Girard almost went bankrupt.

In 1825, through an old army connection, baron Piotr Galichet, who had settled in Poland, he was hired by the government of the Kingdom of Poland to help develop a Polish textile industry. He became consultant to the Polish government, as well as the Bank Polski. Because of the financial support of the latter, in 1831 he organized the first major factory of his project in Marymont near Warsaw. Two years later he was invited by relatives of Galichet, the Łubieński brothers with his business to their estate at Ruda Guzowska, where the factory had better prospects. Soon it became a great success and brought fame and prosperity both to the settlement and to Girard. In honour of Girard, Ruda Guzowska was renamed, &quot;Żyrardów&quot;, a toponym derived of the polonised spelling of Girard&#x27;s name.

In 1844 Girard returned to France, where he planned to open more factories. However, he died the following year. Apart from the town of Żyrardów (currently one of the biggest satellite towns of Warsaw), Girard had a street and a college in 18th arrondissement of Paris named after him and two secondary schools, one in Żyrardów, the other in Avignon.

After his death in Paris, his work was recognised and his descendants were rewarded with a small pension by the French Emperor.

==Other projects==
In 1806 he exhibited an improvement to oil lamps, and in the same year made some improvement to the steam engine, producing a rotary motion without a walking beam. In 1814 he constructed a steam machine gun that was written about in several French publications between then and 1824. The gun used six barrels that were fed by hoppers and was said to achieve a firing rate of about 180 rounds per minute. In 1818 he built a Steamship to run on the Danube.

<doc id="1301587" wikidata="Q883102" url="?curid=1301587" title="Blue-gray tanager">
<text>The blue-gray tanager (Thraupis episcopus) is a medium-sized South American songbird of the tanager family, Thraupidae. Its range is from Mexico south to northeast Bolivia and northern Brazil, all of the Amazon Basin, except the very south. It has been introduced to Lima (Peru). On Trinidad and Tobago, this bird is called blue jean.

==Taxonomy==
In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the blue-gray tanager in his &quot;Ornithologie&quot; based on a specimen collected in Brazil. He used the French name and the Latin name &quot;Episcopus avis&quot;. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson in his &quot;Ornithologie&quot;. One of these was the blue-gray tanager. Linnaeus included a terse description, coined the binomial name &quot;Tanagra episcopus,&quot; and cited Brisson&#x27;s work. The specific name &quot;episcopus&quot; is Latin for &quot;bishop&quot;. The current genus &quot;Thraupis&quot; was introduced by the German naturalist Friedrich Boie in 1826.

There are 14 recognized subspecies, differing according to the exact hue of blue of the shoulder patch versus the rest of the plumage; they may be grayish, greenish, or purplish-blue, with a lavender, dark blue, or whitish shoulder patch. For example, &quot;T. e. berlepschi&quot; (endemic to Tobago) is a brighter and darker blue on the rump and shoulder; &quot;T. e. neosophilus&quot; with a violet shoulder patch occurs in northern Venezuela, Trinidad, eastern Colombia, and the far north of Brazil; &quot;T. e. mediana&quot; of the southern Amazon basin has a white wing patch; and &quot;T. e. cana&quot; in the northern Amazon has blue shoulders.

==Description==
The blue-gray tanager is long and weighs . Adults have a light bluish head and underparts, with darker blue upperparts and a shoulder patch colored a different shade of blue. The bill is short and quite thick. Sexes are similar, but the immature is much duller in plumage.

The song is a squeaky twittering, interspersed with &quot;tseee&quot; and &quot;tsuup&quot; call notes.

==Breeding and habitat==
The breeding habitat is open woodland, cultivated areas, and gardens. The blue-gray tanager lives mainly on fruit, but will also take some nectar, insects, and other arthropods. This is a common, restless, noisy, and confiding species, usually found in pairs, but sometimes small groups. It thrives around human habitation, and will take some cultivated fruit like papayas (&quot;Carica papaya&quot;).

One to three, usually two, dark-marked whitish to gray-green eggs are laid in a deep cup nest in a high tree fork or building crevice. Incubation by the female is 14 days with another 17 to fledging. The nest is sometimes parasitised by &quot;Molothrus&quot; cowbirds.

Two birds studied in the Parque Nacional de La Macarena of Colombia were infected with microfilariae, an undetermined &quot;Trypanosoma&quot; species, and another blood parasite that could not be identified. Two other birds, examined near Turbo (also in Colombia), did not have blood parasites.

==Agricultural ecology==
&quot;T. episcopus&quot; prospers in some areas cleared by humans for grazing, but is not as attracted to buildings or high human or livestock activity. They continue to live in forests but eagerly move temporarily into abandoned pasture land for wild fruits and have been variously found to never forage or merely to forage less often in pasture that has livestock in it. &quot;T. episcopus&quot; is more common in secondary forest resulting from slash-and-burn followed by abandonment than in primary forest.

&quot;T. episcopus&quot; is commonly infected with &quot;Blastocystis&quot; parasites, specifically Subtype 6 (ST6) which was exclusive to birds in that area. ST6 was never found in cows in the area, but it was unassessed whether &quot;T. episcopus&quot; shares ST6 with nearby domesticated bird flocks.

==Status==
Widespread and common throughout its large range, the blue-gray tanager is evaluated as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

<doc id="1301595" wikidata="Q1516546" url="?curid=1301595" title="Diablo Canyon Power Plant">
<text>The Diablo Canyon Power Plant is a nuclear power plant near Avila Beach in San Luis Obispo County, California. Following the permanent shutdown of the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station in 2013, Diablo Canyon is now the only operational nuclear plant in California, as well as the state&#x27;s largest single power station. It was the subject of controversy and protests during its construction, with nearly two thousand civil disobedience arrests in a two-week period in 1981.

The plant has two Westinghouse-designed 4-loop pressurized-water nuclear reactors operated by Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E). Together, the twin 1100 MWe reactors produce about 18,000 GW·h of electricity annually (8.6% of total California generation and 23% of carbon-free generation), supplying the electrical needs of more than 3 million people. The plant produces electricity for about 6 cents per kWh, less than the average cost of 10.1 cents per kWh that PG&amp;E paid for electricity from other suppliers in 2014.

Though it was built less than a mile from the Shoreline Fault line, which was not known to exist at the time of construction, and is located less than from the Hosgri fault, a 2016 NRC probabilistic risk assessment of the plant, taking into account seismic risk, estimated the frequency of core damage at one instance per 7.6 million reactor years. The plant is located in Nuclear Regulatory Commission Region IV.

In 2016, PG&amp;E announced that it plans to close the two Diablo Canyon reactors in 2024 and 2025, stating that because California&#x27;s energy regulations give renewables priority over nuclear, the plant would likely only run half-time, making it uneconomical. (Nuclear plants are used for base load in order to spread their large fixed costs over as many kWh of generation as possible.) In 2020, experts at the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) warned that when the plant closes the state will reach a &quot;critical inflection point&quot;, which will create a significant challenge to ensure reliability of the grid without resorting to more fossil fuel usage, and could jeopardize California&#x27;s greenhouse gas reduction targets. In 2021 the California Energy Commission and CAISO warned that the state may have summer blackouts in future years as a result of Diablo&#x27;s closure coinciding with the shutdown of four natural gas plants of 3.7GW total capacity, and the inability to rely on imported electricity during West-wide heat waves due to reduced hydroelectric capacity (from the decades-long drought) and the closure of coal plants. A 2021 report from researchers at MIT and Stanford states that keeping Diablo Canyon running until 2035 would reduce the state&#x27;s carbon emissions from electricity generation by 11% every year, save the state a cumulative $2.6 billion (rising to $21 billion if kept open until 2045), and improve the reliability of the grid. Full decommissioning of the plant is estimated to take decades and cost nearly $4 billion.

==Operation==

Diablo Canyon Power Plant is on approximately of land located just west of Avila Beach, California. The power-producing portion of the plant occupies around . PG&amp;E owns a total of of land at the site.

===Unit One===
Unit One is a 1138 MWe pressurized water reactor supplied by Westinghouse. It went online on May 7, 1985, and is licensed to operate through November 2, 2024. In 2006, Unit One generated 9,944,983 MW·h of electricity, at a nominal capacity factor of 99.8 percent.

===Unit Two===
Unit Two is a 1118 MWe pressurized water reactor supplied by Westinghouse. It went online on March 3, 1986, and is licensed to operate through August 20, 2025. In 2006, Unit Two generated 8,520,000 MW·h of electricity, at a capacity factor of 87.0 percent.

=== Cooling ===
The plant&#x27;s once-through cooling system (OTC) draws water from the Pacific Ocean to condense steam driving its turbines. Unlike evaporative cooling systems used at other plants, Diablo Canyon&#x27;s OTC is designed so all water can be recycled, and to assure minimal impact on ocean ecosystems. Reactors can be throttled back during heavy storm surges to prevent an excess of kelp from entering the cooling water intake, and power is limited during operation so that water returned to the ocean is no more than warmer than ambient temperature.

All thermal power stations in California using OTC systems for cooling employ various filtering capabilities to prevent larvae and other aquatic objects from being drawn into impacts with the grids on the intake tubes, known as entrainment. The Diablo Canyon facility was ranked 13th in estimated power station bio-fouling and egg larvae damage in the state of California in 2013; the less productive fossil gas power units 6 &amp; 7 at Moss Landing Power Plant were ranked as having a far higher impact on fish larvae. In 2014, the California Water Board released a white paper detailing the costs to convert Diablo Canyon to utilize cooling towers instead of the once-through cooling cycle. These upgrade cost estimates have been the subject of controversy and debate, with some arguing instead for construction of an artificial reef to better offset the environmental impact of diminished larvae spawning.

=== Cost of generated electricity ===
The plant produces electricity for about 6 cents per kWh, less than the average cost of 10.1 cents per kWh that PG&amp;E paid for electricity from other suppliers in 2014.
=== Labor ===
There are approximately 1,200 employees of Pacific Gas &amp; Electric and 200 employees of subcontractors at the Diablo Canyon site. Several unions represent the workforce at Diablo, among them the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) and the International Association of Machinists. The routine outages for maintenance, and the complex process of refueling, create more than 1,000 temporary jobs, according to PG&amp;E. The staff uses generative artificial intelligence to find and organize data from the large documentation.

==History==
Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Company went through six years of hearings, referendums and litigation to have the Diablo Canyon plant approved. A principal concern about the plant is whether it can be sufficiently earthquake-proof; the site was deemed safe when construction began in 1968, but a seismic fault (the Hosgri fault) had been discovered several miles offshore by the time the plant was completed in 1973. This fault experienced a 7.1 magnitude quake 10 miles offshore on November 4, 1927, and thus is capable of generating forces equivalent to approximately of those felt in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.

The company updated its plans and added structural supports designed to reinforce stability in case of earthquake. In September 1981, PG&amp;E discovered that a single set of blueprints was used for these structural supports; workers were supposed to have reversed the plans when switching to the second reactor, but did not. Nonetheless, on March 19, 1982, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission decided not to review its 1978 decision approving the plant&#x27;s safety, despite these and other design errors.

In response to concern that ground acceleration, or shaking, could cause spillage of submerged fuel rod assemblies which could ignite upon exposure to air, PG&amp;E and NRC regulators insist that the foregoing scenario is anticipated and controlled for, and that there is no basis to anticipate spillage. The launch of additional seismic studies did not delay re-issuance of the operating licenses for the two onsite units.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission&#x27;s estimate of the risk each year of an earthquake intense enough to cause core damage to the reactor at Diablo Canyon was 1 in 23,810, according to an NRC study published in August 2010.

In 2009, PG&amp;E applied to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for 20-year license renewals for both reactors.

In April 2011, in the wake of the Fukushima nuclear incident in Japan, PG&amp;E asked the NRC not to issue license renewals until PG&amp;E could complete new seismic studies, which were expected to take at least three years.

On June 24, 2013, at 9:20 PM PDT, Diablo Canyon experienced a loss of offsite power to the startup transformers of both units due to a failure on the 230 kV transmission system. At the time, none of the startup transformers were loaded as both units were online and their electrical systems were at the time being powered by the plant&#x27;s turbine generators. However, the emergency diesel generators were started with no load during the outage as a precaution in case either unit tripped offline while offsite power was unavailable. The electrical output of the plant via the 500 kV transmission system was not interrupted, allowing both units to remain online during the outage.

===Public participation and protest===

Diablo Canyon was built and entered service in the midst of legal challenges and civil disobedience from the anti-nuclear protesters of the Abalone Alliance. Over a two-week period in 1981, 1,900 activists were arrested and sent to jail for protesting at Diablo Canyon Power Plant, including musician/activist Jackson Browne. It was the largest arrest total in the history of the U.S. anti-nuclear movement.

In spring of 2011, State Senator Sam Blakeslee and US Representative Lois Capps both expressed concern for a renewed safety review. Speaking before the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, Representative Capps stated that she believed the &quot;Nuclear Regulatory Commission should stay the license renewal process until the completion of independent, peer reviewed, advanced seismic studies of all faults in the area.&quot; The Alliance for Nuclear Responsibility began circulating a petition to similar effect, going further and calling for an outright halt to relicensing. An array of San Luis Obispo-based anti-nuclear groups including Mothers for Peace also called for closure of the plant.

=== Post-Fukushima developments ===
Due to international reactions to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, concerns have continued over the ongoing operations of Diablo Canyon which, like the reactors at Fukushima, is in an area prone to earthquakes and tsunami. The elevation of the Fukushima site is approximately above sea level, while Diablo Canyon sits on a bluff above sea level. According to Victor Dricks, senior public affairs officer for NRC Region IV, the Commission conducted a nationwide review of nuclear power plants for their capacity to respond to earthquakes, power outages and other catastrophic events, and Diablo was found to have &quot;a high level of preparedness and strong capability in terms of equipment and procedures to respond to severe events.&quot;

On June 2, 2011, the NRC announced that it would delay the environmental part of the re-licensing application but that it had completed the safety portion. A few days later, the Atomic Safety Licensing Board (ASLB) indicated that it would defer adjustment of the adjudicatory schedule of the four contentions brought by San Luis Obispo Mothers for Peace (SLOMFP), a community-based anti-nuclear organization, accordingly. The ASLB made no findings regarding the merits of the contentions; both PG&amp;E and SLOMFP claimed these developments as victories.

S. David Freeman, a former general manager of the Sacramento Municipal Utility District for four years, criticized the continued operation of Diablo Canyon, calling nuclear power the &quot;most expensive and dangerous source of energy on Earth.&quot; According to Freeman, Diablo Canyon and the since-closed San Onofre nuclear plant are both &quot;disasters waiting to happen: aging, unreliable reactors sitting near fault zones on the fragile Pacific Coast, with millions or hundreds of thousands of Californians living nearby.&quot;

===Closure extension ===
In January 2016, several authors of An Ecomodernist Manifesto (including Robert Stone, David Keith, Stewart Brand, Michael Shellenberger, Mark Lynas) signed an open letter to California Governor Jerry Brown, Tony Earley, CEO of Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, and California state officials, urging that the plant not be closed. They argued that Diablo is an asset for California in achieving global warming goals since it does not emit greenhouse gases like a natural gas power plant, which are a major contributor to global warming.

S. David Freeman and Damon Moglen from the environmental advocacy group Friends of the Earth, (which was founded in 1969 to oppose Diablo Canyon&#x27;s construction), commissioned a study to estimate whether it could be cost-effective to replace Diablo with zero-carbon resources. Their study estimated that California will need less grid electricity in the next two decades, and that expected costs to extend Diablo&#x27;s licenses would be around $17 billion vs. $12–15 billion for replacing it with renewables and energy efficiency. Freeman and Moglen then arranged for a meeting with PG&amp;E&#x27;s vice president of policy and federal affairs to present her with their report. The group invited Ralph Cavanagh from the Natural Resources Defense Council, as well as other environmental groups. They included the plant&#x27;s unions in their discussion, who agreed to closing the plant after being offered $350 million for retraining programs and retention bonuses. Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom, as a member of the State Lands Commission, was interested in moving the discussion along in part to allow for a slower, greener transition.

On June 21, 2016, PG&amp;E announced a Joint Proposal with Friends of the Earth, the Natural Resources Defense Council, Environment California, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1245, Coalition of California Utility Employees, and Alliance for Nuclear Responsibility to increase investment in energy efficiency, renewables and storage, while phasing out nuclear power.

One reason given by PG&amp;E for the closure is that under California&#x27;s electricity regulations, renewables are given priority over nuclear and fossil-fuel generation, which would likely have resulted in Diablo only running half-time, and because nuclear plants have large fixed costs, this would essentially double its per-kWh generation costs.
PG&amp;E&#x27;s CEO stated: “I am sorry to see it go, because from a national energy policy standpoint, we need greenhouse gas-free electricity,” Earley said. “But we are regulated by the state of California, and California’s policies are driving this.&quot;

Specifically, the operating licenses for Diablo Canyon Units 1 and 2 would not be renewed when they expire on November 2, 2024 and August 26, 2025, respectively. PG&amp;E&#x27;s application to close Diablo Canyon, including the Joint Proposal, was approved by the California Public Utilities Commission in January 2018. In February, PG&amp;E withdrew its application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for a licensing extension.

In October 2020, experts at the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) warned that when the plant retires the state will reach a &quot;critical inflection point&quot;, which will create a significant challenge to ensure reliability of the grid without resorting to more fossil fuel usage, and could jeopardize California&#x27;s greenhouse gas reduction targets.

According to David G. Victor, professor of innovation and public policy at UC San Diego: &quot;The politics against nuclear power in California are more powerful and organized than the politics in favor of a climate policy.&quot;

A 2021 report from researchers at MIT and Stanford states that keeping Diablo Canyon running until 2035 would reduce the state&#x27;s carbon emissions from electricity generation by 11% every year, save the state a cumulative $2.6 billion, and improve the reliability of the grid. They state that three factors have changed since the 2018 decision to close the plant: the state passed a new law (sb100) which requires 100% emissions-free electricity generation by 2045, the whole western US region is in a continuing mega-drought (limiting hydroelectric generation), and demand for electricity has outpaced supply, especially during heatwaves. They also stated that keeping Diablo operating until 2045 would save the state a cumulative $21 billion.

Steven Chu, energy secretary in the Obama administration, endorsed the study and said: “We are not in a position in the near-term future to go to 100% renewable energy, and there will be times when the wind doesn’t blow, the sun doesn’t shine and we will need some power that we can turn on and dispatch at will, and that leaves two choices: fossil fuel or nuclear&quot; and he noted that countries that have shut down their nuclear plants have ended up using more fossil fuels. He also called the decision to shutdown the plant &quot;distressing&quot; and said “Nuclear power is something we should reconsider, and we should ask PG&amp;E to reconsider.”

Some of the continued generation from the plant could be used for relieving the drought-caused water shortages by powering a desalination plant (costing half as much as the Carlsbad desalination plant for the same capacity), or to generate hydrogen as a carbon-free fuel for manufacturing and transportation uses, at half the cost of producing it with wind or solar power, with a smaller land footprint.

In October 2021 the California Energy Commission and CAISO stated that the state may have summer blackouts in future years as a result of Diablo&#x27;s closure coinciding with the shutdown of four natural gas plants of 3.7GW total capacity, and inability to rely on imported electricity during West-wide heat waves. (The reduction of importable electricity is due to both the decades-long drought reducing hydroelectric capacity, and the closing of coal plants.)

In a November 2021 opinion article, the editorial board of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said: &quot;If the state is serious about achieving carbon neutrality over the next few decades — and it should be — it cannot start by shutting down a source of emissions-free energy that accounts for nearly 10 percent of its in-state electricity production. A new report from experts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford University has made that point clearly: Closing down Diablo Canyon would be the definition of climate incoherence.&quot; and &quot;The report finds that without Diablo Canyon, the state’s electricity shortage would have been three times as severe during [2020]’s massive blackouts.&quot; and &quot;Closing Diablo Canyon would make the state’s energy transition costlier, longer and more chaotic.&quot;

In February 2022 a group of 79 scientists published an open letter highlighting that the plant provides 18 TWh of low-carbon electricity annually and its closure is at odds with decarbonization goals.

In response to these concerns, in August 2022 California Governor Gavin Newsom proposed providing PG&amp;E with a $1.4 billion loan to support the continued operation of Diablo Canyon for another 5 to 10 years. The California Legislature approved the loan on September 1 with the passage of Senate Bill 846. The bill also charged the California Public Utilities Commission with monitoring cost increases that might make the plant uneconomical to operate and to close the plant if its operations “prove to be economically disadvantageous, or even financially catastrophic, for California electricity consumers”. PG&amp;E is also expected to seek funding from a $6 billion federal program intended to support the continued operation of nuclear plants facing closure. PG&amp;E asked the NRC in October 2022 to resume consideration of a license renewal application initially submitted in 2009. Regulatory approvals will also be needed from the U.S. Department of Energy, California State Lands Commission, California Energy Commission, California Coastal Commission, and California Public Utilities Commission. 

The Department of Energy approved $1.1 billion in funding in November from the Civil Nuclear Credit program which was included in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.

====Lesson from Germany====
In 2011, Angela Merkel announced that Germany would shut down all its nuclear plants (which at the time generated 25% of the country&#x27;s electricity) by 2022 and replace that lost generation with renewables. The nuclear reductions that have taken place have resulted in 27% of the country&#x27;s electricity coming from coal, and increased usage of natural gas, with 40% of that coming from Russia. David Frum states that Americans, particularly Californians, should take a lesson from this as it relates to Diablo Canyon&#x27;s scheduled closure.

==Safety==
===Earthquake protection===

Diablo Canyon was originally designed to withstand a 6.75 magnitude earthquake from four faults, including the nearby San Andreas Fault and Hosgri Fault, but was later upgraded to withstand a 7.5 magnitude quake. It has redundant seismic monitoring and a safety system designed to shut it down promptly in the event of significant ground motion.

===Independent Safety Committee===
The Diablo Canyon Independent Safety Committee (DCISC) was established as a part of a settlement agreement entered into in June 1988 between the Division of Ratepayer Advocates of the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), the Attorney General for the State of California, and Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&amp;E). It consists of three members, one each appointed by the Governor, the Attorney General and the Chairperson of the California Energy Commission. They serve staggered three-year terms. The committee has no authority to direct PG&amp;E personnel.

===Emergency planning===
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission defines two emergency planning zones around nuclear power plants: a plume exposure pathway zone with a radius of , concerned primarily with exposure to, and inhalation of, airborne radioactive contamination, and an ingestion pathway zone of about , concerned primarily with ingestion of food and liquid contaminated by radioactivity.

The 2010 U.S. population within of Diablo Canyon was 26,123, an increase of 50.2% in a decade, according to an analysis of U.S. Census data for msnbc.com. The 2010 U.S. population within was 465,521, an increase of 22.4% since 2000. Cities within 50 miles include San Luis Obispo (12 miles to city center) and Paso Robles (31 miles to city center).

Emergency sirens were installed when the plant initially went operational. Federal law requires an early warning system that radiates out 10 miles from any nuclear facility. The county siren coverage goes farther, extending from Cayucos in the north to upper Nipomo to the south. All businesses are required to have a siren information sticker in their business generally located within the restrooms. Schools, government offices, and any other public building will have a PAZ card (Protective Action Zone). These cards show the 12 zones of evacuation with zone one being the plant itself. The cards also show the direction of evacuation on the highways.

==History==
===20th century mergers and acquisitions===
In 1939, the merger of Allegheny Steel of Pittsburgh and Ludlum Steel of Watervliet, New York created Allegheny Ludlum Corporation; prior to the merger, the companies had manufactured steel for the Chrysler Building and Empire State Building in New York City. Allegheny Steel had produced stainless steel brightwork for the Model A Ford starting in 1930.

Through the 1970s, Allegheny Ludlum periodically cooperated with Ford to build several one-off promotional cars with stainless steel bodies. Three such cars are on display in the Crawford Auto-Aviation Museum.

In 1978, the company acquired Wilkinson Sword and Scripto. A year later, Allegheny Ludlum acquired Kennedy Company, a maker of magnetic tape products for large computer systems for an undisclosed sum. In 1984, Allegheny Ludlum sold off Scripto to the Tokai Corporation of Japan.

In 1986, the company suffered a $198 million operating loss and chairman Robert Buckley, stepped down amid accusations of mismanagement. In 1987, Wilkinson Sword was sold to Swedish Match for $230 million.

In 1987, Allegheny Ludlum became a public company via an initial public offering under chief executive Dick Simmons

In 1993, the company acquired Jessop Steel.

===ATI Technologies born 1996===
In 1996, it merged with Teledyne to form Allegheny Technologies. The company then spun off several subsidiaries as independent public companies such as Teledyne Technologies and Water Pik Technologies in 1999, to concentrate on its core business of metal and alloy production.

In 1998, the company acquired certain assets of Lukens Washington Steel when it was sold to Bethlehem Steel.

In 1998 ATI bought Teledyne Wah Chang Albany, as well as Oregon Metallurgical Corporation (Oremet). Both companies had plants in the Albany, Oregon area, such as the ATI Specialty Alloys and Components (Wah Chang) zirconium operation in Millersburg, Oregon. The Oremet facility makes high-quality titanium for use in Boeing aircraft.

In 2001 TWCA closed its titanium sponge manufacturing plant in Albany, Oregon; thereafter it would purchase the material on the open market as it continued to produce titanium ingot, slab, and mill products.

In 2004, the company acquired J&amp;L Specialty Steel.

In 2005, the company sold its World Minerals subsidiary to French company Imerys. At the time, it racked up $3.5 billion in sales.

In May 2008 the company invested $260 million in a new plant located in Monroe.

In 2010, the company acquired Ladish for $778 million.

Allegheny Technologies debuted its ATI 425 Titanium Alloy on June 14, 2010, at the land and air-land defense and security exhibition Eurosatory in Paris, France.

In 2012 ATI announced a $325 million investment in a new plant located in Rowley UT. The plant was located adjacent to a US Magnesium plant, for easy interchange of by-products. The Rowley plant uses the Kroll process.

As of August 2016, the firm employed roughly 1,500 people in its Albany region plants.

In August 2016 the firm announced it would idle its plants in Albany and Rowley. The latter plant was idled because other global suppliers, who had entered the market recently, could undercut the Rowley titanium sponge. The Albany plant, which produced mainly for Boeing, was shuttered because of poor demand.

In September 2016 the company said it would shut down its Frackville plant, which produced titanium bar and hair-thin wire in a 55,000-square-foot facility.

In 2019 the firm sold its ATI Cast Products plant in Albany OR to a Cleveland OH company. At the time, the firm employed some 900 people in three plants in the Albany area.

The firm announced in December 2020 the closure of its Albany plant. The plant had been subject to a United Steel Workers certification drive in March 2019.

In March 2021, about 1,300 workers at nine facilities in the northern United States, all members of the United Steelworkers, went on strike over proposed changes to their health care plans. The strike ended in July with the company rejecting its proposed changes.

In June 2022, the company was officially renamed from Allegheny Technologies Incorporated to ATI. Alongside this, the company&#x27;s domain was changed from ATImetals.com to ATImaterials.com.

In December 2022 the company closed its Albany plant.

As of September 2023 ATI was &quot;a $3.8 billion company&quot; with more than 6,000 workers in more than 30 locations in the United States and more than a dozen in Europe and Asia.
In June 2023 ATI announced a $28 million expansion of its Richland WA plant, located in the Horn Rapids Industrial Park. At the same time it announced it would re-start its Albany OR operations. The Richland plant has a furnace, which liquefies the metal with electron beams. The liquid metal flows into hearths where defects are removed. The finished products are billets that weigh up to 44,000 pounds. It also has a vacuum arc remelting process.

== Products ==
The company organizes its products into two segments:
* High Performance Materials &amp; Components, which includes titanium-based alloys, nickel-based alloys and superalloys, zirconium and hafnium.
* Advanced Alloys &amp; Solutions, which includes zirconium-, hafnium-, and niobium-based alloys, titanium and titanium alloys, nickel-based alloys, specialty alloys, duplex alloys in sheet, strip, and plate form, grain-oriented electrical steel.

==Environmental record==
Allegheny Ludlum&#x27;s Natrona, Pennsylvania and Brackenridge, Pennsylvania plants contributed to the waste at the ALSCO Park Lindane Dump, an EPA Superfund site. These plants also released chromium into the air, which adversely affected air quality at schools in the Highlands School District.

In 2005, Allegheny Ludlum agreed to pay a $2,375,000 penalty to settle a lawsuit brought by the U.S. Department of Justice on behalf of the United States Environmental Protection Agency in 1995, which alleged that the company had unlawfully discharged oil and other pollutants, such as chromium, zinc, copper, and nickel, into the Allegheny River and Kiskiminetas River in the suburbs of Pittsburgh.

==Carbon footprint==
ATI reported Total CO2e emissions (Direct + Indirect) for 31 December 2020 at 407 Kt (-146 /-26.4% y-o-y).

<doc id="1301613" wikidata="Q50840653" url="?curid=1301613" title="Pearl millet">
<text>Pearl millet (Cenchrus americanus, commonly known as the synonym &quot;Pennisetum glaucum&quot;) is the most widely grown type of millet. It has been grown in Africa and the Indian subcontinent since prehistoric times. The center of diversity, and suggested area of domestication, for the crop is in the Sahel zone of West Africa. Recent archaeobotanical research has confirmed the presence of domesticated pearl millet on the Sahel zone of northern Mali between 2500 and 2000 BC. 2023 was the , declared by the United Nations General Assembly in 2021.

==Description==

Pearl millet has ovoid grains of length, the largest kernels of all varieties of millet (not including sorghum). These can be nearly white, pale yellow, brown, grey, slate blue or purple. The 1000-seed weight can be anything from 2.5 to 14 g with a mean of 8 g.

The height of the plant ranges from .

==Cultivation==
Pearl millet is well adapted to growing areas characterized by drought, low soil fertility, low moisture, and high temperature. It performs well in soils with high salinity or low pH. Because of its tolerance to difficult growing conditions, it can be grown in areas where other cereal crops, such as maize or wheat, would not survive. Pearl millet is a summer annual crop well-suited for double cropping and rotations. The grain and forage are valuable as food and feed resources in Africa, Russia, India and China.

Today, pearl millet is grown on over of land worldwide. It accounts for about 50% of the total world production of millets. 

World production of millets has been stable during the 1980s. According to FAO, of millet were planted in 1987 with an average production of only .

== Structure and physical properties ==

Pearl millet varieties from the world collection probably have more variation in physical characteristics than any other millet. Kernel shape has different classifications: obovate, hexagonal, lanceolate, globular and elliptical. In Africa, pearl millet is classified as either globular or lanceolate and hexagonal. Most of the millets are very similar to each other in basic structures, although there are some very specific differences.

== Composition ==
The composition of variety &quot;Changara&quot; of pearl millet can be affected by both environment and genetics. Pearl millet usually has higher protein and fat contents than sorghum or other millets because the kernel is a naked caryopsis.

Values are expressed on a dry matter basis.

==Culinary use==

Pearl millet is commonly used to make &quot;bhakri&quot; flatbread. It is also boiled to make a Tamil porridge called &quot;kamban choru&quot; or &quot;kamban koozh&quot;.

In Rajasthani cuisine is a traditional dish made with pearl millet flour and yogurt.

Flatbreads made of pearl millet flour are served with various types of kadhi and bhaaji in meals.

In Namibia, pearl millet flour is used to make oshifima, a staple food in the northern part of Namibia.

==Around the world==
===India===
India is the largest producer of pearl millet. India began growing pearl millet between 1500 and 1100 BCE. It is currently unknown how it made its way to India, but it likely arrived originally from across Africa, and via the Red Sea during Indus Valley Trade networks. Rajasthan is the highest-producing state in India. The first hybrid of pearl millet developed in India in 1965 is called the HB1.

Sajje is the local name of the pearl millet in Karnataka and is mostly grown in the semiarid districts of North Karnataka. Sajje is milled and used for making flatbread called &#x27;sajje rotti&#x27; and is eaten with yennegai (stuffed brinjal) and yogurt.

&quot;Kambu&quot; is the Tamil name of pearl millet and is a common food across the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It is the second important food for Tamil people consumed predominantly in the hot humid summer months from February through May every year. It is made into a gruel and consumed along with buttermilk or consumed as dosa or idly.

Pearl millet is called &quot;bajra&quot; in Northern Indian states. There was a time when pearl millets along with finger millets and sorghum were the staple food crops in these states but it reduced to a mere cattle fodder crop after the Green Revolution in the 1960s.

===Africa===
The second largest producer of pearl millet and the first to start cultivation, Africa has been successful in bringing back this lost crop.

====Sahel====
Pearl millet is an important food across the Sahel region of Africa. It is a main staple (along with sorghum) in a large region of northern Nigeria, Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso. In Nigeria it is usually grown as an intercrop with sorghum and cowpea, the different growth habits, growth period and drought vulnerability of the three crops maximising total productivity and minimising the risk of total crop failure. It is often ground into a flour, rolled into large balls, parboiled, liquefied into a watery paste using fermented milk, and then consumed as a beverage. This beverage, called &quot;fura&quot; in Hausa, is a popular drink in northern Nigeria and southern Niger. Pearl millet is a food widely used in Borno state and its surrounding states, it is the most widely grown and harvested crop. There are many products that are obtained from the processing of the crop.

====Namibia====
In Namibia, pearl millet is locally known as &quot;mahangu&quot; and is grown mainly in the north of that country, where it is the staple food. In the dry, unpredictable climate of this area it grows better than alternatives such as maize. The regions in which this crop is produced are: Zambezi, Kavango East, Kavango West, Ohangwena, Omusati, Oshana, Oshikoto, and; in parts of the Otjozondjupa region, in the Tsumkwe area.

Mahangu is usually made into a porridge called &quot;oshifima&quot; (or &quot;oshithima&quot;), or fermented to make a drink called &quot;ontaku&quot; or &quot;oshikundu&quot;.

Traditionally, the mahangu is pounded with heavy pieces of wood in a &#x27;pounding area&#x27;. The floor of the pounding area is covered with a concrete-like coating made from the material of termite mounds. As a result, some sand and grit gets into the pounded mahangu, so products like oshifima are usually swallowed without chewing. After pounding, winnowing may be used to remove the chaff.

Some industrial grain processing facilities now exist, such as those operated by Namib Mills. Efforts are also being made to develop smaller scale processing using food extrusion and other methods. In a food extruder, the mahangu is milled into a paste before being forced through metal die. Products made this way include breakfast cereals, including puffed grains and porridge, pasta shapes, and &quot;rice&quot;. Pearl millet is also a vital feedstock for cattle, goats and chickens which can also be explored as an enterprise.

==Research and development==
Recently more productive varieties of pearl millet have been introduced, enabling farmers to increase production considerably.

To combat the problem of micronutrient malnutrition in Africa and Asia, a study of serving iron-biofortified pearl millets which is bred conventionally without genetic modification to a control group is proved to have higher level of iron absorbance by the group.

Around 1000 pearl millet genotypes (including 31 wild genotypes) have been sequenced, identifying the genetic diversity of this staple crop and aiding breeding to select for particular characteristics. A reference genotype of pearl millet () has been fully sequenced, which holds around 38,579 genes. Some of these genes are for wax biosynthesis, which is known to be involved in tolerance to abiotic stresses in pearl millet. The International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics is evaluating crop wild relatives and will introgress abiotic tolerant traits into cultivated genotypes and make them available for pearl millet improvement.

A 2015 study provided a genetic map.

==Pests==

Insect pests include &quot;Anoecia corni&quot;, &quot;An. cornicola&quot;, &quot;Anoecia fulviabdominalis&quot;, &quot;An. vagans&quot;, &quot;Aphis gossypii&quot;, &quot;Forda hirsuta&quot;, &quot;F. orientalis&quot;, &quot;Geoica utricularia&quot;, &quot;Hysteroneura setariae&quot;, &quot;Melanaphis sacchari&quot;, &quot;Protaphis middletonii&quot;, &quot;Rhopalosiphum maidis&quot;, &quot;R. rufiabdominale&quot;, &quot;Schizaphis graminum&quot;, &quot;Sipha elegans&quot;, &quot;Sipha maydis&quot;, &quot;Sitobion avenae&quot;, &quot;Sit. leelamaniae&quot;, &quot;Sit. pauliani&quot;, &quot;Tetraneura africana&quot;, &quot;Tetraneura basui&quot;, &quot;Tetraneura fusiformis&quot;, and &quot;T. yezoensis&quot;.

===Africa===
The larvae of several insect species, primarily belonging to the orders Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Diptera, and Hemiptera, as well as Orthoptera adults, are persistent pearl millet pests in the Sahel. The following pest species are reported for northern Mali.

*&quot;Coniesta ignefusalis&quot; (pearl millet stem-borer; Lepidoptera, Crambidae) attacks pearl millet, and also sorghum and maize, especially in the Sahel. It is the main pearl millet pest in Senegal.
*&quot;Heliocheilus albipunctella&quot; (pearl millet head-miner; Lepidoptera, Noctuidae) attacks pearl millet. The larvae bore in a spiral path, destroying florets or grain.
*&quot;Geromyia penniseti&quot; (millet grain midge): The larvae eat the developing grain and form white pupal cases attached to the tips of spikelets. Reported losses in Senegal are as high as 90 percent.
*&quot;Pachnoda interrupta&quot; (millet beetle)
*&quot;Psalydolytta fusca&quot; and &quot;Ps. vestita&quot; (pearl millet blister beetle; Coleoptera, Meloidae) attack pearl millet. They are major millet pests in Mali.
*&quot;Rhinyptia infuscata&quot; (Scarabaeidae, Rutelinae, Anomalini) is a nocturnal beetle, recorded as a locally important pest on millet flowers in Niger. Farmers in Niger often fight the species using fires set at night. It is also reported as sorghum pest in Senegal, and as a pest on maize, where the larvae attack the roots.
*&quot;Sesamia calamistis&quot; (pink stem borer), especially in lowland forests. This species and the sugarcane borer (&quot;Eldana saccharina&quot;) are the primary pests of the pearl millet in Ivory Coast.
*gall midges (Diptera, Cecidomyiidae): millet grain midge (&quot;Geromyia penniseti&quot;), sorghum midge (&quot;Contarinia sorghicola&quot;), and African rice gall midge (&quot;Orseolia oryzivora&quot;).
*&quot;Dysdercus volkeri&quot; (cotton-stainer; Hemiptera, Pyrrhocoridae) attacks flowers.

Grasshoppers that frequently attack millets in the Dogon country of Mali are &quot;Oedaleus senegalensis&quot;, &quot;Kraussaria angulifera&quot;, &quot;Cataloipus cymbiferus&quot;, and &quot;Diabolocatantops axillaris&quot;.

In northern Ghana, &quot;Poophilus costalis&quot; (spittle bug) is reported as a millet pest, as well as &quot;Dysdercus volkeri&quot;, &quot;Heliocheilus albipunctella&quot;, &quot;Coniesta ignefusalis&quot;, and caterpillars of &quot;Amsacta moloneyi&quot; and &quot;Helicoverpa armigera&quot;.

In northern Nigeria, heavy infestations of &quot;Hycleus&quot; species, including &quot;Hycleus terminatus&quot; (syn. &quot;Mylabris afzelli&quot;), &quot;Hycleus fimbriatus&quot; (syn. &quot;Mylabris fimbriatus&quot;), &quot;Hycleus hermanniae&quot; (syn. &quot;Coryna hermanniae&quot;), and &quot;Hycleus chevrolati&quot; (syn. &quot;Coryna chevrolati&quot;), have affected early plantings of pearl millet crops.

===Other regions===
In South India, pests include the shoot fly &quot;Atherigona approximata&quot;.

In North America, regular pests include the chinch bug &quot;Blissus leucopterus&quot;.

<text>Cardiogenic shock is a medical emergency resulting from inadequate blood flow to the body&#x27;s organs due to the dysfunction of the heart. Signs of inadequate blood flow include low urine production (&lt;30 mL/hour), cool arms and legs, and decreased level of consciousness. People may also have a severely low blood pressure and heart rate.

Causes of cardiogenic shock include cardiomyopathic, arrhythmic, and mechanical. Cardiogenic shock is most commonly precipitated by a heart attack.
Treatment of cardiogenic shock depends on the cause with the initial goals to improve blood flow to the body. If cardiogenic shock is due to a heart attack, attempts to open the heart&#x27;s arteries may help. Certain medications, such as dobutamine and milrinone, improve the heart&#x27;s ability to contract and can also be used. When these measures fail, more advanced options such as mechanical support devices or heart transplantation can be pursued.
Cardiogenic shock is a condition that is difficult to fully reverse even with an early diagnosis. However, early initiation of treatment may improve outcomes. Care should also be directed to any other organs that are affected by this lack of blood flow (e.g., dialysis for the kidneys, mechanical ventilation for lung dysfunction).

Mortality rates for cardiogenic shock are high but have been decreasing in the United States. This is likely due to its rapid identification and treatment in recent decades. Some studies have suggested that this is possibly related to new treatment advances. Nonetheless, the mortality rates remain high and multi-organ failure in addition to cardiogenic shock is associated with higher rates of mortality.

==Signs and symptoms==
The presentation is the following:
* Anxiety, restlessness, altered mental state due to decreased blood flow to the brain, and subsequent hypoxia.
* Low blood pressure due to decrease in cardiac output.
* A rapid, weak, thready pulse due to decreased circulation .
* Cool, clammy, and mottled skin (cutis marmorata) due to vasoconstriction and subsequent hypoperfusion of the skin.
* Distended jugular veins due to increased jugular venous pressure.
* Oliguria (low urine output) due to inadequate blood flow to the kidneys if the condition persists.
* Rapid and deeper respirations (hyperventilation) due to sympathetic nervous system stimulation and acidosis.
* Fatigue due to hyperventilation and hypoxia.
* Absent pulse in fast and abnormal heart rhythms.
* Pulmonary edema, involving fluid back-up in the lungs due to insufficient pumping of the heart.
* Loss of consciousness, coma, and persistent vegetative state due to loss of blood and oxygen to the brain.

== Causes ==
Cardiogenic shock is caused by the failure of the heart to pump effectively. It is due to damage to the heart muscle, most often from a heart attack or myocardial contusion. Other causes include abnormal heart rhythms, cardiomyopathy, heart valve problems, ventricular outflow obstruction (i.e. systolic anterior motion in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), or ventriculoseptal defects. It can also be caused by a sudden decompressurization (e.g. in an aircraft), where air bubbles are released into the bloodstream (Henry&#x27;s law), causing heart failure.

==Diagnosis==

=== Electrocardiogram ===
An electrocardiogram helps to establish the exact diagnosis and guides treatment, it may reveal:
* Abnormal heart rhythms, such as bradycardia (slowed heart rate)
* myocardial infarction (ST-elevation MI, STEMI, is usually more dangerous than non-STEMIs; MIs that affect the ventricles are usually more dangerous than those that affect the atria; those affecting the left side of the heart, especially the left ventricle, are usually more dangerous than those affecting the right side, unless that side is severely compromised)
* Signs of cardiomyopathy

===Echocardiography===
Echocardiography may show poor ventricular function, signs of PED, rupture of the interventricular septum, an obstructed outflow tract or cardiomyopathy.

===Swan-Ganz catheter===
The Swan–Ganz catheter or pulmonary artery catheter may assist in the diagnosis by providing information on the hemodynamics.

===Biopsy===
When cardiomyopathy is suspected as the cause of cardiogenic shock, a biopsy of heart muscle may be needed to make a definite diagnosis.

===Cardiac index===

If the cardiac index falls acutely below 2.2 L/min/m2, the person may be in cardiogenic shock.

==Treatment==
=== Medication Therapy ===

Initial management of cardiogenic shock involves medications to augment the heart&#x27;s function. Certain medications, such as dobutamine or milrinone, enhance the heart&#x27;s pumping function and are often used first-line to improve the low blood pressure and delivery of blood to the rest of the body.

Patients who have cardiogenic shock unresponsive to medication therapy may be candidates for more advanced options such as a mechanical circulatory support device. There are several types of mechanical circulatory support devices, the most common being intra-aortic balloon pumps, left ventricular assist devices, and venous-arterial extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation. It is important to note, however, that none of these devices are permanent solutions but rather are a bridge to a more definitive therapy such as a heart transplantion.

=== Intra-aortic balloon pump ===

An intra-aortic balloon pump is a device placed by a cardiac surgeon into the descending aorta. It consists of a small balloon filled with helium that helps the heart to pump blood by inflating during diastole (the resting phase of the cardiac cycle) and deflating during systole (the contracting phase of the cardiac cycle). Intra-aortic balloon pumps do not directly increase cardiac output, but importantly, they decrease the amount of pressure that the heart has to pump against, thereby allowing for more blood flow and oxygen to be delivered to the heart muscles.

Intra-aortic balloon pumps have been around for several decades and are most commonly used first-line of the mechanical circulatory support devices. However, it is not without its potential complications. Potential complications include injury upon insertion of the device to arteries supplying the spinal cord as well as risks with any procedure such as bleeding and infection. Contraindications to intra-aortic balloon pumps include aortic dissection, an abdominal aortic aneurysm, and irregularly fast heart beats.

=== Left ventricular assist device ===

There are several types of left ventricular assist devices, with the Impella devices being some of the most common. This device is placed by a cardiac surgeon into the left ventricle of the heart and essentially acts as a pump, drawing blood from the left ventricle and pushing it out into the aorta so that it could be delivered to the rest of the body. Unlike intra-aortic balloon pumps, the Impella acts independently from the cardiac cycle. It can be adjusted to pump at faster rates to take blood out of the left ventricle and into the aorta more quickly, thereby decreasing the amount of work that the left ventricle has to do. While the Impella is commonly used in settings of cardiogenic shock, some evidence suggests that it placing an Impella device in an acute cardiogenic shock setting, where the heart fails to pump suddenly, may not necessarily guarantee increased survival.

Potential complications specific to an Impella device include hemolysis (shearing of the blood cells) as well as the formation of lesions on the heart valve, namely the mitral or aortic valves. Contraindications to an Impella device insertion include aortic dissection, the presence of a mechanical aortic valve, and the presence of a blood clot in the left ventricle.

=== Venous-arterial extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation ===

Venous-arterial extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation is a circuit support system that is meant to replace the function of the heart as it heals or awaits a more definitive treatment. It consists of a circuit that essentially drains blood from a patient&#x27;s venous system, runs that blood through a circulator which adds oxygen and removes carbon dioxide, and ultimately returns blood back into the patient&#x27;s arterial system where the newly oxygenated blood can be delivered to the person&#x27;s organs. Some evidence suggests that the combination of both an Impella device and Venous-arterial extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation may decrease the heart&#x27;s pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, thereby decreasing the amount of stress on the cardiac muscles.

Because Venous-arterial extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation is a very invasive procedure, it is not usually the first-line chosen device for patients in cardiogenic shock and is often reserved only for patients who have not only cardiogenic shock but also respiratory failure and/or concomitant cardiac arrest.

Complications of venous-arterial extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation include an air embolism, pulmonary edema, and blood clotting in the circuit machine.

<doc id="1301630" wikidata="Q2200381" url="?curid=1301630" title="Neurogenic shock">
<text>Neurogenic shock is a distributive type of shock resulting in hypotension (low blood pressure), often with bradycardia (slowed heart rate), caused by disruption of autonomic nervous system pathways. It can occur after damage to the central nervous system, such as spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury. Low blood pressure occurs due to decreased systemic vascular resistance resulting from loss of sympathetic tone, which in turn causes blood pooling within the extremities rather than being available to circulate throughout the body. The slowed heart rate results from a vagal response unopposed by a sympathetic nervous system (SNS) response. Such cardiovascular instability is exacerbated by hypoxia, or treatment with endotracheal or endobronchial suction used to prevent pulmonary aspiration.

Neurogenic shock is a potentially devastating complication, leading to organ dysfunction and death if not promptly recognized and treated.

It is not to be confused with spinal shock, which is not circulatory in nature.

==Signs and symptoms==

* Instantaneous hypotension due to sudden, massive vasodilation and decrease in blood oxygen saturation
* Warm, flushed skin due to vasodilation and inability to constrict blood vessels.
* Priapism, also due to vasodilation
* The patient will be unable to mount a tachycardic response, and often becomes bradycardic
* If the injury is below cervical vertebrae C5, the patient will exhibit diaphragmatic breathing due to loss of nervous control of the intercostal muscles (which are required for thoracic breathing).
* If the injury is above C3, the patient will go into respiratory arrest immediately following the injury, due to loss of nervous control of the diaphragm.

== Causes ==
Neurogenic shock can result from severe central nervous system damage (brain injury, cervical or high thoracic spinal cord). In simple terms, the trauma causes a sudden loss of background SNS stimulation to the blood vessels. This causes them to relax (vasodilation) resulting in a sudden decrease in blood pressure (secondary to a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance).

Neurogenic shock results from damage to the spinal cord above the level of the 6th thoracic vertebra. It is found in about half of people who have a spinal cord injury within the first 24 hours, and usually persists for one to three weeks.

Neurogenic shock may be caused by severe brain injury. However, in case of increased intracranial pressure, according to the Cushing triad, blood pressure will be &quot;increased&quot; (unless decreased from hypovolemia), respirations will be irregular and bradycardia will also be a feature.

==Pathophysiology==

Neurogenic shock is diagnosed based on a person&#x27;s symptoms and blood pressure levels.

Neurogenic shock&#x27;s presentation includes:

- warm and pink skin

- labored breathing

- low blood pressure

- dizziness

- anxiety

- history of trauma to head or upper spine.

- if the injury is to the head or neck, hoarseness or difficulty swallowing may occur.

Symptoms of neurogenic shock are differentiated from other forms of shock by the lack of signs of the compensatory mechanisms triggered by the SNS, usual in other forms of shock. &#x27;This SNS response is effected via release of epinephrine and norepinephrine, and signs of these neurotransmitters&#x27; activity are typically absent where shock is of neurogenic origin. Those signs - in non-neurogenic shock - would include: tachycardia (increased heart rate), tachypnea (increased breath rate), sweating, and adaptive vasoconstriction, which serves in other forms of shock to shunt blood away from the extremities and to the vital organs.

In neurogenic shock, the body loses its ability to activate the SNS so that only parasympathetic tone remains. The resulting loss of sympathetic tone, which plays a major role in other forms of shock, is responsible for the unique and atypical features mentioned above. 

==Treatment==
*Dopamine (Intropin) is often used in combination with other vasopressors. Dopamine is not the best first-line vasopressor as it increases the chance of arrhythmias. 
*Vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone, ADH) is another vasopressor often used in combination with norepinephrine 
*Certain vasopressors (ephedrine, norepinephrine). Norepinephrine (Levophed) is the most common first-line vasopressor for people who don&#x27;t respond well to other hypotension treatments such as fluid resuscitation. 
*Atropine is administered for bradycardia. It acts on the vagus nerve so it&#x27;s not effective in heart transplant patients as the vagus nerve is severed during the transplant.

<doc id="1301635" wikidata="Q1065739" url="?curid=1301635" title="Order of the Precious Crown">
<text>The is a Japanese order, established on January 4, 1888 by Emperor Meiji of Japan. Since the Order of the Rising Sun at that time was an Order for men, it was established as an Order for women. Originally the order had five classes, but on April 13, 1896 the sixth, seventh and eighth classes were added. 

Until 2003, the Order of the Precious Crown, which had eight ranks, was equivalent to the Order of the Rising Sun and was awarded as a women-only version of the Order of the Rising Sun. In 2003 the Order of the Rising Sun, previously reserved for males, was made available to women as well, and the lowest two classes of the Order of the Precious Crown were abolished. Since 2003, the Order of the Precious Crown has only been given to female members of the imperial family in Japan and female members of the royal family in foreign countries only when it is specifically necessary for diplomatic ceremonies.

Since 2003, the number representing rank included in the official name of the order was removed. As a result, although numbers representing ranks were sometimes used in common names, the formal names such as &quot;勲一等&quot; (&quot;Kun-ittō&quot;, First Class) and 勲二等 (&quot;Kun-nitō&quot;, Second Class) were no longer used.

In 1907, medals of the Order of the Crown were bestowed upon twenty-nine Americans who participated in the Russo-Japanese War. This unusual list of honorees was composed of ten women volunteer nurses and nineteen correspondents of American newspapers.

==Classes==
The first class honour has been typically conferred to female royalty. As originally conceived, the order consisted of eight classes. Unlike its European counterparts, the order may be conferred posthumously.

The &quot;badge&quot; of the order is a gold oval medallion, with floral designs at its four ends; at the centre is an ancient Japanese crown on a blue background, surrounded by a red ring. It is suspended from a smaller badge, its design varies according to class, on a ribbon in yellow with red stripes near the borders, as a sash on the right shoulder for the 1st class, as a bow on the left shoulder for the other classes.

The &quot;star&quot; of the order, which is worn only by the first class, has five rays studded with pearls, with floral designs between the rays. The central disc features a &quot;Ho-o&quot; or phoenix on a blue background, surrounded by a red ring emblazoned with a laurel wreath.

The &quot;medal&quot; for the 6th and 7th classes are golden bronze. The face presents the crossed flags of Japan and the Emperor, both of which are surmounted by the Rising Sun. The obverse presents a conventional monumental shaft, which is flanked by a branch of laurel and a branch of palm.

<doc id="1301636" wikidata="Q642078" url="?curid=1301636" title="Slovene declension">
<text>This page describes the declension of nouns, adjectives and pronouns in Slovene. For information on Slovene grammar in general, see Slovene grammar.

This article follows the &quot;tonal&quot; orthography. For the conversion into &quot;pitch&quot; orthography, see &quot;Slovene national phonetic transcription&quot;.

== Grammatical categories ==
Nouns are declined for six cases and three numbers. Adjectives and most pronouns additionally decline for three genders.

=== Cases ===
There are six cases (the Slovene names are given in brackets):

# Nominative ( or )
# Genitive ( or )
# Dative ( or )
# Accusative ( or )
# Locative ( or )
# Instrumental ( or )

Traditionally, the cases are given in the order above. They are also usually numbered accordingly: the nominative case is the first case, the genitive the second, and so on.

The nouns are usually listed and sorted by their nominative singular form, but declension is defined by the genitive singular form. For this reason, genitive singular form is commonly written with the nominative. Where it is not otherwise noted, the second form is in genitive singular form.

==== Vocative ====
Vocative ( or ) was used with the original endings in Slovene up to the 18th century by, for example Janez Svetokriški, but has now received the endings of the nominative case. Some words, however, kept the vocative form, such as (instead of the nominative *otь̀cь) &#x27;father&#x27;. Colloquially, vocative endings are still present, but the current use is taken from Croatian.

While having the same endings, it is still tonemically different from the nominative case, always having circumflex accent, but because of its similarity with nominative, it is often omitted from declension tables or is considered a special case of nominative, called &#x27;addressive nominative&#x27; () in Slovene literature.

=== Numbers ===
Slovene has three numbers:

# Singular (), which refers to one object.
# Dual (), which refers to a pair of objects.
# Plural (), which refers to more than two objects.

There is, however, an exception to that rule. Plural is used instead of dual for nouns that represent things that usually come in pairs (such as body parts, socks, twins, and parents), except if one wants to stress that the noun relates to both parts and after words that signify a pair (such as &#x27;both&#x27;, etc. ):
* . (I asked parents if I can go out.) – plural is used.
* . (Both parents have to sign the application.) – dual is used.

=== Genders ===
A noun in Slovene can have one of the following three genders:

# Masculine (, abbreviated ); divided further into animate (accusative singular equals genitive) and inanimate (accusative singular equals nominative) in the first and fourth masculine declension, and in first adjective declension.
# Feminine (, abbreviated )
# Neuter (, abbreviated ); which is in some dialects masculinized or feminized.

Native speakers usually identify a gender by placing a demonstrative pronoun &#x27;that&#x27; in front of it. Since some nouns can only have a singular form and some only a plural form (extremely rarely also only dual, such as &#x27;pisces&#x27;), both singular and plural endings must be remembered. Note that the feminine singular and neuter plural endings are the same so the number must be determined first.

Non-native speakers in most cases determine try to determine gender from the ending of a noun in nominative singular.

* Masculine nouns typically end in a consonant, although a few end in a vowel, mostly in , and (some names, letters, nominalized adjectives etc.).
* Feminine nouns usually end in ; these are the &quot;a-stem&quot; nouns. A number of feminine nouns end in a consonant; these are mostly &quot;i-stem&quot; and &quot;v-stem&quot; nouns.
* The vast majority of neuter nouns end in or , but second and third neuter declension end with a variety of sounds since they have a null ending in nominative case.

=== Declensions ===
Declensions are divided differently in international and Slovene literature. In Slovene literature, the declensions are defined by the ending in genitive singular, but in international literature, the nouns are often divided by the stem (the same way as in Proto-Slavic), which are more numerous. Thus, they can be considered as a subdivision of the declension. The stem declensions that are a subdivision of the main declension are a result of a stem lengthening alteration (), or is a subpattern ().

There are four different noun declension for every gender in Slovene and two for the adjectives. Besides the name, the identifying ending (ending in genitive singular) is written:

Masculine:

* First masculine declension; ending , , or (word )
** Masculine o-/e-stem declension
** Masculine t-stem declension
** Masculine n-stem declension
** Masculine j-stem declension
* Second masculine declension (masculine a-stem declension); ending (except )
* Third masculine declension (masculine declension without endings); ending 
* Fourth masculine declension (masculine i-/e-stem declension); ending 

Feminine:

* First feminine declension; ending , genitive plural ending is not 
** Feminine a-stem declension
** Feminine r-stem declension
** Feminine v-stem declension
** Feminine n-stem declension
* Second feminine declension (feminine i-stem declension); ending 
* Third feminine declension (feminine declensions without endings); ending 
* Fourth feminine declension (feminine i-/e-stem declension); ending , genitive plural ending 

Neuter:

* First neuter declension; ending 
** Neuter o-/e-stem declension
** Neuter n-stem declension
** Neuter s-stem declension
** Neuter t-stem declension
* Second neuter declension (neuter a-stem declension); ending 
* Third neuter declension (neuter declension without endings); ending -ø
* Fourth neuter declension (neuter i-/e-stem declension); ending -ega
Adjective:

* First adjective declension (adjective declension with endings); ending 
* Second adjective declension (adjective declension without endings); ending 

=== Accentual types ===
There are four different accentual types:

* Fixed (), where the stress is always on the same stem syllable.
* Mobile (), where the stress is on different stem syllables.
* Ending (), where the stress is always on the ending.
* Mixed (), where the stress is sometimes on the stem and sometimes on the ending.
In first masculine, second feminine and first adjectival declension, accentual types affect the endings in some cases.

Some words can also change accent from fixed to mixed in one number or in only one case. These nouns follow accent changes of the fixed type, except where they change to mixed type (they follow mixed accentuation). Some nouns can also change the accentuation after certain prepositions. These forms are always circumflex (for example, , accusative singular , but after , it changes into ).

=== Degrees of comparison ===
There is a three-stage and two-stage comparison in Slovene.

The three-stage comparison has the following degrees:

# Positive ( or )
# Comparative ( or )
# Superlative ( or )

The two-stage declension has the following degrees:

# Positive ( or )
# Elative ( or )

=== Animacy ===
Masculine nouns and adjectives are divided between animate and inanimate nouns.

Animate nouns are nouns that represent a living or mythological being ( &#x27;French&#x27;, &#x27;crab&#x27;, &#x27;ghost&#x27;) and words that originally had that meaning, but have a different one now ( (a type of wine), &#x27;monkey wrench&#x27;, &#x27;Orion&#x27;). In this category are also card names and suits, and some names of cars and mushrooms, such as &#x27;ace&#x27;, &#x27;club&#x27;, (Golf, a Volkswagen car), and &#x27;bolete&#x27;. The word is animate when it means &#x27;ghost&#x27; or &#x27;mentality&#x27;. Some diminutives are animate, even if they represent an inanimate object (for example, &#x27;little chair&#x27; ). Names of space objects that are named after gods are either animate or inanimate (e. g. &#x27;Mercury&#x27;)

This distinction is also applied to all words that modify the noun, such as adjectives, determiners and the like. Thus, adjectives in the masculine accusative singular will have either the form of the nominative (no ending or ), or the form of the genitive ().

== Nouns, nominal pronouns, nominalized adjectives ==
The declensions for nouns, nominal pronouns, and nominalized adjectives can be split by gender, as gender and declension pattern coincide. The dual and plural are not distinguished in the genitive and locative cases of nouns; the plural form is used for the dual as well. For neuter nouns, the nominative and accusative forms are always the same, in all numbers.

Nominal and nominalized pronouns also follow this inflection patterns, however most of them are irregular. For irregularities among pronouns, see the pronouns section.

=== First Masculine declension ===
First masculine declension follow nouns whose genitive singular ending is -a ( ), -u (mọ̑st mostȗ), and the noun &quot;dan&quot; (dȃn dnẹ̑). The vast majority of masculine nouns are declined following this inflection pattern. It is so common that masculine nouns following the second (and some following the third and the fourth) can be declined following the pattern of the first.

Masculine nouns are further divided between &quot;animate&quot; and &quot;inanimate&quot; nouns. This difference is only significant for the accusative singular.

* For inanimate nouns, the accusative singular is identical to the nominative singular. For example, &#x27;chair&#x27;, genitive singular , accusative singular .
* For animate nouns, the accusative singular is identical to the genitive singular. For example, &#x27;boy&#x27;, genitive singular , accusative singular .

==== Masculine o-/e-stem declension ====

The standard declension of first masculine declension is the o-stem declension. O-stem nouns are divided between &quot;hard&quot; and &quot;soft&quot; stems, see the main Slovene grammar article for the meaning of these terms.
==== Masculine t-stem declension ====
Proper names ending in normally follow this declension like the noun &#x27;kid&#x27;, adding the infix before the endings. For example, (a male name). This declension also follow some other nouns ending in if it represents hypocoristicity ( &#x27;boy, immature man&#x27;). The noun &#x27;father&#x27; also follows this declension.

Some historic Greek names, such as &#x27;Xenophon&#x27; and &#x27;Ajax the Great&#x27;, also follow this inflection pattern, however, it is also common to already have a t-stem in nominative singular (/ , / ).

In speech or in writing of lower register, nouns that have the ending in nominative singular, such as (a male name) and &#x27;little son&#x27; also follow this inflection pattern ( , ). In dialectal speeches this also happens to proper nouns ending in , such as and , and the is in some dialects changed to ( /, /), although in some dialects these words can be lengthened with another consonant, for example, with in Carinthian dialects ( , ).

==== Masculine n-stem declension ====
A few nouns ending in have a stem ending in rather than dropping the fill vowel. For example, &#x27;carnation&#x27; and (a male name). These nouns can be also declined normally ( , ), however, that is less common.

Some Latin names ending in can also follow this inflection pattern, such as &#x27;Cato&#x27;, but the can be already added in nominative singular ( ).

==== Masculine j-stem declension ====
Nouns with a stem whose pronunciation ends in or a vowel (not to be confused with a noun having a vowel ending in nominative singular) have an added when an ending is attached, such as &#x27;taxi&#x27; and &#x27;security guard at a public event&#x27;.

There are exceptions, though. Monosyllabic words follow the o-stem declension ( &#x27;peace&#x27;), except &#x27;tsar&#x27;, and similarly also (old way of measuring cereal), &#x27;bolete, 1000 units of currency&#x27;, and &#x27;priest&#x27;. Nouns derived from verbs, such as &#x27;speech&#x27;, &#x27;source&#x27;, and &#x27;penetration&#x27; also follow o-stem declension. The same is true for nouns that have a fill vowel followed by , such as &#x27;wind&#x27; and &#x27;well-being&#x27;. Compound nouns that contain a non-j-stem noun (such as &#x27;dialogue&#x27; and &#x27;subcommittee&#x27;) are also excluded, except for names that end in , such as (a male name) and , which can be declined either way ( /, /). Some nouns that end in and silent can also be declined either way ( &#x27;Tesnière&#x27; / , / ) &#x27;Shakespeare. Some nouns, such as &#x27;Hungar&#x27;, &#x27;north&#x27;, and &#x27;Algiers&#x27;, also follow the o-stem declension. Note that in loanwords, the vowel can be written differently than expected, such as &#x27;Disney&#x27; (but &#x27;Broadway&#x27;). Note that Latin and Greek words can have an ending that ends with a consonant in nominative singular, but they are still j-stem nouns ( &#x27;Ovid&#x27;).

Nouns ending in non-silent or a vowel plus a silent consonant also follow this declension, but the is only pronounced and not written: ( ) &#x27;Dumas&#x27;.

==== Alternations and other exceptions of the first masculine declension ====
First masculine declension has many alternations:

* A relatively small number of masculine nouns have a nominative (and accusative, if inanimate) singular an ending ( (mostly the nouns that can also follow second masculine declination) &#x27;servant&#x27;), ( &#x27;final&#x27;), ( (a male name), or ( &#x27;Enescu&#x27;). Sometimes, but not always, the suffixes in Latin loanwords , , , , , and are considered an ending. Examples of this include &#x27;Leonidas&#x27;, &#x27;Augeas&#x27;, &#x27;Aristotle&#x27;, &#x27;Juvenal&#x27;, &#x27;Archilochus&#x27;, &#x27;Tacitus, and &#x27;Taranto&#x27;. These suffixes can be omitted (, , etc.), but if we do so, the stems that end with a vowel must be lengthened with a j, even in nominative case ( &#x27;Augeas&#x27;, &#x27;Menelaus&#x27;, &#x27;Livius&#x27;, etc.). The lengthening of the stem is also present in other cases if one does not decide to omit the suffix. Other times, the suffix is considered as a part of the stem, such as &#x27;Rhodes&#x27;, and some can be declined both ways, such as / &#x27;Obol&#x27; and / &#x27;Alpine botanical garden&#x27;. Modern Greek names are considered not to have an ending in nominative ( &#x27;Macarios&#x27;).
* The surname Nepos can have alternatively a stem Nepot- in other cases ( ).
* some monosyllabic nouns have an ending in genitive singular ( &#x27;bridge&#x27;, &#x27;lineage&#x27;).
* Many nouns have the stem shortened in cases where the ending is not a null ending (as it is nominative singular), mainly because they have a fill vowel, which is there to ease the pronunciation. The change can be evident in writing, pronunciation, or both:
** In writing, at the end of the stem is omitted in some loanwords &#x27;Wilde&#x27; and &#x27;Laforgue&#x27;, but not in cases where that would affect the pronunciation of preceding letters, such as in / &#x27;Wallace&#x27; and &#x27;George&#x27;, except if it is preventing the nasalisation of the consonant + / that precede it, such as &#x27;Lamartine&#x27;. If is followed by other letters, it is kept in all cases, whether it is pronounced or not ( &#x27;Holmes&#x27; and &#x27;Jacques&#x27;).
** In pronunciation, when the sound is not written with an or , such as in and .
** In both vhen the sound is written by its own letter, usually with an , but also with or , such as &#x27;business&#x27; and &#x27;fair&#x27;. In loanwords from other Slavic languages, fill vowels are preserved if the removal would break other grammatical rules. Examples include &#x27;Muromets&#x27;, &#x27;Dudok&#x27;, &#x27;Čapek&#x27;, &#x27;Kragujevac&#x27;, and &#x27;Zadar&#x27;, but not &#x27;Leo&#x27;, because would violate other grammatical rules, so it is declined as . The omission of the sound is also present in some non-Slavic loanwords, such as / &#x27;Munich&#x27;, &#x27;raster&#x27;, but sometimes the sound is preserved in all cases, where it is transformen into or , such as &#x27;Andersen&#x27; and &#x27;Ólafsson&#x27;.
* In the 19th century the ending was often used in the dative/locative singular instead of . For example, nominative &#x27;father&#x27;, dative/locative . Nowadays this ending is considered archaic or dialectal.
* Nouns ending in (such as / &#x27;radio&#x27;) usually follow the soft inflection pattern instrumental singular .
* Names ending in a vowel and consonant that is not pronounced are j-stem nouns, and can be written following hard or soft declension, but always pronounced as in soft declension. The added -j- is not written, only pronounced ( instrumental singular / &#x27;Marat&#x27;). Same happens to those ending in and a silent consonant ( instrumental singular / &#x27;Macquart&#x27;).
* Some nouns have the stem lengthened with in dual and plural, except in genitive case (for example nominative dual &#x27;castle&#x27;, nominative dual grobȏva &quot;grave&quot;). These are usually monosyllabic nouns.
* Some nouns have the ending in the nominative plural instead of . This is a remnant of the Common Slavic masculine i-stem inflection, which was mostly lost in Slovene except for this ending. For example: &#x27;student&#x27;, nominative plural , &#x27;sir, lord&#x27;, nominative plural , &#x27;farmer&#x27;, nominative plural , etc. Usually, the regular form is also allowed, but rarely preferred.
* Some nouns (mostly those that have an ending in genitive singular) have a null ending in genitive dual/plural (, genitive plural &#x27;hair&#x27;, genitive plural &#x27;tooth&#x27;). Some can be declined either way (, genitive plural /).
* About special stressed endings in plural, see mixed accent nouns.
* Few nouns show the effects of the Slavic second palatalisation in some of the plural forms:
** : nominative plural , locative dual/plural &#x27;child&#x27;.
** : nominative plural &#x27;wolf&#x27;. But this form is rare, the usual nominative plural is .
* Many forms of the noun &#x27;day&#x27; have two stems, a shorter one with only the consonants , and a longer one . The longer stem declines as a regular o-stem, while the shorter one has a unique set of endings not shared with any other noun. The formal, most appropriate declension, is a mix of both (the forms in brackets are colloquial):
* The masculine noun &#x27;human, person&#x27; is suppletive. In the plural, the stem is used, which follows the mobile-accent o-stem declension:

==== Fixed accent nouns ====
Circumflex nouns have circumflex accent in all cases, however, the acute accent changes considerably.

* Nouns that have circumflex accent in nominative and genitive singular have long circumflex accent in all cases, except the nouns where the stressed vowel changes (e. g. , ); these follow mixed accent changes. Nouns that can also have mixed accent also follow the same rules, except if they have a null ending in genitive dual/plural; then they have all plural forms except vocative acute, but change to circumflex if used as an adverb and preceded by a preposition: &#x27;hair&#x27;, nominative plural , genitive plural , locative plural .
* Nouns that have long acute accent in nominative and genitive singular have circumflex accent in vocative and allow both in genitive, locative and instrumental plural, and locative dual. In collocations which are used as an adverb, and where the word lost the original meaning, the noun is only allowed to have circumflex accent in accusative and locative plural (e. g. / &#x27;on a mountain (lit. in mountains)&#x27;):

* Nouns that have short acute accent in nominative and genitive singular follow the same rules as long acute accented words, but all accents are short:

* Nouns that have circumflex accent in nominative singular and acute in genitive singular allow both forms in locative and dative singular when preceded by a preposition. The only exception are words in which open-mid vowel changes into a close-mid vowel. In these cases, it further depends which ending does it have in genitive plural. In collocations which are used as an adverb, and where the word lost the original meaning, the noun is only allowed to have circumflex accent in accusative and locative plural. (Note that due to simplicity, only the forms that are affected by this rule are shown; for example, can also be declined without the change into close-mid vowel.)

==== Mobile accent nouns ====
Mobile accent nouns transfer the stress to the following syllable in all cases but nominative, vocative, and accusative (if the same as nominative) singular.

* Nouns that have circumflex accent in genitive singular, although rare, have circumflex accent in all forms:

* Nouns that have acute accent in genitive singular change the accent the same way as fixed accent nouns with circumflex in nominative singular and acute in genitive singular when the stress is on the latter syllable and have acute accent when the stress in on the original syllable:

==== Ending accent nouns ====
Short ending vowels are always circumflex while long ending ones follow the same pattern as mixed accent nouns that have circumflex accent in nominative singular and when the accent is on the stem, the accent is long and acute. There is a slight difference between soft and hard stems in genitive dual/plural, because soft declension only allows short circumflex accent whereas hard declension allows long acute and short circumflex.
==== Mixed accent nouns ====
For the mixed accent nouns with long accent, many different factors determine the accent. The accent is usually circumflex, except in these cases:

* Genitive dual/plural, locative dual/plural and instrumental is acute if the accent is on the last syllable: &#x27;human&#x27;, genitive plural , &#x27;gift&#x27;, genitive plural , &#x27;hair&#x27;, genitive plural (but &#x27;castle&#x27;, locative plural ). This happens in genitive case in all words, no matter the ending, and in words that do not have lengthening in locative and instrumental. Those without the infix do not have an ending in genitive plural, dative plural ending is instead of / , accusative plural is still , locative dual/plural ending instead of , instrumental plural instead of , and dative and instrumental dual ending is instead of / . This rule does not necessarily apply to irregular nouns.
* Stressed vowel in nominative plural ending is close-mid (): &#x27;hair&#x27;, nominative plural , &#x27;man&#x27;, nominative plural .
* Dative and locative singular is acute if the stressed vowel is open-mid (e or o): &#x27;manure&#x27; .
* When used as an adverb, uncountable nouns or nouns that have ending in locative dual/plural (those that do not lengthen the stem) allow both accents in locative singular. Words that can also have a form with open-mid vowel in locative singular.
* Nouns that allow both the stem or the ending to be accented usually have the stem accented when preceded by a preposition and have the ending accented when they are not.
* Dative and instrumental dual can have the accent either on the ending or the stem. If the accent is on the stem, it is long.
* Nouns that switch accent only in plural on in only one case follow fixed accent changes when the accent does not shift.
* Nouns can also colloquially have fixed accent. See fixed accent for that.

Here are declensions for some mixed accent nouns, but keep in mind that they have several different changes and only relevant forms are written:
Mixed accent nouns with short accent follow the same pattern as ending accent nouns (including the difference bətween soft and hard stems), except in nominative and vocative (and accusative if the same as nominative) singular, and dative and instrumental dual, where the accent is on the stem and acute if long:
=== Second masculine declension (masculine a-stem declension) ===
Second masculine declension follow nouns whose genitive singular ending is ( ), except the noun ( ).

Second masculine declension has the same endings as first feminine declension, however, not all alterations apply here. Animate and inanimate nouns are not declined differently, but the words that modify the noun still have those distinctions.

All nouns following the second masculine declension can also follow first masculine declension, but keeping the ending in nominative singular. They can also be feminized in dual and plural, following first feminine declension (essentially, the endings do not change).
==== Alternations and other exceptions of the second masculine declension ====

* In nominative singular, some words, such as &#x27;kamikaze&#x27;, have an ending.
* In genitive dual and genitive plural, nouns ending in consonant + , have an inserted between, such as genitive plural .

==== Accent ====
Second masculine declension follow only fixed accent nouns. These can be circumflex or acute.

* Circumflex nouns are always circumflex:

* Acute accent changes into circumflex in genitive dual/plural and vocative case and is either acute or circumflex in instrumental singular:

=== Third masculine declension (masculine declension without endings) ===
Third masculine declension follow nouns whose genitive singular (or in any other case) ending is a null ending (). This includes all letters, as well as some other words, such as &#x27;menace&#x27;, / &#x27;oh&#x27;, and &#x27;Cha-cha-cha&#x27;. There are, however, only a handful of words that feel natural to be declined this way; for many of them, it is preferred to be declined following the first masculine declension. Alternations of the first declension must then be applied, and since all consonant letters are usually pronounced as consonant + , all letters, except for and must follow the j-stem version of the first declension ( ). Exceptions are , , , , , , and , which can also be pronounced , , , , , , and , respectively and can therefore follow the o-stem version ( /), and the pronunciacion changes accordingly. Although there is a hyphen between the letter and , keep in mind that ist still part of the stem, not the ending.
==== Alternations and other exceptions of the third masculine declension ====

* Most of the time, nouns &#x27;menace&#x27; and &#x27;menaces&#x27; are considered one irregular noun instead of two nouns that only have a singular and a plural form, respectively. In that case, the infix is changed to in dual and plural. The infix is actually a personal pronoun &#x27;he&#x27; in genitive case, but the dual form is still , and not with an infix as would be expected:

==== Accent ====
Words declined this way always have fixed accent, which is the same throughout, no matter if it is circumflex or acute, long or short. The only exception is vocative, where the accent is circumflex.

=== Fourth masculine declension (masculine i-/e-stem declension) ===
Fourth masculine declension follow nouns whose genitive singular ending is . The nouns following this declension were derived from an adjective, and are therefore nominalized adjectives. They are derived from the definite forms of the adjective, hence the ending in nominative singular. This declension also differentiates between animate and inanimate nouns in the same way as the first one. The declension is the same as declension for masculine adjectives.

Some masculine nominalized adjectives, mostly proper nouns, are declined using first male declension. In addition, most of them have a null ending in nominative singular, only rarely do they have an ending . Examples include &#x27;Meden&#x27;, &#x27;Raztresen&#x27;, &#x27;April, May&#x27; etc.

Names in other languages ending in (or similarly look like definite adjectives) that are from non-Slavic languages are declined using the first declension ( &#x27;Tedeschi, &#x27;McClosky&#x27;, / &#x27;Kreisky&#x27;) and those from Slavic languages are declined using the fourth declension ( &#x27;Vranitzky&#x27;, &#x27;Hradetzky&#x27; etc.

==== Alternations and other exceptions of the fourth masculine declension ====

* The sound in nominative singular and plural is in some loanwords written with , but not in other cases (, nominative plural , instrumental singular ).
* Vast majority nouns are declined as animate (, accusative singular &#x27;a Sunday issue of the newspaper Dnevnik&#x27;).
* Other irregularities that adjectives and adjectival pronouns possess also apply here.
* For the different endings in nominative singular, see first adjective declension.

==== Accent ====
These nouns decline the same way as definite masculine forms of adjectives following the first adjectival declension do. Therefore, only fixed and ending accentual types exist. For accent changes when nominalizing, see &quot;§ Accent of nominalized adjectives&quot;.

=== First feminine declension ===
First feminine declension follow nouns whose genitive singular ending is ( ), except if genitive plural has an ending ( genitive plural ), those follow the fourth feminine declension. Those ending in and nouns &#x27;mother&#x27; and &#x27;daughter&#x27; also follow this declension. In plural, genitive case has a null ending ( &#x27;pitchfork&#x27;).

The first feminine declension is the most common pattern for feminine nouns. There is no distinction between hard and soft stems (the declension used in modern Slovene was historically the soft one and the merge happened in Alpine Slavic).

==== Feminine a-stem declension ====

The standard declension of first feminine declension is the a-stem declension.
==== Feminine r-stem declension ====
This declension subtype follow only the nouns &#x27;mother&#x27; and &#x27;daughter&#x27;. They have a different stem in nominative singular than in other cases and numbers. ( , ). There are also minor changes to the endings in singular.
==== Feminine v-stem declension ====

A small number of feminine nouns belongs to the feminine v-stem declension, with the ending (in which the is a fill vowel). These inflect as r-stems, but with the i-stem instrumental singular ending and have a null ending in nominative singular. Many nouns in this group can colloquially also inflect as regular a-stems, with the nominative singular ending in and accusative and instrumental singular in .
==== Feminine n-stem declension ====
Only few nouns have their stems lengthend with , except in nominative singular. The most common example is ( ), which can also be declined following the third feminine declension ( &#x27;Juno&#x27;) or as an a-stem noun ( ). The endings are the same as for a-stem nouns. N-stem declension did not exist in Proto-Slavic (at least not for feminine nouns) and it evolved later.

==== Alternations and other exceptions of the first feminine declension ====

* Some nouns have ending ( &#x27;Melpomene&#x27;), silent ( &#x27;Marguerite&#x27;), ( &#x27;Clio&#x27;), or a null ending ( &#x27;Artemis&#x27;), but most of them also have regularvernacular versions (, , ). The non-vernacular versions can also be declined following the third feminine declension.
* Latin and Greek names can change the stem from to ( ) &#x27;Artemis&#x27;, ( &#x27;Salamis&#x27;), or ( &#x27;Ceres&#x27;). These also have vernacular versions for nominative singular (, , ).
* Mixed accent nouns have in nominative dual (along with the usual ending ) ending that is accented ( /, nominative dual /).
* Some mixed accent nouns can in gentitive dual/plural also have ending ( genitive dual/plural / &#x27;stream, lake&#x27;, genitive dual/plural / &#x27;church&#x27;) or ( genitive dual/plural &#x27;word&#x27;)
* Nouns ending in a sonorant have an added fill vowel in genitive dual/plural. The fill vowel is usually , except before , where the fill vowel is . In some words, the fill vowel is not written, only pronounced (note that and represent only one sound when not followed by a vowel): genitive dual/plural &#x27;maidservant&#x27;, genitive dual/plural &#x27;ship&#x27;, genitive dual/plural &#x27;soil&#x27;.
* Nouns of which the stem ends in a vowel also have an added in genitive dual/plural if without an ending: genitive dual/plural etc.
* The noun &#x27;lady, madam&#x27; is irregular and has acute accent on all the endings except in vocative.

==== Fixed accent nouns ====

* Circumflex nouns are always circumflex:

* Acute nouns have circumflex accent in vocative, genitive dual/plural and instrumental singular. When used as an adverb, accusative and instrumental singular can only be circumflex, and nouns that can also have mixed accent also have accusative plural circumflex:

* Acute nouns allow both tones in instrumental singular if the stressed vowel is open-mid:
* r-stem and v-stem nouns change the accent a bit differently; circumflex nouns are still circumflex in all cases, but acute ones change to circumflex in vocative, instrumental singular and genitive dual/plural. If the nouns also allow mixed accent, then the mixed accent declension follows the same rules:

==== Mobile accent nouns ====
Mobile accent nouns are very rare and are always circumflex:

==== Ending accent nouns ====

These nouns are short and circumflex, except if the accent is long; then they follow the same pattern as mixed accent nouns, but genitive dual/plural is circumflex if there is a null ending. The pattern is the same for words of which stems do not have a vowel and words which have the optional stress before the → shift.

==== Mixed accent nouns ====

These nouns can only be acute in nominative singular, but the stressed endings are acute, except genitive case, where both forms are allowed and in instrumental singular, where it is acute. In genitive dual/plural, they usually have an ending or , but if they do not, the vowel is acute, or acute or circumflex if it is a fill vowel . All words can also have fixed accent, but nouns that in genitive dual/plural have a null ending have the same form as in the mixed accent.

=== Second feminine declension (feminine i-stem declension) ===

The second feminine declension is less common. It is used primarily by the widely-productive abstract-noun suffix , but a fair number of other nouns (mostly of Common Slavic origin) also follow it. The endings, however, are different if the noun follows the mixed or ending-accentual type or if the accent is always on the stem.
==== Alternations and other exceptions of the second feminine declension ====

* Nouns with stems that end in a non-sonorant consonant and a sonorant have a fill vowel inserted between them in nominative and accusative singular and add at the end of their stem in cases when the ending does not begin with a vowel (instrumental in all numbers and dative dual), such as , instrumental singular , dative/instrumental dual , instrumental plural &#x27;thought&#x27; and dative plural &#x27;hayloft&#x27;.
* Nouns with stems ending in have an ending in instrumental singular ( instrumental singular &#x27;bed&#x27; (archaic)).
* When used as an adverb, some also change the accent, e.g., &#x27;in the spring&#x27;, / &#x27;[to move something] out of the way&#x27;.
* The feminine noun &#x27;blood&#x27; follows the mixed-accent type, but replaces the final with in the nominative and accusative singular.

==== Fixed accent nouns ====

* Nouns that are circumflex in nominative and genitive singular have circumflex accent in all cases, and the short accent becomes long:

* Nouns that are acute in nominative and genitive singular follow two patterns, depending on whether the stress falls (in that case) on the second-to-last syllable or comes before, which in regular nouns translates into whether the stress is on the penultimate or the last syllable in nominative singular:

* Nouns that are circumflex in nominative singular and acute in genitive singular change the accent in a very similar way to acute nouns. Vocative and Instrumental singular are circumflex, genitive dual/plural allows both accents, and locative dual/plural, instrumental dual and plural, and dative dual also allow both accents if the penultimate syllable is stressed.
==== Mobile accent nouns ====

These nouns can be either circumflex or acute in nominative singular, but all of them are circumflex in all other forms:

==== Ending accent nouns ====
There are two subtypes. The first one is not purely ending accent as it has accent on the stem in dative and locative singular and appears if a long fill vowel is stressed in nominative singular. In that case, the e and o accented on the stem are open-mid. The other form is present if the short fill vowel is stressed in nominative singular.

==== Mixed accent nouns ====
These nouns can only be circumflex and follow the same pattern as ending-accent nouns with long as a fill vowel. If the accent is on or in dative singular, the vowels are open-mid.

=== Third feminine declension (feminine declension without endings) ===
Third feminine declension follow nouns whose genitive singular (or in any other case) ending is a null ending (). This declension follow surnames of women (but those ending in can also follow first feminine declension), female names, which do not have an ending or in nominative singular (except most of the Latin and Greek names), such as , , and , acronyms that keep the feminine gender of the word(s) they represent and do not end in an unstressed ( &#x27;Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts&#x27; and ) &#x27;USA&#x27;, diminutives of female names and common nouns ending in ( (a female name), (a female name), &#x27;mommy&#x27;, &#x27;granny&#x27;), and some other words, such as .
==== Alternations and other exceptions of the third feminine declension ====
* Some names can also follow first feminine declension ( / &#x27;Ruth&#x27;)
* Sometimes, nouns &#x27;menace&#x27;, &#x27;two menaces&#x27;, and &#x27;menaces&#x27; are considered one irregular noun instead of three nouns that only have a singular, dual, and a plural form, respectively. In that case, the infix is changed to in dual and to in plural. The infix is actually a personal pronoun &#x27;she&#x27; in genitive case:

==== Accent ====
Words declined this way always have fixed accent, which is the same throughout, no matter if it is circumflex or acute, long or short. The only exception is vocative, where the accent is circumflex.

=== Fourth feminine declension (feminine i-/e-stem declension) ===
Fourth feminine declension follow nouns whose genitive singular ending is and genitive dual/plural is . The nouns following this declension were derived from an adjective, and are therefore nominalized adjectives. The declension is the same as declension for definite feminine adjectives.

This declension does not seem to have any alterations.

==== Accent ====
These nouns decline the same way as definite masculine forms of adjectives following the first adjectival declension. Therefore, only fixed- and ending-accentual types exist. For accent changes when nominalizing, see &quot;§ Accent of nominalized adjectives&quot;.

=== First neuter declension ===
The vast majority of neuter nouns follow the first neuter declension. This declension follow nouns whose genitive singular ending is . These can have in nominative singular ending (following hard o-stem declension), (following soft o-stem declension), or a null ending (following one of the other declension subtypes), but in these cases, the stem ends in or .

==== Neuter o-/e-stem declension ====
The neuter o-stem declension closely resembles its masculine counterpart. The nominative and accusative always have the same form, however, with endings that differ from the masculine nouns. The genitive dual/plural has no ending like in the feminine a-stems. The neuter o-stems are divided between &quot;hard&quot; and &quot;soft&quot; stems, like the masculines.
==== Neuter n-, s- and t-stem declensions ====

A small group of neuter nouns follow the neuter n-stem, neuter s-stem or neuter t-stem declensions. These use the same endings as the o-stems (except in nominative and accusative singular), but there is an additional consonant infix (, , ) that is present in all forms except the nominative/accusative singular. The n-stem and t-stem are soft in nominative/accusative singular, while in most s-stem nouns, the stem before the infix changes into . Since these nouns in nominative/accusative singular already end in /, there is a null ending.
==== Alternations and other exceptions of the first neuter declension ====
* In mixed accentual types, unstressed and can either become or , or , or both ( dative singular / &#x27;silver&#x27;, dative singular / &#x27;meat&#x27;).
* In the 19th century the ending was often used in the dative/locative singular instead of . For example, nominative &#x27;sea&#x27;, dative/locative . Nowadays this ending is considered archaic or dialectal.
* Some nouns with a stressed or can also have dual and plural forms with or , such as &#x27;window&#x27;, nominative plural // and &#x27;rib&#x27;, nominative plural ///.
* Nouns ending in a non-sonorant consonant and a sonorant or a sonorant followed by , , or , have a fill vowel or , if the stem ends in , when there is a null ending ( genitive plural &#x27;window&#x27;, genitive plural &#x27;building&#x27;)
* A few neuter s-stem nouns show the effects of the Slavic first palatalisation in the forms with the infix :
** The noun &#x27;eye&#x27; has the stem . It also has a shorter plural stem when referring to human eyes. This stem is feminine rather than neuter, and follows the mixed i-stem declension.
** The noun &#x27;ear&#x27; has the stem , with a change in accent type. The genitive plural allows both accents.
** The noun &#x27;yoke&#x27; has the stem .
* Nouns without a vowel in the stem add a fill vowel in genitive dual/plural. Noun &#x27;bottom&#x27; has an ending or, as , has a fill vowel ( /, /), but the version is preferred. Noun is also irregular in locative where it is either or ( is preferred) and noun is also irregular in locative and instrumental (nominative plural locative plural instrumental plural /).
* Noun &#x27;firewood&#x27; is also irregular, having two forms for locative and instrumental: nominative plural locative plural /, instrumental plural /. The irregular forms are preferred.
* Some nouns, such as &#x27;intestine&#x27; (stem ) lose the infix in the plural: .

==== Fixed accent nouns ====
Note that all these nouns have the same accent on dative and locative forms with ending in .

* Circumflex nouns are always circumflex, except in plural, where the ones that lose the infix are acute in nominative/accusative plural and follow acute accentuation in other cases:

* Nouns that are circumflex in nominative singular and acute in genitive plural allow both accents in locative and dative singular after preposition and in dual. They are circumflex in plural and acute in other forms in singular. The exception is the word , which is acute in other forms, except in vocative, where it is circumflex and genitive dual/plural, where it can also be circumflex:

* Most acute nouns have circumflex accent in plural and allow both accents in dual, except in vocative, where it is always circumflex:

Acute nouns that are stressed on an open-mid vowel in nominative singular, diminutives ending in in nominative singular, plurale tantum, and noun are, if composed of two syllables, acute in nominative/genitive plural or allow both if the stressed vowel is open-mid. If the noun is composed of more than three syllables, then they allow both accents no matter the stressed vowel. Those that are acute or open-mid vowel in nominative/accusative plural (except close-mid vowel in nouns that can also be declined with an open-mid vowel) are circumflex or acute in genitive and locative dual/plural, and instrumental plural, except if the stressed vowel is open-mid (in that case the accent is circumflex in genitive dual/plural) or if the stem ends in or followed or preceded by at least one other consonant; these are circumflex in genitive and locative dual/plural, and instrumental plural. Dative plural is in all nouns accented the same as nominative plural. The accent in dual is either that of the singular or that of the plural form:

* Plurale tantum can additionally follow one of these two accent changes:

* Nouns and change the accent irregularly. is circumflex in plural with close-mid vowel (alongside the regular open-mid vowel), even though it would be expected to be acute, and can only be acute in nominative and accusative plural:

==== Mobile accent nouns ====

These nouns are always acute in nominative singular, but can either be circumflex or acute in genitive singular. The circumflex stay circumflex in all other cases while acute ones further decline as fixed accent nouns which have short circumflex accent in nominative singular and are acute in genitive singular:

==== Ending accent nouns ====
These nouns always have short accent, except in dative and instrumental singular, where the accent is the same (but acute if long) as their fixed accent counterparts (if the stem has a fill vowel, then the noun can also be declined as a fixed accent noun), or is long circumflex (acute according to Slovenski pravopis) open-mid or long circumflex (acute according to Slovenski pravopis) closed-mid if the stem does not have a vowel. Long vowel is also the fill vowel in genitive dual/plural and if nouns have special ending in plural and some dual cases. These are dative plural ending is instead of / , locative dual/plural ending instead of , instrumental plural / instead of , and dative and instrumental dual ending is instead of / . Nouns, where the accent is not on the last syllable in genitive dual/plural, allow both accents in that case.
==== Mixed accent nouns ====
Mixed accent nouns are always circumflex, except open-mid and allow both accents. Slovenski pravopis dictates that also closed-mid and allow both accents, but the Dictionary of Slovene written language does not. The same rules also apply to dative and genitive forms ending in , not written below due to simplicity.
=== Second neuter declension (neuter a-stem declension) ===
Second neuter declension follow nouns whose genitive singular ending is . In modern Slovene, only pronouns &#x27;I&#x27;, &#x27;you&#x27;, and , which is a reflexive personal pronoun are considered to follow this declension. Therefore, for the accent, endings, and alternations, see those three pronouns in the pronouns section.

=== Third neuter declension (neuter declension without endings) ===
Third neuter declension follow nouns whose genitive singular (or in any other case) ending is a null ending (). This declension follow all nominalized cardinal numerals (when expressed with a number or a word) and verbs that are used as a noun ( &#x27;eat well&#x27;, but only a handful of other words, such as in the phrase &#x27;home sweet home&#x27;. This declension does not seem to have any alterations.
==== Accent ====
These accents can only have fixed accent, which does not change, except the acute accent changes into circumflex in vocative.
=== Fourth neuter declension (neuter i-/e-stem declension) ===
Fourth neuter declension follow nouns whose genitive singular ending is . The nouns following this declension were derived from an adjective, and are therefore nominalized adjectives. The declension is the same as declension for neuter adjectives. Most of these nouns are geographical names and only have a singular form. This declension also differentiates between hard and soft stems, but only in nominative and accusative singular.
This declension does not seem to have any alterations.

==== Accent ====
These nouns decline the same way as definite feminine forms of adjectives following the first adjectival declension do. Therefore, only fixed and ending accentual types exist. For accent changes when nominalizing, see &quot;§ Accent of nomnalized adjectives&quot;.

=== Nouns that switch gender ===

* Some masculine nouns of Latin origin can be apart from being declined regularly in plural declined following the first neuter declension, such as &#x27;fricative&#x27;, nominative plural , genitive plural . The normal declension is usually preferred.
* Some neuter geographical names einding in or (, ) follow neuter declension in some cases and feminine in other. Neuter declension is mostly present only in locative after preposition . These nouns however, are commonly split into two versions, one following the feminine declension and one following neuter declension:

* Some mixed-accented neuter nouns can become masculine (along with the usual declension) in dual and plural, having an infix and following first masculine declension.
* Nouns following second masculine declension can be feminine or masculine in dual and plural, but in either case they decline the same, as described above.
* Noun when meaning &#x27;eye&#x27; has plural , which further declines as a regular feminine i-stem noun with mixed accent.
* Noun has a stylistically marked plural and dual forms following neuter o-stem declension: and .
* Noun is in vast majority of examples neuter, but can also dialectally or archaically be feminine, but still following the same declension.

=== Nouns composed of two or more words ===
When a noun composed of two or more words, sometimes all words are declined as they would be if alone, but there are additional rules.

==== Proper &amp; common nouns ====
If all parts of a proper nouns grammatically match then all of them are declined, such as &#x27;Ivan Cankar&#x27; and &#x27;Mokro Polje&#x27;. The exception are surnames of females, which in most cases follow third declensions and have the same ending in all cases ( &#x27;Majda Vrhovnik&#x27;), but surnames following female declensions (usually ending in ) can be also declined following the original declension ( / &#x27;Ana Kopriva&#x27;). If both females and males with the same surname are mentioned, the surname is declined following original declension if the last name listed is male and follow the exception if the last name listed is female, but both first names are declined as they would normally: → (last listed first name is female) and → (last listed first name is male). In combination of two names, such as &#x27;Šmarje–Sap&#x27; and &#x27;Gozd Martuljek&#x27;, both nouns are declined (, ).

If a part of the composed noun does not grammatically match, it usually follows third declensions, such as (hotel named &quot;Turist&quot;) , except in some rare cases, such as (publishing house named &quot;Lipa&quot;) . If the first part of a compound loanword is considered an adjective or is considered not to be able to stan by itself, then this part also follows third declensions, such as &#x27;Down Street&#x27;, &#x27;Kon Tiki&#x27;, &#x27;Monte Carlo&#x27;, &#x27;U Thant&#x27;, &#x27;Mao Zedong&#x27;, but some can be declined following the usual declension or the third, such as / &#x27;Rio de Janeiro&#x27;. Some of these names can also be shortened to only the first word, which in that case follows the usual declension &#x27;Rio de Janeiro&#x27; and &#x27;Mao&#x27;. Compound loanword nouns with unusual endings for their gender or number follow third declensions: &#x27;Pickwhick Papers&#x27;, &#x27;École des Hautes Études&#x27;. Part of nouns, called in Slovene (lit. forenames), part between the name and surname, which was originally usually an article, also follow third declensions: , . Some other common words that fall into this category are also , , , , , , , , and .

When a common noun has a proper noun as a modifier, the proper noun in some cases follows the usual declension and sometimes the third: (the city of Ljubljana), (the Soča river), as opposed to (the town of Mostec), (a restaurant named &quot;Gorjanc&quot;). Some can be declined both ways, such as / (Iskra company).

==== Vernacular &amp; Vernacularized nouns ====
In those cases, all words are declined as usual, such as &#x27;coal&#x27; and , nominative plural &#x27;frogman&#x27;, except when they are part of the same word written apart where the first part follows third declensions, such as &#x27;holiday cottage&#x27; and &#x27;deposit account&#x27; . In these cases, writing words together is favored (, )

==== Non-vernacularized nouns ====
Nouns that are not fully integrated in Slovene (are not fully vernacularized) are split into two categories: quoted () and semi-quoted (), depending on how much they are integrated.

All parts of masculine semi-quoted nouns are usually declined following the usual inflection pattern, which is either first, second, or fourth masculine declension, but some that have an unusual ending follow the third masculine declension:  , but  . Feminine semi-quoted nouns ending in in nominative singular are declined following the first feminine declension and others follow the third:  and  .

Quoted nouns are declined as originally in the language they were borrowed from:  ,  ,  , nominative plural . This declension is always stylistically marked.

=== Masculinization and feminization of neuter nouns ===
Neuter nouns are either masculinized or feminized across a large part of the Slovene-speaking territory. Masculinization occurs in Upper Carniolan, Lower Sava Valley, Central Savinja, Horjul, Škofja Loka, Poljane, Selca, Črni Vrh, Ebriach, North Pohorje-Remšnik, and Mežica dialects, Kranjska Gora subdialect, and in parts of Rosen Valley, Juan Valley, Lower Carniolan, Central Styrian, and South Pohorje dialects. It is most commonly present in singular, and less in dual and plural. Masculinization varies from nouns binding with masculine forms of adjectives to completely change the declension, such as in Lower Sava Valley dialect. In that case nouns following the first neuter declension change to following first masculine, those following second neuter to following second masculine declension those following the third neuter to third masculine and those following fourth neuter to fourth masculine. Masculinized nouns following first declension have in genitive dual/plural a null ending, which is also present in some other masculine nouns. Mixed and mobile accentual type generally turns into fixed. Those following fourth declension have a null ending in nominative singular. The t-, s-, and n-stem nouns usually have the long stem in all cases.

Feminization of neuter nouns occurs in eastern Carinthian, northern Styrian, and many Panonian dialects. Feminization is the most common in plural, but is also very common in singular in dual. Similarly to masculinization, nouns following the first neuter declension change to following the first feminine, those following the second neuter to second feminine, those following the third neuter to third feminine and those following fourth neuter to fourth feminine. Mobile and mixed accentual type generally turn into fixed. The t-, s-, and n-stem nouns usually have the short stems in all cases, which is furthermore shortened, without the last o/e. The accent also changes accordingly to one syllable before, if the final o/e was accented.

== Adjectives, adjectival pronouns, numerals ==
Adjective declension is simpler than noun declension, as there are only two different inflection patterns. The first declension is the same as fourth noun declension for each case, while the second adjective declension is the same as third noun declensions (have a null ending in all cases). Adjectives can have all four accentual types. Adjectives can be compared in two ways, having three degrees of comparison in the first comparison (positive, comparative, superlative) and the second having two (positive and elative) and can be declined either by affixes or by adding other an adverb before it.

Declension of adjectival pronouns and irregular numerals is detailed in the pronouns and irregular numerals section.

=== Definite and indefinite adjectives ===
Adjectives in Slovene distinguish between &quot;indefinite&quot; and &quot;definite&quot; meanings. They correspond in meaning to the distinction between the English indefinite article &quot;a&quot;, referring to an unknown thing, and the definite article &quot;the&quot;, referring to a known thing. The definite form is also used in fixed noun phrases, where the combination of adjective and noun are to be understood as a single concept. Apart from that, they are also used under the following conditions:
* After possessive adjectives: &#x27;individual&#x27;s financial contribution&#x27;.
* After demonstrative pronouns, and the pronouns (except when meaning &#x27;completely&#x27;) (after , all forms become circumflex, except open-mid and allow both accents, and and are irregular and are acute): / &#x27;his / this financial contribution&#x27;.
* When the adjective denotes a special type of the noun: &#x27;retake exam&#x27;, &#x27;mother tongue&#x27;.
* When nominalized: . &#x27;The doctor on-call (lit. on duty) is here.&#x27;; some proper nouns are exceptions.

The corresponding interrogative word for indefinite adjectives is and for definite adjectives for definite adjectives. Thus, definite forms behave like relational adjectives, which already mostly have an ending.

Definite adjectives have an ending in nominative and vocative singular. All other forms are usually the same for regular adjectives, acting as both indefinite and definite adjective, but adjectives that do not have fixed accent and some irregular adjectives change the stem or the accent, so all forms are differentiated.

For some adjectives, however, there are more differences between the indefinite and definite declensions:

* If the indefinite declension has acute accent, but circumflex accent in the feminine singular, the definite declension has acute accent throughout: , , , , feminine nominative singular , , , .
* If the indefinite declension is mixed, mobile or end-accented, the definite declension has fixed accent: , , . The only exception is when the stem does not have a vowel. Then it has ending accent.
* Some acute-stem adjectives (e.g. ) switch to circumflex accentuation in the definite declension: .
* The adjective (with stem ) can additionally have circumflex accent on the stem and a close-mid vowel in the definite declension: .
* The adjective changes the stem to .

In addition, not all adjectives have definite and indefinite form. Adjectives ending in / (, ) or (), adjectival pronouns, and adjectives and numerals ending in (, , , ) are (except some pronouns) definite by meaning, but only those ending in decline as definite adjectives, others decline as indefinite forms.

=== First adjective declension (adjective declension with endings) ===
Most of the adjectives follow the first declension, which changes the endings when declined. These adjectives, when nominalized, follow fourth declensions. The endings can be split into three groups of cases:
* The nominative and accusative, which are like the o-stems of masculine and neuter nouns, and the a-stems of feminine nouns. Like in nouns, a distinction is made between hard and soft stems, but this is only relevant for the neuter nominative/accusative singular, which has for hard stems and for soft stems.
* The other feminine singular cases, which also follow the a-stems of nouns.
* The remaining cases, which have endings unique to adjectives. These are the same for all three genders in the dual and plural.

The accusative singular is different if the adjective stays directly before the noun or not. In the latter case, masculine form allows only genitive ending, feminine only accusative and neuter allows both endings.

The masculine accusative singular before the adjective is like either the nominative or the genitive, as in masculine nouns. Which form is used depends on which form the accompanying noun uses, which in turn depends on whether the noun is animate or inanimate.
==== Alternations and other exceptions of the first adjective declension ====

* Adjectives with mixed accent also have a form with an ending -e in nominative and accusative dual in feminine and neuter gender in addition to the usual -i: &#x27;white&#x27;, nominative dual: //.
* A fill vowel in nominate singular when there is a null ending in some adjectives.

==== Fixed accent adjectives ====
Adjectives do not nearly change the accent as much when declined as nouns, however there are six different ways that can happen:

* If the adjective is long circumflex (or short if is accented) in nominative singular masculine and feminine form, then it is circumflex in all other forms.

* If the adjective is long acute (or short if is accented) in nominative singular masculine and feminine form, then it is acute in all other forms, except in vocative, where it is circumflex.

* If the adjective is long circumflex (or short if is accented) in nominative singular masculine form, but acute in feminine form, then it is acute in all other forms, except in vocative case, where it is circumflex.

* If the adjective is long acute (or short if is accented) in nominative singular masculine form, but circumflex in feminine form, then it is acute in all masculine and neuter forms, but allows both accents in other feminine singular forms. The same applies if nominative singular feminine form allows both accents.

* If the adjective is short circumflex and is not stressed in nominative singular masculine form, and long circumflex in feminine form, then it is acute in all other masculine and neuter forms, but allows both accents in other feminine singular forms. The same applies if nominative singular feminine form allows both accents. The exception is , which is only circumflex in all forms.


* If the adjective is short circumflex and is not stressed in nominative singular masculine form, but long acute in feminine form, then it is acute in all other forms.

==== Mobile accent adjectives ====
Adjectives with mobile accent are acute in nominative singular masculine form and can be either circumflex or acute in feminine form. Circumflex ones change the accent in other forms the same way as fixed-accented adjectives that are acute in masculine and circumflex in feminine, and acute ones are always acute. The only exception is definite form of , and acts as a fixed accent adjective. 


==== Ending accent adjectives ====
Ending accents are usually stylistically marked and are circumflex when the ending is stressed, but the stem is acute (except fill vowels). The definite form is accented on the stem and , are close-mid, except if it does not have a vowel. Definite forms have fixed accent. If the stem does not have a vowel, then the first syllable is accentuated and acute if long. Some speakers can also accentuate indefinite forms the same as definite.

==== Mixed accent adjectives ====
There are two different ways mixed accent adjectives are declined, with short or long stress on endings, most of them following the first way.

The first way can have, along with the fixed accentuation, the ending accented only in nominative and vocative singular neuter form, accusative singular feminine and neuter form, and nominative and vocative dual and plural in all forms. However, some of these accents are stylistically marked:

* If both fixed and ending accents are used about the same in nominative/vocative singular neuter form, then fixed accent is favored in other forms.
* If fixed accent is favored, but ending is not stylistically marked in nominative/vocative singular neuter form, then ending accent is stylistically marked in other forms.
* If ending accent is stylistically marked in nominative/vocative singular neuter form, then it can only have accent on the stem in other forms, forms with accent on the ending are obsolete.

Moreover, in nominative and accusative dual in feminine and neuter form these adjectives can also have a stylistically marked ending in addition to the usual -i. They follow one of the fixed accent tone changes if the accent is on the stem. If the feminine nominative singular form is acute, then other accents are acute. If it is circumflex, then it is circumflex in all forms. The endings are always circumflex. Defnite forms have fixed accent that is the same as &quot;other&quot; forms. The exceptions are when meaning &#x27;offspring&#x27; or &#x27;young people/animals&#x27;, , , and when it is nominalized or in collocations. These forms are always circumflex.
The second way with short accents is that the accent is on the stem only in nominative singular, and on the ending in all other forms. All adjectives following this pattern can also have fixed accent, and can only have fixed accent in definite forms. The ending is always short circumflex and definite form is acute. 
==== Mobile &amp; mixed accent adjectives ====
These adjectives decline as mobile accent adjectives, but also have the ending-accentuated forms of the adjectivves following the first way of mixed accentual type.
=== Second adjective declension (adjective declension without endings) ===
Some adjectives, especially the ones derived recently from loanwords ( &#x27;beige&#x27;, &#x27;instant&#x27;, &#x27;pink&#x27; – derived from Italian or German ) decline without changing the endings. When nominalized, they usually decline following third declensions. These adjectives also don&#x27;t differentiate between definite and indefinite forms and the ending does not change when not followed by noun.
==== Accent ====
The accent is always fixed and does not change, except in vocative, where acute changes into circumflex.
=== Words that can follow both declensions ===
Cardinal numerals from five onward can be declined both ways. Smaller numbers (up to 100) are usually declined using first declension ( / &#x27;five&#x27;), and bigger (1000 and onwards) using second declension ( / &#x27;million&#x27;). Declining big numbers using first declension is really uncommon. Noun &#x27;zero&#x27; can also be declined both ways. If the numeral is composed of more words, only the last one follows first declension (, &#x27;one hundred five&#x27;). When all numerals are written with a number, they always follow second declension.

Indefinite numerals ending in and collective numerals ending in or can also decline both ways: , /; , /.

=== Formation of adverbs ===
Adverbs formed from adjectives have an ending in for hard stems and for soft stems. If not otherwise noted, adverbs keep the same tone as the adjective in nominative singular neuter form (the second form in the given examples below). Adverbs formed from fixed and mobile accent adjectives keep accent on the stem, those derived from ending accent nouns or from those following the second form of mixed accents (with short accents on ending) have the accent on the ending, which is long circumflex for hard stems and short circumflex for soft stems. Adverbs formed from mobile and mixed or only mixed nouns following the first pattern (with long accents on endings) can have the accent either on the stem or the ending. If the ending accent was stylistically marked in neuter nominative singular form, it is not marked, just less common.

Adjectives ending in , , or also have a stylistically marked form ending in .
* → → 
* → → 
* → / (stylistically marked) → / 
* → → / (stylistically marked)

=== Comparison ===
For all adjectives, comparative, superlative and elative are formed periphrastically, using the adverbs &#x27;more&#x27;, / &#x27;most&#x27;, and &#x27;too (much)&#x27; or many other adverbs similar in meaning, respectively. For some adjectives, especially more basic or old ones, the comparative and superlative can also be formed with affixes. These can still be compared periphrastically, but the form with affixes is usually favored.

There are three affixes used to form the comparative: , and . Which one is used depends in a large part on the shape of the adjective&#x27;s stem, although these are not hard rules and there are some exceptions. The superlative is formed from the comparative by prefixing / to it. Elative is formed from positive prefixng to it. Elative can be formed periphrastically by all adjectives. If adjective can be compared periphrastically, this form is favored.

Adjectives ending in (), (), // (), (), participles and colors are usually compared periphrastically, but there are exceptions as some can also be compared with affixes, which are not favored. ( → /).

Compared adjectives declines as either always acute or always circumflex fixed accent adjectives. Some adjectives lack positive and elative form; these are then sorted in dictionaries by the comparative.

The suffix is used with one-syllable adjectives ending in &quot;b&quot;, &quot;d&quot; or &quot;p&quot;, preceded by a vowel or . After a vowel, &quot;d&quot; becomes &quot;j&quot;, and after &quot;r&quot; it disappears altogether. The suffix is also used with adjectives ending in &quot;-ok&quot; or &quot;-ek&quot;, which is dropped in the comparative, and along with the previous changes, &quot;t&quot; also changes to &quot;j&quot; and other consonants are iotated.

* (stem ) → 
* (stem ) → 
* (stem ) → 
* (stem ) → 
* (stem ) → 
* → 

The suffix is used with one-syllable adjectives ending in &quot;g&quot;, &quot;h&quot; or &quot;k&quot;. In the comparative, these change to their palatalised variants &quot;ž&quot;, &quot;š&quot; and &quot;č&quot; respectively. The suffix is also used with adjectives ending in or preceded by one of these consonants. Again, the suffix is dropped and the final consonant is iotated. The stem is always circumflex, the only exception is the last example.

* (stem ) → 
* (stem ) → 
* (stem or ) → 
* (stem or ) → 
* → 
* → (stylistically marked)

The suffix is used in all other cases, including one-syllable adjectives ending in more than one consonant or adjectives with more than one syllable. Some adjectives keep the accent on the stem, and is then the same as the stem accent in nominative singular neuter form, or the suffix may be circumflex accented with an open-mid vowel. The latter case is more typical for ending and mixed accent adjectives while the first form is more typical for fixed and mobile accent adjectives.

* (stem ) → 
* (stem or ) → / 
* (stem ) → 
* (stem ) → 
* → 

==== Comparison of adverbs ====
Adverbs compare the same way as adjectives do, but the &quot;š&quot; in the ending can be omitted, except in (not preceded by &quot;j&quot;), and final &quot;i&quot; in the ending turns into &quot;e&quot;. Those declined with suffix , which have &quot;č&quot;, &quot;š&quot;, or &quot;ž&quot; before the ending can also have ending . Only the ending allows accent on the ending, in other forms only fixed accent remains. The accent also changes the same way as with adjectives, the three exceptions are the last two examples, where comparative allows both accents.
* / → / 
* → / 
* → / 
* / → / / (stylistically marked)
* / → / (stylistically marked)

=== Accent of nominalized adjectives ===
Nominalized adjectives and adverbs that form a collocation with a preposition (such as ) &#x27;since chiildhood&#x27;(lit. since young) are always circumflex if disyllabic and have accent on the first syllable in definite masculine nominative singular form. When nominalized nouns are a proper noun, then they are also circumflex. Otherwise, they keep accent the same.

== Pronouns ==
Pronouns declined and therefore detailed here can be either nominal or adjectival and follow one of the respective declensions, although many of them are heavily irregular; these are detailed here.

=== Nominal Pronouns ===
Nominal pronouns, apart from personal pronouns are of two types; first are used to refer to people and are masculine gender, and other are used for everything else and are neuter gender. Exception are nominal pronouns which are the same gender as the noun they represent.

==== Personal pronouns ====
Personal pronouns have in some cases up to four forms. The accusative, genitive and dative forms have stressed and unstressed forms; the stressed forms are used when particular emphasis is needed. The accusative also has a form used when preceded by a monosyllabic preposition, &#x27;through&#x27; (which is changed to skọ̑z-), or &#x27;in&#x27; (which is changed into vȃ-) that is combined with the preposition, such as &#x27;on&#x27; + &#x27;me&#x27;, which are combined into &#x27;on me&#x27; and &#x27;in, into&#x27; + &#x27;you&#x27;, which are combined into &#x27;into you&#x27;. Stressed combining form also exist, however they are considered archaic and do not actually combine with the preposition (for example, &#x27;on me&#x27;). Instead of combining forms, usual stressed forms can also be used.

Different forms are in the table below written as unstressed / streesed / combining / stressed combining. Note that not all pronouns have all expected forms in each case and number.

The first and second person singular pronouns are very irregular, and follow their own declension (second neuter declension). The nominative forms of the dual and plural have different forms for the genders, depending on who is speaking or who is being spoken to. In the case of the dual, the nominative developed from literally &quot;we two&quot; and &quot;you two&quot;, although the other cases were inherited from Common Slavic. The combining forms exist only in singular.

The reflexive pronouns are used to refer back to the subject or to some other word, and have only a single set of forms for all three numbers, which inflect like the first- and second-person singular pronouns. There is no nominative form.

The third-person pronouns inflect similar to the fourth declensions, but irregularly. Like in the first- and second-person pronouns, the accusative is the same as the genitive, and the ending in the dual forms is replaced with . The nominative is formed from a different stem than the other cases. The combining forms in masculine and neuter singular have two different versions, the latter being used when combining with a preposition that does not end with a vowel, which are skozi &quot;through&quot; (skozenj), pred &quot;in from of, before&quot; (predenj), and čez &quot;over, in a certain amount of time&quot; (čezenj).
===== Use of pronouns as a subject, stressed &amp; undstressed forms =====
The subject in Slovene is often omitted when it consists only of personal pronouns, so use of them as a subject is not so common. As a subject, personal pronouns are used only in the following cases, which are the same as when a stressed form is used instead of the unstressed one:

* To emphasize the subject: ! &#x27;You won&#x27;t teach me!&#x27;
* If the subject has a grammatical modifier: . &#x27;I &quot;also&quot; don&#x27;t know what to do.&quot;; … &#x27;I, &quot;the King of XY&quot;, am commanding …&#x27;
* When implying a difference: . &#x27;He was there, not you.&#x27;
* In some coordinate relations: . &#x27;Janez &quot;and&quot; I are going to see the castle.&#x27;, but . &#x27;He was there.&#x27; and . &#x27;I don&#x27;t know what to do&#x27; allow the omission.
* After prepositions (except when combining form is used), stressed versions are used: &#x27;(run, walk, come etc.) to you&#x27;, &#x27;behind me&#x27;, &#x27;against her&#x27;, &#x27;without you (plural)&#x27;.

==== Interrogative nominal pronouns ====
The interrogative pronouns &#x27;who&#x27; and &#x27;what&#x27; have only singular forms, and have irregular stem changes. also replaces the normal &quot;-g-&quot; in the genitive with &quot;-s-&quot;.
==== Relative nominal pronouns ====
The relative pronouns / &#x27;who, that&#x27; and &#x27;which, that&#x27; inflect like and , but add &quot;-r&quot; to the end of each form, adding a fill vowel if necessary. The ending -j is also dropped.
==== Relative indefinite pronouns ====
Relative indefinite pronouns / &#x27;whoever&#x27; and &#x27;whatever&#x27; are declined as and , but with a suffix at the end, which can also be a separate word (, ).
==== Indefinite nominal pronouns ====
The pronouns / &#x27;somebody&#x27; and &#x27;something&#x27; follow the declensions of and . Pronoun can also have a prefix , which is declined the same: / &#x27;quite a few people&#x27; .
==== Negative nominal pronouns ====
The pronouns / &#x27;nobody&#x27; and &#x27;nothing&#x27; follow the declensions of and , but the nominative and accusative are different. The pronoun is an archaic version of . The other forms are the same as .
==== Universal nominal pronouns ====
Integral pronoun &#x27;everyone&#x27; follows the declension of , but &#x27;everything&#x27; is irregular.
==== Manifold nominal pronouns ====
Manifold pronouns are formed by adding a prefix to the interrogative pronouns and are thus declined the same way. The prefix can be &#x27;quite a few&#x27;, &#x27;many&#x27; &#x27;few&#x27; or &#x27;scarcely&#x27;; the last one can combine only with . Prefixes and can also be written as a separate word (, ).

==== Unspecified nominal pronouns ====
These are &#x27;someone arbitrary&#x27; and &#x27;something arbitrary&#x27;, which are written and declined the same as interrogative pronouns, but interrogative has a different accent. An example sentence is . &#x27;Grab something to eat.&#x27;. The difference between these pronouns and indefinite pronouns is that one is not obliged to do anything. In the example sentence, the subject is not obliged to grab anything, but in the sentence , which would be translated the same, the subject is obliged to grab something.
=== Adjectival pronouns ===
Most of the adjectival pronouns are regular and follow first adjective declension. Pronouns that follow second declension are , , , , , and . Pronoun has, the same as , a different definite nominal singular form when nominalized – .

==== Relative unspecified adjectival pronouns and demonstrative pronouns ending in -le ====
These pronouns are built from another pronoun by adding an undeclinable suffix , , , or (, , , ). In these cases, the pronoun it consists of is declined as usual and the suffix is added at the end. Thus endings turn into infixes. (genitive singular masculine , , , ). Pronouns ending in can also be written in three words and those ending in in two: , .

==== , , and ====
The demonstrative &quot;this&quot; inflects like an adjective, but &quot;-i-&quot; in the endings is replaced with &quot;-e-&quot;. Many of the forms have shortened alternatives, including cases of non-final short accents.

The word &quot;all&quot; and inflects much like , but it inflects as if it were a soft stem, having &quot;-e&quot; in the neuter nominative/accusative singular. All the accents are short, even those in a non-final syllable, where [ə] is pronounced.
=== Numerals ===
Numeral &#x27;one&#x27; and its derivatives have a definite form in nominative singular when nominalized, but others are the same. Numerals &#x27;two&#x27; and have -i- in endings replaced with -e- and numerals &#x27;three&#x27; and &#x27;four&#x27; have a different ending in nominative and accusative. Numeral also changes the -i- in the ending to -e- in other cases. Other cardinal numerals have a null ending in all genders in nominative, vocative, and accusative (example &#x27;five&#x27;). Numeral (stem ) &#x27;hundred&#x27; has a different form in nominative, vocative, and accusative, and open-mid vowel in numerals (stem ) &#x27;five&#x27;, (stem ) &#x27;six&#x27;, (stem ) &#x27;seven&#x27;, (stem ) &#x27;eight&#x27;, (stem ) &#x27;nine&#x27;, and (stem ) &#x27;ten&#x27; is changed to close-mid vowel in nominative. They also change the accent irregularly in nominative and accusative:

Note that this changes occur only when numerals follow first adjective declension. When following second declension, numerals have a nominative form throughout. For more information regarding which declension they follow, see section words that can follow both declensions.

== Dialectal and obsolete declension changes ==
There are many dialectal changes, with the most common being:

* Neuter o-stem alternatively have ending in nominative singular.
* Feminine v-stem nouns can decline as a-stems.
* Endings , , instead of , , .
* Locative singular became the same as dative singular.
* Archaic ending -e in o-stem locative singular is still present in archaic northern Littoral dialects.
* Simplification of irregular nouns into regular.
* Change of non-final vowels in endings to a (e. g. )

Many different endings can also appear in general colloquial speech:

* Many masculine nouns can either follow n-stem or t-stem declension, especially those following a-stem declension and those ending in .
* Ending instead of in nominative plural for masculine o-stems.
* Loss of dual, especially when ending in vowel + + vowel.

There are also some obsolete styles of declension lost in modern Slovene:

* No distinction between soft and hard stems. (the current differences occurred in 19th century)
* Noun still followed i-stem declension up to 19th century.
* Dative and locative were the same for nominal declensions in 15th century.
* Feminine a-stem had ending either or in instrumental singular.
* Comparative and superlative used to be indeclinable.
* Superlative used to be formed with .
* Special endings for vocative case.

=== Declension with tone changes ===
In the southeastern part of Brda dialect, the modern vowel reduction was so developed that a new way of declining nouns was developed. Brda dialect lost the original tonal oppositions, but they developed them back in a new way, so more cases can be distinguished:

A similar thing also happens with &quot;i&quot;-stem nouns when the ending is .

<text>Boissevain () is an unincorporated urban community in Manitoba near the North Dakota border that held town status prior to 2015. It is located within the Municipality of Boissevain – Morton. Boissevain is a community of just over 1,500 people and it is located between Killarney and Deloraine on the east and west and Brandon to the north. The population of the surrounding area, within a 50 kilometre radius of the community, is about 15,000.

It is notable for its proximity to the International Peace Garden, a short drive south on Highway 10. The community also displays a number of wall murals as a tourist attraction. The community was named after Adolphe Boissevain who helped finance the Canadian Pacific Railway. Boissevain, not far from Turtle Mountain and Turtle Mountain Provincial Park, also formerly hosted the &quot;International Turtle Derby&quot;, a turtle race, each summer. &quot;Tommy the Turtle&quot; is a 28-foot-tall, 10,000-lb western painted turtle that serves as an icon for both the Turtle Derby and the community as a whole.

==Etymology==
The community was originally named Cherry Creek in 1881, the post office was opened in the town in 1886 and was named after Adolphe Boissevain, senior member of the firm Boissevain and Company who introduced Canadian Pacific Railway shares for sale in Europe. The community&#x27;s school district was originally named Nimitau in 1886 when it was founded, but the name changed to Boissevain in 1894.

==History==
Work began along the anticipated route of the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1874, surveyors were impressed with the Turtle Mountain region and noted it would become a chief point of settlement in the coming years. The site of the town of Boissevain was decided by the CPR in 1885. By 1886 there was a blacksmith shop, a post office and two grain warehouses. 

As pioneer life transitioned to the comforts of a growing town, many new buildings, schools and churches were built. One of the prominent buildings constructed was the St. Matthew&#x27;s Anglican Church, built with granite walls found in the local fields. Sandstone was also discovered nearby by the earlier surveyors. The sandstone was used to construct another place of worship and local landmark, the St. Paul&#x27;s United Church which was completed in 1893.

Like many towns in the west, Boissevain&#x27;s prosperity came with the railway, in this case the CPR line was the first to arrive in 1885. Three other additional railways in the area, including the Great Northern Railway through the railway&#x27;s subsidiary organized under the name of the &quot;Brandon, Saskatchewan and Hudson Bay Railway&quot;, which meant that farmers could now ship their goods to the United States in the south while also having a link with Brandon to the north. The railways began to decline during The Great Depression and with it the fortunes of Boissevain. The Great Northern line ended service in 1936.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Boissevain had a population of 1,577 living in 700 of its 736 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 1,656. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

== Education ==
Boissevain School was nominated one of Canada&#x27;s 30 best schools by Maclean&#x27;s Magazine in 2005.

== Media ==
CJRB (1220 AM) broadcasts an easy listening format from Boissevain. The station is owned by Golden West Broadcasting.

==Sports==
Curling has been a competitive sport in Boissevain since 1890. The Boissevain Border Kings compete in the South West Hockey League in Manitoba. The Border Kings did not win a championship for 35 years but then wound up winning six straight championships in 1993. In baseball, the Boissevain Bantams won the provincial championship in 1977. Currently, the Boissevain Broncos high school sports program includes several teams competing in football, baseball, and hockey.

<doc id="1301640" wikidata="Q1322398" url="?curid=1301640" title="PPG Place">
<text>PPG Place is a complex in downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, consisting of six buildings within three city blocks and five and a half acres. PPG Place was designed by architects Philip Johnson and John Burgee.

Named for its anchor tenant, PPG Industries, which initiated the project for its headquarters, the buildings are all of matching glass design consisting of 19,750 pieces of glass. The complex centers on One PPG Place, a 40-story office building. Groundbreaking ceremonies occurred on January 28, 1981. The complex buildings opened between 1983 and 1984, and a dedication ceremony took place on April 11, 1984. Total cost of construction was $200 million ($ million today). The buildings were sold by The Hillman Company to Highwoods Properties in 2011.

==Construction==
The project was started by PPG Industries (formerly Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company) to serve as the company&#x27;s headquarters, after being based in Downtown Pittsburgh since 1895. The company contracted the project to architect Philip Johnson and his partner John Burgee. Designed in the neogothic style but with modern innovations, the complex had many inspirations, including London&#x27;s Victoria Tower, and H.H. Richardson&#x27;s Allegheny County Courthouse and Charles Klauder&#x27;s Cathedral of Learning in Pittsburgh. Before the building was constructed, an 8-foot-tall, 600 pound model was made, with glass cut at the Ford City PPG works.

During demolition and preparation of the site, a team of University of Pittsburgh anthropologists collected over 10,000 artifacts dating to the 18th century in what was the Kings Garden and Kings Orchard about 1,000 feet from the gate to Fort Pitt, as well as many medical instruments denoting facilities in the area. The team also discovered several stone-lined wells and cisterns dating to around 1800 that were subsequently filled with refuse and artifacts in the early 1800s as the early settlement expanded and the wells went dry. The site was the home of the four-story Guskey&#x27;s Department Store for much of the 20th century.

The buildings are recognized by their 231 glass spires, with the largest one tall. Also notable are the surfaces of reflective insulating glass, that served to advertise the project&#x27;s founder. The buildings contain over one million square feet of PPG&#x27;s Solarban 550 Twindow - 19,750 pieces. The primary building, One PPG Place, is a 40-story tower, with PPG Industries occupying half of the space. The complex also contains a 14-story building, and four 6-story structures. PPG Industries also uses space in one of the other buildings. The lobby of One PPG is a -high entrance that features red glass. The building has 21 elevators, each with walls constructed of clear glass panels enclosing fractured glass. In total, the complex cost $200 million.

The design of the building not only made it distinct, but created high energy-efficiency. Heat in the summer is reflected away from the building by the glass, while in winter infrared heat is reflected and contained within the building. The surface walls feature a barrier construction that effectively separates the interior walls from the exterior. The building also collects heat from computer equipment and recycles it throughout the structure.

Construction of the building highlighted Pittsburgh&#x27;s &quot;Renaissance II period&quot;, which saw the Pittsburgh economy weather steel mill closures, while Pittsburgh Plate Glass remained a Fortune 500 company.

Office space opened in August 1983, the retail shops opened in November 1984, and the complex was dedicated on April 11, 1984.

==Buildings and public spaces==

PPG Place sits on six city blocks () bound by Forbes Avenue and the Boulevard of the Allies on its north and south sides, and Stanwix Street and Wood Street to its east and west. The complex consists of six buildings, which surround an open-air plaza:
* One PPG Place, a 40-floor building with a height of , and a total capacity of approximately . This is the tallest building in the complex, serving as the complex&#x27;s centerpiece, and as of 2020 is the third tallest building in Pittsburgh.
* Two PPG Place, a 6-floor building.
* Three PPG Place, a 6-floor building.
* Four PPG Place, a 6-floor building.
* Five PPG Place, a 6-floor building.
* Six PPG Place, a 14-floor building with a height of .
One PPG Place includes the Wintergarden, an event space with vaulted glass ceilings. While the Wintergarden is part of One PPG Place, it does not sit within the 40-story tower portion of the building. Instead, it is attached to the side of the tower, facing Stanwix Street.

PPG Place is directly adjacent to Market Square, creating a large and popular public space in downtown Pittsburgh.

===PPG Place Plaza===

The PPG Place Plaza sits between Third Avenue and Fourth Avenue. The plaza features a fountain with 140 water jets and uses 280 underground lights. Opened in 2003, it was designed by WET and SWA Group landscape architecture and urban design. At the center of the fountain is a pink granite obelisk.

During the winter months, the plaza is converted into an ice skating rink. The rink opened on December 10, 2001, and has become a popular seasonal attraction in downtown. A Christmas tree is in the center of the rink. At , the surface is over larger than the famous rink in New York&#x27;s Rockefeller Center.

==Reception==

Upon completion of the project, architectural critics and the media called PPG Place &quot;the crown jewel in Pittsburgh&#x27;s skyline,&quot; &quot;the towering success of downtown Pittsburgh,&quot; and &quot;one of the most ambitious, sensitive and public spirited urban developments since Rockefeller Center.&quot; In 2006, readers of the &quot;Pittsburgh City Paper&quot; voted PPG Place as the best building in Pittsburgh.

In 2005, when the vacancy rate of downtown offices was around 20%, PPG Place was between 87 and 89% full. The management company was able to attract out-of-town corporations to relocate operations to Pittsburgh. News America Marketing, a subsidiary of News Corporation, occupies . Local Kennametal Inc. rented office space, and LandAmerica Financial Group relocated several area office locations to the 12th floor of One PPG Place. Carnegie Mellon University operates alumni relations from the complex.

<doc id="1301647" wikidata="Q7936355" url="?curid=1301647" title="Vislor Turlough">
<text>Vislor Turlough is a fictional character played by Mark Strickson in the long-running British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. He was a companion of the Fifth Doctor, being a regular in the programme from 1983 to 1984. Turlough is an alien from the planet Trion who seeks to kill the Fifth Doctor on orders from the antagonist known as the Black Guardian. Turlough later chooses to side with the Doctor, accompanying him until Turlough&#x27;s departure from the series in the 1984 serial &quot;Planet of Fire&quot;. 

Turlough was created during a script meeting with script editor Eric Saward, who liked the concept of a companion who existed to try and kill the Doctor. Strickson was requested to be cast in the part by his agent, and was one of the last actors producer John Nathan-Turner saw in the auditions for Turlough&#x27;s character. Nathan-Turner enjoyed Strickson&#x27;s performance and offered him the part, with Strickson turning down a potential role in the series &quot;Angels&quot; to appear in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.

Turlough&#x27;s role in the series was criticized by literary critic John Kenneth Muir, who believed Turlough to be underdeveloped despite Strickson&#x27;s good acting performance. Other critics felt the character&#x27;s writing quality varied, though he has received analysis in the book &quot;Who is Who?,&quot; which analyzed his development as a result of his interactions with the Doctor. 

== Character history ==
Turlough first appears in the serial &quot;Mawdryn Undead&quot;, where he is a student of retired Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart. Turlough is an alien in exile, and after nearly dying in a car accident, is contacted by the malevolent Black Guardian, who offers to take him back to his home planet Trion if he kills the Doctor, which is an offer that Turlough accepts. At the end of the serial, Turlough asks to accompany the Doctor. Despite the suspicions of the Doctor&#x27;s other companions, the Doctor lets Turlough join him and the others in the TARDIS.

Turlough accompanies the Doctor but fails in his attempts on his life in &quot;Terminus&quot;, proving hesitant in his attempts to kill the Doctor. In the serial &quot;Enlightenment,&quot; Turlough joins in the race to obtain the titular &quot;Enlightenment&quot;. He is given the choice to give the power from the Enlightenment to either the Doctor or the Black Guardian, and chooses the Doctor, freeing himself from the Black Guardian&#x27;s pact. Turlough continues to accompany the Doctor following this point. 

Turlough makes his final appearance in the serial &quot;Planet of Fire&quot;, where it is revealed that Turlough is a junior ensign commander from the planet Trion. Following a civil war on his home planet, in which his mother was killed, Turlough&#x27;s family were arrested as political prisoners. His father and younger brother Malkon were exiled to the planet Sarn while Turlough himself was exiled to Earth. Turlough discovers that political prisoners are no longer treated harshly on Trion, and decides to return home. Turlough makes a brief cameo in the following serial, &quot;The Caves of Androzani&quot;, where he appears as a hallucination encouraging the Doctor not to die. 

== Development ==
The concept for Turlough was created at a script conference with script editor Eric Saward. The concept of a companion who would be working to kill the Doctor proved appealing to Saward, and so they went ahead with the idea. The character was conceived as having his duplicity known by both the audience and the other characters, including the Doctor, though the latter would pretend to be unaware of Turlough&#x27;s actions until Turlough was faced with the choice to kill him. It was deemed boring for the character to hold strictly to the concept of &quot;evil companion turned good&quot;, and thus it was decided that Turlough would continue to show hints of potential betrayal even after proving himself to the Doctor. Lead actor Peter Davison remarked that it was one of producer John Nathan-Turner&#x27;s attempts to give the Doctor a &quot;companion with attitude&quot;, citing previous examples like Adric and Tegan.

According to Nathan-Turner, Strickson&#x27;s agent, Jan Evans, had recommended Strickson to Nathan-Turner, believing Strickson fit Turlough&#x27;s character perfectly. Strickson at the time was in a medical drama television series called &quot;Angels&quot;. A lead actor had fallen ill, and according to Strickson, he had been cast in the lead role without any prior conversation, and wasn&#x27;t keen on doing the part. Julia Smith, who was producing &quot;Angels&quot;, encouraged Nathan-Turner to cancel Strickson&#x27;s audition, but Nathan-Turner went through with it regardless. With a cast celebration party imminent on &quot;Angels&quot;, Strickson went to the home of Nathan-Turner and held his audition for Turlough there. Afterward, Nathan-Turner got Saward to see Strickson&#x27;s audition. Strickson was contacted later that day with confirmation that he had been cast, though Nathan-Turner continued to host auditions for Turlough for the next two weeks, with the other actors who auditioned being cast in other roles in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. Strickson accepted the part. 

Strickson naturally has blond hair, which Nathan-Turner believed problematic due to Davison also having blond hair. According to Strickson, Nathan-Turner originally pitched that Turlough should be bald, but Strickson was able to convince Nathan-Turner against it by requiring additional fees to make up for it. Nathan-Turner then pitched that Strickson should have red hair, which Strickson agreed to. Nathan-Turner used washout dye for Strickson&#x27;s hair dye, but the dye did not wash out, resulting in Strickson&#x27;s hair remaining red for the entirety of his time on the show. According to Strickson, it made him substantially more recognizable in public, and children would run in fear of him. Strickson&#x27;s wife would know of his return home because children would shout &quot;There goes Turlough! Hello Turlough!&quot; when they saw him. Strickson had strong influence on Turlough&#x27;s costume choice, stating that he wanted the costume to be consistent so Turlough was instantly recognizable. As a result, Turlough&#x27;s schoolboy costume remained consistent, which Strickson believed worked well due to the contrast between the black suit and the costumes of his co-stars. Nathan-Turner changed Turlough&#x27;s costume for his last story, as there was significant fan demand to see Turlough&#x27;s legs according to Strickson. Strickson stated that he did not want to wear shorts, but &quot;Planet of Fire&quot; was written with a scene requiring Turlough to swim in a hot locale, necessitating shorts.

During filming, Strickson had gripes with the &quot;two-dimensional&quot; acting of the show, and attempted to give Turlough more depth by building relationships in the background. According to Strickson, he attempted to form relationships with nearly every female cast member to attempt to make the show more interesting, with the attempts of both him and Janet Fielding, who portrayed Tegan, being the most prominent one, with it being picked up on by the writers. Strickson, when annoyed by another actor, would frequently get into shot and interact with the TARDIS console while they were speaking, requiring the sound designers to put sound effects over the shot in editing to make the TARDIS appear functional. Strickson primarily enjoyed his time on the show, citing the filming of the episode &quot;Enlightenment&quot; as a favorite. He disliked the filming of the episode &quot;Terminus&quot; due to its atmosphere and because the amount of crawling Strickson had to do resulted in his costume&#x27;s trousers becoming worn out. According to Strickson, he signed to do his own stunts. He stopped after an incident filming &quot;Enlightenment,&quot; in which a harness attached around the actor&#x27;s crotch broke, causing injury. Strickson stated that he was unable to walk properly for two weeks afterward. The prop used by Strickson for communicating with the Black Guardian also proved problematic, as the light in the prop could only be turned off and on by another crew member carrying the battery. Strickson would shake his leg to indicate he wanted it on or off, and if the crew member could not see the shaking, Strickson had to carry on with the scene. According to Strickson, there are many outtakes where he had to stop filming because the prop&#x27;s light was too hot and threatened to burn his hand. 

Turlough&#x27;s role was very political, and his exile and backstory in relation to his home planet Trion acted as an allegory for what was going on in Poland during the period of the Iron Curtain. According to Strickson, Turlough was very &quot;socialist – an interplanetary thinker, a freedom fighter.&quot; Many of the character&#x27;s political speeches were cut. By the time of his departure from the series, Turlough&#x27;s character had evolved into a trustworthy figure for the Doctor, though Turlough still acted out for his own interests on occasion. 

According to Davison, Turlough proved problematic with the writers, as the writers were unsure of how long they should have Turlough attempt to kill the Doctor for. Due to disagreements, Turlough was frequently held prisoner for several episodes at a time to sidestep the issue entirely. Additionally, Strickson would frequently act scenes as if Turlough had knowledge equivalent to the Doctor, which Fielding also did. As a result, Nathan-Turner forced both Strickson and Fielding to &quot;dumb down&quot; their performances due to how boring it made the programme, which Strickson stated in 1990 was part of why he left the series, as he believed there wasn&#x27;t room for his character to work within the series&#x27; structure. According to Strickson in an earlier 1985 interview with &quot;Fantasy Empire&quot;, he decided to leave the series due to Davison also leaving at the same time.

==Reception==
Literary critic John Kenneth Muir criticized Turlough as being an ineffectual character, stating that while introduced as a big deal in his debut episode, he was frequently portrayed as incompetent. He believed that after the resolution of the Black Guardian plot-line, Turlough lost a purpose in the series, as he could not act as the leading hero (Which was the Doctor&#x27;s role) and many of the action elements of the series did not require a second male lead. Muir believed Turlough to be one of the series&#x27; most underdeveloped elements, and a failure of his initial role. Muir, despite his criticism, praised Strickson&#x27;s performance, and found Turlough&#x27;s ending in &quot;Planet of Fire&quot; to be &quot;satisfactory&quot;. Andrew Blair, writing for &quot;Den of Geek&quot;, highlighted Turlough&#x27;s departure, stating that while Turlough was undeveloped after his appearance in &quot;Enlightenment&quot;, the departure was well-written. Blair also highlighted how &quot;Planet of Fire&quot; allowed Turlough to use intelligence, unlike his other appearances.

&quot;Fantasy Empire&quot; described Turlough as being a reliable character in the series, being a strong character who could function individually of the Doctor. They felt that his reunion with his species in &quot;Planet of Fire&quot; made the character appear gullible, unlike his prior characterization. Author Kevin S. Decker, writing for the book &quot;Who is Who?,&quot; found the Doctor&#x27;s role in taking on Turlough to be an attempt by the Doctor to make up for the death of Adric earlier in the series. He also found Turlough&#x27;s choice in &quot;Enlightenment&quot; to betray the Black Guardian in favor of the Doctor to be a culmination of the Turlough&#x27;s growth at the hands of the Doctor, with Turlough accepting his responsibility for his actions and making an authentic choice of his own accord. Tanya Huff, writing in the book &quot;Queers Dig Time Lords&quot;, described Turlough&#x27;s tendency to keep secrets, as well as the character&#x27;s intensity, to appear akin to a romantic partner for the Fifth Doctor, which Huff cited as laying the ground for the eventual debut of Jack Harkness, the show&#x27;s first openly bisexual character.

<text>This article describes the conjugation and use of [[verb]]s in [[Slovene language|Slovene]]. Further information about the grammar of the Slovene language can be found in the article Slovene grammar.

This article follows the &quot;tonal&quot; orthography. For the conversion into &quot;pitch&quot; orthography, see &quot;Slovene national phonetic transcription&quot;.

== Grammatical categories ==

=== Persons and numbers ===
Slovene has three numbers (singular, dual, plural), for more information see Slovene declension.

Slovene also has three persons:

# First person (), used to refer to the speaker or a group the speaker is a part of.
# Second person (), used to refer to the listener or for a general subject (the same as what one is used in English or man in German).
# Third person (), used to refer to a person that does participate in a conversation, when there is no subject (with impersonal verbs) and when the subject is not in nominative case (e. g. &#x27;I am not home&#x27;, but literally &#x27;I is not home&#x27;).

First and third person can be used instead of second when talking to children. Second person can be used instead of the first when one is talking to oneself and want to sound detached.

=== Tenses ===
In Slovene, there are four tenses:

# The present tense ().
# The past or preterite tense ().
# The pluperfect (past perfect) tense ().
# The future tense ().

=== Moods ===
There are 4 verb moods:

# Indicative mood (), which is used to state a fact or opinion. It can be in all aforementioned tenses.
# Imperative mood (), which is used to give commands. It can only be in present tense.
# Conditional mood , which is used to state possibilities or wishes, for example, &quot;If only I were...&quot; It can be in present or preterite tense.
# Optative or hortative mood (, ), which is used to give commands, for assumptions and for encouragement. It can be in all tenses. Both names are usually used interchangeably, but since there are two ways of formation, terms in this article refer to different ways of formation, especially because only one of them can be used for encouragement (and can hence be called hortative). In Slovene literature, this mood is only considered to be extension of the indicative and conditional mood.

=== Non-finite forms ===
In addition, there are several non-finite forms:

# Long infinitive in / () and short infinitive in / (), the use of the latter one is limited to non-formal situations and mostly to speech.
# Supine in / ().
# Two present active participles, in and in , indicating ongoing action.
# Two past active participles, in and in , indicating a past or completed action.
# A past passive participle in or , indicating an action having been performed on something.
# Gerund (), indicating an act or a thing being acted upon.

=== Aspect ===
As in all Slavic languages, Slovene verbs are classified based on their aspect:

# Perfective () verbs, which represent a completed action.
# Imperfective () verbs, which represent an ongoing action.

Each verb is either perfective or imperfective, and most verbs occur in pairs to express the same meaning with different aspects. For example, the concept of &quot;jumping&quot; is expressed in the 2 different aspects is , which has an imperfective aspect and can roughly be translated as &quot;to be jumping (continuously)&quot;, and , which has a perfective aspect and can roughly be translated as &quot;to jump (once)&quot;. While each aspect is represented by a full verb with its own distinct conjugation, certain combinations are not or rarely used in one aspect or the other. For example, imperfective verbs generally lack a past passive participle, while perfective verbs usually have no present participles. Additionally, the present tense has 2 different meanings depending on the aspect of a verb. For imperfective verbs, it has present meaning, while for perfective verbs, it has a future meaning expressing a desire to carry out the action. For example, . &quot;I want to sell the cow&quot; (compare this with the future tense . &quot;I will sell the cow&quot;).

=== Transitivity ===
As well, verbs can be classified based on their transitivity (). Many verbs in Slovene can be both transitive and intransitive depending on their use in a sentence. However, all reflexive verbs, which are marked by the pronoun (one self), are intransitive.

=== Impersonal verbs ===
There are also impersonal verbs; these can only have forms for third person and participles in neuter gender. These are mostly verbs to describe weather, such as &#x27;to rain&#x27; and &#x27;to thunder&#x27;.

=== Voices ===
There are three voices: active (), passive (), and reflexive (). Active and reflexive voice can be in all tenses, while passive voice cannot be in pluperfect or past (and future) conditional.

=== Verb classes ===
Verbs are often classified into six classes, depending on their verbal suffix in infinitive:

* Class I has no verbal suffix, e. g. &#x27;carry&#x27; and &#x27;drink&#x27;.
* Class II has suffix , e. g. &#x27;sink, sag&#x27;.
* Class III has suffix or and in present stem, e. g. &#x27;sit&#x27; and &#x27;scream&#x27;.
* Class IV has suffix , e. g. &#x27;aim&#x27;.
* Class V has suffixes , , , , , , or (but never changes into ), e. g. &#x27;weave&#x27; and &#x27;write&#x27;.
* Class VI has suffixes (hard) or (soft), e. g. &#x27;buy&#x27;

=== Accentual types ===

There are several different accentual types, that can be divided differently. It is rarely divided the same way as in Proto-Slavic because all the accent shifts have made such division impractical. It is usually divided where the accent is situated and thus the verbs are divided into seven groups.

* Accent is not directly before the endings (marked as I)
* Accent is directly before infinitive ending and not directly before present indicative endings (marked as II A)
* Accent can be on two different vowels in infinitive (marked as II B)
* Accent is on other vowel in infinitive and present indicative (marked as II C)
* Accent is on the last vowel (marked as II D); currently, only verb and its derivatives follows this pattern. In the past, verbs and also followed this pattern.
* Accent is directly before the endings (marked as III)
* Accent is not directly before infinitive ending and directly before present indicative endings (marked as IV)

=== Polite forms ===
Slovene has T–V distinction and has many different polite forms. See T–V distinction in the world&#x27;s languages § Slovene for when they are used.

* Forms showed here are forms.
* is formed by replacing second person singular with plural, participles are in masculine forms.
* is formed by replacing second person singular with plural, but participles stay in singular.
* is formed by replacing second person and third person singular with third person plural, participles are in masculine forms.
* is formed by replacing second person with third person, participles are in neuter forms.

== Morphological structure ==
Verbs in Slovene have a complex morphological structure as they consist of several phonemes. The core of a verb form prefixes, roots and root suffixes. Root is the only of these three morphemes that is not optional and other morphemes are added to it. In most cases only one is present in a verb, but there are also verbs with more than one root, e. g. &#x27;to urbanize&#x27;. Prefixes often indicate a perfective verb. Most verbs have none or one prefix, but some can also have more, such as &#x27;split evenly&#x27;. Root suffixes are not so common; an example would be &#x27;cut wood&#x27; or &#x27;to urbanize&#x27;. These parts together convey the meaning of a verb.

The stem is formed by adding a verbal suffix, which influences the aspect ( vs. &#x27;break&#x27;; the first one is perfective, the other one imperfective) and the conjugation. Verbs have two stems. The present stem forms the base for all forms of the present indicative and the imperative, as well as the present participles. The infinitive stem forms the infinitives, supine, gerund, and past participles.

Stem is then followed by the form suffix, e. g. for long infinitive, for past active participle and for imperative. The suffix is then followed by the ending, which is specific for each person/number/case. There are also free morphemes, such as &#x27;pretend&#x27;, &#x27;make mistakes&#x27; or &#x27;love&#x27;.

== Conjugation ==
Only the present indicative, the imperative and the non-finite forms are usually formed synthetically, by changing the form of the verb directly. All other forms are periphrastic (analytic), and are formed using auxiliary verbs or other additional words.

Verbs are separated based on the ending vowel of their stem.

=== Present indicative ===
In present indicative, verbs have mostly the same endings across all declensions, but those following accentual type II D, III, IV, and some following II A can also have a special stylistically marked ending in third person plural. Those that have ending have the infix in second person plural and second / third person dual. The extra is added to the endings when the verb stem ends in a consonant. This causes changes to stems ending in or (which have an infinitive in ); these become and before the present tense endings.

The special ending in third person plural are always acute, but otherwise do not change the accent, except for the lengthening of short vowels. Verbs following II B, II C and III can be either acute or allow both accents in infinitive, but that does not affect the further accent changes. Verbs following II D, when accented on the same vowel on the stem as in infinitive also have the same accent. Dialectally, verbs in can also omit the infix, and it is common for speakers of Littoral dialect group to add the infix elsewhere, as well as to use the ending . Ending can also have some verbs in (those from Proto-Slavic accentual type a/c, and accentual type c if they had accent on a long vowel in the stem) e.g. , , , as well as all vowels in , e. g. .

Forms in brackets are not officially recognized to be correct in standard Slovene. All verbs in can archaically have short accent on the last syllable in dual and plural, as well as verb .
=== Imperative mood ===
The imperative mood is used to give commands, and only exists in the present tense. There are no forms for the third person plural, and use for first and third person singular and third person dual is stylistically marked.

The following endings are added to the present stem of a verb, to form the present indicative. If the present stem ends in , the initial of the ending changes to a . Present stems ending with other vowels drop their final vowel. If the present stem ends in a vowel followed by , then the initial of the ending is omitted. The endings also cause changes to stems ending in or (which have an infinitive in ); these become and , respectively before the imperative endings, although colloquially they keep the same consonants as in present indicative ( and , respectively).

Verbs change accent in imperative based on the accent in infinitive and indicative, as well as where in the word the accent is:

* Accentual type II A, circumflex indicative: singular is acute if the accent is not on the last syllable, otherwise it allows both accents, except final open-mid , which is circumflex. In dual and plural, accent is circumflex if the accent is on the penultimate syllable, otherwise it is acute.
* Accentual type II C and III, circumflex indicative: accent is circumflex if on the last syllable in singular and on the penultimate syllable in dual and plural, otherwise it is acute.
* Accentual type II and III, cute indicative: singular is acute, but allows both accents on the last syllable. In dual and plural, accent is circumflex if the accent is on the penultimate syllable, otherwise it is acute.
* Accentual type III, short accent in indicative: accent is acute, except on the penultimate syllable in dual and plural.
* Accentual type IV: accent is acute except on the last syllable in singular and penultimate syllable in dual and plural, where it is circumflex.
* Some acute verbs following accentual type I can in imperative follow II B (example , ). The accent therefore changes the same way as with those.
* Acute verbs following accentual type III that are circumflex in passive participle and the accent is on the same syllable in indicative can be acute or circumflex (example ).
* Verbs , and change the accent irregularly.
* All verbs that change the accentuated vowel, except accentual type III, are in many dialects always accentuated on the first vowel throughout.
Examples:

* . (Tidy your room.)
* . (Let&#x27;s play. Literally, Let&#x27;s go playing)
* . (I should be working and toiling while you spend the money. – Such use is stylistically marked.)
* . ([Let] it be your way. – Such use is stylistically marked.)

=== Present active participles ===
There are two present active participles, which are used almost exclusively with imperfective verbs. They correspond to the English participle in , and indicate ongoing or current action.

The first is an adjectival participle. It is formed by adding to verbs with present stem in or those ending in // + or rarely any other consonant (which lose their final vowel), to verbs with present stem in (the vowel is kept, so ), and to other verbs with present stem ending in . It declines as a regular soft adjective with fixed accent and is compared periphrastically. Adverb ending in is used when the participle is adjectivalized.

The accent is the same for all accentual types, however it is differentiated between different endings. The accent is always on the final or . is long close-mid, but can be short in masculine singular nominative form when it is used as an adjective. is short in masculine singular nominative form and long close-mid in others, but can also be long close-mid in all forms if not used as an adjective.

The accent is acute, except in masculine singular nominative form, where it allows both accents.

Examples:

* . (A child that cries is a crying child.)
* . (He entered the room singing loudly.)
* (The question painfully hurt his feelings.)

The second is an adverbial participle. It was originally the nominative singular of the first participle, which had an irregular form. It is formed by removing from the first participle and changing to . For verbs whose infinitive stem ends in or and some in /, infinitive stem is used instead. Verbs with present stem in usually also take the infinitive verbal suffix, but archaic form is made with present suffix. Again, the accent depends fully on the type of ending and not on the accentual type. If the accent is on the last syllable, then it allows both accents, otherwise it is circumflex.

Example:

* . ([While] sitting, he stretched.)

=== Infinitives and supine ===

There are 2 verbal nouns: the &quot;infinitive&quot; (), which can be long or short and the &quot;supine&quot; ().

The long infinitive is the basic verb form found in dictionaries, and ends in .

The supine and short infinitive are formed by dropping the last of the infinitive. Supine is used after verbs that designate motion. For example, the supine would be used in the following sentences (the supine has been put in bold):

* . (They went to the New World to seek fortune.)
* . (Literally, Go salt yourself. This idiomatic statement is used to express annoyance or refusal)
* . (We ran to put out the fire.)

When the infinitive or supine ending is attached to an infinitive stem ending in a consonant, that consonant may change, as follows:
* → (, &quot;beat&quot;)
* → (, &quot;scratch, scrape&quot;)
* → (, &quot;sit down&quot;)
* → (, &quot;find (something lost)&quot;)
* → (, &quot;braid&quot;)
* → (, &quot;grow&quot;)
* → (, &quot;bite, chew&quot;)
* → (, () &quot;lie down&quot;)
* → (, () &quot;say&quot;)

However, there is an accentual difference between short infinitive and supine. In addition, accent in supine is in some accentual types different between perfective and imperfective verbs. Short infinitive has the same accent as supine of perfective verbs, except for two irregular verbs detailed below. The accent is determined by the accentual type, as well as stem vowel and the position in a word:

* Supine is circumflex if the last syllable is accentuated, otherwise it is acute, except verbs that are circumflex in the infinitive – these are always circumflex.
* Verbs following accentual type I, II B, II D and IV have acute accent on the stem on same syllable as long infinitive.
* Other accentual types can have short accent on the last syllable, long accent on the last syllable or long accent on non-final syllable.
* Verbs in and follow the same accentual changes as other , but the changes into and , respectively. The examples given below are added just to illustrate those changes and not to have separate accent changes.
Verbs in usually have short infinitive and supine in , but some dialects add at the end, which is also common in colloquial speech.

Some verbs in following accentual type II A, II C or III can follow two subpatterns, which are also present in participle in . The first subpattern has long accent in supine of imperfective verbs and masculine nominative singular form of participle in . The second subpattern transfers the accent to the syllable before and only exists in accentual types II C and III. Verbs in following accentual type III can also have either long close-mid or short open-mid vowel in short infinitive.
=== Past active participles ===
There are two kinds of past active participle, used with different functions.

The l-participle exists for all verbs, and is used mainly to form the past and future tense. It is further split into two categories; the descriptive l-participle is used only for analytical forms and therefore can only exist in nominative case and always has to appear with an auxiliary verb. The stative l-participle denotes a state of an object and can also be used as a stand-alone adjective, but not all verbs have it.

It is formed by adding to the infinitive stem. A fill vowel (schwa, ) is inserted in the masculine singular form when attached to verbs with an infinitive stem ending in a consonant.

Stative l-participle can be the same as the descriptive l-participle ( → /), but it sometimes changes to have a fill vowel ( → ). The accent can also change between the two.

Accentually, masculine form has the same accent as imperfective verbs in supine, with the exception being verbs in and accentual type II D, and the tone can also change. In feminine and neuter forms, short accent lengthens if short, and shifts in accentual types II B and II C.

Verbs in , when the supine is accentuated on the last syllable, can have either long close-mid or short accent on e in masculine form. Verbs in lose the and the accent is on . Verbs following accentual type II D have short accent on the last syllable.

Tone is determined by the tone in long infinitive and present indicative, as well as accent length and position in masculine form and accentual type. Based on the accent in masculine form, verbs can belong to one of three groups:

# Long accent on the last syllable
# Short accent on the last syllable
# Long accent that is not on the last syllable

Similarly to imperative, the accent of some verbs following accentual type I can also shift to the next syllable. In these forms, accentual changes are the same as for verbs following accentual type II C.

There are also exceptions; verbs in prefix + that do not have an alternative version ending in (e. g. ) and verbs in prefix + , which may change to (e. g. ) allow both accents in masculine form, the latter ones also in all other forms.

It further declines as a regular fixed or mobile accent adjective and is compared periphrastically. Other forms have the same accent as neuter gender.
Types where accent shifts between forms, however, can vary widely between dialects. Verbs following accentual type II A colloquially prefer to have fixed accent. Verbs in can also have fixed accent on the first syllable.

Stative participles decline as regular hard adjectives with fixed accent and are compared periphrastically.
Examples:
* . (I saw.)
* . (Upon [hearing] the news, she became pale.)

The š-participle is also an adjectival participle, and is rarely used in modern Slovene and mostly as an adverb. It denotes completed action, and is equivalent to the English construct with &quot;having&quot; + past participle. It is formed by adding to the infinitive stem. The ending is only if the infinitive stem ends in a consonant. Accent is almost always circumflex and on the penultimate syllable, some can also have the same accent as l-participle (example ). before is always close-mid, but and before are the same as in l-participle.

The only example of š-participle used in modern Slovene is , meaning &quot;ex&quot;, but aside from that few other verbs have commonly used š-participle as an adjective.

Examples:
* . (Having stepped out of the house, he headed to the pub.)
* (Having come guest sat down by the table.)

=== Past passive participle ===
This participle corresponds to the English participle in -ed or -en, and is an adjective that indicates a state of having undergone an action. It exists only for transitive verbs, and almost only if they are perfective. It is formed with two possible suffixes, or , but further formation is affected by stem, as well as accentual type. Similarly to l-participle, it is also divided into descriptive and stative passive participle.

Both accentual type and stem affect the accent position, which is marked with in the following table. If it is not marked, then it is on the same syllable on the stem as in long infinitive. All accents are long, except in and / forms, as well as accentual type II D, which are short if marked.

Participle further declines as a regular fixed accent adjective and is compared periphrastically.

When stem ending in a consonant is followed by , it iotizes.

* These forms follow verbs ending in (e. g. , &quot;gush, shout&quot;).

The t-participle is always circumflex, while n-participle is circumflex or acute, depending on the accentual type, and accent in infinitive and present indicative:

Examples of this participle are:
* . (The parked car was stolen.) (perhaps better in the active voice, &quot;Parkiran avto so ukradli.&quot;)
* . (The court tried the accused robber.)
* . (A rested horse was waiting on the yard.)

=== Gerund ===
Gerund is formed by adding an ending to the past passive participle. Accent position is the same as in the passive participle and accent is the same as in long infinitive, except when on or , when it becomes (apart from some irregularities) circumflex and acute, respectively. Some can also be archaically accented on the last syllable with a short accent. There are also some irregular gerunds, such as .

Gerund is also split into two categories, but most verbs can have both (i. e. is not one or the other as is the case with participles). There is the true gerund (), which means an act of doing something, and objectified gerund (), which means a thing being acted upon. Not all verbs also have objectified gerund.

Gerund declines as a regular soft o-stem nouns following first neuter declension, but some can be singularia tantum.
=== Negative forms ===
Three verbs, , , and have special negative forms in present indicative:
=== Future indicative ===
Only verbs and have special future indicative forms. For , this is the only correct way (but is colloquially also conjugated as other verbs), while can also be conjugated as other verbs.
=== Conditional ===
Verb also has a special form when used as an auxiliary verb in conditional mood and is the same for all genders and persons: . Full lexical verb therefore still has an analytical form . In an affirmative sentence, it is not stressed, however its negative forms can be accented either on or on ( or ).

=== Aorist and imperfect ===
Standard Slovene lost both the aorist and the imperfect, which have been replaced by the preterite. These forms exist exclusively in the Resian dialect, but are slowly fading as well. In nowaday Resian, only the verbs (SS ) &quot;be&quot;, (SS ) &quot;give&quot;, (SS ) &quot;keep up with&quot;, (SS ), (SS ) &quot;be able&quot;, (SS ) &quot;come&quot;, and (SS ) &quot;want&quot; still have imperfective forms, others are considered obsolete.

Only a few verbs also have an aorist, and all of these forms are considered obsolete as they cannot be understood by most people anymore. There are only three such documented forms:

* (SS from ) &quot;(I) have gone&quot;
* (SS from ) &quot;(I) have come&quot;
* (SS from ) &quot;(you) have taken / (he/she/it) has taken&quot;
Aorist and imperfect have been in use in other dialects until the 15th century and vowel clusters in imperfect have already been contracted then.

== Analytical forms ==
Forms given here are in the way they appear in a typical sentence. However, in the dictionary form, lexical verb is first and then everything else, except in negative forms (e. g. → )

=== Active voice ===

==== Past indicative ====
The past (or preterite) indicative is used to indicate events that occurred in the past. Modern Slovene does not distinguish the past tense (&quot;saw&quot;) from the perfect tense (&quot;have seen&quot;); this distinction was common in Alpine Slovene when aorist served the past tense form.

It is formed with the auxiliary verb (to be) in the present tense, plus the l-participle of the verb. The participle must agree with the subject in number and gender. For example:

* (I saw, said by a male)
* (I saw, said by a female)
* (she went)
* (they discovered)

==== Pluperfect indicative ====
The pluperfect indicative is used to indicate an action that occurred before some other future action. It is rarely used in colloquial speech, where it is replaced by the past tense.

It is formed as though it were the past tense of the past tense: the auxiliary verb (to be) in the present tense, plus the l-participle of the verb (to be), plus the l-participle of the verb. The participles must agree with the subject in number and gender. For example:

* (I had seen, said by a male)
* (I had seen, said by a female)
* (she had gone)
* (they had discovered)

==== Future indicative ====
The future indicative tense is used to state events that will happen in the future.

The verb (to be) has its own unique set of future tense forms, with the stem . Other verbs are usually formed using in the future tense, plus the l-participle of the verb. The participle must agree with the subject in number and gender. For example:

* (I will see, said by a male)
* (I will see, said by a female)
* (she will go)
* (they will discover)
Dialectally, is used in future indicative as an auxiliary verb, followed by infinitive.

==== Conditional mood ====
The conditional mood is used to express desires, wishes, and hypothetical (often impossible) conditions.

The present conditional is formed using the special particle , plus the l-participle of the lexical verb. The past conditional is rarely used, like the pluperfect, and is formed analogously: the particle , plus l-participle of the verb (to be), plus the l-participle of the verb. Examples of the conditional mood are:

* . (Literally: &quot;If it became sick to me, to me, I kindly ask, pass those pills.&quot;; If I should become sick, kindly pass me those pills.)
* . (Should there be a fire, we would die.)
* . (If we had finished earlier, we would be free now.)
* . (He wishes that he were a model, but with his facial impurities, he has no chance.)
* (O, if only it were autumn!) (literary)
* (O, if only it were autumn!)
In the 18th century, future conditional was also rarely used, which was formed by &quot;bom&quot; &quot;bil&quot; + l-participle, e. g. &quot;&quot; (If I asked [in the future]). Such use has only been recorded to be in active voice.

==== Optative ====
An additional kind of imperative, which may be called the optative or hortative, is formed by using the particle () with the indicative or conditional. This acts as a substitute for the imperative in the third person and other tenses as well. It is usually not translated as &#x27;may&#x27;, because nowadays use is closer to the imperative, so a more appropriate word would be &#x27;should&#x27;. However, this kind of form has many uses, so it may also sometimes be translated as &#x27;let&#x27; or with passive voice.

* . (He should come to help me.)
* (Let it be your way.)
* (Let me tell you, how it happened.)
* (But let him be so tired, he reached the finish [line]).
* . (This process is thought to be caused by fungi.)

==== Negative forms ====
It is formed by simply adding in front of the verb, only is before. In dictionary forms, the lexical verbs is in last place, except where it combines with the auxiliary verb:

* (Noone asked us.)(lit. Noone has not asked us.)
* (I would not like to meet him.)
* . (It is better not to work than to do (lit. work) harm.)
* . (I have not worked any less than others.)

=== Passive &amp; reflexive voice ===
The passive voice is formed using the passive past participle of the verb and auxiliary verbs. Reflexive voice is formed by turning a verb into a reflexive verb, by adding the reflexive pronoun to the verb. Passive and reflexive voice is formed as shown in this table:

An example of the passive voice is:

* (He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society).

However, this is more commonly stated using the active voice with an impersonal form of the third person plural (like English &quot;impersonal they&quot;):

* (They elected him a fellow of the Royal Society).

<doc id="1301655" wikidata="Q2061130" url="?curid=1301655" title="Toyota JZ engine">
<text>The Toyota JZ engine family is a series of inline-6 automobile engines produced by Toyota. As a replacement for the M-series inline-6 engines, the JZ engines were 24-valve DOHC engines in 2.5- and 3.0-litre versions.

== 1JZ ==
The 1JZ version was produced from 1990 to 2007 (last sold in the Mark II Blit Wagon and Crown Athlete). Cylinder bore and stroke is . It is a 24-valve DOHC engine with two belt-driven camshafts and a dual-stage intake manifold.

=== 1JZ-GE ===
The 1JZ-GE is a common version, with a 10:1 compression ratio. Output for the early non-turbo, non-VVT-i (1990–1996) 1JZ-GE was at 6000 rpm and at 4800 rpm. VVT-i variable valve timing was added in 1995, for an output of at 6000 rpm and at 4000 rpm.

The exterior design of the 1JZ-GE would later be reused with the 2JZ-GE in 1991, which shared most of its parts with the 1JZ-GE. The non-turbo, non-VVT-i 1JZ-GE is a non-interference engine.

Applications:
* Mark II
* Chaser
* Cresta
* Crown
* Soarer
* Progres 

Like all JZ-series engines, the early 1JZ-GE is designed for longitudinal mounting and rear-wheel-drive. All of these models only came with a 4-speed automatic transmission; no manual gearbox option was offered.

=== 1JZ-GTE ===

The 1JZ-GTE is a twin-turbocharged version of the 1JZ, produced from 1990 to 2007. The first generation 1JZ-GTE employs twin CT12A turbochargers arranged in parallel and blowing through a side-mount or front mount air-to-air intercooler. With an 8.5:1 static compression ratio, the factory quoted power and torque outputs are at 6200 rpm and at 4800 rpm. The bore and stroke are the same as for the 1JZ-GE: bore × stroke is . In 1991, the 1JZ-GTE was slotted into the all-new Soarer GT.

The early generation 1JZ-GTEs combined the inherent smoothness of an inline 6-cylinder engine with the revving capacity of its short stroke and early power delivery of its small, ceramic wheeled turbochargers. The ceramic turbine wheels are prone to delamination in the setting of high impeller rpm and local temperature conditions, usually a result of higher boost. The first generation 1JZs were even more prone to turbo failure due to there being a faulty one-way valve on the head, specifically on the intake cam cover causing blow-by gases to go into the intake manifold. On the exhaust side, a decent amount of oil vapor flows into the turbos causing premature wear on the seals. The later second generation engines had this problem fixed. In Japan, there was a recall made in order to repair the first generation engines, however this does not apply to 1JZs imported into other countries. 

The third generation of the 1JZ-GTE was introduced around 1996, still as a 2.5-litre turbo, but with Toyota&#x27;s BEAMS architecture. This included a reworked head, newly developed continuously variable valve timing mechanism (VVT-i), modified water jackets for improved cylinder cooling and newly developed shims with a titanium nitride coating for reduced cam friction. The turbo setup changed from parallel twin turbo (CT12A x2) to a single turbo (CT15B). The single turbo is in part made more efficient by the use of smaller exhaust ports in the head, this allows the escaping exhaust gasses to have more velocity as they exit the head, which in turn, spools the turbo faster and at lower RPM.The adoption of VVT-i and the improved cylinder cooling allowed the compression ratio to be increased from 8.5:1 to 9.0:1. Even though the official power figures remained at at 6200 rpm, torque was increased by to at 3200 rpm. These improvements resulted in increased engine efficiency that reduced fuel consumption by 10%. The adoption of VVTi, a much higher efficiency single turbocharger than the twins as well as different manifold and exhaust ports were responsible for most of the 50% torque increase at low engine speeds. This engine was used primarily in Toyota&#x27;s X chassis cars (Chaser, Mark II, Cresta, Verossa, Blit), the Crown Athlete V (JZS171) and in the later JZZ30 Soarer, as the JZA70 Supra had long been discontinued at this time.

Applications:
* Toyota Chaser/Cresta/Mark II 2.5GT Twin Turbo (JZX81)
* Toyota Chaser/Cresta/Mark II Tourer V/Roulant G (JZX90, JZX100)
* Toyota Mark II iR-V (JZX110)
* Toyota Mark II Blit iR-V (JZX110W)
* Toyota Soarer 2.5 GT-T(JZZ30)
* Toyota Supra MK III 2.5 Twin Turbo (R) (JZA70)
* Toyota Verossa VR25 (JZX110)
* Toyota Crown Athlete V (JZS171 sedan and JZS171W wagon)

=== 1JZ-FSE ===
Around 2000, Toyota introduced what are quite probably the least-recognized members of the JZ engine family: the FSE direct injection variants. These FSE 1JZ and 2JZ engines are aimed at achieving minimal emissions and fuel consumption together with no loss of performance.

The 2.5-litre 1JZ-FSE employs the same block as the conventional 1JZ-GE; however, the design of the cylinder head is unique.
The ‘D4’ FSE employs a relatively narrow angle cylinder head with swirl control valves that serve to improve combustion efficiency.
This is necessary to run at extremely lean air-fuel ratios around 20 to 40:1 at certain engine load and revs. Not surprisingly, fuel consumption is reduced by around 20 percent (when tested in the Japanese 10/15 urban mode). Normal unleaded fuel is enough to cope with the FSE&#x27;s 11:1 compression ratio.

The direct injection version of the 1JZ generates and – virtually the same as the conventional VVT-i 1JZ-GE. The 1JZ-FSE is always used with an automatic transmission.

Applications:
*Mark II
*Mark II Blit
*Brevis
*Progres
*Verossa
*Crown

== 2JZ ==
The 2JZ was produced from 1991 (first released in the 1991 Toyota Aristo) to 2007. Cylinder bore and stroke is . VVT-i variable valve timing was first introduced in 1995 starting with the 2JZ-GE, but did not come to the 2JZ-GTE and the US-market 2JZ-GE engines until mid-1997 for the 1998 model year onwards. This engine is not merely a stroked version of the 1JZ (although they share a common bore size, bore pitch, and general architecture), but has a taller block deck and longer connecting rods to accommodate the stroke increase.

=== 2JZ-GE ===
The 2JZ-GE is a common version. Output is at 5800 to 6000 rpm and of torque at 4800 to 5800 rpm.

It uses Sequential Electronic Fuel Injection, has an aluminium head and 4 valves per cylinder, along with a cast-iron cylinder block. VVT-i was first introduced to the engines in 1995. The VVT-i version also featured DIS as opposed to the traditional distributor set-up previously seen on the 1JZ-GE. Despite the common misconception, it was not a true COP (Coil-On-Plug, also known as Plug-top coil) ignition system, instead relying on one coil to fire two cylinders, one of which was by spark plug wire.

Applications:
* Toyota Altezza AS 300/Lexus IS 300
* Toyota Aristo/Lexus GS 300
* Toyota Crown/Crown Majesta
* Toyota Mark II/Chaser/Cresta
*Toyota Origin
* Toyota Progres
* Toyota Soarer/Lexus SC 300
* Toyota Supra

=== 2JZ-GTE ===
The 2JZ-GTE is an inline-layout, six-cylinder, belt-driven dual overhead camshaft, air-intercooled, twin-turbocharged, cast-iron block, aluminium cylinder head engine designed and manufactured by Toyota that was produced from 1991 to 2002 in Japan. It originally powered the Toyota Aristo V (JZS147) in 1991 before becoming Toyota&#x27;s flagship performance engine in the Toyota Supra RZ (JZA80) in 1993.

Development and evolution of the engine was, principally, a response to Nissan&#x27;s relatively new and then-successful RB26DETT engine, which had achieved much success in FIA Group A and Group N touring car championships.

Its mechanical basis was of the existing 2JZ-GE, but differed in its use of sequential twin turbochargers and an air-to-air side-mounted intercooler. The engine block, crankshaft, and connecting rods of the Supra&#x27;s 2JZ-GE and 2JZ-GTE are the same, with notable differences being that the 2JZ-GTE has recessed piston tops (giving a lower compression ratio), oil spray nozzles to aid in cooling the pistons and a different head (redesigned inlet/exhaust ports, cams and valves). Toyota&#x27;s VVT-i variable valve timing technology was added to the engine beginning in September 1997, and hence it phased out production of the original engine in Japan. Consequently, maximum torque and horsepower was raised for engines selling in all markets. The later 2JZ-GE VVT-i equipped models (Aristo, Altezza and Mark II) shared a different part number for weaker connecting rods.

The addition of twin turbochargers, jointly developed by Toyota with Hitachi, in sequential configuration had raised its commercially cited output from to the contemporary industry maximum of at 5800 rpm. In its first appearance, torque was advertised as at 3800 rpm to be later recited as with the introduction of VVT-i in production year 1997. The mutually agreed, industry-wide output ceiling was enforced by Japan&#x27;s now-defunct Gentlemen&#x27;s Agreement exclusively between Japanese automakers selling to the Japanese domestic market. Engine power in the North American and European markets, as documented by Toyota, was increased to at 6000 rpm.

The export version of the 2JZ-GTE achieved its higher power output with the use of newer stainless steel turbochargers (ceramic for Japanese models), revised camshafts, and larger injectors (550 cc/min for export, 440 cc/min for Japanese). The mechanical similarities between the Japanese-specification CT20 turbine and export-specification CT12B turbine allow interchangeability of the exhaust-side propeller shaft. Additionally, the export-exclusive CT12B turbine received more durable turbine housings and stainless steel turbine and impeller fins. Multiple variants of the Japanese CT20 turbine exist discretely, which are identified with the B, R, and A part number suffixes (e.g.: CT20A).

For all road car applications, two gearboxes were available for the engine:
*Toyota A340E 4-speed automatic
*Toyota V160 and V161 6-speed manual (jointly developed with Getrag as the Type 233)

Applications:
* Toyota Aristo 3.0V JZS147 (Japan-only)
* Toyota Aristo V300 JZS161 (Japan-only)
* Toyota Supra RZ/Turbo JZA80

=== 2JZ-FSE ===
Around 2000, Toyota introduced what are quite probably the least-recognized members of the JZ engine family: the FSE direct injection variants. These FSE 1JZ and 2JZ engines are aimed at achieving minimal emissions and fuel consumption together with no loss of performance.

The 3.0-litre 2JZ-FSE uses the same direct injection principle as the smaller 1JZ-FSE but runs an even higher 11.3:1 compression ratio. This engine features narrow angle cylinder heads with swirl control valves improving combustion efficiency (similar to the 1JZ-FSE) and weighs about . The 2JZ-FSE matches the conventional VVT-i 2JZ-GE with and of torque. The 2JZ-FSE is always used with an automatic transmission.

Applications:
*Toyota Brevis
*Toyota Progres
*Toyota Crown (S170)
*Toyota Crown Majesta (S170)

<text>Corylus maxima, the filbert, is a species of hazel in the birch family Betulaceae, native to southeastern Europe and southwestern Asia.

== Description ==
It is a deciduous shrub tall, with stems up to thick. The leaves are rounded, long by broad, with a coarsely double-serrated margin. The flowers are wind-pollinated catkins produced in late winter; the male (pollen) catkins are pale yellow, long, while the female catkins are bright red and only long. The fruit is a nut produced in clusters of 1–5 together; each nut is long, fully enclosed in a long, tubular involucre (husk).

=== Similar species ===

The filbert is similar to the related common hazel, &quot;C. avellana&quot;, differing in having the nut more fully enclosed by the tubular involucre. This feature is shared by the beaked hazel &quot;C. cornuta&quot; of North America, and the Asian beaked hazel &quot;C. sieboldiana&quot; of eastern Asia.

==Distribution and habitat==
The species is native to southeastern Europe and southwestern Asia, from the Balkans to Ordu in Turkey.

==Uses==
The filbert nut is edible, and is very similar to the hazelnut (cobnut). Its main use in the United States is as large filler (along with peanuts as small filler) in most containers of mixed nuts. Filberts are sometimes grown in orchards for the nuts, but much less often than the common hazel.

The purple-leaved cultivar &quot;C. maxima&quot; &#x27;Purpurea&#x27; is a popular ornamental shrub in gardens.
==Name==
In Oregon, &quot;filbert&quot; is used for commercial hazelnuts in general. Use in this manner has faded partly due to the efforts of Oregon&#x27;s hazelnut growers to brand their product to better appeal to global markets and avoid confusion.

The etymology for &#x27;filbert&#x27; may trace to Norman French. Saint Philibert&#x27;s feast day is 20 August (old style) and the plant was possibly renamed after him because the nuts were mature on this day.

<doc id="1301663" wikidata="Q542866" url="?curid=1301663" title="Maqbool">
<text>Maqbool is a 2003 Indian Hindi-language crime drama film directed by Vishal Bhardwaj, starring Irrfan Khan, Tabu, Pankaj Kapur, Naseeruddin Shah, Om Puri, Piyush Mishra, Murali Sharma, and Masumeh Makhija in an adaptation of the play &quot;Macbeth&quot; by Shakespeare.

The plot of the film is based on that of &quot;Macbeth&quot; with regard to events and characterisation. The film did not perform remarkably at the box office, but won director Vishal Bhardwaj international acclaim. Apart from directing it, he had also composed the background score and songs for the film. Bhardwaj then moved on to adapting William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot; in his 2006 film &quot;Omkara&quot; which won him further critical success. He then directed &quot;Haider&quot; in 2014 adapting &quot;Hamlet&quot;, leading to what is now called his &quot;Shakespeare trilogy&quot;.

The film had its North American premiere at the 2003 Toronto International Film Festival. Though the film failed to garner much of an audience during its theatrical run in India, critics were appreciative and Pankaj Kapur went on to win a Filmfare Award for Best Actor (Critics) and a National Film Award for Best Supporting Actor. The film was screened in the Marché du Film section of the 2004 Cannes Film Festival.

==Plot==
The film is based on William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;, with the Mumbai underworld as its backdrop. Miyan Maqbool (Irrfan Khan) is the right-hand man of Jahangir Khan (alias Abba Ji) (Pankaj Kapur), a powerful underworld don. Maqbool is grateful and feels a close connection and personal indebtedness to Abba Ji. Seeing their close relationship but also sensing Maqbool&#x27;s ambition, two corrupt policemen (Om Puri and Naseeruddin Shah) predict that Maqbool will soon take over the reins of the Mumbai Underworld from Abba Ji. 

Nimmi (Tabu) is Abba Ji&#x27;s mistress, but she and Maqbool are secretly in love. Nimmi encourages Maqbool&#x27;s ambitions and persuades him to kill Abba Ji to take over as Don. Maqbool is torn between his love for Nimmi and his loyalty to Abba Ji, but he begins to prepare the ground for becoming a Don by ensuring that others in the line of succession cannot interfere. Finally, Maqbool murders Abba Ji in cold blood while he is in bed at night, with Nimmi next to him. Maqbool gets away with the murder and takes over as Don, just as planned, but both he and Nimmi are haunted by guilt, seeing Abba Ji&#x27;s ghost and unable to wash the blood from their hands. There is also suspicion, within the gang, of Maqbool&#x27;s role in the death of Abba Ji, and eventually the lovers meet a tragic end.

In addition to the portrayals of the three tragic heroes, the film offers performances by supporting cast members, in particular Om Puri and Naseeruddin Shah. The two open the film in their roles as black comic relief corrupt police inspectors-cum-astrologers, predicting the fall of Abba Ji—who has them on his payroll—and the rise and fall of Maqbool. Contrary to the original play, the corrupt cops are not just passive soothsayers. In an effort to sustain what they refer to as &quot;balancing forces,&quot; they are also actively involved in shaping events, like aiding in providing information to Abba Ji&#x27;s enforcers to wipe out a rival gang, using subtle nuances in coercing Maqbool to shift loyalties, deliberately botching an &quot;encounter&quot; attempt on Riyaz Boti (Macduff) and subsequently setting up an alliance between a rival politician (the incumbent one was backed by Abba Ji) and a fleeing Guddu (Fleance) and Riyaz Boti against Maqbool.

== Cast ==
== Production ==
Irrfan Khan was selected to portray the lead role after attempts to sign Kamal Haasan, Akshay Kumar and Kay Kay Menon failed. In 2023, Vishal Bhardwaj revealed that the team had reached advanced discussions with Kamal Haasan, but the actor wanted the film to be a bilingual shot in Tamil and Hindi, with separate actors brought in for the Tamil version. Vishal Bharadwaj was unwilling to compromise on making the film just in Hindi, with Naseeruddin Shah also noting his reluctance to work with Kamal Haasan.

==Reception==
&quot;Maqbool&quot; received universal critical acclaim. &quot;Rediff&quot; described the film as &quot;a visual gallery that is an intelligent blend of dark, tragic overtones and comic, satirical undertones&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that while the visuals are great, audiences might need an understanding of Macbeth to fully enjoy the film. &quot;India Today&quot; described it as a &quot;haunting operatic tragedy&quot;. &quot;Outlook&quot; said that it &quot;effectively transported the essence of the story to the milieu of the Bombay underworld of our times&quot;. &quot;Deccan Herald&quot; described the film as &quot;Brooding, tragic and brilliant. &#x27;Maqbool&#x27; with its undertones is cinema at its best&quot;.

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack features eleven songs composed by Vishal Bhardwaj with lyrics by Gulzar.

<text>Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) is a European Union regulation dating from 18 December 2006, amended on 16 December 2008 by Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008. REACH addresses the production and use of chemical substances, and their potential impacts on both human health and the environment. Its 849 pages took seven years to pass, and it has been described as the most complex legislation in the Union&#x27;s history and the most important in 20 years. It is the strictest law to date regulating chemical substances and will affect industries throughout the world. REACH entered into force on 1 June 2007, with a phased implementation over the next decade. The regulation also established the European Chemicals Agency, which manages the technical, scientific and administrative aspects of REACH.

==Overview==
When REACH is fully in force, it will require all companies manufacturing or importing chemical substances into the European Union in quantities of one tonne or more per year to register these substances with a new European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) in , Finland. Since REACH applies to some substances that are contained in objects (&quot;articles&quot; in REACH terminology), any company importing goods into Europe could be affected.

The European Chemicals Agency has set three major deadlines for registration of chemicals. In general these are determined by tonnage manufactured or imported, with 1000 tonnes/a. being required to be registered by 1 December 2010, 100 tonnes/a. by 1 June 2013 and 1 tonne/a. by 1 June 2018. In addition, chemicals of higher concern or toxicity also have to meet the 2010 deadline.

About 143,000 chemical substances marketed in the European Union were pre-registered by the 1 December 2008 deadline. Although pre-registering was not mandatory, it allows potential registrants much more time before they have to fully register. Supply of substances to the European market which have not been pre-registered or registered is illegal (known in REACH as &quot;no data, no market&quot;).

REACH also addresses the continued use of chemical &quot;substances of very high concern&quot; (SVHC) because of their potential negative impacts on human health or the environment. From 1 June 2011, the European Chemicals Agency must be notified of the presence of SVHCs in articles if the total quantity used is more than one tonne per year and the SVHC is present at more than 0.1% of the mass of the object. Some uses of SVHCs may be subject to prior authorisation from the European Chemicals Agency, and applicants for authorisation will have to include plans to replace the use of the SVHC with a safer alternative (or, if no safer alternative exists, the applicant must work to find one) – known as &quot;substitution&quot;. , there were 219 SVHCs on the candidate list for authorization.

REACH applies to all chemicals imported or produced in the EU. The European Chemicals Agency will manage the technical, scientific and administrative aspects of the REACH system.

To somewhat simplify the registration of the 143,000 substances and to limit vertebrate animal testing as far as possible, substance information exchange forums (SIEFs) are formed amongst legal entities (such as manufacturers, importers, and data holders) who are dealing with the same substance. This allows them to join forces and finances to create 1 registration dossier. However, this creates a series of new problems as a SIEF is the cooperation between sometimes a thousand legal entities that did not know each other at all before but suddenly must:
*find each other and start communicating openly and honestly
*start sharing data
*start sharing costs in a fair and transparent way
*democratically and in full consensus take the most complex decisions
in order to complete a several thousand end points dossier in a limited time.

The European Commission supports businesses affected by REACH by handing out – free of charge – a software application (IUCLID) that simplifies capturing, managing, and submitting data on chemical properties and effects. Such submission is a mandatory part of the registration process. Under certain circumstances the performance of a chemical safety assessment (CSA) is mandatory and a chemical safety report (CSR) assuring the safe use of the substance has to be submitted with the dossier. Dossier submission is done using the web-based software REACH-IT.

The aim of REACH is to improve the protection of human health and the environment by identification of the intrinsic properties of chemical substances. At the same time, innovative capability and competitiveness of the EU chemicals industry should be enhanced.

==Background==
The European Commission&#x27;s (EC) White Paper of 2001 on a &#x27;future chemical strategy&#x27; proposed a system that requires chemicals manufactured in quantities of greater than 1 tonne to be &#x27;registered&#x27;, those manufactured in quantities greater than 100 tonnes to be &#x27;evaluated&#x27;, and certain substances of high concern (for example carcinogenic, mutagenic and toxic to reproduction – CMRs) to be &#x27;authorised&#x27;.

The EC adopted its proposal for a new scheme to manage the manufacture, importation and supply of chemicals in Europe on in October 2003. This proposal eventually became law once the European Parliament officially approved its final text of REACH. It came into force on 1 June 2007.

==Requirements==
One of the major elements of the REACH regulation is the requirement to communicate information on chemicals up and down the supply chain. This ensures that manufacturers, importers, and also their customers are aware of information relating to health and safety of the products supplied. For many retailers the obligation to provide information about substances in their products within 45 days of receipt of a request from a consumer is particularly challenging. Having detailed information on the substances present in their products will allow retailers to work with the manufacturing base to substitute or remove potentially harmful substances from products. The list of harmful substances is continuously growing and requires organizations to constantly monitor any announcements and additions to the REACH scope. This can be done on the European Chemicals Agency&#x27;s website.

===Registration===
A requirement is to collect, collate and submit data to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) on the hazardous properties of all substances (except Polymers and non-isolated intermediates) manufactured or imported into the EU in quantities above 1 tonne per year. Certain substances of high concern, such as carcinogenic, mutagenic and reproductive toxic substances (CMRs) will have to be authorised.

Chemicals will be registered in three phases according to the tonnage of the substance evaluation:

More than 1000 tonnes a year, or substances of highest concern, must be registered in the first 3 years;

100–1000 tonnes a year must be registered in the first 6 years;

1–100 tonnes a year must be registered in the first 11 years.

In addition, industry should prepare risk assessments and provide controls measures for using the substance safely to downstream users.

===Evaluation===
Evaluation provides a means for the authorities to require registrants, and in very limited cases downstream users, to provide further information.

There are two types of evaluation: dossier evaluation and substance evaluation:

Dossier evaluation is conducted by authorities to examine proposals for testing to ensure that unnecessary animal tests and costs are avoided, and to check the compliance of registration dossier with the registration requirements. Chemical companies failed to provide &quot;important safety information&quot; in nearly three quarters (74% or 211 of 286) of cases checked by authorities, according to the European Chemicals Agency&#x27;s 2018 annual progress report. “The numbers show a similar picture to previous years,&quot; it said. Industry group Cefic acknowledged the problem.

Substance evaluation is performed by the relevant authorities when there is a reason to suspect that a substance presents a risk to human health or the environment (e.g. because of its structural similarity to another substance). Therefore, all registration dossiers submitted for a substance are examined together and any other available information is taken into account.

Substance evaluation is carried out under a programme known as the Community Rolling Action Plan (CoRAP). An independent review of progress by national officials published in late 2018 found that 352 substances have so far been prioritised for substance evaluation with 94 completed. For almost half the 94, officials concluded that existing commercial use of the substance is unsafe for human health and/or the environment. Risk management has been initiated for twelve substances since REACH came into force. For 74% of substances (34 out of 46), concerns were demonstrated, but no actual regulatory follow-up has yet been initiated. In addition, national officials concluded that 64% of the substances under evaluation (126 out of 196) lacked the information needed to demonstrate the safety of the chemicals marketed in Europe due to inadequate industry data.

===Authorisation===
 REACH allows restricted substances of very high concern to continue being used, subject to authorisation.

This authorisation requirement attempts to ensure that risks from the use of such substances are either adequately controlled or justified by socio-economic grounds, having taken into account the available information on alternative substances or processes.

The Regulation enables restrictions of use to be introduced across the European Community where this is shown to be necessary. Member States or the Commission may prepare such proposals.

By March 2019, authorisation had been granted 185 times, with no eligible request ever having been rejected. NGOs have complained that authorisations have been granted despite safer alternatives existing and that this was hindering substitution. In March 2019, the European Court of Justice revoked an authorisation in a ruling that criticised the European Chemicals Agency for failing to identify a safer alternative.

===Information exchange===
Manufactures and importers should develop risk reduction measures for all known uses of the chemical including downstream uses. Downstream users such as plastic pipe producers should provide detail of their uses to their suppliers. In cases where downstream users decide not to disclose this information, they need to have their own CSR.

==History==
REACH is the product of a wide-ranging overhaul of EU chemical policy. It passed the first reading in the European Parliament on 17 November 2005, and the Council of Ministers reached a political agreement for a common position on 13 December 2005. The European Parliament approved REACH on 13 December 2006 and the Council of Ministers formally adopted it on 18 December 2006. Weighing up expenditure versus profit has always been a significant issue, with the estimated cost of compliance being around €5 billion over 11 years, and the assumed health benefits of saved billions of euro in healthcare costs. However, there have been different studies on the estimated cost which vary considerably in the outcome. It came into force on 20 January 2009, and will be fully implemented by 2015.

A separate regulation – the CLP Regulation (for &quot;Classification, Labelling, Packaging&quot;) – implements the United Nations Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS) and will steadily replace the previous Dangerous Substances Directive and Dangerous Preparations Directive.

The REACH regulation was amended in April 2018 to include specific information requirements for nanomaterials.

In the European Green Deal of 2020, a commitment was made to update the REACH regulation to ban between 7,000 and 12,000 toxic substances in all consumer products, except where truly essential. The goal was among the priorities of the European Commission, but is in danger of being radically revised due to lobbying by the EU chemical industry and the positions taken by the European People&#x27;s Party.

==Rationale==
The legislation was proposed under dual reasoning: protection of human health and protection of the environment.

Using potentially toxic substances (such as phthalates or brominated flame retardants) is deemed undesirable and REACH will force the use of certain substances to be phased out. Using potentially toxic substances in products other than those ingested by humans (such as electronic devices) may seem to be safe, but there are several ways in which chemicals can enter the human body and the environment. Substances can leave particles during consumer use, for example into the air where they can be inhaled or ingested. Even where they might not do direct harm to humans, they can contaminate the air or water, and can enter the food chain through plants, fish or other animals. According to the European Commission, little safety information exists for 99 percent of the tens of thousands of chemicals placed on the market before 1981. There were 100,106 chemicals in use in the EU in 1981, when the last survey was performed. Of these only 3,000 have been tested and over 800 are known to be carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction. These are listed in the Annex 1 of the Dangerous Substances Directive (now Annex VI of the CLP Regulation).

Continued use of many toxic chemicals is sometimes justified because &quot;at very low levels they are not a concern to health&quot;. However, many of these substances may bioaccumulate in the human body, thus reaching dangerous concentrations. They may also chemically react with one another, producing new substances with new risks.

==In non-EU countries==
A number of countries outside of the European Union have started to implement REACH regulations or are in the process of adopting such a regulatory framework to approach a more globalized system of chemicals registration under the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS).
Balkan countries such as Croatia and Serbia are in the process of adopting the EU REACH system under the auspices of the EU IPA programme. Switzerland has moved towards implementation of REACH through partial revision of the Swiss Chemical Ordinance on February 1, 2009. The new Chemicals Management Regulation in Turkey is paving the way for the planned adoption of REACH in 2013. China has moved towards a more efficient and coherent system for the control of chemicals in compliance with GHS.

In the UK, the government announced a &quot;UK REACH&quot; that the UK&#x27;s Chemical Industry Association described as a &quot;hugely expensive duplication&quot; of the EU&#x27;s safety data. The new regulations were to be enforced from October 2021 but deferred to October 2023, and then to October 2025. Following industry representations, the responsible Minister announced &quot;that officials would now explore &#x27;a new model&#x27; for UK REACH registrations that would look to &#x27;reduce the need for replicating EU Reach data packages&#x27;&quot;. In March 2021, a group of more than 20 leading UK organisations, including the CHEM Trust and Breast Cancer UK, &quot;rejected industry proposals to streamline UK Reach as a &#x27;major weakening&#x27; of the envisaged post-Brexit regime&quot;.

==Controversy==
Over a decade after REACH came into force, progress has been slow. Of the 100,000 chemicals used in Europe today, “only a small fraction has been thoroughly evaluated by authorities regarding their health and environmental properties and impacts, and even fewer are actually regulated,” according to a report for the European Commission.

Apart from the potential costs to industry and the complexity of the new law, REACH has also attracted concern because of animal testing. Animal tests on vertebrates are now required but allowed only once per each new substance and if suitable alternatives cannot be used. If a company pays for such tests, it must sell the rights of the results for a &quot;reasonable&quot; price, which is not defined. There are additional concerns that access to the necessary information may prove very costly for potential registrants needing to purchase it.

On 8 June 2006, the REACH proposal was criticized by non-EU countries, including the United States, India and Brazil, which stated that the bill would hamper global trade.

The cosmetics company Lush were critical of the legislation when it was first proposed in 2006, as they believed it would increase animal testing. The cosmetics company wrote to its European customers and also ran an in-store marketing campaign, asking for postcards objecting to the legislation be sent to MEPs, a move which resulted in 80,000 Lush customers sending postcards. In December 2006, Lush protested outside the European Parliament in Strasbourg, by dumping horse manure outside the building.

An opinion in &quot;Nature&quot; in 2009 by Thomas Hartung and Constanza Rovida estimated that 54 million vertebrate animals would be used under REACH and that the costs would amount to €9.5 billion, set against the annual European industry annual turnover of €507 billion. Hartung is the former head of European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM). In a news release, ECHA criticised assumptions made by Hartung and Rovida; ECHA&#x27;s alternative assumptions reduced sixfold the number of animals.

==Only representative services==
Only representatives are EU-based entities that must comply with REACH (Article 8) and should operate standard, transparent working practices. The Only Representative assumes responsibility and liability for fulfilling obligations of importers in accordance with REACH for substances being brought into the EU by a non-EU manufacturer.

Non-EU consultancies offer &quot;only representative&quot; services, though according to REACH it is not possible to register a substance if your &quot;only representative&quot; consultancy company is not based in the EU, unless it is subcontracted to an EU-based registrant.

The SIEFs will bring new challenges. An article in the business news service Chemical Watch described how some &quot;pre-registrants&quot; may simply be consultants hoping for work (&quot;gold diggers&quot;) while others may be aiming to charge exorbitant rates for the data they have to offer (&quot;jackals&quot;).

==Authorisation List==
The European Chemical Agency (ECHA) has published the REACH Authorisation List, in an effort to tighten the use of Substances of Very High Concern (SVHCs). The list is an official recommendation from the ECHA to the European Commission. The list is also regularly updated and expanded. Currently the Candidate List for Authorisation comprises a total of 233 SVHCs (see ECHA list at https://echa.europa.eu/candidate-list-table), some of which are already active on the Authorization List.

To sell or use these substances, manufacturers, importers, and retailers in the European Union (EU) must apply for authorization from the ECHA. The applicant is to submit a chemical safety report on the risks entailed by the substance, as well as an analysis of possible alternative substances or technologies including present and future research and development processed.

<doc id="1301678" wikidata="Q651685" url="?curid=1301678" title="Supply shock">
<text>A supply shock is an event that suddenly increases or decreases the supply of a commodity or service, or of commodities and services in general. This sudden change affects the equilibrium price of the good or service or the economy&#x27;s general price level.

In the short run, an economy-wide negative supply shock will shift the aggregate supply curve leftward, decreasing the output and increasing the price level. For example, the imposition of an embargo on trade in oil would cause an adverse supply shock, since oil is a key factor of production for a wide variety of goods. A supply shock can cause stagflation due to a combination of rising prices and falling output. The 1973 Oil Crisis is often used as the exemplar case of a supply shock, when OPEC restrictions on production and sale of petroleum resulted in fuel shortages throughout the developed world. 

In the short run, an economy-wide positive supply shock will shift the aggregate supply curve rightward, increasing output and decreasing the price level. A positive supply shock could be an advance in technology (a technology shock) which makes production more efficient, thus increasing output.

== Technical analysis ==
The slope of a demand curve determines how much the price level and output respond to the shock, with more inelastic demand (and hence a steeper demand curve) causing there to be a larger effect on the price level and a smaller effect on quantity.

<doc id="1301686" wikidata="Q908682" url="?curid=1301686" title="Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976">
<text>The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) is a United States law, passed by the Congress in 1976 and administered by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), that regulates chemicals not regulated by other U.S. federal statutes, including chemicals already in commerce and the introduction of new chemicals. When the TSCA was put into place, all existing chemicals were considered to be safe for use and subsequently grandfathered in. Its three main objectives are to assess and regulate new commercial chemicals before they enter the market, to regulate chemicals already existing in 1976 that posed an &quot;unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment&quot;, as for example PCBs, lead, mercury and radon, and to regulate these chemicals&#x27; distribution and use.

Contrary to what the name implies, TSCA does not separate chemicals into categories of toxic and non-toxic. Rather it prohibits the manufacture or importation of chemicals that are not on the TSCA Inventory or subject to one of many exemptions. Chemicals listed on the inventory are referred to as &quot;existing chemicals&quot;, while chemicals not listed are referred to as new chemicals. The act defines the term &quot;chemical substance&quot; as &quot;any organic or inorganic substance of a particular molecular identity, including any combination of these substances occurring in whole or in part as a result of a chemical reaction or occurring in nature, and any element or uncombined radical&quot; although TSCA excludes chemicals regulated by other federal statutes from the definition of a chemical substance. 

Generally, manufacturers must submit premanufacturing notification to EPA prior to manufacturing or importing new chemicals for commerce. Exceptions include foods, food additives, drugs, cosmetics or devices regulated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, pesticides regulated by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, tobacco and tobacco products regulated by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, substances used only in small quantities for research and development under Section 5(h)(3), and radioactive materials and wastes regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. EPA reviews new chemical notifications and if it finds an &quot;unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment,&quot; it may regulate the substance from limiting uses or production volume to outright banning it. In 2016, the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act was the first major overhaul in many years.

== Overview==
The Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976 mandated the EPA to protect the public from &quot;unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment&quot; by regulating the manufacture, processing, distribution, use, sale, and disposal of chemicals. This act does not address pollution, which is regulated through the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Instead, like FIFRA (the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act), TSCA regulates commercial products. The act gave the EPA the authority to gather information on and require manufacturers (and importers) to test products, required the EPA to create a listing of existing chemicals and the industry to notify EPA of new chemicals being produced, and gave the EPA the ability to regulate chemical production and use. For example, in 2019 EPA banned the use of methylene chloride in consumer paint and coating removal products.

The types of chemicals regulated by the act fall into two broad categories: existing and new. The distinction is made because the act regulates the two categories of chemicals in different ways. Existing chemicals include any chemical currently listed on the TSCA Inventory under TSCA section 8(b). New chemicals are defined as &quot;any chemical substance which is not included in the chemical substance list compiled and published under section 8(b).&quot; This list included all chemical substances manufactured or imported into the United States prior to December 1979, which covered 99% of the EPA&#x27;s mandate in the bill, including some 8,800 chemicals imported or produced at quantities above 10,000 pounds.

=== Sections ===
The TSCA is found in United States law at Title 15 of the United States Code, Chapter 53, and administered by EPA.

*Title of the TSCA, &quot;Control of Toxic Substances,&quot; is the original substance of the 1976 act, establishes the core program, including regulation of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) products and bans certain activities with respect to elemental mercury.
*Title II, &quot;Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response,&quot; authorizes the EPA to set standards for asbestos abatement in schools, and requires asbestos contractors to be trained and certified, enacted in 1986 under PL 99-519 and amended in 1990 under PL 101-637.
*Title III, &quot;Indoor Radon Abatement,&quot; requires the EPA to publish a guide about radon health risks and to perform studies of radon levels in schools and federal buildings, enacted in 1988 under PL 100-551.
*Title IV, &quot;Lead Exposure Reduction&quot; requires the EPA to identify sources of lead contamination in the environment to regulate amounts of lead allowed in products, including paint and toys, and to establish state programs that monitor and reduce lead exposures, enacted in 1992 under PL 102-550.

U.S. regulations implementing the TSCA are in 40 CFR Part 195 for radon, and in 40 CFR Parts 700 through 766 for other matters.

Under 15 USC 2605(e) the TSCA specifically regulates PCBs. Subsection (2)(A) provides that after January 1, 1978, &quot;no person may manufacture, process or distribute in commerce or use any PCB in any manner other than in a totally enclosed manner.&quot; It also authorizes the EPA to regulate PCBs disposal.

Acting under the TSCA and other laws, the EPA has set limits for PCB contamination of the environment. It has engaged in protracted negotiations with the U.S. General Electric company and other firms for remediation of sites contaminated with PCBs such as the upper Hudson River.

== History ==
The TSCA was passed by the Congress and signed into law by President Gerald Ford on October 11, 1976 after years of negotiation between the government and chemical producers. A bill was first introduced in Congress in 1971, but it was opposed by industry and environmental groups, leading to a five-year stalemate. TSCA authorized the EPA to regulate new and existing chemicals. TSCA was in response to Congress&#x27; growing concerns about the unreasonable risks that chemicals pose to human health and the environment. TSCA limits the manufacture, processing, commercial distribution, use, and disposal of chemical substances including PCBs, asbestos, radon and lead-based paint.

===The 1971 Council on Environmental Quality Report===
In a 1971 report, the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) urged the Federal government to regulate toxic substances in the U.S. CEQ explained that existing regulations were insufficient to protect human health and the environment. For example, the existing law only took effect after the damages were done and did nothing to prevent future damage. As John R. Quarles Jr., the EPA Deputy Administrator, later explained during congressional testimony in 1975, &quot;While some authority exists to control the production of certain categories of toxic substances, such as pesticides, drugs, and food additives, most existing Federal authorities are designed to prevent harmful exposure only after the substances have been introduced into production.&quot; In order to adequately regulate what chemicals should enter the environment, CEQ recommended that the government create a more comprehensive chemical policy to identify and control the chemicals that are manufactured, produced, and used in the U.S economy. Specifically, CEQ recommended that TSCA strengthen government oversight by requiring the following measures: First, manufacturers should notify officials when they use or produce new chemicals, or plan to sell a significant volume of old chemicals. Second, producers should test their chemicals and report data to officials on the quantities, uses, physical and biological properties, and any other information is necessary for assessing hazardous materials. Lastly, with this information, the government should disclose any information about the health effects caused by dangerous chemicals to the public.

===Congress&#x27; response to CEQ and the drafting of TSCA===
Congress agreed with CEQ that additional authority was required to test chemicals to determine their effect, and responded to CEQ&#x27;s recommendation by proposing many House and Senate bills between 1972 and 1973. Policy makers were also aware that the cancer mortality rate had increased and recognized that the cause of the increase was related to the rise of industrial chemicals in consumer products and the environment. As a result of these concerns, Congress concluded the risk of chemical exposure to the public were serious enough to warrant swift legislative action.

Three key assumptions informed Congress&#x27; approach to drafting a chemicals control policy. First, in order to limit the risks that chemicals pose to human health and the environment, it would be important to be proactive in understanding toxic substances and use preventive measures. Second, toxic risk should be approached in a &quot;holistic rather than fragmented&quot; manner. Third, it was important to collect as much information as possible about the toxicity of chemicals and the risks associated with them.

Although there was much support for policy to address public health risks from chemical exposure, the law was stalled at the last minute because of disagreement over the proper scope of chemical screening prior to commercial production. However, a series of environmental disasters, such as the Kepone catastrophe at Hopewell, Virginia, and the pollution of the Hudson River &quot;and other waterways by PCBs, the threat of stratospheric ozone depletion from chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) emissions, and contamination of agricultural products by polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) in the State of Michigan&quot; provided a clearer picture of the costs of weak regulation over toxic substances. Subsequently, the legislation passed in 1976.

Congress designed TSCA to empower EPA to collect more information on chemicals and their potential dangerous effect on human health and the environment. As a result, TSCA&#x27;s jurisdictional scope is extremely broad. Congress&#x27;s definition of chemical substances includes &quot;any organic or inorganic substance of a particular molecular identity,&quot; and &quot;any combination of such substances occurring in whole or in part as a result of a chemical reaction or occurring in nature&quot; as well as &quot;any element or uncombined radical.&quot; These chemicals are found in children&#x27;s products (e.g., toys) cleaning products, furniture, electronics, building materials, and car interiors. The law attempts to oversee the manufacture (including import), processing, distribution, use and or disposal of such chemical substances. Prior to the enactment of the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, TSCA directed the EPA to use the least burdensome method to reduce chemical risk to reasonable levels while taking into consideration the benefits provided by the chemical product or process.

===Implementation===

There have been many challenges in the implementation of TSCA. First, according to David Markell, Professor of Law at Florida State University, TSCA and preexisting regulations have &quot;an after-the-fact focus&quot; that fails to protect individuals before toxic substances are released in products and is media focused without addressing how to control pollution within communities.

Second, TSCA implementation is difficult because of the number of chemicals in the US market and high costs associated with fully assessing the toxic impacts of so many chemicals on human health and the environment. 62,000 chemicals on the market at the time were listed on the original TSCA Inventory of Chemical Substances. TSCA &quot;grandfathered&quot; these 62,000 chemicals, allowing these substances to remain on the market without first assessing toxic impacts. New chemicals, however, would be subject to review for health and environmental risks. Since then number of chemicals listed on the TSCA Inventory has grown to roughly 84,000. The EPA has only required approximately 200 of these 84,000 chemicals to be tested, and of the 22,000 chemicals introduced since 1976, chemical manufacturers have produced very little data for the EPA on potential health and/or environmental impacts.

Third, even though TSCA gives authority to the EPA to test the existing chemicals through the EPA&#x27;s own rule making process, the EPA has difficulty obtaining the data needed to determine their risks. It is difficult to collect information from industries about the risks of chemicals and the EPA has concluded that conducting its own testing is too costly.

The EPA is authorized to require industry to perform testing of chemicals being produced in substantial quantities or if the EPA finds that the manufacturing, production or use of a chemical &quot;may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment.&quot;

The only information required from chemical producers is chemical identities, names, and molecular structures, categories of use, amount manufactured and processed for each category of use, descriptions of byproducts resulting from manufacture, processing, use, and disposal, environmental and health effects, number of individuals exposed, number of employees exposed and the duration of exposure, and manner or method of chemical disposal.

In order to obtain more information related to chemical risks, the EPA must ask chemical companies to do testing. This occurs either by (1) mutual agreement, or (2) voluntary industry efforts under the HPV Challenge Program. The EPA has also created the Sustainable Futures (SF) Initiative model, which allows companies to voluntarily screen their products that might pose risks to human health or the environment. Through this initiative, the EPA hopes to enable manufacturers to better predict hazards and exposures of their products. The program is designed to enable companies to bring safer chemicals to the market.

== Regulation of existing chemicals ==
Currently, existing chemicals on the market are listed in the TSCA Inventory. Though tasked with protecting the public from dangerous and potentially carcinogenic substances, some 62,000 chemicals were never tested by the EPA because they were &quot;grandfathered in and statutorily not considered an &quot;unreasonable risk.&quot; Without testing, TSCA grandfathered the use of these chemicals into TSCA&#x27;s list of &quot;existing&quot; (as opposed to &quot;new&quot;) chemicals. For existing chemicals, manufacturers need to generate and report data on risk, manufacturing and processing, adverse health effects, published and unpublished health and safety studies, and &quot;substantial risks.&quot; to the EPA Also, if a substance is subject of a Significant New Use Rule (SNUR), a company would have to submit and receive approval of a Significant New Use Notice (SNUN) prior to undertaking the significant new use(s) defined in the SNUR. 

Under section 4, the EPA has the authority to require manufacturers to test existing chemicals, but in each case the EPA must make several formal findings, the first of which is subject to judicial review under the &quot;substantial evidence&quot; standard. In particular, the requirement that the EPA determine that the chemical &quot;may present an unreasonable risk&quot; creates a regulatory &quot;Catch-22&quot; as such a determination requires much of the very data that the EPA cannot access or cause to be generated without first making the determination. This burden was one of the drivers for changes to Section 4 during the negotiations to reform TSCA.

In 1989, the EPA issued a final rule under section 6 to ban the manufacturing, importing, and processing of nearly all asbestos-containing products in the USA. However, it had only limited success in using the authority granted under TSCA section 6 to control chemicals tested and deemed dangerous to public health. The EPA&#x27;s failure to adequately regulate these chemicals caused strong debates over the legal burden the EPA bears in banning chemicals. The EPA has been successful in restricting five chemicals using section 6 authority (PCBs, chlorofluorocarbons, dioxin, asbestos, and hexavalent chromium) in its 38-year history, with the ban on asbestos being partially overturned in 1991. EPA has restricting some existing chemicals using Section 5 SNURs.

, 250 of the more than 60,000 existing chemicals have been directly tested by the EPA. 140 of those chemicals were tested by regulatory order and 60 were tested after voluntary consent by the manufacturer. Additionally, there are 3,000 high production volume (HPV) chemicals, produced or imported in quantities exceeding one million pounds per year These HPV chemicals only constitute one third of existing chemicals, but their high volumes raise concern about the lack of basic hazard information. Many environmental groups, such as Natural Resources Defense Council, complain that the EPA is nearly powerless to take regulatory action against dangerous chemicals, even those known to cause cancer or other serious health effects. The HPV program lead to the generation of new or release of existing data on over 2,200 chemicals.

== Regulation of new chemicals ==

Companies must notify the EPA of their intention to manufacture (or import) a new chemical (one not listed on the TSCA Inventory) by submitting a PMN at least 90 days prior to the first manufacture or import for a non-exempt purpose. Section 5 of TSCA does not require any toxicity testing before submitting a PMN No safety information is required to be included in the PMN, so the EPA must rely on computer modeling to determine whether the new chemical &quot;may present an unreasonable risk.&quot; In order to regulate new chemicals, the EPA must determine that the chemical &quot;...may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment...&quot; or show that the chemical &quot;... is or will be produced in substantial quantities, and such substance either enters or may reasonably be anticipated to enter the environment in substantial quantities or there is or may be significant or substantial human exposure to the substance...&quot; 

If the EPA does not satisfy these requirements, it cannot act to block the manufacture of the new chemical. The EPA has only 90 days from receipt of a PMN to act before the new chemical may be legally marketed and included in products. In consequence, only 40 percent of acute toxicity and mutagenicity testing is ever completed, even less data on long-term effects or specific endpoints (including subchronic, neurotoxicological, developmental, reproductive, and chronic) is ever generated. Additionally, less than 5 percent of data on toxicity to aquatic organisms is submitted with a PMN. &quot; From 1979 to 1994 the EPA OPPT&#x27;s new chemical program received over 24000 PMNs and sought to delay manufacture and require additional data for only 5000 of those submissions. Half of these nonetheless ultimately entered and are still on the market.

EPA evaluation found that 85 percent of PMN data on health effects is deficient, and 67 percent of PMNs contain deficiencies on health or environmental effects of any kind. In order to compensate for this deficiency of data, Section 5 of TSCA created The Structure Activity Team (SAT) along with structural-activity relations (SARs) to review PMN chemicals. SAT consists of a team of expert scientists and specialists who evaluate the potential environmental fate, and health and environmental hazards of new chemicals

Since there is little to no data received with the PMNs, hazard assessments for chemicals depend heavily on models, SARs based on analogous chemicals, or, in some cases, data on the subject chemical retrieved from public databases or reference material such as Beilstein. However, it has been argued that SARs and SAT&#x27;s review process do not adequately evaluate risks associated with new chemicals. For instance, there is no minimum data set beyond information already in possession at the time they file the PMN. The EPA may regulate chemicals that enter the market only under the standards of TSCA and also carries the burden of proving the safety of existing chemicals

==Chemical Substance Inventory (TSCA Inventory)==
The TSCA Chemical Substance Inventory (TSCA Inventory) is EPA&#x27;s comprehensive list of confidential and non-confidential chemical substances. The non-confidential inventory is provided in Microsoft Access and CSV formats within ZIP files. Inventory notification reporting is through an updated user interface in the Central Data Exchange (CDX) Chemical Safety and Pesticide Programs (CSPP) web application for company-authorized officials and their support; there is no role for the public to access the CDX CSPP web app. The Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) is a different inventory for Superfund reporting.

== Criticism ==
TSCA had been severely criticized by non-governmental organizations, academics, scientists, and even government agencies for failing to regulate the safe use of chemicals affecting human health and environmental welfare effectively. Prior to the TSCA amendments in 2016, &quot;the act has not been substantially updated.&quot; Organizations concerned about product safety, &quot;including the chemical industry, environmental and public health advocates, and the EPA&quot; have attempted to mitigate the effects of weak regulation. They argue that &quot;the inability to function as intended results from a series of legal, organizational, and political challenges.&quot; According to Wilson and Schwarzman, there are three gaps in US chemicals policy:
*&quot;Data gap: Producers are not required to investigate and disclose sufficient information on the hazard traits of chemicals to government, the public, or businesses that use chemicals.
*&quot;Safety gap: Government lacks the legal tools it needs to efficiently identify, prioritize, and take action to mitigate the potential health and environmental effects of hazardous chemicals.
*&quot;Technology gap: Industry and government have invested only marginally in green chemistry research, development, and education.&quot;

The EPA Office of the Inspector General said in 2010 that implementation has been &quot;inconsistent and presents a minimal presence.&quot; The report criticized the process by which the EPA handles new TSCA cases, claiming it is &quot;predisposed to protect industry information rather than to provide public access to health and safety studies.&quot; GAO suggests that concern for trade secrets is preventing effective testing. In come cases, toxicity studies do not include the specific identity of the test substance and cannot report any problems because &quot;health and safety data are of limited value if the chemical the data pertain to is unknown.&quot;

===State regulation of toxic substances and chemicals===
Certain state governments have implemented &quot;comprehensive regulatory programs&quot; for stricter control on toxic chemicals as a response to the failure of Congress to modernize TSCA. Some critics of TSCA note its inability to support meaningful action to prevent a patchwork of state policies as state lawmakers in 18 states have collectively passed 71 chemical laws since 2003. In states such as California, Connecticut, and Michigan diverse chemical policy actions were introduced favoring tighter regulation to protect vulnerable populations and the environment from exposure to dangerous chemicals. 

Critics favoring a federal reform of TSCA argue that the patchwork of state chemical management laws create &quot;tensions between federal and state powers.&quot; Moreover, state law initiatives and rules to target chemicals have significant support from &quot;the public demanding stricter chemical control.&quot; Stringent state laws have successfully implemented more regulation on &quot;BPA in plastic products and food beverage containers or flame retardants in furniture.&quot; Campaigns focusing on increasing consumer awareness of chemicals in products have been able to educate the public about the potential risk of exposure to chemical products that can harm their health and the environment. According to a poll conducted by the Mellman Group, 78 percent of Americans are seriously concerned about the threat to children&#x27;s health from toxic chemicals in day-to-day life. The same poll reported that 33 percent of the respondents answered that everyday exposure to toxic chemicals is a serious issue.

===Chemical industry&#x27;s support for TSCA reform===
In 2009, chemical manufacturers stated that TSCA needs &quot;modernizing&quot; to offer better regulation of current and future chemical products available in the market. The chemical industry is frustrated with state-level restrictions because state policies on chemical products create &quot;market disruption and impose unnecessary regulatory burdens, without necessarily improving public health.&quot; The chemical manufacturers &quot;reluctantly&quot; support a reform of TSCA, agreeing that it is necessary to avoid ambiguities. The chemical producers support implementation of more uniform and consistent regulations at the federal level that pre-empt state law. The modernization of TSCA can give the chemical industry a standard to follow and allow them to market their products for domestic consumption or international sales without having to spend more money trying to comply with a myriad of individual state regulations. Yet, environmental groups and state agencies argue that TSCA provisions &quot;protect confidential business information&quot; (CBI) preventing them from accessing information relevant to their task. However, chemical manufacturers and their trade associations would prefer a weaker version of TSCA that pre-empts state law, due to the more than 40 different state government regulations on toxic chemicals. In addition, businesses would like a standard that can be applied uniformly, rather than having to report many different and overlapping sets of requirements to the individual states where the companies do business. Chemical manufacturers have also automated quality processes by incorporating a quality management system in efforts to foster a better, safer industry.

===Consumer support for the reform of TSCA===
Growing public concern about exposure to dangerous chemicals in their everyday life has received attention from state and local agencies. Redefining is needed to respond to the consumer demand: &quot;public policies governing chemical design, production, and use need deep restructuring in light of new science on the health and environmental effects of anthropogenic chemicals&quot; For better management and control of chemicals &quot;a string of high-profile campaigns focusing on chemicals in consumer products&quot; has made consumers aware of &quot;chemical exposures to everyday life&quot; by releasing information on the hazards and outcome of chemical use. Labeling is an alternative solution to give the consumer the freedom to choose what products to buy &quot;as a condition for entering or remaining on the market, using a standard that establishes a reasonable certainty of no harm.&quot; The private sector responded to the public concern of chemical exposure in everyday life by incorporating &quot;screening mechanism(s) to diminish and/or prevent the marketing of products containing chemical substances that could potentially adversely affect human health and the environment.&quot; The demand for sustainable products can force the market to adopt more green chemistry.

===Technological innovation and TSCA reform===
Opponents to TSCA reform proposals argue that stringent legislation can be seen as &quot;job-killing.&quot; Nevertheless, the demand for sustainable products can increase innovation and investment in new products that can eventually replace toxic chemicals. Green chemistry is an innovative way to design chemicals to be less hazardous, with the goal of making chemicals and products &quot;benign by design.&quot;see CGCI According to the Safer Chemicals, Healthy Families Coalition, &quot;18 states have collectively passed 71 chemical laws since 2003.&quot; Similarly, the state of California implemented the Green Chemistry Initiative (CGCI) in an effort to increase innovation and reduce or eliminate hazardous substances to human health and the environment. The CGCI responds to the demand by consumers and environmental groups advocating for greener products.

Green technology innovation introduced new products using nanotechnology available for consumption. The ultra fine nano particles can enter the human body via the skin, lungs or intestinal tract and may induce undesirable genetic changes as a side effect. The regulation of nano particles is another challenge for TSCA, &quot;there are no specific regulations on nanoparticles except existing regulations covering the same material in bulk form.&quot; However, if the bulk form of the nanomaterial is not listed on the TSCA Inventory, the nanomaterial is a new chemical substance that is subject to pre-market review. There is not enough knowledge about the potential risk of exposure while new nano material created at a rapid rate is incorporated into consumer products without testing the toxicity risk of exposure to human health and the environment. Technological creation of new chemicals is ahead of TSCA regulation for new chemicals. The U.S. chemical industry claims having tight regulations can interfere with their ability to compete. Nevertheless, in Europe new regulation motivated the chemical industry to innovate. For instance, the European parliament implemented a successful comprehensive reform of REACH by applying the &quot;No data, no market&quot; rule to pressure chemical manufacturers to submit safety data for both new and existing chemicals produced in or exported to Europe. This approach motivated the chemical industry in Europe to innovate, invest more in research &amp; development and produce greener products.

Other groups concerned with TSCA&#x27;s lack of efficacy include the Physicians for Social Responsibility, the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, the Environmental Defense Fund, the Lung Cancer Alliance and the Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization representing more than 11 million people nationwide. These diverse groups, under the umbrella of the National Resources Defense Council however are displeased with the new draft bill written by deceased Senator Lautenberg in May 2013. The group is calling for greater oversight and reporting of health hazards of chemicals contained in everyday products.

==TSCA and environmental justice==
TSCA can promote environmental justice in communities where minorities and low-income residents disproportionately bear great exposure to toxic chemicals increasing their risk to suffer from &quot;chronic diseases and conditions such as prostate cancer, learning disabilities, asthma, infertility, and obesity.&quot; Public policy can transform and empower communities &quot;fighting environmental racism&quot; associated with industrial facilities built near low-income neighborhoods. Communities from minority groups are disproportionately affected by &quot;environmental threats from toxic contamination, locally unwanted land use (LULUs) to unsafe and substandard housing and natural-resource extractions&quot; cannot wait for years until bureaucratic processes demonstrate their health has been at risk from living under these conditions. Studies have shown that &quot;lower-income people were found to be significantly more likely than were higher income people to live near a polluting industrial facility.&quot; The market dynamics responds to &quot;the industry seeking to build their facilities where land is cheap and where industrial labor pools and sources of materials are nearby.&quot; Eventually, industrial facilities may contribute to the depreciation of property in the neighboring areas affecting the value of housing because of noise, release of pollutants, and fear of health impact. Wealthy communities will actively oppose the placing of industrial facilities near them but the low-income neighborhoods &quot;and communities of color become an easier target&quot; as they are not well represented or well organized to fight against the industry and the government. Environmental disparities is a prevalent issue for low income-people as they become trapped in &quot;housing discrimination&quot; living in polluted neighborhoods unable to relocate to a nicer area.

===Populations vulnerable to toxic and chemical substances exposure===
Environmental justice groups can engage the community to impact local state and federal policy. TSCA regulation can protect public health by &quot;limiting the market for hazardous chemicals and promote safe chemical production.&quot; Vulnerable population such as infants, pregnant women, the elderly and certain occupational workers bear a higher risk to diseases from exposure to toxic chemicals. The elderly are vulnerable from exposure to chemicals that may impair their weak immune system, and cause heart disease among other health issues from interactions with medication. Children are vulnerable to the health impacts of environmental injustice because their immune system is immature and they cannot handle the amount of chemicals in relation to the size of their body. To protect vulnerable groups the federal, state and local government could implement better policy to protect them from the increasing number of chemical exposure happening in daily basis. This concern is reflected in the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, which includes a requirement that EPA evaluate risk to &quot;potentially exposed and susceptible subpopulations.&quot; 

====Children&#x27;s exposure to toxic chemicals====
Children are more susceptible to develop patterns of illness with longtime effect in their health for which chemical exposure can be contributing pediatric disease. The main health problems associated with environmental chemical pollutants are asthma, lead poisoning and obesity. It is estimated that &quot;the annual costs of environmentally attributable diseases in American children due to lead poisoning amounts to $43.4 billion.&quot; Toxic chemicals &quot;threaten the health of the developing fetus, babies, young children and teens.&quot; It is important to protect children from chemical exposures as they &quot;are less able than adults to break down and excrete toxic compounds.&quot; Children are exposed to newly invented chemicals used for consumer products, and is also found in &quot;air, food, water, homes, schools, and communities.&quot; Communities living near hot spots present health problems &quot;associated with both social and environmental stressors,&quot; this can put a disproportionately burden on families. Therefore, &quot;information on potential toxicity&quot; can help parents to make better decisions about the products they purchase for the use of the children. Information about the toxicity is only available for about &quot;two-thirds of the 3000 high production volume (HPV) chemicals.&quot; Policy and regulation to protect vulnerable groups can reduce the exposure of children to toxic substances. For instance, in 2008, the state of Maine implemented the Kid-Safe Act to protect children from exposure to lead in toys &quot;and bisphenol A (better known as BPA) in baby bottles&quot; In January 2016, the Center for Science in the Public Interest released a report entitled &quot;Seeing Red - Time for Action on Food Dyes&quot; which criticized the continued use of artificial food coloring in the United States. The report estimated that over half a million children in the United States suffer adverse behavioral reactions as a result of ingesting food dyes, with an estimated cost exceeding $5 billion per year, citing data from by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The report urges the Food and Drug Administration to take action to ban or curtail the use of such dyes. Readers are reminded that baby bottles and artificial food coloring are not regulated under TSCA jurisdiction, rather they are regulated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. However, other toxic substances that may be found in baby food (e.g., bisphenol A), are under TSCA jurisdiction.

====Pregnant women&#x27;s exposure to chemicals====
Pregnant women exposure to toxic chemicals in daily basis &quot;can impact the reproductive and developmental health&quot; during critical windows of development, this may lead to a higher risk for birth defects and childhood illnesses and &quot;disability across the entire span of human life.&quot; Health professionals can provide information to women planning to become pregnant or already pregnant to avoid potential hazards and exposure to environmental toxic chemicals. Eating healthy food can reduce the impact of toxic chemicals, for instance consuming organic food. Mothers who are breastfeeding can expose their child to toxic chemicals in their milk. When the diet of children is modified from &quot;conventional to organic food, the levels of pesticides in their bodies decline,&quot; but low-income families have to prioritize their needs and buying organic food may not be possible because of a budget constraint Readers are reminded that pesticides are not regulated under TSCA jurisdiction, rather they are regulated under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act. However, other toxic substances that can be transmitted through breast milk (e.g., per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)) are under TSCA jurisdiction.

====Occupational workers&#x27; exposure to toxic chemicals====
According to the Occupational Safety &amp; Health Administration (OSHA) workers have the right to a safe workplace that do not pose a risk of serious harm. Occupational exposure to chemicals can happen through direct skin contact, inhalation, ingestion or eye contact. People working under certain occupations are more exposed to toxic chemicals that can have a negative longtime effect in their health. If the rate of exposure exceeds the capacity of the body to detoxify and eliminate them, it can accumulate in the body and potentially harm it. Male and female fertility can be compromised from exposure to toxic chemicals. Concerns for exposure to workers is reflected in the explicit inclusion of workers with the definition of &quot;potentially exposed and susceptible subpopulations&quot; in the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act.

====Corporate support for mitigation of toxic chemical exposure====
Corporations can show social responsibility by removing products from the market and introducing similar alternatives that can benefit vulnerable groups. For instance, &quot;Kaiser Permanente, a major medical supply purchaser, has a policy to avoid chemicals associated with cancer, reproductive problems and genetic mutations.&quot; Corporation social responsibility (CSR) is the moral obligation of the firm &quot;to create success in ways that honors ethical values and respect to communities while promoting sustainability and a good reputation.&quot; Corporations can innovate and improve their image by responding to the increasing demand of green chemicals by consumers seeking better options to reduce their exposure to toxic chemicals.

==Reform bills==

===Prior to 2015===
On May 23, 2013, Senators David Vitter (R-LA) and Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ), introduced a TSCA reform bill, co-sponsored by a number of other senators at the United States House Energy Subcommittee on Environment and Economy. The main focus of this effort was to amend TSCA&#x27;s subsection S.1009, the Chemical Safety Improvement Act (CSIA). The Environmental Defense Fund, felt it would have given the EPA many critical tools to strengthen the provisions on public health protection and improved TSCA.

The bill&#x27;s key revision included &quot;mandating safety evaluations for all chemicals in active commerce, requiring new chemicals to be deemed likely safe before entering the market, fixing the key flaws in TSCA&#x27;s safety standard that led to the EPA&#x27;s inability to ban asbestos, allowing the EPA to order testing without first having to show potential risk, and making more information about chemicals available to states, health professionals and the public by limiting current trade secret allowances.&quot;

The CSIA would have required states to co-enforce any requirements laid out by the EPA, i.e. to have funding and man-power to enforce all regulations that the EPA decided on, and causing a disconnect in partnerships between the state, federal government, and communities.

The 2014 West Virginia Chemical Spill created many controversies regarding CSIA. no data on the spilled chemical were available, including data on repeated dose toxicity, carcinogenicity, reproductive toxicity, specific target organ toxicity, and repeated exposure. On February 4, 2014, the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works held hearings on the CSIA right after the incident. In the aftermath of the spill, the House approved a bill 95-0 which provides safeguards for chemical storage tanks and public water supplies. It included new requirements on early detection technology and plans that protect against drinking water contamination.

The CSIA was supported by the National Hispanic Medical Association, the Environmental Defense Fund], the American Academy of Pediatrics, The Humane Society, The New York Times, the Washington Post, the Chicago Tribune, the American Alliance for Innovation, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, North America&#x27;s Building Trades Union SMART-Transportation Division, International Association of Bridge, Structural, Ornamental and Reinforcing Iron Workers, the American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine], the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and Third Way.

===2015===
In March 2015, Senator Tom Udall (D, NM) sponsored Senate bill 697, to amend and reauthorize TSCA, called the &quot;Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act&quot;. Environmental, health and labor organizations and several states criticized it, because &quot;it would gut state chemical regulations&quot;., but officials from the EPA and Administrator Gina McCarthy have testified that the bill meets all of the Obama Administration&#x27;s principles for TSCA reform and that the Administrator was &quot;encouraged&quot; by the bipartisan progress. In addition, the Environmental Defense Fund supports S. 697, stating that it &quot;will give [the] EPA the tools necessary to better ensure the safety of chemicals and significantly strengthen health protections for American families.&quot; Senate bill 725, introduced by Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and Senator Edward Markey (D-MA), also called the &quot;Alan Reinstein and Trevor Schaefer Toxic Chemical Protection Act&quot;, would enable the EPA to quickly assess the safety of more chemicals and allow new state policies.

In June 2015 the House passed H.R.2576, the TSCA Modernization Act of 2015, and was referred to the Senate.

On January 20, 2016, Gina McCarthy, the EPA Administrator, sent a letter to Congress detailing the EPA&#x27;s positions on S. 697 and H.R. 2576. The letter points out support and concern for a number of topics related to TSCA reform, including: Deadlines for action, elimination of the &quot;least burdensome&quot; requirement for Section 6 regulation, a sustained source of funding, existing chemical review prioritization, consistent applicability of a new TSCA safety standard for both new and existing chemicals, transparency and confidential business information, chemicals contained in articles, and state preemption.

Congress passed a reconciled version of the reform bill, the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, with bipartisan support in early June 2016. On Wednesday, June 22, 2016, President Barack Obama signed the bill into law, remarking that &quot;even in the current polarized political process here in Washington, things can work.&quot; Lawmakers and industry groups were largely supportive of the new law, while environmental advocates offered more mixed reactions.

== Comparison with EU chemical regulation ==
The European Union (EU) enacted similar laws called Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (REACH) on June 1, 2007 to improve the former legislative framework on chemicals.

There are three main points to emphasize on the comparisons of REACH and TSCA.

===REACH vs. TSCA requirements on developing chemical information===
Developing a sufficient information is important for risk management and for prevention from potential hazardous substances. Categories of information that are useful in risk management are first, scientific information including the composition of the chemical, secondly, technological information including monitoring, preventing or controlling, and finally, legal information including the rights and obligations of producers, consumers and general public . TSCA requires chemical companies to submit to the EPA any available human health and environmental data on the existing chemicals. TSCA does not require chemical companies to conduct toxicity tests for new chemicals on their effects on human health or the environment, but the companies can perform test on voluntary base. In TSCA&#x27;s section 5, companies are required to submit such data if the effect already exists when they submit a premanufacture notice (PMN) to the EPA. In order to compensate the gap of actual test data in section 5, a process involving structure-activity relationship (SAR) was created to assess hazardous risks. Consequently, and according to information dating from the 1980s, slightly less than 50% of new chemicals submitted for evaluation by the EPA are accompanied by toxicity data, which mainly consists of local irritation (skin and eyes) or acute toxicity tests in laboratory animals. TSCA also requires data on the physical and chemical properties, fate, health and environmental effects of the chemical (hazard information) that the companies possess or reasonably ascertainable when they submit the intent of manufacturing notice to the EPA. The EPA compares new and existing chemicals by their molecular structures in order to determine if any health and environmental effects are available. Authorized by TSCA section 8(d), the EPA may require manufacturers and importers of a given chemical to submit copies of unpublished health and safety studies including the chemicals produced in the ten years before the effective date of the EPA rule. In 2021, EPA issued a data call-in rule under Section 8(d) to help inform EPA&#x27;s assessment of dozens of chemicals that were either under evaluation or that EPA was considering for prioritization. 

Under REACH and European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) regulations, chemical companies are required to provide quantity of chemicals and depending on the quantity, the companies need to further develop data on human health and environment for both existing and new chemicals. For example, at the one or more tonnage, chemical companies are required to register and submit information including chemical identity, production process, instruction of usage, safety guidance, summaries of physical and chemical properties, exposure and effects on human health and environment. At the 10 or more tonnage, the information for one or more tonnage must be included, additionally, chemical safety assessment, a physiochemical hazard, an environmental hazard, and chemical&#x27;s persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic pollutant assessment information are required. For 100 or more tonnage annually, bioaccumulation, simulation testing, identification of degradation data, long term toxicity to fish and aquatic species, short term toxicity to terrestrial organisms and plants, two generation toxicity study, subchronic toxicity to mammals data are required.

Under TSCA, EPA will rely upon models or analogs to fill data gaps for properties, toxicity, and fate if EPA has data gaps for the substance. Under REACH, ECHA requires that registrants fill data gaps, but registrants may do so with data on the substance or analogs, model output, or waivers (if justified).

===TSCA and REACH regulations on potential chemical risks===
Under the TSCA, the EPA needs to collect data to assess the potential risks of chemicals and requires developing substantial evidence in order to withstand judicial review and policy making. Due to the section 6(a) of TSCA, the EPA has difficulty proving that certain chemicals pose unreasonable risks. In order to regulate those chemicals, the EPA must find reasonable basis including the effects of substance on human and environment, magnitude of exposure, benefits and uses of the chemical, and availability of the substance. The EPA also needs to determine the reasonably ascertainable economic consequences of the rule, after considering the effect to the national economy and businesses. However, the section 6 is taken into consideration to amend in the 2013 reform. Section 6 also limits or restricts the production of PCBs, fully halogenated chlorofluoroalkanes, dioxin, asbestos, nitrosating agents, and hexavalent chromium. In addition for 160 existing chemicals, under Section 5a2, TSCA requires chemical companies to submit notices to the EPA prior to manufacturing, importing, or processing of the substance for new usage. TSCA also utilizes different models such as ecological risk assessment, quotient method for exceeding measurement endpoints, exposure assessment, PMN, assessment dose-response assessment, etc.

REACH requires chemical manufacturers, importers, and downstream users to ensure that the chemicals do not negatively affect human health or the environment and they should request authorization to produce or import hazardous chemicals and the companies to search for safer alternatives. The authorization procedure involves first, the European Chemicals Agency to publish a candidate list of chemicals, secondly, the European Commission to determine the authorizations or exempts from candidate lists, and finally, if a chemical is deemed to require authorization, a chemical company will have to apply to the European Commission for the authorization. If the chemical company can demonstrate the social and economic benefits outweigh the risks, the harmful chemical may be able to get authorization. Likewise TSCA, REACH restricts chemicals that pose an unacceptable risk to health or environment. In order to restrict, REACH must demonstrate the chemical&#x27;s risk to human health or the environment that needs to be addressed at the community wide level and identify the most appropriate set of risk reduction measures and safer substitutes.

===TSCA vs. REACH disclosing information to the public===
Information disclosure gives an opportunity to the public to immediately react and avoid exposure to potential chemical hazards and risks for example by changing consumer behavior or applying pressure on the chemical firms etc. In the other hand, information disclosure also can motivate firms to search for safer alternatives. 
TSCA allows companies to claim their precise chemical volumes, components, chemical uses, and essentially any information provided to the EPA as business confidential except in the cases that chemical need health and safety studies. In this extent of TSCA, the EPA&#x27; s ability is restricted to share information including the company&#x27;s identities, the chemical&#x27;s structures to any public groups except the designated contractors, or to law enforcement officials. It is important that the state and local environmental non-governmental agencies, environmental advocates and other public groups in obtaining chemical information in order to develop contingency plans and effective emergency responses in cases of highly toxic exposures. However, the EPA can only disclose confidential business information when it determines such disclosure is necessary to protect human health or the environment from an unreasonable risk.
Similar to TSCA, REACH mandates chemical companies to disclosure of health and safety information that allows public to have an access to the basic chemical information, including brief profiles of hazardous properties, authorized uses, and risk management measures. Also one of the main strength of REACH is in the extent to which the government intends to make the public receive as much as information possible, including identification of substances of a very high concern that are subject to authorization. REACH considers the full chemical composition, the preparation, the precise use, the detailed function or application of the chemical, the precise tonnage or volume of the chemical manufactured or placed on the market and the relationships between manufacturers, importers and downstream users as confidential for the industry&#x27;s economic purpose. For persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic substances (PBTs), very persistent and very bioaccumulative and toxic substances (vPvB), and other chemicals that are classified as dangerous, REACH requires firms to submit a safety data sheet so that downstream users, manufacturers, retailers, and importers have the information required to safely use and handle the chemicals. Unlike TSCA, REACH can share the firm&#x27;s chemical information with state, government authorities and EU organizations under an agreement between the firm and the other responsible parties.

===Comparison of TSCA and REACH&#x27;s selected provisions===
====Number of chemicals covered in the inventory====
REACH: After enacting REACH in the European Union, the officials estimated approximately 30,000 cases that have produced or imported at a level of at least 1 metric ton chemicals.
TSCA: Currently more than 82,000 chemicals are in the TSCA inventory and 20,000 of them were added after 1979 into the inventory after the EPA program started reviewing the existing chemicals.

====Complete risk assessment requirements====
REACH requires chemical companies that produce at level of 1 metric tons per year to conduct risk assessment along with European Chemical Agency&#x27;s review and for the companies that produce more than 10 tons or more per years need to conduct chemical safety assessment for all the chemicals produced.
TSCA does not require chemical companies to perform risk assessments on new chemicals. However, it allows companies to perform voluntary risk assessments on their new chemicals. For existing chemicals, companies are required to notify the EPA immediately of new unpublished information on chemicals that have potential risks but are not required to conduct risk assessments.

====Production quantity disclosure====
REACH requires chemical companies to submit their registration yearly with the information on the overall quantity of production or importing of a chemical in metric tons per year in a technical dossier and immediately report if any significant changes occur in the quantity.

TSCA: Chemical companies must provide the EPA a reasonable third year estimate for their new chemicals in total production volume at the time a Premanufacture Notices is submitted. For every 5 years, the existing chemicals on the TSCA inventory and produced at quantities of 25,000 pounds or more must be reported.

<text>The Wallis product is the infinite product representation of :

:formula_1

It was published in 1656 by John Wallis.

== Proof using integration ==
Wallis derived this infinite product using interpolation, though his method is not regarded as rigorous. A modern derivation can be found by examining formula_2 for even and odd values of formula_3, and noting that for large formula_3, increasing formula_3 by 1 results in a change that becomes ever smaller as formula_3 increases. Let

:formula_7

(This is a form of Wallis&#x27; integrals.) Integrate by parts:

:formula_8

:formula_9
Now, we make two variable substitutions for convenience to obtain:
:formula_10
:formula_11

We obtain values for formula_12 and formula_13 for later use.

:formula_14

Now, we calculate for even values formula_15 by repeatedly applying the recurrence relation result from the integration by parts. Eventually, we end get down to formula_12, which we have calculated.

:formula_17

:formula_18

Repeating the process for odd values formula_19,

:formula_20

:formula_21

We make the following observation, based on the fact that formula_22

:formula_23

:formula_24

Dividing by formula_19:

:formula_26, where the equality comes from our recurrence relation.

By the squeeze theorem,

:formula_27

:formula_28

:formula_29

=== Proof using Laplace&#x27;s method ===
See the main page on Gaussian integral.

== Proof using Euler&#x27;s infinite product for the sine function ==
While the proof above is typically featured in modern calculus textbooks, the Wallis product is, in retrospect, an easy corollary of the later Euler infinite product for the sine function.

:formula_30

Let formula_31:

:formula_32   

== Relation to Stirling&#x27;s approximation==

Stirling&#x27;s approximation for the factorial function formula_33 asserts that
:formula_34

Consider now the finite approximations to the Wallis product, obtained by taking the first formula_35 terms in the product
:formula_36

where formula_37 can be written as
:formula_38

Substituting Stirling&#x27;s approximation in this expression (both for formula_39 and formula_40) one can deduce (after a short calculation) that formula_37 converges to formula_42 as formula_43.

==Derivative of the Riemann zeta function at zero==
The Riemann zeta function and the Dirichlet eta function can be defined:
:formula_44

Applying an Euler transform to the latter series, the following is obtained:
:formula_45

:formula_46

<doc id="1301696" wikidata="Q7541726" url="?curid=1301696" title="Slovene pronouns">
<text>The Slovene language has a range of pronouns that in some ways work quite differently from English ones. This page details their usage. For declensions, see Slovene declension#Pronouns.

==Pronoun==
Pronouns can replace a noun in a sentence; this is, as opposed to, say, an adjective or an adverb.

===Personal pronouns===
A personal pronoun denotes the speaker (&quot;I&quot;), the addressee (&quot;you&quot;) or a third person (&quot;it&quot;). Personal pronouns in Slovene are inflected in a somewhat unusual way, for there are many different forms for each of the pronouns.

Several of the pronouns have unstressed and clitic forms that are unstressed, and may attach to another word. For example:
* &quot;Zanj mi je dal denar.&quot; &quot;He gave me the money for him.&quot; (Note: if the &#x27;he&#x27; was referring to the same person, the reflexive personal pronoun would be used.)
* &quot;Za njega mi je dal denar.&quot; &quot;He gave me the money for him (in particular).&quot;
* &quot;Sledili smo jim.&quot; &quot;We followed them.&quot;
* &quot;Spodbudili smo jih, da naj se pokažejo vredne našega zaupanja, a so nas nesramno zavrnili.&quot; &quot;We encouraged them to prove themselves worthy of our trust, but they rejected us rudely.&quot;
* &quot;Nanjo se je zgrnila ena nesreča za drugo.&quot; &quot;She was struck by one misfortune after another.&quot;
* &quot;Da bi le njim to lahko dopovedali!&quot; &quot;If only we could make them understand this!&quot;
* &quot;Zame ni več rešitve: pugubljena sem.&quot; &quot;For me there is no solution any more: I am doomed.&quot;
* &quot;Pogledal ga je s kancem ironije v očeh.&quot; &quot;He looked at him with a drop of irony in the eyes.&quot;
* &quot;Pogledal je njega.&quot; &quot;He looked at him (in particular).&quot;

The nominative forms of personal pronouns are not used in neutral sentences, only when emphasizing the subject, especially so for the first person singular &quot;jaz&quot; &quot;I&quot;. This is because unlike in English, the form of the verb gives all applicable information such as the gender, grammatical number and person by itself.

* &quot;Jaz mislim drugače.&quot; &quot;I (in particular, or contrasting) think otherwise.&quot;

The reflexive pronoun begins with &quot;s-&quot; and is used to refer back to the subject, or to some other word.

For example:
* &quot;Umivam si roke.&quot; &quot;I am washing my hands.&quot;
* &quot;Umivate si roke.&quot; &quot;You are washing your hands.&quot;
* &quot;Umivam se.&quot; &quot;I am washing myself.&quot;
* &quot;Umivate se.&quot; &quot;You are washing yourselves.&quot;

Similarly as in German and English, the reflexive pronoun can sometimes be replaced by the reciprocal phrase &quot;drug drugega&quot; &quot;each other, one another&quot;. Thus:
* &quot;Drug drugemu umivata roke.&quot; &quot;The two of them are washing each other&#x27;s hands.&quot;
* &quot;Umivata drug drugega.&quot; &quot;The two of them are washing each other.&quot;

The accusative &quot;se&quot; can bind with prepositional words just like other personal pronouns:
* &quot;Nase je nanesla lepotilno kremo.&quot; &quot;She put beautifying cream on herself.&quot;
* &quot;Ampak ko dela zase, dela učinkovito.&quot; &quot;But when he/she works for him-/herself, he/she works efficiently.&quot;

Other cases and examples:
* &quot;Sebi gradi grobnico.&quot; &quot;He/She is building a tomb for him-/herself.&quot;
* &quot;Gradi si grobnico.&quot; &quot;He/She is building a tomb for him-/herself.&quot; (The emphasis here is not so much on for whom the tomb is, but rather the tomb or the building itself.)
* &quot;S sabo/seboj ni zadovoljna.&quot; &quot;She is not happy with herself.&quot;
* &quot;Najprej počisti pri sebi, potlej šele kritiziraj druge!&quot; &quot;First clean up at yourself, only then criticise others!&quot;
* &quot;Ko je videl odsev sebe v ogledalu, mu je ta pogled povsem pokvaril dan.&quot; &quot;When he saw the reflexion of himself in the mirror, this sight completely ruined the day for him.&quot; (Not a widely used construction, this would be more usually expressed with the possessive adjective: &quot;Ko je videl svoj odsev v ogledalu ...&quot;)

===Interrogative pronouns===

The interrogative pronouns introduce direct and indirect questions. There are two nominative forms: &quot;kdo&quot; &quot;who&quot; and &quot;kaj&quot; &quot;what&quot;.

* &quot;Kaj je ta stvar, ki se premika?&quot; &quot;What is this thing that is moving?&quot;
* &quot;Vprašal sem ga, o kom je bil govoril.&quot; &quot;I asked him about whom he had been talking.&quot;
* &quot;Komu naj dam to?&quot; &quot;To whom ought I to give this?&quot;
* &quot;Česa ne smem storiti?&quot; &quot;What may I not do?&quot;

===Relative pronouns===

The substantival relative pronoun is derived from the interrogative by adding &quot;-r&quot;: &quot;kdor&quot; &quot;who, that&quot;, &quot;kar&quot; &quot;which, that&quot;.

* &quot;Kdor krade, ni pošten.&quot; &quot;Someone who steals is not honest.&quot;
* &quot;Kar poveš, tega ne moreš več obvladovati.&quot; &quot;Something that you say, that you cannot control any more.&quot;
* &quot;Odrekli so ji možnost do izbire odvetnika, s čimer je bila kršena njena ustavna pravica.&quot; &quot;They refused her the option of choosing a solicitor, with which her constitutional right was violated.&quot;

===Negative pronouns===

The negative pronoun is derived from the interrogative as well, and starts with &quot;ni-&quot;: &quot;nihče&quot; &quot;nobody, anybody&quot;, &quot;nič&quot; &quot;nothing, anything&quot;.

A negative pronoun demands a negative predicate, resulting in the so-called double negation:

* &quot;Nihče me nikoli ni maral.&quot; &quot;Nobody ever liked me.&quot;
* &quot;Nikjer ni nikogar.&quot; &quot;There is no one anywhere.&quot;
* &quot;Nič ni resnično.&quot; &quot;Nothing is real.&quot;
* &quot;Od nikogar ne želim ničesar.&quot; &quot;I want nothing from no one.&quot; or more freely &quot;I don&#x27;t want anything from anyone.&quot;
* &quot;Nikogaršnja neolikanost ni nikdar in nikjer in na nikakršen način nikomur pridobila nič drugega kot neodobravanje.&quot; &quot;No one&#x27;s impropriety gained ever anyone anywhere and in whatever way anything else than disapproval.&quot;

===Universal pronouns===

The universal pronouns are &quot;vsakdo&quot; &quot;everyone&quot; and &quot;vse&quot; &quot;everything, all&quot;.

* &quot;Vsemu so namenjali pozornost.&quot; &quot;They dedicated attention to everything.&quot;
* &quot;Vsakogar bodo vrgli iz službe, če ne bo izpolnjeval zahtev.&quot; &quot;They will sack everyone who will not fulfil requirements.&quot;

&quot;Vsak&quot; &quot;each, every&quot; is an adjective that can function as a pronoun. Also in this category are &quot;vsakateri&quot; and &quot;vsakteri&quot;, both meaning &quot;everyone&quot;, which are old-fashioned and not used in modern language.

===Indefinite pronouns===

The indefinite pronoun is derived from the interrogative, and starts with &quot;ne-&quot;: &quot;nekdo&quot; &quot;someone, anyone&quot;, &quot;nekaj&quot; &quot;something, anything&quot;. It refers to an unknown or deliberately untold person or object. The inflection follows the pattern of &quot;kdo&quot; and &quot;kaj&quot;.

* &quot;Nekoga so videli stati ob oknu, a niso mogli ugotoviti, kdo bi to lahko bil.&quot; &quot;They saw someone standing near the window, but they could not figure out who could have been that.&quot;
* &quot;Zgodilo se je nekaj strašnega!&quot; &quot;Something horrible has happened!&quot;
* &quot;Zataknilo se jima je pri nečem, a nikakor se ne morem spomniti, pri čem.&quot; &quot;They faltered at something, but I cannot in any way remember at what.&quot;
* &quot;Nekdo prihaja. Skrijmo se.&quot; &quot;Someone is coming. Let us hide.&quot;

The interrogatives &quot;kdo&quot; and &quot;kaj&quot;, can also refer to any unspecified person or object, or one that can be chosen at will.

* &quot;Sporoči mi, prosim, če se bo kaj spremenilo.&quot; &quot;Please let me know if anything changes.&quot;
* &quot;Seveda dvomim o čem: kaj to ni normalno?&quot; &quot;Naturally I doubt about something: is this not normal?&quot;
* &quot;Česa podobnega še nisem videl!&quot; &quot;I have never seen anything like that!&quot;
* &quot;Uporabi klorovodikovo kislino ali kaj drugega, da nevtraliziraš to bazo.&quot; &quot;Use hydrochloric acid or something else to neutralise this base.&quot;
* &quot;Denar, ki si ga kdo sposodi, seveda ni njegov, pač pa z njim le upravlja.&quot; &quot;Money that someone borrows is obviously not his; he merely manages it.&quot;
* &quot;Naj stopi kdo vendar do tega DJ-ja in ga nekajkrat lopne po glavi.&quot; &quot;May someone go to this DJ and smack him on the head a few times.&quot;
* &quot;Ojej, kakšne lepe govorice! O tem se res moram s kom pogovoriti.&quot; &quot;Oh dear, what beautiful gossip! I really must talk to someone about this.&quot;

===Relative indefinite pronouns===

The relative indefinite pronouns are &quot;kdorkoli&quot; or &quot;kdor koli&quot; (whoever) and &quot;karkoli&quot; or &quot;kar koli&quot; (whatever). The meaning conveyed is very similar to the unspecified pronoun. The inflexion follows the pattern of the relative pronoun with &quot;-koli&quot; or &quot; koli&quot; appended. The space, as shown, is optional, but for sake of consistency, once one method has been adopted, one should not use the other.

* &quot;Kdorkoli pokliče 112, mora znati povedati, kaj je narobe.&quot; &quot;Whoever rings 112 must know how to say what is wrong.&quot;
* &quot;Kogarkoli poslušam od politikov, vsi govorijo iste neumnosti.&quot; &quot;To whichever of these politicians I listen, they all speak the same stupidities.&quot;
* &quot;Karkoli stori, stori to dobro.&quot; &quot;Whatever he/she does, he/she does it well.&quot;

===Manifold pronouns===

The manifold pronouns are &quot;marsikdo&quot; &quot;many (people)&quot; and &quot;marsikaj&quot; &quot;many (things)&quot;. The inflexion follows the basic pattern of &quot;kdo&quot; and &quot;kaj&quot;. Although these pronouns refer to multiple people or things, they are grammatically singular. In addition to &quot;marsi-&quot;, other prefixes are possible, such as &quot;redko-&quot; (&quot;redkokdo&quot; &quot;rarely anyone&quot;), &quot;mnogo-&quot; (&quot;mnogokdo&quot;, same as &quot;marsikdo&quot;, although perhaps somewhat less usual) and &quot;malo-&quot; (&quot;malokdo&quot; &quot;few (people)&quot;).

* &quot;Marsikdo pravi, da je lepše živeti na deželi, a jaz jim seveda ne verjamem.&quot; &quot;Many people say that it is nicer to live in the countryside, but I of course do not believe them.&quot;
* &quot;Res je, da marsičesa ne vem, pa vendar veš ti še mnogo manj.&quot; &quot;It is true that I do not know many things, but you know far less still.&quot;
* &quot;Z marsičim je že bila obdarjena, a česa takšnega, kar ji je prinesel egiptovski odposlanec, ni bila nikdar poprej še videla.&quot; &quot;Many things she had been gifted, but something like that which the Egyptian emissary brought she had never before seen.&quot;
* &quot;Redkokdo bi priznal, da je storil takšno napako.&quot; &quot;Rarely anyone would admit that he has made such a mistake.&quot;
* &quot;Mnogokaj mi je šlo po glavi, a bolje je, da ne povem, kaj.&quot; &quot;Many things went through my mind, but it is better that I do not say which.&quot;
* &quot;Maločesa se loti, če ve, da se popolnosti pri stvari ne da doseči.&quot; &quot;He attempts to do few things if he knows that perfection cannot be achieved at them.&quot;

==Determiners==
===Possessive determiners===

These all inflect as regular adjectives.

Example sentences:
* &quot;Moj bog pravi drugače!&quot; &quot;My god says otherwise!&quot;
* &quot;Njegove oči so kot kupi koruze na polju.&quot; &quot;His eyes are like heaps of maize on a field.&quot;
* &quot;Letalo je bilo last vojske in njene države.&quot; &quot;The aeroplane was the property of the military and her (the military&#x27;s or another person&#x27;s, depending on the context) country.
* &quot;Vaše kraljevo veličanstvo, klanjam se pred Vami.&quot; &quot;Your royal highness, I bow before You.&quot;
* &quot;Cerkev je njen grob na pokopališču prodala, kajti njeni potomci niso imeli dovolj denarja, da bi plačali pristojbino.&quot; &quot;The church has sold her grave at the graveyard, since her descendants did not have enough money to pay the fee.&quot;
* &quot;S tvojim avtom smo šli: saj ne zameriš, kajne?&quot; &quot;We went with your car: you do not resent (us), do you?&quot;

The reflexive determiner &quot;svoj&quot; is used much as the reflexive pronoun is used, to point back to the subject or another word.

* &quot;Stopam v svojo sobo.&quot; &quot;I am walking into my room.&quot;
* &quot;Kupili so jim lepo darilo; vso svojo domiselnost so vložili v njegovo izbiranje.&quot; &quot;They bought them a beautiful gift; all their ingenuity they have invested into its choosing.&quot;
* &quot;Svojega leva je pustila na dežju.&quot; &quot;She left her lion in the rain.&quot;

The reflexive possessive and &#x27;normal&#x27; possessive pronouns make some ambiguous English sentences perfectly clear in Slovene. The sentence &quot;She has taken her towel into the bathroom&quot; can be translated into the following two ways:

* &quot;Njeno brisačo je vzela v kopalnico.&quot; (the towel she has taken belongs to another person)
* &quot;Svojo brisačo je vzela v kopalnico.&quot; (the towel she has taken is her own)

===Other determiners===
Quantitative adverbial pronouns are non-inflected at all times. All other pronouns are normally inflected.

Examples:
* &quot;Čeprav mi je tisti avtobus bolj všeč, moram na tega, kajti tisti drugi vozi v drugo smer.&quot; &quot;Even though I like that bus more, I have to board this one, for that other one is driving in another direction.&quot;
* &quot;Mnogokakšna želja se mi je že uresničila, vendar mi je marsikatera prinesla tudi kakšne stranske neprijetnosti.&quot; &quot;Many a wish has come true for me, however many (a wish) has brought me some side inconveniences.&quot;
* &quot;Vlak, ki smo ga videli, je pravzaprav tisti, na katerega bi se bili morali usesti.&quot; &quot;The train that we have seen is actually the one onto which we should have boarded.&quot; (literally: sat on)
* &quot;čigav svinčnik je to?&quot; &quot;Whose pencil is this?&quot;
* &quot;Nekakšna radirka je bila nameščena na drugem koncu.&quot; &quot;Some type of rubber was mounted on the other end.&quot;
* &quot;Enak kalkulator imam kot ti.&quot; &quot;I have the same type of calculator as you.&quot;
* &quot;Vzemi mnenje, katerega ne odobravaš, in ga poskusi spremeniti.&quot; &quot;Take an opinion that you do not approve of and try to change it.&quot;
* &quot;Nekoliko pozni ste, a nič ne de.&quot; &quot;You are somewhat late, but that is all right.&quot;
* &quot;Zaradi nekega bedaka mi je vsako letalo ušlo.&quot; &quot;Because of some fool, every aeroplane got away from me. (I missed every plane because of some fool; in the sense that this person has taught me to get to an airport too late or similar, not that all planes have left without me.)
* &quot;Toliko truda za nič učinka.&quot; &quot;So much effort to no avail.&quot;</text><links>

<text>The Pacification of Ghent, signed on 8 November 1576, was an alliance between the provinces of the Habsburg Netherlands. The main objectives were to remove Spanish mercenaries who had made themselves hated by all sides due to their plundering, and to promote a formal peace with the rebellious provinces of Holland and Zeeland.

==Background==
In 1566, the Habsburg Netherlands experienced considerable political upheaval and civil unrest, which culminated in the iconoclastic fury of that year. Its ruler, Philip II of Spain, responded by appointing Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba as Governor-general, and in 1567 he arrived there to restore order, accompanied by an army of mercenaries. Philip soon replaced the most important advisors to former regent Margaret of Parma, either by summarily executing those such as the counts of Egmont and Hoorn, or by driving them into exile, as he did to William the Silent. The leader of the royalist faction, Philippe III de Croÿ remained in favor.

At first, Alba had little difficulty in repelling the rebel military incursions, led by William. However, maintaining a large military presence put severe strain on the royal finances, especially because Spain was fighting expensive wars against the Ottoman Sultan and in Italy at the same time. Alba&#x27;s attempts to finance these expenses by new taxes also estranged previously loyal subjects from the royalist cause. Then, in 1572, a group of privateers with letters of marque from William (known as &quot;watergeuzen&quot;) were unexpectedly successful in an invasion into Holland and Zeeland. Orange was able to take over the government in these two provinces under the guise of his old post of royal Stadtholder, and brought them into open revolt against the government in Brussels. This brought about a formal state of war between Holland and Zeeland and the fifteen loyalist provinces.

This civil war was mostly fought with mercenary troops on both sides, with Spanish tercios playing a preponderant role on the royalist side. Because of the dire state of the royal finances, these Spanish mercenaries often went unpaid. They frequently mutinied and pillaged nearby towns, especially following victories. This disaffection with the Brussels government eventually brought about a boil in the summer of 1576.

==Pacification==

In 1573, meanwhile, Alba had been replaced by Luis de Zúñiga y Requesens as governor-general. Requesens was also unable to defeat the rebels. He was in bad health and died in March 1576. This caused a power vacuum in the Brussels government, as the slow communications of the day prevented a speedy replacement from Madrid. Philip appointed his younger brother John of Austria governor-general, but it took him several months to take up this appointment.

During this interim period, the Duke of Aerschot stepped into power. He had already held inconclusive peace talks with Orange, his former colleague in the &quot;Raad van State&quot; (Council of State). When Spanish troops mutinied because of lack of payment and sacked the towns of Zierikzee and Aalst, the States General of the Netherlands was immediately convened by the States of Brabant and County of Hainaut on 8 September 1576 to deal with the mutinous troops. Holland and Zeeland, as rebellious provinces, were not invited. Aerschot, acting in the usurpation of the royal prerogatives, had by then been appointed as head of the Council of State by the States General. This made him acting governor-general. This action was comparable to what Orange had done in Holland and Zeeland, in which royal authority had been usurped by rebels pretending to act &quot;in the name of the king&quot;.

The States General referred to precedent to justify their actions. They had acted similarly after the deaths of Charles the Bold in 1477 and Philip I of Castile in 1506. Now they authorized the provincial states to raise troops to defend against marauding foreign (especially Spanish) mercenaries.

More importantly from the perspective of constitutional history, the States General also embarked on a program of institutional innovation. Previously, the States General only were in session for a few weeks at most. To facilitate its governance in permanent session, they appointed a rotating presidency. The president, selected from one of the provincial delegations, assisted by one or two of the pensionaries, would preside over the meetings for a week at a time. This system continued during the later Dutch Republic and the pensionaries began acting as an executive committee of the States General.

The first order of business for the States General was to bring about peace with the rebel provinces so as to form a common front against the marauding mutineers. Hatred of these marauders united rebel and loyalist alike. The States General, therefore, appointed a committee to negotiate with the Prince of Orange and the provinces of Holland and Zeeland. Because the Prince&#x27;s troops were already invading the province of Flanders, where they were made welcome in the rebellious city of Ghent, the negotiations were held in that city.

The delegates met in the first week of October 1576. The rebels were represented by Paulus Buys, Grand Pensionary of Holland, and Philips of Marnix, lord of Sint-Aldegonde; the States General sent Elbertus Leoninus, a professor at Leuven University, among others. These negotiators had already met during the abortive negotiations at Breda the previous year and therefore knew what the main stumbling blocks for reaching agreement were. They also knew that speed was of the essence because the arrival of the King&#x27;s brother, Don Juan, was imminent (he was to arrive in Luxembourg in early November), and it would be easier to reach agreement if the &quot;royalist&quot; side was not encumbered by his control.

The delegates reached an agreement on 30 October, less than three weeks after the beginning of the negotiations. Its ratification by the States General on 8 November 1576 was undoubtedly hastened by the sack of Antwerp by Spanish mutineers on 4 November, which helped sway many opinions toward ratification.

The preamble of the treaty held the previous Spanish government in Brussels responsible for the war. The provinces of the Netherlands agreed to jointly drive out the Spaniards and their supporters &quot;to restore the citizens to their rights, privileges, and liberties and their former prosperity&quot;.

Article 1 provided for a general amnesty for acts on both sides after the troubles started in 1568. Article 3 provided that, &quot;once the Spaniards had been driven out&quot;, the States General would return the country into the hands of the King, decide the issue of religion (which had been an important cause of dissension), and return all military installations taken by the rebels to the authority of the king. In article 5, they declared that all placards by Alba for the suppression of heresy were revoked, and nobody would be punished for religious offenses before the States General decided the matter of religion. Article 4 provided that, outside Holland and Zeeland, no action against the Catholic religion was to be allowed. The remaining articles dealt with such issues as the free movement of goods and persons, the freeing of prisoners of war, the return of confiscated properties (especially those of the Prince of Orange), the reimbursement of the Prince for his expenses in the conduct of the war against the government troops before 1572, and the problems caused by the need to equalize the inflated currency in Holland and Zeeland with that in the other provinces.

The Pacification, therefore, bore the aspects of both a peace treaty between the rebellious and the &quot;loyal&quot; provinces, and a project for a further defensive union. That further union was concluded on 9 January 1577 by the (first) Union of Brussels.

==Aftermath==

The problem with the Pacification was that the provinces agreed on little, other than the need to confront the marauding mutineers. Once that problem had been solved by the withdrawal of the Spanish tercios to Italy in April 1577, the provinces started to diverge again.

Don Juan signed the Pacification on 12 February 1577, thereby apparently giving royal assent to it. He took care, however, to stress the clauses about maintaining the Catholic religion outside the provinces of Holland and Zeeland. The States General then accepted him as the legitimate governor-general and even agreed to pay the arrears of the royal troops, the refusal of which had arguably been the cause of the problems with the mutineers. This agreement was enshrined in the Edict of 1577.

However, the Edict of 1577 seemed to provide for a return to the &quot;status quo ante&quot; in which the States General would not be permanently in session. Holland and Zeeland protested against this arrangement and refused to submit to it. Neither would they give up the fortresses they had occupied, as provided for in the Pacification. The relations between the new governor-general and the States General also soon deteriorated. The States-General even appointed their governor-general, the Archduke Matthias.

In 1579, Alessandro Farnese became the royalist governor-general. He immediately offered to return to the southern Catholic nobles their original privileges. With the Spanish army under control and their local liberties returned, the Walloon nobles and southern provinces no longer had any reason to rebel. However, the northern, Calvinist-controlled provinces were as unwilling to give up their religion as Philip II was to allow them to practice it. The French-speaking provinces thereby concluded the Union of Arras, prompting the northern provinces to answer with their own Union of Utrecht. These two agreements produced a split between Habsburg Netherlands, never to be reconciled.

<doc id="1301705" wikidata="Q7541723" url="?curid=1301705" title="Slovene punctuation">
<text>Punctuation marks are one or two part graphical marks used in writing, denoting tonal progress, pauses, sentence type (syntactic use), abbreviations, et cetera.

Marks used in Slovene include full stops (.), question marks (?), exclamation marks (!), commas (,), semicolons (;), colons (:), dashes (–), hyphens (-), ellipses (...), different types of inverted commas and quotation marks (⟨“...”⟩, ⟨‘...’⟩, ⟨‚...‘⟩, ⟨„...“⟩, ⟨»...«⟩), brackets ((), [], {}) (which are in syntactical use), as well as apostrophes (&#x27;,’), solidi (/), equal signs (=), and so forth.

==Full stop==
Syntactical use

A full stop (.) is a left-leaning punctuation mark. This means that it &#x27;touches&#x27; the preceding word, but is followed by a space.

It is ordinarily used at the end of a neutral declaratory sentence, be it a real sentence with a predicate or a non-sentence.
* To je bilo včeraj. (This was yesterday.)
* Včeraj. (Yesterday.)

When a statement is articulated, the pitch is cadent, thus decreased towards the end of such a sentence.

In an indicative compound sentence with the last part an independent clause that does not end in a full stop, the full stop is omitted.
* Rekli so mi, naj grem, a kam? (They told me to go, but where?)
** (and not &quot;Rekli so mi, naj grem, a kam?.&quot;)

The final punctuation mark of a quoted sentence (with or without inverted commas) within a declaratory sentence is omitted if the quoted sentence is not preceded by a colon.
* Ko smo hodili po travi, smo opazili prepoved Ne hodi po travi. (When walking on the grass, we noticed the restriction Do not walk on the grass.)
* Ko smo hodili po travi, smo opazili prepoved: Ne hodi po travi!

A full stop is replaced by a comma in direct speech before the accompanying sentence.
* &quot;Oh, mar bi bile ostale doma,&quot; je zamrmrala Marjeta. (&quot;Oh, they/we might as well have stayed home,&quot; muttered Marjeta (Daisy).)

Non-syntactical use

Some abbreviations are, as in American English, always followed by a full stop.
* dr. (doktor; Dr, doctor); npr. (na primer; e.g., for example, exempli gratia); tj. (to je; this is); l. (leto; year); t.i. (tako imenovani; so-called); itn., itd. (in tako naprej, in tako dalje; etc., et cetera, and so on).

However, other abbreviations are, as in American English, never followed by a full stop.
* ZDA (Združene države Amerike; USA, United States of America)
* km (kilometer; km, kilometre)
* Fe (železo; Fe, iron)

Ordinal numerals are followed by a full stop.

Numbers may be separated by leaning full stops in the following cases:
* for time of the day
** Ob 22.15 (&#x27;dvaindvajset petnajst&#x27; or &#x27;dvaindvajsetih in petnajst minut&#x27;) se film konča. (At 22.15 (10.15 pm) the film ends.)
*** 22.15 can also be written as 2215
* to separate thousands from the rest
** 1.000.000 (en milijon; one million, 1,000,000) (but more usual is 1 000 000)
* to show multiplication
** 3 · 9 (tri krat devet; three times nine)
*** note that in this case, the dot is raised to the line centre and is non-leaning

Dates are written with dots separating the day, month and year. Note that the numerical English dates below are British English; American English switches the month and the day. It is important to realise that the full stop is left-leaning; the space is intentional (yet only few are aware of that).
* 1. 10. 2003 (prvi deseti dva tisoč tri, prvi oktober dva tisoč tri; the first of October, two thousand and three, 1/10/2003)
* 25. 6. 1991 (petindvajseti šesti (junij) tisoč devetsto enaindevetdeset; the twenty-fifth of June, nineteen ninety-one, 25/6/1991)
* 30. maj (trideseti maj; the 30th of May)

If a non-syntactical full stop is at the end of a sentence, it is not usual to append another full stop to it; however, doing so is not incorrect.
* Prodajam časopise, avtobusne žetone, zobne ščetke itd. (I sell newspapers, bus tokens, toothbrushes, etc.)
* Prodajam časopise, avtobusne žetone, zobne ščetke itd..

==Ellipsis==
Syntactical use

An ellipsis (in Slovene, literally &#x27;three dots&#x27;) (...) is a non-leaning punctuation mark. It expresses omission of words.
* Nekaj sem govorila ... (I was saying something ...)
* ... kaj to ni res? (... is this not true?)
* Heh ... česa vsega ne pove. (Heh ... whatever he/she says.)
* Ja ... in? (Yes ... so?)
* Saj bi šel, pa ... (I/He would go, but ...) (an alternative is to write this thus: &quot;Saj bi šel, pa –)

Any other punctuation may or may not be appended; a full stop is usually (but not always) omitted, but other punctuation normally remains:
* Da … or Da …. (Yes …)
* O, a tako je bilo …? (Oh, it was so …?)

When emphasising that whatever has been left out is a subsequent omission not performed by the original author, the ellipsis is enclosed in round or square brackets ((), []), or, more often, in solidi (//).
* The original sentence in full: &quot;Nekaj mi šepeta, nekaj točno določenega, skoraj čutiti bi se dalo, da gre ta šolska ura h koncu.&quot; (Something is whispering to me, something exactly defined, it can almost be felt, that this period is nearing completion.)
** Nekaj mi šepeta /.../ da gre ta šolska ura h koncu. (Something is whispering to me /.../ that this period is nearing completion.)

An ellipsis may indicate an inserted sentence, though a dash is more often used in such cases:
* Lepo je bilo ... kako tudi ne? ..., saj je dež nežno padal, mi pa smo tesno drug ob drugem ležali ob kaminu. (It was nice ... how wouldn&#x27;t it be? ... for the rain was gently falling, and we were lying closely to one another near the fireplace.)
** Lepo je bilo – kako tudi ne? –, saj je dež nežno padal, mi pa smo tesno drug ob drugem ležali ob kaminu.

An ellipsis usually indicates pausing or abrupt interruption. When used as a sentence closing punctuation mark, the pitch is cadent, thus decreased towards the end of such a sentence, or semi-cadent, indicating a half-finished thought, or there is no change in pitch.

Non-syntactical use

A non-syntactical ellipsis is left-leaning, and expresses omission of a word part.

* Otorinola... – ne vem naprej. (Otorhinola... – I don&#x27;t know further.) (probably otorinolaringolog; otorhinolaryngologist)
* Tristo kosmatih med... (Three hundred hairy be...) (&quot;Tristo kosmatih medvedov&quot; (Three hundred hairy bears) is a traditional – and one of the few present in Slovene – profanity, though rather innocent and extremely seldom used.)

==Exclamation mark==
Syntactical use

An exclamation mark (!) is a left-leaning punctuation mark. It is used as a closing punctuation mark of emphatic sentences and clauses, and as a non-closing punctuation mark finishing inserted sentences. They are typical of imperative mood, but only if emotionally charged.

* Gregor, utihni! (Gregor, shut up!)
* Mojbog! (My god!)
* Na pomoč! (Help!)
* Pleši, pleši, dokler ti petke dopuste! (Dance, dance, as long as your shoe heels allow for that!)
* To se mi je zdela odlična ideja! (That I thought a marvellous idea!)
* Spoštovani! (Respected! (at the beginning of a letter, though more usual is &quot;Spoštovani,&quot;))
* Ubil te bom! (I shall kill you!)
* Če mi še kdaj izustiš kaj takega ...! (If you ever say something like that again ...!)
* Mnogo let nazaj – joj, da bi le že pozabila na to! – sem živela na kmetiji. (Many years ago – oh, if only I should forget this already! – I lived on a farm.)
* Reci mu vendar, naj pride domov! (Tell him to come home! – the exclamation mark is likely bound to &#x27;come home&#x27;, however, and not &#x27;tell&#x27;)
* Zrecitiraj Kons V! (Recite Kons V!) (But: &quot;Zrecitiraj: Kons V.&quot;)
* &quot;Gremo!&quot; je vzkliknila Janja. (&quot;Let&#x27;s go!&quot; exclaimed Janja.)

See the note on the use of the combination with a question mark below under question mark. One may use the combination &quot;!!&quot; (or even more exclamation marks) to express further exclamatory mood.

* Kaj?! (What?!)
* Izgini!! (Get lost!!)

Non-syntactical use

An exclamation mark may be used for emphasis of a certain point in a text.
* Morda je to res, a emancipacijo (!) testov smo pričakovali. (Perhaphs that is true, but the emancipation (!) of tests has been expected. – used to emphasise a word used, which should probably be &quot;evalvacijo&quot; (evaluation))
* Nuna (!) je strastno govorila o umetnosti ljubljenja. (The nun (!) passionately talked about the art of making love.)

==Question mark==
Syntactical use

A question mark (?) is a left-leaning punctuation mark. It is used in single clause sentences and in compound sentences in which the independent clause expresses enquiries.

* Si res želiš, Ana, dobiti enojko? (Do you, Ana, really wish to get a one (the worst grade at school)?)
* Tukaj? (Here?)
* Oh, kaj res? (Oh, really? (in a bored tone))
* Rok, kam greš? (Rok, whither are you going? (normally, the English would say &#x27;Where&#x27;, but it is important to distinguish between &quot;whither&quot; (kam) and &quot;where&quot; (kje) in Slovene))
* Pogovarjali smo se, bilo je zelo zanimivo, potem pa je Luka nenadoma rekel – uganeš kaj? (We had been talking, it had been very interesting, but then Luka suddenly said – guess what?)
* &quot;Je to res, Urša?&quot; je zavpil professor. (&quot;Is this true, Urša?&quot; shouted the professor.)

When a question without a question word or with &quot;ali&quot;, or with &quot;??&quot; or &quot;?!&quot; is articulated, the pitch is anticadent, thus increased towards the end of such a sentence. Otherwise, the pitch is cadent, thus decreased towards the end of such a sentence.

If the independent clause of a sentence is not interrogative, the sentence ends with a full stop or an exclamation mark. This is similar to reported speech in English.
* Vprašali so me, če grem peš ali s taksijem. (They asked me if I should walk or go by taxi.)
* O čem se gre predstava, tega pač ne vem. (What the performance is about, that I just don&#x27;t know. (with the implied meaning that the original question is stupid, for how am I to know?))

After a colon, the clause keeps its own punctuation mark.
* Čigav je že izrek: Užij dan. (Whose is, again, the saying, Seize the day?)
** This sentence can also be written as &quot;Čigav je že izrek Užij dan?&quot; or &quot;Čigav je že izrek &#x27;Užij dan&#x27;?&quot;.

A question mark need not be a sentence terminating punctuation mark; it may be used in inserted sentences.
* Govorim o hibridizaciji sp² – to veš, kaj je? – ogljikovega atoma v tej organski molekuli. (I am talking about the sp² hybridisation – do you know what this is? – of the carbon atom in this organic molecule.)

In certain cases, the question mark may be doubled (for emphasis of a repeated question), or it may be combined with an exclamation mark in emphatic and emotional contexts.
* Kako narediš to? Kako?? (How do you do this? How??)
* Le kako si lahko dovoliš kaj takega?! (However can you allow yourself something like that?!)

Non-syntactical use

A question mark can be used non-syntactically if it denotes doubt.
* Dejali so, da se je nafta (?) razlila. (They have said that oil (?) has spilt.) (the speaker is not certain whether it was oil or something else, or perhaps if this is indeed how the word is spelt)

==Colon==
Syntactical use

A colon (:) is a left-leaning punctuation mark. It is used in various ways as described below.

1. to introduce direct speech after an accompanying sentence
* Zadregetala je od same jeze: &quot;Kaj? Tako drago?&quot; (She shivered with pure anger: &quot;What? So expensive?&quot;)
* Kot v zboru so dejali: Seveda. (As though in a choir they said: Naturally.)
* Kot v zboru so dejali: &quot;Seveda.&quot;
* Estragon: Pejva. (Estragon: Let&#x27;s go.) (from Samuel Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; (Čakajoč Godota))
2. in enumeration, expatiation or explanation
* So stvari, o katerih ne vem popolnoma nič: fiziologija, oftalmologíja, socialna antropologija. (There are things I know absolutely nothing about: physiology, ophthalmology, social anthropology.)
* Potrebuje se: moka, mleko, med in sojina omaka. (Needed are: flour, milk, honey and soya sauce.) – this may also be written as &quot;Potrebuje se moka, mleko, med in sojina omaka.&quot;
* Zahvaliti se želim še posebej: (I wish to thank especially:)
** Jožetu,
** Pulheriji,
** Cvetki,
** Cirilu.
* Sodelujemo vsi: to vključuje tudi tebe, Metka. (Everyone participates: this includes you, Metka.)
* To je lepo: neizmerna umetnina. (This is beautiful: an unmeasurable piece of art.) – this may also be written as &quot;To je lepo, in pri tem neizmerna umetnina.&quot; (This is beautiful, and an unmeasurable piece of art at that.) or similarly
* Rekel sem: ne rekel, vzkliknil! (I said: not said, exclaimed!) – this may also be written as &quot;Rekel sem – ne rekel, vzkliknil!&quot; or &quot;Rekel sem, ne rekel, vzkliknil!&quot;
* V najbolj preprosti obliki ti povem, ker vem, da ne razumeš dobro: spelji se mi izpred oči. (I tell you in the simplest form, for I know you do not understand well: get out of my sight.)
3. optionally after form data
* Ime in priimek: (Name and surname:)
* Datum: (Date:)

When a colon is encountered in reading, the pitch is semi-cadent, thus decreased.

Non-syntactical use

1. for the meaning &#x27;proti&#x27; (to, against) (usually non-leaning):
* Rezultat je bil 1 : 2 [ena proti dva]. (The result was 1 : 2.)
* Množini ogljika in klorove (VII) kisline sta v razmerju 1 : 1 [ena proti ena]. (The amounts of carbon and chloric (VII) acid are in the ratio 1 : 1.)
2. for the meaning &#x27;deljeno&#x27; (divided):
* 15 : 3 = 5 (petnajst deljeno s tri je pet) (fifteen divided by three is five)

==Inverted comma==
An inverted comma („ “) is a two part left- and right-leaning punctuation mark. There are many types of inverted commas used in Slovene texts, videlicet:

* standard double up-down: „ABC“
* standard single up-down: ‚ABC‘
* line centred double (used in some printed material): »ABC«
* line centred single (used in some printed material): ›ABC‹
* double up (used in some printed material): &quot;ABC&quot; or ”ABC“
* single up (used in some printed material): &#x27;ABC&#x27; or ’ABC‘

The most prominent use of inverted commas is direct speech.
* „Potem pa kar grem,“ je zaihtel Jaka. (&quot;Then I shall just be on my way,&quot; sobbed Jaka.)
* Jaka je zaihtel: „Potem pa kar grem.“
* „Potem pa,“ je zaihtel Jaka, „kar grem.“

Inverted commas are positioned so that the first one is right-leaning, and the second one is left-leaning, coming after the ending punctuation mark of the direct speech sentence. If what the inverted commas enclose is not a sentence in itself but only a part thereof, the second inverted comma stands left-leaning directly to the ending character. This is the same as in the so-called British or logical quoting.
* „Dobro jutro,“ je pohitel novi assistant. (&quot;Good morning,&quot; hurried the new assistant.)
* Govorili so o „nekem blaznem načrtu“. (They were talking about &quot;some crazy plan&quot;.)

If there is no accompanying sentence, inverted commas may be replaced with a dash:
* – Potem pa kar grem.

When the direct speech includes another direct speech, different types of inverted commas ought to be used, or the inner ones may be omitted if the context is clear.
* Začela je: „Uganeš, kaj mi je tista ostudna pošast rekla? Rekla je: ‚Potem pa kar jutri pridi. Bo v redu?‘“ (She started: &quot;Can you guess what that hideous monster told me? She (&#x27;monster&#x27; is feminine) said: &#x27;Then just come tomorrow. Will that be all right?&#x27;&quot;)
* Začela je: ‚Uganeš, kaj mi je tista ostudna pošast rekla? Rekla je: „Potem pa kar jutri pridi. Bo v redu?“‘
* Začela je: »Uganeš, kaj mi je tista ostudna pošast rekla? Rekla je: „Potem pa kar jutri pridi. Bo v redu?“«

Inverted commas are also used when trying to stress a curious use of a word: that is, to illustrate that a word is not used as it normally is, or simply to emphasise it. Usually, in printed texts, such words are printed either &quot;italic&quot; or bold as opposed to using excessive quotes.
* Pravi „prijatelj“ je. (He is a real &quot;friend&quot;.)
* Kaj pa pravzaprav pomeni „svoboda“? (What does &quot;freedom&quot; actually mean anyway?)
* Ne vem, zakaj govori o „alternative medicine“; kot da bi bilo tako težko reči „alternativna medicina“. (I do not know why he/she is talking about &quot;alternative medicine&quot; (left intact); as though it is so difficult to say &quot;alternative medicine&quot;.)
* Accusative &#x27;tožilnik&#x27; je velikokrat združen z dative &#x27;dajalnikom&#x27; v oblique &#x27;predmetni&#x27; sklon. (The accusative is often merged with the dative into the oblique case. – notice that in this case, single up inverted commas are used)

Inverted commas are also used to mark proper nouns that could be mistaken for common nouns, such as at sentence beginnings.
* „Sonetni venec“ je zelo zapleten. (The &quot;Wreath of Sonnets&quot; is very complex. – referring likely to Prešeren&#x27;s wreath of sonnets by that name)
** But: Prešernov Sonetni venec je zelo zapleten. (Prešeren&#x27;s Wreath of Sonnets is very complex.)

==Dash==
A dash (–) is a one or two part non-leaning punctuation mark (except where noted). Semantically, there is no difference between the longer and the shorter dash, – and –, although common usage prefers the shorter one in all cases except upon connection of unrelated sentences. In electronic writing, a hyphen may be used instead of a dash.

A dash usually indicates pausing or abrupt interruption. When used as a sentence closing punctuation mark, the pitch is cadent, thus decreased towards the end of such a sentence, or semi-cadent, indicating a half-finished thought, or there is no change in pitch.

A dash can be used instead of a comma to emphasise separation words and clauses. Note that in example 2, unlike in English, the end of the appositive is unmarked in Slovene.
* Smrt fašizmu – svoboda narodu! (Death to fascism – freedom to the nation!)
* O problemu individuacija – rast sebstva po Frommu smo morali pisati esej. (We had to write an essay on the problem &#x27;individuation – growth of self&#x27; as per Fromm.)

It is also used when inserting sentences or including additional information.
* Subtilna občutja – to je, nežna in občutljiva – se očividno izražajo v prebranem delu. (Subtile emotions – that is, gentle and delicate – are apparently expressed in the read work.) (note that the word &#x27;subtile&#x27; in this sense in English is somewhat old-fashioned)
* Da – tako je tudi res bilo –, in to sem mu jasno povedala. (Yes – and it really was so, too –, and I told him that clearly.)
* Joj, prejoj – občutljivi kot smo bili – sneg je zapadel in zeblo nas je. (Oh dear and even more so – sensitive as we were – snow had fallen and we were feeling cold.)

Sentence punctuation is not changed when using dashes, so an inserted sentence before a comma is usually followed by a comma nonetheless, even though some might see this usage as rather pedantic.

A dash at the end of a sentence marks an abrupt end, a breaking of thought or unwillingness to continue:
* Zapeti bi bila morala, pa – (I should have sung, but –)
* Če v bližnji prihodnosti, kolega Novak, ne zaprete svojega kljunčka, bomo prisiljeni izvesti določene sankcije, kot so, denimo, mučenje ali preprost izgon: svarim Vas: bodite tiho, če ne –! (If you, colleague Novak (likely a university student), do not close your beak (sarcastic for mouth), we shall be forced to impose certain sanctions, such as, let us say, torture or a simple exile: I am warning you: be silent, or else –!)

In sentences without a predicate, a dash can represent the connexion between the subject and the object.
* Vino – strup ali zdravilo? (Wine – poison or medicine?)

A dash can introduce direct speech if there is no accompanying sentence before direct speech itself.

A dash sometimes separates multiple surnames, though it is more usual to merely use a space. A dash is still used when listing an alias after a full name, but only if this alias does not function as a surname. In these senses, a dash is a leaning punctuation mark.
* Katarina Čkorjanc–Vesel (or Katarina Čkorjanc-Vesel, or, as it is oftenest, Katarina Čkorjanc Vesel)
* Josip Broz–Tito
* Karel Veliki (Charles the Great)
* Karel Plešasti (Charles the Bald)

Similarly, a leaning dash is used in other instances where words are closely connected to one another and both parts are inflected.
* Kozina–Hrpelje (&#x27;Kozina in Hrpelje&#x27;, two places)

A dash also expresses the meaning of &#x27;to&#x27; or &#x27;up to&#x27; or &#x27;until&#x27;:
* cena: 1000–1200 SIT (the price: SIT 1000–1200)
* &quot;Otroci, na vlaku Trst–Dunaj zaspite. Tam vmes ničesar ni.&quot; (Children, on the train Triest–Vienna, go to sleep. There is nothing in between.) (Tomaž Šalamun)
* Za domačo nalogo boste rešili naloge 272–279. (For homework, you will do exercises 272–279.)
* Delovni čas: 0–24 (Opening hours: 0–24)

A dash is used as the symbol for minus, although the separate minus sign is also used:
* 5x² – 5x – 1 = 0
* –2 °C

Dashes may introduce lists. For example:&lt;br&gt;
– prvi primer,&lt;br&gt;
– drugi primer,&lt;br&gt;
– tretji primer.

==Hyphen==
A hyphen (- or ‐) is a leaning punctuation mark (except where noted).

In compound words that would otherwise use the word &quot;in&quot; (and) between the parts, a hyphen is used:
* zeleno-moder pulover (a green and blue jumper)
** but &#x27;zelenomoder pulover&#x27; if the colour is a mix of green and blue (thus also &#x27;etnocentričen&#x27; (ethnocentric), not &#x27;etno-centričen&#x27;, since one cannot add an &#x27;and&#x27; in between the words)
* slovensko-nemški slovar (a Slovene-German dictionary)
* angleško-francoski konflikt (an English-French conflict)
* črno-belo tiskanje (black-and-white printing)

A hyphen is also used as in the following examples:
* Janko Novak-Rovtar (as an equivalent to a dash; see above)
* 30-letnica (30th anniversary or a woman in her thirties)
* TV-oddaja (television programme)
* tri- in petdnevni tečaji (three and five day courses)
* avtonomija in -kracija (autonomy and autocracy)
* ATP, ATP-ja (inflexion of symbols and acronyms)
* le-to, le-tak, le-tako, ka-li
* Pri m-ju se ji vedno zatakne. (She always falters at m (in the alphabet).)

Hyphens are used non-syntactially in syllabification, when marking stems, suffixes, prefixes and similar (many examples at declensions above) and in prices (1000,- SIT (which is the same as 1000,0 SIT)).

The same character under the name of &quot;deljaj&quot; marks word division over two lines. At the end of a line, a word may be spelt only to the end of a certain syllable, followed by the left-leaning - or = character (sometimes, although not often, the character / is also used for this purpose), with the rest of the word following in the next line. If the last character in a line is a plus (+), a dash (–), a solidus (/), a times or division sign (·, :), an equal sign (=), a hyphen (-), or similar, the same character is repeated at the beginning of the next line.

* Prišli smo do polovice odstavka, ko je Marijino jec-&lt;br&gt;ljanje prešlo meje normale.
: We read through the first half of the paragraph when Marija&#x27;s stammering exceeded the boundaries of normality.
* (17 + 15) + 3 =&lt;br&gt;= 17 + (15 + 3) =&lt;br&gt;= 35

==Bracket==
Syntactical use

A bracket ((), //, ||, [], &lt;&gt; and {}) is a two part one-side leaning punctuation mark. The introducing bracket, known as &quot;uklepaj&quot;, is right-leaning; the closing bracket, &quot;zaklepaj&quot;, is left-leaning. Round brackets are those used most often in writing.

Brackets are used to envelop text which is the following:
# a variation or supplement: Klorovodikova kislina (HCl) je nevarna. (Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is dangerous.) Tekst (besedilo) smo prečistili. (We cleaned the text (and a more Slovene word for text in brackets).)
# inserted sentences or clauses: Takoj zatem (če se prav spominjam) se je zabliskalo. (Straight afterwards (if I recall correctly) lightning struck.) Druga svetovna vojna (1939–45) je terjala mnogo krvi. (The second world war (1939–45) demanded much blood.) – dashes, ellipses or commas are also used in this sense
# word parts (in this case it may be fully leaning): Spoštovani/a gost(ja)! (Dear guest! (the feminine form is what is in the brackets))

Essentially, a thing to be borne in mind is that whatever is inside brackets may be left out with no change in meaning.

The cadence of pitch before a bracket is rising (cadent) when what is inside brackets is a variation, otherwise it is falling (anticadent). If brackets contain a fully-fledged sentence, the cadence is as per the sentence punctuation.

Non-syntactical use

A terminating bracket can be used in lists:

Izberite pravilni odgovor:
a) kopje,
b) lokomotiva,
c) disk.

(Choose the correct answer:
a) spear,
b) locomotive,
c) discus.)

==Solidus==
A solidus (/) is a leaning punctuation mark. It has the following meanings:

# &quot;or&quot;: Bolezen se prepozna po rumeni/rjavkasti lisi na čelu. (The disease can be recognised by the yellow/brownish stripe on the forehead.)
# &quot;through&quot;: Sodni zapis 55/2. (Court record 55/2.)
# partly one thing and partly the other: Poslovno leto 2000/01 je bilo katastrofalno. (The fiscal year 2000/01 was disastrous.)
# separating verses when written in one line (non-leaning): Ko brez miru okrog divjam, / prijatlji prašajo me, kam? (I drift in dark unrest and pain, / &#x27;Where now?&#x27; you ask, and ask again. (France Preseren, Kam?))

<text>An assistant surgeon, also known as a surgical assistant, surgeon&#x27;s assistant, assistant in surgery or first assistant, is a healthcare professional who provides direct manual and/or instrumental assistance to meet the in-procedure demands of a surgeon during a surgical operation. Most surgical assistants are trainee surgeons or junior doctors, but In the United Kingdom, a &quot;surgical care practitioner&quot;, who is not a qualified doctor, may perform simple surgical operations under the supervision of one.

In the United States, the American College of Surgeons supports the concept that, ideally, the first assistant at the operating table should be a qualified surgeon or a resident in an approved surgical training program. Residents who have appropriate levels of training should be provided with opportunities to assist and participate in operations. If such assistants are unavailable, other physicians who are experienced in assisting may participate or a qualified practitioner licensed in the role of surgical assistant. The American College of Surgeons maintains that a physician who assists with an operation should be trained to participate in and actively assist the surgeon in safely completing the operation. When a surgeon is unavailable to serve as an assistant, a qualified surgical resident or other qualified health care professional, such as a nurse practitioner or physician assistant with experience in assisting, may participate in operations, according to the ACS Statements on Principles. A qualified practitioner is defined as any licensed practitioner with sufficient training to conduct a delegated portion of a procedure without the need for more experienced supervision, according to the ACS Statements on Principles. The U.S. Bureau of Labor defines surgical assistants as individuals that assist in operations, under the supervision of surgeons. They may, in accordance with state laws, help surgeons to make incisions and close surgical sites, manipulate or remove tissues, implant surgical devices or drains, suction the surgical site, place catheters, clamp or cauterize vessels or tissue, and apply dressings.

<text>The Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts (HKAPA) is a provider of tertiary education in Hong Kong. Located near the north coast of Wan Chai on Hong Kong Island, the main campus also functions as a venue for performances. Bethanie, which is the site of the institution&#x27;s Landmark Heritage Campus in Pok Fu Lam, has housed the School of Film and Television since 2007.

The academy provides practice-based and professional diploma, advanced diploma, undergraduate and postgraduate studies in Chinese opera, dance, drama, film and television, music, and theatre and entertainment arts. Its educational policy reflects the cultural diversity of Hong Kong with an emphasis on Chinese and Western traditions and interdisciplinary learning. The academy ranks 1st in Asia for four consecutive years and 10th in the world for two consecutive years in 2022 QS World University Rankings by Subject (Performing Arts).

Every year, the academy enrols approximately 750 students for its full-time programmes and around 770 students for its Junior Music Programme and Gifted Young Dancer Programme. Furthermore, its extensive EXCEL (Extension and Continuing Education for Life) programme offers part-time personal enrichment courses and in-service professional training to nearly 8,000 students each year.

==History==
In early 1981, the Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club informed Governor Murray MacLehose that it was willing to fund another project of a comparable scale to its recent major undertakings, which included the Ocean Park and the Jubilee Sports Centre. The government responded with a proposal to develop an academy for the performing arts. The academy would complement the performing arts spaces being opened across the territory by the Urban Council, and provide opportunities for creative youth just as the Jubilee Sports Centre was developed to serve young sportspeople.

On 15 September 1981, the Jockey Club formally announced plans to build the academy on a piece of vacant land in Wan Chai, granted by the government, between HMS Tamar and the Hong Kong Arts Centre. The academy was established in 1984. In the early 1990s, the APA became a degree-granting institution.

The main campus was designed by local firm Simon Kwan and Associates, who were among six firms invited to submit designs in a limited competition. It comprises the Academy Block, the Theatre Block, and the Administration Block. The Administration Block was ready for occupation in July 1985. The Academy Block was formally opened on 18 September 1985 by Governor Edward Youde. The Theatre Block was opened by the Duchess of Kent on 3 February 1986, the same day the inaugural opera season began as part of the 1986 Hong Kong Arts Festival. The 1981 model produced for the architectural competition is now held by the M+ museum.

In 2006 the academy established a second campus at Béthanie in Pok Fu Lam. It mainly houses specialist facilities for the School of Film and Television.

The original campus was designed for a student population of 600 students. The academy has been facing space constraints as enrolment has gradually risen, prompting planning for campus expansion. The 334 Scheme further exacerbated the problem. In June 2012 the Legislative Council approved funding of $444.8 million for construction of a nine-storey annex block, and other campus improvements, presently under construction. The expansion will house classrooms, studios, laboratories, music rooms, offices, workshops and support facilities.

The academy is working with the West Kowloon Cultural District, which is under construction, on education plans and venue usage.

==Governance==
The academy is governed under the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts Ordinance, passed in 1984 by the Legislative Council. Under the legislation the academy is mandated to &quot;foster and provide for training, education and research in the performing arts and related technical arts&quot;. The governing body of the institution is called the Council of The Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts, which is responsible for appointing a director, who oversees the day-to-day operation of the academy.

The academy is funded through tuition fees as well as a subvention provided by the Home Affairs Bureau. This arrangement differs from most other post-secondary institutions in the territory, which are funded by the University Grants Committee.

Kevin Thompson was director of the academy from 2004 to 2012. During his tenure the institute forged international links, including arrangements with the Juilliard School in New York City as well as mainland colleges, and introduced master&#x27;s degrees in performing arts disciplines. Thompson also initiated planning for campus expansion. Professor Adrian Walter, was recruited in 2012. He had been the dean of music at the Australian National University in Canberra since 2008. Professor Gillian Choa succeeded as the new director of the academy with effect from 1 January 2021. Professor Choa is the first female director since the establishment of the academy in 1984.

==Academic units==

The academy offers academic programmes from diploma/foundation to master&#x27;s degree level in six faculties:

* School of Chinese Opera
* School of Dance
* School of Drama
* School of Film and Television
* School of Music
* School of Theatre and Entertainment Arts

<doc id="1301732" wikidata="Q1342063" url="?curid=1301732" title="Toyota 4Runner">
<text>The Toyota 4Runner is an SUV manufactured by the Japanese automaker Toyota and marketed globally since 1984, across six generations. In Japan, it was marketed as the and was withdrawn from the market in 2009. The original 4Runner was a compact SUV and little more than a Toyota Hilux pickup truck with a fiberglass shell over the bed, but the model has since undergone significant independent development into a cross between a compact and a mid-size SUV. All 4Runners have been built in Japan at Toyota&#x27;s plant in Tahara, Aichi, or at the Hino Motors (a Toyota subsidiary) plant in Hamura.

The name &quot;4Runner&quot; was created by copywriter Robert Nathan with the Saatchi &amp; Saatchi advertising company as a play on the term &quot;forerunner&quot;. The agency held contests to invent new names for Toyota&#x27;s forthcoming vehicles. According to Toyota, the &quot;4&quot; described the vehicle&#x27;s 4-wheel drive system while &quot;Runner&quot; was a reference to its all-terrain capabilities and how it could &quot;run&quot; off-road.

For some markets, the Hilux Surf was replaced in 2005 by the lower cost but similar Fortuner, which is based on the Hilux platform.

, the 4Runner is marketed in the Bahamas, Bolivia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Panama, Peru, the United States and Venezuela. Many markets that did not receive the 4Runner, such as Europe and the Middle East, instead received the similarly designed Land Cruiser Prado, another SUV that shared many of the same components.

The 4Runner came in at number five in a 2019 study by iSeeCars.com ranking the longest-lasting vehicles in the US. The 4Runner had 3.9 percent of vehicles over , according to the study.

== Predecessor: Toyota Trekker (N30; 1981–1983) ==

Toyota had partnered with third-party recreational vehicle manufacturers at least as early as 1973, when a Chinook Mobilodge-built popup truck camper was paired with the longbed Toyota truck chassis and sold as a less expensive, more economical alternative to larger motorhomes. In the Chinook conversion, the bed and rear wall of the cab were removed and a fiberglass popup shell was added, allowing occupants to walk through from the motorhome section to the cab.

The Trekker was a similar &quot;walk-through&quot; third-party conversion of the short-bed Toyota Hilux truck, built by Winnebago Industries from 1981 to 1983. Winnebago removed the rear wall and added a bench seat in the bed, protecting these occupants by a permanently-fixed fiberglass shell; in concept, it was similar to the Chevrolet K5 Blazer. The Trekker competed with similar third-party limited production Toyota conversions including the Breaker-Breaker and Trailblazer. The Trekker was discontinued in 1984 once Toyota started producing and selling the 4Runner SUV; these third-party conversions had in essence acted as marketing test vehicles for the 4Runner.

===Production===
After the Land Cruiser FJ40 was discontinued, Jack Safro, who operated a Toyota dealer in Brookfield, Wisconsin, approached Winnebago with the idea to convert the Hilux into a four-passenger vehicle as a potential replacement. The resulting Trekker was produced from early 1981 through 1983. In total, approximately 1200–1500 Trekkers were built and sold in the United States, with many shipped to Colorado. An additional unknown number of Trekker kits, likely less than 200, were shipped to Canada to be installed on Canadian trucks at the dealerships. 20 to 30 of the Trekker kits were sold and shipped to Saudi Arabia for installation.

Toyota shipped all trucks from Japan as cab and chassis in order to avoid the 25% assembled truck customs tax. All Trekkers were built on the short wheelbase Hilux chassis. The trucks destined for production as Trekkers were shipped to the dealership handling the national distribution of the Trekker. From there they went to Winnebago to have the Trekker conversion installed, returned after completion to the dealership for national distribution. Most of the Trekker conversions sold went to the west coast of the United States.

===Specifications===
The Trekker conversion involved removing the bed and rear cab wall from the donor truck, then replacing them with a fiberglass tub, bed sides, a non-removable canopy and rear hatch. The kit included a folding rear seat that could be folded forward to lay flat and add cargo space to the back. There was no tailgate on the Trekkers. The factory Toyota vinyl cab headliner was replaced and matched to the custom rear canopy headliner. Suggested retail price in 1981 was .

All Trekkers were given the SR5 trim designation by both Winnebago and Toyota, regardless of the actual VIN denotation. Originally there were to be Deluxe (Model 7141) and Deluxe SR5 (Model 7147) versions of the Trekker; the SR5 was to be equipped with a 5-speed manual transmission, vented canopy windows, and a more finished rear interior than the Deluxe, which was to be equipped with a 4-speed manual and fixed windows. Regardless of trim level, all 1981 Trekkers had vented canopy windows. Non-vented canopy windows were installed on the Trekker for the 1982 model year (again, regardless of trim level) because the forward-facing vent windows on the 1981 Trekkers developed leaks.

As tested by &quot;Truckin″&quot; in 1981, the observed fuel consumption was in combined (city and highway) driving, dropping to with off-road use. The enclosed cargo area was with the rear bench folded.

== First generation (N60; 1983) ==

For the first generation N60 series Hilux Surf and export specification 4Runner introduced in 1983, Toyota, instead of developing an entirely new model, modified the existing Hilux (N50/N60/N70) with short-bed pickup body. The Hilux had undergone a major redesign in 1983 for the 1984 model year. Compared to the pickup, the Surf/4Runner changes included the removal of the panel with integrated rear window from behind the front seats, and adding rear seats, a roll bar, and a removable fiberglass canopy.

The concept was borrowed from both the second generation Ford Bronco, and the Chevrolet K5 Blazer, which were both based on existing short-bed pickup trucks with the addition of removable fiberglass shells over the rear sections and bench seats installed in the back. Like the Bronco and the Blazer, the Hilux Surf/4Runner also removed the rear wall behind the front seats in the corresponding pickup trucks. In that sense, all three vehicles were more modified than simply adding a fiberglass shell to conventional pickup trucks.

Thus, the first generation is nearly mechanically identical to the Toyota Hilux 4×4. All first generation 4Runners had two doors and were indistinguishable from the pickups from the dashboard forward. Nearly all changes were to the body behind the B-pillar; in fact, because the rear springs were not upgraded to bear the additional weight from the rear seats and fiberglass top, early models tended to suffer from a sagging rear suspension.

===History===
In North America, they were sold for the 1984½ model year starting from May 1984. For this first year (March to July 1984 production), all models were equipped with black or white fiberglass tops. The base (DX) model omitted the rear seat. An SR5 trim package was offered that upgraded the interior: additional gauges, better fabrics, and a rear seat were standard with the package. All 1984½ models were equipped with the carbureted 2.4 L &quot;22R&quot; I4 engine, paired with a 5-speed manual transmission; all were available with a four-wheel-drive system that drove the front wheels through a solid front axle with manual locking hubs.

The Hilux Surf was offered in two trim lines (SR and SSR), with either a 2.0 L &quot;3Y&quot; gasoline or 2.4 L &quot;2L&quot; diesel engine.

The 1985 model year (which began production in August 1984) saw the arrival of the electronically fuel-injected 2.4 L &quot;22R-E&quot; (and &quot;22R-EC&quot; with California emissions controls). This increased the power output from for the &quot;22R&quot; to for the &quot;22R-E&quot;, though the carbureted engine remained available until 1988. Additionally, rear seats were available in all 1985 4Runner trim levels, not just the more upscale SR5.

For the 1986 model year, the Surf/4Runner underwent a major front suspension design change as it was changed from a solid front axle to the Hi-Trac independent front suspension. Track width was also increased by three inches. These changes made the trucks more comfortable on-road, and improved stability and handling. The new suspension also increased the space in the engine compartment (necessary to fit larger engines, such as the V6 introduced in 1987) but arguably decreased the truck&#x27;s off-road capabilities. The North American specification Toyota Pickup also adopted this new suspension, but the regular Hilux for other markets at this point retained the more rugged and capable, if less refined, solid axle configuration. With the 1986 update, the Surf/4Runner grille changed from the three segment type to the two segment grille. Tops were color-matched on blue, red and some gold models, while other body colors were still sold with black or white tops.

A turbocharged version of the &quot;22R-E&quot; engine (the &quot;22R-TE&quot;) was also introduced in the 1986 model year, increasing output to , although this engine is significantly rarer than the base &quot;22R-E&quot;. With the &quot;22R-TE&quot;, the 4Runner was rated at on the city driving cycle; testing showed real-world economy was . It appears that all turbocharged 4Runner models sold in the US were equipped with an automatic transmission, though a five-speed manual could still be ordered in the turbocharged pickups. Most turbocharged 4Runners were equipped with the SR5 package, and all turbo trucks had as standard a heavier rear differential later used in the V6 model. Low-option models had a small light in the gauge cluster to indicate turbo boost, while more plush vehicles were equipped with an all-digital gauge cluster that included a boost gauge. Turbocharged and naturally aspirated 2.4 L &quot;2L-T&quot; and &quot;2L&quot; diesel engines were also available in the pickups at this time as well, but it appears that no diesel-powered 4Runners were imported to the United States.

During 1984 to 1986 many 4Runners were imported to the US without rear seats. With only two seats the vehicle could be classified as a truck (rather than a sport vehicle) and could skirt the higher customs duties placed upon sport and pleasure vehicles. Most had aftermarket seats and seat belts added by North American dealers after they were imported.

No changes were made for the 1987 model year. In 1988, the &quot;22R-TE&quot; engine was replaced by an optional 3.0 L V6 engine, the &quot;3VZ-E&quot;, available with the SR5 trim package; the standard engine remained the &quot;22R-E&quot;. By this time, the SR5 package added automatic locking front hubs for both the I4 and V6 engines. The V6 engine was significantly larger and more powerful although not as reliable as the original 4-cylinder offering. Trucks sold with the V6 engine were equipped with the same heavy duty rear differential that was used in the turbocharged trucks, as well as a completely new transmission and transfer case; the transfer case was chain driven, although considered less rugged, created less cab noise than the old gear-driven unit used behind the four-cylinder engine.

In New Zealand, the 4Runner was equipped with the &quot;3Y&quot; 2.0 L I4 engine instead, followed more rarely by the &quot;4Y&quot; 2.2 L gasoline engine in later versions. This was a decision by Toyota New Zealand to reduce parts required to be stocked by dealers as no other Toyotas sold in New Zealand at the time utilised the R series engines. The &quot;3Y&quot;/&quot;4Y&quot; also were equipped, albeit rarely, in the Japanese domestic market pickups and never were used in the US market.

Small cosmetic and option changes were made in 1988 for the 1989 model year, but the model was left largely untouched in anticipation of the replacement model then undergoing final development.

== Second generation (N120/N130; 1989) ==

Toyota released a second generation of Hilux Surf and 4Runner in 1989 for the 1990 model year. Known as the N120/N130 series, these models continued to be based on the Hilux pickup. However, the second-generation Surf/4Runner represented a fundamental departure from the first generation model: Instead of an enhanced pickup truck with fiberglass cap, the new 4Runners featured a freshly designed, full-steel integrated body mounted on the existing frame. However, the 4Runner&#x27;s appearance remained virtually identical to the Hilux from the B-pillars forward, and the powertrain was shared with the Hilux.

===Chassis and body===
The 4Runner and corresponding Hilux shared similar body-on-frame construction which meant parts like the front suspension of the 4WD models, differentials, engines, drivetrain parts and front fascias were interchangeable; however, instead of the Hotchkiss drive design with leaf springs used on the Hilux and first-generation 4Runner, the rear suspension of the second-generation 4Runner was a multilink coil spring design locating a solid axle, which unfortunately proved to be just as prone to sagging as the leaf springs on the rear of the previous models.

Nearly all second generation 4Runners were four-door models; however, two-door models also were produced from launch in 1989 to May 1993. These models are similar to the four-door models of the time in that the bodies were formed as a single unit, instead of the fiberglass tops used in the first generation 4Runners. Two-door cars of the second generation are extremely rare, and they were priced higher than the four-door model due to the chicken tax applied to light-duty imported trucks. US sales of the two-door body ended in August 1992, but it continued to be available in the Canadian market through 1993, and Japan until May 1993.

Most competing full-body SUVs produced at the time (e.g. Nissan Pathfinder, Ford Explorer) featured tailgates that opened upward with the glass closed. In contrast, the second generation 4Runner carried over the retractable-glass tailgate from the first generation. Opening these tailgates requires first retracting the rear window into the tailgate and then lowering the tailgate much like as on a pickup truck.

In 1991 for the 1992 model year, the 4Runner received minor cosmetic updates, including one-piece front bumpers and modular headlamps instead of the increasingly outdated rectangular sealed beams, as well as a differently styled interior with a new pattern on the seats and door cards and a different horn button. This facelift distanced the 4Runner somewhat from the Hilux pickups which did not receive the same cosmetic changes. At this time a wide-body version was introduced featuring extended wheel arch flares along with wider wheels and tires. The Hilux Surf also had as options a Recaro interior, TEMS shocks with a NORMAL and HARD setting, a limited slip differential, front bullbars and a swing-out spare tire mounted on the tailgate.

Additional cosmetic changes occurred between 1993 and 1995, the last year of the second generation.

===Mechanical===
Because the drive train was still developed from the same source, the available engines and drivetrains were identical to the corresponding Hilux. The new 4Runner used the independent front suspension that had been developed on the previous generation. The older style gear driven transfer case was phased out on the V6 models and they now had a chain driven case. The older gear driven case was retained on the 4-cylinder models. There was also a choice of an open differential, or in Japan and Europe, a limited slip unit similar to the one found in the A70 Toyota Supra, parts are also interchangeable.

In the United States, the 4Runner carried over the same engine options from the previous generation: the &quot;22R-E&quot; 2.4 L I4 and &quot;3VZ-E&quot; 3.0 L V6. With the V6 and four-speed automatic transmission, the US EPA rated the 4Runner at on the city driving cycle; in testing, was observed.

The Hilux Surf version for the Japanese market was also available with a range of diesel engines, including a 2.4 L turbodiesel &quot;2L-TE&quot; I4 up to 1993, followed by a 3.0 L turbodiesel &quot;1KZ-TE&quot; I4. Small numbers were also made with a normally aspirated 2.8 L diesel &quot;3L&quot; I4, a 2.0 L &quot;3Y&quot; I4 naturally aspirated gasoline engine, and 2.4 L &quot;22R-E&quot; I4 gasoline engine. The majority of gasoline versions of the Hilux Surf received the &quot;3VZ-E&quot; 3.0 L V6. Various trim levels were offered in Japan ranging from the base model &#x27;SSR&#x27; through &#x27;SSR Ltd&#x27;, &#x27;SSR-V&#x27; &#x27;SSR-X&#x27; and &#x27;SSR-X Ltd&#x27; to the range topping &#x27;SSR-G&#x27;.

;N130 drivetrain notes
=== Safety ===
The first and second generation 4Runners were both targeted as unsafe SUVs. 1980s and early-1990s crash regulations in the United States were not very strict for light trucks, and all early model 4Runners were fitted with doors that offered little protection in the event of a side collision. In most areas, there was little more than two pieces of sheet-metal and the window to keep incoming vehicles from impacting passengers. Later, more strict crash regulations mandated doors that offered as much protection as passenger doors. In the United States, the 1994 and 1995 model years added side-impact beams in the doors.

The crash test rating for the second generation 4Runner was one to two stars (out of five) for the driver&#x27;s side in a frontal collision while the passenger side received a three to four-star rating.

The rear wheels were equipped with an anti-lock braking system as standard equipment for the SR5 V6 starting from the 1990 model year and four-wheel anti-lock brakes were an option.

== Third generation (N180; 1995) ==

Developed under chief engineer Masaaki Ishiko from 1990 to 1995 under the project code 185T, in late 1995 (for the 1996 model year) a significant redesign of the 4Runner was introduced, with an all-new body shell on an all-new chassis. It shared many parts, including engine and transmission, with the new Tacoma, and shared its chassis with the Land Cruiser Prado. Despite moving upmarket with the rest of the mid-size SUV market, the new 4Runner differentiated itself by retaining the rugged off-road character its competitors were sacrificing for highway comfort. 

===Design===
The third generation 4Runner featured new engines shared with the first generation Toyota Tacoma pickup trucks:
* 2.7L &quot;3RZ-FE&quot; I4 replacing the previous 2.4L &quot;22R-E&quot; I4
** max horsepower at 4800 rpm, an increase of 
** max torque at 4000 rpm, an increase of 
* 3.4L &quot;5VZ-FE&quot; V6 replacing the previous 3.0L &quot;3VZ-E&quot; V6
** horsepower at 4800 rpm, an increase of 
** max torque at 3600 rpm, an increase of 

In the United States, the 4Runner was available in three trims; the V6 engine was limited to the two higher trims (SR5 and Limited). For 4WD models, the transfer case selector allows the driver to select between 2WD high range (H2), 4WD low range (L4), or 4WD high range (H4); Limited models use a pushbutton to select H4.

Airbags for both the driver and passenger were added with the introduction of the third-generation 4Runner in 1995 for the 1996 model year. The new 4Runner was also available with a factory installed selectable electric locker in the rear differential, a first for the 4Runner but available since 1993 in the Toyota Land Cruiser.

Other significant changes from the second generation models include a larger body on a longer wheelbase and wider track, increased interior space, increased cargo space, dual airbags, ABS, lift-up tailgate, coil-spring suspension all around, rack and pinion steering, and aerodynamic contour designed glass headlights. Ground clearance decreased by to . Maximum towing capacity with the optional V6 increased from .

The equivalent Hilux Surf for the Japanese market was sold initially in four distinct trims, each of which used part-time four-wheel drive: SSR (standard body), SSR-X (standard body with luxury equipment), SSR-V (wide body), and SSR-G (wide body with luxury equipment). The 3.4L V6 was available only with the 4-speed automatic on the SSR-G trim. Additionally, Hilux Surf versions immediately moved to 16-inch wheels and gained a center differential, enabling the use of four-wheel drive on hard surfaces without complication for the first time. The prior system was retained to give on-the-fly shifting between rear- and four-wheel drive as before. 

For Japan, in addition to the two gasoline engines, the Hilux Surf also was available with a 3.0L &quot;1KZ-TE&quot; turbodiesel engine with a maximum output of . This turbodiesel was available with either the 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic.

In 1996, the 4Runner was dropped from sale in the UK, to be replaced by the Toyota Land Cruiser Prado, which was badged as the Toyota Land Cruiser Colorado.

===Model year changes===
The 1997 model year received a few minor updates, including the addition of a color keyed cargo cover. In Japan, an intercooled version of the &quot;1KZ-TE&quot; turbodiesel was introduced in July 1996, increasing maximum output to , with availability limited to the Hilux Surf SSR-G only.

The 1998 model year remained largely unchanged, save for a few changes in the electronics. More ergonomic switch control panels and a newly designed 4 spoke steering wheel, which also necessitated a redesign of the airbag system. The Hilux Surf introduced a new &#x27;Sports Runner&#x27; trim line in August 1998, which was available with either the 2.7L I4 or 3.4L V6 gasoline engines; the &#x27;Sports Runner&#x27; was rear-wheel drive only.

For the 1999 model year, there were both major cosmetic and interior enhancements. A new &quot;fat lip&quot; bumper was designed to allow for an extended crush zone on the front of the frame, as well as new multi-parabola style headlights, projector style fog lamps, and updated side marker lights and front turn signals. Vehicles with &quot;Limited&quot; and &quot;Highlander&quot; (later called &quot;Sport Edition&quot;) trim received color-keyed running boards, front and rear bumpers, mud flaps and flares. The ergonomics of the interior was completely changed, moving all the controls to the center of the dash for the rear window, and defrost, it also received a new instrument panel with a digital odometer. The Limited trucks also received a brand-new electronic temp control, and upgraded stereo. The &quot;multi-mode&quot; transfer case system became available as an option for 4WD 4Runners for 1999, giving the option of AWD operation.

The 2000 model year would be the final year the 5-speed manual would be offered, leaving the 4-speed automatic as the sole transmission option. This would mark the last time any 4Runner would be offered with a manual transmission. The turbodiesel engine for the equivalent Hilux Surf (sold July 2000 to December 2001) was replaced by the 3.0L &quot;1KD-FTV&quot;, which offered an increased maximum output of using a common rail direct injection design.

For the 2001 model year, the 4-cylinder option was discontinued in North America. It also received new transparent tail lights and new front grille design. The wheels were changed to a five-spoke design rim. Limited models received newly designed five spoke wheels as well, however different from SR5 and base model. Also included was a new, sleeker side view mirror design. SR5 and base model 4Runners also have redesigned climate control units utilizing 3 knobs and 2 buttons, contrary to the 1999 model&#x27;s 2 sliders and 2 knobs. 2001 models were equipped with Vehicle Stability Control standard, and 4WD models came standard with the &quot;multi-mode&quot; transfer case. The optional &quot;e-locker&quot; locking rear differential was dropped in 2001. This was replaced by the new advanced traction control system that offered similar performance by applying the individual brakes to direct power to whichever tires needed the most traction.

The 2002 model year can be distinguished from the rear by their chromed lift gate exterior trim that encompasses the license plate.

== Fourth generation (N210; 2002) ==

The fourth-generation 4Runner incorporated serious changes to the chassis and body of the vehicle, but was targeted at approximately the same demographics as the third generation. Based on the Land Cruiser Prado 120 series, the new 4Runner retained the same basic exterior styling themes, and was still marketed as a mid-size semi-luxury SUV with off-road capabilities. Available trims were the SR5, Sport Edition, and Limited models. An all-new LEV certified 4.0 L &quot;1GR-FE&quot; V6 which produces and of torque is standard, but for the first time, a V8 became available, the ULEV certified 4.7 L &quot;2UZ-FE&quot; engine which in the US produced and . In 2004, for the 2005 model year, the addition of VVT-i increased output to and . Fuel economy is estimated at 17 mpg city, 20 mpg highway for the V6 and 15/19 mpg for the V8. Towing capacity is on V6 models and on RWD V8 models (7000 pounds w/4WD). The 4Runner first entered dealer showrooms in October 2002 for the 2003 model year. Three trims levels were offered, SR5, Sport Edition, and Limited. When it was first introduced the SR5 and Sport Edition models used gray plastic cladding and bumpers. The Limited trim featured body color painted cladding and bumper shrouds. Sport models also featured a non-functional hood scoop.

The front suspension used a double wishbone while the rear is a solid rear axle type. The 4Runner continued to use a body on frame construction design and a solid rear axle for strength and durability compromising interior room and on-road handling. Toyota&#x27;s other mid-size SUV, the Highlander is a crossover which is not designed for off-roading. The optional 4WD systems were full-time on V8 models while &quot;Multi-Mode&quot; or part-time on V6 models, both systems used a lockable Torsen center differential. A new suspension system, X-Relative Absorber System (X-REAS), became standard on the Sport Edition and optional for SR5 and Limited models, a rear auto-leveling height adjustable air suspension is sometimes included with this option on Limited models. The X-REAS system links the dampers diagonally by means of hydraulic hoses and fluid using a mechanical center valve which reduces body roll during hard cornering. All 4runners were equipped with plastic skid plates for the engine, transfer case, and fuel tank to prevent damage during off-roading. The Hill-Start Assist Control (HAC) system prevents the 4runner from rolling backwards on inclines and a Downhill Assist Control (DAC, 4WD only) modulates the brakes and throttle automatically without driver inputs for smooth hill descents at very low speeds, both electronic aids are standard on 4WD models.

Major standard features included a tilt and telescoping steering wheel, remote keyless entry, single zone automatic climate control, power driver&#x27;s lumbar support, power rear tailgate window, and on V8 models a tow hitch receiver bolted directly to the rear frame crossmember. Options included HomeLink, an electrochromic auto-dimming rearview mirror, power moonroof, third row seating, a DVD-based navigation system (loses in-dash CD changer), a 10-speaker JBL Synthesis stereo, and rear seat audio. An optional backup camera system on Limited models used two cameras mounted on the interiors D-pillars to give a wider view when backing up. Some trim levels get two mirrors mounted on the interior D-pillars just inside the rear hatch.

In 2009 with the end of this generation, Toyota Japan ceased production of the Hilux Surf, leaving only the 4Runner available in the subsequent model series.

=== Safety ===
All 4Runners came with Toyota&#x27;s Star Safety System which includes anti-lock brakes, electronic brakeforce distribution, brake assist, traction control and Vehicle Stability Control. Side torso airbags for the front rows as well as side curtain airbags for the front and rear rows were optional on 2003–2007 models and became standard on 2008 models.

The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety rated the 4Runner as &quot;Good&quot; overall in the frontal offset crash test, &quot;Good&quot; overall in the side impact test on vehicles with side airbags, and the 4Runner received a &quot;Poor&quot; rating for rear impact protection. An IIHS report published in April 2007 shows the 4Runner has one of the lowest death rates for all vehicles on the road at only 13 deaths per million registered vehicle years for the 2003 and 2004 model years. Only the Chevrolet Astro, Infiniti G35, and BMW 7 series had lower death rates.

=== Yearly changes ===


* In early 2003, Toyota added an optional Appearance Package for the SR5 model that included color-keyed cladding, bumpers, and liftgate trim. In April 2003, Toyota made the Appearance Package, along with the previously optional fog lamps, running boards, and 16-inch aluminum wheels, standard on the SR5. The Sport Edition also added black running boards and color-keyed trim, replacing the grey cladding and silver-painted grille, door handles and liftgate trim.
* In late 2003 (for the 2004 model year), a tire-pressure monitoring system was added as standard equipment. A third row seat became optional on the SR5 and Limited models.
* In 2004 (for the 2005 model year), enhancements were brought to the optional V8 engine and a 5-speed automatic was made standard on the V6 model. Slight changes were made to the exterior including color-keyed bumper trim (replacing the silver painted trim on all colors except Dorado Gold) on the SR5 and Limited; a chrome grille on the SR5; a black roof-rack and running boards (replacing silver) on the Limited; and a redesigned rear spoiler. A Salsa Red Pearl scheme was also introduced for all trim levels, although a similar color scheme was available for third generation models.
* 2005 (for the 2006 model year) marked the fourth generation&#x27;s mid-cycle refresh. The changes included revised front and rear bumpers; a reworked grille; new projector-beam headlamps and LED tail lamps; additional chrome trim on the SR5 model; and a smoked-chrome grille with tubular roof-rack and step bars on the Sport Edition. The revised front bumper features circular fog lights and a relocation of the turn-signals to the headlamp assembly. The redesigned bumper eliminates the rear bumper reflectors. MP3 playback capability and an auxiliary input jack were added to all audio systems. In addition, the Limited model was further differentiated from the other trim levels with the addition of unique 18&quot; wheels and a seat memory system. Shadow Mica was added as a color option. Late in this period, the 1GR-FE V6 engine received a modification to allow for an improved head gasket design which resolved a common head gasket failure.
* In 2006 (for the 2007 model year), the 4Runner remained unchanged.
* In 2007 (for the 2008 model year), the 4Runner received standard rollover sensing side curtain airbags and front row side torso airbags, a switch to disable Vehicle Stability Control, slightly modified front grille design, refinements in the tire-pressure monitoring system, and some changes in the seat belt warning system and brake system control. An Urban Runner Package was also available on the Sport Edition V6 4x4, which added an in dash Tom Tom navigation system, Alcantara inserts in both the front and back seats with dark leather bolstering, the 18&quot; Limited style wheels, a color-keyed front grill and a double-decker cargo system.
* In 2008 (for the 2009 model year), the 4Runner remained unchanged. A Trail Edition package offered an electronic locking rear differential, a switch to enable/disable Advanced Traction Control (A-TRAC) and Bilstein dampers.
* Later models offered a DVD Rear Seat Entertainment System (RSES) which used a nine-inch LCD screen and two wireless headphones.

== Fifth generation (N280; 2009) ==

The fifth-generation 4Runner was unveiled at the State Fair of Texas on September 24, 2009, and went on sale months later. It is built on the same platform as the J150 series Land Cruiser Prado/Lexus GX and the FJ Cruiser. Despite being built in Japan, it was only produced in left-hand drive and it was not sold there or any other RHD markets.

Initially, the 4Runner was available in three trim levels, two of which were available previously. The base SR5 trim as well as the top-of-the-line Limited trim are available as a 2WD or a 4WD. The Trail Edition is only available as a 4WD. The SR5 and Trail Edition 4WDs received a part-time 4WD drive system, while the Limited has full-time 4WD. All models came with Active Traction Control (A-TRAC). The new Trail Edition offers Toyota&#x27;s Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System (KDSS) and Crawl Control which had previously only been available to premium Toyota vehicles, as well as a rear locking differential like the previous Trail Package.

The 4.0-liter V6 gasoline engine adds Dual VVT-i which improves horsepower, torque and fuel economy, and comes standard in all models. A 2.7-liter I4 was available on 2WD models, but was discontinued after the 2010 model year. The 4.7-liter V8 from the previous generation was not carried over to the fifth generation 4Runner.

=== Model year changes ===
In 2013 (for the 2014 model year), the 4Runner received a facelift, consisting of revised front and rear fascia with projector headlamps and clear-lensed, LED tail-lamps, as well as other minor exterior cosmetic changes. The interior was also updated, with soft-touch door trim, leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, revised dashboard and center stack, and the inclusion of Toyota&#x27;s Optitron instrument cluster as standard across all trim levels. Brake lines were upgraded for improved pedal feel, and electronic Trailer Sway Control programming included. No driveline changes were made. All 2014 model year 4Runner models are powered by a 4.0-liter V-6 engine with intelligent Variable Valve Timing (VVT-i) that can develop and of torque. It is mated to a five-speed automatic ECT transmission.

In 2014 (for the 2015 model year), the TRD Pro trim level was introduced in the United States, with Toyota badging on the front as well as an off-road package as part of the TRD Pro Series. The TRD Pro 4Runner included TRD Bilstein shocks with remote reservoirs, TRD-tuned front springs and TRD front skid plate. For each model year of the TRD Pro, beyond the two colors available on all trims, the TRD Pro is available in an exclusive color. This was &#x27;Inferno Orange&#x27; for the 2015 model year, &#x27;Quicksand&#x27; for 2016, &#x27;Cement&#x27; for 2017, &#x27;Cavalry Blue&#x27; for 2018, &#x27;Voodoo Blue&#x27; for 2019, &#x27;Army Green&#x27; for 2020, &#x27;Lunar Rock&#x27; for 2021, &#x27;Lime Rush&#x27; for 2022, &#x27;Solar Octane&#x27; for 2023, and &#x27;Terra&#x27; for 2024. All United States models received the Entune touchscreen infotainment system with a 6.1-inch display and a rear backup camera as standard equipment, with optional GPS navigation, SiriusXM Satellite Radio, HD Radio, and Safety Connect. Only the Limited trim featured a standard JBL premium amplified audio system.

In 2016 (for the 2017 model year), the 4Runner Trail and Trail Premium were renamed to TRD Off-Road and TRD Off-Road Premium in the United States. These trim levels shared the same mechanical functionality of the former Trail edition, but added aesthetic differences and TRD badging to differentiate themselves from the base model. They did not share the same suspension as the TRD Pro model.

In 2018 (for the 2019 model year), Toyota began offering a Nightshade package based on the Limited trim which blacks out badging, lower front and rear fascia, wheels, and portions of the interior.

In 2019 (for the 2020 model year), Toyota announced that all 4Runner trims would receive Toyota Safety Sense-P (TSS-P) standard as well as two additional rear seat USB ports. The TRD Pro was to have an updated grille design to accommodate the front radar sensor for TSS-P. All United States models received an updated Entune 3.0 infotainment system with a larger, higher-resolution touchscreen display, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration and Amazon Alexa integration, 4G LTE internet access powered by Verizon Wireless, Safety Connect, and standard SiriusXM Satellite Radio and optional HD Radio. The TRD Pro model received a JBL premium amplified audio system as standard equipment. The system was previously only available on Limited models, where it remained standard equipment. Most models also featured standard GPS navigation.

In 2021 (for the 2022 model year), Toyota included their smart key system with push button as standard for all trims. The new TRD Sport trim was also added into the lineup. The TRD Sport received the same bumper, 20&quot; wheels and the X-REAS suspension from the Limited. It also includes TRD parts such as the TRD shifter, TRD hood with scoop, TRD badges, and Softex seats with TRD lettering. Unlike the Limited, it is available only with 2WD or part-time 4WD. Toyota added LED foglights, lowbeams and highbeam headlights as standard for all trims for the first time. Blind spot monitor and rear cross traffic alert were added as standard for most trims. The TRD Pro now gets standard multi-terrain monitor. Using strategically placed cameras, the system lets the driver check surroundings on the trail, with the ability to spot potential obstacles not easily seen from the cabin. The Limited trim adds a standard Panoramic View Monitor, which is similar to the multi-terrain monitor on the TRD Pro. The Limited grade and TRD models also add a premium Multi-Information Display. All trims receives rear occupancy alert as standard. Lime Rush is the new exclusive paint for the 2022 model year TRD Pro.

In 2022 (for the 2023 model year), the 40th Anniversary Special Edition is a limited model for the North American market producing 4,040 units, with three exterior colors, and standard four-wheel-drive. Solar Octane paint is exclusive to the 2023 model year TRD Pro. Additionally, a heated steering wheel was introduced as standard equipment on the TRD Pro, 40th Anniversary Special Edition, TRD Off-Road Premium, and as optional equipment on the SR5, the SR5 Premium, the TRD Off-Road, and the Limited (with leather only). The heated steering wheel is not an available option on the TRD Sport.

In 2023 (for the 2024 model year), Terra paint (an orange-brown color) is the exclusive color for TRD Pro while Solar Octane carries over to TRD Sport and Off Road Premium trims only.

== Sixth generation (N500; 2024) ==
The sixth-generation 4Runner was officially revealed on 9 April 2024. The 4Runner continues to be built in Toyota&#x27;s Tahara plant in Japan, despite only being in left-hand drive form. Sales were initially set to commence after mid-2024, but was delayed to December 2024 at the earliest due to supply constraints on key parts shared with other vehicles. It is based on the same body-on-frame GA-F platform as the Tacoma pick-up truck, and they share many mechanical components. The sixth-generation 4Runner will be available in nine trim levels, six of which carried over from the previous generation: SR5, TRD Sport, TRD Off-Road, TRD Off-Road Premium, Limited, and TRD Pro, and three new trims: TRD Sport Premium, a replacement for the earlier SR5 Premium trim; Trailhunter, with overlanding-specific equipment; and Platinum, a new luxury-oriented trim.

A base i-Force drivetrain is standard on SR5, TRD Sport, TRD Sport Premium, TRD Off-Road, TRD Off-Road Premium and Limited trims, while a parallel hybrid i-Force Max drivetrain is available on TRD Off-Road, TRD Off-Road Premium, and Limited trims, and standard on Platinum, TRD Pro and Trailhunter trims.

The Trailhunter features 33-inch off-road tires, ARB&#x27;s Old Man Emu (OME) 2.5-inch forged shocks with rear external remote reservoirs, ARB-designed roof rack, raised ground clearance by 2-inch and 1.5-inch front and rear respectively, a high-mounted air intake for the i-Force Max powertrain and high-strength steel skid plates. For the exterior styling, the Trailhunter has Toyota heritage grill with bronze “TOYOTA” lettering, an integrated 20-inch LED light bar and color selectable LED foglights.

Like its predecessors, the 4Runner retains the electrically roll-down back window feature. The engineering team managed to retain this feature by evaluating each individual component in the feature mechanism and took opportunities to reduce weight.

Some models will be offered with an optional third row seat; because the hybrid drivetrain uses the space beneath the load floor for its high-voltage battery, it is expected the hybrid will not include the third row.

<doc id="1301733" wikidata="Q7168342" url="?curid=1301733" title="Peri Brown">
<text>Perpugilliam “Peri” Brown, is a fictional character played by Nicola Bryant in the long-running British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.

An American botany major from Fell&#x27;s Point in Baltimore, Maryland, Peri is a companion of the Fifth (Peter Davison) and Sixth Doctor (Colin Baker) and a regular in the programme from 1984 to 1986, appearing in a total of 11 stories (33 episodes).

== Production ==

=== Casting ===
English drama student Nicola Bryant had been spotted by an agent in a production of the musical comedy &quot;No, No Nanette&quot; at her drama school, the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art, which was the last show she did before leaving the school. She had performed with an American accent during the show, and having mistaken her for a real American, the agent took note of &quot;one American...&quot;. In less than a week after leaving the school, he phoned her up and secured her an audition for &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.

Nathan-Turner was only auditioning Americans, and the British actress had to feign an American accent during the process. The agent had promised to tell the production that Bryant was British if she was successful, but this was ultimately unfulfilled. Bryant therefore had to use her American accent in all public places, barring the local pop to the supermarket; this included BBC canteens and rehearsal rooms. The young actress simply &quot;got on with it&quot; throughout her entire run on the show and later described it as the &quot;longest role [she] ever played&quot;. Bryant described the audition process as &quot;extraordinary&quot; and &quot;surreal&quot;.

Bryant revealed her British accent to Colin Baker at a dinner party; after his departure, Baker revealed her non-American origins to the newspapers, which he described as &quot;doing [her] a favour&quot;. Decades later, Bryant finds that her American accent can still subconsciously slip into conversation, and noted that fans are often still surprised to discover that she is not American.

=== Makeup and costume ===
Announcing the new companion, John Nathan-Turner said of Peri, &quot;She&#x27;ll often be wearing leotards and bikinis. A lot of Dads watch &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and I&#x27;m sure they will like Nicola.&quot; Bryant derided the costume that she wore on &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. She remembered consistently having her buttocks tapped while walking through the BBC lot, and that she would have to laugh and say &quot;thank you&quot; in response then walk a little faster or duck into the bathroom. She recalled a four to five-hour makeup process for &quot;Mindwarp&quot; (1986) being artificially sped up by the makeup department, leading to the prosthetic being ripped from her face; while shooting in the sun the following days, her face was unbearably sore. The skimpy outfit she wore in her first story &quot;Planet of Fire&quot; (1984), while appropriate for the Mediterranean weather of its setting, was inappropriate for British winter and caused her to get frostbite and pneumonia.

=== Departure ===
As a consequence of the hiatus, Bryant&#x27;s three-year contract expired half way through season 23; Nathan-Turner did not renew her contract as he did not wish for a companion to be part of the series for more years than previous Doctors. When Bryant&#x27;s contract was coming to an end, Nathan-Turner asked her how she would like Peri to be written out of the show. She advised that she did not want to shake hands and say a generic line such as &quot;bye Doctor, I&#x27;ll send you a postcard&quot;, and that she wanted a dramatic storyline to &quot;go out with a bang&quot;. She was pleased with Philip Martin&#x27;s &quot;powerful&quot; &quot;Mindwarp&quot; storyline involving a mind transplant and a bald head sequence. She was displeased, however, with the retcon at the end of the season which suggested that Peri had married King Yrcanos (Brian Blessed), as she and Blessed had not played any romantic interaction between the two characters. She feels that the explanation of what happened to Peri in the Big Finish audio story &quot;Peri and the Piscon Paradox&quot; (2011) was preferable and should be considered canon.

== Characterization ==
As her first job after leaving drama school, Bryant expected to receive a character sheet to give her a window into Peri&#x27;s backstory. After not receiving one, she opted to write one herself, expecting Nathan-Turner to have it incorporated into the scripts, which he did not do. She initially felt that a companion must either be an adrenaline junkie or someone running from their past, because otherwise once someone realises how dangerous the Doctor&#x27;s travels are, all they would want to do is go back, and also noted that in real life a person finding themselves in the companion&#x27;s situation would have a nervous breakdown early on. Taking this into consideration, Bryant decided that it was Peri&#x27;s choice to join the Doctor, that she was so miserable in the life she had on Earth that she wanted to do it, and that she would take on some of the Doctor&#x27;s strength and courage throughout their adventures.

Similarly to previous companions, Peri&#x27;s role was often perfunctory in nature, running off and getting in trouble so that the Doctor could save her. For this purposes of enjoying the adventures, the actress was required to &quot;sugarcoat the trauma&quot; of the character nearly dying each episode. To avoid any suggestion of a romantic relationship, Bryant played to the Fifth Doctor as a father figure; she had devised that he was reminiscent of Peri&#x27;s deceased father, a touch that was never shown on-screen but that Nathan-Turner approved of. Bryant did not like the way that Peri was written in &quot;Timelash&quot; (1985) as she felt that she bore no resemblance to the character she had started out with, and felt it was unnecessary that during her time on the show she spent &quot;three out of four episodes&quot; tied up. Bryant said the story &quot;harked back to the 60s, where basically the companion gets tied up and left somewhere to scream a lot.&quot;

== Reception ==
Writing for &quot;Digital Spy&quot; Ben Rawson-Jones felt that her demise was &quot;the most dramatic and heart-stopping exit by a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; companion ever&quot;.

=== Legacy ===
Bryant&#x27;s first convention was in November 1983, just a few months after she started shooting, despite having no footage to show. She later described the experience as a hysteria on par with Beatlemania. She required a bodyguard and stayed in a huge hotel suite. A man fainted after noticing her. At a later convention, she recalled a disabled man giving her a stuffed dog as a gift and describing Peri as his best friend. Bryant would later quasi-reprise her role as Peri in the form of &#x27;Miss Brown&#x27; in the BBV video series &quot;The Stranger&quot;, which co-starred Colin Baker as the titular Doctor-inspired role. She has also acknowledged that the bluntness of Peri&#x27;s death upset many fans of the show.

During a convention in 2017, Bryant discussed the positive impact that her time on &quot;Doctor Who&quot; has had on her life: She has been able to travel the world and make close friendships because of the show, and expressed that she never expected it to become such a huge part of her life. She stated that there is not one of her stories that she would not wish to reshoot, noting her respect for &quot;The Caves of Androzani&quot; (1984) as a whole piece and believed the themes in &quot;Vengeance on Varos&quot; (1985) were still relevant. She also explained that the backstory of later companion Rose Tyler, the first companion of the revived series which began in 2005, was very reminiscent of the backstory she had constructed for Peri.

Peri Lomax, a fictional character from the British Channel 4 soap opera &quot;Hollyoaks&quot;, played by Ruby O&#x27;Donnell, was named after Peri.

==Character history==

Peri first appeared in the Fifth Doctor serial &quot;Planet of Fire&quot;, in which she encountered the Doctor and Turlough on the island of Lanzarote. After an encounter with the Master and the shape-changing android Kamelion (who disguises himself as her stepfather, Professor Howard Foster), Peri asked to join the Fifth Doctor on his travels, while Turlough departed to return to his home planet of Trion. (The identity of Peri&#x27;s mother was not revealed in the televised series - but see below.)

By the end of the Fifth Doctor&#x27;s final story &quot;The Caves of Androzani&quot;, both The Doctor and Peri were suffering from spectrox poisoning, and so the Fifth Doctor decided to give what antidote remains to Peri, sacrificing himself to save her. As she looks on, he regenerates into the Sixth Doctor, and she continued to travel with him, despite the temporarily unstable Doctor attempting to strangle her after his transformation (in his debut story &quot;The Twin Dilemma&quot;).

Peri is a bright and spirited young woman, an undergraduate and thus likely around twenty years of age, who travelled with The Doctor because, like many of his companions, she wanted to see the universe. Although she shared a more abrasive relationship with the Sixth Doctor, there was an undercurrent of affection in their verbal sparring.

Peri travelled with The Doctor for an undisclosed period of time; some sources say she travelled with him for mere months, while others say years. Between the events of &quot;Revelation of the Daleks&quot; and the season-long story &quot;The Trial of a Time Lord&quot;, her character was shown to have matured somewhat (coinciding with an 18-month production break between the two stories) and her relationship with The Doctor became less combative.

In the second segment of the &quot;Trial&quot; story arc, &quot;Mindwarp&quot;, Peri was abducted by a gastropod-like creature named Kiv, who apparently transplanted his brain into her body. Soon after, The Doctor was led to believe that Peri was dead, and was severely distressed by this. It was later revealed, at the end of &quot;The Ultimate Foe&quot; (the fourth segment of the arc), that the evidence of Peri&#x27;s death was faked by the Valeyard. In fact, Peri had survived, and been saved by - whilst also marrying - King Yrcanos of Thoros Alpha, a warrior king who had assisted the Doctor and Peri in &quot;Mindwarp&quot;. It is not known what happened to Peri after she married King Yrcanos.

==Other appearances==
Peri has the distinction of being the first humanoid television companion to appear in the comic strip within &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot;; previously the strip, which began in 1979, depicted The Doctor either travelling alone or with companions created for the strip, while the robotic television companion K9 was featured in several &quot;DWM&quot; comic strips featuring the Fourth Doctor). Her first appearance was in &quot;Funhouse Part 1&quot; (DWM #102) in which she appeared in two panels as a scantily clad apparition manifested by a villain. Two issues later, in &quot;Kane&#x27;s Story Part 1&quot; (DWM #104), she became a regular character in the strip, initially travelling with both the Sixth Doctor and his shape-shifting companion, Frobisher and continuing until the final part of &quot;Up Above the Gods&quot; in DWM #129. &quot;Kane&#x27;s Story&quot; established that, at one point during her travels with the Sixth Doctor, Peri left the TARDIS for reasons left unrevealed and went to live in New York City where she took a job in an office, a job she angrily quit for reasons also unrevealed just prior to encountering The Doctor again and voluntarily rejoining him.

The epilogue to the Target Books novelisation of &quot;Mindwarp&quot;, written by Philip Martin, stated that Peri returned to the 20th Century with King Yrcanos where the latter became a professional wrestler. This tongue-in-cheek conclusion was not reflected in any televised story, and is generally ignored by fandom.

In the Marvel Comics graphic novel &quot;The Age of Chaos&quot;, written by Colin Baker, Peri lived out her life on Krontep as Queen Consort of Yrcanos and has at least three grandchildren, who are principal characters in the story.

The Virgin New Adventures novel &quot;Bad Therapy&quot; by Matthew Jones reveals that, although becoming the wife of King Yrcanos, Peri blamed The Doctor for abandoning her. In the novel, the Seventh Doctor made peace with Peri after she found her way back to Earth through a temporal rift on Krontep, and returned her to her time.

The Telos novella &quot;Shell Shock&quot; by Simon A. Forward reveals that Peri had been sexually abused by her stepfather. This is hinted at in the Past Doctor Adventures novel &quot;Synthespians™&quot; by Craig Hinton, which also reveals that her parents were Janine and Paul Brown, and that her father died in a boating accident when she was thirteen. She has two step-siblings from her mother&#x27;s marriage to Foster.

Bryant has voiced the character of Peri in several audio plays produced by Big Finish Productions, alongside both Peter Davison as the Fifth Doctor and Colin Baker as the Sixth Doctor. In several of these stories, the Fifth Doctor and Peri are joined by another companion, the Egyptian princess Erimem. The Sixth Doctor audio play &quot;The Reaping&quot; introduces Peri&#x27;s mother, Janine Foster, played by American actress Claudia Christian (although in reality, Christian is five years younger than Nicola Bryant). The play, set in 1984 as the Doctor takes Peri back to her time to attend the funeral of the father of a friend of hers, confirms Peri&#x27;s late father&#x27;s name as Paul and mentions that Howard and Janine Foster have gone their separate ways, but does not mention Peri&#x27;s step-siblings. After The Doctor and Peri thwart a Cyberman attempt to set up a conversion factory in Baltimore, Peri plans to stay with her family, but Janine is subsequently killed due to an accident involving remaining Cyber-technology, cutting Peri&#x27;s last familial tie to Earth and prompting her to return to her travels with The Doctor when he comes to visit her at her mother&#x27;s grave.

In the audio play &quot;Her Final Flight&quot;, the Sixth Doctor finds Peri on a remote planet, where she apparently dies of a virus, although it is revealed that the entire story was part of a fantasy designed to make The Doctor kill himself.

Another audio play, &quot;Peri and the Piscon Paradox&quot;, states that the Time Lords made several adjustments to her time line, resulting in at least five alternate versions of Peri with different fates, including one that thought she never travelled in the TARDIS but instead moved to California and eventually hosted a chat show called &quot;The Queen of Worries&quot; after divorcing her abusive childhood sweetheart.

In the later audio &quot;The Widow&#x27;s Assassin&quot;, The Doctor travels to Krontep to attend Peri&#x27;s wedding, only be locked up for abandoning her. However, despite apparently spending five years in prison, The Doctor actually spends that time carrying out a complex long-term investigation into the death of King Yrcanos shortly after the wedding, eventually learning that &#x27;Peri&#x27; is actually possessed by The Doctor&#x27;s childhood imaginary enemy, Mandrake the Lizard King, who was &#x27;extracted&#x27; from The Doctor&#x27;s mind when he was exposed to Crozier&#x27;s equipment. After transferring himself into Peri&#x27;s body to expel Mandrake, The Doctor and Peri return to their true bodies and resume their travels together. In &quot;Masters of Earth&quot;, they arrive on Earth during the Dalek occupation, a year before the events of &quot;The Dalek Invasion of Earth&quot; from Earth&#x27;s perspective, forcing The Doctor to help a future famous rebel figure escape without compromising history. In &quot;The Rani Elite&quot;, The Doctor and Peri visit a famous university and are nearly caught in a trap set by a version of the Rani who has already experienced the events of &quot;Time and the Rani&quot;; the crisis ends with Peri receiving an honorary degree in botany to accompany The Doctor&#x27;s honorary degree in moral philosophy.

Future show runner Steven Moffat mentions an unnamed &#x27;Warrior Queen on Thoros Beta&#x27; in his 1996 short story, &quot;Continuity Errors&quot;.

Bryant played the role of &#x27;Miss Brown&#x27; in the first three instalments of the BBV video series &quot;The Stranger&quot;, opposite Colin Baker in the title role; although her character was never explicitly identified as being Peri (much as The Stranger was never directly linked to The Doctor), there are nonetheless similarities in the two characters, with one major difference: Bryant used her natural English accent for Miss Brown, rather than affecting an American accent as she did with Peri.

<doc id="1301734" wikidata="Q1914539" url="?curid=1301734" title="Common snook">
<text>The common snook (Centropomus undecimalis) is a species of marine fish in the family Centropomidae of the order Perciformes. The common snook is also known as the sergeant fish or robalo. It was originally assigned to the sciaenid genus &quot;Sciaena;&quot; &quot;Sciaena undecimradiatus&quot; and &quot;Centropomus undecimradiatus&quot; are obsolete synonyms for the species.

One of the largest snooks, &quot;C. undecimalis&quot; grows to a maximum overall length of . The common length is . The IGFA world record is caught in Parismina Ranch, Costa Rica, by Rafael Montalvo. Of typical centropomid form, it possesses drab coloration except for a distinctive black lateral line. It can also have bright yellow pelvic and caudal fins, especially during spawn.

==General ecology==

===Reproductive ecology===
The common snook is a protandric hermaphrodite fish species. Its spawning season spans from April to October. The peak spawning occurs during July and August. Spawning typically occurs in near-shore waters with high salinities. Following the spawning period, the juveniles then migrate to the brackish waters of the nearby estuarine environments. When these juveniles mature, they return to the higher-salinity waters of the open ocean to join the breeding population.

===Habitat ecology===
The common snook is an estuarine and freshwater-dependent fish species. Within estuaries, juvenile common snook are most often found inhabiting areas such as coastal wetland ponds, island networks, and creeks. Despite being a euryhaline species of fish, the common snook shows a tendency to gravitate towards lower-salinity conditions in the early stages of its life. By being able to adapt and thrive in both high- and low-salinity conditions through osmoregulation, common snook display a high level of habitat plasticity.

Common snook are opportunistic predators whose feeding habits indicate a positive relationship between their size and the size of their prey, meaning that as the snook grows, it feeds on larger and larger prey. Common snook occasionally engage in cannibalism. This usually occurs during the winter when adults and juveniles are in close proximity to one another within their estuarine habitats. This form of cannibalism where the juveniles are fed on by the adults is referred to as intercohort cannibalism. The adult common snook that cannibalize juveniles most likely target them because the juveniles may be the largest of the available prey, so are nutritionally efficient to prey upon.

===Physiological ecology===
Common snook, like many species of fish, are very in tune with their environments. Even a slight change in their surroundings can have a significant impact on their behavior. For example, common snook are able to determine when to start and stop spawning based on the temperature and salinity of the water they inhabit, the amount of rainfall in the area, and whether or not the moon is full.

In some cases, disturbances in their environment can have very negative effects on the snook population. One example is the devastating results of a cold snap. Snook are very susceptible to cold temperatures, with the effects ranging from the complete halt of all feeding at a water temperature of , to the loss of equilibrium at , to death at a temperature of . A cold snap in January 2010 resulted in a 41.88% decline in nominal abundance of the common snook population in southwest Florida from the previous year and a 96–97% decrease in apparent survival estimates.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;C. undecimalis&quot; is widespread throughout the tropical waters of the western Atlantic Ocean, from the coast of the North Carolina to Brazil including the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea.
Snook likely originated in Central America, and changes in the Earth&#x27;s climate brought the snook to Florida. During a great warming trend after the Ice Age, snook moved northward along the Mexico shoreline. They followed the perimeter of the Gulf of Mexico, along the west and east coasts of Florida.

Massive snook are found in Central America, although they seem to look a little different because of the weather and water quality, but they are the same. No restrictions exist in most of Central America on the size or quantity of snook one can keep, consequently many locals have been keeping and killing these large snook for quite a while. Occurring in shallow coastal waters (up to in depth), estuaries and lagoons, the fish often enter fresh water. They are carnivorous, with a diet dominated by smaller fishes, and crustaceans such as shrimp, and occasionally crabs.

Due to their limited cold tolerance, snook have been physiologically restricted from inhabiting temperate climates. In Florida, northern limits in their geographic range have historically been Tarpon Springs along the Gulf Coast and Cape Canaveral on the east coast. Over the past 15 years, snook have extended their range as far north as the Suwannee River Estuary (~29°N), where an exponential increase in their population has occurred. Warmer winter temperatures resulting from climate change has been suggested as a likely cause. There may be potential food-web effects, particularly for sea trout (&quot;Cynoscion&quot; species), related to the snook colonization.

==Human interest==

Three United States Navy submarines have been named for this species, USS &quot;Robalo&quot; (SS-273) and USS &quot;Snook&quot; (SS-279) in the Second World War and USS &quot;Snook&quot; (SSN-592) in the 1950s.

Considered an excellent food fish, the common snook is fished commercially and foreign-caught fish are sold in the US. When cooking snook, the skin must be removed, because it imparts an unpleasant taste, described as soapy, to the fish.

Snook are prized as game fish, being known for their great fighting capabilities. The IGFA all-tackle world record for common snook stands at caught by Gilbert Ponzi near Parismina Ranch, Costa Rica. Previous world records were caught in Fort Myers, Florida, and Gatun Spillway Canal Zone, Panama.

Anglers regularly use a variety of lures to catch snook. Common lures include jerkbaits, bucktail jigs, topwater lures, spoons, and live bait.

== Protection in Florida Gulf Coast ==
&quot;At the June 2012 Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) meeting, Commissioners voted to keep the recreational harvest of snook in Gulf of Mexico waters closed through Aug. 31, 2013. This closure will offer the species additional protection after a 2010 cold kill detrimentally affected the population. Snook closed to harvest in Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic waters in January 2010 after a severe cold kill affected snook population number.&quot;

All snook were &quot;catch-and-release only&quot; in the Gulf of Mexico until August 31, 2013. At that time, the FWC could choose to open or close snook harvest for another season. The commercial harvest or sale of snook is prohibited by the same regulations.

At the June 2013 FWC meeting, commissioners voted to let the recreational harvest of snook reopen in Gulf of Mexico waters from September 1 that year. The next stock assessment for snook was scheduled for 2015, but had not yet occurred as of June 2016, effectively leaving the fish under a protected status.

<text>The International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) is an international organisation which conducts agricultural research for rural development, headquartered in Patancheru, Hyderabad, Telangana, India, with several regional centres (Bamako (Mali), Nairobi (Kenya)) and research stations (Niamey (Niger), Kano (Nigeria), Lilongwe (Malawi), Addis Ababa (Ethiopia), Bulawayo (Zimbabwe)).
It was founded in 1972 by a consortium of organisations convened by the Ford- and the Rockefeller- foundations. Its charter was signed by the FAO and the UNDP.
Since its inception, host country India has granted a special status to ICRISAT as a UN Organization operating in the Indian territory making it eligible for special immunities and tax privileges.

ICRISAT is managed by a full-time Director General functioning under the overall guidance of an international Governing Board. The current Director General (Interim) is Dr Stanford Blade who took the post in October 2024. The current chairman of the Board is Prabhu Pingali.

==The semi-arid tropics==

The semi-arid tropics (SAT) region is characterized by highly variable, low-to-medium rainfall and poor soils, further characterized by lack of irrigation. In general, the historical average annual rainfall in the SAT is below . In agricultural policy terms, this region is considered to be a less favored area (LFA).

==Research strategy==
With almost 50 years of experience addressing the agricultural constraints in the drylands of Africa and Asia, ICRISAT has developed key strengths which are focused on delivering impact in the drylands in alignment with its mission and mandate. ICRISAT has a unique role in dryland agriculture research for development, working through diverse partnerships across Asia and Africa. ICRISAT’s unique comparative strength has been to conduct upstream science and to translate upstream science to applied research. This makes a difference in farmers&#x27; lives by scaling scientific innovations with due attention to the environment, policy, marketing and socioeconomics. In the complex farming systems of the drylands where ICRISAT mandate crops including grain legumes and dryland cereals are grown, integrated solutions are needed to address the challenges of poverty, climate change, nutrition and sustainability of natural resources. 

ICRISAT founded the Smart Food initiative in 2013 with the Vision to create a world where food is &#x27;Smart&#x27; – good for you, the planet and the farmer. A key objective is to diversify staples across Africa and Asia, with the initial focus on millets and sorghum.

==Mandate crops==

ICRISAT performs crop improvement research, using conventional as well as methods derived from biotechnology, on the following crops: chickpea, pigeonpea, groundnut, pearl millet, sorghum, finger millet, teff, and small millets.

ICRISAT&#x27;s scientific information by topic, crop, location and resources is found on Exploreit.

==Research themes and genebank==
ICRISAT conducts its research under three Global Research Programs (GRPs): Accelerated Crop Improvement, Resilient Farm and Food Systems, Enabling Systems Transformations. These three GRPs are implemented through 18 research clusters.

The ICRISAT genebank serves as a repository for the collection of germplasm of the six mandate crops – sorghum, pearl millet, finger millet, chickpea, pigeonpea and groundnut; and five small millets – foxtail millet, little millet, kodo millet, proso millet and barnyard millet. The collection has over 128,446 germplasm accessions assembled from 144 countries. Several landraces now conserved in the ICRISAT genebank have disappeared from their natural habitats in Africa and Asia.

==Accelerated crop improvement research==
Most of ICRISAT&#x27;s crop improvement research is directed to deliver climate-resilient improved crop varieties with pest and disease resistance, improved nutritional quality and market preferred traits and improved genetic gains. 

Based on an econometric analysis of time-series data for three different types of agricultural areas (irrigated, high-potential rainfed, and low-potential rainfed), non-ICRISAT experts found more favorable marginal returns (measured as Indian rupees of agricultural production per additional hectare planted to modern varieties) for crop improvement research in low-potential rainfed areas than in either high-potential rainfed areas or irrigated areas. Moreover, additional crop research investment in low potential rainfed areas lifts more people out of poverty than in the other two types of areas.

ICRISAT-improved chickpea varieties have been widely adopted in a poor tribal area in Gujarat, India, with favorable impacts on yields, unit production costs, and net returns per hectare/per acre. ICRISAT&#x27;s package of improved groundnut varieties grown in combination with improved agronomy practices has had a positive result in the semi-arid tropical areas of Central India.

Two major science-based breakthroughs attributed to crop improvement research at ICRISAT relate to pearl millet and pigeonpea. A team of researchers at ICRISAT have released the first public sector-bred, marker-assisted bred hybrid pearl millet, HHB 67. This was released in India in 2006. It is assessed to have superior agronomic performance and improved tolerance to terminal drought. The first-ever release of a hybrid pigeonpea by ICRISAT researchers has been reported in 2008.

==Information products and services==
ICRISAT formally adopted an open-access policy for its research publications in 2009. It is among a small number of agricultural research organisations to do so. As of June 2010, about 3000 publications are available on the organisation&#x27;s website.

<text>Woodworm Records was a record label created in 1979 to enable the British folk-rock band Fairport Convention to release their album &quot;Farewell, Farewell&quot;. The album was a recording of performances taken from the band&#x27;s 1979 farewell tour. The impending break-up of the band had followed medical advice given to fiddle-player Dave Swarbrick to save his hearing by playing no more amplified music. As there was no record label willing to release the recording, bass guitarist Dave Pegg and his wife Christine formed their own label to release the album.

Woodworm Records soon grew and released albums by Fairport and other artists such as Dave Swarbrick and Steve Ashley. During 2004 the Peggs were divorced, resulting in the sale of studio. The record label was thus put on hold. Members of Fairport Convention decided to form the new label Matty Grooves Records to continue the work of Woodworm Records.

Associated with the label, and especially with Fairport Convention in recent years, are Woodworm Recording Studios, situated at Barford St. Michael in Oxfordshire, where other artists, including Jethro Tull and Richard Thompson, have also recorded.

<doc id="1301771" wikidata="Q1337379" url="?curid=1301771" title="Peter Shafirov">
<text>Baron Peter Pavlovich Shafirov (; 1670–1739) was a Russian statesman and a prominent coadjutor of Peter the Great.

==Early life and career==
Shafirov was born into a Polish Jewish family. His father, Pavel Shafirov, was a translator in the Russian Foreign Office, whose parents converted to the Russian Orthodox Church after Smolensk was ceded to Russia by Poland in 1654.

Peter Shafirov first made himself useful by his extraordinary knowledge of foreign languages. He was the chief translator in the Russian Foreign Office for many years, subsequently accompanying Tsar Peter on his travels. He was raised to the Russian nobility as a baron and received the rank of vice-chancellor. He was considered a diplomat of the highest order.

==Diplomatic missions==
Shafirov concluded the Peace of the Pruth during the campaign of 1711. Peter left him in the hands of the Turks as a hostage, and on the breaking of the peace he was imprisoned in the Seven Towers. Finally, however, with the aid of the British and Dutch ambassadors, he defeated the diplomacy of Charles XII of Sweden and his agents, and confirmed the good relations between Russia and Turkey by the treaty of Adrianople (June 1713).

In 1718, Shafirov was appointed vice-president of the department of Foreign Affairs, and a senator.

==Sentencing and end of life==

In 1723, however, he was deprived of all his offices and sentenced to death. The capital sentence was commuted at the last minute to banishment, first to Siberia and then to Novgorod. Embezzlement and disorderly conduct in the senate were the offences charged against Shafirov. On the death of Peter, Shafirov was released from prison and commissioned to write the biography of his late master. However, the successful rivalry of his supplanter, Andrei Osterman, prevented Shafirov from holding any high office during the last fourteen years of his life.

==Works==
In 1717, he authored a treatise entitled &quot;A discourse concerning the just causes of the war between Sweden and Russia&quot;, a historical tract on the war with Charles XII. Shafirov detailed some of the greatest exploits of the tsar-regenerator.

<doc id="1301785" wikidata="Q7254597" url="?curid=1301785" title="Pseudocertainty effect">
<text>In prospect theory, the pseudocertainty effect is the tendency for people to perceive an outcome as certain while it is actually uncertain in multi-stage decision making. The evaluation of the certainty of the outcome in a previous stage of decisions is disregarded when selecting an option in subsequent stages. Not to be confused with certainty effect, the pseudocertainty effect was discovered from an attempt at providing a normative use of decision theory for the certainty effect by relaxing the cancellation rule.

==Background==
The pseudocertainty effect was illustrated by Daniel Kahneman, who received the Nobel Prize in economics for his work on decision making and decision theory, in collaboration with Amos Tversky. The studies that they researched used real and hypothetical monetary gambles and were often used in undergraduate classrooms and laboratories. Kahneman and Tversky illustrated the pseudocertainty effect by the following examples.

=== Problem 1 ===
Consider the following two stage game. In the first stage, there is a 75% chance to end the game without winning anything and a 25% chance to move into the second stage. If you reach the second stage, you have a choice between:

Which of the following options do you prefer?

*A. a sure win of $30
*B. 80% chance to win $45

Your choice must be made before the game starts, i.e., before the outcome of the first stage is known. Please indicate the option you prefer.

=== Problem 2 ===
Which of the following options do you prefer?

*C. 25% chance to win $30
*D. 20% chance to win $45

Also, this time the participants had to make their choice before the game starts.

== Significance ==
Each problem was answered by a different group of respondents. In problem 1, people preferred option A with a rate of 74% over option B with 26%, even though the expected return of option B is higher. In problem 2, people preferred option D with a rate of 58% over option C with a rate of 42%. However, the discrepancy between the answers were surprising because the two problems were designed to have identical outcomes. The choices in problem 2 were designed to be compressed forms of the choices from the two stages of problem 1.

(25% chance to move on x 100% = 25%) chance to win $30. The same $7.50 expected return in option A and option C.

(25% chance to move on x 80% = 20%) chance to win $45. The same $9.00 expected return in option B and option D.

Kahneman and Tversky referred to this incidence as a result of what they called the &quot;pseudocertainty effect&quot;. They concluded that when people make choices at later stages of problems they often do not realize that uncertainty at an earlier stage will affect the final outcome. This was clearly observed in the two stage problem shown above in which the problem moved onto the second stage only if the condition of the first stage was met.

In the second problem, since individuals have no choice on options in the first stage, individuals tend to discard the first option when evaluating the overall probability of winning money, but just to consider the options in the second stage that individuals have a choice on. This is also known as cancellation, meaning that possible options are yielding to the same outcome thus ignoring decision process in that stage.

<text>M is a 1951 American film noir directed by Joseph Losey. It is a remake of Fritz Lang&#x27;s 1931 German film of the same title about a child murderer. This version shifts the location of action from Berlin to Los Angeles and changes the killer&#x27;s name from Hans Beckert to Martin W. Harrow. Both versions of &quot;M&quot; were produced by Seymour Nebenzal, whose son, Harold, was associate producer of the 1951 version.

The 1951 film stars David Wayne, Howard da Silva, Luther Adler and Martin Gabel.
ADD

The film was restored in 2015, with Harold Nebenzal as Executive Producer of the restoration.

==Plot==
Martin W. Harrow (David Wayne) is a compulsive child-murderer, and the public demands of the mayor and police that he be caught. The police start a crackdown on criminal operations, dive bars and hangouts in the city, hoping that the murderer will turn up in one of the many raids. This pressure is preventing the city&#x27;s crime syndicate from doing business, and its boss, Marshall (Martin Gabel), organizes his forces to find and stop the murderer so that the police will stop the crackdown and Marshall can go back to business as usual. Meanwhile, Police Inspector Carney (Howard Da Silva) has a psychiatrist examining patients who have been released from mental hospitals as possible suspects.

At the same time that the police focus on Harrow, finding incriminating evidence—the shoes of the dead children—in his apartment, the criminals track him down with his intended next victim. They capture him, and place him on trial by his &quot;peers&quot; in the Los Angeles criminal underworld. Harrow makes an impassioned plea for his life, explaining that he is unable to stop himself from committing his unspeakable crimes. Just as he is about to be killed by the crowd, the police arrive to take him away, but not before Marshall has shot and killed his alcoholic lawyer, Dan Langley (Luther Adler).

==Cast==
Cast notes:
*&quot;M&quot; marked the screen debut of Martin Gabel, an original member of Orson Welles&#x27; Mercury Theatre troupe.

==Production==
Producer Seymour Nebenzel&#x27;s Nero Films produced the original 1931 version of &quot;M&quot; directed by Fritz Lang, and Nebenzal retained the rights when he fled Nazi Germany and began to make films in Hollywood, primarily &quot;B&quot; pictures for major studios and low-budget independents. Nebenzal decided in 1950 to remake &quot;M&quot;, reset to Los Angeles—perhaps inspired by the anti-Communist mass hysteria then predominant in the country—and approached Lang about directing it, but Lang was appalled and outraged by the idea of anyone remaking a film he considered to be his masterpiece. Nebenzal then approached another expatriate German film director, Douglas Sirk, who also turned him down. Joseph Losey, however, took on the job, despite his being under suspicion of being a Communist by the FBI and the House Un-American Activities Committee. Losey registered discontent with Columbia Pictures’ financing of the film and the limitations placed on altering the structure of the Lang original. Denying that the film was merely a “remake,” Losey “regretted that he wasn’t able to make more extensive changes to the original.”

Losey&#x27;s casting included actors who were also under suspicion. Losey would later leave the U.S. and settle in the UK to make films there, notably his collaborations with writer Harold Pinter: &quot;The Servant&quot; (1963), &quot;Accident&quot; (1967) and &quot;The Go-Between&quot; (1971).

Robert Aldrich was Losey&#x27;s assistant director on &quot;M&quot;.

===Locations===
The film was shot on location in downtown Los Angeles, including the now demolished Victorian neighborhood of Bunker Hill. David Wayne&#x27;s character lived at an eccentric Victorian mansion on Bunker Hill Avenue known as the Max Heindel house because Heindel, a famous astrologer in the early 20th century, had once lived there. Some scenes were shot on and around the funicular Angels Flight on Third Street. The most spectacular footage occurs in a lengthy sequence shot inside the Bradbury Building on the southeast corner of Broadway and Third, a block east of Angels Flight. Losey used the basement, the distinctive stairways and balconies, and the roof of the building.

==Reception==
When the film was released, an anonymous reviewer at &quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;David Wayne, as the killer of small children, is effective and convincing. Luther Adler, as a drunken lawyer member of a gangster mob, turns in an outstanding performance, as do Martin Gabel, the gang-leader, and Howard da Silva and Steve Brodie as police officials ... Joseph Losey&#x27;s direction has captured the gruesome theme skilfully.&quot; Wayne in particular received good reviews.

Fritz Lang remarked that the release of the 1951 film earned his 1931 original the best reviews of his career.

==Censorship==
&quot;M&quot; was boycotted in some cities because of director Losey&#x27;s political views.

The film was classified by Ohio film censors as unacceptable for public screenings. At the end of 1953, the film&#x27;s producers appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, and in 1954, &quot;M&quot; was approved for exhibition in Ohio without any cuts.

==Comparison to Lang’s 1931 original==
Just as the rising threat of fascism in Germany informed director Fritz Lang’s 1931 original production, Losey’s treatment was influenced by the Red Scare and blacklist of the late 1940s and 1950s. In his &quot;M&quot;, a reactionary community proves itself “mercilessly efficient in exorcizing alien elements from its midst.”

Film historian Foster Hirsch points to stylistic and thematic parallels between the two versions, but cautions that Losey may suffer from comparisons. Lang demonstrated “unsurpassed” cinematic control over his resources: “his M is the work of a film master.” Losey’s remake was crafted when he was developing his talents, lacking the “experience and artistic freedom to compete with Lang.” Studio constraints limited Losey to making stylistic facsimile of the earlier film, and, “wasn’t permitted a truly original handling of the material.” Nonetheless, similarities emerge:

Losey diverges sharply from Lang’s &quot;M&quot; in his conception of the pedophilic murderer. Peter Lorre’s diminutive “M” in the original is furtive, socially isolated and distinctly repellent. Losey’s sociopath, played by David Wayne, is by all appearances a well-adjusted Midwesterner. As such, he makes a favorable first impression on the local community. Wayne’s confession and plea for psychiatric treatment suggests the possibility of redemption and pity from the community. Senses of Cinema’s Dan Callahan reports that “Wayne delivers this complex speech superbly (Losey reports that when he finished the cast and crew burst into applause.”

Lorre’s “ecstatic” interpretation is reminiscent of characters from Greek mythology or Christian scripture, invoking “Orestes Pursued by the Furies, or Satan expelled from heaven and suffering the torments of hell.”

<doc id="1301791" wikidata="Q4864017" url="?curid=1301791" title="Barry Bishop (politician)">
<text>Barry Wilfred Bishop (born 31 August 1938) is a former Australian politician. He was the National Party member of the Victorian Legislative Council from October 1992 until November 2006, representing North Western Province.

Bishop was born and raised in the Swan Hill region, though he spent some time in Bendigo as a teenager. He spent the majority of his working life working as a primary producer, but became increasingly involved in the management of the industry as he grew older. This ultimately saw him serve terms as a member of key industry groups the Grain Elevators Board of Victoria (1979–1982) and the Australian Wheat Board (1982–1992). Bishop also worked in a variety of other roles, serving stints as Chairman of the Stored Grain Research Laboratory in Canberra, and as Director of the Bread Research Institute, and being involved with several Department of Agriculture Committees. In 1992, he was rewarded for his efforts in the area when the Australian Grains Institute awarded him the Miles Bourke Award for services to agriculture.

In addition to his work at state and national level, Bishop was also involved with farming issues in his own region for many years. He joined the National Party at a young age, and has been a delegate of the party&#x27;s Ultima branch since 1962. He has also served in a variety of positions with the regional branch of the Victorian Farmers Federation.

Bishop, then based out of Mildura, entered state politics at the 1992 state election, winning preselection for the safe National seat of North Western Province in the Legislative Council. In his first term in office, he served on four committees - the Public Bodies Review Committee, the Environment and Natural Resources Committee and the Legislative Council&#x27;s Printing and Standing Orders Committees. He was National Party Whip in the Legislative Council from 1996 to 1999.

The demise of the Kennett government saw a turbulent period for the party, as the coalition split at state level, with the National Party going its own way. This opened up a range of party positions, as the party now had to find people to fill the many portfolios that had been filled by its significantly larger coalition partner. When the party regrouped after the 2002 election, Bishop found himself in line for promotion, and he was subsequently appointed spokesperson for transport, roads, ports and commodities. He took on an additional committee post in 2003, joining the Road Safety Committee.

Bishop announced his intention to retire at the 2006 state election in April 2005, citing changes to the Legislative Council which would have forced him to contest preselection for an easily winnable seat in a larger electorate against fellow MLCs Bill Baxter and Damian Drum, as well as the desire to give a younger person the opportunity to represent his area. Since that time he has been an advocate for aged care in regional Victoria.

<doc id="1301798" wikidata="Q4706273" url="?curid=1301798" title="Alan Budd">
<text>Sir Alan Peter Budd (16 November 1937 – 13 January 2023) was a British economist, who was a founding member of the Bank of England&#x27;s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) in 1997.

Budd left the MPC in May 1999, and between August 1999 and 2008 was Provost of The Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford.

Budd was temporarily head of Her Majesty&#x27;s Government&#x27;s Office for Budget Responsibility during 2010.

==Education==
Budd went to Oundle School, a public school in Northamptonshire, and then studied at the London School of Economics where he received a B.Sc. degree in economics. He subsequently went to the University of Oxford where he received an MA degree and a D.Phil. degree and to the University of Cambridge where he obtained a Ph.D. degree.

His academic posts included the University of Southampton, Carnegie-Mellon University, University of Pittsburgh (Ford foundation visiting professor), and the University of New South Wales (Reserve Bank of Australia visiting professor).

==Economic positions==
After various academic roles, he became senior economic advisor to HM Treasury between 1970 and 1974. Alan Budd was featured in Adam Curtis&#x27;s 1992 documentary Pandora&#x27;s Box, in which he was being interviewed about his time as economic advisor to the treasury. 

From 1979 to 1981 he was Special Adviser at the Treasury in Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s government. Reflecting on his position during this time, Budd expressed concerns that the policies that were implemented to allegedly reduce inflation might, in fact, have had a hidden agenda. In a documentary interview, Budd postulated that Thatcher&#x27;s actual goal might have been to deliberately raise unemployment in order to reduce the strength of the working classes and re-create a reserve army of labour to allow capitalists to make high profits.

During the 1980s he was a professor of economics and director of the Centre for Economic Forecasting at the London Business School. Other appointments have included group economic adviser, Barclays Bank (1989–91), and membership of the advisory board for Research Councils (1990–91).

Between 1991 and 1997, he was chief economic adviser to the Treasury, and headed the government economic service.

Among his activities as an economist, he was a governor of the &quot;National Institute for Economic and Social Research&quot;; a founder member of the UK-Japan &quot;21st Century Group&quot;; an executive editor of &quot;World Economics&quot; and a member of the editorial advisory board of the &quot;Oxford Review of Economic Policy&quot;. He was also a senior adviser to Credit Suisse First Boston and a consultant to the G8 Group. In 2005, he was appointed to the board of the IG Group, a spread betting firm founded by Stuart Wheeler.

==Public profile==

Budd was a member of the Independent Review Panel on the Future Funding of the BBC (1999), and chairman of the Gambling Review Body which produced the Gambling Review Report (2001). In 2004 he was asked to investigate the circumstances surrounding the issue of a visa to the nanny of Kimberly Quinn, the lover of David Blunkett, the then Home Secretary; Budd&#x27;s report concluded that there was no evidence that Mr Blunkett had personally interfered in the visa application, but that he was &quot;able to establish a chain of events linking Mr Blunkett to the change in the decision on [the] application.&quot; Blunkett resigned as home secretary after being told in advance of the report&#x27;s findings.

Budd was elected Provost (1999–2008) of The Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford University and later was an Honorary Fellow of the college.

In May 2010 he came out of retirement to be the interim Chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility, set up by Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne to assess the state of public finances and issue economic forecasts.

Budd described this as &quot;the most exciting challenge of my professional life&quot;. In July 2010 it was announced that he would not continue in the role after his initial 3-month contract expired.

The &quot;Financial Times&quot; reported &quot;His departure was expected and Budd had let it be known privately that he had never intended to serve as chairman of the OBR for anything other than a short period. His contract spanned the emergency Budget, leaving enough time thereafter to advise on the legislation needed to establish the OBR on a permanent basis.&quot;

==Personal life and death==
Budd married Susan Millott in 1964, and they had three sons. He died of a suspected heart attack on 13 January 2023, at the age of 85.

==Honours==
Budd was knighted in the 1997 New Year Honours. He was awarded an Honorary DSc degree by the University of Salford in 2008. He was appointed Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE) in the 2013 New Year Honours for services to economic policy and the Office for Budget Responsibility.

<doc id="1301827" wikidata="Q849168" url="?curid=1301827" title="Last universal common ancestor">
<text>The last universal common ancestor (LUCA) is the hypothesized common ancestral cell from which the three domains of life, the Bacteria, the Archaea, and the Eukarya originated. The cell had a lipid bilayer; it possessed the genetic code and ribosomes which translated from DNA or RNA to proteins. The LUCA probably existed at latest 3.6 billion years ago, and possibly as early as 4.3 billion years ago or earlier. The nature of this point or stage of divergence remains a topic of research.
All earlier forms of life preceding this divergence and all extant organisms are generally thought to share common ancestry. On the basis of a formal statistical test, this theory of a universal common ancestry (UCA) is supported versus competing multiple-ancestry hypotheses. The first universal common ancestor (FUCA) is a hypothetical non-cellular ancestor to LUCA and other now-extinct sister lineages.
Whether the genesis of viruses falls before or after the LUCA–as well as the diversity of extant viruses and their hosts–remains a subject of investigation.
While no fossil evidence of the LUCA exists, the detailed biochemical similarity of all current life (divided into the three domains) makes its existence widely accepted by biochemists. Its characteristics can be inferred from shared features of modern genomes. These genes describe a complex life form with many co-adapted features, including transcription and translation mechanisms to convert information from DNA to mRNA to proteins.
== Historical background ==

A phylogenetic tree directly portrays the idea of evolution by descent from a single ancestor. An early tree of life was sketched by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck in his &quot;Philosophie zoologique&quot; in 1809. Charles Darwin more famously proposed the theory of universal common descent through an evolutionary process in his book &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; in 1859: &quot;Therefore I should infer from analogy that probably all the organic beings which have ever lived on this earth have descended from some one primordial form, into which life was first breathed.&quot; The last sentence of the book begins with a restatement of the hypothesis:
The term &quot;last universal common ancestor&quot; or &quot;LUCA&quot; was first used in the 1990s for such a primordial organism.

== Inferring LUCA&#x27;s features ==

=== Biochemical mechanisms ===

While the anatomy of the LUCA cannot be reconstructed with certainty, its biochemical mechanisms can be deduced and described in some detail, based on properties shared by currently living organisms as well as genetic analysis.

The LUCA certainly had genes and a genetic code. Its genetic material was most likely DNA, so that it lived after the RNA world. The DNA was kept double-stranded by an enzyme, DNA polymerase, which recognises the structure and directionality of DNA. The integrity of the DNA was maintained by a group of repair enzymes including DNA topoisomerase. If the genetic code was based on dual-stranded DNA, it was expressed by copying the information to single-stranded RNA. The RNA was produced by a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase using nucleotides similar to those of DNA. It had multiple DNA-binding proteins, such as histone-fold proteins. The genetic code was expressed into proteins. These were assembled from 20 free amino acids by translation of a messenger RNA via a mechanism of ribosomes, transfer RNAs, and a group of related proteins.

Although LUCA was likely not capable of sexual interaction, gene functions were present that promoted the transfer of DNA between individuals of the population to facilitate genetic recombination. Homologous gene products that promote genetic recombination are present in bacteria, archaea and eukaryota, such as the RecA protein in bacteria, the RadA protein in archaea, and the Rad51 and Dmc1 proteins in eukaryota.

The functionality of LUCA as well as evidence for the early evolution of membrane-dependent biological systems together suggest that LUCA had cellularity and cell membranes. As for the cell&#x27;s structure, it contained a water-based cytoplasm effectively enclosed by a lipid bilayer membrane; it was capable of reproducing by cell division. It tended to exclude sodium and concentrate potassium by means of specific ion transporters (or ion pumps). The cell multiplied by duplicating all its contents followed by cellular division. The cell used chemiosmosis to produce energy. It also reduced CO2 and oxidized H2 (methanogenesis or acetogenesis) via acetyl-thioesters.

By phylogenetic bracketing, analysis of the presumed LUCA&#x27;s offspring groups, LUCA appears to have been a small, single-celled organism. It likely had a ring-shaped coil of DNA floating freely within the cell. Morphologically, it would likely not have stood out within a mixed population of small modern-day bacteria. The originator of the three-domain system, Carl Woese, stated that in its genetic machinery, the LUCA would have been a &quot;simpler, more rudimentary entity than the individual ancestors that spawned the three [domains] (and their descendants)&quot;. 

Because both bacteria and archaea have differences in the structure of phospholipids and cell wall, ion pumping, most proteins involved in DNA replication, and glycolysis, it is inferred that LUCA had a permeable membrane without an ion pump. The emergence of Na+/H+ antiporters likely lead to the evolution of impermeable membranes present in eukaryotes, archaea, and bacteria. It is stated that &quot;The late and independent evolution of glycolysis but not gluconeogenesis is entirely consistent with LUCA being powered by natural proton gradients across leaky membranes. Several discordant traits are likely to be linked to the late evolution of cell membranes, notably the cell wall, whose synthesis depends on the membrane and DNA replication&quot;. Although LUCA likely had DNA, it is unknown if it could replicate DNA and is suggested to &quot;might just have been a chemically stable repository for RNA-based replication&quot;. It is likely that the permeable membrane of LUCA was composed of archaeal lipids (isoprenoids) and bacterial lipids (fatty acids). Isoprenoids would have enhanced stabilization of LUCA&#x27;s membrane in the surrounding extreme habitat. Nick Lane and coauthors state that &quot;The advantages and disadvantages of incorporating isoprenoids into cell membranes in different microenvironments may have driven membrane divergence, with the later biosynthesis of phospholipids giving rise to the unique G1P and G3P headgroups of archaea and bacteria respectively. If so, the properties conferred by membrane isoprenoids place the lipid divide as early as the origin of life&quot;.

A 2024 study suggests that LUCA&#x27;s genome was similar in size to that of modern prokaryotes, coding for some 2,600 proteins; that it respired anaerobically, and was an acetogen; and that it had an early CAS-based anti-viral immune system.

=== An anaerobic thermophile ===

An alternative to the search for &quot;universal&quot; traits is to use genome analysis to identify phylogenetically ancient genes. This gives a picture of a LUCA that could live in a geochemically harsh environment and is like modern prokaryotes. Analysis of biochemical pathways implies the same sort of chemistry as does phylogenetic analysis.

In 2016, Madeline C. Weiss and colleagues genetically analyzed 6.1 million protein-coding genes and 286,514 protein clusters from sequenced prokaryotic genomes representing many phylogenetic trees, and identified 355 protein clusters that were probably common to the LUCA. The results of their analysis are highly specific, though debated. They depict LUCA as &quot;anaerobic, CO2-fixing, H2-dependent with a Wood–Ljungdahl pathway (the reductive acetyl-coenzyme A pathway), N2-fixing and thermophilic. LUCA&#x27;s biochemistry was replete with FeS clusters and radical reaction mechanisms.&quot; The cofactors also reveal &quot;dependence upon transition metals, flavins, S-adenosyl methionine, coenzyme A, ferredoxin, molybdopterin, corrins and selenium. Its genetic code required nucleoside modifications and S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methylations.&quot; They show that methanogenic clostridia were basal, near the root of the phylogenetic tree, in the 355 protein lineages examined, and that the LUCA may therefore have inhabited an anaerobic hydrothermal vent setting in a geochemically active environment rich in H2, CO2, and iron, where ocean water interacted with hot magma beneath the ocean floor. It is even inferred that LUCA also grew from H2 and CO2 via the reverse incomplete Krebs cycle. Other metabolic pathways inferred in LUCA are the pentose phosphate pathway, glycolysis, and gluconeogenesis. Even if phylogenetic evidence may point to a hydrothermal vent environment for a thermophilic LUCA, this does not constitute evidence that the origin of life took place at a hydrothermal vent since mass extinctions may have removed previously existing branches of life. 

Weiss and colleagues write that &quot;Experiments ... demonstrate that ... acetyl-CoA pathway [chemicals used in anaerobic respiration] formate, methanol, acetyl moieties, and even pyruvate arise spontaneously ... from CO2, native metals, and water&quot;, a combination present in hydrothermal vents.

An experiment shows that Zn2+, Cr3+, and Fe can promote 6 of the 11 reactions of an ancient anabolic pathway called the reverse Krebs cycle in acidic conditions which implies that LUCA might have inhabited either hydrothermal vents or acidic metal-rich hydrothermal fields.

=== Undersampled protein families ===

Some other researchers have challenged Weiss et al.&#x27;s 2016 conclusions. Sarah Berkemer and Shawn McGlynn argue that Weiss et al. undersampled the families of proteins, so that the phylogenetic trees were not complete and failed to describe the evolution of proteins correctly. There are two risks in attempting to attribute LUCA&#x27;s environment from near-universal gene distribution (as in Weiss et al. 2016). On the one hand, it risks misattributing convergence or horizontal gene transfer events to vertical descent; on the other hand, it risks misattributing potential LUCA gene families as horizontal gene transfer events. A phylogenomic and geochemical analysis of a set of proteins that probably traced to the LUCA show that it had K+-dependent GTPases and the ionic composition and concentration of its intracellular fluid was seemingly high K+/Na+ ratio, , Fe2+, CO2+, Ni2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, pyrophosphate, and which would imply a terrestrial hot spring habitat. It possibly had a phosphate-based metabolism. Further, these proteins were unrelated to autotrophy (the ability of an organism to create its own organic matter), suggesting that the LUCA had a Heterotrophic lifestyle (consuming organic matter) and that its growth was dependent on organic matter produced by the physical environment. 

The presence of the energy-handling enzymes CODH/acetyl-coenzyme A synthase in LUCA could be compatible not only with being an autotroph but also with life as a mixotroph or heterotroph. Weiss et al. in 2018 replied that no enzyme defines a trophic lifestyle, and that heterotrophs evolved from autotrophs.

A 2024 study directly estimated the order in which amino acids were added into the genetic code from early protein sequences. It found that amino acids that bind metals, and those that contain sulphur, came early in the sequence. The study suggests that sulphur metabolism and catalysis involving metals were important elements of life at the time of LUCA.

=== Possibly a mesophile ===

Several lines of evidence suggest that LUCA was non-thermophilic. The content of G + C nucleotide pairs (compared to the occurrence of A + T pairs) can indicate an organism&#x27;s thermal optimum as they are more thermally stable due to an additional hydrogen bond. As a result they occur more frequently in the rRNA of thermophiles; however this is not seen in LUCA&#x27;s reconstructed rRNA.

The identification of thermophilic genes in the LUCA has been challenged, as they may instead represent genes that evolved later in archaea or bacteria, then migrated between these via horizontal gene transfer, as in Woese&#x27;s 1998 hypothesis. For instance, the thermophile-specific topoisomerase, reverse gyrase, was initially attributed to LUCA before an exhaustive phylogenetic study revealed a more recent origin of this enzyme followed by extensive horizontal gene transfer. LUCA could have been a mesophile that fixed CO2 and relied on H2, and lived close to hydrothermal vents.

Further evidence that LUCA was mesophilic comes from the amino acid composition of its proteins. The abundance of I, V, Y, W, R, E, and L amino acids (denoted IVYWREL) in an organism&#x27;s proteins is correlated with its optimal growth temperature. According to phylogenetic analysis, the IVYWREL content of LUCA&#x27;s proteins suggests its ideal temperature was below 50°C.

Evidence that bacteria and archaea both independently underwent phases of increased and subsequently decreased thermo-tolerance suggests a dramatic post-LUCA climate shift that affected both populations and would explain the seeming genetic pervasiveness of thermo-tolerant genetics.

== Age ==

Studies from 2000 to 2018 have suggested an increasingly ancient time for the LUCA. In 2000, estimates of the LUCA&#x27;s age ranged from 3.5 to 3.8 billion years ago in the Paleoarchean, a few hundred million years before the earliest fossil evidence of life, for which candidates range in age from 3.48 to 4.28 billion years ago. This placed the origin of the first forms of life shortly after the Late Heavy Bombardment which was thought to have repeatedly sterilized Earth&#x27;s surface. However, a 2018 study by Holly Betts and colleagues applied a molecular clock model to the genomic and fossil record (102 species, 29 common protein-coding genes, mostly ribosomal), concluding that LUCA preceded the Late Heavy Bombardment (making the LUCA over 3.9 billion years ago). A 2022 study suggested an age of around 3.6-4.2 billion years for the LUCA. A 2024 study suggested that the LUCA lived around 4.2 billion years ago (with a confidence interval of 4.09–4.33 billion years ago).

== Root of the tree of life ==

In 1990, a novel concept of the tree of life was presented, dividing the living world into three stems, classified as the domains Bacteria, Archaea, Eukarya. It is the first tree founded exclusively on molecular phylogenetics, and which includes the evolution of microorganisms. It has been called a &quot;universal phylogenetic tree in rooted form&quot;. This tree and its rooting became the subject of debate.

In the meantime, numerous modifications of this tree, mainly concerning the role and importance of horizontal gene transfer for its rooting and early ramifications have been suggested (e.g.). Since heredity occurs both vertically and horizontally, the tree of life may have been more weblike or netlike in its early phase and more treelike when it grew three-stemmed. Presumably horizontal gene transfer has decreased with growing cell stability.

A modified version of the tree, based on several molecular studies, has its root between a monophyletic domain Bacteria and a clade formed by Archaea and Eukaryota. A small minority of studies place the root in the domain bacteria, in the phylum Bacillota, or state that the phylum Chloroflexota (formerly Chloroflexi) is basal to a clade with Archaea and Eukaryotes and the rest of bacteria (as proposed by Thomas Cavalier-Smith). Metagenomic analyses recover a two-domain system with the domains Archaea and Bacteria; in this view of the tree of life, Eukaryotes are derived from Archaea. With the later gene pool of LUCA&#x27;s descendants, sharing a common framework of the AT/GC rule and the standard twenty amino acids, horizontal gene transfer would have become feasible and could have been common.

The nature of LUCA remains disputed. In 1994, on the basis of primordial metabolism (sensu Wächtershäuser), Otto Kandler proposed a successive divergence of the three domains of life from a multiphenotypical &quot;population&quot; of pre-cells, reached by gradual evolutionary improvements (cellularization). These phenotypically diverse pre-cells were metabolising, self-reproducing entities exhibiting frequent mutual exchange of genetic information. Thus, in this scenario there was no &quot;first cell&quot;. It may explain the unity and, at the same time, the partition into three lines (the three domains) of life. Kandler&#x27;s pre-cell theory is supported by Wächtershäuser. In 1998, Carl Woese, based on the RNA world concept, proposed that no individual organism could be considered a LUCA, and that the genetic heritage of all modern organisms derived through horizontal gene transfer among an ancient community of organisms. Other authors concur that there was a &quot;complex collective genome&quot; at the time of the LUCA, and that horizontal gene transfer was important in the evolution of later groups; Nicolas Glansdorff states that LUCA &quot;was in a metabolically and morphologically heterogeneous community, constantly shuffling around genetic material&quot; and &quot;remained an evolutionary entity, though loosely defined and constantly changing, as long as this promiscuity lasted.&quot; 

The theory of a universal common ancestry of life is widely accepted. In 2010, based on &quot;the vast array of molecular sequences now available from all domains of life,&quot; D. L. Theobald published a &quot;formal test&quot; of universal common ancestry (UCA). This deals with the common descent of all extant terrestrial organisms, each being a genealogical descendant of a single species from the distant past. His formal test favoured the existence of a universal common ancestry over a wide class of alternative hypotheses that included horizontal gene transfer. Basic biochemical principles imply that all organisms do have a common ancestry.

A proposed, earlier, non-cellular ancestor to LUCA is the First universal common ancestor (FUCA). FUCA would therefore be the ancestor to every modern cell as well as ancient, now-extinct cellular lineages not descendant of LUCA. FUCA is assumed to have had other descendants than LUCA, none of which have modern descendants. Some genes of these ancient now-extinct cell lineages are thought to have been horizontally transferred into the genome of early descendants of LUCA.

== LUCA and viruses ==

The origin of viruses remains disputed. Since viruses need host cells for their replication, it is likely that they emerged &quot;after&quot; the formation of cells. Viruses may even have multiple origins and different types of viruses may have evolved independently over the history of life. There are different hypotheses for the origins of viruses, for instance an early viral origin from the RNA world or a later viral origin from selfish DNA.

Based on how viruses are currently distributed across the bacteria and archaea, the LUCA is suspected of having been prey to multiple viruses, ancestral to those that now have those two domains as their hosts. Furthermore, extensive virus evolution seems to have preceded the LUCA, since the jelly-roll structure of capsid proteins is shared by RNA and DNA viruses across all three domains of life. LUCA&#x27;s viruses were probably mainly dsDNA viruses in the groups called &quot;Duplodnaviria&quot; and &quot;Varidnaviria&quot;. Two other single-stranded DNA virus groups within the &quot;Monodnaviria&quot;, the &quot;Microviridae&quot; and the &quot;Tubulavirales&quot;, likely infected the last bacterial common ancestor. The last archaeal common ancestor was probably host to spindle-shaped viruses. All of these could well have affected the LUCA, in which case each must since have been lost in the host domain where it is no longer extant. By contrast, RNA viruses do not appear to have been important parasites of LUCA, even though straightforward thinking might have envisaged viruses as beginning with RNA viruses directly derived from an RNA world. Instead, by the time the LUCA lived, RNA viruses had probably already been out-competed by DNA viruses.

LUCA might have been the ancestor to some viruses, as it might have had at least two descendants: LUCELLA, the Last Universal Cellular Ancestor, the ancestor to all cells, and the archaic virocell ancestor, the ancestor to large-to-medium-sized DNA viruses. Viruses might have evolved before LUCA but after the First universal common ancestor (FUCA), according to the reduction hypothesis, where giant viruses evolved from primordial cells that became parasitic.

<text>The Agora (; plural Agorot ; , . , &quot;&quot;) is a denomination of the currency of Israel. The Israeli currency – the Israeli new shekel (ILS)– is divided into 100 agorot.

==History==
The name &quot;agora&quot; refers to the subunits of three distinct Israeli currencies.

This name was used for the first time in 1960, when the Israeli government decided to change the subdivision of the Israeli pound (, &quot;lira&quot;) from 1,000 prutah to 100 agorot due to the currency&#x27;s depreciation. The name was suggested by the Academy of the Hebrew Language, and was borrowed from the Hebrew Bible:
The term &quot;piece of silver&quot; appears in Hebrew as &quot;agorat kessef&quot;.

In 1980 the Israeli pound was replaced by the shekel at a rate of IL10 per IS 1. The new subdivision of the shekel was named &quot;agora ẖadaša&quot; (&quot;new agora&quot;). There were 100 new agorot in 1 shekel. The high rate of inflation in Israel in the early 1980s forced the Israeli government to change the Israeli currency once again in 1985. The new shekel was introduced at a rate of 1000 S per 1 NS. The name agora was used once again for its subdivision. This time the term &quot;new&quot; was avoided, in order to prevent confusion with the older subdivision (the pre-1980 agora was long since out of circulation).
Currently, the term agora refers to the 100th part of the new shekel. There are coins of 10 and 50 agorot, though the 50 agorot coin bears the inscription: &quot; New Shekel&quot;.

The 1 agora coin was withdrawn from circulation on April 1, 1991 by the Bank of Israel, as was the 5 agorot coin on January 1, 2008; in each case the value had shrunk to much less than the cost of production. Cash rounding has since been applied for purchases, such that the total price is now rounded to the nearest multiple of 10 agorot for payment in cash, but to 1 agora for payment by other means like payment cards or cheques.

<doc id="1301844" wikidata="Q5190283" url="?curid=1301844" title="Crutching">
<text>Crutching refers to the removal of wool from around the tail and between the rear legs of a sheep for hygiene purposes. It can also refer to removing wool from the heads of sheep (&quot;wigging&quot; or &quot;eye-wooling&quot;). It does not refer to the process of mulesinga controversial procedure that involves removing of strips of wool-bearing skin from around the breech (buttocks) of a sheep.

==Motivation==
Through centuries of selective breeding, most recently through artificial insemination, domestic sheep have denser and longer wool than their wild forebears, which may require human intervention to maintain. Sheep with heavy fleeces of wool often develop stains or on their rear ends from faeces. In ewes, urine can also stain the wool. To avoid discomfort to the sheep and damage to the fleece, graziers remove the wool (and any dags) from the sheep.

Urine and watery faeces from eating spring grass can also lead to myiasis (fly-strike), which occurs when flies lay eggs in warm, damp wool and the fly larvae grow and eat into the sheep. Crutching is an effective way to help prevent this; in some areas, crutching is carried out at the start of the fly season (which depends on local climatic conditions) and may be needed at intervals of 6–8 weeks in high fly risk conditions.

Rams and wethers may also be rung (crutched) on the belly around the pizzle (genitals) to prevent fly-strike there.

Wigging (removal of wool from the head of sheep) is carried out to prevent the sheep from becoming &quot;wool blind&quot;, in which the wool covers the sheep&#x27;s eyes. It also prevents accumulation of grass seeds and burrs in wool around the head as a sheep grazes. Both these problems are more severe in breeds with heavy wool growth such as Merinos.

In addition, ewes are generally crutched prior to lambing if they are not &quot;offshears&quot; (recently shorn), in order to provide the newborn lamb with a cleaner suckling area.

==Procedure==
Crutching is generally carried out in shearing sheds, using shearers and the same tools as for shearing the entire fleece, as crutching is simply shearing only a portion of the animal. Blade shears may be used, especially where an individual sheep is particularly dirty, or flystruck. Generally, whole flocks are treated together. A mechanical shearing handpiece is used, and the graziers sit the sheep between their legs and shear the required portion of the sheep, leaving the main fleece to continue growing. There are also many varieties of crutching cradles which allow the sheep to be crutched with less physical strain to the operator.

For small flocks, a grazier might do the work single-handedly. For large flocks and stud sheep, graziers will hire shearers, or use a contractor who provides professional shearing teams to do the required work. The grazier would decide on the extent of crutching: the rear of the sheep is almost always shorn, whereas wool around the face, ears, underside and pizzle may also be removed depending on the circumstances such as the weather, length of fleece, and amount of seed or other impurities present in the fleece and the underlying reason for crutching (preventive of fly-strike, or to reduce the likelihood of stain in the fleece wool). Super fine wool Merino flocks are often given a light crutch, known as a New England crutch that removes less of the valuable fleece.

When a single or small number of sheep need crutching, graziers will often work in the paddock using dagging (or blade) shears or portable powered shearing gear instead of driving the sheep into the shearing shed and back.

==Related procedures==
Docking (removing) sheep&#x27;s tails has much the same benefits for the sheep as crutching. While this procedure may reduce the care needed to keep wool clean, regular crutching may still required for the reasons outlined above.

Crutching is different to mulesing where part of the wrinkled skin is removed, although they are closely related in that mulesed sheep require much less crutching. It is the excess wool which gets most soiled from urination and faeces, and which can be perceived to be particularly dirty due to green feeding, rapid changes in feed, or from problems such as internal parasites.

<doc id="1301846" wikidata="Q1046593" url="?curid=1301846" title="Gearbox Software">
<text>Gearbox Software, L.L.C is an American video game development company based in Frisco, Texas. It was established as a limited liability company in February 1999 by five developers formerly of Rebel Boat Rocker. Randy Pitchford, one of the founders, serves as president and chief executive officer. Gearbox initially created expansions for the Valve game &quot;Half-Life&quot;, then ported that game and others to console platforms. In 2005, Gearbox launched its first independent set of games, &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot;, on console and mobile devices. It became their flagship franchise and spun off a comic book series, television documentary, books, and action figures. Their second original game series, &quot;Borderlands&quot;, commenced in 2009, and by 2015 had sold over 26 million copies. The company also owns the intellectual property of &quot;Duke Nukem&quot; and &quot;Homeworld&quot;.

Gearbox expanded into publishing with the creation of Gearbox Publishing in 2015. A parent company, The Gearbox Entertainment Company, was established for Gearbox Software and Gearbox Publishing in 2019. Gearbox Entertainment was acquired by the Embracer Group in April 2021, becoming its seventh major label. A third division, Gearbox Studios, focusing on television and film productions, was established in October 2021. Due to major restructuring following a failed investment, Embracer announced plans to divest Gearbox to Take-Two Interactive, who had previously published several of Gearbox&#x27;s games under its 2K label, in March 2024. Take-Two Interactive closed the Gearbox Software acquisition on June 12, 2024.

== History ==
===Formation and initial growth (1999–2008)===

Gearbox Software was founded on February 16, 1999, by Randy Pitchford, Brian Martel, Stephen Bahl, Landon Montgomery and Rob Heironimus, five developers formerly of Rebel Boat Rocker. Before Rebel Boat Rocker, Pitchford and Martel previously worked together at 3D Realms, and Montgomery previously worked at Bethesda Softworks. By 2000, the company employed 15 people.

They started with developing expansions to Valve&#x27;s &quot;Half-Life&quot;. Porting &quot;Half-Life&quot; to console platforms (each with new game content) followed, building the company&#x27;s experience in console game-making, in addition to enhancing and building upon the successful &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; branch of the &quot;Half-Life&quot; franchise. Prior to &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;, they had developed or helped develop every &quot;Half-Life&quot; expansion game or port, including &quot;Opposing Force&quot;, &quot;Blue Shift&quot;, &quot;Counter-Strike: Condition Zero&quot;, &quot;Half-Life&quot; for the Sony PlayStation 2 (including &quot;Half-Life: Decay&quot;), and &quot;Half-Life&quot; for the Sega Dreamcast (including &quot;Blue Shift&quot;). Branching out to other publishers, they pursued additional port work, each game being released with additional content, but this time from console to PC. These projects included their first non-first-person shooter, &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 3&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, forging new publisher relationships with Activision and Microsoft Game Studios respectively. Additional new development, in the form of a PC game in the James Bond franchise (&quot;James Bond 007: Nightfire&quot;) for Electronic Arts, also occurred during the company&#x27;s initial 5-year period.

In 2005, they launched an original property of their creation, &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot;, with the release of &quot;Brothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30&quot; on the Xbox, PC and PlayStation 2. Later that year a sequel, &quot;Brothers in Arms: Earned in Blood&quot;, was launched. In 2008, &quot;Brothers in Arms: Hell&#x27;s Highway&quot; was released.

2007 brought announcements of new projects based on licensed film intellectual properties, including the crime drama &quot;Heat&quot; and the science-fiction classic &quot;Aliens&quot;. In the September 2007 issue of Game Informer, Pitchford stated that development on the &quot;Heat&quot; game had not yet begun, as the planned development partner for the project had gone under. This was followed by an announcement by Sega that they would be helming a new version of rhythm game &quot;Samba de Amigo&quot; for the Wii, a departure from their signature first-person shooter titles.

===&quot;Borderlands&quot; and studio expansion (2009–2015)===
Work on a new intellectual property, &quot;Borderlands&quot;, began around 2005 and was first announced in 2007. Pitchford likened the game as a combination of computer role-playing games such as &quot;Diablo&quot; and &quot;NetHack&quot;, and first-person shooters like &quot;Duke Nukem&quot;. Defining features of &quot;Borderlands&quot; was its outlined graphical style and its procedurally-generated loot system that was capable of generating millions of different guns and other gear items. &quot;Borderlands&quot; was released in October 2009, published by 2K, a subsidiary of Take-Two Interactive. By August 2011, had sold over 4.5 million copies, making it a critical success for Gearbox and allowing them to expand the studio and budgets for subsequent games. Subsequently, Gearbox developed two additional games in the video game series, &quot;Borderlands 2&quot; (2012) and &quot;Borderlands 3&quot; (2019), as well as the spin-off title &quot;Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands&quot; (2022), and the series has spawn additional games from other studios under 2K/Take-Two or through license, including &quot;&quot; by 2K Australia, and &quot;Tales from the Borderlands&quot; from Telltale Games. Gearbox and Take-Two have also partnered with Lionsgate to develop a live-action &quot;Borderlands&quot; film, which was released on August 9, 2024.

In July 2013, Gearbox announced plans to rerelease &quot;Homeworld&quot; and &quot;Homeworld 2&quot; in high definition for modern PC platforms, in addition to making it available through digital distributors.

In July 2014, Randy Pitchford formally contested the &quot;&quot; class action lawsuit stating the game had cost them millions of their own money and the advertising was solely the fault of the publisher.

In December 2015, Gearbox opened a second development studio in Quebec City, Canada. The studio is run by Sebastien Caisse and former Activision art director Pierre-Andre Dery. The team consists of over 100 members and is contributing to the development of original AAA titles.

===Restructuring and acquisition by Embracer Group (2015–2024)===
Gearbox established Gearbox Publishing in 2015, first announced to the public in December 2016, as to publish third-party games, starting with the remastered version of &quot;Bulletstorm&quot; from People Can Fly. Pitchford said that they wanted to start expanding into other areas of capital growth beyond games that Gearbox was traditionally known for, and planned to use Gearbox Publishing as a starting point. Later, in May 2019, Gearbox established The Gearbox Entertainment Company, Inc. (Gearbox Entertainment) as a parent company for both Gearbox Software and Gearbox Publishing.

Co-founder Landon Montgomery, who had left the company around 2007, died on March 25, 2020.

In April 2021, Gearbox Entertainment was wholly acquired by the Embracer Group for precisely $363 million rising to $1,378 million should they reach specific operational targets. This addition would be the company&#x27;s seventh major publishing group. Pitchford stated that while they were looking to raise capital from 2016, they came to meet with Embracer, and saw that their decentralized studio model would work well for Gearbox. 2K remained on Gearbox&#x27;s board and continued to publish the &quot;Borderlands&quot; series.

Gearbox Entertainment opened a second Canadian studio, Gearbox Studio Montreal, in August 2021, to support 250 new staff, bringing the total size of Gearbox to around 850 employees.

Gearbox announced the formation of Gearbox Studios as a third company under the Gearbox Entertainment Company on October 6, 2021, to oversee television and film productions, with Pitchford serving as Gearbox Studios president alongside as president and CEO of the parent company. Former CTO Steve Jones was named as president of Gearbox Software in Pitchford&#x27;s place. Embracer announced it intent to acquire Perfect World Entertainment in December 2021 and placing the group, including its publishing arm and Cryptic Studios, under the Gearbox Entertainment operating group. Following its acquisition in April 2022, Perfect World Entertainment was rebranded as Gearbox Publishing San Francisco, with the naming to be applied retroactively to past games published under Perfect World.

In April 2022, Gearbox Entertainment announced it will acquire Lost Boys Interactive, which had supported Gearbox in &quot;Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands&quot;. Later that November, Gearbox acquired the &quot;Risk of Rain&quot; IP from Hopoo Games, while Embracer transferred ownership of Volition to Gearbox Entertainment from Deep Silver following poor reception to its &quot;Saint&#x27;s Row&quot; reboot. The studio would later shut down the following year due to the restructuring of Embracer Group. That same month, Eidos Shanghai, another studio under the Embracer Group, was transferred to Gearbox Publishing San Francisco and rebranded as Gearbox Studio Shanghai. 

Gearbox Entertainment acquired Captured Dimensions, a 3D modeling company from Texas, in January 2023. Later in the month, Gearbox laid off a sizeable portion of the staff at Lost Boys Interactive. According to a Washington state WARN notice, 125 employees lost their jobs.

=== Acquisition by Take-Two Interactive (2024–present) ===
Take-Two Interactive announced its plans to acquire Gearbox Entertainment and its intellectual properties from Embracer Group for $460 million on March 28, 2024, to be added under the 2K label. The acquisition also includes Gearbox Software with its satellite studios and Gearbox Publishing. Embracer will retain Gearbox San Francisco, Gearbox Shanghai, Lost Boys Interactive, Captured Dimensions, and Cryptic Studios, along with publishing rights to &quot;&quot;, &quot;Hyper Light Breaker&quot;, and other unannounced titles. Less than a day after the announcement, it was reported that an unknown number of employees were laid off from Gearbox. On June 12, 2024, Take-Two Interactive closed the Gearbox Software transaction.

==Company structure==
Following the acquisition, The Gearbox Entertainment Company operates as a studio within 2K.

Gearbox Software has two additional studios in addition to their main studios in Frisco, Texas; Gearbox Studio Montreal, and Gearbox Studio Québec. After the company was bought by Take-Two, many assets were retained by Embracer such as Lost Boys, Captured Dimensions and the San Francisco publishing division which was rebranded as Arc Games alongside several titles. The Gearbox Publishing division handled by The Gearbox Entertainment Company was later absorbed into 2K following Take-Two&#x27;s buyout of Gearbox.

== Games ==

=== &quot;Half-Life&quot; ===

Gearbox has developed a total of six games in the &quot;Half-Life&quot; series: the expansion packs &quot;Opposing Force&quot; and &quot;Blue Shift&quot;; ports of &quot;Half-Life&quot; for Dreamcast (which included &quot;Blue Shift&quot;) and &quot;Half-Life&quot; for PlayStation 2 (which included &quot;Half-Life: Decay&quot;); they also did a large amount of work on both the retail release of &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; and the main portion of &quot;Counter-Strike: Condition Zero&quot;.

=== &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; ===

During their fourth year, Gearbox began working on their first independently owned game: &quot;Brothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30&quot;. Developed for PC and Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox console, and built with the Unreal Engine 2, it was released in March 2005. The sequel, &quot;Brothers in Arms: Earned in Blood&quot;, followed seven months later. The series was published by Ubisoft, who supported both games with PlayStation 2 versions, and later worked with them to develop &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; games for portable systems (mobile phones, PlayStation Portable and Nintendo DS) and the Wii home console.

In 2005, Gearbox licensed the Unreal Engine 3 from Epic Games, to replace the Unreal Engine 2 technology used in previous games, and grew its internal development teams to handle the demands of next-generation technology and content. &quot;Brothers in Arms: Hell&#x27;s Highway&quot; was the first new title to be announced, continuing the company&#x27;s flagship franchise.

&quot;Brothers in Arms: Hell&#x27;s Highway&quot; was launched in September 2008. By 2008, the franchise also spun off a comic book series, a two-part television documentary, a line of action figures, and a novelization and non-fiction history book.

=== &quot;Borderlands&quot; series ===

After the completion of &quot;Brothers in Arms: Earned in Blood&quot;, Gearbox began working on their second original game, &quot;Borderlands&quot;. The game was envisioned by Pitchford as a combination of the roguelike genre with action role-playing games like &quot;Diablo&quot; in a first-person shooter. Set on the fictional planet Pandora, players control a Vault Hunter as they fight off the planet&#x27;s hostile wildlife and human forces while seeking a fabled Vault that is claimed to be filled with riches. Part of &quot;Borderlands&quot;″ features is the use of procedural generation to create the weapons and other gear that drop from defeating enemies or completing missions, with the first game featuring more than 15 million possible variations, according to Gearbox. &quot;Borderlands&quot; also features a cell-shaded-like art style giving the game a comic-book appearance.

&quot;Borderlands&quot; was released in 2009, and became an unexpected success for Gearbox, selling around three to four million copies by 2011. This has launched several followup games, including direct sequels &quot;Borderlands 2&quot; (2012), &quot;Borderlands 3&quot; (2019), and a planned &quot;Borderlands 4&quot;, the prequel &quot;&quot; (2015) and the spinoff title &quot;Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands&quot; (2023), all that expand on the series&#x27; mechanics. In addition, two interactive fiction games, &quot;Tales from the Borderlands&quot; (2014) and &quot;New Tales from the Borderlands&quot; (2022) have been released. A feature film, &quot;Borderlands&quot; (2024) has also been released.

=== &quot;Duke Nukem&quot; series ===

&quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot; had been a project with a troubled development history at 3D Realms, who had created the &quot;Duke Nukem&quot; series, since sometime prior to 2000. Due to financial difficulties in 2009, 3D Realms was forced to downsize and ultimately lay off most of the development staff. Take-Two Interactive sued 3D Realms for failing to deliver &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot;.

Pitchford, who had prior industry relations with many 3D Realms staff including George Broussard, learned that many of the 3D Realms team were still eager to develop &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot;, working out of their homes on what they could. Pitchford negotiated with Take-Two to bring many of the former 3D Realms staff into a new studio called Triptych Games, housed at Gearbox&#x27;s headquarters, to continue working on &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot; following 3D Realms&#x27; closure in 2009. As a result, 3D Realms sold the rights to &quot;Duke Nukem&quot; and the existing work on &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot; to Gearbox around February 2010. Take-Two and Gearbox subsequently announced in September 2010 that Gearbox would finish production of &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot;. &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot; was released in June 2011, and received negative critical reception on release, with most of the criticism directed towards the unfinished, rushed state of the game. Despite the criticism, the game topped the charts on release and made a profit.

3D Realms had initially sued Gearbox in June 2013 for unpaid royalties over &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot;, but dropped the suit by September 2013, with 3D Realms&#x27; founder Scott Miller stating that it was a misunderstanding on their part.

3D Realms was eventually acquired in part by Interceptor Entertainment, and in 2014, Interceptor announced plans to make a new &quot;Duke Nukem&quot; game, &quot;Duke Nukem: Mass Destruction&quot;. Gearbox filed suit against 3D Realms and Interceptor based on the fact that Gearbox now owned the rights to the &quot;Duke Nukem&quot; franchise. The case was settled out of court in August 2015, with 3D Realms and Interceptor acknowledging that Gearbox has full rights to the &quot;Duke Nukem&quot; series. Following the settlement, Gearbox released &quot;Duke Nukem 3D: 20th Anniversary Edition World Tour&quot; in September 2016. The game included new levels developed in conjunction with some of the original developers, re-recorded lines by original Duke voice actor Jon St. John, and new music from original composer Lee Jackson. It was released on October 11, 2016.

=== &quot;Aliens: Colonial Marines&quot; ===
&quot;&quot; was a result of Gearbox&#x27;s exploration into working on licensed film properties in 2007, and was developed under license from 20th Century Fox, who held the film rights, and Sega, who held the game publishing rights to the franchise. &quot;Aliens: Colonial Marines&quot; was planned as a first-person shooter, both single-player and multiplayer, with players as members of human squads facing the franchises titular xenomorphs in settings based on the films. Gearbox did initial development on the game, but as the studio started working on &quot;Borderlands&quot; and &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot;, they drew developers off &quot;Aliens&quot; though still collected full payments from Sega. Sega and 2K discovered the discrepancy on Gearbox&#x27;s allocation of its staff on its projects, which lead to a round of layoffs in 2008.

After Gearbox released &quot;Borderlands&quot; to critical acclaim in 2009, it began work on its sequel rather than re-allocating developers to &quot;Aliens&quot;. Instead, the studio outsourced the work to third parties, including Demiurge Studios, Nerve Software, and TimeGate Studios. By 2012, Gearbox took over full development of the game as it neared its planned release in February 2013, but due to the heavily outsourced process, the game&#x27;s state was haphazard, forcing Gearbox to cancel a planned beta period and rush the game through the final stages of production, certification, and distribution. On release, the game suffered from performance issues even on target hardware specifications, and shipped with a software bug that hampered the artificial intelligence of the xenomorphs in the game, making the game far less challenging than promised; it was discovered in 2019 that this bug was result of a typographic error in a configuration file shipped with the game. The game&#x27;s poor performance led Sega to cancel planned releases for the Wii U.

A class action lawsuit filed in April 2013 by Roger Damion Perrine and John Locke alleged that Gearbox and Sega falsely advertised &quot;Aliens: Colonial Marines&quot; by showing demos at trade shows that did not accurately represent the final product. Sega and the plaintiffs reached a settlement in late 2014, wherein Sega agreed to pay $1.25 million to the class. The plaintiffs dropped Gearbox from the suit in May 2015.

=== &quot;Battleborn&quot; ===

Released in May 2016, &quot;Battleborn&quot; was a cooperative first-person shooter video game with multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) elements. &quot;Battleborn&quot; takes place in a space fantasy setting where multiple races contest possession of the universe&#x27;s last star. Players select one of multiple pre-defined heroes, customized with passive abilities gained through end-of-mission loot, to complete both player-vs-player and player-vs-environment events. During such events, characters are leveled up through their &quot;Helix tree&quot;, granting one of two abilities at each level. While &quot;Battleborn&quot; was well received by critics, it was released within a month of Blizzard Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;Overwatch&quot;, a hero shooter with similar concepts, and which quickly overshadowed &quot;Battleborn&quot;. The title went free-to-play in June 2017 and was shut down in January 2021.

=== &quot;Homeworld series&quot; ===

After 10 years without any new releases to the series, Gearbox acquired the rights to the &quot;Homeworld&quot; series from THQ in 2013. Shortly after that the &quot;Homeworld Remastered Collection&quot; was released in 2015, containing updated High-Definition versions of &quot;Homeworld&quot; and &quot;Homeworld 2&quot; compatible with modern Windows and Mac OS X systems.

In September 2013, Gearbox announced a partnership with Blackbird Interactive and licensing the &quot;Homeworld&quot;-IP for their then-named &quot;Hardware: Shipbreakers&quot; game. This game later became &quot;&quot; and was released on January 20, 2016 as a prequel to the original &quot;Homeworld&quot; game of 1999.

On August 30, 2019, Gearbox announced &quot;Homeworld 3&quot; which was developed by &quot;Blackbird Interactive&quot;. The game&#x27;s development was at least partially funded through a crowdfunding campaign on the Fig platform, and was released May 13, 2024.

== Other media ==
A &quot;Borderlands&quot; film was released by Gearbox and Lionsgate in 2024, with Eli Roth as director.

In April 2020, Gearbox announced it was developing a television series based on its &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; series.

== Technology ==
In 2006, they partnered with Dell and Intel to provide development computer systems and technology for their studio.

In June 2007, they purchased a Moven motion capture system that uses non-optical inertia technology, to augment their existing Vicon optical motion capture system becoming one of the few independent developers with two in-house motion capture capabilities.

In February 2008, it was announced that they had licensed NaturalMotion&#x27;s Morpheme software.

<text>Mike Holober (born April 21, 1957) is an American jazz pianist, composer, arranger, and educator.

Holober moved to New York in 1986, and worked as a composer and sideman pianist. After working with baritone saxophonist Nick Brignola in the late 1990s, he formed The Mike Holober Quintet, featuring original compositions and arrangements performed by Tim Ries (saxophone), Wolfgang Muthspiel (guitar), Brian Blade (drums), and Scott Colley and John Patitucci (bass). The quintet recorded two albums on Sons of Sound: &quot;Canyon&quot; (2003) and &quot;Wish List&quot;(2006).

Holober&#x27;s big band, The Gotham Jazz Orchestra, released two recordings: &quot;thought Trains&quot; (Sons of Sound, 2004) and &quot;Quake&quot; (Sunnyside, 2009). The group&#x27;s most recent recording, &quot;Hiding Out&quot;, is due for release August 2019 on ZOHO. The double CD features &quot;Hiding Out&quot;&quot;,&quot; commissioned for by The Philadelphia Museum of Art (funded by the Pew Foundation), &quot;Flow,&quot; commissioned by the Westchester Jazz Orchestra (funded by a NYSCA Individual Artist&#x27;s Grant), and &quot;Jumble&quot;, commissioned by The U.S. Army Jazz Knights of West Point. The recording also includes an arrangement of Jobim&#x27;s &quot;Caminhos Cruzados&quot;, commissioned by the Westchester Jazz Orchestra and written for and featuring trumpet master Marvin Stamm. Other featured artists on &quot;Hiding Out&quot; include Billy Drewes, Jason Rigby, Scott Wendholt, Adam Kolker, Jon Gordon, Steve Cardenas, and Jesse Lewis.

Holober is a 2017-18 recipient of a Chamber Music America New Jazz Works Grant for &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Go&quot;, a song-cycle in the tradition of Robert Schumann, Samuel Barber, and Ralph Vaughn-Williams, and premiered at Symphony Space (The Leonard Nimoy Thalia) in June 2018. &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Go&quot; was written for Holober&#x27;s octet Balancing Act, whose premiere recording &quot;Balancing Act&quot; was released in 2015 (Palmetto), featuring Mike&#x27;s original compositions (several with lyrics), performed by Kate McGarry, Dick Oatts, Jason Rigby, Marvin Stamm, Mark Patterson, John Hebert, and Brian Blade.

Holober was the musical director of the Westchester Jazz Orchestra from 2007 to 2013, a non-profit organization based in Westchester New York. Under his leadership, the organization commissioned over 140 new works for jazz orchestra. Guest artists included Joe Lovano, Kate McGarry, Janis Siegal, John Scofield, John Patitucci, Randy Brecker, and Paquito D&#x27;Rivera. Holober also served as conductor, artistic director, and lead arranger for WJO&#x27;s 2011 release, &quot;Maiden Voyage Suite&quot;, a reworking of Herbie Hancock&#x27;s 1965 Blue Note recording.

Holober has worked with several big bands in Europe, including the HR-Bigband (Frankfurt), where he served as Associate Guest Conductor from 2011 to 2015, and the WDR Big Band (Cologne). Projects for the HR Big Band include arranging and conducting concert length projects for Kurt Rosenwinkel, Billy Cobham, Jane Monheit, Terje Rypdal, Dr. Lonnie Smith, Miguel Zenon, and &quot;Jazz From Hell&quot;, a concert of the works of Frank Zappa for the 2015 Frankfurt Jazz festival. With the WDR Big Band (WestDeutsche Rundfunk - Cologne, Germany) he has written and conducted projects for Avishai Cohen and Eli Degibri, and for drummer Al Foster. Other projects include arrangements for a concert featuring Eli Degibri with jazz orchestra and strings, which was performed at the National Opera House in Tel Aviv in 2014.

Holober is a full professor at The City College of New York and was named the inaugural Stuart Z. Katz Professor of Humanities and the Arts in 2018. He is a five-time MacDowell Fellow, Ucross Foundation Fellow and Yaddo Guest. He also teaches composing and arranging at The Manhattan School of Music. From 2007 - 2015 he served as associate director of the BMI Jazz Composer&#x27;s Workshop, where he taught with Musical Director Jim McNeely.

<doc id="1301881" wikidata="Q1856585" url="?curid=1301881" title="Senseo">
<text>Senseo is a registered trademark for a coffee brewing system from Dutch companies Philips and Douwe Egberts. The system is known for the coffee pods (called pads in some countries) it uses to brew the coffee.

==History==
The system was first introduced in the Netherlands in February 2001, followed by Belgium and France, Germany/Austria/and Denmark, United Kingdom and United States, and Australia (in chronological order). The Senseo was developed by WeLL Design. According to Philips, by 2005 ten million machines and four billion pads had been sold worldwide, by and over 20 million machines by 2008.

A new model of the Senseo machine, the Senseo New Generation, was launched in selected markets in 2007. This updated version allows the user to adjust the height of the mechanism to accommodate larger cups or mugs, has an indicator light function which shows when there is insufficient water for two cups (as opposed to the previous model which only showed whether there was sufficient water left for one cup), features a larger water reservoir and has an option which allows the user to adjust the amount of hot water used per cup.

The Senseo Latte Select machine was introduced in 2008, and features a separate milk reservoir. The machine utilizes the same coffee pods, and can produce three different variants of coffee with foam milk: Cappuccino, Café Latte and Latte macchiato. The three variants are not true brews though, as the machine cannot produce real espresso, but rather regular coffee, which is mixed with the foam milk. The machine can also produce regular coffee, and features three different strength settings.

In 2009 the Senseo Quadrante was introduced which features a new brick like design. The coffee pods are still the same, however the pod holder is designed differently. The Quadrante series also features a bigger water tank and allows the use of higher mugs through its three different mounting positions of the cup holder.

In November 2011 Sara Lee announced that they would discontinue selling the Senseo product line in North America.

Senseo pods can still be used with compatible drip-coffee-makers, made by Hamilton Beach.

In January 2018, a North American electric compatible Senseo coffee maker once again became available to the public; primarily from online sources, such as &quot;Daves Coffee Pods&quot;. The new Senseo Original XL HD7810/65 II Black USA Machine is an upgrade from prior models, and included the following features:
* An XL water tank;
* Intensity Select buttons which allow for a more or less intense tasting cup of coffee;
* Senseo&#x27;s &quot;Coffee Boost Technology&quot; which increased the number of water dispensing holes to 45, which the company claims will deliver a fuller extraction of the coffee.
Metal drip tray

==Aftermarket products==
Some aftermarket products allow consumers to use ground coffee in a Senseo coffee maker and avoid the higher cost of single-serve pods. The &quot;Coffeeduck&quot; is a durable filter that can be filled with coffee and placed in the Senseo machine to brew a cup of coffee (one Coffeeduck can be re-used thousands of times). There is also a device that allows one to make paper coffee pods with any chosen ground coffee.

==Blends==
The main blends are mild, regular, mocca, dark roast and extra dark and there is also a decaffeinated variety. The blends differ, according to general taste, in different countries. The special blends, Colombia, Kenya and Brazil are blended from arabica coffees from selected plantations and are a little more expensive than the normal blends. There are also coffee pods with added flavors, called Vienna, Rio de Janeiro, Sevilla &amp; Marrackech. More recent varieties launched in selected European markets include cappuccino, café choco and espresso. Douwe Egberts Senseo has launched a Hot Choco variety in Belgium and the Netherlands. Latest launches in Germany are the Guten Morgen breakfast blend and Caffé Crema, an Italian blend. In France, Maison du café Senseo has launched Noir Subtil.

==Patent disputes==
A European patent application with the aim &quot;to protect an assembly of pad holder and pad&quot;, i.e. the Senseo coffee pods, was filed on September 30, 1998, by the Dutch firm &quot;Sara Lee/DE N.V.&quot; The European Patent Office granted on July 11, 2001. The European patent took force in a number of Contracting States of the European Patent Convention, including Belgium.

=== Dispute in Belgium ===
On February 20, 2004, the Court of First Instance of Antwerp, Belgium, ruled in a lawsuit between three Belgian coffee vendors, N.V. Fort Koffiebranderij, S.A. Cafés Liégeois and N.V. Beyers Koffie, versus Philips and Douwe Egberts over the European patent, and decided that the other coffee vendors were allowed to produce and market coffee pods that fit the Senseo. The Senseo creators had used their patent to get an injunction against the marketing of coffee pods by other coffee brands, and those others replied by seeking a declaratory judgment of non-infringement. 

One consideration the Belgian judge offered for the ruling is that coffee pods already existed. That ruling ended the Senseo coffee pod monopoly, and following that ruling, practically every coffee vendor in the Benelux countries started production of coffee pods. The Antwerp ruling affects the patents on the pods, but does not affect the patents on the Senseo machine itself. 

An appeal in court changed this patent matter, and the new judgement was that the other coffee makers were infringing on the European patent in Belgium.

=== Revocation by the European Patent Office ===
In the meantime, the European patent was opposed before the European Patent Office by a number of companies including Kraft Foods and, on August 30, 2006, Sara Lee&#x27;s covering the Senseo pads was completely revoked on appeal by the European Patent Office. Suzanne Rotteveel, spokeswoman for Sara Lee in the Netherlands, said:

<doc id="1301887" wikidata="Q6522335" url="?curid=1301887" title="Lenders mortgage insurance">
<text>Lenders mortgage insurance (LMI), also known as private mortgage insurance (PMI) in the US, is a type of insurance payable to a lender or to a trustee for a pool of securities that may be required when taking out a mortgage loan. Its purpose is to offset losses in the case where a mortgagor is not able to repay the loan and the lender is not able to recover its costs after foreclosure and sale of the mortgaged property.

==Mortgage insurance in the US==
The annual cost of PMI varies and is expressed in terms of the total loan value in most cases, depending on the loan term, loan type, proportion of the total home value that is financed, the coverage amount, and the frequency of premium payments (monthly, annual, or single). The PMI may be payable up front, or it may be capitalized onto the loan in the case of single premium product. This type of insurance is usually only required if the downpayment is 20% or less of the sales price or appraised value (in other words, if the loan-to-value ratio (LTV) is 80% or more). Once the principal is reduced to 80% of value, the PMI is often no longer required on conventional loans. This can occur via the principal being paid down, via home value appreciation, or both. FHA loans often require refinancing to remove PMI, even after the LTV drops below 80%. The effective interest savings from paying off PMI can be substantial. In the case of lender-paid MI, the term of the policy can vary based upon the type of coverage provided (either primary insurance, or some sort of pool insurance policy). Borrowers typically have no knowledge of any lender-paid MI, in fact most &quot;No MI Required&quot; loans actually have lender-paid MI, which is funded through a higher interest rate that the borrower pays.

Sometimes lenders will require that mortgage insurance be paid for a fixed period (for example, 2 or 3 years), even if the principal reaches 80% sooner than that. Legally, there is no obligation to allow the cancellation of MI until the loan has amortized to a 78% LTV ratio based on the original purchase price. The cancellation request must come from the servicer of the mortgage to the PMI company who issued the insurance. Often the servicer will require a new appraisal to determine the LTV.

If borrowers have less than the 20% downpayment needed to avoid a mortgage insurance requirement, they might be able to make use of a second mortgage (sometimes referred to as a &quot;piggy-back loan&quot;) to make up the difference. Two popular versions of this lending technique are the so-called 80/10/10 and 80/15/5 arrangements. Both involve obtaining a primary mortgage for 80% LTV. An 80/10/10 program uses a 10% LTV second mortgage with a 10% downpayment, and an 80/15/5 program uses a 15% LTV second mortgage with a 5% downpayment. Other combinations of second mortgage and downpayment amounts might also be available. One advantage of using these arrangements is that under United States tax law, mortgage interest payments may be deductible on the borrower&#x27;s income taxes, whereas mortgage insurance premiums were not until 2007. In some situations, the all-in cost of borrowing may be cheaper using a piggy-back than by going with a single loan that includes borrower-paid or lender-paid MI.

===LMI/PMI tax deduction===
Mortgage insurance became tax-deductible in 2007 in the US. For some homeowners, the new law made it cheaper to get mortgage insurance than to get a &#x27;piggyback&#x27; loan. The MI tax deductibility provision passed in 2006 provides for an itemized deduction for the cost of private mortgage insurance for homeowners earning up to $109,000 annually.

The original law was extended in 2007 to provide for a three-year deduction, effective for mortgage contracts issued after December 31, 2006, and before January 1, 2010. It does not apply to mortgage insurance contracts that were in existence prior to passage of the legislation.

As of 2023, PMI was tax deductible for all years from 2007 until 2021. The IRS does not allow the PMI to be deducted for 2022.

==Mortgage insurance in Australia==
The two main mortgage insurers in Australia are Helia and QBE LMI. Mortgage insurance is payable if the loan-to-value ratio (LTV, or LVR in Australia) is above 80%, or above 60% for low document loans. Some non-bank lenders obtain mortgage insurance for every loan irrespective of the LVR, however it is paid for by the lender if the loan is below 80% LVR.

LMI premiums are calculated using a sliding scale based on the loan amount and LVR. State government stamp duty may be payable on the premium. The premium is often capitalised on top of the loan amount. Unlike in other countries, the LMI premium is a one-off fee in Australia.

==Mortgage insurance in Canada==
The Bank Act which governs banks as well as provincial laws governing credit unions and caisse populaires prohibit most regulated lending institutions from providing mortgages without insurance if the LTV is greater than 80%. The typical premium rates provided by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation are between 1% (for 80% LTV) and 2.75% (for 95% LTV) of the loan principal.

<text>Mikele Benjamin Leigertwood (born 12 November 1982) is a former professional footballer who played as a defensive midfielder. Born in England, he represented the Antigua and Barbuda national team at international level.

==Club career==
===Wimbledon===
Born in Enfield, Leigertwood began his career with Wimbledon. After progressing through the ranks at Wimbledon, he was one of a number of youngsters called up to the first team by the manager Terry Burton in September 2001. After his loan spell at Leyton Orient ended, he was given his first game for Wimbledon at the end of the 2001–02 season in a 1–0 defeat against Barnsley.

In November 2001, Leigertwood was loaned out to Leyton Orient and made his professional debut in a 3–0 win over Oxford United. His performances quickly led to the extension of his loan spell at Leyton Orient on two occasions. Leigertwood went on to make eight appearances for Leyton Orient before returning to his parent club.

At the start of the 2002–03 season, Leigertwood began to establish himself in the starting eleven for the side. However, it wasn&#x27;t until 1 October 2002 that he scored his first goal for Wimbledon against Portsmouth in the League Cup. Leigertwood continued to hold down a first team spot until he suffered injuries in early March. While on the sidelines, he signed a contract extension that tied him to the club until 2006. He returned from injury on 7 April 2003, starting a 1–0 win over Sheffield United. By the end of the 2002–03 season, Leigertwood had made thirty–three appearances, scoring once in all competitions.

At the start of the 2003–04 season, Wimbledon entered administration. Up until his departure from the club, Leigertwood started every match in the first half of the season. On 26 August 2003, he scored his first goal of the season in a 3–2 loss against Norwich City. and his second of the season on 25 October 200, in a 3–1 loss against Watford. When leaving Wimbledon, he had played 65 games, scoring three times.

===Crystal Palace===
He transferred to Crystal Palace for £155,000 in January 2004, becoming the first permanent signing of Iain Dowie. Upon joining Crystal Palace, Leigertwood revealed he had turned down move to other clubs in order to join The Eagles.

Leigertwood made his Crystal Palace debut as a late substitute in a 6–3 win over Stoke City on 14 February 2004. After making his debut, he played in 10 league games during the remainder of the 2003–04 season, helping Crystal Palace secure promotion to the FA Premier League after defeating West Ham United in the play-off final to win promotion to the Premiership.

In the 2004–05 season, Leigertwood didn&#x27;t make his first start of the season until 26 October 2004 in a 2–1 win over South London rivals, Charlton Athletic in the third round of the League Cup. Following his first appearance of the season, Leigertwood began to enjoy a run of first team football. On 22 January 2005, he scored his first goal for the club against Tottenham Hotspur. Leigertwood spent the rest of the 2004–05 season playing in defence and midfield, but he was unsuccessful in helping to prevent Crystal Palace from being relegated from the Premier League on the final day of the season. By the end of the 2004–05 season, Leigertwood had made 23 appearances, scoring once.

In the 2005–06 season, Leigertwood continued to feature in the first team, playing four matches for the side. However, he was kept out by an ankle injury for two months. and did not return to first team action 22 November 2005, coming on as a late substitute in a 1–0 win over Coventry City. After making his return to the first team, Leigertwood held his place until he suffered a thigh injury in mid–January. After recovering from a thigh injury, Leigertwood retained his place for the rest of the season. Around this time, the club began negotiations with Leigertwood over a new contract. However, it was reported in the British newspaper that he had refused to sign. At the end of the 2005–06 season, which saw Palace miss out on a return to the Premier League after losing 1–0 to Watford in the play-offs, Leigertwood went on to make thirty appearances in all competitions. Shortly after the play-offs, he was offered a new contract by the club.

===Sheffield United===
After Palace&#x27;s relegation Crystal Palace, he joined Sheffield United on a three-year deal after the Blades paid a fee of £600,000. Although Leigertwood was out of contract, compensation was due as he was under 24 years of age at the time.

Leigertwood made his Sheffield United debut as a 75th-minute substitute in a 1–1 draw against Liverpool in the opening game of the season, quickly establishing himself a first team regular, until he suffered an ankle injury in early December. It wasn&#x27;t until on 30 December 2006 when he made his return from injury, coming on as a substitute in the 63rd minute in a 1–0 win over Arsenal. His return was short–lived, however, when Leigertwood suffered an ankle injury that kept him out for months and was subsequently plagued with injuries later in the 2006–07 season. Sheffield United were relegated from the Premier League after losing 2–1 to Wigan Athletic in the last game of the season, making it the second time that Leigertwood had suffered relegation from the Premier League. By the end of the 2006–07 season, he had made nineteen appearances for the side.

At the start of the 2007–08 season, Leigertwood made four appearances, despite struggling to hold down a first team place since the club&#x27;s relegation from the Premier League.

===Queens Park Rangers===
Leigertwood joined Queens Park Rangers for a fee of £900,000 on 31 August 2007.

Leigertwood made his Queens Park Rangers debut the next day on 1 September 2007, starting a 3–0 loss against Southampton. He scored his first Queens Park Rangers goal in a 1–1 draw against Leicester City. A week later, on 22 September, Leigertwood was sent– ff in the 81st minute of a 1–1 draw against Watford for a second bookable offence. Leigertwood scored his second goal for the club in a 2–0 win over Hull City on 3 November 2007. A month later, on 27 December 2007, he was sent off for the second time that season in the final minutes f a 2–1 loss against Plymouth Argyle, as a result of which Leigertwood served a three match suspension. He scored three more goals in the 2007–08 season, including a brace in a 3–0 win over Stoke City on 2 March 2008. Leigertwood became a first team regular for the side, finishing his first season at the club with forty appearances and scoring five times in all competitions.

In the 2008–09 season, Leigertwood continued as a first team regular, playing either as right–back or in midfield. Leigertwood started the season well when he set up three goals in as many matches between 23 August 2008 and 14 September 2008. Leigertwood received a red card and four match ban in a match against Birmingham City on 28 October 2008 for a challenge on Lee Carsley. His performance at Queens Park Rangers attracted interest in the January transfer window, when he was reportedly &quot;wanted by three clubs ready to shell out a £1m-plus&quot; for him. It wasn&#x27;t until on 17 January 2009 when Leigterwood scored his first goal of the season, in a 2–0 win over Derby County. Two months later on 17 March 2009, he scored his second goal of the season, in a 1–0 win over Swansea City. By the end of the 2008–09 season, Leigertwood had made forty–six appearances, scoring twice in all competitions.

In the 2009–10 season, Leigterwood started the season well when he scored his first goal of the season in a 1–1 draw against Nottingham Forest on 23 August 2009. His second goal came on 26 September 2009 in a 5–2 win over Barnsley. His 100th appearance for the club came on 30 October 2009 in a 2–1 loss against Leicester City. He continued to regain his first team place for the side. Leigterwood also captained the side in the number of matches in the absence of Martin Rowlands. Leigterwood scored two goals in two matches on 19 December 2009 and 26 December 2009. Shortly after, he signed a three–year contract, keeping him at the club until 2012. In a 1–0 win over Peterborough United on 6 February 2010, he was sent off for a professional foul on Tommy Rowe. Two months later on 24 April 2010, Leigertwood scored his fifth goal of the season in a 1–0 win over Barnsley. Despite missing several matches due to injury and suspension, he went on to make forty–five appearances, scoring five times in all competitions.

In the 2010–11 season, Leigertwood found his playing time at Queens Park Rangers reduced and mostly came on as a substitute. As a result, he fell out of favour with Neil Warnock. By the time of his departure, he had made nine appearances for the side in the 2010–11 season. During his time at Queens Park Rangers, he made 141 appearances and scored 12 goals.

===Reading===
Leigertwood went on loan to Reading for two months on 23 November 2010. On 27 November 2010, he made his Reading debut, coming off in the 77th minute in a 0–0 draw against Leeds United. Leigertwood quickly became a first team regular for the side. After a series of consistently good performances, this was extended to the end of the 2010–11 season. He scored his first goal for the club against Stevenage in the FA Cup on 29 January 2011. A week later Leigertwood added another goal to his tally with a 21st minute deflected strike against Cardiff City in a 2–2 draw. During the match, Leigertwood punched Michael Chopra &quot;after a confrontation involving both sets of players, but immediately admitted his part in the melee&quot; and served a three match suspension. After serving his suspension, his performance earned him the Reading Post AHG Group-sponsored Player of the Month award for February. He helped the side reach fifth place and qualify for the Championship play–offs. Leigertwood played all three matches in the Championship play–offs, as Reading lost 4–2 against Swansea City in the Championship play-off final. Despite missing out several matches due to injury and suspension, he went on to make twenty–nine appearances, scoring twice in all competitions.

In May 2011, it was announced that Reading had signed Leigertwood on a three-year contract. Leigertwood&#x27;s first game after signing for the club on a permanent basis was the opening game of the season, a 2–2 draw against Millwall. After joining the club on a permanent basis, he quickly established him in the starting eleven. However, his performances at the start of the season came under criticism from Reading supporters. Despite this, Leigertwood&#x27;s first goal of the 2011–12 season came at home to Southampton in a 1–1 draw on 22 October 2011. Leigertwood started in every match until he suffered a thigh injury that saw him miss three matches. After returning to the first team from injury, he quickly regained his first team place for the side. His second goal of the campaign came at home to Leicester City in a 3–1 win, and this was followed up with strikes against Blackpool and West Ham United as Reading surged towards promotion with an incredible run of games of which Leigertwood was an important figure in. After returning from a knee injury, he returned to the starting line-up, where he key role Leigertwood had played was rewarded when he scored the winning goal in a 1–0 victory at home to Nottingham Forest, which secured Reading&#x27;s promotion back to the top flight after a four-year absence. At the end of the 2011–12 season, he went on to make forty–two appearances, scoring five times in all competitions.

In the 2012–13 season, Leigertwood regained his first team place, with the club playing in the Premier League. In early–October, however, he suffered ankle injury that saw him sidelined for one match. After returning from injury, he scored his first Premier League goal for Reading in a 3–3 draw with Fulham with a superb strike from 20 yards on 27 October 2012. Three days later, on 30 October 2012, he scored his second goal for the club, in the League Cup campaign, as Reading lost 7–5 against Arsenal in a match in which Arsenal were 4–0 down before coming back to win 7–5 after extra-time. After being sidelined in early–2013 due to injury, Leigterwood then captained the side for the first time and scored his third goal of the season, in a 4–0 win over Sheffield United in the third round of the FA Cup. He continued to be in the starting line-up until he was dropped from the first team for the rest of the 2012–13 season, as Leigterwood went on to make thirty–four appearances and scoring three times in all competitions. Metro named Leigertwood among the Premier League&#x27;s worst XI of the season.

Prior to the 2013–14 season, Leigertwood suffered an ankle injury during pre–season, having been under the knife since May. In September 2013, he returned to training after recovering from the ankle injury. Upon returning to training from injury, Leigterwood&#x27;s return was praised by Manager Nigel Adkins. However, his return was short–lived and his injury plagued was plagued throughout 2013 and early 2014. By March, Leigterwood returned to training. After a year out injured, Leigertwood made his Reading return on 8 April 2014. In the follow–up match, however, he came on as a substitute for Danny Williams in the 61st minute but was sent off for a second bookable offence in a 1–1 draw against Leicester City. After missing out two matches, Leigertwood went on to play the final two matches for the side. By the end of the 2013–14 season, Leigertwood had made four appearances for the side.

On 6 May 2014, Leigertwood was released from Reading, along with five other players and in July joined Nottingham Forest on trial. Whilst on trial, Leigertwood sustained a hip injury which forced him to retire from the game, although this was not officially confirmed until the following year.

==International career==
Leigertwood is eligible to represent Antigua and Barbuda. Willie Donachie, Antigua and Barbuda&#x27;s manager, tried to bring Leigertwood into the squad for a World Cup qualifier in June 2008, but the player had a wedding to attend. He was also eligible to represent Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.

While serving a four match ban after receiving a red card against Birmingham City on 28 October 2008, he accepted a call up for the 2008 Caribbean Championship to represent Antigua and Barbuda. He made his international debut on 5 November 2008 in a 3–2 loss against Trinidad and Tobago and scored his first goal in their next match against Guyana. In November 2010, he returned to the national team and participated in the second stage of the 2010 Caribbean Championship, playing in all three matches.

==Post–playing career==
After retiring from professional football, Leigertwood took up a coaching role at Maccabi London Lions as their Sunday Team Coach.

On 19 July 2016 Leigertwood returned to Reading as Academy Loan Manager.

==Personal life==
In March 2010, Leigertwood was involved in Kick It Out&#x27;s latest campaign, which aimed to raise awareness of homophobia in football. During his time at Reading, he became the Royals&#x27; &#x27;Reading Stars&#x27; ambassador.

<doc id="1301906" wikidata="Q1412670" url="?curid=1301906" title="Software quality">
<text>In the context of software engineering, software quality refers to two related but distinct notions:

* Software&#x27;s functional quality reflects how well it complies with or conforms to a given design, based on functional requirements or specifications. That attribute can also be described as the fitness for the purpose of a piece of software or how it compares to competitors in the marketplace as a worthwhile product. It is the degree to which the correct software was produced.
* Software structural quality refers to how it meets non-functional requirements that support the delivery of the functional requirements, such as robustness or maintainability. It has a lot more to do with the degree to which the software works as needed.

Many aspects of structural quality can be evaluated only statically through the analysis of the software&#x27;s inner structure, its source code (see Software metrics), at the unit level, and at the system level (sometimes referred to as end-to-end testing), which is in effect how its architecture adheres to sound principles of software architecture outlined in a paper on the topic by Object Management Group (OMG).

Some structural qualities, such as usability, can be assessed only dynamically (users or others acting on their behalf interact with the software or, at least, some prototype or partial implementation; even the interaction with a mock version made in cardboard represents a dynamic test because such version can be considered a prototype). Other aspects, such as reliability, might involve not only the software but also the underlying hardware, therefore, it can be assessed both statically and dynamically (stress test).

Using automated tests and fitness functions can help to maintain some of the quality related attributes. 

Functional quality is typically assessed dynamically but it is also possible to use static tests (such as software reviews).

Historically, the structure, classification, and terminology of attributes and metrics applicable to software quality management have been derived or extracted from the ISO 9126 and the subsequent ISO/IEC 25000 standard. Based on these models (see Models), the Consortium for IT Software Quality (CISQ) has defined five major desirable structural characteristics needed for a piece of software to provide business value: Reliability, Efficiency, Security, Maintainability, and (adequate) Size.

Software quality measurement quantifies to what extent a software program or system rates along each of these five dimensions. An aggregated measure of software quality can be computed through a qualitative or a quantitative scoring scheme or a mix of both and then a weighting system reflecting the priorities. This view of software quality being positioned on a linear continuum is supplemented by the analysis of &quot;critical programming errors&quot; that under specific circumstances can lead to catastrophic outages or performance degradations that make a given system unsuitable for use regardless of rating based on aggregated measurements. Such programming errors found at the system level represent up to 90 percent of production issues, whilst at the unit-level, even if far more numerous, programming errors account for less than 10 percent of production issues (see also Ninety–ninety rule). As a consequence, code quality without the context of the whole system, as W. Edwards Deming described it, has limited value.

To view, explore, analyze, and communicate software quality measurements, concepts and techniques of information visualization provide visual, interactive means useful, in particular, if several software quality measures have to be related to each other or to components of a software or system. For example, software maps represent a specialized approach that &quot;can express and combine information about software development, software quality, and system dynamics&quot;.

Software quality also plays a role in the release phase of a software project. Specifically, the quality and establishment of the release processes (also patch processes), configuration management are important parts of an overall software engineering process.

== Motivation ==
Software quality is motivated by at least two main perspectives:

* Risk management: Software failure has caused more than inconvenience. Software errors can cause human fatalities (see for example: List of software bugs). The causes have ranged from poorly designed user interfaces to direct programming errors, see for example Boeing 737 case or Unintended acceleration cases or Therac-25 cases. This resulted in requirements for the development of some types of software, particularly and historically for software embedded in medical and other devices that regulate critical infrastructures: &quot;[Engineers who write embedded software] see Java programs stalling for one third of a second to perform garbage collection and update the user interface, and they envision airplanes falling out of the sky.&quot;. In the United States, within the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the FAA Aircraft Certification Service provides software programs, policy, guidance and training, focus on software and Complex Electronic Hardware that has an effect on the airborne product (a &quot;product&quot; is an aircraft, an engine, or a propeller). Certification standards such as DO-178C, ISO 26262, IEC 62304, etc. provide guidance.
* Cost management: As in any other fields of engineering, a software product or service governed by good software quality costs less to maintain, is easier to understand and can change more cost-effective in response to pressing business needs. Industry data demonstrate that poor application structural quality in core business applications (such as enterprise resource planning (ERP), customer relationship management (CRM) or large transaction processing systems in financial services) results in cost, schedule overruns and creates waste in the form of rework (see Muda (Japanese term)). Moreover, poor structural quality is strongly correlated with high-impact business disruptions due to corrupted data, application outages, security breaches, and performance problems. 
**CISQ reports on the cost of poor quality estimates an impact of:
***$2.08 trillion in 2020
***$2.84 trillion in 2018
**IBM&#x27;s Cost of a Data Breach Report 2020 estimates that the average global costs of a data breach:
***$3.86 million

== Definitions ==

=== ISO ===
Software quality is the &quot;capability of a software product to conform to requirements.&quot; while for others it can be synonymous with customer- or value-creation or even defect level. Software quality measurements can be split into three parts: process quality, product quality which includes internal and external properties and lastly, quality in use, which is the effect of the software.

=== ASQ ===
ASQ uses the following definition: &quot;Software quality&quot; describes the desirable attributes of software products. There are two main approaches exist: defect management and quality attributes.

=== NIST ===
Software Assurance (SA) covers both the property and the process to achieve it:

* [Justifiable] confidence that software is free from vulnerabilities, either intentionally designed into the software or accidentally inserted at any time during its life cycle and that the software functions in the intended manner
* The planned and systematic set of activities that ensure that software life cycle processes and products conform to requirements, standards, and procedures

=== PMI ===
The Project Management Institute&#x27;s PMBOK Guide &quot;Software Extension&quot; defines not &quot;Software quality&quot; itself, but Software Quality Assurance (SQA) as &quot;a continuous process that audits other software processes to ensure that those processes are being followed (includes for example a software quality management plan).&quot; whereas Software Quality Control (SCQ) means &quot;&quot;taking care of applying methods, tools, techniques to ensure satisfaction of the work products toward quality requirements for a software under development or modification.&quot;&quot;

=== Other general and historic ===

The first definition of quality history remembers is from Shewhart in the beginning of 20th century: &quot;There are two common aspects of quality: one of them has to do with the consideration of the quality of a thing as an objective reality independent of the existence of man. The other has to do with what we think, feel or sense as a result of the objective reality. In other words, there is a subjective side of quality.&quot;

Kitchenham and Pfleeger, further reporting the teachings of David Garvin, identify five different perspectives on quality:
* The transcendental perspective deals with the metaphysical aspect of quality. In this view of quality, it is &quot;something toward which we strive as an ideal, but may never implement completely&quot;. It can hardly be defined, but is similar to what a federal judge once commented about obscenity: &quot;I know it when I see it&quot;.
* The user perspective is concerned with the appropriateness of the product for a given context of use. Whereas the transcendental view is ethereal, the user view is more concrete, grounded in the product characteristics that meet user&#x27;s needs.
* The manufacturing perspective represents quality as conformance to requirements. This aspect of quality is stressed by standards such as ISO 9001, which defines quality as &quot;the degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfills requirements&quot; (ISO/IEC 9001).
* The product perspective implies that quality can be appreciated by measuring the inherent characteristics of the product.
* The final perspective of quality is value-based. This perspective recognizes that the different perspectives of quality may have different importance, or value, to various stakeholders.



Tom DeMarco has proposed that &quot;a product&#x27;s quality is a function of how much it changes the world for the better.&quot; This can be interpreted as meaning that functional quality and user satisfaction are more important than structural quality in determining software quality.

Another definition, coined by Gerald Weinberg in Quality Software Management: Systems Thinking, is &quot;Quality is value to some person.&quot;

=== Other meanings and controversies ===

One of the challenges in defining quality is that &quot;everyone feels they understand it&quot; and other definitions of software quality could be based on extending the various descriptions of the concept of quality used in business.

Software quality also often gets mixed-up with Quality Assurance or Problem Resolution Management or Quality Control or DevOps. It does over-lap with before mentioned areas (see also PMI definitions), but is distinctive as it does not solely focus on testing but also on processes, management, improvements, assessments, etc.

== Measurement ==

Although the concepts presented in this section are applicable to both structural and functional software quality, measurement of the latter is essentially performed through software testing. Testing is not enough: According to one study, &quot;individual programmers are less than 50% efficient at finding bugs in their own software. And most forms of testing are only 35% efficient. This makes it difficult to determine [software] quality.&quot;

=== Introduction ===

Software quality measurement is about quantifying to what extent a system or software possesses desirable characteristics. This can be performed through qualitative or quantitative means or a mix of both. In both cases, for each desirable characteristic, there are a set of measurable attributes the existence of which in a piece of software or system tend to be correlated and associated with this characteristic. For example, an attribute associated with portability is the number of target-dependent statements in a program. More precisely, using the Quality Function Deployment approach, these measurable attributes are the &quot;hows&quot; that need to be enforced to enable the &quot;whats&quot; in the Software Quality definition above.

The structure, classification and terminology of attributes and metrics applicable to software quality management have been derived or extracted from the ISO 9126-3 and the subsequent ISO/IEC 25000:2005 quality model. The main focus is on internal structural quality. Subcategories have been created to handle specific areas like business application architecture and technical characteristics such as data access and manipulation or the notion of transactions.

The dependence tree between software quality characteristics and their measurable attributes is represented in the diagram on the right, where each of the 5 characteristics that matter for the user (right) or owner of the business system depends on measurable attributes (left):
* Application Architecture Practices
* Coding Practices
* Application Complexity
* Documentation
* Portability
* Technical and Functional Volume

Correlations between programming errors and production defects unveil that basic code errors account for 92 percent of the total errors in the source code. These numerous code-level issues eventually count for only 10 percent of the defects in production. Bad software engineering practices at the architecture levels account for only 8 percent of total defects, but consume over half the effort spent on fixing problems, and lead to 90 percent of the serious reliability, security, and efficiency issues in production.

===Code-based analysis===
Many of the existing software measures count structural elements of the application that result from parsing the source code for such individual instructions tokens control structures (Complexity), and objects.

Software quality measurement is about quantifying to what extent a system or software rates along these dimensions. The analysis can be performed using a qualitative or quantitative approach or a mix of both to provide an aggregate view [using for example weighted average(s) that reflect relative importance between the factors being measured].

This view of software quality on a linear continuum has to be supplemented by the identification of discrete Critical Programming Errors. These vulnerabilities may not fail a test case, but they are the result of bad practices that under specific circumstances can lead to catastrophic outages, performance degradations, security breaches, corrupted data, and myriad other problems that make a given system de facto unsuitable for use regardless of its rating based on aggregated measurements. A well-known example of vulnerability is the Common Weakness Enumeration, a repository of vulnerabilities in the source code that make applications exposed to security breaches.

The measurement of critical application characteristics involves measuring structural attributes of the application&#x27;s architecture, coding, and in-line documentation, as displayed in the picture above. Thus, each characteristic is affected by attributes at numerous levels of abstraction in the application and all of which must be included in calculating the characteristic&#x27;s measure if it is to be a valuable predictor of quality outcomes that affect the business. The layered approach to calculating characteristic measures displayed in the figure above was first proposed by Boehm and his colleagues at TRW (Boehm, 1978) and is the approach taken in the ISO 9126 and 25000 series standards. These attributes can be measured from the parsed results of a static analysis of the application source code. Even dynamic characteristics of applications such as reliability and performance efficiency have their causal roots in the static structure of the application.

Structural quality analysis and measurement is performed through the analysis of the source code, the architecture, software framework, database schema in relationship to principles and standards that together define the conceptual and logical architecture of a system. This is distinct from the basic, local, component-level code analysis typically performed by development tools which are mostly concerned with implementation considerations and are crucial during debugging and testing activities.

=== Reliability ===
The root causes of poor reliability are found in a combination of non-compliance with good architectural and coding practices. This non-compliance can be detected by measuring the static quality attributes of an application. Assessing the static attributes underlying an application&#x27;s reliability provides an estimate of the level of business risk and the likelihood of potential application failures and defects the application will experience when placed in operation.

Assessing reliability requires checks of at least the following software engineering best practices and technical attributes:
* Application Architecture Practices
* Coding Practices
* Complexity of algorithms
* Complexity of programming practices
* Compliance with Object-Oriented and Structured Programming best practices (when applicable)
* Component or pattern re-use ratio
* Dirty programming
* Error &amp; Exception handling (for all layers - GUI, Logic &amp; Data)
* Multi-layer design compliance
* Resource bounds management
* Software avoids patterns that will lead to unexpected behaviors
* Software manages data integrity and consistency
* Transaction complexity level
Depending on the application architecture and the third-party components used (such as external libraries or frameworks), custom checks should be defined along the lines drawn by the above list of best practices to ensure a better assessment of the reliability of the delivered software.

=== Efficiency ===
As with Reliability, the causes of performance inefficiency are often found in violations of good architectural and coding practice which can be detected by measuring the static quality attributes of an application. These static attributes predict potential operational performance bottlenecks and future scalability problems, especially for applications requiring high execution speed for handling complex algorithms or huge volumes of data.

Assessing performance efficiency requires checking at least the following software engineering best practices and technical attributes:
* Application Architecture Practices
* Appropriate interactions with expensive and/or remote resources
* Data access performance and data management
* Memory, network and disk space management
* Compliance with Coding Practices (Best coding practices)

=== Security ===
Software quality includes software security. Many security vulnerabilities result from poor coding and architectural practices such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting. These are well documented in lists maintained by CWE, and the SEI/Computer Emergency Center (CERT) at Carnegie Mellon University.

Assessing security requires at least checking the following software engineering best practices and technical attributes:
* Implementation, Management of a security-aware and hardening development process, e.g. Security Development Lifecycle (Microsoft) or IBM&#x27;s Secure Engineering Framework.
*Secure Application Architecture Practices
* Multi-layer design compliance
* Security best practices (Input Validation, SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting, Access control etc.)
* Secure and good Programming Practices
* Error &amp; Exception handling

=== Maintainability ===
Maintainability includes concepts of modularity, understandability, changeability, testability, reusability, and transferability from one development team to another. These do not take the form of critical issues at the code level. Rather, poor maintainability is typically the result of thousands of minor violations with best practices in documentation, complexity avoidance strategy, and basic programming practices that make the difference between clean and easy-to-read code vs. unorganized and difficult-to-read code.

Assessing maintainability requires checking the following software engineering best practices and technical attributes:

* Application Architecture Practices
* Architecture, Programs and Code documentation embedded in source code
* Code readability
* Code smells
* Complexity level of transactions
* Complexity of algorithms
* Complexity of programming practices
* Compliance with Object-Oriented and Structured Programming best practices (when applicable)
* Component or pattern re-use ratio
* Controlled level of dynamic coding
* Coupling ratio
* Dirty programming
* Documentation
* Hardware, OS, middleware, software components and database independence
* Multi-layer design compliance
* Portability
* Programming Practices (code level)
* Reduced duplicate code and functions
* Source code file organization cleanliness
Maintainability is closely related to Ward Cunningham&#x27;s concept of technical debt, which is an expression of the costs resulting of a lack of maintainability. Reasons for why maintainability is low can be classified as reckless vs. prudent and deliberate vs. inadvertent, and often have their origin in developers&#x27; inability, lack of time and goals, their carelessness and discrepancies in the creation cost of and benefits from documentation and, in particular, maintainable source code.

=== Size ===
Measuring software size requires that the whole source code be correctly gathered, including database structure scripts, data manipulation source code, component headers, configuration files etc. There are essentially two types of software sizes to be measured, the technical size (footprint) and the functional size:

* There are several software technical sizing methods that have been widely described. The most common technical sizing method is number of Lines of Code (#LOC) per technology, number of files, functions, classes, tables, etc., from which backfiring Function Points can be computed;
* The most common for measuring functional size is function point analysis. Function point analysis measures the size of the software deliverable from a user&#x27;s perspective. Function point sizing is done based on user requirements and provides an accurate representation of both size for the developer/estimator and value (functionality to be delivered) and reflects the business functionality being delivered to the customer. The method includes the identification and weighting of user recognizable inputs, outputs and data stores. The size value is then available for use in conjunction with numerous measures to quantify and to evaluate software delivery and performance (development cost per function point; delivered defects per function point; function points per staff month.).

The function point analysis sizing standard is supported by the International Function Point Users Group (IFPUG). It can be applied early in the software development life-cycle and it is not dependent on lines of code like the somewhat inaccurate Backfiring method. The method is technology agnostic and can be used for comparative analysis across organizations and across industries.

Since the inception of Function Point Analysis, several variations have evolved and the family of functional sizing techniques has broadened to include such sizing measures as COSMIC, NESMA, Use Case Points, FP Lite, Early and Quick FPs, and most recently Story Points. Function Point has a history of statistical accuracy, and has been used as a common unit of work measurement in numerous application development management (ADM) or outsourcing engagements, serving as the &quot;currency&quot; by which services are delivered and performance is measured.

One common limitation to the Function Point methodology is that it is a manual process and therefore it can be labor-intensive and costly in large scale initiatives such as application development or outsourcing engagements. This negative aspect of applying the methodology may be what motivated industry IT leaders to form the Consortium for IT Software Quality focused on introducing a computable metrics standard for automating the measuring of software size while the IFPUG keep promoting a manual approach as most of its activity rely on FP counters certifications.

CISQ defines Sizing as to estimate the size of software to support cost estimating, progress tracking or other related software project management activities. Two standards are used: &quot;Automated Function Points&quot; to measure the functional size of software and &quot;Automated Enhancement Points&quot; to measure the size of both functional and non-functional code in one measure.

=== Identifying critical programming errors ===
Critical Programming Errors are specific architectural and/or coding bad practices that result in the highest, immediate or long term, business disruption risk.

These are quite often technology-related and depend heavily on the context, business objectives and risks. Some may consider respect for naming conventions while others – those preparing the ground for a knowledge transfer for example – will consider it as absolutely critical.

Critical Programming Errors can also be classified per CISQ Characteristics. Basic example below: 
* Reliability
** Avoid software patterns that will lead to unexpected behavior (Uninitialized variable, null pointers, etc.)
** Methods, procedures and functions doing Insert, Update, Delete, Create Table or Select must include error management
** Multi-thread functions should be made thread safe, for instance servlets or struts action classes must not have instance/non-final static fields
* Efficiency
** Ensure centralization of client requests (incoming and data) to reduce network traffic
** Avoid SQL queries that don&#x27;t use an index against large tables in a loop
* Security
** Avoid fields in servlet classes that are not final static
** Avoid data access without including error management
** Check control return codes and implement error handling mechanisms
** Ensure input validation to avoid cross-site scripting flaws or SQL injections flaws
* Maintainability
** Deep inheritance trees and nesting should be avoided to improve comprehensibility
** Modules should be loosely coupled (fanout, intermediaries) to avoid propagation of modifications
** Enforce homogeneous naming conventions

=== Operationalized quality models ===
Newer proposals for quality models such as Squale and Quamoco propagate a direct integration of the definition of quality attributes and measurement. By breaking down quality attributes or even defining additional layers, the complex, abstract quality attributes (such as reliability or maintainability) become more manageable and measurable. Those quality models have been applied in industrial contexts but have not received widespread adoption.
