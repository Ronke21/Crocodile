<text>Skank was a Brazilian pop rock band from Belo Horizonte. Having begun in 1991, they sold approximately 5,200,000 copies of their albums as of 2004. Initially intending to mix dancehall with traditional Brazilian styles, later the band changed its sonority to music closer to Britpop and local movement Clube da Esquina. Their last concert was held on March 26, 2023, at Mineirão, in Belo Horizonte.

==Biography==
In 1983, Samuel Rosa (guitars, vocals) and Henrique Portugal (keyboards) started to play in a rock band called &quot;Pozo Alto&quot;, along with Dinho Mourão (drums) and his brother Alexandre (bass). In 1991, Pouso Alto arranged for a performance in São Paulo, but due to the Mourão brothers not being in Belo Horizonte, bassist Lelo Zaneti and drummer Haroldo Ferretti were called for the gig. The band premiered on June 5, 1991, and due to the performance competing with the Campeonato Paulista final match, the audience was 37 people. After the show, the group changed its name to Skank, inspired by Bob Marley&#x27;s song &quot;Easy skanking&quot;, and began to perform regularly at &quot;Mister Beef&quot; churrascaria in Belo Horizonte.

After playing for some time in steakhouses, bars and clubhouses, the band spent US$10,000 in their first album, &quot;Skank&quot;, released as an independent CD in late 1992 with 3,000 copies, fully paid by the band members themselves. In 45 days, 1,200 were sold, and Sony Music signed the band as the first Brazilian act in its Chaos label. &quot;Skank&quot; was re-released in April 1993. The singles &quot;O Homem Que Sabia Demais&quot;, &quot;Tanto&quot; (version of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;I Want You&quot;) and &quot;In(Dig)Nação&quot; took the group on a 120 concerts tour around Brazil, and the album sold 250 thousand copies.

&quot;Calango&quot; (1994) was the first record produced by Dudu Marote. &quot;É Proibido Fumar&quot;, &quot;Te Ver&quot;, &quot;Pacato Cidadão&quot;, &quot;Esmola&quot; and &quot;Jackie Tequila&quot; were hits, and &quot;Calango&quot; sold around 1,200,000 copies.

&quot;O Samba Poconé&quot; was released in 1996. The album had three big hits, &quot;Tão Seu&quot;, &quot;É Uma Partida de Futebol&quot;, included by FIFA in the official soundtrack for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, and &quot;Garota Nacional&quot;, which topped the Spanish charts for three months (under the Spanish title &quot;Chica Nacional&quot;), was the only Portuguese language song in the Sony Music compilation &quot;Soundtrack for a Century&quot;, released in 1997 to celebrate the company&#x27;s centennial, and took the group on tour in Argentina, Chile, United States, France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and Portugal. Although &quot;Garota Nacional&quot; literally translates to &quot;national girl&quot;, the song is not about the women of Brazil: it celebrates the &quot;girls of Bar Nacional&quot;, a bar and nightclub in Belo Horizonte famous in the early 1990s for the beauty of its female patrons. Manu Chao featured in &quot;Sem Terra&quot;, &quot;Los Pretos&quot; e &quot;Zé Trindade&quot;. &quot;O Samba Poconé&quot; sold 1,800,000 cópias - 800,000 of those in two months.

&quot;Siderado&quot;, produced by John Shaw (UB40) and Paul Ralphes, begins the band&#x27;s movement towards a more rock and roll sound. The Clube da Esquina-influenced &quot;Resposta&quot; (re-recorded in 1999 by Milton Nascimento and Lô Borges, the latter the song&#x27;s co-author with Samuel Rosa and Nando Reis), &quot;Mandrake e Os Cubanos&quot; and &quot;Saideira&quot; were hits. Released in 1998, &quot;Siderado&quot; sold 750 thousand copies. Daúde and Uakti participated as guest artists.

In 1999 Skank recorded a Spanish language version for &quot;Wrapped Around Your Finger&quot; in a tribute album for The Police entitled &quot;Outlandos d&#x27;America&quot;.

With &quot;Maquinarama&quot;, the band begins in earnest its move away from the ska and reggae sound towards a more rock oriented one influence by The Beatles, Clube da Esquina, Britpop and contemporary alternative rock. &quot;Maquinarama&quot;, produced by Chico Neves and Tom Capone and released in July 2000, sold 275 thousand copies. Some of the hit singles were &quot;Três Lados&quot;, &quot;Balada do Amor Inabalável&quot; and &quot;Canção Noturna&quot;. The original cover shows a Cadillac with graffiti by Californian artist Kenny Scharf. The international version has a different cover.

In 2001, Skank recorded the first live album in Ouro Preto as part of the MTV Brasil&#x27;s series &quot;MTV Ao Vivo&quot;. &quot;MTV ao Vivo: Skank&quot; sold 600 thousand copies. Besides a list of hits chosen by fans through Skank&#x27;s website, the album had the new song &quot;Acima do Sol&quot;, a national hit. In 2002 Samuel Rosa played acoustic guitar in &quot;É Proibido Fumar&quot;, from the &quot;Acústico MTV&quot; (MTV Unplugged) by Roberto Carlos.

&quot;Cosmotron&quot;, produced by Skank and Tom Capone, was released in July 2003 and sold 250 thousand copies - a disappointment next to their vigorous previous sales figures. Nevertheless, the album had many radio and ringtone hits. &quot;Supernova&quot;, &quot;Dois Rios&quot;, &quot;Vou Deixar&quot; and &quot;Amores Imperfeitos&quot; were the main tracks. &quot;Cosmotron&quot; won the Latin Grammy - best Brazilian rock album award in 2004.

Released in October 2004, &quot;Radiola&quot; was the first compilation album by Skank. It included four new songs, including the Gilberto Gil cover &quot;Vamos Fugir&quot;. The cover reproduces a painting by the hyped Los Angeles artists the Clayton Brothers. &quot;Radiola&quot; sold 200 thousand copies.

In March 2006 Skank began recording the new album &quot;Carrossel&quot; in their studio in Belo Horizonte, with producers Chico Neves, who also worked in &quot;Maquinarama&quot;, and Carlos Eduardo Miranda, producer of O Rappa&#x27;s Unplugged album. Released in August, the album had the semi-hits &quot;Uma Canção É Pra Isso&quot; and &quot;Mil Acasos&quot;. Arnaldo Antunes (&quot;Trancoso&quot;), César Mauricio (&quot;Lugar&quot;) and Humberto Effe (&quot;Cara Nua&quot; and &quot;Notícia&quot;) were the songwriting partners.

In 2008, the band reunited with Dudu Marote, who produced &quot;Calango&quot; and &quot;O Samba Poconé&quot;, to record the album &quot;Estandarte&quot; in their studio in Belo Horizonte. Released in September, the album had low sales, but produced the hits &quot;Ainda Gosto Dela&quot; (featuring Negra Li), &quot;Sutilmente&quot; (a massive number 1 hit in Brazil) and &quot;Noites de um Verão Qualquer.&quot;

On June 19, 2010, Skank performed a free concert on the Mineirão stadium in Belo Horizonte. It was the last event before the venue was closed to reform in order to accommodate the 2014 FIFA World Cup. The show was recorded for the live album and DVD &quot;Multishow ao Vivo: Skank no Mineirão&quot;, which featured two new songs, &quot;De Repente&quot; and &quot;Fotos na Estante&quot;.

==International career==
Skank had some success with &quot;Garota Nacional&quot;, that lead the Spanish charts, and &quot;É Uma Partida de Futebol&quot; was shown before some games of the 1998 World Cup due to being in the championship&#x27;s soundtrack. By the time of &quot;O Samba Poconé&quot;, the group toured through Hispanic America and Europe, and appeared in big festivals such as Super Bock/Super Rock 1997 in Portugal, Páleo Festival 97 and St. Gallen 98 in Switzerland, Montreux Jazz Festival 2001, and SummerStage 2002 in New York City. The group also played in two editions of Rock in Rio, at the 2008 Rock in Rio Lisboa and the fourth Brazilian edition of the festival in 2011. Skank had been previously called for Rock in Rio II] in 2001, but went out along with other Brazilian bands in protest against O Rappa&#x27;s exclusion.
However, the band never invested much in its international career. Some songs received versions in Spanish, such as &quot;Chica Nacional&quot; (&quot;Garota Nacional&quot;), and &quot;Respuesta&quot; (&quot;Resposta&quot;), but foreign shows are usually in places with many Brazilians, such as Miami and New York City.

<doc id="1271094" wikidata="Q3110048" url="?curid=1271094" title="Stingers (TV series)">
<text>Stingers is an Australian police procedural crime drama television series. It premiered on 29 September 1998, and ran for eight seasons on the Nine Network before it was cancelled in late 2004 due to declining ratings, with its final episode airing on 14 December 2004. Inspired by true events, &quot;Stingers&quot; chronicled the cases of a deep undercover unit of the Victoria Police. The series also followed their personal lives, which sometimes became intertwined with their jobs. The original cast members include Peter Phelps, Kate Kendall, Anita Hegh, Ian Stenlake, Joe Petruzzi, and Jessica Napier. Phelps and Kendall were the only actors to remain with the show for its entire run.

The show received average ratings during its debut season, but after some major changes, including intensive character development, the series became a success the following year. The series has also aired in 65 countries, including Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

==Overview==
Inspired by true events, &quot;Stingers&quot; chronicled the cases of a deep undercover unit of the Victoria Police. The series also followed their personal lives, which sometimes became intertwined with their jobs. The original unit was composed of Senior Constable Peter Church (whose real name was Mike Fischer) played by Peter Phelps, Constable (later Detective Senior Constable) Angie Piper (Kate Kendall), Constable Kaye Kelso (whose real name was Emily Shaw) played by Jessica Napier, Constable Oscar Stone (whose real name was Cameron Pearce) played by Ian Stenlake, Detective Sergeant (later Detective Senior Sergeant) Ellen &#x27;Mac&#x27; Mackenzie (Anita Hegh) and Detective Senior Sergeant Bernie Rocca (Joe Petruzzi), who led the unit. Kaye left the unit after getting kidnapped and almost dying at the hands of a serial killer early in season one, while Rocca was shot and ultimately retired from police force in season two, with Mac becoming the new head of the unit soon after.

Constable Danni Mayo (Roxane Wilson) joined the unit in season three, while season five saw two casualties: Stone was killed while Mac ran away with a diamond robber. Detective Inspector Luke Harris (Gary Sweet) took over as head of the unit until the end of the series, and Danni quit the force after being enraged by him. Constable Christina Dichiera (Jacinta Stapleton) joined the unit in season six. Her real name is Felicity Mathews, but this was not known to the force, as she had a criminal history under that name. Constable Leo Flynn (Daniel Frederiksen) joined in season seven.

Season eight saw the arrival of Detective Katherine Marks, who was revealed as Harris&#x27; daughter from his first marriage. The revelation also ended Harris and Angie&#x27;s already shaky relationship, which had produced a son.

==Series history and production==

On Sunday 16 July 2006 at 2 p.m., Executive producer John Wild and script producer Marcia Gardner sat down with an audience at ACMI in Federation Square in Melbourne to &quot;explore the narrative arc and character development from the first episodes to the final series.&quot; The event took place in the Screen Pit and was free to the public. Also in attendance was cast member Jeremy Kewley who posted the following rundown of the discussion for the Stingers forum:

It first began airing up towards the end of the year, on Monday nights. It was up against another new show on Channel Seven, &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, and &quot;Stingers&quot; beat &quot;McBeal&quot; regularly for its first 11 weeks before it went on its Christmas ratings break. When both shows returned after the ratings break, &quot;McBeal&quot; began to win in the ratings quite comfortably, worrying Nine executives.

At this time Channel Nine and the producers had to work out how to win ratings back, and found that the reason why so many people preferred &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; over &quot;Stingers&quot; was because &quot;Stingers&quot; had a very rough, edgy and realistic feel to it, and that this did not appeal to women of all ages, who preferred the lightness of &quot;McBeal&quot;. So &quot;Stingers&quot; was moved to Tuesday night. This helped a bit, but not enough. Channel Nine were thinking about canceling the show, but Nine owner Kerry Packer liked the show and suggested that they keep it on the air. Nine did, but moved it an hour later to 9.30pm Tuesdays, and &quot;Stingers&quot; started to find its audience (although this was still not a big one). It stayed at this timeslot until the end of 7th season which seemed to be predominately male middle class white collar workers between the ages of 30–55.

By the middle of the second season, ratings were still not spectacular enough and Channel Nine commissioned research which showed that women were not particularly interested in &quot;Stingers&quot;. As women make up 50% of the audience the producers were told to make the first major change to &quot;Stingers&quot;: make it more female-friendly. This led to the departure of Joe Petruzzi, making Anita Hegh&#x27;s character the boss of the Unit. This also led to another female character being introduced, undercover operative Danni Mayo, portrayed by Roxane Wilson. This led to the show becoming more &#x27;lighter&#x27; to appeal to the female audiences. Soon after, humour was added to the show, in the form of Jeremy Kewley&#x27;s character, Bryan Gray. These changes worked well and &quot;Stingers&quot; steamed through Seasons 3, 4 and 5, but then Anita Hegh and Ian Stenlake decided to leave the show, causing another drastic change in the series.

Channel Nine, on a nationwide cost-cutting drive, hinted at dropping the show because &quot;Stingers&quot;&#x27; was considered too expensive; its budget had crept up from its original $440,000-per-episode cost, to around $480,000. They dropped a bombshell on the producers: shave around $130,000 every week from the budget or the show would have to cease production. A huge ask, but everyone at &quot;Stingers&quot; was keen to keep going as everyone felt there were still life in the show and plenty of stories to tell.

By the start of the next season the budget was chopped down to $350,000 per episode. Shooting changed from six days per episode to five, stock changed from 16 mm film to SP Betacam Videotape, the crew became smaller, and writers were given less time to write each episode. The location changed from the &quot;Crimplex&quot; (warehouse/studio/offices by the Yarra River) to the studios of Channel Nine in Richmond. Channel Nine spent money on a big new set (plus a new &quot;hospital ward&quot; set and a new &quot;pub/bar&quot; set) and justified the cost by making sure that most of the action on the show now took place inside the studio on the new sets, with a lot less time spent on locations, with less money spent on car chases, stunts and special effects.

Channel Nine also wanted more &quot;star power&quot; in the show, so Gary Sweet was brought in as Luke Harris (and Roxane Wilson decided to leave), and Rebecca Gibney – now out of a job without &quot;Halifax f.p.&quot; – was cast for the first few episodes of the new season. Most of these major changes worked quite well, and most viewers at home would not have been too aware of the changes to the visual quality of the show (such as using tape instead of film).

But, as Executive Producer John Wild humorously pointed out, &quot;the ratings didn&#x27;t change one point!&quot; Channel Nine commissioned more surveys that told them the show needed to appeal to younger viewers. So two new characters were added, played by Daniel Frederiksen and Jacinta Stapleton, and, John Wild said, &quot;and the ratings still didn&#x27;t change one point!&quot; Channel Nine insisted that still more star power was needed to lift the ratings, so Lisa Chappell (Logie winning &quot;McLeod&#x27;s Daughters&quot; star) joined the cast. After still no improvement to the ratings, more star power was further added in guest roles with Bill Hunter, Gigi Edgley, Steve Bisley, Tottie Goldsmith. No improvement still.

&quot;Stingers&quot; was then &quot;rested&quot; for a couple of weeks and replaced by repeats of &quot;&quot;, and these repeats rated better than first-run episodes of &quot;Stingers&quot; (screening a repeat episode of &quot;CSI&quot; probably costs the network about $25,000 as opposed to a first-run episode of &quot;Stingers&quot; at $350,000).

It became clear what Nine would do: move &quot;Stingers&quot; to 10.30pm on a permanent basis and put higher-rating repeats of CSI on at 9.30 p.m. Channel Nine in Adelaide did not like this move and moved &quot;Stingers&quot; to 9:30 Monday nights, however this only lasted for five weeks before it was moved back to 10:30 on a Tuesday night; such a move to a later timeslot caused &quot;Stingers&quot;’ ratings to drop even lower, giving Nine reason to finally end the show. &quot;Stingers&quot;’ curse seemed to be that it always rated well, but it never rated spectacularly.

<doc id="1271095" wikidata="Q7815830" url="?curid=1271095" title="Tom Foran">
<text>Thomas Aquinas Foran (January 11, 1924 – August 6, 2000) was a United States Attorney best known as the chief prosecutor in the Chicago Seven conspiracy trial in which seven defendants, including Jerry Rubin, Abbie Hoffman, David Dellinger, Rennie Davis, and Tom Hayden, were charged with inciting riots at the 1968 Democratic National Convention. Foran also prosecuted several police officers caught on film beating the protestors with clubs.

== Early life and education ==
Foran was born in Chicago, Illinois, on January 11, 1924. His parents were a physician and former high school teacher. He attended Quigley Preparatory Seminary and St. Ignatius High School and began studying at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts. He interrupted his college education to serve as a torpedo bomber pilot in the Pacific in World War II. After the war, he graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in philosophy from Loyola University Chicago and received his law degree at the University of Detroit School of Law in 1950. He married Jean Foran and the couple had six children.

== Legal career ==
Foran was a senior partner in Foran &amp; Schultz (formerly Foran, Wiss &amp; Schultz), the firm he founded in 1957. The other senior partners were Robert E. Wiss, who died in 1995, and Richard G. Schultz. In private practice, he established a reputation as an expert in eminent domain law, representing the city of Chicago in major public works projects, but he also acted as counsel for property owners. Foran became an assistant corporate counsel for Chicago in 1962. 

===U.S. Attorney===
Foran was appointed a United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois in 1968 with the support of the Chicago mayor, Richard M. Daley. He professionalized the office and shifted the office away from patronage. While in this role, he successfully prosecuted more than 150 organized crime figures, including Felix Alderisio, Jackie Cerone, Fiore Buccieri, Richard Cain and William Daddano. In 1969, he was the chief prosecutor of the Chicago Seven conspiracy trial which charged seven defendants, including Jerry Rubin, Abbie Hoffman, David Dellinger, Rennie Davis, and Tom Hayden, with inciting riots at the 1968 Democratic National Convention. He was later censured by a United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit panel &quot;for their open hostility toward the defendants and their failure to fulfill &#x27;the standards of our system of justice&#x27;&quot;.

===Post-U.S. Attorney===
In the 1970 special election, Foran was a campaign aide for Adlai Stevenson III. In the 1980s, Tom Foran represented former Governor Dan Walker in his bank fraud case.

== Later life ==
He died of cancer in Lake Forest, Illinois, on August 6, 2000.

==In popular culture==
Harris Yulin played Foran in the 1987 film &quot;&quot;, and in the animated 2007 film &quot;Chicago 10&quot;, Foran&#x27;s voice was provided by Nick Nolte. He was portrayed by Steven Culp in the 2010 film &quot;The Chicago 8&quot; and by J. C. MacKenzie in the 2020 film, &quot;The Trial of the Chicago 7&quot;.

Gary Houston played Foran in the 1992 stage adaptation from transcripts titled &quot;The Chicago Conspiracy Trial&quot; and produced by Remains Theatre in Chicago.

<text>Reza Abbasi (), also known as Aqa Reza ( – 1635), was the leading Persian miniaturist of the Isfahan School during the later Safavid period, spending most of his career working for Shah Abbas I. He is considered to be the last great master of the Persian miniature, best known for his single miniatures for &quot;muraqqa&quot; or albums, especially single figures of beautiful youths.

==Life and art==
Riza was possibly born in Kashan, as Āqā Riżā Kāshānī is one of the versions of his name; it has also been suggested that he was born in Mashad, where his father, the miniature artist Ali Asghar, is recorded as having worked in the atelier of the governor, Prince Ibrahim Mirza. After Ibrahim&#x27;s murder, Ali Asghar joined Shah Ismail II&#x27;s workshop in the capital Qasvin. Riza probably received his training from his father and joined the workshop of Shah Abbas I at a young age. By this date, the number of royal commissions for illustrated books had diminished, and had been replaced by
album miniatures in terms of employment given to the artists of the royal workshop.

Unlike most earlier Persian artists, he typically signed his work, often giving dates and other details as well, though there are many pieces with signatures that scholars now reject. He may have worked on the ambitious, but incomplete &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, now in the Chester Beatty Library in Dublin. A much later copy of the work, from 1628, at the end of Abbas&#x27; reign and rendered in a very different style, may also be his. It is now in the British Library (MS Additional 27258). His first dated drawing is from 1601, in the Topkapi Palace. A book miniature of 1601–2 in the National Library of Russia has been attributed to him; the only other miniature in the book is probably by his father. He is generally attributed with the 19 miniatures in a &quot;Khusraw and Shirin&quot; of 1631–32, although their quality has been criticised.

His speciality, however, was the single miniature for the albums or &quot;muraqqas&quot; of private collectors, typically showing one or two figures with a lightly drawn garden background, sometimes in gold, in the style formerly used for border paintings, with individual plants dotted about on a plain background. These vary between pure pen drawings and fully painted subjects with colour throughout, with several intermediate varieties. The most typical have at least some colour in the figures, though not in the background; later works tend to have less colour. His, or his buyers&#x27;, favourite subjects were idealized figures of stylishly dressed and beautiful young men. According to Barbara Brend:The line of Riza&#x27;s ink drawings has an absolute mastery conveying texture, form, movement and even personality. His coloured figures, which must often be portraits, are more restrained and lay more emphasis on the fashions of the day, the rich textiles, the carelessly draped turban, the European hat. Effete figures are often presented standing in a curved posture which accentuates their well-fed waists. The style he pioneered remained influential on subsequent generations of Persian painters; several pupils were prominent artists, including Mo&#x27;en Mosavver, who painted his portrait many decades later (illustrated at top) as well as Riza&#x27;s son, Muhammed Shafi Abbasi.

His earlier works were signed Aqa Risa (or Riza, Reza etc., depending on the transliteration used), which, confusingly, is also the name of a contemporary Persian artist who worked for the Mughal Emperor Jahangir in India. In 1603, at the age of about 38, the artist in Persia received the honorific title of &quot;Abbasi&quot; from his patron, the shah, associating him with his name. In the early 20th century, there was much scholarly debate, mostly in German, as to whether the later Aqa Risa and Riza Abbasi were the same figures. It is now accepted that they were, although his style shows a considerable shift in mid-career. Riza Abbasi, the painter, is also not to be confused with his contemporary Ali Riza Abbasi, Shah Abbas&#x27; favourite calligrapher, who in 1598, was appointed to the important position of royal librarian, and therefore in charge of the royal atelier of painters and calligraphers. Both Rizas accompanied the shah on his campaign to Khurasan in 1598 and followed him to the new capital he established in Isfahan from 1597 to 1598. Soon after, Riza Abbasi left the Shah&#x27;s employ in a &quot;mid-life crisis&quot;, apparently seeking greater independence and freedom to associate with Isfahan&#x27;s &quot;low-life&quot; world, including athletes, wrestlers and other unrespectable types. In 1610, he returned to the court, probably because he was short of money, and continued in the employ of the Shah until his death. A series of drawings copying the miniatures attributed to the great 15th-century artist Behzad, which were in the library of the shrine at Ardabil, strongly suggest that Riza had visited the city, probably as part of the Shah&#x27;s party and perhaps on his visits in 1618 or 1625.

About the time of his return to court service, there is a considerable change in his style. &quot;The primary colours and virtuoso technique of his early portraits give way in the 1620s to darker, earthier colours and a coarser, heavier line. New subjects only partly compensate for this disappointing stylistic development&quot;. He painted many older men, perhaps scholars, Sufi divines, or shepherds, as well as birds and Europeans, and in his last years sometimes satirized his subjects.

Sheila Canby&#x27;s 1996 monograph accepts 128 miniatures and drawings as by Riza, or probably so, and lists as &quot;Rejected&quot; or &quot;Uncertain Attributions&quot; a further 109 that have been ascribed to him at some point Today, his works can be found in Tehran in the Reza Abbasi Museum and in the library at the Topkapi Palace in Istanbul. They can also be found in several western museums, such as the Smithsonian, where the Freer Gallery of Art has an album of works by him and pupils, the British Museum, Louvre and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

<text>The Spokane, Portland &amp; Seattle Railway (SP&amp;S; ) was a railroad in the northwest United States. Incorporated in 1905, it was a joint venture by the Great Northern Railway and the Northern Pacific Railway to build a railroad along the north bank of the Columbia River. The railroad later built or acquired other routes in Oregon. The SP&amp;S was merged into the Burlington Northern in March 1970. Remnants of the line are currently operated by BNSF Railway and the Portland and Western Railroad.

==History==
The railroad was chartered in 1905 by James J. Hill to connect the two transcontinental railroads owned by him, the Northern Pacific (NP) and Great Northern (GN), to Portland, Oregon from Spokane, Washington, to gain a portion of the lumber trade in Oregon, a business then dominated by E. H. Harriman&#x27;s Union Pacific and Southern Pacific railroads. Construction began in 1906 under the name Portland &amp; Seattle Railway, proceeding to the east and south from Vancouver, Washington. The work included construction of three major bridges over the Columbia River, the Oregon Slough, and the Willamette River. The northernmost of these was the first bridge of any kind to be built across the lower Columbia River.

Despite legal challenges from Harriman, within a year the line had been built as far as Pasco along the Columbia River, where it connected with NP. The first section to open was from Pasco west to Cliffs (near Maryhill), a length of , on December 15, 1907. Operation was extended west to Lyle, further west, on January 15, 1908, as construction continued on the section from Pasco to Vancouver.

In January 1908 &quot;Spokane&quot; was added to the railroad&#x27;s name, making it the Spokane, Portland &amp; Seattle Railway. A &quot;golden spike&quot; ceremony was held on March 11, 1908 at Sheridan&#x27;s Point to commemorate the completion of the railroad along the Columbia. SP&amp;S freight and passenger service (from Pasco) to Portland was inaugurated in November 1908. (First &amp; Second Subdivisions) By 1909 the railroad had completed construction of its line up to Spokane along the Snake River (Third Subdivision).

In 1910 the SP&amp;S gained control of the Oregon Electric interurban railway, which James J. Hill and the Great Northern had acquired two years before. Under the control of the SP&amp;S (Ninth, Tenth, &amp; Eleventh Subdivision) , the railroad was extended southward to Eugene by 1912. The line was extended from Albany into Lebanon, Oregon and Sweet Home, Oregon in 1931. The Dollar branch was completed from Sweet Home to Dollar, Oregon later that same year.

SP&amp;S also operated a second subsidiary railroad, which James J. Hill purchased in 1907 for 5 million dollars, in northwestern Oregon. This was previously the Astoria and Columbia River Railroad, which created a route in 1898 along the south bank of the Columbia River, from Portland through to Astoria and Seaside. This portion of the SP&amp;S (Sixth &amp; Seventh Subdivision) was known as the &quot;Astoria&quot; or &quot;A&quot; line.

A third route on which the SP&amp;S operated extended southward from Wishram, Washington, to Bend, Oregon, was the Oregon Trunk Railway Company (Fifth Subdivision). Edward Harriman&#x27;s Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company also was building a railroad south from the Columbia River to Bend resulting in a &quot;railroad war&quot; across opposite sides of the Deschutes River in which each railroad attempted to sabotage the other. In the end, the railroad opened using mostly the track of the Oregon Trunk, with a short portion of the Oregon &amp; Washington Railway &amp; Navigation Company track, and both railroads used the route (an arrangement that still exists with BNSF owning the majority of the line and UP having trackage rights). Building this railroad included construction in 1912 of another railroad bridge across the Columbia River, the Oregon Trunk Rail Bridge, at Wishram, Washington.

The 41 mile branch to Goldendale (Fourth Subdivision), the only branch line in Washington State, began at Lyle Washington. This railroad was originally completed in 1903 as the Columbia River &amp; Northern Railway and was quickly acquired by the SP&amp;S after the 1908 completion along the north bank of the Columbia River. This branch was shut down in 1992.

United Railways later became a branch line of the SP&amp;S (Eighth Subdivision). The finished United Railways line went north from Wilkesboro through Banks, Manning, Buxton and Vernonia, Oregon. At this location, the line turned west, eventually reaching the town of Keasey, and continued on to the county line between Clatsop and Columbia Counties. Several logging companies started operation in the area, and used the United Railways to some extent. However, Oregon American traffic continued to be the largest user of the line. In 1944, the United Railways was dissolved and taken over completely by the Spokane Portland &amp; Seattle Railway. In 1953, the line was sold to Long-Bell Lumber Company and in 1956 Long-Bell was sold to International Paper. International Paper had different plans for the region, and by September 1957 the rail traffic was gone. The line from Vernonia westward was abandoned in 1958.

During World War II the SP&amp;S carried war materials to the Pacific Theatre; new industries located along the Columbia River, taking advantage of cheap electricity from hydroelectric dams on the river, including the Bonneville Dam, The Dalles Dam, and the McNary Dam. New industries served by the SP&amp;S included aluminum plants, sawmills, chemical factories and grain elevators.

In 1954, a SP&amp;S train derailed after hitting a rockslide on the route to Bend, Oregon, killing all crew members. Part of the train landed in the Deschutes River, including a boxcar, which landed in a rapid that was later named &quot;Boxcar Rapids&quot; after the incident.

In March 1970, the SP&amp;S was merged into the Burlington Northern Railroad (BN). The BN was the product of the merger of four major railroads: the Great Northern Railway (GN), the Northern Pacific Railway (NP), the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway (SP&amp;S) and the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (CB&amp;Q).

The history of the railroad is chronicled and preserved by the SP&amp;S Historical Society.

== Passenger trains ==

The SP&amp;S&#x27;s passenger operations mostly involved hosting connections with parents&#x27; trains, such as the &quot;Empire Builder&quot; and &quot;North Coast Limited&quot;, which were combined to form the Streamliner (No. 1/No. 2). &quot;Oriental Limited&quot;, &quot;Mainstreeter&quot;, and &quot;Western Star&quot; connected with (No. 3/No. 4). However, some of these SP&amp;S trains were named. The &quot;Inland Empire Express&quot; (daytime) and &quot;North Bank Limited&quot; (overnight) provided daily, through service between Portland and Spokane. The &quot;Columbia River Express&quot; (No. 5/No. 6) operated between Portland and Pasco, connecting at Pasco with Northern Pacific No. 5/No. 6 for service to/from Spokane. From 1908 until the 1920s, the SP&amp;S used the North Bank Depot as its Portland Terminus. After the 1920s, it used Portland (Union Station) for their passenger station arrivals and departures.

The only surviving SP&amp;S Business car, the (second) No. 99 or &quot;The Ruth M.&quot; (as nicknamed by a later private owner) is in operating condition and being further restored. It was built in 1915 by Barney and Smith and reconfigured by the railroad in 1927, 1948, and lastly in 1959. It resides at the Chehalis–Centralia Railroad since 2017. The car will be used as &quot;premier seating&quot;, and during dinner trains can host a private party of up to eight in its lounge and dining room. As of 2023, the car has been repainted, and is in need of further cosmetic and mechanical repairs. The SP&amp;S Historical Society is assisting with the efforts.

Two surviving SP&amp;S Sleeper/Lounge cars are housed at museums, located at both ends of the reach of the railroad. These were built by the Pullman Standard Manufacturing Co. of Chicago and delivered to the railroad in 1950 at a cost of about $250,000. These cars ran in the &quot;Empire Builder&quot; service (Trains No. 1/No. 2) between Portland and Spokane. Weighing 131,000 pounds and seating up to 37 (with seating for 22 in the lounge), these lounge cars allowed passengers to buy food and drinks to enjoy with comfortable seating. The &quot;Mt. St. Helens&quot; No. 601 is at the Inland NW Rail Museum near Spokane. The &quot;Mt. Hood&quot; No. 600 is owned by the Pacific Northwest Chapter of the National Railway Historical Society and is housed at the Oregon Rail Heritage Center in Portland. These cars had a full-length antenna on the car roof. Of special note in the lounge was the push-button Farnsworth AM radio. The cars contained six single-person roomettes and three large 2-person compartments, two of them can be opened to provide a 4-person room.

Four passenger coaches, a combine, a buffet-observation car, a mail storage car, and a Pullman sleeper car are preserved at the Northwest Railway Museum in Snoqualmie, Washington. Wood coaches 213 and 218 (Barney &amp; Smith 1912) were restored to running order between 2007 and 2019 on the museum&#x27;s interpretive railway. Steel coaches 275 and 276 are also Barney &amp; Smith products, built in 1915. Coach 275 is in storage awaiting restoration, and 276 is in running order on the museum&#x27;s interpretive railway. Combine 272 (Barney &amp; Smith 1915) was built as a coach but later modified to include a baggage section. Wood observation car 556 (Barney &amp; Smith 1912) and steel mail storage car 52 (Barney &amp; Smith 1915) are both in storage awaiting restoration. Mail storage car 52 was originally mail and express car 40. Pullman sleeper Wapinitia Pass #701 (Pullman 1950) was built for pool service with the Empire Builder. All of these cars were acquired by the Northwest Railway Museum between the early 1970s and early 1980s.

<doc id="1271110" wikidata="Q3007847" url="?curid=1271110" title="Curtiss Robin">
<text>The Curtiss Robin, introduced in 1928, is an American high-wing monoplane built by the Curtiss-Robertson Airplane Manufacturing Company.
The J-1 version was flown by Wrongway Corrigan who crossed the Atlantic after being refused permission to do so.

==Design==
The Robin, a workmanlike cabin monoplane, had a wooden wing and steel tubing fuselage. The cabin accommodated three persons; two passengers were seated side-by-side behind the pilot. Early Robins were distinguished by large flat fairings over the parallel diagonal wing bracing struts; the fairings were abandoned on later versions, having been found to be ineffective in creating lift. The original landing gear had bungee rubber cord shock absorbers, later replaced by an oleo-pneumatic system; a number of Robins had twin floats added. Variants of the Robin were fitted with engines which developed .

==Operational history==
A single modified Robin (with a Warner R-420-1) was used by the United States Army Air Corps, and designated the &quot;XC-10&quot;. This aircraft was used in a test program for radio-controlled (and unmanned) flight.

Cuba&#x27;s national airline, Compañía Nacional Cubana de Aviación Curtiss, was founded in 1929 with the Curtiss-Wright company serving as its co-founder and major investor. The airline&#x27;s first aircraft was a Curtiss Robin and it was flown on domestic routes as a mail and passenger transport.

From September 1929 to May 1930 a Robin C-1 was used to deliver the McCook, Nebraska &quot;Daily Gazette&quot; to communities in rural Nebraska and Kansas. The airplane flew a nonstop route of daily, dropping bundles of newspapers from a height of to local carriers.

A Curtiss Robin C was purchased by the Paraguayan government in 1932 for the transport squadron of its air arm. It was intensively used as a VIP transport plane and air ambulance during the Chaco War (1932–1935).

<doc id="1271111" wikidata="Q5327187" url="?curid=1271111" title="Eartha">
<text>Eartha is the world&#x27;s largest rotating and revolving globe, located within the former headquarters of the DeLorme mapping corporation in Yarmouth, Maine. Garmin purchased the company and the building in 2016. The globe weighs approximately 5,600 pounds (2,500 kg), and has a diameter of over 41 feet (12.5 m).

==Construction==
The globe was built with a scale of 1:1,000,000, on which one inch represents sixteen miles (1mm = 1km). As with most globes, it is mounted at a 23.5 degree angle, the same axial tilt as the Earth itself; thus the equator is diagonal to the floor. It uses a cantilever mount with two motors, and simulates one day&#x27;s revolution and rotation every 18 minutes, though it is possible for the motors to fully rotate the globe in as little as one minute.

The globe was completed in 1998, after two years of construction and planning, and it uses a composite database built from satellite imagery, shaded relief, colored bathymetry, and information about road networks and urban areas. The database used to generate the surface images was approximately 140 gigabytes.

Former CEO of DeLorme Maps, David DeLorme, designed the globe, while Lewiston-based surveyor and civil engineer, Vincent J.P. Leblanc, was involved in the building project. Map technician Jeff Clark was responsible for the 792 plastic sections that cover the rotating globe.

Eartha is contained in an atrium with several glass walls that allow it to be seen from outside of the building; it is readily visible from U.S. Route 1. At night, the globe is illuminated.

Eartha is constructed around a truss structure which is called &quot;Omni-Span&quot;, and consists of over 6000 pieces of aluminum tubing. The map panels each cover 8 degrees of latitude and 10 degrees of longitude, and are attached to the trusses with a custom-designed system of hidden bolts.

==Public viewing==

The atrium containing Eartha is open to the public during business hours. There was an adjacent coffee shop which, in 2016, replaced a gift shop that carried various DeLorme and geography-related products. A cafeteria returned at the time of Garmin&#x27;s acquisition. 

The mounting equipment is in a large pit below floor level and is visible to visitors, but the stairway down is chained off to prevent public access. There are two balconies that allow visitors to more easily view the higher parts of the globe.

Eartha was originally designed to be in diameter. In 1999, surveyors hired by the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; measured the globe at . The previous record holder is the Globe of Peace located in Apecchio, Pesaro, Italy.

<doc id="1271113" wikidata="Q5436853" url="?curid=1271113" title="Fassionola">
<text>Fassionola is a typically fruit-flavored (passion fruit and others), red-colored syrup that was frequently used in tropical drinks during the 1930s but is now a relatively unusual ingredient. It also comes in green and gold varieties that are sometimes made to taste differently. It is used as a fruit punch concentrate, and some claim that a red-colored fruit syrup called fassionola was an ingredient in the original Hurricane cocktail. Although a frequent attribution, solid evidence of fassionola&#x27;s use in the Hurricane from before 1956 is lacking, and it is not known what the precise ingredients were in the earliest version of fassionola.

== Tiki drink usage ==
Claimed to have been first fashioned in 1916, the complete history of fassionola is unclear but is closely associated with Donn Beach (AKA Don the Beachcomber). Beach cites his childhood as growing up near New Orleans, and he sometimes used fassionola in making what came to be known as &quot;tiki drinks&quot; in his 1930s-era bars. Some claim fassionola was invented by Beach; others believe that is unclear. Regardless, the ingredient is listed as being used by Beach in the book &quot;Hawai&#x27;i, Rum Drinks &amp; Cuisine by Don the Beachcomber&quot; and calls for its use in some of Beach&#x27;s more well-known drinks such as the &quot;Cobra&#x27;s Fang&quot;, &quot;Pi Yi&quot;, and &quot;Rum Barrel&quot;. The book also discusses the extent that Beach went to in order to keep his recipes a secret, premixing ingredients himself and relabeling bottles with only numbers and letters, with recipes sometimes written in code.

Trader Vic listed what he called &quot;passionola&quot; in the index of his 1972 revised &quot;Bartender&#x27;s Guide&quot;. He described it as &quot;a non-alcoholic syrup made from passion fruit [that] comes in three colors — red, green, and natural&quot;. He did not, however, list it as an ingredient for any of the cocktails in his book.

21st-century drink makers continue to use the ingredient in tiki cocktail recipes, where it is viewed by some as a &quot;secret ingredient&quot; and by others as a generic fruit punch concentrate.

==Commercial brands==
A common and the attributed original mass manufactured brand is &quot;Jonathan English&#x27;s Brand Red Tropical Gold Fruit Mix&quot;, produced and distributed by the Jonathan English Company in San Diego since the 1950s.

<text>Justin Ahomadegbé-Tomêtin (January 16, 1917 – March 8, 2002) was a Beninese politician most active when his country was known as Dahomey. He arose on a political scene where one&#x27;s power was dictated by what region of Dahomey one lived in. He served as president of the National Assembly of Dahomey from April 1959 to November 1960 and as prime minister and vice president of Dahomey from 1964 to 1965.

Ahomadégbé became president as part of a system that rotated the office between three leading political figures: Ahomadégbé, Hubert Maga, and Sourou-Migan Apithy. Maga peacefully handed power to Ahomadégbé on May 7, 1972. On October 26, 1972, he was overthrown in a coup d&#x27;état led by Mathieu Kérékou. All three remained under house arrest until 1981.

==Early life and entry into politics==

Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin was born on January 16, 1917, a direct descendant of the kings of Abomey, the town of his birth. He attended the École William Ponty and the French West Africa School of Medicine in Dakar. He served in the French Army for a short while, where he attained the rank of sergeant. After his short military career, Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin decided to pursue dentistry, opening an office in Porto-Novo.

Originally a member of the Dahomeyan Progressive Union (UPD), in 1946 he established the African People&#x27;s Bloc (BPA), and was elected to the General Council shortly afterwards. He was re-elected in 1952. In 1955 the BPA merged with the UPD to established the Dahomeyan Democratic Union (UDD). He was a vocal critic of the French rule, and gained influence upon allying himself with trade unions. Using this, Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin was elected Mayor of Abomey in November 1956 elections.

The results of the territorial elections of 1959 were as such: the Republican Party of Dahomey (PRD), led by Sourou-Migan Apithy received 37 seats with 144,038 votes; the Dahomeyan Democratic Rally (RDD), led by Hubert Maga received 22 seats with 62,132 votes; and Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin&#x27;s UDD receiving just 11 deputies for its 162,179 votes. What followed was described by journalist Robert Matthews as &quot;an immediate explosion&quot;. Supporters of Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin started riots that were so severe that French soldiers were called in to quell them. Apithy and Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin agreed to split the contested 18 seats in a southwest constituency among themselves as a result of a mediation performed by Félix Houphouët-Boigny. However, Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin made it clear that he would not allow Apithy to remain the prime minister of Dahomey, but Apithy was not going to listen to his demands. Maga was chosen as a compromise for the premiership and was voted into this post on May 22, 1959.

==Independence and dissent==

On August 1, 1960, Dahomey gained its independence and Maga became its first president. Shortly after independence, the three parties united into the &quot;Patriotic Action Front&quot; and redistricted Dahomey into one electoral constituency. Under this system, they would provide a list of candidates of whom whoever received a majority would win all legislative seats. It did not last long; soon, Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin broke from the union and, using the discontent among people over the increasing rarity of jobs in the country, incited demonstrations. In September 1960 he claimed that a single-party state was the only solution to the stagnation of the economy; since he had just broken from one, he was looking for another party to be led by him.

Meanwhile, Maga made Houphouët-Boigny recognise the RDD as the Dahomeyan wing of his African Democratic Rally. Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin had always believed that the UDD was the sole representative of the Rally.

At the end of September Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin convinced the trade unions that he owned to begin another strike for Maga&#x27;s inability to promote national development and ensure the welfare of the working class. The strike, which existed in Dahomey&#x27;s capital of Porto-Novo and its largest city of Cotonou, became so serious that police forces used tear gas and ended when Maga sent down some faithful Northerners, carrying around bows and arrows and patrolling the streets at night. At the same time members of the UDD organised a motion of censure in the National Assembly. Maga relied on Apithy for help in opposing the motion, and it was ultimately rejected.

Right after the motion was rejected, UDD deputies began quitting their jobs. They were in turn replaced by deputies of the PRD Shortly after this the PRD and RDD merged to form the Dahomeyan Unity Party (PDU) and Maga was naturally elected its leader. On December 11, Maga was formally elected president and Apithy vice president. In the parliamentary elections the PDU received 69% of the vote and UDD 31%, although it was not represented in the National Assembly.

==Maga assassination plot==
On May 26 Information Minister Albert Tévoédjrè notified Maga that Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin had plotted to assassinate the president but he and 11 other dissidents had been arrested. The trial date was set for December. It differed from many political trials in Africa being that it was held in public and the defence was allowed a lawyer from Paris. In any event, Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin received five years for his role in the conspiracy, and the others were dealt from one- to ten-year sentences. The UDD was also banned. Maga ultimately released them in November 1962, saying in a broadcast that it was not only due to their good behavior in jail but also to reconcile with his former enemies.

==Presidential council==
===Background and 1970 election===
On December 10, 1969, Émile Derlin Zinsou was overthrown by Maurice Kouandété, who had installed him as president in the first place. The military, however, refused to recognize Kouandété, and as the two men could not reach agreement, a Military Directorate was established with Paul-Émile de Souza as its chairman. An election was held on March 28, 1970, to determine the true president. On this occasion, the triumvirate was allowed to campaign, and they did not miss the chance. Intimidation and bribery were commonplace, and the electoral campaign saw the comeback of regional loyalties. It was also marked by a series of violent outbursts; invalidated reports state that six people were killed or wounded at incidents in Parakou on the eve of the elections. Fellow candidate Zinsou asserted that Maga supporters had killed one of his supporters during said incidents.

These charges did not affect Maga&#x27;s standing in the polls; he received a majority of the vote in the north, and Apithy and Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin received a majority in the southeast and southwest/central, respectively. The election results were as follows: 252,551 citizens voted for Maga; 200,091 for Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin, and 186,332 for Apithy. In the entire south, Maga received 24,000 votes compared to the 180,000 who voted for him in the Borgou Department, obtaining 97.3 percent of the 78 percent turnout. Zinsou, running to counter the constant tribal clashes, received 3 percent, with 17,551 votes.

Nonetheless, de Souza decided to nullify the results from Atakora, the region where Maga received the most votes, on April 3. Outraged, Maga formed the Assembly of the Peoples of the North, which threatened to secede unless he was declared president. He refused to leave his campaign headquarters at Parakou even to attend political meetings. Maga&#x27;s reaction to the nullification prompted many southern workers to flee the north. Apithy stated that he would convince his region to join Nigeria if Maga took the presidency and took steps to bribe his way into that office. Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin claimed Maga had defrauded the electoral system to his advantage. In contrast with the other three former presidents, Zinsou admitted that he had been defeated and decided participate in bargaining, explaining that he rejected the idea of a coalition &quot;for personal reasons&quot;. The other former presidents, on the other hand, agreed to a hasty compromise on April 13 to prevent a civil war.

===Under Maga===
A presidential council, consisting of Maga, Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin, and Apithy, was set up on May 7 with a presidency that changed every two years. Maga inaugurated this system for the first two years. Each man agreed to not use the military to extend their term or use any other means toward that consequence. If decisions were not unanimous during the first round of voting, a two councilman majority would suffice on the second round. The council served as the executive and legislative branch of Dahomey.

The cabinet was composed of four Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin allies, three Maga allies, and three allies of Apithy. Gabriel Lozès, appointed minister of finance; Theophile Paoletti, new minister of information and tourism; Edmond Doussou-Yovo, minister of education; and Karl Ahouansou, minister of communication, were all friends of Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin. Maga&#x27;s colleagues in the cabinet were Pascal Chabi Kao, minister of finance; Albert Ouassa, minister of health; and Chabi Mama, minister of rural development; while Apithy friends were Ambroise Agboton, minister of labor; Joseph Keke, minister of economy and planning; and Michel Toko, minister of justice and guardian of the seals. Daouda Badarou, who had served as foreign minister under Zinsou, was allowed to keep his job.

Maga&#x27;s economic policies during his chairmanship helped quiet union leaders whose protests during his presidency had been intense. He helped create a tax plan that would finance their salaries by cutting expenditures and cracking down on tax evasion. In 1970 Dahomey witnessed a surplus of 429 million CFA francs, rising to a 570 million CFA franc surplus the following year. With the national economy in a favorable position, Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin and the rest of the council could afford a number of luxuries, including three houses and three Mercedes-Benz 300 automobiles to be shared amongst themselves, and festivals for the anniversary of the founding of the triumvirate.

The Council lost popularity with the Kutuklui Affair. By decree of Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin and the rest of the council, Togolese opposition leader Noe Kutuklui was officially expelled from Dahomey on October 27, 1971, where he had been practicing law since the late 1960s. It was at the request of General Étienne Eyadéma, president of Togo, as Kutuklui had been involved in several plots against Eyadema&#x27;s military government. The council&#x27;s decision to extradite him spurred demonstrations in Cotonou. Maga was unable to carry out his decision; Alphonse Alley protected Kutuklui and took him to an unknown place outside of Dahomey. Col. Alley received no punishment whatsoever for his role in the Affair.

Students were some of those involved in the protests, and they soon had another reason to conflict with their government. On November 5, 1971, Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin and his administration shut down the Union Général des Etudiants et Eleves de Dahomey (UGEED), a radical youth group which sought to &quot;transform Dahomey into a battlefield&quot; using &quot;workers, soldiers, and policemen&quot;. This stemmed from UGEED-sponsored demonstrations against the minister of education when he failed to attend an educational meeting. Students whose schools followed the strike were allowed back to school on November 19, and only if their parents signed documents that said they would not participate in more demonstrations. If they failed to comply, they would be expelled from the educational system of Dahomey. Government-instituted rallies were arranged to support the ban.

The military was also aroused. The formation of a presidential council only further enraged the army. Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin was ambushed while traveling to a rally in Abomey on May 7, 1971. Maga initially denied its existence, and to this day details are unclear. An artillery camp at Ouidah was the location of another military uprising on January 28, 1972. The president sent two officers to overpower the rebels although no punishment was undertaken. Both Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin and Maga believed that the latter incident was an attempted coup.

Kouandété attempted to usurp power again at dawn on February 23. When he first heard of the mutiny, Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin believed that it was an attempt by Maga to remain in power. Leading the Ouidah garrison, Kouandété also attempted to take over government buildings and murder de Souza. Over the course of the operation, assailant Major Moumouni was mortally wounded by de Souza&#x27;s bullets. The plot was foiled, although Maga canceled a visit to France to attend to the matter at hand. A 12-member military commission would soon discover another plot, that would have been undertaken simultaneous to Kouandété&#x27;s. According to its findings, Captains Glele and Pierre Boni were going to follow Kouandété until de Souza was assassinated, when they would eradicate their leader and insert Zinsou back into power. The recent events epitomised the council&#x27;s &quot;fear and contempt&quot; for the military.

===Under Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin===
Maga transferred power to Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin on May 7, 1972. This was the first time in 12 years that the head of Dahomey was succeeded in a nonmilitary fashion. The new chairman congratulated Maga and praised the triumvirate as &quot;one of Dahomey&#x27;s most beneficial institutions.&quot; It was believed that the triumvirate would continually undermine each other, and the simple transition of power was viewed as a positive step toward Dahomeyan unity.

The Presidential Council was slow in organizing a military trial for the 1972 coup plotters, and it did not begin until May 12. The court tried 21 men besides Kouandété, mostly military officers but also including several commoners and even Maga bodyguards. The punishments were announced on May 16. Kouandété received the death penalty, as did Captains Josué and Glélé, Quartermaster Sergeant Agboton, and a corporal and a sergeant &quot;in absentia&quot;. Lesser sentences were handed to five men who were given life imprisonment, two who would serve 20 years in prison, another with 15 years, two with ten, and two with five. An additional four were acquitted. The sentences were never carried out; the jurors believed that Kouandété would seize power in another coup.

Another delayed function of the council was the formation of the Assemblée Consultative Nationale, an advisory assembly required by the 1970 constitution. As per the constitution, such an assembly would contain 30 members advising councilmen on economic, social, and other issues, with Paul Darboux presiding. It was not established until July 1972, due to, in the words of academic Samuel Decalo, &quot;intensive horse-trading between the partners in the Presidential Council ... and pressures from their political lieutenants for a position in the Assembly.&quot;

One of the most notable aspects of Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin&#x27;s time in power was the Kovacs Affair. It began with Pascal Chabi Kao being given a monopoly over selling official stationery to the Presidential Council and spread to claims of bribery and embezzlement. Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin tried to fire Chabi Kao, but Maga, who was Chabi Kao&#x27;s mentor, refused. Maga convinced Apithy to help and the bill was vetoed.
Another coup was launched by soldiers of the Ouidah garrison on October 26. This one, however, was successful, and Major Mathieu Kérékou was installed as president. It occurred during a cabinet meeting between Maga and Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin. Kérékou had served as Maga&#x27;s aide-de-camp in 1961. According to reports at the scene, soldiers abruptly arrived in the Cabinet room of the presidential palace and started firing bullets, but no one was injured. Kérékou called the triumvirate &quot;truly a monster&quot; as it showed &quot;unpardonable incompetence&quot;, amongst other charges which were used to justify the coup. Kouandété was pardoned, although the former council was not. Maga, Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin, and Apithy spent more than nine years in prison before being freed by Kérékou in 1981.

==Later life and death==
After being released from incarceration, Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin was elected a member of parliament in 1991 under the National Rally for Democracy ticket and served at until 1995. He continued to lead the U.D.D. until his death on March 8, 2002, at the Hubert Maga National University and Hospital Center in Cotonou. No cause of death was given, although he was said to have suffered for a long time. The last of the triumvirate to die, he was awarded a state funeral and seven days of mourning, beginning on March 11. Flags were ordered to be flown at half-staff throughout the country during that period. President Kerekou visited Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin&#x27;s house shortly after his death, praising him as &quot;a man of character, conviction, a fighter and a wise man&quot;.

The death of Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin, which dominated newspapers in Dahomey, was received with more ambivalence than Kerekou&#x27;s positive sentiments. &quot;Le Progres&quot; went so far as to say that Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin was &quot;the monster of Abomey&quot;, and that he was &quot;envied by his brothers due to his frankness and integrity ... Many of those now commending his patriotism, high morals and political exploits somehow killed him at one time or other.&quot; &quot;Le Matinal&quot; wrote an article on the man, entitled &quot;Message from beyond: Ahomadegbe challenges Kerekou&quot;, questioning why &quot;the perpetrators of crimes [are] so indecent as to shed crocodile tears&quot;. More neutral was &quot;Fraternite&quot;, noting that &quot;Ahomadegbe, whose political might was extraordinary, was among the most feared politicians in Benin&#x27;s contemporary history. He was dangerous to have either as friend or foe. To him, politics was a winding sentence with several commas but no full stop.&quot;

&quot;Le Republicain&quot; compared his fall to that of a baobab tree, reflecting the mostly sad emotions that followed his departing. According to them, Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin &quot;was among the three great thinkers who took turns to lead Dahomey (now Benin) from May 1970 to October 1972&quot;. A long prison sentence did not affect his inspiratory qualities. &quot;Les Echos du Jour&quot; stated that &quot;the dental surgeon who became president fought to the end against life and its mishaps, then against death ... He resisted with all his might not to escape death, but merely to show that nothing was over until it was over.&quot; In an obituary, &quot;Jeune Afrique&quot; described the man as &quot;humor[ous], loved good cheer, knew how to enjoy the good side of life, but his blows of anger were Homeric&quot;.

<text>Philosophical realismusually not treated as a position of its own but as a stance towards other subject mattersis the view that a certain kind of thing (ranging widely from abstract objects like numbers to moral statements to the physical world itself) has &quot;mind-independent existence&quot;, i.e. that it exists even in the absence of any mind perceiving it or that its existence is not just a mere appearance in the eye of the beholder. This includes a number of positions within epistemology and metaphysics which express that a given thing instead exists independently of knowledge, thought, or understanding. This can apply to items such as the physical world, the past and future, other minds, and the self, though may also apply less directly to things such as universals, mathematical truths, moral truths, and thought itself. However, realism may also include various positions which instead reject metaphysical treatments of reality altogether.

Realism can also be a view about the properties of reality in general, holding that reality exists independent of the mind, as opposed to non-realist views (like some forms of skepticism and solipsism) which question the certainty of anything beyond one&#x27;s own mind. Philosophers who profess realism often claim that truth consists in a correspondence between cognitive representations and reality.

Realists tend to believe that whatever we believe now is only an approximation of reality but that the accuracy and fullness of understanding can be improved. In some contexts, realism is contrasted with idealism. Today it is more often contrasted with anti-realism, for example in the philosophy of science.

The oldest use of the term &quot;realism&quot; appeared in medieval scholastic interpretations and adaptations of ancient Greek philosophy.

The position was also held among many ancient Indian philosophies.

==Etymology==
The term comes from Late Latin &quot;realis&quot; &quot;real&quot; and was first used in the abstract metaphysical sense by Immanuel Kant in 1781 (&quot;CPR&quot; A 369).

==Varieties==
===Metaphysical realism===

Metaphysical realism maintains that &quot;whatever exists does so, and has the properties and relations it does, independently of deriving its existence or nature from being thought of or experienced.&quot; In other words, an objective reality exists (not merely one or more subjective realities).

===Naive or direct realism===
Naive realism, also known as direct realism, is a philosophy of mind rooted in a common sense theory of perception that claims that the senses provide us with direct awareness of the external world.

In contrast, some forms of idealism assert that no world exists apart from mind-dependent ideas and some forms of skepticism say we cannot trust our senses. The naive realist view is that objects have properties, such as texture, smell, taste and colour, that are usually perceived absolutely correctly. We perceive them as they &quot;really&quot; are.

=== Immanent realism ===

Immanent realism is the ontological understanding which holds that universals are immanently real within particulars themselves, not in a separate realm, and not mere names. Most often associated with Aristotle and the Aristotelian tradition.

===Scientific realism===

Scientific realism is, at the most general level, the view that the world described by science is the real world, as it is, independent of what we might take it to be. Within philosophy of science, it is often framed as an answer to the question &quot;how is the success of science to be explained?&quot; The debate over what the success of science involves centers primarily on the status of unobservable entities apparently talked about by scientific theories. Generally, those who are scientific realists assert that one can make reliable claims about unobservables (viz., that they have the same ontological status) as observables. Analytic philosophers generally have a commitment to scientific realism, in the sense of regarding the scientific method as a reliable guide to the nature of reality. The main alternative to scientific realism is instrumentalism.

====Scientific realism in physics====
Realism in physics (especially quantum mechanics) is the claim that the world is in some sense mind-independent: that even if the results of a possible measurement do not pre-exist the act of measurement, that does not require that they are the creation of the observer (contrary to the &quot;consciousness causes collapse&quot; interpretation of quantum mechanics). That interpretation of quantum mechanics, on the other hand, states that the wave function is already the full description of reality. The different possible realities described by the wave function are equally true. The observer collapses the wave function into their own reality. One&#x27;s reality can be mind-dependent under this interpretation of quantum mechanics.

===Moral realism===
Moral realism is the position that ethical sentences express propositions that refer to objective features of the world.

===Aesthetic realism===
Aesthetic realism (not to be confused with Aesthetic Realism, the philosophy developed by Eli Siegel, or &quot;realism&quot; in the arts) is the view that there are mind-independent aesthetic facts.

==History of metaphysical realism==

===Ancient Greek philosophy===
In ancient Greek philosophy, realist doctrines about universals were proposed by Plato and Aristotle.

Platonic realism is a radical form of realism regarding the existence of abstract objects, including universals, which are often translated from Plato&#x27;s works as &quot;Forms&quot;. Since Plato frames Forms as ideas that are literally real (existing even outside of human minds), this stance is also called Platonic idealism. This should not be confused with &quot;idealistic&quot; in the ordinary sense of &quot;optimistic&quot; or with other types of philosophical idealism, as presented by philosophers such as George Berkeley. As Platonic abstractions are not spatial, temporal, or subjectively mental, they are arguably not compatible with the emphasis of Berkeley&#x27;s idealism grounded in mental existence. Plato&#x27;s Forms include numbers and geometrical figures, making his theory also include mathematical realism; they also include the Form of the Good, making it additionally include ethical realism.

In Aristotle&#x27;s more modest view, the existence of universals (like &quot;blueness&quot;) is dependent on the particulars that exemplify them (like a particular &quot;blue bird&quot;, &quot;blue piece of paper&quot;, &quot;blue robe&quot;, etc.), and those particulars exist independent of any minds: classic metaphysical realism.

===Ancient Indian Philosophy===
There were many ancient Indian realist schools, such as the Mimamsa, Vishishtadvaita, Dvaita, Nyaya, Yoga, Samkhya, Sauntrantika, Jain, Vaisesika, and others. They argued for their realist positions, and heavily criticized idealism, like that of the Yogachara, and composed refutations of the Yogacara position.

===Medieval philosophy===
Medieval realism developed out of debates over the problem of universals. Universals are terms or properties that can be applied to many things, such as &quot;red&quot;, &quot;beauty&quot;, &quot;five&quot;, or &quot;dog&quot;. Realism (also known as exaggerated realism) in this context, contrasted with conceptualism and nominalism, holds that such universals really exist, independently and somehow prior to the world. Moderate realism holds that they exist, but only insofar as they are instantiated in specific things; they do not exist &quot;separately&quot; from the specific thing. Conceptualism holds that they exist, but only in the mind, while nominalism holds that universals do not &quot;exist&quot; at all but are no more than words (&quot;flatus vocis&quot;) that describe specific objects.

Proponents of moderate realism included Thomas Aquinas, Bonaventure, and Duns Scotus (cf. Scotist realism).

===Early modern philosophy===
In early modern philosophy, Scottish Common Sense Realism was a school of philosophy which sought to defend naive realism against philosophical paradox and scepticism, arguing that matters of common sense are within the reach of common understanding and that common-sense beliefs even govern the lives and thoughts of those who hold non-commonsensical beliefs. It originated in the ideas of the most prominent members of the Scottish School of Common Sense, Thomas Reid, Adam Ferguson and Dugald Stewart, during the 18th century Scottish Enlightenment and flourished in the late 18th and early 19th centuries in Scotland and America.

The roots of Scottish Common Sense Realism can be found in responses to such philosophers as John Locke, George Berkeley, and David Hume. The approach was a response to the &quot;ideal system&quot; that began with Descartes&#x27; concept of the limitations of sense experience and led Locke and Hume to a skepticism that called religion and the evidence of the senses equally into question. The common sense realists found skepticism to be absurd and so contrary to common experience that it had to be rejected. They taught that ordinary experiences provide intuitively certain assurance of the existence of the self, of real objects that could be seen and felt and of certain &quot;first principles&quot; upon which sound morality and religious beliefs could be established. Its basic principle was enunciated by its founder and greatest figure, Thomas Reid:

:If there are certain principles, as I think there are, which the constitution of our nature leads us to believe, and which we are under a necessity to take for granted in the common concerns of life, without being able to give a reason for them—these are what we call the principles of common sense; and what is manifestly contrary to them, is what we call absurd.

===Late modern philosophy===

In late modern philosophy, a notable school of thought advocating metaphysical realism was Austrian realism. Its members included Franz Brentano, Alexius Meinong, Vittorio Benussi, Ernst Mally, and early Edmund Husserl. These thinkers stressed the objectivity of truth and its independence of the nature of those who judge it. (See also &quot;Graz School&quot;.)

Dialectical materialism, a philosophy of nature based on the writings of late modern philosophers Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, is interpreted to be a form of ontological realism.

According to Michael Resnik, Gottlob Frege&#x27;s work after 1891 can be interpreted as a contribution to realism.

===Contemporary philosophy===

In contemporary analytic philosophy, Bertrand Russell, Ludwig Wittgenstein, J. L. Austin, Karl Popper, and Gustav Bergmann espoused metaphysical realism. Hilary Putnam initially espoused metaphysical realism, but he later embraced a form of anti-realism that he termed &quot;internal realism.&quot; Conceptualist realism (a view put forward by David Wiggins) is a form of realism, according to which our conceptual framework maps reality.

Speculative realism is a movement in contemporary Continental-inspired philosophy that defines itself loosely in its stance of metaphysical realism against the dominant forms of post-Kantian philosophy.

<doc id="1271130" wikidata="Q6813110" url="?curid=1271130" title="Melling, New Zealand">
<text>Melling is a suburb of Lower Hutt, to the north of Wellington in the North Island of New Zealand. It is on the west bank of the Hutt River, on State Highway 2, the Wellington-Hutt main road, and directly across the river from the centre of Lower Hutt. It is also the name of the three-lane bridge connecting the Hutt City central business district with State Highway 2, a route subject to extensive congestion at peak times. From the Melling Bridge it is possible to drive straight ahead into the hill suburbs of Harbour View and Tirohanga.

Improved interchanges are planned for the Melling and Kennedy-Good bridges. 
==History==
Melling was named after William Melling, a former Lancashire mentor of Richard Seddon in the foundry where he worked prior to leaving for New Zealand. Seddon and Melling remained in touch, with gifts of New Zealand lamb being sent to Melling at his home in St Helens at Christmas time. The name came about after then-Premier Seddon revisited England and his friend Melling in 1897. Melling had never visited New Zealand, and the local settlers intended to change the name to one of greater significance.

The original Melling railway station opened on 26 May 1908, while the Melling bridge opened in 1909.

==Melling Line==
The Melling Railway Station is the terminus of the Melling Line which provides a suburban commuter service to Wellington. This line was originally part of the Hutt Valley Line through to Upper Hutt and the Wairarapa, but became a separate (electrified) branch line on 1 March 1954, when the section north of Melling to Haywards (now Manor Park) was closed and replaced by a new double-tracked line on the eastern side of the Hutt River (the old Melling-Haywards section could not be double-tracked).

==Demographics==
Melling is included in the Alicetown-Melling statistical area.

Finally Galindo made his debut with the first team in the 2002 spring season, and was a solid starter by the 2003 Clausura season. Galindo was a member of the senior national team, and has played for numerous Mexico youth teams; a starter for the U-23 team at the 2004 Summer Olympics.

Two games into the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup, Galindo along with teammate (of both club and country) Salvador Carmona were separated from the rest of the national team staying in Göttingen, Germany. Initially disciplinary problems was the explanation given by the Mexico federation for the separation, the federation later confirmed both players tested positive for performance enhancement drugs. Both men received a one-year ban from competition, which barred Galindo from playing in the 2005 Apertura, 2006 Clausura seasons, and the 2006 FIFA World Cup.

===Hércules CF===
Galindo signed in the summer of 2006 with Hércules CF of the Spanish second division. Despite being considered a major signing by the club he played very few games and was on the bench for most of the season.

===Grasshopper Club Zürich===
Galindo signed a contract with Swiss team Grasshopper Club Zürich in February 2007. Galindo capped his first goal with Grasshopper Club Zürich and in the Swiss Super League on 17 February 2007 against FC Thun. He scored the first goal in the match for Grasshoppers in the 49th minute. The goal came after teammate Diego León&#x27;s pass to Sreto Ristić, who in turn gave a through pass to Galindo. Taking advantage of the opportunity, Galindo&#x27;s shot ended up in Thun&#x27;s nets. His first goal contributed to Grasshoppers&#x27; 2–0 win over Thun.

===Eintracht Frankfurt===
On 28 July 2007, it was announced that Galindo had signed a two-year contract at the German club Eintracht Frankfurt.

===Guadalajara===
On 8 January 2009, Galindo left Frankfurt to return to his native Mexico to play for Club Deportivo Guadalajara to sign a four-year contract. On 28 February 2009, Galindo scored his first goal with Chivas de Guadalajara in a 5–0 win over C.F. Pachuca in the Jalisco Stadium.

===Santos Laguna===
On 7 June 2011, Galindo signed with Santos Laguna.

===Toluca===
After seeing less action on the pitch with Santos Laguna he was loaned to Toluca on 8 July 2013, where he competes for the starting line up with Paulo Da Silva, Edgar Dueñas and Francisco Gamboa.

<doc id="1271133" wikidata="Q2028257" url="?curid=1271133" title="Colors of the Wind">
<text>&quot;Colors of the Wind&quot; is a song written by composer Alan Menken and lyricist Stephen Schwartz for Walt Disney Pictures&#x27; 33rd animated feature film, &quot;Pocahontas&quot; (1995). The film&#x27;s theme song, &quot;Colors of the Wind&quot; was originally recorded by American singer and actress Judy Kuhn in her role as the singing voice of Pocahontas. A pop ballad, the song&#x27;s lyrics are about animism and respecting nature, finding its roots in indigenous Native American culture, perspectives which have later been adopted in both transcendentalist literature and New Age spirituality. 

&quot;Colors of the Wind&quot; received a mostly positive reception from critics, with several citing it as one of the best songs from a Disney film. The song would go on to win the Academy Award for Best Original Song, the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media, and the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. American actress and singer Vanessa Williams&#x27;s version of the song, which plays during the end credits, was released as the lead single on June 6, 1995, by Walt Disney Records from the film&#x27;s soundtrack, and became a top ten hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The song was also included on the 1995 re-release of her third studio album, &quot;The Sweetest Days&quot; (1994). &quot;Colors of the Wind&quot; would also be covered by other artists, including Ashanti and Brian Wilson, and was featured on an episode of &quot;Lip Sync Battle&quot;.

==Background==

Following the death of Howard Ashman, the Walt Disney Company wanted to find another musician to collaborate with Alan Menken on his scores for animated films. Stephen Schwartz, the composer behind the Broadway theater hits &quot;Godspell&quot; (1971), &quot;Pippin&quot; (1972), and &quot;The Magic Show&quot; (1974), received a call from the company asking if he would like to collaborate with Menken. Schwartz had never considered working in the film industry, but agreed to do so nonetheless. Schwartz did not feel he was well-suited to the job.

Schwartz wanted to write a song for the film wherein Pocahontas confronts the Eurocentrism of John Smith. &quot;Colors of the Wind&quot; was the first song written for &quot;Pocahontas&quot;. According to Schwartz, the song &quot;influence[d] the development of the rest of the film.&quot; Schwartz said that &quot;a story-board outline was in place before we wrote [the track]. This is often the process in animation, at least as I&#x27;ve experienced it, where everybody works from an outline and each succeeding piece of material, whether it is a song or drawings, influences the next.&quot; The track was inspired by Native American poetry, music and folklore, as well as a now-debunked letter that Schwartz believed was sent to the United States Congress by Chief Seattle regarding humanity&#x27;s relationship with nature but was in fact a fabrication. Part of the letter reads: &quot;The wind that gave our grandfather his first breath also received his last sigh. The wind also gives our children the spirit of life. So if we sell our land, you must keep it apart and sacred, as a place where man can go to taste the wind that is sweetened by the meadow flowers.&quot; This portion of the letter inspired the song&#x27;s title, which Schwartz liked because he saw it as paradoxical and thought-provoking.

Schwartz also drew inspiration for &quot;Colors of the Wind&quot; from the music of Oscar Hammerstein II and Sheldon Harnick, as it deals with issues of prejudice. Menken said that while &quot;Colors of the Wind&quot; was &quot;born out of the modality of Native American music...it quickly moved to its own place, which is hard to define.&quot; Menken has noted that the song lacks humor, which he and Schwartz attempted to inject into &quot;Pocahontas&quot; and failed. Initially, the final lines of the song were &quot;For your life&#x27;s an empty hull/till you get it through your skull/you can paint with all the colors of the wind.&quot; Menken disapproved of these lyrics and asked Schwartz to rewrite them; Schwartz changed the lines to &quot;You can own the Earth, and still/all you&#x27;ll own is earth until/you can paint with all the colors of the wind.&quot; Schwartz preferred the altered lyrics. Schwartz said that this incident taught him the lesson: &quot;If your collaborator is unhappy, it&#x27;s probably because [the song] needs to be better,&quot; adding that he may not have won an Academy Award if he did not change the lyrics. Menken views &quot;Colors of the Wind&quot; as one of the most important songs he has written. Schwartz believed that the Walt Disney Company would reject &quot;Colors of the Wind&quot; for being philosophical and different from previous Disney songs. Judy Kuhn sang the song to help &quot;pitch&quot; Schwartz&#x27;s score to Disney, and the studio embraced the track. Schwartz and Menken became friends, and later wrote music for the Disney films &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; (1996) and &quot;Enchanted&quot; (2007) together.

==Composition and lyrics==
&quot;Colors of the Wind&quot; is a pop ballad written by Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz and performed by Judy Kuhn. It has a length of three minutes and thirty-four seconds. According to the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot;, the song does not resemble Native American music. Nonetheless, adding a twist of creative license, the sentiment of First Nation Peoples&#x27; relationship to the land and its animals, as well as the contrast between colonialist and indigenous mindsets, are strikingly well portrayed, considering the lyricist&#x27;s non-indigenous background. The song is about animism and having respect for nature. It features lyrics about &quot;painting with all the colors of the wind&quot; and listening to &quot;the voices of the mountains sing.&quot;

Justyna Fruzińska wrote in &quot;Emerson Goes to the Movies: Individualism in Walt Disney Company&#x27;s Post-1989 Animated Films&quot; that the lyrics of &quot;Colors of the Wind&quot; are reminiscent of the writings of transcendentalist Ralph Waldo Emerson and New Age spirituality. The staff of &quot;Billboard&quot; likened the lyrics of &quot;Colors of the Wind&quot; to a public service announcement about embracing diversity. Sonically, Rita Kempley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; found &quot;Colors of the Wind&quot; akin to music from Busby Berkeley films and &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; (1989).

The song also features a mention of a &quot;blue corn moon&quot;; there is no such thing according to Charisse, although in general the blue-green distinction is ambiguous in many languages. Responding to a fan inquiry, Schwartz admitted that he coined the phrase after reading a Native American love poem which read: &quot;I will come to you in the moon of green corn&quot;; Native Americans referred to months as &quot;moons&quot; and named them after events that happened seasonally, such as the sprouting of green corn. This system was subsequently appropriated by colonists, and a modified version appears in the &quot;Farmers&#x27; Almanac&quot;. Schwartz disliked the phrase &quot;green corn moon&quot; due to the sound of the word &quot;green&quot; and because he felt it might evoke the urban legend that the Moon is made of green cheese. Instead, Schwartz used the phrase &quot;blue corn moon&quot; as it reminded him of both blue moons and blue corn tortillas. Schwartz thought that the phrase might evoke the Indigenous peoples of the Southeastern Woodlands rather than the Algonquian people depicted in &quot;Pocahontas&quot;, but was satisfied with it anyway.

==International versions==
The 10th anniversary edition DVD release of the movie features a multi-language clip reel presenting the song &quot;Colors of the Wind&quot; in 11 of the 28 versions originally released for the movie, with an introduction by director Mike Gabriel.

==Reception==

Dominick Suzanne-Mayer of &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; praised the track for featuring &quot;surprisingly cutting&quot; lyrics, &quot;pointed commentary on racism, and a dynamic, soulful performance from Judy Kuhn all in one place.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; Raisa Bruner deemed &quot;Colors of the Wind&quot; one of the &quot;powerful, uplifting theme songs&quot; from the Disney Renaissance and a &quot;classic&quot;. Jordan Appugliesi of Mic ranked it the sixth best song from a Disney soundtrack, saying that it is &quot;a poignant, memorable ballad&quot; in the vein of &quot;Reflection&quot; from &quot;Mulan&quot; (1998). Rita Kempler of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; felt that the &quot;stirring anthem&quot; is the song from &quot;Pocahontas&quot; which &quot;comes closest to a show-stopper.&quot; The staff of &quot;Billboard&quot; called the song &quot;artistic&quot; and &quot;wistful&quot; and ranked it the ninth best song of the Disney Renaissance. Writing for &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot;, Hollis Chacona opined &quot;Unlike so many film composers of late, Menken knows when to keep quiet and when to let loose his powerful score. That power soars through its centerpiece (and no doubt Oscar-bound) song, &#x27;Colors of the Wind,&#x27; performed by Judy Kuhn.&quot;

Dorkys Ramos of &quot;Time Out&quot; said that the song and &quot;When You Wish Upon a Star&quot; from &quot;Pinocchio&quot; (1940) are &quot;at the top of our list when it comes to songs we don&#x27;t tire of hearing again and again.&quot; &quot;Spin&quot; Andrew Unterberger criticized the track&#x27;s &quot;patronizing&quot; portrayal of Native American beliefs, but said that &quot;man...Judy Kuhn&#x27;s voice soars, with those little trills and sweeping highs. It makes it much easier to get behind what&#x27;s ultimately an agreeable message of environmental awareness and acceptance.&quot; Aylin Zafar of BuzzFeed ranked &quot;Colors of the Wind&quot; the ninth best Disney song, commending it for &quot;encourag[ing] people to appreciate the world around them and to seek to understand others before judging them.&quot; Screen Rant&#x27;s Turner Minton viewed &quot;Colors of the Wind&quot; as the tenth best Disney song and &quot;an anthem about the harmonious nature of the shared world which embraces all races of people.&quot;

Charles Solomon of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; viewed &quot;Colors of the Wind&quot; and &quot;When She Loved Me&quot; from &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; (1999) as the only Disney songs released since Howard Ashman&#x27;s death which &quot;approached the standards&quot; of the music from &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1991) and &quot;Aladdin&quot; (1992). The staff of &quot;People&quot; said that the track is &quot;performed effectively within the body of the film by Kuhn&quot;. CollegeHumor&#x27;s Willie Muse wrote that &quot;even though &quot;Pocahontas&quot; as a whole is completely forgettable, I guarantee everyone reading this knows every single lyric of [&quot;Colors of the Wind&quot;]. Beautiful to listen to and epic in its scope, &#x27;Colors of the Wind&#x27; transcends the movie that birthed it to earn its place as an undeniable classic.&quot; Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; deemed the song &quot;heartfelt&quot; but less catchy than previous Disney songs. Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; stated that &quot;Pocahontas&quot;″ &quot;Alan Menken-Stephen Schwartz songs have all the flavor of uncooked dough&quot;. Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; criticized the song for its &quot;political correctness&quot; and for &quot;sermoniz[ing] about ecology by using pedestrian conceits&quot;.
The track won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song, and the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media.

==Vanessa Williams version==
===Background and composition===
Vanessa Williams was chosen to perform &quot;Colors of the Wind&quot; due to the success of her Grammy Award-nominated single &quot;Save the Best for Last&quot;. Williams&#x27; cover is a pop song which omits the opening lyrics of the original version of the track. The cover features Bill Miller playing the Native American flute. Scott Mendelson of &quot;Forbes&quot; wrote &quot;The practice of having what amounts to a radio-friendly pop version of a given Disney song for a new Disney movie is of course an old tradition going back at least to&quot; Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson&#x27;s cover of the title track of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1991); Mendelson noted that this practice was continued with Williams&#x27; version of &quot;Colors of the Wind&quot; and Demi Lovato&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Let It Go&quot; from &quot;Frozen&quot; (2013). According to Mendelson, Williams&#x27; cover &quot;was considered an &#x27;all is forgiven&#x27; note&quot; following the removal of her Miss America title. The cover was produced by Keith Thomas and Robbie Buchanan. It was a commercial success, reaching number four on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and reaching number two on the Adult Contemporary chart, almost close to become Williams&#x27; second single to top this chart. It was also included the 1995 re-release of her third studio album, &quot;The Sweetest Days&quot; (1994).

Williams performed a Spanish version of the song which was included as the single&#x27;s b-side. The Spanish version of the song featured in the film was sung by Mexican singer and actress Susana Zabaleta.

At the Grammy Awards in 1996, the song received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.

===Critical reception===
Raisa Bruner of &quot;Time&quot; said that Williams&#x27; rendition was &quot;performed flawlessly&quot;, adding that &quot;The powerful &quot;Pocahontas&quot; song finds the crystal-clear voice of Vanessa Williams painting a vision of 17th-century Native American life—and the importance of the environment—that still resonates with audiences today.&quot; Bruner said that the cover stood alongside Elton John&#x27;s version of &quot;Can You Feel the Love Tonight&quot; from &quot;The Lion King&quot; (1994) as one of &quot;the best radio-ready versions of Disney&#x27;s finest melodies&quot;. MTV&#x27;s Jessica Norton felt that the cover is &quot;even more magical&quot; than the original and &quot;fitting...for free-spirited &#x27;Nessa to cover.&quot; The staff of &quot;People&quot; opined that the song is &quot;not well served by the former Miss America’s pop diva turn. Indeed, her overblown interpretation seems directly at odds with the song’s message. Stay tuned to Kuhn.&quot;

American singer Tori Kelly&#x27;s rendition of the song was included on the album &quot;We Love Disney&quot; (2015). Kelly decided to cover the song because she was obsessed with &quot;Pocahontas&quot; as a child. She also sang it for &quot;The Disney Family Singalong&quot; in 2020 due to the COVID awareness. The Chipettes covered the song for the 1995 album &quot;When You Wish Upon a Chipmunk&quot;. Australian soprano Mirusia Louwerse covered &quot;Colors of the Wind&quot; for &quot;This Time Tomorrow&quot; (2016), her fourth solo album. The singer&#x27;s arrangement has been described as featuring &quot;a simple and unobtrusive accompaniment on acoustic guitar.&quot; Postmodern Jukebox, a musical collective that creates vintage-style covers of popular songs, released a cover of the song in the style of 1970s soul music. It was covered by Tori Kelly in &quot;The Disney Family Singalong&quot;. German band Tokio Hotel covered the song for the Disney pop-punk cover album &quot;A Whole New Sound&quot; (2024).

==Usage in media==
Actress Melissa McCarthy lip synced the song during an episode of &quot;Lip Sync Battle&quot;. Before lip syncing the track, McCarthy donned protective goggles. Then a high-powered wind machine blew water, stuffed animals, confetti, streamers and fake leaves at her as the song played. The performance received a standing ovation, and Jimmy Fallon deemed her the winner of the battle.

The song&#x27;s opening and closing bars are used for the jingle of Steve Wright&#x27;s Sunday Love Songs on BBC Radio 2.

<doc id="1271138" wikidata="Q404867" url="?curid=1271138" title="Yoshisuke Aikawa">
<text>was a Japanese entrepreneur, businessman, and politician, noteworthy as the founder and first president of the Nissan &quot;zaibatsu&quot; (1931–1945), one of Japan&#x27;s most powerful business conglomerates around the time of the Second World War.

==Biography==
Aikawa was born in what is now part of Yamaguchi city, Yamaguchi prefecture. His mother was the niece of Meiji period &quot;genrō&quot; Inoue Kaoru. He graduated from the engineering department of Tokyo Imperial University in 1903 and went to work for Shibaura Seisakusho, the forerunner of Toshiba.

Although his pay was very low, Aikawa managed to save enough to make a trip to the United States, where he studied malleable cast iron technology. After his return to Japan, with the backing of Inoue Kaoru and other ex-Chōshū politicians in the Diet of Japan, he established the Tobata Foundry in Kitakyūshū in 1909. The company is now known as Hitachi Kinzoku (Hitachi Metals Company Ltd).

In 1928, Aikawa became president of the Kuhara Mining Company (present day Nippon Mining &amp; Metals Company) taking over from his brother-in-law Fusanosuke Kuhara and created a holding company called Nihon Sangyo, or Nissan for short. Kuhara went on to a career in politics, forging ties with future Prime Minister Giichi Tanaka and other political and military leaders, which Aikawa would later use to his advantage.

In the stock market boom following the 1931 Manchurian Incident, Aikawa used the opportunity to buy majority shareholdings in 132 subsidiary companies of Nissan to create a new &quot;zaibatsu,&quot; the . The companies included Nissan Motors, Isuzu, NEC Corporation, Nippon Mining Holdings Company, Nissan Chemicals, Hitachi, Nichiyu Corporation, Nichirei Corporation, Nissan Marine Insurance, Nissan Mutual Life Insurance and others. The group included some of the most technologically advanced companies in Japan at the time.

In 1937, at the invitation of his relative Nobusuke Kishi, he moved to Manchukuo and agreed with the Japanese Kwantung Army&#x27;s vision of a syndicalist economy and centralized industrial development plan for Manchukuo. He also moved the headquarters of Nissan to Manchukuo, where it became the core of the Manchurian Industrial Development Company, a new Manchukuo &quot;zaibatsu&quot;.

In his position as president and chairman, Aikawa guided all industrial efforts in Manchukuo, implementing two five-year plans during the 1930s that followed the economic and industrial vision of army ideologist, Naoki Hoshino. However, Aikawa differed from Hoshino&#x27;s original conception in that he favored a more monopolistic approach. He argued that the economic state of Manchukuo was still too primitive to permit free market capitalism. Aikawa also received bank loans from American steel industrialists to support the Manchukuo economy, which created considerable controversy in the United States with its policy of Non-recognition.

However, while his economic views were in line with Imperial Japanese Army policy, his political views were not. Aikawa was a strong opponent of the Tripartite Pact, and predicted that the forces of the United Kingdom and France would eventually prevail over Nazi Germany should a general war break out. He supported the Fugu Plan, a project to settle Jewish refugees in Manchukuo. In 1942, at the instigation of the Kwantung Army, Aikawa resigned as chairman of the Manchurian Industrial Development Company and moved back to Japan.

After the surrender of Japan, Aikawa was arrested by the American occupation authorities and incarcerated in Sugamo Prison for 20 months as a Class A war crimes suspect. He was freed before his case came to trial, however, during this time, the Nissan &quot;zaibatsu&quot; was dissolved.

After his release, Aikawa played a key role in post-war economic reconstruction of Japan, and purchased a commercial bank to organize loans to small companies. He served as president of Teikoku Oil Company and of the Japan Petroleum Exploration Company, and in 1953, was elected to a seat in the House of Councilors of the Diet of Japan. With the help of Nobusuke Kishi, then prime minister, he achieved his goal in implementing economic-control law and policies as leader of the &quot;Chuseiren&quot;, a pressure group that became the main federation of small and medium-sized companies in the 1960s.

Aikawa died of acute gall bladder inflammation in 1967. His grave is at the Tama Cemetery outside Tokyo.

<text>Stephen Ailes (May 25, 1912 – June 30, 2001) was a prominent member of the District of Columbia Bar and a partner in the firm of Steptoe &amp; Johnson. He served as the United States Under Secretary of the Army from February 9, 1961, to January 28, 1964, and as United States Secretary of the Army from January 28, 1964, to July 1, 1965. He received his undergraduate education at Princeton University, and attended the law school of West Virginia University, where he was a member of Phi Kappa Psi fraternity.

==Early life and education==
Ailes was born in Romney, West Virginia, on May 25, 1912. He attended the Scarborough School in New York with his brother, and later attended Episcopal High School in Alexandria, Virginia and graduated in 1929. He graduated from Princeton University in 1933 and received his law degree from West Virginia University in 1936. He was admitted to the West Virginia bar in 1936.

==Legal career==
He was appointed assistant professor of law at West Virginia University, 1937–1940. He was prevented from military service due to color blindness; but later he was hired at the Office of Price Administration in 1942 until 1946. He served as counsel to the American Economic Mission to Greece in 1947, and then returned to private practice at Steptoe &amp; Johnson in 1948; beforce entering government services.

==Government career==
Ailes served as Under Secretary of the Army, February 9, 1961, until January 28, 1964, and he was then promoted to Secretary of the Army until July 1, 1965. He is often credited as the driving force for the creation of the United States Army Drill Sergeant program. He conducted a far-reaching survey over time that included a wide variety of experienced personnel across all the services and the results contained five principal findings, with appropriate recommendations and suggestions for eliminating the problems encountered. The Training and Doctrine Command&#x27;s annual Drill Sergeant of the Year award is named after Ailes.

Ailes came under heavy criticism by both Democrats and Republicans in early 1965 when he sought funding from a U.S. Senate appropriations subcommittee for what was quickly derided as the &quot;Instant Veteran Program&quot;. As critics summarized the Ailes proposal, up to &quot;8,000 young men incapable of meeting the minimum physical and mental requirements for military service&quot; would be still be inducted into the U.S. and &quot;could serve one day and then be discharged as a veteran, eligible for veterans&#x27; benefits available to service men who had completed long periods in uniform.&quot; Ailes testified that the plan (which the subcommittee declined to endorse) would cost $31,300,000 in its first year in 1965 dollars, the equivalent of $235 million fifty years later.

From 1965 to 1970, Ailes was head of the Federal City Council, a group of business, civic, education, and other leaders interested in economic development in Washington, D.C.

==Personal life==
Ailes married Helen &#x27;Nellie&#x27; Wales on June 24, 1939. and had four children. He died on June 30, 2001, from a stroke at his home in Bethesda, Maryland. He is buried in his home town of Romney at Indian Mound Cemetery.

<text>Yasushi Akashi (明石 康 &quot;Akashi Yasushi&quot;, born January 19, 1931) is a Japanese senior diplomat and United Nations administrator.

== Overview ==

Akashi graduated with Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Tokyo in 1954, studied as a Fulbright Scholar at the University of Virginia, and later at The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. As a politically appointed International Civil Servant at the Headquarters of the United Nations Secretariat in New York City, he held positions as Under-Secretary-General of Public Information, Under-Secretary-General for Disarmament Affairs and Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator.

Among many other additional assignments, he was the Secretary-General&#x27;s Personal Representative for the war in the former Yugoslavia. He also supervised the Cambodian peace negotiations and subsequent elections in 1993. Despite his successes there, he was strongly criticized for his subsequent role in the Balkans, particularly for failing to enforce the safety of civilians in a number of safe zones, such as Goražde, and his inability to prevent the massacre in Srebrenica.

Akashi was expected to visit Sri Lanka in the last week of September 2006 to help facilitate negotiations between the Tamil Tigers and the Sri Lankan government. In the past, Akashi has met with JVP official Somawansa Amarasinghe.

He ran for Governor of Tokyo in the election of 1999 with the support of the Liberal Democratic Party and New Komeito coalition, but came in fourth place.

==Honors==
*Honorary citizen of Sochi, Russia (1989).
*Eminent member of the Sergio Vieira de Mello Foundation.
*Sri Lanka Rathna award, Sri Lanka - August 19, 2019.

<text>The United States Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (abbreviated as FFDCA, FDCA, or FD&amp;C) is a set of laws passed by the United States Congress in 1938 giving authority to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to oversee the safety of food, drugs, medical devices, and cosmetics. The FDA&#x27;s principal representative with members of congress during its drafting was Charles W. Crawford. A principal author of this law was Royal S. Copeland, a three-term U.S. senator from New York. In 1968, the Electronic Product Radiation Control provisions were added to the FD&amp;C. Also in that year the FDA formed the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation (DESI) to incorporate into FD&amp;C regulations the recommendations from a National Academy of Sciences investigation of effectiveness of previously marketed drugs. The act has been amended many times, most recently to add requirements about bioterrorism preparations.

The introduction of this act was influenced by the death of more than 100 patients due to elixir sulfanilamide, a sulfanilamide medication where the toxic solvent diethylene glycol was used to dissolve the drug and make a liquid form. It replaced the earlier Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906.

== Contents ==

The FDC Act has ten chapters:
:I. Short Title
:II. Definitions
::* 201(f) is the definition for a food, which explicitly includes chewing gum
::* 201(g) is the definition for a drug
::* 201(h) is the definition for a medical device
::* 201(s) is the definition of a food additive
::* 201(ff) is the definition of a dietary supplement
:III. Prohibited Acts and Penalties
::This section contains both civil law and criminal law clauses. Most violations under the act are civil, though repeated, intentional, and fraudulent violations are covered as criminal law. All violations of the FD&amp;C Act require interstate commerce because of the commerce clause, but this is often interpreted broadly and few products other than raw produce are considered outside of the scope of the act.
::Notably, the FD&amp;C Act uses strict liability due to the Dotterweich and Park Supreme Court cases. It is one of a very small number of criminal statutes that does.
:IV. Food
::There is a distinction in food adulteration between those that are added and those that are naturally present. Substances that are added are held to a stricter &quot;may render (it) injurious to health&quot; standard, whereas substances that are naturally present need only be at a level that &quot;does not ordinarily render it injurious to health&quot;
:V. Drugs and Devices
::* 505 is the description of the drug approval process
::* 510(k) is the section that allows for clearance of class II medical devices
::* 515 is the description of the (class III) device approval process
:VI. Cosmetics
:VII. General Authority
::* 704 allows inspections of regulated entities. Inspection results are reported on Form 483.
:VIII. Imports and Exports
:IX. Tobacco Products
:X. Miscellaneous

== Food coloring ==
The FD&amp;C Act is perhaps best known to consumers because of its use in the naming of food coloring additives, such as &quot;FD&amp;C Yellow No. 6&quot;. The Act made the certification of some food color additives mandatory. The FDA lists nine FD&amp;C (Food, Drugs &amp; Cosmetics) certified color additives for use in foods in the United States, and numerous D&amp;C (Drugs &amp; Cosmetics) colorings allowed only in drugs for external application or cosmetics. Color additives derived from natural sources, such as vegetables, minerals or animals, and artificial counterparts of natural derivatives, are exempt from certification. Both artificial and naturally derived color additives are subject to rigorous standards of safety before their approval for use in foods.

=== Certifiable colors ===
== Food additives ==
The FFDCA requires producers of food additives to demonstrate to a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from the intended use of an additive. If the FDA finds an additive to be safe the agency issues a regulation specifying the conditions under which the additive may be safely used.

=== Definition of food additive ===
A shortened definition of &quot;food additive&quot; is defined by the FDA as &quot;any substance the intended use of which results or may reasonably be expected to result, directly or indirectly, in its becoming a component or otherwise affecting the characteristic of any food (including any substance intended for use in producing, manufacturing, packing, processing, preparing, treating, packaging, transporting, or holding food; and including any source of radiation intended for any such use); if such substance is not GRAS or sanctioned prior to 1958 or otherwise excluded from the definition of food additives.&quot; The full definition can be found in Section 201(s) of the FD&amp;C Act, which provides for any additional exclusions.

== Homeopathic medications ==
Homeopathic preparations are regulated and protected under Sections 201(g) and 201(j), provided that such medications are formulated from substances listed in the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States, which the Act recognizes as an official drug compendium.

However, under separate authority of FTC Act, the Federal Trade Commission declared in November 2016 that homeopathic products cannot include claims of effectiveness without &quot;competent and reliable scientific evidence&quot;. If no such evidence exists, they must state this fact clearly on their labeling.

== Bottled water ==
Bottled water is regulated by the FDA as a food. The Agency has published identity standards for types of water (mineral water, spring water), and regulations covering water processing and bottling, water quality and product labeling.

== Cosmetics ==
This Act defines cosmetics as &quot;articles intended to be rubbed, poured, sprinkled, or sprayed on, introduced into, or otherwise applied to the human body ... for cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness, or altering the appearance.&quot; Under the Act, the FDA does not approve cosmetic products, but the Act prohibits the marketing of adulterated or misbranded cosmetics. However, the FDA does not have the authority to order recalls of cosmetics. If a company is selling a product that is adulterated or misbranded, the FDA can ask the company to recall their product or sue them. The FDA can and does inspect cosmetics manufacturing facilities to ensure that cosmetics are not adulterated.

== Medical devices ==

On May 28, 1976, the FD&amp;C Act was amended to include regulation for medical devices. The amendment required that all medical devices be classified into one of three classes:
* Class I: Devices that do not require premarket approval or clearance but must follow general controls. Dental floss is a class I device.
* Class II: Devices that are cleared using the 510(k) process. Diagnostic tests, cardiac catheters, hearing aids, and dental amalgams are examples of class II devices.
* Class III: Devices that are approved by the premarket approval (PMA) process, analogous to a New Drug Application. These tend to be devices that are permanently implanted into a human body or may be necessary to sustain life. An artificial heart meets both criteria. The most commonly recognized class III device is an automated external defibrillator. Devices that do not meet either criterion are generally cleared as class II devices.

For devices that were marketed prior to the amendment (preamendment devices) and were classified as Class III, the amendment obligated the FDA to review the device to either reclassify it as a Class II device subject to premarket notification, or to require the device manufacturer to undergo the premarket authorization process and prove the safety and efficacy of the device in order to continue marketing it. Notable examples of such preamendment devices are those used for electroconvulsive therapy, which the FDA started reviewing in 2011.

=== Premarket notification (510(k), PMN) ===

Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act requires those device manufacturers who must register to notify FDA, at least 90 days in advance, of their intent to market a medical device.

This is known as premarket notification, PMN, or 510(k). It allows FDA to determine whether the device is equivalent to a device already placed into one of the three classification categories. Thus, &quot;new&quot; devices (not in commercial distribution prior to May 28, 1976) that have not been classified can be properly identified.

Any device that reaches market via a 510(k) notification must be &quot;substantially equivalent&quot; to a device on the market prior to May 28, 1976 (a &quot;predicate device&quot;). If a device being submitted is significantly different, relative to a pre-1976 device, in terms of design, material, chemical composition, energy source, manufacturing process, or intended use, the device nominally must go through a premarket approval, or PMA.

A device that reaches market via the 510(k) process is not considered to be &quot;approved&quot; by the FDA. Nevertheless, it can be marketed and sold in the United States. They are generally referred to as &quot;cleared&quot; or &quot;510(k) cleared&quot; devices.

A 2011 study by Diana Zuckerman and Paul Brown of the National Research Center for Women and Families, and Steven Nissen of the Cleveland Clinic, published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, showed that most medical devices recalled in the last five years for &quot;serious health problems or death&quot; had been previously cleared by the FDA using the less stringent, and cheaper, 510(k) process. In a few cases the devices had been deemed so low-risk that they did not need FDA regulation. Of the 113 devices recalled, 35 were for cardiovascular issues. This may lead to a reevaluation of FDA procedures and better oversight.

=== Premarket approval (PMA) ===

Premarket approval (PMA) is the most stringent type of device marketing application required by FDA. Unlike the 510(k) pathway, the maker of the medical device must submit an application to the FDA and must receive approval prior to marketing the device.

The PMA application contains information about how the medical device was designed and how it is manufactured, as well as preclinical and clinical studies of the device, demonstrating that it is safe and effective for its intended use. Because the PMA requires a clinical trial it is significantly more expensive than a 510(k).

===Automatic Class III designation (&quot;de novo&quot; classification)===
The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 created section 513(f)(2) of the FD&amp;C Act, which obligated the FDA to establish a risk-based regulatory system for medical devices. As a result, the FDA established a &quot;de novo&quot; pathway for devices that would automatically be classified as Class III because there was no already-existing device that could be used a predicate for a 510k submission, but for which general controls or general and special controls could provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.

<doc id="1271175" wikidata="Q1700049" url="?curid=1271175" title="John Fellows Akers">
<text>John Fellows Akers (December 28, 1934 – August 22, 2014) was an American businessman. He was president (1983–1989), chief executive officer (1985–1993) and chairman (1986–1993) of IBM.

==Education==
Akers attended Yale, and while there joined Delta Kappa Epsilon (Phi chapter).

==IBM==

Akers joined IBM in 1960 after serving in the Navy as a jet pilot.

Akers said in 2010 “We were very square. We wore the blue suits, white shirts with button-down collars, striped ties, fedoras and wingtip shoes. The customers felt they could count on us.”

Akers became CEO in 1985. He benefitted from the support of one of his predecessors, Frank Cary. In 1989, a young Sam Palmisano was appointed as Aker&#x27;s assistant; decades later Palmisano would serve as chairman and CEO. Akers was chief executive during IBM&#x27;s decline in the mid-1980s and early 1990s. Apple Inc. founder Steve Jobs described Akers as &quot;&quot;smart, eloquent, fantastic salesperson, but he didn’t know anything about product.&quot;”

Akers was credited with simplifying the company&#x27;s bureaucracy to focus more on profits. On January 29, 1988, in a sweeping restructuring intended to reverse three years of disappointing performance, Akers created five new, highly autonomous organizations responsible for all of the company&#x27;s innovation, design, and manufacturing. The moves were intended to greatly decentralize the company, which had been seen as bloated and unable to keep up with the competition and give significantly more responsibility to a younger generation of managers, while significantly reducing the role of the company&#x27;s Armonk, N.Y., headquarters in the day-to-day operations. Under the plan, thousands of employees had to switch jobs or find themselves working for new managers. Akers&#x27; vision was to autonomize each division into &quot;Baby Blues&quot; with the aim of spinning them off from &quot;Big Blue&quot;.

Akers also presided over a major downsizing of IBM&#x27;s workforce, cutting down from 407,000 to 360,000 by the end of 1991. The company had previously had a lifetime employment policy but successive voluntary buyouts and the first-ever layoff in March 1993, caused a morale crisis. Akers also closed ten plants and trimmed manufacturing capacity by forty percent.

===Retirement===
On Tuesday, January 26, 1993, Akers was forced to announce his resignation, after several months of IBM insisting that it had full confidence in his leadership. The company had posted a $5 billion annual loss. The dividend was also slashed from $1.21 to 54 cents, after the company had failed to make enough profit to cover its dividend payments for eight business quarters. IBM president Jack Kuehler was shifted to the post of vice-chairman, while finance director Frank Metz was also ousted. Paul Rizzo, a rival with Akers for the CEO position back in 1985 who had retired in 1987 was restored to the post of vice-chairman and appointed finance director. Akers remained as chief executive for three months while a committee of directors chose a successor, long speculated to be an outsider. Akers retired as chairman and CEO of IBM on April 1, 1993. He was succeeded in both positions by Gerstner, the first CEO in IBM&#x27;s history to attain the position from outside the company.

The management coup was mounted by longtime IBM director Jim Burke, who organized secret meetings between Rizzo and outsider Louis V. Gerstner, Jr. to examine the company&#x27;s problems. It was also speculated that several entities were dissatisfied with losing their power on the board of directors and the declining stock price, including the banks which were once IBM&#x27;s largest shareholders, as well as Aker&#x27;s predecessors as CEO, John Opel and Frank Cary. The company&#x27;s difficulties weren&#x27;t caused by Akers alone, as some suggested that he was merely doing what he had been &quot;programmed&quot; to do by an outdated &quot;IBM system&quot;, while a complacent board of directors was also blamed.

==Other business roles==
Akers was on the board of directors of Lehman Brothers when it filed for bankruptcy.

==Personal==
Akers died of a stroke at age 79 in Boston, Massachusetts on August 22, 2014.

<text>George Edward Akerson (September 5, 1889 – December 21, 1937) was an American journalist and the first official White House Press Secretary.

==Early life==

Akerson was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He attended the University of Minnesota and Allegheny College, taking classes in Science, Literature and Art. In 1910 Akerson started at Harvard University, later receiving a BA in Political Science in 1912.

Akerson married Harriet Blake, a Wellesley College graduate, on June 28, 1915. They had three sons.
==Early career==
During his collegiate years, Akerson worked summers at the Minneapolis Tribune. After graduating from Harvard, Akerson worked there full-time as a reporter, with the 1912 Democratic National Convention as one of his first assignments. The &quot;Tribune&quot; made Akerson its Washington correspondent in 1921.

While in Washington in the 1920s, Akerson advised the Republican Party on how to compete with the rising Non-Partisan League and Progressive movements in the Upper Midwest. That work brought Akerson to the attention of Herbert Hoover, who was then the Secretary of Commerce. Hoover had Akerson named as the secretary of the commission that ran the 1926 Sesquicentennial Exposition in Philadelphia, then hired Akerson as his private secretary.

==White House Press Secretary==
After Hoover&#x27;s victory over Smith, Akerson served as White House Press Secretary, from 1929 to 1931, the first official holder of that title.

During Akerson&#x27;s tenure, the White House experienced increasing difficulties in its relations with the press corps.

On January 2, 1931, Akerson resigned to take an executive position at the Paramount Famous Lasky Corporation. Hoover replaced him with Theodore Goldsmith Joslin.

==Later career and death==
Akerson worked at Paramount for two years, then became the executive secretary of the National Code Authority of the Paper Distributing Trade.

Still aged in his 40s, Akerson developed kidney disease and died in 1937.

<doc id="1271197" wikidata="Q705865" url="?curid=1271197" title="Paul D. MacLean">
<text>Paul Donald MacLean (May 1, 1913 – December 26, 2007) was an American physician and neuroscientist who made significant contributions in the fields of physiology, psychiatry, and brain research through his work at Yale Medical School and the National Institute of Mental Health. MacLean&#x27;s evolutionary triune brain theory proposed that the human brain was in reality three brains in one: the reptilian complex, the limbic system, and the neocortex.

==Biography==
Paul D. MacLean was born in Phelps, New York, the third of four sons of a Presbyterian minister. He received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in English from Yale University in 1935 and intended to study philosophy at the University of Edinburgh, but after a family illness, spent a year completing pre-medical work in Edinburgh instead. MacLean received his medical degree from Yale in 1940.

During World War II, MacLean served as a medical officer in the United States Army from 1942 to 1946. During his service with Yale&#x27;s 39th General Hospital Brigade in New Zealand, MacLean worked together with Dr. Averill Liebow to show that the diphtheria bacillus was a cause of tropical ulcers, paving the way for successful prophylaxis and treatment.

After leaving the Army in 1946, MacLean practiced medicine in Seattle, and held a clinical appointment at the University of Washington Medical School. From 1947 to 1949, MacLean was a United States Public Health Service Fellow at Harvard Medical School/Massachusetts General Hospital, studying with Dr. Stanley Cobb. During this time, MacLean did research on psychomotor epilepsy, and published his paper on the &quot;visceral brain&quot;, for which he introduced the term &quot;limbic system&quot; in 1952).

In 1949, MacLean joined the faculty of the Yale Medical School with a joint appointment in physiology and psychiatry. During his time at Yale, he also studied the brain mechanisms of emotion with Dr. John Fulton. It was during this period that MacLean began to define his theory of the triune brain which would become the foundation of his research throughout his career.

In 1956, MacLean became associate professor of physiology. He spent a year on a National Science Foundation Senior Postdoctoral Fellowship at the Institute of Physiology in Zürich, Switzerland.

In 1957, MacLean went to the National Institutes of Health as the head of a new section on the limbic system in the Laboratory of Neurophysiology, National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). MacLean received the Distinguished Research Award of the Association for Research in Nervous and Mental Disease in 1964, and in 1966 gave the Thomas William Salmon Lectures at the New York Academy of Medicine. MacLean also received the G. Burroughs Mider Lectureship Award from the NIH in 1972.

In 1971 MacLean became the Chief of the Laboratory of Brain Evolution and Behavior, NIMH, newly opened in Poolesville, Maryland. MacLean was chief of the Laboratory of Brain Evolution and Behavior from 1971 to 1985. The laboratory was designed for comparative neurobehavioral research on animals in semi-natural conditions. MacLean retired with the NIH honor of senior research scientist, emeritus in the Department of Neurophysiology at NIMH.

MacLean&#x27;s ideas were popular among popular authors such as Carl Sagan and Arthur Koestler.

Correspondence, photographs, research materials, reports, writings, and audiovisual materials (1936; 1944-1993) held by the National Library of Medicine document the official portion of MacLean&#x27;s career in brain and behavioral research. He died in Potomac, Maryland, on December 26, 2007.

<text>Edward Akufo-Addo (26 June 1906 – 17 July 1979) was a Ghanaian politician and lawyer. He was a member of the &quot;Big Six&quot; leaders of the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC) and one of the founding fathers of Ghana who engaged in the fight for Ghana&#x27;s independence. He became the Chief Justice (1966–70), and later ceremonial President (1970–72), of the Republic of Ghana. He is the father of the former (executive) President of Ghana, Nana Addo Akufo-Addo.

==Early life and education==
Akufo-Addo was born on 26 June 1906 at Dodowa in the Greater Accra Region to William Martin Addo-Danquah and Theodora Amuafi. Both of his parents were from the southern Ghanaian town of Akropong. He had his primary education at Presbyterian Primary and Middle Schools at Akropong. He continued to Presbyterian Training College, Akropong and Abetifi Theological Training College. In 1929, he entered Achimota College, where he won a scholarship to St Peter&#x27;s College, Oxford. He studied mathematics, Politics and Philosophy and he went on to graduate with honours in philosophy and politics in 1933.

==Pre-political career==
Akufo-Addo was called to the Middle Temple Bar, London, UK, in 1940 and returned to what was then the Gold Coast to start a private legal practice a year later in Accra.

==Early political career==
In 1947, he became a founding member of the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC) and was one of the &quot;Big Six&quot; (the others being Ebenezer Ako-Adjei, Joseph Boakye Danquah, Kwame Nkrumah, Emmanuel Obetsebi-Lamptey and William Ofori Atta) detained after disturbances in Accra in 1948. From 1949 to 1950, he was a member of the Gold Coast Legislative Council and the Coussey Constitutional Commission.

==Post-independence career==
After independence (1962–64), Akufo-Addo was a Supreme Court Judge, one of three judges who sat on the treason trial involving Tawia Adamafio, Ako Adjei and three others after the Kulungugu bomb attack on President Kwame Nkrumah and for doing so was dismissed with fellow judges for finding some of the accused not guilty.

From 1966 to 1970, Akufo-Addo was appointed Chief Justice by the National Liberation Council (NLC) regime, as well as Chairman of the Constitutional Commission (which drafted the 1969 Second Republican Constitution). He was also head of the NLC Political Commission during this same time period.

From 31 August 1970 until his deposition by coup d&#x27;état on 13 January 1972, Akufo-Addo was President of Ghana in the Second Republic. Real power rested with the prime minister, Dr Kofi Abrefa Busia. On 17 July 1979, Akufo-Addo died of natural causes.

== Personal life ==
Adeline Yeboakwa Akufo-Addo was the wife of Edward Akufo-Addo and they had four children. 

==Awards and honors==
*Honorary Doctorate from the University of Oxford in 1971.

<doc id="1271199" wikidata="Q609602" url="?curid=1271199" title="Gweek">
<text>Gweek (, meaning &quot;forest village&quot;) is a civil parish and village in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. It is situated approximately three miles (5 km) east of Helston. The civil parish was created from part of the parish of Constantine by boundary revision in 1986. The name &quot;Gweek&quot; is first recorded as &quot;Gwyk&quot; in 1358 and is derived from the Cornish word &quot;gwig&quot;, meaning &quot;forest village&quot;, cognate with the Welsh &quot;gwig&quot; and Old Breton &quot;guic&quot;. Gweek village has a pub, the &quot;Black Swan&quot;, and a combined shop and post office. The village is also home to the Cornish Seal Sanctuary.

Gweek lies within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). Almost a third of Cornwall has AONB designation, with the same status and protection as a National Park.

==History==
Gweek is at the head of navigation of the Helford River. It has been a port since Roman times and thrived in the Tudor period, with its own Customs House. In the 13th century, the townspeople of Helston bought the rights to the port of Gweek.

During the mining boom, a tin-smelting blowing house operated at the quayside.

In Lewis&#x27;s &quot;Topographical Dictionary of England&quot; published in 1848, the village was described as:
&quot;GWEEK, a small port, in the hundred of Kerrier, W. division of Cornwall, 3½ miles (E. by S.) from Helston. The pilchard-fishery is carried on extensively, 200 boats being employed in taking the fish, which are cured in the various creeks and coves within the limits of the port. In addition to the fishery, the chief trade consists in the exportation of copper-ore, corn, moorstone, and oysters, and the importation of timber, coal, and limestone.&quot; 

In an August 1880 edition of The Cornishman newspaper, Gweek (along with Porthleven) was described as a prominent seaport, supplying coal, lime, timber, slate, etc to the neighbouring mines and inhabitants. Timber was unloaded from ships at Merthen Hole and floated up-river to Gweek on barges. The western wharf was owned by Mr Basset of Tehidy.

==Musical activities==
Gweek has a silver band which performs locally and provides music at some Anglican services in the Gweek Mission Church. The band also organises a yearly &quot;band week&quot;. This starts with a concert of three local brass bands in a field overlooking the Helford River. Afterwards, there is a pig roast with stalls and entertainment and at the end of the week a clay pigeon shoot.

The Cornwall Fiddle Orchestra was formed in 2007 by fiddle player Hudson Swan. He was a member of Scottish band, The Tannahill Weavers but now lives in Cornwall and works as a violin teacher for the Cornwall Music Service. The orchestra rehearses weekly at Helston School.

==Antiquities==

The three-cornered Tolvan Holed Stone is an unusual megalith. It is about 800 metres north of Gweek behind Tolvan Cross Farm.

==In literature==
Gweek is featured in &quot;The Meaning of Liff&quot;, a book by Douglas Adams and John Lloyd, being used as a noun meaning &quot;A coat hanger recycled as a car aerial&quot;. A passage in Charles Kingsley&#x27;s novel &quot;Hereward the Wake&quot; features Gweek and its neighbouring woods. Kingsley received some of his education at nearby Helston Grammar School.

<text>Abraham Geiger (Hebrew: &quot;ʼAvrāhām Gayger&quot;; 24 May 181023 October 1874) was a German rabbi and scholar who is considered the founding father of Reform Judaism and the academic field of Quranic studies. Emphasizing Judaism&#x27;s constant development through its history and universalist traits, Geiger sought to re-formulate received forms and design what he regarded as a religion compliant with modern times.

==Biography==
As a child, Geiger started doubting the traditional understanding of Judaism when his studies in classical history seemed to contradict the biblical claims of divine authority. At the age of seventeen, he began writing his first work, a comparison between the legal style of the Mishnah and Biblical and Talmudic law. He also worked on a dictionary of Mishnaic (Rabbinic) Hebrew.

Geiger&#x27;s friends provided him with financial assistance which enabled him to attend the University in Heidelberg, to the great disappointment of his family. His main focus was centered on the areas of philology, Syriac, Hebrew, and classics, but he also attended lectures in philosophy and archaeology. After one semester, he transferred to the University of Bonn, where he studied at the same time as Samson Raphael Hirsch. Hirsch initially formed a friendship with Geiger, and with him organized a society of Jewish students for the stated purpose of practicing homiletics, but with the deeper intention of bringing them closer to Jewish values. It was to this society that Geiger preached his first sermon (January 2, 1830). In later years, he and Hirsch became bitter opponents as the leaders of two opposing Jewish movements.

At Bonn, Geiger began an intense study of Arabic and the Koran, winning a prize for his essay, written originally in Latin, and later published in German under the title &quot;Was hat Mohammed aus dem Judenthume aufgenommen?&quot; (&quot;What did Mohammed take from Judaism?&quot;). The essay earned Geiger a doctorate at the University of Marburg. It demonstrated that large parts of the Koran were taken from, or based on, rabbinic literature. 
This book was Geiger&#x27;s first step in a much larger intellectual project. Geiger sought to demonstrate Judaism&#x27;s central influence on Christianity and Islam. He believed that neither movement possessed religious originality, but were simply a vehicle to transmit the Jewish monotheistic belief to the pagan world.
At this time, no university professorships were available in Germany to Jews; so, Geiger was forced to seek a position as rabbi. He found a position in the Jewish community of Wiesbaden (1832–1837). There, he continued his academic publications primarily through the scholarly journals he founded and edited, including &quot;Wissenschaftliche Zeitschrift für jüdische Theologie&quot; (1835–1839) and &quot;Jüdische Zeitschrift für Wissenschaft und Leben&quot; (1862–1875). His journals became important vehicles in their day for publishing Jewish scholarship, chiefly historical and theological studies, as well as a discussion of contemporary events.

By that time, Geiger had begun his program of religious reforms, chiefly in the synagogue liturgy. For example, he abolished the prayers of mourning for the Temple, believing that since Jews were German citizens, such prayers would appear to be disloyal to the ruling power and could possibly spark anti-Semitism. Geiger was the driving force in convening several synods of reform-minded rabbis with the intention of formulating a program of progressive Judaism. However, unlike Samuel Holdheim, he did not want to create a separate community. Rather, his goal was to change Judaism from within.

==Reformer==

In the Germany of the 19th century, Geiger and Samuel Holdheim, along with Israel Jacobson and Leopold Zunz, stood out as the founding fathers of Reform Judaism.
Geiger was a more moderate and scholarly reformer, seeking to found this new branch of Judaism on the scientific study of history, without assuming that any Jewish text was divinely written.

Geiger was not only a scholar and researcher commenting on important subjects and characters in Jewish history – he was also a rabbi responsible for much of the reform doctrine of the mid-19th century. He contributed much of the character to the reform movement that remains today.
Reform historian Michael A. Meyer has stated that, if any one person can be called the founder of Reform Judaism, it must be Geiger.

Much of Geiger&#x27;s writing has been translated into English from the original German. There have been many biographical and research texts about him, such as the work &quot;Abraham Geiger and the Jewish Jesus&quot; by Susannah Heschel (1998), which chronicles Geiger&#x27;s radical contention that the &quot;New Testament&quot; illustrates Jesus was a Pharisee teaching Judaism.

Some of Geiger&#x27;s studies are included in &quot;The Origins of The Koran: Classic Essays on Islam&#x27;s Holy Book&quot; edited by Ibn Warraq. Other works are &quot;Judaism and Islam&quot; (1833), and &quot;An Appeal to My Community&quot; (1842).

==Criticism==
Samson Raphael Hirsch devoted a good many issues of his journal &quot;Jeschurun&quot; to criticizing Geiger&#x27;s reform stance (published in English as &quot;Hirsch, Collected Writings&quot;).

Some critics also attacked Geiger&#x27;s opposition to a Jewish national identity; most notably, he was criticized when he refused to intervene during the Damascus affair, a blood libel, in 1840. However, Jewish historian Steven Bayme has concluded that Geiger had actually vigorously protested on humanitarian grounds.

==Geiger and Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform Judaism==

===Geiger&#x27;s rejection of Orthodox Judaism===
To Geiger, Judaism was unique because of its monotheism and ethics. He began to identify less with the &quot;rigidity of Talmudic legalism, developed over centuries of ghettoization inflicted by Christian Intolerance ... in medieval Christendom&quot;, that defined and confined the existence of Orthodox Judaism in the 19th century in Germany. He believed that, &quot;the Torah, as well as the Talmud, should be studied critically and from the point of view of the historian, that of evolution [and] development&quot;. As Geiger grew into his adolescence and young adulthood, he began to establish a more liberal approach to, and understanding of, Judaism than his traditional Orthodox Jewish background dictated. He thus rejected Orthodox Jewish tradition in favor of a liberal outlook.

===Conservative Judaism&#x27;s rejection of Geiger===
In 1837, Geiger arranged a meeting of reform-minded rabbis in Wiesbaden for the purpose of discussing measures of concern to Judaism, and continued to be a leader of liberal German rabbinical thought through 1846. When he was nominated as a finalist for the position of Chief Rabbi in Breslau in 1838, it ignited a heated controversy between conservative and liberal factions within the Jewish community. Orthodox factions accused Geiger of being a Karaite or Sadducee, and therefore prevented him from being appointed Chief Rabbi. In 1840, however, the Orthodox Rabbi of Breslau died, leading to the secession of the Orthodox faction and the appointment of Geiger as Chief Rabbi.

Throughout his time in Breslau as Chief Rabbi and after, the Positive-Historical School of Rabbi Zecharias Frankel continued to reject Geiger&#x27;s philosophies. In 1841, he and Frankel clashed at the second Hamburg Temple dispute. When the Jewish Theological Seminary was founded there in 1854, thanks in part to Geiger&#x27;s efforts, he was not appointed to its faculty, though he had long been at the forefront of attempts to establish a faculty of Jewish theology. More conservatives regarded Geiger&#x27;s theological stance as too liberal. Therefore, in 1863, Geiger left Breslau to become a Rabbi of liberal communities in Frankfurt and, later, Berlin. &quot;Ultimately, in 1871, he was appointed to the faculty of the newly founded Reform rabbinical college in Berlin, Hochschule für die Wissenschaft des Judentums, where he spent his final years.&quot;

===A new approach to Reform Judaism===
Initially, Reform Judaism grew out of some Jews being uninterested in the &quot;strict observances required of Orthodoxy&quot;, and an attempt to alter the appearance and ritual of Judaism to mimic German Protestantism. Geiger, however, turned to a more &quot;coherent ideological framework to justify innovations in the liturgy and religious practice&quot;. Geiger argued that, &quot;Reform Judaism was not a rejection of earlier Judaism, but a recovery of the Pharisaic halakhic tradition, which is nothing other than the principle of continual further development in accord with the times, the principle of not being slaves to the letter of the Bible, but rather to witness over and over its spirit and its authentic faith-consciousness.&quot;

<doc id="1271206" wikidata="Q732026" url="?curid=1271206" title="Alamgir II">
<text>Mirza Aziz-ud-Din Muhammad (June 6, 1699 – November 29, 1759), better known by his regnal name Alamgir II, was the fifteenth Mughal emperor from 1754 to 1759. He was the son of Jahandar Shah.

Born Mirza Aziz-ud-Din, the second son of Jahandar Shah, was raised to the throne by Imad-ul-Mulk after he deposed Ahmad Shah Bahadur in 1754. On ascending the throne, he took the title of Alamgir and tried to follow the approach of Aurangzeb (Alamgir I). At the time of his accession to the throne he was 55 years old. He had no experience of administration and warfare as he had spent most of his life in jail. He was a weak ruler, with all powers vested in the hand of his vizier, Imad-ul-Mulk.

In 1756, Ahmad Shah Durrani invaded India once again and captured Delhi and plundered Mathura. While the Marathas became more powerful because of their collaboration with Imad-ul-Mulk, and dominated the whole of northern India. This was the peak of the Maratha expansion, which caused great trouble for the Mughal Empire, already weak with no strong ruler. Relations between Alamgir II and his usurping vizier, Imad-ul-Mulk had now deteriorated, their troubled relation would culminate in the murder of Alamgir by Imad-ul-Mulk. Alamgir II&#x27;s son Ali Gauhar escaped persecution from Delhi, while Shah Jahan III was placed on the throne.

==Early life==
Alamgir II was born Aziz-ud-Din on 6 June 1699 at Burhanpur and was the second son of Muizz-ud-Din, who himself was the son of Bahadur Shah (Shah Alam). So, Aurangzeb was his great-grandfather. His mother was a jat, Anup Bai, with little clarity about her existence.

Aziz-ud-Din was 7 when his great-grandfather Aurangzeb died in the Deccan. After the death of his grandfather Bahadur Shah I in 1712 the war of succession followed. In these wars his father Jahandar Shah was defeated by the next Mughal Emperor, Farrukhsiyar who reigned till 1719.

Aziz-ud-Din was then imprisoned in 1714 by Asaf Jah I under the ruler Farrukhsiyar. From 1714 to 1754 he was in captivity. After death of Ahmad Shah Bahadur, he was released in 1754 by the usurping Vizier Ghazi ud-Din Khan Feroze Jung III. He perceived Aziz-ud-Din as a frail personality who would not object to his regime. Therefore, on 2 June 1754, Aziz-ud-Din was given the title &quot;Alamgir II&quot; by the vizier out of his own recommendation, as he wanted to follow the centralized approach of Aurangzeb.

==Succession to throne==

Imad-ul-Mulk hired Maratha mercenaries to do his bidding and put all the imperial revenues into his own pocket and starved Alamgir II&#x27;s family. He also persecuted Ali Gauhar, the elder son of Alamgir II.

Since then, relations between Alamgir II and Imad-ul-Mulk&#x27;s regime were so bad that the latter got him assassinated in November 1759.

==Reign==
After the emergence of Alamgir II the Mughal Empire had impulsively began to re-centralize, particularly when many Nawabs sought the gratification of the Mughal Emperor and his co-ordination regarding their resistance to the Maratha. This development was clearly unwelcome by Imad-ul-Mulk who sought to strengthen his authoritarianism with the undaunted support of the Marathas. His Amir-ul-Umara and Mir Bakhshi continued to be Mirza Ashraf, the son of Khan Dowran VII(a noble in the reign of Farrukhsiyar and Muhammad Shah).

===Alliance with the Durrani Empire===
In the year 1755, the acclaimed Mughal viceroy of Punjab, Moin-ul-Mulk died, his widow Mughlani Begum desperately sought the assistance of Ahmad Shah Durrani to halt any succession struggle and to quell the Sikh rebels in the eastern regions.

Ahmad Shah Durrani and his forces then marched into Lahore in the year 1756 and appointed his son Timur Shah Durrani as the new viceroy at Lahore, under the protection of the commander Jahan Khan and also placed Adina Beg as the Faujdar of Doab. Ahmad Shah Durrani then plundered Sikh and Hindu inhabitants in the unstable and outlawed eastern regions of the Punjab.

He then marched towards Delhi, in January 1757, the Mughal Emperor Alamgir II with courtiers such as Shah Waliullah, nobles such as Najib-ul-Daula, and the imperial family went to meet Ahmad Shah Durrani, whose forces then engaged the Marathas in combat and threatened to overthrow and execute the regime of Imad-ul-Mulk in the sacking of Delhi.

Ahmad Shah Durrani&#x27;s relations with the Mughal Emperor, strengthened further when his son Timur Shah Durrani was chosen as the suitor of Alamgir II&#x27;s daughter Zuhra Begum. Ahmad Shah Durrani himself also married Hadrat Begum the daughter of the former Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah.

Ahmad Shah Durrani returned to Kabul leaving his forces led by his son Timur Shah Durrani consolidating themselves inside the garrisons of Lahore where they founded the Zamzama cannon with the assistance of Mughal Metalsmiths.

He was supported by Mohammad Bahawal Khan II (Nawab Amir of Bhawalpur) and Muhammad Nasir Khan I (Khanate of Kalat).

===Siege of Delhi (1757)===

In July 1757, the Marathas led by Raghunathrao rejected the alliance established between the Durrani Empire and the Mughal Empire, they were assisted by Imad-ul-Mulk and encamped 30 km opposite to the Red Fort and occupied all the villages by the Jamuna they began to besiege Delhi.

The Marathas fought against Alamgir II&#x27;s incumbent &quot;Mir Bakhshi&quot; (&quot;Paymaster&quot;) Najib-ul-Daula along with his lieutenants Qutub Shah and Aman Khan and a Mughal Army of 2,500 garrisoned inside the metropolis of Delhi. The angry Maratha set ferries ablaze and stopped food supplies from entering Delhi, while Najib-ul-Daula positioned his heavy artillery outside the vicinity of the Red Fort.

Unable to gain any assistance from Ahmad Shah Durrani, who was engaged in quelling various rebellions near Herat; Najib-ul-Daula surrendered after resisting the combined brigands of Maratha Confederacy for more than five months, he conceded defeat and withdrew to Najibabad. When the Marathas entered Delhi the emperor Alamgir II and his royal family had somehow fled to Bharatpur State. The Marathas looted and plundered the city and the people of Delhi. Mosques and Shrines built by the Mughals were desecrated; and the Peshwa conspired to place Vishwasrao upon the Mughal throne.

Imad-ul-Mulk was reappointed &quot;Mir Bakhshi&quot; and with the support of the Marathas. Not long after entering Delhi the Marathas encountered a Jat regiment sent by Suraj Mal who now began to claim sovereignty over Delhi. The Jat also plundered Delhi but soon afterwards made it possible for Alamgir II and the Mughal royal family to return to Delhi from Bharatpur.

However, despite losing control of Delhi, Najib-ul-Daula and his associates, such as Qutub Khan and Abdus Samad Khan the Mughal Faujdar of Sirhind, continued to challenge the Maratha Confederacy and its allies during confrontations at Saharanpur and Shahabad Markanda. In response the Marathas sacked the inhabitants of Taraori, Karnal and Kunjpura.

The Maratha attack upon Kunjpura triggered a military response by Ahmad Shah Durrani. Whose forces crossed the sacred rivers of India in search of their Maratha opponents.

=== Subjects opposing the Maratha Confederacy ===
In the year 1756, Alamgir II sympathised with the cause of his loyal Nawabs of Kurnool, Cuddapah and Savanur, when their assigned territories were ravaged and plundered until 1757 by the Maratha chieftain Balaji Baji Rao.

===Third Carnatic War (1757–1763)===


====Loss of Bengal====
Alamgir II grieved the death of Alivardi Khan the famous Nawab of Bengal, who annually pledged 5 million &quot;dams&quot; to the imperial court. His successor Siraj-ud-Daula was recognised as the next Nawab of Bengal, but he faced internal rivals who refused to consider the Firman granted by Alamgir II to Siraj-ud-Daula. These internal conflicts would lead Siraj-ud-Daula to hastily annex Calcutta from the English East India Company, without the permission of the Mughal Emperor Alamgir II and Salabat Jung. Siraj-ud-Daula was quickly defeated by Clive who recaptured Calcutta and defeated Siraj-ud-Daula during the Battle of Plassey in the year 1757. After the annihilation of his entire army Siraj-ud-Daula fled and was killed by the forces of the treacherous Mir Jafar. The deceased Siraj-ud-Daula&#x27;s pretensions were criticised in the Mughal imperial court by Ghulam Husain Tabatabai, and Alamgir II refused to recognise Mir Jafar as the next Nawab of Bengal. In response to the imperial court&#x27;s decision Mir Jafar thus consolidated and alliance with the manipulative Imad-ul-Mulk against the imperial family.

====Authority in the Deccan====
Throughout Alamgir II&#x27;s reign French commandant de Bussy and Lally and their allies such as Salabat Jung and Hyder Ali greatly contributed to the advancement of forces in the Deccan opposed to the utter dominance of the Maratha renegades, their achievements had earned them fame throughout the influential circles within the Mughal Empire. In the year 1756, Salabat Jung&#x27;s forces utilised heavy muskets known as &quot;Catyocks&quot;, which were attached to the ground, it was known to have fired more rapidly than a cannon. These new weapons would completely reverse fortunes of the Maratha rebels. Soon after the Battle of Plassey, the French commander De Bussy, also entitled &quot;Saif-ud-Daula Umdat-ul-Mulk&quot; and &quot;Mansabdar of 7000&quot;, by the Mughal Emperor Alamgir II. He captured the Northern Circars from the British along with his assistant Hyder Jung the &quot;Vakil&quot; (attorney) representing the French within the Mughal Empire and Salabat Jung. However the Northern Circars were retaken by Forde in the year 1758 and De Bussy was recalled to France. Fearing the worst Salabat Jung reconciled with the English East India Company and recognised their protectorate and was soon overthrown by his own brother Nizam Ali Khan.
===Raja of Kashmir===
In 1754, the Durrani governor of Kashmir, Sukh Jiwan Mal, expelled his deputy and asserted independence. To ratify his claim, he asked Alamgir II to recognise him as the sole representative of Kashmir. Alamgir II, in an agreement, conferred the title of &quot;Raja&quot; upon Sukh Jiwan.
===Nawab of Punjab===
Adina Beg, the former Nazim of Doaba, was appointed as the governor of Punjab by Nana Saheb I after his victory over the Durranis. Adina, who rather served as an autonomous ruler, was designated as the &quot;Nawab&quot; of Punjab by Alamgir II as he bestowed upon him the title of &quot;Zafar Jang Bahadur&quot;.

===Nawab of Bhopal===
In the year 1758, the Mughal Army of Faiz Mohammad Khan the Nawab of Bhopal was treacherously attacked by his step-mother Mamola Bai who suddenly besieged the Mughal garrison at Fortress of Raisen in 1758, according to the layout of the Marathas. The outraged Mughal Emperor Alamgir II, then issued a Firman supporting Faiz Mohammad Khan was the Nawab of Bhopal the only chosen administrator of Raisen, the emperor also granted the title &quot;Bahadur&quot; to Faiz Mohammad Khan the Nawab of Bhopal. However the fort remained under the control of Mamola Bai and the renegade Nanasaheb Peshwa. The fortress of Raisen was quickly retaken by Faiz Mohammad Khan in the year 1760, after the tragic assassination of Alamgir II and after Sadashivrao Bhau threatened to ravage Bhopal prior to the Third Battle of Panipat. It is believed that Faiz Mohammad Khan&#x27;s Sepoy&#x27;s were among those who had cut off the various supply routes of the Marathas just before the Third Battle of Panipat.

===Nawab of Cambay===

Najm-ad-Dawla supported British presence in Cambay. Turning much of his estate into an international &quot;safe zone&quot;. Although it is likely that he too had to face threats from the Maratha climax.

===&quot;Nawab of Mysore&quot;===
In 1758, Hyder Ali and his Sepoy captured Bangalore from &quot;Khande Rao of the Maratha Confederacy&quot;.

In honour of his achievements during the Carnatic Wars, the king gave him the title &quot;Nawab Haider Ali Khan Bahadur&quot;.

===Zenith of the Maratha Confederacy===
In 1758 the Marathas led by Raghunathrao occupied Lahore after extracted an extortion of imperial wealth from Imad-ul-Mulk, together they conspired the overthrow of young Timur Shah Durrani. Raghunathrao drove out Jahan Khan and Timur Shah Durrani, the son and viceroy of Ahmad Shah Durrani. Timur Shah Durrani and his forces were forced to retreat from Lahore to Peshawar under the force of attacks from Sikhs and Marathas. This victory made the belligerent Peshwa, grandiosely sack Delhi, and stated his intentions of placing Vishwasrao on the Mughal throne.

===Assassination===

Many of his actions had angered the people of India. Fearing a backlash in the summer of the year 1759 Prince Ali Gauhar escaped from Delhi.

Agitated by the daring escape Imad-ul-Mulk and Sadashivrao Bhau reckoned that Alamgir II was about to advance his son Prince Ali Gauhar, to dispossess and overthrow their regime.

After detailed consideration Imad-ul-Mulk and an angry mob of various ethnic groups plotted to murder the Mughal Emperor Alamgir II and the assassinations of prominent members of his family in the winter of 1759.

====Aftermath====

The defeat of Alamgir II&#x27;s son-in-law, Timur Shah Durrani by the Marathas in the year 1760, provoked the wrath of Ahmad Shah Durrani, who launched a massive campaign gathering more troops than ever before. In response to Imad-ul-Mulk and Sadashivrao Bhau; Najib-ud-Daula and his firm alliance of principal Muslim nobles in the Mughal Empire and Ahmad Shah Abdali recaptured Delhi and placed it under the nominal authority of Shah Alam II. In the south Hyder Ali and his Mysore Army ferociously attacked the Maratha. Meanwhile, Shah Alam II anticipated the collapse of the Maratha and declared Shuja-ud-Daula his Grand Vizier and Najib-ud-Daula as his honorary &quot;Mukhtar Khas&quot; (Chief Representative). These developments eventually culminated into rise of religious and political loyalties that eventually clashed at the &quot;Third Battle of Panipat&quot; in the year 1761.

==Foreign relations==
=== Seven Years&#x27; War ===

In 1756, the Seven Years&#x27; War had broken out and Alamgir II was supported by various international belligerents of that war. It was the first global war in which the Mughal emperor had his involvement apart from the boundaries of India. Alamgir II was initially involved in that war because the British were hasty in their attempts to conquer Bengal Subah.

In 1755, De Bussy received letter from new Mughal Emperor Alamgir II requesting French assistance to put down the Maratha Confederacy. Alamgir II asked if it was possible for De Bussy to dispatch a French contingent of 1000 strong to protect the Mughal Empire&#x27;s capital at Delhi. Alamgir II also promised to pay a hefty sum for the maintenance of the French and even promised to settle disputes in the Carnatic Wars in favour of the French East India Company.

In 1757, Alamgir II had successfully achieved peace between the Durrani Emirate and the Mughal Empire. Alamgir II even secured a matrimonial alliance when Timur Shah Durrani married Gauhar Afroz Begam the daughter of the Mughal Emperor Alamgir II in February 1757 and Ahmad Shah Durrani married Hazrat Begum the daughter of the former Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah in 1757.

in the year 1751, the Swedish East India Company was operating in Surat as a co-belligerent of Alamgir II. They were probably instrumental in assisting the first Nawab of Junagadh.
It is believed that Alamgir II even tried to reconcile the English East India Company and the French East India Company before his death in 1759.

==Death==
The newly appointed Mughal Grand Vizier after Ahmad Shah Durrani&#x27;s invasion was Najib-ud-Daula who tried to consolidate the remains of the Mughal Empire by uniting distant Faujdars (commanders), Nawab&#x27;s and Nizams into a common cause against the Marathas. Fearing their wrath the deposed Imad-ul-Mulk aligned himself with the Maratha leader Sadashivrao Bhau and launched a counterattack against Najib-ud-Daula which lasted 15 days and resulted in the defeat of Najib-ud-Daula who was driven north.

Imad-ul-Mulk then feared that the Mughal Emperor Alamgir II would recall Ahmad Shah Durrani, or use his son Prince Ali Gauhar, to dispossess him of his newfound power with the Marathas. Therefore, Imad-ul-Mulk plotted to murder the Mughal Emperor Alamgir II and his family. A few Mughal Princes, including Ali Gauhar desperately managed to escape before assassination. In November 1759, the Mughal Emperor Alamgir II was told that a pious man had come to meet him, Alamgir II, ever so eager to meet holy men, set out immediately to meet him at Kotla Fateh Shah, he was stabbed repeatedly by Imad-ul-Mulk&#x27;s assassins. The Mughal Emperor Alamgir II&#x27;s death was mourned throughout the Mughal Empire, particularly by the Muslim populace.

== In popular culture ==

<text>CFTM-DT (channel 10) is a television station in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, serving as the flagship of the French-language network TVA. Owned by Groupe TVA, the station has studios on Boulevard de Maisonneuve East and Rue Alexandre de Sève in the Ville-Marie borough of Montreal, and its transmitter is located on Voie Camillien Houde (near Mount Royal).

==History==

It opened on February 19, 1961, a few weeks after CFCF-TV went on the air for the first time. It was owned by Joseph Alexandre de Sève and his company, . At first it relied primarily on kinescopes from RTL, and also from Télé Monte Carlo, but it wasn&#x27;t long before it settled into a more peculiar and local form. On April 14, 1963, CFTM started sharing programs with CJPM-TV in Chicoutimi (now Saguenay) in the Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean region on the day the latter station signed on. They were joined by CFCM-TV in Quebec City in 1964. This was the informal beginning of TVA, though the network wasn&#x27;t officially established until September 12, 1971. When de Sève died in 1968, the city government renamed the street in front of CFTM&#x27;s studios in his honour.

CFTM has always been by far the largest station in the TVA network. As such, it dominated the network long before Télé-Métropole bought majority control of TVA in 1990. At one point, CFTM produced as much as 90 percent of TVA&#x27;s programming. Even today, TVA&#x27;s network feed is little more than a retransmission of CFTM. Whenever CFTM has to interrupt its programming for breaking news or weather alerts in Montreal, the entire network usually gets interrupted as well.

CFTM-TV was essentially available on satellite beginning November 1, 1981, as &quot;TCTV&quot;, carried via Cancom by cable television operators across Canada, though not in most major cities. TCTV carried mainly the same programs as CFTM, but with some local news and programming from other TVA affiliates.

The TCTV service ended when the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) approved TVA for a national network license in 1998. Since May 1, 1999, all Canadian cable companies have been required to carry a TVA station. CFTM is the affiliate carried in most markets outside of Quebec—excepting some markets in Northern Ontario, Eastern Ontario and New Brunswick, which have long carried the stations in adjacent markets. The station also provides a time-shifted feed for cable companies in western Canada, delayed three hours after the original broadcast, matching up with Pacific Time.

== Digital television and high definition==
CFTM received CRTC approval in March 2006 for its request to broadcast digitally on UHF channel 59 and was granted a requested extension to August 31, 2009, to launch this service but the launch never occurred. On July 6, 2009, as part of a license renewal hearing, TVA was granted a second extension in which to launch CFTM-DT.

During the analogue television shutdown and digital conversion, which took place on August 31, 2011, CFTM silenced its analogue transmitter on September 1, 2011, at 12:01 a.m. during a movie&#x27;s airing and began broadcasting a digital signal a few minutes later on its old analog channel number, 10.

<text>Pedro Antonio de Alarcón y Ariza (10 March 183319 July 1891) was a nineteenth-century Spanish novelist, known best for his novel &quot;El sombrero de tres picos&quot; (1874), an adaptation of popular traditions which provides a description of village life in Alarcón&#x27;s native region of Andalusia. It was the basis for Hugo Wolf&#x27;s opera &quot;Der Corregidor&quot; (1897); for Riccardo Zandonai&#x27;s opera &quot;La farsa amorosa&quot; (1933); and Manuel de Falla&#x27;s ballet &quot;The Three-Cornered Hat&quot; (1919).

Alarcón wrote another popular short novel, &quot;&quot; (&#x27;Captain Poison&#x27;, 1881). He produced four other full-length novels. One of these novels, &quot;El escándalo&quot; (&#x27;The Scandal&#x27;, 1875), became noted for its keen psychological insights. Alarcón also wrote three travel books and many short stories and essays.

Alarcón was born in Guadix, near Granada. In 1859, he served in the Hispano-Moroccan War. He gained his first literary recognition with &quot;&quot;, a patriotic account of the campaign.

<doc id="1271220" wikidata="Q368466" url="?curid=1271220" title="Watts Writers Workshop">
<text>The Watts Writers Workshop was a creative writing group initiated by screenwriter Budd Schulberg in the wake of the devastating August 1965 Watts Riots in South Central Los Angeles (now South Los Angeles). Schulberg later said: &quot;In a small way, I wanted to help... The only thing I knew was writing, so I decided to start a writers&#x27; workshop.&quot; The group, which functioned from 1965 to 1973, was composed primarily of young African Americans in Watts and the surrounding neighborhoods. Early on, the Workshop included a theatrical component and one of the founders was the actor Yaphet Kotto. The group expanded its facilities and activities over the next several years with funding from the Rockefeller Foundation. Government files later revealed that the Workshop had been the target of covert operations by the FBI. Writers involved in the Workshop include Quincy Troupe, Samuel Harris Jr better known as Leumas Sirrah, Johnie Scott, Eric Priestley, Ojenke, Herbert Simmons, and Wanda Coleman, as well as the poetry group Watts Prophets.

==History==
The Watts Writers Workshop was begun in September 1965. Founding members were: Ernest Mayhand, Leumas Sirrah, James Thomas Jackson, Birdell Chew Moore, Sonora McKeller, Jimmy Sherman, Johnie Scott, Guadelupe de Saavedra, Harley Mims, Eric Priestley, Alvin Saxon Jr. (Ojenke), Ryan Vallejo Kennedy, and Blossom Powe. 

On August 16, 1966, the Workshop was the subject of an hour-long NBC TV documentary, &quot;The Angry Voices of Watts&quot;, that drew press attention and support from prominent figures across the country, such as James Baldwin, John Steinbeck, Richard Burton, Steve Allen, Abbey Lincoln, Ira Gershwin, and Senator Robert F. Kennedy. In 1967 two anthologies of writing from the group appeared, both edited by Schulberg: &quot;From the Ashes: Voices of Watts&quot;, and the fall issue of &quot;The Antioch Review&quot; entitled &quot;The Watts Writers Workshop&quot;. In 1968, &quot;Watts Poets - A Book of New Poetry &amp; Essays&quot; was published, edited by Quincy Troupe.

The National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) awarded a grant of $25,000 awarded to enable the group to establish a meeting space for its writing programs as well as housing for some of the Workshop&#x27;s members, and a year later gave a second grant of $25,000 in support of expanding the Workshop&#x27;s programs. The workshop continued to expand. In 1972, television personality Sue Baker organized the teaching of a street dance called Campbellocking within the workshop&#x27;s theatrical department, forming one of the first street dance groups called &quot;Creative Generation&quot;, which was composed of several of the local street dancers who became popular on the television dance show &quot;Soul Train&quot;.

Harry Dolan, the director of the Watts Writers Workshop, was attempting to keep it going after the loss of federal funding by holding a fundraising dinner in April 1973, but within months the workshop building with its 350-seat theatre was burned down by FBI informant Darthard Perry (a.k.a. Ed Riggs), who began confessing to his activities in 1975. Perry stated in a 1980 interview with WABC-TV&#x27;s &quot;Like It Is&quot; that &quot;funding had been cut to the Workshop, it had been cut out, but it looked like there was a possibility of a grant being given back to the Workshop and if there was no theater there would be no grant.&quot;

<doc id="1271221" wikidata="Q4912313" url="?curid=1271221" title="Billy Caldwell">
<text>Billy Caldwell (March 17, 1782 – September 28, 1841), known also as Sauganash, a variant spelling of &quot;Zhagnash&quot; meaning British in the Potawatomi language, was a Métis fur trader who was commissioned captain in the Indian Department of Canada during the War of 1812, and fought alongside Tecumseh at the Battle of Frenchtown and likely all the subsequent battles until their defeat at the Battle of the Thames. In 1829 and 1833, he negotiated treaties on behalf of the United Nations of Chippewa, Ottawa and Potawatomi with the United States, as a leader of a Potawatomi and led his band to Trader&#x27;s Point, Iowa Territory, modern day Council Bluffs. He had worked to gain the boundary long promised by the British between white settlers and Indians, but never achieved it and instead acquiesced to American purchase and Indian removal, leading his followers personally across the Mississippi, as evidenced by his signing of the 2nd Treaty of Prairie du Chien and his inclusion on the Removal Muster Rolls of 1837.

Born in a Mohawk refugee camp near Fort Niagara, Billy was the son of William Caldwell, a Scots-Irish immigrant to North America and a Loyalist British officer during the American Revolutionary War, and a variously Mohawk or Shawnee woman. She is sometimes called the daughter of a Mohawk chief named &#x27;Rising Sun&#x27;, or, herself named &#x27;Rising Sun&#x27;. Due to his British father, French-Canadian step-mother, (Suzanne the daughter of Jacques Baby) and his later Potawatomi wife, he became multilingual, learning English, French, and Potawatomi.

After moving to the United States in 1818, Caldwell became a fur trader and learned Potawatomi, an Algonquian language; he negotiated with numerous tribes in the Lake Michigan area. He gained their respect and also acted as a translator and negotiator between the government and American Indians. In 1829, Caldwell represented the Chippewa, Ottawa and Potawatomi peoples of the United Nations Tribes in negotiating the Second Treaty of Prairie du Chien with the United States. For his work, the US granted him a 1600-acre tract, known as the Caldwell Reserve, along the Chicago River.

Together with Alexander Robinson, Caldwell also negotiated the 1833 Treaty of Chicago for the United Nations Tribes. The US had appointed the two mixed-race men as chiefs in 1829 to fill vacant positions, to encourage the United Nations Tribes to sign the cessions. The treaty led to the final removal of American Indians from that region, to west of the Mississippi River. In 1835, Caldwell migrated with his people from the Chicago region west to Platte County, Missouri.

As a result of the Platte Purchase in 1836, Caldwell and his band were removed from Missouri to Iowa Territory, to the area of Trader&#x27;s Point (&quot;Pointe aux Poules&quot;) on the east bank of the Missouri River. While living at Trader&#x27;s Point, Caldwell led a band of approximately 2000 Potawatomi. Their settlement became known as Camp Caldwell. In 1841 Caldwell died; scholars believe it may have been because of cholera.

==Early life and education==
Soon after the American Revolutionary War, Billy Caldwell, was born in 1782 (as documented through two autobiographical letters) in a Mohawk refugee camp near Fort Niagara to a Mohawk woman. His father was William Caldwell, a Scots-Irish immigrant who came to North America in 1773 and served as a Loyalist soldier in the war. Living first in Virginia, in 1774 his father had fought as an officer with Lord Dunmore and was wounded. After recovering, he went to Fort Niagara in New York, where he fought with the partisan Butler&#x27;s Rangers against Patriot colonists in New York and Pennsylvania.

After the war, Caldwell abandoned Billy and his mother, moving to the Detroit area. He resettled as a Loyalist in Upper Canada, where he was granted land by the British Crown. In addition to clearing land for his own farm, he helped develop the town of Amherstburg, in present-day Ontario.

In 1783, the senior Caldwell married Suzanne Baby (daughter of Jacques Baby dit Dupéron), of French-Canadian descent. They eventually had eight children together. In 1789, when Billy was seven, his father took the boy to live with him and his Canadian wife, who wanted to rear him in the Catholic faith. Billy was given a basic Anglo-Canadian education and became Catholic. Living with his father&#x27;s family, Billy learned to speak both English and French, after having grown up learning the Iroquoian Mohawk. Although Billy worked on his father&#x27;s farm as he was growing up, he wanted a different life.

==Career==
In 1797 at the age of 17, Billy Caldwell entered United States territory for the first time, to learn the fur trade business (he traded for much of his life). He kept his British Canadian loyalties and learned Potowatomi, an Algonquian language, for dealing with the several tribes of that language family near Lake Michigan.

Billy Caldwell Jr. was considered the left hand of the Great Leader Tecumseh, one of North America&#x27;s greatest European resistance movements.

In 1812, after the Battle of Fort Dearborn, Caldwell at age 32 returned to Canada to enlist in the British service; he looked for his father&#x27;s help to gain a commission. The senior Caldwell by then was a Lieutenant Colonel and had gained commissions for his sons by Suzanne. The regular army did not accept Billy Caldwell, but he was commissioned as a captain in the Indian Department. By then he had become influential among the Ojibwa, Ottawa and Potawatomi, Algonquian-speaking tribes inhabiting the area around Lake Michigan. Severely wounded in his first combat action, Caldwell Jr. recovered and participated in several more battles along the northern frontier. He was disgusted that the British abandoned their First Nations allies at the Battle of the Thames, when General Proctor made an early retreat before the US forces. By account of natives at the battle, Caldwell was one of the last to see Tecumseh alive, walking away after the battle mortally wounded in the chest. In addition, through this period Caldwell had worked with the British in the hope they would deliver the long-promised boundary between European and First Nations settlement, but each war ended with their ceding more land to the Americans.

In 1814, the Canadians appointed the senior Caldwell as Superintendent of Indians for the Western District, a position for which the younger Caldwell had competed as well. He was appointed second to his father. In 1815 Amherstburg, Ontario&#x27;s Commandant, Reginald James, suspended Caldwell Sr. because of problems in supplying the Indians; he appointed Billy Caldwell as Superintendent. The Indian Department quickly found that he could not manage the work and &quot;eased him out&quot; the following year, in 1816.

The younger Caldwell inherited a plot of land in early 1818 after his father&#x27;s death, but decided to return to the US. He settled in the Fort Dearborn area (now Chicago); he had long been recruited by Americans because of his influence with the local tribes. He worked hard to gain the Americans&#x27; trust. At the same time he continued to work with a local fur trade firm and became active with the tribes in the area.

He became more politically active and in 1825, Caldwell sought an appointment to become a justice of the peace. In August 1826, Caldwell served as a judge in Peoria County, Illinois&#x27;s first election. Also in 1826, he was recommended to the Governor of Illinois to hold the Justice of the Peace position for Peoria County. That year, he became an appraiser for the estate of John Crafts, a local trader who died during the year of 1825. In 1827, Caldwell worked for the United States to secure information related to a possible Winnebago uprising.

In 1829, Caldwell became one of several councilors to represent the United Nations of the Chippewa, Ottawa, and Potawatomi in negotiations with the United States in the &quot;Second Treaty of Prairie du Chien&quot;. The US was working on Indian Removal, the process that would be authorized by Congress in 1830. At the same time, their agents were also negotiating with the Winnebago for cessions and removal.

&quot;Through his involvement in the process, he became recognized as a chief of the United Nations,&quot; and was so introduced by their spokesmen. Also negotiating as a chief was Alexander Robinson (also known as &quot;Chechepinquay&quot; or The Squinter), a mixed-race Potawatomi who was Caldwell&#x27;s long-time friend. He later said that Dr. Wolcott, the US Indian Agent to the United Nations, arranged for both Robinson and Caldwell to be selected as chiefs to fill two vacancies. It was an example of US intervention into tribes&#x27; processes for identifying their own leaders. Wolcott wanted to have chiefs who would favor the treaty, fearing that unless all the chiefs&#x27; positions filled, the United Nations would not sign. The US granted both Robinson and Caldwell large plots of land under the treaty for their parts in influencing the other chiefs to sign the land cession.

Caldwell was given 1600 acres on the Chicago River. In 1833, he helped found the first Catholic church in Chicago, Saint Mary of the Assumption. It was located at what is now Lake Street west of State Street.

In 1833, together with Robinson, Caldwell was one of the chiefs representing the United Nations of the three tribes in negotiating the Treaty of Chicago. By this, the Potawatomi ceded the &quot;last of their Illinois and Wisconsin lands and their last reservations in Michigan.&quot; Caldwell and his band migrated west in 1835, first settling in Missouri west of the Mississippi River. The treaty provided for a $10,000 payment each to Caldwell and Robinson, and a $400 lifetime annuity for Caldwell, with $300 annually for Robinson. Before the US Senate ratified the treaty in 1835, it reduced the lump-sum payments to the men to $5000 each, but left their annuities intact. Robinson and some other Métis remained in Illinois on their private tracts of land, but most of the United Nations Tribes removed to Missouri and then to Iowa.

===Caldwell Reserve===
The US had awarded Caldwell&#x27;s Reserve, 1600 acres on the Chicago River, to &quot;Sauganash&quot; in 1829 as a result of his services in negotiating the &quot;Prairie du Chien&quot; treaty. In 1833, likely in preparation for their removal beyond the Mississippi River, as well as due to the declining fur trade and disappearance of game, Caldwell began selling off his land by contracting with the land speculator Arthur Bronson from New York. According to his land patent, to be legally binding, each deed had to have a president&#x27;s endorsed signature upon it.

All unsold parcels were legally to be considered owned by Caldwell&#x27;s heirs, in trust with the US Bureau of Indian Affairs. The land patent was not completed until 1839, and the deeds did not gain a president&#x27;s signature until 1841, after Caldwell and his band had left the area for the West.

In all, six land sales took place from Caldwell&#x27;s Reserve. These land transactions included: 80 acres to George W. Dole and Richard Hamilton in June 1833 for $100; 160 acres to Richard Nicolas, Sarah Amantus, Eleanor Hamilton, and infant heirs of Richard Jo and Diana W. Hamilton in July 1833 for $200; 160 acres to Philo Carpenter in July 1833 for $200; 720 acres to Arthur Bronson in 1833 for $900; 160 acres to Captain Seth Johnson in November 1833 for $200; 80 and 160 acres, respectively, to Julius B. Kingsbury in November 1834 for $300. To date, the Northern 160 acres of Caldwell&#x27;s Reserve were never legally conveyed for sale with a president&#x27;s signature of approval. They are included within the Cook County Forest Preserve and the neighborhood of Wildwood being purchased from an adverse possessor.

==Marriage and family==
Caldwell married Nannette about 1804, who gave him &quot;at least&quot; four children, three daughters all baptized by Father Stephen Badin, and a son Alexander. Nannette was either the niece or daughter of the powerful Potawatomi chief, Mad Sturgeon, Juliette Magill Kinzie in her book &quot;Wau-bun&quot; refers to the wife of Caldwell as the daughter of Chief &quot;Neescotnemeg&quot;, referring to Mad Sturgeon, likely a bastardization of the original name. The contemporary words for mad and sturgeon in Potawatomi are &quot;nshkadze&quot; and &quot;namé&quot;, respectfully. Given his name, Mad Sturgeon was likely from the Fish Doodem. It is claimed that Alexander, the male offspring of this union, died in 1832 in his twenties from alcoholism, however the timing cannot be correct as in 1834 Caldwell wrote a letter to his half-brother Francis complaining that his son Alexander had recently returned to his home &quot;almost naked&quot; and expressed concern about his &quot;future conduct.&quot; The strife could very well have been caused by Alexander&#x27;s overuse of alcohol. The same letter makes mention that Caldwell&#x27;s &quot;favorite daughter&quot; Elizabeth was on the verge of death at six years old. He expressed his thanks that she had been baptized by Father Stephen Badin, whose own records indicate she was born in 1826. Her own father would surely have been a more reliable source, meaning she was likely born in 1828.

Caldwell married again, but his second wife also died within a year after the birth of their first child, of which nothing is known.

Before leaving the Chicago area, Caldwell married a third time, on November 19, 1834. His bride was &quot;Saqua&quot; (also called &quot;Masaqua&quot;) LeGrand, likely a Métis woman of mixed native and French descent. According to a report made by the Hayes Administration in 1880, Caldwell was not known to have any living heirs, meaning all his children predeceased him. A certain Pe-y-mo, also spelled Pewymo, claimed to be his heir in the latter half of the 19th century, but the same report declared him to not be the trueborn son and heir of Caldwell. Whether this leaves Pe-y-mo as an illegitimate son, a step-son, or a failed conman is unclear.

==Indian removal==
In 1835, Caldwell and his band of Potawatomi left the State of Illinois and relocated in Platte County, Missouri.

In 1836, as a result of the Platte Purchase, Caldwell and his band were removed from this reservation to Trader&#x27;s Point on the east bank of the Missouri River in the Iowa Territory. The Potawatomi band of an estimated 2000 individuals settled in a main village called &quot;Caldwell&#x27;s Camp&quot;, located where the later city of Council Bluffs, Iowa developed. (This was on the eastern bank of the river, opposite the present-day city of Omaha, Nebraska.)

From 1838 to 1839, Caldwell and his people were ministered to by the notable Belgian Jesuit missionary Pierre-Jean De Smet, based in St. Louis, Missouri. The Jesuit priest was appalled at the violence and desperation that overtook the Potawatomi in their new home, in large part due to the whiskey trade. After De Smet returned to St. Louis, the Catholic mission was abandoned by 1841.
Caldwell died on September 28, 1841; scholars believe it may have been from cholera. His wife &quot;Masaqua&quot; died in the winter of 1843.

==Legacy and honors==
*The Sauganash Hotel, completed in Chicago in 1831 was named in honor of Caldwell.
*He was awarded a 1600-acre reserve on the Chicago River, including the confluence of the three tributaries of the North Branch of the Chicago River, which he started selling off in 1833. The reserve is clearly visible in the 1861 Plat of Chicago held at the Library of Congress. The eastern half of the reserve was sold as a chunk of 720 acres, and was subdivided and developed, today representing the neighborhood of Sauganash within Forest Glen. The 80 acres above were sold off separately and developed into the neighborhood of Wildwood. The western 800 acres were seemingly sold off as four parcels of 160 and the two northernmost parcels being 80 acres. The northernmost 80 acres on either side of U.S. Route 14, thus 160 total, never received the official presidential approval needed for the sale to be formalized. This land was purchased by the Cook County Forest Preserve, the eastern section becoming Wildwood, and the western section being part of Caldwell Woods. 
*He is thought to have had many children but none survived him according to a letter written to his half-brother Francis Caldwell.
*In the removal muster roll of 1837, Billy Caldwell is labelled as being the head of a family of five. Two children were under 10, there was a man and a woman marked as under 25, the woman may have been his last wife and eventual widow: Saqua (Masaqua) LeGrande, his own age marked as over 50.
*There is a Sauganash Golf Club in Three Rivers, MI., as well as another on his former reserve, both named in his honor. 
*He is the subject of two documentary films: &quot;Holy Ground&quot; which was limitedly released in theatres in December 2023, and &quot;The Negotiator: Billy Caldwell&quot;, which sold out its June 20, 2024 screening at the Illinois Holocaust Museum.

<doc id="1271225" wikidata="Q81460" url="?curid=1271225" title="T28 super-heavy tank">
<text>The T28 super-heavy tank was an American super-heavy tank/assault gun designed for the United States Army during World War II. It was originally designed to break through German defenses of the Siegfried Line and was later considered as a possible participant in the planned invasion of the Japanese mainland.

The near 100-ton vehicle was initially designated a heavy tank. It was re-designated as the 105 mm gun motor carriage T95 in 1945, and then renamed in 1946 as the super heavy tank T28.

Only two prototypes were built before the project was terminated.

==Name==
Initially named Heavy Tank T28 when construction was authorized in 1944, the design did not fit in the usual categories of vehicles, leading to reclassification. As it did not have its armament in a revolving turret, the Ordnance Department requested a name change to 105 mm Gun Motor Carriage T95, the change becoming official in March 1945. However, due to its heavy armor and armament—while self-propelled guns in United States service were lightly armored—it was renamed Super Heavy Tank T28 in June 1946 by OCM 37058.

==Development==
The T28/T95 was designed to be used for attacking the heavy defenses expected of the Siegfried Line along the western borders of Germany. The 105 mm T5E1 gun selected was known to have very good performance against concrete and &quot;expected to be extremely effective at reducing heavy fortifications&quot;. By the time the vehicle passed trials, the German Siegfried Line had already been infiltrated and overwhelmed by the Allied forces. As a result, the T28 never left the United States, with the vehicle instead serving as an engineering study and load test vehicle at Aberdeen Proving Ground. 

The need for an assault tank was first identified in 1943, with the Ordnance Department proposing that 25 vehicles could be ready for operations. A conference in March 1944 between the Ordnance Department and Army Ground Forces resulted in agreement to build five. The Pacific Car and Foundry Company were supplied with the design in March 1945, completed final design and had the first hull welded by August. By the time the first tank was completed and ready for combat, the war was over. The plan for five was reduced to two.

As it did not have a turret, but a fixed casemate mount instead for its main armament (as German &quot;Jagdpanzers&quot; and Soviet &quot;Samokhodnaya Ustanovka&quot;-designation combat vehicles did), and the 105 mm gun fitted could only elevate from 19.5° to −5° and traverse from 10° right to 11° left of the centerline, the T28 more closely resembled an assault gun, and was redesignated as &quot;T95 gun motor carriage&quot; in 1945, but in June 1946, the vehicle was redesignated again as &quot;super heavy tank T28&quot;.

Two prototypes of the T28 were built. They underwent evaluation at the Aberdeen Proving Ground and Fort Knox facilities until 1947. In 1947, one of the T28s was heavily damaged by an engine fire during trials at Yuma Proving Ground and was broken up and sold for scrap. The T28 never went into service due to the obsolete design, high maintenance costs, and the heavy weight, which made transportation overseas difficult, but was retained to test the &quot;durability of components on such a heavy vehicle&quot;. Work on it ended before completion as the War Department decided to stop the development of vehicles of that sort of weight and the T28 program terminated in October 1947. By that point, the T29 and T30 turreted heavy tank designs had been built. The T29 mounted the same gun as the T28 in a conventional rotating turret. The T30 was developed with a larger-caliber gun and more powerful engine. The T29 program was used to test mechanical components for future tank designs.

== Design ==

The original plan was to build five prototype vehicles, with a production total of 25. Its total weight when fully equipped would have reached 95 tons (86 tonnes). To lower ground pressure, instead of two tracks, it used four tracks that projected forward of the hull, each 20 inches (495 mm) wide. The outer tracks could be detached within two hours for rail transport: After removal, they could be fixed together to make a unit that could be towed behind the tank. Due to its extreme weight and low engine power, the T28 had extremely limited obstacle-crossing ability and could not cross any of the portable bridges available at the time, and so was considered impractical in the field and not suitable for production.

The T28 had no conventional turret, with a casemate style hull instead, giving it a comparatively low profile, as the later examples of the fully enclosed &quot;Jagdpanzer&quot;-family of German tank destroyers, not entirely dissimilar to the 50 short-ton weight German Jagdpanther. Its main armament was a 105 mm T5E1 gun in a ball-shaped gun mantlet set into the vertical hull front. The traverse was limited to 10° right and 11° left, and elevation from 19.5° to −5°. When traveling, the gun was locked at the maximum elevation. The only other armament was a .50 cal. (12.7 mm) M2 Browning machine gun on a ring mount above the commander&#x27;s hatch for anti-aircraft use. The main gun—65 calibres long—had a muzzle velocity of 3,700 feet per second (1,130 m/s), with a range of up to 12 miles (19 km). 

The armor was very thick compared to other tanks of the time, up to 12 inches (305 mm) thick on the front. This was considered heavy enough to provide protection from the German 88 mm gun used as tank and anti-tank guns. The lower hull front had 5.25 in (130 mm) of armor, and the sides 2.5 in (64 mm).The suspension system and lower hull were covered with 4-in (100 mm) thick steel skirts. The engine was a gasoline-powered Ford GAF V-8, delivering 500 hp, at 2600 rpm through the Torqmatic transmission; which left the vehicle underpowered, geared down to a top speed of about 8 mph (13 km/h) and greatly limited its obstacle-climbing capability. Although the vehicle was originally to feature the electric transmission of the Medium Tank T23, this was later changed to the mechanical transmission of the Medium Tank T26 due to the unreliability of the system.

== Surviving vehicle ==

In 1974, the last prototype was discovered abandoned in a field at Fort Belvoir, Virginia. Camouflaged in the middle of some bushes, it is unknown where it spent the intervening 27 years. It is the sole remaining example of these tanks and was exhibited at the Patton Museum of Cavalry and Armor in Kentucky. In 2011, it was shipped to its new home at U.S. Army Armor &amp; Cavalry Collection, Fort Moore, Georgia. It was placed in the new Patton Park, which is a plot of 30 acres where nine of the tanks being stored at Fort Moore are now displayed. The vehicle was damaged in January 2017 during transit to another facility for external refurbishment when it broke loose from the M1070 HET carrying it. The transporter failed to negotiate a downhill slope and subsequent turn at a safe speed, causing the securing chains to break and allowing the T28 to slide off the trailer. Despite then rolling into a ditch, only minor repairable damage was sustained to two bogies. The outer track units had been removed.

<text>Joe Lee Wilson (December 22, 1935 – July 17, 2011) was an American jazz singer from Bristow, Oklahoma, who lived in Europe since 1977.

==Biography==
Part African-American and part Creek Native American, Wilson was born in Bristow, Oklahoma, to farming parents Stella and Ellis Wilson.

As his band&#x27;s name, Joy of Jazz, suggests, Wilson&#x27;s baritone personified the life-affirming nature of jazz and blues. Seeing Billie Holiday perform in 1951 began his interest in a music-industry career. Moving to Los Angeles at the age of 15, he went to Los Angeles High School, where he majored in music and sang in an a cappella choir. Graduating with honors in 1954, he won a scholarship to the Los Angeles Conservatory of Music, where he studied opera, leaving after a year and then attending Los Angeles Junior College. He began singing with local bands in 1958 and toured the West Coast, where he sat in with Sarah Vaughan, and down to Mexico. Relocating to New York in 1962, he worked with Sonny Rollins, Lee Morgan, Miles Davis, Pharoah Sanders, Freddie Hubbard, and Jackie McLean. During the 1970s, Wilson operated a jazz performance loft in New York&#x27;s NoHo district known as the Ladies&#x27; Fort at 2 Bond Street. His regular band, Joe Lee Wilson Plus 5, featured the alto saxophonist Monty Waters (from Modesto, California) and for several years the Japanese guitarist Ryo Kawasaki, before the latter left to lead his own group. Archie Shepp and Eddie Jefferson were frequent collaborators at these sessions.

He also sang with Eddie Jefferson, Freddie Hubbard, and Kenny Dorham. 

Wilson had a minor radio hit from a live radio recording he did on a radio program hosted by Sharif Abdus-Salaam (né Ed Michael) at WKCR-FM, Columbia University, on July 16, 1972. The live shot was released as an album, &quot;Livin&#x27; High Off Nickels &amp; Dimes,&quot; on the short-lived Oblivion Records in New York. Wilson&#x27;s rendition of Norman Mapp&#x27;s &quot;Jazz Ain&#x27;t Nothing But Soul&quot; was a radio hit on New York jazz radio in 1975.

In 1977 he and his English wife Jill Christopher moved to Europe. While based in Paris, Tokyo, and the United Kingdom (for a time living in the London flat of Val Wilmer, before settling in Brighton, Sussex), he recorded regularly with the American pianist Kirk Lightsey, including the Candid recording &quot;Feelin&#x27; Good.&quot; One of Wilson&#x27;s last albums was an Italian recording with Riccardo Arrighini and Gianni Basso, &quot;Ballads for Trane&quot; (Philology W707.2).

Wilson was inducted into the Oklahoma Jazz Hall of Fame in November 2010, where he gave his last public performance. Having had heart surgery in 2009, he died of congestive heart failure at his Brighton home in 2011, aged 75.

Wilson is the subject of a documentary film, &quot;Around Joe Lee&quot;, by Yves Breux and Brad Scott.

<doc id="1271233" wikidata="Q741731" url="?curid=1271233" title="Saqaliba">
<text>Saqaliba (, singular ) is a term used in medieval Arabic sources to refer to Slavs, and other peoples of Central, Southern, and Eastern Europe. The term originates from the Middle Greek &quot;slavos/sklavenos&quot; (Slav), which in Hispano-Arabic came to designate Slavic slaves.

The Arabs had only a very vague notion of the ethnic characteristics of the populations with which they were not neighbors. It is likely that the term Saqaliba designated a disparate group of Balkan, Caucasian, Turkic and Slavic peoples living between the Baltic Sea and the Black and Caspian Seas. Ahmad ibn Fadlan, for example, describes Almis, king of the Volga Bulgars, as &quot;king of the Saqaliba&quot;, while Al-Biruni calls the Baltic Sea the &quot;sea of the Saqaliba&quot;.

The word was often used to refer specifically to Slavic slaves, but it could also refer more broadly to various other ethnicities of Eastern Europe traded by the Arab traders, as well as all European slaves in some Muslim regions like Spain and Portugal including those abducted from raids on Christian kingdoms of Spain and Portugal. According to Sudár and B. Szabó, the word Saqaliba meant &#x27;forest dweller&#x27;, regardless of ethnicity.

Saqaliba slaves, mostly young males, were taught the Arabic language and brought into the fold of Islam. These Saqaliba slaves filled military and administrative positions within Islamic empires, especially in Al-Andalus, where the Saqaliba became an important social group during the 10th and 11th centuries.

There were several major routes for the trading of Slavic slaves into the Arab world: through Central Asia (Mongols, Tatars, Khazars, etc.) for the East Slavs; through the Balkans for the South Slavs; through Central and Western Europe for the West Slavs and to al-Andalus. The Volga trade route and other European routes, according to Ibrahim ibn Jakub (10th century), were serviced by Radanite Jewish merchants. Theophanes mentions that the Umayyad caliph Mu&#x27;awiya I settled a whole army of 5,000 Slavic mercenaries in Syria who had defected from the Byzantine side in the 660s. After the battle of Sebastopolis in 692, Neboulos, the archon of the Slavic corps in the Byzantine army, and 30,000 of his men were settled by the Umayyads in the region of Syria.

In the Arab world, the Saqaliba served or were forced to serve in a multitude of ways: as servants, harem concubines, eunuchs, craftsmen, mercenaries, slave soldiers, and as Caliph&#x27;s guards. In Iberia, Morocco, Damascus and Sicily, their military role may be compared with that of mamluks in the Ottoman Empire. In al-Andalus, Slavic eunuchs were so popular and widely distributed that they became synonymous with the term Saqāliba, though not all Saqaliba were eunuchs.
Some Saqāliba became rulers of &quot;taifas&quot; (principalities) in Iberia after the collapse of the Caliphate of Cordoba in 1031. For example, Mujāhid al-ʿĀmirī organized the Saqaliba in Dénia to rebel, seize control of the city, and establish the Taifa of Dénia (1010–1227), which extended its reach as far as the island of Majorca.

==Saqaliba slave trade==
The Volga trade route was established by the Varangians (Vikings) who settled in Northwestern Russia in the early 9th century. About south of the Volkhov River entry into Lake Ladoga, they established a settlement called Ladoga (Old Norse: &quot;Aldeigjuborg&quot;). It connected Northern Europe and Northwestern Russia with the Caspian Sea, via the Volga River. The Rus used this route to trade with Muslim countries on the southern shores of the Caspian Sea, sometimes penetrating as far as Baghdad. The route functioned concurrently with the Dnieper trade route, better known as the trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks, and lost its importance in the 11th century.

&quot;Saqaliba&quot; originally was used to denote Slavic people, however later it came to denote all European slaves in some Muslim regions like Spain including those abducted from raids on Christian kingdoms of Spain. The Franks started buying slaves from the Slavs and Avar Khaganate while Muslims also came across slaves in the form of mercenaries serving the Byzantine Empire and settlers in addition to among the Khazars. Most Slavic slaves were imported to the Muslim world through the border between Christian and Islamic kingdoms where castration centres were also located instead of the direct route. From there they were sent into Islamic Spain and other Muslim-ruled regions especially North Africa. The Saqaliba gained popularity in Umayyad Spain especially as warriors. After the collapse of the Umayyads, they also came to rule over many of the taifas. With the conversion of Eastern Europe, the trade declined and there isn&#x27;t much textual information on Saqaliba after 11th century.

Eastern Europe was the most favoured destination for importation of slaves alongside Central Asia and Bilad as-Sudan, though Balkan and Turkic slaves from Southeastern Europe were also valued. This slave trade was controlled mostly by European slave traders. France and Venice were the routes used to send Slavic slaves to Muslim lands and Prague served as a major centre for castration of Slavic captives. The Emirate of Bari also served as an important port for this trade. Due to the Byzantine Empire and Venice blocking Arab merchants from European ports, they later started importing in slave from the Caucasus and the Caspian Sea.

The &quot;Saqaliba&quot; were also imported as eunuchs and concubines to Muslim states. The slavery of eunuchs in the Muslim world however was expensive and they thus were given as gifts by rulers. The &quot;Saqaliba&quot; eunuchs were prominent at the court of Aghlabids and later Fatimids who imported them from Spain and Portugal. The Fatimids also used other &quot;Saqaliba&quot; slaves for military purposes.

===Central Asian route===
Slavery in the Muslim world provided a great market for the slaves captured by the Vikings in Europe. Islamic law banned Muslims from enslaving other Muslims, and there was a big market for non-Muslim slaves on Islamic territory, where European slaves were referred to as &quot;saqaliba&quot;; these slaves were likely both pagan Slavic, Finnic and Baltic Eastern Europeans as well as Christian Europeans and these slaves where often transported along the Black Sea slave trade route.

People taken captive during the Viking raids across Europe could be sold to Moorish Spain via the Dublin slave trade or transported to Hedeby or Brännö in Scandinavia and from there 
via the Volga trade route to present day Russia, where slaves and furs were sold to Muslim merchants in exchange for Arab silver &quot;dirham&quot; and silk, which have been found in Birka, Wollin and Dublin; initially this trade route between Europe and the Abbasid Caliphate passed via the Khazar Kaghanate, but from the early 10th-century onward it went via Volga Bulgaria and from there by caravan to Khwarazm, to the Samanid slave market in Central Asia and finally via Iran to the Abbasid Caliphate.
This was one of the major routes of the Viking slave trade, alongside the Black Sea slave trade.

The slave trade between the Vikings and the Muslims in Central Asia are known to have functioned from at least between 786 and 1009, as big quantities of silver coins from the Samanid Empire has been found in Scandinavia from these years, and people taken captive by the Vikings during their raids in Europe were likely sold in Islamic Central Asia, a slave trade which was so lucrative that it may have contributed to the Viking raids across Europe.

===Balkan slave trade===
The Balkan slave trade went by route from the Balkans via Venetian slave traders across the Adriatic and the Aegean Seas to the Islamic Middle East, from the 7th-century until the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans in the 15th-century.

Until the 6th- and 7th-century, the Balkans belonged to the Byzantine Empire, but was split by invasions of the Avars, Slavic tribes and other peoples. The new peoples populating the Balkans did not initially create any centralized state, which created a situation of permanent political instability on the Balkans. The various tribes conducted warfare against each other and took war captives. Due to the lack of a centralized state to negotiate for ransom, a habit formed in which war captives from the tribal wars on the Balkans were often sold to merchants from the Republic of Venice at the Adriatic coast. 
This developed in to a major slave trade in which Venetians bought captives from the Balkans whom they sold to the Byzantine Empire and the Islamic Middle East, which contributed to the growth of Venice as a major commercial empire by the 11th-century.

The slaves bought by the Venetians at the Adriatic coast were transported by the Venetians to the slave market at the Aegean Islands were the majority continued to Egypt.

===Prague slave trade===
In Western Europe, a major slave trade route went from Prague in Central Europe via France to Moorish al-Andalus, which was both a destination for the slaves as well as center of slave trade to the rest of the Muslim world in the Middle East.
Prague in the Duchy of Bohemia, which was a recently Christianized state in the early 10th century, became a major center of the European slave trade in between the 9th and the 11th century.
The revenue from the Prague slave trade has been named as one of the economic foundations of the Bohemian state, financing the armies necessary to form a centralized state, which was not uncommon for the new Christian state in Eastern Europe.

The Duchy of Bohemia was a state in a religious border zone, bordering to Pagan Slavic lands to the North, East and South East. In the Middle ages, religion was the determining factor on who was considered a legitimate target for enslavement. Christians prohibited Christians from enslaving other Christians, and Muslims prohibited Muslims from enslaving other Muslims; however, both approved of the enslavement of Pagans, who thereby became a lucrative target for slave traders.
In the 9th and 10th centuries, the Slavs in Eastern Europe were still adherents of the Slavic religion, making them Pagans to the Christians and infidels to the Muslims and considered as legitimate targets for enslavement by both. 
Bohemia, being a religious border state close to Pagan lands, were thus in an ideal position to engage in slave trade with both Christians and Muslims, having access to a close supply of Pagan captives. The slaves were acquired through slave raids toward the Pagan Slavic lands North of Prague.

The Pagan Slavic tribes of Central and Eastern Europe were targeted for slavery by several actors in the frequent military expeditions and raids alongside their lands. During the military campaigns of Charlemagne and his successor in the 9th century, Pagan Slavs were captured and sold by the Christian Franks along the Danube-Elbe rivers, and by the mid-10th century, Prague had become a big center of the slave trade in Slavic Pagans to al-Andalus via France.

Prague was known in all Europe as a major slave trade center. The armies of the Dukes of Bohemia captured Pagan Slavs from the East in expeditions to the lands later known as Poland to supply the slave market, which brought considerable profit to the Dukes. Several sources from the 10th century mentioned how the Dukes were involved in supplying the Prague slave market and that the slaves normally came from lands corresponding to what later corresponded to Southern Poland and Western Ukraine.

The slaves sold by the Vikings via the Eastern route could be Christian Western Europeans, but the slaves provided by the Vikings to the slave route of Prague-Magdeburg-Verdun were Pagan Slavs, who in contrast to Christians were legitimate for other Christians to enslave and sell as slaves to Muslims; according to Liutprand of Cremona, these slaves were trafficked to slavery in al-Andalus via Verdun, were some of them were selected to undergo castration to become eunuchs for the Muslim slave market in al-Andalus.

Traditionally, the slave traders acquiring the slaves in Prague and transporting them to the slave market of al-Andalus are said to have been dominated by the Jewish Radhanite merchants. 
While Christians were not allowed to enslave Christians and Muslims not allowed to enslave Muslims, Jewish slave traders had the advantage to move freely across religious borders, and supply Muslim slaves to the Christian world and Christian slaves to the Muslim world. as well as Pagan slaves to both. 
Both Christians and Muslims were prohibited from performing castrations, but there was no such ban for Jews, which made it possible for them to meet the great demand for eunuchs in the Muslim world.

The slaves were transported from Prague to Al-Andalus via France. While the church discouraged the sale of Christian slaves to Muslims, the sale of Pagans to Muslims was not met with such opposition. Louis the Fair granted his permission to Jewish merchants to traffick slaves through his Kingdom provided they were non-baptized Pagans.

The most lucrative slave market was the Islamic slavery in Al-Andalus. The Arabic Caliphate of Córdoba referred to the forests of Central and Eastern Europe, which came to function as a slave source supply, as the &quot;Bilad as-Saqaliba&quot; (&quot;land of the slaves&quot;).
The Prague slave market was a part of a big net of slave trade in European Saqaliba slaves to the Muslim world. Ibn Hawqal wrote in the 10th century: 
:‘The country [of the Saqaliba] is long and wide...Half of their country...is raided by the Khurasanis [Khorezm] who take prisoners from it, while its northern half is raided by the Andalusians who buy them in Galicia, in France, in Lombardy and in Calabria so as to make them eunuchs, and thereafter they ferry them over to Egypt and Africa. All the Saqaliba eunuchs in the world come from Andalusia...They are castrated near this country. The operation is performed by Jewish merchants.&#x27;

In Islamic lands, the slave market had specific requirements. Female slaves were used for either domestic or sexual slavery as concubines. Male slaves were used for one of two categories: either for military slavery or as eunuchs. 
The latter category of male slaves were subjected to castration for the market. Many male slaves selected to be sold as eunuchs were subjected to castration in Verdun. 
The nature of the market for Saqaliba slaves meant that most Saqaliba slaves would have been prepubescent children when enslaved.

In Moorish al-Andalus, European Saqaliba-slaves were considered as exotic display objects with their light hair, skin and eye colors. 
White European slaves were viewed as luxury goods in Al-Andalus, where they could be sold for as much as 1,000 &quot;dinars&quot;, a substantial price.

The slaves were not always destined for the al-Andalus market; similar to Bohemia in Europe, al-Andalus was a religious border state for the Muslim world, and Saqaliba slaves were exported from there further to the Muslim world in the Middle East.

The Duchy of Bohemia and the Caliphate of Córdoba were both dependent on each other because of the from the slave trade; the Caliphate of Córdoba was dependent on enslaved bureaucrats and slave soldiers to build and manage their centralised state, while the new state of the Duchy of Bohemia built their economic prosperity in the profit earned by trading captives for slavery in the Caliphate of Córdoba.

The saqaliba slave trade from Prague to al-Andalus via France lost its religious legitimacy when the Pagan Slavs of the North started to gradually adopt Christianity from the late 10th century, which made them of bounds for Christian Bohemia to enslave and sell to Muslim al-Andalus.

Christian Europe did not approve of Christian slaves, and as Europe adopted Christianity almost entirely by the 11th century slavery died out in Western Europe North of the Alps in the 12th- and 13th-centuries.

The disintegration of the Caliphate of Córdoba in the early 11th century, which was completed by 1031, corresponded to a period of instability in the Duchy of Bohemia in parallel with the end of the slave trade between Bohemia and the Caliphate.

===Other slave trade routes===
During the Middle ages, Saracen pirates established themselves in bases in France, the Baleares, Southern Italy and Sicily, from which they raided the coasts of the Christian Mediterranean and exported their prisoners as Saqaliba slaves to the slave markets of the Muslim Middle East.

The Aghlabids of Ifriqiya was a base for Saracen attacks along the Spanish East coast as well as against Southern Italy from the early 9th century; they attacked Rome in 845, Comacchio in 875-876, Monte Cassino in 882-83, and established the Emirate of Bari (847–871), the Emirate of Sicily (831–1091) and a base in Garigliano (882-906), which became bases of slave trade.
During the warfare between Rome and the Byzantine Empire in Southern Italy in the 9th century the Saracens made Southern Italy a supply source for a slave trade to Maghreb by the mid-9th century; the Western Emperor Louis II complained in a letter to the Byzantine Emperor that the Byzantines in Naples guided the Saracens in their raids toward South Italy and aided them in their slave trade with Italians to North Africa, an accusation noted also by the Lombard Chronicler Erchempert.

Moorish Saracen pirates from al-Andalus attacked Marseille and Arles and established a base in Camargue, Fraxinetum or La Garde-Freinet-Les Mautes (888-972), from which they made slave raids in to France; the population fled in fear of the slave raids, which made it difficult for the Frankish to secure their Southern coast, and the Saracens of Fraxinetum exported the Frankish prisoners they captured as slaves to the slave market of the Muslim Middle East.

The Saracens captured the Baleares in 903, and made slave raids also from this base toward the coasts of the Christian Mediterranean and Sicily.

While the Saracen bases in France was eliminated in 972 and Italy in 1091, this did not prevent the Saracen piracy slave trade of the Mediterranean; both Almoravid dynasty (1040-1147) and the Almohad Caliphate (1121–1269) approved of the slave raiding of Saracen pirates toward non-Muslim ships in Gibraltar and the Mediterranean for the purpose of slave raiding.

<text>Heinrich Albertz (22 January 1915 – 18 May 1993) was a German Protestant theologian, priest and politician of the Social Democratic Party (SPD). He served as Governing Mayor of Berlin (West Berlin) from 1966 to 1967.

==Life==
Heinrich Albertz was born in Breslau (present-day Wrocław, Poland), in the Prussian province of Silesia, to the court preacher and consistorial councilor Hugo Albertz and his second wife Elisabeth, née Meinhof. His elder half brother was the Resistance fighter Martin Albertz. Having obtained his baccalaureate (&quot;Abitur&quot;) in 1933, he went on to study theology at the universities of Breslau, Halle and Berlin. Under the Nazi regime, he maintained contact to circles of the banned Social Democratic Party. As a member of the Confessing Church opposing the Nazis, he showed solidarity with the imprisoned pastor Martin Niemöller, was arrested several times and finally conscripted into the Wehrmacht in 1941.

After World War II Albertz moved to Celle, where the British occupation authorities entrusted him with the reception of expellees and displaced persons. He joined the SPD and in 1946 became a member of the Landtag of Lower Saxony. In 1948 he was appointed minister for expellee affairs in the Lower Saxon state cabinet under Minister-President Hinrich Wilhelm Kopf; in 1951 he became state minister of social affairs. Since 1950 he was also a member of the SPD federal board.

He was a Christian pacifist and opposed the production and placement of nuclear weapons on German soil.

When the Kopf cabinet was succeeded by the right-wing government of Minister-President Heinrich Hellwege upon the 1955 state elections, Albertz continued his career as a state secretary under the West Berlin mayor Otto Suhr. In 1961 he became Senator (minister) of the Interior under Mayor Willy Brandt and deputy mayor in 1963. When Brandt joined the German grand coalition government of Chancellor Kurt Georg Kiesinger, Albertz succeeded him and was elected governing mayor of West Berlin by the Abgeordnetenhaus parliament on 14 December 1966.

Albertz, standing in the shadow of his popular predecessor, led the Social Democrats into the following state election held on 12 March 1967. Nevertheless, the SPD was able to maintain its absolute majority. Albertz&#x27; term in office was characterized by the rising student revolts culminating during the state visit by Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and his wife Farah Pahlavi. On 2 June 1967, Pahlavi was received in West Berlin, accompanied by violent clashes of protesters with Iranian secret police collaborators and massive police forces, whereby the student Benno Ohnesorg was shot by police officer Karl-Heinz Kurras, an incident that became a turning point in the devolution of the German student movement. On 28 September Mayor Albertz was forced to resign after an investigation into the police&#x27;s role in the killing. The Abgeordnetenhaus elected Klaus Schütz his successor.

From 1970 he worked as a pastor, from 1974 to 1979 in Berlin-Zehlendorf. When on 27 February 1975 the Movement 2 June militant group (named after the obit of Benno Ohnesorg) abducted the Christian Democrat candidate for Mayor of West Berlin Peter Lorenz, Albertz agreed to accompany the exchanged prisoners, among them Verena Becker and Gabriele Kröcher-Tiedemann, on their flight to South Yemen. Retired in 1979, he joined the German peace movement of the 1980s and several protests against the NATO Double-Track Decision.

Albertz died in a Bremen nursing home on 18 May 1993.

<doc id="1271237" wikidata="Q1197204" url="?curid=1271237" title="The Front">
<text>The Front is a 1976 American drama film set against the Hollywood blacklist in the 1950s, when artists, writers, directors, and others were rendered unemployable, having been accused of subversive political activities in support of Communism or of being Communists themselves. It was written by Walter Bernstein, directed by Martin Ritt, and stars Woody Allen, Zero Mostel and Michael Murphy.

Several people involved in the making of the film—including screenwriter Bernstein, director Ritt, and actors Mostel, Herschel Bernardi, and Lloyd Gough—had been blacklisted. (The name of each in the closing credits is followed by &quot;Blacklisted 19--&quot; and the relevant year.) Bernstein was listed after being named in the &quot;Red Channels&quot; journal that identified alleged Communists and Communist sympathizers.

==Plot==
In New York City, 1953, at the height of the anti-Communist investigations of the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), television screenwriter Alfred Miller is blacklisted and cannot get work. He asks his friend Howard Prince, a restaurant cashier and small-time bookie, to sign his name to Miller&#x27;s television scripts in exchange for ten percent of the money Miller makes from them, i.e. to serve as a &quot;front&quot; for Miller. Howard agrees out of friendship and because he needs the money. The scripts are submitted to network producer Phil Sussman, who is pleased to have a writer not on the television blacklist. Howard&#x27;s script also offers a plum role for Hecky Brown, one of Sussman&#x27;s top actors.

Howard becomes such a success that Miller&#x27;s two fellow screenwriter friends hire him to be their front as well. The quality of the scripts and Howard&#x27;s ability to write so many impresses Florence Barrett, Sussman&#x27;s idealistic script editor, who mistakes him for a principled artist. Howard begins dating her but changes the subject whenever she wants to discuss his work.

As investigators expose and blacklist Communists in the entertainment industry, Hecky Brown is fired from the show because six years earlier he marched in a May Day parade and subscribed to &quot;The Daily Worker&quot;, although he tells the investigators he did it merely to impress a woman he wanted to have sex with. In order to clear his name from the blacklist, Hecky is instructed to find out more about Howard Prince&#x27;s involvement with the Communist Party, so he invites him to the Catskills, where Hecky is booked to perform on stage. The club owner short-changes Hecky on his promised salary, and when Hecky confronts him, the club owner fires him, denouncing him as a &quot;communist son of a bitch&quot;. The professional humiliation and the inability to provide for his wife and children take their toll on Hecky and he kills himself by jumping out of a hotel window.

Howard witnesses other harsh results of the investigative actions of the communist-hunting &quot;Freedom Information Services&quot; on the network&#x27;s programming. Suspicion is cast his way, and he is called to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee. He privately tells Florence that he is not a writer, just a humble cashier.

Howard decides that he will respond to the Committee&#x27;s questions evasively, enabling him to neither admit nor deny anything. After briefly enduring the HUAC questioning – including being asked to speak ill of the dead Hecky Brown, and being threatened with legal consequences for his admission of having placed bets in his capacity as a bookie (which is illegal), Howard takes a stand, telling the Committee that he does not recognize their authority to ask him such questions, and telling them to &quot;go fuck yourselves&quot; before leaving the interrogation room. The film ends as Howard is taken away in handcuffs, with Florence kissing him good-bye and many protesters cheering him on.

==Reception==
Critical reception of &quot;The Front&quot; was divided between those who thought it effectively and amusingly dealt with the topic of McCarthyism and those who thought it a superficial gloss instead of a pithy statement about the McCarthy era. In 1976, reviewing it for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Vincent Canby acknowledged the film&#x27;s lack of direct political commentary: &quot;&quot;The Front&quot; is not the whole story of an especially unpleasant piece of American history. It may be faulted for oversimplification. Mr. Ritt and Mr. Bernstein, veterans of the blacklist, are not interested in subtleties. Yet, even in its comic moments, &quot;The Front&quot; works on the conscience. &quot;It recreates the awful noise of ignorance that can still be heard.&quot; (Canby, 1976).

Pauline Kael wrote in praise of the film and the performance of Woody Allen in particular: &quot;At its most appealing, this movie says that people shouldn&#x27;t be pressured to inform on their friends, that people shouldn&#x27;t be humiliated in order to earn a living. Humbly, this film asks for fairness...When you see Woody Allen in one of his own films, in a peculiar way you take him for granted; here you appreciate his skill, because you miss him so much when he&#x27;s offscreen.&quot;

Roger Ebert dismissed the political value of &quot;The Front&quot;: &quot;What we get are the adventures of a schlemiel in wonderland&quot;. He felt that the Woody Allen character was too comic and unconvincing a writer to represent the true nature of &quot;front&quot; writers. He added that Hecky Brown was a worthwhile character: &quot;The tragedy implied by this character tells us what we need to know about the blacklist&#x27;s effect on people&#x27;s lives; the rest of the movie adds almost nothing else&quot;.

As of December 2023, &quot;The Front&quot; holds a rating of 69% on Rotten Tomatoes from 26 reviews.

===Accolades===
For &quot;The Front&quot;, Walter Bernstein was nominated for the 1977 Academy Award for Writing Original Screenplay and Zero Mostel was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor. Andrea Marcovicci was nominated for the 1977 &quot;Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actress&quot;.

==Historical basis==
The movie draws from real incidents in its depiction of the characters. A scene in which Hecky (played by Mostel) goes to entertain at a mountain resort, and then is cheated out of part of his fee, is based on an incident described by Bernstein in his memoirs &quot;Inside Out: A Memoir of the Blacklist&quot;. In the book, Bernstein describes how Mostel came to entertain at the Concord Hotel in the Catskills, where he used to entertain as a rising comic because he desperately needed the money. The manager of the Concord promised him $500, but when he arrived, reduced that to $250, according to Bernstein. In the movie, Hecky has a violent scene when, after the performance, he learns he has been cheated. In real life, Mostel was told before the performance and acted out his hostility during the performance by cursing at the customers, who thought it was part of the act.

Hecky Brown, and his suicide, was based on blacklisted actor Philip Loeb, a friend of Mostel who was investigated by HUAC and fired from his leading role in the television series &quot;The Goldbergs&quot; in 1951. He died by suicide in 1955. Mostel was motivated to participate in the project because he wanted to educate future generations of Americans. As he pointed out in his biography by Jared Brown, &quot;It&#x27;s part of this country, and a lot of kids don&#x27;t even realize that blacklisting ever existed.&quot; An informal collective of the blacklisted writers Bernstein, Arnold Manoff, and Abraham Polonsky is portrayed in an early scene in which the Murphy character, modeled on Bernstein, introduces the Allen character to two other blacklisted writers.

== Musical adaptation ==
In 2008, a musical adaptation of &quot;The Front&quot; had a workshop in New York City. The musical, also titled &quot;The Front&quot; (or, alternatively, &quot;Lucky Break&quot;) had music and lyrics by Paul Gordon and Jay Gruska, with a book and additional lyrics by Seth Friedman, and its workshop was co-directed by John Caird and Nell Balaban, starring Brian d&#x27;Arcy James as Howard Prince, Richard Kind as Hecky Brown, and Jayne Paterson as Florence Barrett.

<text>Hugh Meade Alcorn Jr. (October 20, 1907 – January 13, 1992) was a U.S. lawyer and political figure. He was a native of Suffield, Connecticut.

==Biography==
He was born on October 20, 1907, to Cora Terry (Wells) and Hugh Mead Alcorn Sr.

He attended Dartmouth College and Yale Law School. An attorney, he was a partner in the once-prominent Connecticut law firm Tyler, Cooper &amp; Alcorn.

Alcorn was a key figure in Connecticut politics following World War II. He served as State Representative, Republican floor leader, and then Speaker of the Connecticut House of Representatives. He also served as Hartford State&#x27;s Attorney. As the Republican leader in the Connecticut General Assembly, he was often paired against John Bailey, his legendary Democratic counterpart. He was the Republican candidate for lieutenant governor in 1948, losing narrowly to Democrat William T. Carroll.

Alcorn joined the Republican National Committee in 1953, and was the chairman of the Republican National Committee between 1957 and 1959, during the presidency of Dwight Eisenhower. He was also the great-great nephew of U.S. Senator and Governor of Mississippi James Lusk Alcorn.

He died of a stroke on January 13, 1992.

== Personal life ==
Alcorn was married to Marcia Powell Alcorn after the death of his first wife, Janet. He had only one daughter, named Eileen. His brother Howard W. Alcorn was chief justice of the Connecticut Supreme Court.

Meade was known publicly as &quot;Hugh M. Alcorn, Jr.&quot; for much of his career. He adopted the name &quot;Meade Alcorn&quot; for his campaign for lieutenant governor in 1948. His middle name was &quot;Meade&quot; rather than &quot;Mead&quot; to distinguish him from his well-known father.

<doc id="1271261" wikidata="Q7245574" url="?curid=1271261" title="Priscilla Alden">
<text>Priscilla Alden (, – ) was a noted member of Massachusetts&#x27;s Plymouth Colony of Pilgrims and the wife of fellow colonist John Alden ( – 1687). They married in 1621 in Plymouth.

==Biography==
Priscilla was most likely born in Dorking in Surrey, the daughter of William and step-daughter of Alice Mullins. She was only seventeen when she boarded the &quot;Mayflower.&quot; She lost her father, step-mother and her brother Joseph during the first winter in Plymouth. She was then the only one of her family in the New World, although she had another brother and a sister who remained in England.

John Alden and Priscilla Mullins were probably the third couple to be married in Plymouth Colony. William Bradford&#x27;s marriage to Alice Carpenter on August 14, 1623 is known to be the fourth. The first was that of Edward Winslow and Susannah White in 1621. Francis Eaton&#x27;s marriage to his second wife Dorothy, maidservant to the Carvers, was possibly the second.

Priscilla is last found in the records in 1650, but oral tradition states that she died only a few years before her husband (which would be about 1680). She lies buried at the Miles Standish Burial Ground in Duxbury, Massachusetts. The exact location of her grave is unknown, but there is a marker honoring her.

==Longfellow&#x27;s poem==
She is known to literary history as the unrequited love of newly widowed Captain Miles Standish, the colony&#x27;s military advisor, in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&#x27;s 1858 poem &quot;The Courtship of Miles Standish.&quot; According to the poem, Standish asked his good friend John Alden to propose to Priscilla on his behalf, only to have Priscilla ask, &quot;Why don&#x27;t you speak for yourself, John?&quot;

Longfellow was a direct descendant of John and Priscilla, and based his poem on a romanticized version of a family tradition although, until recently, there was little independent historical evidence for the account. The basic story was apparently handed down in the Alden family and published by John and Priscilla&#x27;s great-great-grandson Rev. Timothy Alden in 1814.

Scholars have recently confirmed the cherished place of romantic love in Pilgrim culture, and have documented the Indian war described by Longfellow. Circumstantial evidence of the love triangle also exists. Miles Standish and John Alden were likely roommates; Priscilla Mullins was the only single woman of marriageable age. The families of the alleged lovers remained close for several generations, moving together to Duxbury, Massachusetts, in the late 1620s.

==The Alden children==
Priscilla and John Alden had ten children, with a possible eleventh dying in infancy. It is presumed, although not documented, that the first three children were born in Plymouth, the remainder in Duxbury. The children were:

# Elizabeth. (1624/25–1717). Married William Pabodie (Peabody), a civic and military leader of Duxbury, where all thirteen of their children were born. They moved to Little Compton, Rhode Island, where Elizabeth died in 1717 at the age of about ninety-four. Their descendants were prominent in settling areas of Rhode Island and Connecticut. From Elizabeth&#x27;s line comes the individual most credited with spreading the fame of John and Priscilla far and wide, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow in his &quot;Courtship of Miles Standish&quot;.
# John (1626–1701). Moved to Boston and married there Elizabeth (Phillips) Everill, widow of Abiel Everill. They had thirteen children. He was a mariner and became a naval commander of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. He was a member of the Old South Church of Boston and his ancient slate headstone is embedded in the wall there. Perhaps the best known event of his life was when he was accused of witchcraft on a trip to Salem, spending fifteen weeks in a Boston jail. He escaped shortly before nine of the other victims were executed during the Salem witch trials. Alden was later exonerated.
# Joseph. (1627–1697) Moved to Bridgewater where he was a farmer on land purchased earlier from the Indians by his father and Myles Standish. He married Mary Simmons. They had a total of seven children. Joseph died sometime after.
# Sarah. Her marriage to Myles Standish&#x27;s son Alexander undercuts any idea of a long-standing feud between the Aldens and the Standish clan. In fact, there is much evidence to suggest that John and Myles remained lifelong friends or, at the minimum, associates. Sarah and Alexander lived in Duxbury until Sarah&#x27;s death sometime before June 1688. (Alexander subsequently married Desire Doty, a twice-widowed daughter of Pilgrim Edward Doty.) They had seven or possibly eight children. Their home Alexander Standish House in Duxbury still stands.
# Jonathan. Married Abigail Hallett, December 10, 1672. Lived in Duxbury until his death February 14, 1697. He was the second owner of the Alden House which he received from his father. The house then passed to his own son John, one of his six children. At his funeral oration, Jonathan was described as &quot;a sincere Christian, one whose heart was in the house of God even when his body was barred hence by restraints of many difficulties which confined him at home.&quot;
# Ruth. Married John Bass of Braintree, Massachusetts, where they lived and had seven children. Of the more illustrious descendants of this union came Presidents John Adams and John Quincy Adams. Ruth died on October 12, 1674.
# Rebecca. Married Thomas Delano of Duxbury by 1667, a son of Philip Delanoye, one of the original settlers of Duxbury. They had nine children. Died in Duxbury sometime after June 13, 1688.
# Mary. Married Deacon Samuel Allen, a union that produced at least one son, Joseph. Mary died in 1688. Joseph would go on to have several children of his own.
# Priscilla, born 1628. Married Captain John Thurber in 1645. They had 8 children. She died in 1692.

# David. Married Mary Southworth, daughter of Constant Southworth of Plymouth Colony. Died sometime during 1719. Six children. A man described as &quot;a prominent member of the church, a man of great respectability and much employed in public business.&quot;

==Legacy==

<text>Sigmund and the Sea Monsters is an American children&#x27;s television series that ran from September 8, 1973, to October 18, 1975, produced by Sid and Marty Krofft and aired on Saturday mornings. It was syndicated by itself from December 1975 to June 1978 and later as part of the &quot;Krofft Superstars&quot; show from 1978 to 1985.

The episodes included songs as part of the plot development. The character(s), generally Johnny, would sing a song about what he was thinking or feeling about something going on in his life, from things that made him happy to anxiety about girls.

While videotaping the first episode of Season Two, a hot light fell and started a fire. No one was injured, but the fire destroyed all of the sets and much of the costumes and other props. Most of Season Two was taped with minimal sets.

==Plot==
The show centered on two brothers named Johnny and Scott Stuart. While playing on the beach near Dead Man&#x27;s Point, the two of them discover a friendly young sea monster named Sigmund who had been thrown out by his comically dysfunctional undersea family for refusing to frighten people. The boys hide Sigmund in their clubhouse.
Plotlines were very simple and straightforward, usually some variation on the idea of Sigmund doing something silly to arouse attention, and the boys working to prevent him from being found by Sigmund&#x27;s brothers Blurp and Slurp who want Sigmund to scare people in order to impress their parents Sweet Mama Ooze and Big Daddy Ooze. The brothers also worked to hide Sigmund from humans such as their overbearing housekeeper Zelda and Sheriff Chuck Bevans.

==Characters==
===Main characters===
* Sigmund Ooze (performed by Billy Barty, voiced by Walker Edmiston) – A sea monster who was kicked out of his family for not being able to scare a human.
* Johnny and Scott Stuart (portrayed by Johnny Whitaker and Scott Kolden) – Two brothers who discovered Sigmund when they were playing at the beach

===Ooze Family===
The Ooze Family are a family of sea monsters that live out at Dead Man&#x27;s Point. They kicked Sigmund out after he would not scare a human. Most episodes would have them trying to harm Johnny and Scott to no avail. The Ooze Family consists of:

* Sweet Mama Ooze (performed by Van Snowden, voiced by Sidney Miller) – The matriarch of the Ooze family. Sweet Mama&#x27;s characterization was based loosely on Phyllis Diller.
* Big Daddy Ooze (performed by Joe A. Giamalva and Sharon Baird, voiced by Walker Edmiston) – The patriarch of the Ooze family. Big Daddy was a spoof of Archie Bunker from &quot;All in the Family&quot;. In the sixth episode of the first season, he is identified as &quot;Melvin Ooze&quot; by a tax collector.
* Blurp Ooze (performed by Larry Larsen, voiced by Walker Edmiston) – A brother of Sigmund. 
* Slurp Ooze (performed by Paul Gale, voiced by Walker Edmiston) – A brother of Sigmund. Slurp&#x27;s voice characterization was based loosely on that of the fictional character Gomer Pyle.
* Prince – The Ooze family&#x27;s pet lobster who acts like the family dog.
* Uncle Siggy Ooze (performed by Sharon Baird, voiced by Walker Edmiston) – An Uncle of Sigmund.

===Humans===

* Zelda Marshall (portrayed by Mary Wickes) – The overbearing housekeeper who watches over Johnny and Scott.
* Chuck Bevans (portrayed by Joe Higgins) – The local sheriff.
* Gertrude Gooch (portrayed by Fran Ryan) – A housekeeper who replaced Zelda during the third season. Gertrude was a tough USMC drill instructor. The boys were relieved when Zelda returned.
* Miss Eddels (portrayed by Margaret Hamilton) – The elderly neighbor of Johnny and Scott.
* Peggy (portrayed by Pamelyn Ferdin) 
* Leroy (portrayed by Stephen Ciccarelli)
* Jack Wild (portrayed by Himself) - The actor 
* Paul Revere (portrayed by Bruce Hoy)

===Other characters===
* Sheldon (portrayed by Rip Taylor) – A magical &quot;sea genie&quot; who lives in a shell that debuted during the second season. Unfortunately, Sheldon was a bumbler and his &quot;whammy&quot; spells seldom worked properly.
* Shelby (portrayed by Sparky Marcus) – A sea genie who is Sheldon&#x27;s nephew.
* Shelinor (portrayed by Peggy Mondo) – A sea genie who is Shelby&#x27;s mother.
* Dr. Cyclops (portrayed by Walker Edmiston) 
* H.R. Pufnstuf (voiced by Walker Edmiston)
* Dr. Blinky (voiced by Walker Edmiston) 
* Ook (voiced by Walker Edmiston)
* Unkunk (voiced by Walker Edmiston)

==Music==
The songs for the show were co-written by Danny Janssen, Bobby Hart and Wes Farrell.

A cover of the show&#x27;s theme song, performed by Tripping Daisy, is included on the 1995 tribute album &quot;Saturday Morning: Cartoons&#x27; Greatest Hits&quot;, produced by Ralph Sall for MCA Records.

===Album===

Eleven songs from the show were released on Johnny Whitaker&#x27;s album &quot;Friends (Music from the Television Series &#x27;Sigmund and the Sea Monsters&#x27;)&quot; (Chelsea Records, BCL1-0332).

All songs written by Danny Janssen and Bobby Hart, except where noted.

==Production==
&quot;Sigmund and the Sea Monsters&quot; was the first Krofft Saturday morning production that was produced for more than one season. Previous entries &quot;H.R. Pufnstuf&quot; (1969), &quot;The Bugaloos&quot; (1970), and &quot;Lidsville&quot; (1971) were in production with new episodes for only a single season.

&quot;Sigmund&quot;, however, did not follow the &quot;stranger in a strange land&quot; premise as many of the previous Krofft shows had done. Other Krofft shows that did not follow the premise were &quot;The Bugaloos&quot;, &quot;Bigfoot and Wildboy&quot;, &quot;Pryor&#x27;s Place&quot; and &quot;Wonderbug&quot;.

Costumes were created by Oliver Soublette.

One episode features an appearance by H.R. Pufnstuf and another that features Jack Wild (who played Jimmy on &quot;H.R. Pufnstuf&quot;).

The series was created and produced by Sid &amp; Marty Krofft and Si Rose.

==Episodes==
===Season 1 (1973)===
===Season 2 (1974)===
===Season 3 (1975)===
==Home media==
In the United States, the first season of the show was released on DVD in 2005 by Rhino Entertainment, featuring all 17 original broadcast episodes, uncut and digitally remastered. It was released again on September 6, 2011, from Vivendi Entertainment. Although there were plans for season two to be released on DVD, it was cancelled because of low sales. In Australia, the complete series was released in a region-free four-disk set by Beyond Home Entertainment. However this set (along with both U.S. releases of season one) are now out of print and hard to find.

==Reboot==
In 2015 Sid and Marty Krofft announced that Amazon was partnering with them to create an updated version of &quot;Sigmund and the Sea Monsters&quot;. In June 2016, the pilot was released. In late 2016, it was announced that the pilot was picked up for a first season. Production for the first season occurred over the first half of 2017. A teaser trailer was released at the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con. In this version of the series, David Arquette plays Captain Barnabus who believes sea monsters are real and devotes his life to capturing them. Instead of living with a housekeeper, the boys are spending the summer at their aunt Maxine&#x27;s with their cousin Robyn when they discover Sigmund. Seven episodes were released on October 13, 2017. The rest of the cast consists of Solomon Stewart as Johnny, Kyle Harrison Breitkopf as Scott, Rebecca Bloom as Robyn, Eileen O&#x27;Connell as Aunt Maxine, Johnny Whitaker as Zach, Mark Povinelli as Sigmund, Drew Massey as the voice of Sigmund, Meegan Godfrey as Blurp, Michael Oosterom as the voice of Blurp, Dan Crespin as Slurp, Victor Yerrid as the voice of Slurp, Lexi Pearl as Mama, and Donna Kimball as the voice of Mama.

<doc id="1271269" wikidata="Q2931349" url="?curid=1271269" title="CFJP-DT">
<text>CFJP-DT (channel 35) is a television station in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, serving as the flagship station of the French-language network Noovo. It is owned and operated by network parent Bell Media alongside CTV outlet CFCF-DT (channel 12). The two stations share studios at the Bell Media building (formerly the Montréal Téléport), at the intersection of Boulevard René-Lévesque Est and Avenue Papineau in downtown Montreal; CFJP-DT&#x27;s transmitter is located on Mount Royal.

==History==
The station was originally owned by the family of Jean Pouliot, then-owner of CFCF-TV. It was acquired by Cogeco in 2001 concurrently with Cogeco&#x27;s acquisition of the network. It was later acquired by Remstar in June 2008, which had been owned by Cogeco and CTVglobemedia but entered bankruptcy protection in late 2007. The network was renamed V the following year. It was later reorganized into a separate entity named V Media Group, which was still majority-owned by Remstar, with a minority share held by a trust controlled by Remstar&#x27;s owner, Maxime Rémillard. As an owned-and-operated station of the network, CFJP was part of V&#x27;s takeover by Bell Media on May 15, 2020.

CFJP formerly had a rebroadcaster in Rimouski, CJPC-TV channel 18, but this switched to being a semi-satellite of CFTF-TV in June 2007.

== Digital television and high definition ==
CFJP launched a high definition simulcast on June 4, 2007, and it&#x27;s available on Vidéotron and Cogeco cable in Quebec. It signed on over the air on channel 42 from their studio building in Montreal in December 2007. However, digital television receivers display CFJP-TV&#x27;s virtual channel as 35. After the analog television shutdown and digital conversion on August 31, 2011, CFJP-TV moved from its pre-transition channel number, 42, to its post-transition and old analog channel number, 35. Because of the placement of the digital broadcast antenna at a low elevation on top of a residential building in Montreal, the coverage area was greatly reduced as compared to its former analog signal, which broadcast from Mount Royal. Many viewers were no longer able to receive CFJP. The station moved its digital transmitter to Mount Royal on April 16, 2013, greatly increasing its coverage area.

<doc id="1271278" wikidata="Q3815531" url="?curid=1271278" title="Joseph Sadoc Alemany">
<text>Joseph Sadoc Alemany y Conill, O.P. (Spanish: José; July 3, 1814 – April 14, 1888) was a Spanish-born American Catholic prelate who served as Archbishop of San Francisco from 1853 to 1884. He previously served as the first Bishop of Monterey from 1850 to 1853. He was a member of the Dominican Order.

==Early life==
Joseph Alemany was born in Vic, Catalonia in Spain on July 3, 1814, to Antoni Alemany i Font and Miquela dels Sants Conill i Saborit. Alemany entered the Dominican Order in 1829 at age 15, studying theology at a convent in Vic and the Convent de Sant Domènec de Girona in Girona, Spain. He made his solemn profession of religious vows to the Dominicans in 1831.

In 1834, an outburst of deadly anti-clerical rioting in Spain prompted Reverend Tomasso Cipolletti, the Dominican grandmaster, to offer Alemany and other Dominican seminarians refuge in the Dominican convent in Viterbo, Italy. Alemany began studying at the College of St. Thomas, the future Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, where in 1840 he was made Lector in Theology.

=== Priesthood ===
Alemany was ordained a priest for the Dominican Order in Viterbo Cathedral in Viterbo, Italy, on March 11, 1837, by Archbishop Gaspare Bernardo Pianetti. During his studies in Rome, Alemany had an audience with Pope Gregory XVI.

The Dominican superiors sent Alemany to conduct missionary working in the State of Ohio in the United States in 1841. He was transferred to Nashville, Tennessee, in 1842 and then Memphis, Tennessee in 1845. He became a naturalized American citizen that same year.The Dominicans in 1847 appointed him as master of novices in Kentucky in 1847 and then in 1849 as prior provincial for the Dominicans in the American Midwest.

=== Bishop of Monterey ===
==== Preparation for departure ====
In 1849, Alemany traveled to Rome to attend a meeting of the general chapter of the Dominicans in Naples, Italy. His abilities as a missionary, plus his fluency in Spanish, had attracted the attention of the papal court at this time. Pope Pius IX appointed Alemany as the first bishop of Monterey on May 31, 1850,

On June 11, Cardinal Giacomo Filippo Fransoni summoned Alemany to a meeting and informed of his appointment as bishop. Alemany declined it because he had no desire to become a bishop. When Pius IX learned about Alemany&#x27;s answer, he ordered him to appear in a private audience on June 16. The pope told Alemany, &quot;You must go to California...Where others are drawn by gold, you must carry the Cross.&quot; Alemany accepted the appointment and was consecrated by Fransoni as Bishop of Monterey on June 30 in Rome at the Basilica of Sant&#x27;Ambrogio e Carlo al Corso. Alemany became the first bishop of California since it became an American territory.

When Alemany became bishop, his new diocese covered the states of California, Nevada and Utah. During the early 19th century, the Catholic Church owned thousands of acres of land in the Spanish colonies in California. However, the Mexican Government in 1835 expropriated and redistributed most of that land.

As a result, the new diocese of Monterey lacked both money and personnel. During the summer of 1850, Alemany visited England, France and Ireland, trying to raise money and recruit religious sisters. He did not have any success recruiting sisters until he arrived the Monastery of the Cross in Paris. He found three volunteers at the convent, including Sister Mary Goemaere, a Belgian novice.

Alemany, the sisters, and Reverend Francis Sadoc Vilarassa, another Dominican priest, left Liverpool, England in September 1850 on the &quot;SS Columbus&quot; for New York City. Alemany made stops in Baltimore, Philadelphia and Washington D.C. to preach and raise money. He originally planned to send all the sisters to a Dominican convent in Ohio, then decided that Goemaere should accompany him to California. The group finally sailed to Panama, traveled by mule and dugout canoe to the Pacific Coast, and took a steam ship to California.

==== Arrival in California ====
Alemany, Goemaere and Vila finally arrived in San Francisco in December 1850. After a short time in San Francisco, Alemany traveled to Santa Barbara and then Monterey, California. Vilarassa in 1851 established the province of the Holy Name of Jesus, the first Dominican province in the Western United States.

That same year, Alemany appointed Reverend John Nobili, a Jesuit priest, as pastor of the Santa Clara Mission, He would found the Santa Clara School in Santa Clara, California, for boys in 1851. It later became Santa Clara University.

In April 1851, Goemaere opened the Santa Catalina School for girls in Monterey. She established a convent that would become the Dominican Sisters of San Rafael. The Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur founded the Academy of Notre Dame for girls in San Jose, California, in 1851. It later became Notre Dame de Namur University.

In 1853, Alemany filed a petition with the Public Land Commission of the State of California for the return of all expropriated mission lands. He eventually received all the missions, their grounds and cemeteries, along with two large ranchos, or estates:

* Rando Cañada de los Pinos (College Rancho) in Santa Barbara County, comprising 
* Rancho Laguna in San Luis Obispo County, consisting of .

===San Francisco===
On July 29, 1853, Pius IX removed Northern California, Nevada and Utah from the Diocese of Monterey and established this area as the Archdiocese of San Francisco. He appointed Alemany as its first archbishop. At that time, the archdiocese had only three churches in San Francisco.

* Mission Dolores, established by Spanish missionaries in 1776, used by Spanish residents
* St. Francis of Assisi, erected for Catholic soldiers in 1849
* St. Patrick Church, established for Irish immigrants in 1851

As archbishop of San Francisco, Alemany presided over what became a multinational diocese, owing to the influx of people during the California Gold Rush. He established national parishes for San Francisco&#x27;s Italian, Irish, French, German and Mexican communities.

In 1855, the Jesuits opened St. Ignatius Academy for boys in San Francisco, It later became the University of San Francisco.

During the American Civil War, there was a division of loyalties in San Francisco between supporters of the secessionist Confederate States of America and those of the federal government. In the summer of 1861, federal supporters started pressuring Alemany to fly the American flag from all the San Francisco churches on Independence Day, July 4. While expressing dismay at the start of the war, Alemany refused to fly the flags.

Alemany in 1862 founded Saint Mary&#x27;s College in Moraga, California, for the education of the children of working people. He turned the operation of the college over to De La Salle Brothers in 1868.

In October 1866, Alemany attended the Second Plenary Council of Baltimore, a meeting of the bishops and archbishops of the United States in Baltimore, Maryland. The Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary founded Holy Name University for girls in Oakland, California, in 1868.

The Dominican Sisters of Mission San Jose were established in the archdiocese in 1876.In 1883, at Alemany&#x27;s request, Pope Leo XIII appointed Reverend Patrick Riordan as coadjutor archbishop to assist Alemany

==Later life==
Leo XIII accepted Alemany resignation as archbishop of San Francisco in early 1885. He then left San Francisco for New York City in early 1885. While in New York, he was introduced by William Rosecrans, a former congressman from California, to US President Grover Cleveland. After traveling in Rome, Alemany was granted an audience with Leo XIII, who appointed him as titular archbishop of Pelusium on March 20, 1885.

Alemany&#x27;s final destination was the Convent of Santo Domingo in Valencia, Spain. He spent the rest of his life working to rehabilitate the Dominican order in Spain. Alemany died at the convent on April 14, 1888. He was buried in the Church of Sant Domènec in Vic.

In 1965, the Archdiocese of San Francisco brought Alemany&#x27;s body back to California. Archbishop Joseph T. McGucken celebrated a requiem mass for him at the Old Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Immaculate Conception. His remains were re-interred in the Archbishops&#x27; Crypt in the mausoleum in Holy Cross Cemetery in Colma, California.

The following were named in honor of Alemany:

* Alemany Boulevard in San Francisco
* Alemany Maze in San Francisco
* Bishop Alemany High School in Mission Hills, California
* Archbishop Alemany Library at Dominican University of California in San Rafael

<doc id="1271282" wikidata="Q282839" url="?curid=1271282" title="Ear of Dionysius">
<text>The Ear of Dionysius () is a limestone cave carved out of the Temenites hill in the city of Syracuse, on the island of Sicily in Italy. Its name, given by the painter Michelangelo da Caravaggio, comes from its similarity in shape to the human ear. The name is also linked to echoes in the cave.

==Geology==

The Ear of Dionysius was most likely formed out of an old limestone quarry. It is 23 metres high and extends 65 metres back into the cliff. Horizontally, it bends in an approximate &quot;S&quot; shape; vertically it is tapered at the top like a teardrop. Because of its shape, the Ear has extremely good acoustics, making even a small sound resonate throughout the cave.

==Purpose==
This cave was dug in Greek/Roman times to provide water storage for Syracuse. A narrow tunnel was dug first. This tunnel was widened by digging down and sideways afterwards, giving the cave its unusual shape. The small narrow tunnel is still visible on the top of this artificial cave. An earthquake struck this area causing damage, and the cave became unusable for water storage afterwards.

The cave was named after Dionysius I of Syracuse who used the cave as a prison, and would listen to hear what his prisoners were saying about him through the echoes in the cave.

==History==
The name of the cave was coined in 1608 by the painter Caravaggio, who was shown the grotto by the mathematician, antiquarian and archaeologist Vincenzo Mirabella. It refers to the tyrant Dionysius I of Syracuse. According to legend, Dionysius used the cave as a prison for political dissidents, and by means of the perfect acoustics eavesdropped on the plans and secrets of his captives. Another legend claims that Dionysius carved the cave in its shape so that it would amplify the screams of prisoners being tortured in it. The sound-focusing effect can no longer be heard because access to the focal point is no longer possible. The visitors of the cave can however still hear the echo while they are in the Ear of Dionysius.

Because of its reputation for acoustic flawlessness, the Ear of Dionysius has also come to refer to a type of ear trumpet that has a flexible tube. The term &#x27;Ear of Dionysius&#x27; can also refer to surveillance, specifically for political gain.

== In popular culture ==
The cave is featured as the location of the tomb of Archimedes in the 2023 film &quot;Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny&quot;.

<text>Arturo Fortunato Alessandri Palma (; December 20, 1868 – August 24, 1950) was a Chilean political figure and reformer who served thrice as president of Chile, first from 1920 to 1924, then from March to October 1925, and finally from 1932 to 1938.

==Early life==

Arturo Alessandri was the son of Pedro Alessandri Vargas and Susana Palma Guzmán. His grandfather, Pietro Allesandri Tarzi, was an Italian immigrant from Tuscany who had arrived in Chile from Argentina in 1850. Alessandri’s father, Pedro, became head of the family at the age of 19; at the time of Alessandri’s birth, he ran an estate in Longaví. At the age of 12, Alessandri enrolled at the Sacred Hearts High School, where his brothers and father had studied.

At the age of 20, Alessandri began his legal studies at the University of Chile. In 1891, while studying, he participated in the newspaper &quot;La Justicia&quot;, which was opposed to then President José Manuel Balmaceda. After graduating in 1893, Alessandri married Rosa Ester Rodríguez Velasco, with whom he had 9 children.

In 1897, Alessandri began his political career, becoming a member of the Liberal Party and representative of Curicó, a seat he would keep for nearly 20 years. In 1915, already aspiring to the presidency, Alessandri challenged the senator of Tarapacá Province, Arturo del Río; he won a hard-fought victory, from where he earned the nickname of &quot;León de Tarapacá&quot; (&quot;Lion of Tarapacá&quot;).

In 1920, Alessandri was the Liberal Alliance candidate for president, narrowly defeating his opponent of the Coalition Party, Luis Barros Borgoño. With speeches favoring the working class, Alessandri alarmed Chilean conservatives, who felt their interests were in jeopardy. Since the opposition controlled the National Congress, Alessandri favored strengthening the executive power, which lacked political weight before the Congress (Parliamentary Era).

==First administration==
During most of 1924, Chile had been politically paralyzed by a conflict between the President and the conservatively controlled Congress, who refused to enact the laws that he submitted. On September 3, 1924, a group of 56 military officers protested for their low salaries, in the incident known as the &quot;ruido de sables&quot; (or &quot;saber-rattling&quot;). The next day the same group of young military officers led by Colonel Marmaduque Grove and Major Carlos Ibáñez del Campo, created the &quot;military committee&quot; to defend themselves from the government. On September 5, the &quot;military committee&quot; demanded of President Alessandri the dismissal of three of his ministers, including the Minister of War; the enactment of a labor code, the passage of an income tax law, and the improvement of the military salaries. Alessandri had no option but to appoint General Luis Altamirano, the Army Inspector General, as head of a new cabinet. On September 8, General Altamirano appeared in front of Congress to demand the passage of eight laws, including Alessandri&#x27;s labor code. Congress didn&#x27;t dare to protest, and the laws were passed in a matter of hours.

At that point, Alessandri felt that he had become just a pawn of the military and on September 9, he resigned, and requested asylum at the US Embassy. Congress refused to accept his resignation, and instead granted him a six-month constitutional leave of absence. He left the country immediately for Italy. On September 11, a military Junta — the September Junta — was established to rule the country in his absence.

==Second administration==
The September Junta was not homogeneous, and quickly a progressive wing, headed by Marmaduke Grove and Carlos Ibáñez del Campo, developed contacts with the &quot;Comité Obrero Nacional&quot; and others labour organizations who advocated for Alessandri&#x27;s return. This led to a coup in January 1925, directed by Colonel Grove who handed out the power to General Pedro Dartnell as interim president while waiting for Alessandri&#x27;s return. Dartnell formed the January Junta, before retroceding the power to Alessandri on March 20, 1925. Alessandri had a new Constitution drafted, and approved by plebiscite by 134,421 voters on August 30. The Constitution, which was promulgated on September 18, 1925, reinforced presidential powers over the legislative. Furthermore, Alessandri created a Central Bank, initiating the first rupture with laissez faire policies.

His second government began with the support of left-wing and radical groups. However, this second group began to distance itself from the President. In March 1925, Alessandri&#x27;s government repressed a demonstration, leading to the Marusia massacre, soon followed by La Coruña massacre. This break with the working classes caused him to try to maintain a right-wing-radical alliance until 1937, when it took a turn towards the left. In order to face the threats of a coup, Alessandri relied on the republican forces, entrusted with repressing any intent to revolt and never to get involved in politics. They were created shortly before Alessandri&#x27;s return, as a consequence of the civil movement. They functioned in secret and then publicly, marching in a great parade May 7, 1933, in front of the President, who saluted them. They auto-disbanded in 1936, having considered their mission complete. The President asked the Parliament on several opportunities for the state of constitutional exception, resulting in illegal actions, such as the famous burning of the &quot;Topaze&quot; Magazine issue No. 285, which depicted a caricature of Alessandri he considered offensive.

That time was also marked by the appearance of new violent occurrences, such as the rural rebellion of Ránquil and their bloody repression, and the Nazi-inspired National Socialist Movement of Chile of Jorge González von Marées. In the economic sphere, the recovery of the crisis of 1929 was begun with the work of the Treasury Minister Gustavo Ross, a pragmatic liberal who implemented a &quot;towards in&quot; approach to growth. With respect to nitrates, he dissolved COSACH and created the COVENSA (Corporation of Nitrate and Iodine Sale), a multi-faceted distributor and not a producer. He balanced the fiscal deficit with new taxes and resumed payment of the external debt, with losses for holders of Chilean bonds. When they reached a surplus, they focused on public works. The construction of the National Stadium in Santiago, inaugurated in December 1938, stands out.

The degree of Alessandri&#x27;s responsibility in the 1938 Seguro Obrero massacre has been a subject of speculation.

==Public life after the presidency==

His political life did not end with his presidency. Due to the death of the communist Senator of Curico, Talca, Linares and Maule, Amador Pairoa, he participated in a complementary Senatorial election and won, returning to the Senate on November 8. In 1949 he was reelected but this time for Santiago, while also chosen to be President of this body.

He was of vital importance in the presidential elections of 1942 and 1946, in the first by causing a division of votes of the liberals, supporting Juan Antonio Ríos, and in the second by presenting himself as a preliminary candidate of the liberals. He later yielded his candidacy to his son Fernando, resulting in the division of the presidential candidates of the right and conservative support for Dr. Eduardo Cruz-Coke, in turn favoring the victory of Gabriel González Videla. While President of the Senate of Chile, Alessandri died at the age of 82, on August 24, 1950, and was replaced by his son Fernando Alessandri. One of his other sons, Jorge Alessandri, was president of Chile from 1958 to 1964.

<text>CKMI-DT (channel 15) is a television station in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, part of the Global Television Network. Owned and operated by network parent Corus Entertainment, the station maintains studios inside the Dominion Square Building in downtown Montreal. Its primary transmitter is located atop Mount Royal, with rebroadcasters in Quebec City and Sherbrooke.

CKMI was established as Quebec City&#x27;s second station in 1957. Originally a private affiliate of the CBC Television network, It was the only English-language station in the heavily francophone city. It struggled to survive for most of its first four decades, in part because its potential audience was barely large enough to support it. In 1997, it was transformed into a regional Global station for Quebec with additional transmitters, including in Montreal. It moved most of its operations to Montreal that year, though it would nominally remain licensed to Quebec City until 2009. The station&#x27;s local news broadcasts have typically struggled in the ratings, never advancing beyond a distant second place.

==History==
===MI-5 in Quebec City===
The station launched on March 17, 1957, and was the second privately owned station in Quebec. It was licensed to Quebec City and aired an analogue signal on VHF channel 5. CKMI was originally owned by Télévision du Québec, a consortium of cinema chain Famous Players and Quebec City&#x27;s three privately owned radio stations, CHRC, CKCV and CJQC, along with the province&#x27;s first private station, CFCM-TV. The station&#x27;s studios were located alongside CFCM&#x27;s facilities in Sainte-Foy, then a suburb of Quebec City; CKMI and CFCM shared the same antenna, the first setup of its kind in the world for television. This allowed CKMI to sign on several months sooner than would have been the case under the normal engineering practices of the time and at a fraction of the cost. 

Upon signing on, CKMI became Quebec City&#x27;s CBC Television affiliate, taking all English-language programming from CFCM. Télévision de Québec had applied for an English-language station when a policy change at the CBC the previous year restricted CFCM to programming from CBC&#x27;s French-language network, Radio-Canada (now Ici Radio-Canada Télé), rather than selecting French- and English-language shows, as it had done since signing on in 1954. CFCM disaffiliated from Radio-Canada in 1964 when the network opened its own station, CBVT, but CKMI remained with CBC. In 1971, CFCM became a charter affiliate of a privately-owned French network, TVA.

Télévision de Québec was nearly forced to sell its stations in 1969 due to the Canadian Radio and Television Commission&#x27;s (CRTC) new rules requiring radio and television stations to be 80% Canadian-owned. The largest shareholder, Famous Players, was a subsidiary of American film studio Paramount Pictures. The CRTC had additionally denied a 1968 bid to sell CFCM and CKMI to Teltron Communications Ltd. In 1970, the CRTC ordered Télévision de Québec to present a plan for restructuring its ownership in accordance with the law or else it would take bids for replacement licensees. As a result, Famous Players reduced its shares to 20 percent by selling off to three Quebec City firms, allowing Télévision de Québec to keep CKMI and CFCM. The company renamed itself Télé-Capitale in 1972. Télé-Capitale was bought in two phases by La Verendrye Management Corporation in 1979 and 1982; citing a high debt load, the firm sold the businesses to the Pathonic Corporation of Montreal in 1984. The firm then became known as the Pathonic Network in 1986 before being purchased by Télé-Metropole (which changed its name to TVA) in 1989 and 1990.
CKMI faced severe financial problems for much of its history as a CBC affiliate. This was largely because the area&#x27;s anglophone population was just barely large enough for the station to be viable as a privately owned CBC affiliate; Quebec City, unlike Montreal, is a virtually monolingual francophone city. As early as 1962, during hearings before the Board of Broadcast Governors (forerunner of the CRTC) for a new French-language station in Quebec City, BBG counsel William Pearson described CKMI as one of the most unprofitable stations in the country. During licence renewal hearings in 1972, Télé-Capitale noted to the CRTC that it was keeping CKMI-TV going despite the lack of any path to profitability. This stood in contrast to its French-language sister station, CFCM, which was reported in 1973 to be the most profitable television station in Canada. 

CKMI&#x27;s three anchor-reporters, who produced the station&#x27;s three hours a week of local output, were the only English speakers at CFCM-CKMI, reflected in the numerous gallicisms that pocked CKMI&#x27;s newscasts. Indeed, CKMI&#x27;s reporters often struggled to find anyone who could speak English well enough to conduct an interview. There were so few viewers that one CRTC licence renewal hearing for the station was met with no public comment whatsoever. At one point in 1981, its highest-rated program attracted only 31,000 viewers, a fraction of the viewership of CFCM&#x27;s highest-rated program. It was not unheard of for French-language commercials originally produced for CFCM to air on CKMI when it was deemed too expensive to produce a separate English commercial. Despite this, Télé-Capitale had no qualms about keeping the station on the air, viewing it as a public service to Quebec City&#x27;s anglophone community. 

Over the years, the station served mostly as a semi-satellite of CBMT in Montreal. The only local program on the air by 1996 was a 30-minute weeknight newscast anchored by Karen McDonald, editor and co-owner of the &quot;Quebec Chronicle-Telegraph&quot;, the only English-language newspaper in the city. Many stories on the newscast, &quot;Inside Quebec&quot;, were in French because they were supplied by CFCM&#x27;s newsroom; McDonald, who left the &quot;Chronicle-Telegraph&quot; to work for the station known as &quot;MI-5&quot; before also returning to the newspaper four years later, recalled that CFCM&#x27;s reporters did not ask questions in English even when they were interviewing an anglophone. In the late 1980s, the newscast only attracted 5,000 viewers per statistics from the Bureau of Broadcast Measurement; McDonald believed that most of those viewers were francophones.

===Becoming a Global station===
On June 13, 1995, Télé-Métropole and CanWest Global Communications announced a plan that would transform CKMI from a &quot;de facto&quot; rebroadcaster of CBMT into the third major English-language TV service in the province, providing the first private competition to CFCF-TV. Under the plan, Télé-Métropole and CanWest would form a joint venture, TVA CanWest, that would own CKMI, and it would apply to build transmitters in Montreal and Sherbrooke. CanWest would own a 51 percent controlling interest in the venture. Because of the nature of the Quebec City market and Montreal being one of Global&#x27;s two major coverage gaps of the time (the other being Alberta, where it had affiliated stations), it was immediately evident that the primary goal of the venture was to get Global a foothold in Montreal, the country&#x27;s third-largest anglophone market. According to Mike Boone, the television columnist for &quot;The Gazette&quot;, CanWest would have stood virtually no chance of getting a licence for a Quebec station on its own and joined forces with Télé-Métropole to lend &quot;local clout&quot; to its bid.

Global had spent almost a quarter-century trying to get a transmitter in Montreal. When the network originally launched in 1974 as an Ontario-based network, original plans called for a transmitter in Maxville, near Cornwall. While it would have primarily served Hawkesbury, it would have provided a strong grade B signal to Montreal. However, the CRTC did not approve the Maxville transmitter with the others because it had previously issued a moratorium on new TV stations in Montreal. One columnist noted that language and political considerations meant the CRTC would not entertain such a service before Montreal had three French-language TV stations.

The TVA CanWest deal would take some time to be approved because of another proposed transaction. CFCF and Vidéotron had proposed an asset swap that would have given CFCF control of TVA and TQS while leaving all of Montreal&#x27;s cable systems with the latter company, and the CRTC announced it wanted to hear that proposal first. That logjam was resolved in April 1996, when Vidéotron acquired all of CFCF with an eye to spinning off its English-language holdings. It would not be until December of that year when the CRTC finally heard the CKMI application. TVA CanWest pledged a commitment of $165 million over seven years on new Canadian programming to the regulator if it won in Quebec City and proposed new stations for Calgary and Edmonton. Ahead of the hearings, CFCF vigorously fought the proposal, claiming any competition would reduce its value and jeopardize its community service initiatives; it called into question any pledge to produce regional programming, with CFCF weatherman Don McGowan noting that Quebec City was &quot;where 42 anglophones live today&quot;. A full-page newspaper ad from CFCF blasted the idea of Global being &quot;allowed to slip through the back door&quot; into Montreal, ominously threatening that it would mean &quot;no more CFCF 12 as we know it&quot;.

In November, the CRTC ruled against Global&#x27;s Alberta stations bid. At the hearing the next month, Izzy Asper took the CRTC to task, noting that English-speaking Montrealers were higher-than-average viewers of American stations available on cable. The CRTC approved the CKMI Global bid on February 27, 1997; on the same day, it also approved Vidéotron&#x27;s purchase of CFCF&#x27;s business contingent on spinning off the English-language stations and TQS.

Over the course of 1997, changes were made in preparation for CKMI&#x27;s relaunch. In Quebec City, CKMI would move from channel 5 to 20, to permit the CBC to take over the channel 5 facility for CBVE-TV, a full-time repeater of CBMT. The Montreal transmitter, originally assigned channel 67, was changed to 46. With the addition of CKMI, CanWest&#x27;s station group, the CanWest Global System, would have over-the-air coverage in every province except Newfoundland. This led CanWest to announce that it would rebrand its stations as the Global Television Network.

On September 14, 1997, CKMI formally disaffiliated from CBC and joined Global. Full-time programming on the Sherbrooke and Montreal transmitters began on the same day. A number of popular American shows purchased by CFCF but to which Canadian rights were owned by CanWest moved from that station to CKMI, where they lost half or more of their audience. The Montreal rebroadcaster was criticized for poor reception and a low effective radiated power: 4.85 kW, compared to 697 and 1,334 kW at the two other UHF stations in the city. As a result, in April 1998, the effective radiated power was increased to 33,000 watts. In 2002, Global bought out TVA&#x27;s remaining interest in CKMI.
The station shifted most of its operations, as well as the focus of its news coverage, to Montreal soon after the launch of the Montreal transmitter; however, it remained licensed to Quebec City, and its official main studio remained in Sainte-Foy. Over the course of the 2000s, Global cut back its presence in Quebec City and the Eastern Townships, leaving its Sherbrooke bureau unstaffed before closing it altogether in 2007. In 2009, reflecting what had already occurred in the preceding years, CRTC permitted CKMI to move its licence to Montreal, which also allowed the station to access local advertising in Montreal for the first time; the station changed its name from Global Quebec to Global Montreal at that time. CKMI&#x27;s main production facilities and news operations then relocated from a building shared with TVA on De Maisonneuve Boulevard East in Montreal to the Dominion Square Building, home of &quot;The Gazette&quot;, in Downtown Montreal.

On October 27, 2010, Shaw Communications completed its purchase of Canwest&#x27;s television assets after Canwest had entered into creditor bankruptcy protection in late 2009. As a result, Canwest&#x27;s television division became Shaw Media.

==News operation==

Global entered the Montreal news market in direct competition with CFCF and its highly-rated &quot;Pulse&quot; newscasts. Benoît Aubin of TVA was tapped as the first news director for Global in Quebec, and Heather Hiscox was the first anchor for Global&#x27;s supper-hour local news, which aired at 5:30 p.m. to contrast with the 6 p.m. &quot;Pulse&quot;. Reflecting the regional architecture of CKMI, the station originally had four reporters in Quebec City and one in the Eastern Townships. Mike Boone, television critic for the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot;, criticized the newscast&#x27;s lack of time for stories and felt that it was hampered by needing to provide regional stories not of much interest to Montreal.

In December 1997, CKMI debuted a daily entertainment magazine, &quot;Global Tonight&quot;, hosted by Jamie Orchard. However, in June, it axed those programs and its 11 p.m. news and sports programs, moving its evening news to 6 p.m. and reallocating resources to the creation of a longform morning show. The morning show, &quot;This Morning Live&quot;, debuted in 1998. It was another four years before Global began producing a late newscast again in Quebec. &quot;This Morning Live&quot; was canceled after a decade in 2008.

As part of Shaw Communications&#x27;s offer to take over Canwest&#x27;s television assets, Shaw promised to launch local morning newscasts on several Global stations, including CKMI. On January 28, 2013, CKMI-DT launched a three-hour weekday morning newscast, airing from 6 to 9 a.m.

While Global had gradually been introducing centralized newscast technical production, in 2015, it began to present entire local newscasts for Montreal from Toronto. Beginning that August, weekend newscasts were produced remotely from Toronto. Global Montreal also introduced a half-hour noon newscast, and extended its evening news to an hour.

As of May 2017, Global Montreal&#x27;s 5:30 p.m. supper-time newscast ranked second in the Montreal English TV market, with 28,000 viewers tuning in compared to CTV Montreal&#x27;s 189,000 viewers and CBC Montreal&#x27;s 27,000 viewers. Although CKMI was still far behind CFCF, its viewership numbers had risen significantly since 2011, when it finished at the bottom of the ratings with only 6,900 viewers and a three percent share.

In August 2020, evening anchor Jamie Orchard was laid off. In September 2020, CKMI cancelled &quot;Focus Montreal&quot; and replaced Orchard with Tracy Tong, who anchors from Toronto; this left only the morning newscast as being presented from Montreal.

On September 6, 2022, presentation of the 5:30 and 6:30 p.m. newscasts returned to the Montreal studio after the station named Aalia Adam the new anchor of &quot;Global News at 5:30&quot; and &quot;Global News at 6:30&quot;; Adam also anchors newscasts for the Maritimes.

===Notable former on-air staff===
* Heather Hiscox – news anchor (now on CBC News Network)
* Leslie Roberts – anchor (moved to CIII-DT in Toronto, resigned in January 2015)
* Jamie Orchard – weeknight anchor (laid off in August 2020)

<text>Lilliwaup is a small unincorporated community in Mason County, Washington, United States. It is located on the west shore of Hood Canal at the mouth of Lilliwaup Creek. U.S. Route 101 passes through the town.

==History==

The name &quot;Lilliwaup&quot; comes from the Twana word /sləláwap/, meaning &quot;cove, inlet&quot;.

The area was settled by early pioneers by 1854. The town was officially platted in 1890. The Olympic Exploring Expedition of 1890, led by Joseph O&#x27;Neil, made one of the earliest explorations of the Olympic Mountains and the first crossing of the southern part of the range. The expedition began at Lilliwaup, bringing men and supplies up Hood Canal. O&#x27;Neil hoped to find a practical route between Hood Canal and the Pacific Ocean. The party left Lilliwaup in June 1890, west to the North Fork Skokomish River and Lake Cushman. From there a number of smaller parties explored in various directions, including one group that made the first recorded ascent of Mount Olympus. The main contingent of the expedition reached Hoquiam in October 1890. O&#x27;Neil did not find the practical route he had hoped for, but advocated for the creation of a national park.

When O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s exploring expedition first arrived at Lilliwaup in early 1890 they found the town almost non-existent. A member of the party described Lilliwaup as &quot;a town with one house&quot;. But in September of the same year, when O&#x27;Neil again traveled to Lake Cushman via Lilliwaup more than 30 families had moved in. Soon after there was a store and two hotels. However, the townsite company went bankrupt a short time later and most of the people moved away. By the 1920s tourism was bringing new life to the region. The Lilliwaup Land and Resort Company was founded. There were reports that movie stars such as Mary Pickford, Charlie Chaplin, and others were interested in buying homes in Lilliwaup, but they never came and the resort company folded.

==Recreation==
A nearby fish hatchery keeps the local waters stocked with salmon, which draws fishing enthusiasts to the area in the fall.

A stairway provides public access to the round-rock beach, where picnicking, shellfish harvesting, fishing, and beachcombing are popular. Hood Canal oysters plucked from the shores are a local favorite.

<text>Khoo Swee Chiow (; born November 16, 1964, in Port Dickson, Malaysia) is a Singaporean adventurer, author, consultant, and motivational speaker. Khoo is the first Southeast Asian and the fourth person in the world to complete The Explorers Grand Slam, that is, the North Pole, the South Pole, and the Seven Summits.

==Expeditions==
Khoo climbed Mount Everest in 1998 as a member of Singapore&#x27;s first Mount Everest expedition. In 1999, he skied to the South Pole as the leader of Singapore first Antarctica expedition, covering a distance of 1,125 km in 57 days. In 2001, he climbed Mount Ararat in Turkey together with six other Everest summitters from Turkey, Colombia, the United States and Mexico as part of a Peace Climb project to raise funds and promote international friendship. In that same year, he climbed Shishapangma in Tibet becoming the first South East Asian to climb an 8,000-metre peak without supplemental oxygen.

In 2002, he skied to the North Pole with Arctic guide Paul Landry and a dog named Apu, after failing the previous year due to frostbite on a finger. Khoo becomes the first Southeast Asian and the fourth person in the world to complete The Adventure Grand Slam, that is, the South Pole, the North Pole and the Seven Summits. He lost his bid to sail around the world in 2003, as his expedition was canceled due to lack of funding during the SARS outbreak and Iraq War period.

In that same year, he cycled from Singapore to Beijing in 73 days covering 8,066 km. In 2004, Khoo attempted to climb Mount Everest without oxygen but had to turn back 400 metres below the summit due to exhaustion.

On December 5, 2004, he successfully swam the Straits of Malacca from Tanjung Rupat in Indonesia to Port Dickson, in 22 hours over a distance of 40 km. He had been inspired to perform this feat at the age of six, after watching a Japanese man who was the first man to ever swim across the straits, starting his swim in front of his house. His attempt at swimming the English Channel in the summer of 2005, however, was unsuccessful due to hypothermia.

On July 31, 2012, Singapore adventurer and motivational speaker Khoo Swee Chiow, 48, has become the first Southeast Asian to reach the summit of K2 in Pakistan. The Seagate Technology K2 2012 expedition saw Mr Khoo reach the summit on the morning of July 31 after a 32-day climb in sub-zero temperatures. He was accompanied by an international team of 10 other climbers.

== World records ==
In December 2005, broke the Guinness World Record of the Longest Scuba Submergence (controlled environment). Khoo spent 220 hours underwater as opposed to the previous record of 212.5 hours. The record was subsequently broken on August 30, 2009, by Cem Karabay and now stands at 240 hours.

== Personal life ==
Khoo was born on 16 November 1964 in Port Dickson, Malaysia and became a Singaporean in 1999.

==Bibliography==
In August 2003, Khoo published his first book called &quot;Journeys to the Ends of the Earth&quot;. His second book &quot;Singapore to Beijing on a Bike&quot; was published in June 2007.

<doc id="1271322" wikidata="Q2931605" url="?curid=1271322" title="CJNT-DT">
<text>CJNT-DT (channel 62) is a television station in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, part of the Citytv network. Owned and operated by network parent Rogers Sports &amp; Media, the station maintains studios inside the Rogers Building at the corner of McGill College Avenue and Cathcart Street near the Place Ville Marie complex in downtown Montreal, and its transmitter is located at Mount Royal Park, near downtown Montreal.

==History==

The station signed on the air on September 8, 1997, but had its roots in the 1980s as (TEQ), a public access ethnic cable channel. It had plans on moving over-the-air as early as the early 1990s, but was dogged by financial problems. Even after it signed on, its finances were in such a state that it never signed on earlier than noon. Part of the problem was that its effective radiated power was only 11 kilowatts, easily the weakest full-power station in Montreal and one of the weakest in North America—roughly on the same level as low-power UHF stations in the United States. This effectively limited its over-the-air footprint to the Island of Montreal, Jésus Island and a few areas on the mainland; even in those areas, its signal was marginal at best. Most viewers could only get a clear picture on cable.

Many shows that had aired on TEQ for many years did not make the cut for CJNT because they did not meet the standards for commercial broadcasting. However, many of the shows that did make it were of somewhat marginal quality. Its commitment to ethnic groups was questioned, especially late at night when it would frequently show English-language infomercials for a psychic hotline.

===WIC and Canwest===
Western International Communications bought CJNT in 1999. WIC owned Montreal&#x27;s CTV affiliate, CFCF-TV (channel 12), but was facing serious competition from Global, which had expanded into Quebec the same year CJNT signed on. WIC figured CJNT would give it much-needed leverage in Montreal. It planned to relaunch CJNT on the model of Canada&#x27;s first multicultural station, CFMT-TV in Toronto, with 60% ethnic content and 40% American content. However, WIC was only able to buy the shares of CJNT held by Marie Griffiths, as ownership of the rest of the shares was being contested in court. It was not allowed to make changes to CJNT&#x27;s license without majority ownership, and its plans became moot when Canwest bought WIC&#x27;s television assets in 2000. Canwest already held controlling interest in Global station CKMI-TV, which was licensed in Quebec City but had activated a rebroadcaster in Montreal and moved the bulk of its operations there. The CRTC forced Canwest to put CFCF up for sale. Well aware that Canwest had bought CKMI to get its programming into Montreal, the CRTC ruled that Montreal&#x27;s anglophone population was too small to permit a twinstick between CFCF and CKMI (CFCF was eventually sold to CTV). However, Canwest was allowed to keep WIC&#x27;s interest in CJNT, and bought the remaining shares.
Canwest had CJNT file for bankruptcy, and changed its conditions of licence to reduce the ethnic content to 60%. On September 8, 2001, Global relaunched the station with a mixture of ethnic, English and French language programming. The bulk of the English-language shows came from Canwest&#x27;s secondary television system, CH. For all intents and purposes, CJNT thus became the third CH station, and the only one actually licensed to a major Canadian city. Since there was no &quot;H&quot; in &quot;CJNT&quot; (unlike CHCH-TV and CHEK-TV), the CH in Montreal stood for &quot;Canal Horizon&quot; (&quot;Channel Horizon&quot; in English), although it changed its on-air brand name to just &quot;CH&quot; in 2002. The station remained a CH branded station until September 7, 2007, when Canwest decided to brand the station as &quot;CJNT Montreal&quot;, while CH programming rebranded as &quot;E! Montreal&quot;.

As a CH and later E! station, CJNT had many English-language American imports due to E!&#x27;s emphasis on American shows that could not fit onto Global&#x27;s schedule. Some of E!&#x27;s programming, including documentary-based shows such as &quot;E! True Hollywood Story&quot;, were dubbed in Spanish, Portuguese and Italian, to help partially fulfill CJNT&#x27;s ethnic programming requirements.

During that period, CJNT aired &quot;WWE SmackDown!&quot; on Thursdays and Fridays until 2009.

For much of 2003 and 2004, CJNT fought a &quot;commercial war&quot; with Burlington, Vermont&#x27;s Fox affiliate, WFFF-TV. Due to Canada&#x27;s &quot;simultaneous substitution&quot; rules, WFFF frequently moved syndicated reruns of &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot; around its schedule to keep its signal from being replaced with CJNT&#x27;s on Montreal cable providers during the show&#x27;s broadcast. However, whenever possible, CJNT, which was airing the same show, duplicated the move in order to maintain the signal substitutions. This resulted in a cat-and-mouse game in which the Montreal and Champlain Valley editions of &quot;TV Guide&quot; were often out of date before they were published. WFFF depends on advertising in Montreal for its survival, since Montreal is 10 times more populous than that station&#x27;s entire American viewing area.

===Channel Zero===
On February 5, 2009, Canwest announced it would explore &quot;strategic options&quot;, including possible sale or closure, for CJNT and its other stations in the E! system, saying &quot;a second conventional TV network is no longer key to the long-term success&quot; of the company. While Rogers Communications, owners of Canada&#x27;s other over-the-air multicultural television stations through the Omni Television system, seemed to be a logical buyer for CJNT, that company reportedly had no interest in expanding its conventional television holdings at the time.

On June 30, 2009, it was announced that Channel Zero Inc. would purchase CJNT and CHCH in Hamilton, Ontario from Canwest in exchange for $12 in cash and the assumption of various station liabilities. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) approved the sale on August 28 of that year.

Channel Zero took control of the station&#x27;s programming at midnight ET on the morning of August 31. On that date, CJNT disaffiliated from E! (which would shut down later that day) and adopted a new schedule featuring a mix of music videos and already existing local ethnic programming during the day, and foreign movies at night, and reverted to branding itself as simply &quot;CJNT&quot;. There was no American simsub programming for the first year. Despite initial plans calling for a majority of the music videos to be foreign, most would end up being English-language videos with a moderate amount of French and foreign language videos included. In addition, CJNT would add, in sparse amounts, additional programming during the 2009–2010 season, including &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It On&quot;, a mixed martial arts program; Ed the Sock&#x27;s &quot;This Movie Sucks!&quot;, a movie show featuring the former MuchMusic character alongside co-host Liana Kerzner and comedian Ron Sparks; and infomercials.
On June 14, 2010, Channel Zero announced it would be rebranding CJNT as &quot;Metro 14&quot; in the fall, to appeal to a wider urban audience; the &quot;14&quot; represents its cable slot on Vidéotron in the Greater Montreal area. In September 2010, CJNT began airing American network television series for the first time since Channel Zero took ownership, including &quot;Everybody Hates Chris&quot;, &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, and &quot;Nightline&quot;. In addition to the American network series, CJNT began airing the CHCH produced talk show, &quot;Sportsline&quot; with Mark Hebscher. On February 2, 2011, at 6 a.m. ET, the station officially rebranded as &quot;Metro 14&quot;, months behind the original announced date of fall 2010.

===Citytv Montreal===
Seeking to expand its television holdings, Rogers Media announced on May 3, 2012, its intent to acquire CJNT from Channel Zero, with plans to convert the station into an owned-and-operated station of its Citytv television system (was known simply as City from December 2012 to September 2018). Simultaneously with the announcement of its pending purchase of the station, Rogers also announced it had signed an affiliation agreement with CJNT, allowing it to begin carrying Citytv programming on June 4, 2012, while the sale still awaited approval. The deal gave Citytv stations in all provinces west of Atlantic Canada as well as the system&#x27;s first television station located east of the Greater Toronto Area; Citytv programming had already been available in Quebec via cable and satellite through distribution of the system&#x27;s owned-and-operated broadcast stations out of Toronto, Edmonton, Calgary, Winnipeg and Vancouver. The deal was announced at the same time Rogers Media was awaiting CRTC approval of its purchase of cable-only educational service Saskatchewan Communications Network (which had carried Citytv programming from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m. daily since January 2, 2012) from Bluepoint Investment Corporation, which effectively made CJNT Citytv&#x27;s seventh owned-and-operated station. Starting in the fall of 2012, the station began using the brand &quot;Citytv on Metro 14&quot; (later &quot;City on Metro 14&quot;) during Citytv programming.

Most Channel Zero-owned and -acquired programming was dropped at this time, aside from the weekday morning show &quot;Metro Debut&quot; (a Toronto-based program that primarily consisted of music videos interspersed with news, weather, and traffic updates), which itself was expanded to three hours. To comply with CJNT&#x27;s obligations to carry multicultural programming, the station also aired programming from Rogers&#x27; Omni Television system (particularly &quot;Omni News&quot;). Initially, the station did not carry Citytv prime time programming, with non-ethnic programming confined primarily to &quot;CityLine&quot;, and syndicated and Citytv original programming during the late afternoon, early evening, and overnight hours. Selected U.S. and Citytv original programming was added in prime time upon the start of the 2012–13 season, but continued to be accompanied by Omni programming.

In its purchase application to the CRTC, heard at a public hearing on November 7, 2012, Rogers requested to convert CJNT to a full English-language commercial licence with programming and conditions of licence similar to the company&#x27;s other Citytv stations. Alternatively, if the conversion were not to be approved, Rogers requested that certain of the station&#x27;s current conditions of licence regarding ethnic programming be relaxed. A separate application was heard as part of the same public hearing for a new Montreal multicultural station, CFHD-DT, filed by a group led by Montreal&#x27;s Nowrouzzahrai family; Rogers indicated that if CJNT&#x27;s sale/conversion and the CFHD licence were both approved, it would provide funding for, and make Omni programming available to, the new station. The CRTC approved both the sale and conversion of CJNT and the application for CFHD on December 20, 2012. With the conversion, CJNT is the first over-the-air station in Canadian television history to have its licensed format changed.

Rogers announced it would officially rebrand the station as &quot;City Montreal&quot; on February 4, 2013. It assumed the full City schedule on this date, and finally abandoned the &quot;Metro 14&quot; brand several weeks later. The station continued to air an hour of Omni programming mornings at 7 a.m. and at several other times on weekends until the fall of 2013, as CFHD had not yet launched. The station began introducing a new slate of local programming, including the three-hour morning show &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; on weekdays (which premiered August 26, 2013), and a weekly half-hour local sports show, &quot;Montreal Connected&quot; (later &quot;Sportsnet Central Montreal&quot;, which premiered May 30, 2013), which Rogers promised to the CRTC in its application to buy CJNT. In addition, an independently produced weekly series, &quot;Only In Montreal&quot;, began airing in July 2013.

On September 2, 2014, Rogers and Sportsnet announced that it had acquired English-language regional television rights to the Montreal Canadiens under a three-year deal. In addition to games that may be carried by City as part of &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;, CJNT served as an overflow channel for games not carried by the Sportsnet networks.

&quot;Sportsnet Central Montreal&quot; was cancelled in September 2017. A largely-identical program with the same panelists known as &quot;Montreal Sports Weekly&quot; premiered on CFHD shortly afterward.

==News operation==

Since its inception, under Canwest ownership, CJNT was the only station in the CH/E! system not to air any newscasts under the &quot;CH News&quot; brand.

Local evening and late-night newscasts under the branding &quot;CityNews Montreal&quot; launched on September 3, 2018, as part of an expansion of local news programming by Citytv&#x27;s owned-and-operated broadcast stations. Both newscasts air for an hour each. Similarly to the format of its sister station in Toronto, CJNT&#x27;s newscasts use an &quot;anchorless&quot; format, where all stories are presented by videojournalists on the field, eschewing in-studio anchors.

From August 23, 2013, to September 5, 2019, CJNT produced a local version of Citytv&#x27;s morning show &quot;Breakfast Television&quot;, which ran for three hours on weekdays. On September 5, 2019, Rogers announced that the show had been cancelled effective immediately after just over six years on-air. A company executive stated that the program was &quot;not sustainable&quot;. As of its most-recent license renewal, the station was no longer explicitly required to produce a morning newscast, with its commitments to local news programming now being fulfilled by the two nightly newscasts.

==Technical information==

===Subchannel===
===Analogue-to-digital conversion===
On August 27, 2011, four days before Canadian television stations in CRTC-designated mandatory markets were to transition from analogue to digital broadcasts under federal mandate, the station shut down its analog transmitter and flash cut its digital signal into operation on UHF channel 49, using virtual channel as 62. However, its digital signal operates at only 4 kilowatts – roughly equivalent to 20 kilowatts for an analogue signal. As a result, the station&#x27;s coverage area is not much larger than it was in analogue.

<doc id="1271337" wikidata="Q6416166" url="?curid=1271337" title="Kirsty Howard">
<text>Kirsty Ellen Howard (20 September 1995 – 24 October 2015) was an English children&#x27;s hospice advocate known for her fundraising efforts for Francis House Children&#x27;s Hospice in Didsbury, Manchester. As a patient of the hospice, Howard was the figurehead of the Kirsty&#x27;s Club (formerly known as the Kirsty&#x27;s Appeal), a charity dedicated for fundraising for the facility, which was severely underfunded at the time. Her efforts gained national support and attention. At the time of her death, she had raised over £7.5 million for the hospice.

== Birth and illness ==
Kirsty Howard was born on 20 September 1995 at the Wythenshawe Hospital, Manchester, to Lynn and Steve Howard of Northern Moor, the youngest of three sisters. Shortly after her birth, Howard was discovered to have a serious congenital heart defect: her heart was back to front, causing the misplacement of her internal organs. The condition, a form of situs ambiguus, is exceptionally rare and has an occurrence of one in 60 million; only one case was reported previously. After surviving 11 operations, including 9 heart surgeries, Howard was considered too fragile to receive anaesthesia and the only option was palliative care. She needed around-the-clock care, including continuous oxygen therapy through a nasal cannula connected to a cylinder. In February 1999, she was declared to have only six weeks to live and admitted to Francis House Children&#x27;s Hospice.

== Children&#x27;s hospice advocacy ==

Opened in November 1991 by Diana, Princess of Wales, Francis House Children&#x27;s Hospice is the fifth children&#x27;s hospice in the UK and one of the oldest around the world. Like most children&#x27;s hospices in the country, the charity receives little public funding and relies on donations extensively. By the time Howard was admitted in 1999, it was in severe financial difficulties and required at least £5 million (equivalent to £7.73 million in 2021) to continue its operation. Piccadilly Radio presenter Susie Mathis, who had been paying attention to the facility since its start, decided to take the challenge of designing a fundraising campaign with her team. Their first ad, which was designed by advertisement agencies, failed to receive attention despite appearing in several newspapers. Mathis realised that a real-life figure was needed to gain sympathy from the public and Howard became a perfect choice.

On 6 October 2001, Howard was the mascot for the 2002 World Cup qualifying match between England and Greece. Commentator John Motson called her &quot;the bravest person on the pitch&quot;, as she accompanied captain David Beckham onto the pitch with her 20 kg oxygen tank.

In 2002, Howard, along with Beckham, presented the Jubilee Baton to Queen Elizabeth II during the opening ceremony of the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester. Russell Watson released the single &quot;Nothing Sacred - A Song for Kirsty&quot; in December to help her fundraising and it reached a peak of number 17 on the UK Singles Chart.

In 2003, Howard started the inaugural Junior and Mini Great Manchester Run, and took part in the race herself, via wheelchair, wearing the Number 1 vest. She continued to do this throughout the history of the event, even after she became 16 years old when she was too old to officially take part in the event. She also joined the full 10 km race in her last years, pushed by her team.

In 2006, Richard Fleeshman sang for Howard on &quot;Soapstar Superstar&quot; and donated his £200,000 prize money to The Kirsty Appeal.
Howard&#x27;s new fundraising target was to raise a further £2,000,000 to build an extension to the Francis House hospice. This will not be named after her, but dedicated to her.

== Awards and honours ==
Howard was awarded the Helen Rollason Award by the BBC in 2004, for her courage and determination in her fundraising efforts. She also received the Child of Courage Award (2001) and the Pride of Britain Award (2002). For her efforts in fundraising, Manchester City Council gave Howard their Young Citizen of the Year award in 2007. In recognition of her contributions to her community, Howard was awarded the Diana Award; the certificate given to her by tenor Russell Watson at the secondary school she attended.

In September 2014 Howard received an &quot;Outstanding Achievement Award&quot; from the children&#x27;s charity Variety. In December 2014 Howard was named &#x27;Ultimate Woman of Courage&#x27; by Cosmopolitan magazine.

== Death ==
Howard died on 24 October 2015 at the Manchester Royal Infirmary with her family at her bedside after developing first a kidney infection and then a heart attack. Her funeral was held on 3 November at St Michael and All Angels Church, Northern Moor. Hundreds of mourners attended the funeral, including a number of celebrities.

She is buried at Southern Cemetery, Manchester.

== Legacy ==
A JustGiving page has been set up through the Kirsty Club at https://www.justgiving.com/kirstyclub/. The number one plate of Junior and Mini Great Manchester Run, which she always wore in the race, was retired in her honour.

<doc id="1271345" wikidata="Q4118311" url="?curid=1271345" title="Ayat al-Akhras">
<text>Ayat al-Akhras (20 February 1985 – 29 March 2002) was the third and youngest Palestinian female suicide bomber who, at age 17, killed herself and two Israeli civilians on March 29, 2002, by detonating explosives belted to her body. The killings gained widespread international attention due to Ayat&#x27;s age and gender and the fact that one of the victims was also a teenage girl.

Akhras was born in 1985 in the Deheishe Refugee Camp near Bethlehem, the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Her parents had fled or were expelled from Arab villages near Jaffa at the end of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War to settle in the Gaza Strip, and had moved from there to Bethlehem in the wake of the 1967 Six Day War. Her childhood experiences had likely radicalized her, leading her to join resistance organizations. During the 1987 First Intifada against the Israeli occupation, Akhras&#x27; oldest brother was jailed twice for attacking Israeli soldiers; and during the 2000 Second Intifada, members of her family were wounded and killed by the Israeli military. In 2002, a close friend and neighbor of Akhras that was playing with his toddler was hit by a stray bullet.

Akhras was a straight-A student and had hopes of attending college and becoming a news reporter. In 2001 she became engaged and plans were made for a wedding in July 2002. However, on 29 March 2002, Ayat al-Akhras was driven to the Kiryat HaYovel supermarket in Jerusalem by a recently recruited Tanzim member. Akhras detonated her explosives and killed two people: a 17-year-old Israeli girl named Rachel Levy and a 55-year-old security guard named Haim Smadar who had attempted to stop Akhras from entering the supermarket. In February 2014, Israel returned the remains of Ayat to her family as part of prisoner swaps, enabling them to arrange her funeral.

==Childhood and family background==
Akhras was raised in the Deheishe Refugee Camp near Bethlehem, the Israeli-occupied West Bank, the daughter of Palestinian refugees who themselves grew up in a tent camp in the Gaza Strip. Her parents had fled or were expelled from Arab villages near Jaffa at the end of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. After the 1967 Six Day War in which Israeli occupied Gaza, Akhras&#x27; parents migrated to the Dehaishe camp, described as &quot;a maze of cinder-block buildings, refuse-strewn alleyways and open sewers&quot;. Akhras&#x27; father found employment with an Israeli construction firm and was able to build a three-story concrete house, where Akhras and her four brothers and six sisters were raised. Akhras was a straight-A student and had hopes of attending college and becoming a news reporter. In 2001 she became engaged and plans were made for a wedding in July 2002.

==Radicalization and preparation for violence==
During the First Intifada against the Israeli occupation which started in 1987, Akhras&#x27; oldest brother was jailed twice for attacking Israeli soldiers. During the Second Intifada which started in 2000, members of her family were wounded and killed by the Israeli military. On 8 March 2002, a close friend and neighbor of Akhras that was playing with his toddler was hit by a stray bullet fired by Israeli troops as they were on a &quot;counter-terrorism&quot; operation.

These traumatic experiences may have influenced Akhras&#x27; attempts to join one of the Palestinian resistance groups. However, Israeli intelligence reports indicate that Akhras was impregnated by a Fatah operative, despite being an unmarried teenager, and that the emotional and social consequences of her unplanned pregnancy were the primary reason she decided to commit a suicide attack. Akhras first tried to join the ranks of Hamas, which turned her away because of a long-standing policy against allowing females to fight in physical combat. Hamas, which has claimed responsibility for many suicide bombings in Israel says that the basis for this rule lies in teachings of the Qur&#x27;an that says Jihad is the domain of the male. Despite this, Hamas and the Palestine Islamic Jihad (which generally also only recruits males) have since each used female suicide bombers. In 2002, the spiritual leader of Hamas, Sheik Ahmed Yassin made a statement to the press after Akhras&#x27; bombing saying that the group would only use women after they ran out of men.

However, Akhras found a group that would accept her: the Al-Aqsa Martyrs&#x27; Brigades, a group linked to the armed branch of Fatah (Yasser Arafat&#x27;s party), more secular than Hamas. The group already had experience, using at least three other women successfully in suicide bombings against Israel before Akhras. She was reportedly trained for several weeks before being sent to Kiryat Yovel, a south-western neighborhood of Jerusalem, to detonate in the supermarket. Before her attack, Akhras, like many other Palestinian suicide bombers, made a video in which she lashed out at the regimes and militaries of Muslim nations throughout the world. She said: &quot;I say to the Arab leaders, stop sleeping. Stop failing to fulfill your duty. Shame on the Arab armies who are sitting and watching the girls of Palestine fight while they are asleep.&quot;

==Bombing and victims==

On 29 March 2002, Ayat al-Akhras was driven to the Kiryat HaYovel supermarket in Jerusalem by the recently recruited Tanzim member Ibrahim Sarahne, who had once worked in the supermarket. The neighborhood is home to a mostly young population, young couples, students at the Ein Kerem medical campus of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, professors and teachers. The two crossed an Israeli checkpoint with the bomb in a bag on the car floor at Akhras&#x27; feet.

In the aftermath of the bombing, Sarahne said that during the drive he suggested that he just throw the bomb, which would allow her to return home. Yet, she replied &quot;&#x27;I&#x27;m not afraid. I want to kill people.&#x27; &quot; Akhras detonated her explosives and killed two people: a 17-year-old Israeli girl named Rachel Levy and a 55-year-old security guard named Haim Smadar who had attempted to stop Akhras from entering the supermarket. Smadar, who spoke Arabic, became suspicious after two Arabic women who usually sold vegetables outside the shop entrance were told by Akhras to leave. Smadar&#x27;s actions saved the lives of many, as Akhras would otherwise have exploded the device inside the supermarket.

In February 2014, Israel returned the remains of Ayat to her family as part of prisoner swaps, enabling them to arrange her funeral.

==Reactions==
The Al-Asqa Martyrs Brigade claimed responsibility in the press for the attack which the Israeli government denounced as an act of terrorism. The killings led the U.S. President George W. Bush to observe: “When an 18-year-old Palestinian girl is induced to blow herself up and in the process kills a 17-year-old Israeli girl, the future itself is dying, the future of the Palestinian people and the future of the Israeli people”. The European Union condemned &quot;firmly&quot; the terror attack. The Saudi Ambassador to the UK, Ghazi Abdul Rahman Algosaibi - a scholar and top politician in Saudi Arabia, wrote a poem in praise of al-Akhras, for which he was criticized by the UK and US governments, and among some Palestinians and Islamic militants, Akhras became a martyr (hero) figure, but the reaction among Akhras&#x27; family was mixed.

According to &quot;Newsweek&quot;, Akhras&#x27; fiancé did not approve of violence and would have stopped her if he had known her plan. &quot;May God forgive her for what she has done,&quot; he reportedly said. Other members of Akhras&#x27; family, which were educated and moderate, condemned suicide bombings as morally wrong. However, they said that Israeli &quot;brutality&quot; had left Palestinians no other choice.

==Novel==

&quot;Prima di Lasciarsi&quot; (&quot;Before We Say Goodbye&quot;) by Gabriella Ambrosio is a novel based on Ayat al-Akras&#x27; story, published in Italy in 2004 by Nutrimenti and was awarded at the Festival du Premier Romance in Chambéry, France. In 2008 the book&#x27;s publication in both in Arabic and Hebrew was sponsored by Amnesty International and employed by Israeli colleges and human rights organizations working in Israel and the Palestinian Territories as an educational tool. It has then been published in the UK, Australia, and in New Zealand by Walker Books, in France as &quot;Deuze Heures Avant&quot;(Gallimard), in Germany as &quot;Der Himmel uber Jerusalem&quot; (Fischer Verlag) as well as in Spain (Noguer), Turkey (Remzi Kitabevi), Greece (Psichogios), Korea (JoongAng) and China (Jieli publishing house). It is studied in universities in UK and Canada as an example of human rights literature.

==Documentary==

&quot;To Die in Jerusalem&quot; is a 2007 HBO documentary film about Ayat al-Akhras and her 17-year-old Israeli victim, Rachel Levy. The film documents the efforts of Rachel&#x27;s mother Avigail Levy to meet with Um Samir al-Akhras, the mother of al-Akhras. Um Samir al-Akhras refused to denounce her daughter&#x27;s action.

<text>Splendid was a musical duo of Angie Hart and Jesse Tobias, who at the time were also husband and wife.

==History==
They met in Canada, August 1996, when the Australian band Frente!, fronted by Hart, arrived to play over two weeks of support dates for Alanis Morissette&#x27;s &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; tour, Jesse&#x27;s band for the last two years – previously with Mother Tongue and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. After the tour, Frente! dissolved. Hart and Tobias married, and decided to form a band, the result being Splendid.

Splendid released its only album, &quot;Have You Got a Name for It&quot;, in 1999. To their dismay it was released only in Australia, with the American release cancelled by the record company (Mammoth Records) even though the discs had already been manufactured. Frustrated with the music industry, they thought the best approach was to produce their music independently. They divorced in 2005.

Splendid appeared on the television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; three times beginning with the episode &quot;I Only Have Eyes for You&quot; in which Hart sang &quot;Charge&quot;, to the episode &quot;The Freshman&quot; in which she sang &quot;You and Me&quot;. Hart also co-wrote (with the &quot;Buffy&quot; creator Joss Whedon) and performed the song &quot;Blue&quot; for the seventh season episode &quot;Conversations with Dead People&quot;. No other musical guest on the series was involved in more episodes.

<doc id="1271356" wikidata="Q5165060" url="?curid=1271356" title="Content Addressable File Store">
<text>The Content Addressable File Store (CAFS) was a hardware device developed by International Computers Limited (ICL) that provided a disk storage with built-in search capability. The motivation for the device was the discrepancy between the high speed at which a disk could deliver data, and the much lower speed at which a general-purpose processor could filter the data looking for records that matched a search condition. Development of CAFS started in ICL&#x27;s Research and Advanced Development Centre under Gordon Scarrott in the late 1960s following research by George Coulouris and John Evans who had completed a field study at Imperial College and Queen Mary College on database systems and applications . Their study had revealed the potential for substantial performance improvements in large-scale database applications by the inclusion of search logic in the disk controller.

In its initial form, the search logic was built into the disk head. A standalone CAFS device was installed with a few customers, including BT Directory Enquiries, during the 1970s.
The device was subsequently productised and in 1982 was incorporated as a standard feature within ICL&#x27;s 2900 series and Series 39 mainframes. By this stage, to reduce costs and to take advantage of increased hardware speeds, the search logic was incorporated into the disk controller. A query expressed in a high-level query language could be compiled into a search specification that was then sent to the disk controller for execution. Initially this capability was integrated into ICL&#x27;s own Querymaster query language, which worked in conjunction with the IDMS database; subsequently it was integrated into the ICL VME port of the Ingres relational database.

ICL received the Queen&#x27;s Award for Technological Achievement for CAFS in 1985.

One factor which limited the adoption of CAFS was that the device needed to know the layout of data on disk, and placed constraints on this layout. Integrating database products with CAFS often involved a change in page layout, making the integration very expensive, especially with the market trend towards use of third-party database software. Managing data integrity in a concurrent environment also required close attention, since a CAFS search would execute without any knowledge of locks and caches maintained by the database software.

ICL also produced a version of CAFS for its DRS minicomputer range called SCAFS (Son of CAFS). Unlike its mainframe cousin, this was implemented using custom firmware running on an industry-standard microprocessor. Software supporting third-party databases including Ingres, Informix and Oracle was marketed as the &quot;Ingres Search Accelerator&quot; (etc.). Each third-party product required modification, and was supplied with a dummy SCAFS interface library, to be replaced by the ICL product. The technology was also licensed to IBM for use with DB2 on the RS/6000. The device eventually became obsolete as processor speeds increased, removing the original justification for the device, namely that a central processor was not able to search data as fast as the disk subsystem could deliver it. Larger memory sizes also meant that many medium-sized databases could be kept entirely in memory. These factors removed any mass market for SCAFS and made it uneconomic.

<doc id="1271357" wikidata="Q6317342" url="?curid=1271357" title="Justin Barrett">
<text>Justin Barrett (born 13 April 1971) is an Irish far-right political activist, conspiracy theorist, and anti-abortion activist. As of April 2024, he was the leader of a group called &quot;Clann Éireann&quot;. He was leader of the National Party from 2016 until a leadership rift in July 2023 with his former deputy leader James Reynolds led to a dispute with both men claiming to be leader of the party.

Barrett&#x27;s activism began in the 1990s, with the anti-abortion campaign group Youth Defence. He campaigned against the Treaty of Nice in 2002 and founded the National Party in 2016. Barrett and the National Party campaigned for a No vote in the 2018 abortion referendum through the Abortion Never campaign, which functioned as &quot;an Irish nationalist anti-abortion campaign&quot;. Barrett has never held or been elected to any public office. He contested the 2004 European Election as an independent, receiving 2.4% of the vote in the East constituency and failing to be elected. Barrett also contested the 2021 Dublin Bay South by-election for the National Party, receiving 183 first-preference votes (0.68%), thus failing to be elected.

His early activism focused mostly on campaigning in Irish referendums from a Eurosceptic, anti-abortion, anti-immigration, and social conservative perspective. He subsequently however moved towards far-right politics with his involvement in the National Party. Barrett has attracted controversy for his involvement with neo-Nazi groups and for making racist and homophobic remarks. In September 2019, he controversially implied that, if in power, he would strip the Irish citizenship rights of local government politician Hazel Chu, in spite of the fact she had been born in Ireland and lived there for her entire life.

Since 2022, Barrett had publicly quoted Adolf Hitler&#x27;s Mein Kampf, performed Nazi salutes, engaged in Holocaust denial, spread antisemitic conspiracy theories and, in 2023, appeared at an anti-immigration protest wearing a Nazi uniform. In September 2024, he hailed Hitler as the greatest leader of all time. Barrett&#x27;s wife has also described the two as being national socialists. A statement on the National Party&#x27;s website in July 2023 stated he had been removed as leader and was replaced by James Reynolds. Barrett has denied being ousted from the National Party.

==Early life==
Barrett was born in Cork city in 1971 and was adopted when he was five years old by a family in Borrisokane, County Tipperary. Slevin was his adopted parents&#x27; name. He identified as Justin Slevin for a period but eventually settled on Barrett, his biological parents&#x27; name. Barrett is a graduate in Business Studies from Athlone RTC. In 1991, he appeared before a district court for shoplifting a pair of shoes from Dunnes Stores in Athlone.

==Political activism==
===Early activism (1987–1991)===
In 1991, he was involved in Young Fine Gael but left because of what he called the cynicism of the party.

===Youth Defence (1992–2004)===
From 1992 he became actively involved in the Irish anti-abortion movement, becoming the leader of Youth Defence. As a student in Athlone RTC he unsuccessfully contested the election for the Presidency of Union of Students in Ireland. During the 1995 divorce referendum, he was spokesman for the Youth Against Divorce campaign. In later years, Barrett himself sought a divorce in 2016.

In April 1999, Barrett and seven other Youth Defence members were convicted of public order offences for a protest described at the time as a &quot;mini-riot&quot; outside the Adelaide Hospital that had taken place on 16 May 1998. Despite requests from hospital staff, the son of a dying woman and Gardaí to be quiet, a Youth Defence protest outside the hospital got louder and lead to &quot;pandemonium&quot; when Gardaí intervened. Some of the convictions were successfully appealed, two years later, and while Barret&#x27;s appeal was disallowed, he was given the benefit of the Probation Act, meaning no criminal conviction was recorded against him.

He was also involved in the campaign against the 2002 abortion referendum. He left Youth Defence in 2004 because he thought their methods of campaigning and interacting with people were becoming increasingly extreme and counterproductive. By 2016, Youth Defence were claiming to have never heard of Justin Barrett, or ever to have had any dealing with him.

===No to Nice Campaign===
In 2001, a referendum was held in Ireland to approve the Treaty of Nice. However the Treaty of Nice was rejected by 54% of the Irish people in what is known as the Nice I referendum. The following year a second referendum was held on the Treaty of Nice, known as the Nice II referendum. Justin Barrett campaigned against the Nice Treaty in both referendums. Barrett, then 31 years-old, established the No to Nice campaign with Rory O&#x27;Hanlon, a retired High Court judge.

During the second Nice campaign, Barrett became the centre of a controversy over his participation in neo-fascist events in Germany and Italy. Barrett initially denied, and subsequently admitted that he had spoken at an event organised by the NPD, a far right, ultranationalist political party. Justin Barrett has always claimed that he spoke at these events in an anti-abortion capacity on behalf on the Youth Defence Organisation.

===2004 European Parliament election===
In 2004 Barrett announced his independent candidacy for the European Parliament election of the same year for the East constituency. He set up his headquarters in Drogheda, an area which had experienced a large influx of non-nationals. Gerry McGeough, a former Provisional IRA volunteer and Sinn Féin national executive member, defected to Barrett&#x27;s campaign. Barrett also supported the Citizenship referendum which was held on the same day as the European Parliament election.

Barrett&#x27;s campaign focused on immigration, Euroscepticism and abortion. Barrett employed nationalist rhetoric during his campaign and stated his intention to &quot;put Ireland first&quot; in the European Parliament. Barrett campaigned alongside his wife at the time Bernadette and their son Michael.

He achieved 10,997 first preference votes or 2.4% of the total vote in the East constituency and failed to be elected.

Later that year, while attending an immigration debate at University College Dublin&#x27;s Literary &amp; Historical Society, Barrett was assaulted by attendees allegedly belonging to an Irish anti-fascist group. The debate was chaired by popular RTÉ radio presenter Joe Duffy, and featured Áine Ní Chonaill of Immigration Control Platform.

===National Party (2016–2023)===
In a press release in November 2016, Justin Barrett announced that he was President of the newly founded National Party, a political party that would oppose multi-culturalism and abortion. While Barrett had previously promoted the idea of a &quot;Catholic republic&quot;, the National Party states that it is a secular party. The party was due to be publicly launched in a press event on 17 November 2016 at the Merrion Hotel in Dublin. However, after a public backlash, the hotel cancelled the event. Barrett called for a complete ban on Muslims entering Ireland and for the introduction of racial profiling. The party formally registered in early April 2019. Barrett has stated that the party is &quot;only for straight Irish people&quot;.

While a Eurosceptic, Barrett does not advocate leaving the European Union (&quot;Irexit&quot;). Quoted in August 2019, Barrett reputedly believes that Ireland could have entered bilateral negotiations with the United Kingdom immediately after the Brexit referendum in 2016 and agreed to a separate deal with the British and then to have the EU accept that deal as part of their own negotiations with the British government. He criticised the Irish government and by extension the European Union&#x27;s handling of Brexit. In September 2019, Barrett was milkshaked in Galway at a National Party protest. In October 2019 he addressed a community meeting in his hometown of Borrisokane on plans to open up a direct provision centre for 80 asylum seekers. An edited, audio-only version of his speech was played on the &quot;Claire Byrne Live&quot; show on RTÉ One.

As leader of the party, Barrett led the National Party to a total of 4,773 votes (0.2%) in the 2020 Irish general election, failing to win any seats.

In mid-July 2023, the National Party reportedly issued a statement saying Barrett had been removed as president of the party. Barrett disputed this and claims to still lead the party. Following his purported removal, he reported two senior members to the Gardaí for allegedly removing €400,000 worth of gold owned by the party from a vault in Dublin 4.

In late September 2023, James Reynolds, who also claims the leadership of the party, released a statement via the official party website outlining reasons for Barrett&#x27;s alleged dismissal, which highlighted his &quot;immense character flaws, outrageous decisions, and lack of interest in serious political activities&quot; as well as having &quot;no medium or long-term vision apart from a fanciful belief in an impending economic Armageddon which would inexplicably propel the National Party to power&quot;.

===2018 Irish abortion referendum===
Barrett founded Abortion Never as a No campaign in March 2018 to contest the Irish abortion referendum, 2018. Abortion Never presents itself as &quot;an Irish nationalist anti-abortion campaign&quot;. At the launch of the campaign, Barrett stated that if the abortion referendum passed, it would lead to euthanasia for the elderly; &quot;It doesn’t just begin with abortion and stop there. It ends in euthanasia, because they already have a plan. You see discussions in the newspapers sometimes, ‘What are we going to do about the pensions crisis?’&quot;. At the same event, he called for the abortion referendum campaign to be &quot;as divisive as possible&quot;. Ultimately, the referendum was approved by 66.4% of voters, with a 64.1% turnout.

In April 2018, Jim Jefferies featured Barrett on a segment of The Jim Jefferies Show. Jefferies had Barrett travel to London for an interview on abortion (despite already being in Ireland to interview Tara Flynn), &quot;so he could endure the same kind of bullshit every Irish woman has to go through if they want an abortion&quot;.

===2021 Dublin Bay South by-election===
In June 2021, he announced he would be running for public office for the first time as leader of the National Party, in the 2021 Dublin Bay South by-election, caused by the resignation of Eoghan Murphy. Using the campaign slogan &quot;Right So Far&quot;, he finished 11th of 15 candidates, gaining 0.68% of first-preferences, with 183 votes. He was eliminated on the third count. The seat went to Ivana Bacik of the Labour Party.

===2024 European Parliament election===
Barrett was a National Party candidate for the Midlands–North-West constituency at the 2024 European Parliament election, in which he received 4,086 (0.6%) first preference votes. His wife Rebecca Barrett was a National Party candidate in the Dublin constituency. Neither of them were elected.

==Publications==
Barrett self-published a book in 1998 in which he set out his political principles and advocated the creation of a &quot;Catholic Republic&quot;. Entitled &quot;The National Way Forward!&quot;, in its text he described immigration as &quot;genocidal&quot;, and cited Hilaire Belloc, G. K. Chesterton and Arthur Penty as having been influential figures in his philosophical development. He also promoted the work of Father Denis Fahey. During the 2002 Nice Treaty referendum campaign, some of the ideologies in Barrett&#x27;s 1998 book &quot;The National Way Forward!&quot; were queried by those advocating a &quot;yes&quot; vote, and it was noted that the book had &quot;mysteriously disappeared from bookshelves during the campaign&quot;. Some commentators suggested that the &quot;Barrett controversy&quot; had shifted focus away from other issues and assisted the &quot;yes&quot; campaign.

==Controversies==
===Interactions with neo-Nazi and neo-fascist groups===
====National Democratic Party of Germany====
Barrett spoke at events organised by the neo-Nazi National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD) several times, and was the guest of honour at a NPD rally in Passau, Germany in 2000, in which anti-semitic speeches, peppered with quotes from Adolf Hitler were given, alongside claims that &quot;Germany was the biggest victim of the second World War&quot;, and at which hundreds of skinheads gave standing ovations to elderly Nazis.
 The NPD confirmed that they had been in contact with Youth Defence for at least 6 years before.

He attended two conferences, in October 1999 and 2000, organised by the youth wing of the NPD, the &quot;Junge Nationalisten&quot; (JN), alongside American white nationalist William Luther Pierce. The JN has spoken about how Youth Defence were an important part of their network.

The National Party and Barrett have stated that he addressed meetings all across Europe in his capacity as an anti-abortion speaker. He has stated that he regrets &quot;not being more careful&quot; regarding his attendance of events held by the NPD in Germany.

====Forza Nuova (Italy)====
In June 2001, the website of neo-Fascist group Forza Nuova reported that Justin Barrett had attended a number of their events in Italy (in Milan, and Bologna). He attended and spoke at a Forza Nuova meeting in Milan in November 2002. Barrett shared a platform with Roberto Fiore at a rally of Italian fascists at the Hotel Miramar on 20 and 21 July 2001, in the Italian city of Civitanova Marche. At the rally, Barrett was joined by Mario Di Giovanni, Youth Defence&#x27;s representative in Italy. A group of Forza Nuova students, led by the then 25-year-old Marco Gladi, visited Ireland in 2001 to &quot;study&quot; with Youth Defence. In an editorial on the Forza Nuova website, the movement calls itself a &quot;friend&quot; of Mr Barrett and praises his efforts to defeat the Nice Treaty.

=== Homophobic remarks and activities ===
In 2017, during the party&#x27;s first ard-fheis held at the Trump International Golf Links and Hotel Ireland, Barrett stated that the National Party was &quot;only for straight Irish people&quot; and defended perceived homophobic comments made by James Reynolds, causing guest speaker John Wilson to walk out of the event in protest.

In 2020, Barrett was involved in the organisation of protests against the Minister for Children, Roderic O&#x27;Gorman, and attended these protests alongside members of the National Party. O&#x27;Gorman had been attacked by members of the Irish far-right on social media after his appointment as Minister for Children, due to tweeting a photo of himself with Peter Tatchell at a Dublin Pride parade in 2018. Tatchell had previously attracted controversy for statements made in 1997 regarding the age of consent laws in Britain. Tatchell later clarified these remarks, saying sex with children was impossible to condone. &quot;This means I condemn it - I oppose adults having sex with children.&quot; During a protest, Barrett riled up the crowd against a group of anti-homophobia counter-protestors, causing attendees to rush at the smaller group of counter-protestors and resulting in Garda intervention.

O&#x27;Gorman said that he was unaware of the views expressed by Tatchell 20 years previously, stating he &quot;probably would have re-considered taking a photo with him&quot; had he read the 1997 letter before the march. He continued, &quot;I would have seen him primarily as an advocate for LGBT rights in the UK in the 1990s and 2002 but more recently particularly vocal on treatment of LGBT people in Russia and Chechnya.&quot; While Barrett alleged that O&#x27;Gorman was a &quot;paedophile apologist&quot;, O&#x27;Gorman has publicly stated his condemnation of paedophilia and stated that the accusations made against him were &quot;rooted in homophobia&quot;.

=== Racist remarks ===
In a September 2019 video, Barrett stated that if his party were to gain power he would revoke the Irish citizenship of Green Party councillor and later Lord Mayor of Dublin, Hazel Chu. Chu was born in Dublin and lived in Ireland since birth. Barrett stated, &quot;She is an Irish citizen, I accept that, that is the law until we get the law in our own hands&quot;. Later, a Twitter account operated by Barrett&#x27;s wife made disparaging and racist comments towards Chu. Chu, in response, stated that she refused to be intimidated by such tactics.

=== Garda investigation ===
In January 2021, a car being driven by Barrett was seized by Gardaí after it emerged it had not been taxed since November 2019. Barrett was investigated by Gardaí for alleged road traffic offences and breach of COVID-19 pandemic travel restrictions. In October 2021, in an appearance before Longford District Court, he was charged with driving without a licence or insurance, and with failing to produce both documents and an NCT certificate within ten days. Arising from the same incident, which occurred in Clonfin, County Longford, he was also accused of engaging in threatening and abusive behaviour contrary to the Public Order Act. He remained silent at the hearing and his solicitor said that he was reserving his position and made a motion for the disclosure of prosecution evidence. The judge granted the order and remanded Barrett on bail until a sitting of Longford District Court on 23 November 2021.

=== Pro-Hitler and pro-Nazi activities ===
In 2022, Barrett posted a quote from Adolf Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; on his Telegram page. His open admiration for Hitler led rival far-right leader Hermann Kelly to comment &quot;Justin Barrett is a completely different animal, where the vast majority of people in the National Party had no interest in national socialism or a fetish about Adolf Hitler but Justin did and Justin Barrett was the one who was quoting Mein Kampf, which is very damaging.” He has also given Nazi salutes, for which he was condemned by James Reynolds.

On 9 November 2023, Barrett appeared at an anti-immigration protest outside Leinster House wearing a Nazi SS uniform. When he attempted to give a speech, he was jeered. The &quot;Irish Examiner&quot; described it as &quot;a not particularly well received speech&quot;. He was denounced in a statement published by the National Party for engaging in a &quot;pathetic publicity stunt&quot; described as &quot;an effort to discredit the protest and grab a headline for himself.&quot;

On Holocaust Remembrance Day 2024, Barrett posted a short clip on his personal Telegram channel of an AI-generated image of Taylor Swift in an SS uniform, with a Swift song in the background, to the caption: &quot;Never Again is Now 27th January 2024, #HappyHolocaustRemembranceDay.&quot;

In September 2024 he reportedly described Hitler as the &quot;greatest leader of all time&quot;.

===2023 Dublin riot===

On 23 November he posted messages to Telegram saying &quot;1000 people are already at the spire. All hands on deck. Defend our kids.&quot; and &quot;I want the storm to break loose!&quot;

== Personal life ==
In 2004, Justin Barrett was married to Bernadette Barrett (née Carroll). Barrett divorced his first wife in 2017. Having previously campaigned against the legalisation of divorce, Barrett denied that he was being hypocritical, stating that he had &quot;changed his mind&quot; on divorce. 

Barrett later married Rebecca, a primary school teacher from Limerick, and they had five children . She has also been involved in the National Party and was a candidate in the 2020 Irish general election for the Limerick City constituency. She received 345 (0.7%) first preference votes and was eliminated on the second count. 

In November 2020, she responded to a tweet by then-Lord Mayor of Dublin Hazel Chu, placing a fake order for Chinese takeaway food with &quot;no bat&quot;. The tweet was widely condemned as racist and subsequently removed by Twitter for violating the platform&#x27;s rules.

Both Justin and Rebecca Barrett have reportedly posted &quot;pro-Hitler content on [..] social media&quot;, and also described themselves as &quot;Irish National Socialists&quot;.

<text>Mixx was a user-driven social media platform where peers could publish or find material based on their interests and location. It incorporated social networking and bookmarking, as well as online syndication, blogging, and personalization options. The service was sold to Chime.in in December 2011, and it was eventually shut down.

==Details==
Mixx was a platform that allowed its users to customize their web content by creating a personalized blend of text-based articles, images, and videos. The platform enabled users to search and discover media relevant to their interests and interact with other Mixx users.

Users of Mixx could influence the flow of incoming media and recommend relevant media to other users by submitting, commenting on, and voting for or against stories, photos, and videos within specific categories such as business, sports, and health. 

Mixx partnered with several online publishing outlets, including CNN.com, USA Today, Reuters, The Los Angeles Times, and The Weather Channel, to expand its reach and provide a diverse range of content to its users.

==History==
Mixx was founded in 2007 by Chris McGill. The holding company was Recommended Reading, Inc. of McLean, Virginia.
In June 2007, Mixx received initial funding from Intersouth Partners of Durham, North Carolina. As of December 6, 2011, Mixx domain redirects to Chime.in. At that time Chime.in provided a similar experience as Mixx.com once did. As of July 30, 2014, Chime.in has since ceased services.

<text>Picture Perfect Morning is the solo debut album by American singer-songwriter Edie Brickell, released in 1994. The video for &quot;Good Times&quot; was among the multimedia samples included on Microsoft’s &quot;Windows 95 Companion&quot; CD-ROM.

==Critical reception==

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; concluded that &quot;the music is severely compromised ... by Brickell&#x27;s singsong delivery and her apparent inability to convey anything more compelling than a pervasive sense of ennui... Though she sings of good times and hard times, pleasure and pain, her emotional input is every bit as modest as her vocal range.&quot;

<doc id="1271371" wikidata="Q1435221" url="?curid=1271371" title="Phantom of the Opera (1943 film)">
<text>Phantom of the Opera is a 1943 American romantic horror film directed by Arthur Lubin, loosely based on Gaston Leroux&#x27;s novel &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; and its 1925 film adaptation starring Lon Chaney. Produced and distributed by Universal Pictures, the film stars Nelson Eddy, Susanna Foster and Claude Rains. It was composed by Edward Ward.

The first adaptation of the source material to be filmed entirely in Technicolor, &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; was even more freely adapted than Universal&#x27;s silent picture. The film reused Universal&#x27;s elaborate replica of the Opéra Garnier interior, which had originally been created for the 1925 film. Despite mixed critical reviews, the film was a box office success. It is also the only classic Universal horror film to win an Oscar, for Art Direction and Cinematography.

==Plot==

Violinist Erique Claudin is dismissed from the Paris Opera House after revealing that he is losing the use of the fingers of his left hand. Unbeknownst to the conductor, who assumes Claudin can support himself, the musician has used all his money to help anonymously fund voice lessons for Christine Dubois, a young soprano to whom he is devoted. Meanwhile, Christine is pressured by Inspector Raoul Dubert to quit the Opera and marry him. But famed opera baritone Anatole Garron hopes to win Christine&#x27;s heart despite this. Christine considers them both good friends but doesn&#x27;t openly express if she loves them.

In a desperate attempt to earn money, Claudin submits a piano concerto he has written for publication. After weeks of not hearing any response about his concerto, he becomes worried and returns to the publisher, Maurice Pleyel, to ask about it. Pleyel rudely tells him to leave. Claudin hears his concerto being played in the office and is convinced that Pleyel is trying to steal it; unbeknownst to him, a visiting Franz Liszt had been playing and endorsing the concerto. Enraged, Claudin strangles Pleyel. Georgette, the publisher&#x27;s assistant, throws etching acid in Claudin&#x27;s face, horribly scarring him forever. Now wanted for murder, Claudin flees into the sewers of the Opera and covers his disfigurement with a prop mask stolen from the Opera house, thus becoming the Phantom.

During a performance of the opera &quot;Amour et gloire&quot;, the Phantom drugs a glass of red wine which prima donna Mme. Biancarolli drinks, knocking her unconscious and asleep. The director puts Christine in her place, and she dazzles the audience with her singing. Biancarolli, who suspects that Garron and Christine are responsible for drugging her, orders Raoul to arrest them, but he says he cannot because there is no evidence. Biancarolli says she will forget the affair only if Christine is replaced as understudy and her performance is not mentioned in the papers. The following night, the Phantom kills Biancarolli and her maid, and the opera is subsequently closed.

After some time, the opera&#x27;s owners receive a note demanding that Christine replace Biancarolli. To catch the Phantom, Raoul comes up with a plan: not let Christine sing during a performance of the (fictional) Russian opera &quot;Le Prince masqué du Caucase&quot; (&quot;The Masked Prince of the Caucasus&quot;) to lure the Phantom out into the open. Garron plans to have Liszt play Claudin&#x27;s concerto after the performance, but the Phantom strangles one of Raoul&#x27;s men and heads to the auditorium&#x27;s domed ceiling. He then brings down the large chandelier on the audience, causing chaos. As the audience and the crew flee, the Phantom takes Christine down underground. He tells Christine that he loves her and she will now sing all she wants, but only for him.

Raoul, Anatole, and the police begin pursuing them underground. Just as the Phantom and Christine arrive in his lair, they hear Liszt and the orchestra playing Claudin&#x27;s concerto. The Phantom plays along with the melody on his piano orchestra. Christine watches, realizing the concerto was written around the melody of a lullaby she has known since childhood. Raoul and Anatole hear the Phantom playing and follow the sound. Overjoyed, the Phantom urges Christine to sing, which she does. While the Phantom is distracted by the music, Christine sneaks up and pulls off his mask, revealing his disfigured face. At that same moment, Raoul and Anatole break-in. Claudin grabs a sword to fight them with. Raoul fires his gun at Claudin, but Anatole knocks Raoul&#x27;s arm, and the shot hits the ceiling, causing a cave-in. Anatole and Raoul escape with Christine, while Claudin is seemingly crushed to death by the falling rocks.

Later, Anatole and Raoul demand that Christine choose one of them. She surprises them by choosing to marry neither one of them, instead choosing to pursue her singing career, inspired by Claudin&#x27;s devotion to her future. Anatole and Raoul later go to dinner together.

==Development and production==

Universal first announced a remake of &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; in 1935. Set to be directed by Anatole Litvak, this version would have been set in modern-day Paris, and would have portrayed the Phantom as a psychologically wounded World War I veteran who was physically unharmed, but imagined that he was disfigured. However, development lingered as the studio faced financial problems that resulted in the ousting of the original film&#x27;s producer Carl Laemmle and his son, Carl Laemmle Jr.

Plans for the remake finally surfaced again in November 1941, when Henry Koster became attached to direct. Koster discarded the previous screenplay, and envisioned a new version of the story in which the Phantom was Christine&#x27;s father. Under Koster, the initial casting included Boris Karloff as the Phantom, Allan Jones as Raoul, and Deanna Durbin as Christine. Eddy was cast after leaving MGM for a two-picture deal with Universal. This led to Durbin refusing the role, not wanting to be compared to Eddy&#x27;s frequent film partner Jeanette MacDonald, who Durbin admired. Karloff also became unavailable, and Koster also considered Cesar Romero, Feodor Chaliapin, Charles Laughton and Broderick Crawford for the Phantom. Producer George Waggner eventually fired Koster from the project.

After Koster&#x27;s firing, Arthur Lubin was brought on to direct. Under Lubin, Koster&#x27;s subplot about the Phantom being Christine&#x27;s father was jettisoned, because it gave the romantic elements of their relationship incestuous overtones; yet the Phantom&#x27;s obsession with Christine is still not completely stated within the film. Lubin cast Rains in the film almost immediately, saying he was his &quot;only choice&quot; for the role. Foster, who had just left Paramount Pictures, was cast after meeting Lubin through a mutual friend, and auditioning for Waggner. Filming began on January 21, 1943.

&quot;Lux Radio Theater&quot; presented a radio adaption of the film on September 13, 1943. Nelson Eddy, Susanna Foster and Edgar Barrier reprised their roles from the film; Basil Rathbone replaced Rains as Erique Claudin. This presentation was produced and hosted by Cecil B. DeMille.

===Score===

The score was written by Edward Ward. For the &quot;Amour et gloire&quot; opera sequences, Ward adapted music from Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Symphony No. 4 and used themes by Chopin. He also composed an original theme song, &quot;Lullaby of the Bells&quot;, which was heard in the film as the Phantom&#x27;s piano concerto. The movie begins with a fragment from &quot;Martha, oder Der Markt zu Richmond (Martha, or The Market at Richmond)&quot; written by composer Friedrich von Flotow.

==Reception==
Contemporary reviews were mixed. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; panned the film for being &quot;watered down&quot; from the original, calling the opening sequence &quot;the only one in the film in which the potential excitement of the story is realized&quot;, while otherwise the &quot;richness of décor and music is precisely what gets in the way of the tale.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a vivid, elaborate, and, within its original story limitations, an effective production geared for substantial grosses&quot;. &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; called it &quot;a good entertainment, the sort that will direct an appeal to all types of audiences&quot;. David Lardner&#x27;s review in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; dismissed the film, calling it &quot;by no means a sample of the march of progress in the film world. The old version had Lon Chaney, who scared you plenty, and the new one has Claude Rains, who somehow doesn&#x27;t.&quot; A review in the &quot;Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; stated that &quot;rarely has a story so novelettish had such conscientious technical excellence lavished upon it&quot; specifically noting that &quot;it ranks among the screen&#x27;s highest achievements in sound.&quot; The review continued that &quot;The same careful effort-if not the same dazzling success-is apparent in casting, camera work, costuming and the numerous sets.&quot;

In modern times, the film has received more positive reviews. Rotten Tomatoes gave this version of &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; an average score of 76%, based on 21 reviews from critics. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Though it lives beneath the 1925 version, Claude Rains plays title character well in this landmark color version of the classic tragedy.&quot; &quot;Diabolique&quot; magazine said &quot;the story was reconfigured as a musical more than a horror saga... Once you accept that, this works well on its own terms and Lubin&#x27;s touch is assured; it looks splendid.&quot;

Lon Chaney Jr. was reportedly unhappy that the studio never seriously considered him to play the role made famous by his father, even though he was under contract to them. Chaney reportedly also resented Rains for his portrayal.

==Cancelled sequel: &quot;The Climax&quot;==
Following the success of &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot;, Universal announced that a sequel would be made, titled &quot;The Climax&quot;. Nelson Eddy and Susanna Foster were to return, along with Claude Rains as the Phantom, most likely meaning that his character survived the cave-in at the finale of the first film. The sequel, however, was cancelled due to story troubles and problems concerning the availability of Claude Rains. Universal reworked the film completely, so it is not related to &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot;; Foster stars in the film, alongside the original choice for the Phantom, Boris Karloff.

==Awards==
The film was nominated for four Oscars, becoming the only film in the studio&#x27;s horror franchise to be nominated. It ultimately won in two categories at the 16th Academy Awards ceremony:
* Art Direction (Color) (John B. Goodman, Alexander Golitzen, Russell A. Gausman and Ira S. Webb) (Won)
* Cinematography (Color) (Hal Mohr and W. Howard Greene) (Won)
* Music (Scoring of a Musical Picture) (Edward Ward) (&quot;Nominated&quot;)
* Sound Recording (Bernard B. Brown) (&quot;Nominated&quot;)

<text>Christopher Alan Kirkpatrick (born October 17, 1971) is an American singer, songwriter, dancer, music producer, podcaster, and actor. He founded the pop group NSYNC, in which he sang countertenor. The band has sold over 70 million records, becoming one of the best-selling boy bands of all time. Kirkpatrick was the lead singer in various songs including &quot;Thinking of You (I Drive Myself Crazy)&quot;, &quot;Together Again&quot;, &quot;The Lion Sleeps Tonight&quot;, &quot;I Thought She Knew&quot;, &quot;Just Got Paid&quot;, and many songs from their Christmas album, &quot;Home for Christmas&quot;.

In television, he played Chip Skylark on the Nickelodeon series &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot;. Kirkpatrick has also participated in numerous reality TV shows, including &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;, &quot;The Masked Singer&quot;, and &quot;Gone Country&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Kirkpatrick was born on October 17, 1971, in Clarion, Pennsylvania to single mother, Beverly Eustice, when she was 16 years old. She raised him on her own along with his four younger half-sisters (Molly, Kate, Emily, and Taylor). He is of Irish, Scottish, Native American, and Hispanic ancestry.

Kirkpatrick and his family grew up in poverty and on welfare, sometimes homeless and living out of a car, and had to move around a lot. As a result, he attended many different schools and lived in several states, including Pennsylvania, Ohio, South Carolina, and California. At one point, his family lived in a trailer during the winter with no electricity and a hole in the side of it, and his mother had to pile dirty laundry in front of it to keep the snow from coming in. Since his family could not afford to wash their clothes, he rarely had clean clothes to wear and had to sleep in the piles of dirty laundry at night to keep warm. Kirkpatrick recalls frequently going without food and not always knowing where their next meal would come from, often relying on food stamps, free school lunches, and donated items to survive. To help his mom cover the bills he began working on a farm while still in grade school. Due to his family&#x27;s financial problems and his ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder), Kirkpatrick struggled in school. 

Despite their financial struggles, Kirkpatrick&#x27;s family had a musical background: his mother was a vocal coach, his grandmother trained in opera, his grandfather was a country-western singer, and his aunts and uncles were all in bands. Kirkpatrick also showed a keen talent for music from a young age. In sixth grade, while living in Oil City, Pennsylvania, Kirkpatrick won the lead role as Oliver Twist in the city&#x27;s high school musical production of &quot;Oliver!&quot;. From then on, he began to study music more seriously, enrolling in gifted classes for music and learning to play a number of different instruments. In seventh grade, he moved to Dalton, Ohio, and attended Dalton High School where he continued his involvement in music, starring as Lieutenant Joseph Cable in his school&#x27;s production of South Pacific and appearing in many other musical productions throughout high school. In addition to musicals, Kirkpatrick participated in his school&#x27;s choir, and made the All-Ohio State Fair Youth Choir, which opened for New Kids on the Block at the Ohio State Fair. Besides music, Kirkpatrick also participated heavily in sports, including football, basketball, baseball, and track.

After graduating from high school in 1990, he moved to Orlando, Florida, to get to know his biological father, who offered to help him pay for college. He attended Valencia College, where he originally intended to pursue an acting career in theatre. However, he changed his major to music after receiving scholarships for his involvement in Valencia&#x27;s choir. While at Valencia, Kirkpatrick began forming various a cappella groups and arranging music to practice and perform at coffee shops. Later, he auditioned and became involved as a caroler for the Caroling Company, which eventually led him to a job as a doo-wop singer at Universal Studios. Kirkpatrick received his associate degree in music in 1993.

Afterwards, Chris received another scholarship to attend Rollins College where he studied music and psychology and worked performing at Universal Studios Florida as a member of a doo-wop group called The Hollywood Hi-Tones, as a photographer at Sea World, waiting tables at Outback Steakhouse, and as a local DJ.

==Career==
In 1994, while working at Universal Studios and singing in The Hollywood Hi-Tones (a throwback doo-wop group of aspiring singers and actors) Chris Kirkpatrick was introduced to Lou Pearlman through Charlie Edwards, a mutual friend that he had met in choir. Edwards had briefly been a part of the Backstreet Boys before quitting, and had heard that Pearlman was interested in financing another vocal group, so he passed the information to Kirkpatrick.

Originally, when the Backstreet Boys were forming Kirkpatrick was unaware about their auditions so he never tried out.  However, after hearing about what Lou Pearlman was doing with the Backstreet Boys (he was acquainted with Howie Dorough), Kirkpatrick became interested in doing more than just a cappella. When Pearlman finally met Chris Kirkpatrick and saw him perform in his doo-wop group, Lou immediately took an interest in him. They discussed the idea for Kirkpatrick to form a vocal group, which Pearlman promised to finance if Kirkpatrick could find other young singers to join him.

Kirkpatrick took the opportunity, and after over a year of searching and trying out different people he eventually recruited Justin Timberlake and JC Chasez (members of the 1990s &quot;Mickey Mouse Club&quot; revival), and the three formed the nucleus of NSYNC. Later, Chris recruited Joey Fatone who was also working at Universal Studios at the time. After some difficulty finding a consistent bass singer, the group eventually found Lance Bass through Justin&#x27;s vocal coach, and the group collectively came together in September 1995.

The group moved into a house together and began practicing their singing and choreography in a warehouse in Orlando for hours to help train their vocals and stamina. Shortly after Lance joined the group, they recorded their first performance at Pleasure Island in Orlando as their demo for record companies. Afterwards, Chris dropped out of Rollins College to pursue a music career with NSYNC in Germany.

=== NSYNC ===

With NSYNC, Kirkpatrick sold over seventy million records throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s. He sang countertenor/soprano and lead in various songs including &quot;Thinking of You (I Drive Myself Crazy)&quot;, &quot;Together Again&quot;, &quot;The Lion Sleeps Tonight&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s the Way Love Goes&quot;, &quot;I Thought She Knew&quot;, &quot;Just Got Paid&quot;, and many songs from their Christmas album.

Initially signed to Ariola Records in Germany, NSYNC&#x27;s self-titled debut album was released in Europe in 1997 and internationally the following year, selling eleven million copies. Their debut album produced a number of singles including &quot;I Want You Back&quot;, &quot;Tearin&#x27; Up My Heart&quot;, &quot;Thinking of You (I Drive Myself Crazy)&quot;, &quot;(God Must Have Spent) A Little More Time on You&quot;, and &quot;Here We Go&quot;.

On November 10, 1998, the group released a holiday album, &quot;Home for Christmas&quot;. The album peaked at number 7 and sold 2 million copies, with their most popular song being &quot;Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays&quot;. With this, NSYNC achieved the rare feat of having two albums in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 10 at the same time. Later the next year, the band had a series of highly publicized financial and legal struggles with Lou Pearlman. They were eventually released from their contracts with Pearlman in 1999 and signed with Jive Records.

NSYNC&#x27;s sophomore album, &quot;No Strings Attached&quot;, was released the following year and sold a record-breaking 2.4 million copies in its first week and by the end of the year had sold over 9.9 million copies making it the best-selling album of the year. The album produced 3 hit singles including &quot;Bye Bye Bye&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Be Me&quot;, and &quot;This I Promise You&quot;. Not only was &quot;No Strings Attached&quot; the best-selling album of 2000, but it was also the second-best selling album of the decade behind The Beatles&#x27; &quot;1&quot;.

NSYNC&#x27;s third album, &quot;Celebrity&quot;, was released in July 2001 and produced three hit singles: &quot;Pop&quot;, &quot;Gone&quot;, and &quot;Girlfriend&quot;. NSYNC&#x27;s Celebrity album sold 1,879,955 copies in its first week, making it the second-fastest-selling album in SoundScan history at the time, only behind the group&#x27;s previous album &quot;No Strings Attached&quot;. The Celebrity album featured more creative involvement from the group, who wrote and produced many of their own tracks, of which Kirkpatrick is credited for writing the song &quot;Falling&quot;.

After their Celebrity Tour, NSYNC announced in April 2002 that they would be taking a hiatus, and each member of the group began venturing into their own solo projects. Although NSYNC never officially broke up, they have not reunited, with mixed responses from members as to whether a reunion would ever happen. NSYNC&#x27;s last official performance was at the 2003 Grammys during their Bee Gees medley tribute, however, the band briefly came together to perform at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards during Timberlake&#x27;s Video Vanguard Award performance. 

In 2018, all five members reunited when they received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In April 2019, NSYNC reunited without Timberlake for a one-off performance with Ariana Grande for her headlining set at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.

In September 2023, a new NSYNC song, &quot;Better Place&quot; was announced following a reunion of the band at the MTV Video Music Awards. The song, part of the soundtrack to the movie &quot;Trolls Band Together&quot; was released September 29, 2023. In addition to their song, all five members also made cameos as trolls for the movie, which was premiered in the U.S. on November 17, 2023. As part of their reunion, they also recorded an episode of the show &quot;Hot Ones&quot; (released September 21, 2023) and reminisced while discussing their legacy.

=== Solo music ===
After NSYNC disbanded, Kirkpatrick started working on several musical projects, including writing and singing lead for his alternative rock band &quot;Nigel&#x27;s 11&quot; (also written as &quot;Nigels 11&quot; or &quot;Nigels11&quot;). Nigel&#x27;s 11 was an American alternative rock band officially formed in Florida in 2007 by Chris Kirkpatrick, and consisted of Chris Kirkpatrick (lead vocalist), Mike Bosch (guitar), Dave Carreiro (bass), and Ernie Longoria (drums). The band was originally called The Little Red Monsters when Kirkpatrick debuted their first songs at the April Fool&#x27;s Ball in 2004 before the group&#x27;s name and lineup changed.

Nigel&#x27;s 11 began working on their album in 2009 and released their first album, Clandestine Operation, independently in 2010. The album featured five original songs: &quot;Who Am I?&quot;, &quot;All The Way Around&quot;, &quot;Mr. Jealousy&quot;, &quot;Get Out&quot;, and &quot;Crazy Girl&quot;. The songs from Clandestine Operation focused heavily on themes of overcoming personal struggles and issues of self-identity. Kirkpatrick stated that his band&#x27;s sound was influenced by various 1970s and 1980s rock groups that he admired such as Electric Light Orchestra, Queen, and Boston.

Nigel&#x27;s 11 also made a number of other songs that were not included on their debut album, but were released either online or at live shows, including &quot;All She Wrote&quot;, &quot;Say You Will&quot;, &quot;Tokyo&quot;, &quot;Jodi&#x27;s Song&quot;, &quot;Everybody Gets Lost&quot;, and &quot;My World&quot;. Some of their music was also included in the soundtrack for &quot;A Christmas Snow&quot;, and included an original song, called &quot;All Alone&quot;, as well as a punk rock remix of a traditional Christmas song, &quot;O Come, All Ye Faithful&quot;.

Nigel&#x27;s 11 eventually stopped performing together due to geographical distance and Kirkpatrick&#x27;s busy schedule of managing and producing music for other artists at the time.

=== Television and film ===
In addition to his solo music, Kirkpatrick also became involved in voice acting, providing his voice for the famous popstar character Chip Skylark (a caricature of Kirkpatrick himself) on the animated television series &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot; on Nickelodeon. Having appeared in numerous episodes spanning from 2002 to 2009, his character did many songs such as &quot;My Shiny Teeth and Me&quot;, &quot;Find Your Voice&quot;, and &quot;Icky Vicky&quot;, and developed a significant fan following.

In 2007, Kirkpatrick agreed to host and star in the MTV reality show Mission Man Band alongside the late Rich Cronin of LFO as a favor to him as Cronin battled his leukemia. Also on the show was Bryan Abrams of Color Me Badd and Jeff Timmons of 98°. The show was about former boyband members of the 1990s forming a new group together and debuted on August 7, 2007. Kirkpatrick hosted the show at his Orlando house, and the guys formed the supergroup &quot;man band&quot; called Sureshot in which they recorded three original songs, including &quot;Story Of My Life&quot;, &quot;Withoutcha&quot;, and &quot;Work That Out&quot; and performed at local sporting events, charities, and fairs. The show&#x27;s last episode aired on January 1, 2008.

In April 2008, it was announced that Kirkpatrick would be a part of the second season of CMT&#x27;s show &quot;Gone Country&quot;. Kirkpatrick participated in &quot;Gone Country &quot;with other cast members: Sebastian Bach, Irene Cara (one episode), Mikalah Gordon, Jermaine Jackson, Lorenzo Lamas, and Sean Young. The show was hosted by John Rich of the country duo Big &amp; Rich. During the show, for which each contestant had to prepare and perform an original song, John Rich told Kirkpatrick that he had one of the strongest songs of the competition with &quot;That&#x27;ll Get Ya By&quot;, which he dedicated to his mother, who he said: &quot;held the family together&quot;. On the show, John Rich said that Kirkpatrick impressed many country fans when he stepped on stage and proved he had the writing skills and voice to be a successful country artist. The first place prize of having a record produced by John Rich and the promise of play from Kix Brooks on his radio show went to Sebastian Bach. However, John Rich congratulated Kirkpatrick on his success and told him he had the writing skills and voice to be a successful country artist and that he could see his song going number one as a country hit. The second-season last show episode aired on September 26, 2008.

In 2021, Chris Kirkpatrick participated in ABC&#x27;s &quot;A Very Boy Band Holiday&quot; with Joey Fatone, Wanya Morris, and other figures from prominent vocal groups. During the special, which aired on December 6, 2021, he sang &quot;Rockin&#x27; Around the Christmas Tree&quot; and provided his vocals to numerous other holiday classics.

In 2022, Chris Kirkpatrick participated as a houseguest on the third season of Celebrity Big Brother, which began on February 2, 2022, and was able to win an HoH competition before leaving the show. Kirkpatrick later competed in season eight of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Hummingbird&quot;. He placed second in his group, but ultimately lost to season eight&#x27;s winner Amber Riley as &quot;Harp&quot;, becoming the third contestant to be unmasked after William Shatner as &quot;Knight&quot; and Eric Idle as &quot;Hedgehog&quot;. In 2022, Chris Kirkpatrick was also featured on an episode of MTV Cribs.

Besides television, Kirkpatrick has also done some minor acting in films such as &quot;Trolls Band Together&quot; where he voiced Trickee, &quot;Sharknado 3&quot; where he played a lifeguard, and &quot;Dead 7&quot;, a 2016 western zombie film written by Nick Carter, where he played the role of Mayor Shelby.

=== Other ventures ===
In 1999, Kirkpatrick founded a clothing line called FuMan Skeeto, which was a cross between the urban and skater fashion trends of the time. His unisex line of clothing included casual items like T-shirts, shorts, cut-off shirts, long-sleeved jerseys, and hats. Fuman Skeeto also produced specialty clothing items for notable celebrities like Britney Spears as well as members of his own band. The clothing line ceased as of 2002.

In 2002 / 2003, Kirkpatrick was offered the role of Jesus in Broadway&#x27;s rock opera &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;. However, he turned down the role to spend some time away from the spotlight.

In 2004, Kirkpatrick founded his own non-profit organization, the Chris Kirkpatrick Foundation, which seeks to enhance the lives of underprivileged children in central Florida by providing health care as well as educational, developmental and monitoring programs, citing his own difficult childhood as his major inspiration for starting the foundation. In addition to these programs, his foundation also hosts annual events for children.

Since NSYNC, Kirkpatrick has also appeared in various music videos for other artists including &quot;Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous&quot; by Good Charlotte, &quot;2nd Sucks&quot; by A Day to Remember, &quot;Irresistible&quot; by Fall Out Boy featuring Demi Lovato, and &quot;Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays&quot; (2019 Version) by David Archuleta.

Currently, Kirkpatrick continues to write and produce music, work with charities, manage other artists, host and perform events across the country (including the Pop2000 Tour with O-Town, Smash Mouth, Ryan Cabrera, LFO, and Mark McGrath), co-host his podcast Name Drop with Brian McFayden, and has collaborated on songs with various artists, including David Foster (&quot;I Will&quot;), Blake Lewis (&quot;She&#x27;s Makin Me Lose It&quot;), AJ McLean&#x27;s project ATCK (&quot;Air&quot;), and Tony Lucca (&quot;Wiggle It Out&quot;).

==Personal life==
=== Relationships ===
Kirkpatrick kept his relationship status relatively private until 2010, when he started dating Karlyn M. Skladany. In October 2012, Kirkpatrick proposed to her in Capri, Italy. They married on November 2, 2013, at the Loews Resort Hotel in Orlando, Florida, with all his former NSYNC bandmates in attendance as ushers. In March 2017, the couple announced that they were expecting a child. His wife gave birth to his son on October 10, 2017.

In 2018, Kirkpatrick sold his half-acre estate (dubbed Casa Della Musica) in Orlando, Florida, after having moved to Nashville, Tennessee, in 2016, where he currently resides with his wife and son.

=== Controversies ===
After Eminem&#x27;s arrest in 2000, Chris Kirkpatrick was quoted as saying: His arrest is karma. It&#x27;s really sad when people have to put everybody else down to make themselves look good. The guy&#x27;s digging himself a grave, and soon he&#x27;s not gonna have any friends. As a result, in 2002 Kirkpatrick was name dropped in Eminem&#x27;s hit song &quot;Without Me&quot;. The rapper told MTV&#x27;s Total Request Live that the reason he name dropped him was because Kirkpatrick was the only boyband member who had the guts to say something back to him, after the rapper attacked the group and boybands in general on his last album.

<text>Student affairs, student support, or student services is the department or division of services and support for student success at institutions of higher education to enhance student growth and development. People who work in this field are known as student affairs educators, student affairs practitioners, or student affairs professionals. These student affairs practitioners work to provide services and support for students and drive student learning outside of the classroom at institutions of higher education.

The size and organization of a student affairs division or department may vary based on the size, type, and location of an institution. The title of the senior student affairs and services officer also varies widely; traditionally in the United States, this position has been known as the &quot;dean of students&quot;, as distinguished from the academic dean or the deans of individual schools within a university. In some institutions today, student affairs departments are led by a vice president or vice chancellor who then reports directly to the president/chancellor of the institution. In other cases the head of student affairs may report to the provost or academic dean.

== History ==
Although institutions of higher education have had to deal with student affairs in some way for as long as they have existed, student affairs as a distinct professional field emerged first in the Anglo-American context in the late 19th century. There it developed from the originally distinct positions of &quot;dean of women&quot; and &quot;dean of men&quot;. The field developed much later in continental Europe, where development first began in the 1950s but was greatly spurred when the Bologna Process in the 1990s created a surge in international students with greater needs for student support. Similarly in many other countries where student affairs is still a largely inchoate profession, such as Uruguay, professional activity in the field has emerged in relation to the needs of international students.

=== Asian Pacific Region ===
In 1988, Asia Pacific Student Services Association (APSSA) was created after representatives of the Asia Pacific Student Affairs Conference recognized there was a need for more communication and partnerships between student affairs professionals and the institutions they worked for. The work that APSSA does focuses creating a space for international collaboration through conferences with internal attendees and training and staff networking programs through the Institute of Student Affairs (ISA). ISA is the standing committee for APSSA&#x27;s Executive Committee, and manages the planning and marketing for training and networking programs. In 2021, the Institute has five recorded Program Coordinators from different countries and regions: Japan, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Malaysia, and China. From 2018 to 2022, Maria Paquita D. Bonnet from De La Salle University in the Philippines was appointed to the position of Director of ISA.

APSSA holds a staff conference every two years where individuals from different countries will come together and encourage ideas for student affairs workers and offices to collaborate with one another. This conference allows for networking between organizations and staff and upholds APSSA&#x27;s goal of global collaboration. This society also holds a student conference, which allows for student leaders from participating countries to meet and nurture their leadership strengths together, while also allowing students to have a platform to share their thoughts and ideas for activities and careers.

=== Canada ===
Student affairs in Canadian higher education dates back to the vocational school established at the Collège des Jésuites in seventeenth century. Additional development of Canadian student services has many similarities with authoritarian teaching in terms of monitoring and controlling students behaviour on campus that was common in United States in nineteenth century. The protest that occurred at Queen&#x27;s University in 1875, when Principal William Snodgrass suspended several students for drinking, indicated a need for closer observation for students&#x27; conduct. After the Principal Snodgrass sent a report to the Senate, two students were suspended. They were allowed to attend the class, but could not graduate. Their friends appealed against the suspension, and refused to go to the class. Since the Senate rejected their request, all students returned to their class in a week. In order to prevent further misbehaviour, staff representatives started to be more engaged in students life organizing social, cultural and physical activities.

Several decades later, the Queen&#x27;s Rev Principal Robert Bruce Taylor emphasized importance of students representatives role by including deans of men and women to be elected and responsible for cooperation with administration, student events and regulations. They used to live on several campuses to supervise visitors, off-campus housing, dress code, etc. The first Dean of Women Caroline McNeil started at Queen&#x27;s in 1918 and soon, the other Canadian universities appointed dean of men and women on their campuses.

After the Second World War the professionalization of student affairs expanded by supporting soldiers who received tuition and living assistance based on Veterans Rehabilitation Act in 1945. Within the educational system, veterans received personal support and career counselling, but the other students were put on a side. While in the last seven decades Canadian student affairs has developed to support all students in financial need, career services, housing, residence life and academic advising, it was also reorganized frequently, e.g.:

* Canadian Association of Career Educators &amp; Employers (CACEE) in 1995; previous University Advisory Services (UAS) in 1946; University Counselling and Placement Association (UCPA) in 1952
*Canadian Association of College and University Student Services (CACUSS) in 1971; previous Association of University Student Personnel Services (CAUSPS-1) in 1953; Council of Associations of University Student Personnel Services (CAUSPS-2) in 1961

Today, CACUSS arranges conferences, develops network and discussion within postsecondary community, publish a national magazine Communiqué and remains the leader of Canadian student affairs professionals. The CACUSS has included variety of organizations that recognize the specific needs of all provinces including Indigenous students, students with disabilities, financial aid, academic integrity and judicial affairs, international students, etc.

Student affairs are also impacted by governance and decision making efforts in the form of students&#x27; unions at post-secondary educational institutions. In most provinces, students&#x27; unions are recognized as mandatory through legislation. In Ontario, these entities are formally recognized under Bill 184 2011 which acknowledges the autonomy of student associations in order to foster governance, accountability, and collaboration between student associations and post-secondary educational institutions, as well as addressing issues related to fee collection and remittance between these two parties. The impact that student associations can have on student affairs issues is exemplified by challenges to the Student Choice Initiative where the Canadian Federation of Students and the York Federation of Students challenged an initiative launched by the Ontario Ministry of Training, Colleges &amp; Universities. This particular initiative was aimed at providing students with the ability to opt-out of various supplementary fees during their enrolment process and also to provide them with a transparent itemization of their tuition and supplementary fees. The opposition by the Canadian Federation of Students and the York Federation of Students ultimately led to the successful overturning of the Student Choice Initiative, by the Divisional Court of Ontario. This event is noteworthy with respect to student affairs, because it demonstrates the impact that student associations can have on downstream funding necessary for delivering student services.

Canadian student affairs continues to develop and prepare professionals by recognizing demands of growing internationalization, diversity and sustainability in higher education. The specialization and further expansion is identified to focus on students&#x27; mental health, experiential learning, academic integrity and equity, diversity and inclusion to enhance their learning achievement and wellbeing.

===South Africa===

Student affairs did not become a unitary profession in South Africa until the end of apartheid in 1994. As in other countries of sub-Saharan Africa, South African universities have broadly followed an American model of student affairs administration. Difficulties in the implementation of student affairs principles from developed countries has been characterized as due to South Africa&#x27;s status as a developing country.

===United Kingdom===

Student affairs draws its origins on the Oxbridge model and the Anglo-American concept that schools stand &quot;in loco parentis&quot;, creating a greater legal obligation for the university to govern student life. However, professional student affairs administration in the United Kingdom is of relatively recent date: student affairs departments became a feature of all United Kingdom universities in 1992, having previously been widespread only in the new universities.

===United States===

The profession of student affairs &quot;grew from the campus up, not from theory down&quot;. Early higher education in the United States was based on the Oxbridge model of education; thus, most early institutions were residential and the tutors lived in the halls with the students. These men were the precursor to student affairs professionals in the United States. Typically, they served as dean of discipline and &quot;in loco parentis&quot; (in place of the parent). These early student affairs practitioners&#x27; focus was on control of the student as opposed to modern philosophy which focuses on the development of the student as a whole, but has always connected those interested in the welfare of students with students needing assistance.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as the number of land-grant institutions increased, enrollment expanded, student populations began to include women, the idea of vocationalism began to influence academics and the institution&#x27;s president began to be viewed as &quot;the chief moral front&quot;. With these changes it became apparent that additional staff members were needed to allow the president to respond to the issues of finance and faculty recruitment.

These first student affairs professionals were the dean of women, dean of men and personnel workers. Many of the early deans came from &quot;teaching roles in the liberal arts&quot;. The first dean of men was LeBaron Russell Briggs at Harvard University in 1890, with the first dean of women being Adelia Field Johnston in 1869 at the Oberlin College as lady principal and later named dean of women in 1894. Alice Freeman Palmer in 1892 at the University of Chicago was the first to hold the title of dean of women.

The dean of men&#x27;s position typically included discipline, but could vary depending on the institution&#x27;s overall philosophy. The position description might have read, &quot;that officer in the administration who undertakes to assist the men students [to] achieve the utmost of which they are individually capable, through personal effort on their behalf, and through mobilizing in their behalf all the forces within the University which can be made to serve this end&quot;. The one thing that remained consistent was the responsibility to deal with men and help them develop to their potential.

Deans of Women were trail blazers as women in positions of authority. Not only were women at colleges and universities a new development, but women as staff members even more new. The institutional leadership was dominated by men, but still they persevered including the founding of what is now the American Association of University Women (AAUW) in 1903.

In December 1918 Robert Rienow, the dean of men at the University of Iowa, wrote a letter to Thomas Arkle Clark, dean of men at the University of Illinois, suggesting a meeting that is now recognized as the founding of the organization now known as NASPA - Student Affairs Administrators in Higher Education.

In 1924, May L. Cheney, who organized a teacher placement office at the University of California, Berkeley, helped form the National Association of Appointment Secretaries (NAAS). That year, NAAS met for the first time and came as guests of the National Association of Deans of Women (NADW) to a convention sponsored by the Department Superintendence of the National Education Association. In 1929, forty-six NAAS members registered for the Sixth Annual Convention. NAAS became the National Association of Personnel and Placement Officers (NAPPO). The name American College Personnel Association (ACPA) was adopted in 1931. Association communication consisted of one mailed newsletter, the &quot;Personnel-O-Gram&quot; (P-O-G). In 1937, the Student Personnel Point of View statement was developed by leaders of the American Council on Education (ACE) and ACPA.

The Student Personnel Points of View, written in 1937 and 1949, further developed the area of student affairs.

In the 1960s the student development movement arose. Based on student development theory, it originated in the context of broad campus unrest during the 1960s. The aim of student development was to better integrate students into mass higher education and modern society.

In the 1970s the landscape of student affairs began to change when the voting age was lowered and 18-year-olds were granted adult status in the eyes of the law.
In the United States as early as 1992, student affairs began to see a change in the reporting structure. Chief student affairs officers began to shift to the provost, the chief academic officer.

== At community college ==
The work of student affairs is critical across all institutional types, but essential at a community college, an open access institution. While enrollment at community colleges are holding steady across the country, the students within this population require more assistance, both in and out of the classroom.

== Student affairs professionals ==
Student affairs professionals are individuals who serve in a supportive capacity and provide a variety of supports and services within higher education.

Roles range from service providers to senior leadership. Staff have diverse backgrounds and programs of study, bringing a wealth of knowledge and research aimed at best supporting students in their development during the course of their studies. Relying on current student development theories, they support the whole student (physical, emotional, and mental health). Challenges in meeting this goal include budget cuts, emotional strain, crisis-related issues, feeling devalued, and having to do more with less.

Student affairs professionals are often the first point of contact for students in crisis situations, which may include sexual violence, suicidal ideation, severe mental health episodes, hate crimes and discrimination. As first responders with exposure to traumatic information, they may be prone to occupational burnout and compassion fatigue.

=== Preparation ===

Some student affairs professionals and college student personnel (CSP) have completed graduate work with a complementary assistantship. An assistantship can be an entry-level position, but is usually a part-time paraprofessional position with compensation including tuition waiver, professional development and a stipend. These are sometimes called graduate assistant positions. The graduate program is usually two academic years of full-time study with opportunities for internship and abroad opportunities. Universities offer graduate programs sometimes called College Student Personnel (for example, at Bucknell University), Higher Education Student Affairs, or Educational Leadership which lead to a Master of Education (MEd), Master of Arts (MA) degree, or Master of Science (MSc) degree. Doctoral programs also exist for student affairs professionals, leading to a Doctorate in Education (EdD) or Doctor of Philosophy (PhD).

Student affairs professionals or college student personnel (CSP) graduate programs may include classes in psychology, business, law, communication, inter- and intra-personal counseling, higher education, and group dynamics. These help to form a foundation for creating relationships with students, faculty, staff, and parents. College student personnel programs tend to be found in departments of leadership, counseling, psychology and education. Traditionally these programs have an emphasis in administration, student development theory, or counseling.

There are also many other ways to learn more about and prepare for a position in student affairs. This can include completing certificates, reading prominent journals, volunteering or attending conferences for student affairs organizations (such as CACUSS or other professional organizations as listed below), and networking with student affairs professionals.

For Canadians looking to enter student affairs, some useful certificates to attain can include SafeTalk training, Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training (ASIST), Mental Health First Aid training, and Standard First Aid training. Additionally, it is important for student affairs professionals to have theoretical and practical knowledge and experiences in providing support and resources to students outside the classroom.

==== Identity development theories and psychological terms associated with education and student affairs ====

Developmental psychology and Student development theories used in college student personnel programs include:
* Chickering&#x27;s Seven Vectors
* Astin&#x27;s Theory of Involvement
* Komives, Owen, Longerbeam, Mainella and Osteen&#x27;s Leadership Identity Development
* Gilligan&#x27;s Theory of Moral Development
* Piaget&#x27;s theory of cognitive development
* Erikson&#x27;s theory of human development
* Tinto&#x27;s model of student retention

==== Student identity development of distinct minoritized groups ====

The student population in higher education is composed of many unique individual groups. Students from distinct minoritized groups may have different, yet established paths of student identity development. There are many theories of student identity development which describe identity development within distinct groups. Some examples of student development theories student development theories within distinct groups include:

* Racial Identity and Development
* Ethnic identity development 
* Sexual identity and development
* Gender identity and development
* Faith and spirituality identity and development 
* Disability Identity and Development
* Social Class Identity and Development
* Digital Identity and Development (see also Online identity)
* National Identity and Development
* Feminist Identity and Development
* Veteran Identity and Development
* Athletic Identity and Development

In equitable institutions it is important for Student Affairs professionals to understand the needs of the distinct groups that they service as well as their own social identity including privilege and bias.

==== Related Psychology/ psychological theories ====

* Maslow&#x27;s Hierarchy of Needs

== Areas ==

The functional areas of student affairs and services are considered by several professional associations including: ACPA, CAS, CACUSS, and NASPA. Growing research in the field of student affairs and services contributes to our understanding of how these functional areas are organized and operationalized. The composition and structure of these functional areas differs across various institutions, and continues to be shaped as new information is gathered pertaining to the needs of students in post-secondary education.

NASPA outlines 39 functional areas of student affairs and services:

* Aboriginal Student Services

Departments in Student Affairs may overlap or combine multiple functional areas into one office, especially at smaller institutions. Some departments can include:

===Academic services===
* Academic advising: Student academic services related to course selection, finding a major, study skills, and referrals to tutoring and academic success skills
* Student success/Academic support services: Intensive tutoring and academic success skill interventions with academic subjects such as math, business, or science as well as academic rigors such as essay writing, exam preparation, note-taking, reading, time management, and other academic subjects. Also see Writing center.
* Assessment and research: Focused on assessment, program evaluation, and research implementation in student services and other academic departments for both accreditation and continual improvement of student services and academic departments
*English language institutes: units that support students in developing their English language skills and competence through a combination of curricular and co-curricular programming. 
* Higher Education Opportunity Programs (HEOP)/Summer Bridge: Programs designed to support low-income, first-generation students, including students of color, in intensive academic advising and support either in the summer prior to enrollment and during the regular school year to increase graduation rates and close the attainment gap for poor/working class students and students of color

===Admissions, enrollment, financial aid, orientation===
* Admissions: Recruitment of undergraduate and graduate students (often separate offices) from first point-of-contact such as high school visits or college fairs to answering student and family admissions questions, to monitoring submission of applications, to reading applications and making admissions decision recommendations in collaboration with faculty
* Enrollment management: Relates to all aspects of incoming students and services provided to them; may include Financial Aid, Bursar, and Registrar.
* Financial aid: Assists students in post-secondary education affordability including information on the difference between grants, scholarships, work-study, and loans; processing federal and state/provincial government aid, payment plans; minimizing debt and understanding why student loans cannot be discharged; the benefits of federal versus private loans; loan repayment plans and employers/careers that will reimburse tuition and/or pay off student loans
* Orientation and First-Year Experience: Support and programming for first-year and transfer students, usually includes orientation and may include family relations

===Alumni and advancement/development===
* Alumni services: Focuses on graduated students&#x27; interests, needs, activities, and information, as well as fundraising
* Development/Advancement services: Development or advancement of the college/university mission through fund-raising including capital campaigns and lobbying work with legislatures in public colleges and universities to provide greater support for public education
*Student Alumni Associations play a major role in many Alumni Services teams. These Associations typically aim to bring together current students with alumni through a variety of programming. Programming may address a variety of topics including the career journey, networking, building personal and professional skills, and building affinity to the school. Members of the Student Alumni Association act as representatives of their school at these events. Student Alumni Association programming is usually open for part-time and full-time students.
**Student Alumni Associations usually fall under the Alumni and Development Teams. This is because there is often an aspect of building and promoting a culture of philanthropy within these Associations. Running a &quot;Graduating Class Gifts&quot; program. Many Universities across Canada (example Wilfird Lauier University, Concordia University, University of Northern British Columbia, Schulich School of Business at York University). Although there is a growing trend of having Student Alumni Associations, they are not found at many post-secondary institutions.

=== Athletics and recreation ===
* Athletics: Includes student services for student athletes in intercollegiate athletics including advising, monitoring, and support of student scholarships and student academic, career, and personal-social development
* Campus Recreation encompasses a variety of programs including organized activities such as dance classes, group fitness classes, intramural sport leagues, sports clubs, indoor rock climbing, and outdoor activities for promoting wellness. In recreation or fitness centres other casual or drop-in recreation activities include weight rooms, pools, exercise equipment, and noncredit classes. Participation in campus recreation has been positively correlated with student recruitment and retention, and academic success. The National Intramural and Recreation Sports Association (NIRSA) is a governing body for collegiate recreation both in the United States and Canada. The association&#x27;s main goal is to support recreational leaders, and promote wellness.

=== Campus life ===
* Campus safety: May be law enforcement officers or other security personnel who provide intervention and prevention for campus crime including annual campus crime reporting and campus programs for public safety
* Community Service: Engages students in on- and off-campus community service and experiential learning opportunities such as service learning
* Commuter/Off-campus student services: Provides services for students living off-campus including social programs, transitions, transportation, housing, and dining options
* Greek affairs: Advises governing councils and recruitment and leadership programs for new and initiated members
*Leadership &amp; Student Engagement: Leadership opportunities for students attending higher education provide valuable learning in areas other than academics. Outreach programs within the institution&#x27;s community have historically shown to benefit the students, school, and community by building a mutually engaged relationship When a student is engaged in their institution and community, it can enhance their learning experiences, broaden academic thinking, and promote creativity One way to implement leadership and engagement for students might include partnering with faculty to involve students in research initiatives. In addition, students may join the institutional student government. These organizations are largely made up of student leaders who represent the student body, and advocate to the school, community, and local government regarding issues facing the current student population. Student affairs professionals can assist students in locating leadership opportunities within the school or community that match their interests, and facilitate the recording of co-curricular records sometimes referred to as a list of extra-curricular activities. Students can then graduate from their respective programs with more than academic credentials. Co-curricular records demonstrate a student&#x27;s involvement, successes, and learning moments outside the classroom, which may serve as additional merits when applying to the workforce, thus, improving student likelihood of securing employment within the community
*Student activities: Provides co-curricular programming and advises student organizations and student government; may include Student Activity Board, student government, and student activity fee disbursement codice_1
* Union/Student center: Operates the student activities center/facility and may include food services/catering or other auxiliary services. 
*Students&#x27; Unions: Provides social, organizational activities, representation, and academic and wellness support of the membership. Students&#x27; Union staff work in the same capacity as many student affairs professionals but typically not directly for the institution itself. 
* Veteran&#x27;s affairs: Provides programs and support for Armed Forces members who have returned to college.

===Counselling, health, and wellness===
Counseling center: Provides individual, group and sometimes couple/family counseling, consultation, crisis, and prevention/intervention services for academic, career, and social/emotional/mental health issues by licensed mental health counselors, social workers, psychologists, and psychiatrists

Counselling Services on campus provides students with support through personal or academic challenges. Counselling Services offers individual and group counselling to support those students who need to work through their challenges, which affect their ability to succeed in school or other parts of their lives. Counselling Services falls under Student Wellness at many campuses. Providing both students and staff with services and resources to facilitate improved mental health well-being. Counselling services can be utilized for personal, academic, as well as counselling staff.

Students in Canadian post-secondary seek advice for the following top reasons: relationship concerns, anxiety/ stress, depression/grief, academic, and career. There has been an increase in psychopathology among students attending universities and colleges in Canada. Research suggests the explanation behind increased appointments with counsellors are due to the high population of international students and mature students. The increasing number of students who have financial debt, students who have pre-existing mental health issues, shortage of institutional resources, the increase of accepting treatment, and the valued support among counsellors are the reason for increased appointments.

Atmosphere: Most Counselling Services offices will encourage a respectful, safe, and affirming atmosphere for students. Offices will support inclusiveness for marginalized populations or minority-seeking groups, including students of all races, ability, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, age, culture and socioeconomic status.

How? Depending on the institution, counselling services can be booked via online booking, in-person booking, or walk-in hours.

Types of Supports:

* Individual Support
* Seminar and Workshops
* Online Resources, see also Online Counseling
* Physical Resources
*24/7 Help Lines

Where: Counseling services occur in a private and confidential setting. Counselling can take place in many different situations, such as in a quiet office space, a casual walk, dining hall, a phone call, or a video chat.

Average Appointment Time: 45–60 minutes.

Length of Treatment: Therapy can last a few sessions, several weeks, or years. There is no simple answer on how long therapy will take to feel better because each encounter with a counsellor is individualized.

Types of Counselling: Counselling services can be utilized for many aspects, including personal, career, academic, group, or faculty/staff.

*Personal Counseling: Personal counselling deals with stress, losses, complex relationships, isolation of individuals or depression.
*Career Counselling: Career counselling looks at individuals’ career exploration, change, or personal development. The goal of the counsellor is to guide individuals into a career that is suited to their aptitude, personality, interest and skills. Also, see Career counseling.
*Academic Counselling: Academic Counselling assist individuals obtain effective and efficient study skills so that students can be successful in their respective courses.
*Group Counselling: Group counselling provides a supportive environment to discuss problems and concerns of individuals experiencing similar issues.
*Faculty/Staff Counselling: Faculty and staff working with students may require assistance when supporting students in distress, and supporting withdrawn or isolated students. This counselling also focuses on communication difficulties, language barriers, or cultural norms. See also Employee Assistance Program
*Health services: Provides medical and/or mental health care, counseling, and consultation, and public health education for individuals and groups
* Wellness education: Provides services and information on personal wellness including anti-violence education, alcohol and other drug abuse and prevention, nutrition, and finances. Also see: Health promotion in higher education

===Career and employment services===
Evolving over decades, the purpose and approach of career and employment services in the landscape of Canadian higher education has progressed from roots in a post-Second World War era “when campuses responded to a national need to assist returning veterans make a successful transition to civilian life” to a requirement of the service to respond swiftly to a modern time marked by technological advances, cultural revolution, and internationalization. Typical career centers in Canadian higher education concentrate on student career development from the outset of one&#x27;s entry into a program through to graduation by providing support in areas such as:

* Employment and career counseling
* Résumé preparation
* Interview skills
* Career planning
* Navigating the world of work

Some career centers also provide ongoing support, resources, and programming for alumni populations.

There are three common service delivery models influencing the placement of career and employment services in a post-secondary institution&#x27;s Student Affairs and Services offering: the centralized, decentralized, and hybrid models of service delivery. The centralized model provides the same menu of services to every student regardless of faculty (i.e. school-wide) contrasting the decentralized model which places focus on individual faculties or schools providing independent support to individual students enrolled in that faculty&#x27;s programs (i.e. faculty-wide). The third hybrid model &quot;features some centralized career services, such as graduate recruitment, but with faculties maintaining their own career centres&quot;.

Robert Shea has identified four areas for career and employment services departments to remain cognizant of in the future: experiential learning, new technologies, changing student populations, and research and accountability.

i. Experiential learning

Having gained increased focus within the post-secondary landscape, “concepts of experiential learning, work-integrated learning, alternative education, practice-oriented education, co-operative education, and internships” require astute anticipation, evaluation, and action from career and employment services professionals.

ii. New technologies

Technological advancement introduces the ability to meet students where they are, both academically and physically. Robert Shea explains that the ongoing development of new technology supports “the delivery of future services, such as digital portfolios, sophisticated searches, and distance interviewing”.

iii. Changing student populations

Increasing diversity in cohorts of students including “older-than-average students, single parents, students of color, international students, Aboriginal and First Nations students, part-time students who are full-time workers, distance students, and students with physical and emotional disabilities” present both opportunities and challenges for career and employment services professionals.

iv. Research and accountability

Little data or literature exists on the impact of career and employment services programming in the Canadian post-secondary landscape including “outcomes of career centre interventions or the effect of work-related factors on student retention”. Improvements in this area can “offer compelling evidence for the efficacy of what career and employment services has to offer on campus”.

=== Experiential Education ===
Experiential education is a philosophy centred around learning through direct experience and reflection. The goal of experiential learning is to provide hands-on practical learning experiences that enriches a student’s learning in their academic courses The Association of Experiential Education believes that learning takes place when “carefully chosen experiences are supported by reflecting, critical analysis and synthesis”. In 70&#x27;s David Kolb developed the Experiential Learning Model (ELM) and popularized the idea of integrating experiential education with academic programs. As experiential education becomes more common amongst higher education institutions, a broad variety of learning opportunities is offered to students including but not limited to:

* Applied Research projects
* Community Research Projects
* Cooperative Education
* Field Work
* Internships
* Practicum or Placements
* Service Learning
* Study Abroad Opportunities
While many institutions are providing student support for Co-operative Education, Career Success and Experiential Learning in one department, other have these units spread out across different departments and faculties. These services are staffed by student facing Co-op Consultants, employer relations Co-op Consultants, International experience consultants, Career Consultants and Employment Resource staff. Although similar to the Career and employment services divisions that some institutions provide through their student affairs, most Canadian colleges and universities are keeping these services as an exclusive department linked to credit bearing program requirements. As many of these opportunities are linked to credit bearing program requirements, there is debate as to whether experiential education lies in the realm of student affairs or academics.

=== Disability Services ===
Canada

Academic accommodation for students with disabilities is an essential student affairs service that provides students with temporary or permanent disabilities with access to accommodations that remove barriers and allow opportunities for equal participation. Universities and colleges within Canada and specifically in Ontario are required to provide services to students with permanent or temporary disabilities to enable equal opportunity to education. This right to access education is pursuant to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA), and the Ontario Human Rights Code (OHRC) to the point of undue hardship. In response to this need, both community colleges and universities established an office to oversee and implement academic accommodation support services for students with disabilities. A student entering post-secondary education must register with Offices for Persons with Disabilities to obtain academic accommodations. Many post-secondary institutions use the terms &#x27;disability&#x27; or &#x27;accessibility&#x27; in their department title, however, the latter is becoming used more often to highlight the need for a change in environment rather than the need for the student to adapt. Post-secondary institutions provide academic support to the following disability groups:

United States of America
In the U.S., disability support services commonly (a) provides accommodations and advocacy for students with developmental, emotional, intellectual, learning, and physical disabilities and (b) advocates for policies and services relating to accessibility and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.

===Diversity and inclusion===
*International student services/study abroad programs: Assists and supports international students who are not citizens with visas, homesickness, linguistic and cultural transitions, and can include programs for citizens who seek Study or Education Abroad programs
* Multicultural services: Provides support and programs to create an environment of respect and affirmation for students and staff of multiple cultural identities; may include African and African American, Asian/Pacific Islander, Latino/a, Native American Indian, and Multiracial Student services, programs, and supports; a Women&#x27;s Center, programs, and supports, and a Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Center, programs, and supports
* Spirituality, faith-based, and religious services: Provides a variety of supports for a range of belief systems at both public and independent institutions

=== Multicultural Services ===
Multicultural student services aim to support students, student affairs professionals and faculty in higher education, frequently those who are underrepresented. Services offered by multicultural services include coordinating events of cultural heritage and expression, uniting students to community resources, and helping marginalized students find success on campus.

Larger institutions might have decentralized services where its own office and programs serve each group of underrepresented students. Women and LGBT students are sometimes included in multicultural student services functional areas but may be served by others.

=== On-campus Dining ===
On-campus Dining options vary based on campus, and institution. Major chains may have locations on university campuses, but there can also be more local food options specific to that campus as well. In some cases there are student cafes and restaurants run by the student union of that institution. Institutions will often have some kind of Meal Plan option that students can pay into through student fees; this provides some additional ease when purchasing food and perhaps discounts as well. In some cases, partnership are made with external restaurants and dining spots to provide students with discounted prices as well.

=== Residence programs ===
Residence programs provide housing, programming, and academic and personal/social support including resident assistants/hall directors for on-campus undergraduate and graduate residents living in traditional residence halls, suites, or apartments, and may include food services. Residence programs focus on supporting student transition to post-secondary and on integrating students into the broader institutional community. Residence programs can be split by functional units which are focused on managing different aspects of student housing. Some of the functional units that can be found within residence programs include:

Residence Life

Aims to provide more than just a space for students to reside - the focus of residence life programs is on community integration both within the context of the housing operation and within the context of the institution. Residence life units seek to create a connection between students and the institution, where students feel they belong and are more likely to find success in their studies. Residence Life often also oversees student conduct and responds to breaches of Residence Hall Agreements or Community Standards.

Residence Education

Acknowledged as a separate functional unit at some institutions, residence education focuses on the development and implementation of intentional learning experiences for students to engage in. Residence education units focus on developing learning experiences that support the student life cycle and student retention/persistence to graduation. Some examples of priorities for residence education units include time management skills, study skills, career planning, healthy eating &amp; sleeping habits, etc.

===Student Conduct===
Student conduct, judicial affairs, and/or academic integrity offices are typically coordinated by student affairs professionals, with a focus on promoting student success through the prevention and sanctioning of academic and/or non-academic misconduct. Judicial affairs or student conduct offices enforce community standards and campus codes of conduct, which may include ethical and legal programs/education, conflict resolution or mediation for academic and behavioural student concerns, investigative response to campus sexual violence, threat assessment, and referrals and collaboration with outside police agencies. Student affairs professionals concerned with student conduct are responsible for communicating and enforcing institutional policies and student codes of conduct, investigating allegations of student misconduct, and working with students throughout the resolution process.

The organizational framework for responding to student misconduct varies across institutions, taking a centralized, decentralized, or hybrid approach. Similarly, definitions of student misconduct, the delineation of types of misconduct, and disciplinary processes also vary by institution, though commonalities exist.

There are multiple approaches to conduct processes on campuses, which balance the precedent of conduct administration history and the call to better align with the institutions&#x27; educational focus. University and college campuses have a history of balancing the competing responsibility of an educational focus and the emergence of legalism. In the 1960s, a Federal court process in the United States highlighted the first and fourteenth amendment rights of students, which influenced universities to adjust their judicial processes to be legalistic and adversarial.

A key function of all conduct systems is providing a result or expected pathway forward for the student. Depending on campus precedent, history, and the type and severity of the behaviour, processes and outcomes for academic or non-academic misconduct may be punitive, educational, and/or restorative in nature. Punitive sanctions tend to focus on punishment at or to the student, educational and developmental sanctions focus on guiding students to critically reflect on behavior, and restorative sanctions ask students to repair harms through action. A 2014 study by Karp and Sacks identified six developmental goals for college students aged 18–22 to be achieved throughout the conduct process: 1) Just Community/Self-Authorship, 2) Active Accountability, 3) Interpersonal Competence, 4) Social Ties to Institution, 5) Procedural Fairness, and 6) Closure. They found that a restorative and developmental approach to conduct allowed for these learning goals to be met more frequently and consistently, compared to traditional punitive styles. It is becoming widely accepted within the conduct administration field that taking a developmental approach to behavioural concerns decreases the recidivism rates among students and allows students to focus on the harms that have been caused, rather than simply the rule that was broken. With this being said, this is not to completely discount the traditional or &#x27;code&#x27; style approach to conduct, which is still effective when a student does not take responsibility for their actions or identify the harms and impacts that their behaviour has caused.

Student affairs professionals working in student judicial affairs and academic integrity are in a unique position to influence a students&#x27; moral and ethical development. By responding to student misconduct in a way that is “measured, fair, and appropriate”, student affairs professionals promote the importance of being accountable for misbehavior, while also assisting students in becoming better students, graduates, and members of society. Whether this be express new knowledge of department or institutional policy and expectations, or more introspective moral development and reflection, the goal for any judicial affairs or student conduct officer is to promote learning and development for each student they engage with.

An organization based on the United States, but with international membership, the &quot;Association for Student Conduct Administration&quot; focuses on conduct administration and best practices on campuses.

== Professional organizations ==
There are numerous professional organizations for student affairs at the national, regional, and international levels. These organizations serve many functions to the profession including, guidance for best practices across the field, professional development and shared learning, research or grants to further service development, and advocacy on current issues that influence professional practice and student life. In addition, many student affairs professionals participate in associations that are either more general (embracing higher education administrators generally) or specific to a particular sub-field such as residence life or student health. At the international level, professional organizations for student affairs include the International Association of Student Affairs and Services, which was established in 2010.

In Canada, the very first association University Advisory Services was established in 1946 which was later called as University Counselling and Placement Association (UCPA) and later on was called Canadian Association of University Students Personnel Services (CAUSPS). In 1973, Canadian Association of College and University Student Services (CACUSS) was founded for student affairs professionals across Canada. In 2015, CACUSS developed various communities and networking groups based on professionals needs&#x27; and research interests. Communities and networking groups focusing on multiple students services and resources for student affairs professionals such as aboriginal student services, learning services, advising, community engagement, EDI, and so many more. CACUSS organizes an annual conference, webinars, round-table talks, research presentations, and other professional development opportunities for student affairs professionals across Canadian post-secondary institutions

In Europe, international cooperation among student affairs professionals is facilitated by the European Council for Student Affairs (ECStA), based in Brussels. Founded in 1999, ECStA traces it origins to a series of conferences of student affairs professionals held in the 1990s. ECStA deals with a number of issues that are unique to European higher education, such as ensuring international student mobility within Europe under the Bologna Process.

In the Asia-Pacific region, the major international student affairs organization is the Asia Pacific Student Services Association (APSSA), based in Hong Kong. APSSA was established in 1988, and holds regular staff and student conferences. Countries represented among APSSA member institutions include Australia, China, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and the United States.

In the United States, large organizations include National Association of Student Personnel Administrators (NASPA) and American College Personnel Association (ACPA). NASPA members are committed to serving college students by embracing the core values of diversity, learning, integrity, collaboration, access, service, fellowship, and the spirit of inquiry. NASPA and ACPA published the &quot;Principles of Good Practice for Student Affairs&quot; in 1997 which build off of those published by Chickering and Gamson (1987). These principles emphasize the profession&#x27;s core value of promoting services and program delivery that are student-centered and address student needs beyond the academic environment. These principles are not prescriptive and provide guidelines for professionals from varying service areas and institutions to adapt to their unique social, political, and campus contexts while promoting the values of the profession. As well, there are publications that relate to the Student Affairs field such as the Journal of College Student Development and The Chronicle of Higher Education.

In Canada, the &quot;CACUSS Student Affairs and Services Competency Model&quot; reflects the knowledge, skills, and attitudes of novice through experienced student affairs and services professionals. These competency areas are not specific to individual functional units or services areas and reflect values commonly held by the field of student affairs including shared identity as professional and educator, student-centered and holistic service delivery, and ethical practice.

While large organizations exist, there are smaller organizations and publications that represent various smaller departments or divisions in Student Affairs. For example, in Residence life, university departments have a national organization association called the Association of College and University Housing Officers - International (ACUHO-I). ACUHO-I also publishes a peer-reviewed journal (&quot;The Journal of College and University Student Housing&quot;) twice a year and publishes a magazine (&quot;Talking Stick&quot;).

== Criticism ==
Student affairs and services delivery is challenged by contemporary issues and influences both internal and external to the institution. Increasingly diverse student populations, new technologies, political and government influences, and increasing pressure to improve retention and recruitment require flexible and innovative institutional and organizational cultures. The organization, structure, and function of student affairs and services at universities and colleges are criticized as slow to adapt to these changing contexts because institutional cultures emphasize practices rooted in tradition. Further complicating the efficacy of organizational change are the unique subcultures internalized by different functional units that reflect the underlying values, beliefs, and assumptions held by those professionals. As student affairs and services continues to grow, it is difficult to have consensus on the core values across functional areas.

Tension occurs within the field of student affairs and services among different function units and individual practitioners who use a student-centered or institution-focused approach to their work. Differing perceptions by student affairs and services staff towards their institution&#x27;s approach of supporting student success reflects structures whose cultures are either connected or siloed.

The field of student affairs has been criticized for its emphasis on formal, professional training, calling into question whether the field is theoretical or practical. Complicating this criticism is the question of the role of student development theories in student affairs practice. It is claimed that student development theories are used to “proactively identify and address student needs, design programs, develop policies, and create healthy...environments that encourage positive growth in students.” Yet, student affairs practices often bear little resemblance or connection to student development theories. As Paul Bloland (1979) wrote in an article in the &quot;NASPA Journal&quot;, “We have cultivated an expertise that was not requested, is not sought out, and for which there is little recognition or demand. Many entry-level and (many) seasoned professionals know little of student development theory and practice and, in fact, do not really need such expertise to meet the role expectations of their supervisors or, in too many instances, their institutions.” Today, theory-to-practice models reflect the necessity to combine foundational theoretical knowledge of student development theories with the functional knowledge gained through professional practice and ongoing reflection.

Unfortunately, there has been relatively little research on the relationship between student affairs professionals (also referred to as staff) and students as compared to that between faculty and students. While early research confirms that staff-student relationships are beneficial to the latter, the insufficient empirical examination of all that this topic encompasses also specifically implies a lack of knowledge on the importance of staff of colour to enhancing the experiences of students of colour, particularly at Predominantly White Institutions (PWIs). Mentors can help students achieve success, and while some research suggests that the racial matching of mentors and mentees is beneficial, this element of the staff-student relationship is often ignored or forgotten.

Despite the emphasis student development theories place on the use of holistic approaches, research has shown that White staff may not take such an approach to mentoring students of colour, instead focusing on academics and taking the controversial “colourblind approach.” This can lead to less meaningful staff-student relationships. Greater conversation and action is required with regard to hiring more staff of colour, why students of colour may not be fully comfortable in all student affairs spaces, and preparing White staff to support students of colour in a more holistic way.

Another debate has centered on the degree to which available postgraduate preparation programs actually represent a distinct discipline . While the field bears a resemblance to psychology, counseling, and other general concentrations, debate and criticism of the field&#x27;s major foundations are virtually nonexistent in theoretical discourse, calling into question the credibility of the academic underpinning of the field. As Bloland, Stamatakos, and Russell wrote, while student development theory “...has been widely distributed through the literature, in preparation programs, at workshops and conventions,” academics and professionals in the field have, “...failed to exercise their critical faculties to raise questions about student development, to slow down the head-long pace of its engulfment of the field of student affairs, and to examine alternatives and opinions as they presented themselves.”

<text>LaClede Town was a mixed-income, federally funded housing project in St. Louis, Missouri. Located near St. Louis University, it opened in 1964. It incorporated a mix of housing types and had spaces dedicated to social interaction and artistic production. It was an intentionally diverse community with respect to residents&#x27; income and race/ethnicity. This experimental urban development was &quot;cool, hip, cheap and populated by people committed to making integration work.&quot; It became an incubator for new music, dance, poetry and other arts, especially jazz. Loyal former residents began organizing reunions in 1997.

Eventually, LaClede Town became run down, and the complex was demolished in the late 1980s. Some of the Grand Forest Apartments, a part of LaClede town, still exist as student housing for St. Louis University. Berea Presbyterian Church, which was central to the community and predated the LaClede Town development, still stands. However, it has been redesigned for commercial use.

<doc id="1271386" wikidata="Q7539907" url="?curid=1271386" title="Sleeping with the Enemy (album)">
<text>Sleeping With the Enemy is the second studio album by American rapper Paris. Released on November 24, 1992, it stimulated much controversy with the songs &quot;Bush Killa&quot; (a revenge fantasy about the assassination of then-president George H. W. Bush) and &quot;Coffee, Donuts &amp; Death&quot; (a cop-killing tirade). It also featured a young DJ Shadow on production.

Originally scheduled for a pre–presidential election release in 1992, the album was eventually released on Paris&#x27; own Scarface Records after Time Warner shareholders and media pressure prevented then-Warner Bros. Records subsidiary Tommy Boy Records from releasing the project.

It was re-released in a limited release subtitled &quot;The Deluxe Edition&quot;; it was digitally enhanced, reworked, and contains alternate versions. The album sold over 480,000 copies.

<text>NSYNC is the debut studio album by American boy band NSYNC, initially released in Germany on May 26, 1997, by Trans Continental Records, and internationally on March 24, 1998, by RCA Records. The album reached number one on the Offizielle Top 100 and includes the singles &quot;I Want You Back&quot; and &quot;Tearin&#x27; Up My Heart&quot;.

The album has since sold over 15 million copies worldwide, with the album earning a Diamond certification in the US, as well as peaking at number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

==Background==
===Band formation===
In 1995, Chris Kirkpatrick met with Lou Pearlman to talk about forming a pop group. Pearlman said that he would finance the group if Kirkpatrick would find other young male singers to be with him in the band. This prompted Kirkpatrick to start forming the group, so he called Justin Timberlake who had been a member of the Mickey Mouse Club. Justin joined and recommended his friend Joshua &quot;JC&quot; Chasez, who also was a cast member on the Mickey Mouse Club. Later, the three bumped into Joey Fatone, whom they all knew, at a club and he became the fourth member to join.

Initially, Jason Galasso was chosen as the group&#x27;s bass singer and fifth member. After several weeks of rehearsals, the group set up a showcase and began planning to officially sign with Pearlman&#x27;s Trans Continental Label. However, at the last minute, Galasso dropped out as he was not fond of the group&#x27;s musical direction, claiming that being a teen idol was never a goal of his. The group started to search for people to replace Galasso. Timberlake soon called his vocal coach, who suggested a 16-year-old from Mississippi named Lance Bass, who flew to Orlando to audition and was immediately accepted into the group.

===Recording===
The newly-formed group began recording demos in closets, which eventually became &quot;Sailing&quot; and &quot;Giddy Up&quot;. NSYNC were given an offer to record in Shaquille O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s house in Orlando after he heard them sing the national anthem. During the production of &quot;Sailing&quot;, an instrumental was placed before NSYNC started layering the track with harmonies and vocals, while &quot;Giddy Up&quot; was created from a vocal jam session through a computer. The band also recorded in the studio of producer Veit Renn, who used mattresses to create a soundproof environment.

Eventually, the group signed to BMG Ariola Munich, and were sent to Stockholm to begin working on their debut album with the help of producers such as Denniz Pop, Max Martin and Andreas Carlsson around July–August 1996. Initially, the band were recording songs similar to that of Boyz II Men, but had to switch their sound in order to accommodate to the dance-oriented European market. Due to his fascination of Robyn&#x27;s sound, Pop decided to incorporate Robyn&#x27;s style into NSYNC&#x27;s music by combining their R&amp;B vocals with pop tracks.

==Singles==
===Initial release===
The album&#x27;s official lead single, &quot;I Want You Back&quot;, was released in Germany on January 15, 1997, and reached the top 10 on November 18, 1997. The group&#x27;s second single, &quot;Tearin&#x27; Up My Heart&quot;, was released on February 10, 1997, also peaking within the top 10. The third single, &quot;Here We Go&quot;, was released on May 5, 1997, just three weeks prior to the release of the album, to similar success. Their self-titled debut album was then released by BMG Ariola Munich on May 26, 1997, which peaked at number one on the second week of release in Germany. The group soon became an overnight success throughout much of Europe. The album also charted successfully in both Switzerland and Austria eventually selling 820,000 units in GSA (Germany, Switzerland, Austria) region and Eastern Europe. Two further singles, &quot;For the Girl Who Has Everything&quot; and &quot;Together Again&quot;, were subsequently released on August 18 and November 3, 1997, respectively, achieving success in Germany and other European territories.

===International breakthrough===
Following their success of their début album in several European territories, the band captured the attention of Vincent DeGiorgio, an A&amp;R rep for RCA Records. After watching the group perform a rendition of their single &quot;Together Again&quot; in Budapest in November 1997, he offered them a record deal with RCA, which the group immediately agreed to. On January 20, 1998, their first German single, &quot;I Want You Back&quot;, was released in both the United Kingdom and the United States, becoming their first single in both territories, achieving success on both the UK Singles Chart and the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Around this time, RCA Records announced that they wished to release the group&#x27;s debut album, which was previously only released in Germany, in both the U.K. and the U.S., however, wanted to make adjustments to suit both markets. This resulted in the tracks &quot;Riddle&quot;, &quot;Best of My Life&quot;, &quot;More Than a Feeling&quot;, &quot;Together Again&quot; and &quot;Forever Young&quot; being cut altogether, and new mixes of &quot;I Want You Back&quot;, &quot;Tearin&#x27; Up My Heart&quot; and &quot;For the Girl Who Has Everything&quot; being recorded. The new version of the album also included four new tracks: &quot;I Just Wanna Be with You&quot;, &quot;(God Must Have Spent) A Little More Time on You&quot;, &quot;Everything I Own&quot;, &quot;Thinking of You (I Drive Myself Crazy)&quot;. This version of the album was subsequently released in the United States on March 24, 1998.

On June 30, 1998, the group&#x27;s second German single, &quot;Tearin&#x27; Up My Heart&quot;, was released in both the U.K. and the U.S., once again achieving success on both charts. Further edits were made for the British version of the album, including remixes of &quot;Thinking of You (I Drive Myself Crazy)&quot;, &quot;(God Must Have Spent) A Little More Time on You&quot; and &quot;For the Girl Who Has Everything&quot;, plus an all-new track, &quot;U Drive Me Crazy&quot;, written exclusively for the British market. This version of the album was released in the UK on July 5, 1998. At first, sales of the album were mediocre in both British and American territories, until the band&#x27;s worldwide broadcast &quot;Disney Channel in Concert&quot; special in 1998. After the concert was aired, sales of the album began to skyrocket. It reached number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and shipped over 10 million copies in the United States alone, making it certified 10× Platinum and earning the group an RIAA diamond award. On February 9, 1999, a third single from the new version of the album, &quot;(God Must Have Spent) A Little More Time on You&quot;, was released exclusively in the United States, peaking at #8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Thinking of You (I Drive Myself Crazy)&quot;, the final single, was released days later. Though &quot;I Drive Myself Crazy&quot; did not crack the top 40 on &quot;Billboard,&quot; its music video was in heavy rotation on MTV show &quot;TRL&quot;, spending a total of 40 days in the number 1 position. The group then went on to become the #3 top-selling boy-band group of all time.

==Commercial performance==
The album debuted at number eighty two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 the week of April 11, 1998, with sales of approximately 14,000 units. After six months, on October 10, 1998, the album reached and peaked at number 2 on the chart and remained on it for one hundred and nine weeks.
It spent a total of thirty weeks inside the top 10. The album spent three weeks at number 2 from September 1998 to January 1999. It peaked behind three different number-one blockbuster albums: Lauryn Hill&#x27;s &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot;, Garth Brooks&#x27; &quot;Double Live&quot; and Britney Spears&#x27; &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot;. According to Nielsen SoundScan, it was the fifth best selling record of 1998 in the United States with 4,400,000 copies sold. The album was certified ten times platinum by the RIAA on January 5, 2000, denoting shipments of ten millions. The album has sold 9,854,000 copies in the US according to Nielsen Music (as of March, 2015) with an additional 1.50 million units at the BMG Music Club (as of early 2003). In the United Kingdom the album debuted and peaked at number 30 on July 11, 1999, and remained on the chart for only three weeks. Worldwide, the album has sold 15,540,000 copies.

The album was ranked as the 137th best album of all time on the &quot;Billboard Top 200 Albums of All Time&quot;.

<doc id="1271393" wikidata="Q6984399" url="?curid=1271393" title="Near money">
<text>Near money or quasi-money consists of highly liquid assets which are not cash but can easily be converted into cash.

Examples of near money include:

* Savings accounts 
* Money market funds
* Bank time deposits (certificates of deposit)
* Government treasury securities (such as T-bills)
* Bonds near their redemption date
* Foreign currencies, especially widely traded ones such as the US dollar, euro or yen
* Crypto Assets.

Near money is not included in narrowly defined versions of the money supply, but broader versions include some types of near money.

==History==
Over the past three centuries what has been accepted by the public as money has been expanded from gold and silver coins to include first bank notes and then bank deposits subject to transfer by check (cheque). Until recently, most economists would have agreed that money stopped at that point. No such agreement exists today, and the definition of money appropriate to present circumstances is debated. Since the 18th century, economists have known that the amount of money in circulation is an important economic variable. As the theories became more carefully specified in the 19th and early 20th centuries, they included a variable called the money supply.

==Functions of money==
Money is often defined in terms of the three functions or services: as a medium of exchange, as a store of value and as a unit of account.

===Medium of exchange===
Money&#x27;s most important function is as a medium of exchange to facilitate transactions. Without money, all transactions would have to be conducted by barter, which involves direct exchange of one good or service for another.

===Store of value===
In order to be a medium of exchange, money must hold its value over time; that is, it must be a store of value. If money could not be stored for some period of time and still remain valuable in exchange, it would not solve the double coincidence of wants problem and therefore would not be adopted as a medium of exchange.

===Unit of account===
Money also functions as a unit of account, providing a common measure of the value of goods and services being exchanged. Knowing the value or price of a good, in terms of money, enables both the supplier and the purchaser of the good to make decisions about how much of the good to supply and how much of the good to purchase.

==Assets with slightly lower liquidity==
Thus near money can be considered as assets that fulfill the store-of-value function (as well as can be expected given the economic conditions) and are readily converted into a medium of exchange but are not themselves a medium of exchange. Deposits at a bank, savings and loan association, or building society etc. are a characteristic form of near money. Provided that the terms of the account permit immediate withdrawal, the deposit owner knows how much purchasing power he currently holds, and can turn the deposit into a medium of exchange (cash or a checking deposit/current account ) almost immediately.

Short fixed-term deposits (such as thirty-day treasury bills) and government bonds which are close to their maturity date are examples of assets which are not quite as liquid as a bank account that permits immediate withdrawal, but in many circumstances the difference is not important. Such assets are therefore often also regarded as &quot;near money&quot;.

<text>Estella Havisham (married name Estella Drummle) is a significant character in Charles Dickens&#x27; 1861 novel &quot;Great Expectations&quot;.

Like the protagonist, Pip, Estella is introduced as an orphan, but where Pip was raised by his sister and her husband to become a blacksmith, Estella was adopted and raised by the wealthy and eccentric Miss Havisham to become a lady.

==Inspiration==
Estella is widely believed to have been partially based on Ellen Lawless Ternan, a young actress who was Dickens&#x27; mistress from 1857 onwards. &quot;Ess-te-la&quot; is created by rearranging parts of Ternan&#x27;s name.

==Character history==

===Estella and Pip&#x27;s pre-adult life===
Pip and Estella meet when he is brought to Miss Havisham&#x27;s ill-kept mansion, Satis House, ostensibly to satisfy Miss Havisham&#x27;s &quot;weird fetish&quot; to be entertained by watching Pip and Estella play together. It is later revealed that Miss Havisham desires to have Pip&#x27;s heart broken by Estella.

===Estella&#x27;s relationship with Pip===
Estella states throughout the text that she does not love Pip. However, she shows numerous times in the novel that she holds Pip in a much higher regard compared to other men, and does not want to break his heart as she does with the others that she seduces.

===Estella as a symbol of Pip&#x27;s longings in life===
Pip is fascinated with the lovely Estella, though her heart is as cold as ice. Aside from the evident romantic interest, which continues through much of the story, Pip&#x27;s meeting with Estella marks a turning point in his young life: her beauty, grace, and prospects represent the opposite of Pip&#x27;s humble existence. Estella criticises Pip&#x27;s honest but &quot;coarse&quot; ways, and from that point on, Pip grows dissatisfied with his position in life and, eventually, with his former values and friends as well.

Pip spends years as companion to Miss Havisham and, by extension, Estella. He harbours intense love for Estella, though he has been warned that Estella has been brought up by Miss Havisham to inspire unrequited love in the men around her, in order to avenge the latter&#x27;s disappointment at being jilted on her wedding day. Estella warns Pip that she cannot love him, or anyone. Miss Havisham herself eventually decries this coldness, for Estella is not even able to love her benefactress.

===Estella and Pip as adults===
After Pip receives an unexpected boon of a gentleman&#x27;s upbringing and the &quot;great expectation&quot; of a future fortune from an unknown benefactor, he finds himself released from the blacksmith&#x27;s apprenticeship that had been funded by Miss Havisham as compensation for Pip&#x27;s years of service to her. He also finds himself thrown into Estella&#x27;s social milieu in London, where Pip goes to be educated as a gentleman. He relentlessly pursues Estella, though her warm expressions of friendship are firmly countered by her insistence that she cannot love him.

In fact, Pip discovers that Miss Havisham&#x27;s lessons have worked all too well on Estella; when both are visiting the elderly woman, Miss Havisham makes gestures of affection towards her adopted daughter and is shocked that Estella is neither able nor willing to return them. Estella points out that Miss Havisham taught her to be hard-hearted and unloving. Even after witnessing this scene, Pip continues to live in anguished and fruitless hope that Estella will return his love.

Estella flirts with and pursues Bentley Drummle, a disdainful rival of Pip&#x27;s, and eventually marries him because she wants to break the other gentlemen suitor&#x27;s hearts just like Miss Havisham told her to do. Seeing her flirt with the brutish Drummle, Pip asks Estella (rather bitterly) why she never displays such affection with him.

:&quot;&quot;Do you want me then,&quot; said Estella, turning suddenly with a fixed and serious, if not angry, look, &quot;to deceive and entrap you?&quot; &quot;
:&quot;Do you deceive and entrap him, Estella?&quot; 
:&quot;Yes, and many others—all of them but you.&quot;

This exchange suggests that Estella feels at least a modicum of love for Pip, as does the fact that in his presence, she never pretends to be anything but what she is. Rather than push him away, this honest behaviour only frustrates Pip.

It is implied that Drummle abuses Estella during their relationship and that she is very unhappy. By the end of the book, Drummle has been killed by a horse he had abused.

===Varied resolutions of Estella&#x27;s relationship with Pip===
Though Estella marries Drummle in the novel and several adaptations, she does not marry him in the best-known 1946 film adaptation. In no version does she eventually marry Pip, at least not within the timespan of the story.

The eventual resolution of Pip&#x27;s pursuit of Estella at the end of the story varies among film adaptations and even in the novel itself. Dickens&#x27; original ending is deemed by many as consistent with the thread of the novel and with Estella&#x27;s allegorical position as the human manifestation of Pip&#x27;s longings for social status:

As this ending was much criticized even by some famous fellow authors, Dickens wrote a second ending currently considered as the definitive one, more hopeful but also more ambiguous than the original, in which Pip and Estella have a spiritual and emotional reconciliation. The second ending echoes strongly the theme of closure found in much of the novel; Pip and Estella&#x27;s relationship at the end is marked by some sadness and some joy, and although Estella still indicates that she doesn&#x27;t believe she and Pip will be together, Pip perceives that she will stay with him:

===Estella&#x27;s origins===
Though she never knows it herself, Pip finally finds out where Estella comes from. She was the child of Jaggers&#x27;s maidservant Molly, a gypsy at that time, and Abel Magwitch.

Pip becomes convinced that Molly is Estella&#x27;s mother during his second dinner at Jaggers&#x27;s place, when he realizes that their eyes are the same and that, when unoccupied, their fingers perform a knitting action. Wemmick tells him Molly&#x27;s story: she had a child, the same age as Estella whose fate remains unknown. She came to Jaggers after he saved her from the gallows, as she had been accused of having murdered a woman out of jealousy.

One evening, after Pip returned from a visit at Miss Havisham&#x27;s, Herbert tells him a story that Magwitch told him: Magwitch had a wife once and they had a child, a girl, whom Magwitch loved dearly. His wife told him she&#x27;d kill the child (because the child was what Magwitch loved the most, and Molly wanted him to suffer for what he did to her) and, as much as he knows, she did. Shortly afterwards, she was accused of murder, acquitted and then disappeared. The two stories fit so well, that Pip has no doubt: Estella is the child of Abel and Molly.

He tells this to Jaggers and Wemmick, unable to keep it to himself. Jaggers tells him the missing bit of the story (only assuming, that it &quot;could have been&quot; like that): Molly gave the child to him, to be safe in case of her conviction. Abel, believing it dead, did not dare make a stir about it. At the same time, Miss Havisham was looking for a girl to bring up and save from a misery like her own and Jaggers gave Estella to her. She was two or three at the time. Miss Havisham did not know where she came from and named her Estella. Jaggers advises Pip to be quiet about it. Nonetheless, Pip can surmise no reason to spread the secret about Estella, as her father had to keep in hiding, her mother had been about to kill the child and Estella had escaped disgrace and would be dragged back into it by the revelation. Pip keeps quiet, and only tells Magwitch, on his deathbed, that his child lives. Pip tells him that she is a beautiful young lady and that he was in love with her.

<text>Trương Văn Cam, known by the sobriquet Năm Cam (April 22, 1947 – June 3, 2004) was a notorious Vietnamese mobster who is often called the &quot;Godfather&quot; of Vietnam. Known for building and running a criminal enterprise revolving around gambling dens, hotels, racketeering, extortion, loan sharking and restaurants that fronted for brothels, during his heyday, Năm Cam was considered one of the most powerful mob bosses in Vietnam, and was said to have attained influence that even extended into the ranks of Vietnam&#x27;s Communist Party which he used to his advantage by bribing law enforcement and government officials to protect his lucrative enterprise and cover up his murders of other criminal rivals in Saigon that challenged his reign. In fact, his connection and ties with the Vietnam&#x27;s Communist Party was so tight that during his trial, 153 other people that were tried with him were high ranking officers of the Communist Party.

For 15 years, Năm Cam reigned as the Godfather of Saigon. His downfall however came during a gang feud with another notorious female gangster from the northern city of Haiphong, Dung Hà who was considered one of the two great powers of the Vietnamese underworld alongside Năm Cam. Coming to the South, Dung Hà attempted to build her own gang in Saigon, and often came into conflict with Văn Cam. After a series of confrontations and standoffs between Dung Hà&#x27;s group and Năm Cam&#x27;s mob, Cam ordered the murder of Dung Hà. Authorities later arrested him alongside several members of his mob and cooperating Communist Party officers, leading to a massive public trial totaling 155 defendants, making it the largest criminal trial in the country at the time. Năm Cam and four of his members were sentenced to death, and Năm Cam was executed on June 3, 2004.

==Early life and initiation into crime==
Trương Văn Cam was born in 1947 to a poor family in Saigon as the son of Trương Văn Bưởi, who had immigrated from Quảng Nam to Saigon. Năm Cam&#x27;s first brush with the law came when he was just 15 years old for stabbing a man to death in a fight; he subsequently served two years in prison before joining the South Vietnamese army in 1966. As a youth, he was infamous around the local area for his brutal machete fights and for his slick ways of avoiding the police. Becoming a gangster from early on, Văn Cam was first initiated into the criminal underworld by Huỳnh Tỳ, a major player in the triads of Saigon at the time. During his early years as a youth in Saigon, Năm Cam was a follower of the most infamous mob leader in Saigon during the 60s, Đại Cathay, who was considered to be the top or the number 1 of the &quot;Four Great Kings&quot; of Saigon at the time. It was during his time as a member of Cathay&#x27;s mob that Năm Cam would later learn from Cathay how to run and organize a casino in order to make great profits from it, a method that he would later utilize during his reign of Saigon during the 90s. Later, Đại Cathay and Bảy Sy, who was Năm Cam&#x27;s brother-in-law were arrested as a result of South Vietnam&#x27;s government campaign against crime in August 1966. Later, Bảy Sy was released and soon opened a casino, where Năm Cam and Nguyễn Văn Nhã helped out to run the casino. During this time, Năm Cam, under the guidance of Bảy Sy planned to kill Tài chém, a notorious gangster in the first district of Saigon, but the plan failed and resulted in Năm Cam being chased by Tài chém&#x27;s gang brothers. After that, Hiếu Trọc saved young Năm Cam&#x27;s life and put him into the position of military logistics staff of the 313th Company of the Armed Forces in the South Vietnamese army. After that, Năm Cam became a swimmer of the Military Office of the Armed Forces for the army.

==Life as a criminal==

Prior to 1975, Năm Cam was not well known within the criminal world of South Vietnam, mainly playing the role of follower such as when he was a follower of infamous mob leader Đại Cathay or worked in the casinos owned by Bảy Sy. However, following the end of the war after 1975, Năm Cam would turn into a dangerous criminal.

After the South Vietnamese government collapsed and was taken over by the North, Năm Cam was presented to the 4th District Administration Board and was sent to reeducation camp. After his release, Văn Cam lived through trading old watches and radios at the Huỳnh Thúc Kháng market in the first district. However, before long, Năm Cam once again became engaged in illegal activities, especially gambling. On June 3, 1978, Năm Cam was arrested by the Ho Chi Minh City District 1 Police Department for gambling and was released two months later. Continuing until December 30, 1980, he was detained by the Organized Crime Police Unit of HCMC for two more years in Đồng Phú prison once again for gambling. On May 20, 1995, Năm Cam was once again placed in a reeducation camp for three years at Thanh Hà for running an illegal gambling business. Later, he was freed before the deadline of his release on October 4, 1997. It was this time period, that the department tried to stack up more charges on him from his younger days, including one where
he minced a rival&#x27;s fingers on a meat cutting board. The plan failed due to the victim and his brother was reported missing after a fishing trip. 

With his experience of being a ringleader, Năm Cam was regarded as being high skilled and sophisticated in his orders and guidance towards his followers, making sure to leave as little as evidence as possible by creating alibis for his crimes and directing his brothers only through the use of secret signals.

Due to his gambling business, Năm Cam was able to amass substantial wealth for himself. In 1994, he was arrested and convicted for his criminal dealings, but was released early in May 1995 after an intervention by Trần Mai Hạnh, director of Radio the Voice of Vietnam. Charges laid against him included murder, assault, gambling, organising gambling, organising bribery, abetting criminals, and organizing illegal emigration.

==Attack on Lê Ngọc Lâm==
For some time, there was great friction and altercation between Lê Ngọc Lâm and Năm Cam in the underworld. In order to resolve this problem, prior to his later conflict with Dung Hà, Năm Cam ordered the female gang boss to carry out the attack on Ngọc Lâm. Ngọc Lâm managed to survive the attack, but the high concentration of acid that was thrown on him left him with serious health and lasting aesthetic damage. Later, authorities concluded that Năm Cam was the mastermind behind the attack, and Dung Hà was the organizer while Nguyễn Văn Thọ was the one who bought the acid.

==Assassination of Dung Hà==
The conviction that led, perhaps indirectly, to his execution was due to his role in the assassination of underworld rival Dung Hà. Dung Hà, a reputed female gangster from Haiphong in northern Vietnam, moved south to Ho Chi Minh City, to join forces with Năm Cam, who hoped to get her to serve as his emissary in expanding his casinos in the north. However, Dung Hà had other plans to create her own gang, which angered Năm Cam. Dung Ha wanted to embarrass Năm Cam and arranged for a gift box containing rats to be delivered to one of Năm Cam&#x27;s restaurants in Ho Chi Minh City. Humiliated and enraged, Năm Cam ordered a hit on Dung Hà, which was carried out on October 2, 2000. Two men, traveling on motorbike, came up and parked near where she was sitting. One of them got off the bike, walked up to her, pulled out a 9mm revolver and shot her in the head at point-blank range. At the time, Dung Ha had
sent her body guard to remove someone causing a minor disruption next door. When the shot was heard, the body guard rushed back and fired from his single shot pistol. The assassins escaped nonetheless unscathed. It was unknown what happened to the body guard after, but according to close associates of Dung Ha, he fled the country after a threat from a
reputable member of Dung Ha&#x27;s mob for failing his job.

On June 4, 2003, Năm Cam was convicted for ordering the assassination of Dung Hà and bribing state officials to protect his criminal network and was sentenced to death by the court. However, it was not until the police were able to collect all of the evidence, documents and secure the testimonies from Nguyễn Tuấn Hải, Nguyễn Việt Hưng, Nguyễn Xuân Trường that Trương Văn Cam finally admitted to all of his offenses in public.

==Năm Cam’s trial==
Năm Cam&#x27;s trial in the Ho Chi Minh City’s People&#x27;s Court was one of the largest in Vietnam&#x27;s history. Margie Mason of the Associated Press wrote of the trial that &quot;Vietnam&#x27;s most notorious underworld boss has appeared in court with 154 others in what could be one of the Communist country&#x27;s most important trials. Nam Cam has been charged with seven counts. He faces death by firing squad if convicted. His co-defendants include two expelled members of the Communist Party&#x27;s powerful Central Committee, 13 senior police officers, three former prosecutors and three state journalists.&quot;

During the trial, there were 3 judges, 80 lawyers and 30 witnesses. Others who were also on trial included Năm Cam&#x27;s first wife Phan Thị Trúc, who was charged with and found guilty of bribery, loan sharking and sheltering criminals. Cam&#x27;s son-in-law and daughter were also charged with and found guilty of bribery. The number of defendants who stood trial totaled 154, all of whom were charged with a list of assorted crimes such as murder and unveiling national secrets. The opening of the trial was broadcast live on national television, with the mafia leader Năm Cam being filmed with handcuffs on and was shown dressed in a black-striped prison uniform during the court proceedings. At the same time, live TV screens were placed in front of the court, screening information regarding the charges of the defendants for journalists to see. In total, nearly an hour had passed before the court could finish reading all of the charges against the 154 defendants in the trial.

The case attracted unprecedented national attention from the Vietnamese public, such as when a crowd of over 500 people waited outside of the courtroom all for a chance to get a glimpse of the infamous mafia boss. The trial also had ripple effects outside of Vietnam, as it received attention from the international community. Some foreign observers, like Carl Thayer believed that the trial and conviction of Năm Cam and his men was a step in a positive direction, showing that the Vietnamese government was willing to put forth an effort to curb political corruption within the country.

==Fallout from his conviction==
Subsequently, former Ho Chi Minh City police chief (1996–2001), Bùi Quốc Huy, was found guilty of negligence for enabling mafia boss Năm Cam to carry out his illegal operations. Trần Mai Hạnh, the former head of state radio, and Phạm Sỹ Chiến, a former deputy national chief prosecutor, were both found guilty of receiving various bribes from Năm Cam, which included an Omega watch and a stereo.

The communist government touted the case as proof that they were determined to stamp out organised crime and corruption, a major source of discontent among Vietnamese. On May 7, 2004, President Trần Đức Lương of Vietnam, rejected Năm Cam&#x27;s appeal of execution. On June 3, 2004, Trương Văn Cam was executed by firing squad at the district 9 rifle range in Ho Chi Minh city, along with his four gang members Phạm Văn Minh, Nguyễn Hữu Thịnh, Châu Phát Lai Em and Nguyễn Việt Hưng, the last being the one who shot Dung Hà.

John Waters was asked to direct, but refused because he did not write the script.

Edith Massey was cast as Big Ed, but died shortly after her screen test. Bartel was uneasy about casting her because he thought it would look too much like a John Waters film without John Waters.

The role of Marguerita was originally set for Chita Rivera.
Principal photography took place in Santa Fe, New Mexico.

In the original script, Rosie was supposed to die but the filmmakers changed their mind during filming.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Variety&quot; described the film as &quot;a saucy, irreverent, quite funny send-up of the Western&quot; and said that it &quot;takes some of the old-time conventions – the silent stranger, the saloon singer with a past, the motley crew of crazed gunslingers, the missing stash of gold – and stands them on their head with outrageous comedy and imaginative casting.&quot; Kenneth Turan of &quot;California Magazine&quot; called it &quot;raunchy but irresistible,&quot; while Stephen Schaefer of &quot;US Magazine&quot; said &quot;&quot;Lust in the Dust&quot; is a wicked must&quot; and described it as &quot;a happy hoot&quot;, concluding that it &quot;knows how to mine the gold quickly and leave &#x27;em laughing.&quot; George Williams of &quot;The Sacramento Bee&quot; described the film as &quot;an irresistibly funny spoof on those Clint Eastwood-Sergio Leone movies called Spaghetti Westerns&quot; and stated that the actors &quot;all give us the feeling they&#x27;re having a lot of fun — and we can&#x27;t help but join in.&quot; Most of the mirth comes from the situations and the characterizations.&quot; Peter Stack of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; called the film &quot;a gun totin&#x27; rootin-tootin&#x27; New Mexico-style cowboy yarn loaded with surprisingly good performances&quot; and praised Kazan&#x27;s acting in particular.
Sheila Benson of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; Times said that the film&#x27;s satire was &quot;limp&quot;, and that it resorted to &quot;dumb, sniggering sexual innuendo,&quot; while Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the film&#x27;s jokes as &quot;witless and private&quot;. Critic Rex Reed opined that the film &quot;produces the kind of green reaction you get from eating a rancid burrito.&quot; Addressing Canby and Reed&#x27;s reviews, Peter Travers of &quot;People Magazine&quot; said: &quot;Well, what did they expect from a whacked-out Western parody starring has-been &#x27;50s hunk Tab Hunter and 300-pound female impersonator Divine—&quot;High Noon&quot;?&quot; and that the film delivers &quot;tacky, hit-and-miss hilarity&quot; with moments that offer &quot;more laughs than a barrel full of teenage sex comedies.&quot; He praised the performances and concluded that &quot;those in search of a smattering of cheap laughs will find &quot;Lust in the Dust&quot; the perfect oasis.&quot;

<text>Celebrity is the fourth and final studio album by American boy band NSYNC. It was released by Jive Records on July 24, 2001. Due to constant criticism that they were not a &quot;credible group&quot;, NSYNC began experimenting with genres such as hip hop and two-step. As with their previous studio album, &quot;No Strings Attached&quot; (2000), numerous producers, including BT, Rodney Jerkins, Brian McKnight, PAJAM, and the Neptunes, worked on the album. Justin Timberlake and JC Chasez also contributed to production, while they co-wrote 10 of 13 tracks in an attempt to develop a unique sound, which includes pop, R&amp;B, and teen pop.

After being delayed by unfinished recording sessions, &quot;Celebrity&quot; was released to generally favorable reviews from music critics, many of whom praised the production and songwriting. The album was the band&#x27;s second album to debut at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, with first week sales of 1,879,495 copies in the US, which became the second-best debut week sales in the country. It was also the third-best selling album on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in 2001, after Shaggy&#x27;s &quot;Hot Shot&quot; (2000) and Linkin Park&#x27;s &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; (2000), and has since been certified quintuple platinum in the US by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). NSYNC embarked on the accompanying PopOdyssey and Celebrity tours for promotion.

==Background and development==

At the 2000 &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards on December 5, NSYNC announced they would begin &quot;experimenting with new music&quot; for their third studio album at a recording studio in Florida during January and February 2001. Justin Timberlake said the band planned to spend two months in the studio to come up with ideas, while Joey Fatone stated that they may leave Florida as the album progresses. NSYNC also said they wanted to collaborate with Kevin &quot;She&#x27;kspere&quot; Briggs and Richard Marx, with whom they had worked on their third studio album &quot;No Strings Attached&quot; (2000).

Although &quot;No Strings Attached&quot; sold 14 million copies worldwide, including a record 2.4 million in the United States during its first week, critics ridiculed the band, who did not match the critics&#x27; perceptions as a &quot;credible group&quot; and were not considered &quot;artistic&quot;. In response to this, NSYNC decided to be more involved in production, co-writing 10 of the 13 tracks on &quot;Celebrity&quot;. JC Chasez discussed the recording process in an interview with &quot;Billboard&quot;: &quot;Our objective was not to be self-conscious and try to make another hit record. Instead, we set out to make a record that was more reflective of what turns us on musically. We also wanted to prove that pop music comes in a lot of different flavors. It&#x27;s not all bubble-gum.&quot; The band decided to assign roles for each member to combat media perception of &quot;leadership roles within the group&quot;. Timberlake and Chasez worked on the album&#x27;s production and music, while Lance Bass was assigned to handle business and management, and Fatone started to plan the supporting tour alongside Chris Kirkpatrick. &quot;Celebrity&quot; finished production in June 2001.

==Recording and production==
NSYNC sought out several collaborators to add new styles to their sound for &quot;Celebrity&quot;. BT was recruited when Chasez, a fan of BT&#x27;s music, befriended the producer at shows. Though initially hesitant to work with the band as their styles were opposite from each other, BT finally agreed when Timberlake told him he could do whatever he wanted with the group&#x27;s vocals. Timberlake told BT he wanted the track to sound like &quot;The Hip Hop Phenomenon&quot; on the UK version of BT&#x27;s 1999 album &quot;Movement in Still Life&quot;, to which BT responded, &quot;If you wanna do something that punk-rock, I&#x27;ll do it.&quot; During the production of &quot;Pop&quot;, BT tried 40 different treatments for vocals, with him using equipment that is commonly used for movie sound effects, and he constantly shouted Michael Jackson&#x27;s name at Timberlake to inspire him. BT changed the song from &quot;new-school R&amp;B, Timbaland-style beats, to progressive house&quot;.

NSYNC choreographer Wade Robson also took on a bigger role for the band as he co-wrote and produced multiple tracks for &quot;Celebrity&quot;, including &quot;Pop&quot;, &quot;Gone&quot;, and the title track. &quot;Gone&quot; was initially written as a duet between Timberlake and Jackson, but was declined by Jackson. Timberlake took the song to NSYNC&#x27;s A&amp;R team and the band later recorded it. Jackson changed his mind after the song&#x27;s release and wanted it to be performed only as a duet between himself and Timberlake, but they could not find a way to rewrite the song. American production duo the Neptunes produced &quot;Celebrity&quot;″s third single &quot;Girlfriend&quot;. Timberlake was determined to get American musician Stevie Wonder to play the harmonica for &quot;Something Like You&quot; after Timberlake composed the song with his songwriting partner Robin Wiley. Wonder recorded the harmonica part after Jive Records contacted him, with Timberlake describing his presence as a &quot;surreal moment&quot;. Brad Daymond and Alex Greggs, known as Riprock &#x27;n&#x27; Alex G, returned from &quot;No Strings Attached&quot; to write and produce three tracks: &quot;The Two of Us&quot;, &quot;Up Against the Wall&quot;, and &quot;The Game is Over&quot;. Bass stated that &quot;The Two of Us&quot; was inspired by the music of Craig David.

==Composition and lyrical content==
&quot;Celebrity&quot; includes elements of several musical genres, including pop, R&amp;B, and teen pop. In contrast to &quot;No Strings Attached&quot;, the decision to experiment with different sounds on songs such as &quot;Pop&quot; was made so NSYNC could appear more mature and musically diverse. The album fuses sounds from NSYNC&#x27;s earlier songs such as &quot;Bye Bye Bye&quot; (2000) with experimental genres, including hip hop and British two-step. Several of the producers who worked on &quot;Celebrity&quot; influenced the unique sound of each track, which was attributed to the band&#x27;s self-awareness and desire to accentuate different aspects of their music.

The album&#x27;s first track, &quot;Pop&quot;, refers to NSYNC&#x27;s defense of the pop genre towards their critics. Larry Flick of &quot;Billboard&quot; described the song as &quot;a crafty, anthemic blend of Cameo-style electro-funk beats, Euro-pop synths, heavy-metal guitars, and Timberlake&#x27;s now-signature human beat-box riffs&quot;, while John Hugar of Uproxx referred to it as &quot;a sort of proto-salvo against in the rockist vs. poptimists argument&quot;, and called the song a preview of Timberlake&#x27;s 2003 single &quot;Rock Your Body&quot;. The next track, &quot;Celebrity&quot;, was produced by Rodney Jerkins, who used &quot;low-key, funksome, two-step slither&quot; along with camera clicks. The lyrics outline the negative consequences of being &quot;a multi-millionaire, globe-trotting pop star&quot;, while Jon O&#x27;Brien of &quot;Billboard&quot; noted that the song is influenced by the Blackstreet and Janet Jackson song &quot;Girlfriend/Boyfriend&quot; (1999). &quot;The Game is Over&quot;, according to Barry Walters of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, includes the &quot;Pac-Man theme and dance-y squeaks&quot;, and &quot;echoes the sounds and sentiments of the last album&#x27;s edgiest cuts&quot;. The fourth track, &quot;Girlfriend&quot;, is an R&amp;B song that was produced by the Neptunes. A remix of the track that features rapper Nelly was noted for giving the song a hip hop influence. Nelly raps over a minimal guitar figure for two verses; the first which lasted for 61 seconds before the song&#x27;s first verse. &quot;The Two of Us&quot; is an &quot;R&amp;B waltz&quot; containing a &quot;British dancefloor beat&quot;, which was compared to that of &quot;Digital Get Down&quot; from &quot;No Strings Attached&quot;. Staff writers at &quot;Billboard&quot; considered the ballad &quot;Gone&quot; to be &quot;harrowing, relentless and unmistakably final&quot;. Hugar noted &quot;Gone&quot; as the precursor to Timberlake&#x27;s second single &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; (2002).

&quot;Tell Me, Tell Me... Baby&quot; was written by Max Martin and includes elements of Europop. According to O&#x27;Brien, the song contains &quot;larger than life beats, swelling strings&quot; and a bombastic chorus, which serves as a &quot;blatant throwback&quot;. &quot;Up Against the Wall&quot; is an R&amp;B song that features two-step garage elements; it was compared to Billy Joel&#x27;s song &quot;Get It Right the First Time&quot; from his 1977 album &quot;The Stranger&quot;, while the middle eight was compared to songs by the UK garage group So Solid Crew. &quot;See Right Through You&quot;, the ninth track on &quot;Celebrity&quot;, has an R&amp;B sound; according to David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, the song is &quot;another tale of betrayal by scheming girls&quot;. The Brian McKnight-produced track &quot;Selfish&quot; combines the vocals of Chasez and Timberlake with an adult contemporary track. &quot;Just Don&#x27;t Tell Me That&quot;, a teen pop track, is similar to songs by Britney Spears and the Backstreet Boys. The song&#x27;s lyrics describe a &quot;fame-seeking girlfriend&quot; spending too much time at the Playboy Mansion. According to Browne, &quot;Something Like You&quot; is a &quot;squishy ballad with drooling-puppy harmonies and lyrics&quot;. The chorus was compared to the Boyz II Men song &quot;4 Seasons of Loneliness&quot;. The US version of the album&#x27;s final song &quot;Do Your Thing&quot; contains &quot;stuttering electronic beats&quot; and a bar by the songwriter J. Moss. Browne described the song as &quot;mild electronica&quot;; &quot;Do Your Thing&quot; is included on &quot;Celebrity&quot; because Jive Records wanted a song that showcased NSYNC&#x27;s vocal talents and harmony.

==Artwork and title==
The artwork of &quot;Celebrity&quot; depicts the band walking on a red carpet while surrounded by flashing cameras and a crowd. Jackie Murphy created the artwork, which was photographed by Mark Seliger. Writing for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine considered the garish cover art to be a hybrid of the cover of the Beatles&#x27; 1967 album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; and music videos by alternative rock band Sammy, and said the title &quot;Celebrity&quot; &quot;none too subtly [draws] attention to the fact that they&#x27;re stars&quot;. Ariana Bacle of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; stated the appearance of each member on the artwork is &quot;tame&quot; in comparison to that of NSYNC&#x27;s 1997 eponymous debut studio album, specifically criticizing Chasez and Joey Fatone&#x27;s highlights for seeking unneeded attention.

==Release and promotion==

The album was officially announced on April 2, 2001, as &quot;Celebrity&quot;, with Jive Records having intentions to release an &quot;uptempo&quot; first single later that month. On May 11, 2001, MTV played a recording of &quot;Pop&quot; via satellite during NSYNC&#x27;s tour rehearsal for PopOdyssey, leading to the song&#x27;s release to radio stations as the album&#x27;s lead single three days later. &quot;Celebrity&quot; was initially set to be released on June 26, 2001, with the opening date of PopOdyssey on May 12, 2001. The tour was postponed to May 18, 2001, because the staging was still in development, and the album&#x27;s release date was postponed to July 24, 2001. NSYNC decided to perform the tracks from &quot;Celebrity&quot; on tour before its release. The tour was sponsored by Verizon, which launched several television and radio advertising campaigns across the US in promotion of the album and its release date. In an interview with &quot;Billboard&quot;, Chasez stated the concept of playing new songs at a concert was unusual but he felt it was a good sign that the crowd was actively participating. Jive Records president Barry Weiss was surprised by the band&#x27;s touring approach, acknowledging the audience response would indicate &quot;an album of immeasurable creative and commercial depth&quot;.

MTV broadcast a television special entitled &quot;The Road to Celebrity&quot; on July 21 and 22, 2001. The premiere of &quot;Celebrity&quot;, which included celebrities such as Britney Spears, Hugh Hefner, the Olsen Twins, and Aisha Tyler, was held at West Hollywood on July 23, 2001. NSYNC also played several songs at a tailgate party in the parking lot and appeared on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Total Request Live&quot; on July 24, 2001, coinciding with the date of the album&#x27;s ultimate release. To promote &quot;Celebrity&quot;, NSYNC appeared on &quot;The Rosie O&#x27;Donnell Show&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, and &quot;Today&quot;, between June and August 2001. On the August 2001 magazine issue of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, each NSYNC member was featured on an individual cover, in addition to a cover with the all the members. The recording process and promotional cycle for &quot;Celebrity&quot; was more condensed than their previous albums, as the group scrambled to finish the album while planning for PopOdyssey. Chasez stated that the recording, promoting and touring process was &quot;everything at once&quot;.

===Tours===

NSYNC embarked on two concert tours to promote the album. The first was PopOdyssey, which began on May 23, 2001, in Jacksonville, Florida, and concluded on September 1, 2001, in Mexico City. The tour&#x27;s set was a five-story-high main stage with several smaller stages surrounding it, with the setup being transported by 88 trucks in comparison to the 19 trucks used for their No Strings Attached Tour (2000). Earning over $90 million, PopOdyssey was the second biggest tour of 2001. The band&#x27;s second tour for &quot;Celebrity&quot; was the Celebrity Tour, which began on March 3, 2002, in Portland, Oregon, and concluded on April 28, 2002, in Orlando, Florida. In contrast to PopOdyssey, the tour favored music over spectacle and incorporated their older songs with new arrangements. It earned $33 million.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Celebrity&quot; was met with generally favorable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 65 based on 11 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable&quot; reviews.

Erlewine said &quot;Celebrity&quot; is NSYNC&#x27;s &quot;most varied album yet&quot; and called it a highlight from the teen-pop era of 1999–2001, and praised the musicianship of Timberlake, Chasez, and the songwriters. J.D. Considine of &quot;Blender&quot; said the album &quot;shines brightest when the group matures enough to forget about its image and focus on the tunes&quot;. Alex Needham of &quot;NME&quot; wrote that although NSYNC display feelings of discontent on &quot;Celebrity&quot;, they &quot;have the tunes to make up for it&quot;. In one of his &quot;Consumer Guide&quot; reviews, Robert Christgau gave the album a one-star honorable mention, writing, &quot;they survive writing their own songs&quot;, highlighting &quot;Selfish&quot; and &quot;Do Your Thing&quot;. Neil Strauss of &quot;The New York Times&quot; singled out &quot;The Game Is Over,&quot; with its &quot;skittering, robotic video-game beat&quot; as an impressive track.

Browne stated that &quot;Celebrity&quot; is &quot;the consummate teen-pop experience&quot;, listing R&amp;B, ballads, self-expression and Europop as examples of genres included. He also said it is &quot;pleasant filler and nothing more&quot;. Walters said the anxiety in the singers&#x27; vocals allowed them to &quot;pave a new high road for teen pop’s future&quot;, and that he found the band&#x27;s calling out of &quot;anonymous gold diggers&quot; on several tracks tiresome. Writing for &quot;Slant&quot;, Sal Cinquemani criticized the album for being &quot;slightly overcooked and a tad overzealous&quot;, saying it is unfortunate NSYNC &quot;couldn’t completely discard the classic hit-making formula in favor of the more experimental pop that seems so inherent in this and their last album&quot;. He said NSYNC could become &quot;The Beatles of their generation&quot; if they abandoned the pop genre and survived the growing pains and the aging of their fans. The staff of &quot;Q&quot; said &quot;Celebrity&quot; is &quot;quality froth&quot; despite not being good, and the &quot;E! Online&quot; staff stated that 13-year-old girls would love the album while others will only reluctantly appreciate it.

&quot;Dotmusic&#x27;s&quot; Cyd Jaymes was critical of &quot;Celebrity&quot;, praising the first track &quot;Pop&quot; for being one of the best singles of 2001, but describing the remainder of the album as &quot;formulaic, less-than-meaty balladeering and the odd glimmer of upbeat hope&quot;, and largely underwhelming. Jason Thompson of &quot;PopMatters&quot; described it as &quot;threadbare cookie crunch&quot; and accused the band of setting double-standards for their fans, saying NSYNC &quot;enjoy flaunting their own image while at the same time playing a candy-ass game of &#x27;don&#x27;t like us only for our status&#x27;&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
In the US, &quot;Celebrity&quot; debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Although it did not sell as many copies as &quot;No Strings Attached&quot;, &quot;Celebrity&quot;, selling 1,879,955 copies, it had the second-best debut week sales at the time since Nielsen SoundScan had begun monitoring record retailers in 1991. &quot;Billboard&quot; said the album&#x27;s failure to match the first-week sales of its predecessor was due to the 2001 US economy&#x27;s weaker state in comparison with the previous year, as well as the first decline in album sales in more than a decade. On August 22, 2001, &quot;Celebrity&quot; was certified quintuple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipments of 5,000,000 units in the US. It became the third best-selling album of 2001, selling 4.42 million copies. Sales of the album were marginally lower than those of Shaggy&#x27;s &quot;Hot Shot&quot; by 86,000 copies, which only beat it in the cassette format; &quot;Hot Shot&quot; sold 304,000 tapes while &quot;Celebrity&quot; only sold 92,000 tapes. &quot;Celebrity&quot; was ranked at number nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 year-end chart for 2001. As of March 2015, the album had sold 5,002,000 copies in the US according to Nielsen Music. It has sold an additional 826,000 units at the BMG Music Club, as of February 2003.

&quot;Celebrity&quot; debuted at number one in Canada on the Canadian Albums Chart, selling 71,254 copies, which was the biggest first-week album sales of 2001. It was certified double platinum by Music Canada (MC) for selling over 200,000 units in the country on November 7, 2001. In the United Kingdom, the album sold 13,000 units in its debut week, entering at number 12 on the UK Albums Chart. &quot;Celebrity&quot; was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for selling over 100,000 copies in the UK on May 17, 2002. Several European companies reported slow album sales, including Fnac in France and Spain, &quot;WOM&quot; in Germany, and Ricordi in Italy. The album sold 20,000 units in the first week in Japan, where it peaked at number 11 on the Oricon Albums Chart. &quot;Celebrity&quot; peaked at number 10 on Australia&#x27;s ARIA Albums chart, and was certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for selling over 35,000 units in the country. In 2001 &quot;Celebrity&quot; was the ninth best-selling album globally, selling 6.5 million copies.

==Legacy==
At the end of the Celebrity Tour in May 2002, NSYNC went on hiatus to take time off from touring and recording and to accommodate for Timberlake&#x27;s desire to record a solo album. Although the hiatus was planned to be temporary, with the band intending to record a fifth album once Timberlake released his album, they did not return to record together in the studio for 21 years, until the release of the song &quot;Better Place&quot; in 2023.

&quot;Celebrity&quot; is retrospectively seen as &quot;a logical swan song&quot; for NSYNC because it came after the record-breaking commercial success of &quot;No Strings Attached&quot; and before the band&#x27;s eventual dissolution. Music critics observed that the album was the basis for Timberlake&#x27;s solo career, as the album&#x27;s singles consisted of only songs Timberlake co-wrote, in addition to album promotion that centered around Timberlake. Hugar compared &quot;Celebrity&quot; to Zayn Malik&#x27;s and Harry Styles&#x27; desires for solo stardom after One Direction&#x27;s hiatus, concluding that it is &quot;a reminder that boy bands are rarely built to last&quot;. NPR&#x27;s Maria Sherman stated the album shifted the band further towards the R&amp;B genre and &quot;firmly established Timberlake as the bandleader and pushed Chasez&#x27;s powerful pop vocals to the periphery&quot;. Andrew Unterberger of &quot;Billboard&quot; acknowledged that &quot;Celebrity&quot; contained sounds which &quot;pushes pop music into the future&quot;.

<doc id="1271408" wikidata="Q217342" url="?curid=1271408" title="Alpha and Omega">
<text>Alpha (Α, α) and omega (Ω, ω) are the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet, and a title of Christ and God in the Book of Revelation. This pair of letters is used as a Christian symbol, and is often combined with the Cross, Chi Rho or other Christian symbols.

==Origin==
The first written record of the phrase &quot;alpha and omega&quot; is from some old manuscripts of the Christian New Testament.

The phrase &quot;I am the Alpha and the Omega&quot; (Koiné Greek: ), is an appellation of Jesus and of the Father in the Book of Revelation (verses 1:8, 21:6, and 22:13). The first part of this phrase (&quot;I am the Alpha and the Omega&quot;) is first found in chapter 1 verse 8, and is found in every manuscript of Revelation that has 1:8. Several later manuscripts repeat &quot;I am the Alpha and the Omega&quot; in 1:11 as well, but do not receive support here from most of the oldest manuscripts, including the Alexandrine, Sinaitic, and Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus. It is, therefore, omitted in some modern translations. Scholar Robert Young stated, with regard to &quot;I am the Alpha and the Omega&quot; in 1:11, the &quot;oldest [manuscripts] omit&quot; it.

A similar reference is found in Isaiah 44, where God is said to be the first and the last. Elsewhere in the New Testament, the phrase &quot;I am&quot; is used several times by Jesus, particularly in the Gospel of John.

==Christianity==
Alpha (Α) and omega (Ω) are the first and last letters, respectively, of the classical (Ionic) Greek alphabet. Thus, the phrase &quot;I am the alpha and the omega&quot; is further clarified with the additional phrase &quot;the beginning and the end&quot; in Revelation 21:6, 22:13. The first and last letters of the Greek alphabet were used because the book of Revelation is in the New Testament, which was originally written in Greek.

The phrase is interpreted by many Christians to mean that Jesus has existed for all eternity or that God is eternal. Many commentators and dictionaries ascribe the title &quot;the alpha and the omega&quot; to both God and to Christ. &quot;Barnes&#x27; Notes on the New Testament&quot; (1974) claims: &quot;It cannot be absolutely certain that the writer meant to refer to the Lord Jesus specifically here[...] There is no real incongruity in supposing, also, that the writer here meant to refer to God as such.&quot; Most Christian denominations also teach that the title applies to God (Jesus, the Father and the Holy Spirit).

The letters Alpha and Omega, in juxtaposition, are often used as a Christian visual symbol (see examples). The symbols were used in early Christianity and appear in the Roman catacombs. The letters were shown hanging from the arms of the cross in Early Christian art, and some cruces gemmatae, jeweled crosses in precious metal, have formed letters hanging in this way, called pendilia; for example, in the Asturian coat of arms, which is based upon the Asturian Victory Cross. In fact, despite always being in Greek, the letters became more common in Western than Eastern Orthodox Christian art. They are often shown to the left and right of Christ&#x27;s head, sometimes within his halo, where they take the place of the Christogram used in Orthodox art.

==Judaism==
In Hebrew, the word (, meaning &#x27;truth&#x27;), is referred to as the &quot;Seal of God.&quot; [Cf. Isaiah 44:6] The word is composed of the first, middle, and last letters of the Hebrew alphabet.

==Islam==
The Qur&#x27;an gives (), meaning &#x27;The First&#x27; and (), meaning &#x27;The Last&#x27;, as two of the names of God ().

==APL programming language==

Some dialects of the APL programming language support the direct function syntax where the left (optional) and right arguments are denoted by the letters alpha and omega. For example, the following function computes the sum of the left argument and twice the right argument:

{⍺+2×⍵}

<doc id="1271411" wikidata="Q1400015" url="?curid=1271411" title="Federal Bureau of Prisons">
<text>The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) is a federal law enforcement agency of the United States Department of Justice that is responsible for all federal prisons in the country and provides for the care, custody, and control of federal prisoners.

==History==
The federal prison system had existed for more than 30 years before the BOP was established. Although its wardens functioned almost autonomously, the Superintendent of Prisons, a Department of Justice official in Washington, was nominally in charge of federal prisons. The passage of the &quot;Three Prisons Act&quot; in 1891 authorized the first three federal penitentiaries: USP Leavenworth, USP Atlanta, and USP McNeil Island with limited supervision by the Department of Justice.

Until 1907, prison matters were handled by the Justice Department General Agent, with responsibility for Justice Department accounts, oversight of internal operations, certain criminal investigations as well as prison operations. In 1907, the General Agent was abolished, and its functions were distributed between three new offices: the Division of Accounts (which evolved into the Justice Management Division); the Office of the Chief Examiner (which evolved in 1908 into the Bureau of Investigation, and in the early 1920s into the Federal Bureau of Investigation); and the Office of the Superintendent of Prisons and Prisoners, later called the Superintendent of Prisons (which evolved in 1930 into the Bureau of Prisons).
The Bureau of Prisons was established within the Department of Justice on May 14, 1930 by the United States Congress, and was charged with the &quot;management and regulation of all Federal penal and correctional institutions.&quot; This responsibility covered the administration of the 11 federal prisons in operation at the time. By the end of 1930, the system had expanded to 14 institutions with 13,000 inmates, and a decade later in 1940, the system had 24 institutions with 24,360 incarcerated. A statute in May 1930 provided for the employment of prisoners, the creation of a corporation for the purpose was authorized by a statute in June 1934, and the Federal Prison Industries was created by executive order in December 1934 by Franklin D. Roosevelt.

The state of Alaska assumed jurisdiction over its corrections on January 3, 1959, using the Alaska Department of Corrections; prior to statehood, the BOP had correctional jurisdiction over Alaska.

As a result of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 and subsequent legislation, which pushed for longer sentences, less judicial discretion, and harsher sentences for drug-related offenses, the federal inmate population doubled in the 1980s and again in the 1990s. The population increase decelerated in the early 2000s, but the population continued to increase until 2014. 

The National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997 transferred responsibility for adult felons convicted of violating District of Columbia laws to the BOP.
==Administration and employees==

Colette S. Peters resigned as of January 20, 2025, and Deputy Director William Lothrop is the current acting director. 

As of December 2024, 60.5% of Bureau employees are white, 21.5% are black, 14.3% are Hispanic, 2.5% are Asian, and 1.2% are Native American. 70.7% are male and 29.3% are female. There is roughly one corrections officer for every 12.5 prisoners.

All BOP law enforcement employees undergo 200 hours of formal training in their first year of employment and an additional 120 hours of training at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers (FLETC) in Glynco, Georgia.

== Past directors ==
==Types of federal prisons==

The BOP has five security levels:

* Federal Prison Camps (FPCs), the BOP minimum-security facilities, feature a lack of or a limited amount of perimeter fencing and a relatively low staff-to-inmate ratio.
* Low-security Federal Correctional Institutions (FCIs) have double-fenced perimeters, and inmates live mostly in cubicles or dormitory housing.
* Medium-security FCIs and some United States Penitentiaries (USPs) are classified to hold medium-security inmates. The medium facilities have strengthened perimeters which often consist of double fences with electronic detection systems. Medium-security facilities mostly have cell housing.
* Most U.S. Penitentiaries are classified as high-security facilities. The perimeters are highly secured and often have reinforced fences or walls.
* Federal Correctional Complexes (FCCs) are co-locations of BOP facilities with different security levels and/or genders.
* Administrative Security Facilities are prisons with special missions and capabilities. An example would be Federal Medical Centers, which house sick and injured inmates getting medical care that is beyond the capabilities of a normal institution.

Some units have small, adjacent, minimum-security &quot;satellite camps&quot;. Twenty-eight institutions hold female inmates. , about 15% of Bureau inmates are in facilities operated by third parties, mostly private companies, while others are in local and state facilities. Some are in privately operated Residential Reentry Centers (RRC) or Community Corrections Centers. The Bureau uses contract facilities to manage its own prison population because they are &quot;especially useful&quot; for housing low-security, specialized groups of people, such as sentenced criminal aliens.

==Officers==
Officers employed by the FBOP are uniformed federal law enforcement officers who are responsible for the care, custody, and control of federal inmates. Primary Law enforcement officers working for the Bureau of Prisons have statutory powers of arrest per the United States Code, and the ability to carry a firearm off duty. 

The BOP has multiple specialty units including the Special Operations Response Team, Crisis Negotiation Team, Special Investigative Service and Disturbance Control Team.

==Inmate population==
As of December 2024, the Bureau was responsible for approximately 157,504 inmates, in 122 facilities. 56.7% of inmates were white, 38.9% were black, 2.9% native American, and 1.5% Asian; 93.5% were male and 6.5% were female. 29.2% were of Hispanic ethnicity, which may be any of these four races. 74.5% of inmates were between the ages of 26 and 50.

, 14,000 prisoners were in 16 federal prisons in the state of Texas.

, almost 8,000 felons in 90 facilities, sentenced under D.C. laws, made up about 6% of the total Bureau population.

As of August 2020, 46.2% of inmates were incarcerated for drug offenses.

The BOP receives all prisoner transfer treaty inmates sent from foreign countries, even if their crimes would have been tried in state, DC, or territorial courts if committed in the United States.

===Female inmates===

As of 2015, 27 Bureau facilities house women. The Bureau has a Mothers and Infants Nurturing Together (MINT) program for women who enter the system as inmates while pregnant. The Bureau pays for abortion only if it is life-threatening for the woman, but it may allow for abortions in non-life-threatening cases if non-BOP funds are used.

In 2017, four Democratic Senators, including Kamala Harris, introduced a bill explicitly requiring tampons and pads to be free for female prisoners. In August 2017, the Bureau introduced a memorandum requiring free tampons and pads. The previous 1996 memorandum stated &quot;products for female hygiene needs shall be available&quot; without requiring them to be free of charge.

A 2018 review by the Evaluation and Inspections Division, Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of Justice, found the Bureau&#x27;s programming and policy decisions did not fully consider the needs of female inmates in the areas of trauma treatment programming, pregnancy programming, and feminine hygiene.

===Juvenile inmates===
, juveniles sent into Bureau custody are between 17 and 20 and must have been under 18 at the time of the offense. According to the Bureau, most of the juveniles it receives had committed violent crimes and had &quot;an unfavorable history of responding to interventions and preventive measures in the community.&quot; In 2010, most federal juvenile inmates were from Arizona, Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska and the District of Columbia.

As of December 2024, there are 10 juvenile inmates (those under the age of 18) in BOP custody. 

The Bureau contracts with facilities that house juvenile offenders. Title 18, U.S.C. 5039 specifies that &quot;No juvenile committed...may be placed or retained in an adult jail or correctional institution in which he has regular contact with adults incarcerated because they have been convicted of a crime or are awaiting trial on criminal charges.&quot; The definition includes secure facilities and community-based correctional facilities. Federally sentenced juveniles may be moved into federal adult facilities at certain points; juveniles sentenced as adults are moved into adult facilities when they turn 18 and juveniles that were sentenced as juveniles are moved into adult facilities when they turn 21.

===Death row inmates===
The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 reinstituted the federal death penalty. On July 19, 1993, the federal government designated the United States Penitentiary, Terre Haute in Indiana as the site of execution for both males and females sentenced to execution. The Federal Medical Center, Carswell in Texas holds the female inmates who have been sentenced to death.

Some male death row inmates are instead held at ADX Florence.

Under the Trump administration, the BOP carried out 13 executions.

On December 23, 2024, President Biden commuted 37 of the 40 current federal death row inmates to life in prison without the possibility of parole. This leaves just 3 inmates on federal death row: Robert Gregory Bowers, Dylann Roof, and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.

===Overpopulation and responses===
Parole was abolished for federal inmates in 1987 and inmates must serve at least 85% of their original sentence before being considered for good-behavior release. The current sentencing guidelines were adopted in response to rising crime rates in the 1980s and early 1990s, especially for drug-related offenses. Some analysts and activists believe that strict federal sentencing guidelines have led to overcrowding and needlessly incarcerated thousands of non-violent drug offenders who would be better served by drug treatment programs.

The yearly increases in the federal inmate population have raised concerns from criminal justice experts and even among DOJ officials themselves. Michael Horowitz, the DOJ Inspector General, wrote a memorandum concerning this issue:

===COVID-19 pandemic===
By July 30, 2020, there were 2,910 federal inmates and 500 BOP staff who had confirmed positive test results for COVID-19 during the nationwide COVID-19 pandemic. 7312 inmates and 683 staff have recovered. There have been 99 federal inmate deaths and two BOP staff member deaths attributed to COVID-19.

The BOP conducted executions during the pandemic that reportedly did not adhere to physical distancing rules, leading to criticism that the BOP was facilitating &quot;superspreader&quot; events. Staff reportedly refused to wear face masks, a violation of court orders, and knowingly withheld information about confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses from people who had interacted with infected individuals along with hindering contact tracing efforts and allowing staff members who had been exposed to COVID-19 to refuse testing and work. Public health experts called for a delay in executions as they could not be carried out safely without risking the spread of COVID-19.
