<text>Tablas is the largest of the islands that comprise the province of Romblon in the Philippines. The name of the island is of Spanish origin. Before the colonization of the Philippines, Tablas was known as the Island of &quot;Osigan&quot;. At the time of contact with Westerners, &quot;Osigan&quot; had a population of 256 people living in small villages. Wax was produced in this island.

Odiongan, on the west central coast of the island, is a major port and the largest municipality of Romblon in terms of population. Tablas is administratively subdivided into the municipalities of Alcantara, Calatrava, Ferrol, Looc, Odiongan, San Agustin, San Andres, Santa Fe, and Santa Maria.

==Geography==
The island lies about east from the southern part of Mindoro Island. The northern tip of Tablas is about from Romblon Island. &quot;Mount Payaopao&quot; (also known as &quot;Tablas Summit&quot; on old maps) at the northeastern extremity of the island, is the highest peak on the island at high and the second highest in the province (after Mount Guiting-Guiting).

A wooded central range of hills traverses the length of Tablas. The west coast is formed by the western slope of the central mountain ridge, which is narrow and well defined. The summits in the middle of the island are 1,600 to 2,000 feet high. In the center of the island is &quot;Bitaogan Peak&quot;, high, which appears as a rounded knob from east and west and sharp from north and south. &quot;Mount Lunas&quot;, at the back of Looc Bay, is a black ridge high, long and rounded from east and west and sharp from north and south; with it the range breaks off to the low pass from Looc Bay to the town of Alcantara on the east coast. The southern part of Tablas is a group of many sharp conical hills, all bare and grassy except &quot;Malbug Hill&quot;, high, and &quot;Calaton Point&quot;, high, on the east coast, which are dark and wooded. The shore line is largely mangrove, with many beaches of coral sand and some limestone cliffs. The shore reef is continuous except off Guinauayan Point.

There is no good natural harbor except Looc Bay, a large indentation on the west side, but sheltered anchorage may be found on either side of the island, according to the season of the year.

Cabalian Point, the southern extremity of Tablas Island, is low and sandy and hard to distinguish at night, a lighthouse was built during the American Colonial period.

==Education==
Romblon State University is a premier institution for higher education in the Mimaropa Region. The University has a large campus in Odiongan town and a few more around Romblon province.

==Economy==
Main occupations are fruit and vegetable farming, fisheries, farm animal breeding and fishing. Tablas is one of largest producers of pili nuts.

Tablas was established an economic zone, Tablas Economic Zone Inc. (TEZI), on 2015 under the powers of the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA) and the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)

==Language==
The Asi language is a Visayan language spoken, along with the Romblomanon and Onhan languages, in the province of Romblon, Philippines. Tagalog is spoken by the locals as the second language. Foreigners are a welcome diversion for college students, who are the main part of the population who can speak English.

== Wildlife ==
The Wildlife and landscape appears untouched as deep-green vegetation is crossed by rivers and streams. A portion of the native forest cover has been removed and converted to coconut plantations, or rough grazing. However, the remaining small areas of watershed forest support several species of endemic wildlife that occur only on Tablas, or on just Tablas and Romblon Island. These include the Tablas Fantail &quot;Rhipidura sauli&quot;, the Tablas Drongo &quot;Dicrurus menagei&quot;, the Romblon Hawk Owl &quot;Ninox spilonota&quot;, and the Tablas Bulbul &quot;Hypsipetes (siquijorensis) cinereiceps&quot;. The frogs Platymantis_lawtoni and Platymantis levigatus are endangered species endemic to Tablas and other islands of Romblon province. In Ferrol at Malcom&#x27;s Cove, monkeys, sea turtles and the Philippine eagle. In Santa Fe the whale shark (the earth&#x27;s largest fish) is known to breed. The waters off Looc teem with numerous species of tropical fish and sea life in the protected sanctuary. Binucot Beach has manatee, dolphin and sea turtles.


== Scuba Diving ==
The only known blue hole in the Philippines is the Tablas Island Blue Hole, located just off northwest Gorda Point in northeastern Tablas, below the Gorda Point Lighthouse.

<doc id="1265733" wikidata="Q367665" url="?curid=1265733" title="André Watts">
<text>André Watts (June 20, 1946 – July 12, 2023) was an American classical pianist. Over the six decades of his career, Watts performed as soloist with every major American orchestra and most of the world&#x27;s finest orchestras, including the New York Philharmonic, National Symphony Orchestra, and London Symphony Orchestra. Watts recorded a variety of repertoire, concentrating on Romantic era composers such as Frédéric Chopin and Franz Liszt, but also including George Gershwin. In 2020, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society. He won a Grammy Award for Best New Classical Artist in 1964. Watts was also on the faculty at the Jacobs School of Music of Indiana University.

==Early life==
Born in Nuremberg, Allied-occupied Germany, Watts was the son of a Hungarian mother, Maria Alexandra Gusmits, a pianist; and an American father, Herman Watts, a U.S. Army non-commissioned officer. André spent his early childhood in Europe, living mostly near army posts where his father was stationed.

Watts began to study the violin when he was four. By six he decided the piano was his instrument. When André was eight years old, Herman&#x27;s military assignment brought the family to the United States. They settled in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His mother started him with his first piano lessons. As do many children, Watts disliked practicing. For encouragement, his mother would tell stories of the great pianist and composer Franz Liszt, making it clear that Liszt practiced faithfully. Watts found inspiration in Liszt, adopting his theatrical playing style.

At age ten, Watts performed Mendelssohn&#x27;s G minor concerto at the Robin Hood Dell outdoor amphitheater, where the Philadelphia Orchestra had given summer performances (from 1933 through 1975), and at fourteen, Franck&#x27;s &quot;Symphonic Variations&quot;, again with the Philadelphia Orchestra.

After the divorce of his parents in 1959, Watts remained with his mother, who supported them by working as a secretary and later as a receptionist.

Watts enrolled at the Philadelphia Musical Academy (now a part of the University of the Arts), where he studied with Genia Robinor, Doris Bawden, and Clement Petrillo, graduating in June 1963. He entered his first competition at nine, with forty other children, for the opportunity to perform with the Philadelphia Orchestra Children&#x27;s Concerts. Watts won the competition playing the first movement of Joseph Haydn&#x27;s Piano Concerto in D.

==Career==
At sixteen, Watts auditioned at Carnegie Recital Hall in a competition to play in conductor Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s televised Young People&#x27;s Concert series with the New York Philharmonic. Watts&#x27; performance of the Liszt Piano Concerto No. 1 in E-flat at a Young People&#x27;s Concert on January 12, 1963, was videotaped and nationally televised on CBS on January 15, 1963. Before the concert, Bernstein introduced Watts to the national television audience, stating that he &quot;flipped&quot; when he first heard Watts play.

On January 31, 1963, Bernstein asked the 16-year-old Watts to fill in for the ailing Glenn Gould, the scheduled soloist for the New York Philharmonic&#x27;s regular subscription concert. Watts again played the Liszt E-flat Concerto. At its conclusion, the orchestra joined the audience in a thundrous standing ovation. Watts&#x27; first LP, &quot;The Exciting Debut of André Watts&quot;, was shortly thereafter released on Columbia Masterworks records and included the Liszt Concerto with Bernstein and the Philharmonic.

Following graduation, Watts enrolled at the Peabody Institute in Baltimore, where he studied part-time for a Bachelor of Music degree with pianist Leon Fleisher. The following year, he appeared at New York City&#x27;s Lewisohn Stadium with conductor Seiji Ozawa, and the New York Philharmonic, performing Camille Saint-Saëns&#x27; Concerto No. 2 in G minor. In September 1963, he again performed the Liszt concerto at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles. He opened the 1964–65 season of the National Symphony Orchestra in Washington, D.C., again performing the Saint-Saëns concerto. He returned to New York in January 1965 to perform Chopin&#x27;s Concerto No. 2 in F minor. Watts made his European debut in a London performance with the London Symphony Orchestra in June 1966.

By 1969, he was on a full-scale concert schedule, booked three years in advance. Watts made his Boston debut in 1969 for the Peabody Mason Concert series. He graduated from the Peabody Institute in 1972. He signed a long-term exclusive contract with Columbia Masterworks Records on his 21st birthday. The contract ended in 1977.

In February 1973, Watts was selected as &quot;Musical America&#x27;s&quot; Musician of the Month. His other honors and awards included &quot;doctor honoris causa&quot; degrees from Albright College and Yale University, the Order of Zaire, a University of the Arts Medal from the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, and the National Medal of Arts.

By the mid-1970s, Watts was giving 150 concerts, recitals, and chamber performances per season, performing about eight months out of the year. In 1976, at age thirty, he celebrated his tenth consecutive appearance in the Lincoln Center Great Performers Series at Avery Fisher Hall. The PBS Sunday afternoon telecast was the first solo recital presented on Live from Lincoln Center and the first full-length recital to be aired nationally in prime time.

In 1985, he signed a recording contract with EMI, with whom he recorded until the early 1990s. He also recorded for Telarc.

In November 2002, Watts suffered a subdural hematoma and underwent emergency surgery. In 2004, he also had surgery for a ruptured disc which was affecting the use of his left hand. He continued performing regularly after recovering from the aforementioned surgeries.

In 2004, Watts joined the faculty at Indiana University, where he held the Jack I. and Dora B. Hamlin Endowed Chair in Music.

In 2019, Watts underwent surgery for a nerve injury to his left hand resulting in the cancellation of several performances. He reworked the Ravel Concerto for Left Hand to perform with his right hand and was planning to perform the work with the Detroit and Atlanta Symphony Orchestras. Ultimately, however, he was unable to perform the concerto due to the pandemic and continuing health issues.

==Personal life and death==
Watts was married to Joan Brand, had two stepchildren, and had seven step-grandchildren. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer in July 2016, and died of the disease at home in Bloomington, Indiana, on July 12, 2023, at age 77.

<text>Middle age (or middle adulthood) is the age range of the years halfway between childhood and old age. The exact range is subject to public debate, but the term is commonly used to denote the age range from around 45 to around 65 years. Many changes may occur between young adulthood and this stage.

==Overall==
This time span is generally referred to as &quot;middle age&quot; and can be defined as the time of ages about 40–45 to about 60–65. Many changes may occur between young adulthood and this stage. There is no universal consensus on what the exact definition of middle age is, but usual characteristics include the beginning of rapid decline of fertility, graying of hair, and other physical changes.

Those in middle age continue to develop relationships and adapt to changes in relationships. Such changes are highly evident in the maturing relationships between growing or grown children and aging parents. Community involvement is fairly typical of this stage of adulthood, as is continued career development.

== Physical characteristics ==
Middle-aged adults may begin to show visible signs of aging. This process can be more rapid in women who have osteoporosis. Changes might occur in the nervous system. The ability to perform complex tasks remains intact. In the normal range of 45 to 55, women experience menopause, which ends natural fertility. Menopause can have many side effects. Changes can occur to skin, and other changes may include a decline in physical fitness, including a reduction in aerobic performance, a decrease in maximal heart rate, and graying and loss of hair. Sensory sensitivity in middle-aged adults has been shown to be one of the lowest. These measurements are generalities, and people may exhibit changes at different rates and times.

Mortality rates can begin to increase, due mainly to health issues like heart problems, cancer, hypertension, and diabetes. Still, the majority of middle-aged people in industrialized nations can expect to live into old age.

Starting around age 35, pregnant women are considered to be of advanced maternal age, and significant declines in fertility begin to occur that usually end with menopause around age 50.

Middle-aged urban adults who are experiencing frailty and poverty show an association with increased H2O2 induced oxidative DNA damage.

== Cognitive ==
Erik Erikson refers to this period of adulthood as generativity versus stagnation, the seventh of eight stages of Erikson&#x27;s stages of psychosocial development. People in middle age may experience some cognitive loss, which usually remains unnoticeable because life experiences and strategies get developed to compensate for any decrease in mental abilities.

During this stage, adults often strive to have things that will outlast them. Generativity, which is the concern and the commitment middle-aged people have for future generations, is a big part of development during this stage.

== Social and personality characteristics ==
For some, marital satisfaction remains intact, but other family relationships can become more difficult. Career satisfaction focuses more on inner satisfaction and contentedness and less on ambition and the desire to advance. Even so, career changes occur often. Middle age can be a time when people reexamine their lives by taking stock and evaluating their accomplishments. Morality may change and become more conscious. The perception that those in this stage of development of life undergo a so-called midlife crisis is a largely false one. Personality characteristics remain stable throughout this period, and relationships in middle age may continue to evolve into connections that are stable.

<doc id="1265737" wikidata="Q27108523" url="?curid=1265737" title="Vecuronium bromide">
<text>Vecuronium bromide, sold under the brand name Norcuron among others, is a medication used as part of general anesthesia to provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation. It is also used to help with endotracheal intubation; however, agents such as suxamethonium (succinylcholine) or rocuronium are generally preferred if this needs to be done quickly. It is given by injection into a vein. Effects are greatest at about 4 minutes and last for up to an hour.
Side effects may include low blood pressure and prolonged paralysis. Allergic reactions are rare. It is unclear if use in pregnancy is safe for the baby.

Vecuronium is in the aminosteroid neuromuscular-blocker family of medications and is of the non-depolarizing type. It works by competitively blocking the action of acetylcholine on skeletal muscles. The effects may be reversed with sugammadex or a combination of neostigmine and glycopyrrolate. To minimize residual blockade, reversal should only be attempted if some degree of spontaneous recovery has been achieved.
Vecuronium was approved for medical use in the United States in 1984 and is available as a generic medication. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines.

== Mechanism of action ==
Vecuronium operates by competing for the cholinoceptors at the motor end plate, thereby exerting its muscle-relaxing properties, which are used adjunctively to general anesthesia. Under balanced anesthesia, the time to recovery to 25% of control (clinical duration) is approximately 25 to 40 minutes after injection and recovery is usually 95% complete approximately 45 to 65 minutes after injection of an intubating dose. The neuromuscular blocking action of vecuronium is slightly enhanced in the presence of potent inhalation anesthetics. If vecuronium is first administered more than 5 minutes after the start of the inhalation of enflurane, isoflurane, or halothane, or when a steady state has been achieved, the intubating dose of vecuronium may be decreased by approximately 15%.

Vecuronium has an active metabolite, 3-desacetyl-vecuronium, that has 80% of the effect of vecuronium. Accumulation of this metabolite, which is cleared by the kidneys, can prolong the duration of action of the drug, particularly when an infusion is used in a person with kidney failure.

Reversal of vecuronium can be accomplished by administration of sugammadex which is a γ-cyclodextrin which encapsulates vecuronium preventing it from binding to receptors. Reversal can also be accomplished with neostigmine or other cholinesterase inhibitors, but their efficacy is lower than that of sugammadex.

==History==
As long ago as 1862, adventurer Don Ramon Paez described a Venezuelan poison, guachamaca, which the indigenous peoples used to lace sardines as bait for herons and cranes. If the head and neck of a bird so killed was cut off, the remainder of the flesh could be eaten safely. Paez also described the attempt of a Llanero woman to murder a rival to her lover&#x27;s affections with guachamaca and unintentionally killed 10 other people when her husband shared his food with their guests. It is probable that the plant was &quot;Malouetia nitida&quot; or &quot;Malouetia schomburgki&quot;.

The genus &quot;Malouetia&quot; (family &quot;Apocynaceae&quot;) is found in both South America and Africa. The botanist Robert E. Woodson Jr comprehensively classified the American species of &quot;Malouetia&quot; in 1935. At that time, only one African species of &quot;Malouetia&quot; was recognized, but the following year Woodson described a second: &quot;Malouetia bequaertiana&quot;, from the Belgian Congo.

In 1960, scientists reported the isolation of malouetine from the roots and bark of &quot;Malouetia bequaertiana&quot; Woodson by means of an ion exchange technique. Optimization of the aminosteroid nucleus led to a sequence of synthesized derivatives, ultimately leading to pancuronium bromide in 1964. The name was derived from p(iperidino)an(drostane)cur(arising)-onium.

A paper published in 1973 discussed the structure-activity relationships of a series of aminosteroid muscle relaxants, including the mono-quaternary analogue of pancuronium, later called vecuronium.

==Society and culture==

Vecuronium bromide has been used as part of a drug cocktail that prisons in the United States use for execution by lethal injection. Vecuronium is used to paralyze the prisoner and stop his or her breathing, in conjunction with a sedative and potassium chloride to stop the prisoner&#x27;s heart. Injections of vecuronium bromide without proper sedation allow the person to be fully awake but unable to move in response to pain.

In 2001, Japanese nurse Daisuke Mori was reported to have murdered 10 patients using vecuronium bromide. He was convicted of murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment.

In 2022, Vanderbilt University Medical Center nurse RaDonda Vaught was convicted of two felony charges in the death of a patient who was mistakenly administered vecuronium bromide, rather than the sedative midazolam, also known as Versed.

<text>Johannes Scherr (3 October 1817 – 21 November 1886) was a German-born cultural historian, writer, literary critic, educator and politician who spent most of his working life in Switzerland.

== Biography ==

Scherr was born in Hohenrechberg (today part of Schwäbisch Gmünd), Württemberg in October 1817. After studying philosophy and history at the University of Tübingen (1837–1840), he became master in a school conducted by his brother Thomas in Winterthur. In 1843 he moved to Stuttgart, and, entering the political arena with a pamphlet &quot;Württemberg im Jahr 1843&quot;, was elected in 1848 a member of the Württemberg House of Deputies; became leader of the democratic party in south Germany and, in consequence of his agitation for parliamentary reform in 1849, was obliged, to take refuge in Switzerland to avoid arrest. Condemned &quot;in contumaciam&quot; to fifteen years hard labor, he established himself in Zürich as &quot;Privatdozent&quot; in 1850, but moved in 1852 to Winterthur. In 1860 he was appointed professor of history and Swiss literature at the Polytechnicum in Zürich, in which city he died on 21 November 1886.

==Personal life==
In 1845, Scherr married the Swiss writer Maria Susanna Kübler who is remembered for her early cookbooks and household guides.

== Works ==
Scherr was a voluminous writer in the field of historical investigation into the civilization, literature, and manners and customs of his country. His works, characterized by their caustic wit and many peculiarities in point of diction, have largely a political bias, but are characterized by clearness of exposition and careful research. Noteworthy among his books are the following:
*&quot;Deutsche Kultur-und Sitten-Geschichte &quot; (&quot;History of German culture and customs,&quot; 1852–1853, new ed. 1897)
*&quot;Schiller und seine Zeit&quot; (&quot;Shiller and his times,&quot; 1859, new ed. 1876)
*&quot;Geschichte der deutschen Frauenwelt&quot; (&quot;History of German women,&quot; 1860, 4th edition 1879)
*&quot;Allgemeine Geschichte der Literatur&quot; (&quot;A history of literature,&quot; 1851, 9th edition 1895–1896)
*&quot;Geschichte der englischen Literatur&quot; (&quot;History of English literature,&quot; 1854, 2nd edition 1883)
*&quot;Blücher, seine Zeit und sein Leben&quot; (&quot;Life and times of Blücher,&quot; 1862, 4th edition 1887)
*&quot;Germania. Zwei Jahrtausende deutschen Lebens&quot; (&quot;Germania. Two millennia of German life,&quot; 1879, 6th edition by Hans Prutz 1905)
Scherr also wrote the humorous &quot;Sommertagebuch des weiland Dr Gastrosophiae, Jeremia Sauerampfer&quot; (1873); as a novelist he published the historical novels, &quot;Schiller&quot; (1856), and &quot;Michel, Geschichte eines Deutschen unserer Zeit&quot; (1858) which have passed through several editions.

With the exception of some of his stories (&quot;Novellenbuch&quot;, 10 volumes, 1873–1877) Scherr&#x27;s works have not appeared in a collected edition.

<doc id="1265740" wikidata="Q1530022" url="?curid=1265740" title="Religious organization">
<text>Religious activities generally need some infrastructure to be conducted. For this reason, there generally exist religion-supporting organizations, which are some form of organization that manages:

* the upkeep of places of worship, such as mosques, churches, temples, synagogues, chapels and other buildings or meeting places.
* the payment of salaries to religious leaders, such as Roman Catholic priests, Hindu priests, Protestant ministers, imams and rabbis.

In addition, such organizations usually have other responsibilities, such as the formation, nomination or appointment of religious leaders, the establishment of a corpus of doctrine, the disciplining of leaders and followers with respect to religious law, and the determination of qualification for membership.

==Legal status==
===Public organizations===
Some countries run the activities of one or more religions as part of their government, or as external organizations closely supported by the government. See state religion.

===Private organizations===
In some countries, the government is prohibited by law from establishing or supporting religions by separation of church and state, though there may be exceptions to such rules. Religions are thus necessarily supported by private organizations, generally funded by those who attend their services.

====France====
The French Republic is constitutionally &quot;laïque&quot; (roughly, secular). It is prohibited by a 1905 statute for the state to subsidize or recognize any religion, or to pay stipends; for historical reasons, this statute does not apply to the Alsace-Moselle area (where four religions are state-subsidized under the local law), to French Guiana (Catholic priests are employed by the local government, although this situation is likely to change) and to military chaplains (, there are indications that the statute of religious services to the military will be changed).

Religious organizations are not required to register, but may if they wish to apply for tax-exempt status or to gain official recognition. The French government defines two categories under which religious groups may register: &quot;associations cultuelles&quot; (associations of worship, which are exempt from taxes) and &quot;associations culturelles&quot; (cultural associations, which are not exempt from all taxes). Associations in these two categories are subject to certain management and financial disclosure requirements. An association of worship may organize only religious activities, defined as liturgical services and practices. A cultural association may engage in a profit-making activity. Although a cultural association is not exempt from taxes, it may receive government subsidies for its cultural and educational operations, such as schools. Religious groups normally register under both of these categories; the Mormons, for example, run strictly religious activities through their association of worship and operate a school under their cultural association.

Under the 1905 statute, religious groups must apply with the local prefecture to be recognized as an association of worship and receive tax-exempt status. The prefecture reviews the submitted documentation regarding the association&#x27;s purpose for existence. To qualify, the group&#x27;s purpose must be solely the practice of some form of religious ritual. Printing publications, employing a board president, or running a school may disqualify a group from receiving tax-exempt status. A common method is to run such activities in another financially separate association (&quot;cultural association&quot; or other similar denomination).

According to the 1905 law, associations of worship are not taxed on the donations that they receive. However, the prefecture may decide to review a group&#x27;s status if the association receives a large donation or legacy that comes to the attention of the tax authorities. If the prefecture determines that the association is not in fact in conformity with the 1905 law, its status may be changed, and it may be required to pay taxes at a rate of 60 per cent on present and past donations.

According to the 100 Catholic associations that are tax-exempt; a representative of the Ministry of Interior reports that the number of non-tax-exempt Catholic associations is too numerous to estimate accurately. More than 50 associations of the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses have tax-free status.

====United States====
In the United States, a faith-based organization (FBO) is an organization that has its mission based on a faith system. The U.S. IRS  designates tax exemptions for those legal entities that qualify. To be a legal entity in America each organization must file the required documents in the U.S. states in which they operate.

=== Croatia ===
The legal status of religious organizations (religious communities in Croatia) is determined by the Law on the Legal Status of Religious Communities. The Ministry of Justice and Administration keeps records in which all religious communities in Croatia are registered. 

In Croatia, religious communities are non-profit legal entities. The Croatian government established the Commission for Relations with Religious Communities in order to regulate legal relations between the state and religious organizations.

In Croatia, religious communities have the right to establish religious schools and preschool education institutions, and in accordance with the contract between the religious community and the Government of the Republic of Croatia.

Religious communities have the right to organize religious education classes in public primary and secondary schools, in accordance with the contract between the religious community and the Government of the Republic of Croatia and at the request of the student&#x27;s parents.

Every religious community has the right to pastoral care of their believers who are in health and social welfare institutions, as well as in penitentiaries and prisons, in accordance with the contract between the religious community and the Government of the Republic of Croatia.

Religious communities can acquire funds through income from their property, from the profits of commercial companies, by providing religious services, by inheritance and by gifts, from voluntary contributions, through charitable, educational and other generally useful activities.

Religious communities in Croatia can receive funds from the state and local budgets under special conditions, depending on their contribution to the national culture and in accordance with the generally beneficial activities of the religious community.

In Croatia, religious communities do not pay tax on real estate transactions, and tax on contributions made by citizens. Also, religious communities do not pay customs duties and taxes on items they receive from foreign religious communities.

The basic conditions for registering a new religious community in Croatia are that the religious community has at least 500 believers and proof that the newly founded religious community has existed as an association for at least 5 years before submitting the application.

<text>Scamilli impares (unequal steps, Fr. &quot;escabeaux inegales&quot;; Ger. &quot;Schutzstege&quot;), in architecture, is a term quoted by Vitruvius when referring to the rise given to the stylobate in the centre of the front and sides of a Greek temple.

His explanation is not clear; he states (iii. 4) that, if set out level, the stylobate would have the appearance of being sunk in the centre, so that it is necessary that there should be an addition by means of small steps (&quot;scamilli impares&quot;). In book v. chap. 9, he again refers to the addition on the stylobate. The interpretation of his meaning by Penrose and other authorities is generally assumed to be the addition which it was necessary to leave on the lower frustum of the Doric column, or on the lower portion of the base of the Ionic column, so as to give them a proper bearing on the curved surface of the stylobate; when levelling ground, however, it is sometimes the custom to fix at intervals small bricks or tiles which are piled up until the upper surfaces of all of them are absolutely level.

If, as an alternative, these piles were so arranged as to rise towards the centre, instead of a level a slightly curved surface might be obtained, and the term unequal steps would apply to them. This was the opinion of M. Bernouf, a French author, who points out that &quot;scamilus&quot; is a diminutive of &quot;scamnum&quot;, a small step (Fr. &quot;petit banc&quot;), which in some parts of France is employed when levelling the surface of areas or courts. According to Penrose, the rise of the curved stylobate of the Parthenon had already been obtained in the stereobate carrying it, long before the problem of bedding the columns on the curve had arisen.

<text>General Sir James Yorke Scarlett (1 February 1799 – 6 December 1871) was a British Army officer and hero of the Crimean War who led the Charge of the Heavy Brigade during the Battle of Balaclava on 25 October 1854.

==Early life==
The second son of the 1st Baron Abinger, he was born in London and educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1835, he married Charlotte Anne Hargreaves, a coal heiress from Burnley, the town becoming his adopted home.

==Career==
Scarlett entered the army in 1818, as a cornet in the 18th Hussars; in 1830, he became a major in the 5th Dragoon Guards, whose Colonel was Sir John Slade (1762-1859). Slade served in the Peninsular War, where he was described as an officer of &#x27;limited ability, lacking initiative and nearly useless&#x27; and &#x27;that damned stupid fellow.&#x27; Combined with Slade&#x27;s age, this resulted in Scarlett&#x27;s appointment as Commanding Officer of the regiment in 1840, a post he held for nearly fourteen years. In 1854 he was close to retirement after an uneventful career during which he had not seen any active service. In this he was typical of the senior ranks of the British cavalry at the time, other than those posted to India.

===Crimean War===

In April 1854 Colonel Scarlett was appointed Brigadier-General of the Heavy Brigade of Cavalry, under Lord Lucan, Commander of the Cavalry Division. The 5th Dragoon Guards formed part of Scarlett&#x27;s Heavy Brigade which was sent to the Black Sea in 1854. There it suffered heavily from cholera in the camps of Varna.
During the Battle of Balaclava on the morning of 25 October 1854, the Russians had stormed a series of hills known as the Causeway Heights beyond which lay the &quot;Valley of Death&quot; where the Earl of Cardigan would lead the Light Brigade in one of the great military blunders of the nineteenth century.

Lord Raglan ordered that Scarlett should move eight squadrons of his brigade back to Kadikoi, to support the 93rd Highlanders defence of the British base at Balaklava. As Scarlett led his column of the Heavy Brigade across the sprawling tented camp of the Light Brigade, a Russian cavalry force of approximately 2000 was spotted just 800 yards from their left flank, at the top of the heights.

The 55-year-old Scarlett quickly assembled just 300 of his Inniskillings and Scots Greys (of Waterloo fame) at the foot of the heights, organising them into parade-perfect formation, and sounded the charge. As astounded onlookers watched from the rear, Scarlett led his red-clad &quot;Heavies&quot; into the centre of the grey mass of Russians. His attack was soon followed by rest of the column (the remainder of the Inniskillings and the 4th, and 5th Dragoon Guards). Even the two squadrons of 1st Royal Dragoons who had remained behind to hold the Brigade&#x27;s original position attacked on their own initiative. This action became known as the Charge of the Heavy Brigade and caused the enemy formation to collapse completely. The Russians were routed and retreated across the heights into the valley that shortly after would become so infamous. Although successful, it defied military doctrine of the time, as the Russians were more numerous and, more importantly, the charge was made uphill against an oncoming force.
Cardigan had observed the action with his &quot;Lights&quot; from a short distance away, and had he used his initiative and chosen this moment to finish what Scarlett had started, the Charge of the Light Brigade might well have been remembered as a success. Later when Cardigan finally led his men into the valley, the Earl of Lucan, Scarlett and the Heavies waited in reserve. Scarlett had started to advance in the hope of salvaging something from the disaster when Lucan, fearing the complete loss of the Light Brigade, sounded the retreat.

===After Balaclava===
For his services that day Scarlett was promoted major-general and in 1855 was made KCB. After a brief period of leave in England, he returned to the Crimea with the local rank of lieutenant-general to command the British cavalry. Following the Peace of Paris, Scarlett commanded the cavalry at Aldershot until 1857, was Lieutenant-Governor of Portsmouth and General Officer Commanding South West District from 1857 to 1860 and then Adjutant-General to the Forces from 1860 to 1865. In this capacity he accompanied Queen Victoria and Prince Albert at the Royal Volunteer Review in Holyrood Park in Edinburgh on 10 August 1860 where 22,000 soldiers paraded before a crowd of over 100,000.

He was made commander of the Aldershot Division, a post he held until his retirement in 1870. He had been made a GCB in 1869.

===Politics===
From 1837 until 1841 he was a Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Guildford. In retirement Scarlett again became involved in politics, standing for election to Parliament in Burnley at the 1868 general election, but was narrowly beaten by the Liberal candidate.

==Later life==
Scarlett died at his Bank Hall estate in Burnley, Lancashire, in December 1871, aged 72. He is buried at Church of St John the Divine, Holme Chapel, Cliviger, near Burnley. An estimated 60,000 people lined the streets of the Lancashire town for his funeral procession.

==Character==
While lacking direct military experience at the outbreak of the Crimean War, Brigadier Scarlett selected his aides-de-camp from able officers who had seen active service in India, and followed their advice. This was in marked contrast to other generals such as Cardigan, who for reasons of social snobbery looked down on &quot;Indian officers&quot;. Described as being brave, modest and sensible, Scarlett won popularity amongst the Heavy Brigade. An officer of the Light Brigade of Cavalry commented &quot;Good kind old fellow that he is, they are all very fond of him and will follow him anywhere&quot;.

==Memorials==

A memorial to Scarlett was installed in the Royal Garrison Church at Aldershot. It includes a marble bust of Scarlett flanked by two full-size marble cavalry troopers of his former regiments, the 18th Hussars and 5th Dragoon Guards, wearing VCs, four-bar Crimean War medals and Long Service and Good Conduct medals.

The brewery tap at Burnley&#x27;s Moorhouse&#x27;s Brewery is named in his honour.

==In fiction==
Scarlett appears as a character in Flashman at the Charge (1973) by George MacDonald Fraser, which includes a fictionalised version of the Charge of the Heavy Brigade. He is portrayed as an inexperienced military commander, yet none-the-less charismatic and effective.

He appears in the 1968 film, &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot;. He was played by Leo Britt.

<text>The Younger Futhark (), also called Scandinavian runes, is a runic alphabet and a reduced form of the Elder Futhark, with only 16 characters, in use from about the 9th century, after a &quot;transitional period&quot; during the 7th and 8th centuries.
The reduction happened at the same time as phonetic changes that led to a greater number of different phonemes in the spoken language, when Proto-Norse evolved into Old Norse. Also, the writing custom avoided carving the same rune consecutively for the same sound, so the spoken distinction between long and short vowels was lost in writing. Thus, the language included distinct sounds and minimal pairs that were written the same.

The Younger Futhark is divided into long-branch (Danish) and short-twig (Swedish and Norwegian) runes; in the 10th century, it was further expanded by the &quot;Hälsinge Runes&quot; or staveless runes.

The lifetime of the Younger Futhark corresponds roughly to the Viking Age. Their use declined after the Christianization of Scandinavia; most writing in Scandinavia from the 12th century was in the Latin alphabet, but the runic scripts survived in marginal use in the form of the medieval runes (in use AD 1100–1500) and the Latinised Dalecarlian runes (AD 1500–1910).

==History==

Usage of the Younger Futhark is found in Scandinavia and Viking Age settlements abroad, probably in use from the 9th century onward. During the Migration Period Elder Futhark had been an actual &quot;secret&quot; known to only a literate elite, with only some 350 surviving inscriptions. Literacy in the Younger Futhark became widespread in Scandinavia, as witnessed by the great number of Runestones (some 3,000), sometimes inscribed with almost casual notes.

During a phase from about 650 to 800, some inscriptions mixed the use of Elder and Younger Futhark runes. 
Examples of inscriptions considered to be from this period include DR 248 from Snoldelev, DR 357 from Stentoften, DR 358 from Gummarp, DR 359 from Istaby, and DR 360 from Björketorp, and objects such as the Setre Comb (N KJ40). Ög 136 in Rök, which uses Elder Futhark runes to encrypt part of the text, and Ög 43 in Ingelstad, which uses a single Elder Futhark rune as an ideogram, are also sometimes included as transitional inscriptions.

By the late 8th century, the reduction from 24 to 16 runes was complete. The main change was that the difference between voiced and unvoiced consonants was no longer expressed in writing. Other changes are the consequence of sound changes that separate Old Norse from Proto-Norse and Common Germanic (mostly changes to the vowel system).
*The first &quot;ætt&quot; was reduced to its first six letters, &quot;fuþąrk&quot;, losing the &quot;g&quot; and &quot;w&quot; runes (the old &quot;a&quot; rune is transliterated as &quot;ą&quot; for Old Norse as the phoneme it expressed had become more closed). 
*The second &quot;ætt&quot; lost the &quot;æ&quot; and &quot;p&quot; runes. The &quot;j&quot; rune was rendered superfluous due to Old Norse sound changes, but was kept with the new sound value of &quot;a&quot;. The old &quot;z&quot; rune was kept (transliterated in the context of Old Norse as &quot;ʀ&quot;) but moved to the end of the rune row in the only change of letter ordering in Younger Futhark. 
*The third &quot;ætt&quot; was reduced by four runes, losing the &quot;e&quot;, &quot;ŋ&quot;, &quot;o&quot; and &quot;d&quot; runes.
In tabular form:

The Younger Futhark became known in Europe as the &quot;alphabet of the Norsemen&quot;, and was studied in the interest of trade and diplomatic contacts, referred to as in Frankish Fulda (possibly by Walahfrid Strabo) and &quot;Ogham of the Scandinavians&quot; in the Book of Ballymote.
==Rune names==
The names of the 16 runes of the Younger futhark are recorded in the Icelandic and Norwegian rune poems. The names are:

* fé (&quot;wealth&quot;)
* úr (&quot;iron&quot;/&quot;rain&quot;)
* Thurs (&quot;thurs&quot;, a type of entity, see jötunn)
* As/Oss (&quot;(a) god&quot;)
* reið (&quot;ride&quot;)
* kaun (&quot;ulcer&quot;)
* hagall (&quot;hail&quot;)
* nauðr (&quot;need&quot;)
* ísa/íss (&quot;ice&quot;)
* ár (&quot;plenty&quot;)
* sól (&quot;Sun&quot;, personified as a deity—see Sól (Germanic mythology))
* Týr (&quot;Týr, a deity&quot;)
* björk/bjarkan/bjarken (&quot;birch&quot;)
* maðr (&quot;man, human&quot;)
* lögr (&quot;sea&quot;)
* yr (&quot;yew&quot;)

From comparison with Anglo-Saxon and Gothic letter names, most of these names directly continue the names of the Elder Futhark runes. The exceptions to this are:
* yr which continues the name of the unrelated Eihwaz rune;
* &quot;thurs&quot; and &quot;kaun&quot;, in which cases the Old Norse, Anglo-Saxon and Gothic traditions diverge.

==Variants==
The Younger Futhark is divided into long-branch (Danish) and short-twig (Swedish and Norwegian) runes. The difference between the two versions has been a matter of controversy. A general opinion is that the difference was functional, i.e. the long-branch runes were used for documentation on stone, whereas the short-twig runes were in everyday use for private or official messages on wood.

=== Long-branch runes ===

The long-branch runes are the following rune signs:

=== Short-twig runes ===
In the short-twig runes (or Rök runes), nine runes appear as simplified variants of the long-branch runes, while the remaining seven have identical shapes:

=== Hälsinge runes (staveless runes) ===
Hälsinge runes are so named because in modern times they were first noticed in the Hälsingland region of Sweden. Later, other inscriptions with the same runes were found in other parts of Sweden. They were used between the 10th and 12th centuries. The runes seem to be a simplification of the Swedish–Norwegian runes and lack certain strokes, hence the name &quot;staveless&quot;. They cover the same set of staves as the other Younger Futhark alphabets. This variant has no assigned Unicode range (as of Unicode 12.1).

==Descendant scripts==

===Medieval===
In the Middle Ages, the Younger Futhark in Scandinavia was expanded, so that it once more contained one sign for each phoneme of the old Norse language. Dotted variants of voiceless signs were introduced to denote the corresponding voiced consonants, or vice versa, voiceless variants of voiced consonants, and several new runes also appeared for vowel sounds. Inscriptions in medieval Scandinavian runes show a large number of variant rune-forms, and some letters, such as &quot;s,&quot; &quot;c&quot; and &quot;z,&quot; were often used interchangeably.

Medieval runes were in use until the 15th century. Of the total number of Norwegian runic inscriptions preserved today, most are medieval runes. Notably, more than 600 inscriptions using these runes have been discovered in Bergen since the 1950s, mostly on wooden sticks (the so-called Bryggen inscriptions). This indicates that runes were in common use side by side with the Latin alphabet for several centuries. Indeed, some of the medieval runic inscriptions are actually in the Latin language.

After the 15th century, interest in rune history and their use in magical processes grew in Iceland, with various studies beginning with Third Grammatical Icelandic Treatise - Málfræðinnar grundvǫllr. Publications written in Latin and Danish in the 1600s included works by Arngrímur Jónsson, Runólfur Jónsson and Olaus Wormius. Content from these along with Icelandic and Norwegian Rune Poems appeared frequently in subsequent manuscripts written in Iceland.

===Early modern===

According to Carl-Gustav Werner, &quot;in the isolated province of Dalarna in Sweden a mix of runes and Latin letters developed&quot;. The Dalecarlian runes came into use in the early 16th century and remained in some use up to the 20th century. Some discussion remains on whether their use was an unbroken tradition throughout this period or whether people in the 19th and 20th centuries learned runes from books written on the subject. The character inventory is suitable for transcribing modern Swedish and the local Dalecarlian language.

== In modern culture ==

The logo for the wireless communication technology Bluetooth  is a bind rune merging ᚼ (hagall, H) and ᛒ (bjarkan, B), the initials of tenth-century Danish king Harald Bluetooth after whom the technology is named.

<doc id="1265772" wikidata="Q2005583" url="?curid=1265772" title="Elder Futhark">
<text>The Elder Futhark (or Fuþark, ), also known as the Older Futhark, Old Futhark, or Germanic Futhark, is the oldest form of the runic alphabets. It was a writing system used by Germanic peoples for Northwest Germanic dialects in the Migration Period. Inscriptions are found on artifacts including jewelry, amulets, plateware, tools, and weapons, as well as runestones, from the 2nd to the 8th centuries. 

In Scandinavia, beginning in the late 8th century, the script was simplified to the Younger Futhark, while the Anglo-Saxons and Frisians instead extended it, giving rise to the Anglo-Saxon futhorc. Both the Anglo-Saxon futhorc and the Younger Futhark remained in use during the Early and the High Middle Ages respectively, but knowledge of how to read the Elder Futhark was forgotten until 1865, when it was deciphered by Norwegian scholar Sophus Bugge.

==Description==
The Elder Futhark (named after the initial phoneme of the first six rune names: F, U, Þ, A, R and K) has 24 runes, often arranged in three groups of eight runes; each group is in modern times called an &quot;ætt&quot; (pl. &quot;ættir&quot;; meaning &#x27;clan, group&#x27;, although sometimes thought to mean eight). What the groups were originally called remains unknown. In the following table, each rune is given with its common transliteration:

þ corresponds to (unvoiced) or (voiced) (like the English digraph -&quot;th&quot;-).

ï is also transliterated as æ and may have been either a diphthong or a vowel close to or . z was Proto-Germanic , and evolved into Proto-Norse and is also transliterated as ʀ. The remaining transliterations correspond to the IPA symbol of their approximate value.

The earliest known sequential listing of the alphabet dates to 400 AD and is found on the Kylver Stone in Gotland, [ᚠ] and [ᚹ] only partially inscribed but widely authenticated:

Two instances of another early inscription were found on the two Vadstena and Mariedamm bracteates (6th century), showing the division in three ætts, with the positions of ï, p and o, d inverted compared to the Kylver stone:
:f u þ a r k g w; h n i j ï p z s; t b e m l ŋ o d
The Grumpan bracteate presents a listing from 500 which is identical to the one found on the previous bracteates but incomplete:
:f u þ a r k g w ... h n i j ï p (z) ... t b e m l (ŋ) (o) d

==Origins==
===Derivation from Italic alphabets===

The Elder Futhark runes are commonly believed to originate in the Old Italic scripts: either a North Italic variant (Etruscan or Rhaetic alphabets), or the Latin alphabet itself. Derivation from the Greek alphabet via Gothic contact to Byzantine Greek culture was a popular theory in the 19th century, but has been ruled out since the dating of the Vimose inscriptions to the 2nd century (whereas the Goths were in contact with Greek culture only from the early 3rd century). Conversely, the Greek-derived 4th-century Gothic alphabet does have two letters derived from runes, (from Jer j) and (from Uruz u).

The main problem is that a derivation from the classical Latin alphabet as used in the 1st and 2nd centuries, while the most obvious possibility suggested by the historical, geographical and cultural context, is not as straightforward as could be expected, especially regarding letter shapes, and many scholars are not satisfied by it. Instead, it is observed that many runic letters suspiciously resemble letters with similar sound values from alphabets used in the Alpine region in the last centuries BC, alphabets which are all derived from the northern Etruscan alphabet; however, again, there is no derivation so straightforward as to convince most scholars.

The angular shapes of the runes, presumably an adaptation to the incision in wood or metal, are not a Germanic innovation, but a property that is shared with other early alphabets, including the Old Italic ones (compare, for example, the Duenos inscription). The 4th century BC Negau helmet B inscription features a Germanic name, &quot;Harigastiz&quot;, in a North Etruscan alphabet, and may be a testimony of the earliest contact of Germanic speakers with alphabetic writing. Similarly, the Meldorf inscription of 50 may qualify as &quot;proto-runic&quot; use of the Latin alphabet by Germanic speakers. The Rhaetic &quot;alphabet of Bolzano&quot; in particular seems to fit the letter shapes well. The spearhead of Kovel, dated to 200 AD, sometimes advanced as evidence of a peculiar Gothic variant of the runic alphabet, bears an inscription &quot;tilarids&quot; that may in fact be in an Old Italic rather than a runic alphabet, running right to left with a &quot;T&quot; and a &quot;D&quot; closer to the Latin or Etruscan than to the Bolzano or runic alphabets. Perhaps an &quot;eclectic&quot; approach can yield the best results for the explanation of the origin of the runes: most shapes of the letters can be accounted for when deriving them from several distinct North Italic writing systems: The p rune has a parallel in the Camunic alphabet, while it has been argued that d derives from the shape of the letter &quot;san&quot; (= ś) in Lepontic where it seems to represent the sound /d/.

The g, a, f, i, t, m and l runes show no variation, and are generally accepted as identical to the Old Italic or Latin letters &quot;X&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;M&quot; and &quot;L&quot;, respectively. There is also wide agreement that the u, r, k, h, s, b and o runes respectively correspond directly to &quot;V&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;H&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;B&quot; and &quot;O&quot;.

The remaining ten runes of uncertain derivation may either be original innovations, or adaptions of otherwise unneeded Latin letters of the classical Latin alphabet (1st century, ignoring marginalized &quot;K&quot;). There are conflicting scholarly opinions regarding them:

# ᛖ may be from &quot;E&quot;.
# ᚾ may be from Raetic &quot;N&quot;.
# ᚦ may be from Latin &quot;D&quot; or from Raetic &quot;Θ&quot;.
# Ƿ may be from &quot;Q&quot;, from Latin &quot;P&quot;, or from Raetic &quot;W&quot;.
# ᛇ may be from Latin &quot;Z&quot;, from Latin &quot;Y&quot;, or from Raetic &quot;E&quot;.
# ᛉ may be from Raetic &quot;Z&quot;, from Latin &quot;Y&quot;, or from Etruscan &quot;𐌙&quot;.
# ᛜ may be from Latin &quot;Q&quot;.
# ᛃ may be from Latin &quot;G&quot;.
# ᛈ may be from Raetic &quot;P&quot; or may be an original Germanic innovation.
# ᛞ may be from Raetic &quot;D&quot;, from Lepontic &quot;san&quot; (ś), or may be an original Germanic innovation.

Of the 24 runes in the classical futhark row attested from 400 (on the Kylver stone), ï, p and ŋ are unattested in the earliest inscriptions of c. 175 to 400, while e in this early period mostly takes a Π-shape, its M-shape () gaining prevalence only from the 5th century. Similarly, the s rune may have either three () or four () strokes (and more rarely five or more), and only from the 5th century does the variant with three strokes become prevalent.

The &quot;mature&quot; runes of the 6th to 8th centuries tend to have only three directions of strokes, the vertical and two diagonal directions. Early inscriptions also show horizontal strokes: these appear in the case of e (mentioned above), but also in t, l, ŋ and h.

===Date and purpose of invention===
The general agreement dates the creation of the first runic alphabet to roughly the 1st century. Early estimates include the 1st century, and late estimates push the date into the 2nd century. The question is one of estimating the &quot;findless&quot; period separating the script&#x27;s creation from the Vimose finds of c. 160. If either ï or z indeed derive from Latin &quot;Y&quot; or respectively &quot;Z&quot;, as suggested by Odenstedt, the first century BC is ruled out, because these letters were only introduced into the Latin alphabet during the reign of Augustus.

Other scholars are content to assume a findless period of a few decades, pushing the date into the early 2nd century. Pedersen (and with him Odenstedt) suggests a period of development of about a century to account for their assumed derivation of the shapes of þ and j from Latin &quot;D&quot; and &quot;G&quot;.

The invention of the script has been ascribed to a single person or a group of people who had come into contact with Roman culture, maybe as mercenaries in the Roman army, or as merchants. The script was clearly designed for epigraphic purposes, but opinions differ in stressing either magical, practical or simply playful (graffiti) aspects. concludes that in its earliest stage, the runic script was an &quot;artificial, playful, not really needed imitation of the Roman script&quot;, much like the Germanic bracteates were directly influenced by Roman currency, a view that is accepted by in the light of the very primitive nature of the earliest (2nd to 4th century) inscription corpus.

==Rune names==
Each rune most probably had a name, chosen to represent the sound of the rune itself according to the principle of acrophony.

The Old English names of all 24 runes of the Elder Futhark, along with five names of runes unique to the Anglo-Saxon runes, are preserved in the Old English rune poem, compiled in the 7th century. These names are in good agreement with medieval Scandinavian records of the names of the 16 Younger Futhark runes, and to some extent also with those of the letters of the Gothic alphabet (recorded by Alcuin in the 9th century). Therefore, it is assumed that the names go back to the Elder Futhark period, at least to the 5th century. There is no positive evidence that the full row of 24 runes had been completed before the end of the 4th century, but it is likely that at least some runes had their name before that time.

This concerns primarily the runes used magically, especially the Teiwaz and Ansuz runes, which are taken to symbolize or invoke deities in sequences such as that on the Lindholm amulet (3rd or 4th century).

Reconstructed names in Common Germanic can easily be given for most runes. Exceptions are the &quot;þ&quot; rune (which is given different names in Anglo-Saxon, Gothic and Scandinavian traditions) and the &quot;z&quot; rune (whose original name is unknown, and preserved only in corrupted form from Old English tradition). The 24 Elder Futhark runes are:
Each rune derived its sound from the first phoneme of the rune&#x27;s respective name, with the exception of &quot;Ingwaz&quot; and &quot;Algiz&quot;: the Proto-Germanic &quot;z&quot; sound of the &quot;Algiz&quot; rune never occurred in a word-initial position. The phoneme acquired an &quot;r&quot;-like quality in Proto-Norse, usually transliterated with ʀ, and finally merged with r in Icelandic, rendering the rune superfluous as a letter. Similarly, the &quot;ng&quot;-sound of the &quot;Ingwaz&quot; rune does not occur word-initially.
The names come from the vocabulary of daily life and mythology, some trivial, some beneficent and some inauspicious:
* Mythology: Tiwaz, Thurisaz, Ingwaz, God, Man, Sun.
* Nature and environment: Sun, day, year, hail, ice, lake, water, birch, yew, pear, elk, aurochs.
* Daily life and human condition: Man, need/constraint, wealth/cattle, horse, estate/inheritance, slag/protection from evil, ride/journey, year/harvest, gift, joy, need, ulcer/illness.

== IPA vowels and consonants ==

The following charts show the probable sound values of each rune based upon Proto-Germanic phonology.

ᛇ has been excluded from the table because what its sound might have been is highly disputed. It may have been a diphthong, or it may have been a monophthong falling somewhere within the range of [ɪ] to [æ]. The only certain fact is that it represented a front vowel.

==Inscription corpus==

Old Futhark inscriptions were found on artifacts scattered between the Carpathians and Lappland, with the highest concentration in Denmark. They are usually short inscriptions on jewelry (bracteates, fibulae, belt buckles), utensils (combs, spinning whorls) or weapons (lance tips, seaxes) and were mostly found in graves or bogs.

===Scandinavian inscriptions===
Words frequently appearing in inscriptions on bracteates with possibly magical significance are alu, laþu and laukaz. While their meaning is unclear, alu has been associated with &quot;ale, intoxicating drink&quot;, in a context of ritual drinking, and laukaz with &quot;leek, garlic&quot;, in a context of fertility and growth. An example of a longer early inscription is on a 4th-century axe-handle found in Nydam, Jutland: wagagastiz / alu:??hgusikijaz:aiþalataz (&quot;wagagastiz&quot; &quot;wave-guest&quot; could be a personal name, the rest has been read as alu:wihgu sikijaz:aiþalataz with a putative meaning &quot;wave/flame-guest, from a bog, alu, I, oath-sayer consecrate/fight&quot;. The obscurity even of emended readings is typical for runic inscriptions that go beyond simple personal names). A term frequently found in early inscriptions is Erilaz, apparently describing a person with knowledge of runes.

The oldest known runic inscription dates to 160 and is found on the Vimose Comb discovered in the bog of Vimose, Funen. The inscription reads harja, either a personal name or an epithet, viz. Proto-Germanic &quot;*harjaz&quot; (PIE &quot;&quot;) &quot;warrior&quot;, or simply the word for &quot;comb&quot; (&quot;*hārijaz&quot;). Another early inscription is found on the Thorsberg chape (200), probably containing the theonym Ullr.

The typically Scandinavian runestones begin to show the transition to Younger Futhark from the 6th century, with transitional examples like the Björketorp or Stentoften stones. In the early 9th century, both the older and the younger futhark were known and used, which is shown on the Rök runestone where the runemaster used both.

The oldest known runestone, the Svingerud Runestone, dates to the Roman Iron Age, c. 1–250 CE, and was found in Ringerike, Norway, in autumn 2021. The inscription has several sections, notably a name idiberug (possibly idiberun), which could be interpreted as one of several names, including &quot;Idibera&quot;, &quot;Idibergu&quot;, or the family name &quot;Idiberung&quot;. The first three letters of the Elder Futhark, ᚠ (f), ᚢ (u) and ᚦ (th), are also found on the stone.

The longest known inscription in the Elder Futhark, and one of the youngest, consists of some 200 characters, is found on the Eggjum stone, dated to the early 8th century, and may even contain a stanza of Old Norse poetry.

The Caistor-by-Norwich astragalus reading raïhan &quot;deer&quot; is notable as the oldest inscription of the British Isles, dating to 400, the very end of Roman Britain.

===Continental inscriptions===
The oldest inscriptions (before 500) found on the Continent are divided into two groups, the area of the North Sea coast and Northern Germany (including parts of the Netherlands) associated with the Saxons and Frisians on one hand (part of the &quot;North Germanic &quot;Koine&quot;&quot;), and loosely scattered finds from along the Oder to south-eastern Poland, as far as the Carpathian Mountains (e.g. the ring of Pietroassa in Romania), associated with East Germanic peoples. The latter group disappeared during the 5th century at the time of contact of the Goths with the Roman Empire and their conversion to Christianity.

In this early period, there is no specifically West Germanic runic tradition. This changes from the early 6th century, and for about one century (520 to 620), an Alamannic &quot;runic province&quot; emerges, with examples on fibulae, weapon parts and belt buckles. As in the East Germanic case, use of runes subsides with Christianization, in the case of the Alamanni in the course of the 7th century.

===Distribution===
There are some 350 known Elder Futhark inscriptions with 81 known inscriptions from the South (Germany, Austria, Switzerland) and 267 from Scandinavia. The precise numbers are debatable because of some suspected forgeries, and some disputed inscriptions (identification as &quot;runes&quot; vs. accidental scratches, simple ornaments or Latin letters). 133 Scandinavian inscriptions are on bracteates (compared to 2 from the South), and 65 are on runestones (no Southern example is extant). Southern inscriptions are predominantly on fibulae (43, compared to 15 in Scandinavia). The Scandinavian runestones belong to the later period of the Elder Futhark, and initiate the boom of medieval Younger Futhark stones (with some 6,000 surviving examples). As of 2021, one inscription was found in a settlement associated with Slavs.

Elder Futhark inscriptions were rare, with very few active literati, in relation to the total population, at any time, so that knowledge of the runes was probably an actual &quot;secret&quot; throughout the Migration period. Of 366 lances excavated at Illerup, only 2 bore inscriptions. A similar ratio is estimated for Alemannia, with an estimated 170 excavated graves to every inscription found.

Estimates of the total number of inscriptions produced are based on the &quot;minimal runological estimate&quot; of 40,000 (ten individuals making ten inscriptions per year for four centuries). The actual number was probably considerably higher. The 80 known Southern inscriptions are from some 100,000 known graves. With an estimated total of 50,000,000 graves (based on population density estimates), some 80,000 inscriptions would have been produced in total in the Merovingian South alone (and maybe close to 400,000 in total, so that of the order of 0.1% of the corpus has come down to us), and estimates a population of several hundred active literati throughout the period, with as many as 1,600 during the Alamannic &quot;runic boom&quot; of the 6th century.

==Unicode==

The Elder Futhark is encoded in Unicode within the unified Runic range, 16A0–16FF. Among the freely available TrueType fonts that include this range are Junicode and FreeMono. 
The Kylver Stone row encoded in Unicode reads:

Encoded separately are the double-barred &quot;h&quot;-rune, and a graphical variant of the &quot;ng&quot;-rune, . These two have separate codepoints because they become independent characters in the Anglo-Saxon futhorc. The numerous other graphical variants of Elder Futhark runes are considered glyph variants better rendered by the use of different fonts and so not given Unicode codepoints. Similarly, bind runes are considered ligatures and not given Unicode codepoints. The only bindrunes that can arguably be rendered as a single Unicode glyph are those that coincidentally look exactly like another rune, e.g. the double ᛚ bindrune is visually identical to ᛏ.

<text>The Central Philippine languages are the most geographically widespread demonstrated group of languages in the Philippines, being spoken in southern Luzon, Visayas, Mindanao, and Sulu. They are also the most populous, including Tagalog (and Filipino), Bikol, and the major Visayan languages Cebuano, Hiligaynon, Waray, Kinaray-a, and Tausug, with some forty languages all together.

==Classification==

===Overview===
The languages are generally subdivided thus (languages in &quot;italics&quot; refer to a single language):
*Kasiguranin–Tagalog (at least three dialects found in southern Luzon)
*Bikol (eight languages in the Bicol Peninsula)
*Bisayan (eighteen languages spoken in the whole Visayas, as well as southeastern Luzon, northeastern Mindanao and Sulu)
*Mansakan (eleven languages of the Davao Region, including Bahasapil)
There are in addition several Aeta hill-tribal languages of uncertain affiliation: Ata, Sorsogon Ayta, Tayabas Ayta, Karolanos (Northern Binukidnon), Magahat (Southern Binukidnon), Sulod, and Umiray Dumaget.

Most of the Central Philippine languages in fact form a dialect continuum and cannot be sharply distinguished as separate languages. Blust (2009) notes that the relatively low diversity found among the Visayan languages is due to recent population expansions.

===Zorc (1977)===
The expanded tree of the Central Philippine languages below is given in David Zorc&#x27;s 1977 Ph.D. dissertation. The Visayan subgrouping is Zorc&#x27;s own work, while the Bikol subgrouping is from McFarland (1974) and the Mansakan subgrouping from Gallman (1974).

Individual languages are marked by &quot;italics&quot;, and primary branches by bold italics.

===Gallman (1997)===
Andrew Gallman (1997) rejects Zorc&#x27;s classification of the Mansakan languages and Mamanwa as primary branches of the Central Philippine languages coordinate to the Bisayan languages. Instead, he groups Mansakan, Mamanwa and the Southern Bisayan languages together into an &quot;East Mindanao&quot; subgroup, which links up with the remaining Bisayan branches in a &quot;South Central Philippine&quot; subgroup:
*Central Philippine
**&quot;Tagalog&quot;
**&quot;Bikol&quot;
**South Central Philippine

***Banton
***Central Bisayan
***Cebuan

*****&quot;Davawenyo (Digos)&quot;
****South East Mindanao
*****&quot;Mandaya (Kabasagan)&quot;
*****&quot;Mandaya (Caraga)&quot;
*****&quot;Mansaka, Mandaya (Maragusan), Mandaya (Boso)&quot;
******(Branch)
*******&quot;Mandaya (Islam)&quot;
*******&quot;Kalagan (Kaagan), Kalagan (Tagakaulu)&quot;
===Greater Central Philippine (Blust)===

Blust (1991) notes that the central and southern Philippines has low linguistic diversity. Based on exclusively shared lexical innovations, he posits a Greater Central Philippine subgroup that puts together the Central Philippine branch with South Mangyan, Palawan, Danao, Manobo, Subanon and Gorontalo–Mongondow languages, the latter found in northern Sulawesi.

<text>Quintus Terentius Scaurus was a Latin grammarian who flourished during the reigns of Trajan and Hadrian.

He was the author of an &quot;ars grammatica&quot; and commentaries on Horace, Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; and perhaps Plautus. Under his name, two fragments are extant—the longer from his work on orthography (&quot;De orthographia&quot;), the shorter (chiefly on the use of prepositions) from another grammatical work. They have both been published by Heinrich Keil in &quot;Scriptores de orthographia&quot;, the 7th volume of his &quot;Grammatici Latini&quot; (Teubner, 1880); the &quot;De orthographia&quot; has appeared in a new edition prepared by Federico Biddau (Weidmann, 2008).

<text>The Scavenger&#x27;s daughter, also known as the Skevington&#x27;s gyves, iron shackle, stork, or Spanish A-frame was a type of torture device invented during the reign of King Henry VIII of England.

==History==

The Scavenger&#x27;s Daughter (or Skevington&#x27;s Daughter) was invented as an instrument of torture in the reign of Henry VIII by Sir Leonard Skevington, Lieutenant of the Tower of London, a son of Sir William Skeffington (died 1535), Lord Deputy of Ireland, and of his first wife, Margaret Digby.
The device consisted of a metal rack shaped into an A-frame; the victim&#x27;s head was strapped to the top point of the A, the hands at the midpoint, and the legs at the lower spread ends. The frame could fold, swinging the head down and forcing the knees up into a sitting position, compressing the body so as to force blood from the nose and ears.

The Scavenger&#x27;s Daughter was conceived as the perfect complement to the Duke of Exeter&#x27;s Daughter (the rack) because it worked according to the opposite principle - by compressing the body rather than stretching it.

The best-documented use is that on the Irishman Thomas Miagh, charged with being in contact with rebels in Ireland. It may be in connection with the Scavenger&#x27;s Daughter that Miagh carved on the wall of the Beauchamp Tower in the Tower of London, &quot;By torture straynge my truth was tried, yet of my libertie denied. 1581. Thomas Miagh.&quot;

Another victim of the Scavenger&#x27;s Daughter was Thomas Cottam, an English Catholic priest and martyr from Lancashire, who suffered it twice in the 1580s before being released. Cottam was executed in 1582 during the reign (1558-1603) of Henry&#x27;s daughter, Elizabeth I. Likewise, on 10 December 1580, the priest Luke Kirby was subjected to it.

The Scavenger&#x27;s Daughter is also known as Skevington&#x27;s gyves, as iron shackle, as the Stork (as in Italian &quot;cicogna&quot;) or as the Spanish A-frame. Further it is known as Skevington&#x27;s daughter, from which the more commonly known folk etymology using &quot;Scavenger&quot; is derived. There is a Scavenger&#x27;s daughter on display in the Tower of London museum.

<doc id="1265795" wikidata="Q333585" url="?curid=1265795" title="Toyo Ito">
<text>is a Japanese architect known for creating conceptual architecture, in which he seeks to simultaneously express the physical and virtual worlds. He is a leading exponent of architecture that addresses the contemporary notion of a &quot;simulated&quot; city, and has been called &quot;one of the world&#x27;s most innovative and influential architects.&quot;

In 2013, Ito was awarded the Pritzker Prize, one of architecture&#x27;s most prestigious prizes. He was a likely front-runner for the Pritzker Prize for the previous 10 years. A recent trend has seen less experienced and well-known winners, for example Chinese architect Wang Shu in 2012, and the award to Toyo Ito is seen as recognition of a lifetime&#x27;s achievement in architecture.

==Early life and education==
Ito was born in Seoul, Korea to Japanese parents on 1 June 1941 when Korea was under Japanese rule. In 1943, he moved to Japan with his mother and 
two sisters living until middle school age in rural Shimosuwa, Nagano Prefecture. Ito attended Hibiya High School in central Tokyo and graduated from the University of Tokyo&#x27;s department of architecture in 1965.

==Career==
After working for Kiyonori Kikutake Architect and Associates from 1965 to 1969 (alongside Itsuko Hasegawa), in 1971 he started his own studio in Tokyo, named Urbot (&quot;Urban Robot&quot;). In 1979, the studio name was changed to Toyo Ito &amp; Associates.

Throughout his early career Ito constructed numerous private house projects that expressed aspects of urban life in Japan. His most remarkable early conceptual contributions were made through projects of this scale, such as &quot;White U&quot; (1976) and &quot;Silver Hut&quot; (1984).

With the &quot;Pao for the Tokyo Nomad Girl&quot; projects in 1985 and 1989, Ito presented a vision of the life of an urban nomad, illustrative of typical lifestyles during the bubble economy period in Japan.

&quot;Tower of Winds&quot; (1986) and &quot;Egg of Winds&quot; (1991) are interactive landmarks in public spaces, resulting from a creative interpretation of contemporary technical possibilities. Whilst their function is in fact exhaust air outlets for the underground system below, their significance lies in Ito&#x27;s treatment of their opacity, one of the hallmarks of his work. Whilst appearing solid during the day, the perforated aluminium structures &quot;dissolve&quot; at night through the use of computer-controlled light systems which form an interactive display representing measured data such as noise levels in their surrounding vicinity.

Toyo Ito&#x27;s office is known as a training ground for talented younger architects. Architects who previously worked for his office include Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa (SANAA), Astrid Klein and Mark Dytham (KDa), Katsuya Fukushima, Makoto Yokomizo, and Akihisa Hirata.

===Critical vision===
Ito&#x27;s work is often said to have affinities with the ideas of philosophers such as Munesuke Mita and Gilles Deleuze. 
Ito has defined architecture as &quot;clothing&quot; for urban dwellers, particularly in the contemporary Japanese metropolis. This theme revolves around the equilibrium between the private life and the metropolitan, &quot;public&quot; life of an individual.

The current architecture of Toyo Ito expands on his work produced during the postmodern period, aggressively exploring the potentials of new forms. In doing so, he seeks to find new spatial conditions that manifest the philosophy of borderless beings.

===Exhibitions===
Ito&#x27;s work has been exhibited widely. In 1991, Ito used 130 video projectors to simulate the urban environment of Tokyo for the &quot;Visions of Japan&quot; exhibition at The Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Later, in 2000, his &quot;Vision and Reality&quot; at the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art also became a traveling exhibition. Ito similarly exploited the effect of video projection as a medium with which to exhibit architecture in his &quot;Blurring Architecture&quot; exhibition, initiated at the Suermondt-Ludwig-Museum in Aachen and traveling to four other cities (Tokyo, Antwerp, Auckland, and Wellington between 1999 and 2001).

Ito designed the &quot;Berlin-Tokyo/Tokyo-Berlin&quot; Exhibition (2006) at the Neue Nationalgalerie, Berlin. The design featured a smooth, undulating landscape that occupied almost the entirety of the museum&#x27;s main exhibition space. This exhibition, in collaboration with the Mori Art Museum, was one of the largest undertakings in the museum&#x27;s history. A major retrospective of Ito&#x27;s work was shown at the Tokyo Opera City Art Gallery in 2006 as &quot;Toyo Ito: The New &quot;Real&quot; in Architecture.&quot;

<doc id="1265798" wikidata="Q6615810" url="?curid=1265798" title="List of defunct Canadian railways">
<text>Most transportation historians date the history of Canada&#x27;s railways as beginning on February 25, 1832, with the incorporation of British North America&#x27;s first steam-powered railway, the Champlain and St. Lawrence Railroad (C&amp;SL). This line opened for traffic on July 21, 1836, although there are cases of animal-drawn mining tramways in Nova Scotia from the 18th century onward.

Thousands of railways followed the C&amp;SL and were given a charter by the federal or provincial governments, although in most cases these charters never resulted in an actual line being constructed. Many of these charters were so-called &quot;paper railways&quot; and were absorbed into other railways, that is they existed on paper with the actual trains bearing the name of another railway or system of railways. For example, Canadian National Railways alone consisted of over some 400 railways (see List of Canadian National Railways companies).

The reason for these &quot;paper&quot; railways was the ease of getting a charter. This was often done by a major railway such as Canadian Pacific Railway or Grand Trunk Railway, but the true interests were kept hidden to keep attention away from the efforts of competing major railways to gain access to another&#x27;s territory. In other instances local interests wanted a railway to connect their community with the main line of a major railway that did not enter their town, or to connect to another major railway for competitive reasons, to get lower freight rates, something that remains to this day. In many cases these local efforts were quickly taken over by a major railway to both expand its own network and to deny its competition access to traffic.

Streetcar and interurban railways were chartered provincially, in the case of Ontario under the Street Railway Act.

Railways that were not common carriers did not require a charter under the Railway Act since they were used primarily for the owners&#x27; own purposes, mainly logging and mining.

American railroads always operated in Canada under charters of subsidiary railways even though most had equipment lettered only for the parent company. Most U.S. railroads also operated in Canada through subsidiary railways with one exception: Wabash Railway which had not a mile of track in Canada as it crossed southern Ontario using trackage rights granted by the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada. These rights still exist with present-day Canadian National and Norfolk Southern, which runs into Windsor and Sarnia, Ontario. It formerly ran through Montreal, Quebec, but service was stopped due to such services causing traffic congestion.

This list of defunct railways includes only those railways that actually came into existence. Many were taken over by other railways or had a name change and thus continued to operate trains over the same tracks. A few ceased to exist because they went out of business and were abandoned and dismantled.

For simplicity on this list, Canadian National Railways (CNR) (pre-1960), Canadian National Railway (CN) (post-1960), Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), Grand Trunk Railway (GTR), and Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR) will be abbreviated for notations. Others will be abbreviated as required.

<doc id="1265810" wikidata="Q874868" url="?curid=1265810" title="Godfried Schalcken">
<text>Godfried Schalcken (8 October 1643 – 16 November 1706) was a Dutch artist who specialized in genre paintings and portraits. Schalcken was noted for his night scenes and mastery in reproducing the effect of candlelight. He painted in the highly polished style of the Leiden fijnschilders.

== Life and work ==
Godfried Schalcken was born in Made, North Brabant, the son of Cornelis Schalcken and Aletta Lydius. Before he was four years old, his family moved to Dordrecht, where his father became rector of the Latin school. Schalcke studied under Samuel van Hoogstraten in Dordrecht before he moved to Leiden, into the studio of Gerard Dou (1613–1675), one of Rembrandt&#x27;s most famous pupils. His earlier genre pictures very closely resemble Dou&#x27;s work. He worked in Leiden until c. 1675, then returning to Dordrecht until 1691, after which he settled in The Hague, where he continued to paint until his death, near age 63, in 1706. He also visited England (1692–1697), but his uncouth manners and bad temper alienated him from the society there. In 1703 he was employed by Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine in Düsseldorf. He died in The Hague.

==Work==
Schalcken painted several portraits, of which the half-length of William III of England, now in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, is a good example.

Like Dou, Schalcken specialized in small scenes lit by candlelight, a format favored by the Leiden fijnschilders. Examples are in Buckingham Palace, the Louvre, Vienna and Dresden.

His painting, &quot;Lady, Come into the Garden&quot; (Buckingham Palace), was singled out by Schalcken&#x27;s pupil and Dutch artistic biographer Arnold Houbraken as representative of his &quot;oeuvre&quot;. Other good examples are &quot;Old Woman Scouring a Pan&quot; and &quot;Soldier Giving Money to a Woman&quot; (London, National Gallery), &quot;Ceres Seeking Proserpine&quot; and &quot;Old Man Writing&quot; (Louvre), &quot;Woman&quot; (National Museum of Serbia), &quot;Girl Blowing Out Taper&quot; (Munich), &quot;Girl Reading Letter&quot; (Dresden Gallery), &quot;The Boy Angling&quot; (Berlin); and &quot;Toilet by Candle&quot; (The Hague). The Buckingham Palace collection also possesses an interior by Schalcken. His history paintings are less-well known. His pupils were Arnold Boonen, Godefridus Callenfels, Simon Germain, Carel de Moor, Richard Morris, Arent Pijl, his cousin Jacob Schalcken, his sister Maria Schalcken, and Anthony Vreem.

==In literature==

The atmospheric work of Schalcken provided the inspiration for Sheridan Le Fanu&#x27;s gothic horror story &quot;Strange Event in the Life of Schalken the Painter&quot;, which was adapted as &quot;Schalcken the Painter&quot;, and broadcast by the BBC on 23 December 1979 as part of its &quot;Omnibus&quot; series.

<text>Samuel Dirksz van Hoogstraten (2 August 1627, in Dordrecht – 19 October 1678, in Dordrecht) was a Dutch Golden Age painter, who was also a poet and author on art theory.

==Biography==
Samuel Dirksz van Hoogstraten trained first with his father Dirk van Hoogstraten and stayed in Dordrecht until about 1640. On the death of his father, he moved to Amsterdam where he entered the workshop of Rembrandt. A short time later, he started out on his own as a master and painter of portraits.

He later made several travels which took him (1651) to Vienna, Rome and London, finally retiring to Dordrecht. There he married in 1656, and held an appointment as provost of the mint.

==Paintings and etches==
A sufficient number of Van Hoogstraten&#x27;s works have been preserved to show that he strove to imitate different styles at different times. In a portrait dated 1645, currently in the Lichtenstein collection in Vienna, he imitates Rembrandt. He continued in this vein until as late as 1653 when he produced a figure of a bearded man looking out of a window. This, one of the more characteristic examples of his style, is exhibited in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna. He was also skilled at trompe-l&#x27;œil still lifes.

A view of the Vienna Hofburg, dated 1652, displays his skill as a painter of architecture. In contrast, a piece at the Hague representing a &quot;Lady Reading a Letter as she crosses a Courtyard&quot; (Mauritshuis) or a &quot;Lady Consulting a Doctor,&quot; (in the Rijksmuseum at Amsterdam), imitates de Hooch. One of his last remaining works is a portrait of Mathys van den Brouck, dated 1670.

Hoogstraten also employed his skill with perspective to construct &quot;peepshows&quot;, or &quot;perspective boxes&quot;. For example, &quot;A Peepshow with Views of the Interior of a Dutch House&quot; is a box with convincing 3D views of the interior of a Dutch house when viewed through peepholes on either end of the box. One of his perspective boxes is on show at the National Gallery in London. It shows the interior of a typical Dutch house of his time.

He produced many etchings as well, and some of his plates are still preserved. His self-portrait, engraved by himself at the age of fifty, still exists.

His pupils were his younger brother Jan van Hoogstraten, Aert de Gelder, Cornelis van der Meulen, and Godfried Schalcken.

==Literary work==
===Art theoretician===
Van Hoogstraten&#x27;s fame derives from his versatile career as a painter, poet and zealous social climber. Besides painting and directing a mint, he devoted some of his time to literary labours. His &quot;magnum opus&quot; is a book on painting, the &quot;Introduction to the Academy of Painting, or the Visible World&quot; (original title: &#x27;Inleyding tot de hooge schoole der schilderkonst: anders de zichtbaere werelt&#x27;, Rotterdam, 1678) which is in length and theoretical scope one of the most ambitious treatises on the art of painting published in the Dutch Republic in the seventeenth century. It covers issues such as pictorial persuasion and illusionism, the painter&#x27;s moral standards and the relation of painting to philosophy, referring to various ancient and modern authors. While reacting to international, mainly Southern European ideas on painting which Van Hoogstraten may have encountered during his travels, the treatise also reflects contemporary talk and thought on art from Dutch studios. He wrote it as a sequel to Karel van Mander&#x27;s early-17th-century book on painting and painters entitled &quot;Het Schilder-Boeck&quot;. One of van Hoogstraten&#x27;s many students, Arnold Houbraken, later wrote the book entitled &quot;The Great Theatre of Dutch Painters&quot;, which included a biography of his teacher. This biography is the basis of most of the information that we have about van Hoogstraten today.

===Sonnets and tragedies===
Van Hoogstraten also composed sonnets and tragedies. We are indebted to him for some of the familiar sayings of Rembrandt.

<doc id="1265819" wikidata="Q465692" url="?curid=1265819" title="American Megatrends">
<text>American Megatrends Inc., doing business as AMI, is an international hardware and software company, specializing in PC hardware and firmware. The company was founded in 1985 by Pat Sarma and Subramonian Shankar. It is headquartered in Building 800 at 3095 Satellite Boulevard in unincorporated Gwinnett County, Georgia, United States, near the city of Duluth, and in the Atlanta metropolitan area.

The company started as a manufacturer of complete motherboards, positioning itself in the high-end segment. Its first customer was PC&#x27;s, later known as Dell.

As hardware activity moved progressively to Taiwan-based ODMs, AMI continued to develop BIOS firmware for major motherboard manufacturers. The company produced BIOS software for motherboards (1986), server motherboards (1992), storage controllers (1995) and remote management cards (1998).
In 1993, AMI produced MegaRAID, a storage controller card. AMI sold its RAID assets to LSI in 2001, with only one employee from the RAID-division remaining with the AMI core team.

AMI continued to focus on OEM and ODM business and technology. Its product line includes or has previously included AMIBIOS (a BIOS), Aptio (a successor to AMIBIOS8 based on the UEFI standard), diagnostic software, AMI EC (embedded controller firmware), MG-Series SGPIO backplane controllers (for SATA, SAS and NVMe storage devices), driver/firmware development, and MegaRAC (BMC firmware).

==Founding==
American Megatrends Inc. (AMI) was founded in 1985 by Subramonian Shankar and Pat Sarma with funds from a previous consulting venture, Access Methods Inc. (AMI). Access Methods was a company run by Pat Sarma and his partner. After Access Methods successfully launched the AMIBIOS, there were legal issues among the owners of the company, resulting in Sarma buying out his partners. Access Methods still owned the rights to the AMIBIOS. Sarma had already started a company called Quintessential Consultants Inc. (QCI), and later set up an equal partnership with Shankar.

By this time the AMIBIOS had become established and there was a need to keep the initials AMI. The partners renamed QCI as American Megatrends, with the same initials as Access Methods; the renamed company then purchased AMIBIOS from Access Methods. Shankar became the president and Sarma the executive vice-president of this company. This partnership continued until 2001, when LSI Logic purchased the RAID Division of American Megatrends; American Megatrends then purchased all shares of the company owned by Sarma, making Shankar the majority owner.

==Products==

===AMIDiag===
AMIDiag is a family of PC diagnostic utilities sold to OEMs only. The AMIDiag suite was introduced in 1991 and made available for MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows and UEFI platforms. It includes both the Windows and DOS PC diagnostics programs. Later versions of AMIDiag support UEFI, which allows diagnostics to be performed directly on the hardware components, without having to use operating system drivers or facilities.

===Aptio===
AMI&#x27;s UEFI firmware solutions. Aptio V is AMI&#x27;s current main UEFI firmware product. Aptio Community Edition is an open source UEFI firmware product. Aptio 4 is a now-discontinued previous version that has been succeeded by Aptio V.

===MegaRAC===

MegaRAC is a product line of BMC firmware packages and formerly service processors providing out-of-band, or lights-out remote management of computer systems. These BMCs running MegaRAC firmware packages or service processors operate independently of the operating system status or location, to manage and troubleshoot computers.

== Former products ==

===AMIBIOS===

AMIBIOS is the IBM PC-compatible BIOS that was formerly developed and sold by American Megatrends since 1986. In 1994, the company claimed that 75% of PC clones used AMIBIOS. It is used on motherboards made by AMI and by other companies.

American Megatrends had a strict OEM business model for AMIBIOS: it sold source code to motherboard manufacturers or customized AMIBIOS for each OEM individually, whichever business model they require. AMI does not sell to end users, and itself produces no end-user documentation or technical support for its BIOS firmware, leaving that to licensees. However, the company published two books on its BIOS in 1993 and 1994, written by its engineers.

During powerup, the BIOS firmware displays an ID string in the lower-left-hand corner of the screen. This ID string comprises various pieces of information about the firmware, including when it was compiled, what configuration options were selected, the OEM license code, and the targeted chipset and motherboard. There are 3 ID string formats, the first for older AMIBIOS, and the second and third for the newer AMI Hi-Flex (&quot;high flexibility&quot;) BIOS. These latter are displayed when the Insert key is pressed during power-on self-test.

The original AMI BIOS did not encrypt the machine startup password, which it stored in non-volatile RAM. Therefore, any utility capable of reading a PC&#x27;s NVRAM was able to read and to alter the password. The AMI WinBIOS encrypts the stored password, using a simple substitution cipher.

By pressing the Delete key during power-on self-test when a prompt is displayed, the BIOS setup utility program is invoked. Some earlier AMIBIOS versions also included a cut-down version of the AMIDIAG utility that AMI also sold separately, but most later AMI BIOSes do not include this program as the BIOS DMI already incorporates detailed diagnostics.

AMIBIOS was formerly sold through distributors, not directly available from the manufacturer or from eSupport.

AMI supplies both DOS and Windows firmware upgrade utilities for its own motherboards. eSupport only supplies a Windows upgrade utility.

===StorTrends/ManageTrends===
The StorTrends family of network-based backup and storage management software and hardware includes several NAS and iSCSI-based SAN servers with 4, 12, or 16 drive bays.

AMI couples off-the-shelf hardware with the StorTrends iTX storage management firmware platform. StorTrends offers synchronous, asynchronous and snap-assisted replication, thin provisioning, high-availability grouping and advanced caching.

Reliability and performance is the key for any storage server. StorTrends iTX 2.8 is designed to support Storage Bridge Bay specification that provide Auto-Failover capability to ensure that any interruption is handled without affecting data. It supports High-availability cluster, redundancy, scalability, replication, disaster recovery and multiple site backups.

=== DuOS-M ===
&quot;DuOS-M&quot; was commercial software developed by American Megatrends for Intel x86-based computers using the Microsoft Windows operating system to provide a &quot;dual operating system&quot; environment in which the user can simultaneously deploy the Android operating system in tandem with Microsoft Windows.

Because DuOS-M has the capability to run both Windows and Android simultaneously, the user can switch between the two operating systems without having to dual boot or suspend operation of one operating system in order to utilize the other.

DuOS-M supports key hardware peripherals in Windows including cameras, audio, microphone and sensors such as ambient light sensor, accelerometer, gyrometer, compass and orientation sensors. It also supports various screen sizes, resolutions, and screen orientation (portrait and landscape) along with 3D acceleration and HD video playback.

The first version of DuOS-M was released in June 2014. The software is available for download for a free 30-day trial, and is available for purchase for a complete license.

On March 7, 2018, American Megatrends officially announced that it ceased development of DuOS-M. No further updates were being released at this time, including bug fixes and security patches.

==Technical problems==
On November 13, 1993, some PCs with AMIBIOS firmware began bootup playing the tune to &quot;Happy Birthday&quot;. The PC would remain halted, and the song would continue playing until a key was pressed, after which bootup would resume. The problem was caused by a virus-free Trojan, which was later resolved with firmware updates.

The AMI WinBIOS was a 1994 update to AMIBIOS, with a GUI setup screen that mimicked the appearance of Windows 3.1 and supported mouse navigation, unusual at the time. WinBIOS was viewed favorably by Anand Lal Shimpi at AnandTech, but described by Thomas Pabst at Tom&#x27;s Hardware as a &quot;big disappointment&quot;, in part because of problems with distributing IRQ signals to every PCI and ISA expansion slot.

In July 2008 Linux developers discovered issues with ACPI tables on certain AMIBIOS BIOSes supplied by Foxconn, ASUS, and MSI. The problem was related to the ACPI _OSI method, which is used by ACPI to determine the OS version (in case an ACPI patch only applies to one specific OS). In some cases, the OSI method caused problems on Linux systems, skipping code that was only executed on Windows systems. Foxconn and AMI worked together to develop a solution, which was included in later revisions of AMIBIOS. The issue affected motherboards with Intel Socket 775. Actual system behavior differed based on BIOS version, system hardware and Linux distribution.

In October 2021 an issue was discovered where some Baseboard Management Controllers were shipped with a license/royalty sticker that had the company name misspelled as &quot;American Megatrands&quot;.

<doc id="1265825" wikidata="Q4854274" url="?curid=1265825" title="Band of the Scots Guards">
<text>The Band of the Scots Guards is one of five bands in the Foot Guards Regiments in the Household Division which primarily guards the British monarch.

The band is based at Wellington Barracks in St James&#x27;s, London, which is the same place as for all the foot guards bands. The band should not be confused with the Pipes and Drums, which is a separate entity comprising fighting soldiers who are also pipers, rather than full-time professional musicians.

== History ==
The Scots Guards is a regiment that was formed by King Charles I in 1642. It is known that in 1716 a small band of &quot;hautbouys&quot; existed; however, the precise origins of the Band of the Scots Guards are unknown.

The band grew in strength during the early part of the 19th century and by 1838, it could boast some 32 performers. Throughout the 19th century the band expanded, until in 1888, there was an establishment of 44.

During the First World War it entertained troops at Ypres and the Somme in 1916. During the Second World War it was entertaining troops on the home front. This was sometimes through the medium of wireless, an example being 18 March 1942, when at 1 am, band members reported for a BBC Overseas Broadcast at the Paris Cinema. Musicians also found themselves on Fire Watch duties based at Egerton House, Buckingham Gate.

The Scots Guards was the only Foot Guards Band to be deployed on active service during the Gulf War in 1990 (with three of their colleagues from the Irish Guards Band). Many different aspects of hospital duties attached to the various departments of 33 General Hospital based in Al Jubail, Saudi Arabia were involved in their work there. In 1992, the Colonel of the Regiment, The Duke of Kent presented Gulf War Medals to Band members.

==Regimental Marches==
The Regimental Quick March is &quot;Hielan&#x27; Laddie&quot;. The Regimental Slow March is &quot;The Garb of Old Gaul&quot;.

== Ensembles ==
There are several ensembles within the Band of the Scots Guards:
* Concert band
* Marching band
* Dance band
* Fanfare Trumpeters
* Brass Quintet
* Wind Quintet
* String Quartet
* Orchestra
* Jazz Ensemble

== Functions ==

The Band of the Scots Guards plays for events of state as part of the Massed Bands of the Household Division. Some of the occasions that are most famous are listed below, although this is not a comprehensive list:

* Changing of the Guard
* The Festival of Remembrance
* Trooping the Colour
* Beating the Retreat
* Royal Ascot

The band also performs at other non-military events.

<doc id="1265830" wikidata="Q616062" url="?curid=1265830" title="Bainbridge-class destroyer">
<text>The &quot;Bainbridge&quot;-class destroyers were a class of United States Navy Torpedo Boat Destroyers (TBDs) built between 1899 and 1903. The first class so designated, they comprised the first 13 of 16 TBDs authorized by Congress in 1898 following the Spanish–American War (the remaining three authorised comprised the &quot;Truxtun&quot;-class destroyers). One ship of the class was lost at sea during service in World War I: , which collided with the British merchant ship SS &quot;Rose&quot; in 1917. The balance were decommissioned in 1919 and sold postwar in 1920, eleven to Joseph G. Hitner of Philadelphia, and the to the Denton Shore Lumber Company in Tampa, Florida.

==Subclasses==
Some sources subdivide the &quot;Bainbridge&quot; class into subsidiary classes based on their builders&#x27; differing designs.
* the first five vessels – &quot;Bainbridge&quot;, &quot;Barry&quot;, &quot;Chauncey&quot;, &quot;Dale&quot; and &quot;Decatur&quot; – shared a raised forecastle and had two widely-spaced pairs of funnels.
* &quot;Hopkins&quot; and had a turtledeck forward and may be considered to be &quot;Hopkins&quot; class. These had their two single torpedo tubes replaced by two twin torpedo tubes during World War I; total torpedoes remained at four.
* and had a turtledeck forward, Fore River boilers, carried their funnels in only one group of four, and may be considered to be &quot;Lawrence&quot; class. In 1906 two additional 6-pounder guns were substituted for the two 3-inch guns to save weight.
* , and carried one twin torpedo tube instead of two singles beginning in World War I and may be considered to be &quot;Paul Jones&quot; class.
* was equipped with Seabury boilers and was the fastest of the 400-tonners on trials at , but her trial displacement of is described as unrealistically light.

==Design==
===Origins===
Some references, including contemporary ones, describe four ocean-going torpedo boats launched in 1898-1899 as the first US destroyers based on their tonnage, which ranged from . These were , , , and . &quot;Stringham&quot;, the largest of these, was larger than some contemporary British destroyers. However, at the &quot;Bainbridge&quot;s were considerably larger and had a significantly greater gun armament than the four 6-pounders of the torpedo boats.

The &quot;Bainbridge&quot; class were produced on the recommendation of an 1898 war plans board formed to prosecute the Spanish–American War and chaired by Assistant Secretary of the Navy Theodore Roosevelt. The poor sea-keeping qualities of existing torpedo boats (such as the ) and the existence of Spanish torpedo boat destroyers (such as the ) were cited as reasons for the US to build its own destroyers. The 13 &quot;Bainbridges&quot; were officially designated as the Navy&#x27;s first TBDs when authorized by an Act of Congress on 4 May 1898 under the fiscal year 1899 program (with the remaining three being ).

Due to construction difficulties the &quot;Bainbridge&quot;s were completed 1901–02, thus too late for the Spanish–American War. However, the destroyer type was instituted in the US Navy, as it had been in the Royal Navy around 1895 with the A-class destroyers. No further torpedo boats were constructed for the US Navy until the outbreak of World War II in Europe, and by then they had no design relationship to destroyers (see PT boats). The Imperial German Navy of 1898–1918 used the term &quot;torpedo boat&quot; for anything up to a large destroyer in size.

===Armament===
At 420 long tons normal displacement, the &quot;Bainbridge&quot;s were twice as big as most previous torpedo boats. The extra displacement was used for a greatly increased gun armament and a sufficient engineering plant to rival the torpedo boats in speed ( vs. ). The torpedo armament remained at two torpedo tubes; although the torpedo boat&#x27;s mission was being transferred to the destroyer, apparently increased gun armament was more important to the designers than increased torpedo armament.

The gun armament of two /50 caliber guns and five 6-pounder () guns was a great increase over the four 6-pounder guns of the torpedo boat &quot;Farragut&quot;. It reflected a desire to quickly disable torpedo boats before they could get within range of friendly battleships. Future destroyer classes included progressive increases in armament.

The class was equipped with one or two depth charge racks during World War I for the anti-submarine mission.

===Engineering===
The best available technologies of coal-fired boilers and triple-expansion engines were used for propulsion, although steam turbines would be adopted in the next generation of US destroyers, beginning with the launched in 1908. The need for faster destroyers was to be a significant driver of naval propulsion technology throughout the type&#x27;s future development.

&quot;Bainbridge&quot; had four Thornycroft boilers supplying steam to two triple-expansion engines totaling (design). She made on trials at . Normal coal capacity was .

&quot;Hopkins&quot; also had four Thornycroft boilers supplying steam to two triple-expansion engines totaling 7,000 ihp (design). She made on trials at . Normal coal capacity was lower though, at .

&quot;Lawrence&quot; had four Normand boilers supplying steam to two triple-expansion engines totaling (design). She made on trials 8,400 ihp. Normal coal capacity was even lower, at only .

An interesting note on destroyers is that they have continuously increased in size since their inception. The &quot;Bainbridge&quot;s were under full load; some s in service in 2013 displace full load, more than the standard displacement limit on 1920s &quot;Treaty cruisers&quot;.

==Service==
A few &quot;Bainbridge&quot;s were deployed to the Philippines 1904-1917. During the US participation in World War I, these were redeployed to the Mediterranean as convoy escorts. Others of the class served in the Atlantic, on the US East Coast, or guarded the Panama Canal. &quot;Chauncey&quot; collided with the British merchant ship SS &quot;Rose&quot; in 1917 and was lost. Following the Armistice, the remainder were sold for scrapping or merchant conversion in 1920.

==Ships in class==
Note that, although the ships are listed below with the prefix &quot;DD-&quot; before their official numbers, this classification was not created until 1911, and until then these vessels were officially categorised as &quot;Destroyer No. 1&quot; to &quot;Destroyer No. 13&quot;.

<text>Hajji (; sometimes spelled Hajjeh, Hadji, Haji, Alhaji, Al-Hadj, Al-Haj or El-Hajj) is an honorific title which is given to a Muslim person who has successfully completed the Hajj to Mecca.

==Etymology==
&quot;Hajji&quot; is derived from the Arabic &#x27; (), which is the active participle of the verb &#x27; (&#x27;to make the pilgrimage&#x27;; ). The alternative form &quot;&quot; is derived from the name of the Hajj with the adjectival suffix -&quot;ī&quot; (), and this was the form adopted by non-Arabic languages.

==Use==
&quot;Hajji&quot; and its variant spellings are used as honorific titles for Muslims who have successfully completed the Hajj to Mecca.

In Arab countries, &#x27; and &#x27; (pronunciation varies by Arabic dialect) is a commonly used manner of addressing any older person respectfully if they have performed the pilgrimage. It is often used to refer to an elder, since it can take years to accumulate the wealth to fund the travel (particularly before commercial air travel), and in many Muslim societies to a respected man as an honorific title. The title is prefixed to a person&#x27;s name; for example, Saif Gani becomes &quot;&quot;Hajji&quot; Saif Gani&quot;.

In Malay-speaking countries, and are titles given to Muslim males and females respectively who have performed the pilgrimage. These are abbreviated as &quot;Hj.&quot; and &quot;Hjh.&quot; (in Indonesian, it is &quot;H.&quot; and &quot;Hj&quot;.) 

In Iran, the honorific title &quot;Hāj&quot; () is sometimes used for IRGC commanders, instead of the title &quot;Sardar&quot; (&#x27;General&#x27;), such as for Qasem Soleimani.

===Other religions===
The term was borrowed in Balkan Christian countries formerly under Ottoman rule (Bulgaria, Serbia, Greece, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Romania), and are used for Christians who have travelled to Jerusalem and the Holy Lands. In some areas the title has been fossilised as a family name, for example in the surnames common among Bosniaks such as Hadžić, Hadžiosmanović (&#x27;son of Hajji Osman&#x27;) etc.

In Cyprus, the title is so prevalent that it has also been permanently integrated into some Greek Christian surnames, such as . This is due to Cyprus&#x27;s long history of Christian and Muslim influence.

The title has also been used in some Jewish communities to honor those who made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem or other holy sites in Israel.

==Ethnic slur==
In the 21st century, American soldiers began using the term &quot;Haji&quot; as slang for Iraqis, Afghans, or Arab people in general. It is used in the way &quot;gook&quot; or &quot;Charlie&quot; was used by U.S military personnel during the Vietnam War.

==Background==

The Sacred Mosque and the Pilgrimage (&quot;Ḥajj&quot;) were originally dedicated to God, but fell to idolatry in contemporary times, while worshippers of God had been suspended from visiting it. In this manner, consent for taking up arms against those despots has been given to remove them from that point and to set up the upright lifestyle for setting up prudence and eradicating evil. As indicated by Ibn Abbas, Mujahid, Urwah ibn Zubayr, Zayd ibn Aslam, Muqatil ibn Hayyan, Qatadah and other commentators, verse 39 is the first that gives the Muslims authorization to take up arms. Various hadiths and books on the life of Muhammad affirm that after this consent, real arrangements for war were begun and the very first expedition was sent to the shore of the Red Sea in Safar , known as the Patrol of Waddan.

==Topic and theme==
This surah addresses: (1) The mushriks of Makkah, (2) the faltering Muslims, and (3) the genuine devotees. The mushriks have been cautioned in a mighty way with this impact: &quot;You have adamantly and impudently persevered in your thoughts of ignorance and confided in your false-deities rather than Allah, however, they have no force at all and you have denied the Divine Messenger. Resultantly you will meet a similar end as has been the doom of those like you previously. You have just hurt yourselves by dismissing Our Prophet and by aggrieving the best of your own people; your false-deities will not have the option to spare you from the rage of God&quot;. Simultaneously, they have been advised consistently for their doctrine of shirk and sound contentions have been given for Tauhid and the Hereafter.

The faltering Muslims, who entered Islam, yet did not want to face any difficulty in its path, have been advised with this impact: &quot;What is this faith of yours? From one viewpoint, you are prepared to have faith in Allah and become His workers given you are harmony and thriving, and if you meet with torments and hardships in His path, you dispose of your Allah and stop to remain His servant. You should remember that this faltering disposition of yours can&#x27;t deflect those incidents and misfortunes which Allah has appointed for you.&quot;

As respects the genuine devotees, they have been tended to in two different ways: (1) in a general route to incorporate the average folks of Arabia additionally, and (2) in an exclusive way:

# The Adherents have been informed that the mushriks of Makkah reserved no option to suspend them from visiting the Holy Mosque. They reserved no privilege to keep anybody from performing Hajj because the Holy Mosque was not their personal property. This complaint was advocated as well as went about as a powerful political weapon against the Quraish. For it suggested this conversation starter to different clans of Arabia: Were the Quraish insignificant orderlies of the Blessed Mosque or its proprietors? It suggested that if they prevailing with regards to suspending the Muslims from Hajj with no dissent from others, they would feel urged in the future to suspend from Hajj and Umrah the individuals of whatever other clan or faction, who had stressed relations with the Quraish. To underscore this point, the historical backdrop of the construction of the Sacred Mosque has been referred to show that it was worked by Prophet Abraham by the Order of Allah and he had welcomed all the people groups to perform Hajj there. That is the reason those originating from outside had delighted in equivalent rights by the neighborhood individuals from the earliest starting point. It has likewise been clarified that that House had not been worked for the ceremonies of shirk but for the love of One Allah. Hence it was sheer oppression that the worship of Allah was being prohibited there while the worship of idols appreciated full permit. 
# To tackle the oppression of the Quraish, the Muslims were permitted to battle with them. They were likewise provided with instruction to adopt the right and just behavior as and when they procured capacity to lead in the land. Additionally, the Adherents have been formally given the name of &quot;Muslims&quot;, saying, &quot;You are the genuine heirs of Abraham and you have been chosen to become witnesses of Truth before humankind. In this way, you ought to establish salat and pay the zakat obligations to turn into the best models of equitable life and perform Jihad for spreading the word of Allah.&quot;

==Principal subject==
The significant issues, divine laws, and guidance direction in the text of the discourse can be categorized as follows:
# A scene from the Hour of Fate. 
# Human life cycle: life right now and then in the Hereafter. 
# The conduct of those people who were remaining at the border of faith is recognized. 
# The way that Allah consistently helps His Rasools. 
# Divine law conceding equivalent rights to all believers in Masjid-al-Haram, regardless of whether they are locals or outsiders. 
# The way that Allah Himself distinguished the site and asked Prophet Ibrahim to manufacture the Kaaba and call humanity to perform Hajj. 
# Somebody who commits Shirk resembles the one who tumbles from the sky and his body is grabbed away by the birds. 
# It isn&#x27;t the blood or the tissue of a sacrificed animal that arrives Allah yet the devotion of the person who is offering the sacrifice. 
# The 1st Instruction of Allah allowing consent to the devotees to shield themselves and battle against the disbelievers and mushrikin. 
# Upon the arrival of Judgment, Allah Himself will be the Adjudicator for all. 
# Allah&#x27;s guarantee to the individuals who relocate for the sake of Allah that He will compensate them generously. 
# Allah called the devotees Muslims in the earlier sacred writings and in the Qur&#x27;an as well.

<text>Shannon is a small town in the Horowhenua District of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. it is located 28 kilometres southwest of Palmerston North and 15 kilometres northeast of Levin.

The main activities in the district are dairy, sheep, and mixed farming. Mangaore (5 kilometres east) is the residential township for the nearby Mangahao hydro-electric power station, which was the second power station to be built in New Zealand and the first to be built by the government. The power station is the oldest still supplying power to New Zealand grid. The Manawatū River lies to the west of the town.

A large percentage of the population is Māori with the local primary school representing kaupapa Māori.

==History==

Shannon originally adjoined extensive swamps and was a headquarters for flax milling. The land on which the township later stood was part of an endowment of acquired about 1881 by the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company (WMR). At first the company had intended to extend its railway from Levin to Foxton, but afterwards it proceeded to develop and open up the endowment area. Accordingly, the line was laid along the present route via Shannon. The town is considered to have been founded on 8 March 1887 when the first auction of town land was held. Shannon was named after George Vance Shannon (1842–1920), a director of the WMR. It was constituted a borough in 1917.

===Mangahao Power Station tragedy===

On 2 July 1922 seven workers were poisoned by carbon monoxide while digging the tunnels for the Mangahao Power Station.

When the extractor fan broke down, Bernard Butler and foreman Alfred Maxwell were killed by suffocation from the fumes being emitted by their oil engines. A subsequent search party of five of their colleagues also suffocated and perished in the tunnel.

<text>Thomas James Hunter, CM, O.Ont (born March 20, 1937) is a Canadian country music performer, known as &quot;Canada&#x27;s Country Gentleman&quot;.

==Career==
In 1956, he began performing as a rhythm guitarist on the CBC Television show, &quot;Country Hoedown&quot;. &quot;The Tommy Hunter Show&quot; began as a CBC Radio program in 1960, replacing the long-running variety show &quot;The Happy Gang&quot;, and went on to replace &quot;Country Hoedown&quot; on CBC Television in 1965; Hunter&#x27;s show was picked up by TNN in 1983 and ran on CBC until 1992. Performers on the show included singer-songwriter Gordon Lightfoot in the early years of his own musical career. 

The book &quot;Cue the Elephant&quot; by Knowlton Nash (1996, McClelland &amp; Stewart) featured some disparaging remarks from the show&#x27;s make-up artist. &quot;He could sell himself terrifically but there was no love lost between Tommy and the crew. Some of the guys loathed him ... Everybody made snide remarks behind Tommy&#x27;s back ... people might say he was the biggest jerk in the world. But that was not my experience. For me, I saw a very easy down-to-earth manner. But Tommy does generate anti as well as pro feelings from people ... he didn&#x27;t trust people around him, he became a monster to some.&quot;

People who performed on &quot;The Tommy Hunter Show&quot; early in their careers include:
*Garth Brooks
*Shania Twain, then known as Eileen Twain
*The Judds
*Yvonne Murray

After his show was cancelled by the CBC, Hunter continued to tour with his band, &quot;The Travelling Men&quot;. He retired after his final tour in 2012.

==Awards and recognition==
Hunter was inducted into the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame in 1984. In 1986, Hunter was made a Member of the Order of Canada. He has received three Canadian Juno Awards and one Gemini Award. In 1990, he was given a place in the Country Music Hall of Fame&#x27;s &quot;Walkway of Stars&quot;. A street (&quot;Tommy Hunter Way&quot;) was also renamed in his honour in his hometown of London, Ontario, in the late 1990s. He became a member of the Order of Ontario in 1996. In 2005 he was honored with a GMA Canada Lifetime Achievement Award. The award is handed out annually by the Gospel Music Association of Canada.

<doc id="1265850" wikidata="Q34140" url="?curid=1265850" title="Surigaonon language">
<text>Surigaonon is an Austronesian language spoken by Surigaonon people. As a regional Philippine language, it is spoken in the province of Surigao del Norte, Dinagat Islands, Surigao del Sur, and some portions of Agusan del Norte, especially the towns near Lake Mainit, Agusan del Sur and Davao Oriental. The language, along with Butuanon and Tausug, are the only Visayan languages geographically native to Mindanao.

==External relationships==
Surigaonon refers to the people and the language of the people of Surigao del Sur and del Norte. It is composed of ethnic languages of Surigao the mix version of Surigao&#x27;s ethnic language and Cebuano. It has been heavily influenced by Cebuano due to the influx of many Cebuanos in the region. However, most Cebuano speakers can hardly understand Surigaonon speakers, except for Cebuanos who have been living in the region for years.

Surigaonon is very closely related to the Tausug language of Sulu and the Butuanon language of Butuan.

==Varieties==
===Tandaganon===
Tandaganon (also called Tinandag, Naturalis, Tagon-on) is a closely related variety spoken in Tandag and central Surigao del Sur municipalities of San Miguel, Tago, Bayabas, Cagwait, Marihatag, San Agustin, and most of Lianga. It can be classified as a separate language or alternatively as a southern variety of Surigaonon. There are about 100,000 speakers.

===Surigaonon===

Surigaonon (also called Jaun-Jaun, Waya-Waya) itself on the other hand is the northern (Surigao del Norte) variety, with about 400,000 speakers. Surigaonon speakers are distributed throughout Surigao del Norte, northern Surigao del Sur, and northern Agusan del Norte. Surigaonon and Tandaganon speakers can understand each other well, even if they use their own languages in conversation (similar to the mutual intelligibility between the Boholano dialect and the general Cebuano dialect).

Together, Surigaonon and Tandaganon are spoken in Surigao del Norte and most parts of Surigao del Sur, except in the City of Bislig, municipalities of Barobo, Hinatuan, Lingig, and Tagbina. In the non-Surigaonon-speaking areas of Surigao, most of the inhabitants are descended from Cebuano-speaking migrants, and the rest are natives who speak Kamayo, a Mansakan language.

==Phonology==
According to Dumanig (2015), Surigaonon has a similar phonological inventory as its sister Bisayan languages, Cebuano and Boholano.

===Vowels===
Below is the vowel system of Surigaonon.

===Consonants===
Below is a chart of Surigaonon consonants.

Note: is spelled &quot;y&quot;, is spelled &quot;j&quot; and is spelled &quot;ng&quot;.

<text>Karl Friedrich Wilhelm Großmann (13 December 1863 – 5 July 1922), better known as Carl Großmann, was a German serial killer and rapist who murdered at least twenty women in the Friedrichshain quarter of Berlin between 1918 and 1921. He killed himself while awaiting the end of his trial without giving a full confession.

==Early life==

=== Childhood ===
Großmann was born in Alt Ruppin (now part of Neuruppin) as one of seven children to rag picker Karl G. Friedrich Großmann and Marie Dorothea Sophie &quot;Sophia&quot; Prößel (or Brüssel). Of his two brothers and four sisters, Großmann was closest to his half-brother Franz, who corroborated most of Großmann&#x27;s own testimony about his childhood. His father was an alcoholic and locally regarded as an ill-tempered brute, who was often arrested for starting fights with other townsfolk, also regularly beating his wife and children in drunken rages using a fire poker. Großmann was often singled out in the abuse, as his father &quot;hated how alike they were&quot;, and forced his son under threat of death to lie to teachers about the bruises, claiming that they were the result of accidents while playing.

Großmann was widely disliked and mocked for his ugly appearance and body odor. His brother Franz said that Großmann began voicing violent thoughts and sadistic sexual tastes since his youth. Early on, Großmann developed a fascination with the slaughter of animals, delighting in the flow of blood and final death throes. In one instance, when Großmann was six years old, he and his half-brother assisted in the slaughter of a pig at the local abattoir. The brothers were supposed to catch any run-off blood in a bowl, but when the butcher cut the pig&#x27;s jugular vein, Großmann pushed his brother aside, opened his mouth, and gulped up as much blood as he could from the gushing stream. Franz Großmann described how his brother was &quot;seizing as if he were having an epileptic fit&quot; before an adult worker shoved the boy away. Großmann reportedly told his brother later in life that he could only achieve arousal at the sight of blood. Childhood friend Fritz Schirrmeister recalled a time when he slaughtered an injured rabbit for food while Großmann watched, noticing his friend&#x27;s oddly pleased facial expression and fixed gaze on the animal&#x27;s twitching.

From an early age, Großmann assisted his father&#x27;s merchant business as a crier and tended to the family&#x27;s goats kept in nearby Treskow. Neighbours often observed the young boy playfully smashing heads with one particular billy goat and covering his face and chest in salt to have the goats lick him, leading to Großmann being nicknamed &quot;Zickenkarl&quot; (&quot;Nanny Goat Karl&quot;) for his overt fondness for the animals.

Großmann left &quot;Volksschule&quot; in the third grade, shortly after which he had his Evangelical confirmation. Großmann claimed to have continued school for a few years while working at a local fabric factory, but did not possess higher education.

=== Adolescence ===
In 1876, he took an apprenticeship as a slaughterhouse worker at the meat shop of Ferdinand Kliefoth, who took the troublemaking youth in despite his unpopular reputation, having seen his potential as a slaughterer given his deftness with a knife and lack of aversion to blood. Großmann told his brother that he only took the position to get close to Klieforth&#x27;s wife Dorothea and that he often had wet dreams about forcing himself on her. In 1879, Großmann was dismissed after he was caught attempting to rape Dorothea and beaten by Klieforth as a result. According to Großmann, he never finished a proper course as either a slaughterer or butcher. He returned to selling cloth with his father, occasionally working as a laborer at the fabric factory. Großmann was thrown out of the house in 1880 for stealing money from his father. Großmann claimed that he moved to Berlin with friends at 16.

== Crimes ==

=== Vagrancy and sex offenses ===
Berlin court records showed that his earliest available conviction was in 1882 at age 19 for vagrancy, with the court in Rixdorf noting that he already had an extensive history for begging and unemployment. In the following four years, he was convicted for theft, attempted blackmail, threat, and property damage. He was jailed thrice for assault in the years 1886, 1887, and 1888. Between 1886 and 1887, Großmann served in the Imperial German Army, in the 12th Grenadier Regiment in Frankfurt an der Oder (most likely referring to ), until he was discharged for a criminal arrest for rape, spending one year in prison. In 1889, Großmann received another one-year sentence by for aggravated assault. Upon his release in 1890, Großmann worked for numerous butcher shops and slaughterhouses in Berlin-Mitte, subsidizing his income as a peddler of matches and other households items. In relation to his unsolicited sales, he was jailed twice for begging, once for fraud and once for trespassing, totalling jail time of six months and two weeks by 1893.

Großmann left Berlin in 1894 after failing to find steady employment and became a vagrant traversing southern Germany during the late 1890s, making a living through begging, peddling, and theft. Over the years, Großmann was sentenced at the courts of Heidelberg, Dresden, Aachen, Ludwigsburg, and Mannheim. In the Neckar area of Baden and Württemberg, his arrests were primarily for vagrancy, trespassing, and fraud. One-off convictions included physical insult, resisting arrest, and bestiality. On 3 January 1896, a gardener couple had alerted police after hearing their nanny goat screaming, with officers finding Großmann inside the stable, at the hooves of the animal and hiding under an Inverness coat. He first claimed to have only trespassed for nightly shelter, but an examination of the goat showed that it had severe swelling around the genitalia while Großmann was &quot;wet around the knees&quot; and had the fly of his pants open. He was subsequently sentenced to 10 months imprisonment for sodomy by a court in Mannheim.

In the Franconian region of Bavaria, his criminal record included assault, petty burglary, and sex crimes against young girls. His first charge was for the rape of a four-year-old girl. The longest of these first sentences, 15 months imprisonment, was served in Nuremberg, after Großmann was convicted in 1897 for molesting a twelve-year-old girl. After being released on 1 April 1899, Großmann molested a ten-year-old girl and raped a four-year-old girl. A court in Bayreuth sentenced him to 15 years imprisonment for the rapes on 4 October 1899; the four-year-old died of an infection from a complete tearing of the perineum inflicted during the attack shortly after the judgement. During his sentence at Ebrach prison, Großmann continued his violent behaviour and got into unprovoked fights with fellow inmates, leading to 55 citations.

=== Murders ===
After his release from prison in August 1914, Großmann again moved to Berlin. Despite the start of World War I just a few days earlier, he was not drafted due to his age. Initially financing himself with peddling, Großmann rented out the kitchen habitation in the third-floor apartment of Mannheim Itzig at Lange Straße 88, in the area around Berlin Ostbahnhof, known at the time for its high rates of crime, unemployment, and prostitution. Although Großmann was a one-room lodger, he often had the apartment to himself as Itzig and his family were rarely home. Neighbors described Großmann as a quiet man, only remembered for his particularly repulsive looks and stench. Residents admitted to often hearing loud noises and screaming from his flat, but did not think more of it, believing Großmann was only having rough sex with prostitutes, which was not uncommon in the quarter. Großmann sold meat on the black market and managed a sausage stand at Andreas Square outside the train station. According to admissions made to the court after his arrest, Großmann kept constant savings of around 10,000 mark from his income as a peddler.

Beginning at least 1918, Großmann used his location near Ostbahnhof to approach women, often job-seekers from the countryside newly arrived by train, and lure a victim to his home by offering them work as a domestic housekeeper. Some surviving victims said that they interpreted this as a code for solicitation while others genuinely believed they would be given employment. At the apartment, Großmann would physically overpower the woman and rape her, though other times, he would let the victim do housekeeping for several days or weeks before drugging and sexually assaulting her. Some of the women were let go after agreeing to not report Großmann while others were killed at Großmann&#x27;s discretion. He would dump his victims&#x27; remains in Luisenstadt Canal and the adjoining Engelbecken basin. After any encounter, Großmann reported the women, whether dead or alive, to police, claiming they had run away after stealing from him to either explain their disappearance or disparage potential accusations made by surviving victims. On occasion, Großmann also targeted local women, ranging from female labourers, stay-at-home mothers, and sex workers, all invariably from poor financial backgrounds. Großmann&#x27;s activities went mostly unnoticed due to the political climate of the time, due to which Berlin Police was largely occupied with quelling armed protests.

Großmann had been occasionally reported to the authorities, but a criminal investigation was never launched until his arrest. On 24 March 1920, 66-year-old downstairs neighbour Gertrud Grabowski called a social worker when she heard crying from upstairs. Grabowski said that she initially believed that Großmann had once more invited a prostitute, but soon recognised the voice as belonging to a child. The social worker found a 15-year-old girl in Großmann&#x27;s flat and ordered police to the scene. The girl said that Großmann had invited her into his room and digitally penetrated her as she slept while Großmann claimed that he had tried to undress her for a bath. The matter was not pursued further since the girl was a homeless runaway and did not press charges. The social worker demanded a house search after she realised that there was women&#x27;s clothing in Großmann&#x27;s possession and that Großmann had lied when claiming that they belonged to a deceased wife, but was ignored by the officers.

On 21 October 1920, police searched Großmann&#x27;s apartment after one of his surviving victims, Martha Baltzer, went to police and accused Großmann of murdering a friend of hers, 33-year-old sex worker Frieda Schubert, who disappeared on 2 October. Baltzer&#x27;s testimony was supported by Schubert&#x27;s fiancé Otto Tannenbaum, who also recalled last seeing her with Großmann. Two women were found in company of Großmann, but police concluded that nothing pointed towards Großmann having any involvement in Schubert&#x27;s disappearance.

In summer 1921, Großmann picked up a homeless woman named Martha, had lunch with her and invited her to stay with him for the night. In the flat, Großmann told the woman he would pay her if she allowed him to tie her up, claiming that he had a bondage fetish and would masturbate at the sight. He instead tried to rape her by throwing her on the bed, but the woman dodged and ran for the door. Großmann incapacitated the woman hitting her in the face with a pestle and dragging her back into the bed, then gagged her with a towel. While Großmann watched her suffocate to death, Helene Itzig, the wife of his landlord, arrived unannounced. Entering his room, Itzig first believed she had only caught Großmann sleeping with a sex worker, but was horrified when she pulled away the blanket and found that the woman was motionless and had a broken bleeding nose. She ran out of the apartment, but returned without alerting police. Großmann lied by explaining that he drugged the woman and was simply &quot;getting more time with her&quot; this way. Negative and hostile attitudes against sex workers were widespread at the time, so Itzig did not question this further and left after being paid off with 50 DM, supposedly to keep quiet about his solicitation habits. Großmann fell asleep next to the body and dismembered her two hours later when he woke up.

In mid-August 1921, Großmann was booked on assault charges for getting into a fight with a man who had confronted Großmann over the disappearance of his sister, 29-year-old Johanna Sosnowski, on 14 August. Großmann was not tried and the allegation not further investigated.

Two other victims who reported Großmann for rape, Emma B. and Frieda T., were disregarded by police because of Großmann&#x27;s theft accusations and because they were known prostitutes. Another woman, known only as &quot;Polish Anna&quot;, was arrested and jailed until well after Großmann&#x27;s arrest, after she was found with four 100 mark notes, which had been marked by Großmann, hidden in her stocking.

Since May 1921, the body parts of women appeared in the Spree going though Berlin, primarily the Luisenstedt Canal sometimes on a daily basis. Only two, the missing Frieda Schubert and Johanna Sosnowski, could be certainly identified. Some of the remains were estimated to have been in the water for 8 to 14 days. The body parts belonged to at least 23 women, but the sheer amount led some investigators to suspect that Großmann murdered up to 100 women and girls. Dismembered human remains had washed up since March 1920, but estimation is skewed due to the presence of the corpses of Reichswehr officers thrown into the Spree during the Kapp Putsch, due to which body parts were not further examined. A 5000 mark reward was issued for help in identifying the suspected murderer of the unknown women. Police asked through newspaper columns for residents to come forwards and identify the bodies. In August 1921, at least twelve people answered the request, leading to three possible, but unconfirmed identifications as Else Thiese, Margarete Simon, and Wilhelmine Poppel, as well as one accusation against a certain Ernst Brandt, which was also not investigated. It was rumored and widely reported by contemporary newspapers that the meat Großmann sold contained the remains of his victims, as he threw some of their bones and other inedible parts into the river. Police at the time and later assessment by historians have dismissed the cannibal rumours, popularly called &quot;Braut auf der Stulle&quot; (&quot;[a] broad on sliced bread&quot;), as unfounded and likely an invention by tabloid newspapers to boost sales.

==Arrest==
On 21 August 1921, a neighbour of Großmann, labourer Robert Iglitzki, was awoken by his wife, who had heard screams and banging noises from above, followed by silence at around 21:30. At her insistence, Iglitzki went to the 50th precinct Andreaswache and led two police officers, Karl Klähn and Ernst Engesser, to Großmann&#x27;s apartment. Großmann refused to open the door despite repeated knocking by officers, who then burst into the apartment. Arresting officer Klähn saw Großmann with visibly bloodied hands about to commit suicide by drinking muckefuck laced with cyanide, but was prevented when Klähn knocked the cup out of his hand. Immediately after Großmann was handcuffed by Engesser, Klähn found the body of a nude female on the bed. The woman was still alive, but died seconds after the discovery. She was identified as 34-year-old Marie Nitsche (née Paul), an occasional sex worker from Dresden who had been released from Moabit jail the same day. Witnesses confirmed that Nitsche had been picked up by Großmann at Koppenstraße and that the pair spent the evening at a nearby carnival, using rides and drinking beer, until around 21:00.

News of the police&#x27;s findings spread quickly, leading to hundreds of residents gathering outside the building within the next hour. When Großmann was walked to the precinct on foot at around midnight, police had to keep dozens of armed civilians from reaching the arrestee. He was handed over to the homicide department at the main police station at Alexanderplatz and charged with murder. Newspapers immediately reported that Großmann was linked to six murders, later lowered to five, and named at least seven missing women as potentially tied to the case.

=== Investigation ===
The majority of victims died by asphyxiation or blunt trauma while bound to a bed. In the former case, Großmann usually shoved a hand into their mouths and watched their deaths for several minutes. Neighbours reported that he seemed to have had a steady supply of female companions, mostly destitute-looking young women, over the previous few years. Residents estimated that they had seen around 150 different women with Großmann over the years after presumably taking him up on the supposed housekeeping position. How many lives Großmann took is not known and Großmann only gave first names when reporting his housekeepers to police. Since Großmann came in frequently and his theft accusations were low priority, the amount of times he filed complaints, as well as the names themselves, were often not recorded. Only the body of his final victim was found, along with bloodstains in the apartment that indicated at least two other persons had been butchered in the few weeks leading up to his arrest.

Investigators estimated that around 50 women and teenage girls entered Großmann&#x27;s apartment and survived. The first surviving victim to identify herself, Gertrud Haag, appeared on her own on 22 August, saying she had been drugged with tranquilisers and raped during her stay. The ones who were identified were most often raped, but some stated that they either performed regular housekeeping or engaged in consensual intercourse in return for money and habitation. Many described that Großmann had given them food, coffee, money, or paid for other expenses upon their first meeting. This was observed by long-time sex workers in the borough, who had given him the nickname &quot;Mysterious Karl&quot;, as they did not know Großmann&#x27;s intentions, avoiding him as a client and telling newcomers to decline his alms. The survivors of the rapes described being tied to the bed and tortured by Großmann, consistent with the wounds found on several of the dismembered bodies. The earliest identified survivor was Marie Felz, who met Großmann on 1 January 1918. She was 25 years old and an unemployed feedlot worker at the time, stating that she was not assaulted by Großmann, instead leaving without issue after drinking beer with him and being given a new pair of shoes.

According to true crime writer Colin Wilson, a victim killed on 13 August 1920 was rumoured to be Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia, amidst since-discredited rumours of Anastasia&#x27;s survival of the 1918 executions of the Romanov family. Wilson wrote that a family in Bütow later claimed that the victim was actually their daughter, who had left her home in Pomerania to masquerade as one of several Anastasia impostors. Wilson named her as &quot;Franziska Schamzkovski&quot;, referring to well-known Anastasia impostor Anna Anderson, whose original name was Franziska Schanzkowski, from Borrowilaß, also in Pomerania; Anderson was in a Berlin mental asylum at the time of the killings and died of natural causes in 1984.

=== Jail stay and confessions ===
Großmann was connected to three murders and suspected of a fourth, tentatively identified as 19-year-old sex worker Emma Baumann from Mecklenburg, based on descriptions from her family provided to local media, although not ascertained by police. During his arrest and two weeks into custody, he would firmly contest that he had killed Nitsche because she had stolen from him, and attempted to convince officers to downgrade his murder charge to manslaughter. It was found that Nitsche, an unemployed cook, did have a couple 100 mark bills on her person, but it is unknown whether they were hers or Großmann&#x27;s, nor if she really stole them or if they were planted on Nitsche. Großmann stopped his daily pleas when police collected and interviewed a number of surviving women, who described the interior of Großmann&#x27;s home.

Großmann eventually conceded after detective Ludwig Werneburg offered to give him access to Hänschen, the pet siskin that he kept in the apartment, and was further able to gain Großmann&#x27;s trust by allowing him unhandcuffed private time with the bird. After Werneburg ingratiated himself to Großmann for treating Hänschen for mites, Großmann admitted to killing three women, Marie Nitsche, Elisabeth Barthel, and Johanna Sosnowski. When asked if they had stolen from him, Großmann responded in the negative and said that &quot;in the end, it was all just because I can&#x27;t control myself around a girl&quot;. In the following six hours, Großmann described how he had lured, raped, killed, dismembered and dumped two of the victims. When asked if he had killed anyone else, Großmann denied and refused to speak further about his crimes, saying they were even for Hänschen&#x27;s treatment.

The following day, Großmann asked for an attorney, specifically requesting defense counsel , who had become known for his unwavering, if ultimately unsuccessful legal defense of serial killer Friedrich Schumann. Upon their first meeting under police supervision in September, the first thing Großmann asked Frey to take possession of his bird. That same day, Großmann confessed to the murder of Frieda Schubert, after investigators confronted him with Schubert&#x27;s purse found on his property and on 15 September, he told police of the murder committed in summer 1921, as well as the murder of Albertine Asche during the same timeframe. However, Großmann returned to his initial explanation that he killed the women accidentally in angry outbursts, though even then his reasoning included weak justifications such as refusal to sleep with him or failure to disclose a steady partner. On 24 September, he was officially charged by Charlottenburg court with the murders of Nitsche, Sosnowski, and Asche; the murder of &quot;Martha&quot; was not pursued since she could not be fully identified During the hearing, Großmann now insisted to prosecutor Siegfried Lindow that he should be ruled criminally insane to avoid the death penalty and later wrote a complaint that the victims had consented to sex, were never choked by him, that deaths were accidentally while he was &quot;caressing their tongues&quot; and that testimony of survivors was &quot;partly heavily exaggerated or wholly untrue&quot;.

During his time in jail, Großmann attacked and attempted to strangle a guard, for which he was chained during meetings with his lawyer. By June 1922, Großmann had reportedly begun writing an autobiography in which he claimed that he killed his victims because they were &quot;surplus women&quot;, whom he described as &quot;economic and social pests&quot;. English-language media referred to Großmann as a Bluebeard and dubbed him a &quot;German Jack the Ripper&quot; or &quot;German Landru&quot;, despite also acknowledging that none of the murderers shared much similarity in &quot;modus operandi&quot; besides killing women. The same newspapers misrepresented the victims as being exclusively prostitutes who were lured by the promise of money or legitimate work.

A medical assessment by Robert Störmer, who also personally met with the arestee, examined Großmann&#x27;s familial history, including that of his father&#x27;s previous wives, their husbands, and their children, and prior criminal arrests. His younger brother, Wilhelm Großmann, was treated at two Weißensee asylums for &quot;cerebral softening&quot; before dying at Martin Gropius Krankenhaus in 1911 at age 39, but this was believed to have stemmed from a severe head injury during work and an untreated syphilis infection. One of Wilhelm&#x27;s four children was judged to be &quot;feeble-minded&quot;. A half-brother, August Schulz, who was a Gefreiter in the Prussian Army, had been imprisoned for 15 years for the rape of a domestic servant and after being released, Schulz raped a child, dying around 1907 during his second 15-year sentence. A niece and nephew of Großmann, related through a maternal half-sister, were described as suffering from &quot;screaming fits while sleeping&quot; and &quot;recurrent fits of rage&quot;, but otherwise sane. Though both of Großmann&#x27;s parents were deceased by 1911, no greater history of mental illness could be found in his extended maternal family, though there was no available information about his paternal lineage before the elder Karl Großmann.

=== Trial and death ===
Großmann&#x27;s trial began on 3 July 1922 at Moabit Criminal Court. Court witnesses included Großmann&#x27;s neighbours and work collleagues, as well as over a dozen survivors chosen to testify, the latter of whom made several attempts to assault Großmann. An eyewitness hurled a set of keys at Großmann, which nearly hit his court-appointed defense counsel, while a surviving victim lunged at Großmann for accusing her and other witnesses of lying. Others cried on the stand. Großmann had retracted his initial confession and now repeated his claim that he only killed his victims because they stole from him, accusing the witnesses of telling &quot;pure lies&quot; and being &quot;ungrateful to [his] hospitality&quot;.

On the third day of the main trial, as judicial officers found Großmann dead in his cell at when they came to transport him to court. Großmann had used his bedsheet as a make-shift noose and hanged himself by tying it to a loose nail in the door frame. A bailiff left a written note on the desk of the presiding judge, . Großmann&#x27;s attorney recalled that Böhmert read the note, sighed, put on his hat, and rose to deliver the following announcement:

A death mask was cast of Großmann&#x27;s head and kept in police custody, but it is presumed to have been destroyed during the bombing of Berlin in World War II.

<text>The Manawatū Plains is an area of low-lying land in New Zealand, located on the floodplains of the Manawatū and Rangitīkei Rivers. It is some of the most fertile lands in the southwestern North Island.

Stretching from the northern Horowhenua around Levin in the south to Marton in the north, the triangular area of land extends inland from the South Taranaki Bight to almost as far as Ashhurst at the mouth of the Manawatū Gorge. It covers an area of around .

In the south, around Lake Horowhenua, the plains were once an extensive wetland, which has been largely drained and turned into profitable dairy farming land. There are conservation moves in progress to restore some of these wetlands to their former state.

Further north, the plains provide the basis for the economy which drives the city of Palmerston North and the towns of Foxton, Feilding, and Bulls, all of which rely on the agricultural dollar to an extent.

As floodplains, the land is not always entirely dry. Although the area receives slightly below the national average rainfall, floods can occur, as happened around the township of Tangimoana in early 2004.</text><links>

<text>Brassed Off is a 1996 British comedy-drama film written and directed by Mark Herman and starring Pete Postlethwaite, Tara Fitzgerald and Ewan McGregor.

The film is about the troubles faced by a colliery brass band, following the closure of their pit. The soundtrack for the film was provided by the Grimethorpe Colliery Band, and the plot is based on Grimethorpe&#x27;s own struggles against pit closures. It has been generally very positively received for its role in promoting brass bands and their music. Parts of the film make reference to the huge increase in suicides that resulted from the end of the coal industry in Britain, and the struggle to retain hope in the circumstances.

In the United States, the film was promoted simply as a romantic comedy involving McGregor and Fitzgerald&#x27;s characters.

==Context==
The film is set ten years after the year-long strike in 1984–85 by the National Union of Mineworkers in Britain. Before the privatisation of British Coal, a wave of pit closures took place. Depleted of resources following the long strike, the miners were unable to continue a resistance against the policies of the government. Many had been in debt ever since the strike, and were prepared to take redundancy money whilst it was on offer.

The National Coal Board (NCB) arranged private ballots to determine between closing a pit immediately with compulsory redundancies or taking a pit to a review procedure to determine whether the pit should be privatised. Although miners had a tradition of fighting for their jobs, the risk of losing the redundancy money on offer by going forwards to privatisation swung the votes in most ballots to be in favour of pit closure and redundancy. The loss of hope, pride and fighting spirit in previously proud mining communities was the basis for the idea of being &quot;brassed off&quot;, an expression used in the North of England meaning &quot;angry&quot;.

Beginning in early 1993, groups of miners&#x27; wives camped outside some pits&#x27; gates and outside the Department of Trade and Industry in London. This is referred to in the film. It contrasts with the muted response from the mineworkers, some of whom sang &quot;Shut the pit!&quot; to the tune of the song &quot;Here We Go!&quot; from the 1984–85 strike.

==Plot==
Gloria Mullins has been sent to her home town of Grimley to determine the profitability of the pit for the management of British Coal. She also plays the flugelhorn, and is allowed to play with the local brass band after playing &quot;Concierto de Aranjuez&quot;, affectionately known as “Orange Juice” by the characters, with them. The band is made up of miners from whom she must conceal her purpose. She renews a childhood romance with Andy Barrow, which soon leads to complications. Andy is bitter about the programme of pit closures and determined to fight on, but is also realistic about the circumstances and predicts a 4-to-1 majority for closure and redundancy.

When Andy realises Gloria is working for management, he accuses her of naïvety for thinking the Coal Board is even considering the pit&#x27;s future and argues that the decision to close would have been made years earlier. It is later revealed, during a confrontation between Gloria and colliery management, that the decision was made two years prior and was to have proceeded regardless of her findings. The report was simply a PR exercise to placate the miners and sympathetic members of the public.

The passionate band conductor Danny Ormondroyd finds he&#x27;s fighting a losing battle to keep the rest of the band committed. His son Phil is badly in debt and becomes a clown for children&#x27;s parties, but this fails to prevent his wife and children leaving him. In debt, Phil votes for the redundancy money, which he becomes ashamed of. As Danny collapses in the street and is hospitalised, Phil suffers a mental breakdown while entertaining a group of children as part of a harvest festival in a church. He refers to himself as &quot;Coco the scab&quot;—a name he was called by a debt collector whom he had asked to wait until the redundancy money came through. Eventually, Phil tries to hang himself but is taken to the hospital. Phil reveals to Danny that in light of the colliery&#x27;s closure, the band has decided not to continue playing.

When band member Jim realises Gloria is working for management, he is unimpressed with Andy&#x27;s relationship with her. In a pub conversation, the other miners are not particularly concerned and feel Jim is being too harsh. When Andy says he should be old enough to make his own decisions, Jim responds with, &quot;Old enough to be a scab, then?&quot; The pub falls silent, as the word was an extremely serious insult in a mining community and implies treachery to the working class. Jim then withdraws the insult and says that Andy is just &quot;stupid&quot;. Later, Jim asks Gloria to leave the band and mocks her attempts to fund the band&#x27;s trip to the National Finals.

Intending it to be their last performance, the band, in full uniform and wearing their miners&#x27; helmets and lamps, plays &quot;Danny Boy&quot; (the famous Percy Grainger arrangement of &quot;Londonderry Air&quot;) late at night outside the hospital. Andy, having lost his tenor horn in a bet, whistles along with his hands in his pockets. After they finish, they all switch off their lamps.

Whilst the band is playing in the National Semi-Finals, the outcome of the ballot is announced as 4-to-1 in favour of redundancy, as Andy had predicted.

After Gloria sets up a bank account to fund travel to the National Finals, the band is brought back together to compete. Andy wins his tenor horn back in a game of pool. The band forgives Gloria when she gives them her earnings from compiling the report (rejecting it because it&#x27;s &quot;dirty money&quot;) and travels to the final at the Royal Albert Hall in London (Birmingham Town Hall was used to film these scenes), where they are amused by the inability of the woman on the dressing room&#x27;s PA system to pronounce &#x27;colliery&#x27;.

Before departing, Phil leaves a note for Danny saying they are going to the finals. Danny arrives just in time to see the band win the competition with a stirring rendition of the &quot;William Tell Overture&quot; finale, during which Phil notices his wife and children in the audience. Danny refuses to accept the trophy; he states that only human beings matter and not music or the trophy. He continues, &quot;This bloody government has systematically destroyed an entire industry. &quot;Our&quot; industry. And not just our industry—our communities, our homes, our lives. All in the name of &#x27;progress&#x27;. And for a few lousy bob.&quot;

However, following this gesture, Jim takes the trophy anyway. The band celebrates their victory as Andy and Gloria kiss on the upper deck of an open-topped bus travelling through London, while Danny leads the band in the trio from Elgar&#x27;s &quot;Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1&quot;, better known as &quot;Land of Hope and Glory&quot;.

==Production==
The film is set in &quot;Grimley&quot; in the mid-1990s, which is a thin veil for Grimethorpe, a mining village in South Yorkshire which had been named as the poorest village in Britain in 1994 by the European Union. The nearby areas of the Dearne Valley and the Hemsworth area were also identified as in need of serious aid.

The hospital scene, with Pete Postlethwaite in bed, was filmed at Doncaster College, not a hospital. The festival scene in Delph was filmed on Monday 23 October 1995.

The soundtrack for the film was recorded by the Grimethorpe Colliery Band, the story roughly reflects Grimethorpe Colliery Band&#x27;s history, and the film was largely shot in Grimethorpe.

==Reception==
&quot;Brassed Off&quot; received an 80% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 49 reviews, with an average rating of 6.8/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Brassed Off&quot; combines inspiring drama with populist socioeconomics to create a film whose familiar outlines are filled in with genuine and surprisingly palpable emotion.&quot;

The film was one of Film Four Distributors first major releases and opened on 203 screens in the UK with a gross of £466,058 in its opening weekend, finishing third at the UK box office behind &quot;Dragonheart&quot; and &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot;. It went on to gross £2,128,437 in the UK.

The film&#x27;s reputation has grown considerably since its initial release. &quot;Brassed Off&quot; is ranked 85th on the BFI list of Top 100 British Films A reevaluation in 2018 concluded, &quot;Like Danny’s speech at the Royal Albert Hall, the film is honest, poignant and powerful. Twenty years on, its message is still all too relevant. And the music is bloody great, by the way.&quot;

==Soundtrack==
The film score for &quot;Brassed Off&quot; includes a large number of pieces from the brass band repertoire, played by the Grimethorpe Colliery Band conducted by John Anderson, alongside an original score composed by Trevor Jones.

==Stage adaptation==
Paul Allen adapted Mark Herman&#x27;s screenplay for the stage, the production premiering at the Crucible Theatre Sheffield on 17 March 1998, with music performed by the Grimethorpe Colliery Band. The play transferred to the Royal National Theatre in June before embarking on a UK tour. In 2014 a new UK tour was mounted by the Touring Consortium Theatre Company, coinciding with the thirtieth anniversary of the miners&#x27; strike.

==In popular culture==
A sample of a monologue performed by the main character Danny (Pete Postlethwaite) is used in the opening of the song &quot;Tubthumping&quot;, on the 1997 Chumbawamba album &quot;Tubthumper&quot;: &quot;Truth is, I thought it mattered; I thought that music mattered. But does it bollocks! Not compared to how people matter&quot;.

<doc id="1265870" wikidata="Q1550559" url="?curid=1265870" title="South African Rugby Union">
<text>The South African Rugby Union (SARU) is the governing body for rugby union in South Africa and is affiliated to World Rugby. It was established in 1992 as the South African Rugby Football Union, from the merger of the South African Rugby Board and the non-racial South African Rugby Union (SACOS), and took up its current name in 2005.

SARU organises several national teams, most notably the senior national side, the &quot;Springboks&quot;. SARU consists of 14 regional associations, each of which sends its own team to the Currie Cup, the oldest and most important league title in South Africa. In addition, the SuperSport Rugby Challenge takes place annually. 

In addition to the actual national team, the SARU also puts together other teams. The Junior Springboks are the U-20 national team and take part in the Rugby Championship and the World Championships. There are also the Blitzboks, the national team for sevens rugby. Children and young people are introduced to rugby at school and then, depending on their interest and talent, training begins. The most talented players at school level are brought together every year after Craven Week (named after Danie Craven ) in the SA Schools team. Each South African university has its own rugby team, which can take part in the Varsity Cup and the Varsity Shield.

The national championship is superseded by the international championship United Rugby Championship, which is played together with teams from Ireland and Wales, as well as two franchises each from Italy and Scotland. South Africa is represented by four franchises, which are managed by the SARU: the Bulls from Pretoria, the Lions from Johannesburg, the Sharks from Durban and the Stormers from Cape Town. Since the seasons overlap only slightly, many players are used in both professional leagues.

==History==

The South African Rugby Board was the rugby union governing body of white South Africans between 1889 and 1992. The governing of white and coloured rugby union was handled separately during South Africa under Apartheid. In 1992 the non-racial South African Rugby Union and the South African Rugby Board were merged to form the South African Rugby Football Union. The unified body changed its name in 2005 to the current South African Rugby Union.

===Kamp Staaldraad===
The debacle of the 2003 World Cup saw the Springboks exit in the quarterfinals. Further, SARU experienced the scandal of Kamp Staaldraad, the training camp run by then-Boks coach Rudolf Straeuli. Reportedly, &quot;naked players were crammed into foxholes and doused repeatedly with ice-cold water while the English national anthem and New Zealand&#x27;s haka were played over and over again... [and] were also forced into a freezing lake in the early hours of the morning to pump up rugby balls under water and... when some players tried to get out they were ordered back into the water at gunpoint.&quot; Straeuli resigned, as did Rian Oberholzer, the managing director of South Africa Rugby (Pty) Ltd, the commercial arm of SARFU. Soon afterwards, SARFU president Silas Nkununu, facing a strong reelection challenge, withdrew from consideration for election.

=== van Rooyen ===
Brian van Rooyen was elected president of SARU in 2004. He soon became a highly polarising figure in South African sport, with detractors accusing him of financial shenanigans, favouritism, and general mismanagement. His management style was also widely perceived as autocratic. One of the major gripes against the Van Rooyen administration was the allocation of venues for the Springboks home test matches. The KwaZulu-Natal Union and the Free State Union did not receive a Tri Nations Test in 2005 or 2006. Both unions, vocal opponents of Van Rooyen, accused him of punishing them for their opposition.

=== SANZAR ===
However, the biggest bone of contention surrounded the expansion of the Super Rugby competition. SANZAR, a consortium of the South African, Australian, and New Zealand governing bodies, expanded their Super 12 competition to 14 teams, a change that took effect in 2006. South Africa was entitled to add one franchise to the four from the Super 12 era. In a controversial move, the Southern Spears franchise was assured a place in the 2007 and 2008 competitions, with an increasingly unpopular promotion/relegation system established to keep the total of South African Super 14 teams at its allotted five. Van Rooyen was widely viewed as being responsible for this arrangement, which was generally opposed by the existing Super 12/14 sides. The South African government attempted to step in to address perceived problems within Van Rooyen&#x27;s administration, but he survived two years of attempts to oust him. Finally, at the February 2006 SARU General Meeting, Van Rooyen was voted out.

Oregan Hoskins, who promised a more decentralised management style, was voted in. After the election, it was alleged by Free State Rugby Union president Harold Verster that Van Rooyen had offered a bribe of ZAR 3 million (US$485,000) plus a Springboks test against France to the Free State union in exchange for the union changing its vote in the presidential election in his favour. Hoskins announced that a planned investigation into Van Rooyen&#x27;s administration would go forward. In June 2006 Van Rooyen was banned from serving in any capacity on the general council or committees of the South African Rugby Union.

As for the Spears issue, the SARU Presidents&#x27; Council issued a recommendation on 24 March 2006 that SA Rugby revisit the decision to admit the Spears. On 19 April 2006, the decision to admit the Spears was officially overturned by SARU.

===Israel ===
South African Rugby Union disinvited the Israeli team the Tel Aviv Heat from an international competition in South Africa in February 2023. South Africa Rugby&#x27;s CEO said that after listening to &quot;the opinions of important stakeholder groups,&quot; it had decided to disinvite Tel Aviv &quot;to avoid the likelihood of the competition becoming a source of division, notwithstanding the fact that Israel is a full member of World Rugby.&quot; The Tel Aviv Heat protested the decision, South African Friends of Israel said the South Africa Rugby Union &quot;bent the knee to appease political extremists in South Africa who threatened to harm and incite violence should an Israeli team participate in the sport,&quot; and the South African Zionist Federation called the decision &quot;an attack on our sportsmen and women in South Africa.&quot; The San Clemente Rhinos, which replaced Tel Aviv, issued a statement condemning discrimination saying the team &quot;stands together with Tel Aviv Heat players and coaches.&quot;

<text>Peter Williams III (born August 26, 1981) is a Canadian professional wrestler. He is signed to WWE as a backstage producer. He is best known for his time in Impact Wrestling, where he is a two-time X Division Champion. He is also known for his time in Lucha Libre USA (LLUSA), where he held the Tag Team Championship with Jon Rekon. He is known by his nickname &quot;The Canadian Destroyer&quot;, a reference to Doug Chevalier (Scott D&#x27;amore&#x27;s original mentor) and also the name of his front flip piledriver finishing move.

==Professional wrestling career==
=== Early career (2001–2004) ===
Williams was trained alongside Chris Sabin by Scott D&#x27;Amore at the Can-Am Wrestling School. Williams debuted in D&#x27;Amore&#x27;s Windsor, Ontario-based Border City Wrestling promotion in 2001. He spent the next four years working on the independent circuit in Canada for Border City Wrestling; Blood, Sweat and Ears; and in the Northern United States for promotions such as NWA Cyberspace and Pro Wrestling Guerrilla.

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling===

====Team Canada (2004–2006)====
Williams debuted in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling on February 25, 2004, a member of Team Canada. He and the remainder of Team Canada took part in the TNA 2004 World X Cup Tournament, but were defeated by Team Mexico and Team USA.

On August 11, 2004, Williams won the X Division Championship in a twenty-two man Gauntlet for the Gold match, entering at number eleven and pinning the Amazing Red to win the bout.

Early in his title reign, Williams claimed that the Canadian Destroyer could not be countered. According to Williams, Bully Ray told him to focus the entire match in his finishing move. However, after Williams successfully retained the title in a match with A.J. Styles at Victory Road on November 7, 2004, Chris Sabin began claiming that he was capable of countering the move. He went on to counter the Canadian Destroyer into his own finishing move, the &quot;Cradle Shock&quot;, on three occasions in the month following Victory Road. However, Sabin was unable to defeat Williams for the X Division Championship at Turning Point on December 5, 2004. Williams&#x27;s reign would last for five months and five days, (which would become the longest X Division title reign until Christopher Daniels won the title in 2005), before ending on January 16, 2005, at Final Resolution, where he was defeated by A.J. Styles in an Ultimate X match that also featured Sabin.
At Lockdown on April 24, 2005, Williams and fellow Team Canada member Eric Young unsuccessfully challenged America&#x27;s Most Wanted for the NWA World Tag Team Championship. They challenged then-champions The Naturals at Slammiversary on June 19, 2005, but were once again defeated.

Williams returned to the X Division on July 17, 2005, at No Surrender, unsuccessfully challenging X Division Champion Christopher Daniels. Williams, along with the rest of Team Canada, would go on to join Planet Jarrett upon TNA&#x27;s debut on Spike TV in October 2005. After winning an Ultimate X match at Bound for Glory on October 23, Williams received a title shot against A.J. Styles at Genesis on November 13, but was again defeated. Williams would resume wrestling in the X Division and faced off against Chris Sabin, Elix Skipper, Shark Boy, Puma and Chase Stevens in an Xscape Match at Lockdown. Williams and Sabin were the final two competitors, but Williams lost after Sabin was able to climb over the cage and escape.

Williams again acted as the captain of Team Canada in the 2006 World X Cup Tournament. He lost to Jushin Thunder Liger at Sacrifice in a Captain vs. Captain semifinal match, but won the Gauntlet Match final to tie the points with Team USA. On the following edition of &quot;Impact!&quot;, he lost to Team USA captain Chris Sabin in a tiebreaker singles match.

On the June 29 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Jim Cornette announced that Team Canada would be disbanded immediately. However, they were given one last chance to stay intact if they won a match a week later against Jay Lethal, Rhino, and Team 3D. Team Canada lost the match when Lethal pinned A-1, officially disbanding Team Canada once and for all. On the July 27 edition of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Williams won an X Division four-way match by defeating Sonjay Dutt, Johnny Devine, and Shark Boy after hitting Shark Boy with the Canadian Destroyer. On the following week&#x27;s &quot;Impact!&quot;, he defeated Jay Lethal, Sonjay Dutt, Kazarian and Alex Shelley and became the number one contender to the X Division Championship.

At Hard Justice, Williams challenged the X Division Champion Senshi in a triple threat match also involving Jay Lethal. During the match, Williams used the Canadian Destroyer on Lethal and was about to attempt a pinfall until Senshi dropkicked Williams out of the ring and pinned Lethal to retain his championship.

====Various feuds (2006–2007)====
Williams was invited to watch Latin American Xchange burn the American flag during the November 16 edition of &quot;Impact!&quot;, but he would make his first face turn after refusing to torch the flag. Williams was then involved in the feud between America&#x27;s Most Wanted and the Latin American Xchange. At Genesis, Homicide had Gail Kim set up for &quot;Da Gringo Killa&quot;, but Williams came in with a lead pipe to make the save.

On the following &quot;Impact!&quot;, Williams was later named as Kurt Angle&#x27;s tag team partner to face LAX for the NWA World Tag Team Championship, but he was ambushed before the match by LAX. Samoa Joe would then replace Williams as Angle&#x27;s partner. On the following week, Williams would go one on one against Homicide and defeated him via roll-up. After the match though, Homicide, Hernandez and Konnan started to beat down Williams followed by Hernandez hitting him with the &quot;Border Toss&quot;. AMW would then come out to make the save and then steal the Mexican flag. At Turning Point, Williams came out to help AMW in their flag match against LAX. During the match, he attempted the &quot;Canadian Destroyer&quot; on Konnan, but he was stopped by Hernandez. On the December 14 edition of &quot;Impact!&quot;, the LAX defeated AMW in a title vs. team match after James Storm hit Chris Harris with a beer bottle, permanently disbanding AMW. After AMW&#x27;s dissolution, their former manager Gail Kim became Williams&#x27; valet. The two later faced and were defeated by James Storm and Jacqueline Moore at Against All Odds. Petey soon split from Kim and then became involved in a storyline with former Team Canada partners Eric Young and Robert Roode as Williams&#x27; tried to help Young get out of a contract that Roode had Young signed to. The feud continued until Lockdown, where Williams faced Roode. Despite using a hockey stick, Williams was pinned by Roode after a &quot;Payoff&quot; to win the match. He later competed in the Ultimate X match at Victory Road, but was the second competitor eliminated from the match. Soon after, he remained completely unseen on television. On the October 25 edition of &quot;Impact!&quot;, he participated in a fatal four way X Division style match against Havok, Sonjay Dutt and Shark Boy, but the match went to a no-contest after Team 3D interfered and put both Williams and Havok through tables. On the November 1 edition of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Williams and the entire X Division attacked Team 3D.
====Maple Leaf Muscle (2007–2008)====
After the feud between the X Division and Team 3D died down, Williams began talking about bodybuilding and was often working out during interviews and referring to himself as &quot;Little Poppa Pump&quot;. At Turning Point, he won one of the briefcases in the Feast or Fired match. Scott Steiner, who also won one of the briefcases, would later trade cases with Williams, which unintentionally gave Petey a World Heavyweight Championship shot in the process.

In subsequent matches, Williams would bring down the briefcase to the ring and place it near the turnbuckle. During one of his matches, Steiner entered the arena and switched Petey&#x27;s world title match briefcase with the original X Division Championship match briefcase. During a tag team match with Williams and Steiner against Rock &#x27;n Rave Infection, Steiner stole both cases and left him to be pinned by Jimmy Rave. Williams and Steiner faced off at Against All Odds with the winner getting both briefcases. Steiner would go on to win the match and officially claim both briefcases. On the following &quot;Impact!&quot;, Williams once again came up short against Steiner, but after the match Steiner showed Williams respect.

Following this, Williams formed a team with Steiner and acquired the managerial services of Rhaka Khan in the process. Upon forming their alliance, Steiner and Khan put Williams through numerous initiations to prove himself worthy of their team. Williams and Steiner faced the Motor City Machine Guns in a tag team match, Petey won after pinning Alex Shelley. After the match, Williams had one more initiation to complete. Rhaka Khan brought out a black bag that contained a pair of scissors and a shaver. Steiner then cut and shaved Williams&#x27; hair, and gave him a chainlink headdress similar to Steiner&#x27;s, cementing Williams&#x27; heel turn in the process. This also gave emphasis to the nickname &quot;Little Petey Pump&quot;, a variation of Steiner&#x27;s &quot;Big Poppa Pump&quot; nickname.

Williams later competed in the &quot;Cuffed in the Cage&quot; match at Lockdown, but lost to the eventual winner Eric Young. On the April 17 edition of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Steiner gave him the X Division title shot briefcase. Later in the same episode, after Jay Lethal&#x27;s match against Johnny Devine, Williams attacked Lethal from behind, cashed in the title shot and won his second X Division Championship. Two weeks later at a taping of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Williams&#x27; orbital bone was fractured during a match. However, Williams recovered from his injury and returned at Slammiversary to successfully defend his title against Kaz and again on the &quot;Impact!&quot; after Slammiversary.

At Hard Justice, Williams retained his X Division Championship against Consequences Creed due to interference from Sheik Abdul Bashir. At No Surrender on September 14, he lost the X Division title in a triple threat match after Bashir pinned Consequences Creed. Upon losing his title, Williams had a face turn when he was attacked by Bashir as well as Rock &#x27;n Rave Infection. Williams would then participate in the Steel Asylum Match at Bound for Glory IV, but came up short as Jay Lethal won.

====The Frontline (2008–2009)====

On the October 30 edition of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Williams along with A.J. Styles, Samoa Joe, Jay Lethal, Consequences Creed, Eric Young, O.D.B. and The Motor City Machine Guns formed a faction of younger wrestlers, known as The Frontline, to oppose The Main Event Mafia (Sting, Kurt Angle, Kevin Nash, Booker T and Sharmell). Later that night, Scott Steiner returned from his injury, attacked Williams&#x27; allies and joined the Main Event Mafia. Unlike the rest of the MEM, Steiner spared Williams from a beating.

On the November 13 edition of &quot;Impact!&quot;, after seemingly being in-between the two sides, Williams suffered a beating at the hands of the Main Event Mafia, which included Steiner tossing Williams off a ladder and busting him open and as a result, ended his affiliation with Williams thus turning Williams into a face character. Williams returned on the January 15 edition of &quot;Impact!&quot; attacking Scott Steiner while referee Earl Hebner was distracted by guest enforcer Mick Foley. Williams cost Steiner the match with a missile dropkick leading to AJ Styles hitting the Pelé on Steiner for the win. Williams and AJ embraced after the match. Williams would go on to lose to Steiner at Against All Odds, and once again on the following &quot;Impact!&quot; in a &quot;Head Dress on a Pole&quot; match, effectively ending their feud.

In January 2009, TNA informed Williams that the company would not renew his contract that was expiring later that month. Williams wrestled his last match for the company on February 10, at the tapings of the February 19 edition of &quot;Impact!&quot;, when he teamed with former Team Canada partner Eric Young to take on Beer Money, Inc. for the World Tag Team Title. He was pinned in the match, and due to a previous stipulation, was banished from TNA.

===Independent circuit (2009–2014)===
After departing from TNA, Williams made a one-night return to Border City Wrestling on March 28 to compete in an eight-man gauntlet match to determine who would claim the vacant Heavyweight Championship. Tyson Dux ultimately won the match and the title.

=== WWE (2022–present) ===

He appeared on the December 5, 2022 edition of &quot;Raw&quot; breaking up the brawl alongside various WWE officials between Bobby Lashley and Seth &quot;Freakin&quot; Rollins only for him to get accidentally speared by Lashley.

==Professional wrestling style and persona==

Having popularised the sunset flip piledriver, which he called the Canadian Destroyer, Williams has been credited as the inventor of the move, though there is evidence of Amazing Red performing it in the 1990s. According to Williams, the move was suggested to him in 2003 while travelling to an IWA Mid-South show along with Chris Sabin and Truth Martini. Williams and Sabin originally planned to use the move in their match together but decided against it. The next month, Williams debuted the move in a match against Matt Sydal. During the mid 2000s, it was viewed as a powerful and popular move; the devastation of the piledriver combined with the acrobatics of the flip appeared like an animation from a video game. In the 2010s, several wrestlers adopted the Canadian Destroyer as a transition move. Williams has complained about this fact as his move was intended to be a finishing maneuver. In the later part of the 2010s, many wrestlers began to use the Canadian Destroyer as finishers, such as Adam Cole, which he calls the &quot;Panama Sunrise&quot;.

==Other media==
He appeared in the video game &quot;TNA Impact!&quot; as a downloadable character.

==Personal life==
Williams plays guitar and harmonica in a band called The High Crusade, which also includes former TNA wrestlers Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin and their friends Adam Tatro and Chris Plumb. The band released their debut album, &quot;It&#x27;s Not What You Think&quot;, on September 7, 2010.

Petey has been married and divorced twice and has children from both marriages (three in total).

<text>May-as, also called Mangyan tagabukid, is a term for the indigenous people of the island of Sibuyan, in the Philippines.

Sibuyanon is the name of the dialect of Romblomanon spoken on the island of Sibuyan.

The local people commonly refer them to as “Mangyan”. the Indigenous people, however, prefer to call them “Sibuyanon”, the way the other inhabitants in the island are called. This is because they are aware that the term “Mangyan” carries with negative connotations among lowlanders. It is unsure if they are even related to the Mangyans of Mindoro island to the northwest.

The May-as are clustered in groups of two to four houses, scattered throughout the rolling and hilly areas of Sibuyan Island. They are essentially farmers but they also extract resources from the forests and rivers.

<text>All-around defense or perimeter defense is a type of defensive fighting position intended to give military units the ability to repel attacks from any direction.

The positioning of the outer defensive fighting positions of a unit, is circular or triangular, from a bird&#x27;s-eye view.

One version consists of soldiers forming a wide circle around the soldier in charge (and radioman etc.) with a spacing typically of 3–4 metres between each person (on the circle&#x27;s circumference).
When a group of soldiers relocate as a part of a defensive operation, a perimeter defense can be temporarily maintained without cover.

It is located in the southwest of the island, and follows the catchment area of the Rangitīkei River.

The Rangitikei District Council is the local government authority for this district. It is composed of a mayor, currently Andy Watson, and 11 councillors, one of whom is the deputy mayor.

<text>&quot;Star Light, Star Bright&quot; is an English language nursery rhyme of American origin. It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 16339.

==Lyrics==
The lyrics usually conform to the following:
:Star light, star bright,
:First star I see tonight;
:I wish I may, I wish I might
:Have the wish I wish tonight.

==Origins==
The superstition of hoping for wishes granted when seeing a shooting or falling star may date back to the ancient world. Wishing on the first star seen may also predate this rhyme, which first began to be recorded in late nineteenth-century America. The song and tradition seem to have reached Britain by the early twentieth century and have since spread worldwide.

==In popular culture==
It is used in the 1940 Disney film &quot;Pinocchio&quot; and related Disney media.

It is used in the 1953 Sci-Fi film &quot;It Came from Outer Space&quot;.

It was used as the title of a 1953 short story by Alfred Besser, and later for a 1976 collection of his work

The first and third verse is recited by Lenore Karidian to Captain Kirk in the 1966 Star Trek original series episode &quot;Conscience of the King&quot;

It is paraphrased in the 1971 song Pearl from the album People Like Us by The Mamas &amp; The Papas

It is featured in the chorus of Dave Loggins’ 1979 song “If I Had My Wish Tonight,” which was a Top 40 hit for David Lasley in 1982.

The first half is featured in the chorus of Madonna&#x27;s 1983 song Lucky Star.

It is partially quoted in the song &quot;Take Me Away&quot; on Blue Öyster Cult&#x27;s 1983 album &quot;The Revölution by Night&quot;.

The rhyme is quoted and referenced on Metallica&#x27;s 1996 single “&quot;King Nothing&quot;”, released for the album Load.

It is also quoted in the chorus of an unreleased Simple Minds track Space, taken from the album Our Secrets Are The Same which was recorded in 2000 and was not commercially released due to a dispute with their record company. However, the album was included in the 2004 Silver Box boxset.

The 2010 song &quot;Settle Down&quot; by Kimbra includes the first half of the rhyme in its chorus.

In &quot;Puss in Boots: The Last Wish&quot;, it is used as the plot&#x27;s basis, the quest for the Wishing Star, in addition to providing deeper meaning to the film&#x27;s central themes. It is read verbatim in the opening and repeated later on.

It is also quoted in Nicki Minaj&#x27;s 2023 song &quot;Last Time I Saw You&quot;.

<doc id="1265908" wikidata="Q1432948" url="?curid=1265908" title="Pseudolite">
<text>Pseudolite is a contraction of the term &quot;pseudo-satellite,&quot; used to refer to something that is not a satellite which performs a function commonly in the domain of satellites. Pseudolites are most often small transceivers that are used to create a local, ground-based Global Positioning System (GPS) alternative. The range of each transceiver&#x27;s signal is dependent on the power available to the unit.

Being able to deploy one&#x27;s own positioning system, independent of the GPS, can be useful in situations where the normal GPS signals are either blocked/jammed (military conflicts), or simply not available (exploration of other planets).
Pseudolites are normally used to augment the GPS by improving dilution of precision (DOP). Or pseudolites are also used to implement GPS-like indoor location systems, where pseudolites are acting as GPS satellites. Pseudolites use cheap voltage controlled oscillator, so pseudolite based location system shall provide a methodology to compensate clock differences among pseudolites.

For planetary exploration, research being conducted at facilities including NASA&#x27;s Ames Research Center and Stanford University (see link at bottom) may allow a rover to deploy an array of pseudolites with no particular accuracy and still calibrate the system to centimeter-level resolution without human assistance. This would aid a rover&#x27;s path-finding routines and increase the safe maneuvering speed of the unassisted vehicle. The concept is sometimes referred to as a Self-Calibrating Pseudolite Array (SCPA).

Other applications of pseudolite arrays include precision approach landing systems for aircraft and highly accurate tracking of transponders.

Pseudolites have started to gain more and more attention in the context of indoor location.

<doc id="1265911" wikidata="Q1859702" url="?curid=1265911" title="Sibuyan Island">
<text>Sibuyan is a crescent-shaped island, the second largest in an archipelago comprising Romblon Province, Philippines. Located in the namesake Sibuyan Sea, it has an area of and has a total population of 62,815, as of the 2020 census. The island has two prominent peaks, the highest is Mount Guiting-Guiting, with an elevation of , followed by Mount Nailog, which is high. The people speak the Sibuyanon dialect of Romblomanon, a Visayan language.
Sibuyan has been dubbed by some local and international natural scientists as &quot;the Galápagos of Asia&quot;, because it has remained in isolation from the rest of the world since its formation. Never in its geological history has it ever been connected with any part of the Philippine archipelago. Seismic forces pushed up a peak from the Earth&#x27;s crust, forming a series of smaller peaks and slopes. The peak is Mount Guiting-Guiting (literally means &quot;the saw-toothed mountain&quot;, in reference to its jagged ridge). Because of the steep slopes, much of its original forest remains untouched, and the rest is the island as we find it today.

Primary forests cover , which is 33% of the land area of Sibuyan. However, most of the lower altitude forest has been logged or is secondary. Mount Guiting-guiting Natural Park (equivalent to the IUCN category of National Park) was established to protect these forests, which are mainly in the centre and north of the island, and covers an area of out of Sibuyan&#x27;s total area of . The park features a scenic landscape with twin towering peaks set amidst closed canopy forests. Its forests remain largely intact, and include the entire elevational gradient from lowland dipterocarp forest (at 200 to 900 m) and mangroves, through montane forest (above 700 m) to mossy forest, heathland and montane grassland around the peaks.

==Political subdivision==
The island is divided into three municipalities: Cajidiocan, Magdiwang, and San Fernando.

==Biodiversity==
Sibuyan has a rich biodiversity of flora and fauna. Exact figures on numbers of total plant species are hard to give, as biologists stumble upon species yet unidentified by the scientific community. In one study, the National Museum identified 1,551 trees in a single hectare, with 123 species of trees, and of this number, 54 are found nowhere else in the world. Hence, it has been proclaimed as one of the world&#x27;s most diverse and dense forests. There are estimated to be 700 vascular plant species on the island. &quot;Nepenthes sibuyanensis&quot;, a pitcher plant species, is also endemic as its scientific name suggests. There are 131 species of birds and ten species of fruit bats, and many dwelling mammals, reptiles, and rodents yet to be fully catalogued. Three birds subspecies are endemic to Sibuyan: the Philippine hanging parrot (Loriculus philippensis bournsi), the Philippine Pygmy-woodpecker (Dendrocopos maculatus menagei), and the Orange-bellied Flowerpecker (Dicaeum trigonostigma sibuyanicum), all of which were recorded there in the early 1990s. Five species of threatened mammals, one fruit bat and four rodents, are endemic to Sibuyan, and the endangered fruit bat &quot;Nyctimene rabori&quot; occurs there.

===An unspoiled ecosystem===

Sibuyan Island has been said to be one of the most unspoiled ecosystems in the Philippines and the world. The water of the Cantingas River as well as most of the other smaller rivers and rivulets on the island was tested to be one of the best water quality for human consumption worldwide. The drinking water of Sibuyanons come direct and untreated from rivers, springs and holes drilled at mountain slopes or from the ground.

===Mammals===

The Sibuyan striped shrew-rat (Chrotomys sibuyanensis) is a species of rodents in the Muridae family endemic to Sibuyan.

The Sibuyan shrew (Crocidura ninoyi) is a species of shrew in the Soricidae family endemic to Sibuyan.

==Mining activities==
Mining operations in Sibuyan have started since 2005, when a barangay of San Fernando endorsed mining projects in their area, believing that this will create jobs for residents, although exploration of the area began as early as 1972. On October 3, 2007, Romblon town councilor Armin Marin was shot dead during an anti-mining protest against the operations of mining company Sibuyan Nickel Properties Development Corp. when a confrontation erupted between protesters and the firm&#x27;s security guards.

The Sibuyanons Against Mining advocacy group, with the Sibuyan Island Sentinels League for Environment Inc. (Sibuyan ISLE) has been fighting for the conservation and protection of the island against mining activities considering its vast impact on the ecology, culture and society of the island.

===2023 Altai Philippines Mining Corporation protest===

In December 2022, the government issued a mineral ore export permit to the Altai Philippines Mining Corporation (APMC), allowing the company to bulk test 50,000 metric tons of ore. In January 2023, Sibuyan residents set up a barricade to protest APMC operations, saying the extraction of nickel ore will disrupt the island&#x27;s intact ecosystems. On February 3, 2023, according to the environmental advocacy organization Alyansa Tigil Mina (ATM), protesters formed a human barricade intended to stop APMC trucks carrying nickel ore from leaving the San Fernando port, but the trucks forced their way through the barricade. This prompted 30 policemen to intervene and disperse the residents.

On February 4, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) served a notice to APMC stating that the company was found to be &quot;constructing/operating a causeway project without an approved environmental compliance certificate&quot;. Two days later the company has voluntarily stopped all exploration and testing activities in the area, stating that they are committed to maintaining the &quot;highest standards of environmental responsibility and community engagement&quot;. On February 8, DENR ordered a probe to conduct an investigation into the alleged damage of seagrass and other marine resources due to AMPC operations, and to take legal action for reportedly cutting trees without the necessary permit.

In a statement on February 10, the company said that it was &quot;peacefully exercising its rights&quot; under a 2009 agreement with DENR, and has appealed for due process, claiming it has been &quot;maligned, unfairly judged, and prevented from performing its lawful activities&quot;.

==Other events==
On June 21, 2008, the passenger ferry MV &quot;Princess of the Stars&quot; of Sulpicio Lines (now Philippine Span Asia Carrier Corp.) capsized off the coast of the island in the height of Typhoon Frank. Of the 851 passengers, only 32 survived.

<doc id="1265916" wikidata="Q1121334" url="?curid=1265916" title="Postfix (software)">
<text>Postfix is a free and open-source mail transfer agent (MTA) that routes and delivers electronic mail.

It is released under the IBM Public License 1.0 which is a free software license. Alternatively, starting with version 3.2.5, it is available under the Eclipse Public License 2.0 at the user&#x27;s option.

Originally written in 1997 by Wietse Venema at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center in New York, and first released in December 1998, Postfix continues to be actively developed by its creator and other contributors. The software is also known by its former names VMailer and IBM Secure Mailer.
The name Postfix is a compound of &quot;post&quot; (which is another word for &quot;mail&quot;) and &quot;bugfix&quot; (which is for other software that inspired Postfix development).

==Typical deployment==
As an SMTP server, Postfix implements a first layer of defense against spambots and malware. Administrators can combine Postfix with other software that provides spam/virus filtering (e.g., Amavisd-new), message-store access (e.g., Dovecot), or complex SMTP-level access-policies (e.g., postfwd, milter-regex, policyd-weight).

As an SMTP client, Postfix implements a high-performance parallelized mail-delivery engine. Postfix is often combined with mailing-list software (such as Mailman).

==Operating systems==
Postfix runs (or has run) on AIX, BSD, HP-UX, Linux, macOS, Solaris and, generally speaking, on every Unix-like operating system that ships with a C compiler and delivers a standard POSIX development environment. It is the default MTA for the
macOS, NetBSD,
RedHat/CentOS and Ubuntu operating systems.

==Architecture==

Postfix consists of a combination of server programs that run in the background, and client programs that are invoked by user programs or by system administrators.

The Postfix core consists of several dozen server programs that run in the background, each handling one specific aspect of email delivery. Examples are the SMTP server, the scheduler, the address rewriter, and the local delivery server. For damage-control purposes, most server programs run with fixed reduced privileges, and terminate voluntarily after processing a limited number of requests. To conserve system resources, most server programs terminate when they become idle.

Client programs run outside the Postfix core. They interact with Postfix server programs through mail delivery instructions in the user&#x27;s ~/.forward file, and through small &quot;gate&quot; programs to submit mail or to request queue status information.

Other programs provide administrative support to start or stop Postfix, query status information, manipulate the queue, or to examine or update its configuration files.

; Yellow ellipses: One of Postfix&#x27; many daemons serving exactly one purpose. This split-up into many smaller pieces of software is considered one of the reasons why Postfix is secure and stable.
; Blue boxes: The blue boxes represent so-called &quot;lookup tables&quot;. A lookup table consists of two columns (key and value) containing information used for access control, e-mail routing etc.
; Orange boxes: The orange boxes are either mail queues or files. In either case, e-mails are stored on persistent media (e.g., a hard disk).
; White clouds: The clouds stand for points at which e-mails enter or leave Postfix. For example, &quot;smtpd&quot; receives mail from other mail servers or users whereas &quot;smtp&quot; relays mail to other MTAs.

==Implementation==
The Postfix implementation uses safe subsets of the C language and of the POSIX system API. These subsets are buried under an abstraction layer that contains about 50% of all Postfix source code, and that provides the foundation on which all Postfix programs are built. For example, the &quot;vstring&quot; primitive makes Postfix code resistant to buffer overflow
attacks, and the &quot;safe open&quot; primitive makes Postfix code resistant to race condition attacks on systems that implement the POSIX file system
API. This abstraction layer does not affect the attack resistance of non-Postfix code, such as code in system libraries or in third-party libraries.

==Robustness==
Conceptually, Postfix manages pipelines of processes that pass the responsibility for message delivery and error notification from one process to the next. All message and notification &quot;state&quot; information is persisted in the file system. The processes in a pipeline operate mostly without centralized control; this relative autonomy simplifies error recovery. When a process fails before completing its part of a file or protocol transaction, its predecessor in the pipeline backs off and retries the request later, and its successor in the pipeline discards unfinished work. Many Postfix daemons can simply &quot;die&quot; when they run into a problem; they are automatically restarted when the next service request arrives. This approach makes Postfix highly resilient, as long as the operating system or hardware don&#x27;t fail catastrophically.

==Performance==
One single Postfix instance has been clocked at ~300 message deliveries/second
across the Internet, running on commodity hardware (a vintage-2003 Dell 1850 system with battery-backed MegaRAID controller and two SCSI
disks). This delivery rate is an order of magnitude below the &quot;intrinsic&quot; limit of 2500 message deliveries/second
that was achieved with the mail queue on a RAM disk while delivering to the &quot;discard&quot; transport (with a dual-core Opteron system in 2007).

Mail systems such as Postfix and Qmail achieve high performance by delivering mail in parallel sessions. With mail systems such as Sendmail and Exim that do one delivery at a time, high performance can be achieved by submitting limited batches of mail in parallel, so that each batch is delivered by a different process. Postfix and Qmail require parallel submission into different MTA instances once they reach their intrinsic performance limit, or the performance limits of the hardware or operating system.

The delivery rates cited above are largely theoretical. With bulk mail delivery, the actual delivery rate primarily depends on the receiver&#x27;s mail receiving policies and by the sender&#x27;s reputation.

==Base configuration==
The main.cf file stores site-specific Postfix configuration parameters while master.cf defines daemon processes. The Postfix Basic Configuration tutorial covers the core settings that each site needs to consider, and the Postfix Standard Configuration Examples document discusses configuration settings for a few common environments. The Postfix Address Rewriting document covers address rewriting and mail routing. The full documentation collection is at Postfix Documentation

More complex Postfix implementations may include: integration with other applications such as SpamAssassin; support for multiple virtual domain names - and use databases such as MySQL to control complex configurations.

==Surveys==
Large: In Shodan scan results from middle February 2025, Postfix was detected 2.57 million times, Exim 2.56 million times. Some sites block Shodan probes, but it is unclear whether this would materially affect the Postfix to Exim ratio.

Small: In a 10 times smaller study published on February 1, 2025 by E-Soft, Inc., 0.21 million mail servers ran Postfix, making it a distant second behind Exim with 0.31 million. The E-Soft survey is often cited, but it reports on a much smaller population than Shodan.

<doc id="1265922" wikidata="Q389889" url="?curid=1265922" title="Mount Guiting-Guiting">
<text>Mount Guiting-Guiting is the highest mountain in the province of Romblon, located in Sibuyan Island, in the Philippines, with an elevation of above sea level. Its steep slopes and jagged peak, have earned it a reputation as one of the most technically challenging mountains to climb in the Philippines. It is ranked as the 11th-most prominent mountain in the Philippines, and 71st-highest peak of an island in the world. Located at the heart of Sibuyan, it dominates the landscape for miles around. Guiting-Guiting, in the Romblomanon dialect means &quot;jagged&quot;. It is one of the focal points of Sibuyan&#x27;s declaration as a biodiversity haven and has been dubbed by some local and international natural scientists as &quot;The Galapagos of Asia.&quot; The island of Sibuyan has often been compared with the biodiversity endemism rate of the Galápagos Islands in Ecuador. This high endemism prompted much of the mountain and its slopes to be protected in 1996 as the &quot;Mt. Guiting-Guiting Natural Park&quot;. The park also encompasses the nearby 789-metre (2,589-ft) high Mount Nailog to the west.

==Hiking==
Guiting-Guiting is often referred to as &quot;Mount G2&quot;, although the nickname is not accepted by the locals as it disrespects the indigenous name of the sacred site. The mountain is open all year round for hiking, with two established trails; the Tampayan Trail from the north, and the Olango Trail from the south. Hiking permits and guides are secured from the DENR office in Magdiwang town. The entire upper trails consist of exposed, broken, and sharp ultramafic rocks and boulders. The summit area of Mount Guiting-Guiting is primarily a heath land and grassland with exposed rocks on the serrated ridges of the peak.

Though the length and duration of the climb is relatively short, from one to three days depending on experience and trail difficulty, this mountain is still acknowledged as one of the most difficult and technically challenging Philippine mountain to climb, with 9/9 difficulty.

=== History ===
In May 1982, under the leadership of Arturo Valdez, a joint team from the Bacolod-based Philippine Mountaineering Society (PMS) and the University of the Philippines (UP) assaulted the mountain, the attempt of which was to be the first in history.

It was during this expedition that one of the peaks, now known as &quot;Mayo&#x27;s Peak&quot; was named after one of the team members, Mayo Monteza, who celebrated his birthday during the climb. One of the water spring sources is now known as &quot;Bulod&#x27;s Spring&quot;, after a local guides named Bulod who volunteered (along with another locals) to join the climb.

The team failed to take the summit on this first attempt, but came back two weeks afterwards. On 17 June 1982, four climbers became the first to stand at the summit. Their names are Mon Ruiz, Kim Valino, Roel Tan Torres (of UP mountaineers) and Edwin Gatia of the PMS team.

== Biodiversity ==
Sibuyan Island has extremely high endemism largely due to its remoteness. More than half of the Island is covered with forest. Preliminary reports include that the forest density in Sibuyan is 1,551 trees per hectare making it the densest forest ever recorded in the Philippines. There exists a full range of forest gradient in the Philippines consisting of mangrove, lowland, montane, mossy forests, heathland, and grassland—from the shoreline up to the summit of Mt. Guiting-Guiting,

There are approximately 700 vascular plant species, including 54 species that are endemic to the island. These include &quot;Nepenthes sibuyanensis&quot;; &quot;Nepenthes argentii&quot;; &quot;Heterospathe sibuyanensis Becc&quot;. (Bil-is), &quot;Agalmyla sibuyanensis&quot; (Sibuyan lipstick plant); &quot;Myrmephytum beccarii&quot; Elmer (Sibuyan ant plant); &quot;Begonia gitingensis&quot; Elmer (Guiting-guiting begonia).

A total of 130 species of birds have been recorded in the park, of which 102 are either known or presumed to be breeding residents. There are also nine (9) native non-flying terrestrial mammal species, nine fruit bats species, of which one is endemic, and nine (9) lizards and geckos.

<doc id="1265923" wikidata="Q4736524" url="?curid=1265923" title="Alternative literature">
<text>Alternative literature (or alt-lit) is a literary movement strongly influenced by internet culture and online publishing. It includes various forms of prose, poetry, and new media. Alt-lit is characterized by self-publication and a presence on social media networks. Alternative literature brings together people with a common interest in the online publishing world.

==Origins==
The term was first used to refer to this community of writers in the summer of 2011, when Tumblr and Twitter accounts named &quot;Alt Lit Gossip&quot; emerged, created by Cory Stephens (@outmouth). The accounts covered writers from presses and publications such as Muumuu House, &quot;Pop Serial&quot;, and &quot;HTMLgiant&quot; in a style akin to celebrity gossip sources like &quot;TMZ&quot;. After a few months the original accounts were deleted; they were revived by Frank Hinton in the fall of 2011, and began to gain popularity.

==Shared traits across Alt Lit==
Alt Lit is often characterized by self-publication, self-promotion, and the maintenance of a presence on social media networks. Josh Soilker has said that Alt Lit is &quot;in blog posts, videos, gchats and Facebook status updates. In PDFs and folded papers...&quot; and that the movement&#x27;s principal figures were Tao Lin, Noah Cicero and Brandon Scott Gorrell.

Alt Lit writers share Gmail chat logs, image macros, screenshots, and tweets, which are then self-published as poetry books and/or novels.

Writing for the &quot;New Yorker&quot;, Kenneth Goldsmith characterized Alt Lit writing as &quot;marked by direct speech, expressions of aching desire, and wide-eyed sincerity&quot;. He also noted that Alt Lit is &quot;usually written in the Internet vernacular of lowercase letters, inverted punctuation, abundant typos, and bad grammar&quot;.

==Authors and works==

===Literary magazines and blogs===
Online and print Alt Lit magazines include &quot;SWAY Press&quot;, &quot;Illuminati Girl Gang&quot;, &quot;New Wave Vomit&quot;, &quot;Pop Serial&quot;, &quot;Shabby Doll House&quot;, &quot;Have U Seen My Whale&quot;, &quot;The Bushwick Review&quot;, &quot;The Mall&quot;, &quot;Keep This Bag Away From Children&quot;, &quot;Everyday Genius&quot;, &quot;Metazen&quot;, &quot;Housefire&quot;, &quot;UP Literature&quot;, &quot;Parlor&quot;, &quot;Sadcore Dadwave&quot;, &quot;Red Lightbulbs&quot;, &quot;In Parentheses&quot; and &quot;Unsure if i will allow my beard to grow for much longer&quot;.

Alt Lit news and creative blogs include &quot;Alt Lit Gossip&quot;, &quot;I Am Alt Lit&quot;, &quot;Internet Poetry&quot;, &quot;HTMLGiant&quot;, &quot;Beach Sloth&quot;, &quot;Allthemacchs&quot;, &quot;Heartcloud&quot;, &quot;FRXTL&quot;, &quot;Cutty Spot&quot;, and &quot;Alt Lit Press&quot;.

===Presses and books===
Presses publishing Alt Lit writing include Muumuu House, Civil Coping Mechanisms, Sorry House, Habitat, Boost House, Lazy Fascist, Macro, Nap, Scrambler Books, Publishing Genius, and Plain Wrap Press.

Two anthologies of Alt Lit writing are &quot;The Yolo Pages&quot; (2014, Boost House) and &quot;40 Likely To Die Before 40: An Introduction to Alt Lit&quot; (2014, Civil Coping Mechanisms).

More than 150 books, e-books, and zines of Alt Lit writing, mostly self-published, have been catalogued on the Tumblr blog &quot;Alt Lit Library&quot;. Mellow Pages Library in Bushwick, Brooklyn, offers a wide selection of Alt Lit titles and hosts Alt Lit readings and book releases.

==Related concepts and movements==
Many writers and critics in and around the Alt Lit community have proposed different labels to be used in conjunction with or in place of &quot;Alt Lit.&quot;

===New Sincerity===
Some critics have linked Alt Lit writers with New Sincerity, to the point of using the terms interchangeably. Notable Alt Lit writers such as Steve Roggenbuck, Spencer Madsen and Tao Lin have also been grouped under the label &quot;New Sincerity&quot;, but many Alt Lit writers reject the influence of David Foster Wallace and prominent mainstream exponents of a &quot;New Sincerity&quot; such as Jonathan Franzen.

The New Sincerity connection entails the use of an array of literary techniques intended to create the impression of &quot;sincere&quot; communication, ranging from autobiography, self-revision and a conversational tone to minimal punctuation and sans-serif fonts.

===Autofiction===
Many Alt Lit writers, including Megan Boyle and Tao Lin, write autobiographical fiction or autofiction.

=== Electronic literature ===
Electronic literature (or e-lit, pronounced &quot;ee-litt&quot;) is an older field including any literary work explicitly written to be read on a digital computer or network. What scholar Leonardo Flores calls third generation electronic literature - literary works that use social media and other popular platforms - would include many works that are also thought of as alt.lit.

<text>Bethlehem Steel Corporation Shipbuilding Division was created in 1905 when the Bethlehem Steel Corporation of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, acquired the San Francisco-based shipyard Union Iron Works. In 1917, it was incorporated as Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, Limited.

The division&#x27;s headquarters were moved to Quincy, Massachusetts, after acquiring the Fore River Shipyard in 1913.

In 1940, Bethlehem Shipbuilding was the largest of the &quot;Big Three&quot; U.S. shipbuilders that could build any ship, followed by Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock and New York Shipbuilding Corporation (New York Ship). Bethlehem expanded shortly before and during World War II as a result of the Long Range Shipbuilding Program and later the Emergency Shipbuilding program orchestrated by the United States Maritime Commission and the Two Ocean Navy program and its war-time successors by the military establishment.

In 1964, the now-corporate headquarters moved to Sparrows Point, Maryland, southeast of Baltimore, whose shipyard had been acquired in 1916.

The Quincy / Fore River yard was sold to General Dynamics Corporation in the mid-1960s, and closed in 1986. The Alameda Works Shipyard in California was closed by Bethlehem Steel in the early 1970s, while the San Francisco facility (former Union Iron Works) was sold to British Aerospace in the mid-1990s and survives today as BAE Systems San Francisco Ship Repair.

Bethlehem Steel ceased shipbuilding activities in 1997 in an attempt to preserve its core steelmaking operations.

<text>Beautiful Losers is the second and final novel by Canadian writer and musician Leonard Cohen. It was published in 1966, before he began his career as a singer-songwriter.

Set in the Canadian province of Quebec, the story of 17th-century Mohawk saint Catherine Tekakwitha is interwoven with a love triangle between an unnamed anglophone Canadian folklorist; his Native wife, Edith, who has committed suicide; and his best friend, the mystical F, a Member of Parliament and a leader in the Quebec separatist movement. The complex novel makes use of a vast range of literary techniques, and a wealth of allusion, imagery, and symbolism. It is filled with the mysticism, radicalism, sexuality, and drug-taking emblematic of the 1960s era, and is noted for its linguistic, technical, and sexual excesses.

Cohen wrote the novel over two eight-month sessions while living on the Greek island of Hydra in 1964 and 1965. He fasted and consumed amphetamines to focus his creativity on the novel. Despite a lavish rollout, sales were disappointing, and critics were initially unsympathetic or hostile. The book gained critical and commercial attention only after Cohen had given up novel-writing and turned to the songwriting and performing upon which his fame rests. &quot;Beautiful Losers&quot; has come to be seen as having introduced postmodernism into Canadian literature. It has become a steady seller, and is considered a part of the Canadian literary canon.

==Overview==
The novel reflects the zeitgeist of the 1960s. While its prose is simple, the book itself is difficult, and dense in imagery and symbolism. It is broken into three &quot;books&quot;, each with a different narrator: the historian (called &quot;I.&quot; by critics) is the narrator of book one, &quot;The History of Them All&quot;, which is the longest book; &quot;A Long Letter from F.&quot; makes up the second book, a letter from F. to the narrator of the first book; and the third book is narrated by an unnamed third person, and is called &quot;Beautiful Losers: An Epilogue in the Third Person&quot;.

===Synopsis===

At the centre of the novel are the members of a love triangle, united by their obsessions and fascination with a 17th-century Mohawk, Saint Catherine Tekakwitha. The triangle is made up of the unnamed narrator, an authority on the vanishing A———— tribe; his wife Edith, one of the last surviving members of the tribe; and their maniacal and domineering friend, &quot;F.&quot;, who may or may not exist.

Book one opens with an unnamed anglophone Canadian narrator asking &quot;Who are you, Catherine Tekakwitha?&quot; The narrator&#x27;s wife hides in an elevator shaft, intending to have her husband kill her when he comes home. Her plan misfires somewhat, however—it is a delivery boy, instead, who takes the elevator that kills her. The narrator and F. console each other in bed over Edith&#x27;s death.

The narrator and F. attend a demonstration in Montreal&#x27;s &quot;Parc Lafontaine&quot;, where I. gets so caught up in the nationalistic Québécois that he joins in himself, shouting, &quot;Fuck the English!&quot;

The narrator flees to the treehouse F. has left him in his will.

Book two consists of a letter composed by F., intended to be read five years after his death by the narrator of book one. As such, chronologically it takes place before book one.

F. escapes the asylum he is in and makes for the treehouse he will leave for the narrator of the first book. F. is cared for in an insane asylum by nurse Mary Voolnd, of the A———— as was Edith. The letter is written in the occupational therapy room of the hospital.

Book three opens with a figure in a treehouse, with burnt fingers like the first book&#x27;s narrator, but also missing a thumb, as F. did after blowing up the statue of Queen Victoria. He is being hunted down as an escaped inmate and terrorist. He is given a ride by a blond woman wearing moccasins, who calls herself Isis, in Greek.

==Primary characters==





==Themes==

Sex plays a major role in the novel, though the sex scenes tend to be oral or masturbatory. Homosexuality and bisexuality are prominent.

Natives are seen as being displaced by the French, while the English displace the French, and are themselves oppressed by the Americans. The English and French in Canada are seen as both oppressors and oppressed, which ties F. and I. together. According to F., the Québécois are able to come together under their feeling of oppression by the anglophones, but anglophone Canada is unable to bring together a national identity to distinguish themselves from the Americans.

I. and F. were both raised in a Jesuit orphanage in Montreal. Melancholic I. identifies with victims and losers, such as the &quot;A————&quot; tribe, whose very name is said to mean &quot;corpse in the language of all the neighboring tribes&quot;. while F. tries to ignore or overcome his &quot;loser&quot;-ness. He asserts himself by throwing himself into the Charles Axis bodybuilding course advertised in a comic book (a parody of the Charles Atlas advertisements well known to contemporary comic-book readers). He asserts his culture by becoming a leader in the Quebec separatist movement.

==Background==
Cohen had published a number of books of poetry since the 1956 appearance of &quot;Let Us Compare Mythologies&quot;, and one novel, &quot;The Favourite Game&quot; (1963). He had been living on the Greek island of Hydra in the early to mid-1960s, and had composed &quot;The Favourite Game&quot; and a book of poetry, &quot;Flowers for Hitler&quot;, there. On Hydra, English was spoken, and there was an artists&#x27; colony there.

Cohen wanted to write a &quot;liturgy, a big confessional oration, very crazy, but using all the techniques of the modern novel ... pornographic suspense, humor and conventional plotting&quot;.

Cohen wrote most of the novel during two concentrated eight-month periods in 1964 and 1965. He wrote using a typewriter in a house in Hydra while listening to a portable record player, on which he listened to his favourite Ray Charles record, &quot;The Genius Sings the Blues&quot;. At first he managed only three pages a day, and sometimes wrote only one hour a day. When the novel began to take shape, he worked up to fifteen hours a day, with the help of amphetamines. He later claimed that amphetamine use was a mistake &quot;for depressed people&quot;, as coming down was particularly hard. He said it took &quot;ten years to fully recover&quot;.

The first period of writing was interrupted when Cohen returned to Canada in October 1964 to receive the &quot;Prix littéraire du Québec&quot; for &quot;The Favourite Game&quot;, followed by a reading tour. One result of the tour was the film &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen... Mr. Leonard Cohen&quot;, released in 1965 from the National Film Board of Canada. The tour embittered Cohen, though, as he complained about money and the lack of exposure for his first novel. He found himself torn on the issue of Quebec separation that had arisen as the Quiet Revolution heated up. Montreal&#x27;s francophone community was asserting itself against the anglophone elite. The Front de Libération du Québec had begun targeting anglophones with bombs in 1963, and a statue of Queen Victoria on Sherbrooke Street was destroyed with a bomb on 12 July. This political turmoil found its way into Cohen&#x27;s work when he returned to Hydra.

Cohen practised fasting during the composition of the novel, believing that it helped focus his creativity and spirituality. Following its completion, Cohen broke down, collapsing from sunstroke and amphetamine consumption. He had hallucinations, and had withered to 116 pounds after going without food for ten days.

Cohen published another book of poetry, &quot;Parasites of Heaven&quot;, in 1966, but by then it became clear to Cohen that he would be unable to make a living as a writer. He shifted focus to music, particularly after becoming interested in Bob Dylan in 1966. That year, he decided to devote himself seriously to a singing career. It was his music for which he later became well known.

==Publication history==

In March 1965, Cohen told Jack McClelland, president of Canadian publishing house McClelland and Stewart, that he would finish the novel in a month. He stated that it would be a success if it escaped the censors, and asked for a cash advance, as he was in need of money. When he completed it three weeks later, he declared that he had &quot;written the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; of 1965&quot;. He claimed he had figured out how to &quot;write a novel in three weeks&quot;, and that he would manage four more in 1965.

Cohen pondered a number of titles for the book. On two different drafts were the titles &quot;Beautiful Losers / A Pop Novel&quot; and &quot;Plastic Birchbark / A Treatment of the World&quot;, and notes and letters show him listing many other possible titles. Viking put the difficult book through eight readings before deciding to publish it. Cohen responded to the book&#x27;s acceptance with a parodic six-page letter anticipating the response of offended Canadian critics. As a condition of the book&#x27;s publication, Cohen insisted on having control over the cover and jacket copy, so as to avoid the disappointment he had had with the publication of &quot;Flowers for Hitler&quot;. Further, he insisted on no quotations from critics on the jacket.

Publication was somewhat complicated when Cohen lost a carbon copy of the original manuscript to the wind. He was able to continue with revisions after having his New York agent send him another carbon copy. The pre-publication orders of 3,100 copies were more than expected. Before publication, a number of film producers were eyeing the book, such as Otto Preminger, Ulu Grosbard, Alexander Cohen and the MCA Group.

McClelland realized that censorship would be a problem in Canada, and tried to soften the blow with advance publicity via advance copies. The responses from the readers of the advance copies were too negative for him to use, however. A gala lunch was thrown a month in advance of the book&#x27;s release, and about four hundred of the top names in the Canadian arts world appeared there. Posters had Cohen in a turtleneck and jacket in the hopes that such a sober pose would offset the anticipated scandal. The University of Toronto, which had started collecting Cohen&#x27;s papers starting in 1964, paid Cohen $6,000 for the original manuscript.

The first printing was printed by Viking and bound by McClelland &amp; Stewart. It included typographical extras not included in future editions, such as comic book captions, a Charles Axis advertisement, a radio transcript of Gavin and the Goddesses, and a Greek-English phrase book. The book was officially published on 28 April 1966.

Distribution was restricted, with Simpson&#x27;s and W. H. Smith refusing to carry the book, despite McClelland&#x27;s reassurances to W. H. Smith that &quot;most of the people interested in pornography would not begin to understand either Cohen&#x27;s purpose or his accomplishment&quot;. The $6.50 cover price dampened sales as well. Cohen thought it too high, but McClelland explained it was necessary to offset the publication costs and extensive promotion. He accused Cohen of being &quot;unwilling to put [him]self out&quot; in the way of promotion, and urged him to do more television and radio interviews.

==Sources and influences==
Cohen made use of a number of texts when researching and writing &quot;Beautiful Losers&quot;:
* &quot;Une vierge iroquoise: Catherine Tekakwitha, le lis de bors de la Mohawk et du St. Laurent (1656–1680)&quot; by P. Edouard Lecompte
* &quot;Kateri of the Mohawks&quot; by Marie Cecilia Buehrle
* &quot;Jesuits in North America&quot;
* a 1943 issue of the American comic book &quot;Blue Beetle&quot;
* a farmer&#x27;s almanac
* &quot;Twilight of the Idols&quot; by Friedrich Nietzsche
* &quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot;, 1855 poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow

He also read Emanuel Swedenborg extensively: the first two volumes of &quot;Arcana Cœlestia&quot;, &quot;Divine Providence&quot; and &quot;Divine Love and Wisdom&quot;. He would meet with other writers at the Hydra colony to discuss works such as the &quot;Book of Revelation&quot;, the &quot;I Ching&quot;, &quot;The Secret of the Golden Flower&quot; and &quot;The Tibetan Book of the Dead&quot;. Cohen brought works by Martin Buber and Gershom Sholem to these meetings.

==Style==

&quot;Beautiful Losers&quot; is not written in a linear, coherent fashion. Key scenes repeat themselves, and there is no timeline the reader can follow.

==Reception==
Initial sales were poor. It sold better in the US than in Canada, but did not see significant sales until after Cohen achieved success as a singer-songwriter. The novel attracted the attention of critics, and was met with much controversy. Critic Robert Fulford called &quot;Beautiful Losers&quot; &quot;the most revolting book ever written in Canada&quot;, while also stating it was &quot;an important failure. At the same time it is probably the most interesting Canadian book of the year&quot;. He reported a few days later that a Toronto bookstore had not managed to sell any of the twenty-five copies it stocked eight days after publication.

Critics were less shocked by the breaking of taboos than the general public was. Instead, they objected to the novel&#x27;s complexity of allusion and representation, and the demands it put on the reader due to its incoherence and indeterminacy. It would take another generation of postmodern Canadian literature before &quot;Beautiful Losers&quot; would breach the canon.

In 1966, the CBC called &quot;Beautiful Losers&quot; &quot;one of the most radical and extraordinary works of fiction ever published in Canada&quot;, and quoted a critic from the Boston Globe who positively compared the work with the fiction of James Joyce. However, they also quoted from the previously mentioned negative review from the critic Robert Fulford.

In 1967, Desmond Pacey called &quot;Beautiful Losers&quot; &quot;the most intricate, erudite and fascinating Canadian novel ever written&quot;. In his 1970 monograph on Cohen, Michael Ondaatje called it &quot;the most vivid, fascinating and brave modern novel&quot; he had read.

&quot;Beautiful Losers&quot; had been translated into eleven languages by 1990, and the sales of both of Cohen&#x27;s novels have surpassed a million copies; &quot;Beautiful Losers&quot; had topped three million in sales by 2007.

==Legacy==

&quot;Beautiful Losers&quot; has entered the canon of Canadian literature, and has been given much credit for having introduced postmodern literature to Canadian fiction.

The poem beginning &quot;God is alive. Magic is afoot&quot; was arranged as a song by Buffy Sainte-Marie and first recorded on her 1969 album &quot;Illuminations&quot;; the song was covered by Chris Thile on his 2021 album &quot;Laysongs.&quot;

&quot;Beautiful Losers&quot; was the inspiration for the song &quot;Let&#x27;s Be Other People&quot; by the English band The Wonderstuff on their album &quot;Hup&quot;. 

An excerpt from &quot;Beautiful Losers&quot; appears in The Young Ones (TV series) associated book &quot;Neil&#x27;s Book Of The Dead&quot;, making up almost all of chapter 6.

<doc id="1265942" wikidata="Q3815113" url="?curid=1265942" title="RAPTOR">
<text>RAPTOR (Reconnaissance Airborne Pod Tornado) was a reconnaissance pod used by the Royal Air Force on its fleet of Tornado GR.4A and GR.4 aircraft. RAPTOR was manufactured by the Goodrich Corporation, initially part of UTC Aerospace Systems, but now part of Collins Aerospace.

The RAPTOR contained a DB-110 reconnaissance sensor, an imagery data recording system and an air-to-ground data link system. The sensor is electro-optical and infrared, allowing day or night missions. The data link allows imagery to be exploited almost instantly.

== DB-110 ==
DB-110 (&#x27;dual-band 110-inch focal length&#x27;) was developed as an exportable derivative of the U-2&#x27;s &quot;Senior Year&quot; Electro-Optical Reconnaissance System (SYERS-2). It represents a shift for airborne tactical reconnaissance systems from visible light, daylight-only film-based systems to dual-band day and night digital imaging with real-time downlinking. The DB-110 remains the only comparable LOROP (Long-Range Oblique Photography) pod to have been demonstrated in use on tactical aircraft.

DB-110 installations, such as RAPTOR, also include a reconnaissance mission planning system (RMPS). Planned missions produce route cards for a pilot&#x27;s kneeboard, are downloaded to route planning systems on either the recon aircraft or AWACS aircraft and are placed on a PCMCIA card that is used to load the pod itself with sensor tasking information.

== RAF use ==

No. II (AC) Sqn and 13 Sqn were the RAF&#x27;s two specialist Tornado reconnaissance units, but with the RAPTOR pod any GR4 squadron could undertake reconnaissance missions. The RAF procured eight RAPTOR units and two ground stations. RAPTOR achieved its operational debut during Operation Telic, the UK contribution to the 2003 Iraq War.

== Other users ==
RAPTOR was also used on Japanese OP-3C maritime reconnaissance aircraft. DB-110 pods have also been supplied for Polish F-16s in 2006 and Turkish F-16s in 2013. Saudi Arabia in 2012 became the tenth country to use the DB-110 and the first for F-15 carriage.

<text>Rockbound is a novel published in 1928 by Canadian writer Frank Parker Day.

==Overview==

The &quot;Rockbound&quot; mentioned in the title is name of small fictitious island inspired by East Ironbound, a remote island near Big Tancook Island off the coast of Nova Scotia. Surrounded by rich but dangerous fishing grounds, Rockbound is isolated by storms, fog and winter weather. Two feuding families, the Jungs and the Krauses are dominated by the &quot;king of Rockbound&quot;, the sternly righteous and rapacious Uriah Jung. When the young David Jung arrives on Rockbound to claim his inheritance, a small share of the island, he is forced to confront an unforgiving, and controlled world. His conflicts—both internal and external—lock him in a struggle for survival.

His enemies are many: sometimes the ocean, sometimes his own rude behaviour, sometimes his own best friend, sometimes his secret love for the island teacher, but always his relatives and their ambitions for money and power.

&quot;Rockbound&quot; paints a portrait of hard toil, cunning bitterness and family strife in the years leading to World War I. The novel evokes the infinite power, the terror and the cruel beauty of the Atlantic Ocean including the terrifying sinking of a fishing schooner based on the loss of the schooner &quot;Sylvia Mosher&quot; on August 9, 1926, during the 1926 August Gales at Sable Island.

==Inspiration==

&quot;Rockbound&quot; was based on the island of East Ironbound, Nova Scotia. Day spent the summer of 1926 on East Ironbound telling the families who welcomed him and shared their stories that he was working on a book about William Shakespeare. East Ironbound became a thinly disguised Rockbound while Tancook became the novel&#x27;s Outpost Island; Lunenburg became Liscomb; and Pearl Island became Barren Island. East Ironbound&#x27;s two main families the Fincks and the Youngs inspired Rockbound&#x27;s rival families the Krauses and the Jungs. Day&#x27;s interpretation, distortion and exaggeration of community and personal lives on East Ironbound offended the residents of the island who felt betrayed. They published a letter in the Lunenburg and Halifax papers accusing Day of exploiting them for money.

==Cultural impact==

&quot;Rockbound&quot; was one of the selected novels in the 2005 edition of &quot;Canada Reads&quot;, where it was championed by Donna Morrissey. &quot;Rockbound&quot; eventually won the competition.

&quot;Rockbound&quot; was adapted as a musical by Allen Cole, commissioned by Two Planks and a Passion Theatre Company in Nova Scotia and presented at the Ross Creek Centre in July 2009.

&quot;Rockbound&quot; was first adapted as a full-length musical in 1998 by Whistling Fish Productions based in Mahone Bay, NS. The musical, which was publicly workshopped in Halifax, at Dalhousie University, was arranged by musician, Skip Beckwith, and featured songs and lyrics by Geoff Noble, with book by Susan Shillingford. The local cast of performers including noted actors Zach Fraser, Marguerite McNeil, and Elizabeth Richardson. Two stage productions ensued - -at the historical Capitol Theatre in Nelson, BC (2001), and the Mary Winspear Centre in Sidney, BC (2003).

<doc id="1265955" wikidata="Q7044077" url="?curid=1265955" title="No Crystal Stair">
<text>No Crystal Stair is a 1997 novel by Canadian author Mairuth Sarsfield. It is a coming-of-age story set in the Little Burgundy district of Montreal during the 1940s.

The title is a reference to the line &quot;Life for me ain&#x27;t been no crystal stair&quot; in Langston Hughes&#x27;s poem &quot;Mother to Son&quot;.

==Plot summary==
Widow Marion Willow works at two jobs to raise her three daughters properly. Fighting racism and sexism, Marion schools her girls in manners, English poetry and the need for an education; her elegant neighbour and rival (both women are in love with railway porter Edmund Thompson) teaches the children the ways of the street and their black cultural heritage.

==Major themes==
Two themes in the novel run through &quot;No Crystal Stair&quot;: passing as white and surviving as black. Sarsfield recounts a story about the desire to survive, all the while depicting the cosmopolitan Montreal of the 1940s, a city inhabited by jazz musicians, socialites, artists and gangsters.

== Reception ==
&quot;No Crystal Stair&quot; was one of the selected novels in the 2005 edition of &quot;Canada Reads&quot;, where it was defended by Olympic fencer Sherraine MacKay.

The book received reviews from publications including &quot;Herizons&quot;, &quot;School Library Journal&quot;, &quot;Quill &amp; Quire&quot;, and &quot;New York Amsterdam News&quot;.

The book was the subject of articles in the journals &quot;Canadian Review of American Studies&quot; and &quot;Essays on Canadian Writing.&quot;

<text>Volkswagen Blues is a French-language road novel by French-Canadian writer Jacques Poulin, his sixth, originally published by Québec-Amérique in 1984.

Inspired by the writings of Jack Kerouac and the Beat Generation poets, some of whom appear in the book&#x27;s later chapters, the novel explores the American landscape and cultural history from the vantage point of the open road, using writers, historical figures, popular music and art as tropes to orient the reader and tell the story of America. 

==Plot==
&quot;Volkswagen Blues&quot; begins with its protagonist, a middle-aged, formerly successful writer from Quebec, who has adopted the ironic pen-name Jack Waterman (a metonymy playing on Waterman pens), experiencing a bout of writer&#x27;s block. Having discovered an old postcard, Jack embarks on a quest to reconnect with its sender, his long-lost, rambling brother, Théo. Early into the narrative, Jack picks up a hitchhiker, a young Métisse woman, nicknamed &quot;La Grande Sauterelle&quot; due her long, grasshopper-like legs, as a travel companion, as well as a cat named Chop Suey.

Together in Jack&#x27;s Volkswagen Minibus, which through personification becomes a character in the story, they travel from Gaspé to San Francisco, passing through Toronto, Detroit, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City and the American West along their way, exploring the history of European contact with the native people of the Americas. While on the road, they discuss language, literature, music, expansionism, the Oregon Trail, etc., and their trip becomes an allegory for the history of the French exploration of North America. At the same time, La Grande Sauterelle, who is struggling with her own identity, presents another version of American history, as recounted by indigenous peoples, where &quot;discovery&quot; is viewed as &quot;invasion.&quot; Throughout the episodic novel a number of interesting and entertaining characters appear, including journalists, museum directors, railroad hoboes and writers such as Saul Bellow and Lawrence Ferlinghetti, as well as the spirit of Jimmie Rodgers, Ernest Hemingway, John Muir and the Beat Generation.

Jack&#x27;s journey through an America that scholar Paul Socken describes as a &quot;lost paradise&quot; is one of disillusionment and self-discovery that allows him to break through the impasse he had met in his writing.

==Reception==
&quot;Volkswagen Blues&quot; was nominated for the Governor General&#x27;s Award for French-language fiction at the 1984 Governor General&#x27;s Awards and was one of the selected novels in the 2005 edition of &quot;Canada Reads&quot;, where it was championed by author and former National Librarian of Canada, Roch Carrier.

&quot;Volkswagen Blues&quot; was individually cited when Jacques Poulin was awarded the Prix Gilles-Corbeil (informally known as the &quot;Nobel québécois&quot;).

==Translations==
&quot;Volkswagen Blues&quot; was translated into English by Sheila Fischman and published by McClelland &amp; Stewart in 1988 and subsequently re-issued by Cormorant Books in 2002.

<text>John Rodker (18 December 1894 – 6 October 1955) was an English writer, modernist poet, and publisher of modernist writers.

==Biography==
John Rodker was born on 18 December 1894 in Manchester, into a Jewish immigrant family. The family moved to London while he was still young.

As a young man, he was one of the so-called &quot;Whitechapel Boys&quot;, a group including Isaac Rosenberg, Mark Gertler, David Bomberg, Samuel Weinstein and Joseph Lefkowitz (who coined the name in hindsight). From about 1911, when Rosenberg arrived, they began to aspire to literary careers; and in the years before 1914 Rodker was a published essayist and poet, in &quot;The New Age&quot; of A. R. Orage and elsewhere. Other &quot;Whitechapel Boys&quot; were the painters David Bomberg and Mark Gertler; they all met together at or near the Whitechapel Art Gallery.

During World War I, Rodker was a conscientious objector. He went on the run, sheltering with the poet R. C. Trevelyan, before being arrested in April 1917, imprisoned, and then transferred to the Home Office Work Centre, Princetown, in the former Dartmoor Prison. He describes this in his book &quot;Memoirs of Other Fronts.&quot;

In 1919 Rodker started the Ovid Press, a small press which lasted about a year. It published T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound (the first edition of &quot;Hugh Selwyn Mauberley&quot;) and portfolios of drawings by Wyndham Lewis, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska and Edward Wadsworth. In the opinion of one modern scholar, &quot;the Ovid Press remains his most significant contribution for the originality of the titles he chose and for the place the imprint maintains alongside other private presses of the period.&quot;

That same year, Rodker took over from Pound as foreign editor of the New York magazine, &quot;The Little Review&quot;.

In the 1920s he spent time in Paris on the second edition of James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;, at that time subject to censorship, and on French translations of Joyce. He then set up the Casanova Society, for limited editions. He continued in publishing, on occult subjects under the imprint &quot;J. Rodker&quot; also, until a bankruptcy in 1932, when (along with other such ventures such as the Fanfrolico Press) his business folded in the Depression. He was included in the 1930 Faber and Faber collection &quot;Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress&quot; of Joyceans.

For a period he dropped publishing, concentrating on translation from French literature, and agency work for Preslit, the Soviet overseas literature organ. At this time too he apparently abandoned literary ambitions for himself. In 1937, the centennial of the death of Aleksandr Pushkin, he set up the Pushkin Press, another small press, publishing Oliver Elton&#x27;s English version of &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot; and a trickle of other books.

The Imago Publishing Company was a separate, more substantial venture, set up after Sigmund Freud arrived in London in 1938. The stocks of Freud&#x27;s works left when he fled Vienna and the Nazis had been destroyed; Rodker with Anna Freud worked to publish a complete edition. This was done over a dozen years, being finished in 1952. Imago was wound up in 1961.

Rodker was fluent in French, writing regularly for a French literary magazine, and was posthumously awarded the Légion d&#x27;Honneur by the government of France.

==Personal life==
John Rodker&#x27;s father, David, joined the mass exodus of Jews from what is now Poland to escape the pogroms of the 1880s, moving to England, where, like a number of his family members, he worked as a corset-maker. As far as we know, all the Rodkers in the world are related – the name seems to have been invented for (or by) just this one family. This surname appears to be a toponymic surname based on the town of Rodka, now in Romania and renamed to Rădăuți. David married Leah Jacobson; their children were John and Peter.

John&#x27;s younger brother Peter, who used the surname Roker (without the &quot;d&quot;), served for five years during World War I and married Helen Scott. He was institutionalized for mental illness from 1934 until his death in 1973.

John Rodker married three times. He and his first wife, the writer Mary Butts (1890–1937), married in May 1918. He already had a daughter, Joan (1915–2010), from an earlier relationship with the dancer, Sonia Cohen (1885–1979). His daughter by Mary Butts was Camilla (1920–2007), who married Henry Israel.

The second marriage was to Barbara McKenzie-Smith (1902–1996), a painter, resulting in a son, John Paul (born in 1937), whose surname was changed to Morrison when his mother, after their divorce, married E.A. Morrison III. Moura Budberg was John Paul&#x27;s godmother.

The third marriage was to Marianne Rais (died 1984), a Paris bookseller and daughter of his translator Ludmila Savitzky.

Joan Rodker&#x27;s son, Ernest Rodker (born 1937), by the actor Gerard Heinz, was a post-World War II conscientious objector, a founder member of the Committee of 100 and serves as the British spokesperson for Mordechai Vanunu and became a founding member of the Battersea Power Station Community Group.

<text>Pushkin Press is a British-based publishing house dedicated to publishing novels, essays, memoirs and children&#x27;s books. The London-based company was founded in 1997 and is notable for publishing authors such as Stefan Zweig, Marcel Aymé, Antal Szerb, Paul Morand and Yasushi Inoue, as well as award-winning contemporary writers, including Andrés Neuman, Edith Pearlman, Ayelet Gundar-Goshen, Eka Kurniawan and Ryu Murakami.

== History ==
Pushkin Press was founded in 1997 by Melissa Ulfane whose ambition was to bring literature in translation to the UK. It is notable for rediscovering less known European classics of the twentieth century and is largely responsible for reigniting worldwide interest into authors such as Stefan Zweig and Antal Szerb.

In 2012, Pushkin Press was bought by Adam Freudenheim, then Penguin Classics publisher, and Stephanie Seegmuller, a former Penguin senior business development manager. Seegmuller left Pushkin in March 2015.

In 2013, Pushkin Press created Pushkin Children&#x27;s Books, an imprint dedicated to publishing tales for younger readers. In its first year, Pushkin Children&#x27;s Books published English translations of the French children&#x27;s series Oksa Pollock by Anne Plichota and Cendrine Wolf, the first of which, &quot;The Last Hope&quot;, was the company&#x27;s bestselling title in 2014. Dutch Classic &quot;The Letter for the King&quot; by Tonke Dragt, translated into English by Laura Watkinson, has been the company&#x27;s most successful children&#x27;s book.

Also in Autumn 2013, Pushkin Press created ONE, an imprint focused on literary debuts that publishes one exceptional fiction or non-fiction title a season. All titles published under the ONE imprint were initially commissioned and edited by Elena Lappin. Lappin left Pushkin in 2017, but the ONE imprint continues with the focus on contemporary English-language originals.

In 2014, Pushkin Press published Anthea Bell&#x27;s faithful English translation of Erich Kästner&#x27;s 1949 German children&#x27;s novel &quot;The Parent Trap&quot;, the basis for Disney&#x27;s 1961 film adaptation of the same name starring Hayley Mills and its 1998 remake starring Lindsay Lohan. Then in 2020, Australian actress Ruby Rees recorded an unabridged narration of Bell&#x27;s translation for Bolinda.

In September 2015, they launched Pushkin Vertigo, a foreign crime imprint, publishing crime novels translated into English from around the world, notably focusing on Japan and France. In 2024 it won the CWA Dagger for Best Crime and Mystery Publisher.

<text>The Swedish Linnaeus Society (Swedish &quot;Svenska Linnésällskapet&quot;) is a Swedish learned society devoted to the study of the 18th century naturalist Carl Linnaeus. It was founded at a meeting taking place at Hammarby, the country house of Linnaeus outside Uppsala, on May 23, 1917, the 210th birthday of Carl Linnaeus. In 1918 it took over the old botanical garden in Uppsala, Linnaean Garden, and from 1918 until 1923 restored it according to Linnaeus&#x27; own plans and specifications in his published work &quot;Hortus Upsaliensis&quot; from 1745. The care for the garden was taken over by Uppsala University in 1977. The society still runs the Linnaeus Museum in the 17th-century house adjacent to the garden, where Linnaeus once lived.

The yearbook of the society, &quot;Svenska Linnésällskapets Årsskrift&quot;, has been published since 1918. In addition, it has republished some of Linnaeus&#x27;s own publications. In cooperation with, among others, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, Uppsala University and the Linnean Society of London, the society is involved in the digital publication of the correspondence of Linnaeus.

<doc id="1265996" wikidata="Q3247390" url="?curid=1265996" title="List of townships in Prince Edward Island">
<text>This is a list of townships, known as &quot;lots&quot;, for the Canadian province of Prince Edward Island, some of which also act as Prince Edward Island&#x27;s census subdivisions.

==History==
After being ceded the island in the Treaty of Paris in 1763, Great Britain immediately sought to bring its own settlers to occupy the vacated Acadian holdings. In 1764, Great Britain ordered a survey of what was then called St. John&#x27;s Island which was completed in 1766. As with other surveys of Britain&#x27;s North American territories, the survey of St. John&#x27;s Island was done with the primary goal of encouraging settlement at minimal cost to the treasury. A feudal system was proposed, along the lines of the European experience with lease-tenure.

Three counties of roughly 500,000 acres (2,000 km2): Prince, Queens, and Kings; were surveyed (Kings County being the smallest), each of which had a &quot;royalty&quot; or shire town. Each county was subdivided into five 100,000 acre (400 km2) parishes (for the Church of England) - Kings County having four parishes on account of its smaller size - and each parish was further subdivided into roughly 20,000 acre (80 km2) townships or &quot;lots&quot;. Each township/lot were to be granted to individuals with certain conditions of settlement (i.e. personally finance and transport settlers to the island; settlers would be obliged to clear land for their farms and pay annual quitrents which, over time would pay off the initial outlay of the owner and eventually turn a profit). Since more individuals were interested than there were lots available, the government of Great Britain devised a lottery for the sixty four (of sixty seven) lots being granted.

St. John&#x27;s Island was renamed to Prince Edward Island on November 29, 1798. After a contentious century of conflict between property owners/landlords (many of whom were absentee) and the largely poor peasant leaseholders, the last of the property owners was bought out in the 19th century after financing was made available to the Government of Prince Edward Island expressly for buying out the landlords under Prince Edward Island&#x27;s &quot;Terms of Union&quot; for entry into Confederation on July 1, 1873.

For further information, see &quot;A Brief Summary of the History of Prince Edward Island&quot; - taken from &quot;Hutchinson&#x27;s Prince Edward Island Directory, 1864&quot;.

Today, the townships/lots continue to exist on paper and in maps as Prince Edward Island&#x27;s census subdivisions.</text><links>

<doc id="1265998" wikidata="Q1101336" url="?curid=1265998" title="Clifford Olson">
<text>Clifford Robert Olson Jr. (January 1, 1940 – September 30, 2011) was a Canadian convicted serial killer who confessed to murdering 11 children, aged between 9 and 18, in the early 1980s.

In 1976, Olson was serving a sentence for his crimes as a con artist. He had obtained favourable terms for himself by acting as an informant against a cellmate, even coaxing him into a written confession. However, Olson said it was discussions with his cellmate that led to his sexual interest in children and murderous intents.

== Murders ==
Christine Weller, 12, from Surrey, British Columbia, was abducted on November 17, 1980. Her body was found more than a month later on Christmas Day; she had been strangled with a belt and stabbed repeatedly. On April 16, 1981, Colleen Marian Daignault, 13, vanished. Five months later her body was found. On April 22, 1981, Daryn Todd Johnsrude, 16, was abducted and killed; his body was found less than two weeks later. On May 19, 1981, 16-year-old Sandra Wolfsteiner was kidnapped and murdered, and 13-year-old Ada Anita Court was murdered in June 1981.

Six victims followed in quick succession in July 1981. Simon Partington, nine, was abducted, raped and strangled on July 2, 1981. Judy Kozma, a 14-year-old from New Westminster, was raped and strangled a week later. Her body was discovered on July 25 near Weaver Lake. The next victims were Raymond King II, 15, abducted on July 23, raped and bludgeoned to death; Sigrun Arnd, an 18-year-old German tourist, raped and bludgeoned two days later; Terri Lyn Carson, 15, raped and strangled on July 27; and Louise Chartrand, age 17, the last victim identified, who died on July 30.

== Arrest and plea bargain ==
Olson, who had an extensive criminal history, was arrested on August 12, 1981, on suspicion of attempting to abduct two girls. By August 25, Olson had been charged with the murder of Judy Kozma. He reached a controversial deal with authorities, agreeing to confess to the 11 murders and show the RCMP the location of the bodies of those not yet recovered. In return, authorities agreed that C$10,000 for each victim was paid into a trust for his wife and then-infant. His wife received C$100,000 after Olson cooperated with the RCMP, the 11th body being a &quot;freebie&quot;. In January 1982, Olson pleaded guilty to 11 counts of murder and was given as many concurrent life sentences to be served in Canada&#x27;s super-maximum security Special Handling Unit in Sainte-Anne-des-Plaines, Quebec, which houses many of the country&#x27;s most dangerous criminals.

Olson scored 38/40 on the Psychopathy Checklist according to forensic psychiatrist Stanley Semrau, who interviewed Olson at length in prison.

In 1983 Gordon Taylor introduced a private member&#x27;s bill in the House of Commons of Canada mandating Olson&#x27;s execution, notwithstanding his 1982 sentence and Canada&#x27;s 1976 abolition of capital punishment for murder. Numerous petitions supporting the bill were laid before the house, before it was ruled out of order in 1984 as a bill of attainder.

==Parole application==
At his sentencing January 14, 1982, Justice McKay, the trial judge remarked, &quot;My considered opinion is that you should never be granted parole for the remainder of your days. It would be foolhardy to let you at large.&quot;

In 1997, Olson was denied parole, for which he applied under Canada&#x27;s &quot;faint hope clause&quot;, which allowed a parole hearing for convicts who had served at least 15 years.

Canadian law allows inmates convicted of first-degree murder to apply for parole after serving a minimum of 25 years. Olson&#x27;s second parole hearing, on July 18, 2006, was also denied. Olson made many bizarre and false claims, including that the United States had granted him clemency for providing information about the September 11 attacks and that the hearing had no jurisdiction over him because of that. Under Canadian law, Olson was then entitled to make a case for parole every two years.

Olson was again refused parole in November 2010.

== Old age security pension controversy ==
Controversy developed in March 2010 when the media disclosed that Olson was receiving two federal government benefits from Canada while imprisoned, a total of C$1,169.47 monthly. Olson was eligible to receive the Canadian Old Age Security (OAS) pension. All persons who meet residency requirements as to length of time in Canada are eligible to receive this pension at age 65, and Olson turned 70 on January 1, 2010. Olson was also eligible to receive the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS), awarded to pensioners with low income. The money in question was being held in trust for Olson.

The Canadian Taxpayers Federation testified before the federal standing committee for Human Resources Development to have MPs pass Bill C-31, which would terminate pension benefits for prisoners. The organization also presented the government with 46,000 petition signatures requesting that Olson no longer receive the benefits. Prime Minister Stephen Harper asked government officials to look into the issue; on June 1, 2010, the government moved to terminate Olson&#x27;s payments, calling the fact that he had been receiving them &quot;outrageous&quot; and &quot;offensive&quot;. In September 2010, Olson sent one of his Old Age Security cheques to a Sun Media reporter, Peter Worthington, with a note asking him to forward the cheque to Harper&#x27;s campaign for re-election.

==Illness and death==
In September 2011, media reports indicated that Olson had terminal cancer and had been transferred to a hospital in Laval, Quebec. He died on September 30, 2011, at the age of 71.

==In the media==
* &quot;The Investigation&quot;, a TV movie, was made in 2002, focusing on allegations that Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) bureaucracy delayed the arrest of Olson. It starred Nicholas Lea, Reece Dinsdale, David Warner and Lochlyn Munro.
* Olson&#x27;s controversial plea bargain is referred to in a panel discussion at a serial killers&#x27; convention in the second volume of Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;Sandman&quot; series.
* &quot;Where Shadows Linger: the Untold Story of the RCMP&#x27;s Olson Murders Investigation&quot;, by former Vancouver police officer William Leslie Holmes and Bruce L. Northorp, the RCMP officer who arrested Olson, was published in 2000 by Heritage House Publishing.

<text>Alex Krycek is a fictional character in the Fox science fiction-supernatural television series &quot;The X-Files&quot;. Alex Krycek is played by Nicholas Lea. He is initially introduced in the second season as a partner for FBI Special Agent Fox Mulder in the absence of his previous partner, Dana Scully. As the show progressed, Krycek grew to become one of the show&#x27;s primary antagonists, appearing subsequently in every season until Season 9. Krycek&#x27;s machinations frequently pitted him against Mulder, with whom he shared a complicated relationship. He was variously seen as either a henchman or enemy of the show&#x27;s primary antagonist, The Smoking Man, changing his allegiance when the situation suited him best.

== Character arc ==
Krycek is a Russian-American, the son of Cold War immigrants, who makes his first appearance in the season two episode &quot;Sleepless&quot;, where as a young FBI Special Agent, he is assigned as a temporary investigation partner to Fox Mulder. Krycek proceeds to work with Mulder and attempts to gain his trust.

It later becomes evident, however, that Krycek is actually an undercover agent working for the Smoking Man. Krycek plays an important part in several events that are harmful to Mulder and Dana Scully: he assists in Scully&#x27;s abduction, and murders Mulder&#x27;s father, William &quot;Bill&quot; Mulder. Krycek also assaults Assistant Director Walter Skinner and acquires a secret tape from him which reveals a US government coverup regarding alien visits to Earth. After a botched attempt on Scully results in the death of her sister, the Cigarette Smoking Man attempts to kill Krycek with a car bomb, but Krycek escapes. Krycek is later found to have been selling the secrets from the encrypted MJ files. Under the influence of the black oil, Krycek returns the tape to the Smoking Man, in return for knowledge of the location of an alien ship. The black oil-controlled Krycek goes to the ship, which has been moved to an abandoned missile silo in North Dakota. The black oil extracts itself from Krycek, leaving him locked indefinitely in the silo with the ship.

Krycek is next found during an FBI raid, and taken into custody by Mulder and Scully. They learn that Krycek was recruited by an extremist militia group on a salvage hunt from the silo in North Dakota, and he informs the agents they must track the source of an extraterrestrial rock, brought to America by a foreign diplomat, to a gulag in Russia. The hunt leads Krycek and Mulder to Tunguska, where they are held captive until Krycek maneuvers his own release. Mulder attempts his own escape, taking an unconscious Krycek with him. When he awakes, Krycek separates into the woods only to encounter a strange group of Russians, all of whom have missing left arms. The men amputate Krycek&#x27;s arm as well, to keep him from being used in black oil experiments. Eventually, Krycek graduates into a more powerful role within this group. He uses any knowledge he has to gain leverage with the syndicate. He even has had romantic ties to their secretary, Marita Covarrubias (who apparently was using Krycek for her own means in assisting Mulder). Due to this double-crossing, Krycek is temporarily held captive by the Well Manicured Man. Krycek later appears to Mulder as a friendly messenger to tell him that a war has begun, and that Mulder must &quot;resist or serve&quot;.

Later in the series, Krycek can be seen switching sides as it suits him, occasionally helping Mulder, the Cigarette Smoking Man and other people. He attempted to blackmail Skinner with infectious nanotechnology, but ended up being thrown into a Tunisian prison by the Cigarette Smoking Man. In the season seven finale, &quot;Requiem&quot;, Krycek apparently kills the now wheelchair-using Cigarette Smoking Man by pushing him down a flight of stairs. Later, when Mulder was abducted by aliens and returned in a deathlike state, Krycek attempts to again blackmail Skinner, offering the means to save Mulder&#x27;s life in exchange for Scully&#x27;s baby. Skinner refuses, and Krycek has a violent confrontation with John Doggett before escaping. In the season eight finale, &quot;Existence&quot;, Krycek is shot dead by Skinner, during an unsuccessful attempt to kill Mulder. Krycek&#x27;s ghost briefly showed up to help Mulder escape a military base in the series finale.

== Conceptual history ==
Originally, the role of Krycek was offered to Callum Keith Rennie, who rejected it, but later made two guest appearances on the show. Krycek does not appear in the first season, but Nicholas Lea did have a small part in the Monster-of-the-Week episode, &quot;Gender Bender&quot;. In the episode, he played a club goer named &quot;Michel&quot;. When Lea appeared as Krycek, the producers felt that they could kill him off if the portraying actor didn&#x27;t do a good enough job. Krycek, who was initially created by writer Howard Gordon to temporarily replace Scully as Mulder&#x27;s partner for three episodes, eventually grew into a character that lasted eight seasons on the show. The character appears in 22 episodes between seasons two and nine.

<text>In geology, a terrane (; in full, a tectonostratigraphic terrane) is a crust fragment formed on a tectonic plate (or broken off from it) and accreted or &quot;sutured&quot; to crust lying on another plate. The crustal block or fragment preserves its distinctive geologic history, which is different from the surrounding areas—hence the term &quot;exotic&quot; terrane. The suture zone between a terrane and the crust it attaches to is usually identifiable as a fault. A sedimentary deposit that buries the contact of the terrane with adjacent rock is called an overlap formation. An igneous intrusion that has intruded and obscured the contact of a terrane with adjacent rock is called a stitching pluton.

There is also an older usage of the term &quot;terrane&quot;, which described a series of related rock formations or an area with a preponderance of a particular rock or rock group.

==Overview==
A tectonostratigraphic terrane did not necessarily originate as an independent microplate, since it may not contain the full thickness of the lithosphere. It is a piece of crust that has been transported laterally, usually as part of a larger plate, and is relatively buoyant due to thickness or low density. When the plate of which it was a part subducted under another plate, the terrane failed to subduct, detached from its transporting plate, and accreted onto the overriding plate. Therefore, the terrane transferred from one plate to the other. Typically, accreting terranes are portions of continental crust which have rifted off another continental mass and been transported surrounded by oceanic crust, or they are old island arcs formed at some distant subduction zones.

A tectonostratigraphic terrane is a fault-bounded package of rocks of at least regional extent characterized by a geologic history that differs from that of neighboring terranes. The essential characteristic of these terranes is that the present spatial relations are incompatible with the inferred geologic histories. Where terranes that lie next to each other possess strata of the same age, they are considered separate terranes only if it can be demonstrated that the geologic evolutions are different and incompatible. There must be an absence of intermediate lithofacies that could link the strata.

The concept of &quot;tectonostratigraphic terrane &quot; developed from studies in the 1970s of the complicated Pacific Cordilleran orogenic margin of North America, a complex and diverse geological potpourri that was difficult to explain until the new science of plate tectonics illuminated the ability of crustal fragments to &quot;drift&quot; thousands of miles from their origin and attach themselves, crumpled, to an exotic shore. Such terranes were dubbed &quot;accreted terranes&quot; by geologists. Geologist J. N. Carney writes:

When terranes are composed of repeated accretionary events, and hence are composed of subunits with distinct history and structure, they may be called superterranes.

<text>Fore River Shipyard was a shipyard owned by General Dynamics Corporation located on Weymouth Fore River in Braintree and Quincy, Massachusetts. It began operations in 1883 in Braintree, and moved to its final location on Quincy Point in 1901. In 1913, it was purchased by Bethlehem Steel, and later transferred to Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation. It was sold to General Dynamics in 1963, and closed in 1986. During its operation, yardworkers constructed hundreds of ships, for both military and civilian clients.

Most of the ships at the yard were built for the United States Navy, with its first government contract for the destroyer . The yard also built early submarines for Electric Boat, including and . Fore River also constructed the battleship , and the cruisers and as well as the Navy&#x27;s first carrier and its successor . The light cruiser USS San Juan CL-54 was built there as well. Fore River produced multiple foreign ships for various navies around the world including five Type 1 submarines for the Imperial Japanese Navy, ten submarines for the Royal Navy, and the battleship , for the Argentine Navy.

The yard constructed several merchant marine ships, including &quot;Thomas W. Lawson&quot;, the largest pure sailing ship ever built, and , which was the first ship constructed to carry refrigerated chemicals. General Dynamics Quincy Shipbuilding Division, as it eventually came to be known, ended its career as a producer of various LNG tankers and merchant marine ships.

The yard would also construct a number of American flagged passenger liners, which included Matson Line&#x27;s SS &quot;Mariposa&quot;, SS &quot;Monterey&quot;, SS &quot;Lurline&quot;, along with American Export Lines SS &quot;Independence&quot; and SS &quot;Constitution&quot;.

According to one theory, the yard was the origin of the &quot;Kilroy was here&quot; pop culture reference, and was home to the second-largest shipbuilding crane in the world. During the period in which it was operable, the yard had two sub-yards: the first was the Victory Destroyer Plant in Quincy during World War I, and the second was the Bethlehem Hingham Shipyard in Hingham during World War II. In addition, the yard owned Bethlehem Atlantic Works, a drydock facility which was located in East Boston.

==History==
===Origins===
The shipyard traces its beginnings back to 1882, when Thomas A. Watson purchased a farm alongside the Fore River in East Braintree, Massachusetts. In 1884, Watson attempted to farm the land, but soon realizing that it was a failure, decided to work on a steam engine after he was approached by a local businessman. Work on the engine began in 1884, and continued into 1885, when it was deemed a financial failure. At this point, Watson decided to work with his business partner Frank O. Wellington on ship building, creating the Fore River Engine Company.

===Fore River Engine Company===
Following an order from Maine for a 50-horsepower engine, Thomas A. Watson and Frank O. Wellington decided to build boats, which came after realizing the profitability of the enterprise as the result of building their first ship, the &quot;Barnacle&quot;, which was fitted with local furnishings. Watson later said of this decision:
It was a momentous decision for from it came one of the largest shipbuilding establishments in the country, if not in the world, that made Massachusetts again a shipbuilding center and afterwards played an important part in the World War.
The success of this operation was further strengthened the fact that the shipyard was producing a quality engine, and it quickly gained a reputation along the eastern seaboard. Soon, a new engine-building facility was constructed, employing between twenty and thirty workers. Additionally, the Prouty Printing Press and Sims-Dudley dynamite gun, staple guns for shoes, and electric light accessories were produced by Fore River. In addition, the diversity of Fore River&#x27;s products was due to the fact that Watson desired to employ as many friends as possible.

The Panic of 1893 brought a new era to the company, as the depression limited the Fore River&#x27;s possibilities. Fortunately for Fore River, the United States Navy awarded a contract to them to construct and . These two ships were the last to be constructed at the East Braintree location, as the yard moved down the river to a site on nearby Quincy Point in 1901. The construction of United States lightship LV-72 alongside the destroyers further strengthened the company financially.

The awarding of was also beneficial for Fore River. Faced with the problem of not having a large enough area to build the cruiser, the contract was produced at the new Quincy yard. The Des Moines was launched in 1902 and commissioned in 1904, bringing with it some financial stability to the yard, as new revenues were quadruple those at the East Braintree location. During the construction of the new yard, old buildings were floated over to make up for the lack of buildings at the new location, and it was constructed with some of the largest shipbuilding equipment of the day.

===Fore River Ship and Engine Company===
The building of the new yard created ample space for building new ships, which allowed for the building of and . The Navy did mandate that before they could receive the bids, they would have to incorporate, so the company was incorporated in New Jersey, with a capital of $ (equivalent to $ in today&#x27;s dollars). Immediately, Thomas A. Watson realized that the contract would be more costly than anticipated, but soon an order came in for the seven-masted &quot;Thomas W. Lawson&quot;. This was immediately followed by an order for the six-masted &quot;William L. Douglas&quot;, which was delivered in 1903.

In 1902, Watson decided to build the Fore River Railroad, a short-line railroad from East Braintree to the yard, away. This was done in order to save costs of having to remove supplies from the trains, transport it over land to Weymouth Fore River, and then float it over to the yard. Watson ended up buying a parcel of land after the owner refused to sell him of land for the railroad.

During this time, the yard struggled financially, as expenses from suppliers exceeded reimbursement from the Navy. As a result, Watson decided to sell some of his telephone stock and secured a loan. At this time, the yard was awarded with a contract for , although this did not solve the company&#x27;s troubles. Following a failed attempt by Watson to seek reimbursement from the Navy, he eventually resigned and was replaced by former Admiral Francis T. Bowles, as he was pleased by how Bowles ran the yard.

In 1905, the yard gained a contract to build the Brown-Curtis steam turbine engine, which was considered to be too fast to be economical at the time. That same year, the Navy awarded a contract to build the Chester-class cruisers at the yard, two of which were supposed to be equipped with the Brown-Curtis turbine, but which later received new turbines.

The Russo-Japanese War further benefited the yard, as the Imperial Japanese Navy contracted five Type 1 submarines at the yard. Little is known of the first submarines built at the yard, although they were promptly disassembled and shipped to the West Coast, from which they were shipped to Japan in 1904. The war brought expanded submarine development to the yard, as the Holland Torpedo Boat Company was purchased by the Electric Boat Company. Since Electric Boat had no yard of its own, it subcontracted to Fore River in order to complete orders. The first American submarine built at the yard was , launched in 1906. This arrangement lasted for the next twenty years, until Electric Boat built its own yard in 1924. Fore River would remain the primary builder of Electric Boat-designed submarines through the S-class of 1922, completing a total of 69 submarines for the US Navy during this period.

During this time, the yard built civilian ships, including &quot;Sankaty&quot;, which was built for the New Bedford, Martha&#x27;s Vineyard &amp; Nantucket Steamboat Company. Furthermore, the company created the Fore River Apprentice School, in order to ensure that an adequately trained workforce would be able to work at the yard in the coming years. Over time, over 2,000 people were graduated from its program.

In 1906, and were delivered by the yard, marking the yard&#x27;s first battleships delivered. The completion of these two battleships and other ships at the yard coincided at a time when there were 2,500 people employed. In 1908, there were eighteen contracts employed at Fore River, which would not be met again until 1916. The yard also completed car floats for the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad during this time.

Of note, Fore River fielded a soccer team from at least 1907 to around 1920–1921. This team, which played in local leagues, was part of one of the early soccer leagues in the United States.

Another big development in the history of the yard was the receiving of the contract to build the for the Argentine Navy. The ship was one of two foreign battleships ever constructed in the United States, and occurred during the South American dreadnought race. After a long bidding process, the Argentine Naval Commission found that the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company bid was lowest on one battleship, and the Fore River Shipbuilding Company was lowest on the other. Despite some possible setbacks, the upcoming 1910 Pan-American Conference, and a guarantee of American participation in the Argentine centennial celebrations, Fore River secured the battleship contracts on 21 January 1910. The maximum price Fore River tendered, $10.7 million, underbid the British by more than $973,000, but their ship&#x27;s displacement was smaller, the belt armor was thinner, and the top speed was slightly slower.

&quot;Rivadavia&quot; was built by Fore River, but they were contractually obligated to subcontract the second ship to a different shipyard in the hope that both would be completed faster, so was constructed by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation of Camden, New Jersey. The steel for the ships was largely supplied by the Bethlehem Steel Company of Pennsylvania, which, due to their ability to produce steel at a lower price than other nations, was an integral cost-saving measure.
The ship was laid down in 1910, but was finally delivered in 1914 after delays in construction due to a work backlog at the yard. It was because of this issue that Admiral Bowles suggested that the yard be sold to a larger corporation, as it would be able to better deal with the extra workload than the yard could on its own. The last ship laid down in the yard at the time was , which occurred in 1912.

In 1911, the yard was part of the case Fore River Shipbuilding Co. v. Hagg, in which a foreign citizen sued for the yard for reparation in the death of her husband, who was killed in the yard&#x27;s forge shop. The case was later dismissed by the United States Supreme Court.

===Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, Ltd.===
In 1913, Bethlehem Steel Corporation purchased the yard for $ (equivalent to $ in today&#x27;s dollars), as Charles M. Schwab was looking to diversify the company. At the time, the yard was constructing 23 vessels and doing a business of $ (equivalent to $ in today&#x27;s dollars) a year. The yard was in size, and had a capacity for . At this time, Bethlehem decided to construct a drydock, although it would take into the 1920s to make this happen. Finally, immediate improvements were made to the yard to improve its financial well-being.

The first year of the company&#x27;s ownership brought little in terms of business. Two destroyers were ordered, three submarines were sublet in the yard, and no outside orders by private companies were received in this time. Furthermore, the Royal Navy placed an order during this time for ten submarines. Due to the fact that the United States was officially neutral during World War I, the yard prefabricated the submarines, and then shipped the parts to Canada for assembly. In 1915, the Spanish Navy contracted out the building of the submarine Isaac Peral (A-0) in the yard, while the United States Navy ordered . Finally, the Texas Oil Company and the Edward F. Luckenbach Company ordered four tankers and freighters, respectively.

====World War I====
War brought opportunities for expansion for the yard. This meant the building of a steel mill and a sheet metal shop that contained one of the best molds in the country. The steel mill was capable of prefabricating of steel a day. A building slip was also constructed, costing $ (equivalent to $ in today&#x27;s dollars). The yard created a department that was dedicated to the welfare of its workers during this time, as well.

1916 brought nineteen contracts to the yard, eight of which were for the O-class submarine, and ten more submarines were laid down for the Royal Navy, with another ten being built in Montreal at the Canadian Vickers yard. The submarines, once built, were stored at the nearby Boston Navy Yard until the country entered the war. Over 15,000 persons were working at the yard at the time, including Joseph P. Kennedy.

Entry of the United States into the war brought twenty-eight destroyer orders to the yard. Due to this sudden increase in production, the yard needed to expand. Soon, a suitable location was found on nearby Squantum Point, and the Victory Destroyer Plant started construction in 1917. Located on of land, the yard exclusively built destroyers, with being the last ship constructed at the plant. In 1920, the yard was turned over to the United States government and dismantled. This same year, Bethlehem Steel split off its shipbuilding division into the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, which was headquartered at the yard.

Combined with the Squantum yard, Fore River turned out 71 destroyers during the war, more than any other American yard. Besides the other Quincy yard, Bethlehem built the Fields Point Plant for boiler construction in nearby Providence, Rhode Island and the Black Rock Plant for turbines in Buffalo, New York. The yard constructed in 174 days. Not to be outdone, the Squantum yard built in twenty-eight days, delivering it to the Navy seventeen days later. Such was the speed at which the yard produced ships that the Navy was forced to moor the ships at the Boston Navy Yard for lack of crews. The yard&#x27;s speed allowed for the management to enter a bet with another Bethlehem plant, Union Iron Works, to see which plant would deliver more ships in a year. At the end of 1918, Fore River delivered eighteen ships to Union&#x27;s six.

====Post-War and Great Depression====
The end of World War I did not immediately affect the yard, as it was still producing ships from wartime orders. The only cancellations that occurred in the yard after the war were the cancellation of the Lexington-class battlecruiser . This was offset by the construction of two cruisers, which were delivered in due time. Additionally, the yard finished building the multiple orders that it received for the S-class submarine, as well as orders for two other submarines.

Between 1922 and 1925, the yard underwent a major expansion period, including the purchase of the Atlantic Works, which later became Bethlehem Atlantic Works. Bethlehem also purchased a floating drydock from Simpson’s Dry Dock Company, built a battleship slip, and constructed a new way for merchant ships. The terms of the Washington Naval Treaty in 1921 brought the conversion of the Lexington to an aircraft carrier (), which was launched in 1925 in front of a group of over 20,000 people. The treaty brought about the cancellation of , part of the now-prohibited South Dakota-class battleship. The hull was eventually scrapped in 1923 with only 11% of the ship completed.

The post-war lull brought about new opportunities for the yard, as it converted or upgraded ships such as , and overhauled locomotives for the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. The yard produced brass fittings for banjo clocks, in an attempt by Charles Schwab to keep the talented workers employed. Eventually, this lull ended in 1925 with the order of a ferry for the City of Boston. Around this time, the yard received orders for and , both the lead ships of their respective classes. At the end of 1925, the yard had built 400 ships, 111 of which were military contracts, while the other 289 were for civilian organizations. Furthermore, the yard built the liners , and for the Oceanic Steamship Company.

The Great Depression brought little work to the yard, with the exception of the completion of and . was built from 1936 to 1940, in addition to a handful of destroyers. Employment in the yard dropped drastically during this time, from 4,900 in 1931 to 812 two years later.

====World War II====
The Naval Act of 1938 brought increased shipbuilding to the yard, as it mandated a 20% increase in the strength of the nation&#x27;s Navy. This brought an expansion of business to the yard, with 17,000 employees working in December 1941 and 32,000 in 1943, including 1,200 women. Payroll reached $ (equivalent to $ in today&#x27;s dollars) around this time, and contracts amounted to around $ (equivalent to $ in today&#x27;s dollars).

The speed of construction at the yard increased, as the keel of was laid immediately after was launched. The speed of the construction ran in line with the building of more ships. was cut up and relocated three times in order to accommodate the construction of other ships. Much like World War I, the yard expanded, and built the Bethlehem Hingham Shipyard in order to accommodate the increased construction demands. Sixteen ways were constructed on over , and 227 ships were produced with 23,500 workers.

The yard produced in fourteen and a half months, and in a record of sixteen and a half months. The yard built ninety-two vessels of eleven classes during the war, and earned the Army-Navy &quot;E&quot; Award for excellence of construction of vessels, which was awarded on 15 May 1942, with four stars being added during the course of the war. Additionally, the yard produced , which was renamed from USS Cabot after the sinking of when yard workers petitioned for a renaming of the ship.

During the war, the yard was possibly the origin of the popular expression &quot;Kilroy was here.&quot; Although it was not known originally where the phrase came from, the American Transit Association ran a contest trying to find the origin of the phrase in 1946. Welding inspector James J. Kilroy ended up sending his account in, and was deemed the winner. In an attempt to make sure that riveters would be prevented from defrauding the shipyard of their accurate workload, he scrawled the phrase in chalk on the ships that he was inspecting. Ships that the phrase was printed on included , USS &quot;Lexington&quot;, and various troop carriers.

While the shipyard was at its peak of operations during the war, it was not uncommon for German U boats to stalk ships leaving the yard and engage them once offshore.

===Post-war===
After the war, the yard was faced with new opportunities. As the war greatly expanded the yard, the yard now had extra space. Thus, the Hingham yard was closed, and the yard diversified its interests. The yard constructed a blast furnace, a wind tunnel, draglines, and steel for an aqueduct of the Boston&#x27;s Metropolitan District Commission, a transformer for Boston Edison, among other things. The yard was faced with inflation, increasing material costs, and demands for higher wages.

The yard did continue to turn out war orders for the ships and , the latter being the first ship in the Navy with air conditioning. The yard overhauled , , and of the Panama Railway Company. The yard ceased work until 1950 at the end of these conversions, with employment dipping to 3,800 employees. The line later took up building merchant ships for the American Export Lines, including the Type P3 ship ocean liners and , with the most powerful turbines placed in a merchant ships at that time. The yard converted and later into guided-missile cruisers, and delivered them to the Navy in 1953 and 1958, respectively.

During this time, work continued to decline for the yard, although the yard found work in contracts from the United States Maritime Commission for three C4 tanker in 1951, and two more in 1952. Now, tankers became the yard&#x27;s main work, with the Gulf Oil Corporation placing orders for two tankers, Socony ordering one tanker, and Orion contracting three more of the same tonnage. The Navy also ordered , which weighed and was an improvement over previous designs. Around this time, the yard began the construction of , the first ship which allowed for the shipment of chemicals over the ocean. Through refrigeration, this allowed for them to be transported safely and allowed for the carrying of eleven different chemicals at once. Furthermore, the yard built the C4-S-1 class freighter, a modification of the Type C4. Finally, the yard produced its largest destroyers yet, and .

The yard&#x27;s slow work after the war was a symptom of having a glut of extra ships that were available for the United States Merchant Marine. The passage of the Merchant Ship Sales Act of 1946 meant that ships could be sold for as little as $ (equivalent to roughly $ in today&#x27;s dollars) per deadweight ton. The flip side of this glut of ships was that there was a prediction that in 1961, more ships would be need to be constructed. This was evidenced by the fact that in 1954, there were orders for five tankers, one fleet oiler, and five destroyers. The next year, the yard attempted to become part of the building of the Forrestal-class aircraft carriers when Bethlehem objected to the awarding of the contracts to the Newport News Shipbuilding and the New York Naval Yard. Although the company pointed out that it had produced many carriers during World War II, Newport News pointed out that the company never requested an improvement of its shipbuilding facilities by the government during the war, which hampered its future bidding of aircraft carrier construction. That it had not built a single carrier since the end of the war also hurt its chances. The yard was later rewarded four frigates to build instead.

The yard began a new era when it was awarded construction of , a nuclear guided-missile cruiser. Such was the amount of work involved in the building of the &quot;Long Beach&quot; that the yard had to decline building , the world&#x27;s first nuclear-powered merchant ship. The yard entered into an expansion period during these years, replacing six pre-World War I sliding ways, which could now accommodate between three and six ships. Ships were built for the Greek shipping company Stavros Niarchos including a tanker with a capacity of of crude oil, named and . The yard produced the nation&#x27;s largest tanker, , which was christened by Frederica of Hanover, Queen of Greece. Fore River also branched out into radar tower construction in this time, constructing Texas Tower 2 in 1955 and Texas Tower 3 in 1956.

The 1960s began with a five-month strike by workers over either wages and benefits (according to local newspapers), or unilateral work rules (according to the Industrial Union of Marine and Ship-building Workers). In the midst of the strike, the Navy towed , which was under conversion at the time, to the nearby Boston Navy Yard for completion, an action which prompted both laborers and management to negotiate a three-year contract and helped to nullify unpopular work rules. Later that year, the &quot;Long Beach&quot; was launched, which was a major achievement for the yard.

1962 brought about the construction of , which was the largest commercial vessel built in the United States at the time, and became the first ship to transit the Northwest Passage to the Alaska North Slope oil fields. The &quot;Bainbridge&quot; was launched in that year, but not without accusations from the government that Bethlehem overcharged the Navy, as the costs increased from almost $ (equivalent to $ in today&#x27;s dollars) in 1959 to a negotiated $ (equivalent to $ in today&#x27;s dollars) three years later, down from an estimate of $ (equivalent to $ in today&#x27;s dollars) before then, although there was a $ (equivalent to $ in today&#x27;s dollars) discrepancy in the yard. After the end of the strike mentioned above, the yard was accused by the government of overcharging for the first nuclear frigate, and the &quot;Long Beach&quot;. The shipyard later made up for the losses of $ (equivalent to $ in today&#x27;s dollars) by crediting on other contracts that were being offered.

1963 brought an end of an era to the yard, as Bethlehem put the yard up for sale. Fifty years of Bethlehem ownership, which began when the yard was near financial ruin, came to an end as the yard was one of the most established yards in the world.

===General Dynamics Quincy Shipbuilding Division===
In 1964, the yard was purchased by General Dynamics Corporation. J. William Jones, President of the company, stated that the yard was purchased in order to provide its Electric Boat division with increased flexibility. The yard was purchased for $ (equivalent to $ in today&#x27;s dollars), and Electric Boat managed the yard until its reorganization. Immediately, the yard was closed by Bethlehem Steel on 1 January 1964, and it was announced that thirteen hundred of the yard&#x27;s employees would be retired or pensioned off immediately or within the next two years, leaving five hundred workers left. General Dynamics immediately invested $ (equivalent to $ in today&#x27;s dollars) into various facilities in the yard, improving it in many ways.

The yard was soon awarded the contract for the reconfiguration of the Apollo Instrumentation Ships from oilers. was converted into USNS &quot;Vanguard&quot; (T-AG-194), USNS &quot;Mission De Pala&quot; (T-AO-114) was converted to USNS &quot;Redstone&quot; (T-AGM-20), and was renamed USNS &quot;Mercury&quot; (T-AGM-21). Also in the 1960s, the yard modified and , and built and . Work began on and , both of which were ammunition ships, while construction began on the submarine tenders and . Around this time, the yard began construction of the Seabee barges, for the Lykes Brothers Steamship Company, which were the first modular construction ships built by General Dynamics at the yard, although they were sued by Lykes for late delivery off the ships.

The addition of the Liquified natural gas tanker contracts in the early 1970s meant that the yard was due for another conversion. General Dynamics then invested $ (equivalent to $ in today&#x27;s dollars) into more ways and wet basins in the yard, in order to be more competitive. The yard began construction of all of the Wichita-class replenishment oilers, with the exception of . Cost overruns were an issue with these ships, although eventually the costs were negotiated. Furthermore, the yard built four of the Anchorage-class dock landing ships, which were delivered between 1970 and 1972. These ships were involved in cost overruns as well, and in 1975 the Naval Sea Systems Command awarded the yard $ (equivalent to $ in today&#x27;s dollars) for these overruns.

The addition of modular construction to the yard meant that it could build ships by assembling pre-fabricated units, a technique that was used at the Victory Destroyer Plant during World War I. During the end of 1971, the yard was faced with declining contracts, which created rumors that the yard was close to closing. The yard was in discussion to gain a $ (equivalent to $ in today&#x27;s dollars) contract for six supertankers, which would carry of crude oil each. These tankers were supposed to be constructed with a forty-three percent subsidy from the federal government, which was granted. Eventually though, funding fell through, and construction did not proceed on the ships. Despite this, the yard modified , which was a $ (equivalent to $ in today&#x27;s dollars) contract, where the ship received new equipment. This contract provided one hundred jobs for the yard.

The first attempt at government intervention for the yard came with Congressman James A. Burke aiming to stave off the imminent layoffs of two thousand workers. He attempted to get the yard awarded the contract for repairs to . In a telegram to then-Secretary of Defense Elliot Richardson, he said that the closure of the Boston Navy Yard created a labor surplus. Unfortunately for the yard, the contract never panned out.

Delivery of in 1973 meant that the only work at the yard consisted of the modification of the Hayes and construction of cylinders for submarines at Newport News Shipbuilding and Electric Boat, which helped to maintain work for about two hundred and eighty machine shop workers. Economic salvation came to the yard during the construction of LNG-41, which was calculated to bring 5,500 to 6,000 workers employment. Projected to begin in July 1973, the work was delayed until December due to delays in yard improvements. In the meantime, the Irving Sealion was repaired at the yard. The Esso Halifax, which struck an iceberg on the way to Resolute Bay in Nova Scotia was repaired in the yard during this time.

The laying down of the LNG-41 occurred during the repair of , which was used to repair submarines at Naval Submarine Base New London. Congressman Burke was instrumental in securing this work, which kept the yard busy in 1974. That same year, a seventeen-week strike broke out, which created a situation where all work stopped and tanker work came to a halt. Eventually, the strike was resolved, but not before jeopardizing the future of the yard. After the settlement of the strike, was repaired at the yard in 1975, as General Dynamics had the lowest bid. In 1975, the yard had eight LNG contracts, which totaled $ (equivalent to $ in today&#x27;s dollars). It was around this time that the Goliath crane was constructed, which was a crane built for the construction of tankers. Until it was removed in 2008, it was the largest gantry crane in North America.

The final construction project for the yard came in the form of construction of five 2nd Lieutenant John P. Bobo Class of Maritime Prepositioning ships. These ships could house equipment and supplies to house 4,000 Marines for thirty days, as well as everything they would need for combat. The ships were also designed to not need port facilities, as everything could be offloaded offshore. The ships were built by General Dynamics and initially were operated by General Dynamics&#x27; American Overseas Marine under a 25-year charter. The end of the construction of these ships in May 1986 meant that there was no longer any need for the yard, as attempts to secure container ships for United States Lines and survey ships for the Navy fell through. In 1986, the yard closed, with remaining employees either retiring or being laid off. In 1987, General Dynamics Quincy Shipbuilding Division ceased operation. The closure of the yard came after an unsuccessful attempt by employees to purchase the yard. On 1 June 1986, Fore River Shipyard closed for good.

===Redevelopment===


Closure of the division initially led to dormancy at the yard. Some equipment was sold off while other parts of the yard were used for staging areas of the Boston Harbor cleanup project. Various plans were then offered at the time for use of the shipyard.

During this period, a ship scrapping operation, operating under the name Fore River Shipyard and Iron Works existed at one end of the yard. An initial purchase of five former &quot;Forrest Sherman&quot;-class destroyers was made, which included the , , , , and . Of these, &quot;Du Pont&quot; was the only one that was successfully scrapped, as the company concluded that the costs of scrapping the other ships would exceed their scrap value. The company later sought bankruptcy protection in 1994, and the remaining ships were sold to other scrap dealers by the Massachusetts Bankruptcy Court.

In 1992, a group of volunteers came up with the idea of purchasing a ship built at the shipyard and relocating it to a new museum that would celebrate the history of the yard. In 1993, the United States Naval Shipbuilding Museum was established by the Massachusetts General Court with the aim to, &quot;acquire, refurbish and maintain United States naval ships and the adjacent physical complex in order that it will [serve] as a major attraction for local citizens and tourists.&quot; Initially, plans called for the purchase of , but the museum ended up getting , the last all-gun heavy cruiser ever built, returned to the Quincy yard after negotiations with the Naval Sea Systems Command. On 30 October 1994 &quot;Salem&quot; returned to Quincy to be permanently docked where she was built nearly five decades before. In May 2014, however, it was announced that the &quot;Salem&quot; would be moved to East Boston after the pier the ship was berthed and closed the previous September due to safety reasons. The move never took place, and the ship remains open as a museum at Fore River.

In 1995, Sotirious Emmanouil purchased the former yard and promised to restore shipbuilding to the yard, through his company Massachusetts Heavy Industries. The company cleaned up much of the yard and built a handful of buildings after securing a $ (equivalent to $ in today&#x27;s dollars) loan, but was unable to secure any contracts and became mired in disputes. The company eventually defaulted on its loans and the property was seized by the United States Maritime Administration in 2000, with its assets being auctioned off a few years later.

Daniel J Quirk, a local auto dealer, bought the property in 2004 for use as a motor vehicle storage and distribution facility. Before the Great Recession hit, he publicized plans to redevelop the yard into condominiums and a living history exhibit, and cited Marina Bay, which is located at the old Victory Destroyer Plant and the Charlestown Navy Yard as examples of what he wanted to turn the yard into. In 2006, as he was trying to sell the Goliath crane, he acknowledged that if he was unable to sell it, he would probably have it scrapped due to it becoming dangerous due to ongoing deterioration of the structure.

On 14 August 2008, ironworker Robert Harvey was killed when a portion of the Goliath crane collapsed during dismantlement. Work on the crane&#x27;s removal was halted for two months while local and federal officials investigated the accident, but the work later resumed and was completed in early 2009. As a result of their investigation, on 13 January 2009 the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration imposed fines totalling $ (equivalent to $ in today&#x27;s dollars). A barge carrying the crane was christened USS &quot;Harvey&quot; in honor of the fallen worker and left the shipyard on 7 March 2009 en route to Romania.

The August 2008 fatal incident was preceded by two other deaths involving demolition of the main gantry crane at the shipyard on 26 January 2005. The earlier incident resulted in an OSHA ruling against Testa Corporation of Lynnfield, Massachusetts, including a proposed $ (equivalent to $ in today&#x27;s dollars) fine. Following the 2005 collapse, violations involving improper cleanup and removal of asbestos found in debris left by the accident resulted in a $ (equivalent to $ in today&#x27;s dollars) penalty imposed against Testa by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection.

The former shipyard served as a port for commuter boats to Boston run by Harbor Express for the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). This service was discontinued in 2013 when a dock in Quincy was severely damaged. Currently, there are no plans to revive this service. The yard is also used by Jay Cashman, Inc., for heavy construction and marine equipment services, by the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority as a sewage sludge heat-drying and pelletizing facility, and by Fore River Transportation Corporation for short line freight rail service to CSXT South Braintree. The yard was also used as the main construction area for the new Fore River Bridge, which is located adjacent to the property.

Although shipbuilding operations ceased in 1986, the name of the yard continues to be used, and the location is still referred to as Fore River Shipyard.

====Appearance in film====
Fore River Shipyard has also appeared in multiple films since it was closed. The climactic shootout from the 2006 film &quot;The Departed&quot; was filmed in the yard. In 2009, the film &quot;The Company Men&quot; was filmed at the site of the former yard. For the 2015 film &quot;The Finest Hours&quot;, sets were constructed at the yard, along with a giant water tank. The film also used the former during production.

===World War II Slipways===

==Ships constructed at Fore River==

During the almost one hundred years that the yard was operational, it produced hundreds of ships, submarines, and personal sailing vessels. Among these orders were the civilian ships the &quot;Barnacle&quot; and the multiple-masted schooners the &quot;Thomas W. Lawson&quot; and &quot;William L. Douglas&quot;. The yard produced military contracts, including and . Submarines were constructed, including for the United States Navy, and others for both the Imperial Japanese Navy and the Royal Navy.

As the yard was expanded over the years, it built battleships such as , , and the preserved , itself moored in Battleship Cove. Other naval ships include the preserved heavy cruiser (as part of the United States Naval Shipbuilding Museum adjacent to the shipyard), , and . The yard constructed multiple aircraft carriers, including the conversion of the battlecruiser &quot;USS Lexington CC-1&quot;&quot;s hull into , , , and .

After the war, the yard found itself faced with changing realities, and increasingly relied on merchant marine ships, including , the first chemical transport ship in the United States and . The yard built passenger vessels, including SS &quot;Lurline&quot;, , . The last ships built at the yard were the 2nd Lieutenant John P. Bobo Class of Maritime Prepositioning ships. With the building of , the yard closed for good.

<text>Southwestern Adventist University is a private Adventist university in Keene, Texas. It is owned by the Southwestern Union Conference of Seventh-day Adventists. The university enrolls about 800 students on a rural, 150-acre campus.

The university is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and the Adventist Accrediting Association. The nursing program is approved by the Texas Board of Nurse Examiners.

==History==
Southwestern Adventist University was founded in 1893 as Keene Industrial Academy. The purchase of property for the school was financed by Seventh-day Adventists in the Dallas area. Its first building, completed in 1894, was also used as a church. The school, which opened with 56 students, adopted its current name in 1996.

On January 2, 1944, the West Hall boys&#x27; dormitory, which had undergone extensive repairs in the summer of 1943, was destroyed by fire. 16-year-old student Reginald Maddison was awakened by a rumbling sound around 5:00 a.m. and saw flames emerging from a dust closet. He alerted students to the fire and activated the fire alarm. 12 students, including Maddison, escaped unharmed. One student was injured when jumping from a second story window. 2 students died during the fire. Curtis &quot;Lee Roy&quot; Birdwell, 15, was found in the basement underneath his dorm room. Virgil Dye, 17, was found near the chimney towards the center of the blaze.

Southwestern Adventist University is located at the town of Keene, Texas, six miles northeast of Cleburne. Keene has been described as an Adventist &quot;company&quot; town. On Saturdays, the Sabbath for Adventists, most stores in town are closed.

The Keene Seventh-day Adventist Church has several thousand members. It is the Southwestern Adventist University church.

The Seventh-day Adventist Church in America is divided into administrative units called unions, and most of these unions have a college. Most of these colleges were founded in the 1890s, a period of intense activity in Adventist history.

The university evolved through several stages from Keene Industrial Academy to its present university status. At its beginning, it sold acreage to Adventist families and industries, and is now the largest Adventist community in the Southwestern Union, which includes Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and New Mexico.

==Academics==

During Fall 2014, Southwestern began to offer a Fire Science degree. The program is the only one of its kind among Seventh-day Adventist colleges and universities. Graduates of this program will receive a degree, as well as several technical certifications that will allow them to become employed by fire departments around the nation.

In June 2023 the university was placed on Warning status by its educational accreditor, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, after the accreditor&#x27;s board found significant non-compliance with its standards of student achievement, student outcomes and employment of full-time faculty.

==Athletics==
The Southwestern Adventist (SWAU) athletic teams are called the Knights. The university is a member of the United States Collegiate Athletic Association (USCAA) since the 2002–03 academic year. They are also a member of the National Christian College Athletic Association (NCCAA), primarily competing as an independent in the Southwest Region of the Division II level. The Knights previously competed in the Red River Athletic Conference (RRAC) of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) from 1998–99 to 2001–02.

SWAU competes in eight intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include basketball and soccer; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, soccer and volleyball; and co-ed sports include cross country, gymnastics and tennis.

<doc id="1266043" wikidata="Q328320" url="?curid=1266043" title="Hostage (2005 film)">
<text>Hostage is a 2005 action thriller film directed by Florent Siri from the screenplay by Doug Richardson. It is based on the 2001 novel of the same name by Robert Crais. The film stars Bruce Willis (who co-produced the film), Kevin Pollak, Ben Foster, and Jonathan Tucker and follows the police chief who takes place as the negotiator when the family of a wealthy accountant is held hostage by three teenagers. The film earned negative reviews from critics and grossed $77 million.

==Plot==
Former L.A. SWAT officer Jeff Talley is a hostage negotiator in Los Angeles. One day, Talley negotiates with an abusive man who has taken his own wife and son hostage after learning his wife was cheating on him. Shortly after Talley denies a SWAT commander&#x27;s request to give snipers the order to open fire, the despondent husband kills his wife, son, and himself. Traumatized, Talley moves with his family and becomes police chief in Bristo Camino, a suburban hamlet in nearby Ventura County.

A year later, Talley finds himself in another hostage situation when two teenagers, Dennis Kelly and his brother Kevin, and their accomplice Marshall &quot;Mars&quot; Krupcheck take the accountant Walter Smith and his two children, teenage Jennifer and young Tommy, hostage in Smith&#x27;s house after a failed robbery attempt. The first officer to respond is shot twice by Mars just before Talley arrives. Talley attempts to rescue the officer, but she dies in front of him. Traumatized and unwilling to put himself through another tragedy, Talley hands authority over to the Ventura County Sheriff&#x27;s Department and leaves.

Smith has been laundering money for a mysterious criminal syndicate through offshore shell corporations. He was preparing to turn over a batch of important encrypted files recorded on a DVD when he was taken hostage. To prevent the incriminating evidence from being discovered, the syndicate orders someone known only as the Watchman to kidnap Talley&#x27;s wife and daughter. Talley is instructed to return to the hostage scene, regain authority, and stall for time until the organization can launch its own attack against Smith&#x27;s house.

Dennis forces Kevin and Mars to tie up the children, while he knocks out Smith and finds a large amount of cash. In an attempt to end the standoff and secure the DVDs himself, Talley meets with Dennis and agrees to provide a helicopter in exchange for half of the money. When the helicopter arrives, Dennis and Kevin bring the money to Talley and prepare to leave, but Mars refuses to leave without Jennifer, with whom he has become infatuated. Talley says the helicopter will only carry three additional people and insists that Jennifer stay behind, but the deal breaks down and the boys return to the house. Talley learns that Mars is a psychopathic killer who could turn on the hostages and his own accomplices at any moment. Mars does, in fact, kill Dennis and Kevin, just as Kevin is about to release the children.

The syndicate sends fake FBI agents to recover the DVD and they storm the house; Talley is instructed to not go near the house. Jennifer stabs Mars and locks herself and Tommy in the panic room. Hearing their screams, Talley breaches the house and is attacked by Mars, who then kills most of the fake agents using his pistol and multiple Molotov cocktails. Mars is then shot in the side by the only surviving agent. The agent tracks down Talley and the children and demands the encrypted DVD. After Talley gives him the DVD, Mars reappears, distracting the agent long enough to be killed by Talley. Mars then prepares to throw his last Molotov, but collapses to his knees, weakened by his injuries. He makes eye contact with Jennifer, then drops the Molotov and immolates himself.

Talley escapes with the children by shooting the indoor glass waterfall, which extinguishes the fire. He and a recovered Smith then go to a rundown inn where Talley&#x27;s wife and daughter are being held captive by the Watchman and his crew. Smith, feigning hatred for Talley, is freed in exchange for the family. While demanding that the Watchman kill Talley for revealing his identity, without hesitation, Smith executes the Watchman. This allows Talley to kill the other gunmen and rescue his family.

==Production==
The film&#x27;s plot is roughly the same as Crais&#x27;s novel. The main difference is that the novel&#x27;s complicated subplot involving powerful West Coast Mafia crime lord Sonny Benza was removed, with the film giving little explanation of Walter Smith&#x27;s criminal associates. The film also makes the first group of hostage-takers somewhat younger in age than depicted in the novel. In addition, the criminal syndicate in the film was portrayed as mysterious criminals rather than a regular Mafia.

Filming took place in the Malibu area (in western Los Angeles County). The exterior views of Smith&#x27;s lavishly appointed house were filmed at a real house in the unincorporated Topanga Canyon area, between Malibu and Los Angeles; the interior scenes were done on sound stages in Hollywood.

The character Mars, played by Ben Foster, was modeled after Bay Area rap artist Mars by Robert Crais after a friend Dennis Bsharah urged him to look into the horrorcore genre. In the movie adaptation, Foster strongly resembles the rapper. Jonathan Tucker&#x27;s name was later changed to Dennis.

The movie&#x27;s opening scenes were filmed in the Boyle Heights neighborhood of East Los Angeles, just east of downtown.

The fictional city of Bristo Camino was possibly intended to be a representation of Ojai or Moorpark. Bristo Bay is the name of Bristo Camino in the 2001 Robert Crais &quot;novel&quot;.

==Release==
===Home media===
&quot;Hostage&quot; was released on DVD &amp; VHS June 21, 2005.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film earned $34.6 million at the United States box office and a total worldwide gross of $77.6 million.

It made $9.8 million from 2,123 theaters in its opening weekend, finishing fourth.

===Critical response ===

On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 35% based on 158 reviews, with an average rating of 5.08/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Grisly and cliched, audiences may feel they&#x27;re being held &quot;Hostage&quot;.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 44 out of 100 based on 33 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four, writing: &quot;In scenes where a hero must outgun four or five armed opponents, however, &quot;Hostage&quot; does use the reliable action movie technique of cutting from one target to the next, so that we never see what the others are doing while the first ones are being shot. Waiting for their closeups, I suppose.&quot;

<text>&quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot; is a song recorded by Australian singer Kylie Minogue for her eighth studio album, &quot;Fever&quot; (2001). Parlophone Records released the song as the album&#x27;s lead single on 8 September 2001. &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot;, which was written and produced by Cathy Dennis and Rob Davis, is a dance-pop, techno-pop and nu-disco song that is known for its &quot;la la la&quot; hook. Its lyrics are about obsession with a love interest. Music critics praised the song&#x27;s production and Minogue&#x27;s vocals and labelled it a highlight of &quot;Fever&quot;.

The song reached number one on the charts in 40 countries worldwide. It peaked at number one on the UK Singles Chart for four weeks and was certified three-times platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). It also topped the Australian Singles Chart and received a three-times Platinum certification from the Australian Recording Industry Association. In the United States, the song peaked at number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and became Minogue&#x27;s first US top-ten single in 13 years. , the track has sold over five million copies worldwide.

Dawn Shadforth directed the music video for &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot;, which features Minogue dancing against futuristic backdrops; the white jumpsuit she wore in the video became a fashion statement. Since the song&#x27;s release, Minogue has included it on the set lists of various concert tours. &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot; appeared on several decade-end lists compiled by media such as &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;NME&quot;. In 2012, Minogue re-recorded the song for her orchestral compilation album &quot;The Abbey Road Sessions&quot;.

==Writing and release==
In 2000, British singer-songwriter Cathy Dennis and English songwriter Rob Davis had been brought together by Universal Publishing to work on new music. The session for &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot; began with Davis generating a 125 bpm drum loop using the computer program Cubase. Dennis improvised with the line &quot;I just can&#x27;t get you out of my head&quot;, which later became the song&#x27;s lyric. After three and a half hours, Davis and Dennis had recorded the demo for &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot; and the vocals were recorded the same day; the pair said the recording process was &quot;very natural and fluid&quot;, and did not rely on heavy instrumentation.

Prior to pitching the song to Kylie Minogue, Davis and Dennis unsuccessfully offered it to S Club 7 and Sophie Ellis-Bextor. Davis then met with Minogue&#x27;s A&amp;R executive Jamie Nelson, who was impressed by the song&#x27;s upbeat production and thought it would appeal to clubgoers. Nelson booked the song for Minogue to record. Although Davis thought the recording session would later be cancelled, Minogue wanted to record the song after hearing 20 seconds of the demo. The song was recorded at Davis&#x27;s home studio in Surrey, England. The music, except the guitar part, was programmed using a Korg Triton workstation via a MIDI interface. Tim Orford was the mix engineer for the song. In a 2011 interview Dennis stated, &quot;even though Kylie wasn&#x27;t the first artist to be offered the song, I don&#x27;t believe anyone else would have done the incredible job she did with it&quot;.

In 2001, Minogue embarked on the On a Night Like This tour to promote her seventh studio album &quot;Light Years&quot; (2000). She premiered &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot; on stage during the tour. It was later chosen as the lead single from Minogue&#x27;s eighth studio album &quot;Fever&quot;, and released in September 2001, by Parlophone.

==Composition and lyrical interpretation==

&quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot; is three minutes and 50 seconds long. In their book &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, Nathan Brackett and Christian David Hoard labelled it a neo-disco track. Justin Myers of the Official Charts Company characterized it as a dance-pop song, &quot;Stereogum&quot; Tom Breinan described it as a techno-pop anthem, and AllMusic&#x27;s Tim Sendra called it a &quot;timeless new wave disco hit&quot;. &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot; is written in the key of A minor.

The song, which does not follow the common verse–chorus structure, is composed of numerous fragmented sections. According to Davis, it &quot;breaks a few rules as it starts with a chorus and in comes the &#x27;la&#x27;s&#x27;&quot;. Minogue chants a &quot;la la la&quot; hook that is often noted as the song&#x27;s most appealing part by music critics. According to BBC Radio 2, the song&#x27;s composition is &quot;deceptively simple, but its veins run with the whole history of electronic music&quot;. The writer described the song&#x27;s bassline as &quot;pulsing&quot; and influenced by the music of English rock band New Order and German electronic music band Kraftwerk.

&quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot; is about an obsession with an unknown person, who according to &quot;The Guardian&quot; Dorian Lansky could be &quot;a partner, an evasive one-night stand or someone who doesn&#x27;t know [the song&#x27;s narrator] exists&quot;. Writing for the same newspaper, Everett True identified a &quot;darker element&quot; in the simple lyrics and said this sentiment is echoed in Minogue&#x27;s restrained vocals. True also said while Minogue&#x27;s earlier work presented an optimistic romantic future, &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot; focuses on an unhealthy and potentially destructive obsession. He noted in her earlier songs, Minogue played &quot;the wide-eyed ingénue with alacrity&quot; but that in this track, she is aware of the harmful nature of her infatuation, which True called a &quot;desire that is wholly dependent on her own self-control&quot;.

In 2012, Minogue re-recorded &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot; for her orchestral compilation album &quot;The Abbey Road Sessions&quot;. The 2012 version of the song has an altered musical arrangement and uses a pizzicato playing technique in which the strings of a string instrument are continuously plucked.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot; received acclaim from music critics for its production and Minogue&#x27;s vocals. Chris True of AllMusic picked &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot; as a highlight of &quot;Fever&quot;, saying it &quot;pulses and grooves like no other she&#x27;s recorded&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Jim Farber said the song &quot;fully lives up to its title&quot; and compared it to the music of American singer Andrea True. &quot;PopMatters&quot; Jason Thompson described Minogue&#x27;s vocals as a &quot;sexual come on&quot; and called the song &quot;trim and funky&quot;. Dominique Leone of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; wrote that the song &quot;exudes a catchiness that belies its inherent simplicity, so reassuring during an era when chart acts sound increasingly baroque and producers race to see who can ape electronic music trends first&quot;.

In 2012, &quot;The Guardian&quot; music critic Everett True defined &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot; as &quot;one of those rare moments in pop: sleek and chic and stylish and damnably danceable, but with a darker element hidden in plain sight&quot;. In a 2014 retrospective review, &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Jason Lipshutz praised Minogue&#x27;s vocals and said they complement the production, and that; &quot;her voice operates alongside it, finding renewed power in its drive&quot;. Olive Pometsey of &quot;GQ&quot; deemed it &quot;the sound of the noughties&quot;, highlighting the synthesisers that create &quot;a moment of pure pop perfection&quot;. Writing for the &quot;Herald Sun&quot;, Cameron Adams placed &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot; at the top of his list of Minogue&#x27;s best songs and called it &quot;a happy accident&quot;. Adams wrote, &quot;if you could program a computer to formulate the perfect pop song, it would sound like this&quot;.

Reviewing &quot;The Abbey Road Sessions&quot; version of the song, Tim Sendra of AllMusic said the &quot;most interesting reboot&quot; on the album took place on &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot;, saying the &quot;insistent strings push the song along with tightly coiled electricity that is impossible to resist&quot;. Sal Cinquemani of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; chose the song as one of the album&#x27;s highlights, saying its arrangement makes up for the absence of dance beats and vocal production. &quot;The Independent&quot;″s Simon Price wrote while the original version of &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot; would be &quot;impossible to improve on&quot;, the reworked version &quot;turns it into a pizzicato thriller score&quot;. According to Jude Rogers of &quot;The Quietus&quot;, the song&#x27;s orchestral treatment does not work well for its memorable electronic production.

In 2003, &quot;Q Magazine&quot; ranked &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot; at number 694 on their list of the 1001 Best Songs Ever. In 2011, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine placed it at number 45 on their 100 Best Songs of the 2000s list, noting Minogue &quot;seduced the US with this mirror-ball classic&quot;. &quot;NME&quot; ranked the song at number 74 on their 100 Best Track of the Noughties list, saying it &quot;encapsulated everything enviable in a well-crafted song&quot; and that it is Minogue&#x27;s best single. In 2012, Priya Elan of &quot;NME&quot; placed the song at number four on her The Greatest Pop Songs in History list. In 2012, &quot;The Guardian&quot; included the song on their list of The Best Number One Records in the United Kingdom, labelling it &quot;sleek, Arctic-blue minimalism, like an emotionally thwarted retelling of Donna Summer&#x27;s &#x27;I Feel Love&#x27;&quot;. &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot; won the award for Best Single at the 2001 Top of the Pops Awards ceremony. At the 2002 ARIA Music Awards ceremony, it won the awards for Single of the Year and Highest Selling Single, and Minogue won the Outstanding Achievement Award. In 2002, it won a Dutch Edison Award for Single of the Year. At the inaugural Premios Oye! in 2002, the song received a nomination in the Song of the Year category.

==Music video==
===Development and synopsis===
British director Dawn Shadforth directed the music video for &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot;, which includes dance routines that were choreographed by American choreographer Michael Rooney. Minogue&#x27;s looks—her youthfulness, slim figure and proportionally large mouth–had attracted comments on her exotic image; the British tabloid newspaper &quot;News of the World&quot; suggested she might be an alien. Shadforth and music critic Paul Morley took the comments on Minogue&#x27;s looks into consideration, commenting on her as a &quot;creative, experimental artist&quot; by placing her face close to the camera lens in the music video, distorting her face but retaining her glamour.

The video begins with Minogue driving a De Tomaso Mangusta sports car while singing the song. The next scene depicts a number of couples dressed in black and white costumes performing a dance routine; they are soon joined by Minogue, who has wavy light-brown hair and is wearing a white tracksuit. The setting changes to a room where Minogue, now with straight hair and crimson lipstick, and wearing a white jumpsuit with a neckline plunging down to her navel, is striking poses. The outfit was designed by London-based fashion designer Fee Doran under the label Mrs Jones. According to Minogue, the outfit was inspired by fashion designs worn by Jamaican singer and model, Grace Jones. Minogue then performs a synchronised dance routine with several backup dancers, who are wearing red-and-black suits reminiscent of Kraftwerk&#x27;s &quot;Man Machine&quot; uniforms. As the video ends, Minogue—again with curly hair and wearing a lavender halter-neck dress with ribbon tile trim, performs a similar routine on top of a building at night.
===Impact===
At the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards ceremony, the music video was nominated for Best Dance Video; Rooney won the award for Best Choreography. The hooded white jumpsuit Minogue wore in the music video is often considered to be one of her most iconic looks, particularly because of its deep, plunging neckline. Minogue&#x27;s stylist William Baker described the choice of the outfit, saying, &quot;it was pure but kind of slutty at the same time&quot;. The outfit was put on display at &quot;Kylie: The Exhibition&quot;, which featured memorabilia and costumes from Minogue&#x27;s career, which was held at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, and at the similar &quot;Kylie: an exhibition&quot; at the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney. The jumpsuit was also included in Minogue&#x27;s official fashion photography book &quot;Kylie / Fashion&quot;, which was released to celebrate her 25 years in music.

The music video served as an inspiration for Morley while writing his book &quot;Words and Music: The History of Pop in the Shape of a City&quot;. In it, Morley said he &quot;turned the lonely drive [Minogue] made in the song&#x27;s video towards a city ... into a fictional history of music&quot;. University lecturers Diane Railton and Paul Weston, in their 2005 essay &quot;Naughty Girls and Red Blooded Women (Representations of Female Heterosexuality in Music Video)&quot;, contrasted the music video of &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot; with that of Beyoncé&#x27;s 2003 single &quot;Baby Boy&quot;; while both videos focus on two singers performing seductive dance routines, Minogue is presented in a calculated manner and &quot;is always provisional, restricted, and contingent&quot;, whereas Beyoncé displays a particular &quot;primitive, feral, uncontrolled and uncontrollable&quot; sexuality that is embodied in the black female body. Railton and Weston said the videos are representative of the depictions of white and black women in colonial times and pop culture, respectively.

==Live performances==
On 2 September 2001, Minogue performed &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot; at the BBC Radio 1 &quot;One Big Sunday&quot; show in Leicester, UK.

The performance was ranked at number 40 on &quot;The Guardian&quot; 2011 list of 50 Key Events in the History of Dance Music.

In 2003, Minogue performed &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot; at the one-night concert Money Can&#x27;t Buy at the Hammersmith Apollo in London in support of her ninth studio album &quot;Body Language&quot;.

During the event, she sang the orchestral version of &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot;. She performed the same version of the song on series nine of &quot;The X Factor&quot; in the United Kingdom on 8 December 2012. A &quot;slower, darker version&quot; of the song was included on Minogue&#x27;s Kiss Me Once Tour (2014–2015) set list. She also included &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot; on the 2015 Royal Albert Hall performance as part of her A Kylie Christmas concert.

==Legacy==
According to author Lee Barron, &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot; &quot;further established Minogue&#x27;s cultural and commercial relevance in the new millennium&quot;. He said the song &quot;with its hypnotic &#x27;la la la&#x27; refrain and the deceptively uncomplicated, catchily repetitive beats and synth-sound, marked yet another clearly defined image transformation from the camp-infused &quot;Light Years&quot; to an emphasis upon a cool, machine-like sexuality&quot;. Everett True of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote the song continued Kylie&#x27;s transition from the girl-next-door to &quot;flirtatious, sophisticated persona&quot; that started with the release of &quot;Spinning Around&quot; in 2000. True said the success of &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot; was one of the motivating factors behind &quot;manufactured&quot; pop music gaining &quot;new postmodern respectability&quot; and marked a &quot;clear shift in attitude towards pop music among the &#x27;serious&#x27; rock critic fraternity&quot;.

Publications like &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; recognise &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot; as Minogue&#x27;s signature song. In 2012, the UK agency PRS for Music, which collects royalties on behalf of songwriters and composers, named &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot; the most popular song of the decade because it received the most airplay and live covers in the 2000s decade.

<text>Aeta (Ayta ), Agta and Dumagat, are collective terms for several indigenous peoples who live in various parts of Luzon islands in the Philippines. They are included in the wider Negrito grouping of the Philippines and the rest of Southeast Asia, with whom they share superficial common physical characteristics such as: dark skin tones; short statures; frizzy to curly hair; and a higher frequency of naturally lighter hair colour (blondism) relative to the general population. They are thought to be among the earliest inhabitants of the Philippines—preceding the Austronesian migrations. Regardless, the modern Aeta populations have significant Austronesian admixture, and speak Austronesian languages.

Aeta communities were historically nomadic hunter-gatherers, typically consisting of approximately one to five families per mobile group. Groups under the &quot;Aeta&quot; umbrella term are normally referred to after their geographic locations or their common languages.

==Etymology==

The endonyms of most of the various Aeta peoples are derived from Proto-Malayo-Polynesian &quot;*ʔa(R)ta&quot; (also reconstructed as &quot;*qata&quot; or &quot;*ʔata&quot;) meaning &quot;[dark skinned] person.&quot; This is in contrast to the other terms for &quot;person&quot; in other Philippine (and Oceanian) groups derived from Proto-Malayo-Polynesian &quot;*tau&quot; (e.g. Tagalog &quot;tao&quot;), which refers to lighter-skinned groups with majority Austronesian descent. Lawrence A. Reid wrote that &quot;*ʔa(R)ta&quot; may have originally been the Negrito word for &quot;person&quot; in Northern Luzon, but was adopted into Austronesian languages with the meaning of &quot;dark-skinned person&quot;, after the arrival of Austronesian migrants to the Philippines from Taiwan. A common folk etymology is that the name &quot;Aeta&quot; is derived from &quot;itom&quot; or &quot;itim&quot; meaning, &quot;black&quot;, but this is incorrect.

The term &quot;Dumagat&quot; or &quot;Dumaget&quot; is an exonym meaning &quot;[people] from Magat River.&quot; The Luzon Dumagats are not to be confused with the etymology of the Visayan Dumagat (&quot;sea people&quot;, from the root word &quot;dagat&quot; - &quot;sea&quot;) who dwell in the coastal areas of Mindanao, contrasting them from inland Lumad.

Other exonyms of the Aeta are more derogatory. These include &quot;baluga&quot; (&quot;half-breed&quot;) and &quot;pugot&quot; (&quot;head-hunter&quot;). The Aeta themselves call non-Negrito groups with various names that reflect their ancient relationships with Austronesians. These include names like &quot;ugsin&quot;, &quot;ugdin&quot;, &quot;ogden&quot;, or &quot;uldin&quot; (&quot;red&quot;); &quot;putî&quot; or &quot;pute&quot; (&quot;white&quot;); &quot;unat&quot; (&quot;straight-haired&quot;); or &quot;agani&quot; (&quot;[rice] harvester&quot;).

==Definition==

Aeta (also Ayta, Áitâ, Ita, Alta, Arta, Atta, or Agta) is a collective term. Although commonly thought of as a single group, it is in reality composed of several ethnic groups that share similar hunter-gatherer lifestyles and physical features. They are usually divided into three main groups: the Aeta from Central Luzon; the Agta of Southeastern Luzon; and the Dumagat (also spelled Dumaget) of Eastern Luzon. These divisions, however, are arbitrary, and the three names can be used interchangeably. They are also commonly confused with the Ati people of the Visayas Islands.

The following is a list of ethnolinguistic groups usually considered to be Aeta, and the provinces they are from.

==History==
=== Origins ===


The Aeta people in the Philippines are generally grouped together with the wider Negrito population cluster of Southeast Asia, such as the Semang on the Malay Peninsula, or the Andamanese people. The Philippine Negritos display relatively closer genetic affinity towards different Eastern Asian populations, prehistoric Hoabinhian samples, as well as to the Indigenous people of New Guinea and Aboriginal Australians, from which they diverged around c. 40,000 years ago. They also display an internal genetic substructure along a North to South cline, suggesting their ancestral population diverged into two subgroups after the initial peopling of the Philippines. Furthermore, they display high percentages of Denisovan gene flow.

The Aeta are the descendants of the same early &quot;East-Eurasian&quot; meta-population, which also gave rise to modern East Asians and Australasians, among other populations of the Asia-Pacific region. The earliest modern human migrations into the Philippine islands were during the Paleolithic, around 40,000 years ago, followed by two other migration waves between 25,000 and 12,000 years ago, through the Sundaland land bridges that linked the islands with the Asian mainland. The latest migration wave is associated with the Austronesian peoples (c. 7,000 years ago) from Taiwan. Philippine Negritos furthermore display craniometric and dental affinities (Sundadonty) with various southern East Asian and Japanese populations, suggesting deep ancestral ties.

Many modern Aeta display significant Austronesian admixture (~10% to 30%) due to population contact and mixing after the arrival of Austronesians. The modern Aeta speak Austronesian languages, although with a high number of non-Austronesian vocabulary, and follow a syncretic cultural practices, incorporating many Austronesian elements into their traditional culture. Conversely, other Austronesian Filipino ethnic groups, not traditionally considered Negritos, also have Negrito admixture (~10 to 20%), highlighting mutual contact and influence. Aetas are most closely related to the Batak people of Palawan.

A recent study in 2021 analyzing archaic ancestry in 118 Philippine ethnic groups discovered an independent admixture event into Philippine Negritos from Denisovans. The Ayta Magbukon in particular were found to possess the highest level of Denisovan ancestry in the world (between 3-9%), which is about ~30%–40% higher than the amount observed among Australo-Papuans, suggesting that distinct Islander Denisovan populations existed in the Philippines, which admixed with modern humans after their arrival. At the same time, Central Luzon Negritos such as the Ayta Magbukon and Ayta Ambala were also found to have the least amount of Austronesian-derived ancestry of all sampled Philippine ethnic groups, at ~10%–20%.

=== Colonial era contacts and responses===
Unlike many other Filipino ethnic groups, the Aetas have shown resistance to change. Aetas had little interaction with the Spaniards as they remained in the mountains during the Spanish rule. Even the attempts of the Spaniards to settle them in &quot;reducciones&quot; or reservations failed all throughout Spanish rule.

According to Spanish observers like Miguel López de Legazpi, Negritos possessed iron tools and weapons. Their speed and accuracy with a bow and arrow were proverbial and they were fearsome warriors. Unwary travelers or field workers were often easy targets. Despite their martial prowess, however, the Aeta&#x27;s small numbers, primitive economy and lack of organization often made them easy prey for better-organized groups. Zambals seeking people to enslave would often take advantage of their internal feuding. They were often enslaved and sold to Borneo and China, and, unlike the serf feudal system (&quot;alipin&quot;) imposed on other Filipinos, there was little chance of manumission.

== Demographics ==
In 2010, there were 50,236 Aeta people in the Philippines.

== Ancestral lands ==
Aetas are found in Zambales, Tarlac, Pampanga, Panay, Bataan, and Nueva Ecija, but were forced to move to resettlement areas in Pampanga and Tarlac following the devastating Mount Pinatubo eruption in June 1991.

Some Aeta communities have received government land titles recognizing their claims to their ancestral lands.

A total of 454 Aeta families in Floridablanca, Pampanga, received their Certificate of Ancestral Domain Title (CADT) on May 27, 2009. The title covers about 7,440 hectares in San Marcelino and Brgy. Batiawan in Zambales and barangays Mawakat and Nabuklod in Floridablanca. It was the first time clean ancestral domain titles were distributed by the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP).

A CADT was awarded to 1,501 Aeta families in Botolan, Zambales, on January 14, 2010. The area covers 15,860 hectares that include the four barangays of Villar, Burgos, Moraza and Belbel in Botolan, Zambales.

The Aeta Abellen community of Sitio Maporac, Barangay New San Juan, Cabangan, Zambales, received the first Philippine&#x27;s first Certificate of Ancestral Domain Claim (CADC) on March 8, 1996. The CADT was acquired 16 years later in December 2010.

On May 31, 2022, 848 Aeta families belonging to the Ayta Mag-indi and Ayta Mag-antsi groups were issued their CADT by the NCIP, after the title was approved in 2009. The CADT covers the Pampanga towns of Camias, Diaz, Inararo, Villa Maria and Sapang Uwak in Porac; Sapang Bato in Angeles City; and parts of Floridablanca. The CADT also includes San Marcelino town in Zambales.

Dumagat-Remontado communities inhabit the Sierra Madre mountain range in Rizal and Quezon. Their ancestral domain claims cover parts of the Sierra Madre mountain range. A CADT was issued to Dumagat families in Gabaldon town, Nueva Ecija, in December 2021.

Nevertheless, Aeta communities face difficulties in getting ancestral domain titles. Aetas of Tarlac, for example, have failed to get titles for 18,000 hectares of land in Capas despite applications for CADT filed in 1999, 2014, and 2019.

==Lifestyle==
The Aeta are nomadic and build only temporary shelters made of sticks driven to the ground and covered with the palm of banana leaves. The more modernized Aetas have moved to villages and areas of cleared mountains. They live in houses made of bamboo and cogon grass.

Mining, deforestation, illegal logging, and slash-and-burn farming have caused the indigenous population in the country to steadily decrease to the point where they number only in the thousands today. The Philippine government affords them little or no protection, and the Aeta have become extremely nomadic due to social and economic strain on their culture and way of life that had previously remained unchanged for thousands of years.
As hunter-gatherers, adaptation plays an important role in Aeta communities to survive. This often includes gaining knowledge about the tropical forest that they live in, the typhoon cycles that travel through their area, and other seasonal weather changes that affect the behavior of the flora and fauna in their location. Another important survival skill is storytelling. Like many other hunter-gatherer societies, the Aeta promote social values, such as cooperation, through stories. Thus, they highly value skilled storytellers.
Dry season for many Aeta communities means intense work. They not only hunt and fish more, the start of the dry season also means swiddening the land for future harvest. While the clearing of land is done by both men and women, Aeta women tend to do most of the harvesting. During this period, they also do business transactions with non-Aeta communities living around the vicinity they temporarily settled in either to sell the food they gathered, or to work as temporary farmers or field laborers. Aeta women play more active roles in business transactions with non-Aeta communities, mostly as traders and agricultural workers for lowland farmers. While dry season typically means bountiful food for Aetas, rainy season (which often falls in the Philippines between September and December) often provides the opposite experience, considering the difficulties of traversing flooded and wet forests for hunting and gathering.

Aeta communities use different tools in their hunting and gathering activities. Traditional tools include traps, knives, and bow and arrow, with different types of arrow points for specialized purposes. Most Aetas are trained for hunting and gathering at age 15, including Aeta women. While men and some women typically use the standard bow and arrow, most Aeta women prefer knives and often hunt with their dogs and in groups to increase efficiency and for social reasons. Fishing and food gathering are also done by both males and females. In terms of gender, then, Aeta communities are more egalitarian in structure and in practice.

==Language==

All Aeta communities have adopted the language of their Austronesian Filipino neighbors, which have sometimes diverged over time to become different languages. These include, in order of number of speakers, Mag-indi, Mag-antsi, Abellen, Ambala, and Mariveleño. The second languages they speak are Kapampangan, Ilocano, and Tagalog; Kapampangan in Central Luzon, Ilocano in Cagayan Valley and northern areas of Central Luzon, and Tagalog in Central Luzon, Southern Tagalog, and other areas of Luzon.

==Religion==

===Indigenous monotheistic religion===
There are different views on the dominant character of the Aeta religion. Those who believe they are monotheistic argue that various Aeta tribes believe in a supreme being who rules over lesser spirits or deities, with the Aeta of Mt. Pinatubo worshipping &quot;Apo Na&quot;.
The Aetas are also animists. For example, the Pinatubo Aeta believe in environmental spirits. They believe that good and evil spirits inhabit the environment, such as the spirits of the river, sea, sky, mountain, hill, valley and other places. Kamana the forest spirit appears and disappears providing solace and hope during difficult times.

No special occasion is needed for the Aeta to pray, but there is a clear link between prayer and economic activities. The Aeta dance before and after a pig hunt. The night before Aeta women gather shellfish, they perform a dance which is partly an apology to the fish and partly a charm to ensure the catch. Similarly, the men hold a bee dance before and after the expeditions for honey.

===Indigenous polytheistic religion===
There are four manifestations of the &quot;great creator&quot; who rules the world: Tigbalog is the source of life and action; Lueve takes care of production and growth; Amas moves people to pity, love, unity, and peace of heart; while Binangewan is responsible for change, sickness, and death.

*Gutugutumakkan – The Supreme Being and Great Creator who have four manifestations, namely, Tigbalog, Lueve, Amas, and Binangewan.
*Kedes – The god of the hunt.
*Pawi – The god of the forest.
*Sedsed – The god of the sea.

===Christianity===
In the mid-1960s, missionaries of the American-based Evangelical Protestant mission group New Tribes Mission, in their effort to reach every Philippine tribal group with the Christian Gospel, reached out to the Agtas/Aetas. The mission agency provided education, including pastoral training for natives to reach members of their own tribe. Today, a large percentage of Agtas/Aetas of Zambales and Pampanga are Evangelicals. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses also have members among the Aeta people. (See 1993 Yearbook of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses)

==Clothing==
Their traditional clothing is very plain. The young women wear wrap around skirts. Elder women wear bark cloth, while elder men wear loin cloths. The old women of the Agta wear a bark cloth strip which passes between the legs, and is attached to a string around the waist. Today, most Aeta who have been in contact with lowlanders have adopted the T-shirts, pants and rubber sandals commonly used by the latter.

==Practices==
The Aetas are skillful in weaving and plaiting. Women exclusively weave winnows and mats. Only men make armlets. They also produce raincoats made of palm leaves whose bases surround the neck of the wearer, and whose topmost part spreads like a fan all around the body.

According to one study, &quot;About 85% of Philippine Aeta women hunt, and they hunt the same quarry as men. Aeta women hunt in groups and with dogs, and have a 31% success rate as opposed to 17% for men. Their rates are even better when they
combine forces with men: mixed hunting groups have a full 41% success rate among the Aeta.&quot;

==Medicine==

Aeta women are known around the country as experts of the herbal medicines.

Among the Aeta community in Ilagan, Isabela for example, banana leaves are used to cure toothache. They also bathe themselves with cooled-down water boiled with camphor leaves (&quot;subusob&quot;) to help alleviate fever, or they make herbal teas out of the camphor leaves that they then drink thrice a day if the fever and cold still persist. For muscle pains, they drink herbal teas extracted from &quot;kalulong&quot; leaves and have the patient take it thrice a day. In order to prevent relapse after giving birth, women also bathe themselves in cooled-down water boiled with &quot;sahagubit&quot; roots. The drinking of &quot;sahagubit&quot; herbal tea is likewise recommended to deworm Aeta children, or generally to alleviate stomachache. For birth control purposes, Aeta women drink wine made out of &quot;lukban&quot; (pomelo) root. They are, however, not advised to drink herbal tea from &quot;makahiya&quot; extract even if it&#x27;s also used to elevate stomachache problems due to the belief that it will cause abortion. The idea behind this is that like the closing of &quot;makahiya&quot; leaves once touched, the womb may also close once the &quot;makahiya&quot; touches it. The Aeta in Isabela also recommend drinking herbal tea out of wormwood (&quot;herbaca)&quot; leaves or stem to address women&#x27;s irregular menstrual cycle. They take herbal teas from lemon grass (&quot;barbaraniw&quot;) extract thrice a day to normalize blood pressure.

If the illness persists even after continuous drinking of recommended herbal medicine, that&#x27;s when they seek the help of an &quot;herbolario&quot; (or soothsayer). They do so because the Aeta believe that their illnesses are caused by a spirit that they may have offended, in which case herbal medicines or medical doctors won&#x27;t be able to address. In order to appease the spirits, they ask the &quot;herbolario&quot; to perform a ritual called &quot;ud- udung&quot;. In this ritual, the &quot;herbolario&quot; places rice or raw eggs on the patient&#x27;s forehead first to determine what causes the illness and repeats this several times to confirm. After the &quot;herbolario&quot; is satisfied, the patient will be asked to bathe with ricewash, and then to offer food to appease the offended spirit.

The Aeta communities take pride in their use of herbal medicines and their own natural ways of curing the sick. Finding their main source of herbal medicines in their habitat rather than buying costly medicines, emphasizing the mutual relationship with the nature, also has a great attitudinal impact pertaining to sustainability approach and practices in healthcare.

==Art==
A traditional form of visual art is body scarification. The Aetas intentionally wound the skin on their back, arms, breast, legs, hands, calves and abdomen, and then they irritate the wounds with fire, lime and other means to form scars.

Other &quot;decorative disfigurements&quot; include the chipping of the teeth. With the use of a file, the Dumagat modify their teeth during late puberty. The teeth are dyed black a few years afterwards.

The Aetas generally use ornaments typical of people living in subsistence economies. Flowers and leaves are used as earplugs for certain occasions. Girdles, necklaces, and neckbands of braided rattan incorporated with wild pig bristles are frequently worn.

==Music==
The Aeta have a musical heritage consisting of various types of agung ensembles, ensembles composed of large hanging, suspended or held, bossed/knobbed gongs, which act as drone, without any accompanying melodic instrument.

== Traditional political organization ==
While the father is normally the figurehead of the family, Aeta communities or bands traditionally had an anarchic political structure wherein they don&#x27;t have appointed chiefs to exercise authority over them. Individual Aeta is on equal grounds with the other and their main course of social interaction is through their tradition. It&#x27;s also the tradition, and not constituted laws, that maintain the equality among them and guide their way of life. They do have groups of elders in their community, called &quot;pisen,&quot; who they tend to go to when it comes to arbitrating decisions. However, the decisions made by the elders only remain in advisory capacity and no one could force any individual to follow those decisions. Their guiding principle and conflict resolution is through a sustained deliberation.

Over time, this egalitarian political structure was disturbed due to recurring contacts with the lowland Filipinos wherein the local officials and individuals they interact with forced Aeta communities to create government structure resembling those in the lowlands. At times, Aeta communities do organize themselves in government-like system with a &quot;Capitan&quot; (Captain), &quot;Conseyal&quot; (Council) and &quot;Policia&quot; (Police). But mostly, they resist such imposed organization. In particular, they refuse to appoint a chief (or a president) that will govern them although they do have one elder that takes the responsibility of leadership. This informal kind of government can also be found in their judicial process. When someone in their community did something wrong, they would deliberate about it, but more importantly, they do not talk about what kind of punishment they will hand to the wrong-doer. Instead, the deliberation is about understanding the motivation behind the action and prevent the consequence of the action from developing into something worse. Young men and women are excluded from the deliberation process. In this particular case, women are also largely excluded from the deliberation process even when they are allowed to attend the hearing or even when sometimes they can make their opinion about the problem. For the most part, women are not given room within the decision making process because the Aeta communities also follow a strict gender role where women are mostly expected take care of the children and the husband.

<doc id="1266095" wikidata="Q1401388" url="?curid=1266095" title="Fehu">
<text>Fehu is the reconstructed Proto-Germanic name for the rune  (; ), found as the first rune in all futharks (runic alphabets starting with F, U, Þ, Ą, R, K), i.e. the Germanic Elder Futhark, the Anglo-Frisian Futhark and the Norse Younger Futhark, with continued use in the later medieval runes, early modern runes and Dalecarlian runes.

It corresponds to the letter f in the Latin alphabet, but it can periodically shift into the sound value of v (compare &quot;leaf&quot; and &quot;leaves&quot;).

== Character ==
The shape of the rune is likely based on Etruscan &quot;v&quot; ⟨𐌅⟩ ⟨⟩, like Greek Digamma ⟨⟩ and Latin ⟨F⟩ ultimately from Phoenician waw ⟨⟩.

The change of the bistaves pointing upward could stem from visually diverging it from the rune ᚨ, as well as linking it visually to the horns of cattle (see ).

== Name ==
The root name is an ancient word for &quot;livestock&quot;. Compare (&quot;livestock, animal&quot;), (&quot;livestock, cattle&quot;), (&quot;livestock&quot;), , &quot;pecūs&quot; (&quot;livestock&quot;), (&quot;paṧu&quot;, &quot;livestock, cattle&quot;). By extension, it also means &#x27;(loose) wealth&#x27; and thereof, thus surviving as &quot;fee&quot; in English with the meaning of &quot;payment compensating for rights or services&quot;.

The Proto-Germanic name has been reconstructed, with the meaning of &quot;livestock, cattle&quot; and by extension &quot;wealth&quot;.

The corresponding letter of the Gothic alphabet is ⟨𐍆⟩ ⟨f⟩, called . Such correspondence between all rune poems and the Gothic letter name, as well, is uncommon, and gives the reconstructed name of the Old Futhark a high degree of certainty.

== Rune poems ==
The name is recorded in all three rune poems:

Old Norwegian:
Old Icelandic:
Anglo-Saxon:

<doc id="1266098" wikidata="Q158035" url="?curid=1266098" title="Impatiens glandulifera">
<text>Impatiens glandulifera, Himalayan balsam, is a large annual plant native to the Himalayas. Via human introduction it is now present across much of the Northern Hemisphere and is considered an invasive species in many areas. Uprooting or cutting the plants is an effective means of control.

In Europe, Himalayan balsam has been included since 2017 in the list of Invasive Alien Species of Union concern (the Union list). This implies that the species cannot be imported, cultivated, transported, commercialized, planted, or intentionally released into the environment in the whole of the European Union.

==Etymology==
The common names Himalayan balsam and kiss-me-on-the-mountain refer to the plant&#x27;s native Himalayan mountains. Ornamental jewelweed refers to its cultivation as an ornamental plant.

The specific epithet &quot;glandulifera&quot; is a compound word from &quot;glándula&quot; meaning &#x27;small gland&#x27;, and &quot;ferre&quot; meaning &#x27;to bear&#x27;.

==Description==

It typically grows to high, with a soft green or red-tinged stem, and lanceolate leaves long. The crushed foliage has a strong musty smell. Below the leaf stems the plant has glands that produce a sticky, sweet-smelling, and edible nectar. The flowers are pink, with a hooded shape, 3 to 4 cm ( to  in) tall and 2 cm ( in) broad; the flower shape has been compared to a policeman&#x27;s helmet.

After flowering between June and October, the plant forms seed pods 2 to 3 cm ( to  in) long and 8 mm broad ( in), which explode when disturbed, scattering the seeds up to .

The green seed pods, seeds, young leaves and shoots are all edible. The flowers can be turned into a jam or parfait.

The plant was rated in first place for per day nectar production per flower in a UK plants survey conducted by the AgriLand project which is supported by the UK Insect Pollinators Initiative. However, when number of flowers per floral unit, flower abundance, and phenology were taken into account, it dropped out of the top ten for most nectar per unit cover per year, as did all plants that placed in the top ten for per-day nectar production per flower, with the exception of common comfrey (&quot;Symphytum officinale).&quot;

==Distribution and habitat==
Himalayan balsam is native to the Himalayas, specifically to the areas between Kashmir and Uttarakhand. In its native range it is usually found at altitudes between 2000 and 2500 m above sea level, although it has been reported at up to 4000 m above sea level.

In Europe the plant was first introduced into the United Kingdom by John Forbes Royle, professor of medicine at King&#x27;s College, London who became Superintendent of the Botanic Gardens, Saharanpur, India. It has now become naturalized and widespread across riverbanks. At present it can be found almost everywhere across the continent.

In North America it has been found in the Canadian provinces of British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland. In the United States it is found on both the east and west coast, seemingly restricted to northern latitudes.

In New Zealand it is sometimes found growing wild along riverbanks and wetlands.

==Invasive species==
Himalayan balsam is sometimes cultivated for its flowers. It is now widely established in other parts of the world (such as the British Isles and North America), in some cases becoming a weed. Its aggressive seed dispersal, coupled with high nectar production which attracts pollinators, often allows it to out-compete native plants. Himalayan balsam also promotes river bank erosion due to the plant dying back over winter, leaving the bank unprotected from flooding. Invasive Himalayan balsam can also adversely affect indigenous species by attracting pollinators (e.g. insects) at the expense of indigenous species. It is considered a &quot;prohibited noxious weed&quot; under the &quot;Alberta Weed Control Act 2010&quot;.

In the UK, the plant was first introduced in 1839, at the same time as giant hogweed and Japanese knotweed. These plants were all promoted at the time as having the virtues of &quot;herculean proportions&quot; and &quot;splendid invasiveness&quot; which meant that ordinary people could buy them for the cost of a packet of seeds to rival the expensive orchids grown in the greenhouses of the rich. Within ten years, however, Himalayan balsam had escaped from the confines of cultivation and begun to spread along the river systems of England.

It has now spread across most of the UK, and some local wildlife trusts organise &quot;balsam bashing&quot; events to help control the plant. However, a study by Hejda and Pyšek (2006) concluded that, in some circumstances, such efforts may cause more harm than good. Destroying riparian stands of Himalayan balsam can open up the habitat for more aggressive invasive plants such as Japanese knotweed and aid in seed dispersal by dropped seeds sticking to shoes. Riparian habitat is suboptimal for &quot;I. glandulifera&quot;, and spring or autumn flooding destroys seeds and plants. The research suggests that the best way to control the spread of riparian Himalayan balsam is to decrease eutrophication, thereby permitting the better-adapted local vegetation, that gets outgrown by the balsam on watercourses with high nutrient load, to rebound naturally. The researchers caution that their conclusions probably do not hold true for stands of the plant at forest edges and meadow habitats, where manual destruction is still the best approach.

The Bionic Control of Invasive Weeds project, in Wiesbaden, Germany, is trying to establish a self-sufficient means of conserving their local biodiversity by developing several food products made from the Himalayan balsam flowers. If all goes well, the project will have it financing its own eradication.

In August 2014, CABI released a rust fungus in Berkshire, Cornwall and Middlesex in the United Kingdom as part of field trials into the biological control of Himalayan balsam.

Some research also suggests that &quot;I. glandulifera&quot; may exhibit allelopathy, which means that it excretes toxins that negatively affect neighboring plants, thus increasing its competitive advantage.

The Royal Horticultural Society and the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology recommend that pulling and cutting is the main method of non-chemical control, and usually the most appropriate. Natural Resources Wales has used manual methods, such as pulling plants and using strimmers, to largely eradicate Himalayan balsam from reaches of the River Ystwyth.

==Uses==
Himalayan Balsam is edible, but should be eaten in moderation as it contains oxalates

<text>The General Electric/Allison J35 was the United States Air Force&#x27;s first axial-flow (straight-through airflow) compressor jet engine. Originally developed by General Electric (GE company designation TG-180) in parallel with the Whittle-based centrifugal-flow J33, the J35 was a fairly simple turbojet, consisting of an eleven-stage axial-flow compressor and a single-stage turbine. With the afterburner, which most models carried, it produced a thrust of .

Like the J33, the design of the J35 originated at General Electric, but major production was by the Allison Engine Company.

==Design and development==
While developing the T31 axial turboprop in 1943 General Electric realized that they had the resources to design an axial flow turbojet at the same time as their centrifugal-flow J33 engine. They recognized the axial would have more potential for the future and went ahead with the TG-180 engine. GE axial compressor designs were developed from the NACA 8-stage compressor.

The engine had its starter and accessories (fuel control, fuel pump, oil pumps, hydraulic pump, RPM generator) mounted in the center of the compressor inlet. This accessory layout, as used on centrifugal engines, restricted the area available for compressor inlet air. It was carried over to the J47 but revised (relocated to an external gearbox) on the J73 when a increase in airflow was required. It also had an inlet debris guard which was common on early jet engines.

GE developed a variable afterburner for the engine, although electronic control linked with engine controls had to wait until the J47. Marrett describes one of the potential consequences of manual control of the engine and afterburner on a turbine engine: if the afterburner lit but the pilot failed to ensure the nozzle opened, the RPM governor could overfuel the engine until the turbine failed.

==Operational history==
The General Electric J35 first flew in the Republic XP-84 Thunderjet in 1946. Late in 1947, complete responsibility for the development and production of the engine was transferred to the Allison Division of the General Motors Corporation and some J35s were also built by GM&#x27;s Chevrolet division. More than 14,000 J35s had been built by the time production ended in 1955.

The J35 was used to power the Bell X-5 variable-sweep research aircraft and various prototypes such as the Douglas XB-43 Jetmaster, North American XB-45 Tornado, Convair XB-46, Boeing XB-47 Stratojet, Martin XB-48, and Northrop YB-49. It is probably best known, however, as the engine used in two of the leading fighters of the United States Air Force (USAF) in the 1950s: the Republic F-84 Thunderjet and the Northrop F-89 Scorpion.

A largely redesigned development, the J35-A-23, was later produced as the Allison J71, developing thrust.

<text>Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is a computational method used for simulating the mechanics of continuum media, such as solid mechanics and fluid flows. It was developed by Gingold and Monaghan and Lucy in 1977, initially for astrophysical problems. It has been used in many fields of research, including astrophysics, ballistics, volcanology, and oceanography. It is a meshfree Lagrangian method (where the co-ordinates move with the fluid), and the resolution of the method can easily be adjusted with respect to variables such as density.

== Method ==

=== Advantages ===

* By construction, SPH is a meshfree method, which makes it ideally suited to simulate problems dominated by complex boundary dynamics, like free surface flows, or large boundary displacement.
* The lack of a mesh significantly simplifies the model implementation and its parallelization, even for many-core architectures.

* SPH can be easily extended to a wide variety of fields, and hybridized with some other models, as discussed in Modelling Physics.
* As discussed in section on weakly compressible SPH, the method has great conservation features.
* The computational cost of SPH simulations per number of particles is significantly less than the cost of grid-based simulations per number of cells when the metric of interest is related to fluid density (e.g., the probability density function of density fluctuations). This is the case because in SPH the resolution is put where the matter is.

=== Limitations ===

* Setting boundary conditions in SPH such as inlets and outlets and walls is more difficult than with grid-based methods. In fact, it has been stated that &quot;the treatment of boundary conditions is certainly one of the most difficult technical points of the SPH method&quot;. This challenge is partly because in SPH the particles near the boundary change with time. Nonetheless, wall boundary conditions for SPH are available. 
* The computational cost of SPH simulations per number of particles is significantly larger than the cost of grid-based simulations per number of cells when the metric of interest is not (directly) related to density (e.g., the kinetic-energy spectrum). Therefore, overlooking issues of parallel speedup, the simulation of constant-density flows (e.g., external aerodynamics) is more efficient with grid-based methods than with SPH.

== Examples ==

=== Fluid dynamics ===

Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics is being increasingly used to model fluid motion as well. This is due to several benefits over traditional grid-based techniques. First, SPH guarantees conservation of mass without extra computation since the particles themselves represent mass. Second, SPH computes pressure from weighted contributions of neighboring particles rather than by solving linear systems of equations. Finally, unlike grid-based techniques, which must track fluid boundaries, SPH creates a free surface for two-phase interacting fluids directly since the particles represent the denser fluid (usually water) and empty space represents the lighter fluid (usually air). For these reasons, it is possible to simulate fluid motion using SPH in real time. However, both grid-based and SPH techniques still require the generation of renderable free surface geometry using a polygonization technique such as metaballs and marching cubes, point splatting, or &#x27;carpet&#x27; visualization. For gas dynamics it is more appropriate to use the kernel function itself to produce a rendering of gas column density (e.g., as done in the SPLASH visualisation package).

One drawback over grid-based techniques is the need for large numbers of particles to produce simulations of equivalent resolution. In the typical implementation of both uniform grids and SPH particle techniques, many voxels or particles will be used to fill water volumes that are never rendered. However, accuracy can be significantly higher with sophisticated grid-based techniques, especially those coupled with particle methods (such as particle level sets), since it is easier to enforce the incompressibility condition in these systems. SPH for fluid simulation is being used increasingly in real-time animation and games where accuracy is not as critical as interactivity.

Recent work in SPH for fluid simulation has increased performance, accuracy, and areas of application:

* B. Solenthaler, 2009, develops Predictive-Corrective SPH (PCISPH) to allow for better incompressibility constraints
* M. Ihmsen et al., 2010, introduce boundary handling and adaptive time-stepping for PCISPH for accurate rigid body interactions
* K. Bodin et al., 2011, replace the standard equation of state pressure with a density constraint and apply a variational time integrator
* R. Hoetzlein, 2012, develops efficient GPU-based SPH for large scenes in Fluids v.3
* N. Akinci et al., 2012, introduce a versatile boundary handling and two-way SPH-rigid coupling technique that is completely based on hydrodynamic forces; the approach is applicable to different types of SPH solvers
* M. Macklin et al., 2013 simulates incompressible flows inside the Position Based Dynamics framework, for bigger timesteps
* N. Akinci et al., 2013, introduce a versatile surface tension and two-way fluid-solid adhesion technique that allows simulating a variety of interesting physical effects that are observed in reality
* J. Kyle and E. Terrell, 2013, apply SPH to Full-Film Lubrication
* A. Mahdavi and N. Talebbeydokhti, 2015, propose a hybrid algorithm for implementation of solid boundary condition and simulate flow over a sharp crested weir
* S. Tavakkol et al., 2016, develop curvSPH, which makes the horizontal and vertical size of particles independent and generates uniform mass distribution along curved boundaries
* W. Kostorz and A. Esmail-Yakas, 2020, propose a general, efficient and simple method for evaluating normalization factors near piecewise-planar boundaries
* Colagrossi et al., 2019, study flow around a cylinder close to a free-surface and compare with other techniques

=== Astrophysics ===

Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics&#x27;s adaptive resolution, numerical conservation of physically conserved quantities, and ability to simulate phenomena covering many orders of magnitude make it ideal for computations in theoretical astrophysics.

Simulations of galaxy formation, star formation, stellar collisions, supernovae and meteor impacts are some of the wide variety of astrophysical and cosmological uses of this method.

SPH is used to model hydrodynamic flows, including possible effects of gravity. Incorporating other astrophysical processes which may be important, such as radiative transfer and magnetic fields is an active area of research in the astronomical community, and has had some limited success.

=== Solid mechanics ===

Libersky and Petschek
extended SPH to Solid Mechanics. The main advantage of SPH in this application is the possibility of dealing with larger local distortion than grid-based methods.
This feature has been exploited in many applications in Solid Mechanics: metal forming, impact, crack growth, fracture, fragmentation, etc.

Another important advantage of meshfree methods in general, and of SPH in particular, is that mesh dependence problems are naturally avoided given the meshfree nature of the method. In particular, mesh alignment is related to problems involving cracks and it is avoided in SPH due to the isotropic support of the kernel functions. However, classical SPH formulations suffer from tensile instabilities
and lack of consistency.
Over the past years, different corrections have been introduced to improve the accuracy of the SPH solution, leading to the RKPM by Liu et al.
Randles and Libersky
and Johnson and Beissel
tried to solve the consistency problem in their study of impact phenomena.

Dyka et al.
and Randles and Libersky
introduced the stress-point integration into SPH and Ted Belytschko et al.
showed that the stress-point technique removes the instability due to spurious singular modes, while tensile instabilities can be avoided by using a Lagrangian kernel. Many other recent studies can be found in the literature devoted to improve the convergence of the SPH method.

Recent improvements in understanding the convergence and stability of SPH have allowed for more widespread applications in Solid Mechanics. Other examples of applications and developments of the method include:

* Metal forming simulations.
* SPH-based method SPAM (Smoothed Particle Applied Mechanics) for impact fracture in solids by William G. Hoover.
* Modified SPH (SPH/MLSPH) for fracture and fragmentation.
* Taylor-SPH (TSPH) for shock wave propagation in solids.
* Generalized coordinate SPH (GSPH) allocates particles inhomogeneously in the Cartesian coordinate system and arranges them via mapping in a generalized coordinate system in which the particles are aligned at a uniform spacing.

== Numerical tools ==

=== Interpolations ===

The Smoothed-Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method works by dividing the fluid into a set of discrete moving elements formula_1, referred to as particles. Their Lagrangian nature allows setting their position formula_2 by integration of their velocity formula_3 as:

:formula_4

These particles interact through a kernel function with characteristic radius known as the &quot;smoothing length&quot;, typically represented in equations by formula_5. This means that the physical quantity of any particle can be obtained by summing the relevant properties of all the particles that lie within the range of the kernel, the latter being used as a weighting function formula_6. This can be understood in two steps. First an arbitrary field formula_7 is written as a convolution with formula_6:

:formula_9

The error in making the above approximation is order formula_10. Secondly, the integral is approximated using a Riemann summation over the particles:

:formula_11

where the summation over formula_12 includes all particles in the simulation. formula_13 is the volume of particle formula_12, formula_15 is the value of the quantity formula_7 for particle formula_12 and formula_18 denotes position. For example, the density formula_19 of particle formula_20 can be expressed as:

:formula_21

where formula_22 denotes the particle mass and formula_23 the particle density, while formula_24 is a short notation for formula_25. The error done in approximating the integral by a discrete sum depends on formula_5, on the particle size (i.e. formula_27, formula_28 being the space dimension), and on the particle arrangement in space. The latter effect is still poorly known.

Kernel functions commonly used include the Gaussian function, the quintic spline and the Wendland formula_29 kernel. The latter two kernels are compactly supported (unlike the Gaussian, where there is a small contribution at any finite distance away), with support proportional to formula_5. This has the advantage of saving computational effort by not including the relatively minor contributions from distant particles.

Although the size of the smoothing length can be fixed in both space and time, this does not take advantage of the full power of SPH. By assigning each particle its own smoothing length and allowing it to vary with time, the resolution of a simulation can be made to automatically adapt itself depending on local conditions. For example, in a very dense region where many particles are close together, the smoothing length can be made relatively short, yielding high spatial resolution. Conversely, in low-density regions where individual particles are far apart and the resolution is low, the smoothing length can be increased, optimising the computation for the regions of interest.

=== Discretization of governing equations ===

For particles of constant mass, differentiating the interpolated density formula_19 with respect to time yields

:formula_32

where formula_33 is the gradient of formula_34 with respect to formula_35. Comparing this equation with the continuity equation in the Lagrangian description (using material derivatives),

:formula_36

it is apparent that its right-hand side is an approximation of formula_37; hence one defines a discrete divergence operator as follows:

:formula_38

This operator gives an SPH approximation of formula_39 at the particle formula_20 for a given set of particles with given masses formula_41, positions formula_42 and velocities formula_43.

The other important equation for a compressible inviscid fluid is the Euler equation for momentum balance:

:formula_44

Similarly to continuity, the task is to define a discrete gradient operator in order to write

:formula_45

One choice is

:formula_46

which has the property of being skew-adjoint with the divergence operator above, in the sense that

:formula_47

this being a discrete version of the continuum identity

:formula_48

This property leads to nice conservation properties.

Notice also that this choice leads to a symmetric divergence operator and antisymmetric gradient. Although there are several ways of discretizing the pressure gradient in the Euler equations, the above antisymmetric form is the most acknowledged one. It supports strict conservation of linear and angular momentum. This means that a force that is exerted on particle formula_49 by particle formula_50 equals the one that is exerted on particle formula_50 by particle formula_49 including the sign change of the effective direction, thanks to the antisymmetry property formula_33.

Nevertheless, other operators have been proposed, which may perform better numerically or physically.
For instance, one drawback of these operators is that while the divergence formula_54 is zero-order consistent (i.e. yields zero when applied to a constant vector field), it can be seen that the gradient formula_55 is not. Several techniques have been proposed to circumvent this issue, leading to renormalized operators (see e.g.).

=== Variational principle ===

The above SPH governing equations can be derived from a least action principle, starting from the Lagrangian of a particle system:

:formula_56,

where formula_57 is the particle specific internal energy. The Euler–Lagrange equation of variational mechanics reads, for each particle:

:formula_58

When applied to the above Lagrangian, it gives the following momentum equation:

:formula_59

where the chain rule has been used, since formula_57 depends on formula_23, and the latter, on the position of the particles.
Using the thermodynamic property formula_62 we may write

:formula_63

Plugging the SPH density interpolation and differentiating explicitly formula_64 leads to

:formula_65

which is the SPH momentum equation already mentioned, where we recognize the formula_55 operator. This explains why linear momentum is conserved, and allows conservation of angular momentum and energy to be conserved as well.

=== Time integration ===

From the work done in the 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s on numerical integration of point-like particles in large accelerators, appropriate time integrators have been developed with accurate conservation properties on the long term; they are called symplectic integrators. The most popular in the SPH literature is the leapfrog scheme, which reads for each particle formula_20:

:formula_68

where formula_69 is the time step, superscripts stand for time iterations while formula_70 is the particle acceleration, given by the right-hand side of the momentum equation.

Other symplectic integrators exist (see the reference textbook). It is recommended to use a symplectic (even low-order) scheme instead of a high order non-symplectic scheme, to avoid error accumulation after many iterations.

Integration of density has not been studied extensively (see below for more details).

Symplectic schemes are conservative but explicit, thus their numerical stability requires stability conditions, analogous to the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition (see below).

=== Boundary techniques ===

In case the SPH convolution shall be practiced close to a boundary, i.e. closer than , then the integral support is truncated. Indeed, when the convolution is affected by a boundary, the convolution shall be split in 2 integrals,

:formula_71

where is the compact support ball centered at , with radius , and denotes the part of the compact support inside the computational domain, . Hence, imposing boundary conditions in SPH is completely based on approximating the second integral on the right hand side. The same can be of course applied to the differential operators computation,

:formula_72

Several techniques has been introduced in the past to model boundaries in SPH.

==== Integral neglect ====

The most straightforward boundary model is neglecting the integral,

:formula_73

such that just the bulk interactions are taken into account,

:formula_74

This is a popular approach when free-surface is considered in monophase simulations.

The main benefit of this boundary condition is its obvious simplicity. However, several consistency issues shall be considered when this boundary technique is applied. That&#x27;s in fact a heavy limitation on its potential applications.

==== Fluid Extension ====

Probably the most popular methodology, or at least the most traditional one, to impose boundary conditions in SPH, is Fluid Extension technique. Such technique is based on populating the compact support across the boundary with so-called ghost particles, conveniently imposing their field values.

Along this line, the integral neglect methodology can be considered as a particular case of fluid extensions, where the field, , vanish outside the computational domain.

The main benefit of this methodology is the simplicity, provided that the boundary contribution is computed as part of the bulk interactions. Also, this methodology has been deeply analyzed in the literature.

On the other hand, deploying ghost particles in the truncated domain is not a trivial task, such that modelling complex boundary shapes becomes cumbersome. The 2 most popular approaches to populate the empty domain with ghost particles are Mirrored-Particles and Fixed-Particles.

==== Boundary Integral ====

The newest Boundary technique is the Boundary Integral methodology. In this methodology, the empty volume integral is replaced by a surface integral, and a renormalization:

:formula_75
:formula_76

with the normal of the generic &quot;j&quot;-th boundary element. The surface term can be also solved considering a semi-analytic expression.

=== Hydrodynamics ===
==== Weakly compressible approach ====

Another way to determine the density is based on the SPH smoothing operator itself. Therefore, the density is estimated from the particle distribution utilizing the SPH interpolation. To overcome undesired errors at the free surface through kernel truncation, the density formulation can again be integrated in time.
The weakly compressible SPH in fluid dynamics is based on the discretization of the Navier–Stokes equations or Euler equations for compressible fluids. To close the system, an appropriate equation of state is utilized to link pressure formula_77 and density formula_78. Generally, the so-called Cole equation

(sometimes mistakenly referred to as the &quot;Tait equation&quot;) is used in SPH. It reads
:formula_79

where formula_80 is the reference density and formula_81 the speed of sound. For water, formula_82 is commonly used. The background pressure formula_83 is added to avoid negative pressure values.

Real nearly incompressible fluids such as water are characterized by very high speeds of sound of the order formula_84. Hence, pressure information travels fast compared to the actual bulk flow, which leads to very small Mach numbers formula_85. The momentum equation leads to the following relation:
:formula_86

stands for the gradient of the kernel function evaluated at the initial reference configuration. 
Note that subscripts formula_87 and formula_88 are used to denote solid particles, and smoothing length formula_5 is identical to that in the discretization of fluid equations.

Using the initial configuration as the reference, the solid density is directly evaluated as

where formula_90 is the Jacobian determinant of deformation tensor formula_91.

We can now discretize the momentum equation in the following form

{\text{d}t} = 2 \sum_b V_a V_b \tilde{\mathbb{P}}_{ab} \nabla_a^0 W_{ab} +\mathbf{g} + \mathbf{f}_a^{F:p} + \mathbf{f}_a^{F:v} &lt;/math&gt;|}}

where inter-particle averaged first Piola-Kirchhoff stress formula_92 
is defined as

Also formula_93 and formula_94 correspond to the fluid pressure and viscous forces acting on the solid particle formula_87, respectively.

==== Fluid-structure coupling ====

In fluid-structure coupling, the surrounding solid structure is behaving as a moving boundary for fluid, and the no-slip boundary condition is imposed at the fluid-structure interface. The interaction forces formula_96 and formula_97 acting on a fluid particle formula_20, due to the presence of the neighboring solid particle formula_87, can be obtained as 

and

{{NumBlk|:|formula_100|{{EquationRef|6}}}}

Here, the imaginary pressure formula_101 and velocity formula_102 are defined by

{{NumBlk|:|formula_103|{{EquationRef|7}}}}

where formula_104 denotes the surface normal direction of the solid structure, 
and the imaginary particle density formula_105 is calculated through the equation of state.

Accordingly, the interaction forces formula_93 and formula_94 acting on a solid particle formula_87 are given by

{{NumBlk|:|formula_109|{{EquationRef|8}}}}

and

{{NumBlk|:|formula_110|{{EquationRef|9}}}}

The anti-symmetric property of the derivative of the kernel function will ensure the momentum conservation for each pair of interacting particles formula_20 and formula_87.

<text>Helen Brooke Taussig (May 24, 1898 – May 20, 1986) was an American cardiologist, working in Baltimore and Boston, who founded the field of pediatric cardiology. She is credited with developing the concept for a procedure that would extend the lives of children born with Tetralogy of Fallot (the most common cause of blue baby syndrome). This concept was applied in practice as a procedure known as the Blalock-Thomas-Taussig shunt. The procedure was developed by Alfred Blalock and Vivien Thomas, who were Taussig&#x27;s colleagues at the Johns Hopkins Hospital.

Taussig was partially deaf following an ear infection in childhood; in early adulthood this progressed to full deafness. To compensate for her loss of hearing, she learned to use lip-reading techniques and hearing aids to speak with her patients. Taussing also developed a method of using her fingers, rather than a stethoscope, to feel the rhythm of their heartbeats. Some of her innovations have been attributed to her ability to diagnose heart problems by touch rather than by sound.

Taussig is also known for her work in banning thalidomide and was widely recognized as a highly skilled physician. She was the first woman to be elected head of the American Heart Association. She was more proud of the fact that she was the first pediatrician to be elected head of the AMA; and in 1964 she was awarded a Presidential Medal of Freedom.

==Early life and education==
Helen Brooke Taussig was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on May 24, 1898, to F. W. Taussig and Edith Thomas Guild, the youngest of four children. Her father was an economist at Harvard University, and her mother was one of the first students at Radcliffe College, a women&#x27;s college.

She spent summers as a child in Cotuit, Massachusetts, and later in life had a home there.

When Taussig was 11 years old, her mother died of tuberculosis. Helen also contracted the disease and was ill for several years, severely affecting her ability to do schoolwork. She also struggled with severe dyslexia through her early school years and was partially deaf. Despite this, she did well at school due to diligent work and extensive tutoring from her father.

She graduated from Cambridge School for Girls in 1917, then studied for two years at Radcliffe College before earning a bachelor&#x27;s degree and Phi Beta Kappa membership from the University of California, Berkeley in 1921.

After graduating, Taussig wished to study at Harvard Medical School, but the medical program did not accept women (this was the case until 1945, though the first woman had applied nearly 100 years earlier, in 1847); the program accepted women in theory but would not give them a degree. When Taussig was told this by the dean of the medical school, she asked why anyone would want to attend without any hope of getting a degree, to which the dean replied, &quot;That is what we are hoping.&quot; Taussig responded, &quot;Well, I shall not be the first to disappoint you&quot;, and left. Instead she considered applying to study public health, partially because her father thought it a more suitable field for women, 

Taussig ended up taking classes at Boston University in histology, bacteriology, and anatomy, without expecting to receive a degree. She was required to sit at the rear of the lecture hall apart from the male students and not speak to them. As an anatomy student at Boston University in 1925, she published her first scientific paper on studies of ox heart muscles with her professor Alexander Begg. 

With Begg&#x27;s encouragement, Taussig applied to transfer to the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, one of the few medical schools to admit women at the time, and was accepted as a full-degree candidate. She wanted to specialise in internal medicine, but the one position available for a woman in that specialization was already taken so she opted for pediatrics and the emerging field of pediatric cardiology. After attaining her Doctorate of Medicine in 1927, Taussig remained at Johns Hopkins as a cardiology fellow for one year and two years as a pediatrics intern and received two Archibald Fellowships. 

==Blalock-Thomas-Taussig shunt==

=== Concept ===
Taussig&#x27;s early career in pediatric cardiology at Johns Hopkins consisted of studying babies with congenital heart defects and rheumatic fever, an inflammation of the heart and other organs resulting from bacterial infection, which was at the time a major source of child mortality. In the early 20th century, rheumatic heart disease made up the majority of clinical cardiology work: congenital heart defects were considered hopeless curiosities as the surgical means to correct them were extremely undeveloped so relatively little could be done to prevent the early deaths of patients with these conditions.

She then was hired by the pediatric department of Johns Hopkins, the Harriet Lane Home, as its chief, where she served from 1930 until 1963. Taussig made use of fluoroscopy as a diagnostic tool, and developed a particular interest in infants with cyanosis (blue-tinged appearance), often caused by the heart defect Tetralogy of Fallot. Cyanosis is caused when insufficient oxygenated blood is circulating around the body; in infants it can be known as &quot;blue baby syndrome&quot;. Taussig is most remembered for her role in the development of a surgical treatment for this condition, the Blalock-Thomas-Taussig shunt.

A new surgery first performed in 1939 by Robert Gross corrected a common pediatric heart problem: patent ductus arteriosus. The ductus arteriosus is a small blood vessel connecting the pulmonary artery to the aorta of a foetus. Since the foetus obtains oxygen via the mother&#x27;s placenta and not via its own lungs, which are fluid-filled and not yet functional, this vessel provides a shortcut, bypassing the lungs and allowing more efficient delivery of oxygenated blood around the foetus&#x27; body. In most infants, the ductus arteriosus closes within a few weeks of birth so that blood flows to the lungs to be oxygenated; if it remains open or &#x27;patent&#x27;, the normal flow of blood is disrupted. This new surgical procedure artificially closed the blood vessel.

While this was going on, Taussig observed that infants with cyanotic heart defects such as Tetralogy of Fallot or pulmonary atresia often fared remarkably better if they also had a patent ductus arteriosus, with less severe symptoms and longer survival. In general, cyanotic symptoms would often begin or worsen shortly after birth, a change which Taussig suspected was caused by the natural closure of the ductus arteriosus. In cyanotic children, bloodflow from the heart to the lungs via the pulmonary artery is often compromised; Taussig thought that surgically creating an artificial ductus linking these two vessels could increase bloodflow to the lungs and alleviate this problem, increasing survival. She broached the idea to Robert Gross, and he was skeptical, reportedly telling her &quot;I have enough trouble closing the ductus arteriosus. I certainly don&#x27;t want to try to make an artificial one.&quot;

=== The first surgeries ===
Two years later, Taussig obtained the collaboration of Johns Hopkins&#x27; new chief of surgery Alfred Blalock and his laboratory assistant Vivien Thomas. The three of them developed a surgery now known as the Blalock-Thomas-Taussig shunt. Originally, it was referred to as the Blalock-Taussig shunt: the critical input of Vivien Thomas was overlooked because of his non-clinical role and because of his race.

Following extensive experimentation on about 200 dogs, on November 9, 1944, Blalock and Thomas performed the surgery on the first human patient. Eileen Saxon, a 15-month-old baby, had arrived at the emergency department earlier that month severely underweight at just 5 kg, purplish blue in colour and hardly able to drink a sip without gasping for breath. Taussig diagnosed her with Tetralogy of Fallot, a diagnosis which meant that without intervention she certainly would not survive to adulthood. The procedure was an immediate success: Eileen&#x27;s colour quickly returned to normal, she could drink milk more easily and gained a few kilograms. Two months after the surgery she was discharged from hospital. However, she became cyanotic again a few months later and died shortly before her second birthday. Despite Eileen&#x27;s death, the operation was proof that the Blalock-Thomas-Taussig shunt could in principle be used to extend the lives of children with cyanotic heart disease.

By 1945, this operation had been performed on a total of three infants with pulmonary stenosis and pulmonary atresia. As Alfred Blalock and Helen Taussig wrote in &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot;, &quot;Heretofore there has been no satisfactory treatment for pulmonary stenosis and pulmonary atresia. A &quot;blue&quot; baby with a malformed heart was considered beyond the reach of surgical aid. During the past three months we have operated on 3 children with severe degrees of pulmonary stenosis and each of the patients appears to be greatly benefited. In the second and third cases, in which there was deep persistent cyanosis, the cyanosis has greatly diminished or has disappeared and the general condition of the patients is proportionally improved.&quot; Following this report, and lectures given by Blalock and Taussig at conferences around Europe and America, the procedure quickly gained worldwide acceptance.

=== Legacy ===
With the international fame this surgery drew, parents worldwide began coming to Baltimore to have their &quot;blue babies&quot; treated by Blalock and Taussig. The rapid influx of prospective patients was so great that the clinic struggled to cope, and medical visitors from around the world came to assist and to share knowledge. By 1951, the team had operated on over 1,000 children and the surgery had a mortality rate of only 5%.

One of the major benefits of this surgery was that children gained the ability to play actively without the rapid exhaustion and frequent loss of consciousness that usually results from cyanotic heart defects. Helen Taussig reportedly kept a letter on her mantelpiece from twelve year old Jean-Pierre Cablan, written after undergoing the procedure: &quot;Je suis maintenant un tout autre petit garcon ... je vais pouvoir aller jouer avec mes petits camarades.&quot; (&quot;&quot;I am now a completely new boy... I will be able to play with the other children&quot;.&quot;) Often, an immediate improvement in the level of cyanosis could be seen as well. Taussig later recalled, &quot;I suppose nothing would ever give me as much delight as seeing the first patient change from blue to pink in the operating room... bright pink cheeks and bright lips.&quot;

Nowadays, the Blalock-Thomas-Taussig shunt is useful for prolonging life and improving health in infants before heart defects can be definitively repaired, commonly as the first stage of the three-step Norwood Procedure. It allows infants to survive and gain weight before more complex surgeries are later attempted, and is used in the care of patients with Tetralogy of Fallot, pulmonary atresia, and more rare and complex abnormalities.

At the time of Taussig&#x27;s death, tens of thousands of children&#x27;s lives had been saved by the shunt procedure.

== Further career ==
As a physician, Taussig pioneered the use of x-rays and fluoroscopy simultaneously to examine changes in a baby&#x27;s heart and lungs in a less invasive manner, and was very skilled in diagnosing heart conditions by feeling the heartbeat with her fingertips, rather than listening with a stethoscope.

As well as her day to day clinical work as a paediatrician, Taussig was also an accomplished academic clinician. She published 100 academic articles over her career, considering various aspects of cardiology including biomedical ethics and the evolutionary origins of heart disease. In her research into the long-term outcomes of recipients of the shunt, Taussig remained in touch with many of her patients as they grew to adulthood and middle age.

In 1947, after a decade of gathering material, Taussig published her magnum opus, &quot;Congenital Malformations of the Heart&quot;, considered to be the foundational text of pediatric cardiology as an independent field. The book was expanded into two volumes for a second edition published in 1960.

Taussig later became an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine; she was promoted to full professor in 1959. At the time, she was only the second woman to reach full professor status at the university. She continued to serve as the director of the Harriet Lane Home (the children&#x27;s treatment and research centre at Johns Hopkins) until her retirement in 1963. Most paediatric clinics at the time focussed on rheumatic fever, which was the major source of child mortality, but because of Taussig&#x27;s experience, the Harriet Lane Home was also able to provide specialist care for children with congenital heart disease. It became a world-leading centre that aspiring surgeons flocked to.

Together with the cardiologist Richard Bing, Taussig was in 1949 the first to describe a heart condition now known as Taussig-Bing syndrome. This is the second most common type of double-outlet right ventricle (DORV), a set of rare congenital heart conditions in which the aorta, which is supposed to carry oxygen-rich blood from the left ventricle of the heart, instead is connected to the right ventricle and supplies oxygen-poor blood to the body. Several alternative methods for surgically correcting this defect have been tried over the decades since the problem was first described, and survival rates following surgical intervention are greatly improved in recent decades.

=== Banning of thalidomide ===
Around 1960, many more babies than usual began to be born in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands with phocomelia, a previously very rare condition in which limbs are absent or small and abnormally formed. The German paediatrician Widukind Lenz was the first to draw a link to the increasing frequency of this condition and thalidomide, a drug which was a popular sleeping medication at the time with the trade name Softenon, and was often taken by pregnant women to counter morning sickness. However, when it is taken between days 35 and 49 of a pregnancy, it blocks normal limb development and causes phocomelia.

After hearing about this issue from one of her students in January 1962, Taussig travelled to Germany and examined some of these children for herself. She reached the same conclusion as Lenz: that thalidomide taken during pregnancy was causing phocomelia. She flew back to America and launched a campaign to try to stop the pending approval of thalidomide by the FDA, speaking at the American College of Physicians, writing in journals and magazines, and testifying before Congress in 1967. Her and others&#x27; efforts paid off: the drug was banned in the United States and Europe.

==Retirement and death==
Taussig formally retired from Johns Hopkins in 1963, but continued to teach, give lectures, and lobby for various causes. In addition, she kept writing scientific papers (of the 129 total that Taussig wrote, 41 were after her retirement from Johns Hopkins). She advocated for the use of animals in medical research and for legalized abortion, as well as the benefits of palliative care and hospice.

In 1977, Taussig moved to a retirement community in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania. Ever active, she continued making periodic trips to the University of Delaware for research work. At the time of her death, she was researching the genetic basis for congenital heart defects in birds.

On May 20, 1986, four days short of her 88th birthday, Taussig was driving a group of friends to vote in a local election when her car collided with another vehicle at an intersection. She died about an hour later at Chester County Hospital, and donated her body to Johns Hopkins.

<text>Lotus berthelotii is a flowering plant endemic to the Canary Islands of Spain, in the genus &quot;Lotus&quot; of the pea family Fabaceae. Among its common names are lotus vine flower, parrot (or parrot&#x27;s) beak, pelican beak, and coral gem. This plant is widely cultivated but is either extinct in the wild or persists as a few individuals. In 1884 it was already classed as &quot;exceedingly rare&quot; and plant collection probably hastened its decline.

==Description==

&quot;Lotus berthelotii&quot; is an evergreen prostrate shrub or subshrub, growing to with a creeping or trailing habit. The leaves are divided into 3-5 slender leaflets, each leaflet 1–2 cm long and 1 mm broad, densely covered with fine silvery hairs. The flowers are orange-red to red, shaped like upward facing beaks on short stalks, but slender, 2–4 cm long and 5–8 mm broad.

==Pollination==
The flowers of &quot;Lotus berthelotii&quot; and some other Canary Island species appear to be adapted for bird pollination. It was once thought that the original pollinators of these plants (and other genera such as &quot;Isoplexis&quot; and &quot;Canarina&quot;) were sunbirds which had become extinct on the Canary Islands, explaining why they are rare and considered endangered species (Vogel 1954; Vogel et al. 1984; Valido et al. 2004). However more recent work has shown that these plants are adequately pollinated by non-specialist flower visiting birds, particularly the Canary Islands chiffchaff (&quot;Phylloscopus canariensis&quot;), and in fact show some specific adaptations to infrequent pollination by these birds, such as extended flower lifespans.

However, the cultivated population studied by Ollerton et al. (2008) set no fruit, despite the plants receiving large amounts of pollen on their stigmas. This may be because the population was a single, self incompatible clonal genotype; whether this is true of all plants in cultivation is unknown, but may have important implications for the conservation of this species if it is extinct in the wild.

==Cultivation==
&quot;Lotus berthelotii&quot; is cultivated as an ornamental plant with its needle-like silvery foliage and red flowers for: traditional gardens, container (pots), and drought tolerant water conserving gardens. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit. A golden orange flowering cultivar is also grown. As it is intolerant of freezing temperatures, in cold temperate climates it requires the protection of glass in the winter months. It needs a sheltered spot in full sun.

<text>The Dornoch Firth (, ) is a firth on the east coast of Highland, in northern Scotland. It forms part of the boundary between Ross and Cromarty, to the south, and Sutherland, to the north. The firth is designated as a national scenic area, one of 40 such areas in Scotland. The national scenic area covers 15,782 ha in total, of which 4,240 ha is the marine area of the firth below low tide. A review of the national scenic areas by Scottish Natural Heritage in 2010 commented:
Together with Loch Fleet it is a designated as a Special Protection Area (SPA) for wildlife conservation purposes. Additionally, together with Morrich More, it has the designation of Special Area of Conservation (SAC).

The total SPA hosts significant populations of the following birds:

*Breeding season: osprey (&quot;Pandion haliaetus&quot;)
*Overwintering: bar-tailed godwit (&quot;Limosa lapponica&quot;), greylag goose (&quot;Anser anser&quot;), wigeon (&quot;Anas penelope&quot;), curlew (&quot;Numenius arquata&quot;), dunlin (&quot;Calidris alpina alpina&quot;), oystercatcher (&quot;Haematopus ostralegus&quot;), and teal (&quot;Anas crecca&quot;).

The SAC protects a variety of habitats, including salt meadows and coastal dune heathland and grassland. The site is of importance for otters (&quot;Lutra lutra&quot;) and harbour seals (&quot;Phoca vitulina&quot;) 

==Crossing the firth==

In 1991, the firth was bridged, the new Dornoch Firth Bridge providing a shorter route on the A9 road between Inverness and Thurso; until then traffic had to go by way of Bonar Bridge at the head of the inlet. There were proposals that the bridge should be constructed so as to allow the Far North railway line to also benefit from the shorter route, with the potential for up to 45 minutes to be saved on the journey between Inverness and Thurso/Wick. However this part of the scheme failed to secure government funding, and so only a road bridge was built.

On 16 August 1809 the firth was the scene of the Meikle Ferry disaster when an over-laden ferryboat sank with the loss of 99 lives.

<text>Siemowit IV (Ziemowit IV), also known as Siemowit IV the Younger (pl: &quot;Siemowit IV Młodszy&quot;; ca. 1353/1356 – 21 January 1426), was a Polish prince, member of the Masovian branch of the House of Piast and from 1373 or 1374 Duke of Rawa, and after the division of the paternal inheritance between him and his brother in 1381, ruler over Rawa, Płock, Sochaczew, Gostynin, Płońsk and Wizna, after 1386 hereditary Polish vassal, after 1388 ruler over Belz. During 1382–1401 he lost Wizna and during 1384–1399 and 1407–1411 he lost Zawkrze, during 1384–1399 he lost Płońsk, which was taken by the Teutonic Order.

He was the second son of Siemowit III, Duke of Masovia and his first wife Euphemia, daughter of Nicholas II of Opava.

Already during his father&#x27;s lifetime, Siemowit IV received his own district, Rawa Mazowiecka (ca. 1373/74), and as a result of the partition of Masovia between him and his older brother Janusz I after the death of their father on 16 June 1381, Siemowit IV finally obtain the totality of his domains: Rawa, Płock, Sochaczew, Gostynin, Płońsk and Wizna.

== Role in the Greater Polish Civil War ==
Siemowit IV was opposed to his older brother Janusz I&#x27;s attempts to obtain the Polish crown. One year after the acquisition of his own domains, King Louis of Poland and Hungary died (10 September 1382), and with this emerged the opportunity to enact his claim to the crown, supported by the Greater Poland and Kujawy nobility (centered around the powerful Bartosz Wezenborg). However, the late King had made arrangements among the Lesser Poland nobility who guaranteed their support to his eldest daughter and heiress Mary and her husband Sigismund of Luxembourg. Without waiting for a favorable settlement, in January 1383, Siemowit IV marched to Greater Poland at the head of his troops, marked the beginning of the Greater Poland Civil War.

Unexpectedly, in Buda the Dowager Queen Elizabeth of Bosnia decided to change the decision of her husband and accepted the reign of her youngest daughter Jadwiga over Poland instead of Mary and Sigismund, who remained rulers of Hungary. This decision caused that several supporters of Siemowit IV to hope that he could marry the young Queen (despite the fact that she was already betrothed to William of Habsburg) and in this way, both factions could reconcile and in addition this union with the old Piast dynasty could further legitimize the Angevin rule.

The first step to implement this plan was the formal candidacy of Siemowit IV to the royal crown. To this end, in a meeting of nobles and gentry at Sieradz the Archbishop Bodzanta of Gniezno, one of his leading supporters, proposed Siemowit IV&#x27;s candidacy to the throne. This proposal quickly gained widespread acceptance, and only thanks to the courageous intervention of the voivode of Kraków John of Tęczyn, who advised them to abstain from any decision until the arrival of Jadwiga, the idea was abandoned. The opposition of Lesser Poland to the candidacy of Siemowit IV was probably associated with the fear of the growing role of Greater Poland under an eventual rule of the Masovian Duke. Another argument against this was the emerging idea of the union with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

These events did not discourage Siemowit IV, who was determined to obtain the crown, even by force. Probably with the knowledge and consent of Archbishop Bodzanta, he attempted to abduct Jadwiga and marry her, in a desperate act to win the crown. When the Lesser Poland nobility knew of his intentions, they close the gates of Wawel to Bodzanta&#x27;s men, among them was hidden Siemowit IV. They also warned Jadwiga, who remained at the court of her mother until was secured to travel.

Despite the defeat of his ambitious plans, Siemowit IV continued his efforts to obtain the Polish throne. For this purpose, after burning the property of his political opponents in Książ, he went back to Sieradz, where a part of the local nobility proclaimed him King of Poland. This time, however, the congress lacked of real authority, and for this reason, he delayed his expected coronation, trying to conquer the country by force. After a disastrous campaign and a failed siege to Kalisz (Siemowit IV was able to obtain only Kujawy), some of his supporters decided to sign an armistice on 29 September 1383.

The ceasefire enabled the Polish to add Hungarian troops to the country&#x27;s forces under the personal command of Sigismund of Luxembourg. The combined attack of Hungarian-Polish forces caused that Siemowit IV avoided further fighting, especially after his brother Janusz opted for the recognition of Jadwiga as Queen.

The defeat of Siemowit IV reduced considerably the number of his supporters. Consequently, and after a final rejection in October 1384 from the powerful Lesser Poland nobility to a marriage with Jadwiga, the Masovian Duke adopted a different tactic: if it was impossible for him obtain the crown, he decided to win all the territory possible.

==Reconciliation with opponents==
Siewomit, after adding Łęczyca to his territory, decided to undertake peace negotiations with Jadwiga, which ended successfully on 12 December 1385 with the signing of a treaty, under which Siemowit IV returned all the lands taken by him in exchange for the sum of 10,000 silver marks, and most important, he relinquished all his claims to the Polish crown and paid homage to the Queen Jadwiga and her new husband and King, Jogaila, from which he received the Duchy of Belz as dowry of Princess Alexandra of Lithuania, Jogaila&#x27;s sister, who married Siemowit IV as a gesture of reconciliation between both parties.
Siemowit IV&#x27;s complete resignation of his claim to the Polish crown was his attendance to the ceremonies of baptism, marriage and coronation of Jadwiga and Jogaila in Kraków. After these ceremonies, he renewed his homage to the royal couple. He joined the royal entourage to Vilnius, where he participated in the process of Christianization of Lithuania.

==Post civil war activity==
Before the war, as an independent ruler he could effectively maneuver between the Polish, Lithuanians and the Teutonic Order; now, as a vassal was clearly seen as a representative of the Polish Kingdom. In addition, in order to finance his policies he needed money and several times he mortgaged some of his domains to the Teutonic Order, including Wizna (during 1382-1401), Płońsk (during 1384-1399) and Zawkrze (during 1384-1399 and 1407-1411).
In view of the growing friction between the Polish and Teutonic Order, Siemowit IV tried to obtain the greatest benefit for him and intervened as a mediator. Also, after the outbreak of the war of 1409–1410 between Poland, Lithuania and the Teutonic Order, the attitude of the Masovian Duke wasn&#x27;t clear: in one side, he tried to contact King Sigismund of Hungary and by other side, he pressured his warring neighbors to maintain the peace. In view of the failure of his attempts to make a compromise, Siemowit IV finally sent his troops at the Battle of Grunwald, but his participation was only symbolic; in fact, was his son Siemovit V who fielded two banners of his own troops and fought alongside the &#x27;Royal&#x27; Poles and Lithuanian troops. In order to maintain his friendly relations with the Teutonic Order, he provides them with refunds even during the campaign; in exchange, the Order returned Zawkrze to Siemowit IV, despite the fact that under the Peace of Thorn (1411) they aren&#x27;t obliged to do it.

Despite his official subordination to Poland, Siemowit IV tried to pursue an independent foreign policy. This was expressed in his frequent contacts with the Hungarian King Sigismund, who, wishing to drag a Polish vassal to his side gave the Masovian Duke the rich prebends from the Bishopric of Veszprém and other possessions across Hungary.

Siemowit IV&#x27;s relations with Poland, although some temporary frictions caused by his too independent policy (he even minted his own coins) remained friendly, despite the fact that he didn&#x27;t fulfill his duties as a vassal, and only sent troops to Poland occasionally when he was required to do. Another gesture of friendship with King Władysław II was noted when he used Siemowit IV&#x27;s daughters into political marriages and the support given to his son Alexander in his Church career.
In domestic politics, Siemowit IV continued the economic restructuring which begun under the rule of his father. For this purpose, in addition to the existing statutes he implemented the Kulm law in several of his cities and promoted the colonization of the Masovian nobility to Belz.

==Ill health and death==
After 1420 Siemowit IV, due to his progressive blindness, gradually gave participation in the government to his adult sons. In 1425, the dispute about the election of his Chancellor Stanisław z Pawłowic as Bishop of Płock forced his sons Siemowit V and Casimir II into a humiliating surrender.
Siemowit IV died on 21 January 1426 at Gostynin and was buried in the Ducal crypt at Płock Cathedral.

==Marriage and issue==
In 1387, Siemowit IV married Alexandra (died 20 April 1434), a Lithuanian princess, daughter of Algirdas, Grand Duke of Lithuania, and his second wife, Uliana of Tver. They had thirteen children:

<doc id="1266123" wikidata="Q1474378" url="?curid=1266123" title="Spark testing">
<text>Spark testing is a method of determining the general classification of ferrous materials. It normally entails taking a piece of metal, usually scrap, and applying it to a grinding wheel in order to observe the sparks emitted. These sparks can be compared to a chart or to sparks from a known test sample to determine the classification. Spark testing also can be used to sort ferrous materials, establishing the difference from one another by noting whether the spark is the same or different.

Spark testing is used because it is quick, easy, and inexpensive. Moreover, test samples do not have to be prepared in any way, so, often, a piece of scrap is used. The main disadvantage to spark testing is its inability to identify a material positively; if positive identification is required, chemical analysis must be used. The spark comparison method also damages the material being tested, at least slightly.

Spark testing most often is used in tool rooms, machine shops, heat treating shops, and foundries.

==Process==
A bench grinder is usually used to create the sparks, but sometimes this is not convenient, so a portable grinder is used. In either case, the grinding wheel must have adequate surface velocity, at least 23 m/s (4500 surface feet per minute (sfpm)), but should be between 38 and 58 m/s (7500–11,500 sfpm). The wheel should be coarse and hard, therefore aluminium oxide or carborundum often are employed. The test area should be in an area where there is no bright light shining directly into the observer&#x27;s eyes. Moreover, the grinding wheel and surrounding area should be dark so that the sparks can be observed clearly. The test sample is then touched lightly to the grinding wheel to produce the sparks.

The important spark characteristics are color, volume, nature of the spark, and length. Note that the length is dependent on the amount of pressure applied to the grinding wheel, so this can be a poor comparison tool if the pressure is not exactly the same for the samples. Also, the grinding wheel must be dressed frequently to remove metallic build-up.

===Compressed air method===
Another less common method for creating sparks is heating up the sample to red heat and then applying compressed air to the sample. The compressed air supplies enough oxygen to ignite the sample and give off sparks. This method is more accurate than using a grinder because it will always give off sparks of the same length for the same sample. The compressed air applies in essence the same &quot;pressure&quot; each time. This makes observations of the spark length a much more reliable characteristic for comparison.

===Automated spark testing===
Automated spark testing has been developed to remove the reliance upon operator skill and experience, thereby increasing reliability. The system relies upon spectroscopy, spectrometry, and other methods to &quot;observe&quot; the spark pattern. It has been found that this system can determine the difference between two materials that give off sparks that are indistinguishable to the human eye.

==Spark characteristics==

;Wrought iron: Wrought iron sparks flow out in straight lines. The tails of the sparks widen out near the end, similar to a leaf.
;Mild steel: Mild steel sparks are similar to wrought iron&#x27;s, except they will have tiny forks and their lengths will vary more. The sparks will be white in color.
;Medium-carbon steel: This steel has more forking than mild steel and a wide variety of spark lengths, with more near the grinding wheel.
;High-carbon steel: High-carbon steel has a bushy spark pattern (much forking) that starts at the grinding wheel. The sparks are not as bright as the medium-carbon steel ones.
;Manganese steel: Manganese steel has medium length sparks that fork twice before ending.
;High-speed steel: High-speed steel has a faint red spark that sparks at the tip.
;300-series stainless steel: These sparks are not so dense as the carbon steel sparks, do not fork, and are orange to straw in color.
;310-series stainless steel: These sparks are much shorter and thinner than the 300-series sparks. They are red to orange in color and do not fork.
;400-series stainless steel: 400-series sparks are similar to 300-series sparks, but are slightly longer and have forks at the ends of the sparks.
;Cast iron: Cast iron has very short sparks that begin at the grinding wheel.
;Nickel and cobalt high-temperature alloys: These sparks are thin and very short, they are dark-red in color, and do not fork.
;Cemented carbide: Cemented carbide has sparks under 3 inches, which are dark-red in color and do not fork. 
;Titanium: Although titanium is a non-ferrous metal, it gives off a great deal of sparks. These sparks are easily distinguishable from ferrous metals, as they are a very brilliant, blinding, white color.

==History==
In 1909, Max Bermann, an engineer in Budapest, was the first to discover that spark testing can be used reliably to classify ferrous material. He originally claimed to be able to distinguish different types of ferrous materials based on percent carbon and principal alloying elements. Moreover, he claimed to achieve an accuracy of 0.01% carbon content.

Tschorn produced an exhaustive treatment of spark testing. His book, Spark Atlas of Steels, along with Spark Testing by Gladwin represent the two most comprehensive texts on the subject 

As of the late 1980s, the industrial use of spark testing is not as common as it used to be. In the early 21st century the availability of portable X-ray fluorescence equipment largely superseded it in laboratory practice.

<text>Robert Berkeley Davis (born 1 October 1947) is an English guitarist and songwriter who achieved early fame as a founding member of glam rock band Mud in the 1970s. He had songwriting success in the 1990s and 2000s, penning vocal arrangements for dance hits including &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot; for Kylie Minogue, Fragma&#x27;s &quot;Toca&#x27;s Miracle&quot; and Spiller&#x27;s &quot;Groovejet (If This Ain&#x27;t Love)&quot;.

==Early career==
Davis received his first guitar aged 11, and music became a central part of his life. In 1962, at 15, he and Dave Mount formed a band called The Apaches, with a Shadows sound. He and Mount continued to work together in several bands, including the Barracudas, and in 1964 formed the Remainder. He joined the Mourners, who were looking for a lead guitarist and in February 1966 changed their name to Mud.

==Mud==
 Davis was a founding member of the successful late 1960s and 1970s glam rock band Mud. In addition to playing lead guitar, he wrote a number of the band’s songs. He wrote the band’s first single, “Flower Power” which was released in the October 1967 but did not garner much success. While he did not compose any of the songs on the band’s first two full albums, he wrote or co-wrote over 45 songs for the band and their subsequent albums. His first and biggest songwriting hit with Mud was &quot;L&#x27;L&#x27;Lucy&quot; which reached number 10 on the UK Singles Chart in September 1975. It became a bigger hit in both Belgium and the Netherlands, where it reached No. 1 for twelve and nine weeks, respectively. Davis wrote the B-sides on two of Mud&#x27;s biggest hits, &quot;Tiger Feet&quot; and &quot;Dyna-Mite&quot;. The band broke up in 1980.

==Other groups==
Davis worked with several other groups, including the Tremeloes and Darts, but his efforts met with little commercial success.

==Songwriting==
Although Davis wrote many of Mud&#x27;s later songs, he achieved songwriting success commercially after the band disbanded starting with a writing and producing partnership with George Stanley Alexander that saw some hits with disco group Liquid Gold. Following a chance meeting with Paul Oakenfold in the late 1980s, he continued to move genres from rock and disco to writing club and dance songs. He would receive instrumental tracks from producers and incorporate lyrics. The first hit with Oakenfold came with &quot;Not Over Yet&quot; by Grace in 1993 reaching No. 3 on the UK charts. He later worked with Coco Star, writing &quot;I Need a Miracle&quot; which was released in 1996 and the re-recorded version released in 1997 peaked at No. 39 in the UK.

In 2000, he achieved his biggest commercial songwriting successes. Fragma&#x27;s &quot;Toca&#x27;s Miracle&quot; became Davis&#x27; first No. 1 hit and was a mashup of Davis-written &quot;I Need a Miracle&quot; by Coco and Fragma&#x27;s instrumental &quot;Toca Me&quot;. The song was released on 10 April and won critical acclaim, peaking at No. 1 in both the UK and Scotland. There have been multiple re-releases that have achieved chart success. On 14 August 2000, Spiller released &quot;Groovejet (If This Ain&#x27;t Love)&quot;, on which he provided important lyrical support. The song reached No. 1 in five countries including the UK, Australia and New Zealand. It finished No. 8 on the UK 2000 year-end charts. In 2001, Davis scored a UK top 10 hit as one third of the group Stuntmasterz, with the mashup &quot;The Ladyboy Is Mine&quot;.

In their first songwriting session together, Davis and Cathy Dennis wrote &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot; for Kylie Minogue. Released in 2001, it was the first song to have 3,000 radio plays in a single week in the UK, reached No. 1 in all but one European country and sold over four million copies. Davis and Dennis received an Ivor Novello Award for composing the most performed song of the year. The song was originally intended for Sophie Ellis-Bextor, but she turned it down according to Davis, although Sophie later claimed that the proposal never got to her in the first place. Davis soon met Minogue&#x27;s A&amp;R manager Jamie Nelson who liked it and wanted her to record it. While Minogue was not the original artist selected, Dennis believed Minogue was the best artist for the song. The two writers also teamed up to write Brooke Hogan&#x27;s single, &quot;Everything to Me&quot;, in 2004. The song reached #1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Singles Sales chart.

At the Grammy Awards of 2004, Davis shared a Grammy with co-producer Philip Larsen (Manhattan Clique) and performer Minogue, for another Minogue single &quot;Come into My World&quot;, in the category of Best Dance Recording. The song reached No. 4 in Australia while peaking at No. 8 in the UK.

Davis also worked with Jan Johnston and together they wrote six songs including &quot;Am I on Pause?&quot;. His latest commercial works include co-writing for the song &quot;One Foot Boy&quot; from Mika&#x27;s album, &quot;The Boy Who Knew Too Much&quot; (2009).

==Television appearances==
In December 2005, Davis appeared in the Channel 4 programme, &quot;Bring Back...The Christmas Number One&quot;. In January 2008, Davis appeared in the BBC Four television documentary, &quot;Pop, What Is It Good For?&quot; In December 2009, he appeared in the Channel 4 programme &quot;The Greatest Songs of the Noughties&quot;, which featured &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot;, ranked at No. 9 (in a Top 20). In December 2018, Davis appeared on BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Pointless Celebrities&quot; Christmas Special. In October 2021, he contributed to the Channel 5 series &quot;Britain&#x27;s Biggest 70s Hits&quot; appearing on the 1970 episode alongside Ray Dorset and David Hamilton.

<text>Paul Bacon (1 November 1907 – 6 December 1999) was a French politician.

== Biography ==
Bacon was born in Paris. During World War II, he was active in the French Resistance, specifically with the MLN. He was a member of Georges Bidault&#x27;s National Liberation Movement, and distributed a manifesto about trade unionism in December 1940. Bacon was arrested by the Gestapo in 1943.

After the war, Bacon continued his political career. A member of the Christian Democratic Popular Republican Movement (MRP), he was Member of the two National Constituent Assemblies (1945–46) and then of the National Assembly from 1946 to 1958 representing the Seine Department. He was Secretary of state in the prime minister&#x27;s office in 1959-1960, Minister of Labour and Social security (with some interruptions during the cabinets of Pinay and of Mendès France) from 1950 to 1956 and again in 1957-1959.

<doc id="1266131" wikidata="Q1857589" url="?curid=1266131" title="Burslem">
<text>Burslem ( ) is one of the six towns that along with Hanley, Tunstall, Fenton, Longton and Stoke-upon-Trent form part of the city of Stoke-on-Trent in Staffordshire, England. It is often referred to as the &quot;mother town&quot; of Stoke on Trent. The population of the town was included under the Burslem Central ward and had a population of 6,490 in the 2021 Census.

==Topography==
Burslem is on the eastern ridge of the Fowlea Valley, the Fowlea being one of the main early tributaries of the River Trent. Burslem embraces the areas of Middleport, Dalehall, Longport, Westport, Trubshaw Cross, and Brownhills. The Trent &amp; Mersey Canal cuts through, to the west and south of the town centre. A little further west, the West Coast Main Line railway and the A500 road run in parallel, forming a distinct boundary between Burslem and the abutting town of Newcastle-under-Lyme. To the south is Grange Park and Festival Park, reclaimed by the Stoke-on-Trent Garden Festival.

==History==

The Domesday Book shows Burslem (listed as &quot;Bacardeslim&quot;) as a small farming hamlet, strategically sited above a ford at Longport, part of the major pack horse track out of the Peak District and Staffordshire Moorlands to the Liverpool/London road. The name refers to the Old English personal name &quot;Burgweard&quot; and the former Forest of Lyme (reflected in the nearby town of Newcastle-under-Lyme). As far back as the late 12th century, a thriving pottery industry existed, based on the fine and abundant local clays. After the Black Death, Burslem emerges in the records as a medieval town – St John the Baptist&#x27;s Church on Cross Hill, with a stone tower dating from 1536, was extended in the 18th century, and is still standing and in use. Until the mid-1760s Burslem was relatively cut off from the rest of England: it had no navigable river nearby, and there were no good and reliable roads. 

By 1777 the Trent and Mersey Canal was nearing completion, and the roads had markedly improved. The town boomed on the back of fine pottery production and canals, and became known as The Mother Town of the six towns that make up the city. Hill Top Methodist Church and Sunday School opened on Westport Road in 1836. The railway station opened in 1848. The Burslem School of Art was founded in 1853. A new town hall was built in the market place in 1854, designed by G. T. Robinson of Leamington in elaborate baroque style. In 1906, the United Reformed Church was opened on Moorland Road, initially named the Woodall Memorial Congregational Church, in memory of William Woodall MP. 

In 1910, the town was federated into the county borough of Stoke-on-Trent, and the borough was granted city status in 1925. The new town hall was built in 1911 on Wedgwood Place, in neo-classical style, designed by Russell and Cooper. 

Many of the novels of Arnold Bennett evoke Victorian Burslem, with its many potteries, mines, and working canal barges. The Burslem of the 1930s to the 1980s is evoked by the paintings and plays of Arthur Berry.

Burslem contains Britain&#x27;s last real working industrial district (i.e. where people live within walking distance of the factories of a single heavy industry, in this case, the potteries) and thus much of the nineteenth-century industrial heritage, buildings and character have survived intact.

===Trade journals===


==Population and housing==
At the 1991 census count, the population of Burslem was 21,400. A study by consultants Atkins, working from the United Kingdom Census 2001 data, showed that the Burslem population is steady and has not declined despite a manufacturing decline during the 1980s and &#x27;90s.

Traditional Victorian architecture and Edwardian period terraced houses dominate the town. New housing developments are underway on the Sadlers Factory site and around Woodbank Street.

Heavy industrial employment (mines, steel and pots) has left a legacy of ill-health among many older people, but there is the Haywood Hospital (High Lane, Burslem) and the new £300-million University Hospital of North Staffordshire is just three miles away by road.

There were two electoral wards covering Burslem at the 2011 census, Burslem Central and Burslem Park.

At the 2011 census the ethnic demographics of the Burslem Central ward were:

At the 2011 census the ethnic demographics of the Burslem Park ward were:

==Economy==
Industrial scale pottery production has drastically declined since the 1970s; but specialist makers (Steelite) and smaller producers of high-value ceramics (Burleigh, Wade, Moorcroft) are thriving. Burslem is emerging as a centre for small, freelance creative businesses working in sectors such as fine art, animation and crafts as well as pottery.

The number of shops in the town centre have markedly declined, hit by the impact of nearby out-of-town retail parks that offer free parking. However, the evening economy is still active with a wide range of bars and restaurants mainly serving English and Indian food.

The Market Hall, a Grade II listed building dating from 1879, lying between the market place and Queen Street, was in use until 2003, closing after its condition was judged unsafe.

At Spring 2002 unemployment was 4.1% or 1,526 people in the Stoke-on-Trent North constituency; almost the same rate as the West Midlands as a whole. In Burslem at 2001 unemployment was 3.2% and declining.

In 2005, the building of business park units in the town. Further business parks are planned for 2006/7 just to the north in Chatterley Valley, and the south in Etruria Valley.

In 2019 it was reported that the town&#x27;s last bank had closed, leaving the town without any free to use cash machines, making it the first large town in the UK without one.

===Media===
Local television services is provided by &quot;BBC Midlands Today&quot; and &quot;ITV News Central&quot;.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Stoke, Hits Radio Staffordshire &amp; Cheshire, Greatest Hits Radio Staffordshire &amp; Cheshire, 6 Towns Radio and HitMix Radio, a community based radio station. 

In 2007 a social enterprise newspaper, &quot;Local Edition&quot;, become one of the first newspapers to cover the area regularly. The newspaper covered Burslem, as well as surrounding areas including Tunstall, Middleport and Cobridge, giving a voice to the people in the community. The newspaper ceased publication in 2008 and its archive is online.

===Leopard Inn===

The Leopard public house, also known as the Leopard Inn, dates to the late 18th century. The building was refronted about 1830 and expanded in the 1870s with the addition of more than 50 bedrooms in the rear. In 1765 it was the location of the first meeting between Josiah Wedgwood, Thomas Bentley, Erasmus Darwin and James Brindley to discuss the building of what became the Trent and Mersey Canal; as The Tiger, it appears in several of Arnold Bennett&#x27;s &quot;Five Towns&quot; novels. It was a coaching inn and after the rear extension, a major commercial hotel, but reduced demand for rooms led to the extension being closed off in 1956. The rediscovery of this section of the building in 2007 led to tales of hauntings and ghost tours.

Bass Breweries bought The Leopard in 1965 and renovated the restaurant, which they named the Arnold Bennett Suite. The building was Grade II listed on 18 April 1972. In the 21st century it became a live music venue and was extensively renovated, but it did not reopen after the COVID lockdown. In January 2021 it was sold to a development company who proposed redeveloping the rear into luxury apartments while retaining the pub; in February 2021 Stoke-on-Trent City Council declared it an Asset of Community Value. The following January, an illegal cannabis grow was discovered inside the vacant building, and it was then badly damaged in a suspected arson fire. The city council announced the formation of a Heritage Congress to protect historic properties in Stoke-on-Trent. In June 2024, the owners submitted a proposal to convert the building to a shop and 17 one-bedroom assisted living flats.

==Tourism==
Around 5 million tourists visit Stoke-on-Trent each year, supporting around 4,400 direct jobs. Stoke shows its popularity through the number of repeat visits; around 80 per cent of visitors have previously been here. Burslem has a variety of strong tourist attractions; Burleigh, Moorcroft, Festival Park, its many pubs, and the Trent &amp; Mersey Canal. The Old Town Hall is one of the largest buildings in Burslem.

It also has the legacy of novelist Arnold Bennett, who refers to the town and many of its streets with thinly disguised names: e.g. Burslem/&quot;Bursley&quot;, Swan (Square and Pub)/&quot;Duck&quot;. It is the setting for one of his most famous works, the Clayhanger trilogy. Burslem&#x27;s centre benefits from having an almost-intact medieval street-plan and countless fine old buildings, and a townscape which almost-totally escaped re-development during the 1960s and 1970s.

After being under-used for years, the Burslem School of Art has been refurbished at a cost of £2.1m and offers several large free art galleries. The free Public Library is currently based in the School of Art, after the Venetian Gothic Wedgwood Institute closed for safety reasons early in 2009. Ceramica was a new award-winning ceramics family attraction, based in the imposing old Town Hall and funded by Millennium Lottery money but due to the loss of council funding has been closed. The Queen&#x27;s Theatre has regular concerts and an annual pantomime.

There is a traditional Friday street market, and street carnivals in May and December.

==Sports==
The major football club Port Vale is based in Burslem at Vale Park. The team currently plays in League Two, England&#x27;s fourth division.

Near to the town is Burslem Golf Club, a 9-hole course which once had singer Robbie Williams as a Junior Captain. It was opened on 28 September 1907 by vaudeville entertainer and golfer Sir Harry Lauder. On 29 September 2007 his great-nephew Gregory Lauder-Frost as guest-of-honour rededicated it for another century in a formal ceremony.

Professional darts player Phil Taylor is from Burslem.

==Education==
Burslem is the site of one of the two campuses of Stoke-on-Trent College; the College states that it is the largest Further Education college in Stoke and North Staffordshire. The campus specialises in media-production and drama. Stoke Studio College, a studio school for 13- to 19-year-olds opened at the college campus in September 2013.

Within a six-mile radius from Burslem there are three universities; Staffordshire at Shelton, Keele University, and Manchester Metropolitan&#x27;s large Art &amp; Design campus at Alsager.

==The environment==
The town is elevated and is not prone to flooding.

===Parks===
====Burslem Park====
The town&#x27;s municipal park, designed by the landscape architect Thomas Hayton Mawson, was opened in 1894. It is protected by a Grade II* designation on the Register of Parks and Gardens. It was laid out on derelict land next to the Potteries Loop Line. Mawson also used reclaimed land as the site of Hanley Park, which he designed around the same time. Both parks include water features. 

====Other parks====
There are also later examples of reclaimed green space near Burslem, such as the Westport Lake, a 1970s project, and the legacy of the 1986 National Garden Festival, which imaginatively reclaimed part of the site of the Shelton Bar steelworks.

The Peak District National Park begins just ten miles north-east of Burslem.

===Burslem cemetery===
The cemetery, to the east of Sneyd Hill Park, was laid out in 1879 as a combined burial ground and recreational park. It covers 11.4 acres, and comprised walks, rides, lodges and a chapel, situated at the centre. The chapel was demolished by the council in 2008 on the basis of lack of use and the costs of maintenance and repair. The ashes of the novelist Arnold Bennett were interred in his family tomb in the cemetery, following his death in 1931.

==Transport==
The nearby A500 gives access to the M6 motorway. Longport railway station offers direct connections south into Stoke, east to Derby and Nottingham, and north to Crewe and Manchester. The town is straddled by two major off-road cycle paths, part of the National Cycle Network.

The Trent and Mersey canal is said to see over 10,000 narrowboats a year using it. The former Burslem Canal was constructed in 1805 and remained open until 1961 when it was breached. The Burslem Canal was a branch of the Trent and Mersey Canal running from the junction near to Newport Lane (opposite the old steel works) through to the Furlong Lane area of Middleport.

The nearest international airports are Manchester and Birmingham; each is about 60 minutes away by train.

Burslem railway station which was opened by the North Staffordshire Railway opened on 1 November 1873 on the Potteries Loop Line. It closed in the 1960s and the site and trackbed are now a greenway.

==Notable people==
Burslem&#x27;s most famous sons include the potter Josiah Wedgwood, the watercolour painter James Holland (1800–1870), Ian &quot;Lemmy&quot; Kilmister, the founder, bassist and lead singer of Motörhead, and Robbie Williams, who was a major shareholder in Port Vale and whose family are still resident in the area. Darts legend and 16-time world champion Phil Taylor was born, raised and also worked in the town.

In the 17th century, Molly Leigh was resident of the town, she was accused of being a witch before her death in 1748. Painter James Astbury Hammersley also came from Burslem.

William Frederick Horry owned the George Hotel in the 1860s before murdering his wife Jane at his father&#x27;s house in Boston, Lincolnshire. Despite pleas for clemency he was hanged at Lincoln Castle on 1 April 1872 and his body interred with other executed felons in the interior of the Castle&#x27;s Lucy Tower, where it can still be seen.

William Clowes, one of the founders of Primitive Methodism, was born in Burslem as was John Bennett the potter. Sarah Benett (1850–1924), the Suffragette, member of the WSPU and social reformer lived in Burslem from 1894.

William Boulton&#x27;s Providence Works and Foundry was based in Burslem, which designed and made the machinery that revolutionised the pottery industry in the second half of the 19th century.

==In popular culture==
George Formby&#x27;s first sound film, &quot;Boots! Boots!&quot;, got its world premiere in Burslem in 1934.

The 1952 film adaptation of Arnold Bennett&#x27;s &quot;The Card&quot; was partly filmed on location in the town.

Robbie Williams included the song &quot;Burslem Normals&quot;&#x27; on his album &quot;Rudebox&quot;, released in 2006. A short film, &quot;Goodbye to the Normals&quot; was also made.

A song &quot;Waterloo Road&quot; performed by Jason Crest was written (by Mike Deighan and Mike Wilsh) about the Waterloo Road in Burslem. The song became very popular and even reached no. 1 in France when the French singer Joe Dassin covered it under the title &quot;Les Champs Élysées&quot;.

The guitarist Slash, lead guitarist of Guns N&#x27; Roses, was also an inhabitant of Stoke-on-Trent in his early years.

<text>Loch Fleet () is a sea loch on the east coast of Scotland, located between Golspie and Dornoch. It forms the estuary of the River Fleet, a small spate river that rises in the hills east of Lairg. The loch was designated a National Nature Reserve (NNR) in 1998, and is managed by a partnership between NatureScot, the Scottish Wildlife Trust (SWT) and Sutherland Estates. The NNR extends to 1058 hectares, including the Loch Fleet tidal basin, sand dunes, shingle ridges and the adjacent pine woods, including Balbair Wood and Ferry Wood. The tidal basin of the loch covers over 630 ha, and forms the largest habitat on the NNR.

==Geography and geology==
Loch Fleet is a shallow, bar-built estuary with extensive sand-flats and mud-flats backed by saltmarsh and sand dunes. The loch connects to the Dornoch Firth via a narrow channel between Coul Links and Ferry Links.

Beneath the sand dunes lies a bedrock of old Red Sandstone, overlain by shingle ridges, which extend from the western NNR boundary to the current coastline and north from Littleferry to Golspie. At the end of the last ice age Loch Fleet became a was a wide-open bay with a tidal delta reaching inland as far as Rogart. The current gradually dragged shingle across the entrance of the bay, producing a tidal basin linked to the sea by a narrow tidal channel.

==Flora and fauna==
The mudflats are an important habitat for many bird species, and over 100 species have been recorded at the reserve, with the highest numbers seen during the spring and autumn migrations. Species that spend the winter at the loch include bar-tailed godwit, greylag goose, wigeon, curlew, dunlin, and teal. Approximately 2% of the entire UK population of greylag geese use the wider Dornoch Firth and Loch Fleet SPA, with Loch Fleet being particularly important during the autumn: as winter progresses many of the geese move on to the Dornoch Firth. The geese spend summers further north, with some heading for Iceland and some remaining within Scotland at sites in Caithness and Sutherland.

Breeding birds at Loch Fleet include Arctic terns, common terns, oystercatchers, ringed plovers, wheatears, European stonechats, cuckoos, meadow pipits and skylarks, these species tending to favour the links habitat. The pinewoods hold species including crossbills, siskin, common redstart, treecreeper, great spotted woodpecker, buzzard and sparrowhawk. Loch Fleet is a good place to see osprey fishing, and in the early 1990s there were 10 breeding pairs on the wider SPA.

The most visible mammals at Loch Fleet are seals: common seals can be seen from the public road at Skelbo year round, and grey seals visit during the winter months. Otter and pipistrelle bats are also found here, along with other typical Scottish land mammals such as roe deer, fox, pine marten, and weasel. Red squirrels and Scottish wildcats have been recorded in the area, but have not been seen in recent years.

There are 265 species of vascular plants, over 110 species of lichen, and over 50 species of fungi have been recorded at the Loch Fleet NNR. The most noteworthy flora is that of the pinewood at Balblair Wood, where the nationally important species one-flowered wintergreen, twinflower and creeping lady&#x27;s-tresses can be found. Other species typically found in native pine forests but otherwise uncommon in Scotland such as common wintergreen and lesser twayblade are also found here. The alder woods around the mouth of the river at the Mound are also significant.

==History==
The ruins of Skelbo Castle are situated on the south side of the loch.

The Battle of Littleferry was fought a few days before the Battle of Culloden in 1746. The Sutherland militia came down from the hills above Golspie and fell upon around 500 men led by the Earl of Cromarty. Cromarty&#x27;s men were cornered in the Littleferry peninsula on the northeast side of the loch, and were either killed, captured, or drowned in the loch.

The building of the Mound causeway, designed by Thomas Telford and built between 1814 and 1818 to carry what is now the A9 road, reduced the size of the loch. The causeway, which is nearly 1 km long, acts as a tidal barrier, stopping the sea some 2.5 km short of the former tidal limit. Sluices in the causeway allow salmon and sea-trout to continue to migrate upstream to spawning areas, as well providing an outflow for the River Fleet.

==Conservation designations==
Loch Fleet became a nature reserve under the management of the Scottish Wildlife Trust in 1970 by agreement with the landowners, Sutherland and Cambusmore Estates. In 1975 it was declared a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI): the Loch Fleet SSSI is slightly larger than the NNR, at 1232 ha, and also covers Coul Links. On 24 March 1997, the Dornoch Firth and Loch Fleet Special Protection Area (SPA) was established for wildlife conservation. The SPA covers of Loch Fleet, the Dornoch Firth, Morrich More, the Mound Alderwoods and Tarbat Ness, and was also listed as a Ramsar site the same year. The Joint Nature Conservation Committee described it as &quot;one of the best examples in northwest Europe of a large complex estuary which has been relatively unaffected by industrial development&quot;.

Loch Fleet was made a national nature reserve (NNR) in 1998: the NNR is classified as a Category IV protected area by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

<text>Ad Infinitum were an English musical group which were part of the Factory Records label. They were formed by Lindsay Reade, who was married to label manager Tony Wilson at the time. The group was composed of members of A Certain Ratio, and New Order bassist Peter Hook.

In 1984, the group recorded its sole single, a cover of the Joe Meek song &quot;Telstar&quot;, with the B-side being &quot;Telstar in a Piano Bar&quot;. The song had original lyrics written by Reade in its first version, which were rejected by Meek&#x27;s publishers, and replaced by more abstract and unintelligible vocals. Lindsay Reade explained:

This single was one of the first records with a holographic cover.
