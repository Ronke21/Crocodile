<text>Wayne Chrebet (born August 14, 1973) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver for 11 seasons with the New York Jets of the National Football League (NFL) from 1995 to 2005. He played college football for the Hofstra Pride.

== High school and college career ==
Chrebet grew up in Garfield, New Jersey in heavily suburban Bergen County. He played high school football at Garfield High School.

After graduating from Garfield, Chrebet remained in the tri-state area, attending Hofstra University on Long Island. Chrebet enjoyed a very productive college football career. Playing from 1991 to 1994, he set several school records, which include the single-game receiving yards record (245), touchdowns in a game (five), season (16) and career (31). A four-year letter-winner, he twice led Hofstra in receiving yards, and during his 1994 Senior season he became the first player in school history to amass 1,000 receiving yards in a single season. He also etched his name in the NCAA Division I-AA record book by scoring five receiving touchdowns in a single game, tying a record held by NFL Hall of Famer Jerry Rice.

Hofstra has honored Chrebet for his outstanding college career. He was inducted into the Hofstra University Athletic Hall of Fame in 2006 as part of its inaugural class, and his jersey #3 was retired.

== NFL career ==
Despite his collegiate success, Chrebet was not regarded as an NFL prospect. At and , he was deemed too small for the NFL and went undrafted in the 1995 NFL draft.

Chrebet did get a tryout with the Baltimore Stallions of the Canadian Football League, but he was cut after one day.

Chrebet&#x27;s big break came when he was granted a walk-on opportunity with the NFL&#x27;s New York Jets, which at the time trained at Hofstra&#x27;s campus.

Chrebet entered training camp 11th of 11 on the Jets&#x27; wide receiver depth chart. Since NFL teams generally retained about five receivers on their regular season roster at the time, Chrebet was not expected to make the team.

While Chrebet was so small that a team security guard prevented him from entering the front gate on his first day of training camp, Chrebet did make the Jets’ final 53-man roster. In so doing, he became the first Hofstra alumnus to make an NFL team in three decades.

During his rookie season, on December 3, 1995, Chrebet pulled in 8 receptions in a game against the St. Louis Rams. During a scoring play, Chrebet broke several tackles as he scrambled toward the goal line.

The following season, on October 19, 1996, Chrebet hauled in 12 receptions for 162 yards against Jacksonville. Five of the receptions led to third-down conversions. Overall during his career, 379 of his 580 receptions led to successful third down conversions. This led to Chrebet&#x27;s primary nickname, &quot;Mr. Third Down.”

At one point, on September 24, 2000, after former Jets teammate Keyshawn Johnson claimed that comparing Chrebet to him was like &quot;comparing a flashlight to a star,&quot; Chrebet caught an 18-yard TD pass from Curtis Martin with 52 seconds left to give the Jets a 21–17 victory against Johnson&#x27;s team at the time (the Tampa Bay Buccaneers). After this, the New York media dubbed Chrebet &quot;The Green Lantern.&quot;

Some consider Chrebet&#x27;s best overall game as the October 10, 2004 contest with the Buffalo Bills in which he caught all 8 passes sent his way from quarterback Chad Pennington in a 16–14 victory.

In a November 6, 2005 game against the San Diego Chargers, Chrebet sustained a serious concussion on a clean play. Despite being knocked unconscious for several minutes, Chrebet still made a third-down catch for a first down, symbolic of the type of plays he made throughout his career. After the concussion, he was placed on injured reserve, ending his season. After being told that he risked brain damage if he suffered another concussion, Chrebet announced his retirement on June 2, 2006.

==Legacy==

At the time of his retirement, his 580 receptions were the second-most in franchise history, behind only wide receiver Don Maynard (NY Titans / NY Jets). His 7,365 yards from scrimmage were fifth in franchise history.

During his 11-year career with the Jets, he caught passes from 13 different quarterbacks, played for four different head coaches, and worked for two different owners.

Chrebet was formally honored by the New York Jets on &quot;Wayne Chrebet Day&quot; during halftime of the September 23, 2007 game against the Miami Dolphins.

Chrebet wore #80 for his entire 11-season career as a Jet. The Jets have not reissued the number since he retired, and it is generally understood that no Jet will wear that number again in the foreseeable future. He was formally inducted into the New York Jets Ring of Honor during halftime of the Monday December 1, 2014 game against the Miami Dolphins.

Chrebet&#x27;s career history was named one of the greatest rags-to-riches stories in the history of professional sports by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; later that year.

Because of his size and success, Chrebet became a popular sensation. While still playing, he was featured on cereal boxes,

In 2007, Chrebet stated that he still feels post-concussion symptoms as a result of the multiple concussions he suffered while playing in the NFL, including headaches, lethargy, and sensitivity to light and noise. Nonetheless, he stated in 2014 that he has no regrets about playing football, saying: &quot;When you sign up, you expose yourself to these things. I knew the risks. I loved the contact. I miss that. But I had some high I got over getting a big hit or making a hit if I got somebody or they got me more. Would I play any other way than what I&#x27;m saying? No.&quot; Chrebet added that the NFL&#x27;s newer concussion rules are &quot;good for the game, but I couldn&#x27;t play that way,&quot; and that despite the lasting effects of his playing days, &quot;It was different back then. It&#x27;s fun just how different it was.&quot;

<text>Alagar Kovil or &quot;Allhagar Kovil&quot; is a village in Madurai district in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu. The history and living of the village is centered around Kallazhagar Temple. Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is glorified in the &quot;Nalayira Divya Prabandham&quot;, the early medieval Tamil canon of the Alvar saints from the 6th–9th centuries CE. It is one of the 108 &quot;Divya Desams&quot; dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshiped as Kallalagar and his consort Lakshmi as Tirumamagal.

==Kallalagar Temple==

Kallalagar Temple covers an area of about and has a five-tiered &quot;gopuram&quot; (gateway tower). The temple is enclosed in a rectangular enclosure with huge granite walls. The central shrine houses the image of the presiding deity, Sundarabahu Perumal in standing posture. The images of Sridevi and Bhudevi are also housed in the sanctum. There are two life size images of Narasimha, the avatar of Vishnu. One of them is shown holding the demon Hiranya and other slaying him.

The temple houses some rare Vijayanagara sculptures similar to the ones present in Soundararajaperumal Temple, Thadikombu, Krishnapuram Venkatachalapathy temple, Srivilliputhur Divya Desam and Jalakandeswarar Temple, Vellore. The temple also has one of the unique deities Chakaratalvar (Alvar) where the god with chakram having 16 hands and 16 weapons is without Narasimha above him.

=== Chithirai Festival ===

Chithirai festival of this temple celebrated for ten days is one of the declared festivals of Tamil Nadu government. This festival day is declared as a local holiday. In Chithirai (April–May), Kallalagar starts from Alagar Kovil in the form of Kallar
 and reaches Madurai on Pournami (Full Moon day). Here he steps into river Vaigai in his Horse Vaganam. Lakhs of devotees flock to river Vaigai to see this event. &quot;Ethir Sevai&quot; festival is celebrated on the day before Alagar steps into river Vaigai. Ethir Sevai is a part of the Chithirai Tiruvila of the Kallalagar temple at Alagar Kovil and begins on the fourth day. On this day, Alagar or Vishnu changes his appearance as Kallar and travels via Kallar Nadu and enters Madurai and the city&#x27;s residents welcome him. It is a tradition for the people of Madurai to welcome Alagar.

As Alagar returns from Vandiyur Dhasavatharam, festival is celebrated throughout the night at Ramarayar Mandapam in the Northern part of river Vaigai. After this event, Alagar is taken to Mysore Veera Mandapam on decorated Anantharayar Palanquin. The next morning Alagar in the form of Kallar returns to Alagar kovil in ‘Poo Pallakku&#x27; (Palanquin decorated with flowers)

In the month of April and May, each year the great Chitra festival is celebrated on Pournami (full moon day). The festival dramatically re-enacts the visitation of Kallalagar to Madurai from Alagar Koyil. Lakhs of devotees flock to river Vaigai to personally witness the event of Alagar stepping down into the river and to get his blessings.

During the months of July and August the festival of Adi Brahmotsavam is being celebrated for 10 days. This festival occurs within the precincts of the shrine. Devotees from different parts of Tamilnadu throng to participate in this festival. The temple car ‘Amaiththa Narayanan’ is taken in procession during Pournami (Full-Moon day) of Adi (Brahmotsavam).

<text>Kevin James Mawae (; born January 23, 1971) is an American former professional football player who was a center in the National Football League (NFL) for 16 seasons. Mawae played college football for the LSU Tigers, earning first-team All-SEC honors. He was selected by the Seattle Seahawks in the second round of the 1994 NFL draft. After joining the New York Jets in 1998, he received six consecutive Pro Bowl selections and five-first All-Pro honors during his eight seasons with the team. Mawae spent his final four seasons as a member of the Tennessee Titans, extending his Pro Bowl selections to eight and his first-team All-Pro honors to seven. Near the end of his career, he also served two terms as NFLPA president from 2008 to 2012.

Following his retirement, Mawae pursued a coaching career and was hired by the Colts in 2021 as their assistant offensive line coach. He was inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2019.

==Early life==
A military brat, Mawae grew up wherever his father, Sgt. 1st Class David Mawae, was stationed. Born in Savannah, Georgia, while his father served at Hunter Army Airfield, he spent three years of his childhood (ages 5–7) in Fort Riley, Kansas, and then five years (ages 8–12) in Hanau, (Germany) when his father was stationed at Fliegerhorst Army Airfield. It was in Hanau where Mawae began playing football. His father was then stationed at Fort Polk, near Leesville, Louisiana. Mawae attended Leesville High School, where he was an all-state football selection and earned all-academic honors.

==College career==
Mawae attended Louisiana State University, where he played for the LSU Tigers football team from 1989 to 1993. He was redshirted in 1989. He started seven games at left tackle and was a freshman All-SEC selection in 1990, and also was the Tigers&#x27; long snapper.

After his sophomore season, he was a first-team All-SEC selection, having played three different positions: left tackle (8 games), center (3 games), and left guard (1 game). As a junior, he played left tackle and was chosen second-team All-SEC and was a third-team All-American. For his senior season he moved from left tackle to center for all 11 games.

==Professional career==
===Seattle Seahawks===
Mawae was selected by the Seattle Seahawks in the second round (36th overall) of the 1994 NFL draft. He was Louisiana State&#x27;s highest selected offensive lineman since Bo Strange in 1961. Mawae saw his first pro action at right guard against the Los Angeles Raiders on September 11, and never left the lineup after taking over early in the game versus the Indianapolis Colts. He finished the season playing in 14 games, starting the final 11 at right guard.

After the season Mawae earned first-team All-Rookie honors from Pro Football Weekly/Pro Football Writers Association, College and Pro Football Newsweekly and Football News.

In 1995, he started all 16 games at right guard, seeing time at center in two games. In his first two seasons he helped pave the way for Seahawks running back Chris Warren to have back-to-back Pro Bowl seasons of over 1,300 yards rushing.

He was moved to the center position at the start of his 1996 season and remained at that spot for the rest of his NFL career.

===New York Jets===
In 1998, Mawae was signed by the New York Jets. In his first season in New York, the Jets&#x27; offense averaged 357.2 yards per game (second-best in AFC and fourth-best in NFL), while controlling the ball for an average of 32:17 minutes per game (second-best in AFC and third-best in NFL), also helped running back Curtis Martin to rush for franchise-record eight 100-yard rushing games en route to 1,287-yard season. He started all 16 games. In 1999, he was named to his first Pro Bowl on December 22, he did not miss a play for the second straight season and paved the way for Martin&#x27;s then franchise-record of 1,464 yards rushing, and snapped to three different quarterbacks; Vinny Testaverde, Rick Mirer and Ray Lucas.

During the 2000 NFL season, he was a member of an offensive line that managed to tie the Indianapolis Colts for the fewest sacks allowed during the regular season with 20. Also, he helped the Jets offense average 337.2 yards per game which was the 12th best in the NFL and the passing offense averaged 245.3 yards per game (sixth in NFL). Mawae earned his second consecutive starting spot as an AFC team Pro Bowl center when he was selected to the Pro Bowl on six consecutive occasions (1999–2004). In 2002, he underwent offseason shoulder surgery to repair damage to his left rotator cuff; he missed two preseason games but kept his consecutive games started streak by making 124th consecutive starts. In the season opener against the Buffalo Bills. his unbroken streak of 177 games came to an end in October 2005 with a serious triceps injury to his left arm, and he missed the rest of the season. On March 5, 2006, he was cut by the Jets.

===Tennessee Titans===
After being cut by the Jets, Mawae was signed by the Tennessee Titans nine days later on March 14, 2006. In his first season with Tennessee, he helped the offense rank third in the AFC and fifth in the NFL in rushing with 2,214 yards. The Titans set a franchise record by averaging 4.7 yards per carry, and the offensive line, led by Mawae, finished tied for 10th in the league with only 29 sacks allowed, Titans running back Travis Henry finished 2006 with 1,211 rushing yards and rookie quarterback Vince Young was named AP Offensive Rookie of the Year.

In 2007, Mawae was voted team captain and started 14 games, helping LenDale White register his first career 1,000-yard season as he finished with 1,110.

In 2009, Mawae was ranked fifth in a &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; poll of &quot;dirty players&quot;. The magazine surveyed 296 NFL players to come up with the ranking. Mawae was quoted on the Titans&#x27; site as saying he was &quot;proud&quot; of the recognition because he plays the game hard. &quot;I’ve been known to leg whip a time or two. I&#x27;ve paid the price for those, both physically and in the pocket.

On September 10, 2010, Mawae announced that he was retiring from the NFL after 16 years in the league. Mawae would be elected to his 7th and 8th Pro Bowl for the 2008 and 2009 seasons. His last game was the 2009 Pro Bowl in February 2010.

On February 2, 2019, Mawae was announced to be a part of the 2019 Pro Football Hall of Fame class.

==NFL Players Association==
Mawae joined the NFLPA&#x27;s executive committee in 2002, where he was elected president in March 2008 and was re-elected in 2010. In September 2010, Mawae announced his retirement from the NFL, however he continued to serve as president until the end of his term in March 2012. Mawae&#x27;s term coincided with the death of longtime NFLPA executive director Gene Upshaw and the 2011 NFL lockout, which Mawae has stated he believes hastened the end of his playing career.

During the NFL kickoff game broadcast in 2010, players from the New Orleans Saints and Minnesota Vikings &quot;raised an index finger&quot; as they took the field, a gesture Mawae has called &quot;one of the proudest moments I ever had&quot;.

It was under his presidency that active players were present for negotiations of the collective bargaining agreement. He has also served as an assistant coach in the annual NFLPA Collegiate Bowl.

==Coaching career==
In 2016, Mawae joined the Chicago Bears coaching staff as an assistant offensive line coach. He was not retained by the Bears for the 2017 season.

In March 2018 Mawae joined the Arizona State University football staff as a quality control analyst where he was reunited with his former New York Jets head coach, Herm Edwards.

In February 2021, Mawae joined the Indianapolis Colts football staff as an assistant offensive line coach.

On January 23, 2023, Mawae became the head coach of the Lipscomb Academy football team in Nashville, Tennessee, replacing Trent Dilfer. On November 3, 2023, he and Lipscomb Academy &quot;mutually agreed to part ways&quot; after the school received a two-year post-season ban for violating a recruiting rule, two of which took place prior to him becoming the head coach.

==Personal life==
Mawae is of Hawaiian descent. Mawae is married to Tracy Dale Hicks, he proposed to her in the summer of 1992 at LSU Fan Day in front of 140 teammates, 10 coaches and 3,000 fans over the public address system, the couple has a son, Kirkland (born 1997), and a daughter, Abigail (born 2000). The Mawaes were residing in Franklin, Tennessee, until selling the property in 2012. Kevin and his family have since settled back in their home in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

Before his NFL career, Mawae lost his brother, John, in a car accident. John, a former nose guard at LSU, left a profound effect on Kevin by establishing a strong faith prior to his death. Mawae&#x27;s tragic loss inspired him to develop a strong Christian faith.

===Off the field===
During the 2008 offseason, Mawae and his family spent two weeks in Africa with Children&#x27;s Cup International Relief, a missions organization that the Mawae family has helped support financially. They traveled primarily in Swaziland, Mozambique, Zambia and Tanzania. He was Eddie Towne&#x27;s favorite player in ESPN&#x27;s hit show &quot;TILT&quot;. He created the First and Goal Challenge, a unique program to benefit Winthrop-University Hospital&#x27;s outstanding Child Life Program and Pediatric Services.

<doc id="1278412" wikidata="Q1555548" url="?curid=1278412" title="Jonathan Vilma">
<text>Jonathan Polynice Vilma (born April 16, 1982) is an American color analyst and former professional football player in the National Football League (NFL). He played as a linebacker and was a three-time Pro Bowl selection.

Vilma played college football for the Miami Hurricanes, winning a national championship in 2001. He was selected by the New York Jets in the first round of the 2004 NFL draft. Vilma won a Super Bowl championship with the New Orleans Saints. He serves as a color analyst for the NFL on Fox. He previously worked at ESPN as a college football commentator and studio analyst. Vilma was elected as a member of the Orange Bowl Committee in 2018.

==Early life==
Vilma was born in the East Harlem neighborhood of New York City to Haitian immigrant parents. His family moved to Coral Gables, Florida, when Vilma was 6 years old, where he attended G. W. Carver Middle School and later Coral Gables Senior High School, where he was a teammate of Pro Bowl running back Frank Gore.

==College career==
Vilma received an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Miami, and played for coach Butch Davis and coach Larry Coker&#x27;s Miami Hurricanes football teams from 2000 to 2003.

===2000 season===
In 2000, Vilma played in all 11 games as a reserve middle linebacker and compiled 38 tackles (29 solo) and a pass deflection.

===2001 season===
After the graduation of Dan Morgan, Vilma stepped into the starting middle linebacker role and played an integral role on the Hurricanes&#x27; National Championship team. He led the team in tackles with 79 (54 solo) and compiled two forced fumbles, one fumble recovery for a 36-yard touchdown, three pass deflections and an interception. He started 11 of 12 games during the regular season and was selected on the First-team All-Big East team.

===2002 season===
Vilma led Miami in tackles with 133 (75 solo), and had two quarterback sacks, a forced fumble, recovered two fumbles, (returning one for a touchdown) and broke up five passes. He earned unanimous first-team All-Big East selection for the second time in his career and was a semi-finalist for the Dick Butkus Award, along with teammate D. J. Williams.

===2003 season===
In his final year, Vilma led the team in tackles for a third time with 127 (81 solo), with one sack, forced one fumble, and recovered three fumbles. Vilma ended the year as a finalist for the Butkus Award.

Along with his success on the field, Vilma was a three-time Academic All-Big East Conference. He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in finance from the University of Miami&#x27;s School of Business Administration.

Vilma was interviewed about his time at the University of Miami for the documentary &quot;The U&quot;, which premiered December 12, 2009, on ESPN.

==Professional career==
===New York Jets===
Vilma was drafted by the Jets in the first round with the 12th selection in the 2004 NFL draft.

====2004====
In 2004, Vilma was named as the NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year by the Associated Press. During his rookie campaign, he recorded 107 tackles, two sacks, and three interceptions, one of which was returned for his first NFL touchdown.

====2005====
In 2005, Vilma led the NFL in tackles with 169, forced four fumbles, notched one fumble recovery, half a sack, and one interception. Vilma also replaced Zach Thomas at the 2006 Pro Bowl.

====2006====
In 2006, Vilma put together another solid season. He compiled 114 tackles, one forced fumble, one fumble recovery, and one interception.

====2007====
On October 27, 2007, Vilma was placed on injured reserve. He suffered a season ending knee injury during the New York Jets week 7 game against the Cincinnati Bengals.

===New Orleans Saints===

====2008====
On February 29, 2008, the Jets traded Vilma to the New Orleans Saints for a fourth-round draft pick in the 2008 NFL draft and a conditional pick in the 2009 NFL draft (ultimately a third-round pick). Jets then-head coach Eric Mangini elected to start linebackers Eric Barton and David Harris in his place.

In his first season with the Saints, Vilma was a bright spot on a weak defensive unit. Vilma played in all 16 games, and recorded 132 tackles with one sack.

====2009: Super Bowl year====

On February 27, 2009, Vilma signed a five-year, $34 million contract with the Saints. Vilma was elected one of the defensive captains, led the team in tackles, had three interceptions, and was chosen for his second Pro Bowl. In Super Bowl XLIV on February 7, 2010, Vilma made several important plays, including making a key defensive audible and deflecting a pass on 3rd and 11 in the fourth quarter. The Saints beat the Indianapolis Colts 31–17.

====2010–2011====
Vilma again led the team in tackles in 2010, started every game, and was selected to the Pro Bowl. He was ranked 37th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2011. In 2011, he started and played in 11 games but was inactive for five others with a knee injury. He was ranked 58th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2012.

====2012: Bounty scandal====
Vilma was a central figure in the New Orleans Saints bounty scandal. The NFL alleged that defensive coordinator Gregg Williams operated an incentive program, which paid out &quot;bounties&quot; for deliberately putting opposing players out of games. The league alleged that Vilma offered $10,000 cash to anyone who knocked Brett Favre out of the 2009 NFC Championship Game. Most notably, Favre was forced out of the game for one play with an ankle injury. Although up to 27 players were accused of involvement, Vilma was the only player initially singled out by the league for his role. The NFL suspended Vilma for the entire 2012 season on May 2, 2012. The suspension was reported to be the longest suspension related to in-game misconduct in modern NFL history, dwarfing the previous record of five games handed to Albert Haynesworth for stomping on Andre Gurode&#x27;s head in 2006. The league contended that Vilma and defensive end Will Smith aided Williams in starting the alleged program in 2009. Vilma found out about the suspension when it was announced on &quot;SportsCenter&quot;, immediately announced his intent to appeal and adamantly denied that he was involved in any sort of bounty scheme. Vilma filed a personal slander suit against Roger Goodell.

Opinions about the suspensions were divided, as alleged targets like Favre and Kurt Warner claimed that incentive programs were part of the game, which was corroborated by former players interviewed by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. On July 26, Vilma and seven witnesses from the Saints (along with a sworn affidavit from Drew Brees) testified to a federal judge in New Orleans that NFL commissioner Roger Goodell misrepresented the facts in the league&#x27;s investigation. Vilma&#x27;s suspension was overturned on September 7, and he was reinstated for the 2012 season. The Associated Press reported Roger Goodell&#x27;s disappointment in the determination of the arbitration board&#x27;s ruling.

On October 9, 2012, the league again suspended Vilma, Browns linebacker Scott Fujita, Saints defensive end Will Smith and free-agent defensive end Anthony Hargrove. Vilma&#x27;s suspension lasted throughout the entire 2012 season, but he was allowed to retain his paychecks (when he was on the Physically Unable to Perform list) for the first six weeks of the season. The suspensions were then reviewed by former NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, who overruled Roger Goodell and vacated the suspensions on December 11, 2012. Vilma continued his defamation lawsuit against commissioner Goodell, but it was ultimately dismissed in January 2013.

In total, Vilma played in 11 games during the 2012 season.

====2013====
Vilma underwent knee surgery during the preseason and was placed on the Reserve/Injured Designated for Return list, with the hope that he would recover in time to play during the season. He was reactivated for the Saints&#x27; eighth game, a 26–20 loss to his former team, the New York Jets, and was in the game for only 12 defensive snaps. The following week, he was again placed on injured reserve, ending his 2013 season.

====2014====
On February 12, 2014, Vilma&#x27;s contract was not renewed with the New Orleans Saints. He became a guest analyst on &quot;Bleacher Report&quot;.

Vilma officially retired from football, and was honored by the Saints before their home game on December 6, 2015.

====2017====
Vilma was inducted into the New Orleans Saints Hall of Fame on October 29, 2017.

==NFL career statistics==

==Personal life==
Vilma is a spokesman for Under Armour and WaterBank of America USA Inc.

His parents, Fritz Vilma and Nelly Banatte, migrated to the United States from Haiti in the 1970s. After the 2010 earthquake, he was active in relief efforts.

Vilma started the Jonathan Vilma Foundation after the 2010 Haiti earthquake to help with the rebuilding efforts in Haiti, in particular a charter school to educate students from elementary school to high school.

<text>Dia (Ancient Greek: Δία or Δῖα, &quot;heavenly&quot;, &quot;divine&quot; or &quot;she who belongs to Zeus&quot;), in ancient Greek religion and folklore, may refer to:

* Dia, a goddess venerated at Phlius and Sicyon. She was seen by the locals as identical to Hebe and/or Ganymeda.
*Dia, daughter of Aeolus, keeper of the winds and Telepora or Telepatra, daughter of Laestrygon. She was the sister of Androcles, Chrysippus, Iocastus, Phalacrus, Pheraemon, Xuthus, and the daughters&#x27; as Aeole, Astycrateia, Hephaestia, Iphthe and Periboea.
* Dia, daughter of King Porthaon of Calydon and mother of Thersites and possibly the remaining five sons by Agrius.
* Dia, daughter of the king Lycaon (thus sister of Callisto), mother of Dryops by Apollo. She concealed her new-born infant in a hollow oak tree.
* Dia, second wife of the Thracian king Phineus and by him, mother of Mariandynus and Thynus. She falsely accused of rape her step sons, Parthenius and Crambis, leading to their blindness and eventual imprisonment by Phineus.
* Dia, the Perrhaebian daughter of Deioneus or Eioneus, wife of Ixion (who killed her father so as to not pay the bride price) and with her husband, she became mother of the Lapith Pirithous, whose marriage to Hippodameia was the occasion of the Lapiths&#x27; battle with the Centaurs. According to Homer, after having sex with Zeus, who was disguised as a stallion, she gave birth to Pirithous; a folk etymology derived Pirithous&#x27; name from &quot;peritheein (&quot;περιθεῖν &quot;to run around&quot;), because that was what Zeus did to seduce Dia. The Jovian moon Dia is named after this Dia.
* Dia, alternate name for Hippodamia, the wife of Pirithous (thus daughter-in-law of another Dia).
*Dia, mother of Pittheus by Pelops. She may have been identical with another Hippodamia, daughter of Oenomaus.

In ancient Roman religion, Dia may refer to Dea Dia.

<doc id="1278419" wikidata="Q970940" url="?curid=1278419" title="Łęczyca Voivodeship">
<text>Łęczyca Voivodeship () was a unit of administrative division and local government in Poland from the 14th century until the partitions of Poland in 1772–1795. It was part of Greater Poland Province, and its capital was in Łęczyca. The voivodeship had the area of 4,080 square kilometers, divided into three counties. Local sejmiks took place at Łęczyca. The city of Łódź, which until the 19th century was a small town, for centuries belonged to Łęczyca Voivodeship.

==History==
The voivodeship was created by King Wladyslaw Lokietek, out of the territory of Duchy of Łęczyca, which had been established after the 1138 Testament of Bolesław III Krzywousty. It had five senators in the Senate of the Kingdom of Poland (since 1569 the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth). These were: Voivode of Łęczyca, Castellan of Łęczyca, Castellan of Brzeziny, Castellan of Inowlodz, and Castellan of Konary. At the sejmiks, local nobility elected four deputies to the Sejm of Poland, and two deputies to the Greater Poland Tribunal at Piotrków Trybunalski.

Zygmunt Gloger in his monumental book Historical Geography of the Lands of Old Poland gives a detailed description of Łęczyca Voivodeship:

&quot;Following the testament of Boleslaw Krzywousty, the Land of Łęczyca was a separate duchy, ruled by princes of the Piast dynasty (...) King Wladyslaw Lokietek reunited the duchy with Poland, making it a separate voivodeship. Local residents were used to their own legal system, so King Władysław II Jagiełło decided to keep a separate official there. In 1418, the szlachta of Łęczyca established its own rules, the 27 Articles of Constitutiones Terrae Lanciciensis generales (...)

The voivodeship had the area of 80 square miles, stretching from Klodawa in the north, to the Pilica river in the south, where it bordered Sandomierz Voivodeship. In the 16th century, it had 74 Roman-Catholic parishes, 25 towns and 875 villages. It was the second most densely populated voivodeship of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, behind Brześć Kujawski Voivodeship (...)

Łęczyca Voivodeship had five senators: the Voivode of Łęczyca, the Castellan of Łęczyca, and the Castellans of Brzeziny, Inowlodz, and Konary (...) Of the three counties, the largest one was Łęczyca County, which covered more than half of the area of the voivodeship. Local sejmiks took place at Łęczyca, where four deputies were elected to the Sejm, and additional two to the Greater Poland Tribunal at Piotrków Trybunalski. Main starostas resided at Łęczyca, Inowlodz, Zgierz and Klodawa&quot;.

<text>The Complutensian Polyglot Bible is the name given to the first printed polyglot of the entire Bible. The edition was initiated and financed by Cardinal Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros (1436–1517) and published by Complutense University in Alcalá de Henares, Spain. It includes the first printed editions of the Greek New Testament, the complete Septuagint, and the Targum Onkelos, a translation of the Torah. Of the 600 six-volume sets which were printed, only 123 are known to have survived to date.

== History ==

===Precedents===
The polyglot Bible was the result of Spain&#x27;s long-lasting tradition of translations of texts. Through centuries the intellectual class of the Iberian peninsula had developed a deep understanding of the issues of translation and the difficulty of conveying, or even interpreting meaning correctly across languages. Religious texts were known to be particularly difficult due to their high metaphorical content and how dependent on the context in which they were written they tended to be. This sparked a debate in Spain about the convenience of continuing the translation of religious texts, and the best way to do it, over a century prior to the Reformation.

The customary answer to this debate was to ask religious authorities to examine the translation and cross-check and compare different translations with contemporary Castilian, but that in turn created a debate about the qualifications of the religious authority itself to properly translate from the original sources. One of the answers to this debate was the polyglot Bible, which Cisneros hoped would end the issue forever.

===Translation process===
Diego López de Zúñiga was the chief editor, and was fluent in Latin as well as both Aramaic and Arabic. He was given a team of various translators. Converted translators and academics were favoured and specifically sought since they were fluent in the source languages and the cultures of the texts. Second in command, Alfonso de Zamora (14761544) was a converted Jewish scholar, an expert in Talmudic studies, and spoke Hebrew as his first language. Other &quot;conversos&quot; working on the project were Alfonso de Alcalá and Pablo de Coronel. Demetrius Ducas (a scholar from Crete), Hernán Núñez de Toledo (&quot;The Pincian&quot;) and Juan de Vergara were in charge of the translation from Greek manuscripts. Antonio de Nebrija was specifically called for the translation of the Latin Vulgate. Hernán Núñez de Toledo was also the chief Latinist.
The scholars met in Alcalá de Henares, a city near Madrid also known by its Latin name &quot;Complutum&quot;, at Complutense University. 

The New Testament was completed and printed in 1514, but its publication was delayed while work on the Old Testament continued, so they could be published together as a complete work.

===Delays===
The Complutensian Old Testament was completed in 1517. Cardinal Cisneros died in July 1517, five months after the Polyglot&#x27;s completion, and never saw its publication. Further delays happened when, following the death of Cardinal Cisneros, the text was confiscated by the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V.

Erasmus&#x27;s four-year exclusive privilege in 1516 (and the papal privilege given to the &quot;First Biblia Rabbinica&quot; in 1518) may have also been a delaying factor: Pope Leo X finally sanctioned it in 1520. At which time the civil war in Castile, the Revolt of the Comuneros broke out, causing delays.

===Influence===
The direct influence of the Complutensian Polyglot was attenuated because, according to a much later letter of King Philip II of Spain, a significant number of copies were lost in a shipwreck in transit to Italy around 1521.

The Aldine Press based the Old Testament text in the 1518 Aldine Bible on the Complutensian&#x27;s Greek Septuagint, paired with a New Testament based to some extent on Erasmus&#x27;s version. 

Erasmus acknowledged using the Complutensian in the 1527 edition of his &quot;Novum Testamentum&quot;.

== Contents ==

The Complutensian Polyglot Bible was published as a six-volume set. The first four volumes contain the Old Testament. Each page consists of three parallel columns of text: Hebrew on the outside, the Latin Vulgate in the middle (edited by Antonio de Nebrija), and the Greek Septuagint on the inside. On each page of the Pentateuch, the Aramaic text (the Targum Onkelos) and its own Latin translation are added at the bottom. The fifth volume, the New Testament, consists of parallel columns of Greek and the Latin Vulgate. The sixth volume contains various Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek dictionaries and study aids.

Jerome&#x27;s Latin version of the Old Testament was placed between the Greek and Hebrew versions, symbolizing the Roman Church of Christ being surrounded and crucified by the Greek Church and the Jews. This text was collated by Antonio de Nebrija  from manuscript sources, but was left uncorrected. Nebrija eventually resigned from the project after Cisneros refused to allow him to improve the translation, in deference to the desires of the Papacy.

<doc id="1278430" wikidata="Q361564" url="?curid=1278430" title="Geophone">
<text>A geophone is a device that converts ground movement (velocity) into voltage, which may be recorded at a recording station. The deviation of this measured voltage from the base line is called the seismic response and is analyzed for structure of the Earth.

==Etymology==
The term geophone derives from the Greek word &quot;γῆ (ge)
&quot; meaning &quot;earth&quot; and &quot;phone&quot; meaning &quot;sound&quot;.

==Construction==

Geophones have historically been passive analog devices and typically comprise a spring-mounted wire coil moving within the field of a case-mounted permanent magnet to generate an electrical signal. Recent designs have been based on microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology which generates an electrical response to ground motion through an active feedback circuit to maintain the position of a small piece of silicon.

The response of a coil/magnet geophone is proportional to ground velocity, while MEMS devices usually respond proportional to
acceleration. MEMS have a much higher noise level (50 dB velocity higher) than geophones and can only be used in strong motion or active seismic applications.
==Frequency response==
The frequency response of a geophone is that of a harmonic oscillator, fully determined by corner frequency (typically around 10 Hz) and damping (typically 0.707). Since the corner frequency is proportional to the inverse square root of the moving mass, geophones with low corner frequencies (&lt; 1 Hz) become impractical. It is possible to lower the corner frequency electronically, at the price of higher noise and cost.

Although waves passing through the Earth have a three-dimensional nature, geophones are normally constrained to respond to single dimension - usually the vertical. However, some applications require the full wave to be used and three-component or 3-C geophones are used. In analog devices, three moving coil elements are mounted in an orthogonal arrangement within a single case.

== Distinction from seismometers ==
Geophones are similar to seismometers in their design and are also used to register seismic waves. In the past, there were clear differences between geophones and seismometers. Compared to conventional geophones, seismometers are more suitable for detecting extremely small ground movements as they cover a wider frequency band, including the frequency range below their natural frequency, usually from 0.01 to 50 Hz. In conventional geophones, the frequency band is in the range of 1-15 Hz. They are cheaper than seismometers and are therefore more commonly used in arrays for large area detection with better specialised resolution. However, with the development of new technologies, the frequency coverage in compact devices has also increased significantly, so that geophones can now cover frequency bands from 0 to 500 Hz and the boundaries between geophones and seismometers are becoming blurred.
==Uses==

The majority of geophones are used in reflection seismology to record the energy waves reflected by the subsurface geology. In this case the primary interest is in the vertical motion of the Earth&#x27;s surface. However, not all the waves are upwards traveling. A strong, horizontally transmitted wave known as ground-roll also generates vertical motion that can obliterate the weaker vertical signals. By using large areal arrays tuned to the wavelength of the ground-roll the dominant noise signals can be attenuated and the weaker data signals reinforced.

Analog geophones are very sensitive devices which can respond to very distant tremors. These small signals can be drowned by larger signals from local sources. It is possible though to recover the small signals caused by large but distant events by correlating signals from several geophones deployed in an array. Signals which are registered only at one or few geophones can be attributed to unwanted, local events and thus discarded. It can be assumed that small signals that register uniformly at all geophones in an array can be attributed to a distant and therefore significant event.

The sensitivity of passive geophones is typically 30 volts per (meter per second), so they are in general not a replacement for 
broadband seismometers.

Conversely, some applications of geophones are interested only in very local events. A notable example is in the application of remote ground sensors (RGS) incorporated in unattended ground sensor (UGS) systems. In such an application there is an area of interest which when penetrated a system operator is to be informed, perhaps by an alert which could be accompanied by supporting photographic data.

Geophones were used on the Moon for a number of active and passive experiments as part of the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package.

<text>Boyer () is a French surname. In rarer cases, it can be a corruption or deliberate alteration of other names.

== Origins and statistics ==
Boyer is found traditionally along the Mediterranean (Provence, Languedoc), the Rhône valley, Auvergne, Limousin, Périgord and more generally in the Southwest of France. It is also found in the north of the country. There are two variant spellings: Boyé (southwest) and Bouyer (Loire-Atlantique, Charente-Maritime).

, Boyer ranks 55th in the most common surnames in France. For the period 1891–1990 it ranked 34th.

Like many other surnames, it used to be a nickname describing somebody&#x27;s job: &quot;bullock driver&quot;, &quot;cowherd&quot;, that is to say &quot;Bouvier&quot; in common French. It derives mainly from the Occitan &quot;buòu&quot; &quot;ox&quot;, with the suffix &quot;-iar / -ier&quot;, frenchified phonetically or, further north, sometimes from a variant form in dialectal French &quot;bô, bou&quot; &quot;ox&quot; corresponding to common French &quot;bœuf&quot; with the suffix &quot;-ier&quot;. In French, the modern spelling &quot;-oyer&quot; avoids confusion between &quot;-oi-er&quot; and &quot;-oier&quot; .

In rarer cases, it can be a corruption or deliberate alteration of several other names :
# In England, it may come from bowyer, meaning &quot;bow maker&quot; or &quot;bow seller.&quot;
# In Turkish, the name may come from &quot;boy-er&quot;, &quot;boy&quot; meaning &quot;size&quot; or &quot;stature&quot; and &quot;er&quot; meaning &quot;man&quot; or &quot;soldier.&quot;
# It can also be a corruption or deliberate alteration of German names like Bayer or Bauer.

<text>Benchmark is a venture capital firm founded in 1995 by Bob Kagle, Bruce Dunlevie, Andy Rachleff, Kevin Harvey, and Val Vaden.

Benchmark is noted for creating the first equal ownership and compensation structure for its partners. The &quot;maverick&quot; firm differs from most VC firms, which are named for their founders and are structured hierarchically; Benchmark was described by &quot;Fortune&quot; as &quot;a lean operation in which its six full-time partners share profits equally.&quot; While there are no differentiation between its &quot;junior partners&quot; and &quot;senior partners,&quot; there is also no CEO-like position held.

==In popular culture==
Benchmark Capital was featured in the Apple TV+ original TV series &quot;WeCrashed&quot; starring Jared Leto and Anne Hathaway. In the show, Anthony Edwards portrays Benchmark co-founder Bruce Dunlevie, who became WeWork&#x27;s first major investor on the 1st of April in 2012 when Benchmark led WeWork&#x27;s $17 million Series-A seed funding.

Benchmark was also featured in the Showtime original &quot;Super Pumped&quot; starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt. In the series, Kyle Chandler plays Benchmark General Partner Bill Gurley, portraying his involvement in leading Ubers&#x27; $11 million round of fundraising in February 2011.

<doc id="1278448" wikidata="Q562286" url="?curid=1278448" title="Daewon Song">
<text>Daewon Song (born February 19, 1975) () is an American professional skateboarder. He is the co-founder and co-owner of Almost Skateboards and Thank You Skateboards, and continues to skate for the latter company. Song was named the 2006 &quot;Skater of the Year&quot; by &quot;Thrasher&quot; magazine, an award that is widely considered to be one of the most significant honors in skateboarding.

==Early life==
Song, a Korean American, was born in Seoul, South Korea, and grew up in Gardena, California, following a year spent with his grandmother in Hawaii. During the first half of his life, Song was raised by his older sister, who also raised Song&#x27;s brother. Song revealed in a &quot;Milestone&quot; interview for &quot;The Skateboard Mag&quot; that both of his parents were perceived as &quot;insane&quot; by their neighbors due to their constant fighting—Song explained that, on occasion, he would need to telephone the police. Song&#x27;s mother, who once shot her husband in the face, died in 1999, predeceasing Song&#x27;s father.

When he was fourteen years of age, Song started skateboarding during a two-month period when his parents were separated—he was given his first skateboard by his mother and was later sponsored by a skateboard shop in the South Bay area of Los Angeles, California called Sporting Ideas. Prior to this, Song received attention for his artistic abilities, winning drawing contests and engaging in the commercial art field at a very young age. Song provided insight into his family life in a 2005 interview:
You know Asian parents, man; they&#x27;re gnarly. They want you to become some lead pianist in an orchestra or, like every parent, they want you to become a doctor. I was really into art when I was a young kid, and I won a lot of awards, so my parents thought that&#x27;s what I&#x27;d pursue. Then I got picked up in skateboarding and started getting free stuff. They were tripping, like, &quot;Where are you getting all this free stuff?&quot; They thought I was stealing money from them.

Song attended the 135th Street school in Gardena, known for its aggressive reputation, and has explained the challenges that were present while he was growing up in the area, where gang activity was prolific:
Around my neighborhood, skating was actually big for a time, like in the early &#x27;90s. Then it started to die out. There was a lot of gang banging going on in my old neighborhood in Gardena. I was seriously the only skateboarder left at my school. I just hung in there ... A lot of guys quit skating, one got killed, another guy was tagging on a freeway and got killed. I watched all these friends of mine getting into the stupidest things. And I was like, dude, I just need to stick with this skateboard thing. But I didn&#x27;t stick with it as a career; I just thought it was something to do after school, y&#x27;know? Skateboarding&#x27;s changed so much now. It&#x27;s like kids skate just to get sponsored. Back then we skated the curb at Rally&#x27;s burgers just for something to do.

Song has relayed that he sighted Rodney Mullen skateboarding at his school and that Mullen, in turn, had observed Song skateboarding there. Song explained in a 2012 interview that his friend at the time spoke with Mullen and the professional skateboarder revealed that he was impressed by Song&#x27;s skills and wanted to send Song skateboard decks to ride as an introduction to Mullen&#x27;s fledgling business. Song agreed to the proposal and the relationship between the two skateboarders, now co-owners of the Almost Skateboards company, commenced at that point in time. Mullen became a mentor figure to Song and the latter became a team rider for the Tensor company as the result of this relationship (as of July 2014, Song continues to be sponsored by Tensor).

==Career==
===World Industries===
Song became sponsored by World Industries at the age of sixteen years and appeared in numerous video productions for the company, including &quot;Love Child&quot; (1992). It is in &quot;Love Child&quot; that Song documented the first hardflip on film. Song has spoken about his time with World Industries in numerous interviews, particularly focusing on his time at the World Industries indoor skate park and being involved with a company that was overseen by Steve Rocco, the founder of World Industries and former business partner of Rodney Mullen—Mullen would later become a close friend and mentor to Song. Videographer, Socrates Leal, who filmed a large portion of the World Industries/Dwindle Distribution footage since the company&#x27;s inception, released footage from the World Park as part of the &quot;30 Shot&quot; web-based project, including segments that feature Song. Leal has revealed during his narration for one of the segments that Song has always possessed a clear awareness of what aspects of his skateboarding he would like filmed and would often instruct the filmer while skateboarding.

&quot;Love Child&quot; was then followed up by &quot;New World Order&quot; (1993) and Song has explained that the skateboarding world had significantly changed in the one-year period between the videos:
Then in &#x27;93, with New World Order, things got more serious. More skaters started coming up, and if you were filming something and someone already did it, you&#x27;d have to come up with something better. From that point on, filming got a lot harder.

Song stated during his &quot;Epicly Later&#x27;d&quot; episode for &quot;Vice&quot; magazine&#x27;s web channel that he misses his time at World Industries.

===Ankle injury===
In a July 2012 interview with the online magazine, &quot;Jenkem&quot;, Song revealed that he seriously contemplated ceasing skateboarding between the years 1996 and 1997, following an ankle injury that he sustained during the &quot;New World Order&quot; period. During this period, Song stated that he was predominantly located in the Long Beach area of Los Angeles while in a relationship with a girlfriend who was a member of the Bloods. Song considered a living modifying cars and eventually returned to skateboarding following a telephone call from his mentor, Rodney Mullen. Song had gone into further detail about this period of his life in a 2005 interview:
I lost touch with a lot of girls, and then I called Rodney and he wasn&#x27;t doing too good. It was a wake-up call. At that moment I felt like I was a pathetic piece of trash. They did all this for me and I was going to give it up. It was almost as though Rodney brought me into this and had supported me, and now it was my turn to support him. I just woke up and started skating again and tried to make stuff happen again. Then Rodney and me started doing our projects, and everything from that point on has been working out great.

===Matix Clothing===
In 1998, Song founded the Matix Clothing apparel company with fellow professional skateboarder, Tim Gavin (retired), and distribution company, Podium Distribution (the Dunlap brothers, Kevin and Brian). In March 2013, Song explained the initial period of the brand&#x27;s formation:
Gavin brought Rudy Johnson, Jeron Wilson and Sean Sheffey; and then for me, I brought Marc Johnson, Rodney Mullen and, ahh, JB Gillett. And that was our team—including me and Gavin; so there was eight. I remember when it first started—me, Kevin and Brian and Gavin ... just funny how all these things we talked about on the kitchen floor, having pizza, it actually went into motion, and it was, like, &quot;Wow, here are the first samples!&quot;

Song further explained that he was responsible for the origin of the Matix logo, after he drew a squiggle on a napkin that reminded him of someone pushing along on a skateboard. As of 2013, the brand had been existence for fifteen years and Song stated in March of that year, &quot;we are still pushing strong&quot;.

The &quot;Transworld Business&quot; website announced on July 2, 2012, that Matix Clothing had been acquired by &quot;technical apparel brand&quot;, Westlife Distribution; the deal included intellectual property, inventory and accounts receivable.

In a press release on September 4, 2012, Matix announced the re-signing of Daewon Song, Marc Johnson, and Mike Anderson to its team roster (notably absent was young and popular former rider, Torey Pudwill). The press release confirmed the relocation of the brand to Los Angeles, and company president, Brian Dunlap, stated, &quot;I&#x27;m thrilled with the Westlife transition so far, and bringing these guys back onto the program was key. We have longstanding relationships and friendships that were important to keep intact, and the brand image will only grow stronger with such a good crew representing for us.&quot;

As of March 2013, the Matix skate team consisted of Song, Johnson, Mike Anderson, Zach Wallin, Auby Taylor, and Matt Berger—at this time, Song, Johnson, and Anderson all had signature clothing collections for sale. Together with 686, a snowboard company, the company relocated to a new premises in Compton, California, US in 2013. The Matix Fall 2014 catalog video, filmed in the Sierra Nevada region of California, US, was published on the brand&#x27;s Vimeo channel.

A press release from the Sequential Brands Group, which acquired the shoe brand in mid-2012, revealed that Song had renewed his contract with the company for a further three years. The CEO of the licensing and branding company, Colin Dyne, explained in the press release that &quot;It is critically important to us that the authenticity and integrity of the DVS brand remain . By moving forward with Daewon, a legend in the skate arena, DVS is remaining true to its heritage&quot;. Song stated in the same document that &quot;DVS has been family since 1997 and has always had my back 100% and I will always have , 100%!!! Re-signing wasn&#x27;t even a question! Just needed to make sure the damn pen worked!&quot;.

On August 28, 2012, Song revealed in a Twitter post that he had commenced work on a new DVS project.

Song received the cover of &quot;The Skateboard Mag&quot;, as part of a feature on the DVS Shoes tour to Detroit, US that occurred in late-2012—the photo is credited to Anthony Acosta, a close friend of Song. Song was previously featured on the cover of &quot;The Skateboard Mag&quot;, in a photo also taken by Acosta, skating a transitional structure that was tied to the back of a truck in Norwalk, California, US—Acosta has explained:
I found this sheet-metal halfpipe sitting on a truck bed about two miles from where I used to live. I knew Daewon was the guy to call for this natural miniramp. We shot a few things that day and ended up getting a cover of &quot;The Skateboard Mag&quot; with one of the photos.

The DVS Shoes Facebook profile published the advertisement for Song&#x27;s thirteenth signature shoe model, part of the &quot;Daewon Song Signature Series&quot;, named the &quot;Daewon 13&quot;—Song is photographed performing a trick on a rust-covered structure that is in a coastal location.

One-time DVS filmer, Colin Kennedy, released a video compilation that he had produced with the use of footage filmed during the &quot;Skate More&quot; period, entitled &quot;Daewon vs H2O&quot;. The compilation shows various settings in which Song filmed skateboarding tricks in locations where water was a primary factor, including a metropolitan sculpture of a movie reel situated within a pool of water. Part of Kennedy&#x27;s blurb for the video stated, &quot;Daewon likes a challenge. Watch any of his video parts and you&#x27;ll see what I mean ... You name it and he&#x27;s skated it, or at least tried.&quot; The footage that is used in the video was shot between 2002 and 2005.

===Deca===
After nine years with World Industries, Song left the company in 1999 to found Deca Skateboards, with a team that included Chris Haslam, JB Gillet, Shiloh Greathouse, and Marcus McBride (Cooper Wilt was featured in two &quot;hidden parts&quot; in the second Deca video &quot;2nd to None&quot;). After three years of operation, during which time two videos—&quot;Sneak Preview&quot; and &quot;2nd to None&quot;—were produced, Deca ceased operations in 2002. Following the brand&#x27;s demise, McBride moved onto establishing the DGK company with Stevie Williams, Greathouse rode for Stacy Lowery and Michael Sieben&#x27;s Bueno brand, JB Gillet joined the Cliche team, while Wilt and Haslam remained with Song for his next board company Artafact.

===Artafact===
Following the cessation of Deca, Song launched a short-lived company entitled Artafact in 2002, with Haslam and Wilt included as team riders—the brand was dismantled in 2003 after eight to twelve months of operation. In a 2012 interview for the &quot;Weekend Buzz&quot; segment of the internet-based RIDE channel, Haslam provided a perspective on Artafact in relation to Deca: &quot;I think I liked Artafact better—the layout of the ads was always sick. It was nice and clean and there was, like, possibilities to go there, but, you know, I guess it didn&#x27;t really go anywhere, so we changed it.&quot;

Song released a video part on The Berrics in January 2011 that could be purchased for US$0.99. The downloadable part, entitled &quot;New Year&#x27;s Dae&quot;, was made available for sale on January 11—and was thus promoted as a &quot;1.11.11&quot; video part—the part featured a combination of street, park, and transition skateboarding.

The Almost video &quot;5-Incher&quot; was released June 4, 2012, and Mullen is the only team member that is not featured. The film premiered at the Art Theater in Long Beach, California, on May 31, 2012. Song&#x27;s section in &quot;5-Incher&quot; is the penultimate part, with Haslam providing the video&#x27;s &quot;ender&quot; (final section). On June 18, 2012, Song then released additional footage on the internet, entitled &quot;Daewon 5 Incher B-Side Edit&quot;, free of charge.

Song was featured on the cover of the November 2012 issue of &quot;Transworld Skateboarding Japan&quot;—he is shown performing a trick from his &quot;5-Incher&quot; video part. The issue also features a full interview with Song, entitled &quot;Daewon Song Best of 2012&quot;, and was sold with a DVD that consisted of the &quot;5-Incher&quot; video and the Song &quot;B-Sides&quot; edit, among other sections.

Video footage was published throughout 2013 of Song performing new tricks that had not been captured on film before. On June 25, 2013, Song filmed a transition trick that was later called a &quot;bolt slapper&quot;, and on October 10, 2013, Song was filmed a performing a variation of the bolt slapper, the &quot;360 shove it bolt slapper&quot;—both tricks were filmed at the Crailtap skatepark in Torrance, California, US.

The Almost company celebrated its 10th anniversary with an event at the Berrics indoor skate complex in early March 2014, at which team member Youness Amrani was presented with his inaugural professional skateboard deck. Socrates Leal, a longtime videographer for Dwindle Distribution, created a video retrospective of the brand&#x27;s growth since inception, entitled &quot;10 Years of Almost.&quot; At the same time as the 10-year anniversary, the company released a collaborative series of skateboard decks with the DC Comics comic book brand—Song&#x27;s deck features the Batman character. On October 26, 2018, Daewon Song left Almost. He and Torey Pudwill who left Plan B Skateboards made their own project called Thank You Skateboards.

===New sponsors===
In mid-December 2012, Song was added to the team of Brick Harbor, an online skateboard retailer that had been formed earlier in the same year. The announcement was made in the form of a brief video part, entitled &quot;12 Dae&#x27;s of Christmas&quot;, and a corresponding competition. Since the company&#x27;s inception, Brick Harbor&#x27;s team has predominantly consisted of professional skateboarders who had either originated from the East coast of the US, or who continue to be based on that side of the country—riders include Stevie Williams, Jake Johnson, Ishod Wair, Gino Iannucci, and PJ Ladd—and Song is the second West coast team rider to be added to the team, alongside Dennis Busenitz, whose hometown and city of residence is San Francisco, U.S. As of February 2017, though, the company is no longer in business.

During 2012, Song was recruited onto the teams of two new companies that had been founded by fellow professional skateboarders, one who had skated for a clothing company, Matix, that Song had cofounded many years earlier. Paul Rodriguez and Joey Brezinski&#x27;s (Brezinski had signed a contract with Tensor Trucks, the brand that also sponsors Song, in mid-2010) new bearing company, Andale, was officially launched in 2012 and Song left his position on the Bones bearing team (prior to Bones, Song had released signature model bearings and filmed a video part for the FKD company that, as of February 2013, is within the Syndrome Distribution company). Daewon is featured on the team page holding up a selection of Andale stickers and has joined former Almost professional Ryan Sheckler and ex-Deca rider JB Gillett on the team.

Song is a featured as a sponsored rider on the Glassy Sunhaters sunglasses website and online store, co-owned/co-founded by professional skateboarder, Mike Mo Capaldi, and his brother, Vince. Shortly after the addition of Song, a signature sunglasses model, &quot;The Daeviator&quot;, was released and promoted heavily on the relevant websites. The humorous line, &quot;Daewon has personally blessed everyone single pair of these to give you a portion of his balance...you&#x27;re welcome.&quot; accompanied the product&#x27;s page on the Glassy Store website.

Loud Headphones is a company that was founded by professional skateboarders, photographers, and videographers around 2012. The company states that its &quot;main objective above all else is to start something that matters&quot; and places an emphasis upon eco-friendly, low-cost packaging that allows more money to be spent on a worthwhile product and donations to its charitable partner the Let Them Hear Foundation. Song is one of the Loud-sponsored skateboarders, alongside other team members such as Sammy Baca and Fred Gall, and has released signature model earbud headphones.

Song was announced as a team member of the newly formed Knox Hardware brand in early October 2013, alongside Chris Cole. The brand was founded by Song&#x27;s longtime friend and Matix collaborator Gavin, and will also release apparel collections. Gavin explained to &quot;TransWorld Business&quot;: &quot;Knox&#x27;s DNA and the story we want to tell is the Americana blue collar hard worker.&quot; As of February 2017, though, the brand in no longer active.

===Setup===
On January 5, 2013, Song participated in an interview with the Alli Sports website to explain the hardware that he uses for his skateboard. Notable aspects of the interview were: Song rode a wide skateboard deck for over a decade and, in the period leading up to the interview, had followed through with a decision to transition to a wide deck—Song stated, &quot;not much of a huge jump, but ... makes a difference.&quot;; Song appreciates bright-colored skateboards for &quot;something while it&#x27;s flipping&quot;—he cites red and black in the interview as preferred colors; Song tightens his trucks &quot;fairly loose&quot;, with the back truck tighter than the front for stability—Song describes his front truck as &quot;squirrelly&quot;, revealing that he strips down the components of the front truck so that there are only one bushing &quot;below&quot; the truck (between the deck and the truck) and two washers &quot;above&quot; the truck; and Song only rides radius wheels—he states that he has tried to ride wheels, but the difference was too significant.

===Sponsors===
As of February 2019, Song is sponsored by Thank You skateboards, Matix Clothing, adidas Footwear, Tensor Trucks, Andale Bearings, Mob Griptape, Glassy, Spitfire Wheels, and Loud Headphones

===Video game appearances===
Song has made several appearances as a playable character in video games such as &quot;Grind Session&quot;, and the Tony Hawk series of games. He featured as a playable character in many iterations of the Tony Hawk series, starting with &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s American Wasteland&quot;, and appears in every main game since, with the exception of &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Downhill Jam&quot;. He also appears in the game &quot;Tony Hawk: Ride&quot;.

Song participated in &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Secret Skatepark Tour&quot; of America, which was organized to promote one of Hawk&#x27;s video games. Alongside other skateboarders who appeared in the video game, Song toured the U.S. with Hawk&#x27;s entourage and performed at random skatepark locations. During the tour, Song revealed his perspective in a magazine interview: &quot;It&#x27;s pretty crazy. I&#x27;m just used to some team manager knocking on your door, like, &quot;Dude, we gotta get up.&quot; On this one we have like schedules.&quot;

===Contests===
Since cofounding Almost, Song&#x27;s participation in contests has been limited to the single-elimination tournament &quot;X Games Real Street,&quot; in which sponsored skateboarders film a video part that they are judged on. Song competed in the 17th X Games contest in 2011. Alongside Chris Cole, Song was also nominated by Berrics viewers as the most-wanted contestant in the second edition, but failed to enter. Song later explained his reason for not entering contests such as Battle of the Berrics in a July 2013 interview:
Because I&#x27;m just the worst under pressure. When someone tells me that I am supposed to do something, you&#x27;re not going to get it. I&#x27;m gonna slam. It has to be spontaneous for me. Every once in a while, I&#x27;ll get a request and somehow end up doing it, but usually, I can&#x27;t. Even if it&#x27;s fairly easy, I won&#x27;t be able to do it. With those contests, there are all these people watching who have such high expectations for me, I can only lose. I hate it. I don&#x27;t want to let anybody down so I just shut down.

In early 2014, Song was informed that he was a competitor in the &quot;2Up&quot; manual contest that was held at the Berrics and sponsored by Matix. (A manual is a trick whereby the skateboarder only uses two wheels.) The contest was an invitational and Song competed against nine other skateboarders, and the winner was voted by the fans of the website. Song was declared the winner on March 4, 2014 and received a trophy in addition to US$10,000 cash.

Song was selected, again by the Berrics, for the &quot;In Transition&quot; contest that ran during October 2014. The Berrics &quot;picked 10 of the most progressive skaters on the planet to choose one location each—any location in the world—and film a full part,&quot; and Song chose to film his part at Channel Street in Los Angeles, U.S.

===Awards===
In 2006, Song was awarded the &quot;Skater of the Year (SOTY)&quot; title by &quot;Thrasher&quot; magazine. His SOTY feature article appeared in the April 2007 edition of the magazine, for which he also appeared on the front cover.

After winning the Berrics&#x27; 2UP and In Transition contests during 2014, Song was voted as the most impactful skateboarder of the year in the Berrics&#x27; Populist poll. Song prevailed among a list of nominees that included Guy Mariano and Ben Raybourn, and received his trophy on January 27, 2015.

In 2017, Daewon was inducted into the Skateboarding Hall of Fame.

==Influence==
Song was identified by &quot;Transworld Skateboarding&quot; as the twenty-ninth most influential skateboarder of all time in a list that was published on the magazine&#x27;s digital platform in December 2011. As part of the &quot;Transworld&quot; series, Stevie Williams, founder and owner of DGK (Dirty Ghetto Kids), identifies Song, together with Mullen, as one of his top five most influential skateboarders, while the same occurred during Tom Penny&#x27;s interview for the same &quot;Most Influential&quot; series—Penny, identified as the twenty-first most influential, especially commended Song on his manual combinations. Skateboard photographer Giovanni Reda stated in an Instagram post in January 2013: &quot;Daewon Song will forever be the greatest of all time in my eyes!&quot; Paul Rodriguez identified Song in a &quot;top ten&quot; list of favorite professional skateboarders in July 2013:
Daewon to me has the best board control I have ever seen anyone have. The things he can [do] with his skateboard.. technical abilities , the balance he has while going a million miles a hour is incredible. I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it. He still kills it, he&#x27;s still ripping and he&#x27;s been doing it also for 20 plus years at the highest level. He is consistently getting better, constantly pushing and reaching for [the] peak [of] his ability ... My favorite video part of his would be &quot;Rodney vs. Daewon Round One&quot;... When that video was out and Round 2 I remember watching those video parts countlessly. I may have seen those parts a million times, literally.

Long-time friend and professional skateboarder Daniel Castillo explained his relationship to Daewon in relation to skateboarding in an August 2013 interview:
He has the same enthusiasm as he did when we were like 14-15. And he&#x27;s still learning new tricks, which is insane because the dude has enough tricks. He&#x27;s insane &amp; is always amped to skate. It could honestly be anything. He&#x27;d be amped to skate a little curb on the street. That&#x27;s why I love skating with him because when I&#x27;m skating with him, it feels like I&#x27;m that age again. Like I&#x27;m 14. Anytime I hang out or skate with him, I have no care in the world except skating.

In a 2005 &quot;Skateboarder&quot; interview, Song listed Rodney Mullen, Natas Kaupas, Christian Hosoi, Chris Haslam, and Eric Dressen as his top five &quot;timeless influences.&quot; In the same interview, Song listed his top five &quot;Most underrated skaters&quot; as Alan Peterson, Chany Jeanguenin, Cooper Wilt, Dan Drehobl, all pool skaters. After being named the twenty-ninth most influential skateboarder of all time by &quot;Transworld Skateboarding&quot;, Song listed his own top five all-time skateboarding influences: &quot;Rodney Mullen. Christian Hosoi, just the way he flew—who else could make lycra shorts cool? Tommy Guerrero, Steve Caballero, and Natas Kaupas. Once he spun on that fire hydrant everyone was mesmerized, like going to their first magic show.&quot; Song also revealed that he was interested in the Z-Boys when he was a young skateboarder.

==Perspectives==
In an interview with &quot;Juice&quot; magazine, Song explained his passion for skateboarding:
I like skateboarding for what it is. I like being able to do it by myself. You need another person to hit the ball. You need someone to pitch something at you or block for you to make a basket. With skateboarding, I just pick up my board and do exactly what I want to do. Some days I have a good day and some days I feel like a complete dip-shit; like I&#x27;ve never been skateboarding in my life. I love the experience of it. I love the fact that on one day I can do everything I&#x27;ve ever learned and the next day I feel like I&#x27;ve lost everything. That&#x27;s skateboarding. It&#x27;s amazing. I like the challenges. Skateboarding is one of the most challenging things.

Song has been vocal about the importance of fun in regard to skateboarding and the importance of individuality, in contrast to elitism and dogmatism in the sub-culture. In his appearance on Vice&#x27;s &quot;Epicly Later&#x27;d&quot; program, Song inadvertently meets a fan at a public skate location that appeared in his video part for &quot;Love Child&quot; and shares an opinion with the teenage male: &quot;Just keep skating. Don&#x27;t even worry about ... don&#x27;t ever sweat, like, &#x27;is this good enough? Is that good enough?&#x27; Like, as long as you&#x27;re happy with it, that&#x27;s fine.&quot; Song expanded upon this sentiment in a voiceover segment for &quot;Thrasher&quot; magazine, in relation to Haslam&#x27;s footage in &quot;Cheese and Crackers&quot;, stating:
Do whatever you want—go skate a mini-ramp; go skate a really mini-ramp; go skate a big ramp. Basically, just go skate; set up whatever you want and don&#x27;t worry about what people say, like, &#x27;Ah, that was stupid&#x27;, or, &#x27;That was ugly&#x27;, or &#x27;That&#x27;s not cool&#x27;—it&#x27;s, you know, who cares what&#x27;s cool? You&#x27;re the one who gets to do it. They&#x27;re just–some people are just jealous &#x27;cause they&#x27;re not the ones who can do it, so, even if it is something that they consider, &#x27;Oh, that&#x27;s ugly&#x27;, once they–if they can do it and they think it&#x27;s ugly, then, you know, that&#x27;s their opinion and that&#x27;s cool, you know. But when people that don&#x27;t even skate at all and they wanna sit there and go, &#x27;That was lame&#x27;, that&#x27;s just, you know, that just sucks.

Song listed the following video parts as his all-time favorites in a 2011 interview with online magazine, &quot;Caught in the Crossfire&quot;: John Cardiel: &quot;Sight Unseen&quot;, Sean Sheffey: &quot;Life&quot;, and PJ Ladd: &quot;PJ Ladd&#x27;s Wonderful, Horrible Life&quot;.

Song resides in San Pedro, Los Angeles, California, US.

===Fatherhood===
In 2005, Song provided the public with an insight into his role as a father:
It&#x27;s crazy. He [son&#x27;s name] brings a different perspective on the world. Having a kid is a lot of work, though. Holy shit! I&#x27;d be filming all day and get home sometimes at 12 or 1 in the morning, and he&#x27;d just get up—boom!—and wouldn&#x27;t go to bed until 6 in the morning. This was seriously like every other day. I was just exhausted.

In a Twitter post and Pheed photo upload on January 1, 2013, Song featured an image of his son with a pet dog and the following blurb: &quot;2013!!! it&#x27;s amazing every time I get 2 see my son he teaches me something new, it&#x27;s the small things i love about being a dad and am blessed to have such a great son !!&quot;

<doc id="1278449" wikidata="Q554307" url="?curid=1278449" title="Joel-Peter Witkin">
<text>Joel-Peter Witkin (born September 13, 1939) is an American photographer who lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico. His work often deals with themes such as death, corpses (and sometimes dismembered portions thereof), often featuring ornately decorated photographic models, including people with dwarfism, transgender and intersex persons, as well as people living with a range of physical features. Witkin is often praised for presenting these figures in poses which celebrate and honor their physiques in an elevated, artistic manner. Witkin&#x27;s complex &quot;tableaux vivants&quot; often recall religious episodes or classical paintings.
==Biography==
Witkin was born to a Jewish father and Roman Catholic mother. His twin brother, Jerome Witkin, and son Kersen Witkin, are also painters. Witkin&#x27;s parents divorced when he was young because they were unable to overcome their religious differences. He attended grammar school at Saint Cecelia&#x27;s in Brooklyn and went on to Grover Cleveland High School. 

In 1961 Witkin enlisted in the United States Army, with the intention of capturing war photography during the Vietnam War. However due to scheduling conflicts, Witkin never saw combat in Vietnam. Witkin spent his military service at Fort Hood, Texas, and was mostly in charge of Public Information and classified photos. 

In 1967, he became the official photographer for City Walls Inc. He attended Cooper Union in New York, where he studied sculpture, attaining a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1974. Columbia University granted him a scholarship for graduate school, but his Master of Fine Arts degree is from the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque.

== Influences and themes ==
Witkin claims that his vision and sensibility spring from an episode he witnessed as a young child, an automobile accident in front of his house in which a little girl was decapitated.

He says his family&#x27;s difficulties also influenced his work. His favorite artist is Giotto. His photographic techniques draw on early Daguerreotypes and on the work of E. J. Bellocq.
Those of Witkin&#x27;s works which use corpses have had to be created in Mexico to get around restrictive US laws. Because of the transgressive nature of the contents of his images, his works have been labelled and have sometimes shocked public opinion.
His techniques include scratching the negative, bleaching or toning the print, and using a hands-in-the-chemicals printing technique. This experimentation began after seeing a 19th-century ambrotype of a woman and her ex-lover who had been scratched from the frame.
Joel-Peter Witkin&#x27;s photograph &quot;Sanitarium&quot; inspired the final presentation of Alexander McQueen’s Spring/Summer 2001 collection based on avian imagery, the walls of another box within the faux psychiatric ward collapsed to reveal a startling &quot;tableau vivant&quot;: a reclining, masked nude breathing through a tube and surrounded by fluttering moths.

== Documentary films ==
In 2011, filming began on the feature-length documentary, &quot;Joel-Peter Witkin: An Objective Eye&quot;. The film, directed by Thomas Marino, examines Witkin&#x27;s life and photographs. Along with interviews with Witkin, the film includes interviews from gallery owners, artists, photographers, and scholars who share insight into the impact of Witkin&#x27;s work and influence on modern culture. The film was released in 2013. It will be part of the permanent collections at the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris, and the Biblioteca Nacional de Chile in Santiago, Chile.

&quot;Joel-Peter Witkin: An Objective Eye&quot; was first publicly shown in Santiago, Chile at the Biblioteca Nacional de Chile in 2013, as part of the opening of the exhibition, &quot;Vanitas: Joel-Peter Witkin en Chile&quot;.

In 2017, a documentary about him and his brother, Jerome Witkin, was made by Trisha Ziff, entitled &quot;Witkin and Witkin&quot;.

<doc id="1278452" wikidata="Q7721973" url="?curid=1278452" title="The Certificate">
<text>The Certificate is a novel by Isaac Bashevis Singer, published in English in 1992 (published in Yiddish in 1967). David Bendinger, a poor, young Yiddish writer wishes to emigrate to Palestine from Poland, and because married couples are given preference, he tries to arrange for a marriage certificate to be purchased for him by a wealthy woman whose fiancee lives in Palestine. The narrative deals with the abject poverty of David, as well as his Jewish heritage, and details the rise of both Communism and Zionism.

==Reception==
Kirkus Reviews gave a positive review, describing the book as being made with &quot;gusto and panache&quot; and called it &quot;a triumph&quot;. Publishers Weekly likewise gave a positive review, describing the book as &quot;welcome addition to [Singer]&#x27;s oeuvre&quot;. Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, writing for the New York Times, gave a mixed review, writing &quot;In the end you follow David Bendinger&#x27;s adventures only halfway engaged...a certain detachment in Singer&#x27;s prose always keeps you at arm&#x27;s length.&quot;

<doc id="1278456" wikidata="Q750222" url="?curid=1278456" title="Marghita">
<text>Marghita (; ; ; &quot;Margaretin&quot;) is a city in Bihor County, Romania. It administers two villages, Cheț (&quot;Magyarkéc&quot;) and Ghenetea (&quot;Genyéte&quot;).

==Geography==
Marghita is located in the northern part of the county, north-east of the county seat, Oradea. It lies on the banks of the river Barcău, extending to the border with Satu Mare County; the river Inot discharges into the Barcău in Marghita.

The city borders the following communes: Viișoara and Abram to the east, Tăuteu to the south, Petreu and Buduslău to the west, and Sălacea and Pir to the north.

==History==
The name appears to be derived from the name &quot;Margit&quot; which is the Hungarian form of (Margaret), Saint Margaret the patron of a local church. The first time it was used in a document was in 1216. In the 14th century, it became a feudal holding of the Hungarian landlord.

In 1376 King Louis I of Hungary gave Marghita the right of organizing a fair and it developed in the next centuries as a market town. There were several peasant revolts against the feudal system affecting Marghita in 1467 and 1514. At the beginning of the 16th century, it became along with parts of Bihor County and Hungary an Ottoman province until towards the end of the 17th century.

In 1823, a great fire destroyed half of the buildings of Marghita. After the 1848 revolution, the local peasants were no longer serfs and manufacturing and industry began to develop.

In the aftermath of World War I and the ensuing Hungarian–Romanian War, the Romanian Army entered the town, and after Treaty of Trianon of 1920, Marghita became part of the Kingdom of Romania. During the interwar period, it became the seat of plasa Marghita, in Bihor County. In the wake of the Second Vienna Award of August 30, 1940, the territory of Northern Transylvania (of which the town of Marghita was part) reverted to the Kingdom of Hungary. In 1944, after German occupation, about 2,100 Jews of Marghita were sent to death, concentration, and labor camps as part of the Holocaust, of which only about 450 survived. Towards the end of World War II, the town was taken back from Hungarian and German troops by Romanian and Soviet forces in October 1944, during the initial stages of the Battle of Debrecen.

After 1947, with the Soviets imposing a Communist government in Romania, factories and land were nationalized. Over the course of the next few years, Marghita took part in the Romanian industrialization process. Following the administrative reform of 1950, the town became the seat of Marghita Raion within Bihor Region (renamed Oradea Region in 1952 and Crișana Region in 1960). In 1967, Marghita was declared a city. In 1968, the old territorial division into &quot;județe&quot; was reinstituted, and Marghita reverted to being part of Bihor County. In 2003, it was declared a &quot;municipiu&quot;.

==Politics==
The Marghita Municipal Council, elected in the 2012 local government elections, is made up of 17 councillors, with the following party composition:

==Population==

At the 2011 census, the city 15,134 inhabitants, of which 51.7% were Romanians, 44.1% Hungarians, 3.5% Roma, and 0.5% Slovaks. At the 2021 census, Marghita had a population of 13,573; of those, 50.5% were Romanians, 34.82% Hungarians, and 4.2% Roma.

<text>Kheda is a city and a municipality in the Indian state of Gujarat. Kheda was known as Kaira during the British Raj. It was the former administrative capital of Kheda district. The city is known for tobacco farming. The nearest railway station is and the nearest airport is Ahmedabad Airport.

== History ==
The name Kheda originated from the Sanskrit term &quot;Kshetra&quot; (). Khetaka is used as a name of a region surrounding the place in ancient literature. It is also mentioned as a town from 12th to 17th century. &quot;Ganapatha&quot; (dated 2nd century BCE), one of the five volumes of Pāṇini&#x27; s grammar mentions Khetaka as a name of the region. It is also mentioned as Divyanagar in 133rd chapter of &quot;Padmapurana&quot;. The 7th and 8th century copper-plates of Maitraka dynasty mentions Khetaka as an administrative division as well as there are mentions of it as a place of Brahmin residence and a Rashtrakuta-controlled town in other copper-plates. There were about 750 villages under that administrative division. It is also mentioned in Nimbavati story of &quot;Dashakumaracharita&quot;, &quot;Ācārāṅga Sūtra&quot;, Merutunga&#x27;s &quot;Prabandhachintamani&quot; (1305 CE), &quot;Puratana-prabandha-sangraha&quot; (before 15th century, multiple authors) and Jinaprabha&#x27;s &quot;Vividh-tirtha-kalpa&quot; (c. 1332 CE).

It was under Chaulukya and Vaghela dynasties from 10th to the start of the 14th century. It was brought under Gujarat Sultanate then. The town of Kheda passed to the Babi Dynasty (of Pashtun descent) early in the eighteenth century, with whom it remained until 1763, when it was taken by the Marathas under Damajirao Gaekwad. Mahmad Khan Babi built its fort. The Marathas under Anandrao Gaekwad ceded the district to the British in 1803, and it became part of the Bombay Presidency of British India. Nevertheless, Kaira was still entitled, at least in 1901, to a tribute of 488 Rupees from the Koli petty princely state of Ghorasar. Kheda was a large military station until 1830, when the cantonment was removed to Deesa. Brahmin established many villages in the Kheda District area, as did Jats and other groups.

Kheda is also where Mahatma Gandhi launched, starting March 1919, the Satyagraha struggle against oppressive taxation by the British during a time of famine.

The Babi family which ruled Kheda shifted to Khambat and now most of that family lives in Ahmedabad. The last head of the Kheda family, Sahibzada Ahmed Siddique Hussain khanji Dilawar khanji Babi, was married to Bima Rahim sultana bakhte babi sahiba of Junagarh State, and issued a daughter named Bima Nasreen sultana bakhte Babi, who is married to Sahibzada Anis Muhammad khanji babi of Devgam A house of Junagadh state.

== Koli Rebellion Of Kheda ==
The Koli Rebellion Of Kheda was raised by Koli Patels and koli Thakors against East India Company in 1803. The EIC claimed the kheda and surrounding villages and made his rules for peoples. But kolis refused to obey their rules. Koli chiefs (Thakors and Patels) declared the end of Company rule. First koli chiefs filed petitions in Court of Law in Kheda stating that Company government have no authority over kolis but koli chiefs were ignored. The koli chiefs started raiding and plundering the British territories. In 1808, koli chieftains started raids in cities and villages, stealing the crops, animals and other possessions. The town of Dholka Taluka was main target of kolis. The armed kolis numbering one hundred and fifty attacks at dholka and respectfully returned into their villages.

<text>Vijñānabhikṣu (also spelled &quot;Vijnanabhikshu&quot;) was a Hindu philosopher from Bihar, variously dated to the 15th or 16th century, known for his commentary on various schools of Hindu philosophy, particularly the Yoga text of Patanjali. His scholarship stated that there is a unity between Vedānta, Yoga, and Samkhya philosophies, and he is considered a significant influence on Neo-Vedanta movement of the modern era.

==Philosophy==
Vijnanabhiksu wrote commentaries in the 15th century on three different schools of Indian philosophy: Vedānta, Sāṃkhya, and Yoga. He integrated them into a nondualism platform that belongs to both the Bhedabheda and Advaita (nondualism) sub-schools of Vedanta. According to Andrew Nicholson, this became the basis of Neo-Vedanta. His integration is known as &quot;Avibhaga Advaita&quot; (&quot;indistinguishable non-dualism&quot;). His sub-commentary on the Yoga Sutras, the &quot;Yogavarttika,&quot; has been an influential work.

According to Andrew Fort, Vijnanabhiksu&#x27;s commentary is Yogic Advaita, since his commentary is suffused with Advaita-influenced Samkhya-Yoga. Vijnanabhiksu discusses, adds Fort, a spiritually liberated person as a yogic jivanmukta&quot;.

Vijnanabhiksu was a staunch critic of Shankara&#x27;s strict non-dualism, which he viewed as crypto-Buddhist. He reinterpreted the Brahma Sutras to reflect Samkhya&#x27;s metaphysical dualism of &quot;prakrti&quot; and &quot;purusha&quot;. He taught that Brahman, characterized by pure consciousness, is the Inner Ruler (&quot;antaryamin&quot;) of both &quot;prakrti&quot; and &quot;purusha&quot;. He explained the universe&#x27;s creation through &quot;maya&quot; as an evolute of the eternally real &quot;prakrti&quot;, asserting that the world is not illusory.

Vijnanabhiksu&#x27;s commentary&quot;, Sāṁkhyapravacanabhāṣya&quot;, on the Samkhya Sutras challenges the traditional interpretation of the Samkhya Sutras by arguing that, contrary to appearances, Kapila actually believed in the existence of God.

==Influence==
Nicholson mentions Vijnanabhiksu as a prime influence on 19th century Indology and the formation of Neo-Vedanta. According to Nicholson, already between the twelfth and the sixteenth century,
The tendency of &quot;a blurring of philosophical distinctions&quot; has also been noted by Mikel Burley. Lorenzen locates the origins of a distinct Hindu identity in the interaction between Muslims and Hindus, and a process of &quot;mutual self-definition with a contrasting Muslim other&quot;, which started well before 1800. Both the Indian and the European thinkers who developed the term &quot;Hinduism&quot; in the 19th century were influenced by these philosophers.

==Works==
Little good work has been written in English on Vijñānabhikṣu, and most of the texts in his large corpus have yet to be edited and published in Sanskrit, let alone translated into English.

===Major works===
Some major texts attributed to Vijnanabhiksu include:
* &quot;Vijnanamritabhashya&quot; (&quot;The Nectar of Knowledge Commentary&quot;, commentary on Badarayana&#x27;s Brahma Sutras)
* &quot;Ishvaragitabhashya&quot; (&quot;Commentary on the Ishvara Gita&quot;)
* &quot;Sankhyasara&quot; (&quot;Quintessence of the Sankhya&quot;)
* &quot;Sankhyasutrabhashya&quot; (&quot;Commentary on the Sankhya Sutras&quot; of Kapila)
* &quot;Yogasarasamgraha&quot; (&quot;Compendium on the Quintessence of Yoga&quot;)
* &quot;Yogabhashyavarttika&quot; (&quot;Explanation of the &quot;Commentary on the Yoga Sutras&quot;&quot; of Vyasa)

<text>The Brześć Kujawski Voivodeship (, ) was a unit of administrative division and local government in the Kingdom of Poland (later Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth), from the 14th century to the Second Partition of Poland in 1793. It was part of the historic Kuyavia region and the Greater Poland Province. Originally, its name was Brzesc Voivodeship (&quot;Województwo brzeskie&quot;), but after the 1569 Union of Lublin, it was renamed into Brześć Kujawski Voivodeship, to distinguish it from Lithuanian Brest Litovsk Voivodeship (Polish: &quot;Województwo brzesko-litewskie&quot;).

==Geography==
Its area was 3,276 sq. kilometers, divided into five counties. The seat of the voivode was at Brześć Kujawski, while local sejmiks for both Brześć Kujawski and Inowrocław Voivodeships took place at Radziejów. It was one of the smallest and most densely populated voivodeships of the Commonwealth.

Zygmunt Gloger in his monumental book Historical Geography of the Lands of Old Poland provides this description of Brześć Kujawski Voivodeship: “East of the land of the Polans lies the region of Kujawy, most of which stretches along left bank of the Vistula. The region was divided into two voivodeships: those of Brześć Kujawski, and Inowrocław. Third part of historic Kujawy, the Dobrzyn Land, lies on the right bank of the Vistula. Duke Boleslaw Krzywousty, while writing his testament in 1138, united Kujawy and Mazovia, giving it to his son Boleslaw IV the Curly (...) The dynasty of Mazovian Piasts lasted until the 16th century, while the Kujawian Piasts died out in the 14th century. As a result, Kujawy returned to the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland in 1434, two hundred years before Mazovia. It is not known when the province was divided into two voivodeships, but in Horodlo in 1413 (see Union of Horodlo), two Kujawian voivodes were already present: Maciej of Labiszyn was the voivode of Brześć, and Janusz of Koscieliska was the voivode of Gniewkowo, later Inowrocław (...)

The area of Brześć Kujawski Voivodeship was almost 60 sq. miles, with 67 Roman-Catholic parishes, 13 towns and 567 villages. It was divided into five counties: Brześć Kujawski, Radziejow, Przedecz, Kowal and Kruszwica. All counties were among the smallest in the Province of Greater Poland, as Przedecz County had the area of 9 sq. miles, while Kruszwica County was even smaller, with 6 sq. miles. At the same time, however, Brześć Kujawski Voivodeship (together with Łęczyca Voivodeship) was most densely populated of all voivodeships of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Its population density in the 16th century reached 1,200, even 1,300 people per sq. mile (...)

Brześć Kujawski Voivodeship had six senators. These were: The Bishop of Kujawy, the Voivode and the Castellan of Brześć Kujawski, as well as Castellans of Kruszwica, Kowal and Konary. Starostas resided in capitals of the five counties, plus at Nieszawa and Dunikow. Since both Brześć Kujawski and Inowrocław voivodeships were part of Kujawy, local sejmiks for them took place at Radziejow. Here, four deputies to the Sejm were elected, and two deputies to the Greater Poland Tribunal. Both voivodeships shared one coat of arms”.

<doc id="1278471" wikidata="Q602300" url="?curid=1278471" title="War flag">
<text>A war ensign, also known as a military flag, battle flag, or standard, is a variant of a national flag for use by a country&#x27;s military forces when on land. The nautical equivalent is a naval ensign. Under the strictest sense of the term, few countries today currently have distinct war flags, most using a flag design that is also the state flag or general national flag for this purpose.
==History==
Field signs were used in early warfare at least since the Bronze Age. 
The word &quot;standard&quot; itself is from an Old Frankish term for a field sign (not necessarily a flag).

The use of flags as field signs apparently emerges in Asia, during the Iron Age, possibly in either China or India. in Achaemenid Persia, each army division had its own standard, and &quot;all officers had banners over their tents&quot;. Early field signs that include, but are not limited to a flag, are also called vexilloid or &quot;flag-like&quot;, for example the Roman Eagle standard or the dragon standard of the Sarmatians. The Roman Vexillum itself is also &quot;flag-like&quot; in the sense that it was suspended from a horizontal crossbar as opposed to a simple flagpole.

Use of simple flags as military ensigns becomes common during the medieval period, developing in parallel with heraldry as a complement to the heraldic device shown on shields. The maritime flag also develops in the medieval period. The medieval Japanese Sashimono carried by foot-soldiers are a parallel development.

Some medieval free cities or communes did not have coats of arms, and used war flags that were not derived from a coat of arms. Thus, the city of Lucerne used a blue-white flag as a field sign from the mid 13th century, without deriving it from a heraldic shield design.

<text>Guitar Organ or GuitOrgan is a type of electric guitar with electronic organ components added, developed by Jennings Musical Industry (Dartford, Kent, UK) as Vox &quot;Guitar Organ&quot; at latest in 1965. Similar instrument, &quot;GuitOrgan&quot; was developed by Murrell Electronics (Waco, Texas), circa 1967. On this type of instruments, each guitar fret is separated into six segments, creating independent contact switches for each string. The organ notes are keyed when a string touches a specific segment. An expression pedal is used to fade the organ sound in and out, while the guitar can be played at the same time.

==History==
=== (circa 1965)===

According to the book &quot;Classic Keys&quot; (2019), Vox Guitar Organ was developed at latest in 1965 and released in 1966 by the Jennings Musical Industries Ltd (JMI) in the UK. It was roughly based on their Continental organ voice boards. In 1965, its sample was given to The Beatles, and Thomas Walter Jennings, a founder of JMI/Vox, said &quot;We hope that with in a few months, they&#x27;re going to be spreading it all over the world&quot; in a television interview. John Lennon liked it enough to keep it, but it was never used on the Beatles recording session.

=== (circa 1967)===
According to the Billboard magazine, similar instrument named GuitOrgan seems introduced circa August 1967 by Murrell Electronics in Waco, Texas. The invention of the GuitOrgan is credited to Bob Murrell and Musiconics International (MCI) of Waco, Texas. Murrell worked on converting existing products from the late 1960s. In 1968, he had a significant run of instruments based on semi-hollow body guitars from Japan. The B-300 and M-340 are among the most common examples from this run. The M-300 model was introduced at the 1970 NAMM Convention.

The B-300 FSG (Frequency Synthesized Guitorgan) models, introduced in the early &#x27;70s along with the B-35, are based on a master oscillator circuit using a 12-note divider integrated circuit which is an improvement to the older 12 oscillator design, the advantage being that tuning the FSG organ circuit only requires adjustment of the master oscillator frequency rather than adjustment of each of the 12 oscillator frequencies on the older models. FSG pedals cannot be used with non-FSG Guitorgans and vice versa, since the two versions run on a different DC voltage. The multi-pin cable that goes between an FSG pedal and an FSG Guitorgan was labeled with RED ends at MCI for a safety reminder. Murrell continued to introduce upgrades to the Guitorgan design that included analog synthesizer interfaces and even MIDI in the mid-1980s.

=== Others ===
In the mid-&#x27;70s, Godwin produced the rare Organ (Guitar) in two versions. The flagship model had 19 switches and 13 knobs, while the lower model had 16 switches and 4 knobs.

==Features==
The Guitorgan converts a standard electric guitar through the addition of electronic organ components. The most critical part of making a Guitorgan is to separate each guitar fret into six segments, creating independent contact switches for each string. The organ notes are keyed when a string touches a specific segment, thus, making the ground connection necessary for the organ circuit to produce output. TTL logic circuitry determines the highest fret segment making contact on each string, and prevents simultaneous organ notes on the same string to activate; only the highest organ note played on a particular string will sound.

The organ section in a Guitorgan is a 6-note polyphonic circuit, which allows full guitar chords to be played. The guitar section always remains playable, but organ notes can be played alone or simultaneously with the guitar. The idea behind being a &quot;Guitorganist&quot; is to use the Guitorgan&#x27;s expression pedal to creatively and accurately bring the organ in and out of the musical foreground while playing the guitar at the same time (and vice versa) as if there are actually two separate musicians playing.

==Uses==
Some of the sounds produced by the Guitorgan can be heard on the album &quot;The Many Moods of Teisco Del Rey&quot; by musician Dan Forte (recording under his alias &quot;Teisco Del Rey&quot;). Bill Dillon is another practitioner of the Guitorgan. He has performed on many Sarah McLachlan albums and appeared with Counting Crows. Woody Jackson&#x27;s guitorgan playing can be heard on Orchestra Superstring&#x27;s self-titled album and many film soundtracks &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Thirteen&quot;, &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Twelve&quot;, &quot;Fun with Dick and Jane&quot; and &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot;.

<doc id="1278478" wikidata="Q282945" url="?curid=1278478" title="Sonic R">
<text>is a 1997 racing game developed by Traveller&#x27;s Tales and Sonic Team and published by Sega for the Sega Saturn. It is the third racing game in the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; series, and the first to feature 3D computer graphics. The player races one of ten &quot;Sonic&quot; characters in various &quot;Sonic&quot;-themed race tracks as they attempt to stop Doctor Robotnik from stealing the Chaos Emeralds and enslaving the world. &quot;Sonic R&quot; features single-player and multiplayer game modes, and while similar to kart racing games such as &quot;Mario Kart&quot;, it places an emphasis on jumping and exploration. By collecting items and completing objectives, players can unlock secret characters.

Development began after the completion of &quot;Sonic 3D Blast&quot; in 1996 and took nine months. It was the second collaboration between Traveller&#x27;s Tales and Sonic Team and was designed to take advantage of the Saturn hardware. Sonic Team designed the race tracks, while Traveller&#x27;s Tales handled implementation and programming using a custom game engine. The soundtrack was composed by Richard Jacques; &quot;Sonic R&quot; tracks, most notably &quot;Super Sonic Racing&quot;, have been reused in subsequent &quot;Sonic&quot; games. Sega released the game for the Saturn in late 1997, for Windows the following year, and for the GameCube and PlayStation 2 as part of &quot;Sonic Gems Collection&quot; in 2005.

&quot;Sonic R&quot; was the only original &quot;Sonic&quot; game released for the Saturn; &quot;Sonic 3D Blast&quot; is a port of the Mega Drive game, and &quot;Sonic Jam&quot; is a compilation of the first four mainline &quot;Sonic&quot; games. Initial reviews for the game were mixed, with retrospective reception being more negative. It was praised for its visuals and level design, but criticised for its poor controls, high difficulty and short length. Meanwhile, Jacques&#x27;s soundtrack polarized audiences, who either found it catchy and well-produced or out of place in a racing game. Fan interest in &quot;Sonic R&quot; inspired Sega to revisit the racing genre with games such as &quot;Sonic Riders&quot; (2006).

==Gameplay==

&quot;Sonic R&quot; is a racing video game with single-player and multiplayer modes. The player selects a character and participates in a footrace on one of five race tracks, competing for the fastest time ahead of the other racers. Four characters are initially available, while the other six are secret characters that become available when the player completes certain in-game objectives. Although the gameplay is considered similar to kart racing games such as the &quot;Mario Kart&quot; series, &quot;Sonic R&quot; places an emphasis on jumping and exploration, as each track has multiple paths and hidden areas. The tracks, although original creations are thematically based on the art style and environments of classic &quot;Sonic&quot; games such as &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Green Hill Zone&quot; and &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot;″s &quot;Chemical Plant Zone&quot;. Players can also race through each track in reverse.

During each race, the player can collect items scattered across the track, bestowing advantages. Rings, a staple &quot;Sonic&quot; series item, are abundant; the player can exchange rings to gain a temporary speed boost or open doors leading to shortcuts or special items. &quot;Item Panels&quot; give a random temporary advantage, such as a speed increase or shields that grant abilities such as being able to run across water or attract nearby rings. Collection of other special items, such as &quot;Sonic Tokens&quot; and the Chaos Emeralds, may lead to the unlocking of secret characters. &quot;Sonic R&quot; allows the player to select the type of weather seen during races. There is also a &quot;Time Attack&quot; mode, where the player races solo to get the fastest time, and a two-player competitive mode, increased to four-players in the Windows port. In addition to the standard time trial mode, there are two others: &quot;Get 5 Balloons&quot;, where five balloons are scattered across the track and must be located, and &quot;Tag 4 Characters&quot;, where the player chases and must catch four others.

===Characters===

&quot;Sonic R&quot; features ten playable racers, each with unique attributes and abilities falling in line with their usual abilities. Sonic the Hedgehog is the fastest and can &quot;double jump&quot; (being able to perform a second jump in mid-air). Tails is able to fly through the air for a short time, and Knuckles the Echidna can glide through the air upon jumping. Amy Rose, the last initially available character, drives a car, allowing her to hover over bodies of water and receive extra speed from driving over boost spaces. Secret characters include Sonic&#x27;s archenemy Dr. Robotnik, who flies in his &quot;Eggmobile&quot; hovercraft and resists differences in terrain; robotic clones of Sonic (Metal Sonic), Tails (Tails Doll), and Knuckles (Metal Knuckles); Robotnik&#x27;s robotic assistant EggRobo; and Super Sonic, a faster version of Sonic powered by the Chaos Emeralds.

Amy&#x27;s car, Dr. Robotnik&#x27;s &quot;Eggmobile&quot; and Eggrobo are the only characters that cannot jump unless they hit a spring pointing up. Instead of the jumping ability, Amy&#x27;s car is equipped with a turbo that reloads after a certain amount of time, and both the &quot;Eggmobile&quot; and Eggrobo can fire homing missiles capable of stunning opponents.

==Story==
Sonic and Tails are about to take a holiday when Tails notices an advertisement for a &quot;World Grand Prix&quot;. While not initially interested, Sonic notices that Dr. Robotnik is also participating in the race, which persuades him to change his mind and enter the race. It is revealed that Robotnik has recently learned of the whereabouts of the rare and powerful Chaos Emeralds, with which he aspires to enslave the world, and that he intends to gather them during the World Grand Prix while using a group of robotic henchmen he has built to best Sonic. Knuckles and Amy overhear of Robotnik&#x27;s plan and decide to compete. Together, the four must balance both winning races and obtaining the Chaos Emeralds to keep them out of Robotnik&#x27;s reach.

==Development==
After the completion of &quot;Sonic 3D Blast&quot; in 1996, Sega approached Traveller&#x27;s Tales about working on a &quot;Sonic&quot; racing game. Traveller&#x27;s Tales, who coincidentally had been working on a 3D graphics engine without a purpose at the time, found this to be a logical progression. Traveller&#x27;s Tales chose to rebuild a Formula One game they were developing into a &quot;Sonic&quot; game. Development started in February 1997 as a joint project between Sega&#x27;s Sonic Team and Traveller&#x27;s Tales. The game was originally known as &quot;Sonic TT&quot; (the TT standing for Tourist Trophy). It was first publicly announced as &quot;Phase Two of Project Sonic&quot; (with &quot;Phase One&quot; being &quot;Sonic Jam&quot;). The schedule was tight, and Traveller&#x27;s Tales requested more freedom than they had with &quot;Sonic 3D Blast&quot;.

Sonic Team designed the race tracks and the game&#x27;s general flow, and Traveller&#x27;s Tales were responsible for the implementation and programming. Each track was inspired by levels from previous &quot;Sonic&quot; games such as Green Hill and Casino Night, and it was due to the tight schedule that there were only five. Secret areas and exploration phases were added to follow the series&#x27; traditions (Sonic Team also wanted a cross between a racing game and a platforming game), and for this reason a map was developed. Sega of Europe producer Kats Sato handled communication with Sonic Team, as he was the only person who could speak both English and Japanese. Discussions led to the reward mechanisms, which Sato believed broadened the game. The courses&#x27; look and feel were inspired by other &quot;Sonic&quot; games, including &quot;Sonic 3D Blast&quot;. The 3D models were based on 2D sketches from Sonic Team. All models and animations were developed using Softimage 3D, while Traveller&#x27;s Tales created their own tools for the remaining game development. Implementing the two-player split-screen mode proved difficult; programmer Jon Burton stated that this was mainly because it was difficult to ensure cheating was not too easy, so shortcuts were made challenging, with a penalty incurred if players got them wrong. A major development goal was to maintain a consistent 30 frames per second frame rate during gameplay. A custom game engine was developed to take full advantage of the Sega Saturn hardware, and a graphical technique, described as &quot;12 layer transparency&quot;, was used to transparentise distant textures to conceal the Sega Saturn&#x27;s limited draw distance. Burton claimed that &quot;Sonic R&quot; could not have been replicated on other consoles during the timeframe, such as the PlayStation console, due to the technique developed specifically for the Sega Saturn hardware. Environment mapping was achieved by writing what Burton described as a software version of the PlayStation&#x27;s hardware rendering, as the Saturn&#x27;s hardware was incapable of it.

An early build was unveiled at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Atlanta, Georgia in June 1997, with Sega releasing screenshots of a &quot;40% complete build&quot; to various magazines shortly afterwards. The builds would be largely the same as the final game, with the exception of minor tweaks, such as the ability to play the &quot;Resort Island&quot; level being in sunset, rather than bright sunshine, a change that was made because of the level&#x27;s music track titled &quot;Can You Feel the Sunshine?&quot;. Traveller&#x27;s Tales had used programming techniques inspired by those (such as a type of fog known as &quot;Pixie Dust&quot;) used on the Nintendo 64.

Hirokazu Yasuhara of Sonic Team went to England and fine-tuned the game due to lack of time for communication. Technical and scheduling issues caused Sato to change the game design, leading to a dispute with producer Yuji Naka, and Sato removed his name from the credits. The game&#x27;s final release would be first in North America on 18 November 1997, with releases in other regions occurring in late 1997 for the Sega Saturn, and into 1998 for the PC version. The PC versions allowed the user to alter graphics details such as allowing to change between software rendering and 3D acceleration or adjusting the game&#x27;s draw distance, affecting how soon objects in the distance are visible. Like many other previous &quot;Sonic&quot; games during this time period, a largely unrelated &quot;Sonic R&quot; game was released as a Tiger Electronics LCD handheld game around the same time in 1998.

===Music===

The soundtrack for &quot;Sonic R&quot; was composed by British composer Richard Jacques of Sega Europe, who had also previously worked on the soundtrack of the Sega Saturn and PC versions of &quot;Sonic 3D Blast&quot;. Work on the soundtrack began in March 1997 when Jacques travelled to Japan to meet with &quot;Sonic&quot; creator Yuji Naka to discuss the musical approach to take for the game. The first song written was &quot;Super Sonic Racing&quot;, which would be used for the game&#x27;s reveal in June at E3. British singer TJ Davis provided the vocals for the song, which Naka liked so much that he requested that she be featured in all the game&#x27;s songs. Jacques wrote all the lyrics for the songs with the intention that they would complement the on-screen action but still be appealing to someone who had never played the game. Tracks were recorded and programmed at Sega Digital Studios, and then worked on for two weeks at Metropolis Studios in London, where a week was spent on vocals, and a week was spent on producing, mixing, and finalising the tracks. Jacques stated that this task was amongst the most difficult in his career because the lyrics needed to &quot;really mean something&quot;. &quot;Sonic R&quot; features two separate mixes of each song in its in-game soundtrack; ones with vocals and instrumental versions, giving the player the option to disable vocals. An official soundtrack CD was released on 21 January 1998.

==Reception==

The Saturn version of &quot;Sonic R&quot; received mixed reviews from critics at the time of its release, although retrospective commentary has been more negative. It received an aggregate score of 69 percent from GameRankings, based on six reviews, and the PC version received 70 per cent based on two.

The game&#x27;s visuals were considered its strongest feature. &quot;AllGame&quot; called the textures vibrant and noted they had &quot;no pop-up or glitching&quot;, and &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; (&quot;EGM&quot;) felt the environmental details were lush. &quot;EGM&quot; and &quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot; highlighted the consistent frame rate (which rarely dropped below 30 frames per second) as a noteworthy achievement, with the latter favourably comparing &quot;Sonic R&quot; to the Saturn version of &quot;Sega Rally Championship&quot;. &quot;Next Generation&quot; hailed the game as &quot;the most visually outstanding Saturn title&quot; for its use of transparency effects and reflective surfaces, a sentiment echoed by &quot;EGM&quot;. &quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot; cited the &quot;Radiant Emerald&quot; level, which is made from transparent polygons, as far superior when compared to &quot;Mario Kart 64&quot;″s &quot;Rainbow Road&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot; stated that the cartoonish style of previous &quot;Sonic&quot; games worked well in 3D. &quot;GameSpot&quot;, &quot;EGM&quot;, and &quot;GamePro&quot; criticised the background&#x27;s graphical &quot;pop-up&quot;, with &quot;GamePro&quot; opining that it ruined the multiplayer mode. However, &quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot; praised the two-player mode for maintaining the same speed and graphical detail as its single-player counterpart. &quot;Game Informer&quot; asserted that &quot;the way they hid the background pop through translucent melting is innovative&quot;, but they panned the poor quality of the character animation. Finally, &quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot; complimented the replay mode&#x27;s more dramatic camera angles.

Critical reaction to the game&#x27;s level design was also positive. &quot;Game Informer&quot; found the tracks imaginative and filled with secrets, while &quot;EGM&quot; found them to be &quot;some of the most well-designed tracks ever&quot;. &quot;AllGame&quot;, &quot;EGM&quot;, and &quot;Game Informer&quot; thought similarly. &quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot; compared the level design to that of the 16-bit &quot;Sonic&quot; games and Sonic Team&#x27;s &quot;Nights into Dreams...&quot;, noting that &quot;far more fun is to be gleamed from the exploration element&quot; than &quot;the temptation ... to leg it through each of the levels in a time trial-like way&quot;. In a similar vein, &quot;Next Generation&quot; described &quot;Sonic R&quot; and Nintendo 64 contemporary &quot;Diddy Kong Racing&quot; as &quot;less of a racing title and more of a driving adventure game&quot;. &quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot; commented on the replay value provided by alternate modes, such as &quot;Get 5 Balloons!&quot;, but conceded that &quot;five tracks don&#x27;t really suffice, even with the reverse mode&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot;, &quot;EGM&quot;, and &quot;Game Informer&quot; also expressed disappointment with the limited selection of levels.

The controls and overall gameplay were criticised, with some questioning their accuracy and depth. &quot;GameSpot&quot; finished every level in first place within one hour using only one of the four initial characters. While the game also features a hard mode, &quot;GameSpot&quot; concluded that &quot;&quot;Sonic R&quot; has more in the personality department than in the depth department&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot; and &quot;Game Informer&quot; cited finding the Chaos Emeralds and hidden coins as difficult, but &quot;GameSpot&quot; argued that such optional tasks offered little in return, because the hidden characters &quot;are mostly robot versions of the already playable ones&quot;. Moreover, &quot;AllGame&quot; believed the controls took time to get used to, but added: &quot;Start sliding around corners and letting off the gas at the right times and you&#x27;ll be finding all of the secrets that &quot;Sonic R&quot; conceals in no time&quot;. Likewise, &quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot; called the controls &quot;initially tricky ... but incredibly playable,&quot; &quot;Next Generation&quot; stated &quot;the proper techniques, with time, can be learned,&quot; and &quot;Game Informer&quot; concluded &quot;once you get used to it, you&#x27;ll find a real solid game&quot;. &quot;Game Informer&quot; thought the game played better with the digital pad as opposed to Sega&#x27;s analogue controller. &quot;GamePro&quot; agreed that the controls were responsive, but to a fault: &quot;At high speeds, it&#x27;s nearly impossible to run in a straight line.&quot;

&quot;Sonic R&quot;&#x27;s soundtrack was particularly divisive. &quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot; described the &quot;storm of controversy [that] surrounds the accompanying music&quot;, which &quot;has come in for a bit of a slagging on the Internet recently for the addition of vocals.&quot; Although he was not a fan of dance music, Nutter stated that the tracks were &quot;better than most chart stuff&quot;, while the included instrumental versions were sufficient &quot;to appease everyone&quot;. &quot;AllGame&quot; offered high praise for the soundtrack, which they called &quot;One of the most inspired ... I&#x27;ve ever heard&quot;, while &quot;GameSpot&quot; believed the songs gave the game &quot;so much more personality&quot;. Conversely, &quot;GamePro&quot; deplored the music as &quot;unbelievably annoying&quot;. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; complimented the music, saying it &quot;fits the Sonic style perfectly&quot;, and is reminiscent of &quot;Sonic CD&quot;″s soundtrack.

The ported version of the game available in &quot;Sonic Gems Collection&quot; was more negatively reviewed. &quot;Eurogamer&quot; called the game &quot;too awkward to play for any length of time&quot;, and &quot;1UP.com&quot; wrote the visuals were grainy—&quot;mak[ing] it hard to tell where you&#x27;re going&quot;—and the controls were frustrating and imprecise. &quot;GameSpot&quot; described &quot;its laughably bad soundtrack&quot; as &quot;[its] only redeeming quality&quot;, and &quot;GameSpy&quot; called &quot;Sonic R&quot; &quot;a concept that works better in theory than in practice&quot;—despite its &quot;fantastic (if not bizarre) soundtrack&quot;. Conversely, &quot;Jeuxvideo.com&quot;, in a negative review of &quot;Sonic Gems Collection&quot;, praised the game, arguing that it was the only decent game in the compilation alongside &quot;Sonic CD&quot;. In a 2003 retrospective, &quot;Game Informer&quot; described the game as &quot;decent, but unmemorable&quot;, while &quot;GamesRadar&quot; included &quot;Sonic R&quot; in a 2014 list of the top 50 Sega Saturn games, calling it &quot;a technical tour de force&quot;. In 2013, &quot;GameTrailers&quot; ranked it as the second worst &quot;Sonic&quot; game, behind 2006&#x27;s &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;. Game designer Hirokazu Yasuhara, who helped Traveller&#x27;s Tales rework the game in response to concerns over the quality of a preview version, has maintained that &quot;the final version of &quot;Sonic R&quot; is actually quite good ... However, I do admit that the base concept of &quot;Sonic R&quot;, in which a player &#x27;drives&#x27; running characters, is not great&quot;.

==Legacy==
Despite Sega releasing two &quot;Sonic&quot; racing games prior to &quot;Sonic R&quot;, &quot;Sonic Drift&quot; and &quot;Sonic Drift 2&quot;, for the Game Gear, developer Takashi Yuda cited fans requesting more racing games in the vein of &quot;Sonic R&quot; would be Sega&#x27;s actual inspiration for revisiting the genre in future years. This led to the development and release of the hoverboarding game &quot;Sonic Riders&quot;, although there are no connections between the two games other than both being racing games. Later &quot;Sonic&quot; racing games include &quot;Sonic Riders&quot; sequels &quot;Sonic Riders: Zero Gravity&quot; and &quot;Sonic Free Riders&quot;, and kart games &quot;Sonic &amp; Sega All-Stars Racing&quot;, &quot;Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed&quot; and &quot;Team Sonic Racing.&quot;

Songs from &quot;Sonic R&quot;″s soundtrack were included in later games featuring Sonic in their original forms or as remixes, including &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot;, &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;, &quot;Sonic Generations&quot;, &quot;Sonic &amp; Sega All-Stars Racing&quot; and &quot;Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed&quot;.

The 2019 release &quot;Team Sonic Racing&quot; features several references to &quot;Sonic R&quot;, including remixes of songs from the soundtrack (including &quot;Super Sonic Racing&quot; and &quot;Can You Feel the Sunshine?&quot;) and the use of the distinctive red &quot;R&quot; in the game&#x27;s logo and on the in-game currency.

On 28 September 2024, Jacques and Davis reunited for a live performance at the Hammersmith Apollo in London as part of the Sonic Symphony World Tour. They performing a medley of &quot;Sonic R&quot; songs featuring &quot;Can You Feel the Sunshine?&quot;, &quot;Living in the City&quot; and &quot;Super Sonic Racing&quot;.

<text>Inowrocław Voivodeship () was a unit of administrative division and local government in Poland from the 14th century to the First Partition of Poland in 1772. Together with the neighbouring Brześć Kujawski Voivodeship it was part of the Kuyavia region and the Greater Poland Province.

With size of some 2,900 km2 (together with Dobrzyn Land, its area was 5,877 km2.), it was one of the smallest voivodeships of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. In early years after its creation (14th century), it was called &quot;Gniewkowo Voivodeship&quot; (&quot;Województwo gniewkowskie&quot;), from the town of Gniewkowo, the seat of local Piast princes. Last mention of Gniewkowo Voivodeship was in 1420. Even though the capital of the voivodeship was in Inowrocław, its biggest urban center was Bydgoszcz. Local sejmiks, together with Brzesc Kujawski Voivodeship, took place in Radziejów. The Inowroclaw Voivodeship with Dobrzyn Land had six senators (Voivode and Castellan of Inowrocław, Castellan of Bydgoszcz, and Castellans of Dobrzyń, Rypin and Słońsk Dolny).

Apart from the original two Kuyavian counties of the Voivodeship, it also included the Dobrzyn Land, located on eastern bank of the Vistula which became part of the Kingdom of Poland in 1466. The Dobrzyn Land was divided into three counties (Dobrzyń, Rypin, Lipno), and had its own sejmiks at Lipno.

<text>A limp is a type of asymmetric abnormality of the gait. Limping may be caused by pain, weakness, neuromuscular imbalance, or a skeletal deformity. The most common underlying cause of a painful limp is physical trauma; however, in the absence of trauma, other serious causes, such as septic arthritis or slipped capital femoral epiphysis, may be present. The diagnostic approach involves ruling out potentially serious causes via the use of X-rays, blood tests, and sometimes joint aspiration. Initial treatment involves pain management. A limp is the presenting problem in about 4% of children who visit hospital emergency departments.

==Definition==
A limp is a type of asymmetric abnormality of the gait. When due to pain it is referred to as an antalgic gait, in which the foot is in contact with the ground for a shorter duration than usual; in severe cases there may be a refusal to walk. Hip deformities with associated muscular weakness, on the other hand, may be present with a Trendelenburg gait, with the body shifted over the affected hip.

==Differential diagnosis==
The causes of limping are many and can be either serious or non-serious. It usually results from pain, weakness, neuromuscular imbalance, or a skeletal deformity. In 30% of cases, the underlying cause remains unknown after appropriate investigations. The most common underlying cause of limping in children is minor physical trauma. In those with no history of trauma, 40% are due to transient synovitis and 2% are from Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome. Other important causes are infectious arthritis, osteomyelitis, and slipped capital femoral epiphysis in children.

===Infection===

====Septic arthritis====
Septic arthritis can be difficult to separate from less serious conditions such as transient synovitis. Factors that can help indicate septic arthritis rather than synovitis include a WBC count greater than 12×109/l, fever greater than , ESR greater than 40 mm/h, CRP greater than 2.0 mg/dL, and refusal to walk. People with septic arthritis usually look clinically toxic or sick. Even in the absence of any of these factors, however, septic arthritis may be present. Joint aspiration is required to confirm the diagnosis.

====Other====
Other infections that classically lead to a limp include Lyme disease (a bacterial infection spread by deer ticks) and osteomyelitis (an infection of the bone).

===Mechanical===

====Trauma====
Accidental or deliberate physical trauma may result in either a fracture, muscle bruising, or a contusion. It is the leading cause of a limp. Deliberate abuse is important to consider.

====Slipped capital femoral epiphysis====
Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) is a condition in which the growth plate of the head of the femur slips over the underlying bone. It most commonly presents with hip pain in males during puberty and is associated with obesity. The majority of people affected have a painful limp and in half of cases both hips are affected. Nearly a quarter of people present with only knee pain. Treatment involves non-weight-bearing movement and surgery. If not identified early, osteonecrosis or death of the head of the femur may occur.

====Other====
A non-painful limp may be due to a number of mechanical conditions including hip dysplasia and leg length differences.

===Inflammatory===

====Transient synovitis====
Transient synovitis is a reactive arthritis of the hip of unknown cause. People are usually able to walk and may have a low grade fever. They usually look clinically nontoxic or otherwise healthy. It may only be diagnosed once all other potential serious causes are excluded. With symptomatic care it usually resolves over one week.

====Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis====
Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis presents gradually with early morning stiffness, fatigue, and weight loss.

===Vascular===

====Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome====
Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome is a degenerative disease of the head of the femur which results in bone loss and deformity. It usually presents as a chronic condition.

===Neoplastic===
Cancers including acute lymphocytic leukemia, osteosarcoma, and Ewing’s sarcoma may result in a gradual onset of limping in children. It is often associated with night sweating, easy bruising, weight loss, and pain most prominent at night.

==Diagnostic approach==
The diagnosis of the cause of a limp is often made based on history, physical exam findings, laboratory tests, and radiological examination. If a limp is associated with pain it should be urgently investigated, while non-painful limps can be approached and investigated more gradually. Young children have difficulty determining the location of leg pain, thus in this population, &quot;knee pain equals hip pain&quot;. SCFE can usually be excluded by an x-ray of the hips. An ultrasound or x-ray guided aspiration of the hip joint maybe required to rule out an infectious process within the hip.

==Epidemiology==
A limp at one hospital emergency department was the presenting complaint in 4% of children. It occurs twice as commonly in boys as in girls.

<text>John Keyse Sherwin (175124 September 1790) was an English engraver and history-painter.

==Biography==
Sherwin was born at East Dean in Sussex. His father was a wood-cutter employed in shaping bolts for shipbuilders, and the son followed the same occupation till his seventeenth year, when, having shown an aptitude for art by copying some miniatures, he was adopted by his father&#x27;s landlord, William Mitford. Sherwin was sent to study in London, first under John Astley, and then for three years under Francesco Bartolozzi – for whom he is believed to have executed a large portion of the plate of Clytie, after Annibale Carracci, published as the work of his master.

Sherwin entered as a student of the Royal Academy, and gained a silver medal, and in 1772 a gold medal for his painting of &quot;Coriolanus taking Leave of his Family&quot;. From 1774 till 1780 he was an exhibitor of chalk drawings and of engravings in the Royal Academy. Establishing himself in St James&#x27;s Street as a painter, designer and engraver, he attained popularity and began to mix in fashionable society. His drawing of the &quot;Finding of Moses&quot;, a work of but slight artistic merit, which introduced portraits of the princess royal of England and other leading ladies of the aristocracy, hit the public taste, and, as reproduced by his burin, sold largely.

In 1785 he succeeded William Woollett as engraver to the king, and he also held the appointment of engraver to the Prince of Wales. His professional income rose to about £12,000 a year; but he was constantly in pecuniary difficulties, for he was shiftless, indolent, and without method, open-handed and even prodigal in his benefactions – and prodigal, too, in less reputable directions, for he became a reckless gambler, and habits of intemperance grew upon him. He did however have a notable student, John Thomas Smith who trained with him for three years. Sherwin died in extreme penury on 24 September 1790according to George Steevens, the editor of Shakespeare, at The Hog in the Pound, an obscure alehouse in Swallow Street, or, as stated by his pupil J.T. Smith, in the house of Robert Wilkinson, a printseller in Cornhill.

It is as an engraver that Sherwin is most esteemed; and it may be noted that he was ambidextrous, working indifferently with either hand upon his plates. His drawing is correct, his line excellent and his textures are varied and intelligent in expression. Such of his plates as the &quot;Holy Family&quot; after Nicolas Poussin, &quot;Christ Bearing the Cross&quot; after Murillo, the portrait of the marquis of Buckingham after Thomas Gainsborough and that of Pitt occupy a high place among the productions of the English school of line-engravers. He also worked after Pine, Dance and Kauffman.

<doc id="1278536" wikidata="Q1377886" url="?curid=1278536" title="Ronde Barber">
<text>Jamael Orondé Barber (born April 7, 1975) is an American former professional football cornerback who spent his entire 16-year career with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the National Football League (NFL). Barber grew up in Roanoke, Virginia, and played college football for the Virginia Cavaliers, earning third-team All-American honors twice.

In the 1997 NFL draft, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers selected Barber in the third round as the 66th overall pick. Over the course of his career, Barber was selected to five Pro Bowls, accumulated three first-team All-Pro and two second-team selections. He was selected to the NFL 2000s All-Decade Team. Additionally, he led the NFL in interceptions in 2001, and he is the Buccaneers all-time interceptions leader. Barber is one of the two members of the 40/20 club (40+ interceptions, 20+ quarterback sacks) alongside Charles Woodson, and the only member of the 45/25 club (45+ interceptions, 25+ quarterback sacks). He also holds the record for most consecutive starts by a defensive back. Barber was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame in 2014, and was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2023.

==Early life==
Barber is the son of Geraldine Barber and James Barber. The Barber twin boys were born five weeks premature. Barber was born seven minutes before his identical twin brother Tiki Barber. He was named Jamael Oronde which means &quot;first born son&quot;. Tiki was a running back who played for the New York Giants.

James Barber was a star cornerback at Virginia Tech and later played in the World Football League. His roommate in college was Bruce Arians. Ronde&#x27;s parents separated when Barber was very young. James Barber rarely saw his sons when they were growing up, and failed to provide suitable financial support to them. His mother Geraldine worked two, sometimes three jobs to support her three sons. He and Tiki have an older brother, Tarik Barber.

Barber graduated from Cave Spring High School of Roanoke, Virginia in 1993, and was a standout in football, wrestling, and track. In football, Barber was a three-time All-District selection. In track, Barber won the national title in the 55-meter hurdles as a senior in 1993, with a career-best time of 7.18 seconds. He was timed at 14.05 seconds in the 110-meter hurdles. He also won four Group AAA hurdles titles in indoor and outdoor track.

==College career==
Barber received an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Virginia, where he played for the Virginia Cavaliers football team. He redshirted the 1993 season and played for the Cavaliers from the 1994 to 1996 seasons as a defensive back. He was also a kick returner in 1994 and 1996; in 1994, Barber returned 10 kickoffs for 171 yards, and in 1996, he returned 3 for 36 yards. As a defensive back, Barber made 15 interceptions returned for 112 yards in his career with Virginia: 8 for 56 yards in 1994, 4 for 18 yards in 1995, and 3 for 38 yards in 1996. The Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) recognized Barber as Freshman of the Year after the 1994 season, and Barber earned first-team All-ACC honors in all his three seasons with Virginia. Barber was part of the Virginia teams that won the 1994 Independence Bowl and December 1995 Peach Bowl. After his junior season in 1996, Barber declared for the 1997 NFL draft. Barber graduated from Virginia in 1997 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in commerce with an emphasis in marketing. During Barber&#x27;s time at UVa, he was a member of the IMP Society, one of the university&#x27;s secret societies.

==Professional career==
On January 3, 1997, Barber announced his decision to forgo his final season of eligibility and enter the 1997 NFL draft. He became only the third player from the University of Virginia to enter the NFL draft with eligibility remaining.
===1997===
The Tampa Bay Buccaneers drafted Barber in the third round (66th overall) of the 1997 NFL draft. Barber was the third underclassmen selected in 1997 and was the tenth cornerback. His brother, Tiki Barber, was drafted in the second round (36th overall) by the New York Giants. Ronde and Tiki Barber became only the fourth set of twins to be selected in the same draft in NFL history, following Rich and Ron Saul (1970), Reggie and Raleigh McKenzie (1985), and Keith and Kerry Cash (1991). They also became only the seventh set of twins to play in the league.

As a rookie, Barber played only one game, in Week 5 (September 28) against the Arizona Cardinals. Barber had three tackles. Tampa advanced to the divisional round of the playoffs but lost to the Green Bay Packers.

===1998===
In his second season, Barber started nine games (three as left cornerback and six as right cornerback) and played in all 16 games, recording 68 tackles, 17 passes deflected, 3 sacks, 2 interceptions (returned for 67 yards), 2 forced fumbles, and 12 special teams tackles.

===1999===
In the 1999 season, Barber again played in all 16 games and started 15 as right cornerback. Improving from his previous seasons, Barber posted 74 tackles, two interceptions (60 yards), one sack, and 16 passes deflected. Making his postseason debut this season, Barber also started both playoff games; the Buccaneers lost the NFC Championship game to eventual Super Bowl XXXIV champion St. Louis Rams.

===2000===
For the first time in his career, Barber started all 16 games in a season in 2000. Barber reached new career bests with 97 tackles, 20 passes deflected, and 5.5 sacks. With his 5.5 sacks, Barber led all NFC defensive backs in sacks. He had two interceptions (46 yards), one forced fumble, one fumble recovery, and six special teams tackles. For the Week 2 (September 10) game, Barber was NFC Defensive Player of the Week for 3 tackles, 2.5 sacks, a forced fumble, and a 24-yard fumble recovery for a touchdown against the Chicago Bears. Picking and returning for 37 yards a pass from former Tampa quarterback Vinny Testaverde, Barber scored his first career touchdown from an interception return in the Week 4 (September 24) 21–17 loss to the New York Jets. In the Wild Card game on December 31, a 21–3 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, Barber made 5 tackles.

===2001===
On April 9, 2001, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers signed Barber to a six-year, $18.50 million contract.

In 2001, Barber started 16 of 16 regular season games and made 71 tackles, 1 sack, 14 passes deflected, and 10 interceptions (86 yards). Barber returned an intercepted pass from Aaron Brooks 36 yards for a touchdown in the Week 15 (December 23) win over the New Orleans Saints. Barber made his first Pro Bowl and All-Pro teams this season.

===2002===
Starting all 16 games again this season, Barber made 79 tackles, 3 sacks, 17 passes deflected, and returned 2 interceptions for 9 yards. Barber was part of a Tampa secondary that ranked first in total defense and passes defended. Barber also started all three playoff games, including Tampa&#x27;s Super Bowl XXXVII victory.

In the NFC Championship game on January 19, 2003, Barber picked off a pass from Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb and returned the interception 92 yards for a touchdown late in the fourth quarter to seal Tampa&#x27;s 27–10 road victory and brought Veterans Stadium to near-silence. Bob Ford of &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; labeled this game as &quot;the most ignominious defeat of Andy Reid&#x27;s head coaching career&quot; because of Barber&#x27;s interception return. In 2011, &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot; sportswriter Rick Stroud ranked Barber&#x27;s interception return for touchdown in the NFC Championship game as the greatest scoring play in team history. Barber also deflected 4 passes in that game. In Tampa&#x27;s 48–21 victory over the Oakland Raiders in Super Bowl XXXVII on January 26, 2003, Barber made five tackles.

===2003===
For the fourth consecutive season, Barber started all 16 regular season games. Barber again continued to make more tackles annually with 97 this season. Additionally, Barber deflected 3 passes, returned 2 interceptions for 53 yards, and forced 3 fumbles. In Week 5 (October 6), a 38–35 overtime loss to the Indianapolis Colts, Barber returned an intercepted pass from Peyton Manning 29 yards for a touchdown.

===2004===

<text>Carburizing, or carburising, is a heat treatment process in which iron or steel absorbs carbon while the metal is heated in the presence of a carbon-bearing material, such as charcoal or carbon monoxide. The intent is to make the metal harder and more wear resistant. Depending on the amount of time and temperature, the affected area can vary in carbon content. Longer carburizing times and higher temperatures typically increase the depth of carbon diffusion. When the iron or steel is cooled rapidly by quenching, the higher carbon content on the outer surface becomes hard due to the transformation from austenite to martensite, while the core remains soft and tough as a ferritic and/or pearlite microstructure.

This manufacturing process can be characterized by the following key points: It is applied to low-carbon workpieces; workpieces are in contact with a high-carbon gas, liquid or solid; it produces a hard workpiece surface; workpiece cores largely retain their toughness and ductility; and it produces case hardness depths of up to . In some cases it serves as a remedy for undesired decarburization that happened earlier in a manufacturing process.

== Method ==
Carburization of steel involves a heat treatment of the metallic surface using a source of carbon. Carburization can be used to increase the surface hardness of low carbon steel.

Early carburization used a direct application of charcoal packed around the sample to be treated (initially referred to as case hardening), but modern techniques use carbon-bearing gases or plasmas (such as carbon dioxide or methane). The process depends primarily upon ambient gas composition and furnace temperature, which must be carefully controlled, as the heat may also impact the microstructure of the remainder of the material. For applications where great control over gas composition is desired, carburization may take place under very low pressures in a vacuum chamber.

Plasma carburization is increasingly used to improve the surface characteristics (such as wear, corrosion resistance, hardness, load-bearing capacity, in addition to quality-based variables) of various metals, notably stainless steels. The process is environmentally friendly (in comparison to gaseous or solid carburizing). It also provides an even treatment of components with complex geometry (the plasma can penetrate into holes and tight gaps), making it very flexible in terms of component treatment.

The process of carburization works via the diffusion of carbon atoms into the surface layers of a metal. As metals are made up of atoms bound tightly into a metallic crystalline lattice, the carbon atoms diffuse into the crystal structure of the metal and either remain in solution (dissolved within the metal crystalline matrix — this normally occurs at lower temperatures) or react with elements in the host metal to form carbides (normally at higher temperatures, due to the higher mobility of the host metal&#x27;s atoms). If the carbon remains in solid solution, the steel is then heat treated to harden it. Both of these mechanisms strengthen the surface of the metal, the former by forming pearlite or martensite, and the latter via the formation of carbides. Both of these materials are hard and resist abrasion. 

Gas carburizing is normally carried out at a temperature within the range of 900 to 950 °C.

In oxy-acetylene welding, a carburizing flame is one with little oxygen, which produces a sooty, lower-temperature flame. It is often used to anneal metal, making it more malleable and flexible during the welding process.

A main goal when producing carburized workpieces is to ensure maximum contact between the workpiece surface and the carbon-rich elements. In gas and liquid carburizing, the workpieces are often supported in mesh baskets or suspended by wire. In pack carburizing, the workpiece and carbon are enclosed in a container to ensure that contact is maintained over as much surface area as possible. Pack carburizing containers are usually made of carbon steel coated with aluminum or heat-resisting nickel-chromium alloy and sealed at all openings with fire clay.

Carburizing can be achieved in either a Conventional Furnace (Atmosphere Furnace) or a Low Pressure Carburizing Furnace (LPC).

* Conventional Furnace (Atmosphere Furnace): conventional carburizing is an atmosphere controlled process with control of the carbon potential.
* Low Pressure Carburizing Furnace (LPC): low pressure carburizing is running without any oxygen and with injections of carburizing gas (ex. acetylene).

==Hardening agents== 
There are different types of elements or materials that can be used to perform this process, but these mainly consist of high carbon content material. A few typical hardening agents include carbon monoxide gas (CO), sodium cyanide and barium carbonate, or hardwood charcoal. In gas carburizing, carbon is given off by propane or natural gas. In liquid carburizing, the carbon is derived from a molten salt composed mainly of sodium cyanide (NaCN) and barium chloride (BaCl2). In pack carburizing, carbon monoxide is given off by coke or hardwood charcoal.

==Geometrical possibilities==
There are all sorts of workpieces that can be carburized, which means almost limitless possibilities for the shape of materials that can be carburized. However careful consideration should be given to materials that contain nonuniform or non-symmetric sections. Different cross sections may have different cooling rates which can cause excessive stresses in the material and result in breakage.

==Dimensional changes==
It is virtually impossible to have a workpiece undergo carburization without having some dimensional changes. The amount of these changes varies based on the type of material that is used, the carburizing process that the material undergoes and the original size and shape of the work piece. However changes are small compared to heat-treating operations.

==Workpiece material==
Typically the materials that are carbonized are low-carbon and alloy steels with initial carbon content ranging from 0.2 to 0.3%. The workpiece surface must be free from contaminants, such as oil, oxides, or alkaline solutions, which prevent or impede the diffusion of carbon into the workpiece surface.

==Comparing different methods==
In general, pack carburizing equipment can accommodate larger workpieces than liquid or gas carburizing equipment, but liquid or gas carburizing methods are faster and lend themselves to mechanized material handling. Also the advantages of carburizing over carbonitriding are greater case depth (case depths of greater than 0.3 inch are possible), less distortion, and better impact strength. This makes it perfect for high strength and wear applications (e.g. scissors or swords). The disadvantages include added expense, higher working temperatures, and increased time.

==Choice of equipment==
In general, gas carburizing is used for parts that are large. Liquid carburizing is used for small and medium parts and pack carburizing can be used for large parts and individual processing of small parts in bulk. Vacuum carburizing (low pressure carburizing or LPC) can be applied across a large spectrum of parts when used in conjunction with either oil or high pressure gas quenching (HPGQ), depending on the alloying elements within the base material.

<doc id="1278543" wikidata="Q373022" url="?curid=1278543" title="Henry Cort">
<text>Henry Cort (c. 1740 – 23 May 1800) was an English ironware producer who was formerly a Navy pay agent. During the Industrial Revolution in England, Cort began refining iron from pig iron to wrought iron (or bar iron) using innovative production systems. In 1784, he obtained a patent for an improved version of Peter Onions&#x27;s puddling process, for refining cast iron, although its commercial viability was only realised in the 1790s, through further innovations introduced by Richard Crawshay and Homfray of the Cyfarthfa Ironworks in Merthyr Tydfil.

== Biography ==
Little is known of Cort&#x27;s early life other than that he was possibly born into a family coming originally from Lancaster but living in Jamaica at the time of his (possible) father; another Henry Cort although his parents are not definitely known. Although his date of birth is traditionally given as 1740, this can not be confirmed and his early life remains an enigma. 
By 1765, Cort had become a Royal Navy pay agent, acting on commission collecting half pay and widows&#x27; pensions from an office in Crutched Friars near Aldgate in London. At that time, despite Abraham Darby&#x27;s improvements in the smelting of iron using coke instead of charcoal as blast furnace fuel, the resultant product was still only convertible to bar iron by a laborious process of decarburization in finery forges. As a result, bar iron imported from the Baltic undercut that produced in Britain.

In 1768, Cort&#x27;s second marriage was to Elizabeth Heysham, the daughter of a Romsey solicitor and steward of the Duke of Portland whose estates included Titchfield. Her uncle William Attwick, although a successful London attorney, had inherited the family ironmongery business in Gosport which supplied the navy with mooring chains, anchors and hundreds of different items of ironmongery.

=== Partnership with Samuel Jellicoe ===
In 1780, the Royal Navy&#x27;s Victualling Commissioners reached an agreement with Cort, who had taken over Attwick&#x27;s business, to convert scrap iron hoops for their barrels. He had recently taken over a rolling mill at an existing iron mill in Titchfield which was later used for the production of bar iron. Short of funds, he turned to Adam Jellicoe, at that time chief clerk in the Pay Office of the Royal Navy, who agreed to loan Cort funds to develop a new method of converting cast iron to bar iron, over the next ten years this amounted to the amount of nearly £58 000 on seemingly little security beyond the value of the business. It was the accepted practice for clerks in the Pay Office to temporarily use surplus funds for their own benefit. As part of the arrangement, Jellicoe&#x27;s son Samuel became a partner in the Fontley Works. The deal was later to have unfortunate repercussions for Cort.

=== Rolling mill and puddling furnace ===

Cort developed his ideas at the Fontley Works (as he had renamed Titchfield Hammer) resulting in a 1783 patent for a simple reverberatory furnace to refine pig iron followed by a 1784 patent for his puddling furnace, with grooved rollers which mechanised the formerly laborious process. His work built on the existing ideas of the Cranege brothers and their reverberatory furnace (where heat is applied from above, rather than through the use of forced air from below) and (particularly) Peter Onions&#x27; puddling process where iron is stirred to separate out impurities and extract the higher quality wrought iron.

The puddling furnace lowered the carbon content of the cast iron charge through oxidation while the &quot;puddler&quot; extracted a mass of iron from the furnace using an iron &quot;rabbling bar&quot;. The extracted ball of metal was then processed into a &quot;shingle&quot; by a shingling hammer, after which it was rolled in the rolling mill. The original process of Cort was ineffectual until significant alterations were made by Richard Crawshay and other Merthyr Tydfil ironmasters as Cort used iron from charcoal furnaces rather than the coke smelted pig iron in general production by then.

=== Death of Adam Jellicoe ===
When Adam Jellicoe died suddenly on 30 August 1789, it became apparent that the £58 000 lent to Cort could not be repaid. As a result, the Crown seized all the Property of Adam Jellicoe as well as that of the partnership of Cort and Samuel Jellicoe. Cort was held responsible for Jellicoe&#x27;s debt and declared bankrupt. The Crown later gave back to Samuel Jellicoe possession of the works at Titchfield and Gosport 

=== Patents and royalties ===
The importance of Cort&#x27;s improvements to the process of bar purported iron making were recognised as early as 1786 by Lord Sheffield who regarded them along with James Watt&#x27;s work on the steam engine as more important than the loss of America.
In 1787, Cort came to an agreement with South Wales ironmaster Richard Crawshay whereby all iron manufactured according to the former&#x27;s patents would result in a royalty of 10 shillings per ton.
However, there were a series of production problems and the death of Adam Jellicoe in 1789 precipitated legal actions by the Crown to recover the money lent by Adam Jellicoe to Cort. As a result of which, Cort was declared bankrupt and although he soon rectified his financial status he never again engaged in industrial activities.

== Personal life ==
Cort&#x27;s marriage to Elizabeth Heysham produced 13 children. His business ventures did not bring him wealth, even though vast numbers of the puddling furnaces that he developed were eventually used (reportedly 8,200 by 1820), they used a modified version of his process and thus avoided payment of royalties. He was later awarded a government pension, but died a ruined man, and was buried in the churchyard of St John-at-Hampstead, London.

<text>William Woollett (15 August 173523 May 1785) was an English engraver operating in the 18th century.

==Life==
Woollett was born in Maidstone, of a family which came originally from the Netherlands.

He was apprenticed to John Tinney, an engraver in Fleet Street, London, and studied in the St Martin&#x27;s Lane academy. His first important plate was from &quot;The Destruction of the Children of Niobe&quot; of Richard Wilson, published by Boydell in 1761, which was followed in 1763 by a companion engraving from the &quot;Phaethon&quot; of the same painter. After Benjamin West he engraved his fine plate of the &quot;Battle of La Hogue&quot; (1781), and &quot;The Death of General Wolfe&quot; (1776), which is usually considered Woollett&#x27;s masterpiece. In 1775 he was appointed engraver-in-ordinary to George III; and he was a member of the Incorporated Society of Artists, of which for several years he acted as secretary.

Woollett&#x27;s plates combined engraving, etching, and dry-point; and were considered highly esteemed examples of the English school of engraving. Louis Fagan, in his &quot;Catalogue Raisonné of the Engraved Works of William Woollett&quot; (1885), enumerated 123 plates by Woollett.
Thomas Hearne became apprenticed to him in 1765, Woollett came to consider him the finest landscape engraver of his day; he stayed for six years.

Benjamin Thomas Pouncy (B.T. Pouncy) (died 1799), was a pupil.

He died in London; his is one of the many graves in Old St. Pancras Churchyard. He is not listed on the memorial to important lost graves erected in the 19th century.

==Memorials==
A monument to his memory, by Thomas Banks, stands in Westminster Abbey.

<doc id="1278559" wikidata="Q467405" url="?curid=1278559" title="CE marking">
<text>The presence of the logo (from French, meaning &quot;European conformity&quot;) on commercial products indicates that the manufacturer or importer affirms the goods&#x27; conformity with European health, safety, and environmental protection standards. It is not a quality indicator or a certification mark. The CE marking is required for goods sold in the European Economic Area (EEA); goods sold elsewhere may also carry the mark.

The mark indicates that the product may be traded freely in any part of the European Economic Area, regardless of its country of origin. It consists of the CE logo and, if applicable, the four digit identification number of the notified body involved in the conformity assessment procedure.

==Meaning==
The mark on a product indicates that the manufacturer or importer of that product affirms its compliance with the relevant EU legislation and the product may be sold anywhere in the European Economic Area (EEA). It is a criminal offence to affix a mark to a product that is not compliant or offer it for sale.

For example, most electrical products must comply with the Low Voltage Directive and the EMC Directive, among others; toys must comply with the Toy Safety Directive. (The Low Voltage Directive is about electrical safety; EMC or Electromagnetic Compatibility means the device will work as intended without interfering with, or being affected by, the use or function of any other device.) The mark indicates compliance with as many norms (directives and regulations) as apply at the time of the declaration of compliance (see below). In the case of electrical products, several later norms such as the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS) and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE) are relevant in addition to the Low Voltage Directive and EMC Directive. The exact significance of the mark therefore depends on when it was applied to a specific unit.
The marking does not indicate EEA manufacture or that the EU or another authority has approved a product as safe or conformant. The EU requirements may include safety, health, and environmental protection. If stipulated in any EU product legislation, assessment by a Notified Body or manufacture according to a certified production quality system may be required. Where relevant, the mark is followed by the registration number of the notified body involved in conformity assessment.

Not all products need CE marking to be traded in the EEA; only product categories subject to relevant directives or regulations are required (and allowed) to bear CE marking. Most CE-marked products can be placed on the market subject only to an internal production control by the manufacturer (Module A; see Self-certification, below), with no independent check of the conformity of the product with EU legislation; ANEC has cautioned that, amongst other things, CE marking cannot be considered a &quot;safety mark&quot; for consumers.

==Countries requiring the CE marking==

CE marking is mandatory for certain product groups intended for sale within the European Union, the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), and Turkey. The manufacturers of products made within these countries, and the importers of goods made in other countries, affirm that CE-marked goods conform to EU standards.

Following Brexit in 2020, the UK government proposed to replace the mark with the UKCA marking, with a deadline for replacement of 31 December 2024 in some product categories. For other product categories CE marking acceptance in Great Britain has been indefinitely extended. As Northern Ireland (a region of the UK) remained aligned to the European Single Market under the Northern Ireland Protocol, marking remains mandatory for products placed on the market there, and the UKCA mark is not required. On 1 August, the UK&#x27;s Department for Business and Trade announced that &quot;The government intends to extend recognition of the marking for placing most goods on the market in Great Britain, indefinitely, beyond December 2024&quot;, with &quot;different rules for medical devices, construction products, cableways, transportable pressure equipment, unmanned aircraft systems, rail products, marine equipment and ecodesign&quot;.

, marking was not required by countries of the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA), but CEFTA members Albania, North Macedonia, Serbia, and Montenegro had applied for membership of the European Union, and were adopting many of its standards within their legislation, as had most Central European former member countries of CEFTA that joined the EU, before joining.

==Rules underlying CE marking==
The formal legal status of the mark is set out in various EU Directives and Regulations. The underlying principles are explained in the Commission&#x27;s &quot;Blue Guide&quot;.

Responsibility for CE marking lies with whoever puts the product on the market in the EU, i.e. an EU-based manufacturer, the importer or distributor of a product made outside the EU, or an EU-based office of a non-EU manufacturer.

The manufacturer of a product affixes the CE marking to it but has to take certain obligatory steps before the product can bear CE marking. The manufacturer must carry out a conformity assessment, set up a technical file, and sign a Declaration stipulated by the leading legislation for the product. The documentation has to be made available to authorities on request.

Importers of products have to verify that the manufacturer outside the EU has undertaken the necessary steps and that the documentation is available upon request. Importers should also make sure that contact with the manufacturer can always be established.

Distributors must be able to demonstrate to national authorities that they have acted with due care and they must have affirmation from the manufacturer or importer that the necessary measures have been taken.

If importers or distributors market the products under their own name, they take over the manufacturer&#x27;s responsibilities. In this case they must have sufficient information on the design and production of the product, as they will be assuming the legal responsibility when they affix the CE marking.

There are certain rules underlying the procedure to affix the marking:
* Products subject to certain EU directives or EU regulations providing for CE marking have to be affixed with the CE marking before they can be placed on the market.
* Manufacturers have to check, on their sole responsibility, which EU legislation they need to apply for their products.
* The product may be placed on the market only if it complies with the provisions of all applicable directives and regulations and if the conformity assessment procedure has been carried out accordingly.
* The manufacturer draws up an EU declaration of conformity or a declaration of performance (for Construction Products) and affixes the CE marking on the product.
* If stipulated in the directive(s) or regulation(s), an authorized third party (Notified Body) must be involved in the conformity assessment procedure or in setting up a production quality system.
* If the CE marking is affixed on a product, it can bear additional markings only if they are of different significance, do not overlap with the CE marking and are not confusing and do not impair the legibility and visibility of the CE marking.

Since achieving compliance can be very complex, CE-marking conformity assessment, provided by a notified body, is of great importance throughout the entire CE-marking process, from design verification, and set up of the technical file to the EU declaration of conformity.

A guide to the implementation of directives and regulations based on the New Approach and the Global Approach (the &quot;Blue Guide&quot;) was first published by the European Union in 2000. Updated versions were published on 28 February 2014 and 26 July 2016.

==Self-certification==

Depending on the level of risk of the product, the CE marking is affixed to a product by the manufacturer or authorized representative who needs to ensure that the product meets all the CE marking requirements. In some cases, if a product has minimal risk, it can be self-certified by a manufacturer making a declaration of conformity and affixing the CE marking to their own product. Self-certification exists only for products that have a minimal risk for their use, and this is clearly foreseen in the relevant directive and regulation according to the product &quot;category&quot;. In order to certify, the manufacturer must do several things:

# Investigate whether the product needs to have a CE marking. The product must conform to all Directives and Regulations that apply to the product.
# Choose the conformity assessment procedure from the modules called out by the directive or the regulation for the product according to each category (level of risk) involved. There are several modules available for the Conformity Assessment Procedures, but only a few of them involve self-certification. The most of these procedure require a &quot;type Approval&quot; and a Production conformity assessment by a Notified Body. All procedures (modules) of certification are as listed below which are derivered from Article 5.1.7 of &quot;Blue Guide&quot;. A product normally needs more than one procedure (Module) to be implemented:
:* Module A – Internal production control.
:** Module A1 – Internal production control plus supervised product testing
:** Module A2 – Internal production control plus supervised product checks at random intervals
:* Module B – EU type examination.
:* Module C – Conformity to EU type based on internal production control
:** Module C1 – Conformity to EU type based on internal production control plus supervised product testing
:** Module C2 – Conformity to EU type based on internal production control plus supervised product testing
:* Module D – Conformity to EU type based on quality assurance of the production process.
:** Module D1 – Quality assurance of the production process.
:* Module E – Conformity to EU type based on product quality assurance
:** Module E1 – Quality assurance of final product inspection and testing
:* Module F – Conformity to EU type based on product verification.
:** Module F1 - Conformity based on product verification.
:* Module G – Unit verification.
:* Module H – Full quality assurance.
:** Module H1 – Full quality assurance and Design Examination.

The level of risk is defined by the &quot;category&quot; of each equipment. The higher the category, the higher the risk. After defining the category, the manufacturer, in order to obtain certification, shall then apply the relevant procedures for the specific category of the product or choose the relevant procedures for a higher-category product. The manufacturer, after insuring that the relevant modules for the product category have been applied, will affix the mark and draw up a Declaration of Conformity. The Declaration of Conformity contains a description of the product, the directive(s) and regulation(s) applied, the product category for each directive or regulation, the module chosen, and the name and registration number of the notified body involved in certification procedures (models).

Notified bodies involved in certification procedures are organizations that have been nominated by a member state (according to an accreditation procedure) and have been notified by the European Commission. These notified bodies act as Independent Inspection organizations and carry out the procedures as listed in the relevant Modules applied as stated by the relevant directives and regulations. A manufacturer can choose any notified body (notified for the certain directive or regulation and relevant Modules) in any Member State of the European Union.

In reality, the self-certification process consists of the following stages:

Stage 1: Identify the applicable norm(s)

The first step is to identify whether the product needs to bear CE marking or not. Not all products are required to bear CE marking, only the products that fall within the scope of at least one of the sectoral norms (directives and regulations) requiring CE marking. There are more than 20 sectoral product norms requiring CE marking covering, but not limited to, products such as electrical equipment, machines, medical devices, toys, pressure equipment, PPE, wireless devices and construction products.

Identifying which norm(s) may be applicable, as there may be more than one, involves a simple exercise of reading the scope of each norm to establish which apply to the product (Such as the &quot;Low Voltage Directive,&quot; 2014/35/EU). If the product does not fall within the scope of any of the sectoral norm, then the product does not need to bear CE marking (and, indeed, must not bear CE marking).

Stage 2: Identify the applicable requirements of the norm(s)

Each norm has slightly different methods of demonstrating conformity depending on the classification of the product and its intended use. Every Directive or Regulation has a number of &#x27;essential requirements&#x27; that the product has to meet before being placed on the market.

The best way to demonstrate that these essential requirements have been met is by meeting the requirements of an applicable &#x27;harmonised standard,’ which offer a presumption of conformity to the essential requirements, although the use of standards usually remains voluntary. Harmonised standards can be identified by searching the &#x27;Official Journal&#x27; on the European Commission&#x27;s website, or by visiting the New Approach website established by the European Commission and EFTA with the European Standardisation Organisations.

Stage 3: Identify an appropriate route to conformity

The process is not always a self-declaration process, there are various &#x27;attestation routes&#x27; to conformity depending on the Directive or Regulation and classification of the product. Many products (such as invasive medical devices, or fire alarm and extinguisher systems, Pressure Equipment, Lifts etc.) in most cases, have a mandatory requirement for the involvement of an authorised third party e.g. a &quot;notified body&quot;.

There are various attestation routes which include:

*An assessment of the product by the manufacturer.
*An assessment of the product by the manufacturer, with additional requirement for mandatory factory production control audits to be carried out by a third party.
*An assessment by a third party (e.g. EC type test), with the requirement for mandatory factory production control audits to be carried out by a third party.

Stage 4: Assessment of the product&#x27;s conformity
When all of the requirements have been established, the conformity of the product to the essential requirements of the norm(s) needs to be assessed. This usually involves assessment and/or testing, and may include an evaluation of the conformity of the product to the harmonised standard(s) identified in step 2.

Stage 5: Compile the technical documentation

Technical documentation, usually referred to as the technical file, relating to the product or range of products needs to be compiled. This information should cover every aspect relating to conformity and is likely to include details of the design, development and manufacture of the product.

Technical documentation will usually include:

*Technical description
*Drawings, circuit diagrams and photos
*Bill of materials
*Specification and, where applicable, EU declaration of conformity for the critical components and materials used
*Details of any design calculations
*Test reports and/or assessments
*Instructions
*EU declaration of conformity
*Technical documentation can be made available in any format (i.e. paper or electronic) and must be held for a period of up to 10 years after the manufacture of the last unit, and in most cases reside in the European Economic Area (EEA).

Stage 6: Make a declaration and affix the CE marking

When the manufacturer, importer or authorised representative is satisfied that their product conforms to the applicable norms, an EU declaration of conformity must be completed or, for partly completed machinery under the Machinery Directive, an ECU declaration of incorporation.

==EU declaration of conformity==

The EU declaration of conformity must include: manufacturer&#x27;s details (name and address, etc.); essential characteristics the product complies; any European standards and performance data; if relevant the identification number of the notified body; and a legally binding signature on behalf of the organization.

==Product groups==


The norms (directives and regulations) requiring CE marking affect the following product groups:
* Active implantable medical devices (excludes surgical instruments)
* Appliances burning gaseous fuels
* Cableway installations designed to carry persons
* Construction products according to Regulation (EU) No. 305/2011 under specific rules
* Eco-design of energy related products
* Electrical and electronic equipment, including radio equipment
* Equipment and protective systems intended for use in potentially explosive atmospheres
* Explosives for civil uses
* Fertilizers Regulation (EU) No. 1009/2019
* Hot-water boilers
* In vitro diagnostic medical devices
* Lifts
* Machinery
* Measuring instruments
* Medical devices
* Noise emission in the environment
* Non-automatic weighing instruments
* Personal protective equipment
* Pressure equipment
* Pyrotechnics
* Recreational craft
* Restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (RoHS)
* Toys
* Simple pressure vessels

==Mutual recognition of conformity assessment==
There are numerous &#x27;Agreements on Mutual Recognition of Conformity Assessment&#x27; between the European Union and other countries such as the US, Japan, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Israel. Consequently, CE marking is now found on many products from these countries. Japan has its own marking known as the Conformity Mark.

Switzerland and Turkey (which are not members of the EEA) also require products to bear CE marking as an affirmation of conformity.

==Characteristics of CE marking==

* The CE marking has to be affixed by the manufacturer or its authorized representative in the European Union according to its legal format visibly, legibly and indelibly to the product
* When a manufacturer puts the CE marking on a product it implies that it complies with all the Essential Health and safety requirements from all the directives and regulations that applies to its product.
** For example, for a machine, generally the Machinery directive applies, but often also:
*** Low voltage directive
*** EMC directive
*** sometimes other directives or regulations, e.g. ATEX directive
*** and sometimes other legal requirements, e.g. for food contact materials.

When the manufacturer of a machine puts the CE marking, it engages itself and guarantees, that it makes all the tests, assessments and evaluation on the product to conform to all the requirements of &quot;all&quot; the norms that apply to its product.
* CE marking has been introduced by the COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 93/68/EEC of 22 July 1993 amending Directives 87/404/EEC (simple pressure vessels), 88/378/EEC (safety of toys), 89/106/EEC (construction products), 89/336/EEC (electromagnetic compatibility), 89/392/EEC (machinery), 89/686/EEC (personal protective equipment), 90/384/EEC (non-automatic weighing instruments), 90/385/EEC (active implantable medicinal devices), 90/396/EEC (appliances burning gaseous fuels), 91/263/EEC (telecommunications terminal equipment), 92/42/EEC (new hot-water boilers fired with liquid or gaseous fuels), 93/42/EEC (medical devices) and 73/23/EEC (electrical equipment designed for use within certain voltage limits).
* The size of the CE marking must be at least 5 mm, if enlarged its proportions have to be kept.
* If the appearance and workmanship of a product do not allow for the CE marking to be affixed on the product itself, the marking has to be affixed to its packaging or accompanying documents.
* If a norm requires the involvement of a Notified Body in the conformity assessment procedure, depending on the legislation, an identification number may need to be put behind the CE logo. This is done under the responsibility of the Notified Body.

==Misuse==
The European Commission is aware that CE markings, like other certifications marks, are misused. CE marking is sometimes affixed to products that do not fulfill the legal requirements and conditions, or it is affixed to products for which it is not required. In one case it was reported that &quot;Chinese manufacturers were submitting well-engineered electrical products to obtain conformity testing reports, but then removing non-essential components in production to reduce costs&quot;. A test of 27 electrical chargers with UK sockets in 2008 found that all the eight legitimately branded ones with a reputable name met safety standards, but none of those unbranded or with minor names did, despite bearing the mark; non-compliant devices were actually potentially unreliable and dangerous, presenting electrical and fire hazards.

There are also cases in which the product complies with the applicable requirements, but the form, dimensions, or proportions of the mark itself are not as specified in the legislation.

===&quot;China Export&quot;===
In 2008, a logo very similar to CE marking was alleged to exist and to stand for &quot;China Export&quot; because some Chinese manufacturers apply it to their products. However, the European Commission says that this is a misconception. The matter was raised at the European Parliament in 2008. The Commission responded that it was unaware of the existence of any &quot;Chinese Export&quot; mark and that, in its view, the misunderstanding had arisen because a producer had failed to respect the precise dimensions and proportions of the mark as prescribed in the legislation. The Commission was also aware of fraudulent misuse of the mark on products that did not comply with the standards, but that this is a separate issue. It had initiated the procedure to register CE marking as a Community collective trademark, and was in discussion with Chinese authorities to ensure compliance with EU legislation. Chinese (and other non-EU) manufacturers are permitted to use the mark provided that the goods have been manufactured in accordance with the relevant EU directives and regulations.

Nevertheless, and despite the Commission&#x27;s assurance that it is without foundation, this urban myth continues to propagate on many websites.

In March 2017, another question was put to the European Commission on the statistics of the fraudulent use of the CE mark, reasserting the &quot;China Export&quot; myth. In reply, the Commission notes that it is the responsibility of Member States to take legal action on infringements; the Commission does not have statistics on the penalties that were imposed by Member States for the improper use of the CE marking.

===Domestic plugs and sockets===
Directive 2006/95/EC, the &quot;Low Voltage&quot; Directive, specifically excludes (amongst other things) &quot;plugs and socket outlets for domestic use&quot; which are not covered by any Union norm and therefore must not be CE marked. Throughout the EU, as in other jurisdictions, the control of &quot;plugs and socket outlets for domestic use&quot; is subject to national regulations. Despite this, the illegal use of CE marking can be found on domestic plugs and sockets, particularly so-called &quot;universal sockets&quot;.

It is fairly common to see domestic sockets (and adaptors) that have an inbuilt 5 volt power supply. In the case of these sockets they must be CE marked, but the mark applies to the 5 volt converter &quot;only&quot; and not the rest of the socket or adaptor. This is comparable to dedicated 5 volt power supplies.

===Legal implications===
There are mechanisms in place to ensure that the CE marking is put on products correctly. Controlling products bearing CE marking is the responsibility of public authorities in member states, in cooperation with the European Commission. Citizens may contact national market surveillance authorities if the misuse of the CE marking is suspected or if a product&#x27;s safety is questioned.

In the UK, sale of any product that carries a mark that is not so approved, or outside the scope of approval is a specific offence under Section 1 of the Trade Descriptions Act 1968. The seller of such an article is as equally guilty as the manufacturer or importer. Ignorance as to the true status of the sold item is no defence against a prosecution (strict liability). Under the Act, the misrepresentation is that the sold item conforms to a specification that it does not or that there is no such specification to which it can conform.

The procedures, measures and sanctions applying to counterfeiting of the CE marking vary according to the respective member state&#x27;s national administrative and penal legislation. Depending on the seriousness of the crime, economic operators may be liable to a fine and, in some circumstances, imprisonment. However, if the product is not regarded as an imminent safety risk, the manufacturer may be given an opportunity to ensure that the product is in conformity with the applicable legislation before being forced to take the product off the market.

==Use in computer systems==
, the mark does not have a Unicode code point, nor is one in prospect. According to the Unicode principles, the mark is a computer font design choice for the two ordinary upper-case letters, C and E, with a specific kerning arrangement. The exact geometry that constitutes the mark is provided in the vector graphics data of the Adobe Illustrator Artwork and Encapsulated PostScript files available from the European Commission.

===Motor vehicles===
On motor vehicles and related parts, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe&#x27;s (UNECE) type approval can overrule some EU legislation, so the &quot;emark&quot; or &quot;Emark&quot;, is often seen instead of the CE logo. Unlike the CE logo, the UNECE marks are not self-certified.

===Reversed epsilon ===
A mark called the &#x27;reversed epsilon&#x27; () predates the CE mark but continues to be required on aerosol sprays and measuring container bottles.

<doc id="1278567" wikidata="Q1076411" url="?curid=1278567" title="Fifth Council of Constantinople">
<text>Fifth Council of Constantinople is a name given to a series of seven councils held in the Byzantine capital Constantinople between 1341 and 1368, to deal with a dispute concerning the mystical doctrine of Hesychasm. These are referred to also as the Hesychast councils or the Palamite councils, since they discussed the theology of Gregory Palamas, whom Barlaam of Seminara opposed in the first of the series, and others in the succeeding six councils.

The result of these councils is accepted as having the authority of an ecumenical council by Eastern Orthodox Christians. 

The Council of Crete in 2016 reaffirmed the authority of the Fifth Council of Constantinople, stating: &quot;The Conciliar work continues uninterrupted in history through the later councils of universal authority, such as, for example, the Great Council (879-880) convened at the time of St. Photios the Great, Patriarch of Constantinople, and also the Great Councils convened at the time of St. Gregory Palamas (1341, 1351, 1368), through which the same truth of faith was confirmed.&quot;

==History==
As it became clear that the dispute between Barlaam and Palamas was irreconcilable and would require the judgment of an episcopal council, a series of seven patriarchal councils was held in Constantinople on 10 June 1341, August 1341, 4 November 1344, 1 February 1347, 8 February 1347, 28 May 1351, and April 6, 1368, to consider the issues.

The First Synod was convened on 10 June. It was assembled by Eastern Roman Emperor Andronicos Palaiologos III in the Church of Hagia Sophia. Patriarch John XIV Kalekas was allowed to preside at the council despite initially being an anti-hesychast. The sessions were public and they enjoyed a heavy attendance of about 150 (or more) metropolitans, bishops, priests, laymen and monks from Mount Athos. The synod condemned Barlaam, who recanted. A Synodal Tomos was later issued in July as a brief recapitulation of the council.

Barlaam&#x27;s primary supporter Emperor Andronicus III died just five days after the synod ended. Although Barlaam initially hoped for a second chance to present his case against Palamas, he soon realised the futility of pursuing his cause, and left for Calabria where he converted to the Roman Church and was appointed Bishop of Gerace.

After Barlaam&#x27;s departure, Gregory Akindynos became the chief critic of Palamas. A second council was convened in Constantinople by the regent John Kantakouzenos. The sessions once again took part in the Hagia Sophia cathedral. The council gathered on August 1341, condemned Akindynos and affirmed the findings of the earlier council. This council affirmed the Hagioritic tome of Gregory Palamas. The tome was signed by all the Metropolitans present.

Akindynos and his supporters gained a brief victory at the third synod held in 1344 which excommunicated Palamas and one of his disciples, Isidore Buchiras.

Another Synod was called on February 2, 1347. It condemned Akindynos and deposed John XIV Kalekas from the Patriarchal throne. Isidore Buchiras was chosen as Patriarch. Isidore was allowed to preside in the later sessions. The last few sessions produced a Tomos which was signed by about thirty bishops.

In July 1347 a council led by Matthew, Metropolitan of Ephesus, with some ten bishops, claiming the support of a further twenty bishops outside the capital, issued their own Anti-Palamite Synodal Tomos. Isidore retaliated in August 1347 with a &quot;Tomos against Matthew&quot;. Matthew was reconciled briefly in 1350.

In May 1351, Kantakouzenos convened a patriarchal council at the Palace of Blachernae with the intention of winning over the Anti-Palamites, led by philosopher Nikephoros Gregoras, through debate and systematic examination of patristic texts. Matthew of Ephesus was deposed and the remaining Anti-Palamites were excommunicated. A session was held later in July to offer repentance, with further examination of texts, and finally the emperors, the patriarch, and a large body of metropolitans and officials had willingly signed the Tomos. When the Council ended it had conclusively exonerated Palamas and condemned his opponents.

After the death of Gregory Palamas in 1359, hieromonk Prochoros Kydones began to come into conflict with the monastic brethren of the Great Lavra over Palamas&#x27; teachings. Eventually leading him to protest formally against the commemoration of Palamas at the Lavra as a Saint, with his case coming before the Patriarchal synod in 1368. This Council under Patriarch Philotheos Kokkinos, concluded with the condemnation of Prochoros and the synodal proclamation of Gregory Palamas as a Saint. Ending any further potential challenges to the theology of Palamas. Of possible interest is the heavy Thomistic influence on Prochoros which was also attacked at the council.

Since the Orthodox Church considered that only a council that has been called by the Byzantine Emperor can recognised as an ecumenical council, it was the last such council to be recognised as ecumenical within Eastern Orthodoxy. The results of the council affected the Byzantine Civil War, with the supporters of Palamas siding on behalf of Kantakouzenos and the anti-Palamite Patriarch John XIV Kalekas supporting Empress Anna of Savoy. This in turn significantly weakened Byzantine authority to the advantage of the Bulgarian Empire and the Kingdom of Serbia. Ultimately allowing for the Ottomans to take over the Balkans &amp; Anatolia, with Constantinople falling to the Turks a century after the council.

<text>See No Evil is a 2006 slasher film directed by Gregory Dark, written by Dan Madigan, produced by Joel Simon, and starring professional wrestler Kane (Glenn Jacobs). The first major film produced by WWE Films, the film went through many different working titles before the final title of &quot;See No Evil&quot; was chosen. The original working title of the film was &quot;Eye Scream Man&quot;, but was later changed to &quot;The Goodnight Man&quot;, then &quot;Goodnight&quot; before settling on &quot;See No Evil&quot;.

&quot;See No Evil&quot; was released on May 19, 2006, by Lionsgate. The film was panned by critics and grossed $18.8 million against a budget of $8 million. A sequel, titled &quot;See No Evil 2&quot;, was released on DVD on October 21, 2014.

==Plot==
Officer Frank Williams and his partner Blaine investigate an abandoned house, where they find a young woman with her eyes ripped out. A large figure with an axe then murders Blaine and Frank has his arm chopped off before he is able to shoot the attacker in the head. Afterwards, detectives find seven bodies in the house, all of which have had their eyes ripped out.

Four years later, Frank and his partner Hannah take a group of delinquents - Christine, Kira, Michael, Tyson, Zoe, Melissa, Richie, and Russell to clean up the abandoned Blackwell Hotel in order to turn it into a homeless shelter, as explained by the owner Margaret.

That night, while Michael, Zoe, Russell, and Melissa go upstairs to the penthouse, Tyson and Richie decide to look for the previous owner&#x27;s safe, and find what appears to be the body of a recently deceased man. Richie panics and runs off, only to be dragged into an elevator with a hook by Jacob Goodnight. When Margaret mentions the elevator is being used, Hannah goes to check on the group, but is killed in the elevator. Christine tries to help Kira escape the hotel, but Jacob attacks Kira with his hook and drags her into a dumbwaiter. Christine and Frank go upstairs to find the others, and run into Tyson who tells them what happened to Richie. Frank realizes it must be Jacob and is then pulled into the ceiling by the hook and killed.

Kira is held hostage by Jacob because of her religious tattoos, and is kept captive in a cage where she witnesses Richie having his eyes torn out. Melissa and Russell go off into a room on their own, but are chased by Jacob. Russell tries to lower Melissa out of a window, but he is killed by Jacob. Then, Jacob drops Melissa out the window. She survives her fall, but then she is killed by a pack of stray dogs. Jacob then attacks Michael and Zoe. Zoe nearly escapes from Jacob but her cell phone rings, alerting Jacob to her location. He subsequently kills her by forcing the cell phone down her throat. Michael finds Christine and Tyson as they try to rescue Kira, but they are attacked again by Jacob, who knocks out Michael while the other two escape up the elevator shaft.

The pair find Kira but are interrupted by Jacob before they can release her. Tyson creates a distraction but is electrocuted with his own taser and crushed with the bank vault. Margaret then shows up, and reveals herself as Jacob&#x27;s mother, who lured Frank back to the hotel to get revenge on him for shooting her son, and explains the prisoners are merely a &quot;bonus&quot;. Margaret attempts to shoot Kira, but Jacob intervenes and throws her headfirst into a nail on the wall. Michael reappears to help the girls battle Jacob, and the trio is eventually able to stab him through the eye with a pipe and throw him out of a window, where his heart is impaled by a shard of glass, presumably killing him. Michael, Kira, and Christine escape the hotel togheter.

<text>Bhavnagar is a city and the headquarters of Bhavnagar district in the Indian state of Gujarat. It was founded in 1723 by Bhavsinhji Gohil. It was the capital of Bhavnagar State, which was a princely state before it was merged into the Indian Union in February 1948.

Bhavnagar is situated 190 kilometres away from the state capital Gandhinagar and to the west of the Gulf of Khambhat. It has always been an important city for trade with many large and small scale industries along with the world&#x27;s largest ship breaking yard, Alang which is located 50 kilometres away. Bhavnagar is also famous for its version of the popular Gujarati snack &#x27;Ganthiya&#x27; and &#x27;Jalebi&#x27;.

==History==


The Gohil Rajput of the Suryavanshi clan faced severe competition in Marwar. Around 1260 AD, they moved down to the Gujarat&#x27;s coastal area and established three capitals: Sejakpur (now Ranpur), Umrala, and Sihor. Sejakpur was founded in 1194.

In 1722–1723, the forces led by Khanthaji Kadani and Maratha Pilaji Gaekwad attempted to raid Sihor but were repelled by Maharajah Bhavsinhji Gohil. After the war, Bhavsinhji realized the reason for repeated attacks was the location of Sihor. In 1723, he established a new capital near Vadva village, 20 km away from Sihor, and named it Bhavnagar after himself. It was a carefully chosen and strategic location because of its potential for maritime trade. Naturally, Bhavnagar became the capital of Bhavnagar State. In 1807, Bhavnagar State became a British protectorate.

The old town of Bhavnagar was a fortified town with gates leading to other important regional towns. It remained a major port for almost two centuries, trading commodities with Mozambique, Zanzibar, Singapore, and the Persian Gulf.

Bhavsinhji ensured that Bhavnagar benefited from the revenue that was brought in from maritime trade, which was monopolized by Surat and Cambay. As the castle of Surat was under the control of the Siddis of Janjira, Bhavsinhji brokered an agreement with them, giving the Sidis 1.25% of the revenue by Bhavnagar port. Bhavsinhji entered into a similar agreement with the British when they took over Surat in 1856. Whilst Bhavsinhji was in power, Bhavnagar grew from a small chieftainship to a considerably important state. This was due to the addition of new territories as well as the income provided by maritime trade. Bhavsinhji&#x27;s successors continued to encourage maritime trade through Bhavnagar port, recognizing its importance to the state. The territory was further expanded by Bhavsinhji&#x27;s grandson, Vakhatsinhji Gohil, when he took possession of lands belonging to Kolis and Kathis, obtained Rajula from the Navab Saheb Ahmad Khan, and merged Ghogha Taluka into the state.

In 1793, Vakhatsinhji conquered the forts of Chital and Talaja, and later conquered Mahuva, Kundla, Trapaj, Umrala and Botad. Bhavnagar remained the main port of the state, with Mahuva and Ghogha also becoming important ports. Because of the maritime trade, the state prospered compared to other states. During the late 19th century, the Bhavnagar State Railway was constructed. This made Bhavnagar the first state that was able to construct its railway system without any aid from the central government, which was mentioned in The Imperial Gazetteer of India. Mr. Peile, a political agent, described the state as follows: &quot;With flourishing finances and much good work in progress. Of financial matters I need say little; you have no debts, and your treasury is full.&quot; Between 1870 and 1878, the state were put under joint administration, due to the fact that Prince Takhtsinhji was a minor. This period produced some notable reforms in the areas of administration, revenue collection, judiciary, the post and telegraph services, and economic policy. The ports were also modernized. The two people who were responsible for those reforms were E. H. Percival of the Bombay Civil Service and Gaurishankar Udayshankar Oza, Chief Minister of Bhavnagar State Bhavnagar Boroz.

In 1911, Maharani Nundkanvarba of Bhavnagar was awarded the Order of the Crown of India, the highest Imperial award for women of the British Empire. The former princely state of Bhavnagar was also known as Gohilwad, &quot;Land of the Gohils&quot; (the clan of the ruling family).

===Merger with the Indian Union in 1947===

Until the independence of India in 1947, Bhavnagar was an independent state ruled by the Rajput Gohil family. In 1947, the Deputy Prime Minister of the newly independent Indian Union Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel undertook the ambitious and complex process of unifying 562 princely states with the Union of India. The last ruling Maharajah of Bhavnagar, Krishnakumar Sinhji handed over the administration of his Bombay State to the people&#x27;s representative in 1948.

Maharaja Krishna Kumarsinhji was one of the first to merge his kingdom to the Union of India.

The erstwhile royal family of Bhavnagar continues to lead an active role in the public eye as well as in business (hotels, real estate, agriculture, and ship-breaking) and is held in high regard by the population both in the city as well as areas that comprised the former princely state of Bhavnagar.

==Geography and climate==

===Topography===
Bhavnagar is a coastal city on the eastern coast of Saurashtra, also known as Kathiawar, located at . It has an average elevation of 24 metres (78 ft). It occupies an area of 53.3 km2 (20.6 sq mi) and 5th most populated city of Gujarat. The general slope dips towards the northeast at the apex of Gulf of Khambhat. A small non-perennial river named Kansara Nala passes through the outer area of the city.

===Climate===
Like most of Gujarat, Bhavnagar has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen: &quot;BSh&quot;), with hot, dry summers from March to mid-June, the wet monsoon season from mid-June to October, and mild winters from November to February. There is essentially no rainfall outside the monsoon season, whilst during the monsoon the city receives around of rain on average, though variability is extreme as can be seen from annual totals as high as in 1970 but as little as in 1974. The semi-arid classification is due to the city&#x27;s high evapotranspiration. The average temperature from November to February is around , with low humidity.

==Geology==

The region of Saurashtra is a geologically active part of West India, and falls in the seismic zone 3 of the Zoning Map of the Bureau of Indian Standards. The region as a whole and the area around Bhavnagar, in particular, has been tectonically unstable.

Between 9 August 2000 and 15 December 2000, there was a series of earthquakes in east Saurashtra with epicenters in Bhavnagar. 132 earthquakes between magnitude 0.5 to 3.8 were recorded. There were five earthquakes greater than magnitude 3, with a maximum magnitude of 3.8. These events were confined to an area which covered the southern part of Bhavnagar city and Tarsamiya village on the outskirts of the town. There was no loss of life recorded due to this earthquake.

According to historical records, an earthquake of magnitude 7 occurred near Bhavnagar in February 1705. Earthquake swarm activity also occurred in and around Paliyad (60 km north of Bhavnagar) during July–August 1938 for about two months, with four earthquakes of magnitude greater than or equal to 5 and a maximum magnitude of 6.0.

==City planning and architecture==

Multiple town planning schemes were designed and implemented under the guidance of the progressive rulers of Bhavnagar. During the reign of Sir Takhtsinhji, the British State Engineer Proctor Sims supervised the construction of Barton Library, Sir Takhtsinhji Hospital.

*Takhteshwar Temple (1893) is located on a hill, on a high plinth, offering a commanding view of Bhavnagar. The high shikhara rising above the pillared rectangular mandapa makes it an important landmark.
* Gangajalia (1893) is a temple dedicated to Ganga-Devi, with a chhatri, pavilion, and bridge all of white marble. It is located in the middle of a former tank. It was designed by Sir John Griffith, principal of Sir J J School of Arts, Bombay.
* Nilambag Palace (1894), now a heritage hotel, is set amidst a huge estate of . It was designed by a British architect, William Emerson as a royal residence; he also designed the Sir Takhtsinhji Hospital and later Victoria Memorial in Calcutta. It combines elements of Indian architecture with a modern outlook.
* Barton Library (1895) is a two-storeyed building, appropriately designed for a road junction. It has two wings and a central tower, constructed in ashlar stone masonry, with Gothic arch windows and a sloping roof with Mangalore tiles. It is one of the oldest libraries of Gujarat and also houses a museum.
* Town Hall (1932) was formerly a Darbar Hall, where the coronation of Sir Krishnakumarsinhji took place. It is an imposing structure in the colonial style, set in a well laid out garden.
*Modern &amp; Contemporary Architectural services is provided by various leading Architectural firm like SAGA whose work is diverse yet of unified character, not only functional, aesthetic and techno-savvy.

Modern Bhavnagar comprises Takhteshvar Plots, Krishnanagar, Sardarnagar and surrounding area. During 1935–1937, Krishnanagar area was planned and developed by late Shri Virendrabhai C. Mehta, the official town planner for the State of Bhavnagar. In 1961, he extended his Krishnanagar plan towards Sardarnagar. In 1975, he created a master plan for Bhavnagar.

A salient feature of town planning is to have gardens at the junction of roads. Gardens are located at Ghogha Circle, Mahila College Circle, Rupani Circle, Meghani Circle, Shivaji Circle, Sardarnagar Circle, Jewels Circle and Crescent Circle.

<text>John Sibthorp (28 October 1758 – 8 February 1796) was an English botanist.

== Education ==
Sibthorp graduated from the University of Oxford in 1777 where he was an undergraduate student at Lincoln College, Oxford. He subsequently studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh and University of Montpellier.

==Career and research==
In 1784, he succeeded his father to the Sherardian chair. Leaving his professional duties to a deputy, he left England for Göttingen and Vienna, in preparation for a botanical tour of Greece (1786) and Cyprus (1787).

Returning to England at the end of the following year, he took part in the foundation of the Linnean Society of London in 1788, and set to work on a Flora of Oxfordshire, which was published in 1794 as &quot;Flora Oxoniensis&quot;. He was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society in Mar 1788.

He made a second journey to Greece, but developed consumption on the way home and died in Bath on 8 February 1796. He was buried at Bath Abbey, with a monument carved by John Flaxman which includes a garland of &quot;Sibthorpia europaea&quot;.

His will bequeathed his books on natural history and agriculture to the University of Oxford, and also founded Oxford&#x27;s Sibthorpian Professorship of Rural Economy (subsequently titled the Sibthorpian Professorship of Plant Science). He directed that his endowment should first be applied to the publication of his &quot;Flora Graeca&quot; and &quot;Florae Graecae Prodromus&quot;, for which, however, he had done little beyond collecting some three thousand species and providing the plates. The task of preparing the works was undertaken by Sir J.E. Smith, who issued the two volumes of the &quot;Prodromus&quot; in 1806 and 1813, and six volumes of the &quot;Flora Graeca&quot; between 1806 and 1828. The seventh appeared in 1830, after Smith&#x27;s death, and the remaining three were produced by John Lindley between 1833 and 1840. The work&#x27;s first edition ran to a mere thirty copies and featured 966 colour plates; a supplementary volume depicting wildflowers of Corfu was painted for Frederick North, 5th Earl of Guilford, and founder of the Ionian Academy, by G. Scola (or Scala), a talented botanical illustrator.

The standard botanical author abbreviation Sibth. is applied to species he described.

=== Herbarium ===

His herbarium (of three collections; 2,462 &#x27;Flora Graeca&#x27; specimens, 70 &#x27;Flora Oxoniensis&#x27; specimens and 444 miscellaneous specimens) is stored within the Fielding-Druce Herbarium of the University of Oxford.

===Sibthorpian Chair and Professor===
The chair of Sibthorpian Professor at the University of Oxford is named after him. Current and previous holders include

* Nicholas Harberd (since 2007)
* Chris J. Leaver (1990–2007)
* David Smith (1980–1987)
* Geoffrey Emett Blackman (1945–1980)
* James Anderson Scott Watson
* John Harrison Burnett
* Joseph Henry Gilbert

== Personal life ==
Sibthorp was born in Oxford, the youngest son of Humphry Sibthorp (1713–1797), who, from 1747 to 1784, served as Sherardian Professor of Botany at the University of Oxford and his first wife Sarah Waldo.

<doc id="1278581" wikidata="Q6548597" url="?curid=1278581" title="Chã das Caldeiras">
<text>Chã das Caldeiras (; ) is a small community of approximately 700 inhabitants in the crater of the volcano Pico do Fogo on the island of Fogo, Cape Verde. The village consists of two main neighborhoods: Portela and Bangaeira, founded in 1920 and 1917, respectively. At an elevation of about 1,700 meters, it is the highest village in Cape Verde. It is part of the municipality of Santa Catarina do Fogo. The main organizing body in the village is the &quot;Associação dos Agricultores de Chã&quot; (Chã Farmers Association), an agricultural cooperative that holds considerable sway over the local economy. Chã is the only area in Cape Verde that grows significant quantities of grapes and produces export-quality wines.

There is no running water or electricity in Chã, though residents are increasingly using generators at night to light and power their homes. All non-drinking water is collected rainwater, stored in large cistern tanks for use in the dry season (November to July).

==History==

=== The Count Of Montrond ===
In 1870, the Count of Montrond (François Louis Armand Fourcheut De Montrond, France) stopped on the island en route to Brazil. He brought with him the vines that kicked off wine production in the caldera. He also produced coffee and exported it to Portugal. With his background in engineering and medicine, he oversaw construction of a road from Sao Filipe to Mosteiros and sank wells that are still in use today. Proficient in the use of herbs and herbal remedies, he imported medicinal herbs for use on the island.

At the age of 60, he fell off of a horse and died of an infection in a broken leg.

Many of the inhabitants of Chã, with their light skin, blond hair, and blue eyes, can trace their ancestry back to the biologically prolific Count of Montrond.

=== 1995 Eruption ===
In April 1995, an eruption of the Pico do Fogo damaged several houses in Chã das Caldeiras. Pico do Fogo erupted again in November 2014, destroying 75% of the buildings in Portela, Bangaeira and Ilhéu de Losna. Most of these were covered by lava. After the eruption, the majority of the inhabitants left the village. Cabeça Fundão on the park&#x27;s edge became the seat of the natural park. A few homes have been rebuilt.

==Natural setting==
A large crater rim with 1000-meter escarpments, called the &quot;Bordeira&quot;, encircles the village. On the plain is one large volcanic peak (2,829 m from sea level) and several smaller peaks and lava fields from recent eruptions, most notably 1951, 1995 and 2014 (during which the entire population had to be evacuated). The entire caldera, some 67 km2, is a protected area as part of the Fogo Natural Park (&quot;Parque Natural do Fogo&quot;), a cooperative effort between the German and Cape Verdean governments.

==Flora and fauna==
===Endemic plants===
84% of the endemic plants (31 total species) on Fogo are located in Chã and on the Bordeira. 48% of these are designated as rare and/or threatened on the Ministry of Environment, Agriculture, and Fisheries&#x27; (MAAP) “Red List,” which includes the species &quot;Cynanchum daltonii&quot;, &quot;Echium volcanorum&quot;, &quot;Erysimum caboverdeanum&quot;, &quot;Verbascum cystolithicum&quot;, &quot;Lavandula rotundifolia&quot;, &quot;Periploca laevigata sp. chevalieri&quot;, &quot;Euphorbia tuckeyana&quot;, and &quot;Tornabenea bischoffii&quot; and the genus &quot;Diplotaxis&quot;. These plants are specifically adapted to the caldera&#x27;s climate (periodically, Chã receives frost during the winter months) and volcanic soils. Chã&#x27;s endemic plants, along with its unique terrain, are under increasing strain due to overgrazing and to the fuel and fodder collecting of the local populations.

===Fauna===
Its fauna mainly include insects, not as many in the lower areas, it is one of the places where it is non-existent. A warbler, the Cape Verde warbler (&quot;Acrocephalus brevipennis&quot;) are one of several places in the island that are not founded as their habitat is up to 1,300 meters of elevation.

==Climate==
Unlike the rest of the archipelago (which has an extremely dry, arid, and warm variation of a desert climate), Chã das Caldeiras has a cool semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSk&quot;) due to its elevation, which also makes it Cape Verde&#x27;s coolest village. Due to its climate, it has a cool average temperature at , and a relatively high amount of rain (for Cape Verdean standards) at ; the largest amount of which falls in September (). It is also a factor that enables the village to grow and withhold a grape and winery industry; something that could hardly be achieved or sustained in any of its low-lying counterparts.


==Agriculture==
Chã has a lot of vegetation (albeit not in the lava fields), which grows in the rich volcanic soils adjacent to the crater rim. Because of its altitude (elevation 1,629 m), Chã is blessed with milder temperatures and greater precipitation than surrounding areas.

Products in the caldera include fruits (apples, grapes, quince fruit, pomegranate, figs, peaches and tomatoes) and vegetables (beans, corn, potatoes, yams, manioc, and peppers) for local consumption and commercial production. The Associação buys excess fruit from the local farmers and turns it into white, red, rosé, and passito wine (label “&quot;Chã&quot;”); grape (&quot;grappa&quot;), apple, quince, and peach spirits (label “&quot;Espírito da Caldeira&quot;”); apple, quince, and peach marmalade; grape, fig, and quince compotes; apple and pomegranate jelly; and pomegranate and grape juice for commercial sale.

Also famous is home-made goat cheese, &quot;queijo de cabra&quot;. The Associação also roasts and grinds Fogo coffee, &quot;Café do Fogo&quot; (label “&quot;Café das Caldeiras&quot;”), grown on the northern flank of the island. The local economy is based primarily on this specialty agriculture and animal-raising, the majority of which is sold domestically or to tourists. The “Chã” label wines, however, are available outside of the country on a limited basis, especially in Cape Verdean enclaves in Massachusetts, Lisbon, Paris, and Rotterdam.

== Wines and Pomace brandy ==

The “Chã” label wines, made by the Associação (with help from the Italian NGO Cospe and the EU), are full-bodied and rich in color and extract. All of the grapes used in the wines are locally grown by farmers inside the caldera, which has a 120-year wine-making tradition. The first wines made in the crater to be exported were sent to Brazil and Guinea-Bissau, then a Portuguese colony like Cape Verde.

Chã&#x27;s climate and terrain are optimal for viticulture. Days are usually hot and dry, nights cool and humid. With sufficient rain, high-quality, semi-sweet grapes grow (1.2 km2 total) in the caldera&#x27;s rich volcanic soils. In 2006, the Associação produced 40,000 cases of wine (12 bottles each) from 100,000 kg of grapes. The percentage of alcohol in the “Chã” wines (14%) is greater than what is found in wines from the EU or California (usually between 11.5 and 12.5%).

The red wine, vinho tinto, made from the low-lying Portuguese &quot;preta tradicional&quot; variety of grapes, has a dark red color with shades of purple. Odors include tones and flavors of small, dark fruits like the currant or blackberry. This sensation is enriched with shades of pepper and Muscat nut. The wine&#x27;s rich body, best when served at room temperature (20 °C), combines well with the strength of the alcohol. The soft, velvet tannins of the wine can be appreciated when it is still young. (Market forces being such, Chã&#x27;s reds have not yet been aged for any considerable time. The majority of the label is consumed within a year of production.) The red is perfect alone or to accompany any meat of strong taste.

The white wine, vinho branco, made from locally grown Moscatel grapes, has a fresh taste, unique clarity, and golden shades. Odors include that of semi-sweet citric fruits like the grapefruit. These characteristics are noticed visually and on the palate, where the wine combines harmoniously with the alcohol content. The white also has a subtle, residual sweetness to be enjoyed with appetizers or with fish, shellfish, white meats, or Chã&#x27;s goat cheese. This elegant wine is best served at a temperature of 10 °C and can be saved for 2–3 years if stored correctly.

The rosé wine, vinho rosé, uses a similar variety of dark grapes as the red. It has an elegant rose color with flavors of small, sweet fruits like currants and strawberries. Like the white, the rosé is fresh on the palate and is best savored alone or with light meals, again at 10 °C. It too can be enjoyed up to three years.

New to the “Chã” family of wines is the sweet vinho passito, made with the same Moscatel variety of grapes as the vinho branco. However, unlike with the white, the grapes used for the passito are first sun-dried, after which these &quot;uvas passas&quot;, or raisins, are put through the regular fermentation and filtration processes. Because dried grapes are used, the alcohol content in the passito is lower, at about 10.6%, than what is found in the other “Chã” wines (14%). The passito has a dark amber color; is slightly more viscous than the white, red, and rosé; and has a pleasant acidity to balance its sweetness. Odors include that of figs and dried fruits like raisins, prunes and dates. The passito is ideal between 12° and 14 °C as either a post-dinner or dessert wine or, simply, as a “wine of meditation.”

===Wine making at the Associação===

During the wine-making process, much attention is given to the hygienic conditions of the cellar and machines. After arrival, the grapes are cleaned and are either crushed (to make red wine) or pressed (to make white and rosé). This process is done as quickly as possible to prevent contamination and odor. The pulp is then put in specially-designed barrels in the cellar, where the temperature remains cool even during the hottest days, to begin the fermentation process. This is when the sugar of the grapes turns to alcohol and where the unique characteristics of the wine begin to develop.

The red wine ferments with the grape skins and is pressed afterwards. Then, the wine is fermented for a second time to eliminate remaining bacteria and reduce its vinegar-like acidity. After the second fermentation, the young wine is filtered and drawn into barrels for conservation. The white and rosé wines, on the other hand, are immediately filtered after the first fermentation to maintain freshness and to avoid bacteria growth. Until the wines are bottled, they remain in barrels (to avoid exposure to sunlight and air), except for periodic filtrations to improve clarity.

===Manecom===

Chã&#x27;s best-known wine, however, is called Manecom, a traditional, semi-sweet or -dry, house-made wine. (It should not be confused with the “Chã” label red, white, rosé, and passito wines.) Most households make Manecom for commercial production and personal consumption. The wine can either be a red or white, dry or sweet, but the sweet red variety is by far the most popular.

Manecom gets its name, legend has it, from a man named Manuel Montrond, supposedly the first person to live in Chã. &quot;Manuel Montrond&quot; in Portuguese, took a liking to the strong, sweet red wine he made. Other inhabitants coined Manuel&#x27;s wine Manecom. The name stuck and remains to this day.

===Vinha Maria Chaves wines===
New since 2012 is the harvesting of grapes and the production of wines by &quot;Vinha Maria Chaves&quot;, a new vineyard created during the last 10 years. The vineyard is about 25 hectares of surface and is located just beneath the crater. Adjoining, there is the newly constructed winery &quot;Adega de Monte Barro&quot;, for the vinification, aging and bottling of the wines. 4 qualities of wines are produced : santaLuzia (white), sanVicente (rosé), sanTiago (red) and sanFilipe (red). These wines are produced with the grapes from the Maria Chaves vineyard and grapes from Chã das Caldeiras . These wines will be mainly exported.
During the festivities of April 30, 2013, the &quot;Adega de Monte Barro&quot; was inaugurated and the new wines were presented to the President, the prime minister and other officials of Cape Verde.

=== Pomace brandy ===
After the white wine is fermented, the remnant pomace of moscatel grapes is distilled to produce a pomace brandy : destilado de uva (label “Espírito da Caldeira”), that is bright and clear. The spirit&#x27;s strength enables the drinker to taste, and feel on his/her palate, the flavor of Moscatel grapes. The after taste is smooth and has a hint of sweetness to balance the spirit&#x27;s high alcohol content (45%).

== Spirits of fruits or herbs ==
The quince spirit, destilado de marmelo, is produced from well-ripened quince fruit. Odors include that of the sweet, tart fruits of the caldera (like quince, apples, and grapes), flavors which combine nicely with the strength of the spirit&#x27;s alcohol. The finish of the destilado de marmelo is smooth, gentle, and sweet.

The destilado com ervas digestivas, or spirit with herbs, has the unique taste, aroma, potency, and medicinal properties to help with post-dinner digestion. The spirit is a combination of herbs that have been used as a traditional medicine by the people of Chã for generations.

<text>The Marine is a 2006 American action film directed by John Bonito from a story written by Alan B. McElroy and Michelle Gallagher. It stars professional wrestler John Cena, in his acting debut and was executively produced by Vince McMahon through the film production division of WWE called WWE Films and distributed in the United States by 20th Century Fox. In the film, a recently discharged U.S. Marine goes after some diamond thieves after they kidnapped his wife.

&quot;The Marine&quot; was released theatrically on October 13, 2006 to negative reviews and grossed $22 million against a production budget of $15 million. It is the first entry in &quot;The Marine&quot; film series, spawning five direct-to-video sequels.

==Plot==
In Iraq, John Triton, a U.S. Marine, arrives at an al-Qaeda hideout, where a group of terrorists are preparing to behead several hostages. Disregarding direct orders to wait for reinforcements, Triton attacks the extremists and rescues the hostages. The next morning, his colonel informs Triton that he is being honorably discharged for disobeying direct orders.

Now retired, Triton finds it hard to settle back into normal life. He is fired from his job as a security guard for using excessive force on an employee&#x27;s ex-boyfriend and his bodyguards. Triton&#x27;s wife Kate decides the two need a vacation to help Triton adjust to his new life. Meanwhile, criminal Rome robs a jewelry store with his gang: girlfriend Angela, Morgan, Vescera, and Bennett. Rome is in collusion with an anonymous partner, with whom he is planning on sharing the profits from the diamonds. On the run, the gang stops at a gas station where Triton and Kate have stopped. When two policemen arrive to buy gas, Morgan shoots and kills one of the officers, causing Rome to shoot the other officer while Angela kills the gas station attendant. When Triton reacts to Kate being kidnapped, Bennett knocks him out. Triton regains consciousness and gives chase in the policemen&#x27;s car. The chase leads to a lake, where Triton falls out of the patrol car and into the lake, seemingly to his death.

Rome and his gang walk through a swamp to avoid the police. Kate tries to escape several times. Triton emerges from the lake to find Detective Van Buren, who is pursuing the gang. Van Buren denies Triton permission to pursue the gang, but Triton heads into the swamp anyway. After an altercation between Morgan and Vescera, Rome decides to kill Vescera. Rome gets a call from his anonymous partner, and Rome tells him that he intends to cut the partner out of the deal.

The gang arrives at a lodge and decide to rest there for the time being. Meanwhile, Triton is kidnapped by two fugitives who believe he is a police officer looking for them. He subdues them and tracks the gang to the lodge. He kills Morgan and Bennett then drags the bodies under the lodge, where he again meets Detective Van Buren.

Kate rushes out of the lodge, but Angela attacks and recaptures her. Meanwhile, Triton enters the lodge and finds himself face-to-face with Rome and his gun. Van Buren enters the room but points his gun at Triton, revealing himself to be the anonymous partner. Rome opens fire on Triton, who uses Van Buren as a human shield, killing him. Rome makes his escape and joins up with Angela and Kate before firing at a gasoline tank and blowing up the lodge. Triton makes a narrow escape, having been blown into the swamp.

Rome escapes in Van Buren&#x27;s car, but abandons it due to a police tracking device. Angela seduces and kills a truck driver for his truck. Triton is arrested by a marine patrol officer, but steals the officer&#x27;s vessel after handcuffing him. He races to the marina that is Rome&#x27;s destination and jumps on Rome&#x27;s truck, throwing Angela into the windshield of an oncoming bus, killing her and spilling the diamonds. Rome scrapes Triton off the truck by careening through a warehouse, then leaps out just before the truck crashes into a lake. Triton engages Rome in hand-to-hand combat and knocks him out before he leaves Rome in the burning warehouse to rescue Kate, who is drowning in the truck. A badly-burned Rome returns and tries to choke Triton with a chain, but Triton kills Rome by breaking his neck with the chain. The final scene depicts Triton and Kate kissing as the police arrive.

==Production==
&quot;The Marine&quot; was originally written with Al Pacino in mind for the part of criminal Rome, with Stone Cold Steve Austin as hero Triton. After Austin and WWE parted ways in 2004, Randy Orton was set to be the main character. Orton turned down the role because of his bad conduct discharge from the Marines in the late 1990s, and was replaced by John Cena. Pacino turned down the role of Rome due to the low salary offered. After Pacino turned it down, Ray Liotta was considered for the role of Rome, but Robert Patrick got the part instead.

Principal photography for the film was actually shot and completed in 2004. In order to cover for John Cena&#x27;s absence from WWE events, a storyline was written after Carlito beat Cena for the WWE United States Championship, saying that he was stabbed by Carlito&#x27;s bodyguard Jesús and was taking time off to recover.

Filming was done at Movie World Studios in Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. The Marine Base was filmed at Bond University. The part in which skyscrapers are shown is the downtown area of Brisbane, Australia. Other footage was shot in bush land surrounding Brisbane. The opening segment of the downtown scenes was filmed in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Cena was approached by Vince McMahon to do the movie which he accepted for outside fame. On making the movie he said &quot;I enjoyed the business plan, I didn&#x27;t enjoy the experience&quot;.

==Release==

===Box office===
In its first weekend, the film made approximately $7.1 million at the United States box office. In its first weekend, it placed #6 domestically. 
After a total of ten weeks in theaters, the film grossed $18.8 million domestically.

===Critical response===
The film received mostly negative reviews, holding a 17% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 46 reviews (with an average rating of 4 out of 10), with the site&#x27;s general consensus stating &quot;Overblown in every possible way, &quot;The Marine&quot; is either so bad it&#x27;s good or just really, really bad.&quot; Eric the Actor was a fan of the film and wanted to promote the film due his fondness for Cena on the Howard Stern Show; however, his promotion and rally for people to go and see this film failed.

===Home media===
The film was released on DVD on January 30, 2007, which featured the &quot;rated&quot; version and the &quot;unrated&quot; version. The Blu-ray version was released on February 13, 2007, with a DTS-HD Lossless Master Audio 5.1 track and a 1080p HD transfer. The DVD grossed $27.3 million in domestic video sales.

==Sequels==
The film has spawned five direct-to-video sequels:
* &quot;The Marine 2&quot;, featuring Ted DiBiase Jr. in the main role, released on December 29, 2009
* &quot;The Marine 3: Homefront&quot;, released on March 5, 2013
* &quot;The Marine 4: Moving Target&quot;, released on April 21, 2015
* &quot;The Marine 5: Battleground&quot;, released on April 25, 2017
* &quot;The Marine 6: Close Quarters&quot;, released on November 13, 2018

The last four sequels have starred professional wrestler Mike &quot;The Miz&quot; Mizanin in the role of Jake Carter.

<doc id="1278598" wikidata="Q2056751" url="?curid=1278598" title="Return of the Saint">
<text>Return of the Saint is a British action-adventure television series that aired for one series in 1978 and 1979 in Britain on ITV, and was also broadcast on CBS in the United States. It was co-produced by ITC Entertainment and the Italian broadcaster RAI and ran for 24 episodes.

==Premise==
&quot;Return of the Saint&quot; is a revival/updating of &quot;The Saint&quot;, a programme based upon the stories of Leslie Charteris that had originally aired from 1962 to 1969, and starred Roger Moore as Simon Templar (the character, in turn, had been introduced by Charteris in a series of novels and short stories dating back to 1928). The new series starred Ian Ogilvy as Templar, an independently wealthy, somewhat mysterious &#x27;do-gooder&#x27; known as &#x27;The Saint&#x27;. Templar is shown travelling around Britain and Europe, helping out the people he encounters, though he is also often summoned by past acquaintances.

The series borrowed a few storytelling elements from its predecessor. Once again, each episode began with Simon narrating an introduction to set the scene for viewers, and each pre-credit sequence ended with an animated halo appearing above Templar&#x27;s head as he was identified. &quot;Return&quot; also made a recurring reference to the 1930s–40s film series, and the 1940s radio series that starred Vincent Price as Templar: just before the opening credits begin, a short musical phrase is heard that is not part of the theme music for the &quot;Return of the Saint&quot;, but is the character&#x27;s signature theme from film and radio. Unlike the film series, and occasional episodes of the Roger Moore series, Ogilvy&#x27;s series did not feature any recurring characters besides Simon.

Other than these cosmetic touches, there is no continuity implied between the Ogilvy and Moore series.

==Production==
One major difference between the two series is that the original was mostly filmed in British studios and locations (although set in various places around the world), while many episodes of &quot;Return&quot; were filmed on location throughout Europe. The music was written by John Scott and, like the last colour series of &quot;The Saint&quot;, incorporated Leslie Charteris&#x27; own theme, which had previously been used in films and on radio. For the French version, Scott&#x27;s music was replaced with a theme incorporating vocals (as had happened to previous &quot;Saint&quot; composer Edwin Astley with &quot;Danger Man&quot;), but Charteris&#x27; eight-note theme remained.

Jaguar seized promotional opportunities with &quot;Return of the Saint&quot;. A decade and a half earlier, Jaguar had turned down the producers of &quot;The Saint&quot; when approached about the E-Type; the producers had instead used a Volvo P1800. In &quot;Return&quot; Templar drives an XJ-S with the number plate &quot;ST 1&quot;. Miniature versions were made by Corgi and proved popular.

According to Burl Barer in his history of &quot;The Saint&quot;, the series was originally conceived as &quot;Son of the Saint&quot;, with Ogilvy&#x27;s character identified as the offspring of Simon Templar. As production neared, it was decided to drop the relative angle and make the series about the original character, albeit updated to the late 1970s.

Unlike the earlier series, &quot;Return of the Saint&quot; did not adapt any Charteris stories; however, several teleplays (such as &quot;The Imprudent Professor&quot; and &quot;Collision Course&quot;) were adapted as novels that were credited to Charteris but written by others. A number of Saint books were reprinted with covers depicting Ogilvy as Templar as a tie-in with the series; these collectable volumes carried the &quot;Return of the Saint&quot; title. The adaptation of &quot;Collision Course&quot;, retitled &quot;Salvage for the Saint&quot; was published in 1983 (several years after the series ended) and was the 50th and final Saint book to be published in a series of publications dating back to the 1920s.

===TV movie===
The two episodes from the &quot;Collision Course&quot;, were also re-edited together to form the syndicated television movie titled &quot;The Saint and the Brave Goose&quot;.

==Legacy==

Ogilvy became very popular in Britain and Europe because of the series and in the early 1980s was considered a major contender for replacing Moore as James Bond. Ogilvy never got the role but did record a series of popular audiobook adaptations of the Bond novels in the late 1970s and played a Bond-like character for a 1980s TV commercial.

Broadcasts of the series on CBS, which lasted into 1980, sparked a revival of interest in Moore&#x27;s original series.

Robert S. Baker, who developed and produced the earlier &quot;The Saint&quot; series for Roger Moore, performed the same duties with &quot;Return of the Saint&quot;. Years later, Baker was also executive producer of the 1997 Saint film starring Val Kilmer as Templar.

&quot;Return of The Saint&quot; is now seen as the last of the action/adventure television series produced by ITC Entertainment.

==Charteris cameo==
Saint creator Leslie Charteris makes an Alfred Hitchcock-style walk-on cameo appearance in the &quot;Collision Course&quot; two-parter.

<text>Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag (1885–1954) or Yehuda Leib Ha-Levi Ashlag (), also known as the Baal Ha-Sulam (Hebrew: , &quot;Author of The Ladder&quot;) in reference to his magnum opus, was an Orthodox rabbi, kabbalist and anarchist born in Łuków, Congress Poland, Russian Empire, to a family of scholars connected to the Hasidic courts of Porisov and Belz. Rabbi Ashlag lived in the Holy Land from 1922 until his death in 1954 (except for two years in England). In addition to his &quot;Sulam&quot; commentary on the Zohar, his other primary work, &quot;Talmud Eser Sefirot&quot; is regarded as the central textbook for students of Kabbalah. Ashlag systematically interpreted the wisdom and promoted its wide dissemination. In line with his directives, many contemporary adherents of Ashlag&#x27;s teachings strive to spread Kabbalah to the masses.

==Biography==

===Poland===

Ashlag reputedly studied Kabbalah from the age of seven, hiding pages from the book &quot;Etz Chaim&quot; 
&quot;The Tree of Life&quot; by Rabbi  Hayyim ben Joseph Vital in the Talmudic tractate he was meant to be studying. At the age of twelve, he studied the Talmud independently. By nineteen, Ashlag&#x27;s knowledge of the Torah was profound enough for the rabbis of Warsaw to confer upon him the title of rabbi.

During this period he worked as a judge in the court of the Warsaw rabbis and also gained experience as a teacher for training judges for Jewish courts. Ashlag also studied German while in Warsaw, and read original texts of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Arthur Schopenhauer.

While still in Poland, he met an unidentified Warsaw merchant, who revealed himself to Ashlag as a Kabbalist. Ashlag studied with this particular teacher every night for three months, he said, “until my arrogance separated us,” and the teacher disappeared. A few months later Ashlag met the teacher again, and after pleading with him, convinced him to reveal an important kabbalistic secret. The next day, the teacher died.

===Israel===

In 1921, at the age of 36, Ashlag made the decision to emigrate to the Land of Israel, a journey that took several months. He spent the first few years living anonymously, supporting his family through manual labor by day and writing his commentaries at night. Eventually, he was recognized through his work, and was appointed Rabbi of Givat Shaul, Jerusalem in 1924.

Ashlag was friendly with the Kabbalist and Chief Rabbi of Mandatory Palestine, Abraham Isaac Kook, who recognized Ashlag as a great follower of Isaac Luria. Ashlag had high hopes of meeting great Kabbalists in Jerusalem including the Sephardi followers of the great 18th-century Yemenite Jewish Kabbalist Shalom Sharabi. However, he was profoundly disappointed by his encounter with them. Their views about Kabbalah ran contrary to Ashlag&#x27;s experience with the teaching as a means of profound personal transformation and spiritual illumination, by becoming a vessel for divine light.

In 1926 Ashlag left for London, and it was there that he wrote his commentary on The Arizal&#x27;s (Isaac Luria) book &quot;Etz Chaim&quot;. This work is entitled &quot;Panim Meirot wMasbirot&quot;. It took him one and a half years to complete this work. It was published in 1927, and in 1928 Ashlag returned to the Land of Israel (Mandatory Palestine).

In 1932 Ashlag and his family moved to Jaffa. During this period, Ashlag also began one of his main works, &quot;Talmud Eser Sefirot&quot;, a commentary on all the writings of Isaac Luria. In this undertaking, he developed a comprehensive explanation of the sequence of the creation of all of the upper worlds (&quot;Olamot Elyonim&quot;), starting with the source of emanation (&quot;Ma&#x27;atzil&quot;) and finishing with our world (&quot;Olam HaZeh&quot;). The work is divided into six volumes, containing sixteen parts and over two thousand pages. Some today consider it as the core of the entire teaching of Kabbalah.

In the 1930s Ashlag, now in his fifties, gathered around him a group of disciples, including Rav Yehuda Tzvi Brandwein, his closest student, and studied Kabbalah every night, often from shortly after midnight until dawn. He also authored many articles and letters at this time that openly promoted the study of Kabbalah on a mass scale. Ashlag went to great lengths to publish Kabbalistic material in media suitable for disseminating the knowledge he had acquired across the entire nation. He began an independent Kabbalistic newsletter publication, &quot;HaUma&quot; &quot;The Nation&quot;, of which only one issue survived.
Ashlag differs fundamentally from all Kabbalists of the past, who studied and taught Kabbalah in a concealed manner, in that he felt a great need to reveal and clarify the teaching of Kabbalah to the masses. This was because he saw that the evil inclination in people (human egoism) would rise to an altogether new height in this era of humanity, causing an altogether new era of internal suffering felt as a meaningless and confused existence.

===Writing of the &quot; Sulam &quot;===
In 1943, Ashlag moved to Tel Aviv, and there began working on his book, &quot;HaSulam&quot; (&quot;The Ladder&quot;), a collection of commentaries on &quot;The Zohar&quot;. During this period, he wrote for eighteen hours a day, and due to a lack of money he was not able to afford a sufficient amount of paper and ink to write more precise explanations. He later said that if it had been within his capabilities, he would have written a full commentary on &quot;The Zohar&quot; in two-hundred volumes, but he was unable to begin the work only because of a lack of means.

He completed this work in 1953, and later added three more volumes. Rav Ashlag&#x27;s closest student Rav Yehuda Tzvi Brandwein later finished the work by adding this three volumes called Tikkunei HaZohar &quot;Maalot Hasulam&quot;. In honor of the completion of the entire work, his students organized a big feast in Meron, where Ashlag gave the speech that is today printed under the title “Maamar LeSiyum HaZohar” (“An Article for the Completion of the Zohar,” also known as “Speech in Celebration for the Conclusion of the Zohar”). Yehuda Ashlag died on the day of Yom Kippur in 1954. He was buried on cemetery Har HaMenuchot located in Givat Shaul, Jerusalem, Israel.

===Rabbi Brandwein===
Rabbi Yehudah Tzvi Brandwein a direct descendant of the famous first Admor of Stretin, Rabbi Yehudah Tzvi of Stretin, was a foremost disciple of Rabbi Yehudah HaLevi Ashlag (Baal HaSulam). His vast knowledge of the Lurianic system of Kabbalah enabled him to codify and edit the entire writings of the Ari HaKadosh, Rabbi Yitzchak Luria. He continued with a similar style of translation and commentary of Rabbi Yehudah Ashlag known as Maalot HaSulam (Extension of the Ladder) on those works of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, which Rabbi Ashlag didn&#x27;t complete during his lifetime, namely Hashmatot HaZohar (Various other Writings) and Tikkunei HaZohar.

Rabbi Brandwein was one of the first Jewish settlers within the Old City of Jerusalem after the Six Day War.

Rabbi Yehuda Zvi Brandwein ran a religious school in Jerusalem called Yeshiva Kol Yehudah, founded in 1922 by Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag. For a while he also served as the chief rabbi for the Histadrut - the Israeli labor union, using his position to bring many secular Israelis back to Judaism.

==Books==
Ashlag wrote and published two major works. The first, &quot;Talmud Eser Sefirot&quot; is a complete re-editing and commentary to the works of 16th century Kabbalist Rabbi Isaac Luria. This is a comprehensive exposition of the system of the upper worlds, &quot;Partzufim&quot; and &quot;Sefirot&quot;, in the scientific language of Kabbalah which was developed by Luria.

As a core Kabbalistic text, it is especially unique in its utmost precision to detail to the structural organization and processes occurring in the upper worlds. It is set out as a comprehensive textbook, complete with commentaries, a section in each chapter dedicated to further reflection upon the commentaries, definitions of terms, tables of questions and answers, an introduction clarifying how to study Kabbalah in the correct manner, and also a summarized preface of the entire text.

His other masterwork was his &quot;Sulam commentary on The Zohar&quot;, which earned him the name “Baal HaSulam”. This monumental work took him ten years to complete, written between the years 1943 and 1953. It includes a translation of &quot;The Zohar&quot; from Aramaic to Hebrew as well as an extensive interpretation.

Another publication is the notebook of Yehuda Ashlag&#x27;s son and disciple, Baruch Ashlag. His notebook, entitled &quot;Shamati&quot; (&quot;I Heard&quot;]), contains over two hundred articles which were copied down from lessons and talks with his father. Baruch Ashlag kept this notebook with him in secret, until he was on his deathbed, in 1991. It was later published in Hebrew and has been translated into many different languages. The articles in &quot;Shamati&quot; form a unique kabbalistic work in their emotional depth of capturing the inner processes that a Kabbalist goes through on the path of spiritual attainment.

==Teachings==

Ashlag&#x27;s commentary offered a systematic interpretation of the legacy of Isaac Luria. This was the first since the 18th century when the Baal Shem Tov, Moshe Chaim Luzzatto, the Vilna Gaon and Shalom Sharabi offered their interpretation of Luria&#x27;s teaching. Ashlag&#x27;s system focused on the transformation of human consciousness from the &quot;desire to receive&quot; to the &quot;desire to give,&quot; i.e., from egocentricity to altruism. This path of transformation is described in Lurianic Kabbalah.

Ashlag stated that the purpose of studying Kabbalah is equal to the purpose of why human beings were created, and that through its study, a person is capable of revealing the entirety of processes and structures that have taken place in the creation of the universe.

&quot;Equivalence of form&quot; with this source means having the same attributes or qualities as it, and Ashlag defines the qualities of this source as being altruistic, namely the desire to give, or in Ashlag&#x27;s words, the &quot;will to bestow&quot; (&quot;Ratzon LeHashpia&quot;).

Through intensive study of Kabbalah, a person&#x27;s desire to give to others is developed in relation to this goal. Ashlag believed that the coming of the Messiah meant that humans would attain this quality which would allow them to give up their selfishness and devote themselves to loving each other for the sake of life&#x27;s purpose, as stated in the commandment &quot;love thy neighbor as thyself.&quot;

Ashlag had strong political opinions, believing in a religious version of anarcho-communism, based on principles of Kabbalah. Though his anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist ideas show some Marxist influence, he strongly opposed communism instituted by force and believed in &quot;developing a community based on love between its members and a society founded on economic justice.&quot; He supported the Kibbutz movement and preached to establish a network of self-ruled internationalist communes, who would eventually “annul the brute-force regime completely, for ‘every man did that which was right in his own eyes.’”, because “there is nothing more humiliating and degrading for a person than being under the brute-force government”.

The Or HaGanuz community of Northern Israel is based on the principles of Yehudah Ashlag, and is led by Rabbi Mordechai Sheinberger, a prominent contemporary teacher of Ashlag&#x27;s kabbalistic system.

<text>Stańczyk (c. 1480–1560) () was the most famous Polish court jester. He was employed by three Polish kings: Alexander, Sigismund the Old and Sigismund Augustus.

==Name, identity and historicity==

Scarcity of sources gave rise to four distinct hypotheses in the 19th century: that he was entirely invented by Jan Kochanowski and his colleagues; or that he was &quot;perhaps a typical jester dressed by his contemporaries in an Aesopian attire; or perhaps a Shakespearean vision of 19th century writers; or perhaps indeed a grey eminence of the &quot;societatis ioculatorum&quot;&quot;. In any measure, common consensus among modern scholars is that such a person indeed existed and even if he did not, he had a tremendous importance to Polish culture of later centuries, appearing in works of many artists of the 19th and 20th centuries.

Almost nothing is known about Stańczyk&#x27;s life and even his name and identity are a matter of dispute. Contemporary sources mention court jesters named Gąska and Stańczyk. Notably, both names are featured in two short poems by Jan Kochanowski. Both words are diminutives, of the words &quot;gęś&quot; (goose) and &quot;Stanisław&quot;, respectively, rather than proper names in their own right. All of the above led Aleksander Brückner and later scholars to believe that Gąska and Stańczyk are merely two nicknames of the same person. Because of that hypothesis Stańczyk is sometimes referred to as &quot;Stanisław Gąska&quot;, a name that resembles a typical Polish name, except it is of much later provenance and was coined in late 19th century rather than during the jester&#x27;s times.

By any measure Stańczyk&#x27;s fame and legend were already strong during his own time, the Renaissance. The popularity later reappeared in 19th century and remained well known to present times. Unlike jesters of other European courts, Stańczyk has been always considered to have been much more than a mere entertainer.

He is remembered as a man of great intelligence and a political philosopher gifted with formidable insight into Poland&#x27;s current and future situation. He used his job to criticize and warn his contemporaries by the use of satire. His witty jokes often pertained to current political or court matters. Stańczyk&#x27;s remarks and jokes were preserved by numerous contemporary writers and historians, including Łukasz Górnicki, Jan Kochanowski, Marcin Kromer, and Mikołaj Rej who praised him for fighting hypocrisy in the name of truth. Some sources even go as far as to call him a &quot;personal friend to Marcin Kromer, to the dislike of the bishops&quot;.

The best known anecdote about Stańczyk is that of a hunting incident. In 1533 King Sigismund the Old had a huge bear brought for him from Lithuania. The bear was released in the forest of Niepołomice near Kraków so that the king could hunt it. During the hunt, the animal charged at the king, the queen and their courtiers which caused panic and mayhem. Queen Bona fell from her horse which resulted in her miscarriage. Later, the king criticized Stańczyk for having run away instead of attacking the bear. The jester is said to have replied that &quot;it is a greater folly to let out a bear that was already in a cage&quot;. This remark is often interpreted as an allusion to the king&#x27;s policy toward Prussia which was defeated by Poland but not fully incorporated into the Crown.
== Stańczyk as a symbol ==
Stańczyk became a popular historical figure in Polish literature after the partitions (1795). Some writers treated him as a symbol of Poland&#x27;s struggle for independence, others provided him with rather Shakespearean traits. He appears in a work of, among others, Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz (in &quot;Jan z Tęczna. Powieść historyczna&quot;, 1825) and several works by Józef Ignacy Kraszewski (1839, 1841).

=== Teka Stańczyka ===
In 1869 a group of young conservative publicists: Józef Szujski, Stanisław Tarnowski, and , published a series of satirical pamphlets entitled (&quot;Stańczyk&#x27;s Portfolio&quot; or &quot;Stańczyk&#x27;s Files&quot;). Only five years after the tragic end of the January Uprising, the pamphlets ridiculed the idea of armed national uprisings and suggested a compromise with Poland&#x27;s enemies, especially the Austrian Empire, and more concentration on economic growth than on political independence. The political faction which adopted these ideas became known as &quot;Stańczycy&quot; (plural of &quot;Stańczyk&quot;).

=== Stańczyk in the arts ===
Stańczyk was also one of Jan Matejko&#x27;s favorite historical figures and he appears in a number of his paintings, such as in the &quot;Prussian Homage&quot;. Matejko, giving the jester his own facial features, created the popular image of Stańczyk that is familiar to most modern Poles. The painter always depicted Stańczyk with a very concerned and reflective look on his face, in stark contrast to his cap and bells and other jester&#x27;s gear. Matejko&#x27;s vision of Stańczyk influenced the way other artists, such as Leon Wyczółkowski, later depicted the jester.

The most notable appearance of Stańczyk in literature is in Stanisław Wyspiański&#x27;s play &quot;Wesele&quot; (&quot;The Wedding&quot;) where the jester&#x27;s ghost visits the Journalist, a character modeled after , editor of the Kraków-based paper &quot;Czas&quot; (&quot;Time&quot;), associated with the Stańczycy faction. In the play, Stańczyk accuses the Journalist, who calls the jester a &quot;great man&quot;, of inactivity and passive acceptance of the nation&#x27;s fate. At the end of their conversation, Stańczyk gives the Journalist his &quot;caduceus&quot; (the jester&#x27;s marotte) and tells him to &quot;stir the nation&quot; but not to &quot;tarnish the sacred things, for sacred they must remain&quot;. Thus Wyspiański reinforced Stańczyk&#x27;s role as a symbol of patriotism and skeptical political wisdom.

Stańczyk is also prominently featured in a 1908 painting entitled &quot;Reality&quot; by the Polish Symbolist painter Jacek Malczewski.

<text>The Silencers is the title of a 1962 spy novel by Donald Hamilton, the fourth in a series of books featuring assassin Matt Helm.

==Plot summary==

When a female agent in Mexico is killed before Helm can complete his mission to extract her, he finds himself teamed up with the woman&#x27;s sister as he fights to save the lives of a number of scientists and Congressmen.

==Film adaptation==
&quot;The Silencers&quot; has the distinction of being the first Matt Helm novel adapted as a film. The movie version was released in 1966 and starred Dean Martin as Helm. Rather than follow Hamilton&#x27;s storyline, the filmmakers took elements of the plot, combined it with elements of the first Helm book, &quot;Death of a Citizen&quot;, and cast the story in a comedic vein, spoofing the James Bond film franchise.

<text>The Ambushers is a novel by Donald Hamilton first published in 1963, continuing the exploits of assassin Matt Helm.

==Plot introduction==
Matt Helm conducts a by-the-book assassination in the (fictional) Central American nation of Costa Verde. Afterwards, he finds himself pursuing an ex-Nazi named von Sachs, who has obtained one of the nuclear missiles that had been bound for Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and who is threatening the United States with the weapon. Along the way he finds himself working with a Russian agent named Vadya (who would return in later Helm adventures).

==Film adaptation==
&quot;The Ambushers&quot; was very loosely adapted for the cinema in 1967 as the third film in a series starring Dean Martin as Matt Helm. Like the other Martin films, &quot;The Ambushers&quot; took only a few elements of Hamilton&#x27;s original story and recast the plot in the vein of an action comedy.

<doc id="1278609" wikidata="Q1229085" url="?curid=1278609" title="Gaspare Tagliacozzi">
<text>Gaspare Tagliacozzi (his last name has also been spelled Taliacotius, Tagliacoze or Tagliacozzio; Bologna, March 1545 – Bologna, 7 November 1599) was an Italian surgeon, pioneer of plastic and reconstructive surgery.

==Biography==
Tagliacozzi was born in Bologna.

Tagliacozzi began his medical studies in 1565. He studied at the University of Bologna under Gerolamo Cardano for medicine, Ulisse Aldrovandi for natural sciences and Julius Caesar Aranzi for anatomy. At the age of twenty-four, he earned his degree in philosophy and medicine.

==Career==
He was then appointed professor of surgery and later was appointed professor of anatomy. He taught at the Archiginnasio of Bologna. The amphitheater in which Tagliacozzi taught was severely damaged by American bombing during World War II. The theater was rebuilt and currently houses a wooden statue of Tagliacozzi. It is in this room that Tagliacozzi taught until 1595.

In 1568, two years before graduating, Tagliacozzi began practicing in the Hospital of Death, which was a sort of clinic for students since it was near the Archiginnasio. The hospital was run by a &quot;Brotherhood of Death&quot; whose job was to visit prisons and comfort those condemned to death. Through this brotherhood Tagliacozzi procured the bodies of executed prisoners for use in dissections. In his will, Tagliacozzi gave the responsibility of his burial to the brotherhood.

He improved on the work of the Sicilian Surgeon Gustavo Branca and his son Antonio (who lived in Catania in the 15th century) and developed the so-called &quot;Italian method&quot; of nasal reconstruction. His principal work is entitled &quot;De Curtorum Chirurgia per Insitionem &quot; (1597) (&quot;On the Surgery of Mutilation by Grafting&quot;). In this book, he described in great detail the procedures that had been carried out empirically by the Branca and Vianeo families of Sicily since the 15th century AD. The work has bestowed upon him the honor of being one of the first plastic surgeons and a quote from the book has become synonymous with plastic surgery. &quot;We restore, rebuild, and make whole those parts which nature hath given, but which fortune has taken away. Not so much that it may delight the eye, but that it might buoy up the spirit, and help the mind of the afflicted.&quot;

==Death and memorial service==

Tagliacozzi died in Bologna on 7 November 1599 and was buried in the church of the nuns of St. John the Baptist as he had ordered in his will. On the 26th of the same month a solemn mass was held in the same church in his honour which was attended by all doctors collegiate. During the ceremony Muzio Piacentini, a colleague of Tagliacozzi, gave the funeral oration, while some of the other participants recited rhymes of praise

==Brief history of the Italian method==

This operation for nasal reconstruction (rhinoplasty) was developed in Italy due to the popularity of duelling with rapier in the fifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The inventors of the method are believed to be surgeons Gustavo Branca and his son Antonio, who lived in Catania. Branca de Branca (the senior) used a skin flap from the cheek and years later, his son Antonio Branca used a flap raised from the arm. It has been suggested that reconstructive surgical methods described in the Sushruta Samhita, which was translated into Arabic in the 8th century, traveled further to Italy and was incorporated into the methods described by Branca. The technique was then taken up in Calabria during the sixteenth century by two brothers, surgeons Peter and Paul Boiano (also called Vianeo). This process was described by the great anatomist Andreas Vesalius (1514–1564) but, he wrongly advised using the muscle and the skin of the arm to reconstruct the nose. The Italian method was criticized by Gabriele Fallopio (1523–1562) as such a procedure could force the patient to remain with the arm immobilized for many months, and the result was not guaranteed as the skin would often detach. Tagliacozzi probably knew the method of Boiano through the description of Leonardo Fioravanti. Tagliacozzi&#x27;s method was practiced by Fortunio Liceti, who mentions it in his &quot;De monstruorum nature causis et differentiis&quot; of 1616; by Henricus Moinichen in &quot;Observationes Medical chirurgicae&quot; of 1691; and by Thomas Feyens, surgeon to the University of Louvain, who had studied in Bologna with Tagliacozzi, in his work &quot;De praecipuis Artis Chirurgicae controversiis&quot; which was published posthumously in 1669. Use of this surgical innovation declined during the seventeenth century throughout Europe and the method of Tagliacozzi was actually forgotten, until it was rediscovered and applied in 1800 by the German surgeon Karl Ferdinand von Graefe, whereupon it was used right up to the early twentieth century.

<text>Crusade in Jeans (1973) is a children&#x27;s novel written by Thea Beckman. It contains a fictional account of the Children&#x27;s Crusade of 1212, as witnessed by Rudolf Hefting, a boy from the 20th century. The original Dutch title is Kruistocht in spijkerbroek. A film version was released in 2006.

==Plot summary==
Rudolf &quot;Dolf&quot; Wega is a fifteen-year-old who volunteers for an experiment with a time machine. The experiment goes well, but accidentally Dolf is stranded in the 13th century. He saves the life of Leonardo Fibonacci da Pisa, without realizing who he is, and teaches him Arabic numerals. Together they join the German Children&#x27;s Crusade, and through his modern-day knowledge, Rudolf manages to save a lot of children from horrible fates. However, his knowledge also leads to accusations of witchcraft.

In the book, two slavers delude a group of children into coming with them with stories of how the innocent shall liberate Jerusalem. Their actual intent is to sell them as slaves for profit. With the aid of his twentieth-century knowledge and skepticism, and the aid of a &quot;magical&quot; device or two (such as a box of matches), the boy manages to keep most of the children alive and eventually gets them to safety.

==Characters==
;Dolf: Born in Amstelveen, his full name is Rudolf Hefting, and at the age of 15 becomes the active leader of the crusade.

;Leonardo: Born in Pisa, his full name is Leonardo Fibonacci. He is a very intelligent young man and one of the few historical characters in the book. The historical Fibonacci is often considered one of the greatest mathematicians in the Middle Ages.

;Marie: She is eleven years old, as stated by Leonardo. She is a parentless beggar with a very sensitive nature, and, during the crusade, both Dolf and Leonardo grow very fond of her.

;Frank: The twelve-year-old son of a tanner from Cologne.

;Peter: A strong child around the age of twelve, who, in the Crusade, became responsible for fisheries. After the tragedy in Genoa, his personality became colder.

;Hans: His knowledge of the trees seems unlimited, as his father was a woodcutter.

;Bertho: A tall and strong boy who felt a strong sense of guilt about his past.

;Everard: One of the main hunters, along with Carolus and Bertho. In his life he has seen nothing but forests and hunting parties. He dies bravely in a fight between the farmers of Lombardy.

;Dom Thaddeus: A priest from a neighboring village in the city where Dolf was lost who joined the Crusade.

;Dom Anselmus and Dom Augustus: Impostors pretending to be monks, and who, under the orders of Boglio, a contact of Anselmus, attempt to sell the children to a slave&#x27;s market, but fail to do so.

;Nicolas: A young shepherd who, deceived by the fake monks, believed to God&#x27;s chosen one to lead the Children&#x27;s Crusade.

;Carolus: Young nobleman who believes he will be crowned king on his arrival in Jerusalem, but unexpectedly dies, before the arrival in Genoa, from appendicitis - a disease which at that time was fatal. His death was a strong blow on Dolf, who cared for him very much.

;Fredo: A robust boy and son of an impoverished knight, he left the crusade before they crossed the alps along with another 800 followers.

;Hilda: Hilda von Marburg, daughter of a count, grew up in the palace of her uncle (the archbishop of Cologne), and the supposed &quot;future queen of Jerusalem&quot;. During the Crusade, she became in charge of nursing.

;Frieda: The daughter of a servant, with much knowledge on berries, herbs and root vegetables.

;Gardulf: A baker. With his help, the help of two assistants Frank and Dolf, they made 200 fringes of bread in one night and prevented the children from starving.

;Wilhelm: A chubby boy always willing to help Dolf.

==Awards and nominations==
The book won a Gouden Griffel and the European prize for best historical youth book in 1974, and the Prix de la Divulgation historique in 1976. In 2019 it was selected as the classic in that year&#x27;s &quot;gift a book&quot; campaign, which made it available in paperback for €2,50.

==Film, TV or theatrical adaptations==
A movie version directed by Ben Sombogaart went into production in 2005. The film was released in Belgium and the Netherlands on November 15, 2006. It was shown at the Berlin International Film Festival in February 2007, and was released in other regions, in theatres or on DVD between 2008 and 2010.

<text>Wave loading is most commonly the application of a pulsed or wavelike load to a material or object. This is most commonly used in the analysis of piping, ships, or building structures which experience wind, water, or seismic disturbances.

==Examples of wave loading==
* Offshore storms and pipes: As large waves pass over shallowly buried pipes, water pressure increases above it. As the trough approaches, pressure over the pipe drops and this sudden and repeated variation in pressure can break pipes. The difference in pressure for a wave with wave height of about 10 m would be equivalent to one atmosphere (101.3 kPa or 14.7 psi) pressure variation between crest and trough and repeated fluctuations over pipes in relatively shallow environments could set up resonance vibrations within pipes or structures and cause problems.
* Engineering oil platforms: The effects of wave-loading are a serious issue for engineers designing oil platforms, which must contend with the effects of wave loading, and have devised a number of algorithms to do so.

<doc id="1278635" wikidata="Q252265" url="?curid=1278635" title="Theodor Grotthuss">
<text>Freiherr Christian Johann Dietrich Theodor von Grotthuss (20 January 1785 – 26 March 1822) was a Baltic German scientist known for establishing the first theory of electrolysis in 1806 and formulating the first law of photochemistry in 1817. His theory of electrolysis is considered the first description of the so-called Grotthuss mechanism.

==Life and work==

Grotthuss was born in 1785 in Leipzig, Electorate of Saxony, Holy Roman Empire, during an extended stay of his parents away from their home in northern Grand Duchy of Lithuania. He showed interest in natural sciences and went to study first in Leipzig and later in Paris at the École Polytechnique. Several renowned scientists taught at the École Polytechnique at that time, including Antoine François, comte de Fourcroy, Claude Louis Berthollet and Louis Nicolas Vauquelin.

Because of some tensions in the relations between Russia and France, Grotthuss had to leave for Italy where he stayed at Naples for one year. The discovery of the first electric cell in 1800 by Alessandro Volta provided the scientists a source of electricity which was used in various laboratory experiments around Europe. The electrolysis of water, acids and salt solutions was reported, but a good explanation was missing. Grotthuss actively contributed to this area both in terms of electrolysis experiments and their interpretation. During his stay in Italy, he published his work on electrolysis in 1806. His idea that the charge is not transported by the movement of particles but by breaking and reformation of bonds was the first basically correct concept for the charge transport in electrolytes; it is still valid for the charge transport in water, and the current proton hopping mechanism is a modified version of the original Grotthuss mechanism.

The following two years Grotthuss spent in Rome, some other Italian cities, and Paris, and then went back to Russia via Munich and Vienna. From 1808 on he lived at the estate of his mother in northern Lithuania. There he conducted research on electricity and light with the limited research equipment he could assemble. Grotthuss committed suicide in the spring of 1822 during a depression caused by health problems.

<doc id="1278640" wikidata="Q6287238" url="?curid=1278640" title="Joseph Sturge">
<text>Joseph Sturge (2 August 1793 – 14 May 1859) was an English Quaker, abolitionist and activist. He founded the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society (now Anti-Slavery International). He worked throughout his life in Radical political actions supporting pacifism, working-class rights, and the universal emancipation of slaves. In the late 1830s, he published two books about the apprenticeship system in Jamaica, which helped persuade the British Parliament to adopt an earlier full emancipation date. In Jamaica, Sturge also helped found Free Villages with the Baptists, to provide living quarters for freed slaves; one was named Sturge Town in his memory.

==Early life==
Born on 2 August 1793, Joseph Sturge was the fourth child in the family of 12 of Joseph Sturge, a farmer in Elberton, Gloucestershire, and his wife Mary Marshall, who belonged to the Religious Society of Friends (commonly known as Quakers). His brothers included John Sturge, who became a manufacturer in Birmingham, and Edmund Sturge. The abolitionist and pacifist Sophia Sturge (1795–1845) was his sister, and Charles Gilpin was a nephew.

After a year at school in Thornbury, Sturge boarded for three years at the Quaker Sidcot School. He then farmed with his father, and on his own account. Of pacifist views, he refused in 1813 to serve in the militia.

Failing at first to earn a living as a corn factor, at Bewdley from 1814, Sturge moved to Birmingham in 1822. There he became an importer of grain. Successful in business, with his brother Charles, he built up the company. The Sturges as a family became investors in railways and docks. Joseph from 1831 ceased to be an active partner, leaving operations to Charles, and concentrated on causes and public life. As an abolitionist, he was allied in 1831 with George Stephen in pressing Parliament for immediate legislation against slavery. The Reform Act 1832, in his view, failed to address poverty, and he worked for radical electoral reform.

Sturge was appointed an alderman in 1835. He opposed the building of the Birmingham Town Hall, to be used for performances, because of a conscientious objection to religious oratorios. He became interested in the island of Jamaica and the conditions of its enslaved workers. He visited it several times and witnessed firsthand the horrors of slavery, as well as the abuses under an apprenticeship system designed to control the labour of all former slaves above the age of six for 12 years. He worked for emancipation and abolition with African-Caribbean and English Baptists.

In 1838, after full emancipation was authorised, Sturge laid the foundation stone to the &quot;Emancipation School Rooms&quot; in Birmingham. Attending were United Baptist Sunday School and Baptist ministers of the city. In 1839 his work was honoured by a marble monument in a Baptist mission chapel in Falmouth, Jamaica. It was dedicated to &quot;the Emancipated Sons of Africa&quot;.

==Campaign against apprenticeship==
After legislation for the abolition of slavery in the British dominions was enacted in 1833, slave-owning planters in the West Indies lobbied to postpone freedom for adults for twelve years in a form of indenture. Enslaved children under the age of six were emancipated by the new law on 1 August 1834, but older children and adults had to serve a period of bonded labour or &quot;apprenticeship&quot;. Sturge led a campaign against this delaying mechanism. He was supported by William Allen, Lord Brougham, and others. In a speech to the House of Lords, Brougham acknowledged Sturge&#x27;s central role at that time in rousing British anti-slavery opinion.

In 1834 Sturge sailed to the West Indies to study apprenticeship as defined by the Slavery Abolition Act 1833. He intended to open it to criticism as an intermediate stage &quot;en route&quot; to emancipation. He travelled throughout the West Indies and talked directly to apprentices, proprietors (planters), and others directly involved. Upon his return to Great Britain, he published &quot;Narrative of Events since the First of August 1834.&quot; In it he cited an African-Caribbean witness, to whom he referred as &quot;James Williams&quot; to protect him from reprisals.

The original statement was signed by two free African-Caribbeans and six apprentices, and was authenticated by an English Baptist minister Thomas Price of Hackney, who wrote the introduction. Following another trip and further study, Sturge published &quot;The West Indies in 1837&quot;. Both books highlighted the cruelty and injustice of the system of indentured apprenticeship. They reported on the abuse of apprentices, and the way the treadmill was used in prisons, and by 1840 changes had been made.

While in Jamaica, Sturge worked with the Baptist chapels to found Free Villages, to create homes for freed slaves when they achieved full emancipation. They planned the communities to be outside the control of planters.

He bought two plantations on the Caribbean island of Montserrat, Olveston, and Elberton to demonstrate that slavery was unnecessary.

As a result of Sturge&#x27;s single-minded campaign, in which he publicised details of the brutality of apprenticeship to shame the British Government, a major row broke out amongst abolitionists. The more radical element were pitted against the government. Although both had the same ends in sight, Sturge and the Baptists, with mainly Nonconformist support, led a successful popular movement for immediate and full emancipation. As a consequence, the British Government moved the date for full emancipation forward to 1 August 1838. They abolished the 12-year intermediary apprenticeship scheme. For many English Nonconformists and African-Caribbean people, 1 August 1838, became recognised as the true date of abolition of slavery in the British Empire.

==International anti-slavery campaign==

In 1837, keen to act independently of the consensus in the Anti-Slavery Society, Sturge founded the Central Negro Emancipation Committee. More significantly, in 1839, one year after abolition in the British dominions, Sturge led a small group who founded the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society to put an end to slavery worldwide. It continues today as Anti-Slavery International.

The Society&#x27;s first major activity was to organise the World&#x27;s Anti-Slavery Convention. It was held at the Freemasons&#x27; Hall, London, from 12 June 1840. Others were held in 1843 (Brussels) and 1849 (Paris). It attracted delegates from Europe, North America, South Africa and Caribbean countries, as well as the British dominions of Australia and Ireland. It included African-Caribbean delegates from Haiti and Jamaica (then representing Britain), women activists from the United States, and many Nonconformists.

In 1841 Sturge travelled in the United States with the poet John Greenleaf Whittier to examine the slavery question there. On his return he published &quot;A Visit to the United States in 1841&quot; (1842). On the same visit (22 May), he saw William Jay who was interested in forwarding the peace agenda, by international arbitration.

==The 1843 London Peace Congress==
The Peace Congress of June 1843 held in London resulted from proposal made by Sturge to the American Peace Society in 1841, intended to propagate the ideas of William Jay. A preliminary meeting was held in London in 1842, and the decision was taken that the Peace Congress should follow directly on from the second Anti-Slavery Convention. Sturge ended up organising both, after the death of Nun Morgan Harry (1800–1842). The Peace Congress took place 22–24 June 1843, and formally was the responsibility of the London Peace Society.

The resolution of the Congress mentioned Jay&#x27;s ideas positively, but laid more weight on those of William Ladd, who had died in 1841, proposing international institutions to keep the peace.

==Politics and Chartism==
Sturge was critical of the role of William Scholefield, the Mayor of Birmingham, in the suppression of a chartist meeting in the Bull Ring, Birmingham. Schofield had arrived with 60 officers of the newly formed Metropolitan Police, on 4 July 1839. After Schofield read the Riot Act, Sturge held the police were responsible for the escalation of violence that led to the Bull Ring Riots, 1838.

In addition to his other commitments, Sturge joined the Anti-Corn Law League early in its existence. During 1842 he began a campaign for &quot;complete suffrage&quot;, and had the support of the Christian Chartist pastor Arthur George O&#x27;Neill in Birmingham. His movement was based squarely on the middle classes. He envisaged a platform that could unite the League and the Chartist movement. The League would have nothing to do with it. Sturge had a measure of further Chartist and nonconformist support, but by the end of the year the Chartist leaders William Lovett and Feargus O&#x27;Connor had swung against him. O&#x27;Connor had supported Sturge&#x27;s Complete Suffrage Union earlier in the year, before the industrial conflicts of the Plug Riots had hardened his attitude and he began to see Sturge&#x27;s broadly middle class support as a threat to his leadership position.

Following a dispute over redrafting the People&#x27;s Charter as a legislative bill, in December 1842 with William Sharman Crawford MP, Sturge walked out of a joint CSU-Chartist delegate conference in Birmingham. Crawford introduced their reform bill to &quot;a small and bored House&quot; in May 1843. The bill was lost by 101 to 32.

In the years 1842–7 Sturge ran three times for Parliament, on his &quot;complete suffrage&quot; platform, without success. In August 1842 he was parliamentary candidate for Nottingham, in a by-election. He was defeated by John Walter, the proprietor of &quot;The Times&quot;. In Nottingham he visited a Sunday School run by Samuel Fox. The idea of teaching not only scripture, but also basic skills such as reading and writing, was taken up by Sturge, who opened a similar school around 1845. In that year he started an Adult School movement, in Birmingham, and took steps in 1847 to spread Sunday (First-Day) Schools among Quakers.

Sturge then contested Birmingham in 1844 as a Chartist candidate, in a by-election caused by the death of Joshua Scholefield. He was strongly supported at the election hustings, split the liberal vote, but ultimately came bottom of the poll: Richard Spooner [Cons] 2095, William Scholefield [Lib] 1735 and Sturge [Chartist] 346. In 1847 he stood once more, for Leeds, in the general election. There he was identified as &quot;Bainesite&quot; — a follower of Edward Baines — and was campaigning for schooling, with no state involvement, a divisive position in the British and Foreign School Society.

==Later life==
Sturge took up the cause of peace and arbitration being pioneered by Henry Richard. He was instrumental in the founding of the &quot;Morning Star&quot; in 1855 as a newspaper through which to promote the Peace Society and his other social ideas.

In 1854 Sturge and two other Quakers, Robert Charleton and Henry Pease, travelled to Saint Petersburg to see Tzar Nicholas I, trying to prevent the outbreak of the Crimean War. In 1856 Sturge and Thomas Harvey visited the Grand Duchy of Finland to investigate the damage caused by the Royal Navy and French Navy gunboats, in attacks during the Crimean War. On this trip Sturge bought Robert Wilhelm Ekman&#x27;s painting &quot;Sunday Morning in a Farmhouse&quot;, which was shown in the exhibition of the Royal Academy of Arts in 1858. The painting was brought back to Finland in 1960.

==Personal life==
Sturge married, first, in 1834, Eliza Cropper, sister of John Cropper. After her death, in 1846 he married Hannah Dickinson, daughter of Barnard Dickinson and his wife Ann Darby, who was granddaughter of Abraham Darby III; and they had five children, one being the peace campaigner Sophia Sturge (1849–1936). Fellow Quaker Stephen Henry Hobhouse wrote a biography in 1919 titled &quot;Joseph Sturge, his life and work&quot;. Joseph Sturge was a cousin of whaling shipowner, industrialist and philanthropist Thomas Sturge.

==Death and memorial==
Sturge died suddenly at his home on Wheeley&#x27;s Road, in Edgbaston, Birmingham, on 14 May 1859 of heart disease. He was buried in the graveyard at the Friends Meeting House, in Birmingham, England. Rather than a grand public funeral, the family sought a modest event in keeping with their Quaker beliefs; but the mourning procession from the late Sturge&#x27;s home included forty carriages of friends and family, led by the mayor, Sir John Ratcliff.

The Joseph Sturge memorial by sculptor John Thomas was unveiled on 4 June 1862 at Five Ways.
 On 24 March 2007, the city held a civic ceremony to formally rededicate the statue. Randal Brew, the Lord Mayor of Birmingham, unveiled an interpretation board giving details of Sturge&#x27;s life. On the same day, a blue plaque (historic marker) was unveiled at the site of his home in Wheeleys Road, Edgbaston.

<text>Sara Magdalene Pezzini is a fictional superheroine starring in the &quot;Witchblade&quot; series. Sara also appeared in a Turner Network Television live-action feature film and TV series of the same name and she was portrayed by Yancy Butler. She is an NYPD homicide detective whose life changed when she came into contact with a powerful ancient weapon known as the Witchblade, which bestows its wielder with supernatural powers.

==Fictional biography==
Sara Magdalene Pezzini was born November 18, 1970, and is of Italian descent. Her major enemies are Kenneth Irons and Ian Nottingham.

As one of the current hosts of the Witchblade, Sara has been granted many unique abilities, including the power and ability to heal herself, to create (often very revealing) armor over her skin (as the Witchblade tends to rip away all of her clothes), to shoot energy blasts, to extend razor sharp tendrils and even winged flight. She has yet to explore the full limits of the Witchblade, and thus does not know what other mystical magical abilities it possesses. When not overly active, the Witchblade can assume the form of a bracelet, allowing her to wear the entity without drawing attention. The Witchblade is a male entity of both light and dark which represents both order and chaos. It is the offspring of the Angelus and the Darkness; as such, Sara does not have complete control over its actions and reactions.

Sara first appeared in &quot;Cyblade/Shi: The Battle for Independents&quot; #1 (January 1995). She had wanted nothing more in her life than to be a good cop. As a homicide detective in New York City, life was challenging enough, but for Sara, those were simpler times. While on an undercover case at the Rialto Theater, both she and her partner, Michael Yee (named Danny Woo in the TV series), were mortally wounded. At this same theater was a man named Kenneth Irons, who had brought a gauntlet known as the Witchblade. Irons was in search of the secrets to unlocking his full power and ability.

While Sara lay dying, the Witchblade made his choice to include her in the long line of women that he has shared his power with. The entity healed Sara&#x27;s wounds and allowed her to survive the resulting confrontation. Since then, she has seen many things she never knew existed, fought creatures that have no place on Earth, and longed for the days of a typical NYPD detective. But she continues her struggle with the Witchblade, believing that she can do more good with the entity than without. So the battle for control continues, as Sara learns more about this entity and struggles to stem his violent nature.

Some of Sara&#x27;s allies include the Magdalena, Lara Croft, Vampirella, and Jackie Estacado. Two crossovers pitted her against Wolverine and the titular creatures from the &quot;Alien&quot; and &quot;Predator&quot; franchises. In the comics recently, Sara has been through a grueling ordeal fighting off a giant demon (a false &quot;god&quot; summoned by a group of priests), in the midst of which her partner, Jake McCarthy, was left wounded. Before losing consciousness, Jake professed his love for Sara and told her that he always knew about her double life. He now remains in a coma, and Sara has had to deal with a nosy new partner, Patrick Gleason, who has already discovered many of her secrets. Gleason saved her life and it had begun to look like they may become more than just partners, but their sexual date was interrupted when Ian Nottingham abruptly returned to Sara&#x27;s life.

After a minor crisis that led to the death of Sara&#x27;s good friend and loyal partner, Jake, Sara discovered she was pregnant. Sara was completely confounded at how this occurred – due primarily to the fact she has not had sex in over a year. Sara, initially feeling she was not ready to be a mother, nevertheless decided to keep the baby, but decided as a result she could not keep the Witchblade as well. Sara relinquished it on to Danielle Baptiste, a young woman she had recently met who was its next chosen bearer.

When she was due to give birth, the father of her child was revealed – it was Jackie Estacado, who, possessed by the Darkness itself, was driven to seek out and have sex with Sara&#x27;s comatose body, and, with Jackie&#x27;s body used for the necessary biology, leading to the conception of their baby – a child to upset the balance between the dark and light. Sara gives birth to a baby girl, but is on the verge of death. Danielle then ends up sharing part of the Witchblade with Sara, which saves Sara&#x27;s life. Hope, Sara and Jackie&#x27;s daughter, drives off the Angelus and in the end Sara, now wielding half the Witchblade, and her friends return to their lives. This pregnancy has caused an attraction between Jackie and Sara that has manifested itself as romantic and even sexual.

Later, a major conflict erupts between Sara and Danielle, with Sara under the control of the Darkness portion of the Witchblade. During this time Sara became increasingly irrational, angry and would often mistreat the people around her, but she did display more increased control over the entity demonstrating abilities usually associated with the Darkness (summoning dark-based objects, creating Darklings etc.). Manipulated by an old enemy of the Curator, Sara re-took all of the Witchblade in a battle with Danielle. Sara was saved when Danielle was chosen as the next Angelus host and cleansed her of the Darkness&#x27; influence, restoring Sara to her former self.

While Sara attempts to redeem herself for her crimes under the Darkness-half of the Witchblade, an Internal Affairs agent named Phipps discovered the truth about the Witchblade through Jake McCarthy&#x27;s diary. He confronted Sara, demanding that she either resign as a detective or give up the Witchblade if she doesn&#x27;t want to be exposed. Sara chose the former. She then moves to Chicago, working as a private investigator.

&quot;Witchblade&quot; ended in issue #185, marking the end of Sara&#x27;s story as wielder of the Witchblade and her goal to find a suitable successor. Sara later appeared in the relaunch of &quot;The Darkness&quot; in a supporting role.

==Powers and abilities==
As a police detective, Sara has undergone basic training and remains in exceptional physical shape. She is likewise a skilled hand-to-hand combatant and markswoman, able to hold her own in a gunfight as well as against physical opponents noticeably larger and stronger than herself. Sara has also showcased considerable skill as an investigative detective. She&#x27;s usually adept at spotting small details and piecing together evidence. Since coming into contact with the mystical, she&#x27;s had to hone her detective skill to compensate with varying degrees of success.

As the host of the Witchblade, she was granted a vast array of supernatural abilities, such as; forming various weapons (swords, other stabbing weapons, hooks, chains, shields), jump to heights higher than most humans could jump to, generate a full body armor in order to protect herself, increase her strength to abnormal levels that exceed 500 pounds (should the situation arise, she can also form wings allowing flight), shoot energy blasts from the gauntlet, fire projectile darts, and whip-like grapples to attack or to climb. The Witchblade is also an excellent lock pick, and can heal wounds, even near-fatal ones. The Witchblade can re-animate the dead, empathically show the host scenes of great trauma, and allow the host to relive experiences from past hosts as dreams.

The Witchblade is also known to be able to damage incorporeal beings and is capable of slaying other-dimensional entities and immortal deities (such as Bastet). It also has the ability to control and manipulate the elements. The Witchblade can slow, stop, and even turn back time.

==In other media==
In the &quot;Witchblade&quot; television series, Sara is also able to use the Witchblade for both defence and offence: For defence, the Witchblade envelops Sara in armour, reminiscent of a Medieval Knight (as opposed to the very revealing armour from the graphic novels). For offence, the witchblade can assume the form of a gauntlet, with a wrist-mounted retractable blade, and, one-step forward, even as a Pata-esq weapon. It can also serve as a Brass knuckles-esq weapon for punching. In certain instances it seems to slow, stop, or even turn back time (or at least Sara&#x27;s perception of time allowing her to see and dodge bullets, etc.); however, due to the time-turning ability, things said about the series are often only true for one season or the other. She also has the ability to see and speak with the ghost of Det. Danny Woo, her dead partner, and others dead before their time, murdered victims, etc.

According to former wielder, Joan of Arc, during the , when Sara asks her what the Witchblade is, she answers that it is a branch from the Tree of good and evil; in another episode, it is described as the product of divine alchemy. Flashbacks also show it first falling to the earth as a meteor before ending-up in human hands. Over the course of human history/time immemorial, the Witchblade has crossed hands, crossed countries, continents and cultures; but has only ever been wielded by women. There is a specific female bloodline that the Witchblade favours for its wielders (which Sara Pezzini is a part of), who are both descendants and reincarnations of a previous wielder, as the Witchblade has directly influenced the course of this bloodline: whenever the Witchblade passes into the hands of a worthy wielder, it will subject her to the Periculum, a test designed to find if one is worthy of carrying such an amazing weapon, she is brought to the brink of death, and is confronted by former wielders, who will question her. Once a potential user has passed this test, the Witchblade will bond with them at a cellular level and slow the aging process.

It was also revealed in the last episode of the series that the Witchblade will not and cannot bring death to anyone that has wielded it, able to only maim, disfigure and cause pain. The Witchblade&#x27;s symbol is two circles overlapping one-another, representing the light and dark aspects of the Witchblade, as it is a proponent for balance between these two forces in the world.

Former wielders of the Witchblade include Saren (a fictional Artemis-esq wood nymph goddess of Sumerian religion, and who was the uninterested object of Gilgamesh&#x27;s unrequited lust, and was hunted by Enkidu), Cathain (based on Scáthach of Irish &amp; Scottish legend, and lover of Conchobar), Joan of Arc, Florence Nightingale (although she was not of the wielder&#x27;s bloodline), and Elizabeth Brontë (an American spy in WWII), along with unidentified Egyptian, Babylonian, Indian, Chinese, Japanese and Celtic woman (all with the same face as Sara Pezzini) throughout human history.

It is revealed that Sara was not only adopted, but stolen from her birth mother when she was a baby she also had a sister that appeared in the series once, named Karen Bronte. It is hinted that her real last name is Bronte. Elizabeth&#x27;s descendant Sara is in fact the same woman as all of the &quot;true wielders&quot; of the Witchblade, living in different times and places simultaneously (since time is an illusion) and sometimes even meeting the same people like Conchobar, who in another time and place was her lover.

Sara&#x27;s main romantic interest in the TV series is Conchobar, a musician who is a descendant or reincarnation of Conchobar mac Nessa.

Sara finds herself trying to figure out the origins of the weapon she now carries, as well as the purpose that is destined for her. Her nemesis is businessman Kenneth Irons, whose bodyguard Ian Nottingham is implied to be his son. In the television series, it turns out that while Ian, via Kenneth&#x27;s experiments, is also related to Sara, Ian was created from the stem cell of Elizabeth Brontë, a former wielder from Sara&#x27;s bloodline (possibly her biological grandmother) and it is implied that they could be genetically related. Ian is obsessed with Sara, but his erratic behavior disturbs her. In the second season, he meets Aras, a woman genetically identical to Sara (a biological cousin of hers from about five generations back), and they share a kiss. Sara has a friend named Gabriel Bowman who has a website called Talismaniac and is knowledgeable about mythology and artifacts.

<doc id="1278655" wikidata="Q1751952" url="?curid=1278655" title="Hetmans of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth">
<text>Hetmans of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth () were the highest-ranking military officers, second only to the King, in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The first Polish title of Grand Crown Hetman was created in 1505. The title of hetman was given to the leader of the Polish Army and until 1581 it was awarded only for a specific campaign or war. Later it became a permanent title, as did all the titles in the Kingdom of Poland and Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. It could not be revoked unless treachery had been proven (from 1585). Hetmans were not paid for their services by the Royal Treasury.

==Field and Great Hetmans==
From the end of 16th century there were two hetmans in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and two hetmans in the Crown: a Field Hetman and a Great Hetman (sometimes translated as Grand Hetman). As a result, there were in total four hetman titles: Great Crown Hetman, Field Crown Hetman, Great Lithuanian Hetman and Field Lithuanian Hetman. During joint military operations of the Crown and Grand Duchy of Lithuania armies, the Grand Crown Hetman usually was considered superior to others hetmans and served as commander-in-chief if the war actions ran along the borders of the Grand Duchy and vice versa.

Grand Hetmans were usually in command of the professional and mobilised army and during peace stayed at the capital involving themselves in politics, guarding the interests of the army and planning campaigns.

Polish Field Hetman was subordinates of Grand Hetman and when on the same battlefield commanded the mercenaries and artillery. During peace they usually were deployed on the eastern and southern borders of the Commonwealth, and commanded all local forces against constant skirmishes and small invasions of the Ottoman Empire and its vassals. Field Hetman were also called Frontier Hetman, since they did the same job as commanders of frontier garrisons before the title of hetman was introduced.

Lithuanian Field Hetman initially was called Court Hetman and commanded the guard of the Grand Duke, while Land Hetman commanded militia. Later this difference disappeared and they were renamed Field and Great Hetmans accordingly. Contrary to Polish practice Lithuanian Field Hetman had full control on army under his command and wasn&#x27;t subordinated to the Great Hetman.

For a short period there was also an office of Royal Court Hetman, but it never gained much influence.

==Responsibilities and privileges==
Hetman&#x27;s competences and privileges, first officially described in 1527 in the act of nomination for Jan Tarnowski included:
* planning and carrying out of military campaigns
* enlistment and organisation of professional army (wojsko kwarciane) and mercenaries
* supervision of registered Cossacks and atamans, who were chosen by hetmans for two-year terms
* nomination and promotion of officers at will
* choosing locations where the army units were to draw supplies from (that could become a severe burden of cities/nobles that were disliked by a hetman)
* supervising the flow of the army&#x27;s finances (including the soldiers&#x27; wages)
* full control over military judiciary (with capital punishment during wars), they could also issue laws and regulations for the army (known as hetman&#x27;s articles)
* hearing complaints of all civilian personnel against the army and issuing compensation
* hetmans had certain competencies in foreign policy, they could send their own emissaries to countries such as the Ottoman Empire, Moldavia, Crimean Khanate and Wallachia. It was reasoned that the distance to capital was too large and situation in that regions was always too volatile for all decisions to be made in the capital (Kraków, later Warsaw)

The hetman had no right to order the forces of the royal court, the royal guard, units equipped by the cities and towns, or private individuals, although during wars those units often voluntarily pledged their obedience to hetmans. Hetmans had no control over the navy, although the Polish Navy was always of very limited importance. Hetmans usually had no direct control over the levy (pospolite ruszenie), but they could give orders to the regimentars who commanded it.

While hetmans were considered to be among the highest-ranking officials in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, their hetman status gave them no right to sit in either the Senate or Sejm, unless they held another office that automatically carried with it a seat or were elected as a representatives of local szlachta during sejmiks. Each hetman received a hetman&#x27;s ceremonial mace, the bulawa, as the symbol of his position (it was added to his coat of arms). Less common was a horse-tail ensign and hetman&#x27;s sign.

In some of the never realised plans of reconstruction of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth from dual into triple state (Polish–Lithuanian–Ruthenian Commonwealth), the hetman was to be a head of the Ruthenian part, consisting of three Ukrainian voivodeships (see Treaty of Hadiach).

The reforms of 1776, stimulated by the first Partition of Poland, limited the powers of the hetmans.

==Hetman&#x27;s aides==
A hetman&#x27;s chief aides and officers included:
* &quot;pisarz polny&quot; – field chancellor, responsible for the archives, chancery, finances, accounting of people, equipment and fortifications, and paying soldiers&#x27; wages
* &quot;straznik&quot; – guardian; security; supervised the scout forces during movement and camping and commanded the front guard (however, if both hetmans were present, the Field Hetman acted as Great Guardian (Polish: Wielki Straznik)).
* &quot;obozny&quot; – camp leader; camp and transport organisation; responsible for choosing a suitable camping place for an army, setting up the camp, logistics and security inside the encampment.
* &quot;szpitalny&quot; – medic; medical services
* &quot;profos&quot; – military juridiciary
* &quot;brabanmajster&quot; – logistics
* &quot;regimentarz&quot; – second-in-command in the event a hetman was killed or taken prisoner; the &quot;regimantrz&quot; could also be chosen by the king for a given period when a hetman was not available, or informally assumed this function of the commander-in-chief when no hetman or monarch was present nearby (for example, the commander of a &quot;levee en masse&quot; was usually called a &quot;regimentarz&quot;.

Most of those aides also had a Field/Great and Crown/Lithuanian add-ons to their titles, depending on which hetman they were serving under.

Several new military titles were created after the 1635 by king Władysław IV Vasa, changing some of hetman&#x27;s responsibilities:
*1637 – General of Artillery (responsible for artillery forces, their logistics and such)
*1670s – General of Logistics, General of Medics, General of Finances
*The Generals of Inspections controlled the combat readiness of troops, however it is unclear when they were created (besides the phrase ‘in 17th century’).

<text>The Mediumwave transmitter Lopik was a medium wave broadcasting facility near Lopik in the Netherlands. It was constructed in and destroyed on . Its last use was to transmit the Dutch language edition of Radio Maria on 675 kHz. The aerial consisted of a guyed steel framework mast, which was insulated against ground.

On 24 July 2015, Radio Maria Netherlands announced the closedown of its transmissions on 675 kHz Medium wave as of 1 September 2015.

Originally, there was also a second, 165 metre (541&#x27;) guyed steel framework mast for the mediumwave frequency 1332 kHz, but this was taken down on 21 August 2004.

On 4 September 2015, the remaining 196 metre (643&#x27;) mast was also taken down, marking the end of 75 years of Medium wave transmissions from the Lopik site.

This mast should not be confused with the Gerbrandy tower in the nearby town of IJsselstein, which is used for FM- and TV-broadcasting. The Gerbrandy Tower used to be in the municipality of Lopik as well before an administrative change, and is often referred to as the &quot;Lopik tower&quot;.

<doc id="1278662" wikidata="Q5727523" url="?curid=1278662" title="Henry Richard">
<text>Henry Richard (3 April 1812 – 20 August 1888) was a Congregational minister and Welsh Member of Parliament between 1868–1888. Richard was an advocate of peace and international arbitration, as secretary of the Peace Society for forty years (1848–1884). His other interests included anti-slavery work.

==Early life==
Born in 1812 in Tregaron, Ceredigion, he was the second son of Ebenezer Richard (1781–1837), a Calvinistic Methodist minister. He was educated initially at Llangeitho grammar school, and attended Highbury College, near London, to obtain qualifications for the ministry.

In 1835, after ordination Richard was appointed pastor at the Congregational Marlborough Chapel, in the Old Kent Road, London. Its foundation stone had been laid by Thomas Wilson in 1826. Richard succeeded Thomas Hughes, and raised sufficient funds to pay off the chapel&#x27;s building loans and establish a school (British School, Oakley Place).

==Secretary of the Peace Society==
Richard resigned in 1850 to devote himself full-time as secretary to the Peace Society, it was a post he had undertaken two years earlier on a part-time basis. He helped organize a series of congresses in the capitals of Europe, and was partly instrumental in securing the insertion of a declaration in favour of arbitration in the treaty of Paris in 1856. Through this work he became universally known in Europe and the United States until his resignation in 1885.

==Early political career==
During the early 1860s, Richard became a leading figure in the Liberation Society, whose main aim was the disestablishment of the Anglican Church. The Society increasingly focused its attentions on Richard&#x27;s native Wales and sought to contest parliamentary elections. While Richard&#x27;s published writings were critical of the landed gentry&#x27;s influence over political life in Wales, he did nevertheless recognize that the deferential attitudes of those who held the vote at parliamentary elections would be a barrier to any potential political breakthrough. Indeed, in Cardiganshire, levels of support for the Liberation Society (at least in terms of financial contributions) were low. The lack of a political aspect to the county&#x27;s nonconformity was illustrated at the 1865 general election when Richard briefly emerged as a potential Liberal candidate for Cardiganshire.

===1865 general election===
The sitting member for Cardiganshire, William Thomas Rowland Powell, had indicated some twelve months prior to the election that he would retire and Sir Thomas Lloyd of Bronwydd had been selected as the Liberal candidate. However, when Powell reversed his decision, Lloyd issued an address stating that he would not oppose the sitting member. As a result, both Richard and David Davies Llandinam offered themselves as candidates. On his arrival in Cardiganshire, Richard immediately visited Gogerddan to seek the views of the Pryse family and, as a result announced his candidature. The influence of Gogerddan was very strong in Aberystwyth and throughout the north of the county, and also particularly hostile to David Davies. Their support for Richard was influenced by their hostility towards Davies.

A selection meeting was arranged to be held at Aberaeron, but shortly before this took place, Powell again announced his retirement. Richard&#x27;s agents visited Bronwydd to ascertain Lloyd&#x27;s intentions and, on understanding that Lloyd would now fight the seat after all, Richard withdrew in his favour. David Davies, however, did not withdraw and in his speech accepting nomination was particularly critical of Richard&#x27;s decision to withdraw. Davies came within 361 votes of victory.

==1868 general election==
In 1868 Henry Richard was elected Liberal member of parliament for the Merthyr boroughs in South Wales.

===Member of Parliament===
Following his election, Richard become known as one of the foremost nonconformists in the House of Commons. Here he was a leading member of the party which advocated the removal of Nonconformist grievances and the disestablishment of the church in Wales.

==Chairman of the Congregational Union==
In 1877, Richard was appointed chairman of the Congregational Union of England and Wales.

==Author and journalist==
Among Richard&#x27;s writings may be mentioned:

* &quot;Defensive War&quot; (1846 and 1890)
* &quot;The Recent Progress of International Arbitration&quot; (1884) on the subject of peace and conflict
* &quot;Memoirs of Joseph Sturge&quot; (1864) in memory of the abolitionist and founder of the mid-nineteenth century Anti-Slavery Society, the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade;
* &quot;Letters on the Social and Political Condition of the Principality of Wales&quot; (1866 and 1884) reflecting his love of Wales;

He also prepared some of the material for the life of his friend and associate, Richard Cobden, which was written by John Morley, later Lord Morley.

In the field of journalism he contributed to the &quot;Morning Star&quot; and the &quot;Evening Star&quot;.

==Abolitionist==
Less well known for his anti-slavery work and unable to support the American Civil War as an appropriate means to end slavery, Henry Richard was nevertheless respected in this field. Indeed, a few weeks after his death, the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society (now Anti-Slavery International), published an obituary in their journal, the &quot;Anti-Slavery Reporter&quot;.

==Death and memorials==
Richard died suddenly of heart disease on 20August 1888 at the home of the Lord Lieutenant of Anglesey in Treborth, near Bangor. His body was brought to his London residence in Bolton Gardens, South Kensington, where it lay in state until his funeral on 31August.

His imposing white stone and marble tomb in the form of a shrine with its own gabled roof, replete with his carved portrait, was erected by public subscription in 1891 over his grave at the Congregationalist model non-denominational garden cemetery, Abney Park Cemetery, Stoke Newington, London. The grave lies on an eastern path not far from the southern entrance. His wife Augusta Matilda lies with him.

The equally imposing Henry Richard Memorial statue which dominates the Square at Tregaron was designed by Albert Toft and unveiled by Sir George Osborne Morgan on 18 August 1893. The inscription on the plinth reads:

<text>Mental Models is a book published by Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc., in 1983 . It was edited by Dedre Gentner and Albert L. Stevens, both employees of Bolt, Beranek and Newman, Inc. at the time. It appeared at about the same time as a book by the same name by Philip Johnson-Laird. According to the acknowledgment of the book, it resulted from a workshop on mental models held at the University of California, San Diego in October 1980, that was jointly sponsored by the Office of Naval Research and the Sloan Foundation.

==Chapters==
#Some Observations on Mental Models — Donald A. Norman, UCSD
#:Dr. Norman describes the properties of mental models — that they can be contradictory, incomplete, superstitious, erroneous, and unstable, varying in time. So the job of system designers is to help users form an accurate and useful mental model of a system. And the job of researchers is to set up experiments to learn to understand actual mental models, even though they may be messy and incomplete.
#Phenomenology and the Evolution of Intuition — Andrea diSessa, MIT
#Surrogates and Mappings: Two Kinds of Conceptual Models for Interactive Devices — Richard M. Young, Medical Research Council, Applied Psychology Unit, Cambridge, England
#Qualitative Reasoning About Space and Motion — Kenneth D. Forbus, MIT
#The Role of Problem Representation in Physics — Jill H. Larkin, Carnegie Mellon University
#Flowing Waters or Teeming Crowds:Mental Models of Electricity — Dedre Gentner, Bolt Beranek and Newman, and Donald R. Gentner, UCSD
#Human Reasoning About a Simple Physical System — Michael D. Williams, Xerox PARC, James D. Hollan, and Albert L. Stevens, Bolt Beranek and Newman
#Assumptions and Ambiguities in Mechanistic Mental Models — Johan de Kleer and John Seely Brown, Xerox PARC
#Understanding Micronesian Navigation — Edwin Hutchins, Navy Personnel Research and Development Center
#Conceptual Entities — James G. Greeno, University of Pittsburgh
#Using the Method of Fibres in Mecho to Calculate Radii of Gyration — Alan Bundy, University of Edinburgh
#When Heat and Temperature Were One — Marianne Wiser and Susan Carey, MIT
#Naive Theories of Motion — Michael McCloskey, Johns Hopkins University
#A Conceptual Model Discussed by Galileo and Used Intuitively by Physics Students — John Clement, University of Massachusetts Amherst

== Reception ==
Upon release, &quot;Mental Models&quot; received reviews from journals such as &quot;American Anthropologist&quot;. &quot;The American Journal of Psychology&quot; reviewed the work, stating that it would be of interest to &quot;those who are concerned with what is new in cognitive science&quot;. &quot;Instructional Science&quot; also wrote a review, writing &quot;&quot;Mental Models&quot; succeeds as an introduction to the vigorous, multidisciplinary attack on the ethereal problems surrounding knowledge representation. Whether mental models will prove their mettle in the earthly settings of instructional applications remains an open question.&quot;

<text>Kents Hill School (also known as Kents Hill or KHS) is a co-educational, independent college-preparatory school for boarding and day students. Kents Hill is located in Kents Hill, Maine, 12 miles west of the state capital of Augusta. It is the 30th oldest boarding school in the United States and one of the oldest continuously operating co-educational college preparatory schools. One of the three oldest Methodist academies in the United States (with Cazenovia Seminary and Wilbraham Academy), the school is now a member of the Association of Independent Schools in New England (AISNE) and accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC).

==History==
===Origins===
Kents Hill was founded in 1824 as the Maine Wesleyan Seminary by Luther Sampson, a Duxbury, Massachusetts native and a veteran of the American Revolution. According to an early publication of the &quot;Kents Hill Breeze,&quot; a defunct school periodical, Luther &quot;was of the fifth generation in lineal descent from Henry Sampson, one of the Pilgrim band that landed on Plymouth Rock, December 22, 1620.&quot; A carpenter who had not had a formal education, Sampson wanted to use the wealth he had earned in his profession and the government-granted assignment of land he earned as a Colonial soldier to benefit society and to glorify God. Sampson, his wife Abigail Ford, and their children lived in Duxbury and, later, Marshfield, before relocating to over two hundred acres in Readfield, Maine, around the turn of the century. In 1821, Sampson incorporated there the &quot;Readfield Religious and Charitable Society&quot;, whose original charter contained no mention of a school, but rather laid a plan to support area Methodist belief and practice. Sampson deeded the society over one hundred acres of land on Kents Hill.
Failing financially and seeking a more efficacious means of performing his mission, by 1823 Sampson had begun to explore the possibility of changing the society&#x27;s identity into one rooted in the education of youths. Together with Elihu Robinson, a carpenter-schoolmaster in the nearby city of Augusta, and his wife, they opened the Seminary in order to better society through education. Boys and girls appeared on the school&#x27;s roster from the day the school opened in 1825. It was originally founded as a manual labor school, part of a school movement in which academics were paired with mechanical and agricultural labor.

===Developments===
Later headmaster, Henry P. Torsey, oversaw the construction of Sampson Hall which was opened in 1860 and is still serving students today. Dr. Torsey also opened a female collegiate institute - the &quot;Female College&quot; - one of the first of its kind to offer degrees to women at the time. Dr. Torsey is also credited with introducing baseball to the school in 1861.

During the Second World War, Headmaster Bill Dunn inaugurated a ski program next to nearby Torsey Lake. The students cleared the land, and Kents Hill established an alpine racing program that endures to this day. The O&#x27;Conner Alpine Center boasts alpine racing and snowboarding facilities, complete with digital timing, night lights, snow-making equipment, and a ski lodge.

In the fall of 2008 the school opened the Harold Alfond Turf Fields, one of the largest turf field complexes in New England.

====Historic register====
The school was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Five buildings were included: Newton Gymnasium (1932), Blethen Hall (1883–84), Bearce Hall (1873), Ricker Hall (1893–94), and Sampson Hall (1858–60). Francis H. Fassett, Maine&#x27;s leading architect in the middle of the 19th century and an important figure in the rebuilding of Portland after the 1886 fire, designed Bearce and Ricker halls.

==Academics==

The student-to-faculty ratio at Kents Hill School is 6:1, with an average class size of 11. 85% of the faculty live on campus.

Kents Hill offers a college-preparatory curriculum on a semester schedule. Curricular offerings include 14 Advanced Placement courses and honors-level courses available in most academic disciplines. Kents Hill offers independent study options for direct-guided coursework outside of its course prospectus offerings. Kents Hill also provides a three-level ESL curriculum for non-native English speakers.

The school currently offers exchange programs with four international schools: Kent College Pembury, Tunbridge Wells, England; Montaigne School, France; Colegio Estudio, Spain; and Bishops Diocesan College, Cape Town, South Africa.

===Recognition===
Kents Hill School was voted &quot;Best Private School in Maine&quot; in 2013 and 2014 by Down East, The Magazine of Maine. In 2003, the school received the Siemens Foundation Award for Advanced Placement programs in math and science. In 2007, social studies teacher, David Pearson, was awarded a Harvard Singer Prize for Excellence in Secondary School Teaching.

<doc id="1278681" wikidata="Q2992566" url="?curid=1278681" title="Hetman of Zaporizhian Cossacks">
<text>Hetman of [[Zaporizhian Cossacks]] is a historical term that has multiple meanings.

Officially the post was known as Hetman of the Zaporizhian Host (, &quot;Hetman Viiska Zaporozkoho&quot;). Hetman of Zaporizhian Cossacks as a title was not officially recognized internationally until the creation of the Cossack Hetmanate. With the creation of Registered Cossacks units their leaders were officially referred to as Senior of His Royal Grace Zaporozhian Host (, &quot;Starshyi Yoho Korolivskoi Mylosti Viiska Zaporozkoho&quot;). Before 1648 and the establishment of the Cossack Hetmanate there were numerous regional hetmans across the Dnieper-banks, who usually were starostas or voivodes.

The first widely recognized hetman of Zaporizhia was Dmytro Vyshnevetsky, after that several Polish starostas were added to the Hetman registry such as Lanckoroński and Daszkiewicz who also led their own Cossack formations. According to Mykhailo Hrushevsky they were not really considered as hetmans, at least by their contemporaries. Among others such starostas were Karpo Maslo from Cherkasy, Yatsko Bilous (Pereiaslav), Andrushko (Bratslav), and many others. Even Princes Konstanty Ostrogski and Bohdan Hlinski were conducting Cossack raids on Tatar uluses (districts).

The commanders of Zaporozhian Host (the Kish) often considered as hetmans in fact carried a title of Kish Otaman. As from 1572, hetman was the unofficial title of commanders of the Registered Cossack Army of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. From the 1648 Bohdan Khmelnytsky uprising, Hetman was the title of the head of the Cossack state, the Cossack Hetmanate. Cossack hetmans had very broad powers and acted as supreme military commanders and executive leaders (by issuing administrative decrees).

After the split of Ukrainian territory along the Dnieper River by the Polish-Russian Treaty of Andrusovo 1667, there was an introduction of dual leadership for each bank, or for each Ukraine of Dnieper (left and right). After the Treaty of Andrusovo there existed two different Cossack Hetmanates with two Hetmans the one in Poland being called Nakazny Hetman of His Royal Mercy of Zaporizhian Host and the Russian one titled Hetman of His Tsar&#x27;s Mercy of Zaporizhian Host.

Eventually the official state powers of Cossack Hetmans were gradually diminished in the 18th century, and finally abolished by Catherine II of Russia in 1764.

===Hetmans of Cossack Hetmanate===

Historians such as Mykola Arkas question legitimacy of the Teteria&#x27;s elections accusing the later in corruption. Also some sources claim election of Teteria being taken place in January 1663. The election of Teteria led to the Povoloch Regiment Uprising in 1663, followed by bigger number of unrest in the modern region of Kirovohrad Oblast as well as Polesie (all in the Right-bank Ukraine). Moreover, the political crisis that followed the Pushkar–Barabash Uprising divided the Cossack Hetmanate completely on both bank of Dnieper River. Coincidentally, on 10 January 1663, the Tsardom of Muscovy created the new Little Russian Office (Prikaz) within its Ambassadorial Office.

Vouched by Charles Marie François Olier, marquis de Nointel, Yuriy Khmelnytsky was freed from the Ottoman captivity, appointed and along with Pasha Ibragim was sent to Ukraine fight the Moscow forces of Samoilovych and Romadanovsky. In 1681 Mehmed IV appointed George Ducas the Hetman of Ukraine, replacing Khmelnytsky.

Following the anathema on Mazepa and the election of Ivan Skoropadsky, Cossack Hetmanate was included into the Russian Government of Kiev in December 1708. Upon the death of Skoropadsky, the Hetman elections were disrupted and were awarded as a gift and a type of princely titles, first to Moldavian nobleman and later to the Russian Empress favorite.

On 5 April 1710 the council of cossacks, veterans of the battle at Poltava, elected Pylyp Orlyk as the Hetman of Ukraine in exile. Orlyk waged a guerrilla warfare at the southern borders of the Russian Empire with the support from Ottoman and Swedish empires.

===Polish appointed hetmans===
The Appointed Hetman Mykhailo Khanenko was elected the Hetman of Ukraine by a council of Sukhoviy&#x27;s Cossacks in Uman to depose Doroshenko. In 1675 John III Sobieski awarded the title to some Ostap Hohol (died in 1679). Same thing happened in 1683 when John III Sobieski awarded the title to Stefan Kunicki and in 1684 to Andriy Mohyla. Those awards were given during the Great Turkish War.

<text>William Hammond Wright (November 4, 1871 – May 16, 1959) was an American astronomer and the director of the Lick Observatory from 1935 until 1942.

Wright was born in San Francisco. After graduating in 1893 from the University of California, he became Assistant Astronomer at Lick Observatory. From 1903 to 1906 he worked on establishing the &quot;Southern station&quot; of the observatory at Cerro San Cristobal near Santiago de Chile. It only took him 6 months to start with observations from this new site, and he recorded a large series of radial velocity measurements of stars in the southern sky. In 1908 he was promoted to Astronomer. From 1918 to 1919 he was stationed at Aberdeen Proving Ground working for the ordnance section of the United States Army. He then returned to the Lick Observatory and worked there until his retirement.

He is most famous for his work on radial velocity of stars in our galaxy, and his work with his own version of the spectrograph that he designed himself. He obtained a spectra of novas and nebulae. In 1924 he made photographic observations of Mars in multiple wave lengths. From these pictures he concluded that its atmosphere was about 60 miles (100 km) deep.

Wright was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1922 and the American Philosophical Society in 1935. In 1928 Wright received the Henry Draper Medal from the National Academy of Sciences, and in 1938 the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society. The Martian crater &quot;Wright&quot; and the minor planet 1747 Wright are named after him. The lunar crater &quot;Wright&quot; is co-named in his honour.

<text>Rodney William Marsh (4 November 1947 – 4 March 2022) was an Australian professional cricketer who played as a wicketkeeper for the Australian national team. He was a part of the Australian squad which finished as runners-up at the 1975 Cricket World Cup.

Marsh had a Test career spanning from the 1970–71 to the 1983–84 Australian seasons. In 96 Tests, he set a world record of 355 wicketkeeping dismissals, the same number his pace bowling Western Australian teammate Dennis Lillee achieved with the ball. The pair were known for their bowler–wicketkeeper partnership, which yielded 95 Test wickets, a record for any such combination. They made their Test debuts in the same series and retired from Test cricket in the same match. &quot;Wisden&quot; stated that &quot;Few partnerships between bowler and wicket-keeper have had so profound an impact on the game.&quot;

Marsh had a controversial start to his Test career, selected on account of his batting abilities. Sections of the media lampooned Marsh&#x27;s glovework, dubbing him &quot;Iron Gloves&quot; after sloppy catching in his debut Test. His keeping improved over time and by the end of his career he was regarded as one of the finest in the history of the sport. He was widely regarded for his sense of team discipline, in particular after Bill Lawry controversially declared the Australian first innings closed in the Fifth Test of the 1970–71 series at the MCG with Marsh eight runs short of a century. He was known for his athletic keeping. He was nicknamed Australia&#x27;s marshal due to his ability to uplift the spirit and energy within the Australian side by having some word with opponent batsmen during his playing days which had also influenced a shift in momentum in several occasions where Australia would go on to win matches from precarious situations.

In 2009, Marsh was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.

== Early years ==
Marsh was born in the Perth suburb of Armadale on 4 November 1947 to Barbara and Ken Marsh. Marsh played backyard cricket with his older brother Graham, who became a professional golfer and won eleven times on the European Tour. Both brothers represented Western Australia at cricket at schoolboy level. Marsh played his first competitive match at the age of eight for the Armadale under-16s, where he also kept wicket. At thirteen he captained the state schoolboys&#x27; team, and joined the West Perth district club.

When he debuted for West Perth&#x27;s first XI he was a specialist batsman, as Western Australia wicketkeeper Gordon Becker also represented the club. In order to further his keeping, Marsh joined the University club. He formed a bond with Dennis Lillee in 1966 at a time when Marsh was serving as a trainee teacher with the University Club. Since then, he has been dubbed as Lillee&#x27;s partner-in-crime by pundits.

Marsh made his first-class debut for Western Australia, again as a specialist batsman, against the touring West Indies in 1968–69. He had an unusual match, scoring 0 and 104. His whirlwind knock of 104 on state debut against a fancied West Indian bowling attack which comprised Garfield Sobers, Charlie Griffith and Wes Hall.

== Test career ==
Marsh replaced the retired Becker from the 1969–70 season. At the time, Australia was touring India and South Africa with Brian Taber and Ray Jordon as the team&#x27;s wicketkeepers. In the autumn of 1970, an Australian second team toured New Zealand with John MacLean as wicketkeeper. Therefore, Marsh was behind these players in the pecking order. However, he was a controversial selection for the first Test of the 1970–71 Ashes series, replacing Taber; Marsh was selected for his batting.

The media was quick to criticise Marsh&#x27;s glovework in his early career, dubbing him &quot;Iron Gloves&quot; after he missed a number of catches. Even on his debut in the First Test in the 1970–71 Ashes series he took four catches in his first innings. His batting proved invaluable on a number of occasions and in the Fifth Test he equalled the record for the highest Test innings by an Australian keeper, set by Don Tallon. The end of the innings was controversial; the captain Bill Lawry declared with Marsh eight runs short of a century so he could get an extra hour of bowling before stumps. When questioned by the press about his lost chance to make an historic century Marsh said he had gained forty runs instead of missing eight as he thought Lawry should have declared an hour earlier. Even though Marsh was unbeaten on 92 before declaration was made, Marsh emphasized first priority for the team before personal milestones and achievements. His gesture eventually would help him to win accolades and also to stamp a sense of authority and loyalty among the fans as well as among the teammates. Marsh later admitted that he was underprepared as a wicketkeeper, but he learned from watching his English counterpart Alan Knott. He and Knott did, however, concede the same number of byes in the series: 44.

Marsh became an integral part of the team as the side improved during the 1972 tour of England. He was deemed a strong gatekeeper to Australia&#x27;s baggy green culture and was known for his authorship of Australian team victory song &quot;Under the Southern Cross I Stand&quot; which he co-opted from the original version of Henry Lawson&#x27;s 1887 poem &quot;Flag of the Southern Cross&quot;. Marsh initially had the role of leading the team in singing it, and on his retirement he passed it on to Allan Border.

It was revealed that it was Marsh who started the victory celebration by narrating the song following Australia&#x27;s emphatic victory against England on the final day of the fifth and final test match on 16 August 1972 at The Oval where Australia successfully chased down 242 with 5 wickets to spare.

He became the first Australian keeper to hit a century by scoring 118 in the first Test against Pakistan at Adelaide in 1972–73. He also hit 236 against the tourists for Western Australia, the best score of his career. Playing a key role in Australia&#x27;s series victories over England and the West Indies in the series of 1974–75 and 1975–76, Marsh made many acrobatic dives to catch balls delivered by Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson. He took 45 dismissals in those two series, including a world-record 26 catches in six Tests against the West Indies.

Marsh scored an unbeaten 110 in the second innings of the Centenary Test against England in 1977, becoming the first Australian wicketkeeper to score a Test century against England. In the same match he passed Wally Grout&#x27;s Australian wicket-keeping record of 187 Test dismissals. He scored a further 16 half centuries. In first class matches, he accumulated 11 centuries including a best of 236, aggregating more than 10000 runs in his career.

When the breakaway World Series Cricket was formed, Marsh had no hesitation in signing for Kerry Packer. He claimed 54 dismissals in 16 Supertests. Upon his return to traditional international cricket in 1979–80, his age did not affect his keeping ability. On the 1981 tour of England, he took 23 dismissals to become the first wicketkeeper to take 100 dismissals in Ashes Tests, broke Knott&#x27;s world record in 22 fewer Tests and passed 3000 runs in Test cricket.

He was the wicketkeeper, in the infamous underarm bowling incident of 1981 which happened during the 3rd final of the 1980–81 Australia Tri-Nation Series.

In 1982–83, his penultimate season, he took 28 dismissals against England, including nine and eight in the second and third Test respectively. His batting form fell away towards the end of his Test career, his last 22 Tests yielding only 589 runs at an average of 19.63. On his final test match appearance against Pakistan at the Sydney Cricket Ground on 6 January 1984, he effected five dismissals and set a then world record for most test dismissals by a keeper at that time with 355. He also became the first keeper to reach 350 dismissals. Marsh&#x27;s retirement coincided with those of Dennis Lillee and former Australia captain Greg Chappell.

==Style==
Powerfully built, Marsh was regarded as an all rounder for the majority of his career. Coupled with his short stature, his power suited him to the task of keeping wicket. Despite his bulk, which forced him to work heavily on reducing his weight in his early career, he had fast foot movement, combined with fast anticipation and reflexes, which allowed him to cover more ground. He raised the role of wicketkeeper to a more prominent status in a team with his acrobatic diving, raucous appeals and habit of throwing a ball high into the air upon completing a dismissal. As the wicketkeeper, he made himself the focal point in the field and attempted to extract higher standards of concentration from both himself and his teammates. Speaking of his understanding with Lillee, he said, &quot;I&#x27;ve played with him so much now that most of the time I know what he is going to do before he has bowled ... I know from the way he runs up; the angle, the speed, where he hits the crease, where the ball is going to be.&quot;

At state level, Marsh was a noted captain, leading the state to a Sheffield Shield and Gillette Cup double in both forms of the game in 1976–77. He had nine wins and seven losses in 20 Shield matches as captaincy, and seven from nine matches in the limited overs competition. 
Marsh was an effective player in ODI matches, contributing as a keeper and a lower order batsman. His power and aggression was put to good use in the closing overs, when he could score at a rapid rate. In one match against New Zealand in 1980–81 against Lance Cairns at the Adelaide Oval, he struck 26 from the final over, with three sixes and two fours, before falling on the final ball.

== Coaching and other non-playing duties ==
Marsh was a cricket commentator for Channel Nine&#x27;s international matches between 1986–1990 and 1996–1998.

He was a coach at the Australian Cricket Academy in Adelaide since its inception and was its director from 1990 to 2001. Some of his former proteges include Australian internationals wicketkeeper–batsman Adam Gilchrist and fast bowlers Jason Gillespie and Brett Lee.

Marsh was the Director of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) national academy from October 2001 to September 2005. During this time, England went from being a mediocre team to challenging Australia as the best team in Test cricket and in 2005, they regained the Ashes after 16 years in Australian hands with a 2–1 win. Marsh later criticised the ECB for releasing Troy Cooley, who had trained England&#x27;s four pronged pace battery, and attacked Duncan Fletcher&#x27;s selection of Geraint Jones as the wicket keeper ahead of Chris Read. He once declared his cricketing allegiance to England and was at one time a selector for the English team.

In August 2006, the South Australian Cricket Association announced Marsh had been appointed in a consultancy role to undertake a review of cricket throughout South Australia. Marsh had also worked with the Global Cricket Academy in Dubai.

He was included in a part-time capacity as a part of the Cricket Australia national selection panel in 2011. In 2011, in a newly created role by Cricket Australia he was asked to coach the coaches in order to ensure a unified approach to mentor the players across the states of Australia.

Marsh was appointed chairman of selectors for Cricket Australia on 2 May 2014, replacing John Inverarity. He was previously Cricket Australia&#x27;s manager of elite coaching development. He felt the heat at times from former cricketers including Michael Slater for not selecting Usman Khawaja in the Australian playing XI especially during the Chappell-Hadlee ODI series in February 2016 in New Zealand.

On 16 November 2016, Marsh resigned as chairman of selectors, after a series defeat to South Africa.

==Honours==
Marsh was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire in the 1982 New Year Honours and inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1985. He was named as one of Wisden&#x27;s Cricketer of the Year in 1982. He received an Australian Sports Medal in 2000 and a Centenary Medal in 2001.

In 2005, he was inducted into the Cricket Hall of Fame by Cricket Australia.

Actor Brendan Cowell portrayed Rod Marsh in the 2012 Australian miniseries &quot;Howzat! Kerry Packer&#x27;s War&quot;.

In 2015, he became the fourth Australian cricketer to deliver MCC Spirit of Cricket Cowdrey Lecture after Richie Benaud, Adam Gilchrist and Simon Taufel.

He received Honorary Life Membership of the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1988.

==Personal life and death==

Marsh&#x27;s son Daniel Marsh captained the Tasmanian cricket team in the absence of Ricky Ponting in the mid-2000s.

In 2010, he appeared in an episode of &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;, where it was revealed that his grandmother died after giving birth to one of his aunts, leading his grandfather to put their three children, including Marsh&#x27;s father Ken, up for adoption.

On 24 February 2022, Marsh was left in a critical condition following a heart attack in Bundaberg, Queensland, whilst en route to a charity event hosted by Queensland Bulls Masters. He died eight days later, on 4 March 2022, in Adelaide, South Australia, at the age of 74.

His death came on the same day as that of fellow Australian cricket icon Shane Warne, who had paid tribute to Marsh in a tweet a few hours prior to his own death in Thailand.

His funeral service was held at the Adelaide Oval on 17 March, and was hosted by James Brayshaw; amongst the tributes included a recorded eulogy by Adam Gilchrist.

<text>Qeqertarsuaq (, historically known as Godhavn) is a port and town in Qeqertalik municipality, located on the south coast of Disko Island on the west coast of Greenland. Founded in 1773, the town is now home to a campus of the University of Copenhagen known as Arctic Station. &quot;Qeqertarsuaq&quot; is the Kalaallisut name for Disko Island and is also now used for several other islands on Greenland, including those formerly known as Upernavik and Herbert Island. Qeqertarsuaq means &#x27;the big island&#x27; in Kalaallisut ().

In 2020, the town had 839 inhabitants. The remainder of the population of the island (less than 50 people) lives in the Kangerluk settlement, a few hours by boat to the northwest.

== Geography ==
The total area of Disko Island and its satellite islands (mainly Qeqertarsuatsiaq Island northwest of the northern coast and Qeqertaq on the southwest coast at the mouth of Disko Fjord) is . Blæsedalen valley is to the north of the town.

Kangerluk is the location where researchers found a &quot;galloping&quot; glacier in 1999 that moves up to a day.

== History ==
Traces of settlement between five and six thousand years ago have been found at Qeqertarsuaq. The settlers were paleo-Eskimos wandering south.

During the 18th century, the first whalers came to Qeqertarsuaq, where they found a suitable anchorage. The town was founded as Godhavn by the whaler Svend Sandgreen in 1773. The name was sometimes anglicized as Guthaven and the settlement was also known as Lievely or Leifly. It served as the northernmost point in the enforcement of the Danish rights to whaling in the region. Whaling has been of great importance to the town over the past two centuries. Hunting and fishing are still the primary occupations for the island&#x27;s inhabitants.

From an early date, Godhavn shared the administration of Greenland with Godthåb (modern Nuuk). Godhavn served as the capital for North Greenland while Godthåb directed South Greenland. In 1862, a new law on municipalities was passed and the so-called Directions were introduced in Greenland. The primary task of the Directions was the administration of the means set apart for social purposes: support for widows, orphans, and others in need. The Directions also functioned as inferior courts in case of theft and other petty crimes, and took an active part in the fight against the spreading of . In Godhavn, they founded a kayak school for boys and a sewing school for girls.

The Councils of Northern and Southern Greenland were summoned to a meeting in Godhavn on 3 May 1940. Following this meeting, administration for the entire island was concentrated in Godthåb. The Chief Administrative Office was abolished in 1950 at the establishment of the National Council of Greenland. With the end of government positions in town, the local economy focused more directly on hunting and fishing.

On 1 January 2009, the former Qeqertarsuaq municipality was merged into the new Qaasuitsup municipality. This in turn was partitioned on 1 January 2018, at which time Qeqertarsuaq became part of the new municipality of Qeqertalik.

== Tourism ==
Many of the flat basaltic mountains found on Disko Island are covered with perpetual snow. The largest is called Sermersuaq (&quot;Grand Glacier&quot;). Sermersuaq is situated rather far from the coast and is difficult to reach in the summer. Lyngmarksbræen (&quot;Lyngmark Glacier&quot;) is much smaller, covering only about 10 km, but can be reached more easily in a few hours&#x27; walk. From Lyngmarksfjeld, a panoramic view of Disko Bay allows viewers to see the icebergs at Ilulissat almost away.

Qeqertarsuaq has a dog sled rental.

== Transport ==

During the winter, Air Greenland operates air services from Qeqertarsuaq Heliport to Ilulissat, Qasigiannguit, and Aasiaat.

When the waters of Disko Bay are navigable during summer and autumn, the heliport is closed and communication between settlements occurs only by sea via Diskoline. The ferry links Qeqertarsuaq with Ilulissat, Aasiaat, Qasigiannguit, and Kitsissuarsuit.

== Notable people ==
* Rasmus Lerdorf, creator of the computer programming language PHP, was born in Qeqertarsuaq.

== Population ==
With 839 inhabitants in 2020, Qeqertarsuaq was the smallest town in the then-municipality of Qaasuitsup. The population has decreased by more than 22% relative to the 1990 levels and by nearly 15% relative to the 2000 levels.

<text>A semantic grid is an approach to grid computing in which information, computing resources and services are described using the semantic data model. In this model, the data and metadata are expressed through facts (small sentences), becoming directly understandable for humans. This makes it easier for resources to be discovered and combined automatically to create virtual organizations (VOs). The descriptions constitute metadata and are typically represented using the technologies of the Semantic Web, such as the Resource Description Framework (RDF).

Like the Semantic Web, the semantic grid can be defined as 
&quot;an extension of the current grid in which information and services are given well-defined meaning, better enabling computers and people to work in cooperation.&quot;

This notion of the semantic grid was first articulated in the context of e-Science, observing that such an approach is necessary to achieve a high degree of easy-to-use and seamless automation, enabling flexible collaborations and computations on a global scale.

The use of semantic web and other knowledge technologies in grid applications are sometimes described as the knowledge grid.
Semantic grid extends this by also applying these technologies within the grid middleware.

Some semantic grid activities are coordinated through the Semantic Grid Research Group of the Global Grid Forum.

<doc id="1278709" wikidata="Q2634190" url="?curid=1278709" title="Chico Bouchikhi">
<text>Jalloul &quot;Chico&quot; Bouchikhi (; born 13 October 1954) is a French musician and a co-founder of the Gipsy Kings. After leaving the band in 1991, he formed his own group, Chico &amp; the Gypsies.

==Early life==
Bouchikhi was born in Arles, France, to a Moroccan father from Oujda and an Algerian mother from Tlemcen. He was married to Marthe Reyes, daughter of José Reyes, the father of the Reyes sons, members of the group Gipsy Kings.

==Career==
In 1979, upon the death of their father, José, the five Reyes brothers from Arles (Nicolas, Canut, André, Patchaï, and Pablo), who had up to that point been performing as a family band named José et Los Reyes, were joined by their cousins Diego, Paco, and Tonino Baliardo (nephews of Manitas de Plata) from Montpellier, and together with Bouchikhi, who was then married to Marthe Reyes, José&#x27;s daughter, formed the group Gipsy Kings. They traveled around France and played at weddings, festivals, and in the streets, with Nicolas as lead vocalist and Tonino on lead guitar. The group eventually became world-famous with such songs as &quot;Djobi Djoba&quot;, &quot;Bamboléo&quot;, and &quot;Un Amor&quot;.

In 1991, Bouchikhi left Gipsy Kings due to financial disagreements with their then-manager, Claude Martinez, and went on to start his own group, Chico &amp; the Gypsies. The band has released numerous albums since 1992.

==Personal life==
Bouchikhi&#x27;s brother, Ahmed, was assassinated by Mossad agents in the Norwegian town of Lillehammer in July 1973, in what came to be known as the Lillehammer affair. Ahmed, a waiter, had been mistaken for Ali Hassan Salameh.

Bouchikhi is a UNESCO special envoy for peace. In 1994, he was invited to play before Shimon Peres and Yasser Arafat during the Oslo Accords peace negotiations.

In 2001, he unsuccessfully ran in the municipal elections of Arles.

In 2014, Bouchikhi visited Israel. When asked in an interview with &quot;The Independent&quot; about his decision to refuse to participate in a boycott of the country, he insisted that reconciliation was more important than holding grudges.

Bouchikhi lives in Arles, where he owns a restaurant and music venue called Patio de Camargue.

<text>The tubax is a modified contrabass saxophone developed in 1999 by the German instrument maker Benedikt Eppelsheim. Although it has the same fingering as the saxophone, Eppelsheim&#x27;s design reduces the amount of expansion of its conical bore in relation to the length of tubing, resulting in a smaller volume of resonant air column. This allows for it to use a smaller mouthpiece (baritone or bass, instead of a larger contrabass mouthpiece), and more compactly folded tubing. The tubax exists in E♭ contrabass and B♭ or C subcontrabass sizes. Its name is a combination of the words &quot;tuba&quot; and &quot;sax&quot;.

Eppelsheim&#x27;s first conception of the tubax came in 1992 or 1993, while working at Bavarian instrument maker Münchner Blech. Prior to this time, while working in Franz Traut&#x27;s workshop in Munich, he had spent much time experimenting with bocals and repairing saxophones, and built two experimental instruments. At Münchner Blech he was able to work on contrabass and bass saxophones, as well as sarrusophones. Noting that there were no contrabass saxophones in modern production, he had the idea to build one in a shape reminiscent of the sarrusophone, or the &quot;saxophone bourdon&quot; on Adolphe Sax&#x27;s original patent drawing.

The process from idea to production took about seven years. The initial design took about a week, followed by four weeks of building a prototype. Most of the time was spent calculating the scale length and tone hole positions, based on principles described in Cornelis Johannes Nederveen&#x27;s &quot;Acoustical aspects of woodwind instruments&quot; and Arthur H. Benade&#x27;s &quot;Fundamentals of musical acoustics.&quot;

The first size of tubax to be developed was the E♭ (contrabass) tubax, introduced at the Musikmesse Frankfurt in 1999 and intended as a more practical alternative to the contrabass saxophone. The larger B♭ (subcontrabass) tubax appeared soon after and is equivalent to the subcontrabass saxophone, which although envisioned as the &quot;saxophone bourdon&quot; by Adolphe Sax in his 1846 patent, was only first built in 2010 by Brazilian manufacturer J&#x27;Élle Stainer. The subcontrabass tubax is also available in C.

==Construction==
The E♭ and B♭ tubax have the same lengths of tubing as the contrabass and subcontrabass saxophones respectively, but are much more compact. They are built with a narrower conical bore, somewhere between a regular saxophone and a contrabass sarrusophone, and use comparatively smaller baritone or bass saxophone mouthpieces. While saxophones are folded a maximum of three times, rendering saxophones larger than the baritone tall and unwieldy, the tubax is folded four times, to stand only high for the E♭ tubax, not much taller than a baritone saxophone, yet an octave lower. Similarly, the B♭ tubax stands tall, nearly half of the enormous height of an equivalent subcontrabass saxophone. Despite this, the tubax retains identical fingering to a standard saxophone, including an altissimo F♯ key. This required completely redesigned keywork, which also brings the hands to a more comfortable position. The smaller size and more accessible key placements result in more portable and ergonomic instruments. The tubax also has a more focused and compact timbre than that of the full-sized saxophones.

==Repertoire and performance==

Given its short history and rarity, little has been specifically written for the tubax, but it can readily be used for any material intended for bass or contrabass saxophone. The tubax, like the saxophone, is a transposing instrument notated in treble clef. The E♭ and B♭ models have identical ranges to the contrabass and subcontrabass saxophones, respectively. Built without the low A key found on some low saxophones, the lowest note of the E♭ tubax is thus D♭, an octave below the lowest note of the baritone saxophone. The lowest note of the B♭ tubax is A♭, a semitone below the lowest note on the piano keyboard (A).

<doc id="1278755" wikidata="Q510737" url="?curid=1278755" title="Lucian of Antioch">
<text>Lucian of Antioch (Greek: Λουκιανός Αντιοχείας c. 240 – January 7, 312), known as Lucian the Martyr, was a Christian presbyter, theologian and martyr. He was noted for both his scholarship and ascetic piety.

==History==
According to Suidas, Lucian was born at Samosata, Kommagene, Syria, to Christian parents, and was educated in the neighbouring city of Edessa, Mesopotamia, at the school of Macarius. However, this tradition might be due to a conflation with his famous namesake, Lucian of Samosata, the pagan satirist of the second century.

At Antioch, Lucian was ordained presbyter. Eusebius of Caesarea notes his theological learning and Lucian&#x27;s vita (composed after 327) reports that he founded a &quot;Didaskaleion&quot;, a school. Scholars following Adolf von Harnack see him as the first head of the School of Antioch, with links to later theologians Diodorus of Tarsus and Theodore of Mopsuestia, but that contention is unrecorded in the extant sources.

After the deposition of Antioch&#x27;s bishop Paul of Samosata, he fell under suspicion for heresy, and was excommunicated. According to Alexander of Alexandria, he remained in schism during the episcopates of three bishops, Domnus, Timaeus and Cyril, whose administration extended from 268 to 303. Lucian was reconciled with the Church either early in the episcopate of Cyril (perhaps about 285), which seems more likely, or under Cyril&#x27;s successor Tyrannus.

During the persecution of Maximinus Daia, Lucian was arrested at Antioch and sent to Nicomedia, where he endured many tortures over nine months of imprisonment. He was twice brought up for examination, and both times defended himself ably and refused to renounce his Christian faith.

His death is uncertain. He might have been starved to death. Another, more likely, possibility is that he was beheaded. The traditional date ascribed to his execution is January 7, 312, in Nicomedia. There is a late tradition of uncertain origin that he had been drowned in the sea and that his body was returned to land by a dolphin.

He was buried at Drepanum on the Gulf of Nicomedia, which was later renamed Helenopolis to honour Helena, mother of Constantine the Great.

He is also commemorated as a saint, with a feast day of January 7 in the Roman Catholic Church and October 15 in the Orthodox Church.

==Theology==

Lucian&#x27;s theological position is a matter of contention. Attempts to reconstruct his theology from the extant sources have led to contradictory results.

Because Arius in a letter addressed Eusebius of Nicomedia as &quot;sylloukianistes&quot; (&quot;Fellow-Lucianist&quot;), Lucian&#x27;s theology came to be associated with the Arian controversy. Following Adolf von Harnack, many scholars have interpreted the word (which only appears in this instance) as denoting a theological school and have therefore seen not only Eusebius but also Arius and other Arian leaders (among them Maris, Theognis of Nicaea and Asterius) as pupils of Lucian and have transferred Arian views unto Lucian. The first writer to clearly attest such a discipleship for a number of Arian sympathisers—but not for Arius and his closer associates—was the Anomoean church historian Philostorgius.

Others have interpreted the word as indicating not a theological link but the special veneration accorded to Lucian by Eusebius, who by that time headed the church of Nicomedia, the place of Lucian&#x27;s martyrdom. Lucian&#x27;s veneration increased during the latter half of Constantine&#x27;s reign, in particular due to the patronage of the Empress Helena.

Opponents of Arianism, such as Alexander of Alexandria, countered this veneration by noting Lucian&#x27;s schismatic past. Marcus Victorinus identified the Eusebian party with Lucian. Epiphanius associates Lucian with heretical views about Christ&#x27;s human soul held by Arians (but also by others) and relates that the Arians venerated Lucian as their martyr and that Lucian lived together with Eusebius at Nicomedia.

Associated with Lucian&#x27;s name is also the &quot;Creed of the Dedication&quot; passed at the Council of Antioch in 341. This association is unknown to Athanasius of Alexandria and Hilarius of Poitiers, but known and accepted by later writers. It was most likely brought up by the Homoiousian party. In their opposition against the Homoian party supported by Emperor Constantius II, the Homoiousians claimed the legacy of Lucian and adopted the definition of 341 as their creed.

Other attempts to reconstruct Lucian&#x27;s theology have started out with Paul of Samosata, whose rejection of the allegorizing tendencies of the Alexandrian School, and especially those of Origen, was transferred to Lucian.

Because these identifications created a contradictory picture of Lucian, some scholars have proposed the existence of two Lucians, the first being a follower of Paul of Samosata, the second being Lucian the martyr, a theologian in the Origenist tradition and the teacher of Arius and Eusebius of Nicomedia. However, this proposal has now been largely rejected.

Whatever his theology had been, his status as a martyr and a saint was not impacted by concerns of orthodoxy. In the words of Philip Schaff: &quot;The contradictory reports are easily reconciled by the assumption that Lucian was a critical scholar with some peculiar views on the Trinity and Christology which were not in harmony with the later Nicene orthodoxy, but that he wiped out all stains by his heroic confession and martyrdom&quot;.

==Biblical text==

Lucian is credited with a critical recension of the text of the Septuagint and the Greek New Testament. The resulting manuscript was popular in Syria, Asia Minor, and Constantinople and was later used by Chrysostom and the later Greek fathers, and which lies at the basis of the textus receptus. However, Lucian took it upon himself to &quot;fix&quot; the manuscripts he received, saying he was correcting errors that had snuck in over time. He undertook to revise the Septuagint based on the original Hebrew. For this, he received criticism. Jerome mentions that copies of his work on the Greek Old Testament were known in his day as &quot;exemplaria Lucianea&quot; but in other places he speaks rather disparagingly of the texts of Lucian. Jerome also wrote: &quot;This (Testament) certainly differs in our language, and is led in the way of different streams; it is necessary to seek the single fountainhead. I pass over those books which are called by the name of Lucian and Hesychius, for which a few men wrongly claim authority, who anyway were not allowed to revise either in the Old Instrument after the Seventy Translators, or to pour out revisions in the New; with the Scriptures previously translated into the languages of many nations, the additions may now be shown to be false.&quot; In the absence of definite information it is impossible to decide the merits of Lucian&#x27;s critical labors. The 6th century Gelasian Decree, a work of the Latin Western Church rather than the Greek Eastern Church where Lucian&#x27;s work was more popular, contains a list of apocryphal books &quot;to be avoided by Catholics&quot; that includes &quot;the Gospels which Lucianus forged.&quot; Modern scholars mark Lucianic rescensions with an L, to indicate that when variant readings arise, they may have been from Lucian&#x27;s adjustments.

Lucian integrated a number of important minuscule manuscripts of 3 Maccabees.

<text>Robert F. Spencer (born 5 September 1957) is an Australian rock guitarist. He was a latter day member of Skyhooks (1974–1983) and the Angels (1986–1992). Spencer joined Rose Tattoo in 2017. As a songwriter he co-wrote tracks for the Angels, including sole writer for their single &quot;Finger on the Trigger&quot; (1988), which reached the ARIA Singles Chart 
top 40.

==Early life==

Robert F. Spencer, grew up in Sydney&#x27;s Eastern suburb, Maroubra and attended Our Lady of Annunciation Primary School, at Pagewood, New South Wales from 1963 to 1965 and Marist Brothers, at Daceyville from 1966 to 1969. In 1970, he started secondary education at Marist Brothers Pagewood (later named Marist College, and then called Champagnat Catholic College Pagewood).

==Career==
Spencer was a founding member of the rock band Finch in 1973 while attending Marist Brothers Pagewood, where he completed his Higher School Certificate in 1975.

He left Finch in 1977 to replace Red Symons on guitar in Skyhooks. He left that group in 1980. In 1986 he joined the Angels on guitar to replace John Brewster. He remained with the band until 1992. While a member of the Angels, he was also a co-songwriter of their material including sole writer for their single, &quot;Finger on the Trigger&quot; (1988). It peaked in the ARIA Singles Chart top 40.

Other bands in which he played were Mystery Band (1980–82), Fandango (1981), Honeymoon, Young Lions (both in 1984), Black Cat Moan (1982–90), the Puppy Bashers (1981) (the band were animal lovers and this poor taste joke rightly raised the ire of the RSPCA), the Temple Gods (1992–93) and, very briefly, the Choirboys (1996).

He lived in Melbourne and was active in the band Raw Brit playing covers from the 1960s and 1970s, originally made famous by English rock bands, Cream, Free, Deep Purple and Slade. He is also a coach for professional bands and helps mature amateurs as part of the Weekend Warriors program. He continues to coach bands, and welcomes those who would like professional and experienced guidance.

In August 2013, Spencer revealed on his Facebook page that he had been diagnosed with cancer, but confirmed that it was not life-threatening. He continues life with one very healthy kidney.
Bob Spencer was a guitarist in the hard rock band, Rose Tattoo, with which he has absolutely no political allegiance, from 2017 until he retired from the band in September 2022 for personal and political reasons, after a final European tour

Bob&#x27;s time is now mostly occupied with teaching, coaching and writing music, mostly evocative and instrumental, but also something which might be considered in the vein of dark blues and heavy funk.

<text>FarmHouse (FH) is a men&#x27;s social fraternity founded at the University of Missouri on April 15, 1905. It became a national organization in 1921. Today FarmHouse has 34 active chapters in the United States and Canada.

==History==
FarmHouse was founded as a professional agriculture fraternity on April 15, 1905, by seven men at the University of Missouri, who met at a YMCA bible study and decided they wanted to form a club. The seven founders were D. Howard Doane, Robert F. Howard, Claude B. Hutchison, Henry H. Krusekopf, Earl W. Rusk, Henry P. Rusk, and Melvin E. Sherwin. Doane conceived the basic ideas which led to FarmHouse and is considered the father of the fraternity.

The name FarmHouse was chosen for the following reasons:

Given their agricultural background and rural upbringing, the house in which they resided began to be referred to as the farmer&#x27;s house, by other students in a derogatory or demeaning way. The men living in the house however felt the name was appropriate as they knew the farm home to be a welcoming place for people to gather, to enjoy each other’s fellowship, to share a meal together, after a hard day’s work. This same welcoming environment of a farm home could be offered on a college campus, for studious men majoring in agriculture who possessed a strong work ethic. And so the group proudly took on the name FARMHOUSE.

A second chapter was founded at the University of Nebraska in 1911, organized by founder Robert F. Howard. After communication between the two groups, a third chapter was founded at the University of Illinois in 1914. FarmHouse became a national organization in 1921 by approval of each of the active chapters. On April 20, 1974, the FarmHouse Club at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, was the first chapter established outside the United States. With the establishment of the Alberta chapter, FarmHouse became an international fraternity.

FarmHouse joined the North American Interfraternity Conference in 1944. Because of its size at the time, eight chapters, it was not considered eligible for full membership. With twelve chapters and three colonies, FarmHouse became a full-fledged member on March 25, 1953. FarmHouse dropped out of the NIC from 1971 to 1981, as did many other national and international fraternities.

In 1974, the fraternity re-affirmed its alcohol-free housing stance by passing the stance in the bylaws at the Conclave of that year. In 1998, the NIC awarded FarmHouse the NIC Laurel Wreath for leading the path in alcohol-free housing.

At the 1984 conclave, the fraternity unanimously passed a &quot;Proposal for the Establishment of an Agricultural Sorority&quot;. Three of the women&#x27;s groups which had been affiliated with FarmHouse for at least the previous two years (Colorado State University, University of Alberta, and California State Polytechnic University, Pomona) indicated that they wanted to be a part of forming the proposed ag-related women&#x27;s fraternity or sorority. In 1985, the first chapter of Ceres was chartered.

==Mission and ritual==

The mission of FarmHouse Fraternity is primarily prescribed within what is known as &quot;The Object&quot; of the fraternity:“The object of our Fraternity is to promote good fellowship, to encourage studiousness, and to inspire its members in seeking the best in their chosen lines of study, as well as in life. Progress shall mark our every step, the spirit of congeniality shall reign at all times, and every member shall be honest with himself, as with his brothers. Men elected to our membership are considered to be of good moral character, to be high in scholarship, to have the capacity for meeting and making friends, and to give promise of service to their fellow men and to the world. To be and become such may at times require a sacrifice of time, pleasures and comforts.”The object is recited by members at all chapter rituals and regular chapter meetings.

The motto of FarmHouse is &quot;Builders of Men&quot;. The name FarmHouse is an acronym standing for Faith, Ambition, Reverence, Morality, Honesty, Obedience, Unity, Service and Excellence. FarmHouse does not have greek letters and contrary to some rumors, does not have &quot;secret&quot; greek letters.

The ritual of FarmHouse is open and non-secretive. Families of members are often encouraged to attend initiations.

== Membership ==
To become a member of FarmHouse Fraternity, an undergraduate must be extended a bid, or offer of membership, by a chapter of the fraternity at their university. Chapters regularly host recruitment, or rush, events to get to know potential new members, in addition to inviting them over to dinner or a tour of the chapter facility. Every chapter has an officer in charge of recruitment in addition to the responsibility for all chapter members to identify and recruit new members who live by FarmHouse values.

=== New membership ===

New members are men who have accepted a bid extended to them by a chapter of the fraternity. New membership is officially conferred during the course of the Star Ceremony. During the Star Ceremony new members are officially recognized by the chapter as brothers and are given their new member pin. The Star Ceremony is also considered to be the beginning of new member education. New member education is the period before initiation as a chapter member where new members learn about the history and values of the fraternity. New member education is led by an elected officer of the chapter known as the Director of New Member Education and lasts a maximum of twelve weeks. Once a new member completes new member education, he is considered for initiation as a chapter member.

=== Chapter membership ===

Chapter members are men who have been initiated as a member of a chapter of the fraternity. Members are elected to membership by a vote of the chapter, commonly referred to as the initiation vote. This vote reflects the new member&#x27;s completion of new member education and that they are &quot;considered to be of good moral character, to be high in scholarship, to have the capacity for meeting and making friends, and to give promise of service to their fellow men and to the world,&quot; as stated in the object. Membership is officially conferred during the Pearl Ceremony, where members are given the standard badge of the fraternity, pledge to uphold the principles and standards of the fraternity, and sign their name in the official chapter membership record, known as the Herd Book.

=== Alumni membership ===
Alumni members are men who have graduated from college or who have requested to leave the chapter prior to graduation but wish to maintain their membership in the fraternity. If a man wishes to obtain early alumni status prior to graduation, he may be granted it upon approval of the chapter, by two-thirds vote, and the International Executive Director. Alumni membership is officially conferred in the Ruby Ceremony and is considered to be the end of a member&#x27;s chapter membership. Upon becoming an alumni member, the man automatically becomes a member of the alumni association affiliated with his previous chapter, and if he moves to another state, will have dual-affiliation with the alumni association within that state.

=== Associate membership ===
Associate members are men who having demonstrated the qualities of a FarmHouse man, shown interest in the fraternity, and having not joined a social fraternity while in college or afterwards, are granted membership in the fraternity. Associate membership is granted by a local chapter, which the man automatically becomes an alumni member of. In cases where no chapter exists, an association may grant alumni membership with the approval of the international executive director. Associate members, just like chapter members, officially receive their membership through observing the Pearl Ceremony.

=== Honorary membership ===
Honorary membership is conferred to men of high character and great professional achievement who embody the ideals of a FarmHouse man. It is usually conferred during a Pearl Ceremony at a biennial conclave chaired by the International President. Honorary members may be nominated by unanimous vote of a chapter, association board, or a special committee on honorary membership appointed by the International President. Upon nomination, the candidate must be unanimously elected by the International Executive Board to receive honorary membership. Honorary members have the full rights of any alumni member of the fraternity.

== Awards ==
FarmHouse recognizes the outstanding contributions of both members and non-members of the fraternity.

The Master Builder of Men award is the highest honor that the international fraternity can bestow upon an alumni member. The award was created by the National Executive board in 1950. The award is given biennially at each regular conclave of the fraternity. Notable recipients included Cory Gardner (Colorado State &#x27;95) in 2018.

The Barnes Award for Outstanding Interfraternalism is given to individuals who have made a significant impact to the large fraternal movement. The award was created by the FarmHouse International Executive Board in 2012. It is not necessarily given to a member of FarmHouse but rather to those who have contributed to the larger sorority and fraternity community.

== Controversies ==
In 2014, the FarmHouse chapter at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln was suspended after the alcohol related death of an 18-year-old freshman. Four FarmHouse members, including the chapter vice president, were brought up on felony procurement charges. The chapter is now reinstated. The death prompted State Senator Adam Morfeld to introduce a Good Samaritan law providing limited immunity to underage students who call for help in alcohol-related emergencies.

In October 2021, the FarmHouse chapter at the University of Kentucky contacted campus police &quot;regarding reports of an unresponsive student.&quot; The student, later identified as Thomas &quot;Lofton&quot; Hazelwood, was taken to UK Albert B. Chandler Hospital in Lexington, Kentucky, where he was pronounced dead. A statement from the Fayette County Coroner said the 18-year-old&#x27;s cause of death was &quot;presumed alcohol toxicity.&quot; On December 22, 2021, the Fraternity suspended the charter of the University of Kentucky chapter and issued a no-contact order prohibiting current members of the chapter from any contact with FarmHouse for a period of seven years.

<text>Penlee Point (, meaning ‘stone-slab headland’) is a promontory near the coastal fishing village of Mousehole in west Cornwall, England, UK. It was the launching point of the Penlee lifeboat, which was lost in the disaster of 1981.

In 1883, Mr J Runnalls employed seventy people at the Penlee quarries and stone-mills. The stone was wholly used for road-making and was claimed to be one of the most durable available. On one square inch of stone, it took a pressure of 29.011 lbs to crush the stone and on one square foot, it took 1365 tons. Stone was exported to Welsh ports instead of ballast and to Bristol, Ipswich, London and Lowestoft for roads. Stone to London was taken weekly by steamer from Penzance and by sailing vessels from Mousehole.

In 1990 Penlee Point was designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest for its geological interest. The SSSI includes two small disused quarries as well as the cliff and foreshore.

<doc id="1278771" wikidata="Q829650" url="?curid=1278771" title="Palladium (classical antiquity)">
<text>In Greek and Roman mythology, the Palladium or Palladion (Greek Παλλάδιον (Palladion), Latin &quot;Palladium&quot;) was a cult image of great antiquity on which the safety of Troy and later Rome was said to depend, the wooden statue (&quot;xoanon&quot;) of Pallas Athena that Odysseus and Diomedes stole from the citadel of Troy and which was later taken to the future site of Rome by Aeneas. The Roman story is related in Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; and other works. Rome possessed an object regarded as the actual Palladium for several centuries; it was in the care of the Vestal Virgins for nearly all this time.

Since around 1600, the word palladium has been used figuratively to mean anything believed to provide protection or safety, and in particular in Christian contexts a sacred relic or icon believed to have a protective role in military contexts for a whole city, people or nation. Such beliefs first become prominent in the Eastern church in the period after the reign of the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I, and later spread to the Western church. Palladia were carried in procession around the walls of besieged cities and sometimes carried into battle.

==The Trojan Palladium==
===Origins===
The Trojan Palladium was said to be a wooden image of Pallas (whom the Greeks identified with Athena and the Romans with Minerva) and to have fallen from heaven in answer to the prayer of Ilus, the founder of Troy.

&quot;The most ancient talismanic effigies of Athena&quot;, Ruck and Staples report, &quot;were magical found objects, faceless pillars of Earth in the old manner, before the Goddess was anthropomorphized and given form through the intervention of human intellectual meddling.&quot;

===Arrival at Troy===
The arrival at Troy of the Palladium, fashioned by Athena in remorse for the death of Pallas, as part of the city&#x27;s founding myth, was variously referred to by Greeks, from the seventh century BC onwards. The Palladium was linked to the Samothrace mysteries through the pre-Olympian figure of Elektra, mother of Dardanus, progenitor of the Trojan royal line, and of Iasion, founder of the Samothrace mysteries. Whether Elektra had come to Athena&#x27;s shrine of the Palladium as a pregnant suppliant and a god cast it into the territory of Ilium, because it had been profaned by the hands of a woman who was not a virgin, or whether Elektra carried it herself or whether it was given directly to Dardanus vary in sources and scholia. In Ilion, King Ilus was blinded for touching the image to preserve it from a burning temple.

===Theft===
During the Trojan War, the importance of the Palladium to Troy was said to have been revealed to the Greeks by Helenus, the prophetic son of Priam. After Paris&#x27; death, Helenus left the city but was captured by Odysseus. The Greeks somehow managed to persuade the warrior seer to reveal the weakness of Troy: the city would not fall while the Palladium remained within its walls. The perilous task of stealing this sacred statue again fell upon the shoulders of Odysseus and Diomedes. The two stole into the citadel in Troy by a secret passage and carried it off, leaving the desecrated city open to the deceit of the Trojan Horse.

Odysseus, according to the epitome of the &quot;Little Iliad&quot; (one of the books of the &quot;Epic Cycle&quot;) preserved in Proclus&#x27;s &quot;Chrestomathia&quot;, went by night to Troy disguised as a beggar. There he was recognized by Helen, who told him where to find the Palladium. After some stealthy killing, he won back to the ships. He and Diomedes then re-entered the city and stole the sacred statue. Diomedes is sometimes depicted as the one carrying the Palladium to the ships. There are several statues and many ancient drawings of him with the Palladium.

According to the &quot;Narratives&quot; of the Augustan period mythographer Conon as summarised by Photius, while the two heroes were on their way to the ships, Odysseus plotted to kill Diomedes and claim the Palladium (or perhaps the credit for gaining it) for himself. He raised his sword to stab Diomedes in the back. Diomedes was alerted to the danger by glimpsing the gleam of the sword in the moonlight. He disarmed Odysseus, tied his hands, and drove him along in front, beating his back with the flat of his sword. From this action was said to have arisen the Greek proverbial expression &quot;Diomedes&#x27; necessity&quot;, applied to those who act under compulsion. Because Odysseus was essential for the destruction of Troy, Diomedes refrained from injuring him. Diomedes took the Palladium with him when he left Troy. According to some stories, he brought it to Italy; others say that it was stolen from him on the way.

===Arrival at Rome===
According to various versions of this legend the Trojan Palladium found its way to Athens, Argos, Sparta (all in Greece) or Rome in Italy. To this last city it was either brought by Aeneas, the exiled Trojan (Diomedes, in this version, having only succeeded in stealing an imitation of the statue) or surrendered by Diomedes himself.

An actual object regarded as the Palladium was undoubtedly kept in the Temple of Vesta in the Roman Forum for several centuries. It was regarded as one of the &quot;pignora imperii&quot;, sacred tokens or pledges of Roman rule &quot;(imperium)&quot;.

Pliny the Elder said that Lucius Caecilius Metellus had been blinded by fire when he rescued the Palladium from the Temple of Vesta in 241 BC, an episode alluded to in Ovid and Valerius Maximus. When the controversial emperor Elagabalus (reigned 218–222 AD) transferred the most sacred relics of Roman religion from their respective shrines to the Elagabalium, the Palladium was among them.

In Late Antiquity, it was rumored that the Palladium was transferred from Rome to Constantinople by Constantine the Great and buried under the Column of Constantine in his forum. Such a move would have undermined the primacy of Rome, and was naturally seen as a move by Constantine to legitimize his reign and his new capital.

==The Athenian Palladium==
The goddess Athena was worshipped on the Acropolis of Athens under many names and cults, the most illustrious of which was of the &quot;Athena Poliás&quot;, &quot;protectress of the city&quot;. The cult image of the &quot;Poliás&quot; was a wooden effigy, often referred to as the &quot;xóanon diipetés&quot; (the &quot;carving that fell from heaven&quot;), made of olive wood and housed in the east-facing wing of the Erechtheum temple in the classical era. Considered not a man-made artefact but of divine provenance, it was the holiest image of the goddess and was accorded the highest respect. It was placed under a bronze likeness of a palm tree and a gold lamp burned in front of it.

The centerpiece of the grand feast of the Panathenaea was the replacement of this statue&#x27;s woolen peplos (a garment) with a newly woven one. It was also carried to the sea by the priestesses and ceremonially washed once a year, in the feast called the &quot;Plynteria&quot; (&quot;washings&quot;). Its presence was last mentioned by the Church Father Tertullian who described it derisively as nothing but &quot;a rough stake, a shapeless piece of wood&quot;. Earlier descriptions of the statue have not survived.

<text>The Mannlicher M1894 was an early blow-forward semi-automatic pistol.

==General features==

The earliest Ferdinand Mannlicher pistol, manufactured by Fabrique D&#x27;Armes de Neuhausen, Switzerland, was designed to be self-loading and to use a special rimmed cartridge in 6.5 mm caliber. The design represented an entirely new utilization of mechanical principles in automatic action called &quot;blow-forward action&quot;. In the standard type of automatic action for low-powered cartridges, the recoil (or blow-back) is utilized to drive back a movable breech face or block, but Mannlicher utilized the principle of a rigid standing breech with the barrel blowing forward to extract, eject, and prepare for reloading.

A special barrel housing which carries the sight covers the entire length of the barrel (6.49 in/165 mm) when the arm is closed. A heavy recoil spring is mounted concentrically around the barrel within this housing and is compressed between a shoulder at the forward end of the casing and a shoulder at the rear of the barrel.

An unusual element in this design is a three-armed &quot;barrel-holding lever&quot;. It is pivoted above the trigger as shown in the drawing from page 188, Mannlicher Rifles and Pistols, Smith, 1947. Its bottom arm engages with the trigger. The forward arm holds the barrel forward for loading. The rear arm serves as a hammer catch.

==Firing mechanism==
To load this weapon the hammer is cocked. As the hammer rotates on its axis pin, it acts upon the trigger, and the sear snaps into the cocking notch, holding the hammer. The hammer axis pin also supports the center arm of the barrel holding lever, which arm emerges and is raised high enough by its spring to press into a slot under the barrel. The rising thumbpiece on top of the barrel over the breech is then pushed forward. The barrel moves forward until its muzzle emerges from the barrel housing, compressing the recoil spring. The barrel holding lever is snapped into the locking notch in the underside of the barrel, thereby holding it in forward position for charging.

The stripper clip (capacity five rounds) is inserted in the clip guide of the receiver and the cartridges are pressed into the magazine. The cartridges are stripped off the clip and pressed into the magazine-well in the body of the pistol, compressing the spiral magazine-spring. A lip at the top prevents the cartridges from emerging.

The preferred direction for holding this pistol requires that the index finger be positioned around the frame above the trigger guard, with the middle finger through the trigger guard and pressed against the trigger.

As the trigger is pulled, the sear is released of engagement to allow the mainspring to drive the hammer forward slightly, but the rear arm on the barrel holding lever catches in a notch in the hammer to hold the hammer in firing position. The lowering of the forward arm of the barrel holding lever frees the barrel, allowing the compressed recoil spring to drive the barrel back, stripping the top cartridge from the magazine, chambering the round, and pressing the cartridge head against the standing breech. The M1894 is a double action firearm; the hammer can either be cocked manually for each shot, with the trigger performing the single action of releasing the sear, or it can be fired double-action, in which the trigger pull both cocks the hammer and releases the sear, at the expense of a heavier trigger pull.

As the propellant combusts and expands, the standing breech (a rigid, immovable object) acts to prohibit rearward movement of the cartridge and causes the expanding forces to move against the bullet (a somewhat more movable object), propelling the bullet toward the muzzle. The friction of forward motion of the bullet projectile against the inside of the barrel causes the bullet to act as a quasi-plug in the barrel. The barrel (a very movable object) is pushed forward by the motion and direction of the expanding gases against the friction of the traveling projectile, until the bullet exits the muzzle, after which forward motion of the barrel is due to inertia. Forward motion of the barrel is arrested by the progressively increasing tension of the recoil spring. The recoil of this pistol is somewhat higher than that of a conventional semi-automatic handgun, as there are no rearward moving parts to absorb recoil energy and spread the forces out over a longer period of time. It is no worse, however, than a revolver of equivalent power.

The extractor is mounted on the left side of the barrel extension. As the barrel moves forward the extractor draws the empty case from the face of the standing breech to eject it. The barrel holding lever arm moves up by action of the trigger, and catches the barrel in forward position. The magazine spring, pushing against the follower, forces the cartridges up to present the next cartridge for loading. As the trigger is released and moves forward it acts on the bottom arm of the barrel holding lever causing it to pivot and its forward upper arm to release the barrel. The barrel is then driven back by the recoil spring to load the next cartridge.

==Models==
The 1894 was originally classed as a &quot;half automatic or semi-automatic pistol&quot;. The overall length of the 6.5 mm model displayed in the photo illustrations on this page is 8.46 in (215 mm), dry weight is 30 oz (850 g).

There were several modifications of this pistol during its production until 1897. In some, the barrel catch does not operate during firing movement, so that the pistol closes to become fully self-loading. In no models, however, does the automatic action extend to cocking the self-loading pistol. In all variations the hammer must be cocked by thumb to fire or must be cocked and dropped in double action mechanical fashion by a pull on the trigger.

Experimental versions of this arm were also manufactured with a single action movement in which it was necessary to cock the hammer by thumb for each shot. Other types also used experimental forms of grip safeties. Late versions of these pistols were made to shoot a special 7.8 mm rimless cartridge with a straight sided case.

== Historical references ==
The pistols were tested by the US Army at the Springfield Armory in June 1900. They did not recommend the use of the pistol, primarily because of the poor function during the test. Cartridges frequently jammed or misfired, and the barrel burst after the 281st round.
While this pistol is very simple in construction the operation of loading is very tedious and slow, and would be almost impossible for a man to load it while on horseback. The muscular exerts practically the same as for an ordinary double-action revolver, while the rate of fire is much slower.

The design similarly failed Austrian and Swiss military trials. Total production was approximately 150 by Steyr chambered for the 7.6 mm Mannlicher cartridge, and less than half as many by SIG in 7.5 mm caliber for Swiss military trials.

<text>50 Cent Is the Future is the second mixtape by American rapper 50 Cent and first one by his rap group G-Unit. It was released on June 1, 2002 via Street Dance/Thurd World Muzic. The lone guest appearance is provided by UTP, which marks the first collaboration between the group and future member Young Buck.

In September 2004, the album was charted at number 59 in Switzerland and at number 65 in the United Kingdom. In 2006, the album was ranked at #7 on the &#x27;Top Ten Mixtape List Of All Time&#x27; by &quot;XXL,&quot; and at #22 on &#x27;The 50 Best Rap Mixtapes of the Millennium&#x27; by &quot;Pitchfork&quot;.

== Background ==
The mixtape was recorded in Canada in 2001 after 50 Cent was dropped from Columbia Records and blacklisted from the recording industry due to his controversial song &quot;Ghetto Qu&#x27;ran (Forgive Me)&quot;, leaving his debut studio album &quot;Power of the Dollar&quot; unreleased. He then traveled to Canada to record the mixtape due to being unable to find a studio in the United States that would allow him to record. The project mostly revisits material by Mobb Deep and features Southern hip hop group UTP represented by Skip, Young Buck and Juvenile. After &quot;50 Cent Is the Future&quot;, he recorded his 2002 compilation mixtape &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Back?&quot;, which &quot;G-Unit That&#x27;s What&#x27;s Up&quot; is included in.

<text>Wolseley is a provincial electoral division in the Canadian province of Manitoba. It was created by redistribution in 1957, and has formally existed since the 1958 provincial election. The riding is located in the centre of the City of Winnipeg. It is named for Col. Garnet Joseph Wolseley, the nineteenth-century army officer who played a significant role in crushing the Red River Rebellion in 1870.

Wolseley is bordered to the east by Union Station, to the southeast by Fort Rouge, to the south by River Heights, to the north by Notre Dame, and to the west by St. James. The University of Winnipeg is located in the northeast corner of the riding. The Legislative Assembly of Manitoba is located at the meeting point of Wolseley and Fort Rouge.

The riding&#x27;s human population was predominantly Anglo-Saxon when it was first created; a news report from 1969 indicates that its population had become more diverse by that time.

The riding&#x27;s population in 1996 was 20,472. In 1999, the average family income was $37,794, and the unemployment rate was 16.30%. Half of the riding&#x27;s residents are categorized as low-income, the second-highest rate in the province. Thirty per cent of families in the riding are single-parent.

The aboriginal population of Wolseley is 19% of the total. Five per cent of the riding&#x27;s residents are Filipino.

Health and social services account for 13% of Wolseley&#x27;s industry, with a further 12% in manufacturing.

Wolseley has undergone a number of dramatic political shifts since its creation. It was initially represented by Dufferin Roblin, a Red Tory who served as Premier of Manitoba from 1958 to 1967. He was succeeded by another Progressive Conservative, but in a 1972 by-election the riding was won by Izzy Asper, leader of the Manitoba Liberal Party and subsequently a prominent media baron in Canada. He retained the riding until his retirement in 1975.

The New Democratic Party of Manitoba (NDP) did not win the seat until 1981. However, the riding has been in NDP hands for all but two years since then. In the 2003 election, Green Party leader Markus Buchart ran in this riding and finished second with almost 20% of the vote.

Wolseley also holds the distinction of having elected one of the few MLAs in Manitoba&#x27;s history to be expelled from parliament: Robert Wilson, who was stripped of his seat in 1981 after being convicted of marijuana-related charges.

<doc id="1278820" wikidata="Q1277400" url="?curid=1278820" title="Earl of Ross">
<text>The Earl or Mormaer of Ross was the ruler of the province of Ross in northern Scotland, as well as chief of Clan Ross.

==Origins and transfers==
In the early Middle Ages, Ross was part of the vast earldom of Moray. It seems to have been made a separate earldom in the mid 12th century, when Malcolm MacHeth is found designated Earl of Ross. Malcolm had earlier been imprisoned at Roxburgh for rebelling against David I, but when Malcolm&#x27;s brother-in-law Somerled invaded Scotland, David was forced to relent and grant the earldom unto Malcolm.

The title was later granted by William the Lion to Floris III of Holland in 1161 upon Floris&#x27;s marriage to William&#x27;s sister Ada of Huntingdon. However, Floris held the title only in a nominal sense, as he took no active part in the governance of Ross. The title seems not to have been passed on, for in 1291 Floris&#x27;s descendant is found complaining that he had been deprived of the earldom.

The true founder was the famous Ferquhard, from the Irish Ó Beólláin (O&#x27;Beolain, Boland, Bolan) family. This Ferquhard was the son of the lay parson of the monastery of Applecross, and was hence known as MacIntagart, meaning &quot;son of the priest&quot;. In 1215 the newly crowned Alexander II was forced to suppress a rebellion in Moray and Ross. Ferquhard sided with the king, and captured the rebel leaders, before beheading them and presenting their heads to Alexander. For this he was knighted. He was created Earl of Ross in the 1220s, probably in 1226.

The line of Ferquhard continued until the death of William, 5th Earl of Ross, in 1372. William had two daughters, the eldest of which, Euphemia, married Sir Walter Leslie, who then became &quot;jure uxoris&quot; Earl of Ross. The Leslies continued to hold the earldom until another heiress, also named Euphemia. This Euphemia was a sickly girl, who suffered from a hunchback. Though she was nominally Countess of Ross, Ross&#x27;s governance was carried out by her grandfather, the ruthless and ambitious Robert, Duke of Albany. Euphemia&#x27;s uncle Donald, Lord of the Isles, had a superior claim by right of his wife, Mariota Leslie. He feared Albany would take not only Ross but more. So, in 1411, he invaded Ross with 10,000 men and won the Battle of Dingwall and the Battle of Harlaw.

In 1415 Euphemia was persuaded or forced to resign the earldom in favor of Albany&#x27;s son, John. However, the Albany Stewarts would meet their downfall when King James I returned to Scotland in 1424. Robert was believed to have murdered James&#x27;s brother David, who was King Robert III&#x27;s heir. And he sought to capture James, the last living son. In addition, while James was in prison in London, Albany did nothing to try and free him. In revenge James had the entire family forfeited and executed (with the exception of James the Fat who escaped to Ireland). By then, the earldom had officially passed to Euphemia&#x27;s grandson, Alexander of Islay (Alexander Macdonald), Lord of the Isles, who as Earl of Ross continued to hold it until his son, John forfeited it in the 1470s.

In 1481 James III granted the earldom unto his second son, also named James. James had already been made Marquis of Ormond at his baptism. In 1487 his earldom was raised to a dukedom, and he was granted the additional titles Earl of Ardmenach and Lord of Ardmannoch, Brechin and Navarre. James entered the clergy, and thus never married or had issue. He died in 1503, and all his titles became extinct.

The fourth creation was on 20 May 1565, for Henry, Lord Darnley, who was also created Lord Ardmannoch. Shortly thereafter he was created Duke of Albany. After his murder at Kirk o&#x27; Field, he was succeeded by his infant son James, whose accession as James VI a few months later returned the titles to the Crown.

Upon the investiture of Charles Stuart as Duke of Albany on 2 December 1600, he was also granted the Marquisate of Ormonde, the Earldom of Ross, and the Lordship of Ardmannoch. Charles&#x27;s elder brother Henry died unexpectedly in 1612, and he became Prince of Wales as heir apparent to the throne. He acceded as king in 1625, and the titles again reverted to the Crown.

Ross currently has no earl, but it is possible the title will one day be revived for a member of the royal family. There was speculation that the title might be revived for Prince Harry; it was not.

<text>In textual criticism of the New Testament, Caesarean text-type is the term proposed by certain scholars to denote a consistent pattern of variant readings that is claimed to be apparent in certain Koine Greek manuscripts of the four Gospels, but which is not found in any of the other commonly recognized New Testament text types (Byzantine, Western and Alexandrian). 

In particular a common text type has been proposed to be found: in the ninth/tenth century Codex Koridethi; in Codex Basilensis A. N. IV. 2 (a Greek manuscript of the Gospels used sparingly by Erasmus in his 1516 printed Koine New Testament); and in those Gospel quotations found in the third century works of Origen, which were written after he had settled in Caesarea. The early translations of the Gospels in Armenian and Georgian also appear to witness to many of the proposed characteristic Caesarean readings, as do the small group of minuscule manuscripts classed as Family 1 and Family 13. However, some text critics such as Kurt and Barbara Aland have disputed the existence of a Caesarean text-type.

== Description ==

A particularly distinctive common reading of the proposed text-type is in Matthew 27:16-17, where the bandit released by Pontius Pilate instead of Jesus is named as &quot;Jesus Barabbas&quot; rather than—with all other surviving witnesses—just &quot;Barabbas&quot;. Origen notes particularly that the form &quot;Jesus Barabbas&quot; was common in manuscripts in Caesarea, whereas he had not found this reading in his previous residence in Alexandria. Otherwise the Caesarean readings have a mildly paraphrastic tendency that seems to place them between the more concise Alexandrian, and the more expansive Western text-types. None of the surviving Caesarean manuscripts is claimed to witness a pure type of text, as all appear to have been to some degree assimilated with readings from the Byzantine text-type.

Some writers have questioned the validity of this grouping, claiming that the classification is the result of poor research. Insofar as the Caesarean text-type does exist, then it does so only in the Gospels, with most studies focusing on readings in Mark; the text-type is not so well defined in Matthew, Luke and John. The proposed Caesarean witnesses do not appear to have any common distinctive readings in the rest of the New Testament. Some of the Caesarean manuscripts have the so-called Jerusalem Colophon.

The Caesarean text-type was discovered and named by Burnett Hillman Streeter in 1924. According to some scholars such as Kurt and Barbara Aland, it is only a hypothetical text-type. There are no pure Caesarean manuscripts. In many cases, it is difficult to decide the original reading of the group, for instance in Mark 1:16:
: — ƒ 565.
: — ƒ
: — 700.
: — 28.

; Classification siglia

* H. von Soden — Iota (Jerusalem) (I), in part (most strong &quot;Caesarean&quot; witnesses are found in Soden&#x27;s I group, with family 1 being his I and family 13 being I).

* Kirsopp Lake, an outstanding British textual critic, developed the hypothesis of the relationship between ƒ, ƒ, Θ, 565, 700, and 28. Streeter carried Lake&#x27;s work further by pointing to Caesarea as the original location of the family.

* F. G. Kenyon — Gamma (γ)

* M. J. Lagrange — C

== Supposed witnesses ==
The earliest potential witnesses to something alike the Caesarean manuscripts are Papyrus 45 () and some of the (now non-existent) manuscripts used by Origen. According to biblical scholar Teofilio Ayuso, and the quotations of Origen count as &quot;proto-Caesarean&quot;, however the full Caesarean text only appears later in manuscripts such as Koridethi (Θ) and the early Armenian and Georgian manuscripts. Notwithstanding this association of and a &quot;proto&quot; or &quot;pre-Caesarean&quot; text-type, biblical scholar Larry Hurtado quashed any sort of affiliation between and the Caesarean text-type. He argued only that and Codex Washingtonianus (W) had a close relationship in the Gospel of Mark, but not with any other witness considered to represent the Caesarean text-type. Therefore, Hurtado states &quot;the &#x27;pre-Caesarean&#x27; witnesses are not Caesarean at all,&quot; and accordingly and W &quot;[do] not belong to any major text-type.&quot;

<text>Gaétan Soucy (October 21, 1958 – July 9, 2013) was a Canadian novelist and professor.

==Life==
Born in Montreal, Quebec, Soucy studied physics at Université de Montréal, completed a master&#x27;s degree in philosophy, and studied Japanese language and literature at McGill University.

Soucy wrote four novels. His first two, &quot;L&#x27;Immaculée conception&quot; (translated as &quot;The Immaculate Conception&quot; by Lazer Lederhendler) and &quot;L&#x27;Acquittement&quot; (translated as &quot;Atonement&quot; by Sheila Fischman) are extraordinary, dark and baroque works. His third novel, &quot;La petite fille qui aimait trop les allumettes&quot; (translated as &quot;The Little Girl Who Was Too Fond of Matches&quot; by Fischman) caused a sensation in Quebec and was immediately translated into more than ten languages. His fourth novel, &quot;Music-Hall!&quot;, was published in 2002, and translated as &quot;Vaudeville!&quot; by Fischman.

&quot;La petite fille qui aimait trop les allumettes&quot; was chosen for inclusion in the French version of &quot;Canada Reads&quot;, broadcast on Radio-Canada in 2004, where it was defended by actor, film director, screenwriter, and musician Micheline Lanctôt.

<doc id="1278823" wikidata="Q7662774" url="?curid=1278823" title="Synthetic personalisation">
<text>Synthetic personalisation is the process of addressing mass audiences as though they were individuals through inclusive language usage. It developed from critical discourse analysis (CDA), a branch of sociolinguistics concentrating upon how power is articulated.

Norman Fairclough, credited with developing the concept, calls it &quot;a compensatory tendency to give the impression of treating each of the people &#x27;handled&#x27; &quot;en masse&quot; as an individual. Examples would be air travel (&quot;have a nice day&quot;), [and] restaurants (&quot;welcome to Wimpy!&quot;)&quot; (2001: 52).

The use of second person pronouns contributes significantly to the process of synthetic personalisation within the mass media. It is extremely common to encounter constructions such as &quot;See you after the break&quot; on television shows prior to commercial breaks. (This example is also common in Paddy Scannell&#x27;s concept of Broadcast Sociability.)

Mary Talbot ([1995]/2003) used the concept in her work on a &quot;synthetic sisterhood&quot; in teenage girls&#x27; magazines, analysing the linguistic devices (&quot;pronouns, presuppositions&quot;) constructing a simulated friendship between reader and producer. Using a variety of sociolinguistic concepts, including positive politeness, she comments upon the ideological implications, such as patriarchy.

<text>The Little Girl Who Was Too Fond of Matches () is a novel by Canadian novelist Gaétan Soucy. It was one of the novels chosen for inclusion in the French version of &quot;Canada Reads&quot;, broadcast on Radio-Canada in 2004, where it was championed by actor, film director, screenwriter, and musician Micheline Lanctôt. The book caused a sensation in Quebec and was immediately translated into more than ten languages. It was translated into English as &quot;The Little Girl Who Was Too Fond of Matches&quot; by Sheila Fischman.

== Plot ==
The novel is about two siblings who live in complete isolation with their father. They are both his &quot;sons&quot;. One day the father kills himself by hanging and his sons decide one of them needs to go to the nearby village to get a coffin. While in the village it is revealed that one of the sons is actually a female, although she has no concept of that (she has no idea of sexuality and thinks she was castrated when she was very young and that is why she doesn&#x27;t have testicles). It also becomes apparent she has been being used for sex by her brother and there are even more nefarious occurrences which have been happening on their property. However; she has such little understanding of the outside world, that she believes all of this to be completely normal and rejects the outsiders&#x27; views of her family situation.

The main character&#x27;s only source of knowledge is from the books found in her household library. Most of these books are medieval stories about chivalry, knighthood and saving princesses. She becomes somewhat infatuated with the mine inspector she meets In the village who questions her about her living situation. She impulsively tries to get him to have sex with her, although this is more of a carnal urge and something she is probably used to with her brother and father. He succumbs at first but ultimately denies her, making her upset. He goes on to tell her that others will come and try to change her way of life. She flees in anger, riding the family horse back to their mansion. 
Once there, she encounters her brother about to dismember and burn their father&#x27;s body. She informs him about what she has learned in the village and urges him not to do anything to their father&#x27;s corpse. Her brother then goes through the house and arranges mannequins to appear as if they have fortified the household. She believes her brother is going mad and moves to an area of the property she calls &quot;the vault,&quot; somewhere her brother is afraid to go. She brings a book of spells which she continuously writes in.

Her brother begins building a shooting post from two letters on the property and dons himself king with a dead raccoon cap. She remains in the vault chronicling her thoughts. A figure emerges from the forest on a machine they have never seen before. It&#x27;s the mine inspector who the main character now believes is her prince. He finds her in the vault, making a horrific discovery. He has looked at the baptismal records and sees that there are supposed to be twin sisters on this property.

The mine inspector ventures into the vault and sees a humanoid figure bandaged from head to toe, still alive and another figure, a skeleton, hidden behind a glass case. The narrator explains that she believes they have been there forever and her father used to attend to them and spend time with them but then stopped and she has been feeding and tending to them ever since. The living figure is referred to as the &#x27;Fair Punishment&#x27;.

She makes it further obvious the Fair Punishment is her twin and the decomposed body in the glass case is her mother, although she does not understand it. When the twins were four years old, the Fair Punishment had a habit of playing with matches that resulted in a fire which killed their mother. The Fair Punishment survived but was severely burned, and the father believed being burned alive was her punishment for her misdeeds. The mine inspector then tells her he wants to take her to safety. He also points out that she is pregnant with her brother&#x27;s child. They leave on his motorcycle. He is her prince and they are riding away on his steed. As they are riding into the pines, the inspector is shot in the back by the brother. He is killed instantly.

She returns to the vault as more villagers begin to appear at the property. As her brother surrenders, she packs up belongings and escapes into the pines. The book ends with her giving birth.

==Film adaptation==
A film adaptation by Simon Lavoie, &quot;The Little Girl Who Was Too Fond of Matches&quot;, was released in 2017, and garnered seven nominations at the Canadian Screen Awards.

<doc id="1278849" wikidata="Q7192357" url="?curid=1278849" title="Pierre Maury">
<text>Pierre Maury (1282 or 1283 – after 1324) was a shepherd in the Comté de Foix. His life is known through his deposition, and the depositions of his friends and associates, to Bishop Jacques Fournier who was hunting for Cathar heretics. He plays a prominent role in Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie&#x27;s study &quot;Montaillou, village occitan de 1294 à 1324&quot; and in some ways is that book&#x27;s protagonist.

==Early life==
Maury was born in the small town of Montaillou one of eight known children of Raymond Maury, a weaver. While most in the town of Montaillou did some weaving, Raymond Maury was the only one to sell his wool rather than use it in the home, and was only two artisans in the town at the time, the other being Arnaud Vital, a cobbler. Needing humidity for the weaving, his house had a special cave-like area where he worked. Raymond Maury&#x27;s weaving could not sustain the family and like most villagers he kept some sheep. Pierre Maury became a shepherd caring for the sheep of a number of the villagers. During his youth he was converted from Catholicism to Albigensianism by his brother Guillaume, and neighbour Guillaume Belot.

== Cathar links ==
At age 18 Maury left home for the Val d&#x27;Arques where he worked as a shepherd for his cousin Raymond Maulen. While living with and working for his cousin, Maury fell in love with Bernadette d&#x27;Esquinath, a girl from the village. This passionate relationship persisted for two years, but his fellow Cathars disapproved as she was a Catholic. Pierre abandoned Bernadette when he was hired as a shepherd by Raymond Pierre, and became involved with his employer&#x27;s daughter, another Bernadette. The Pierres were dedicated Cathars and since Raymond was without sons, he hoped to make Maury his heir. Pierre became closely involved in the Cathar community, helping guide Perfects from village to village. Through this duty he developed a much envied collection: pieces of bread, each blessed by a different Cathar parfait.

In 1305 however, Jacques Authié, a local Cathar leader was captured, and the villagers of Arques, fearing punishment, abandoned the open practice of Albigensianism and traveled en masse to Avignon to seek absolution from the Pope. Maury refused to renounce his Albigensianism and did not participate. He stayed in the village to look after the flocks of those who were away. When the now Catholic villagers returned, Maury went home to Montaillou. Since the villagers had revealed all to the authorities, Maury was now a known but unabsolved heretic; and he became a fugitive from the Inquisition.

He spent Christmas of 1305 with his family in Montaillou before going into the employ of Barthélemy Borrel who sent him to Catalonia to look after sheep he owned there. Living amongst the nomadic groups of shepherds Maury no longer had many dealings with Cathars and was unknown to the local Inquisition. After two years of working for Borrel, Maury visited the fair in Laroques d&#x27;Olmes. There he stayed with his 18-year-old sister, Guillemette, and brother-in-law Bertrand Piquier. That night Piquier severely beat his wife. While a husband&#x27;s power was considered absolute, Maury was greatly concerned about this brutality to his sister. A few days later he returned to the town and stole away with his sister, entrusting her to a pair of parfaits.

For his absenteeism during this incident Borrel fired Maury, but he soon found another job working as a shepherd for Guillaume André. He spent three years working for André, travelling through Catalonia and Foix with the flocks of sheep and other shepherds. At some point in this period he was accused of fraternizing with a known heretic, but escaped the charge by pretending to having been miles away from the incident, a story backed up by his friends. He also successfully avoided the round-up of the heretics of Montaillou in 1308, being warned by Bernard Fort, who supplied flour to the shepherds. In 1309 Maury left the employ of André and worked for Pierre Constant of Rasiguières for a year before joining with his brother Arnaud in working for Raymond Boursier. In 1311 Pierre and Arnaud left this group, Arnaud going home to Montaillou and Pierre to Catalonia where he joined a team of shepherds working for Barthélemy Companho.

===Bélibaste affair===
In Catalonia he came in contact with the small group of Cathar exiles led by the parfait Guillaume Bélibaste. Over the next several years Maury traveled through Catalonia and the eastern Pyrenees. As a skilled shepherd his services were in demand and he could find work throughout the region. Maury became comparatively wealthy for a peasant due to his skill, hard work, and ability to find the best paying employers. Despite his many travels he frequently met up with Bélibaste, who pressured the nomadic shepherd to settle down. At one point, Belibaste prevailed on him to marry Raymonde Piquier, a blacksmith&#x27;s daughter, who was Belibaste&#x27;s lover and pregnant with his child. Pierre agreed and the pair were married. But the marriage lasted only a few days. Bélibaste then told Maury to have it annulled. Months later Raymonde gave birth to a child. Most of Maury&#x27;s friends were convinced that the parfait had used Pierre to cover the breaking of his own vow of chastity. Maury however, continued to trust the parfait.

==Capture==
Bélibaste&#x27;s Cathar community was demolished when the Inquisition sent Arnaud Sicre to infiltrate and inform on the group. Soon afterwards, Bélibaste, then Maury, were captured. In 1324 Maury was imprisoned and there is no record of him past this date.

<text>Miss Smilla&#x27;s Feeling for Snow (), published in America as Smilla&#x27;s Sense of Snow, is a 1992 novel by Danish author Peter Høeg tracing the investigation into the suspicious death of a Greenlandic boy in Denmark. A global bestseller, it was translated into English by Tiina Nunnally (credited as &quot;F. David&quot; in the British edition). 

==Title==
During her Greenland childhood, Smilla developed an almost intuitive understanding of all types of snow and their characteristics. As an adult, she worked for a time as a scientist whose speciality was snow and ice. Her certainty about the manner of a child’s death is due to this visceral &quot;feeling for snow&quot;.

==Background==
The novel is ostensibly a work of detection and a thriller, although beneath the surface of the novel, Høeg is concerned with rather deeper cultural issues, particularly Denmark&#x27;s problematic post-colonial history, and also the nature of relationships that exist between individuals and the societies in which they are obliged to operate. The protagonist Smilla Qaaviqaaq Jaspersen is a sympathetic and useful vehicle in this respect, her deceased mother being Greenlandic Inuit and her father a rich Danish doctor.

Having been brought in childhood from the poverty and freedom of Greenland to the affluent and highly ordered society of Denmark, Smilla&#x27;s relationship with Denmark and Danish society is strained and ambivalent. Smilla investigates the death of a neighbour’s child whom she had befriended—a fellow Greenlander, with an alcoholic, neglectful mother and a mysteriously deceased father. The story begins in Copenhagen, where the child has fallen to his death from the snowy rooftop of an old warehouse. The police refuse to consider it anything but an accident—there is only one set of footprints (the child&#x27;s) in the snow leading to the edge of the roof—but Smilla believes there is something about the footprints that shows that the boy was chased off the roof. Her investigations lead her to decades-old conspiracies in Copenhagen, and then to a voyage on an icebreaker ship to a remote island off the Greenlandic coast, where the truth is finally discovered. But the book ends unresolved, with no firm conclusion.

== Plot ==
Smilla Qaaviqaaq Jaspersen, 37-year-old product of the stormy union of a female Inuit hunter and a rich urban Danish physician, is a loner who struggles to live with her fractured heritage. Living alone in a dreary apartment complex in Christianshavn, Copenhagen, she befriends Isaiah, the neglected son of her alcoholic neighbour, because he too is Greenlandic and not truly at home in Denmark. Smilla&#x27;s friendship with Isaiah, recounted in the novel in flashback, gives some meaning to her otherwise lonely life. Isaiah’s sudden death is explained officially as a fall from the roof whilst playing, but Smilla’s understanding of the tracks the child left on the snowy roof convinces her that this is untrue. She complains to the police and quickly encounters obstruction and hostility from the authorities and other sources.

Working with Peter, a mechanic neighbour who had also known and liked Isaiah, and with whom she begins an affair despite her fear of dependency, Smilla discovers that there is a conspiracy centred on Gela Alta (a possible reference to the Latin verb gelo, &quot;to freeze&quot;, and the places called Alta in North Norway or Alta Lake in Canada or the feminine Latin adjective alta, &quot;high, deep&quot;), an isolated glaciated island off Greenland. Previous expeditions have found something there (Isaiah’s father was a diver who died on one of them, allegedly in an accident) and now plans are afoot to return for it. Isaiah’s death is linked to this conspiracy in some way. After a long journey of discovery in Copenhagen, during which she learns that the mechanic is not who he says he is, Smilla braves intimidation and threats and eventually gets on board the ship chartered for the mysterious expedition to Gela Alta, ostensibly as a stewardess.

The final action takes place on the ship and the island. Smilla is held in deep suspicion by the ship&#x27;s crew—who turn out to be all in some way compromised and in the pay of the mysterious Tørk Hviid, who is the expedition&#x27;s real leader. Despite repeated attempts on her life by crew members, who assume she is from the authorities, Smilla doggedly pursues the truth, even when she discovers that Peter has deceived and betrayed her. The secret of the island is revealed to be a meteorite embedded in the glacier, certainly uniquely valuable—perhaps even alive in some way. However, the water surrounding it is infested with a lethal parasite related to the Guinea worm, which is what really killed Isaiah’s father. Isaiah was forced off the roof because he had accompanied his father on the previous expedition and had evidence of the meteorite’s location—and the parasite itself was actually dormant in his body. When Smilla learns that Tørk Hviid had chased Isaiah off the roof to his death, she pursues him out onto the frozen sea. He tries to reach the ship and force it to sail away, but Smilla chases him, using her intuitive ice-sense to head him off, out into isolation and danger. Here the novel ends.

==Reception==
The New York Times called the novel a &quot;publishing sensation&quot; that &quot;was America’s gateway drug to a long-term dependency on Nordic noir.&quot; It was named the 1993 Best Book of the Year by both &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; and spent twenty-six weeks on the New York Times best-seller list. The novel was translated into seventeen languages, and published in over thirty countries.

As a genre novel, the book won the Crime Writers&#x27; Association Silver Dagger Award for Fiction in 1994, and was shortlisted for an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America in 1994. It also won the 1994 Dilys Award, chosen by the Independent Mystery Booksellers Association as the mystery title of the year that member booksellers most enjoyed selling.

Literary critics have since considered its cultural themes, such as viewing it as a response to the &quot;greed is good&quot; spirit of the 1980s that pervaded Denmark and other western countries, showing &quot;Danish society in terms of its limitations and injustices, particularly in relation to its treatment of Greenland and Greenlanders.&quot; Or as a nation coming to grips with its colonial past, showing &quot;a number of puzzles that a colonial, and later a capitalist, hegemony and subordination&quot; set up.

==Film adaptation==
The film, &quot;Smilla&#x27;s Sense of Snow&quot; starring Julia Ormond, Jim Broadbent, Gabriel Byrne, Richard Harris, Jürgen Vogel, Mario Adorf and Tom Wilkinson, directed by Bille August was released in 1997. There were some changes to the plot, especially having a more conclusive end in which the villain Tørk Hviid gets killed, instead of the book&#x27;s deliberately ambiguous ending. In the United Kingdom it was released as &quot;Miss Smilla&#x27;s Feeling for Snow&quot;.

==Awards and nominations==
* Winner of the Crime Writers&#x27; Association Silver Dagger Award in 1994.
* Winner of the Dilys Award for 1994 by the Independent Mystery Booksellers Association.
* Shortlisted for an Edgar Award in 1994.

<text>Sir Timothy Randall Martin (born 28 April 1955) is an English businessman and the founder and chairman of Wetherspoons, a pub chain in the UK and Ireland. In 2016, Martin actively campaigned for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union and was a strong supporter of Brexit, donating £200,000 to the Vote Leave campaign.

==Early life==
Timothy Martin was born on 28 April 1955 in Norwich. His father served in the Royal Air Force and then worked for brewing multinational Guinness plc, where he became the Malaysian marketing director. He has two younger brothers, Trevor and Gerry, and a sister, Louise.

Martin was educated at eleven schools in New Zealand and Northern Ireland, including Campbell College, Belfast.

He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in law from the University of Nottingham, and qualified as a barrister in 1979, but has never practised.

==Career==

His early jobs included working on a building site in Ware, Hertfordshire, and acting as a sales representative for &quot;The Times&quot;.

Martin is the founder and chairman of Wetherspoons. He bought his first pub, in Muswell Hill, in 1979 which was originally named Martin&#x27;s Free House before renaming to Wetherspoons, named after one of Martin&#x27;s teachers who could not control his class. His brother Gerry also ran a pub chain, Old Monk, which was listed in 1998, but went out of business in 2002.

After the initial opening of Martin&#x27;s first location, the organisation kept growing and expanding as Wetherspoons started opening more locations throughout the north of London, and eventually across the whole UK. In 1992, Wetherspoons was listed on the Stock Exchange as JD Wetherspoon plc.

In 1998, Martin kept expanding the company&#x27;s operations and opened 20 locations in one month in July, with seven opening on the same day.

In 2000, under Martin&#x27;s leadership, Wetherspoons opened its 400th location and by 2008 the number had increased to 800 Wetherspoons locations.

In 2005, Martin was voted the fifth most influential person in the UK pub industry. He is an admirer of Sam Walton&#x27;s business philosophy. He visits at least 15 Wetherspoons outlets each week.

In January 2023, the Wetherspoons pub chain closed 11 pubs across the UK with 35 more up for sale, Martin stated that pubs across the UK were being crippled via unfair taxes in comparison to supermarkets. Martin went on to state that he was pushing for tax parity with supermarkets and unless this is implemented the pub industry would inevitably shrink.

As of February 2023, Martin owned 30.77m shares (23.90% of shares).

==Political views==
===Brexit===
Martin was a staunch supporter of Brexit in 2016, representing these views for journalists and on political TV programmes such as the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Politics Live&quot;, and Sky News, and BBC Radio 4 programmes including &quot;Today&quot;, &quot;Question Time&quot; and &quot;Farming Today&quot;. In 2016, Martin donated £200,000 to the Vote Leave campaign. Throughout the campaign, he gave his reasons for the United Kingdom&#x27;s withdrawal from the European Union.

In January 2017, Wetherspoons published figures showing an increase in sales of more than 3%. Martin used this as evidence that there was no post-Brexit referendum slowdown as predicted by economists.

In June 2018, Martin announced that Wetherspoons would be ceasing the sale of products from other European Union countries in a 24-month plan, with the immediate example of Prosecco and Champagne being replaced by Australian wines. He believes the prediction of food prices rising and food shortages leading to stockpiling of supplies in the UK post-Brexit is merely scaremongering tactics deployed by pro-EU journalists, and mentioned the fact there were no increased queues in his restaurants as a result; after he removed French brandy from sale in his restaurants as an example.

Wetherspoons mass posted a pro-Brexit magazine to an unknown number of households in January 2019. The magazine claims to have a readership of two million. The employee campaign group, Spoons Workers Against Brexit, described the publication as dangerous propaganda, and said that Martin was exploiting his position as CEO. Wetherspoons responded by defending the mass mailing, stating it contained &quot;... pro and anti Brexit articles to stimulate debate&quot;; the proportionately minor mentions of views critical to a no deal Brexit were preceded by statements by Martin, deriding expert opinions and &quot;the elite&quot;.

In June 2021, Martin called on the UK government to introduce a &quot;reasonably liberal immigration system&quot; controlled by Britain rather than the European Union. He suggested the government should adopt a visa scheme for workers from the EU to help the UK&#x27;s pubs and restaurants hire more staff.

===COVID-19 pandemic===
Martin criticised the shutdown of businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic, saying that it was &quot;over the top&quot; and that pubs should continue to operate but with social distancing measures in place. After criticism regarding the shutdown of all pubs due to the spread of COVID-19, Martin addressed his 40,000 employees by video message. He acknowledged the government would pay 80 per cent of the wages of staff at companies who have lost work during the crisis, but he said the money could take weeks to come through. Martin suggested that if some staff were offered jobs in supermarkets they should consider taking them and promised that he would give first preference to those who wanted to come back to Wetherspoons. A number of newspapers inaccurately reported Martin&#x27;s suggestion, but later issued corrections. The majority of staff were placed on the Government furlough scheme after its announcement.

On 19 January 2022, in a statement to the London Stock Exchange, Martin accused the Prime Minister Boris Johnson of &quot;hypocrisy&quot; over the &quot;Partygate&quot; scandal, arguing that much of the controversy would have been avoided if Downing Street staff had been able to visit pubs which, at the time of the alleged lockdown parties, were closed due to coronavirus restrictions.

===Cost of living crisis===
Commenting in June 2023 on the effects of the cost-of-living crisis in the UK, Martin remarked that increasing costs in the British brewing industry may result in raised prices to consumers, and suggested that the price of a pint of beer could reach £8 or more. He also expressed concerns that breweries may consider watering down beer to gain tax breaks.

In November 2024, Martin claimed that pubgoers should expect prices to go up as a result of Labour’s budget. This is due to increased business pressures from the increased national minimum wage and employers’ national insurance contributions.

==Personal life==
Martin is married to Felicity (née Owen), whom he met while at university; they have four children and live in Exeter, Devon.

In the 2024 New Year Honours, Martin was appointed Knight Bachelor for services to hospitality and culture.

<text>West Virginia Public Broadcasting (WVPB) is the public television and radio state network serving the U.S. state of West Virginia. It is owned by the West Virginia Public Broadcasting Authority, an agency of the state government that holds the licenses for all Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and National Public Radio (NPR) member stations licensed in West Virginia. It is headquartered in Charleston with studios in Morgantown and Beckley.

On January 1, 2015, West Virginia PBS and West Virginia Public Radio merged their brands, branding exclusively as &quot;West Virginia Public Broadcasting&quot; across radio and television.

==Television==
The first public television station in West Virginia signed on July 14, 1969 under the callsign WMUL-TV, broadcasting from Marshall University in Huntington. In 1981, WMUL-TV changed its call letters to WPBY-TV; two years later, the public station at West Virginia University in Morgantown, WWVU-TV, was renamed WNPB-TV. WPBY-TV and WNPB-TV received their new call letters to underline that the operations were managed by the state educational broadcasting authority, and not the university system. In 1992, the state completed a microwave link that permitted it to convert WNPB and the state&#x27;s third PBS station, WSWP-TV in Grandview to become repeaters of WPBY-TV in Huntington and form a state network. On January 5, 2015, WPBY-TV changed its call letters to WVPB-TV as part of an effort to unify all of West Virginia Public Broadcasting&#x27;s services under a single brand; the television network had previously been branded as &quot;West Virginia PBS&quot;, a name that was phased out starting on January 1, 2015.

The state network has a total of five low-powered repeaters serving other areas out of the range of the three full-powered stations, most notably Wheeling and Parkersburg. Three directly repeat WNPB, one repeats WVPB and one repeats WSWP.

In the past the network showed some Marshall University and West Virginia University sports content, but has abandoned this practice due to Conference USA/Big 12 exclusivity agreements with commercial and cable outlets.

The current local content consists of a daily recap of the state legislative session, shows produced by the West Virginia University medical school, and student produced news from campus weekly products from Marshall University and West Virginia State University. It also broadcasts original documentaries on West Virginia history and culture, as well as live musical performances of &quot;Mountain Stage&quot; and the West Virginia Music Hall of Fame.

The combined footprint of WVPB&#x27;s television network covers almost all of West Virginia, as well as portions of Kentucky, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia. It is carried on the basic tier of all cable systems in West Virginia.

===TV stations===
Notes:
====Translators====
On June 1, 2016, West Virginia Public Broadcasting announced a plan to shut down five of its translators — W07DN-D, W08EE-D, W09CT-D, W30CO-D, and W41AO — due to state budget cuts and changes in viewing habits. All five translators were originally planned to be taken silent for a year in order to determine a long-term plan. Operations on W08EE-D (Martinsburg) and W30CO-D (Wheeling) resumed on August 10, 2016, while the licenses for W07DN-D (Wardensville), W09CT-D (Mathias), and W41AO (Hampshire) were surrendered to the FCC for cancellation on May 26, 2017.

==Digital television==
===Subchannels===
All digital signals are multiplexed:

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
West Virginia Public Broadcasting&#x27;s TV stations shut down their analog signals on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital channel allocations post-transition are as follows:
* WPBY-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 33; the station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 34, using virtual channel 33.
* WSWP-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 9; the station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 53, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition, to VHF channel 10, using virtual channel 9.
* WNPB-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 24; the station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 33, using virtual channel 24.

==Radio==

WVPB&#x27;s state radio network includes eleven full-powered stations and seven low-powered translators, all on the FM band. The state network carries programs from NPR, PRI and other distributors, as well as classical and folk music. WVPB produces original weekly programs, including &quot;EclecTopia&quot;, &quot;A Change of Tune&quot;, &quot;Inside Appalachia&quot; and &quot;Sidetracks&quot;, plus the nationally distributed &quot;Mountain Stage&quot;. The network was known as &quot;West Virginia Public Radio&quot; until WVPB&#x27;s 2015 transition to a single brand.

===FM stations===
Notes:
====Translators====
In addition to five low-powered, separate-frequency translators, two low-powered boosters also extend coverage. Boosters are licensed on the same frequency as the parent station but at a different location. They are given the same callsign as the parent station with a number added to differentiate the transmitter site.

==Website and online services==
West Virginia Public Broadcasting maintains a website with West Virginia news and free access to original video and audio productions. It also provides its videos through its YouTube page.

WVPB also operates a free website with educational videos and games for teachers, parents and students called West Virginia LearningMedia, part of PBS LearningMedia.

<doc id="1278881" wikidata="Q2253235" url="?curid=1278881" title="Sandomierz Voivodeship">
<text>Sandomierz Voivodeship (, ) was a unit of administration and local government in Poland from the 14th century to the partitions of Poland in 1772–1795. It was part of the Lesser Poland region and the Lesser Poland Province. Originally Sandomierz Voivodeship also covered the area around Lublin, but in 1474 its three eastern counties were organized into Lublin Voivodeship. In the 16th century, it had 374 parishes, 100 towns and 2586 villages. The voivodeship was based on the Sandomierz &quot;ziemia&quot;, which earlier was the Duchy of Sandomierz. The Duchy of Sandomierz was created in 1138 by King Bolesław III Wrymouth, who in his testament divided Poland into five principalities. One of them, with the capital at Sandomierz, was assigned to Krzywousty&#x27;s son, Henry of Sandomierz. Later on, with southern part of the Seniorate Province (which emerged into the Duchy of Kraków), the Duchy of Sandomierz created Lesser Poland, divided into Kraków and Sandomierz Voivodeships.

Sandomierz Voivodeship was also one of the voivodeships of Congress Poland. Created in 1816 from the Radom Department, in 1837 it was transformed into the Sandomierz Governorate.

==14th century – 1795==
===Boundaries===
Sandomierz Voivodeship in its original shape was one of the largest provinces of the Kingdom of Poland. After Lublin Voivodeship was created out of its eastern territories, the province stretched from Białobrzegi in the north, to the area north of Krosno in the south (the town of Krosno itself belonged to Red Ruthenia). It included such cities and towns of contemporary Poland, as Dębica, Dęblin, Iłża, Kielce, Kolbuszowa, Końskie, Kozienice, Lipsko, Mielec, Nisko, Opoczno, Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski, Pińczów, Pionki, Radom, Ropczyce, Ryki, Stalowa Wola, Starachowice, Staszów, Szydłowiec, Tarnów, Tarnobrzeg and Włoszczowa. The shape of the voivodeship remained unchanged from 1474 to the first partition of Poland (1772), when the Habsburg monarchy annexed the area south of the Vistula, with Dębica, Kolbuszowa, Mielec, Nisko and Tarnów.

Zygmunt Gloger in his monumental book Historical Geography of the Lands of Old Poland gives a detailed description of Sandomierz Voivodeship:

“Duke Boleslaw Krzywousty, before his death in 1138, divided Poland between his four sons, giving Henryk the Land of Sandomierz together with the Land of Lublin. The Duchy of Sandomierz was thus created (...)

During the reign of Wladyslaw Lokietek, the duchy was turned into a large voivodeship. In ca. 1471, the Land of Lublin was separated from it (...) The area of Sandomierz Voivodeship was 467 square miles, with 374 Roman Catholic parishes, 100 towns, and 2,586 villages. In 1397 left bank part of the province was divided into three counties – Sandomierz, Radom and Checiny. In the early 16th century the voivodeship had 9 counties: Sandomierz, Wislica, Checiny, Opoczno, Radom, Szydłów, Stezyca, Pilzno and Tarnów. By late 16th century, Tarnow county was annexed by Pilzno county, while Szydlow county was divided between Wislica and Sandomierz (...)

Sandomierz Voivodeship had nine senators: the voivode and the castellan of Sandomierz, and castellans of Wislica, Radom, Zawichost, Żarnów, Malogoszcz, Połaniec and Czchow. The voivodeship had several starostas, who resided in such towns, as Sandomierz, Radom, Checiny, Opoczno, Nowy Korczyn, Stezyca, Wislica, Pilzno, Stopnica, Solec nad Wisla, Zawichost, Szydlow, Przedborz, Ropczyce, Ryczywol, Radoszyce, Ryki, Zwolen, Gołąb and others. Local sejmiks took place at Opatow, at which seven deputies to the Sejm were elected, as well as two deputies to the Lesser Poland Tribunal in Lublin (...)

The soil in the northern part of the voivodeship was sandy, while in its center and south it was very rich. In the area of Opatow, famous wheat was produced, called sandomierka or opatowka. There also were large forests, as well as deposits of marble, copper, iron and lime (...) Among oldest urban centers of Sandomierz Voivodeship were Sandomierz, Wislica, Nowy Korczyn, Zawichost, Radom. Main castles were at Chrobrze, Osiek, Ilza, Checiny, Janowiec nad Wisla. Most important monasteries were at Lysa Gora, Sieciechow, Opatow, Wachock and Koprzywnica&quot;.

== 1939 ==

Sandomierz Voivodeship was also a proposed voivodeship of Second Polish Republic, which never was created because of the Nazi and Soviet invasion of Poland in September 1939. The idea of creation of this unit was the brainchild of Minister of Industry and Trade Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski, and it was directly linked with creation of one of the biggest economic projects of interbellum Poland, Central Industrial Region. It was to cover south-central Poland, and most probably, it was to be created in late 1939. Its projected size was 24.500 square kilometers, and it was to incorporate 20 or 21 powiats.

<text>Ian Laperrière (born January 19, 1974) is a Canadian-American former professional ice hockey winger who played 16 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) and serves as the current head coach for the Lehigh Valley Phantoms, the American Hockey League affiliate and primary development team for the Philadelphia Flyers of the NHL.

Laperrière spent nine seasons of his NHL career with the Los Angeles Kings and also played with the St. Louis Blues, New York Rangers, Colorado Avalanche, and Philadelphia Flyers prior to his 2012 retirement.

==Playing career==

As a youth, Laperrière played in the 1988 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Montreal.

Laperrière played in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) from 1990 to 1993 and was drafted by the St. Louis Blues of the NHL in the seventh round and pick number 158 in the 1992 draft. He made his NHL debut with the Blues on March 3, 1994. On December 8, 1995, he was traded to the New York Rangers for Stéphane Matteau. On March 14, 1996, he was traded with Ray Ferraro, Mattias Norström, Nathan LaFayette, and a draft pick to the Los Angeles Kings in exchange for Jari Kurri, Marty McSorley and Shane Churla. Laperrière was a mainstay on the Kings roster from 1996 until 2004. On July 2, 2004, Laperrière signed a free agent contract with the Colorado Avalanche.

Laperrière, affectionately known as &#x27;Lappy&#x27; to his fans, was an immediate success with Colorado in the 2005–06 NHL season, posting the best points totals of his career. He scored 21 goals and 24 assists for 45 points, far ahead of his previous bests of 13 goals and 14 assists for 27 points in the lockout-shortened 1994–95 NHL season. He quickly became a favorite with the Avalanche fans.

Laperrière scored the 100th goal of his career on October 29, 2006, against the Minnesota Wild. He also passed 800 career games on November 28, against the Calgary Flames in a 5–2 loss.

On April 1, 2009, Laperrière fought with David Hale of the Phoenix Coyotes for his 52nd hockey fight in an Avalanche jersey, passing Scott Parker in all-time franchise fighting majors. He was announced as the Avalanches&#x27; Masterton Trophy nominee for the 2008–09 season on April 3, 2009. He played in his 1000th NHL game on April 11, 2009, against the Vancouver Canucks in a 0–1 home overtime loss. He led the team that year with 163 penalty minutes, just one more minute than Cody McLeod.

Unable to agree to a new deal with the Avalanche, Laperrière signed a three-year contract with the Philadelphia Flyers on July 1, 2009.

On November 27, 2009, Laperrière was hit with a slapshot in the mouth while killing a penalty at the end of the first period against the Buffalo Sabres. He sat out the second period receiving between 50 and 100 stitches but returned for the third period. He also played the following night against the Atlanta Thrashers. Laperrière lost seven teeth resulting from the incident (two fake and five real). A similar event occurred during the 2010 Stanley Cup playoffs on April 22. Laperrière was hit in the face near the end of a New Jersey power play, resulting in an orbital injury, and a mild concussion. Laperrière was listed as out indefinitely and his return to the playoffs was considered unlikely. However, after missing the Flyers second round series versus the Boston Bruins, he returned for game 4 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Montreal Canadiens. In the May 2010 edition of &quot;The Hockey News&quot;, Laperrière was awarded THN&#x27;s John Ferguson Award for &quot;Toughest Player in the NHL&quot; in the 2009–10 season.

==Post-playing career==

===NHL retirement===
During training camp in September 2010, Laperrière experienced symptoms of post-concussion syndrome and nerve damage to his eyes from being hit in the face twice by pucks the previous season. He was then out for the entire 2010–11 season after being put on injured reserve before the season began and then on long-term injured reserve in mid-December to free up salary cap space. Doctors advised Laperrière to retire, although he did not do so at the time. The move was repeated again for the season to free up cap space when Laperrière&#x27;s symptoms still had not subsided. His number 14 was reissued to rookie Sean Couturier. Despite never playing again after the 2010 Stanley Cup Finals, Laperrière continued to serve the Flyers off the ice as a mentor to younger players in the organization and in other capacities. For that, Laperrière was awarded the 2011 Bill Masterton Trophy for his perseverance in the sport of hockey. Laperrière officially retired June 12, 2012.

===Philadelphia Flyers===
On June 29, 2012, Laperrière was named director of player development for the Philadelphia Flyers. The following year, in 2013, he also began serving as an assistant coach for the Flyers. 

===Lehigh Valley Phantoms head coach===

On June 5, 2021, Laperrière was named head coach of the Lehigh Valley Phantoms, the American Hockey League affiliate of the Philadelphia Flyers and the primary development team for the Flyers..

==Personal life==
Laperrière is married to Magali and has two sons: Tristan, born in March 2002, and Zachary, born in April 2004.

He was sworn in as a naturalized American citizen on August 30, 2011, in a ceremony in Mount Laurel, New Jersey.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=587516&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his retirement from hockey, he turned his attention to triathlon completing the Ironman North American Championship at Mont-Tremblant in the Laurentian Mountains in 12 hours, 11 minutes, 55 seconds on August 19, 2013. He also ran the Philadelphia Marathon in 2012.

Laperrière and his family live in Haddonfield, New Jersey.

===Films===
*In 2005, Laperrière portrayed Montreal Canadiens Hall of Famer Bernie &quot;Boom Boom&quot; Geoffrion in &quot;The Rocket&quot;, a film about the life of Maurice Richard who played with the Canadiens from 1942 to 1960.

*In 2012, Laperrière appeared in the movie &quot;This Is 40&quot; alongside Scott Hartnell, James van Riemsdyk, and Matt Carle.

<doc id="1278947" wikidata="Q3482561" url="?curid=1278947" title="Shoulders (band)">
<text>Shoulders was a highly popular alternative rock band in Austin, Texas in the 1990s; occasionally they still give performances. Shoulders toured nationally and throughout Europe, and they were especially well known in France and other European countries. Their material, written almost entirely by lead singer Michael Slattery and guitarist Todd Kassens, has been called &quot;drunken carnival music,&quot; but it was wide-ranging, from hard rock to gentle ballads, from sea shanties to French cabaret music to Irish drinking songs.

Shoulders&#x27; lineup included Slattery, who sang and played everything from a huge parade drum which he also used as a trampoline to the &quot;harmonica, out-of-tune cornet, hideous trombone, bent tin whistle,&quot; and &quot;free-hanging river pipe&quot;; Kassens on the guitars; Alan Gene Williams on the drums; and Chris Black on bass, piano, and organ. They were frequently accompanied by the well-known Austin cellist John Hagen, who plays in Lyle Lovett&#x27;s large band. Shoulders&#x27; first album, &quot;Trashman Shoes&quot;, rose to the top of the rock charts in France. Their second was &quot;The Fun Never Stops&quot;, which did well in Europe but never attained the success of &quot;Trashman Shoes&quot;.

Shoulders frequently played at the &quot;Hole in the Wall&quot; at the top of the Drag on Guadalupe in Austin, and for several years they played regularly at Austin&#x27;s famous acoustic club the Cactus Cafe.

<doc id="1278953" wikidata="Q478965" url="?curid=1278953" title="Vizzini">
<text>Vizzini is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the Metropolitan City of Catania, on the island of Sicily, southern Italy. It is located from Catania in the Hyblaean Mountains, on the most northwesterly slopes of Monte Lauro.

The commune territory is bounded by the comuni of Buccheri, Francofonte, Giarratana, Licodia Eubea, Militello in Val di Catania, Mineo.

== History ==
Bidis, a Roman city mentioned by Pliny and Cicero, stood here in a territory that has been inhabited since prehistoric times.

The modern town developed in the Middle Ages around a now non-extant castle, as a fief of various lords, including the Chiaromontes and the Schittinos, although for many years it was also part of the royal domain.

In 1358, Roland of Sicily reconquered the area from Vizzini to Avola.

In 1415, the Jewish community of Vizzini was expelled by Queen Blanca, and was never permitted to return.

On the 14th of July, 1943 the town of Vizzini was liberated from fascist forces by the British military. Specifically, by that time Vizzini was occupied by a small detachment of forces from Nazi Germany. Britain&#x27;s XXX Corps under General Montgomery consisting largely of M4 Sherman Tanks easily overpowered the small group of German tanks that were present in the town. The town had been in the American occupational zone and this caused some confusion when British forces liberated the town first.

== Main sights ==

The Arab layout of the town is evident seen passing from Via Verga to Via San Gregorio Magno and proceeding as far as Largo della Matrice, a square with a modern statue of St Gregory in the middle and the Chiesa Madre (mother church) of San Gregorio Magno at one side.

The portal on the left flank of the church, in splendid 15th-century Gothic-Catalan style, probably derived from the old Town Hall, destroyed by the earthquake in 1693; in the interior there are late 18th century stuccos and a wooden ceiling by Natale Bonaiuto, as well as two paintings (&quot;The Martyrdom of St. Laurence&quot; and the &quot;Madonna delle Mercede&quot;) by Filippo Paladini (or Paladino), born in Florence about 1544. Another painting by Paladino, &quot;The Deposition&quot; (1607), is in the Chiesa del Convento dei Cappuccini.

Nearby is the church of Sant&#x27;Agata, rebuilt in the 18th century on the site of a previous 15th-century building and houses a pipe organ created around 1770.

The church of San Giovanni Battista was built in the 18th century. The stuccos decorating the interior are by Natale Bonaiuto.

The front of the church of Santa Teresa is said to be the setting for scenes from Cavalleria Rusticana, the libretto of which is based on the play of the same name by Giovanni Verga, who lived in Vizzini for a time.

The statue depicting the &quot;Madonna and Child&quot; (1527) in the Chiesa dei Minori Osservanti was sculpted by Antonello Gagini.

<text>Minto was a provincial electoral division in the Canadian province of Manitoba. It was created by redistribution in 1999, and has formally existed since the provincial election of 1999. The riding is located in the centre of the City of Winnipeg.

Minto was created primarily from territory from the old St. James riding, with some additional territory from Wellington as well. In many respects, the riding may be regarded as a successor to the St. James riding which existed before 1999.

Minto was bordered on the east by Point Douglas, to the north by Wellington, to the south by Wolseley, and to the west by the current St. James riding.

The riding&#x27;s population in 1996 was 20,479. In 1999, the average family income was $37,037, and the unemployment rate was 13.80%. Thirty-seven per cent of the riding&#x27;s residents are listed as low-income, one of the highest rates in the province. Twenty-two per cent of families in the riding are single-parent.

Minto has an immigrant population of 33%, the highest in the province. Sixteen per cent of the riding&#x27;s residents are Filipino, 7% Portuguese, 3% Chinese and 2% Italian. The aboriginal population in the riding is 14%.

Manufacturing accounts for 25% of Minto&#x27;s industry, with a further 19% in the service sector.

<doc id="1278957" wikidata="Q1951055" url="?curid=1278957" title="Mousehole">
<text>Mousehole (; ) is a village and fishing port in Cornwall, England, UK. It is approximately south of Penzance on the shore of Mount&#x27;s Bay. The village is in the civil parish of Penzance. An islet called St Clement&#x27;s Isle lies about offshore from the harbour entrance.

Mousehole lies within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). 27% of Cornwall has AONB designation, with the same status and protection as a National Park.

==History==
The first mention of the village of &quot;Mousehole&quot; is in 1283 and the first mention of &quot;Portheness&quot; is in 1267. Although usually thought of as the same place, a document from 1309 names &quot;Porthenys juxta Mousehole&quot; (i.e., next to Mousehole), implying two separate places. Compare with nearby Newlyn which is separated by a stream from Tolcarne and both were once considered individual places. There is also a 1339 document naming &quot;Porthengrous juxta Porthenes&quot; (harbour by the cross, next to the harbour by the island). If the amount of tax collected is indicative of how important a place was, in the 14th century, tax collected on the number of fishing boats from Mousehole was £5. Nearby Marazion paid £1 6s 8d, Newlyn £1, Penzance 12s and Porthgwarra and Penberth 12s. There were three medieval chapels, including the one on St Clement&#x27;s island. In 1383 a chapel was dedicated to &quot;the Blessed Virgin Mary&quot; and was in ruins by 1414 due to storms. It was rebuilt around 1420 and finally destroyed during the Reformation. Another chapel was licensed in 1441 and dedicated to St Edward the Confessor.

Records show that pilchards were exported to France as early as 1302, and in the late 18th century there were five seines and 55 boats based in the harbour. In the 1880s there was still a drift pilchard fishery and in the autumn around sixty boats fished in the North Sea.

Along with Marazion, it was one of the principal ports of Mount&#x27;s Bay until the 16th century. Before its decline as a major commercial centre, Mousehole also had a number of fairs and markets, including the charter for a market on Tuesdays, with a fair for three days at the festival of St Barnabas, granted to Henry de Tyes in 1292. Mousehole, like many communities in Mount&#x27;s Bay, fell within the authority of the Manor of Alverton; all early charters, fairs etc. associated with Mousehole are associated with this manorial estate.

Mousehole, like Penzance, Newlyn and Paul, was attacked in the 1595 raid on Mount&#x27;s Bay by Spaniard Carlos de Amésquita, the only surviving building being the &#x27;Keigwin Arms&#x27;, a local pub. Outside the Keigwin Arms (now a private residence) is a plaque with the wording &quot;Squire Jenkyn Keigwin was killed here 23 July 1595 defending this house against the Spaniards&quot;.

===20th century===

Although a lifeboat had been available in Mount&#x27;s Bay for many years, a new lifeboat station at Penlee Point, on the outskirts of the village, was opened in 1913. On 19 December 1981 the entire lifeboat crew of eight was lost during an attempted rescue in hurricane-force winds. The lifeboat was moved to Newlyn in 1983 but continues to be known as the &quot;Penlee Lifeboat&quot;.

The village&#x27;s harbourside was once the location of the Lobster Pot guest house, in which Dylan Thomas and Caitlin Macnamara spent their honeymoon after marrying at Penzance register office.

In 1936 the GPO Film Unit made &quot;The Saving of Bill Blewitt&quot;, a short film to promote the Post Office Savings Bank, featuring local postman Bill Blewitt.

Mousehole hosts a vibrant variety of festivals and community activities. It is known for its Christmas illuminations. Since 1981, every 19 December the lights have been turned off in memory of the victims of the lifeboat disaster. Tom Bawcock&#x27;s Eve is a unique celebration held on 23 December each year to celebrate the ending of a famine in the 16th century by local resident Tom Bawcock. This festival is the inspiration behind the book &quot;The Mousehole Cat&quot; by Antonia Barber and the associated television productions. This festival is also the origin of stargazy pie, a mixed fish, egg and potato pie with fish heads protruding through the pastry. Mousehole also holds a small maritime festival every two years called &#x27;Sea, Salt and Sail&#x27;.

Parts of the 1995 feature film &quot;Blue Juice&quot; were filmed in the village. The local community radio station is Coast FM (formerly Penwith Radio), which broadcasts on 96.5 and 97.2 FM.

=== Local government ===
Mousehole was part of the ancient parish of Paul, and from 1866 part of the civil parish of Paul. In 1894 Mousehole became part of Paul Urban District. The urban district was abolished in 1934 and Mousehole was absorbed into the municipal borough of Penzance. Penzance Municipal Borough was itself abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, and Mousehole became part of the new Penwith District. The former borough was unparished until 1980. The unparished area was formed into a civil parish in 1980, and the new Penzance parish council elected to call itself a town council. Penwith District was abolished in 2009, and Mousehole now falls under the unitary Cornwall Council.

=== Sport ===
There is a football team based nearby named Mousehole A.F.C., currently playing in the Southern league.

==Notable residents==
Penwith is believed to be the last part of Cornwall where the Cornish language was spoken as the community language. Dolly Pentreath, popularly known as the last recorded speaker of Cornish, is often reported as being from Mousehole and as having a memorial in the village. In fact, she was from Paul (the parish of Paul historically included Mousehole).

A year after Dolly Pentreath died in 1777, Daines Barrington received a letter, written in Cornish and accompanied by an English translation, from a fisherman in Mousehole named William Bodinar stating that he knew of five people who could speak Cornish in that village alone. Barrington also speaks of a John Nancarrow from Marazion who was a native speaker and survived into the 1790s.

John Keigwin (1641–1716), a scholar in the Cornish language, William Carvosso (1750–1834), the Methodist, and Joseph Trewavas VC CGM (14 December 1835 – 20 July 1905) were also born in Mousehole.

Admiral of the fleet Sir Caspar John GCB (1903–1984) lived in Mousehole in retirement. The artist Jack Pender (1918–1998) was born in Mousehole and spent most of his career there. English writer and illustrator Michelle Cartlidge lives in Mousehole.

The potter Jack Doherty lives in Mousehole where he has his studio.
