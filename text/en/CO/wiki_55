<text>North Khorasan province () is one of the 31 provinces of Iran, located in the northeast of the country. Its capital is the city of Bojnord.

North Khorasan is one of the three provinces that were created after the division of Khorasan in 2004. Khorasan was the largest province of Iran until it was divided into three provinces on September 29, 2004. The provinces approved by the parliament of Iran (on May 18, 2004) and the Council of Guardians (on May 29, 2004) were Razavi Khorasan, North Khorasan, and South Khorasan. In 2014 it was placed in Region 5.

== History ==
Greater Khorasan has witnessed the rise and fall of many dynasties and governments in its territory throughout history. Various tribes of Persians, Arabs, Turks, Kurds and Turkmens have brought change to the region time and time again.

Ancient geographers of Iran divided Iran into eight segments, of which the largest was the territory of Greater Khorasan. Esfarayen, among other cities of the province, was one of the focal points for settlement by Aryan tribes entering Iran.

The Parthian empire was based near Merv in Khorasan for many years. In Parthian times, Esfarayen was one of the important villages of Nishapur.

During the Sassanid dynasty, the province was governed by a &quot;Spahbod&quot; (Lieutenant General) called &quot;Padgoosban&quot; and four margraves, each commander of one of the four parts of the province.

In the year 651, the army of Islamic Arabs invaded Khorasan. The territory remained in the hands of the Abbasid clan until 820, followed by the rule of the Iranian Taherid clan in the year 896 and the Samanid dynasty in 900. Khorasan was divided into four parts during the Muslim conquest of Persia, each section being named after the four largest cities; Nishapur, Merv, Herat, and Balkh.

Mahmud of Ghazni conquered Khorasan in 994 and in the year 1037 Tuğrul Beg, the first of the Seljuq empire rulers, conquered Nishapur.

Mahmud Qaznavi retaliated against the invaders several times, and finally, the Qaznavi Turks defeated Sultan Sanjar. But there was more to come, as in 1157 Khorasan was conquered by the Khwarazmids. In 1220 was annexed by the Mongols of Genghis Khan. When in 1226 the great conqueror finally died, Khorasan was inherited by his son Tolui and then by Tolui&#x27;s son Hulegu, the first emperor of the Mongolic Ilkhanate of Persia.

In the 14th century, a flag of independence was hoisted by the Sarbedaran movement in Sabzevar, and in 1368, Khorasan came into the hands of Tamerlane.

In 1507, Khorasan was occupied by Uzbek tribes. After the death of Nader Shah in 1747, it was occupied by the Afghans.

In 1824, Herat became independent for several years when the Afghan Empire was split between the Durranis and Barakzais. The Persians sieged the city in 1837, but the British assisted the Afghans in repelling them. In 1856, the Persians launched another invasion, and briefly managed to recapture the city; it led directly to the Anglo-Persian War. In 1857 hostilities between the Persians and the British ended after the Treaty of Paris was signed, and the Persian troops withdrew from Herat. Afghanistan reconquered Herat in 1863 under Dost Muhammad Khan, two weeks before his death.

==Demographics==
===Language and ethnicity===
North Khorasan province is one of the most diverse territories in Iran today, largely reflecting the ethnic make-up of Iran. Most people in North Khorasan are Shia Muslims, who are often Khorasani Kurds, Persians, Khorasani Turks and so on, although there is also a small minority of Sunnis who generally are Turkmen. There used to be a sizeable population of Lurs inhabiting this province, however, most returned to their native area in western Iran as there are no signs of them in the province today.

Previously, there was a sizable community of Arabs who settled in the area during the Arab invasion of Iran. However, by 1875 they had intermarried so extensively with Persians and Turks that they were indistinguishable, having largely abandoned the Arab language and culture in favour of the local one.

===Population===
At the time of the 2006 National Census, the province&#x27;s population was 791,930 in 198,626 households. The following census in 2011 counted 867,727 people in 240,885 households. The 2016 census measured the population of the province as 863,092 in 254,747 households.

<text>Piazza delle Erbe (Market&#x27;s square) is a square in Verona, northern Italy. It was once the town&#x27;s forum during the time of the Roman Empire.
==Description==
The northern side of the square is occupied by the ancient town hall, the Torre dei Lamberti, the &quot;Casa dei Giudici&quot; (&quot;Judges&#x27; Hall&quot;) and the frescoed Mazzanti Houses. The western side, the shortest one, features the Baroque Palazzo Maffei, decorated by statues of Greek gods. It is faced by a white marble column, on which is St. Mark&#x27;s Lion, symbol of the Republic of Venice.

The north-western side occupies the site of the ancient Roman Capitol Hill, which looked towards the forum. Numerous of its buildings facing the square have maintained façade frescoes. On the southern side is the crenellated &quot;Casa dei Mercanti&quot; (&quot;House of the Merchants&quot;, also known as &quot;Domus Mercatorum&quot;), now the seat of the Banca Popolare di Verona. Other buildings, the tall houses of the Ghetto, are reminiscent of medieval tower-houses.

The square&#x27;s most ancient monument is the fountain (built in 1368 by Cansignorio della Scala), surmounted by a statue called &quot;Madonna Verona&quot;, which is however a Roman sculpture dating to 380 AD. Also historical is the &quot;capitello&quot;, dating to the 13th century, during which it was used for several ceremonies, including the oath of investment of the city&#x27;s medieval podestà and pretors. Towards Via Cappello is another column, with a 14th-century aedicula with reliefs of the Virgin and the Saints Zeno, Peter and Christopher.

<doc id="1289304" wikidata="Q407675" url="?curid=1289304" title="Air Niugini">
<text>Air Niugini Limited is the flag carrier of Papua New Guinea, based in Air Niugini House on the site of Port Moresby International Airport, Port Moresby. It operates a domestic network from Port Moresby to 12 major airports while its subsidiary company, Link PNG, operates routes to minor airports. It also operates international services in Asia, Oceania, and Australia on a weekly basis. Its main base is Port Moresby International Airport, which is located in 7 Mile, Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea. &quot;Niugini&quot; is the Tok Pisin word for &quot;New Guinea&quot;.

== History ==


The airline was established in November 1973 as the national airline of Papua New Guinea with the government holding 60% of the shares, with the rest divided between Australian airline companies Ansett (16%), Qantas (12%) and Trans Australia Airlines (TAA) (12%). It started as an exclusively domestic carrier, but soon expanded to offer international services. In founding the airline, the government aimed to encourage regional development in a country without an extensive road network. The airline was established using DC-3 and Fokker F27 aircraft.

In 1975 when PNG gained independence, pilots from the two airlines operating for the government were from Ansett Australia and Trans Australia Airlines. The majority of these pilots elected to return to these companies and continue their careers in Australia. This left a huge shortage in the pilot strength (over 95%) and consequently replacements were recruited from both Australia and New Zealand. These pilots had little or no experience in airline operations and few if any skills or experience operating in the extremely hostile environs of PNG.

Nonetheless, they were trained by the outgoing pilots from Ansett and TAA and with the first class training behind them continued to provide safe and reliable services to all of PNG. When Air Niugini took over the international routes - then operated by Qantas - once again the senior pilots were called upon to convert from basic turboprop aircraft (F27) to B707-338C 4-engine jet aircraft. Considerable alarm was expressed that these &quot;jungle pilots&quot; could not possibly operate large jet aircraft hitherto flown by Qantas flight crews. Again with excellent training and support from Qantas, the PX crews converted successfully to the venerable B707 and from there took over all the check and training on those two aircraft and continued thereafter to the various replacement aircraft being primarily A300-B4, A310-300, B757 and B767.

There were two crashes internally on the domestic operation with the total loss of one F28 aircraft and one DHC7, both due to pilot error. No deaths or injuries occurred in either crash.

International services commenced very early on in the history of the airline with a leased Boeing 720 from 6 February 1976 to 2 February 1977. This was later replaced with a Boeing 707 purchased from Qantas. During the late 1970s, internal services were performed by a combination of Fokker F28 jet and Fokker F27 turbo-prop aircraft. By the end of 1975 Air Niugini leased Boeing 727-200 type aircraft from Ansett and TAA to serve routes to Brisbane. The airline also acquired a lease of a Boeing 707 from Qantas to commence a weekly service to Manila and Hong Kong. In 1976, the government bought out the Qantas and TAA holdings and in 1980 acquired the Ansett shares to make the airline wholly government owned. The fleet of F-27s was phased out in the early 1980s with the introduction of the newly developed de Havilland Canada Dash 7 four-engine turbo-prop.

In 1979, Air Niugini opened routes to Honolulu and to Singapore via Jakarta. That same year, new facilities were opened at Jacksons Airport and new Sales Offices opened in Hong Kong, Tokyo, Europe and the United States.
Air Niugini operated their Boeing 707 from Auckland to Hong Kong via Port Moresby in a tripartite agreement with Air New Zealand and Cathay Pacific. This service ran from 1981 to 1985.

In 1984, the airline replaced the two Boeing 707 aircraft with an Airbus A300 on lease from TAA. This was replaced several years later with two Airbus A310s as the carrier expanded to offer flights principally between Australian Eastern capital cities and destinations in Asia such as Singapore and Manila via their hub Port Moresby.

The airline endured considerable hardships in the 1990s, with unrest in Bougainville and a volcanic eruption in Rabaul destabilising the company&#x27;s busiest domestic services. The Asian currency crisis also made an impact, with Air Niugini posting financial losses during this decade. The government of Papua New Guinea responded by cutting jobs from the airline, suppressing wages, as well as opening offices in Asia and Europe in an attempt at having the airline run profitably. The reforms bore fruit by 2003, with the airline posting a profit of US$15.8 million for that year.

A Boeing 767 was acquired in August 2002, replacing the Airbus aircraft, and was used to offer expanded international services. Combined with aggressive pricing, this made it the most competitively priced airline on many of its routes. A sharing agreement still exists with Qantas in which that airline buys &quot;blocks&quot; of seats on Air Niugini&#x27;s flights between Port Moresby and Australia.

The financial turnaround seems to have stymied pressure from various sectors, including the IMF and the Australian Government, to privatise the national carrier. The PNG government has voiced concerns that privatisation would jeopardise domestic routes that provide a vital service to regional people and encourage economic development, but which fail to realise a profit.

From September 2004, Fokker 100s have been introduced to start to replace the aging Fokker F28 aircraft that are used on domestic routes, the daily Cairns service, and the twice a week service to Honiara in the Solomon Islands.

In March 2006, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Don Polye announced an open air policy, which would allow other airlines to fly international routes into and from Papua New Guinea. The policy will take effect in 2007.

In December 2007, Air Niugini returned its leased Boeing 767 aircraft to its owners, Air New Zealand. The airline briefly entered a wet lease arrangement with Viva Macau before taking up a lease with Icelandair for a Boeing 767-300ER and a Boeing 757-200W. The 757 was returned in March 2011 and replaced with two additional 767-300ER aircraft.

On 18 April 2008, flights commenced on the Sydney-Port Moresby route initially using leased Embraer 190 aircraft leased from SkyAirWorld of Australia.

On 15 October 2014, Air Niugini announced a wholly owned subsidiary airline company, Link PNG, which commenced operations on 1 November 2014 to coincide with Air Niugini&#x27;s 41 years of operation. Link PNG principally services routes to provincial and district centres which were being operated by the Air Niugini Dash-8-Q200 and Q300 aircraft. 7 Fokker-70 aircraft were acquired (October 2015) from KLM and were transferred during Oct-Dec 2015.

In June 2018, people rioting in the town of Mendi following disputed election results destroyed a Link PNG Dash-8 at the town&#x27;s airport.

On 14 June 2019, Air Niugini announced it would take over the Cairns-Hong Kong route that Cathay Pacific was abandoning. They would fly via Port Moresby hoping to have considerable income derived from transporting live seafood to Asian markets.

In July 2023 Air Niugini announced the order of two Boeing 787-8 as replacements for their pair of aging 767-300ER. The airline ordered six Airbus A220-100s in November 2023, with a further two A220-100s and three A220-300s to be leased. The Airbus A220s will replace Air Niugini&#x27;s Fokker 70s and Fokker 100s. A SkyUp Airlines Boeing 737 was acquired under a wet lease in 2023.

== Incidents and accidents ==

On the morning of 28 September 2018, Flight PX 73 (operated by Boeing 737-800 P2-PXE) landed short of the runway into a lagoon off Chuuk International Airport in Weno, Chuuk of the Federated States of Micronesia. There were 47 people on board the aircraft (36 passengers and 11 crew). According to initial reports, all 47 survived, and there were no serious injuries. However, shortly after the crash, the airline reported one missing passenger. On Monday, 1 October, two days after the crash, Air Niugini announced the death of a single male passenger.

<text>Myron Reed &quot;Slim&quot; Brundage (November 29, 1903 – October 18, 1990) was the &quot;founder and janitor&quot; of the College of Complexes, a radical social center in Chicago during the 1950s. It was known as Chicago&#x27;s Number One &quot;beatnik bistro&quot;.

==Biography==
Slim Brundage was born at an insane asylum (a fact that he was proud of), where his mother worked, in Blackfoot, Idaho. His mother died when he was seven and his socialist journalist father placed him in an orphanage. His youth was troubled; he dropped out of grade school and ran away from home at age 14 to become a hobo. He changed his first name to Slim (given his body weight) and was educated at flophouses and boxcars across the country. Two years later, he became a member, and then organizer, of Industrial Workers of the World in Aberdeen, Washington. He thought the world would be better without bosses and politicians and was jailed for his protest activities.

In 1922, he settled in Chicago where he frequented forums on free speech; at the time, there were about 20 to 30 organizations. He worked as a bouncer and janitor of the Dil Pickle Club and later founded his own club, College of Complexes, in 1933 but closed after three months. Three years later, he became the director of the Hobo College. He reopened College of Complexes in 1951 with a $6,000 workman&#x27;s pension. In the 1950s, author James T. Farrell was one of the speakers before moving to New York City. The organization moved locations through the 1950s into the 1960s and the Chicago Police Department&#x27;s Red Squad unit visited them several times because of College of Complexes&#x27;s anti-Cold War stance. In 1960, the shop hosted a Beat Convention to nominate a Beat Party candidate for President of the United States. Brundage ran for the nomination himself and, though he provided a place to sleep and free food for beatniks from out of town, he did not succeed. He shut down the organization in 1961, retired to Guadalajara in 1975, and later moved to Southern California in 1980s.

Brundage was also a writer and poet closely associated with the Beats. &#x27;little theater&#x27; playwright/actor, president emeritus of the Hobo College in the 1930s, housepainter, humorist, and chief architect of the scandalous Beatnik Party during the 1960 elections. He called himself &quot;The Janitor&quot; because of his blue-collar background.

In 1997, Franklin Rosemont edited a collection entitled &quot;From Bughouse Square to the Beat Generation: Selected Ravings of Slim Brundage - Founder &amp; Janitor of the College of Complexes&quot;, published by the Charles H. Kerr Publishing Company as part of its Bughouse Square Series.

He was married to artist Margaret Brundage (née Johnson) from 1927 to 1939, and Katarine C. Wood from 1940. At age 86, in 1990, he died from a brain hemorrhage in El Cerrito, California, while attending a senior citizens&#x27; bingo party. He was buried at German Waldheim Cemetery.

<text>Cosgrove Hall is an early-18th-century Grade II listed country house in Cosgrove, Northamptonshire. It was built on the site of an earlier house by the Furtho family. It is not open to the public. It may have been built by John Lumley of Northampton. In the nineteenth century, the building belonged to John Christopher Mansel. In May 1945, Queen Geraldine of Albania, the Queen consort to King Zog I of Albania, opened a fête at the hall. The building was destroyed by fire in October 2016.

As well as the hall the other Grade II buildings on the estate are the dovecote, the stable block and the ice house. In front of the house, there is an excavated Roman bath house, viewable from the Grand Union Canal.

<text>Haymakers&#x27; Grounds was a baseball grounds in Lansingburgh, New York, which is now part of Troy, New York. It was home to the Troy Haymakers of the National Association from to and home to the Troy Trojans of the National League from to .

Most sources give the location of the ballpark as 104th Street (north); 2nd Avenue (west); 103rd Street (south); and 5th Avenue (east). Those streets were previously numbered 4th and 3rd. Before the streets were numbered, they had names: 2nd Avenue was State Street; 4th/104th was Vail Street; 3rd/103rd was Thomas Street; and 5th Avenue was Whipple Street. This is in the vicinity of the public park called Knickerbacker Park, which contains a monument outlining the history of Troy&#x27;s brief major league experience.

The streets were renumbered to correspond with Troy&#x27;s numbering system, and also the fact that some names were duplicated: For example, Troy has an east-west thoroughfare called State Street.

An alternate name for this location, as seen in some references, is &quot;the Vail Lot&quot; or &quot;Vail&#x27;s lot&quot;. The Vail family were early settlers of the area, and this location hosted baseball games starting in the 1860s.

The NL club played home games at Putnam Grounds, Troy, in 1879, and at Troy Ball Club Grounds, Watervliet, in 1882.

<text>Lufthansa Cargo [[Aktiengesellschaft|AG]] is a German cargo airline and a wholly owned subsidiary of Lufthansa. It operates worldwide air freight and logistics services and is headquartered at Frankfurt Airport, Lufthansa&#x27;s main hub. Besides operating dedicated cargo planes, the company also has access to cargo capacities of 350 passenger aircraft of the Lufthansa Group.

==History==

===Foundation and early years===
Recognizing the growing importance of the cargo business, Lufthansa established its cargo subsidiary in 1977 called German Cargo Services GmbH. Previously, cargo operations were executed in-house, under the &quot;Lufthansa Cargo&quot; name, when – in an effort to restructure the company – the cargo division was re-integrated into its parent, and split up into two parts (one for scheduled operations using Lufthansa-owned aircraft, and one for freight and logistics services using chartered or leased aircraft).

In 1996, Hinduja Cargo Services was founded as a joint venture between Hinduja Group and Lufthansa Cargo. The company operated a fleet of Boeing 727 freighters, flying from airports in the Indian subcontinent to feed Lufthansa Cargo&#x27;s hub at Sharjah International Airport. The airline suspended operations in 2000 in favour of direct services from Frankfurt using Lufthansa Cargo aircraft.

===Development since 2000===
In 2000, Lufthansa Cargo was a founding member of the WOW Alliance, a global cargo airline alliance, but left in 2007 as it did not see any benefits for the future.

In 2002 the special logistics company was founded, which was sold in the meantime, but is now again a wholly owned subsidiary of Lufthansa Cargo.

Lufthansa Cargo was created as a limited stock company on 30 November 2004, along with &quot;Lufthansa Cargo Charter&quot;. Lufthansa Cargo uses &quot;LH&quot; (the same IATA code as Lufthansa), as well as &quot;GEC&quot; (the former ICAO code of German Cargo) as airline codes.

As of 2007, Lufthansa Cargo used to operate a hub for intra-Asian flights at Astana International Airport in Kazakhstan, but was forced to relocate it to Yemelyanovo Airport in Russia in 2007, because otherwise the airline would have been banned from entering Russian airspace, in what was described as an act of economic blackmail by the Russian authorities.

In 2004, Jade Cargo International was founded as a joint venture between Shenzhen Airlines, Lufthansa Cargo, and the German Investment Corporation, a German governmental entity. This venture operated a fleet of six Boeing 747 freighters that flew to destinations that include Frankfurt, Chennai, Shanghai, and Chengdu. Jade ended operations in 2011.

As of 2011, all Lufthansa Cargo aircraft were based at Frankfurt Airport, the seventh busiest freight hub in the world, where the airline enjoys a strong co-operation with Fraport, the operator of the airport. Cargo facilities at the airport are divided into two places (Cargo City North and South), of which the first one is nearly exclusively used by Lufthansa Cargo. Lufthansa Cargo previously had a secondary base at Leipzig/Halle Airport, the European hub for DHL Express, from where it operated flights on behalf of DHL. Activities at this airport gradually came to an end following the formation of AeroLogic as a joint venture between Lufthansa and DHL, which henceforth caters for the DHL flights, allowing Lufthansa Cargo to concentrate on other services.

In May 2011, Lufthansa Cargo opened another hub at Rajiv Gandhi International Airport in Hyderabad, India, to transport temperature-sensitive goods, especially pharmaceuticals, between South East Asia and Europe (and onwards to the United States).

In 2019, heyworld GmbH was founded as a wholly owned subsidiary of Lufthansa Cargo with a focus on eCommerce logistics. The company and another Lufthansa subsidiary was planned to benefit from the Airbus A321F operations.

In September 2020, Lufthansa Cargo confirmed it was retiring its remaining McDonnell Douglas MD-11F during 2021 despite the grown freight demand in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The last MD-11F flight took place on 17 October 2021.

In June 2024, Lufthansa Cargo announced the inauguration of its first freighter services from Munich Airport with scheduled flights to Istanbul. 

==Destinations==
, Lufthansa Cargo serves 57 cities worldwide.

==Fleet==
===Current fleet===
, the Lufthansa Cargo fleet consists of the following aircraft:

===Fleet development===
The initial fleet of Lufthansa Cargo previously belonged to German Cargo, and was expanded by cargo-converted former Lufthansa Boeing 747-200s. From 1998, the airline began to gradually phase out all other aircraft types in favour of a fleet entirely consisting of the McDonnell Douglas MD-11 (which Lufthansa received as freighter versions in 2001 after MD-11 production ended) version and its successor, the Boeing 777 freighter.
In March 2011, an order of five Boeing 777F was announced, the same aircraft type which had earlier been chosen for AeroLogic. Almost the entire Lufthansa Cargo fleet today is composed of purpose-built freighter aircraft. Lufthansa Cargo had planned to retire its remaining MD-11s by December 2020, but the retirement was delayed due to the increased cargo demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

With the delivery of the first Boeing 777F, Lufthansa Cargo started to name their aircraft using typical greetings of the countries they serve. The first 777F was named &quot;Good day, USA&quot;, while an MD-11F was named &quot;Buenos días México&quot; for example.

In October 2024, Lufthansa CityLine transferred all four of its Airbus A321-200/P2F to Lufthansa Cargo which it had operated for them.

===Former fleet===
Over the years, the following aircraft types were operated:
==Accidents and incidents==
*On 11 December 1978, the Lufthansa heist took place. A group of criminals managed to get into the Lufthansa Cargo offices at JFK Airport in New York City. They threatened staff by pointing guns and stole more than $5 million( 27 million today ). Only a small portion of the money was recovered.
*On 26 July 1979, a Boeing 707 freighter (registration D-ABUY) operating Flight 527 crashed into a hilly slope shortly after take-off, killing all 3 crew-members on board. The cause of the accident was mainly attributed towards the lack of Brazilian Air Traffic control to pay necessary attention to aircraft in their airspace and warn aircraft of the impending collision with terrain.
* On 18 October 1983, a Boeing 747-200 freighter registered D-ABYU operating as Flight 683 overshot the runway during an aborted takeoff at Kai Tak Airport in Hong Kong having experienced a failure of the number 2 engine. The aircraft was substantially damaged, but was repaired and returned to service.
*On 7 July 1999, a Boeing 727-243 freighter leased from Hinduja Cargo Services operating as Lufthansa Cargo Flight 8533 from Nepal to India, crashed into a mountain after takeoff from Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu, Nepal, killing all five people on board.
*On 7 November 2004, at 16:35 local time, a Boeing 747-200 freighter, owned and operated by Air Atlanta Icelandic, overshot the runway upon take-off at Sharjah International Airport and was damaged beyond repair. The aircraft, registered TF-ARR, had been leased by Lufthansa Cargo to operate Flight 8457 to Frankfurt Airport. The pilots had decided to abort the take-off run even though the remaining runway length did not suffice to bring the aircraft to a halt because of a burst tyre and the ATC notification of an alleged fire (which turned out to be not true). The four people on board were not injured.
* On 27 July 2010, at 11:38 local time, Lufthansa Cargo Flight 8460, an MD-11 registered D-ALCQ, crashed upon landing at King Khalid International Airport, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia and was damaged beyond repair in the ensuing fire. The Pilot in command and the Officer — the only two people on board — were able to leave the aircraft by themselves.
*On 24 November 2013, Lufthansa Cargo Flight 8258, an MD-11 registered D-ALCE, bounced during landing at Viracopos International Airport and initiated a go around. The aircraft landed with substantial damage. It was later repaired and returned to service.

<text>This glossary of BDSM (an initialism for &quot;bondage&quot;, &quot;discipline&quot;, &quot;domination&quot;, &quot;submission&quot;, &quot;sadism&quot;, and &quot;masochism&quot;) defines terms commonly used in the BDSM community.

BDSM activities are described as &quot;play&quot; in BDSM terminology.

==Etymology==
BDSM abbreviations have their origins in classified personal advertisements, where euphemisms for paraphilic and socially disapproved practices were required by periodical editors to circumvent censorship and obscenity law.

The term &quot;BDSM&quot; is a portmanteau of initialisms intended to encompass all of the following activities:
* Bondage and discipline (B &amp; D or B/D)
* Dominance and submission (D &amp; S or D/s) (including &quot;master and slave&quot; role-playing scenarios and ongoing relationship structures)
* Sadism and masochism (S &amp; M or S/M)

===Capitalization conventions===
==BDSM glossary==
* 24/7: A relationship in which protocols are in place continuously.&lt;ref name=&quot;tf/7&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* Abrasion: Use of friction with a rough surface against the receptive partner. May be used to sensitize an area of skin.
* Adult baby/diaper lover (ABDL): A form of ageplay; adult babies receive gratification from role-playing an infant. This can involve submission on the adult baby&#x27;s part. Diaper lovers receive gratification from the wearing and often using of diapers. Whilst these two paraphilias are distinct, it is common that a person who enjoys one will also enjoy the other to some degree.
* Aftercare: The time after a BDSM scene or play session in which the participants calm down, discuss the previous events and their personal reactions to them, and slowly come back in touch with reality.
* BDSM: Bondage/Discipline, Dominance/Submission, Sadism/Masochism: a combined acronym often used as a catchall for anything in the kink scene.
* Blackmail: Commonly referred to as consensual blackmail. Where a submissive provides material that would be undesirable or have personal or career consequences for them if it was made public, in order to force them to stay in a relationship. The material can also be in the form of naked photos or videos of them or such material taken as part of BDSM sessions. Commonly used as part of consensual non-consent where they can only refuse to perform an activity or have an action performed if such material is released to the public or some individuals.
* Bondage: Acts involving the physical restraint of a partner. Bondage typically refers to total restraint, but it can be limited to a particular body part, such as breast bondage.
* Bottom: One who receives physical sensation from a top in a scene; the receiving partner.
* Brat / Bratting: A sub who behaves disobediently, mischievously, or uncontrollably; often to provoke a response. This dynamic is consented to by both parties, where the top is often referred to as a &quot;brat tamer&quot;.
* Breast bondage: The act of tying breasts so that they are either flattened against the chest or they bulge.
* Breast torture: Torture of the breasts. 
* Breath control play: Restriction of oxygen to heighten sexual arousal and orgasm. Methods to achieve this include strangulation, suffocation, and smothering.
* Butt plug: A sex toy that is designed to be inserted into the rectum for sexual pleasure. They come in a variety of sizes; some can vibrate. Sometimes used in Petplay, with a tail attached. Some plugs have a locking mechanism that can increase the erotic or humiliation factor by preventing self-removal.
* Chastity: A form of erotic sexual denial or orgasm denial whereby a person is prevented (often with a locking device) from access to, or stimulation of, their genitals, save at the whim or choice of their partner.
* Cock and ball torture (CBT): Torture of the penis and testicles for sexual gratification.
* Collared: Submissive or slave who is owned, usually (but certainly not exclusively) in a loving intimate relationship. A dominant may have multiple persons collared. Also: a pup&#x27;s status, as differentiated from a &quot;stray&quot;.
* Collaring: The formal acceptance by a dominant of a sub&#x27;s service. Also, the ceremony when a dominant commits to a sub (much like a wedding or other contract).
* Contrapolar stimulation: &quot;Hurts so good!” A type of physical stimulation that incorporates feeling of both pleasure and pain.
* Consensual non-consent (CNC): An agreement where parties act as if consent has been waived. Consent is given in advance for some or any actions, and the dominant has the discretion to continue with any action or activity, even after the subject would have otherwise indicated they wish to withdraw consent.
* Consent: Mutual agreement to terms of action, as in a scene or ongoing BDSM relationship.
* D/s: Dominance/submission: play or relationships that involve a psychologically-based power exchange.
* DDlg: Roleplaying where a &quot;Daddy Dom&quot; acts as a paternal figure to a &quot;little girl&quot; submissive. This dynamic is not necessarily sexual and is centered around trust and care.
* Dungeon monitor (DM): A person who supervises the interactions between participants at a play party or dungeon to enforce house rules—essentially, the bouncer of a BDSM event. They may also help in basic ways, such as giving water to participants.
* Dom: A person who exercises control (from dominant – contrasted with sub). This term is generally used for male dominants, but can be used for anyone regardless of gender.
* Dominant: A person who exercises control – contrasted with submissive.
* Domme: A female dominant (see also Dominatrix).
* Domspace: The euphoric state of mind a dom may enter during a scene. May include an intensified perception of the scene.
* Dungeon: A room or area containing BDSM equipment and space for scenes.
* Edgeplay: Higher risk activity, physically and/or emotionally. Because the definition of edgeplay is subjective to the specific players (i.e., what is risky for one person may not be as risky for another), there is not a universal list of what is included in edgeplay. Examples may include bloodplay, breath play and gunplay.
* Enema play: Gratifying or sensual sexual arousal experienced from enemas. Enemas are also used in sadomasochistic activities for erotic humiliation or physical discomfort.
* Erotic humiliation: Humiliating someone during a sexual act. This act could be either verbal or physical (for example, insulting a partner, making a partner display their private parts to a group of people, or even urinating or defecating on a partner). It can be a great source of pleasure for some people.
* Erotic sexual denial: Keeping another person aroused while delaying or preventing resolution of the feelings, to keep them in a continual state of anticipatory tension, inner conflict, and heightened sensitivity. (See also tease and denial and chastity.)
* Erotic spanking: The act of spanking another person for the sexual arousal or gratification of either or both parties. 
* Figging: Insertion of a piece of peeled ginger root into the anus, vagina, or urethra.
* Financial domination: (Also known as money slavery or findom) is a sexual fetish associated with a practice of dominance and submission, where a submissive (money slave, finsub, paypig, human ATM, or cash piggy) will give gifts and money to a financial dominant (money Mistress/Master, findomme/findom, money Dom/Domme or cash Master/Mistress).
*Fisting: Inserting a hand into the vagina or rectum. 
* Forced orgasm: Where a subject has no control in being brought to orgasm, either through physical or mental restraint. May also be used where a female is continuously brought to orgasm to the point of it becoming painful, uncomfortable, or numb, rather than being pleasurable.
* Genitorture: Torture of the genitals.
* Golden showers: Urinating on, or being urinated on by, another person. 
* Good pain / Bad pain: Terms used to distinguish pleasurable pain from undesirable pain. Consent and context is important, and safewords are used to manage the need for changes in the scene to address &quot;bad pain&quot;.
* Gorean: A lifestyle based on the fictional slavery practice outlined in John Norman novels. The dynamic is typically male-dominant and female-submissive (&quot;kajia&quot;).It is generally seen as distinct from the BDSM community at large.
*Gunplay: The practice of including actual (or simulated) firearms into a scene.
* Handkerchief codes: A code used to indicate to others one&#x27;s area of interest in a sexual context, ex: a Handkerchief worn on the left indicates a top, on the right indicates a bottom; generally used in an LGBT context. 
* Hard limits: What someone absolutely will not do; non-negotiable (as opposed to &quot;soft limits&quot;).
* Hogtie: Tying up a submissive&#x27;s wrists and ankles, fastening them together behind their back using physical restraints, such as rope or cuffs.

* Impact play: Part of sensation play, dealing with impacts from whips, riding crops, paddles, floggers, etc.

* Inspection: A form of scenario play, usually in a Master/slave-like relationship, where a submissive has to strip naked at the command of a dominant and adopt a pose to have their body, posture, grooming, and appearance inspected. They may also have the execution of other duties examined during this time. During an inspection, areas of their body and their state may be examined. After an inspection, a sub may be rewarded for passing or punished for failing. Inspections may also be performed for eroticism or objectification, either in private or in view of others.
* Kinbaku (Shibari): Literally means &quot;tight binding.&quot;. Kinbaku is a Japanese style of bondage which combines elegant simplicity and intricate patterns into Kinbaku-bi (&quot;beauty of tight binding.&quot;). 
* Kinky sex: Any sexual act that is generally considered to be unconventional.
* Klismaphilia See enema play.
* Knife play: Slow, methodical sensation of the bottom with the edges and points of knives, usually without cutting the skin. Fear of the weapon plays a large part in the stimulus of the bottom.
* Limits: What someone will not participate in (hard limits) or is hesitant to do so (soft limits).
* Masochism: Act of receiving pleasure from acts involving the receipt or infliction of pain or humiliation.
* Masochist: Person who enjoys pain, often sexually.
* Master/slave: A consensual relationship where people enter a D/s dynamic with a focus on service and obedience. This may be part of a 24/7 lifestyle and/or multiple scenes. A collaring ceremony may be performed where a Master symbolically or literally places a collar on the slave to establish &quot;ownership&quot;, often around the neck or wrists/ankles. This type of collar often differs from a scene-specific restraint and may be worn 24/7 or only during scenes. Non-gendered terms such as &quot;Mx&quot; can be used .
* MDLB: Mommy Domme/Little Boy, the female-led version of DDLG, a subset of Dominance and submission. While this lifestyle may or may not involve ageplay, the name refers to the nurturing relationship of parent/child.
* Mummification: Full body bondage that completely immobilizes the one wrapped up.
* Munch: A non-sexual BDSM meetup at a &quot;vanilla&quot; location with appropriate attire. Munches are typically networking, education and community events rather than for &quot;cruising&quot;.
* Needle play: Piercings done with sterile needles of varying gauges, usually only for the duration of a scene. The upper back, buttocks and thighs are popular locations for needles. This type of scene is rarely available at public events due to medical risks associated with blood.
* Nose torture: A traditionally Japanese form of BDSM often involving nose hooks.
* Pain slut: A person who enjoys receiving a heavy degree of pain.
* Pegging: A sexual practice in which typically a woman penetrates a man&#x27;s anus with a strap-on dildo.
* Play party: A BDSM event involving many people engaging in scenes. Generally, there is are dedicated areas for socializing, changing into fetishwear, and BDSM/sexual activities. 

* Ponyboy or Ponygirl: A sub dressed in a pony outfit, with mouth bit and anal plug with a tail. They are told to prance or behave like a pony.
* Post-orgasm torture: Uncomfortable or painful stimulation of the genitals immediately after orgasm, when these are in a more sensitive state.

* Pup-play / Puppy Play: Play where the sub acts like a puppy.
* Pussy torture: Torture of the vulva or vagina for sexual gratification.
* Risk Aware Consensual Kink (RACK): Describes a philosophical perspective within the BDSM community that prioritizes informed consent and awareness of the risks involved in BDSM activities. Unlike other guidelines that may focus on ensuring activities are inherently &quot;safe,&quot; RACK emphasizes the importance of all participants being fully educated about the risks they are taking.
* Rhaphanidosis: Insertion of a piece of radish into the anus.

* Rope bondage: The act of tying up or binding a person with rope such as in Japanese Kinbaku. 
* Ruination: Bringing someone to the edge of orgasm and preventing climax. See also Edging (sexual practice) and Forced orgasm. 
* Sadism: The act of receiving pleasure from inflicting pain.
* Sadist: A person who enjoys inflicting pain, usually sexually.
* Safe, Sane and Consensual (SSC): A guideline, used by some in the BDSM community, that emphasizes ensuring that activities are safe, all participants have capacity to give consent, and explicit consent is obtained from all parties involved. This approach is sometimes contrasted with RACK (Risk-Aware Consensual Kink), which emphasizes informed risk-taking over predetermined notions of safety. 
* Safeword: A mutually agreed upon word, phrase or gesture that can be used at any time to communicate the need for reduced intensity, a break or an immediate stop. Common safewords include &quot;Yellow&quot; to slow down/reduce intensity, and &quot;Red&quot; or &quot;Safeword&quot; to immediately stop. If the bottom is unable to communicate verbally, a gesture such as making a fist or raising/dropping an arm can be used for the same purpose.
* Scat play: Feces play.
* Scene: Refers to the setting and participation of a BDSM activity.
* Sensation play: class of activities meant to impart physical sensations upon a partner, as opposed to mental forms of erotic play such as power exchange or sexual roleplaying.
* Service submission: A person who enjoys performing a service in a sexual or BDSM environment.
* Slave: A submissive who consensually gives up total control of one or more aspects of their life to another person (their Master).
* Soft limits: Something that someone is hesitant to do or is nervous to try. They can sometimes be talked into the activity, but it is preferable if it is negotiated into a scene at a trial stage or at beginner level.
* : Discomfort with certain kinky activities. It can also refer to someone who has no interest in the activity – it &quot;squicks them out&quot; – but who has no prejudice against the play or people who participate. It is believed that the word is a combination of &quot;squirm&quot; and &quot;icky&quot; and is used to imply an uncomfortable feeling mixed with disgust. The term is used instead of &quot;disgust&quot; because that word implies moral repugnance to the act.
* Sub drop: A strong physical and emotional response experienced by a participant in a BDSM scene. This can last for minutes, hours or days and include flu-like symptoms and strong emotions such as shame. Tops can also experience drop after a scene. Drop can be somewhat mitigated but not fully prevented by aftercare, including warmth, chocolate, quiet, darkness, cuddling and food/water.
* Submissive (or &quot;sub&quot; for short): A person that gives up control, either all the time or for a specified period (not to be confused with &quot;bottom&quot; or &quot;slave&quot;).
* Subspace: A psychological state caused by excitement and sense of &quot;letting go&quot; of control during a scene. Typically experienced by submissives, s-types, or bottoms during a BDSM scene. It is often described as a &quot;natural high&quot; where the individual feels disconnected from time, space, and their body. Tops must monitor their partner&#x27;s well-being during a scene since they may not be able to communicate their needs. Can be succeeded by sub drop.
* Switch: A person who is contextually dominant and submissive during the same or separate scenes. Depending on preference, this could depend on their partner&#x27;s gender identity or type of BDSM play.
* Tit torture: The act of causing deliberate physical pain to the breasts or nipples.
* TNG: The Next Generation. A tag commonly used by groups and organizations which cater to younger people involved in BDSM, typically ages 18–35.
* Top: The person &quot;doing the action&quot; (contrasted with bottom – the person receiving the action). A top is not necessarily dominant in the scene.
* Topping from the bottom: Derogatory term for an attempt to direct the top/dominant during a scene in a way not otherwise agreed upon. Bratting is an exception to this.
* TPE (Total Power Exchange): A relationship where the dominant or owner has complete authority and influence over the submissive&#x27;s life, making the majority of decisions.
* Training: Either referring to a short period of time, or an ongoing effort of the dominant teaching the submissive how to behave for their own preferences.
* Vanilla: Someone who is not into BDSM. Alternatively, sexual behavior which does not encompass BDSM activity.

* Wax play: The top drips hot wax on the bottom.
* WIITWD: What It Is That We Do. A broad term referring to all forms of alternative sexuality.

<doc id="1289336" wikidata="Q1212256" url="?curid=1289336" title="The Replacement Killers">
<text>The Replacement Killers is a 1998 American action film directed by Antoine Fuqua in his feature film directorial debut, and written by Ken Sanzel. The film stars Chow Yun-fat, Mira Sorvino, Michael Rooker, and Kenneth Tsang. The film was released in the United States on February 6, 1998. The storyline was conceived from a screenplay written by Ken Sanzel. Veteran action director John Woo co-produced and choreographed the action sequences. The film is set in modern-day Los Angeles and follows an emotionally disillusioned assassin who is forced to settle a violent vendetta for a ruthless crime boss. The film marks the American acting debut for Chow, as his previous film credits included Hong Kong action cinema only.

The film was a co-production between the motion picture studios of Columbia Pictures, Brillstein-Grey Entertainment, and WCG Entertainment Productions. &quot;The Replacement Killers&quot; explores assassination, violence and the influence of triads in modern society. The film score was orchestrated by Harry Gregson-Williams; the soundtrack was released by the Varèse Sarabande music label on March 10, 1998.

&quot;The Replacement Killers&quot; premiered in theaters nationwide in the United States on February 6, 1998, grossing $19.2 million in US ticket receipts and $39.5 million worldwide from a $30 million budget. It has a 38% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes and a consensus of &quot;mixed reviews&quot; on Metacritic.

==Plot==
During an orchestrated drug bust at a marine loading dock, LAPD detective Stan Zedkov kills Triad lieutenant Peter Wei.

Looking to exact revenge for his son&#x27;s death, Peter&#x27;s father, Terence, sends for professional assassin John Lee. Paying off an old debt, Lee has already killed two targets for Wei, who now tells him that this third and final job will settle the obligation. However, Lee&#x27;s conscience prevents him from completing his final assignment: to assassinate Zedkov&#x27;s seven-year-old son Stevie before the detective&#x27;s eyes.

Realizing that his actions will result in retaliation against his mother and sister, Lee prepares to return to China, enlisting the help of old friend Alan Chan, a monk in a local Buddhist temple, to make arrangements to have his family moved to a secure location. Infuriated by Lee&#x27;s disobedience, Wei orders his head lieutenant, Michael Kogan, to lead the hunt for Lee, and has his people in China begin the search for Lee&#x27;s family.

No longer able to use the Triad network to get out of the country, Lee searches for alternative means outside Wei&#x27;s sphere of influence, and looks to skilled forger Meg Coburn for a new passport. Before she can finish the job, Wei&#x27;s men storm Meg&#x27;s office, destroying the computerized tools of her trade in the ensuing shootout. Lee escapes; Coburn is picked up by the police, unsuccessfully interrogated by Zedkov, and released as bait so the detective can see who tries to kill her. Meanwhile, Wei hires two skilled out-of-town contract killers named Ryker and Collins to take over the hunt for Lee and the Zedkov contract.

Lee finds Coburn when she returns to her destroyed office. Having been made aware that the Triads are involved, Coburn wants out, but Lee forces her to finish her original task of creating a forged passport. Traveling with Coburn, and with the two &quot;replacement killers&quot; in pursuit, Lee gets pictures from a photo booth and phones Alan, who offers the use of his passport. When Lee arrives at the temple, he discovers that Alan has been tortured to the point of death. Alan tells Lee that his family was moved to Canton—but he told his torturers they were in Shanghai. Lee has little more than 24 hours before his family is found. The monk gives Lee his passport before dying in his arms.

Holed up in a hotel, Coburn finishes altering Alan&#x27;s passport for Lee. The two exchange stories, and Coburn becomes sympathetic to Lee. Feeling compelled to stop the killing of Zedkov&#x27;s son before leaving the country, Lee forces one of Wei&#x27;s men to reveal the plan, which is to kill Stevie while he and his father are at a movie festival inside a cinema. Lee and Coburn, who insists on helping, arrive barely in time to prevent Ryker and Collins from killing the boy, and Ryker is killed by Lee in the subsequent gunfight.

Concerned that Lee and Coburn will make their way back to his base of operations, Wei makes plans to flee the country and hunt down Lee&#x27;s mother and sister himself. However, when two guards open the main gate for Wei and his entourage to leave in a limo, Lee is just outside. He launches a two-handed handgun assault while Coburn surfaces moments later, driving a truck through the melee, incapacitating Kogan, and later killing him. When Collins fires from a high perch on Lee and Coburn, Lee soon outflanks Collins, killing him from behind. Finally, Lee corners Wei on a fire escape platform. Though both men have emptied their guns, Lee is first to reload. Wei promises Lee that the boy and Lee&#x27;s family will still die, but Lee replies, &quot;Not in your lifetime&quot;, and kills him. Though Zedkov arrives before Lee and Coburn can get away, he lets them go, taking only their guns.

Coburn reluctantly bids goodbye to Lee at the airport, presenting him with one last gift, passports for his mother and sister.

==Production==

===Filming===

Production for the film began on February 10, 1997, in downtown Los Angeles. The first shoot was set in the historic Mayan Theater, refurbished as a trendy nightclub and cast with hundreds of extras for the film&#x27;s opening scene. The eight-story, nearly condemned Giant Penny building in the middle of Los Angeles served as the location for a police station interior, a hotel room, and Meg Coburn&#x27;s office. A chaotic gunfight was filmed amid the spray, brushes, and hoses of Joe&#x27;s Car Wash, also in Los Angeles. A Chinatown-like streetscape of damp, narrow alleys and blinking red neon lights was created for the night-time finale, where Yun-Fat shot off 546 rounds of two-fisted shooting; the repetitive action left his hands blistered and shaking. More gunplay took place in a video arcade replicated at the original Lawry&#x27;s California Center (now the Los Angeles River Center and Gardens), just north of downtown Los Angeles. Lee&#x27;s tranquil Buddhist temple was fashioned under this same roof.

Director Antoine Fuqua stressed to his team that the aim was to design a &quot;&quot;Taxi Driver&quot; for the 1990s&quot;. In addition to physical training, Mira Sorvino, who had never handled a gun prior to this film, took weapons training to prepare for her role. Sorvino, who majored in Asian studies at Harvard, speaks Mandarin, and lived for eight months (1988–89) in Beijing, where she studied Chinese, taught English, and saw Chinese films, including Hong Kong action films. She felt &quot;The Replacement Killers&quot; brought her a step closer to her goal of making a film in Mandarin and working with a Chinese director. Prior to the start of filming, Sorvino had blown out her voice from screaming in reshoots of &quot;Mimic&quot;; Fuqua liked the effect and asked her to keep it, which required Sorvino to yell prior to each day&#x27;s shoots to burn out her voice.

==Music==
===Soundtrack===
The original motion picture score was composed by Harry Gregson-Williams. Alan Meyerson mixed the sound elements for the chorus, while Richard Whitfield edited the film&#x27;s music. The soundtrack for the film was released on March 10, 1998, by the Varèse Sarabande music label. In an interview with Hideo Kojima, he stated it was the film&#x27;s soundtrack that led him to hire Harry to work on the soundtrack of &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot;.

===Additional music===
In addition to the film score by Harry Gregson-Williams, several modern songs by cutting-edge artists were included on the soundtrack (although never officially released as a cd) including:
*&quot;Keep Hope Alive&quot; by The Crystal Method 
*&quot;Jaan&quot; by Talvin Singh featuring Amar
*&quot;Makes Me Wanna Die (The Weekend Mix)&quot; by Tricky
*&quot;Rocco&quot; by Death In Vegas
*&quot;Boom Boom Caw&quot; by Brad
*&quot;33&quot; by Hed PE
*&quot;Escape From The City Of Angels&quot; by Ithaka (featuring Marta Dias)

===Critical response===
Rotten Tomatoes reports that 37% of 38 sampled critics gave the film a positive review; the average score is 5.3 out of 10. The consensus summarizes: &quot;Chow Yun-fat makes his dubious English-language debut in &quot;The Replacement Killers&quot;, a stylish but muddled knockoff of the Hong Kong shoot-em-ups that earned the star his international renown.&quot; At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average out of 100 to critics&#x27; reviews, the film received a score of 42 based on 22 reviews, which it classifies as &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.
Among some of the positive critiques, Roger Ebert writing in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; called it &quot;as abstract as a jazz instrumental, and as cool and self-assured&quot;. Discussing the film&#x27;s style, he remarked that it was a &quot;high-gloss version of a Hong Kong action picture, made in America but observing the exuberance of a genre where surfaces are everything&quot;. In &quot;Variety&quot;, Leonard Klady viewed the film as being a &quot;big, loud music video that&#x27;s not particularly interested in content. It&#x27;s a rudderless style piece; as the old saw cautions, accept no substitutes.&quot; Regarding the film&#x27;s set design and production qualities, he noted that, &quot;while an apt homage, the set pieces here are technical but not visceral, feeling manufactured rather than organically integrated into the plot&quot;.

Russell Smith of &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; said the film was &quot;so numbingly ritualistic that even the well-choreographed gun battles, probably the most Woo-like aspects of the film, lose much of their potential impact&quot;. Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Stephen Holden noted that although the film&#x27;s &quot;seamless fusion of Hong Kong action-adventure style and cool, Los Angeles street chic has a certain seductive charm, it is the only charm of a movie that is otherwise devoid of content&quot;. Edward Guthmann in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; said that &quot;As pointless blast-athons go, &quot;The Replacement Killers&quot; isn&#x27;t bad. It&#x27;s beautifully shot by first-time feature director Antoine Fuqua, whose eye for sensual surfaces, deft camera moves and elegant framing was refined with commercials and music videos.&quot;

Desson Thomson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; stated that &quot;Without Chow Yun-Fat, who makes his American screen debut here, there&#x27;d be nothing to say about &quot;The Replacement Killers&quot;. Antoine Fuqua&#x27;s action movie is entirely free of surprise. It breaks no rules.&quot; He did however muse that &quot;Chow&#x27;s pretty face and cool presence are inescapable. You don&#x27;t enjoy this movie, so much as you conduct a road test for the Hong Kong actor. Yes, he can survive in an English language picture!&quot; In &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot;, Walter Addiego perceived that the film &quot;remains a counterfeit of a Woo movie, even though Woo himself co-produced it. He turned the directing chores over to first-timer Antoine Fuqua, whose previous work was limited to music videos and commercials, and it shows.&quot; He added, &quot;The script, by Ken Sanzel, is the work of someone who&#x27;s seen Woo&#x27;s movies and wasn&#x27;t particularly moved by the experience.&quot;

===Crew&#x27;s response===
In retrospect, Antoine Fuqua said: &quot;&quot;The Replacement Killers&quot; was a good and bad experience. It was great because Chow Yun-Fat is the coolest guy in the world. He was just beautiful. Mira Sorvino was cool. It was fun working with Mira. But the difficult thing was learning the studio system, learning all the things that go along with that system. There are a lot of people that have a lot of say, especially when you&#x27;re that young in the studio world. You learn that it is a business. I think for me, what I learned was I still love making movies, and I know what I don&#x27;t want to do. The thing that I learned the most out of that movie was what I don&#x27;t want to do.&quot;

Ken Sanzel, who wrote the movie, said: &quot;The script bears very little resemblance to anything I would have written; only the bare bones of the plot really survived. I think that Chow Yun-Fat was incredible, but for me the movie was a series of otherwise bad decisions. I&#x27;m glad that people enjoy it, but it was really Antoine Fuqua&#x27;s sensibility top to bottom, which is not at all mine (aside from the fact that we both love the work of Michael Mann, though apparently for very different reasons).&quot;

Mira Sorvino said: &quot;I loved working with Antoine, and it was fun to do an action movie. It was kind of like being a kid and playing cowboys and Indians, or cops and robbers. And I enjoyed the role of Meg. I thought she was fun to do.&quot;

<text>PT Merpati Nusantara Airlines, operated as Merpati Nusantara Airlines, was an airline in Indonesia based in Central Jakarta, Jakarta. It operated scheduled domestic services to more than 25 destinations in Indonesia, as well as scheduled international services to East Timor and Malaysia. The word &quot;merpati&quot; is Indonesian for &quot;dove&quot;, and Nusantara is a Javanese word found in the &quot;Pararaton&quot; (&quot;the Book of Kings&quot;, probably written in the 16th century) meaning &quot;the outer islands&quot;, referring to the Indonesian archipelago. The airline was based at Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, Jakarta. It also maintained both a maintenance and simulator facility at Juanda International Airport, Surabaya. The Merpati Training Centre at Surabaya housed Fokker F-27, AVIC MA60 and CN-235 full motion simulators.

All services were suspended in 2014 due to financial and regulatory issues. After 8 years of failing to negotiate the airlines relaunch and obtain funding, all operating licenses and certificates were permanently revoked and the airline was dissolved on 20 February 2023.

==History==
With a start-up capital of 10 million rupiah, Merpati began operations in Kalimantan, using a fleet of four de Havilland Otter/DHC-3s and two Douglas DC-3 Dakotas provided by the Indonesian Air Force (TNI AU). Pilots and technicians were supplied by the Indonesian Air Force, Garuda Indonesia Airways, and other civil aviation companies. Its mission, defined by the government, was to become an &#x27;air bridge&#x27; linking remote areas of Indonesia and thereby helping to build the economies of such regional areas. The air bridge theme is the basis of the current Merpati logo, displayed on the tails of its aircraft.

The first Managing Director appointed was Air Commodore Sutoyo Adiputro Henk (1962–1966) who had an initial staff of 17 people. In 1963, the airline expanded its routes to include Jakarta - Tanjung Karang (Bandar Lampung), Jakarta - Semarang, and Jakarta - Balikpapan. In 1964, the airline took over operations from NV de Kroonduif Garuda, increasing its aircraft fleet to 12. With the addition of three DC-3 Dakotas, two DHC-6 Twin Otters and 1 DHC-2 Beaver, Merpati began to grow, with operations now reaching Sumatra, Papua and Nusa Tenggara Barat. Further expansion saw the addition of more aircraft, including three Dornier DO-28s and six Pilatus Porter PC-6s, and staff numbers growing to 583 people.

The airline was jointly owned by the Indonesian Government (93.2%) and Garuda Indonesia (6.8%).

In June 2011, the Merpati commercial director stated that the airline was opening a tender for 15 jet airliners, including 40 aircraft with a capacity of 50 passengers and 20 additional aircraft carrying 20 passengers, such as the MA-60, the NC-212 or DHC-6 Twin Otter. The following month, with the airline suffering from financial difficulties, the government and the legislature agreed to provide a capital injection of Rp.516 billion ($60.7 million) to Merpati Nusantara Airlines in the 2012 state budget.

In February 2014, due to the airline&#x27;s inability to pay its employees salary or benefits for three consecutive months, many pilots and cabin crew resigned. The same month, Merpati suspended all services due to cashflow problems, including an inability to obtain fuel on credit, obliging the company to pay cash. On 24 July 2014 it was reported that the Indonesian Ministry of Finance had decided not to reopen the company following the airline&#x27;s accumulating a debt of 7.9 trillion Rp, as well as the failure of a debt-to-equity-swap plan proposed by the company.

In late 2016 the Ministry of State Owned Enterprises stated that the airline might be able to resume commercial flights in 2017 following a restructuring plan and government cash injection.

On 14 November 2018, The Panel of Judges of the Commercial Court decided to approve the peace proposal of PT Merpati Nusantara Airlines with its creditors held at the District Court (PN), Surabaya, East Java. Thus, PT Merpati Nusantara Airlines was declared not bankrupt.

However, by June 2022, The New Merpati has been presumed no longer return and the airline license has been permanently revoked by the government. Thus, Merpati&#x27;s obligations to third parties, such as severance pay to former employees, will be settled by selling all of its assets through an auction mechanism.

==Corporate affairs==
The airline&#x27;s headquarters were in Central Jakarta. Previously, the airline had been based out of Kemajoran Airport.

==Fleet==
===Previous fleet===
The Merpati fleet included the following aircraft prior to its suspension (as of January 2014):


===Fleet development===
In 2012, Merpati announced that it would take delivery of Airbus A320 aircraft in 2014 but, due to cash problems, this proposal was abandoned. Through a restructuring plan and government cash injection, Merpati hoped to relaunch its operations by the end of 2017 or early 2018, most likely using Boeing 737-700 or Boeing 737-800 aircraft. However, this plan was aborted as the airline decided to order other aircraft types instead.

In 2018 Merpati Nusantara signed a letter of intent for 10 Irkut MC-21-300 aircraft.

<text>Newell Park was a baseball playing field located in Syracuse, New York. The ground was home to the Syracuse Stars of the National League for the 1879 season. Historians also refer to it as Star Park (I). It had been opened in 1878 for minor league ball. The 1879 major league team played poorly and drew poorly, and folded in early September. A revived Syracuse Stars played here in 1883 and 1884 before moving to a new Star Park a couple of long blocks north of Newell Park on Salina Street. 

The location of Newell Park was the southeast corner of East Raynor Street (originally Croton Street) and South Salina Street, extending east toward Montgomery Street and State Street, and about one half-mile west of the Carrier Dome at Syracuse University.

<text>LaMont Damon Jordan (born November 11, 1978) is an American former professional football player who was a running back in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Maryland Terrapins and was selected by the New York Jets in the second round of the 2001 NFL draft. Jordan also played in the NFL for the Oakland Raiders, New England Patriots and Denver Broncos. After his playing career, he was the running backs coach for the San Diego Fleet of the Alliance of American Football (AAF) in 2019.

==Early life==
Jordan graduated from Suitland High School in 1997. A highly sought-after area prospect, he won many awards in high school, and played football and baseball, and was a member of the school&#x27;s swimming and track teams.

==College career==
He attended the University of Maryland, College Park, and as a freshman, gained notice as a first-string player, and finished as runner-up for Rookie of the Year in the Atlantic Coast Conference. As a sophomore, he was named to the second-team All-ACC, and was named by Maryland as the team&#x27;s most outstanding offensive player. As a junior, he began to gain national notice, and was a semifinalist for the Doak Walker Award. In the same year, he was named to the All-ACC first-team, and surpassed Maryland&#x27;s single-season rushing record. That season, he gained over six yards per carry, one of only four NCAA players to do so. He was the NCAA rushing leader over the last six games of his junior season. He sat out the drills preceding the 2000 season due to fears of academic ineligibility, and, having a somewhat lackluster senior year, was named to the ACC second-team.

==Professional career==

===New York Jets===
Jordan was drafted in the second round of the 2001 NFL draft by the New York Jets. Jordan spent his first four years as a backup to Curtis Martin before becoming a free agent.

===Oakland Raiders===
After the 2004 season, Jordan signed a five-year, $27.5 million contract with the Oakland Raiders. He wore No. 34. Jordan rushed for a career-high 1,025 yards in 2005 while leading all NFL running backs in receptions with 70.

On November 19, 2006, Jordan tore his medial collateral ligament in a game against the Kansas City Chiefs and missed the rest of the season.
Jordan started the 2007 season with 350 yards rushing and two touchdowns in the first three games. He injured his back against the Miami Dolphins and was replaced by Justin Fargas. Fargas was productive and was named the starter for the next four games. On July 25, 2008, Jordan was released by the Raiders.

===New England Patriots===
On July 26, 2008, Jordan signed a one-year contract with the New England Patriots.

===Denver Broncos===
On March 4, 2009, Jordan signed a two-year, $2.5 million contract with the Denver Broncos. The deal included a $500,000 signing bonus. The move reunited him with Broncos head coach Josh McDaniels, who was the Patriots&#x27; offensive coordinator in 2008.

Jordan was released on February 23, 2010.

==NFL career statistics==
===Regular season===
===Playoffs===
==Coaching career==
On December 19, 2018, Jordan was named running backs coach for the San Diego Fleet of the Alliance of American Football.

<text>South Khorasan province () is one of the 31 provinces of Iran, located in the eastern part of the country. Its capital is the city of Birjand. In 2014, the province was placed in Region 5. This province is bordered to the north by Razavi Khorasan Province, to the northwest by Semnan Province, to the west by Isfahan and Yazd Provinces, to the south by Kerman Province, and to the southeast by Sistan and Baluchestan Province. The area of this province is 151,913 square kilometers (58,654 square miles), making it the third largest province in Iran after Kerman and Sistan and Baluchestan. According to the 2016 census, its population is 768,898, ranking it as the 28th province in the country in terms of population. This province is the third largest province in Iran.

South Khorasan Province is split into two distinct regions: the &quot;mountainous and elevated&quot; areas in the north and northwest, and the &quot;low and flat&quot; central and southern plains. The tallest mountains in the province include &quot;Kamarak&quot; and &quot;Shah Kuh.&quot; It experiences a &quot;dry and desert&quot; climate, which can be further divided into &quot;hot and dry&quot; and &quot;mild and dry&quot; categories. The northern and northwestern parts are more fertile, while the southern and southwestern plains endure a dry and harsh climate. The rivers in this region are seasonal, with no permanent rivers present.

== History ==
Greater Khorasan has witnessed the rise and fall of many dynasties and governments in its territory throughout history. Various tribes of the Arabs, Turks, Kurds and Turkmen brought changes to the region time and time again.
, Mongols
Ancient geographers of Iran divided Iran (&quot;Iran-Shahr&quot;) into eight segments of which the most flourishing and largest was the territory of Greater Khorasan. Esfarayen, among other cities of the province, was one of the focal points for the residence of the Aryan tribes after entering Iran.

The Parthian empire was based near Merv in Khorasan for many years. At Parthians times, Esfarayen was one of the important villages of Nishapur.

During the Sassanid dynasty the province was governed by a &quot;Spahbod&quot; (Lieutenant General) called &quot;Padgoosban&quot; and four margraves, each commander of one of the four parts of the province.

Khorasan was divided into four parts during the Muslim conquest of Persia, each section being named after the four largest cities, Nishapur, Merv, Herat, and Balkh.

In the year 651, the army of Islamic Arabs invaded Khorasan. The territory remained in the hands of the Abbasid clan until 820, followed by the rule of the Iranian Taherid clan in the year 896 and the Samanid dynasty in 900.

Mahmud of Ghazni conquered Khorasan in 994 and in the year 1037 Toghrül, the first of the Seljuq empire rulers conquered Nishapur.

Mahmud of Ghazni retaliated against the invaders several times, and finally the Ghaznavids defeated Sultan Sanjar. But there was more to come, as in 1157 Khorasan was conquered by the Khwarazmids and because of simultaneous attacks by the Mongols, Khorasan was annexed to the territories of the Mongol Ilkhanate.

In the 14th century, a flag of independence was hoisted by the Sarbedaran movement in Sabzevar, and in 1468, Khorasan came into the hands of Tamerlane and the city of Herat was declared as the capital.

In 1507, Khorasan was occupied by Uzbek tribes. After the death of Nader Shah in 1747, parts of it were occupied by the Afghans for a short period.

In these periods, Birjand was a small part of Quhistan which almost encompasses the borders of today South Khorasan. The main cities of Quhistan were Toon (now Ferdows) and Qaen. Birjand grew in recent centuries, especially during the Qajar dynasty and found its important role in this region.

This region was a place of refuge for some movements like the Ismaili, and was the target of Arab refugees who escaped from the tyranny of the Abbasid caliphate. Zoroastrian vestiges also exist in the area.

In 1824, Herat became independent for several years when the Afghan Empire was split between the Durranis and Barakzais. The Persians sieged the city in 1837, but the British assisted the Afghans in repelling them. In 1856, the Persians launched another invasion, and briefly managed to recapture the city; it led directly to the Anglo-Persian War. In 1857 hostilities between the Persians and the British ended after the Treaty of Paris was signed, and the Persian troops withdrew from Herat. Afghanistan reconquered Herat in 1863 under Dost Muhammad Khan, two weeks before his death.

This new province is but the old Quhistan which was included into greater Khorasan in the Iranian administrative planning. However, historically Qohistan forms a separate entity, with a distinct culture, history, environment and ecology.

South Khorasan is one of the three provinces that were created after the division of Khorasan in 2004. While at the beginning, the newly created &quot;South Khorasan&quot; included only Birjand County and some new counties detached from that county (i.e. Nehbandan, Darmian and Sarbisheh), in subsequent years, all northern and western cities and territories of the old Quhistan (such as Qaen, Ferdows and Tabas) have been annexed into South Khorasan, which as of 2016 consists of 11 counties.

Khorasan was the largest province of Iran until it was divided into three provinces on September 29, 2004. The provinces approved by the parliament of Iran (on May 18, 2004) and the Council of Guardians (on May 29, 2004) were Razavi Khorasan, North Khorasan, and South Khorasan.

<text>Bouraq Indonesia Airlines, branded sometimes as Bouraq Airlines or Bouraq, was an airline headquartered in Jakarta, Indonesia, which operated mostly domestic passenger flights out of its bases at Soekarno-Hatta International Airport and Sultan Aji Muhammad Sulaiman Airport.

==History==

Bouraq Indonesia Airlines was established in 1970 as a privately owned company by Jarry Albert Sumendap, and it stayed in the possession of his family ever since. It was named for al-Buraq, a flying horse in Muslim tradition. Bali Air was another airline owned by Sumendap, which was co-operating with Bouraq. Initially the airline operated Douglas DC-3s. From 1973 the turboprop Hawker Siddeley HS 748 was introduced on Bouraq services.

Both airlines were shut down in 2005 after prolonged financial problems. The last scheduled Bouraq flight took place in July 2005. The airline licence was later revoked in 2007.

==Fleet==

Over the years, Bouraq Indonesia Airlines operated the following aircraft types:
==Accidents and incidents==
===Fatal===
*On 26 August 1980 at 06:29 local time, a Vickers Viscount (registered PK-IVS) crashed near Jakarta during a scheduled passenger flight from Banjarmasin that was operated on behalf of Bouraq, killed 31 passengers and 6 crew on board. The pilots had lost control of the aircraft over Tanjung Karawang whilst approaching Kemayoran Airport when the right elevator broke off. It was later determined that the fastenings had exceeded their lifetime by a factor of three without having been substituted during maintenance checkups.
*On 9 January 1993, a Bouraq Hawker Siddeley HS 748 (registered PH-IHE) crashed near Juanda International Airport, killing 11 of the 39 passengers and 4 of the 5 crew on board. The aircraft had just left the airport for a scheduled flight to Banjarmasin, when a failure of the right side engine was experienced. The pilots tried to return to Juanda Airport, but ultimately failed to do so. The aircraft crashed into a swamp, broke in two and caught fire.
*On 6 August 1995, a Bouraq HS 748 (registered PK-KHL) crashed into Mount Kumawa at a height of 2,800 metres, killing 4 passengers and 6 crew on board. The aircraft had been on a chartered flight from Dumatubin Airport to Kaimana Airport.

===Non-fatal===
*On 23 January 1976, a Bouraq Hawker Siddeley HS 748 (registered PK-IHD) was damaged beyond repair in a landing accident at Mutiara Airport. None of the 27 passengers and 5 crew on board were seriously injured.
*On 9 February 1977, another Bouraq HS 748 (this time registered PH-IHK) had to be written off after a hard landing at Sultan Hasanuddin International Airport, which caused the landing gear to collapse. Again, there are no reports concerning any injuries of the 46 passengers and 5 crew on board.
*On 10 December 1982, the nose gear of a Bouraq HS 748 (registered PH-IHI) collapsed upon landing at Sam Ratulangi International Airport, causing the aircraft to veer off the runway. Even though the plane was destroyed, all of the 42 passengers and three crew survived.
*On 4 July 1988, a Bouraq Vickers Viscount (registered PK-IVW) was damaged beyond economic repair when the starboard and nose gear collapsed during a tailwind landing at Sultan Aji Muhammad Sulaiman Airport. There were no notable injuries among the 71 passengers and 5 crew members on board
*On 4 January 1989, a Bouraq HS 748 suffered extensive damage when the pilots had to perform a belly landing at Syamsudin Noor Airport, following a failure of the landing gears with 47 passengers and five crew on board.
*On 28 August 1992, a Bouraq Vickers Viscount (registered PH-IVX) was destroyed in an engine fire at Syamsudin Noor Airport. The fire started during the take-off run, but the pilots noticed it in time to abort take-off and evacuate the 64 passengers (plus six crew), before the aircraft was engulfed by the flames.
*On 26 September 1994, a Bouraq Viscount (registered PK-IVU) was damaged in a landing accident at Pontianak Airport during a ferry flight with only two pilots on board. The aircraft could be repaired and returned to service.
*On 11 July 1996 at 09:00 local time, Bouraq lost another HS 748 (registered PK-IHN) in a runway overshot at Pattimura Airport. The pilots had to abort the take-off for a scheduled flight to Manado because of an engine failure, but the remaining length of the runway did not suffice to bring the aircraft to a halt, so that it collided with a dyke. There were no noteworthy injuries amongst the 43 passengers and five crew members.

<doc id="1289366" wikidata="Q7572221" url="?curid=1289366" title="Space (Jimmy Cauty album)">
<text>Space is a 1990 ambient house concept album by Jimmy Cauty under the alias Space. Originally intended to be The Orb&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Space&quot; was refactored for release as a solo album following Cauty&#x27;s departure from that group. &quot;Space&quot; was independently released on KLF Communications, the record label formed to distribute the work of Cauty&#x27;s other project, The KLF.

==Origins==
&quot;Space&quot; was originally a collaboration between Alex Paterson and Jimmy Cauty, the original line-up of The Orb. Cauty&#x27;s record label KLF Communications planned to release it as The Orb&#x27;s debut album, but when Cauty left The Orb in April 1990 to concentrate on producing music as The KLF with Bill Drummond, he took the recordings with him. Reworked to remove Paterson&#x27;s contributions, the album was released by KLF Communications in July 1990 as an eponymous album, with Cauty alone receiving credit.

Youth, a friend and colleague of both men, recalled: &quot;Jimmy and Alex were making an album called Space when they had a big argument. Jimmy stormed off, took all of Alex’s bits off the record and released it under his own name. Alex was mortified. I told him not to worry – we’d make a record that was even better&quot;.

According to Cauty, &quot;Space&quot; &quot;was a jam, all done on Oberheim keyboards. Loads of samples... were chucked in there as well. I started on Monday morning and by Friday it was all done&quot;.

==Composition==
&quot;Space&quot; takes the listener on a voyage through the Solar System from Mercury outwards, with vast distances of empty space between worlds represented by periods of minimalist ambience and near-silence. Synthesisers, excerpts from classical compositions and nursery rhymes (including Twinkle Twinkle Little Star), sinusoidal loops, and communications from space flight controllers are among the sounds used to describe the voyage. This musical interpretation of a physical journey is also a characteristic of the early ambient house recordings &quot;The Orb&#x27;s Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld&quot; and The KLF&#x27;s &quot;Chill Out&quot;.

Cauty has called &quot;Space&quot; &quot;a record for 14-year-old space cadets to go and take acid [to] for the first time&quot;.

==Reviews==

John Bush at AllMusic attributes &quot;incredibly sparse ambience&quot; to &quot;Space&quot;, with &quot;long periods of near-silence [and] only an occasional break for galactic sine-waves and similarly spacy tones&quot;. The album is &quot;more important for who&#x27;s on it than what&#x27;s in it&quot;, he concluded.

==Track listing==
&quot;Space&quot; comprises eight contiguous pieces across two sides of vinyl or one track of a CD.

#&quot;Mercury&quot; – 1:39
#&quot;Venus&quot; – 2:00
#&quot;Mars&quot; – 8:47
#&quot;Jupiter&quot; – 6:34
#&quot;Saturn&quot; – 2:44
#&quot;Uranus&quot; – 2:57
#&quot;Neptune&quot; – 10.28
#&quot;Pluto&quot; – 3:10

<text>Thai AirAsia (, ) is a Thai low-cost airline. It is a joint venture of Malaysian AirAsia () and Thailand&#x27;s Asia Aviation. It serves AirAsia&#x27;s regularly scheduled domestic and international flights from Bangkok and other cities in Thailand.

On 12 November 2003, AirAsia partnered with Shin Corporation to establish AirAsia Aviation Co. Ltd. (Thai AirAsia). It launched operations in February 2004 by launching flights from Bangkok–Don Mueang to Hat Yai, Phuket, and Chiang Mai.

On 15 February 2006, it was announced that Asia Aviation PLC (AAV), a registered Thai company, had taken Shin Corporation&#x27;s 50 percent stake in Thai AirAsia. Asia Aviation was a joint venture set up by Shin Corporation, which held 49 percent of Asia Aviation&#x27;s shares, while 51 percent was held by Thai investor Sittichai Veerathammanoon.

In May 2007, Thai AirAsia&#x27;s management acquired 100 percent of Asia Aviation. Thai AirAsia is 55 percent owned by Asia Aviation and 45 percent owned by Malaysia-based AirAsia Group. In June 2016 King Power purchased a US$225 million stake in Thai AirAsia. The purchase of 39 percent of holding company Asia Aviation makes King Power the second largest shareholder in Thai AirAsia. It sold back its shares to Asia Aviation a year later.

<text>Eric Drooker is an American painter, graphic novelist, and frequent cover artist for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. He conceived and designed the animation for the film &quot;Howl&quot; (2010).

== Biography ==
Drooker grew up in Manhattan&#x27;s Stuyvesant Town, adjacent to the Lower East Side, which was then a working-class immigrant neighborhood with a tradition of left-wing political activism. He attended the Downtown Community School in Manhattan&#x27;s East Village. Drooker developed an early interest in graphic arts and cartoons, particularly the woodcut novels of Frans Masereel and Lynd Ward and the underground comics of Robert Crumb.

After studying sculpture at Cooper Union, Drooker turned to poster art, creating flyers on local political issues while working as a tenant organizer. His images, done in a striking black-and-white style reminiscent of Masereel and other 1930s expressionist illustrators, were widely copied and reused by others—sometimes for unrelated purposes such as advertising concerts—and were popular enough that he could make a small income selling artwork on the street. During the 1980s, Drooker was further radicalized by his experiences with the police, due to their actions against squatters in the rapidly gentrifying Tompkins Square Park area and their increasing intolerance of unlicensed street artists and musicians.

His first published work appeared in leftist magazines such as &quot;The Nation&quot;, &quot;The Progressive&quot;, and various underground publications such as &quot;Screw&quot;. His work would later be seen in such mainstream publications as &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot;, and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;; and his paintings would appear on dozens of covers of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. When &quot;World War 3 Illustrated&quot; was founded by Seth Tobocman and Peter Kuper, who shared Drooker&#x27;s political beliefs and graphic approach, Drooker became one of the magazine&#x27;s co-editors and frequent contributors. Eventually he began to sell illustrations to more mainstream publications.

He became more widely known as a cartoonist when his short story &quot;L&quot; appeared in &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;. &quot;L&quot;, along with two other stories, made up his first graphic novel, &quot;Flood! A Novel in Pictures&quot; (1992); a wordless, dream-like narrative of powerless citizens&#x27; struggles with authority in a rapidly deteriorating New York City. &quot;Flood&quot; won an American Book Award. Portions of his &quot;Flood!&quot; artwork were used for album covers for the bands Faith No More and Rage Against the Machine. In 2006, the Library of Congress acquired the original art for &quot;Flood! A Novel in Pictures&quot;, including preliminary drawings, sketches, and cover paintings. The complete &quot;Flood!&quot; Archive is housed in the Prints &amp; Photographs Division of the Library of Congress, which is open to the public.

In the 1990s, Drooker broadened his scope from graphic arts to painting, creating several covers for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and a book of illustrations of Allen Ginsberg&#x27;s poetry, &quot;Illuminated Poems&quot;. His third book, &quot;Street Posters &amp; Ballads&quot;, is a compilation of graphics, poems and songs about the Lower East Side. The book won the 1999 Firecracker Alternative Book Award for Outstanding Graphic Novel. 

He designed the animation for the 2010 film, &quot;Howl&quot;, a movie based on the epic poem by Allen Ginsberg, who collaborated with Drooker on the book &quot;Illuminated Poems&quot;. His best-selling book, &quot;Howl: A Graphic Novel,&quot; visualizes the poem with animation art Drooker designed for the film.

==Cultural references==

His painting &quot;Native New York&quot; inspired Lawrence Ferlinghetti&#x27;s &quot;Poem #7&quot; from his book &quot;A Far Rockaway of the Heart&quot;.

<text>The Home Guard Special Division 016 (; abbreviated as HV-016) is a former military unit of Norway, that was a part of the Home Guard. It was established after 1985 to &quot;stop terror- or sabotage actions that could weaken or paralyze Norway&#x27;s ability to mobilize its military and its ability to resist&quot;.

It was decommissioned on 1 January 2011. Investigation after the 2011 Norway attacks, revealed that only parliament had the authority to have the unit decommissioned, but the matter was brought to parliament after the fact.

==Background==
Formed in 1987 as a result of the possible threat posed by the Russian Spetsnaz, HV-016 (also informally known as HV-SPES) was an elite unit of the Norwegian Home Guard. The unit had detachments based in the 4 largest cities in Norway; Oslo, Trondheim, Bergen and Stavanger. Not a special forces unit per se, as the operators are not full-time employed in the unit, but it does participate in numerous exercises throughout the course of a year.

When the Home Guard was re-structured in 2005, HV-016 was made part of the newly formed I-Styrken, or Innsatsstyrken (Rapid Response Unit).

The unit was disbanded by the Norwegian government in September 2010.
==Resources==
HV-016 specialized in close protection of key military personnel and assets, CQB (Close Quarter Battle), and direct, offensive action.

The soldiers all had &quot;personlig sambandsmiddel&quot; (communication handset), and the officers and sergeants had weapons (with all operational parts – &quot;komplette våpen&quot;) and ammunition (&quot;treningsammunisjon&quot;) stored in their homes.&quot;.

==Training==

Sharpshooting from moving helicopters had been trained during training exercises in Denmark in 2007, 2008 and 2010 – the &quot;Sniper training Falcon Eye&quot; training maneuvers (&quot;øvelse&quot;).

In 2006, during an unannounced training maneuver, 40 soldiers from the unit were able to muster battle-ready in &quot;an hour and a half&quot;.

==Selection and personnel==
The soldiers were recruited among people who have finished their conscript duty in the Norwegian armed forces, and many of them have experience from international operations with other branches of the Norwegian forces, such as Telemark Battalion. Some also stem from Marinejegerkommandoen and Hærens Jegerkommando, the two special forces units in the Norwegian military.
The applicants go through a four-day selection period with a following two-week basic course for the ones who pass. After this, the cadets commence the regular exercises with the unit for 6 months before being considered full members.

The exact organization of HV-016 is not publicly known. Also, the number of, and identities of its operators, are kept secret.

==After decommissioning==
By January 2011, 94% of its former personnel in Oslo, Stavanger and Bergen gave up their contracts with Forsvaret, protesting what they considered an unfair and irrational process by military leadership.

After the 2011 attacks Norway is considering to re-establish an anti-terror unit of the Home Guard, &quot;Aftenposten&quot; wrote in November 2011.

===Review by Office of the Auditor General===

On December 12, 2011 media reported that the decommissioning of the unit will be investigated by the Office of the Auditor General. (3 years earlier, the same agency found &quot;a lack of tracibility within the documentation for significant decisions&quot; at the defence ministry.)

<doc id="1289377" wikidata="Q6175596" url="?curid=1289377" title="Jefferson Street Grounds">
<text>Jefferson Street Grounds was a baseball field located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was also known as Jefferson Park and Athletics Park. It was home to three different professional baseball teams, competing in three different leagues. Notably, it was the venue for the first game in National League history, played on April 22, 1876.

==History==
Baseball had first been played on the site in 1864. Several local clubs held their games there, including the historic Olympic Ball Club of Philadelphia, which had begun playing various varieties of town ball starting in the early 1830s and had adopted the &quot;New York game&quot; by 1860. When they began playing at the Jefferson site, the diamond was situated at the southeast corner, at 25th (first base) and Master (third base). The Olympics built a clubhouse along Master. Jefferson was behind right field. Local newspapers typically gave the ballfield location as &quot;25th and Jefferson&quot;.

The grounds would be home to three different professional teams:
* Athletic Club of Philadelphia (also known as the Philadelphia Athletics) from 1871 to 1876. The team competed in the National Association until 1875, and in the National League of Base Ball Clubs in 1876.
* Philadelphia Base Ball Club (also known as the Philadelphia White Stockings) from 1873 to 1875, when they shared the venue with the Athletics. The White Stockings competed in the National Association.
* Philadelphia Athletics from 1883 to 1890. This franchise competed in the American Association.

===25th and Jefferson, 1864 to 1876===
The grounds were located on a large block bounded by Jefferson Street (north); 25th Street (east); Master Street (south); and 27th Street (west). Across the street to the south was the Spring Garden Reservoir, which has since been filled in. Although often listed as one ballpark, the 1870s diamond was located in the opposite corner of the block from the 1880s diamond. 

The facility opened to professional league baseball during 1871, as early as May 15. The club&#x27;s first official National Association home game was played on June 3. The seating capacity was meager, only 5,000 seats. 

The inaugural National League game was played there, on Saturday, April 22, 1876, between Athletic and Boston; the Bostons won, 6–5. By a quirk of fate, it was the only National League game played that day, all others being rained out. This game is often pointed to as the beginning of Major League Baseball.

===26th and Jefferson, 1883 to 1890===

After an early Athletics franchise was expelled from the National League following the 1876 season, the field fell into disuse. The City of Philadelphia cut 26th Street through the lot, allowing the eastern half of the large block to be developed. The western half remained vacant. A new American Association team, also called the Athletics, decided to move from their Oakdale Park after their inaugural 1882 season. 

Beginning in 1883, the Athletics leased the western half of the Jefferson Street lot, and erected a new diamond and grandstands at the northwest corner. Local newspapers then referred to the ballfield location as &quot;26th and Jefferson&quot;, where there was an entrance gate. Also by this time, the venue was being called Athletic Grounds or Athletic Park.

The Athletics opened the new ballpark to the public on Saturday, April 7, 1883 for a preseason exhibition game against Yale University which Athletic won 12 to 0. It was reported that the new ballpark could accommodate 5,000 to 6,000 fans.

One of the largest crowds at the ballpark was recorded on April 4, 1887 for the first game of Philadelphia&#x27;s 1887 City Series when 9,183 tickets were sold and an &quot;immense crowd&quot; turned out to see the Phillies defeat the Athletics by a score of 10 to 2.

Prior to the 1889 season, a new band stand was erected on the left field side next to the grandstand large enough for a 25-piece military band. 

On March 1, 1890, the Kensington Rovers and Philadelphia South End soccer clubs met at the ballpark in what the Philadelphia Inquirer called &quot;the roughest and most exciting game of football (under English Association rules) that has ever been played in this city...&quot;

The last major league game played in the park was October 11, 1890. 

The &quot;Athletics&quot; teams that played at the Jefferson Street Grounds do not have any direct lineage to the Philadelphia Athletics franchise that was an inaugural member of the American League in 1901, and exists today as the Athletics.

==Ballpark site today==
The ball field still exists in a revised form. 

The ballpark site is currently occupied by various structures including Daniel Boone Public School, also known as Camelot Academy, at 1435 N 26th St, and the Athletic Recreation Center and its ball fields. The field at the northwest corner of the lot approximates the location of the 1883–1890 diamond.

<doc id="1289381" wikidata="Q407478" url="?curid=1289381" title="Air Macau">
<text>Air Macau is the flag carrier of Macau. It operates services to 24 destinations in Mainland China, Indonesia, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam, from the airline&#x27;s home base at Macau International Airport. In 2014, Air Macau carried 2.12 million passengers with an average load factor of 68.20% and carried 15,900 tonnes of cargo and mail.

==History==
The airline was established on 13 September 1994, and began commercial operations on 9 November 1995, with a flight from Macau to Beijing and Shanghai. Prior to 1995, there was no air service to Macau since 1962 other than the helicopter service. Seaplane service had been provided by Macau Air Transport Company from 1948 to 1961. One-aircraft service between Beijing, Shanghai and Taipei began on 8 December 1995. The first pure-freighter service was launched on 7 October 2002, between Taipei and Shenzhen via Macau.

In 1999 the airline had 1.1 million passengers each year, with 80% of them originating from two cities in Taiwan: Kaohsiung and Taipei.

In 2006 Air Macau was owned by China National Aviation Holding (51%), TAP Air Portugal (20%), STDM (14%), EVA Air (5%), the government of Macau (5%) and Macau investors (5%). It employs 1,245 staff (at March 2016). In 2009 two companies controlled by Edmund Ho, the Chief Executive of Macau sold a combined 1.25% stake to Air China for a sum undisclosed by the parties. In 2010 TAP sold its share to Air China.

==Corporate affairs==

The head office is currently in the Edifício CNAC () in Sé (Cathedral Parish) on the Macau Peninsula. Previously it was in the Edifício Tai Wah () in Sé.

==Destinations==
The airline currently operates 24 destinations including 15 destinations in mainland China.

===Codeshare agreements===
Air Macau has codeshare agreements with the following airlines:
* Air China
* All Nippon Airways
* Asiana Airlines
* Philippine Airlines
* Shandong Airlines
* Shenzhen Airlines
* Thai Airways International
Air Macau and All Nippon Airways officially launch frequent flyer program cooperation from July 1, 2010. Air Macau Privileges members will earn mileages on all scheduled flights operated by All Nippon Airways and marketed by All Nippon Airways or Air Macau, and redeem Award Travel on all scheduled flights operated and marketed by All Nippon Airways.

==Frequent flyer==
Air Macau has its own frequent flyer program called Lotus Miles (formerly Privileges). On 1 January 2015, Privileges merged with Phoenix Miles, which is the frequent flyer program of Air China, hence retaining the current Lotus Miles.

==Fleet==
===Current fleet===
, Air Macau operates an all-Airbus fleet composed of the following aircraft:

===Former fleet===
Two Boeing 727-100Fs were rented to provide air cargo service to Shenzhen and Taiwan from 2002 to 2006; both have returned to revenue service Transmile Air Services (and repainted from Air Macau livery). Both aircraft were replaced with two A300-600RFs owned by Air Macau. These two Airbus A300 left the company in 2012. Two old A321-100 were replaced by two new A321-200 in 2013. In 2020 two Airbus A319-100 were retired.

===Livery===
Although Air Macau serves as Macau&#x27;s flag carrier, the flag of the Special Administrative Region of Macau has never appeared on any of its aircraft, similar to Hong Kong&#x27;s Cathay Pacific. However, unlike Cathay Pacific, which carried a Union Jack on its aircraft prior to the 1997 Handover of Hong Kong, the flag of Portugal never appeared on any Air Macau aircraft prior to the 1999 Handover of Macau.

===Macau Asia Express===
Macau Asia Express was a failed low-cost airline project, which was to be based in Macau and originally to be launched in 2007, offering scheduled flights mostly to mainland China. It was founded on 24 January 2006 with an initial funding of $30 million. It was owned by Air Macau (51%) and ST-CNAC (CNAC and Shun Tak Holdings) (49%). The aircraft fleet would have consisted of 6 Airbus A320 short-medium haul jet aircraft, which was planned to be expanded to 15–20 aircraft over the first years in operation.

In November 2007, the &quot;Macau Daily News&quot; reported that Macau Asia Express was suffering from funding problems, which led to a delay at the taking-over of ordered aircraft, and finally the revocation of its Air Operator&#x27;s Certificate in 2008.

<doc id="1289390" wikidata="Q861954" url="?curid=1289390" title="Canacona taluka">
<text>Canacona is an administrative region in the district of South Goa, Goa state, India.

Canacona is one of the six subdivisions (&quot;talukas&quot;) that constitute the South Goa district. It is bounded on the north by the taluka of Quepem, on the northeast by Sanguem, on the south by the state of Karnataka, and on the west by the Arabian Sea. The town of Chaudi is the administrative headquarters of the taluka of Canacona.

The name Canacona is a corruption of the name Konkan. The area was one of the districts of the former Kingdom of Soonda, itself a remnant of the former Vijayanagara Empire. When Soonda was invaded and partially occupied by Hyder Ali of Mysore, the heirless Raja ceded the remaining parts to Portugal; and these were incorporated into Goa as the districts of Quepem, Sanguem, and Canacona. In the recent elections, Kishen Naikgaunkar got elected as the President of the Canacona, and Samba Naik Desai got elected as an Attorney.

Canacona was incorporated into Goa in AD 1794. Like most of Goa, the culture of the district reflects an Indo-Portuguese fusion, yet Canacona experienced less Lusitanisation than the central &quot;Velhas Conquistas&quot; (Old Conquests) of Goa.

== Demographics ==

== Transport ==

The Canacona railway station of the Konkan Railways is located at the center of the district, close to the tourist attractions of the coast. The railway junction of Margao to the north is the closest major rail station. Buses from Bombay may terminate at Panaji (Panjim), but some go on to Margao. The Canacona bus stand opened in 2004 is considered by many to be among the best designed bus-stands in India. Highway Route NH17 from Bombay to Goa connects Chaudi to Margao and Panaji. The newly constructed Canacona bypass in November 2019 NH 66 highway named after Manohar Parrikar the bypass named after him &quot;Manohar Parrikar bypass&quot; as it was his and many people dream. It shortens 10 km of distance from old highway of 18 km and this bypass is of just 8 km connecting mashem to char rasta which can be completed the distance in couple of minutes with the scenic coastal view. The scenic coastal road connects Navelim, Chinchinim, Assolna, Betul, and Canaguinim.

Additional Konkan Railway station in Cancona started functioning in 2013 in Loliem which is the southernmost village in Cancona right on Goa-Karnataka border.

== Tourism ==
Tourism is rather human-scale, people-friendly and relatively more-affordable than other parts of Goa. Away from the coast, Canacona and its neighbouring district of Quepem have a number of off-the-beaten-track destinations and unusual festivals.

The tourism industry, which developed first in central Goa, did not develop in Canacona until the early 1990s. Much of the tourist infrastructure here is run through small-scale local initiatives.

In Goa, generally, locals have mixed feelings though about the impact of tourism on the region, with views increasingly pointing to the environmental degradation and social distortions due to the growth of this sector; however, the discussion remains largely academic, with few people directly involved in the field being influenced by the debates. Canacona was relatively left untouched by tourism until the early nineties as it was not easily accessible by public transport and the local economy wasn&#x27;t enterprising enough to cater to tourists. Incidentally there was just one restaurant in the main street of canacona where one could expect the local meal during the day in the eighties.

=== Tourist attractions ===

Canacona&#x27;s beach belt, &#x27;discovered&#x27; by tourism only after the 1990s, is among the most scenic. Palolem is a milder recreation of an east-meets-west Goan beach, with a rich variety of exotic food and accommodation to cater to the international palate. Polem is another beach situated at the south of Canacona which too is popular among tourists.

But beyond the better-known Palolem and Agonda, there are nearly a dozen-and-half lesser-known (or even hidden) beaches. Some are just tiny strips of sand. Vaturem and Xendrem are secluded beaches. Quepem&#x27;s narrow sea front has a two or three beaches, known for their picture-postcard quality.

The most prominent Hindu institution of Canacona, and indeed of all Goa, is the Parthagali Math (&quot;Portuguese Hindu Mutt&quot;) - a five centuries-old ashram and cult headquarters built in a mix of Portuguese and Hindu architectural styles. Besides, there are famous Hindu temples at Zambaulim and Fatorpa. Also the Mallikarjun Temple, Shristhal built by the Kshatriya samaj is very beautiful and known for its versatile festivals.

Canacona is one part of Goa where hillocks jut out almost directly into the sea. Villages are tucked away in low-lying areas, which are carpeted by a sea of green-topped coconut trees. Until foreign migration and tourism came to this area, the coconut tree was the means by which many eked a living, apart from fishing.

Some tourists are accommodated in beach huts, temporary beachside thatched huts built on coconut trees usually above ground level, right on the beach, during the fair weather (October–May) season.

Sanvordem and Quepem towns have many small, functional hotels. Attached to the temples of Mashem, Mallikarjun and Zambaulim, rooms are available in Agrashalas (&quot;Dharmashalas&quot; or pilgrim-hostels), primarily for pilgrims.

==Wildlife==

Dolphin-watching and fishing trips attract visitors, especially British and Scandinavian visitors. The beach villages of Palolem and Agonda and the more deserted fort at the Cabo de Rama are developing as tourist destinations.

The Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary, Goa&#x27;s second-largest wildlife sanctuary, is located within this district. Its terrain is fairly plain, with hills in the south and east. Much of the sanctuary is covered with dense forests, with a few open grasslands. Forest crown density is often over 50%. Some trees, Goa&#x27;s loftiest, touch 30 metres.

Villagers have reported sighting tigers, according to officials.

Birds are aplenty; some two hundred species could be spotted, given time and patience. These include the Indian pied hornbill, large golden-backed woodpecker and the great Indian woodpecker.

The Forest Department&#x27;s scenic but simple rest-house is on the highway at Poinguinim, some 4 km away.

==Culture==

The Shantadurga temple at Fatorpa, resorted to by both Hindus and Christians, holds its Zatra (i.e., &quot;Rath-Yatra&quot; or Pilgrimage-festival) on the ninth day of the Hindu month of Margashirish. It falls in Goa&#x27;s cool season, sometime in December–January. Huge crowds from all over Goa make their way to this small remote village in the district of Quepem, some 5 km from Cuncolim.

During the Zatra, a tall, intricate, decorated, three-tiered wooden chariot (&quot;rath&quot;), into which the idol of the deity is placed, is and drawn by male devotees in a night procession.

Goa has a range of syncretic practices, where both Hindus and Christians worship at each other&#x27;s shrines. Nearly every Goan Christian can trace ancestral roots to Hindu ancestors about five centuries ago.

The Hindu priests of the Shantadurga temple know many Goan Christian families by name, because they come to the festival yearly and donate money or goods.

American anthropologist Dr Robert S. Newman conducted detailed studies on this place and its phenomenon of syncretism.

The Shantadurga temple was originally in the village of Cuncolim, located in the consuelho of Salsette a few kilometers away, but was relocated across the then &#x27;international boundary&#x27; into the Kingdom of Soonda when the Goa government expelled the Hindus and ordered their shrines demolished.

Another festival celebrated at the Shantadurga temple is the Festival of Umbrellas, or Sontreos. This is observed on the fifth day of Phalgun (usually in March). Once again, both Hindus and Christians take part in a mix of practises that crosses over religious border-lines.

In nearby Quepem, the temple of the Hindu deity Damodar, colloquially called &quot;Dam-bab&quot;, was relocated from Margao to the village of Zambaulim in what was then the Panchamahal district of the Kingdom of Soonda. Margao&#x27;s businessmen have close ties with the deity and often conduct their business invoking it.

The Mallikarjun Temple is at Shristhal, some 2.5 km away from Chaudi on the main-road leading to Karwar and is one where devotees head for advice from oracles called the &#x27;kaul&#x27;. The advice of the oracles is taken either from priests in a trance or by them interpreting the way flower petals drop down. Locally, Mallikarjun is a popular deity, as visible from the names of local educational institutions. This centuries-old temple was renovated in 1778.

Canacona&#x27;s supposedly aboriginal population, the Kunbis (with Gaonkar or Velip as their surnames) live in areas around Gaondongri, Cotigao, Chapoli (the site for a proposed new dam), Assali, Kulem, Khola and Agonda; the Velips are the priest class drawn from among the Kunbis.

The village of Loliem has a couple of centuries-old &#x27;hero&#x27; stones, etchings on stone to record historic events of the time dating back many centuries. This village&#x27;s statues of the Hindu deity Betal itself possibly goes back to the seventh century if not earlier, according to &quot;cultural-historian&quot; Phaldessai.

Canacona has several statues of Betal.

==Anjediva==

Visits to the island of Anjediva, located to the south-west of Canacona, are possible by permission of the Station Commander of the Indian Navy&#x27;s Seabird Base, which occupies the island. Future visits could be curtailed due to plans by the Navy to step up security.

To visit the island from Goa one has to proceed by any bus going to or via Karwar, leaving in the morning; the journey is about 2½ hours. From the Karwar bus stand one must walk the short distance to the wharves of Karwar port, from where a ferry takes one to the island. One might need to alight into a smaller boat before reaching the shore due to the shallowness of the island&#x27;s waters.

<doc id="1289395" wikidata="Q1500346" url="?curid=1289395" title="Xanthelasma">
<text>Xanthelasma is a sharply demarcated yellowish deposit of cholesterol underneath the skin. It usually occurs on or around the eyelids (&quot;xanthelasma palpebrarum&quot;, abbreviated XP). While they are neither harmful to the skin nor painful, these minor growths may be disfiguring and can be removed. There is a growing body of evidence for the association between xanthelasma deposits and blood low-density lipoprotein levels and increased risk of atherosclerosis.

A xanthelasma may be referred to as a xanthoma when becoming larger and nodular, assuming tumorous proportions. Xanthelasma is often classified simply as a subtype of xanthoma.

== Diagnosis ==

Xanthelasma in the form of XP can be diagnosed from clinical impression, although in some cases it may need to be distinguished (differential diagnosis) from other conditions, especially necrobiotic xanthogranuloma, syringoma, palpebral sarcoidosis, sebaceous hyperplasia, Erdheim–Chester disease, lipoid proteinosis (Urbach–Wiethe disease), and the syndrome of adult-onset asthma and periocular xanthogranuloma (AAPOX). Differential diagnosis can be accomplished by surgical excision followed by microscopic examination by a pathologist (biopsy to determine histopathology). The typical clinical impression of XP is soft, yellowish papules, plaques, or nodules, symmetrically distributed on the medial side of the upper eyelids; sometimes the lower eyelids are affected as well.

==Treatment==
Xanthelasmata can be removed with a trichloroacetic acid peel, surgery, lasers or cryotherapy. Removal may cause, although uncommon, scarring and pigment changes.

== Prognosis ==

Recurrence is common: 40% of patients with XP had recurrence after primary surgical excision, 60% after secondary excision, and 80% when all four eyelids were involved. A possible cause might be insufficiently deep excisions.

== Epidemiology ==
Xanthelasma is a rare disorder in the general population, with a variable incidence of 0.56 to 1.5% in western developed countries. The age of onset ranges from 15 to 75, with a peak in the 4th to 5th decades of life. There also seems to be a greater prevalence in females, but this might be due to higher consciousness to cosmetic defects.

==Etymology==
The word is derived from Greek &quot;xanthós, &quot; &#x27;yellow&#x27; and &quot;élasma, έλασμα&quot;, &#x27;foil&#x27;. The plural is &quot;xanthelasmata&quot;.

<text>Razavi Khorasan province () is one of the 31 provinces of Iran, located in northeastern Iran. Its capital is the city of Mashhad, the second-most-populous city in Iran.

Razavi Khorasan is one of the three provinces that were created after the division of Khorasan Province in 2004. In 2014, it was placed in Region 5 with Mashhad as the location of the region&#x27;s secretariat.

==History==

The Greater Khorasan has witnessed the rise and fall of many dynasties and governments in its territory throughout history. Various tribes of the Arabs, Turks, Kurds and Turkmens brought changes to the region time and time again.

Ancient geographers of Iran divided Iran (&quot;Ērānshahr&quot;) into eight segments of which the most flourishing and largest was the territory of Greater Khorasan. Esfarayen, among other cities of the province, was one of the focal points for residence of the Aryan tribes after entering Iran.

The Parthian Empire was based near Merv in Khorasan for many years. During the Sassanid dynasty, the province was governed by a &quot;Spahbod&quot; (Lieutenant General) called &quot;Padgošban&quot; and four margraves, each commander of one of the four parts of the province.

Khorasan was divided into four parts during the Muslim conquest of Persia, each section being named after one of the four largest cities, Nishapur, Merv, Herat, and Balkh.

In the year 651, the army of the Rashidun Caliphate conquered Khorasan. The territory remained under the rule of the Abbasid Caliphate until 820, followed by the rule of the Iranian Tahirid dynasty until 873, and the Samanid dynasty in 900.

Khorasan was the largest province of Iran until it was divided into three provinces on 29 September 2004. The provinces approved by the parliament of Iran (on 18 May 2004) and the Council of Guardians (on 29 May 2004) were Khorasan-e Razavi, North Khorasan, and South Khorasan.

==Demographics==
===Ethnicity===

== Archaeological sites ==

=== Kohandezh hills ===
Excavations conducted by an American team between 1935 and 1940 in Nishapur discovered museum-worthy objects, which were shared with the government of the Shah. The Metropolitan Museum of Art&#x27;s publications document its own Nishapur ceramics from those excavations. For half a century after 1945 the site of Nishapur was ransacked to feed the international market demand for early Islamic works of art. Nowadays, the Kohandezh hills reveal the remains from those excavations.

===Shadiyakh===
Shadiyakh was an important palace in old Nishapur up to the 7th century, and became more important and populated after that. The palace was completely ruined in the 13th century. It was the home of notables such as Farid al-Din Attar, whose tomb is found in Shadiyakh.

Introduced in 1996&#x27;s &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;, Roose is lord of House Bolton, the second most powerful Northern house behind the Starks. The Boltons are notorious for their cruelty and custom of flaying their enemies. He also appears in &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot; (1998), &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot; (2000), and &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot; (2011).

Roose joins Robb Stark&#x27;s rebellion as one of his chief lieutenants. However, he secretly orchestrates the Red Wedding alongside Lord Tywin Lannister and Lord Walder Frey, receiving the title of Warden of the North and dominion over the Northern kingdom after personally murdering Robb. His rule is punctuated by unrest and several forces conspire to unseat him. 

==Character==
===Description===
At the beginning of &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;, Roose is a bannerman of Lord Eddard Stark whose seat is at the Dreadfort. He is known as the &quot;Leech Lord&quot; due to regular leechings meant to improve his health. He served House Stark in Robert&#x27;s Rebellion and the Greyjoy Rebellion.

Roose is often described as an unassuming-looking man, ageless, clean-shaven with pallid skin, with an apathetic demeanor. His most prominent feature are his strangely pale and cold eyes, so light as to almost blend with the sclera. He is described as mild-mannered, but also remorseless and unforgiving. While his voice is small and soft, he does not need to raise it in order to inspire silence and attention; Ser Jaime Lannister and Robb Stark both remark that even just his silence is threatening. His personal motto is &quot;A peaceful land, a quiet people&quot;. He often dresses in a pale pink fur cloak embroidered in blood red to symbolize his family&#x27;s custom of flaying.

Roose illicitly practices the ancient and banned tradition of the first night, in which a lord has the right to have sexual intercourse with female subjects on their wedding night. This practice resulted in the birth of his bastard son, Ramsay. He ordered his depraved servant Reek to help raise the child. Roose had only one trueborn son, Domeric, and Roose suspects that Ramsay poisoned Domeric to become his heir. Left without a trueborn heir, Roose brings Ramsay to the Dreadfort to serve as the castellan.

== Storylines ==

===Novels===
Roose is not a point of view character in the novels, so his actions are witnessed and interpreted through the eyes of other people, such as Catelyn Stark, Arya Stark and Theon Greyjoy.

=== &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; ===

Roose answers Robb Stark&#x27;s call to arms in his campaign against the Iron Throne and House Lannister. Robb gives Roose command of part of the Northern army when the host splits up at The Twins, and he leads the attack on Tywin Lannister&#x27;s forces in the Battle of the Green Fork. The battle ends in a Lannister victory and Roose retreats with the survivors to the causeway of Moat Cailin. However, Roose&#x27;s defeat allows Robb to secure a larger victory and to capture Jaime Lannister.

=== &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot; ===

To form an alliance with House Frey, Roose is offered by Lord Walder Frey one of his female family members hand in marriage, as well as offering the prospective bride&#x27;s weight in silver for her dowry. Roose chooses Walda Frey, the fattest female of House Frey. He also makes an alliance with the Brave Companions, Essosi mercenaries originally employed by Tywin, to help the Northerners capture Harrenhal from the Lannister force occupying it. After capturing Harrenhal, Roose takes Arya Stark as a servant, mistaking her for a commoner.

=== &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot; ===

While at Harrenhal, Roose works to weaken Robb&#x27;s position, sending the Northern army on suicidal missions. Vargo Hoat brings Jaime Lannister to Harrenhal, having cut off Jaime&#x27;s hand in hope of blaming Roose and preventing the Boltons from allying with the Lannisters. Roose has Jaime sent back to King&#x27;s Landing after Jaime assures Roose that he will not blame him. Roose then travels to The Twins for Edmure Tully&#x27;s wedding to Roslin Frey. At the wedding, the Freys betray the Starks and Roose personally murders Robb with a knife through the heart. It is revealed that Roose had conspired with the Freys and Tywin Lannister to betray the Starks. As reward for his service, Tywin names Roose the new Warden of the North.

=== &quot;A Feast for Crows&quot; and &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot; ===

Roose returns to the North with his forces, joined by two thousand Frey men. Meeting with Ramsay (now legitimised as a Bolton) and a captive Theon Greyjoy, the Boltons travel to Barrowton for Ramsay&#x27;s wedding to Jeyne Poole, forced to assume the identity of Arya Stark. After hearing that Stannis Baratheon has captured Deepwood Motte, Roose decides to move the wedding to Winterfell to bait Stannis out. The Boltons and their Northern allies (many of whom are only grudgingly pledging fealty to the Boltons, or plan to betray them) remain at Winterfell after the wedding in anticipation of Stannis&#x27; attack. Tensions are high during the wedding due to the anger of the Northmen at the Freys. Three of the Freys who had been travelling with Lord Wyman Manderly of White Harbor, who lost his younger son Ser Wendel Manderly at the Red Wedding, have disappeared, and are heavily implied to have been put in pies which Wyman gives to the Freys and Boltons, eating some himself. Lady Barbrey Dustin of Barrowton, the younger sister of Bethany Ryswell, tells Theon that Roose has no feelings and plays with people for amusement. She also insinuates that Roose hopes to become King in the North, not just Warden, because the Lannisters are weakened. When one of Walder Frey&#x27;s grandsons, Little Walder Frey, is found murdered, their uncle Ser Hosteen Frey attacks Wyman, leading to a fight in which White Harbor and Frey men are killed. Roose is forced to send them both out of Winterfell to encounter Stannis, in order to weaken both Frey&#x27;s and Manderly&#x27;s armies.

;Notes
== TV adaptation ==

Roose Bolton is played by Michael McElhatton in the HBO television adaption of the series of books. He and the rest of the cast were nominated for Screen Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series in 2014.

=== Second season ===
Roose declares for King in the North Robb Stark and serves as a chief member of his war council. After the Battle of Oxcross, Robb admonishes Roose when he advocates flaying Lannister prisoners to obtain information. After Theon Greyjoy betrays the Starks and seizes Winterfell, Roose brings the news to Robb and offers to send his bastard son Ramsay Snow with a force of Dreadfort men to oust Theon and the Ironborn from Winterfell.

=== Third season ===
Following the Northern army&#x27;s arrival at Harrenhal, Roose presents a letter from Ramsay claiming that the Ironborn sacked Winterfell before fleeing. Robb orders Roose and the Bolton forces to hold Harrenhal while the rest of his army rides to Riverunn. One of Roose&#x27;s men-at-arms, Locke, captures the escaped Jaime Lannister and his escort Brienne of Tarth, cutting off Jaime&#x27;s hand in the process, before bringing the two to Harrenhal.
Roose agrees to free Jaime, but keeps Brienne as a hostage; though Jaime later returns to secure her release. Roose travels to The Twins for the wedding of Edmure Tully and Roslin Frey. However, it is revealed that Roose has conspired with Lord Walder Frey to betray the Starks, and at the wedding the Freys and Bolton slaughter the Stark forces, with Roose personally killing Robb. As part of the Bolton-Frey alliance, Roose agrees to marry Walder&#x27;s daughter Walda - Walder offers him the bride&#x27;s weight in silver as dowry, so Roose decides to marry the fattest of Walder&#x27;s daughters. In the aftermath of the massacre, Roose reveals that Winterfell was actually sacked by his bastard Ramsay, who subsequently flayed the Ironborn garrison there and took Theon prisoner. As reward for his defection, Tywin Lannister names Roose the Warden of the North.

=== Fourth season ===
With the Ironborn holding Moat Cailin - the fortification barring passage between the North and the rest of Westeros - Roose is forced to smuggle himself back into the North. Upon his return to the Dreadfort, he chastises Ramsay for having gelded Theon and sending terms of surrender to the Greyjoys without his approval, while reminding Ramsay of his bastard parentage. Insulted, Ramsay demonstrates how effectively he has broken Theon (whom he has since renamed &quot;Reek&quot;) by having Reek shave him, even after revealing Roose&#x27;s murder of Robb, while also coaxing Reek into revealing he faked the deaths of Bran Stark and Rickon Stark. After Ramsay points out that the other Northerners will turn on the Boltons if it is revealed that there is a living male Stark, Roose tasks Locke with hunting down Bran and Rickon and to kill Jon Snow, Robb&#x27;s bastard half-brother. Roose also sends Ramsay and Reek to lift the siege of Moat Cailin; when Ramsay is successful, Roose presents him with a royal decree of legitimization as a trueborn Bolton. Roose subsequently moves to rebuild and occupy Winterfell.

=== Fifth season ===
In the aftermath of Tywin Lannister&#x27;s death and Ramsay&#x27;s murder of a disobedient vassal and his family, Roose seeks to secure House Bolton&#x27;s position by arranging to have Ramsay marry Sansa Stark. In doing so, Roose seemingly secures an alliance with the forces of The Vale and its Lord Protector Petyr Baelish. After Ramsay torments Sansa by having Reek serve them at dinner, Roose announces that he and Walda are expecting a son. However, later Roose privately reassures Ramsay of his position as his heir, and asks him to assist in defeating Stannis Baratheon&#x27;s army. To this end, Roose permits Ramsay and his men to launch a sneak attack on Stannis&#x27; camp, destroying the army&#x27;s supplies. With the supplies destroyed and most of Stannis&#x27; army subsequently deserting him, the Boltons easily defeat Stannis&#x27;s army when they attempt to lay siege to Winterfell, but in the aftermath of the battle, Theon Greyjoy and Sansa manage to escape, severely jeopardizing House Bolton&#x27;s rule in the North.

=== Sixth season ===
Despite their victory over Stannis, Roose warns Ramsay that the North will someday have to face the Lannisters, and chastises him for allowing Sansa and Theon to escape, as Sansa was crucial to unifying the North. He implies that if Sansa is not recovered, Ramsay&#x27;s position as heir may be usurped by Walda&#x27;s baby. Soon afterwards, it is announced that Walda has given birth to a boy; Ramsay immediately kills Roose by stabbing him in the stomach, before setting his dogs upon Walda and the baby, leaving Ramsay as the last remaining Bolton. Ramsay is ultimately killed when Jon Snow retakes Winterfell in the Battle of the Bastards, leaving House Bolton extinct.

<doc id="1289417" wikidata="Q1066052" url="?curid=1289417" title="Order of the Sacred Treasure">
<text>The is a Japanese order, established on 4 January 1888 by Emperor Meiji as the Order of Meiji. Originally awarded in eight classes (from 8th to 1st, in ascending order of importance), since 2003 it has been awarded in six classes, the lowest two medals being abolished that year. Originally a male-only decoration, the order has been made available to women since 1919.

The Order of the Sacred Treasure, which had 8 ranks until 2003, was awarded as a slightly lower rank than the Order of the Rising Sun for men and the Order of the Precious Crown for women. For example, the 1st class of the Order of the Sacred Treasure has been treated as between the 1st class and the 2nd class of the Order of the Rising Sun and the Order of the Precious Crown, and the 2nd class of the Order of the Sacred Treasure has been treated as between the 2nd class and the 3rd class of the Order of the Rising Sun and the Order of the Precious Crown.

Since 2003, the Order of the Sacred Treasure has been given the same rank as the Order of the Rising Sun. The Order of the Rising Sun is awarded with an emphasis on achievements to the state, and the Order of the Sacred Treasure is awarded with an emphasis on long-term public service. Since military achievements are not included in the criteria for awarding the Order of the Rising Sun, Japan Self-Defense Forces personnel are awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasure for their long service in public service. For example, the Chief of Staff, Joint Staff, the highest rank in the JSDF, receives the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Sacred Treasure (1st class). The Order of the Sacred Treasure is awarded to persons who have been engaged for many years in the public service of the national and local governments, or in the following non-public services that are equivalent to public service, and who have accumulated distinguished service.
* Work directly involved in education or research at school.
* Work directly involved in social welfare at various facilities.
* Work directly involved in medical care or health guidance
* Work commissioned by the national or local governments, such as conciliation commissioners, volunteer probation officers, and welfare commissioners.
* Work that is extremely dangerous.
* Work in an extremely mentally or physically demanding environment.
* Work in an obscure field other than those listed in the preceding items.

Since 2003, the number representing rank included in the official name of the order was removed. As a result, although numbers representing ranks were sometimes used in common names, the formal names such as &quot;勲一等&quot; (&quot;Kun-ittō&quot;, First Class) and 勲二等 (&quot;Kun-nitō&quot;, Second Class) were no longer used.

==Classes==
Before 2003, the Order could be awarded in any of eight classes. In 2003 the seventh and eighth classes were dissolved, leaving six. Conventionally, a diploma is prepared to accompany the insignia of the order, and in some rare instances, the personal signature of the emperor will have been added. As an illustration of the wording of the text, a translation of a representative 1929 diploma says:
&quot;By the grace of Heaven, Emperor of Japan, seated on the throne occupied by the same dynasty from time immemorial,

We confer the &quot;Second Class of the Imperial Order of Meiji&quot; upon Henry Waters Taft, a citizen of the United States of America and a director of the Japan Society of New York, and invest him with the insignia of the same class of the &quot;Order of the Double Rays of the Rising Sun,&quot; in expression of the good will which we entertain towards him.

&quot;In witness whereof, we have hereunto set our hand and caused the Grand Seal of State to be affixed at the Imperial Palace, Tokyo, this thirteenth day of the fifth month of the fourth year of Shōwa, corresponding to the 2,589th year from the accession to the throne of Emperor Jimmu.&quot;
==Insignia==

The insignia of the order incorporates symbols for the three imperial treasures: the &quot;Yata Mirror&quot;, so sacred that not even the Emperor is allowed to look at it; the &quot;Yasakani Jewel&quot;, which is made of the finest jade; and the &quot;Emperor&#x27;s personal sword&quot;.

The &quot;star&quot; for the &quot;Grand Cordon&quot; and &quot;Second Class&quot; is similar to the badge as described above, but effectively with &quot;two&quot; sets of Maltese crosses, one in gilt and one placed diagonally in silver. It is worn on the left chest by the Grand Cordon, on the right chest (without any other insignia) by the 2nd class.

The &quot;badge&quot; for the first through sixth classes is a Maltese cross, in gilt (1st–4th classes), gilt and silver (5th class) and silver (6th class), with white enameled rays (representing the sword). The central disc is blue, bearing an eight-pointed silver star (representing the mirror), surrounded by a wreath with red-enameled dots (representing the jewel). The badge is suspended on a ribbon, worn as a sash on the right shoulder by the Grand Cordon, as a necklet by males of the 2nd and 3rd classes, on the left chest (the ribbon folded into a triangle) by the 4th to 6th classes (with a rosette for the 4th class). For females of the 2nd to 6th classes, the ribbon is a bow worn on the left shoulder (with a rosette for the 4th class).

Until 2003, when it was abolished, the &quot;badge&quot; of the &quot;seventh and eighth classes&quot; was an eight-pointed silver medal, partially gilded for the 7th class, with representations of just the mirror and the jewel. The badge is suspended on a ribbon, worn by men on the left chest (the ribbon folded into a triangle). For women, the ribbon is a bow worn on the left shoulder.

Until 2003, the &quot;ribbon&quot; of the order was very pale blue with a gold stripe near the borders; since then the ribbon has been light blue, but retains the gold stripe near the borders. When the ribbon is worn alone, the ribbon for the Fourth Class and above incorporates a blue-and-gold rosette (very pale blue until 2003), with a solid gold bar for the Grand Cordon, a gold and silver bar for the Second Class, a solid silver bar for the Third Class and only the rosette for the Fourth Class. The ribbon for the Fifth and Sixth Classes has a centered blue disc (very pale blue until 2003) with gold rays radiating from its center, eight rays for the Fifth Class and six rays for the Sixth Class. Formerly, the ribbon for the Seventh and Eighth Classes had a centered very pale blue disc with gold rays radiating from its center, four rays for the Seventh Class and three rays for the Eighth Class.

==After the 2003 reform==
In 2003 the lowest two classes of the Order were abolished. Moreover, the badges of the Order will from now on be suspended from three white-enamelled paulownia leaves.

<text>Joanne Dru (born Joan Letitia LaCock; January 31, 1922 – September 10, 1996) was an American film and television actress, known for such films as &quot;Red River&quot;, &quot;She Wore a Yellow Ribbon&quot;, &quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot;, and &quot;Wagon Master&quot;.

==Career==
Born in Logan, West Virginia, Dru moved to New York City in 1940 at the age of eighteen. After finding employment as a model, she was chosen by Al Jolson to appear in the cast of his Broadway show &quot;Hold On to Your Hats&quot;. When she moved to Hollywood, she found work in the theater. Dru was spotted by a talent scout and made her first film appearance in &quot;Abie&#x27;s Irish Rose&quot; (1946). Over the next decade, Dru appeared frequently in films and on television. She was often cast in western films such as Howard Hawks&#x27;s &quot;Red River&quot; (1948), and the John Ford productions &quot;She Wore a Yellow Ribbon&quot; (1949), and &quot;Wagon Master&quot; (1950).

She gave a well-received performance in the dramatic film &quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot; (1949), which went on to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, played a college graduate turned gangster&#x27;s unhappy moll opposite Edmund O&#x27;Brien in the crime noir &quot;711 Ocean Drive&quot; (1950), and co-starred with Dan Dailey in &quot;The Pride of St. Louis&quot; (1952), about major-league baseball pitcher Jerome &quot;Dizzy&quot; Dean. She appeared in the James Stewart drama &quot;Thunder Bay&quot; in 1953 and then the Martin and Lewis comedy &quot;3 Ring Circus&quot; (1954). Her film career petered out by the end of the 1950s, but she continued working frequently in television, most notably as Babs Hooten on the 1960–61 ABC sitcom, &quot;Guestward, Ho!&quot;

After &quot;Guestward, Ho!&quot;, she appeared sporadically for the rest of the 1960s and the first half of the 1970s, with one feature film appearance, in &quot;Sylvia&quot; (1965), and eight television appearances.

For her contribution to the television industry, Dru was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

==Personal life==
She was the elder sister of Peter Marshall, an actor and singer best known as the original host of the American game show &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;. Dru married popular vocalist and actor Dick Haymes in 1941. The couple had three children. Divorced from Haymes in 1949, Dru married &quot;Red River&quot; and &quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot; co-star John Ireland less than a month later. The pair divorced in 1957. She had no children from her marriage to Ireland or two subsequent marriages.

She was a staunch Republican, supporting Barry Goldwater in the 1964 United States presidential election
and appeared at a 1968 GOP cocktail party fundraiser for Richard Nixon.
==Death==
Dru died in Los Angeles, California on September 10, 1996, aged 74, from a respiratory ailment that developed from lymphedema, a result of chemotherapy she had received over her lifetime, according to her brother. Her ashes were scattered into the Pacific Ocean.

The book chronicles the life of Elissa Wall, who was one of 24 children, and who was forced to marry her first cousin at the age of 14. Wall escaped the religion and later was the star witness at the trial of its prophet, Warren Jeffs. Jeffs was sentenced to ten years to life in a Utah prison for taking part in the arrangement of underage marriages. Caroline Leavitt said in The People, &quot;Her descriptions of the polygamous sect&#x27;s rigidity are shocking, but what&#x27;s most fascinating is the immensely likeable author&#x27;s struggle to reconcile her longing for happiness with her terror of its consequences.&quot;

Beyond Belief: My Secret Life Inside Scientology and My Harrowing Escape

Published in February 2013, &quot;Beyond Belief&quot; is the escape story by Jenna Miscavige Hill, niece of the current Scientology leader David Miscavige, detailing her experiences growing up in and leaving the church and building her life with her husband while trying to maintain contact with family members still within Scientology.

Imperfect Justice: Prosecuting Casey Anthony

Released in 2012 and co-authored with Jeff Ashton, this tells the story of the case and trial of Casey Anthony who was accused of the murder of her daughter Caylee. The book is told from the perspective of Ashton who was prosecutor and reveals behind-the-scenes information about the investigation and trial, with his opinions on the prosecution.

Mob Daughter: The Mafia, Sammy &quot;The Bull&quot; Gravano, and Me!

&quot;Mob Daughter&quot; was published by Summersdale in February 2012 and was co-authored by Pulitzer with Karen Gravano. It tells the story of Gravano growing up as the daughter of Sammy Gravano and marrying within the Mafia. Gravano has received criticism from families of the victims of her father for cashing in on the crimes, to which Gravano responded &quot;I understand their concerns, but the book isn&#x27;t about glorifying my father&#x27;s crimes, it&#x27;s about telling my story; what it was like to be Sammy Gravano&#x27;s daughter.&quot;

Banished: Surviving My Years in the Westboro Baptist Church

Banished was released in 2013 and was co-authored with Lauren Drain, a former member of the Westboro Baptist Church. It tells the story of Drain and her father Steve who became involved with the controversial church. After seven years Lauren Drain was banished by the church after an online relationship and the book gives her insights into the motivations of the church members in spreading hate and the various court cases. One critic wrote &quot;As the tale of one woman&#x27;s struggle, &quot;Banished&quot; is a quick, interesting read. But for those looking for a clearer understanding of why something like the Westboro Baptist Church exists and what motivates its members, the book often raises more questions than answers.&quot;

Conviction: The Untold Story of Putting Jodi Arias Behind Bars

Pulitzer&#x27;s most recent book is a ghostwritten work for Juan Martinez released in February 2016. It covers the story of the trial of Jodi Arias from the point of view of Martinez, the deputy county attorney for Maricopa County.

Joking about her genre of non-fiction writing she said, &quot;I&#x27;m now the official cult gal.&quot;

==Personal life==

<text>Memantine, sold under the brand name Namenda among others, is a medication used to slow the progression of moderate-to-severe Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. It is taken by mouth.
Common side effects include headache, constipation, sleepiness, and dizziness. Severe side effects may include blood clots, psychosis, and heart failure. It is believed to work by acting on NMDA receptors, working as a pore blocker of these ion channels.
Memantine was first discovered in 1963. It was approved for medical use in Germany in 1989, in the European Union in 2002, and in the United States in 2003. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 150th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3million prescriptions.

== Medical uses ==
===Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and dementia===
Memantine is used to treat moderate-to-severe Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, especially for people who are intolerant of or have a contraindication to AChE (acetylcholinesterase) inhibitors. One guideline recommends memantine or an AChE inhibitor be considered in people in the early-to-mid stage of dementia.

Memantine has been associated with a modest improvement; with small positive effects on cognition, mood, behavior, and the ability to perform daily activities in moderate-to-severe Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. There does not appear to be any benefit in mild disease.

Memantine when added to donepezil in those with moderate-to-severe dementia resulted in &quot;limited improvements&quot; in a 2017 review. The UK National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) issued guidance in 2018 recommending consideration of the combination of memantine with donepezil in those with moderate-to-severe dementia.

=== Radiation therapy ===
Memantine has been recommended for use by professional organization consensus to prevent neurocognitive decline after whole brain radiotherapy.

== Adverse effects ==
Memantine is, in general, well tolerated. Common adverse drug reactions (≥1% of people) include confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, headache, insomnia, agitation, and/or hallucinations. Less common adverse effects include vomiting, anxiety, hypertonia, cystitis, and increased libido.

Like many other NMDA receptor antagonists, memantine behaves as a dissociative anesthetic at supratherapeutic doses. Despite isolated reports, recreational use of memantine is rare due to the drug&#x27;s long duration and limited availability. Additionally, memantine seems to lack effects such as euphoria or hallucinations.

Memantine appears to be generally well tolerated by children with autism spectrum disorder.

== Pharmacology ==

=== Pharmacodynamics ===

==== Glutamatergic ====
A dysfunction of glutamatergic neurotransmission, manifested as neuronal excitotoxicity, is hypothesized to be involved in the etiology of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Targeting the glutamatergic system, specifically ionotropic glutamate NMDA receptors, offers a novel approach to treatment in view of the limited efficacy of existing drugs targeting the cholinergic system.

Memantine is a low-affinity voltage-dependent uncompetitive antagonist at glutamatergic NMDA receptors. By binding to the NMDA receptor with a higher affinity than Mg2+ ions, memantine is able to inhibit the prolonged influx of Ca2+ ions, particularly from extrasynaptic receptors, which forms the basis of neuronal excitotoxicity. The low affinity, uncompetitive nature, and rapid off-rate kinetics of memantine at the level of the NMDA receptor channel, however, preserves the function of the receptor at synapses, as it can still be activated by physiological release of glutamate following depolarization of the postsynaptic neuron. The interaction of memantine with NMDA receptors plays a major role in the symptomatic improvement that the drug produces in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. However, there is no evidence as yet that the ability of memantine to protect against extrasynaptic NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity has a disease-modifying effect in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, although this has been suggested in animal models.

==== Serotonergic ====
Memantine acts as a non-competitive antagonist of the serotonin 5-HT3 receptor, with a potency similar to that for the NMDA receptor. Many 5-HT3 receptor antagonists function as antiemetics, however the clinical significance of this anti-serotonergic activity of memantine in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease is unknown.

==== Cholinergic ====
Memantine acts as a non-competitive antagonist of different neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) at potencies possibly similar to the NMDA receptor and 5-HT3 receptor, but this is difficult to ascertain with accuracy because of the rapid desensitization of nAChR responses in these experiments. It can be noted that memantine is an antagonist at α7 nAChR, which may contribute to initial worsening of cognitive function during early memantine treatment. α7 nAChR upregulates quickly in response to antagonism, which could explain the cognitive-enhancing effects of chronic memantine treatment. It has been shown that the number of nicotinic receptors in the brain are reduced in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, even in the absence of a general decrease in the number of neurons, and nicotinic receptor agonists are viewed as interesting targets for anti-Alzheimer drugs.

==== Dopaminergic ====
Memantine was shown in a study to act as an agonist at the dopamine D2high receptor with equal or slightly higher affinity than to the NMDA receptors. However, the relevance of this action may be negligible, as studies have shown very low affinity for binding to D2 receptors in general.

==== Sigmaergic ====
Memantine acts as an agonist of the sigma σ1 receptor with low affinity (Ki = 2.6μM). The consequences of this activity are unclear (as the role of sigma receptors in general is currently not very well understood). Due to this low affinity, therapeutic concentrations of memantine are most likely too low to have any sigmaergic effect as a typical therapeutic dose is 20 mg. However, excessive doses of memantine taken for recreational purposes many times greater than prescribed doses may indeed activate this receptor.

==== Other actions ====
Memantine does not appear to inhibit or induce several cytochrome P450 enzymes including CYP3A4/5, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP2C9. It also does not inhibit CYP2A6 or CYP2E1. However, it might have a small effect on CYP2B6.

=== Pharmacokinetics ===

==== Absorption ====
The oral bioavailability of memantine is 100%. Time to peak levels of memantine is 3 to 7hours. Food has no influence on the rate of absorption. Memantine exposure is linear over a dose range of 10 to 40mg. Peak levels after a single 20mg dose were found to be 24 to 29μg/L (0.13–0.16μmol/L or μM). Steady-state levels of memantine with 20mg/day are in the range of 0.5 to 1.0μM.

==== Distribution ====
Memantine has a relatively high volume of distribution (Vd) of 9 to 11L/kg. It easily crosses biological membranes, is widely distributed throughout the body, and crosses the blood–brain barrier into the central nervous system. The drug is transported across the blood–brain barrier by the organic cation transporter novel 1 (OCTN1). The plasma protein binding of memantine is 45% and is described as very low and not clinically significant. Because of its low plasma protein binding, it is unlikely to interact with other highly protein-bound drugs such as warfarin or digoxin.

==== Metabolism ====
Memantine does not undergo extensive metabolism. It is negligibly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzymes. As a result, it has a decreased potential for drug interactions. Metabolites of memantine include memantine glucuronide, 6-hydroxymemantine, and 1-nitrosomemantine, all of which show minimal activity as NMDA receptor antagonists.

==== Elimination ====
Memantine is eliminated primarily in urine, with 57 to 82% excreted in urine unchanged. Its elimination half-life is 60 to 80hours. The renal clearance of memantine is dependent on urinary pH. More alkaline urine slows the elimination of memantine, whereas more acidic urine accelerates its elimination.

== Chemistry ==
Memantine, also known as 3,5-dimethyl-1-aminoadamantane (DMAA), is an adamantane derivative and is closely structurally related to amantadine (1-aminoadamantane) and other adamantane derivatives.

The synthesis of memantine has been described.

== History ==
Memantine was first synthesized, patented, and described by Eli Lilly and Company in 1963 as an anti-diabetic agent, but it was ineffective at lowering blood sugar. By 1972, it was discovered to have central nervous system (CNS) activity, and was developed by Merz for treatment of neurological diseases, such as Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Memantine was first studied in the treatment of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in 1986. The drug was first marketed for dementia in 1989 in Germany under the name Axura.

It was not discovered to act as an NMDA receptor antagonist until 1989, after clinical trials had initiated. Prior to this, it was theorized to directly and/or indirectly modulate the dopaminergic, noradrenergic, and serotonergic systems. However, these actions were later realized to occur at 100-fold higher concentrations than those achieved therapeutically and hence are unlikely to be involved in its effects.

In the United States, some CNS activities were discovered at Children&#x27;s Hospital of Boston in 1990, and Children&#x27;s licensed patents covering uses of memantine outside the field of ophthalmology to Neurobiological Technologies (NTI) in 1995. In 1998, NTI amended its agreement with Children&#x27;s to allow Merz to take over development.

In 2000, Merz partnered with Forest to develop the drug for Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in the United States under the brand name Namenda. In 2000, Merz partnered with Suntory for the Japanese market and with Lundbeck for other markets including Europe; the drug was originally marketed by Lundbeck under the name Ebixa. Memantine was approved in the European Union in 2002 and in the United States in 2003.

Sales of the drug reached $1.8 billion for 2014. The cost of Namenda was $269 to $489 a month in 2012.

In February 2014, as the July 2015 patent expiration for memantine neared, Actavis, which had acquired Forest, announced that it was launching an extended release (XR) form of memantine that could be taken once a day instead of twice a day as needed with the then-current &quot;immediate release&quot; (IR) version, and that it intended to stop selling the IR version in August 2014 and withdraw the marketing authorization. This is a tactic to thwart generic competition called product hopping. However the supply of the XR version ran short, so Actavis extended the deadline until the fall. In September 2014 the attorney general of New York, Eric Schneiderman, filed a lawsuit to compel Actavis to keep selling the IR version on the basis of antitrust law.

In December 2014, a judge granted New York State its request and issued an injunction, preventing Actavis from withdrawing the IR version until generic versions could launch. Actavis appealed and in May a panel of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the injunction, and in June Actavis asked that its case be heard by the full Second Circuit panel. In August 2015, Actavis&#x27; request was denied.

== Society and culture ==

=== Recreational use ===
Recreational use of memantine at supratherapeutic doses has been reported. It is a weak NMDA receptor antagonist and is reported to produce dissociative and phencyclidine (PCP)-like effects in animals and humans at sufficiently high doses. Even therapeutic doses have been found to produce mild dissociative-like effects in clinical studies. In any case, the very long duration of action of memantine (&gt;40hours) has likely limited its misuse potential. Recreational use of the related drug amantadine has similarly been reported.

A study examining self-reported use of memantine on the social network Reddit showed that the drug was used both recreationally and as a nootropic, but also that it was misused in various illnesses as self-medication without strong scientific basis.

===Brand names===
As of August 2017, memantine is marketed under many brand names worldwide including Abixa, Adaxor, Admed, Akatinol, Alceba, Alios, Almenta, Alois, Alzant, Alzer, Alzia, Alzinex, Alzixa, Alzmenda, Alzmex, Axura, Biomentin, Carrier, Cogito, Cognomem, Conexine, Cordure, Dantex, Demantin, Demax, Dementa, Dementexa, Ebitex, Ebixa, Emantin, Emaxin, Esmirtal, Eutebrol, Evy, Ezemantis, Fentina, Korint, Lemix, Lindex, Lindex, Lucidex, Manotin, Mantine, Mantomed, Marbodin, Mardewel, Marixino, Maruxa, Maxiram, Melanda, Memabix, Memamed, Memando, Memantin, Memantina, Memantine, Mémantine, Memantinol, Memantyn, Memanvitae, Memanxa, Memanzaks, Memary, Memax, Memexa, Memigmin, Memikare, Memogen, Memolan, Memorel, Memorix, Memotec, Memox, Memxa, Mentikline, Mentium, Mentixa, Merandex, Merital, Mexia, Mimetix, Mirvedol, Modualz, Morysa, Namenda, Nemdatine, Nemdatine, Nemedan, Neumantine, Neuro-K, Neuroplus, Noojerone, Polmatine, Prilben, Pronervon, Ravemantine, Talentum, Timantila, Tingreks, Tonibral, Tormoro, Valcoxia, Vilimen, Vivimex, Witgen, Xapimant, Ymana, Zalatine, Zemertinex, Zenmem, Zenmen, and Zimerz.

It is marketed in some countries as a combination drug with donepezil (memantine/donepezil) under the brand names Namzaric, Neuroplus Dual, and Tonibral MD.

== Research ==
=== Psychiatric disorders ===
Memantine has been studied and used off-label in the treatment of a variety of psychiatric disorders. These include depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), substance misuse, pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs), and binge eating disorder (BED). A 2008 systematic review concluded that although it was promising for such uses, memantine could not be recommended for such indications due to inadequate data.

Memantine does not appear to be effective in the treatment of unipolar major depression or bipolar depression on the basis of systematic reviews and meta-analyses, including a 2021 Cochrane review. However, a 2022 systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that memantine was significantly effective in the treatment of depressive symptoms in various psychiatric disorders, although with a very small effect size (Hedges&#x27; g = -0.17).

There are likewise limited data to support memantine in the treatment of schizophrenia based on systematic reviews and meta-analyses. However, a 2019 systematic review and meta-analysis reported that memantine was effective in the treatment of the negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia with medium to large effect sizes.

=== Parkinson&#x27;s disease ===
Memantine has been studied in the treatment of Parkinson&#x27;s disease since the early 1970s. Whereas the related drug amantadine is approved for the treatment of Parkinson&#x27;s disease and has been since the early 1970s, memantine is not approved for the treatment of Parkinson&#x27;s disease as of 2024. However, it has been said that memantine, along with amantadine, has been widely used as an antiparkinsonian agent since at least 1994.

Although amantadine and memantine have fairly similar pharmacology, it has been said that memantine does not share the antidyskinetic effects of amantadine. However, findings are conflicting, and some data suggest that memantine may also have antidyskinetic effects. Similarly to amantadine and dopamine receptor agonists, memantine reverses haloperidol-induced catalepsy and monoamine depletion-induced sedation in animals. Memantine has been found to reduce bradykinesia and resting tremor in people with Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Memantine and amantadine are said to have moderate anti-akinetic effects in the treatment of Parkinson&#x27;s disease. The doses of memantine used for Parkinson&#x27;s disease are about 5- to 10-fold lower than those of amantadine, which has been attributed to greater potency of memantine.

As of 2022, a phase 3 clinical trial is studying the potential of memantine as disease-modifying treatment for Parkinson&#x27;s disease that might slow progression of the disease. It is specifically theorized to act by inhibiting cell-to-cell transmission of α-synuclein.

Besides Parkinson&#x27;s disease, memantine has been studied in the treatment of Parkinson&#x27;s disease dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).

=== Apathy ===
Apathy is a disorder of diminished motivation characterized by diminished interest and activity. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses published from 2016 to 2022 have found that memantine is not effective in the treatment of apathy in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and other dementias. However, another 2022 review reported that it was effective.

=== Long COVID ===
Memantine, along with amantadine, is being studied and used off-label in the treatment long COVID.

=== Catatonia ===
Memantine, along with amantadine, has been reported to be effective in the treatment of catatonia in case reports and case series.

=== Autism ===
Effects in autism are unclear.

<text>The United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) was a team under the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency of the Department of Homeland Security. 

On February 24, 2023, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) retired US-CERT and ICS-CERT, integrating CISA’s operational content into a new CISA.gov website that better unifies CISA&#x27;s mission. CISA continues to be responsible for coordinating cybersecurity programs within the U.S. government to protect against malicious cyber activity, including activity related to industrial control systems. In keeping with this responsibility, CISA continues responding to incidents, providing technical assistance, and disseminating timely notifications of cyber threats and vulnerabilities.

US-CERT was a branch of the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center of the Office of Cybersecurity and Communications. US-CERT had responsible for analyzing and reducing cyber threats, vulnerabilities, disseminating cyber threat warning information, and coordinating incident response activities.

The division brought advanced network and digital media analysis expertise to bear on malicious activity targeting the networks within the United States and abroad.

==Background==
The concept of a national Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) for the United States was proposed by Marcus Sachs (Auburn University) when he was a staff member for the U.S. National Security Council in 2002 to be a peer organization with other national CERTs such as AusCERT and CERT-UK, and to be located in the then forthcoming Department of Homeland Security (DHS). At the time the United States did not have a national CERT.

Amit Yoran (Tenable, Inc., CEO), DHS&#x27;s first Director of the National Cyber Security Division, launched the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) in September 2003 to protect the Internet infrastructure of the United States by coordinating defense against and responding to cyber-attacks. The first Director of the US-CERT was Jerry Dixon (CrowdStrike, CISO); with the team initially staffed with cybersecurity experts that included Mike Witt (NASA, CISO), Brent Wrisley (Punch Cyber, CEO), Mike Geide (Punch Cyber, CTO), Lee Rock (Microsoft, SSIRP Crisis Lead), Chris Sutton (Export-Import Bank of the United States, CISO &amp; CPO), Jay Brown (USG, Senior Exec Cyber Operations), Mark Henderson (IRS, Online Cyber Fraud), Josh Goldfarb (Security Consultant), Mike Jacobs (Treasury, Director/Chief of Operations), Rafael Nunez (DHS/CISA), Ron Dow (General Dynamics, Senior Program Mgr), Sean McAllister (Network Defense Protection, Founder), Kevin Winter (Deloitte, CISO-Americas), Todd Helfrich (Attivo, VP), Monica Maher (Goldman Sachs, VP Cyber Threat Intelligence), Reggie McKinney (VA) and several other cybersecurity experts. In January 2007, Mike Witt was selected as the US-CERT Director, who was then followed by Mischel Kwon (Mischel Kwon and Associates) in June 2008. When Mischel Kwon departed in 2009, a major reorganization occurred which created the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC).

US-CERT was the 24-hour operational arm of the NCCIC which accepts, triages, and collaboratively responds to incidents, provides technical assistance to information system operators, and disseminates timely notifications regarding current and potential security threats, exploits, and vulnerabilities to the public via its National Cyber Awareness System (NCAS).

US-CERT operated side-by-side with the Industrial Control Systems Computer Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) which deals with security related to industrial control systems. Both entities operated together within NCCIC to provide a single source of support to critical infrastructure stakeholders.

==Capabilities==
There were five operational aspects which enabled US-CERT to meet its objectives of improving the nation’s cybersecurity posture, coordinate cyber information sharing, and proactively manage cyber risks while protecting the constitutional rights of Americans.

===Threat Analysis and information sharing===
This feature is involved with reviewing, researching, vetting and documenting all Computer Network Defense (CND) attributes which are available to US-CERT, both classified and unclassified.

It helps promote improved mitigation resources of federal departments and agencies across the Einstein network by requesting deployment of countermeasures in response to credible cyber threats.

This feature conducts technical analysis on data provided from partners, constituents, and monitoring systems to understand the nature of attacks, threats, and vulnerabilities, as well as develop tips, indicators, warnings, and actionable information to further US-CERT’s CND mission.

===Digital analytics===
This feature conducts digital forensic examinations and malware artifact analysis (reverse engineering) to determine attack vectors and mitigation techniques, identifies possible threats based on analysis of malicious code and digital media, and provides indicators to mitigate and prevent future intrusions.

===Operations===
This feature informs the CND community on potential threats which allows for the hardening of cyber defenses, as well as, develops near real-time/rapid response community products (e.g., reports, white papers).

When a critical event occurs, or has been detected, Operations will create a tailored product describing the event and the recommended course of action or mitigation techniques, if applicable, to ensure constituents are made aware and can protect their organization appropriately.

===Communications===
This feature supports NCCIC information sharing, development, and web presence. It is responsible for establishing and maintaining assured communications, developing and disseminating information, products, and supporting the development and maintenance of collaboration tools.

===International===
This feature partners with foreign governments and entities to enhance the global cybersecurity defense posture. It supports bilateral engagements, such as CERT-to-CERT information sharing/trust building activities, improvements related to global collaboration, and agreements on data sharing standards.

== Criticism ==
A January 2015 report by Senator Tom Coburn, ranking member of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, expressed concern that &quot;[US-CERT] does not always provide information nearly as quickly as alternative private sector threat analysis companies&quot;.

<text>HMS &quot;Cavalier&quot; is a retired destroyer of the Royal Navy. She was laid down by J. Samuel White and Company at East Cowes on 28 March 1943, launched on 7 April 1944, and commissioned on 22 November 1944. She served in World War II and in various commissions in the Far East until she was decommissioned in 1972. After decommissioning she was preserved as a museum ship and currently resides at Chatham Historic Dockyard.

==Construction==
&quot;Cavalier&quot; was one of 96 War Emergency Programme destroyers ordered between 1940 and 1942. She was one of the first ships to be built with the forward and aft portions of her hull welded, with the midsection riveted to ensure strength. The new process gave the ship additional speed. In 1970 a 64-mile race was arranged between &quot;Cavalier&quot; and the frigate , which had the same hull form and machinery. &quot;Cavalier&quot; beat &quot;Rapid&quot; by after &quot;Rapid&quot; lifted a safety valve, reaching an average speed of .

==Service history==
After commissioning, she joined the 6th Destroyer Flotilla, part of the Home Fleet, and took part in a number of operations off Norway. Most notably in February 1945 she was despatched with the destroyers and to reinforce a convoy from the Kola Inlet in Russia, which had suffered attacks from enemy aircraft and U-boats, and had subsequently been scattered by a violent storm. She and the other escorts reformed the convoy, and returned to Britain with the loss of only three of the 34 ships. This action earned &quot;Cavalier&quot; a battle honour.

Later in 1945, &quot;Cavalier&quot; was despatched to the Far East, where she provided naval gunfire support during the Battle of Surabaya. In February 1946, she went to Bombay to help quell the Royal Indian Navy Mutiny. After some time in the British Pacific Fleet she was paid off in May 1946 and was placed in reserve at Portsmouth.

From 1955 to 1957, &quot;Cavalier&quot; was modernised at Thornycroft&#x27;s Woolston, Southampton shipyard, removing some of her torpedo tubes and a 4.5-inch gun in favour of two Squid anti-submarine mortars. She recommissioned on 16 June 1957, replacing in the 8th Destroyer Squadron in Singapore. From March to April 1958, &quot;Cavalier&quot; took part in the Operation Grapple, the British nuclear weapon tests at Malden Island and Kiritimati. In August 1959, &quot;Cavalier&quot; was ordered to the important RAF base at Gan Island in the Maldives in response to civil unrest, remaining there until relieved by sister ship on 29 August. In December 1962, she transported 180 troops from Singapore to Brunei to help suppress a rebellion that became part of the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation. After disembarking the troops she remained in Brunei as a communications centre for several days until other Royal Navy ships arrived to relieve her. On 21 May 1964, &quot;Cavalier&quot; was being towed by the tug RFA &quot;Reward&quot; to Gibraltar for refit when she was in collision with the Liberian tanker &quot;Burgan&quot;, about south-west of Brighton. &quot;Cavalier&quot;″s bows were badly damaged, while one of &quot;Burgan&quot;″s crew suffered head injuries and had to be airlifted to hospital. &quot;Cavalier&quot; underwent temporary repairs at Portsmouth before being fitted with a new bow at Devonport. She finally underwent the planned refit at Gibraltar from August 1964 to April 1966.

On 6 July 1971, &quot;Cavalier&quot; participated in a race against a similar ship, . &quot;Cavalier&quot; narrowly won the race after a safety valve blew on &quot;Rapid&quot;. &quot;Cavalier&quot; was presented with the &#x27;Cock o&#x27; the Fleet&#x27; award. The award can be seen on the ship&#x27;s bridge to this day.

&quot;Cavalier&quot; was decommissioned in 1972 and is the last surviving British destroyer of World War 2 still in the UK.

==Fate==
After decommissioning at Chatham Dockyard, she was laid up in Portsmouth. As a unique survivor, after a five-year campaign led by Lord Louis Mountbatten, the ship was purchased by the Cavalier Trust for £65,000 and handed over on Trafalgar Day 1977 in Portsmouth. By selling the ship to the trust, the UK government and the Royal Navy severed all formal connection and responsibility for the ship. A special warrant was issued that allows her to retain the prefix &quot;HMS&quot; (His Majesty&#x27;s Ship) and fly the White Ensign, a privilege normally only enjoyed by commissioned ships of the Royal Navy. A similar privilege is enjoyed by another museum ship, the cruiser .

Moved to Southampton, &quot;Cavalier&quot; opened as a museum and memorial ship in August 1982. This was not commercially successful, and in October 1983 the ship was moved to Brighton, where she formed the centrepiece of a newly built yacht marina.
In 1987, the ship was brought to the River Tyne to form the main attraction of a national shipbuilding exhibition centre planned by South Tyneside Metropolitan Borough Council in the former shipyard of Hawthorn Leslie and Company, builders of many similar destroyers. The plans for the museum came to nothing, and the borough council, faced with annual maintenance costs of £30,000 and a hardening of public opinion against unnecessary expenditure, resolved to sell the ship and wind up the venture in 1996. The ship sat in a dry dock (owing to a previous list) in a rusting condition, awaiting a buyer or scrapping in situ.

After the reforming of the Cavalier Trust, and a debate in Parliament, in 1998 &quot;Cavalier&quot; was bought by Chatham Historic Dockyard for display as a museum ship. Arriving on 23 May 1998, &quot;Cavalier&quot; now resides in No. 2 dry-dock.

On 14 November 2007, &quot;Cavalier&quot; was officially designated as a war memorial to the 142 Royal Navy destroyers sunk during World War II and the 11,000 men killed on those ships. The unveiling of a bronze monument created by the artist Kenneth Potts was conducted by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. The monument is adjacent to the ship at the Historic Dockyard in Chatham, Kent.

In the summer of 2009 the Chatham Historic Dockyard Trust made available accommodation on board the ship for youth groups who wish to stay on board and experience life on board a Royal Naval destroyer.

In September 2010, &quot;Cavalier&quot; fired a full broadside from the ship. This was due to the work of the heritage naval gun crew who restored all three 4.5-in guns back to working condition in conjunction with the Chatham Historic Dockyard Trust.

In April 2014 &quot;Cavalier&quot; was added to Google Maps Business View (formerly Google Business Photos) in celebration of the 70th anniversary of her launch. The tour, which includes &quot;Cavalier&quot;″s engine and gear room, was enhanced with interactive audio hotspots to enable visitors with accessibility issues to explore the ship.

<doc id="1289459" wikidata="Q697797" url="?curid=1289459" title="Order of the Golden Kite">
<text>The  was an order of the Empire of Japan, established on 12 February 1890 by Emperor Meiji &quot;in commemoration of Jimmu Tennō, the Romulus of Japan&quot;. It was abolished 1947 by the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP) during the occupation of Japan, after World War II.

==Background==

The Order of the Golden Kite was an exclusively military award, conferred for bravery, leadership or command in battle. It ranked just below the Order of the Chrysanthemum in precedence and was the military equivalent of the Order of the Paulownia Flowers; therefore, it could be considered analogous to the military division of the Order of the Bath in the United Kingdom. The first three classes were roughly equivalent to the three divisions of the Order of the Bath, the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh classes were analogous to the DSO, MC/DSC, DCM/CGM and DSM/MM, respectively .

The order consisted of seven classes. Enlisted rank soldiers were eligible for the 7th–5th classes, non-commissioned officers were eligible for the 6th–4th classes, junior officers for the 5th–3rd classes, field grade officers for the 4th–2nd classes and general officers for the 3rd-1st classes.

A total of 1,067,492 Order of the Golden Kite awards were made over the history of the order, most of them in the two lower 6th and 7th classes. Only 41 of the 1st class and 201 of the 2nd class were awarded.

By conflict:
*First Sino-Japanese War: about 2000
*Russo-Japanese War: about 109,600
*World War I: about 3000
*Manchurian Incident: about 9000
*Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1941): about 190,000
*Pacific War: about 630,000

The award came with an annual monetary stipend, fixed in 1916. This was awarded for the lifetime of the recipient, and following his death, it would be awarded to the recipient&#x27;s family for one year after. If the recipient died within 5 years of receiving the honor, the stipend would be awarded to the family until the end of the 5-year period. In 1939, the stipends stood as follows:

*1st Class – 1500 yen
*2nd Class – 1000 yen
*3rd Class – 700 yen
*4th Class – 500 yen
*5th Class – 350 yen
*6th Class – 250 yen
*7th Class – 150 yen

Since the monthly pay for a private in the Imperial Japanese Army at the time was 8 yen, 80 sen, this amounted to a very substantial reward. The monetary stipend was abolished in 1940.

The honor was sometimes awarded individually, sometimes awarded &quot;en masse&quot;. In mid-October 1942, posthumous awards were announced following ceremonies at the Yasukuni Shrine. Posthumous honorees included 995 who were lost in combat in the far-flung Pacific War battles and 3,031 who were lost fighting in China. In this instance, Tokyo&#x27;s official radio broadcast of the list of posthumous recipients of the Order of the Golden Kite was monitored by Allied forces in Asia. The number of honorees was not considered remarkable at the time, but the number of posthumous awards was considered noteworthy by Allied analysts. Specific high ranking naval and army officers were named; and in addition, special mention was given to 55 naval aviators and 9 &quot;members of a special attack flotilla&quot;—presumably miniature submarines taking part in the attack on Pearl Harbor.

The order of the Golden Kite was officially abolished by the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers of Occupied Japan in 1947.

==Symbolism==
The badge depicts a golden kite, a messenger of the &quot;kami&quot; as described in the ancient Japanese chronicle &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, which helped Emperor Jimmu defeat his enemies in battle. The golden kite stands on an eight-pointed star with 32 rays enameled in red. Below the kite are two crossed ancient shields, enameled blue, with two crossed spears with silver heads enameled yellow with red banners each bearing a mitsudomoe. On one side is a chokutō (enameled green with white trappings). The reverse side is plain.

The badge was a gilt starburst for the 1st-5th classes and different design in gilt for the 6th class and in silver for the 7th class. It was suspended on a ribbon in blue-green with a white stripe near the edges, worn as a sash on the left shoulder by the 1st class, as a necklet by the 2nd and 3rd classes, on the left chest by the 4th and 5th classes. The badges for 6th and 7th classes were non-enameled.

The &quot;star&quot; of the 1st and 2nd classes was similar to the badge as described above, but with both red and yellow enameled rays. It was worn on the left chest by the 1st class, on the right chest by the 2nd class.

A three time first-team All-Pro and five time selection for the Pro Bowl, Abraham is often regarded as one of the greatest defensive ends of the 2000s, and universally cited as one of the greatest defensive linemen in the history of the New York Jets.

==Early life==
Abraham was born in Timmonsville, South Carolina. In his high school years at Lamar High School in Lamar, South Carolina, he was primarily an athlete in the track program, where he set the current South Carolina record for the 200-meter dash, at 22.6 seconds, and ran the 100 meters in 11.26 seconds. He also competed in the throwing events, recording top-throws of 13.61 meters in the shot put and 43.05 meters in the discus. He played organized football for the first time as a senior in high school.

==College career==
While Abraham played just one season of high school football, he was nonetheless recruited to play for coach Brad Scott&#x27;s South Carolina Gamecocks football team at the University of South Carolina. While he was a Gamecock, he amassed 23.5 quarterback sacks, ranking second on South Carolina&#x27;s career list, and was a first-team All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) selection.

==Professional career==

===New York Jets===
Drafted in the first round (13th overall, via pick acquired from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in exchange for Keyshawn Johnson) of the 2000 NFL draft, he made an immediate impact for the New York Jets; in his rookie season, he recorded 12 tackles and 4.5 sacks in only six games before being injured. In 2001, he recorded 58 tackles and 13 sacks, and was named to the AFC Pro Bowl. In 2002, he recorded 48 tackles, with 10 sacks, and was again named to the Pro Bowl. In 2003, he only recorded 37 tackles and six sacks, due to being injured mid-season.

Abraham tied a franchise record set by Joe Klecko and Mark Gastineau with four sacks in a game on November 4, 2001, against the New Orleans Saints.

Abraham was designated Franchise Player by the Jets on February 21, 2006.

===Atlanta Falcons===
Abraham was traded to the Atlanta Falcons in exchange for Atlanta&#x27;s 2006 NFL draft first round pick (No. 29), which was acquired from Denver Broncos.

In 2008, he had a career high 16.5 sacks through the entire season and ranked third in the league that year. 

On December 12, 2010, Abraham recorded two sacks against the Carolina Panthers. The two sacks gave him 100.5 for his career, making him only the 25th player in NFL history to eclipse 100. On December 27, on Monday Night Football against the New Orleans Saints, Abraham recorded his first career interception after deflecting and catching a Drew Brees pass attempt.

In December 2010, Abraham was selected to his fourth Pro Bowl. He was ranked 69th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2011.

On June 21, 2012, Abraham signed a 3-year $16.72 million contract to remain in Atlanta.

On March 1, 2013, Abraham was released by the Atlanta Falcons.

===Arizona Cardinals===
Abraham signed with the Arizona Cardinals on July 25, 2013. In his first season in Arizona, he recorded 11.5 sacks, which ranked seventh in the NFL, and 4 forced fumbles. After a productive first season with the Cardinals, Abraham left Arizona&#x27;s week one Monday Night Football game on September 10, 2014, after a concussion. After the game, he spoke with Bruce Arians for several hours discussing if he should retire. On September 19, 2014, Abraham&#x27;s 2014 season prematurely ended as the Cardinals placed him on injured reserve, effectively ending his career.

<text>Eddard &quot;Ned&quot; Stark, known as The Quiet Wolf, is a fictional character in the 1996 fantasy novel &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; by George R. R. Martin and &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, HBO&#x27;s adaptation of Martin&#x27;s &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series. In the storyline, Ned is the lord of Winterfell, an ancient fortress in the North of the fictional continent of Westeros. Though the character is established as the main character in the novel and the first season of the TV adaptation, a plot twist involving Ned near the end of the novel and the end of the first season shocked both readers of the book and viewers of the TV series.

Ned is portrayed by veteran English actor Sean Bean in the first season of &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, as a child by Sebastian Croft in the sixth season, and as a young adult by Robert Aramayo in the sixth and seventh seasons. Bean was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Actor on Television and a Scream Award for Best Fantasy Actor for the role. He and the rest of the cast were nominated for Screen Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series in 2011.

== Character ==
=== Description ===
In &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; (1996), Ned Stark is introduced as the virtuous and honorable patriarch of House Stark of Winterfell, the lord paramount and warden family of the North. He is happily married to Lady Catelyn Tully and is father to five trueborn children Robb, Sansa, Arya, Bran, Rickon and a bastard son Jon Snow, as well as guardian to a ward boy Theon Greyjoy. He is a lifelong friend of King Robert Baratheon, the ruling monarch of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, who personally visits Winterfell to invite and persuade Ned to become the new Hand of the King at the beginning of the novel.

As the moral compass of the story, Ned is content to remain far from courtly intrigues and is unwavering in his view of loyalty and honor. His family name, Stark, is a word play that both emphasizes the resilience of his noble family and serves as an indication of his personal resistance to moral compromise. Still, his boundaries are increasingly tested over the course of the novel. Finding himself a key player in the escalating political intrigue of King&#x27;s Landing, Ned struggles as his own sense of honor draws him into corrupt goings-on at court. As the story progresses, he begins to see the importance of moral and practical compromises to achieve a just end. He is ultimately forced to choose between his family&#x27;s safety and doing what is right.

Sean Bean said of the character, &quot;He&#x27;s a good man trying to do his best in the middle of this corruption, he&#x27;s a fish out of water, he&#x27;s used to being up north in Winterfell where people are pretty straight and pragmatic, and he comes down to a place where people are playing games and backstabbing... he&#x27;s a principled man who tries to hold things together. This is a journey that he makes where ultimately his loyalty causes his downfall.&quot;

=== Development and overview ===
&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; noted in 1996 that, despite the honest Ned Stark&#x27;s intervention in court politics, &quot;no amount of heroism or good intentions can keep the realm under control.&quot; From his very first introduction, Ned is portrayed as a noble hero and set up to be the heart of the story. With fifteen chapters devoted to his point of view, more than any other single character in the novel, he is presented as a primary character in the series, and the main storyline of &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;, the drama in King&#x27;s Landing, is told entirely from his perspective. In the &quot;London Review of Books&quot;, John Lanchester writes that everything about Ned is designed to gain audience sympathy, from his strong sense of honor and moral compass to his compassion towards his wife and children. Readers are led to believe that Ned will be the main character of the series, but ultimately he is, from a literary perspective, a classic decoy protagonist. After struggling to keep himself and the kingdom on a moral path for the entire novel, the only option that remains to save his family is to put aside his honor; he does so, but is betrayed anyway. Calling Ned&#x27;s execution &quot;shocking&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted in 2011 that the novel was &quot;famous for dispatching a thoroughly admirable major character with whom readers have been identifying for most of the book&quot;. In an interview for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, author George R. R. Martin commented on this misdirection:

David Benioff, executive producer and writer of the HBO adaptation, told &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; that when he read the novel:

In a review of the &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; TV episode &quot;Baelor&quot;, James Poniewozik wrote in &quot;Time&quot; that &quot;the execution of Eddard Stark is crucial to the story and its themes and everything that follows, but it&#x27;s also a meta-message to the reader: don&#x27;t take anything for granted here&quot;. James Hibberd of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; stated that tricking the audience into thinking Ned is the hero and then killing him makes the series&#x27; story better. Writing that &quot;the big twist here isn&#x27;t that Ned Stark dies, but who the true protagonists of &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; are&quot;, Hibberd pointed out that the series&#x27; focus proves to be the &quot;new generation&quot; of leaders, in particular the Stark children but also Daenerys and even Tyrion. He noted:

== Storylines ==
=== Background ===
As established in &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;, Eddard &quot;Ned&quot; Stark is the second son of Rickard Stark, the Lord of Winterfell. Years before the events of the novel, the quiet and shy young Ned is fostered in the Vale by Lord Jon Arryn. During this time Ned becomes close friends with Robert Baratheon, heir to the Stormlands and another ward of Arryn&#x27;s. Robert is eventually betrothed to Ned&#x27;s sister Lyanna, but before he can marry her, Crown Prince Rhaegar Targaryen absconds with Lyanna. Ned&#x27;s father and older brother Brandon go to King Aerys II Targaryen and demand that Lyanna be freed, only to be both sadistically executed by the so-called &quot;Mad King&quot;. When King Aerys demands the killing of both Ned and Robert, Lord Arryn rises in revolt along with House Baratheon and Stark, and secures the support of House Tully with Ned marrying Brandon&#x27;s betrothed Catelyn Tully. Ned leaves for war the very next morning after his consummation with Catelyn.

At the decisive Battle of the Trident, the rebels scatter the Targaryen army, with Robert killing Prince Rhaegar in single combat but being injured in the duel, so Ned takes over command and marches on the capital King&#x27;s Landing. Upon arrival, Ned finds that House Lannister — who has previously posed neutrality — has already sacked the city and murdered King Aerys and the entire Targaryen royal family. Disgusted by the dishonorable massacre and Robert&#x27;s tolerance of the Lannister treachery, Ned departs in anger to lift the siege of the Baratheon stronghold Storm&#x27;s End, and later attempts to rescue Lyanna, only to find her dying in &quot;a bed of blood&quot;; her last words are &quot;Promise me, Ned&quot;. Ned returns to Winterfell with an infant boy Jon Snow, whom he claims to be his own bastard son but refuses to elaborate on the boy&#x27;s maternal parentage. Meanwhile, Catelyn has delivered Ned&#x27;s son and heir, Robb, conceived on their wedding night, and Ned continues raising Jon along with his subsequent children.

Six years after the end of Robert&#x27;s Rebellion, Balon Greyjoy, the Lord of the Iron Islands, declares independence from the Iron Throne. Ned aids King Robert in putting down the Greyjoy Rebellion. Balon surrenders, and his sole surviving heir, Theon, is taken back to Winterfell as Stark&#x27;s ward and a &quot;de facto&quot; political hostage, although the Starks have treated Theon kindly like a family member. Ned rules the North with justice and praise for nine more years before the events of the novel.

=== &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; ===
At the beginning of &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;, Ned&#x27;s convoy encounter an orphaned litter of direwolf pups and he decides to allow his children to adopt them, although his men suspect the appearance of direwolves to be a bad omen of a long, harsh winter. Later, Catelyn informs Ned that his mentor Jon Arryn, who had been serving as the Hand of the King, had died suddenly of illness, and that King Robert intends to offer Ned the position as Hand of the King. Content to be far from court intrigue, Ned is reluctant to accept the offer until he receives a letter from Arryn&#x27;s widow, who believes that her husband had been poisoned by the Lannisters. Ned subsequently agrees to the appointment to protect Robert, and travels south to King&#x27;s Landing with his daughters Sansa and Arya. Catelyn later comes to the capital in secret, under the protection of her childhood friend Petyr &quot;Littlefinger&quot; Baelish, to tell Ned of an assassination attempt on their crippled young son Bran. Ned&#x27;s longstanding mistrust of the Lannisters is further fueled by Littlefinger&#x27;s confirmation that the dagger used by the would-be assassin once belonged to Tyrion Lannister. Increasingly disgusted by the political intrigues at court, Ned finally resigns his position when Robert insists on having Aerys&#x27; only surviving child, the young Daenerys Targaryen, assassinated in exile. Meanwhile, Catelyn has impulsively taken Tyrion prisoner at the Eyrie, and in retaliation Jaime Lannister attacks and seriously injures Ned in the street before he and his daughters can depart King&#x27;s Landing. Visiting a wounded Ned, Robert reappoints him as Hand.

Ned eventually concludes that all of Robert&#x27;s heirs with his wife Cersei Lannister are illegitimate products of incest with her twin brother Jaime. Further, Ned suspects that Arryn had been poisoned to conceal the truth, as both Arryn and Robert&#x27;s brother Stannis have been searching for Robert&#x27;s other bastard children. In private, Ned confronts Cersei, who confesses to infidelity, and offers her the chance to safely exile with her children. Before Ned can tell the king, Robert is fatally wounded while boar hunting and names Ned Protector of the Realm, to function as regent until his &quot;son&quot; Joffrey comes of age. Ned alters Robert&#x27;s will, replacing Joffrey&#x27;s name with &quot;my rightful heir&quot; to make the succession ambiguous. With the palace in chaos, Ned rebuffs multiple offers to increase his own power, instead opting to support Stannis as king. Cersei, however, outmaneuvers Ned due to informing by Sansa (who is still infatuated with her betrothal to Prince Joffrey), and the duplicitous Littlefinger has also betrayed Ned and ordered the City Watch to arrest him instead of Cersei. With all of his entourage and guards slaughtered, Ned is charged with treason. A secret deal is struck through the spymaster Varys that Ned will be spared and sent to the penal Night&#x27;s Watch if he declares Joffrey the rightful king. Fearing for his daughters Sansa (who is now a hostage) and Arya (who has escaped alone and is missing), Ned makes a public confession of his &quot;treason&quot;, but the sadistic Joffrey has Ned executed anyway for his own amusement and forces Sansa to view Ned&#x27;s severed head mounted on a spike.

=== Later novels ===
In the follow-up novel &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot;, Ned&#x27;s execution sparks an all-out conflict between House Stark and House Lannister, with other houses and pretenders also joining in against the crown, leading to a major civil war later called the War of the Five Kings. After Tyrion Lannister is sent to King&#x27;s Landing to salvage the political mess, he returns Ned&#x27;s remains to his widow Catelyn, who sends them north to be finally laid in House Stark&#x27;s ancestral crypt, but it is not confirmed whether it has ever arrived at Winterfell as the road back to the North has been cut off by Ironborn invaders. Lady Barbrey Dustin of Barrowton, who holds past grudges against Ned, later claims that she personally will never let Ned&#x27;s bones to be returned and laid to rest in Winterfell&#x27;s crypt if they are found on her fief.

Ned is mentioned in a flashback along with his friend Robert Baratheon and also repeatedly by other characters in the subsequent novels &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot; and &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot;, including the surviving Stark children (who all remember him fondly), Stannis Baratheon, Jorah Mormont (who both affirm respect to his honor), House Manderly and numerous members of the Northern mountain clans (who all continue to hold great love to his name). The mountain clansmen, in particular, only join Stannis&#x27; march on the Bolton-controlled Winterfell in honor of Ned&#x27;s legacy.

In &quot;A Feast for Crows&quot;, when Queen Dowager Cersei is sentenced to the walk of atonement by the Faith of the Seven, she is frequently haunted by the imaginary vision of Ned silently mocking her in the crowd.

=== Family tree of House Stark ===
== TV adaptation ==

In January 2007 HBO secured the rights to adapt Martin&#x27;s series for television. When the pilot went into production in 2009, one of the first casting announcements was Sean Bean as the &quot;lead&quot; Eddard Stark. As the show premiered in 2011, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called Bean&#x27;s Ned &quot;the strong and brooding headliner of the series&quot;.

As in the source novel, Ned is beheaded in the ninth episode of season 1, &quot;Baelor&quot;. Though praising the character&#x27;s demise for its role in propelling the story, James Hibberd of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; later noted that:
Hibberd echoed the show&#x27;s producers&#x27; statement that &quot;the move lays down a dramatic precedent for the show: Nobody is safe&quot;. He called it a &quot;risky&quot; move that would probably lose the show viewers who had tuned in for Bean, but would hopefully attract others impressed by the boldness of it. Executive producer and writer D. B. Weiss told &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; in 2011 that when he and Benioff pitched the series to HBO, the fact that &quot;main character&quot; Ned was slated to die &quot;was a selling point for them&quot;. Noting that the network has killed off characters in other successful series, he said that this sense of jeopardy &quot;completely ups the ante for any moment when a character is in a dire situation if you know another character didn&#x27;t survive a similar situation&quot;. HBO programming president Sue Naegle concurred, saying that Ned&#x27;s death made the show creatively more attractive, adding that &quot;The book series was filled with unexpected twists and turns. I loved this idea we&#x27;d bring together the group of characters, then once you started to believe all the tropes of heroes, you pull the rug out from under them. It&#x27;s the opposite of feeling manipulated&quot;. Noting that the story and world of the series is bigger than any one character, Naegle said, &quot;Sean brings a giant following, but &quot;Thrones&quot; is not just about the promise you&#x27;re going to see one of your favorite actors week in and week out. The star is the story&quot;. Bean noted that Ned&#x27;s death &quot;was as much a surprise to me as anyone&quot; and called it &quot;a very courageous move for a television company&quot;.

The image of Bean as Ned Stark sitting in the Iron Throne is featured on the covers of the 2011 Season 1 DVD and Blu-ray Disc sets, released in March 2012.

The character makes a return in the sixth season, under a recurring capacity, via flashback visions of his youth and childhood seen by Bran and the Three-Eyed Raven using Greensight.

===Storylines===
====Season 1====
In season 1, King Robert Baratheon travels to Winterfell and asks his old friend and closest ally Eddard &quot;Ned&quot; Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, to assume the position of Hand of the King after the sudden death of their mentor, Jon Arryn. Not interested in politics or the intrigues of the court, Ned accepts out of duty, as well as to discover how Arryn died. Ned travels to King&#x27;s Landing with his daughters Arya and Sansa, the latter of which is betrothed to Robert&#x27;s eldest son, Prince Joffrey. Meanwhile, Ned&#x27;s wife Catelyn has Tyrion Lannister captured, believing he was responsible for sending an assassin to kill Bran and that the Lannisters also killed Jon Arryn. Ned and Robert soon find themselves at odds regarding Daenerys Targaryen, and Ned steps down as Hand in defiance against Robert&#x27;s wishes to have her killed. Soon after, Ned and his guards are attacked by Tyrion&#x27;s brother Jaime Lannister; Ned is injured and his men are murdered. Robert reappoints Ned as Hand and commands him to have Catelyn release Tyrion and make peace with the Lannisters. While Robert departs for a boar hunt, Ned discovers that Tywin Lannister and his forces are laying siege to the Riverlands, the homeland of his wife&#x27;s house, the Tullys. He demands Tywin present himself in King&#x27;s Landing and sends a force to bring his bannermen to justice.

Robert is killed just as Ned discovers that his three children by Cersei were actually fathered by the queen&#x27;s twin, Jaime. Before Ned is able to neutralize Cersei and place Robert&#x27;s brother Stannis on the throne, he is betrayed by Littlefinger, and the queen has him imprisoned for treason. Ned&#x27;s eldest son Robb calls in his father&#x27;s banners and marches an army south in an attempt to rescue his father. Ned makes a public confession to save his daughters from Cersei&#x27;s wrath, but Joffrey has Ned beheaded anyway.

====Seasons 6 and 7====
In the season 6 episode &quot;Home&quot;, Bran sees a vision of Ned (Sebastian Croft) as a child with his sister and brother, Lyanna and Benjen. In the following episode, &quot;Oathbreaker&quot;, Bran witnesses the battle between a young Ned (Robert Aramayo) and the knight Ser Arthur Dayne at the Tower of Joy. In the episode &quot;The Door&quot;, Bran watches Ned bid Benjen and his father, Rickard, farewell as he departs for his fosterage at the Vale. In the following episode, &quot;Blood of My Blood&quot;, Bran briefly glimpses Ned&#x27;s hand amongst someone&#x27;s blood, revealed in the season finale, &quot;The Winds of Winter&quot;, as belonging to Lyanna (Aisling Franciosi), dying of childbirth in the tower. She makes him swear to protect her son - Jon Snow. Bran revisits this moment in the season 7 finale, &quot;The Dragon and the Wolf&quot;, where Lyanna whispers Jon&#x27;s true name to Ned - Aegon Targaryen.

===Recognition and awards===
Bean was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Actor on Television, a Scream Award for Best Fantasy Actor, and an EWwy Award for Best Actor, Drama for the role. IGN named Ned its Best TV Hero of 2011, and Bean won the Portal Award for Best Actor.

<text>Gjøa is a museum ship and was the first vessel to transit the Northwest Passage. With a crew of six, Roald Amundsen traversed the passage in a three-year journey, finishing in 1906.

== History ==

=== Construction ===
The square-sterned sloop of 47 net register tonnage () was built by Knut Johannesson Skaale in Rosendal, Norway in 1872, the same year Amundsen was born. She was named &quot;Gjøa&quot; after her then owner&#x27;s wife. For the next 28 years the vessel served as a herring fishing boat.

=== Purchase by Amundsen ===
On March 28, 1901, Amundsen bought her from Asbjørn Sexe of Ullensvang, Norway, for his forthcoming expedition to the Arctic Ocean. &quot;Gjøa&quot; was much smaller than vessels used by other Arctic expeditions, but Amundsen intended to live off the limited resources of the land and sea through which he was to travel, and reasoned that the land could sustain only a tiny crew (this had been a cause of the catastrophic failure of John Franklin&#x27;s expedition fifty years previously). Her shallow draught would help her traverse the shoals of the Arctic straits. Perhaps most importantly, the ageing ship was all that Amundsen (who was financing his expedition largely by spending his inheritance) could afford.

Amundsen had little experience of Arctic sailing, and so decided to undertake a training expedition before braving the Arctic ice. He engaged Hans Christian Johannsen, her previous owner, and a small crew, and sailed from Tromsø in April 1901. The next five months were spent sealing on the pack ice of the Barents Sea. Following their return to Tromsø in September, Amundsen set about remedying the deficiencies in &quot;Gjøa&quot; that the trip had exposed. He had a little 13-horsepower marine paraffin motor, connected with a winch, for navigation in light winds and to facilitate handlings. Much of the winter was spent upgrading her ice sheathing, as Amundsen knew she would spend several winters iced-in.

=== Journey through the Northwest Passage ===
In the spring of 1902, her refit complete, Amundsen sailed &quot;Gjøa&quot; to Christiania (now Oslo), the capital of Norway. At this time Norway was still in a union with Sweden, and Amundsen hoped the nationalistic spirit which was sweeping the country would attract sponsors willing to underwrite the expedition&#x27;s growing costs. After much wrangling, and a donation from King Oscar, he succeeded. By the time Amundsen returned, Norway had gained its independence, and he and his crew were among the new country&#x27;s first national heroes.

Amundsen served as the expedition leader and &quot;Gjøa&#x27;s&quot; master. His crew were Godfred Hansen, a Danish naval lieutenant and &quot;Gjøa&quot;&#x27;s first officer; Helmer Hanssen, second officer, an experienced ice pilot who later accompanied Amundsen on subsequent expeditions; Anton Lund, an experienced sealing captain; Peder Ristvedt, chief engineer; Gustav Juel Wiik, second engineer, a gunner in the Royal Norwegian Navy; and Adolf Henrik Lindstrøm, cook.

&quot;Gjøa&quot; left the Oslofjord on June 16, 1903, and made for the Labrador Sea west of Greenland. From there she crossed Baffin Bay and navigated the narrow, icy straits of the Arctic Archipelago. By late September &quot;Gjøa&quot; was west of the Boothia Peninsula and began to encounter worsening weather and sea ice. Amundsen put her into a natural harbour on the south shore of King William Island; by October 3 she was iced in.

There she remained for nearly two years, with her crew undertaking sledge journeys to make measurements to determine the location of the North Magnetic Pole and learning from the local Inuit. The harbour, known as Uqsuqtuuq (&quot;much fat&quot;) in Inuktitut, has become the only settlement on the island – Gjoa Haven, Nunavut, which now has a population of over a thousand people (1,349 at the 2021 census).
&quot;Gjøa&quot; left Gjoa Haven on August 13, 1905, and motored through the treacherous straits south of Victoria Island, and from there west into the Beaufort Sea. By October &quot;Gjøa&quot; was again iced-in, this time near Herschel Island in the Yukon. Amundsen left his men on board and spent much of the winter skiing 500 miles south to Eagle, Alaska to telegraph news of the expedition&#x27;s success. He returned in March, but &quot;Gjøa&quot; remained icebound until July 11. &quot;Gjøa&quot; reached Nome in Alaska on August 31, 1906. She sailed on to earthquake ravaged San Francisco, California, where the expedition was met with a hero&#x27;s welcome on October 19.

=== San Francisco ===
Rather than sail her round Cape Horn and back to Norway, the Norwegian American community in San Francisco prevailed on Amundsen to sell &quot;Gjøa&quot; to them.

After being anchored at Mare Island for three years, the Gjøa was given to San Francisco in 1909

The ship was donated to the city of San Francisco, and the ship was dragged up the beach to the northwest corner of Golden Gate Park, surrounded by a low fence and put on display. Amundsen knew that because of the fame that his exploits aboard &quot;Gjøa&quot; had earned, he would be able to gain access to Nansen&#x27;s ship &quot;Fram&quot; which had been custom-built for ice work and was owned by the Norwegian state. Therefore, Amundsen left &quot;Gjøa&quot; in San Francisco. He and his crew traveled back to Norway by commercial ship. Of the original expedition members, only Wiik failed to return to Norway, because he had died of illness during the third Arctic winter.

Souvenir hunters and vandals necessitated a fence be erected and a caretaker hired — the gentleman lived in the ship and was enumerated there during the 1910 United States Census...The city installed a seal tank behind the stern of the ship and, according to &quot;the Call&quot;, the Alaskan fur seal that occupied it acted as an additional nighttime guardian of the boat...Occasionally, the city would be spurred to make repairs and give the Gjøa a paint job (a 1968 visit to the city by Norway’s King Olav provided motivation for one such spruce-up), but generally the vessel that survived the crushing ice of the Arctic seas was a helpless victim to neglect and vandalism.

== Preservation ==

Over the following decades &quot;Gjøa&quot; slowly deteriorated, and by 1939 she was in poor condition.

In 1939, Erik Krag founded the Gjoa Foundation and undertook a complete refurbishment that was completed in 1949.

Refurbishment was delayed by World War II, and repairs were not completed until 1949. Being displayed outdoors and having faced 66 years of high winds, ocean salt and sand, the boat once again suffered deterioration, and evidence of campfires, until in 1972, with the help of Erik Krag, a Danish American shipping company owner (Inter-Ocean Steamship Corporation) of San Francisco, &quot;Gjøa&quot; was returned to Norway. Krag was knighted by the king of Norway for his efforts in shipping home &quot;Gjøa&quot;.

&quot;Gjøa&quot; was displayed in the Norwegian Maritime Museum (Norwegian: &quot;Norsk Maritimt Museum&quot;) in Bygdøy, Oslo. In May 2009 the Norwegian Maritime Museum and the Fram Museum (Norwegian: &quot;Frammuseet&quot;) signed an agreement for the Fram Museum of Bygdøy to take over the exhibition of &quot;Gjøa&quot;. It has been displayed in a separate building at Fram Museum.

A &quot;bauta&quot; (memorial pillar or standing stone) now stands near &quot;Gjøa&quot;&#x27;s former home in San Francisco. &quot;Gjøa&quot; was also featured as a filming location in the 2005 documentary, &quot;The Search for the Northwest Passage&quot;, in which Kåre Conradi played Amundsen.

<text>Daniel Hamburg (born October 6, 1948) is an American politician in Northern California who was elected as a Democratic Party Congressman in 1992, serving one term from 1993 to 1995. In 1998, he was the Green Party gubernatorial candidate in California. He remains active in the Green Party.

He had settled in Mendocino County, California after graduating from Stanford University. In Ukiah he founded an alternative school and was active for several years on the planning commission. In 1980 he was elected as a member of the Mendocino County (California) Board of Supervisors, serving to 1985. He later was elected again twice to the Board of Supervisors, in 2010 and 2014, and served two terms, from 2011 through 2018.

==Early life==
Hamburg was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the son of Jean (Milton) and Walter Hamburg. His family was Jewish.

He attended Stanford University and graduated in 1971. He settled in Ukiah, California, where he founded an alternative school. Hamburg also became involved in local civic affairs and served on the city planning commission from 1976 to 1981. He began to learn about local and regional land use issues. He founded a cultural study program in China.

==Political career==
Hamburg continued to be active in politics as a member of the Democratic Party. He was elected to the Mendocino County Board of Supervisors, serving a four-year term from 1981 to 1985.

=== Congress ===
In 1992, he was elected to California&#x27;s 1st congressional district, beating Republican incumbent Frank Riggs. While in Congress, Hamburg was named one of &quot;People&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;50 Most Beautiful People&quot; in 1993.

In the 1994 mid-term elections, in which Republicans made gains, Riggs defeated Hamburg in a rematch.

=== Green Party ===
Hamburg later became a member of the Green Party and ran as the Green Party nominee for California governor in 1998. He was the first candidate from the Green Party of California to run for governor. He finished a distant third among seven candidates with 104,117 votes, gaining 1.3% of the total vote. During the 2000 presidential election, Hamburg backed Green presidential candidate Ralph Nader.

=== Return to board of supervisors ===

<text>Shaun Patrick Micallef (; born 18 July 1962) is an Australian comedian, actor, writer and television presenter. He was the host of the satirical news comedy series &quot;Shaun Micallef&#x27;s Mad as Hell&quot; on the ABC. He also hosted the game show &quot;Talkin&#x27; &#x27;Bout Your Generation&quot; on Channel 10.

Micallef first gained recognition as a cast member of the sketch comedy show &quot;Full Frontal&quot;, which led to his own sketch show, &quot;The Micallef P(r)ogram(me)&quot;, the sitcom &quot;Welcher &amp; Welcher&quot; and the variety show &quot;Micallef Tonight&quot;. He then hosted the satirical news comedy series &quot;Newstopia&quot; on SBS, the game show &quot;Talkin&#x27; &#x27;Bout Your Generation&quot; on Network Ten, and &quot;Shaun Micallef&#x27;s Mad as Hell&quot; on ABC TV. He also co-created and starred in &quot;Mr &amp; Mrs Murder&quot; on Network Ten.

In addition to his television work Micallef has appeared on stage, most notably in a revival of &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; (2016) for the Melbourne Theatre Company and on radio as the co-host of Melbourne station Vega 91.5&#x27;s morning program. He is also the author of several books: &quot;Smithereens&quot; (2004), &quot;Preincarnate&quot; (2010), &quot;The President&#x27;s Desk&quot; (2014), &quot;Tales from a Tall Forest&quot; (2017), &quot;The Uncollected Plays of Shaun Micallef&quot; (2018), &quot;Mad as Hell and Back&quot; (2019), &quot;Happily Ever Afterwards&quot; (2021) and &quot;Tripping Over Myself&quot;, a memoir (2022).

==Early life and education==
Micallef was born in Adelaide, South Australia, and is of Maltese and Irish descent. His father worked for a company that sold parts for Volvos and his mother was employed at the Adelaide Bank.

As a child, Micallef lived in Clovelly Park and attended St Bernadette&#x27;s School in St Marys then St Joseph&#x27;s Catholic School in Mitchell Park (now Sacred Heart College Middle School) before moving on to Sacred Heart Senior College where he was the College Captain.

Micallef studied law at the University of Adelaide, where he was frequently involved in comedy revues, often involving Francis Greenslade and Gary McCaffrie, with whom he continues to work.

==Influences==
Micallef was influenced by the Goons, Peter Sellers, Marx Brothers, S. J. Perelman, James Thurber, Spike Milligan, Barry Humphries, Frank Muir, Monty Python and Woody Allen.

==Career==
===Early theatre===
In 1972, having three younger sisters taking ballet classes, ten-year-old Micallef was often asked to help out when a dance routine required a boy. The following year he auditioned for the Bunyip Children&#x27;s Theatre and over the next four years participated in plays that they performed in the Scott Theatre during school holidays. In 1976, he doubled for Humphrey B. Bear for personal appearances.

===Legal career===
Micallef was a practising solicitor for ten years in the field of insurance law before making the decision to move to Melbourne and pursue a full-time career in comedy in 1993.

He relates the story that, while working as a solicitor, he talked so much about making a career change and becoming a comedian that his wife Leandra gave him an ultimatum: she marked a date on a calendar and told him to quit his job and become a comedian by that date or never talk about it again.

===Television and film===
Following early TV appearances on &quot;Theatre Sports&quot; (1987) and &quot;The Big Gig&quot; (1989), in early 1993, Micallef was offered a job writing for the &quot;Jimeoin&quot; show which was soon followed by an offer to also write for the sketch comedy show &quot;Full Frontal&quot; where six months later he took on the role as co-producer with Gary McCaffrie. In 1994, Micallef became a full-time cast member of &quot;Full Frontal&quot;, where he became well known for characters such as Milo Kerrigan, Nobby Doldrums and a send-up of Italian male model Fabio. Micallef recalls that the show was a good introduction to television comedy because, with an ensemble cast, its success did not hinge on his performance and he had more freedom to make and learn from mistakes. However, he was frustrated with the lack of control he had over his work in the series as well as the repetition of characters and gags.

Micallef&#x27;s role on &quot;Full Frontal&quot; led to a 1996 special &quot;Shaun Micallef&#x27;s World Around Him&quot; and three seasons of the two-time Logie Award-winning ABC series &quot;The Micallef Program&quot; (1998–2001), which he co-wrote and produced with long-time writing partner Gary McCaffrie. Since the series&#x27; end, he has created and starred in two short-lived television series, the sitcom &quot;Welcher &amp; Welcher&quot; (2003) and the variety show &quot;Micallef Tonight&quot; (2003), and devised a series of telemovies, &quot;BlackJack&quot; (2003–2007).

Micallef has also had acting roles in the television series &quot;SeaChange&quot; (2000), &quot;Through My Eyes&quot; (2004) and &quot;Offspring&quot; (2010) as well as supporting roles in the films &quot;Bad Eggs&quot; (2003), &quot;The Honourable Wally Norman&quot; (2003), &quot;The Extra&quot; (2005), &quot;Aquamarine&quot; (2006) and &quot;The King&quot; (2007). In 2006, he was a recurring guest on the Network Ten improvisational theatre show &quot;Thank God You&#x27;re Here&quot;.

In 2007, along with partners McCaffrie and Michael Ward, Micallef developed the satirical comedy program &quot;Newstopia&quot;, which he hosted. In 2009, Micallef joined the Ten Network and hosted &quot;Talkin&#x27; &#x27;Bout Your Generation&quot;, which aired for four seasons.

He co-created &quot;Mr &amp; Mrs Murder&quot;, a crime comedy television series for Channel Ten which aired in 2013, and starred in the lead role of Charlie Buchanan alongside Kat Stewart. Also that year, Micallef signed on to voice the artificially intelligent robot RE3F in the Australian feature length science fiction film &quot;Arrowhead&quot; (2014).
Micallef hosted &quot;Shaun Micallef&#x27;s Mad as Hell&quot; for 10 years and 15 series on the ABC from 2012 until 2022. Micallef also hosted a two-season reboot of &quot;Talkin&#x27; Bout Your Generation&quot; for Channel Nine (2018–2019) and the game show &quot;Shaun Micallef&#x27;s Brain Eisteddfod&quot; which premiered on Channel 10 on 20 July 2022, running for 10 weeks.

In 2022, he performed in a celebrity tribute to Australian comedian and actor Paul Hogan, &quot;Roast of Paul Hogan&quot;, which was broadcast on Australia&#x27;s Seven Network.

In August 2024, Micallef hosted a series on ABC TV titled &quot;Shaun Micallef&#x27;s Eve of Destruction&quot;. In the same year, he hosted a documentary series on SBS titled &quot;Shaun Micallef&#x27;s Origin Odyssey&quot;.

===Other work===
In September 2005, Micallef began hosting the breakfast show &quot;Shaun, Beverley and Denise&quot; on Melbourne radio station Vega 91.5 FM with comedian Denise Scott and television presenter Beverley O&#x27;Connor. In July 2006, comedian Dave O&#x27;Neil took over as host and the show was renamed &quot;Dave and Denise with Shaun Micallef&quot;. Micallef left the network on 23 November 2007.

Micallef released a book, &quot;Smithereens&quot;, which was published in 2004 and contains a collection of prose, poetry and plays. He describes it as a collection of &quot;all sorts of bits and pieces I have written&quot;. His second book, a novella titled &quot;Preincarnate&quot;, was released in 2010.

In October 2014, Micallef released his third book, &quot;The President&#x27;s Desk: An Alt-History of the United States&quot;; a semi-fictitious history, told from the perspective of the Resolute desk.

Shaun published an autobiography in 2022, &quot;Tripping Over Myself&quot;, A Memoir of a Life in Comedy.

==Personal life==
Born to teetotaling parents, Micallef began drinking alcohol at age 18, and became a teetotaller in 1986, although he did consume alcoholic beverages for a scientific test featured on &quot;Shaun Micallef&#x27;s On The Sauce&quot;. He lives in Williamstown, Victoria, with his wife Leandra, who he married in 1989, and their three sons.

<text>Vicente Gómez Martínez-Espinel (; 28 December 15504 February 1624) was a Spanish writer and musician of the Siglo de Oro. He is credited with the creation of the modern poetic form of the &quot;décima&quot;, composed of ten octameters, named &quot;espinela&quot; in Spanish after him.

==Biography==
Espinel was born in Ronda. He studied at the University of Salamanca, where he adopted as his own his father&#x27;s second surname, and later on at the universities of Granada and Alcalá. As a latinist, he translated to Spanish Horace&#x27;s &quot;Epistola ad Pisones&quot;.

After leaving university, he had an adventurous life as a soldier, serving in Flanders and elsewhere. He was a prisoner of pirates at Argel and a soldier in Italy after being liberated, and returned to Spain about 1584. Afterwards, he moved to Madrid and took holy orders in 1589. Four years later he became chaplain at Ronda, but absented himself from his living. Still, his musical skill obtained for him the post of choirmaster at Plasencia.

His (&quot;Assorted Rhymes&quot;), produced in 1591, showed a caustic wit. Later, in 1618, the printer Juan de la Cuesta published Espinel&#x27;s picaresque novel , for which he is best known. This book, with several autobiographical details, was printed in France the same year and inspired later Lesage&#x27;s &quot;Gil Blas de Santillana&quot;. Espinel also revived the measure known as &quot;décimas&quot; or &quot;espinelas&quot;, consisting of a stanza of ten octosyllabic lines.

Lope de Vega, who referred to Espinel as his teacher, dedicated &quot;El caballero de Illescas&quot; (1602) to Espinel. Espinel also befriended Cervantes, Góngora (whose poetry he helped to publish) and Quevedo. Like his friends, he was a member of the congregation &quot;Esclavos del Santísimo Sacramento&quot;. At the time of his death, he was the chaplain at Madrid, and also the music teacher of the Plasencia bishop.

His bust can be found in Ronda, the city of his birth, in the small Plaza de los Gigantes. His head is decorated with a laurel wreath.

<doc id="1289489" wikidata="Q1120793" url="?curid=1289489" title="Theon Greyjoy">
<text>Theon Greyjoy is a fictional character in the &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series of fantasy novels by American author George R. R. Martin, and its television adaptation &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;. Theon is the youngest son and heir of Balon Greyjoy, taken as a ward by Lord Eddard Stark following Balon&#x27;s failed rebellion. Theon&#x27;s complex and troubled relationship with both his family and his captors is central to the character&#x27;s arc throughout the novels and its television adaptation.

Introduced in 1996&#x27;s &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;, Theon subsequently appeared in &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot; (1998) and &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot; (2011), in which he is reintroduced as “Reek”, the tortured victim of Ramsay Bolton. He is one of the major third person points-of-view through which Martin narrates both books.

Theon is portrayed by English actor Alfie Allen in the HBO television adaptation.

==Character description==
Theon Greyjoy is the heir apparent and only living son of Balon Greyjoy. Theon is the narrator for a total of thirteen chapters in the second and fifth novels, &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot; and &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot;. Theon is 19. He is lean and handsome and he has long black hair. He always smiles and he seems to find everything amusing.

Ten years before the events of the series, Theon was taken hostage by Eddard Stark. He would have been executed had his father Balon displeased King Robert Baratheon. Theon was raised at Winterfell with the Stark children and developed a close friendship with Robb Stark. As an adult, Theon was arrogant, cocky, and proud until being imprisoned by Ramsay Snow, who is the eldest and bastard son of Roose Bolton. During the imprisonment, Ramsay severely tortured and abused Theon physically and psychologically, forcing him to take the name of “Reek”.

== Storylines ==
=== &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; ===

Theon Greyjoy becomes a trusted companion of Robb Stark on the battlefield, participating in the North&#x27;s victories at Riverrun and the Whispering Wood.

=== &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot; ===
Robb sends Theon as an envoy to Pyke, seeking Balon Greyjoy&#x27;s aid in his rebellion against House Lannister. Theon arrives to find Balon instead intends to seize the North while Robb is fighting in the Riverlands. Theon is charged to reave on the Stony Shore, but he decides to take Winterfell. After sending some of his men to besiege Torrhen&#x27;s Square and lure Winterfell&#x27;s garrison away from the castle, Theon and his party invade and capture Winterfell. He releases the prisoner Reek, formerly a servant of House Bolton. When Bran and Rickon Stark apparently escape Winterfell, Reek advises Theon to kill two miller boys and pass their bodies off as those of the Stark children.

Winterfell&#x27;s garrison soon repels the ironborn at Torrhen&#x27;s Square and besieges Winterfell. When Asha refuses to give Theon men to hold the castle, he allows Reek to seek reinforcements from the Dreadfort. Reek returns with several hundred Bolton men, he kills Ser Rodrik Cassel and all the other northmen, but he then reveals his true identity as Roose Bolton&#x27;s bastard Ramsay Snow. Ramsay kills the people of Winterfell, he burns the castle and takes Theon prisoner.

=== &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot; and &quot;A Feast for Crows&quot; ===
Ramsay imprisons Theon in the Dreadfort&#x27;s dungeons and tortures him, though most of the Ironborn believed that Theon is dead. At some point, Theon manages to escape with his former bedwarmer, Kyra, though this turns out to be a trick of Ramsay&#x27;s and the two are soon recaptured and as a result, Kyra gets killed.

=== &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot; ===

Ramsay&#x27;s torture leaves Theon with some of his toes, fingers and teeth missing. The trauma of this torture causes Theon to lose much of his body weight, and turns his hair white. Psychologically broken, he is forced to assume the identity of Reek. When Roose Bolton begins to lead his forces back to the North, Ramsay (who has since been legitimised as a Bolton) forces Theon to convince the Ironborn garrison holding Moat Cailin to surrender, but flays them regardless. Theon is forced to give away Jeyne Poole (who is presented as Arya Stark) at her wedding to Ramsay, who later sexually abuses both Theon and Jeyne. Theon later encounters Mance Rayder (disguised as Abel the bard) and his spearwives, who ask for his help in freeing “Arya Stark”, having been sent by Jon Snow. When the alarm is raised, Theon jumps from Winterfell&#x27;s battlements with Jeyne and is captured by Mors Umber, who sends him to Stannis Baratheon&#x27;s camp several days&#x27; ride away. There he is reunited with Asha, who initially does not recognise him.

=== &quot;The Winds of Winter&quot; ===

Theon is kept prisoner by Stannis, who notes that he may have useful information about the Boltons but means to execute him for the supposed murders of Bran and Rickon. Asha unsuccessfully tries to ransom Theon before convincing Stannis to behead him rather than burn him alive.

=== Family tree of House Greyjoy ===
==TV adaptation==
Theon Greyjoy is played by Alfie Allen in the television adaptation of the series of books.

=== Season 1 ===
Theon is introduced as the hostage and ward of Lord Eddard Stark, stemming from the failed Greyjoy Rebellion. Despite his position, he remains loyal to Eddard and is good friends with his sons Robb and Jon. While he has never questioned his position, he soon begins to have doubts after Tyrion Lannister tells him he is nothing more than a servant to the Starks and that not everyone respects him. Nevertheless, Theon initially remains loyal to Robb after he goes to war with the Lannisters and supports his decision to have the North secede from the Seven Kingdoms and form their own kingdom.

=== Season 2 ===
Theon is sent to the Iron Islands to persuade Balon to ally with the Starks against the Lannisters, but Balon instead intends to conquer the North while its army is fighting in the Westerlands. Theon is insulted when he is given command of a single ship to raid the Stony Shore and contemplates sending a warning to Robb, but ultimately decides to remain loyal to his family. When his crew proves to be disrespectful of Theon&#x27;s station, his first mate Dagmer Cleftjaw suggests that Theon prove himself by capturing Winterfell. Theon lures the Stark garrison away from Winterfell and easily captures the castle, but is forced to execute his old mentor Ser Rodrik Cassel when he refuses to yield. The wildling servant Osha seduces Theon to allow Bran and Rickon Stark the opportunity to escape. Theon&#x27;s men are unable to recapture the two and Theon kills two farm boys to pass their bodies off as those of the Stark boys, an act he soon feels guilty for.

Theon asks his sister Yara to bring reinforcements, but instead she arrives with a paltry force to warn Theon of his untenable position and to return to the Iron Islands. Theon refuses, and soon afterwards Winterfell is besieged by men of House Bolton commanded by (the then unnamed) Ramsay Snow, the sadistic bastard son of Lord Roose Bolton. Theon attempts to rally his men to fight to the death, but they knock him out and hand him over to Ramsay, hoping for amnesty. Ramsay disobeys his orders to free the Ironborn and instead flays them all and sacks Winterfell, before taking Theon back to the Dreadfort as prisoner.

=== Season 3 ===
Theon is taken captive and tortured in an unknown castle, but later manages to escape with the help of a serving boy who claims to work for Yara. He is brought back to the very castle he escaped from, the serving boy proving to actually be his captor, Ramsay Snow. Theon is subsequently brutally tortured, flayed and seemingly castrated by Ramsay, who forces him to rename himself Reek, and beats him until he submits to his new name.

What is claimed to be Theon&#x27;s penis is sent in a box to Balon, with Ramsay threatening to mutilate Theon further unless the Ironmen retreat from the North. Balon refuses, as Theon defied him and believes he is now unable to further the Greyjoy line. Outraged, Yara responds that she intends to save her brother on her own accord.

=== Season 4 ===
Theon, submitting to his identity as Reek, has been freed from his restraints but remains Ramsay&#x27;s prisoner, residing in the kennels with Ramsay&#x27;s hounds. Yara infiltrates the Dreadfort, but he refuses to go with her, and she is forced to flee when Ramsay releases his hounds. Impressed with Theon&#x27;s loyalty, Ramsay has him resume his identity as Theon Greyjoy to gain entry to Moat Cailin, a fortress occupied by Ironborn that is preventing Roose Bolton&#x27;s forces from returning North. Theon promises that Ramsay will give the Ironborn amnesty if they surrender, but Ramsay goes back on his word and has the garrison flayed. Afterwards, Theon accompanies Ramsay (now legitimized as a Bolton) and the rest of House Bolton as they move to occupy Winterfell.

=== Season 5 ===
Theon is stunned to find that Ramsay has been betrothed to Sansa Stark. He tries to avoid her until Ramsay&#x27;s psychotic paramour Myranda leads Sansa to Theon&#x27;s sleeping quarters, a cage in the kennels. After learning of their reunion, Ramsay involves Theon in his torment of Sansa by having him give her away at the wedding and then forces him to watch as he rapes her on their wedding night. Sansa asks for Theon&#x27;s assistance to escape from Ramsay, but Theon, wishing to spare her Ramsay&#x27;s wrath, instead warns Ramsay, causing him to flay the maid who had tried to help Sansa escape. When Sansa confronts Theon, he confesses that he did not kill her brothers, but is too scared to give more information.

While Ramsay and the Bolton army attack Stannis Baratheon&#x27;s forces, Sansa makes another escape attempt, but is caught and threatened by Myranda. Finally snapping, Theon pushes Myranda over a walkway to her death, just as the victorious Boltons return. Rather than face Ramsay&#x27;s anger, Theon and Sansa jump from the Winterfell battlements into the snow and flee.

=== Season 6 ===
Theon and Sansa are caught by Bolton hunters in the woods surrounding Winterfell, but are saved by the arrival of Brienne of Tarth and Podrick Payne, who kill the hunters. Although Sansa and Brienne decide to make for Castle Black, where Jon Snow is Lord Commander of the Night&#x27;s Watch, Theon tells her that he does not deserve the Starks&#x27; forgiveness and instead decides to return to the Iron Islands. Theon returns to the Iron Islands to discover that Balon is dead, and offers to support Yara at the Kingsmoot, a ceremony where the Ironborn elect their new leader. However, the Kingsmoot is won by Theon&#x27;s uncle Euron Greyjoy, who admits to killing Balon but wins over the Ironborn by promising to conquer Westeros through marriage to Daenerys Targaryen, who possesses the only known living dragons in the world. Correctly surmising that Euron will have them put to death, Theon, Yara, and their loyalists flee the Iron Islands with the best ships of the Iron Fleet. Theon remains psychologically traumatized by Ramsay&#x27;s torture, but is urged by Yara to find courage. They travel to Meereen, which Daenerys has taken as her seat, and form an alliance with her. During said time, Theon makes amends with Tyrion Lannister who stands as Daenerys&#x27; advisor. Theon and Yara then join Daenerys as she sets sail for Westeros.

=== Season 7 ===
After Daenerys seizes Dragonstone as her base for the invasion of Westeros, Theon and Yara are sent with Ellaria Sand and the Sand Snakes to Dorne to transport the Dornish army to besiege King&#x27;s Landing. However, Yara&#x27;s fleet is attacked by Euron in the Narrow Sea, with Euron personally taking Yara captive. Theon&#x27;s PTSD is triggered after watching the carnage and he jumps overboard, being rescued some time later by survivors of the battle unimpressed by his cowardice.

Theon returns to Dragonstone, seeking Daenerys&#x27; aid in freeing Yara, but discovers that Daenerys has left to confront the Lannister army on the Roseroad. He is confronted by Jon Snow, now King of the North after defeating Ramsay. Theon asks about Sansa&#x27;s well-being. Jon grabs Theon by the lapels and furiously tells him that his life is only being spared since he helped save Sansa.

After Jon captures a wight beyond the Wall, Theon joins Daenerys, Jon, and their retinues as they present the wight to Queen Cersei Lannister as evidence of the White Walkers&#x27; threat. During the meeting, Theon is confronted by Euron, who threatens to execute Yara if Theon does not bend the knee to him. Returning to Dragonstone, Theon speaks to Jon, who reassures him that Theon is both a Stark and a Greyjoy and forgives him, urging him to find and rescue Yara. Inspired by this, and remembering that Yara was the only one who tried to free him from Ramsay, Theon orders the Ironborn survivors to aid him in freeing Yara. Their leader, Harrag, defies Theon and nearly beats him to death, but Theon eventually gains the upper hand and beats Harrag senseless. Having regained the respect of the Ironborn, Theon leads his men to find Yara.

=== Season 8 ===
Theon and his men infiltrate Euron&#x27;s ship and rescue Yara. Yara decides to retake the Iron Islands while Euron is preoccupied in King&#x27;s Landing, but gives Theon her blessing to travel to Winterfell with his men to stand with the Starks against the White Walkers. He reunites with Sansa and pledges fealty to House Stark for the impending battle.

At the war council before battle, Bran (who has since developed his greenseeing abilities to become the Three-Eyed Raven) declares that he will wait in the Godswood to lure out the Night King, commander of the White Walkers. Theon volunteers to defend him with the Ironborn. While preparing for battle, Theon attempts to apologize to Bran for his misdeeds, but Bran reassures him that his actions ultimately brought him back &quot;home&quot; to Winterfell.

Theon defends Bran against the undead until he is the last survivor, but the Night King arrives. Bran thanks Theon, and Theon charges at the Night King, but he is killed after the Night King impales him with his own spear. In the aftermath of the Long Night, Theon is cremated along with those slain in battle.

== Reception ==
Originally auditioning for the role of Jon Snow, English actor Alfie Allen has received critical acclaim for his role as Theon Greyjoy in the TV series, and was nominated for the Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for the 2019 Primetime Emmy Awards.

<text>The National Cyber Security Division (NCSD) is a division of the Office of Cyber Security &amp; Communications, within the United States Department of Homeland Security&#x27;s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. Formed from the Critical Infrastructure Assurance Office, the National Infrastructure Protection Center, the Federal Computer Incident Response Center, and the National Communications System, NCSD opened on June 6, 2003. 

The NCSD&#x27;s mission is to collaborate with the private sector, government, military, and intelligence stakeholders to conduct risk assessments and mitigate vulnerabilities and threats to information technology assets and activities affecting the operation of the civilian government and private sector critical cyber infrastructures. NCSD also provides cyber threat and vulnerability analysis, early warning, and incident response assistance for public and private sector constituents. NCSD carries out the majority of DHS’ responsibilities under the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative. The FY 2011 budget request for NCSD is $378.744 million and includes 342 federal positions. The current director of the NCSD is John Streufert, former chief information security officer (CISO) for the United States Department of State, who assumed the position in January 2012.

==Strategic objectives and priorities==

Strategic Objectives

To protect the cyber infrastructure, NCSD has identified two overarching objectives:
* To build and maintain an effective national cyberspace response system.
* To implement a cyber-risk management program for protection of critical infrastructure.

Priorities
* Continued development of the EINSTEIN system’s capabilities as a critical tool in protecting the Federal Executive Branch civilian departments and agencies.
* Development of the National Cyber Incident Response Plan (NCIRP) in full collaboration with the private sector and other key stakeholders. NCIRP ensures that all national cybersecurity partners understand their roles in cyber incident response and are prepared to participate in a coordinated and managed process.
* Increase the security of automated control systems that operate elements of the national critical infrastructure.

==Organization==
NCSD is funded through the following Congressionally appropriated Programs, Projects and Activities (PPA): United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT), Strategic Initiatives, and Outreach and Programs:

US-CERT leverages technical competencies in federal network operations and threat analysis centers to develop knowledge and knowledge management practices. US-CERT provides a single, accountable focal point to support federal stakeholders as they make key operational and implementation decisions and secure the Federal Executive Branch civilian networks. It does so through a holistic approach that enables federal stakeholders to address cybersecurity challenges in a manner that maximizes value while minimizing risks associated with technology and security investments. Further, US-CERT analyzes threats and vulnerabilities, disseminates cyber threat warning information, and coordinates with partners and customers to achieve shared situational awareness related to the Nation’s cyber infrastructure. US-CERT funds also support the development, acquisition, deployment, and personnel required to implement the National Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS), operationally known as EINSTEIN. The EINSTEIN Program is an automated intrusion detection system for collecting, correlating, analyzing, and sharing computer security information across the federal government to improve our Nation’s situational awareness. EINSTEIN is an early warning system that monitors the network gateways of Federal Executive Branch civilian departments and agencies for malicious cyber activity. DHS is deploying EINSTEIN 1 and 2 systems in conjunction with the federal TIC initiative, which optimizes network security capabilities into a common solution for the Federal Executive Branch and facilitates the reduction and consolidation of external connections, including Internet points of presence, through approved access points. As of March 2012, EINSTEIN 3 is currently being staged for roll-out to federal agencies for those that have reached a high TIC compliance.

The National Cybersecurity Center (NCSC) is a component of US-CERT’s budget. The NCSC fulfills its presidential mandate as outlined in National Security Presidential Directive 54/Homeland Security Presidential Directive 23 in ensuring that federal agencies can access and receive information and intelligence needed to execute their respective 7 cybersecurity missions. The NCSC accomplishes this through the following six mission areas: Mission Integration, Collaboration and Coordination, Situational Awareness and Cyber Incident Response, Analysis and Reporting, Knowledge Management, and Technology Development and Management, each supported by developing NCSC programs and capabilities.

Strategic Initiatives enables NCSD to establish mechanisms for federal partners to deploy standardized tools and services at a reduced cost, paving the way for a collaborative environment that enables the sharing of best practices and common security challenges and shortfalls. In addition, Strategic Initiatives enables NPPD to develop and promulgate sound practices for software developers, IT security professionals, and other CIKR stakeholders; it also enables collaboration with the public and private sectors to assess and mitigate risk to the nation’s cyber CIKR.

Outreach and Programs promotes opportunities to leverage the cybersecurity investments of public and private industry partners. This PPA encourages cybersecurity awareness among the 8 general public and within key communities, maintains relationships with government cybersecurity professionals to share information about cybersecurity initiatives, and develops partnerships to promote collaboration on cybersecurity issues. Outreach and Programs enables governance and assistance in setting policy direction and establishes resource requirements for NCSD’s complex activities.

==Early leadership turnover==
NCSD has been plagued by leadership problems, having had multiple directors that resign after serving only short terms, or potential candidates for the position of director who refuse the position. As chair of the pre-existing Counter-terrorism Security Group, Richard Clarke was initially offered the position of director of the NCSD, but refused citing concerns that there would be too many bureaucratic layers between him and Homeland Security director Tom Ridge. Robert Liscouski ran the division initially while a permanent director was sought and continued on as Assistant Director until February 2005. Amit Yoran became director of NCSD in September 2003 and helped set up the division, but after only a year in the job, left abruptly in October 2004. One of the division&#x27;s deputy directors, Andy Purdy, assumed the position of interim director within a week of Yoran&#x27;s departure. In 2006 upon Andy Purdy&#x27;s departure Jerry Dixon took on the role as acting director in December 2006 until officially appointed to the position as executive director in January 2007. Upon Dixon&#x27;s departure in September 2007 Mcguire took on the role of acting director until March 2008 which the USSS assigned Cornelius Tate and Anita Calinoiu to be the current director of NCSD.

An audit of the division, conducted by DHS&#x27;s inspector general Clark Kent Ervin, cast a negative view on the division&#x27;s first year. Although the report praised the formation of the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) and the National Cyber Alert System, the division received criticism for failing to set priorities, develop strategic plans and provide effective leadership in cyber security issues.

<doc id="1289516" wikidata="Q696246" url="?curid=1289516" title="Order of the Chrysanthemum">
<text>is Japan&#x27;s highest order. The Grand Cordon of the Order was established in 1876 by Emperor Meiji of Japan; the Collar of the Order was added on 4 January 1888. Unlike European counterparts, the order may be conferred posthumously.

Apart from the Imperial Family, only seven Japanese citizens have ever been decorated with the collar in their lifetimes; the last such award was to former Prime Minister Saionji Kinmochi in 1928. Eight others have been posthumously decorated with the collar; the last such award was to former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in 2022. Today, only the reigning Emperor holds this dignity as sovereign of the order; however, exceptions are made for foreign heads of state, who can be awarded the collar in friendship.

The grand cordon is the highest possible honour a Japanese citizen can be awarded during his or her lifetime. Aside from members of the Imperial Family, 53 Japanese citizens have been decorated with the grand cordon; of these, only 23 were living at the time of receipt.

==Insignia==
The &quot;collar&quot; of the order is made of gold, and features the kanji for &quot;Meiji&quot;, in classic form, indicating the era of the order&#x27;s establishment. It is decorated with gold chrysanthemum blossoms and green-enameled leaves.

The sash of the &quot;grand cordon&quot; of the order is red with dark blue border stripes. It is worn on the right shoulder.

The &quot;star&quot; of the order is similar to the badge, but in silver, without the chrysanthemum suspension, and with an eight-pointed gilt medallion (with white-enameled rays and red-enameled sun disc) placed at the center. It is worn on the left chest.

The &quot;badge&quot; of the order is a four-pointed gilt badge with white-enameled rays; the center bears a red enameled sun disc. On each of the four corners of the badge is a yellow-enameled chrysanthemum blossom with green-enameled chrysanthemum leaves. The badge is suspended on a yellow-enameled chrysanthemum, either on the collar or on the grand cordon.

<text>Susan Cummings (born July 21, 1962, in Monte Carlo, Monaco) is an American heiress, best known for killing her boyfriend in 1997. She had been charged with homicide, but subsequently convicted of voluntary manslaughter only. She was released after serving 57 days.

==Biography==

Cummings and her fraternal twin sister, Diana, are the only children of billionaire arms dealer Samuel Cummings. After the family moved to the United States, Samuel Cummings bought his daughters a lavish estate in Warrenton, Virginia, named Ashland Farms. It was here that Cummings shot Roberto Villegas on September 7, 1997.

Cummings sold the &quot;Ashland Farm&quot; estate on the edge of Warrenton in Fauquier County, Virginia for $4.9 million in 2004. She and her twin sister Diana moved to the LeBaron Farm in Culpeper County, Virginia. Their manor house, designed by the firm of Versaci Neumann Partners, won recognition in the 2006 Washingtonian Residential Design awards.

==Killing==

Cummings had been in a relationship with Argentine polo player Roberto Villegas, who had emigrated to the U.S. in 1991. It was common for Argentine polo players to be recruited onto teams owned by wealthy landowners. The players would also be supplied with horses and accommodation.

Cummings met Villegas in 1995 and by 1996 the relationship had gotten more intense. He forwent returning to Florida for the polo season to help her on her farm. Cummings never paid Villegas for his work; however, she did pay his rent and costs for the horses he owned that he kept on her farm. Cummings had a lot of control over Villegas due to his not having a real income. By mid 1997, strains on the relationship were starting to show.

On the day of his death, Villegas was to play in a polo tournament representing Argentina. He left his apartment and traveled to Cummings&#x27;s farm (where he also stored his gear). At 9 in the morning, Cummings shot Villegas four times in the second kitchen of the main house.

She told the 911 dispatcher and police that he had turned abusive towards her, threatening her with a knife. Villegas was found with a knife crossing his arm. Cummings had cuts on her arm, which police suspected were self-inflicted. She was arrested on charges of homicide. She was represented by Blair Howard. Howard&#x27;s law firm claims he is one of the best ten lawyers in the country.

Cummings was convicted on May 13, 1998, of voluntary manslaughter in the death of her boyfriend, and was sentenced to 60 days in jail and ordered to pay $2,500; she was released after serving 57 days.

==In film and media==

In 2002, this case was the focus of an episode of &quot;Dominick Dunne&#x27;s Power, Privilege, and Justice&quot;. Entitled &quot;A Scandal in Hunt County,&quot; this was the third episode of Season One.

In 2004, Lisa Pulitzer wrote a book on the case called &quot;A Woman Scorned&quot;.

A Biography Channel program about the case included an interview with a young Tareq Salahi, who was a friend of Roberto Villegas.

April 26, 2017 The Podcast &quot;Small town Murder&quot; Episode 15 &quot;An Heiress &amp; A Brutal Murder in Warrenton, Virginia&quot; was done about the case. 
Susan Cummings&#x27; case was featured in an episode of &quot;Behind Mansion Walls&quot;, and on the Investigation Discovery channel program &quot;Vanity Fair Confidential&quot;, season 2, episode 8, entitled &quot;Love&#x27;s Deadly Harness&quot;.

<doc id="1289585" wikidata="Q5438095" url="?curid=1289585" title="Faulconbridge, New South Wales">
<text>Faulconbridge is a village located in the Blue Mountains. It is about west of the Sydney central business district, New South Wales and is 450 metres above sea level. At the 2016 census, Faulconbridge had a population of 4,025 people. At the 2021 cenus, the population had risen to 4,156.

==History and description==

The Faulconbridge area was occupied by Indigenous Australians long before European exploration. They left behind numerous signs of their presence, one of the most outstanding being the group of rock carvings in Ticehurst Park. This site includes a wide variety of carvings, including two emus, some grinding grooves and several waterholes created or modified to collect rainwater.

European exploration of the area began with Blaxland, Wentworth and Lawson in May 1813, while they were camped at Springwood and looking for a route which would take them over the mountains. It was settled in the 1870s after the railway line had opened the mountains up.

One of the earliest residents was the &quot;Father of Federation&quot;, Sir Henry Parkes, who moved to the area in 1877 and purchased 600 acres (2.4 km2). It is said that the original railway platform at Faulconbridge was specifically built to serve his residence, which was known as Faulconbridge House. The town was named after Parkes&#x27; home. Faulconbridge was the maiden name of Parkes&#x27; mother, while a small waterfall in the area — Clarinda Falls — was named after his first wife, Clarinda Varney (the Varney name was passed on to Parkes&#x27; son, Varney Parkes). Parkes is buried in Faulconbridge Cemetery, alongside the grave of his first wife, Varney Parkes and other family members. The railing surrounding his grave bears a plaque which describes his role in Australian history:

:&quot;Sir Henry Parkes, Father of Australian Federation, five times Prime Minister of New South Wales, arrived in Australia 25 July 1839, he worked as station-hand, Customs Officer and bone and ivory turner. In 1850 became proprietor of Empire Newspaper. Member of New South Wales Parliament from 1854-1894, Sir Henry Parkes is especially remembered for his efforts to develop New South Wales Education and Railways and his work for Federation earned him his title Father of Federation.&quot;

On Sir Henry&#x27;s Parade (which runs between Springwood and Faulconbridge on the southern side of both the railway line and the highway) is Jackson Park, which is home to the Prime Ministers&#x27; Corridor of Oaks. Joseph Jackson, a NSW Member of Parliament, gave the park to the local council in 1933 with the explicit intention of having every Prime Minister of Australia, or a nearest surviving relative, plant an oak tree. Jackson was a huge admirer of Henry Parkes and believed that his Corridor of Oaks was a suitable monument to the man most responsible for the federation of Australian states. Every Prime Minister since Gough Whitlam has had their tree destroyed soon after planting, and the trees representing these Prime Ministers were re-planted later. In 1975 Malcolm Fraser faced a hostile crowd when he came to plant his oak. Jackson Park is named after Jackson.

Faulconbridge is well known for having been the home of artist Norman Lindsay. The Norman Lindsay Gallery and Museum, owned by the National Trust of Australia, is at the end of Chapman Parade. Some Faulconbridge streets have been given names of characters out of Lindsay&#x27;s famous 1918 children&#x27;s book &quot;The Magic Pudding&quot;. These include Bill Barnacle Avenue, Watkin Wombat Way and more. Lindsay gave his name to the Division of Lindsay, but Faulconbridge is actually in the Division of Macquarie.

Fire Chief Phil Koperberg lived in Watkin Wombat Way. He later became a politician representing the seat of the Blue Mountains.

A number of Aboriginal carvings are also to be found on the rock shelves in the area.

One of the most prominent landmarks in the area is the ruined house called Eurama, two kilometres west of Faulconbridge station. This substantial stone house with Tudor chimneys was built in 1881 by the stonemason Paddy Ryan, for Andrew McCulloch. The property was substantial enough, or the owner had enough influence, to even warrant its own platform on the nearby railway line, &quot;Numantia&quot;. At first it was called Weemala, but the name was changed to Eurama by later owners. It was unused for some time until being restored by a new owner, but was then destroyed by bushfires in 1968. The region was again under threat during the 2013 New South Wales bushfires.

<text>The Catete Palace (, ) is an urban mansion in the Flamengo neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The property stretches from &quot;Rua do Catete&quot; (Catete Street) to &quot;Praia do Flamengo&quot; (Flamengo Beach). Construction began in 1858 and ended in 1867. It was Brazil&#x27;s presidential palace from 1897 to 1960, and the site of Getúlio Vargas&#x27; suicide. It now houses the &quot;Museu da República&quot; (Republic Museum) and a theatre. The Catete underground rail station is adjacent.

==History==

The building was built as the residence of the family of the Portuguese-born Brazilian coffee producer António Clemente Pinto, Baron of Nova Friburgo, in the then capital of the Empire of Brazil. It was called the Palace of Largo Valdetaro and Palace of Nova Friburgo.

With the design of German architect Carl Friedrich Gustav Waehneldt, dated 1858, the work began with the demolition of the old house. The construction officially ended in 1866, but the finishing works still continued for over a decade.

After the death of the Baron and the Baroness, their son Antônio Clemente Pinto Filho, the Count of São Clemente, sold the property in 1889, shortly before the Proclamation of the Republic of Brazil, to an investor group, who founded the &quot;Companhia Grande Hotel Internacional&quot; (Grande Hotel Internacional Company). This development, however, did not succeed in turning the palace into a luxury hotel. Due to the economic crisis in the late 1880s and early 1890s (The &quot;Encilhamento&quot;), the venture went bankrupt, and its titles acquired by counselor Francisco de Paula Mayrink. Five years later, Mayrink paid off debts to the Bank of Brazil.

The seat of the executive branch of Brazil was the Itamaraty Palace in Rio de Janeiro. In 1897, President Prudente de Morais became ill and Vice President Manuel Vitorino took office as interim. He acquired the Catete Palace and over there installed the seat of government. Officially, the palace was the seat of the Federal Government from 1897 until 1960, when the capital and the Federal District were transferred to Brasília.

Various historical events happened in the palace halls, such as the death of President Afonso Pena in 1909; the signing of the declaration of war against the German Empire and its allies in 1917, during World War I; the visit and hosting of Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli, the future Pope Pius XII, in 1934; the declaration of war against the Axis in World War II in 1942; the suicide of President Getúlio Vargas in 1954, with a shot in the heart, in his bedroom on the third floor of the palace; among others.

<doc id="1289621" wikidata="Q1968104" url="?curid=1289621" title="Sutton, Peterborough">
<text>Sutton is a small village and civil parish in the Peterborough district, in the north-west of Cambridgeshire, England. Situated about 5.7 miles from Peterborough and approximately half a mile south of the A47 road.

For electoral purposes it forms part of Glinton and Wittering ward in North West Cambridgeshire constituency.

According to Office for National Statistics Sutton has a population (including Upton) of 196 with a population density of 0.2.

==History==

Dating back to 972–992, the area of Peterborough was described as a &quot;woody swamp&quot; but was cleared to a certain degree when Abbot Adulf built manor houses and granges. In &#x27;Old English&#x27;, Sutton translates as a Southern farm/settlement. The ancient church of Sutton dates back to the 12th century and was originally built as a chapel-of-ease to the church of St Kyneburgha in Castor. It is also home to a war memorial. The church, now named St Michael &amp; All Angels, was originally dedicated to Saint Giles, the patron saint of cripples, lepers and nursing mothers. The majority of the church was rebuilt in 1867–8, but the arch supports have survived from the original construction in the 12th/13th century. A grant of £37,300 was given to complete work on the church by a company called WREN in order for it to become a community hub for locals. Since the grant in 2010, the church has been improved further with such things as heating systems and carpeting.

The historical layout of the village is a simple rectangle of streets engulfing a green where cattle would be, known as a Saxon nucleated settlement (or a Nucleated village), with the grange and chapel located in one corner of the rectangle. With the village being in close proximity to the River Nene, there was once a ford going over to Stibbington, but this was eventually destroyed by dredging after a long period of not being used.
The Manor Farm (also known as &#x27;The Grange&#x27;) was built in the 17th century. Keith Garrett described the manor as a &quot;fully constituted manor with its manor house or hall, its home farm, open fields, and lands of villeins, who held their dwellings and small agricultural holdings for customary services in cultivating the Abbey&#x27;s home farm etc.&quot;

In 1870–72, this is how John Marius Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales&quot; described Sutton:
==Population==

As mentioned previously, the total population of Sutton is at 196 according to the Office for National Statistics for 2011 Census. Between the years of 1881 and 1961 the overall trend shows that population declined, however with some anomalies. The recorded population fluctuated from 1881– In 1881 the total population of Sutton is 92, which then dropped the following ten years to 84. The population peaked in this time period when it rose back up to 98 by 1901, followed by an overall decline of 20 in the 20 years from 1901 to 1921. Just 10 years later, the population grew rapidly to 91 in 1931 which was followed by a fall of 27 over the next 20 years. No census information was found for the population in 1941, shown in the graph, but the population declined further to 58 by the year 1961. We can compare the figures over these years with the population census report for Sutton in 2011, which was 196, showing an increase of 138 residents in Sutton over these 50 years.

Sutton is sparsely populated with a population density of 0.2, showing that the parish it is not a heavily residential area. Using Census data we can also see the change in male and female residents of Sutton over time. Since 1881 there have been slightly more females in this area than males. In 1881 52 females were counted in comparison to just 40 males. Ten years later this changed as only 41 females were recorded to a score of 43 males. Up until 1921 the 2 Census reports showed more females than males occupying the parish. The male numbers remained above the female population in the 1931 Census and were equal with 32 residents recorded of both sexes 20 years on in the 1951 census. By 1961 the female population regained dominance as there were 4 more females than males. Of the 196 residents recorded in the 2011 population census there were 103 male inhabitants to that of 93 female.

169 of the 196 residents of Sutton are English-born according to 2011 census data, in comparison to 176 of 190 residents in 2001, showing that there was an increase in foreign-born people populating Sutton over these 10 years. Using Neighbourhood Statistics we can also analyse the population structure over the last 10 years. In the 2001 census 122 of 190 residents were aged between 30 and 74, showing a majority working population. In the 2011 census there were also 122 people living in sutton from the ages of 30–74 with 52 residents aged from 45 to 59 and a mean average age of 47.3.

The average age of the population of Sutton as a whole, is older than the national average and the Cambridgeshire average, suggesting that it has an ageing population.

==Employment==
Two bar graphs that can be seen in this section portray the occupational orders in Sutton 130 years apart. The bar chart to the right shows Sutton&#x27;s occupational orders in 1881, and what is distinctly noticeable about it is the large number of male residents who were involved in agriculture as an occupation, 28 to be specific. Having such a large proportion of males involved in agriculture could become a problem at this time due to the agricultural depression (Long Depression) which could be a contributor to the fall in population of Sutton in the early 20th century (shown in population graph in the demographics section). It is also evident that 13 females occupations were unknown in the 1881 census. This is due to the fact in the Victorian Era, women&#x27;s work was most likely based around home and family and was inaccurately recorded. The work they could obtain in the factories or in domestic service wouldn&#x27;t be consistent.

The most noticeable change between the two graphs is the decrease in number of people working in the agricultural sector due to the shift in industry from primary industries to that of more technologically advanced industries over the 19th and 20th centuries. The graph shows that the 2 highest occupations in the 2011 census were retail trade and education where precisely 13 economically active residents worked.

In 2014, the area of Peterborough has an unemployment rate of 6.9% of the working population where 79.4% are recorded as economically active. This shows that Sutton is within an area of high unemployment in comparison to the national figure of 5.5%. According to the 2011 Census, 94 residents of the total 138 from the working population are seen to be economically active, whereas the remaining 44 are inactive due to a number of situations such as; retired, sick or disabled or looking after family.

==Housing==

The Area of Sutton has a higher rate of home ownership than the national and Cambridgeshire average, showing that Sutton is a fairly affluent area. The maximum number of houses from the time period 1881–1961 was just 25, with 23 in 1881 and 24 in 1961. The change in number of houses over this time was fairly stagnant. From the 1961 census to the 2011 census the number of houses in Sutton has increased to 74. 55.4% of these houses were owned outright, again showing the affluence of the area. Sutton has developed and grown through building more houses over this time. Data taken from the 2011 census shows that 51 of the 74 houses are detached and 23 semi-detached with no flats in the village at all.

<doc id="1289622" wikidata="Q44968" url="?curid=1289622" title="Robert Lowie">
<text>Robert Harry Lowie (born &quot;&quot;; June 12, 1883 – September 21, 1957) was an Austrian-born American anthropologist. An expert on Indigenous peoples of the Americas, he was instrumental in the development of modern anthropology and has been described as &quot;one of the key figures in the history of anthropology&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Lowie was born and spent the first ten years of his life in Vienna, Austria-Hungary, but came to the United States in 1893. He studied at the College of the City of New York, where in 1896 he met and befriended Paul Radin while taking a BA in Classical Philology in 1901. After a short stint as a teacher, he began studying chemistry at Columbia University, but soon switched to anthropology under the tutelage of Franz Boas, Livingston Farrand and Clark Wissler. Influenced by Wissler, Lowie began his first fieldwork on the Lemhi Reservation in Idaho with the Northern Shoshone in 1906. He graduated (Ph.D.) in 1908. with a dissertation titled &quot;&quot;The Test-Theme in North American Mythology&quot;.

== Career ==
In 1909, he became assistant curator to Clark Wissler at the American Museum of Natural History, New York. During his time there, Lowie became a specialist in American Indians, being active in field research, particularly in several excursions to the Great Plains. This work led in particular to his identification with the Crow Indians. In 1917, he became assistant professor at the University of California, Berkeley. From 1925 until his retirement in 1950, he was professor of anthropology at Berkeley, where, along with Alfred Louis Kroeber, he was a central figure in anthropological scholarship.

Lowie undertook several expeditions to the Great Plains, where he conducted ethnographic fieldwork at the Absarokee (Crow, 1907, 1910–1916, 1931), Arikaree, Hidatsa, Mandan and Shoshone (1906, 1912–1916). Shorter research expeditions led him to the southwestern United States, the Great Basin and to South America where he was inspired by Curt Nimuendajú. The focus of some of Lowie&#x27;s work was salvage ethnography, the rapid collection of data from cultures close to extinction.

Ruth Benedict and Robert Lowie were each commissioned by the United States Office of War Information, during World War II, to write a piece about an enemy. Unlike Benedict&#x27;s &quot;Chrysanthemum and the Sword&quot; in which she describes the culture of Japan without ever having set foot in Japan, Lowie could at least draw on his recollections from the German-speaking world of his childhood. In his book &quot;The German People: A Social Portrait to 1914&quot;, Lowie took a cautious approach and stressed his ignorance of what was going on in his country of origin at this time. Once the war ended, Lowie made several short trips to Germany.

== Influences ==
Together with Alfred Kroeber, Lowie was one of the first generation of students of Franz Boas. His theoretical orientation was within the Boasian mainstream of anthropological thought, emphasizing cultural relativism and opposed to the cultural evolutionism of the Victorian era. Like many prominent anthropologists at the time, including Boas, his scholarship originated in the school of German idealism and romanticism espoused by earlier thinkers such as Kant, Georg Hegel and Johann Gottfried Herder. Lowie, somewhat stronger than his mentor Boas, emphasized historical components and the element of variability in his works. For him, cultures were not finished constructs, but always changing and he stressed the idea that cultures could interact.

In 1919, Lowie published &quot;primitive society&quot;, which &quot;&quot;&quot;criticized the hypothetical reconstruction of the stages of the evolution of civilization as postulated by Lewis H. Morgan&quot;. The book has been seen as a key text in the promotion of theories of social organization in anthropology, being praised by Alfred Reginald Radcliffe-Brown and Bronislaw Malinowski. It was also the work that inspired Claude Levi-Strauss to move his intellectual interest from philosophy to anthropology.

Lowie influenced the discipline of social anthropology through his use of a system to distinguish kinship relationships: he identified four main systems, which differed based on the names of the relatives of the first ascending generation, i.e. the parent generation. His Classification Scheme was slightly modified by George P. Murdock by dividing one of Lowie&#x27;s four systems into a further three types.

== Honours ==
Lowie was given honorary membership of a number of societies such as the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain, the Instituto do Cerara in Brazil, the American Philosophical Society and the New York Academy of Science.

Lowie twice served as editor of the &quot;American Anthropologist.&quot; He also served as chairman of the Division of Anthropology and Psychology of the National Research Council.

Lowie was president of the American Folklore Society from 1916 to 1917. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1931.

==Writings==
His principal works include:
* &quot;Societies of the Arikara Indians&quot; (1914)
* &quot;Dances and Societies of the Plains Shoshones&quot; (1915)

<doc id="1289631" wikidata="Q1264870" url="?curid=1289631" title="Dulzaina">
<text>The dulzaina () or dolçaina (/) is a Spanish double reed instrument in the oboe family. It has a conical shape and is the equivalent of the Breton bombarde. It is often replaced by an oboe or a double reeded clarinet as seen in Armenian and Ukrainian folk music.

Many varieties of the dulzaina exist in Spain. In the Valencian Community, it is known as a &quot;dolçaina&quot; or &quot;xirimita&quot; and is accompanied by a drum called the &quot;tabalet&quot;. The Catalan variety of the dulzaina is called a &quot;gralla&quot;, and the Basque variety is called a &quot;bolin-gozo&quot;. The term &quot;dolçaina&quot; was introduced into Catalan in the 14th century from France (the ancient word was &quot;douçaine&quot;).

In the region of Aragon, especially in the town of Huesca, the dulzaina is played along with &quot;gaitas de boto&quot;, regional bagpipes, and sometimes drums. The instrument was first introduced in Spain through Arabic people. The dulzaina is also heard in a large portion of the region of Castilla y León, where it frequently has keys over the holes. The instrument is deeply rooted in the folklore of Burgos, Segovia, Soria, in some areas of Ávila, Madrid, Guadalajara, Toledo, Cuenca, León and Salamanca, less extended in the Basque Autonomous Community and widely used in Navarre and La Rioja.

==Valencian G dolçaina==
Valencian G dolçaina, otherwise known as dolçaina en sol, is the most typically used dolçaina in Valencia .

===Range===
The range in the concert pitch goes from A3 to E5. F#5 may be occasionally used, but it needs to be the next note progression of the scale and it has to be slurred to the previous note.

===Music reading and writing===

Music for the dolçaina is always written in treble clef. G-dolçaina (dolçaina en sol) is a transposing instrument and its music is written in treble clef. Scores written for dolçaina should ideally be transposed into treble clef. Therefore, the lowest note is D4 (the first one below the treble clef staff) and the highest one is A5 (on the first additional line above the treble clef staff). In order to find the actual concert note pitches (in C) in a score for dolçaina, one must transpose them up a perfect fifth, as for the cor anglais (English horn).

Unless specifically stated otherwise, in the following sections, when there is a reference to notes or keys, one must think on the ones that are used by dolçaina players (in G) and not to the actual pitch (in C).

===Acoustics===

The dolçaina has a penetrating, very powerful sound. Until some years ago, events involving dolçaina were restricted to the streets and squares of many towns and cities. Historically, the dolçaina has played a main role in big gatherings of people during Valencian festivities and traditions, so it is unsurprising that its powerful sound has been specially valued and developed.

Because of its double reed and conical shaped tube, the dolçaina has a sound characteristic of an oboe or a xeremia. However, there are some important differences.

Even though the dolçaina produces a high-pitched sound range, it has a great timbric identity thanks to its richness in harmonics. Under certain acoustic conditions, it can also sound like a soprano saxophone or a trumpet.

Mastering tuning is achieved by fingering and subtle changes in air pressure and in the embouchure. Fingering consists of eight finger holes (7 on the front part and one on the rear part for the thumb; like a recorder).

===Registers===

The dolçaina&#x27;s effective range is divided into two registers, middle register and upper register. They can be distinguished by their timbre and by the way they are produced.

1. Middle register: The sound is natural. It is the most relaxed register. It comprises the first octave, from low D (concert A 3) to high D (concert A 4). Tuning in this register is relatively easy.

2. Upper register: they are the first harmonics of the natural notes. They can be produced by increasing the air pressure - commonly known as &quot;over blowing&quot;. Tuning in this register is very hard and playing the notes in it is tiring and difficult. Sustaining playing in this register is truly exhausting. It is situated in the second octave, from high E (concert B4) to high A (concert E5).

===Accidentals===

Even though the dolçaina was not originally intended to produce chromaticisms, they can be achieved through a very complex and difficult technique, with obvious timbre and volume differences.

Accidentals which can be easily executed and have a powerful and clear sound are first octave C# and D#.

The rest of them are harder to play and their sound is duller and less powerful. They are: first octave F natural, Bb / A#, G# / Ab and second octave F natural, D# / Eb and G# / Ab.

=== Tonalities===

The easiest and most used tonalities are G major and D major, since F# and C# can be played naturally. E Minor is also usual, since first octave D# is relatively easy to play.

C major is the most difficult, since natural F cannot be produced naturally and it is considered an accidental in the dolçaina&#x27;s natural scale. In addition, its lower tonic (lower C) does not exist for dolçaina.

Difficult tonalities: B minor, G minor, A major and A minor.

Very difficult tonalities: E major, D minor, F♯ minor, C♯ minor, F major, Mib major, C minor and B♭ major.

All other tonalities are considered most difficult ones.

===Dynamics===

As mentioned above, the dolçaina has a very powerful and penetrating sound – loud (f - forte) playing is common. Getting a louder sound than forte is impossible.

Thanks to modern interpretation techniques, effects of dynamics can be achieved by varying the air pressure and making subtle changes in the embouchure. The diaphragm technique and good breathing practices allow for effective volume control. However, using dynamics is still too hard, as they make tuning more difficult and timbre less powerful. Therefore, the following points must be taken into account in order to make the best of interpretation and expression:

1.Changes of dynamics must not be used in the second register (from high E to high A). These notes are always loud and only difficult techniques allow the player to darken and soften their sound.

2. As opposed to other instruments, decreasing volume level while playing dolçaina implies a huge physical effort in the embouchure and a very difficult and complex technique. This must be kept in mind.

3. Playing quieter than mezzo piano is very difficult, so success cannot be guaranteed below mp.

4. Sudden changes should not be excessive.

===Articulation===

Articulation on the dolçaina is really limited compared to other wind instruments. This and other technical issues such as the impossibility of executing double or triple staccato force the player to play slower.

In order to play in faster tempos, the musician has to resort to combinations of slurrings, keeping in mind the difficulty implied by the change of octave, where there is a big break in-between the register, and in many instances it is more or less impossible to maintain an even tone.

One of the dolçaina&#x27;s special features is the fact that the easiest and most natural way of playing a sound happens when the player tongues both the start and the end of the note, while on other wind instruments it is much easier to play without articulation. Easy articulation for a dolçaina player consists of a firm, well-defined attack. The dolçaina has a strong sound power and other techniques have not been developed simply because they were not needed (need is the mother of all invention).

In spite of these circumstances, techniques for simple attacks and slurs are evolving at a great pace in order to achieve a wider range of nuances in phrasing. The reason for this evolution lies basically in its coexistence with other regularized instruments.

===Fingering===

Fingering features are almost the same as any other woodwind keyless instrument. However, at a certain pace, it is complicated to play F natural, Bb/A# and Ab/G# due to their fingering positions, like the recorder (a technique known as cross-fingering).

Register changes must also be taken into account, since dolçaina has neither keys nor finger locations to octave change, hence the player has to resort to air pressure and embouchure pressure (harmonics).

===Endurance===

The dolçaina is a musical instrument that quickly tires its players both physically and psychologically, much faster than brass instruments. The reason for this lies with some of its features:

Being a short-length instrument, it offers little resistance to air flow and therefore requires great pressure and a strong airflow.

The reed used on the dolçaina is among the biggest and most resistant in the oboe family, meaning that great pressure must be applied so as to manipulate the sound.

However, endurance may increase progressively if the piece features fewer high-pitched notes, more breaths, empty bars and less dynamics. Difficult accidentals should be avoided as much as possible.

<text>The Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) was the official agency for the collection, analysis and dissemination of quantitative information about higher education in the United Kingdom. HESA became a directorate of Jisc after a merger in 2022.

HESA was set up by agreement between the relevant government departments, the higher education funding councils and the universities and colleges in 1993, following the White Paper &quot;Higher Education: a new framework&quot;, which called for more coherence in HE statistics, and the 1992 Higher and Further Education Acts, which established an integrated higher education system throughout the United Kingdom. In 2018 HESA became the Designated Data Body for higher education in England under the Higher Education and Research Act 2017, with designation passing to Jisc after the 2022 merger.

==Data Collections==
HESA collected data from all publicly funded higher education institutions (HEIs) in the UK as well as a small number of private providers. The annual data collection streams were:
* Student data collection information about students, courses and qualifications at HEIs
* AP Student data collection information about students, courses and qualifications at Alternative Providers of higher education
* Staff data collection information about staff employed by HEIs
* Finance record income and expenditure of HEIs
* Graduate Outcomes survey of graduate activities 15 months after leaving higher education 
* Aggregate offshore record count of students studying wholly overseas for UK HE qualifications
* HE Business and Community Interaction survey information about interactions between HEIs and business and the wider community
* Estates management record buildings, estates and environmental information about HEIs
* Initial Teacher Training (ITT) record
* Unistats collection
* Provider Profile collection
* Destinations of Leavers from Higher Education survey of graduate activities six months after leaving HE (2002/03 to 2016/17)

==Statistical Outputs==
HESA published statistics and analyses based on the data it collects:
* Statistical Bulletins Official Statistics outputs summarising each data stream
* Annual open data releases detailed statistical tables 
* Performance Indicators comparative data on the performance of HEIs in Widening participation, student retention, learning and teaching outcomes, research output and employment of graduates

Jisc processes HESA data to provide data extracts for research and publication by external users such as League tables of British universities.

<text>The People&#x27;s Liberation Army Ground Force (PLAGF), also referred to as the PLA Army, is the land-based service branch of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA), and also its largest and oldest branch. The PLAGF can trace its lineage from 1927 as the Chinese Red Army; however, it was not officially established until 1948.

== History ==


In February 1949, the existing large number of armies and divisions were regularized into up to seventy armies of three divisions each. While some, such as the 1st Army, survived for over fifty years, a number were quickly amalgamated and disestablished in the early 1950s. It appears that twenty per cent or even more of the seventy new armies were disestablished up to 1953; in 1952 alone, the 3rd, 4th, 10th, 17th, 18th, and 19th Armies were disbanded.

The PLAGF consist of conventionally armed main and regional units, which in 1987 made up over 70 percent of the PLA. It provided a good conventional defense, but in 1987 had only limited offensive potential and was poorly equipped for nuclear, biological, or chemical warfare. Main forces included about 35 group armies, comprising 118 infantry divisions, 13 armored divisions, and 33 artillery and antiaircraft artillery divisions, plus 71 independent regiments and 21 independent battalions of mostly support troops. Regional forces consisted of 73 divisions of border defense and garrison troops plus 140 independent regiments.

Under the old system, a field army consisted of three partially motorized infantry divisions and two regiments of artillery and anti-aircraft artillery. Each field army division had over 12,000 personnel in three infantry regiments, one artillery regiment, one armored regiment, and one anti-aircraft artillery battalion. Organization was flexible, the higher echelons being free to tailor forces for combat around any number of infantry divisions. At least theoretically, each division had its own armor and artillery — actual equipment levels were not revealed and probably varied — and the assets at the army level and within the independent units could be apportioned as needed.

In 1987 the new, main-force group armies typically included 46,300 soldiers in up to four divisions, believed to include infantry, armor, artillery, air defense, airborne, and air support elements. Although the new group armies were supposed to reflect a move to combined-arms operations, because of a lack of mechanization they continued to consist of infantry supported by armor, artillery, and other units. The 13 armored divisions each had 3 regiments and 240 main battle tanks (MBT) but lacked adequate mechanized infantry support.

There was little evidence of the use of armored personnel carriers during the Sino-Vietnamese border conflict in 1979, and tanks were used as mobile artillery and as support for dismounted infantry. Artillery forces emphasized towed guns, howitzers, and truck-mounted multiple rocket launchers. In the 1980s some self-propelled artillery entered service, but the PLA also produced rocket launchers as a cheaper but not totally effective alternative to self-propelled guns. There was a variety of construction equipment, mobile bridging, trucks, and prime movers. A new multiple rocket launcher for scattering antitank mines appeared in 1979, but mine-laying and mine-clearing equipment remained scarce.

Regional forces consisted of full-time PLA troops organized as independent divisions for garrison missions. Garrison divisions were static, artillery-heavy units deployed along the coastline and borders in areas of likely attack. Regional forces were armed less heavily than their main-force counterparts, and they were involved in training the militia. They were the PLA units commonly used to restore order during the Cultural Revolution. When chairman Mao proclaimed the People&#x27;s Republic of China on October 1, 1949, the PLAGF was a 4.9 million-strong peasant army. After some time, the demobilization of ill-trained and politically unreliable troops began, resulting in the reduction of army strength.

In the 21st century, the PLAGF are continuing to undergo significant reform, experimentation, modernization, and restructuring to deal with potential threats and enhance their capabilities. Divisions are downsized into combined arms brigades, which reorganized into high-readiness army groups. The division echelon is phased out with only a limited number of division structures remaining existent. While the size of the PLA Ground Force has been reduced over the past few decades, technology-intensive elements such as special operations forces (SOF), army aviation (helicopters), surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), and electronic warfare units have all been rapidly expanded.

The latest operational doctrine of the PLAGF highlights the importance of information technology, electronic and information warfare, and long-range precision strikes in future warfare. The older generation telephone/radio-based command, control, and communications (C3) systems are being replaced by integrated battlefield information networks featuring local/wide-area networks (LAN/WAN), satellite communications, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based surveillance and reconnaissance systems, and mobile command and control centers.

== Structure ==

=== Organization ===
Command of the Chinese armed forces is exercised by the Central Military Commission (CMC) through the service headquarters, including PLAGF headquarters, and the theater commands (TC). The PLAGF component in each TC is the Theater Command Army. Both PLAGF and TC headquarters exercise control over operational units in peacetime, with the TC taking complete control wartime. The military-political dual-command structure is present throughout.

Units in sensitive areas, like Beijing, Hong Kong, and Xinjiang, are subordinated directly to PLAGF headquarters.

After the 2017 reforms, the PLAGF Headquarter structure is a follows: 

==== Functional Departments ====

* Staff Department (参谋部)
* PLA Ground Force Political Work Deparment (政治工作部)。
* PLA Ground Force Logistics Department (后勤部)
* PLA Ground Force Equipment Department (装备部)

=== Branches of service ===
The PLAGF has a standing regular army and a reserve force. Although conscription is employed in China by law, mandatory military service has not been implemented since 1949 as the People&#x27;s Liberation Army has been able to recruit sufficient numbers voluntarily. Chinese militia is not a component of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army, however, they could provide a certain degree of reserve function, which was indicated by &quot;Militia Military Training and Evaluation Outline&quot; released by the People&#x27;s Liberation Army General Staff Department in 2007. The Militia is however explictly not part of the formal Reserve since the passing of the 2022 Reservist Law.

PLAGF branches of service () are composed of infantry (including mechanized infantry), armour, artillery, air defense, aviation, military engineering, anti-chemical, communications, special operations, logistics, reconnaissance, electronic warfare, etc. These branches of service have their respective military education institutions.

=== Operational structure ===
PLA operational structure reflects China&#x27;s strategic missions, political environment, and geographical circumstances. There are 13 corps sized group armies (, also known as combined corps) since the end of April 2017, divided among five Theater commands — Eastern, Southern, Northern, Western and Central. Within the group armies, the old divisions () are being downsized into brigades (). Each group army includes six maneuver combined arms brigades, fire support/artillery brigades, air defense brigades, aviation brigades, special operations brigades, combat support brigades, and sustainment brigades.

The maneuver combat components of the group armies are combined arms brigades (), including a mix of heavy combined arms brigades, medium combined arms brigades, light combined arms brigade, amphibious combined arms brigades, and mountain combined arms brigades. The practice is functionally similar to the US Army brigade combat team concept with unique modifications influenced by China&#x27;s terrain diversity, strategic priority, political system, and military history.

The PLA heavy, medium, and light combined arms brigades share a modular construct, resembling its superior and subordinate units at the corps and battalion level. A typical PLAGF combined arms brigade has the brigade HQ, four maneuver combat battalions, and other support battalions. For instance, a heavy combined arms brigade includes four combined arms battalions (), one artillery battalion, one air defense battalion, one reconnaissance battalion, one combat support battalion, and one sustainment battalion.

Combined arms battalions apply a structure drawn from the brigade echelon. For example, heavy combined arms battalions consist of battalions HQ company (including subordinate medic, reconnaissance, and air defense platoons), four maneuver combat companies including two tank companies (14 tanks per company), and two mechanized infantry companies (14 vehicles per company), one firepower company, and one combat support/sustainment company.

Before the 2015 reform, the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) attributes the PLA Ground Force with nine active armored divisions consisting of a number of armored brigades, 25 infantry divisions (mechanized or motorized), organized into a number of infantry brigades, and 8 artillery divisions, also organized into field artillery brigades. Dennis Blasko wrote in 2000 that the traditional structure of PLA divisions (armored and mechanized) consisted roughly of three regiments – &quot;tuan&quot; () – of the main service arm, each of three battalions () plus support units, a fourth regiment/brigade of infantry (in an armored division) or armor (in an infantry division), a field artillery regiment, an anti-aircraft defense regiment or battalion, and signals, engineer, reconnaissance, and chemical defense battalions or companies, plus combat service support units.

=== Special operations forces ===
The PLA first became interested in modern special warfare in the mid-1980s when it was shifting from the &quot;People&#x27;s War&quot; to &quot;active defense.&quot; After the reform, PLA special operations forces are organized under the combined corps level, as special operations brigades (). Special operation brigades provide organic deep reconnaissance and commando operation capability to the combined arms maneuver operations of their respective group armies, and they are highly specialized to operate in their specific theater. Different from Western-style special operations forces, PLAGF special operations brigades focus on operating in conventional military environments with missions focusing on Special Reconnaissance, target acquisition, Direct Action, sabotage, raids, and search and rescue. The unconventional warfare, counterterrorism, foreign internal defense, civil affairs, and internal security capability in China are covered by People&#x27;s Armed Police (PAP) special operations units, instead of the military.


==Personnel==
=== Commissioned officers ===
The current system of officer ranks and insignia is established in 1988. There are several paths to becoming a commissioned officer, such as joining a military academy, attending reserve officer program, or cadre selection program.

Officers may use &quot;Comrade&quot; to formally address another member of the military (&quot;comrade&quot; plus rank or position, as in &quot;comrade Colonel&quot;, &quot;comrade battalion leader&quot;, or simply &quot;comrade(s)&quot; when lacking information about the person&#x27;s rank, or talking to several service people.)
===Enlisted personnel ===
The current system of other ranks and insignia dates from 2022. Sergeant and Corporal are referred to as non-commissioned officers. New recruits have no military ranks before the boot camp is completed, and they will be awarded the rank of private after they have graduated from the induction training. According to Article 16 of Chapter 3 of the &quot;Regulations on the Service of Active Soldiers of the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army&quot; (), &quot;The lowest enlisted rank is Private&quot;.

Conscripts can be promoted to privates first class in their second year. At the end of two years, conscripts may retire or become NCOs if they volunteer, though the position requires at least high school diploma, specialized skills, or undertaking training courses. They can also attend a military academy to become officers after evaluations.

In 2014, the position of unit &quot;master chief&quot; or &quot;sergeant major&quot; is established to award experienced NCOs that can assist platoon, company, battalion, and higher commands in leadership and training responsibilities.

Soldiers may use &quot;Comrade&quot; to formally address another member of the military (&quot;comrade&quot; plus rank or position, as in &quot;comrade Sergeant&quot;, &quot;comrade squad leader&quot;, or simply &quot;comrade(s)&quot; when lacking information about the person&#x27;s rank, or talking to several service people.)
==Equipment==
===Heavy equipment===
The PLA Ground Force is heavily mechanized with armored platforms, advanced electronic warfare capability, concentrated firepower, and modern weapon systems that are competitive against Western counterparts. The PLA ground force is divided into highly mechanized heavy, medium, and light combined arms units. Heavy combined arms brigades are armored with main battle tanks and tracked infantry fighting vehicles, medium combined arms brigades are armed with tracked or wheeled infantry fighting vehicles, and light combined arms brigades are mobilized with armored personnel carriers, MRAP trucks, or armored cars.

At combined corps level, the PLAGF employs combined arms brigades, heavy artillery systems, medium-range air defense systems, special forces, army aviation units, and various engineering, and electronic warfare support systems. Weapon systems at this level include PLZ-05 howitzer, PCL-181 howitzer, PHL-03/16 multiple rocket launcher, and HQ-16 air defense system. Air assets within the aviation brigade include Z-10 attack helicopter, Z-19 recon helicopter, and Z-20 utility helicopter, etc. Unmanned aerial systems are employed extensively in PLA formations of all types. 

At combined arms brigade level, brigade HQ can deploy various combined arms battalions composited with tanks, assault guns, and infantry fight vehicles (IFV) such as the ZTZ-99A tank, the ZBD-04A IFV, the ZBL-08 IFV, the ZTL-11 assault gun, and the CSK-181 MRAP fast-attack vehicle. Fire support, reconnaissance, and air defense battalion are equipped with PLZ-07, PLL-09, PCL-161/171 self-propelled artilleries, PHL-11, PHZ-11 multiple rocket launchers, AFT-9/10 missile carriers, PGZ-09/95, PGL-12/625, HQ-17/A air defense systems, and such as large amount of unmanned aerial vehicles.

At battalion level, battalion HQ can direct tank company, assault gun company, mechanized infantry company, and firepower company () to provide rapid close-combat maneuver, with support assets including the PCP-001 rapid-firing mortar, PLL-05/PLZ-10 self-propelled gun-mortars, AFT-8 missile carrier, MANPADS, and crew-served weapon systems such as QJG-85 heavy machine gun, PP-87 or newer PBP-172 mortar, QLZ-04 automatic grenade launcher, and HJ-8E wire-guided missile. 

Under each mechanized infantry company are standard infantry platoons and a firepower platoon (), which is equipped with lightweight mortar, anti-material rifle, 35 mm automatic grenade launcher, various rocket launcher, and heavy machine gun. At platoon level, a mechanized infantry squad consists of nine infantrymen, in which seven members are dismounted during combat. Infantry squads vary in composition based on the type of combined arms battalions. Medium and light infantry squads equip reusable rocket launchers to improve anti-armor and anti-fortification capability, whereas heavy infantry squads have no squad-level rockets, instead relying upon fire support from the firepower platoon, or their own ZBD-04A infantry fighting vehicle.

===Weapons===
====Individual and crew-served weapons====
The standard-issue rifle of PLA infantrymen is QBZ-95/191 chambered in proprietary 5.8×42mm, and the sidearm is QSZ-92 chambered in 5.8×21mm DAP92. Vehicle crews are equipped with QBZ-95B short-barreled carbine. The QCW-05 is a 5.8 mm submachine gun used by special forces and non-combat personnel. Sharpshooting is provided by the QBU-88/191 marksman rifle and QBU-141/202 sniper rifle. Indirect fire is provided by the QLG-10 grenade launcher. QBS-09 combat shotgun is issued for door breaching and close-quarters battle. The QJB-95 serves as the squad automatic weapon with its 75-round drum magazine.

PF-89, PF-97, and DZJ-08 disposable rocket launchers could be distributed on an ad hoc basis to infantry squads for direct-fire applications. Specialized fire support weapons, often equipped with dedicated rocketeers, or members of the firepower platoons, include the HJ-12 anti-tank guided missile, PF-98 rocket launcher, the QLZ-87 and QLZ-04 35 mm automatic grenade launcher, the QBU-10 anti-material rifle, QLU-11 sniper grenade launcher, QJG-02 anti-air machine gun, QJZ-89 heavy machine gun, and the PP-89/93 60 mm mortar.

====Infantry equipment and uniforms====

In 2014, the cost to equip a single Chinese soldier is about 9,400 yuan (US$1,523). The standard kit includes Type 07 camouflage uniforms, helmet, tactical vest, gas mask, backpack, first-aid kit, infantry weapons, woven belt, rain cap, camouflaged uniform, kettle, and combat boots. However, regular infantrymen rarely use the issued body armor stored in the armory. Prior to 2015, only deployed special operation detachments were equipped with body armor.

The infantry equipment such as heavy body armor, personal radio, and knee pads has been seen in the standard kit in 2015 when PLA are deployed into high-risk areas, as observed for units participating in UN Peacekeeping and counter-piracy operations. The PLA has started to procure body armors for soldiers on large scale since March 2020, with 1.4 million body armor on order, which includes 930,000 units of plates for universal bulletproof vests and 467,000 units of plates for an enhanced bulletproof vest.

The Type 19 uniform with new xingkong digital camouflage patterns, tactical vest, backpack, protective gear, and eyewear started to replace Type 07 uniform series since 2019. Along with the uniform, a new communication system, personal computer, tactical interface, and assault rifle family QBZ-191, new variants of the QSZ-92 pistol family, along with whole new sets of weapon systems are also being adopted by the PLAGF since 2019. These new upgrades are components of the new &quot;Integrated Soldier Combat System&quot;, a program aiming to overhaul the PLA&#x27;s infantry equipment.

===Transformation===
In 1987, the PLAGF, which relied upon obsolescent but serviceable equipment, were most anxious to improve defenses against armored vehicles and aircraft. Most equipments was produced from Soviet designs of the 1950s, but weapons were being incrementally upgraded, some with Western technology. One example of upgraded, Soviet-design equipment was the Type 69 MBT, an improved version of the Type 59 MBT, itself based on the Soviet T-54. The Type 69 had improved armor, a gun stabilizer, a fire control system including a laser rangefinder, infrared searchlights, and a 105 mm smooth-bore gun.

In 1987 the existence of a new, Type 80 MBT was revealed in the Western press. The tank had a new chassis, a 105 mm gun, and a fire control system. The PLA was believed to have atomic demolition munitions, and there were unconfirmed reports that it also had tactical nuclear weapons. In any case, nuclear bombs and missiles in the Chinese inventory could be used in a theater role.

The PLA had a scarcity of antitank guided missiles, tactical surface-to-air missiles, and electronics to improve communications, fire control, and sensors. China began production of the Soviet Sagger antitank missile in 1979 but lacked a more powerful, longer range, semiautomatic antitank guided missile. The PLA required a mobile surface-to-air missile and an infantry shoulder-fired missile for use against helicopters and certain other aircraft.

The PLAGF continue to undergo significant modernization and re-structuring to deal with potential threats and enhance their capabilities. Front line troops such as special forces, marines and paratroopers are given priority in receiving modern weapon systems and equipment. Other areas of improvement are its battlefield C4ISR capabilities, with the introduction of satellite communications, wireless networks, and digital radios, army commanders are now able to maintain constant communications with their front-line units while on the move. The bulk of the ground forces have been regularly asked to operate under severe electronic countermeasures conditions in exercises. Also a network-centric warfare capability connecting different combat, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance elements to form an integrated network is being developed.

===Equipment summary===
The PLAGF inventory maintains an array of military vehicles. All figures below are provided by the International Institute for Strategic Studies. Auxiliary vehicles such as engineering vehicles, logistics vehicles, reconnaissance vehicles, as well as antiquated and reserved equipment are not included.

== Relationship with other organizations ==


The People&#x27;s Liberation Army Ground Force maintains close relationships with several paramilitary organizations within China, primarily the People&#x27;s Armed Police (PAP) and the Militia (also known as the China Militia). Both of these paramilitary organisations act as a reserve force for the PLAGF during a time of national emergency such as war or natural disaster. The PAP consists of approximately 1.5 million personnel. Their primary mission during peacetime is internal security and counter-terrorism.

The Militia is a mass force engaged in daily production under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), and forms part of the Chinese armed forces. Under the command of the military organs, it undertakes such jobs as war preparation services, security and defense operation tasks and assistance in maintaining social order and public security. The Militia numbers some 3 million service men and women.

<text>Alice Letitia Milligan [&quot;pseud.&quot; Iris Olkyrn] (4 September 1865 – 13 April 1953) was an Irish writer and activist in Ireland&#x27;s Celtic Revival; an advocate for the political and cultural participation of women; and a Protestant-unionist convert to the cause of Irish independence. She was at the height of her renown at the turn of the 20th century when in Belfast, with Anna Johnston, she produced the political and literary monthly &quot;The Shan Van Vocht&quot; (1896–1899), and when in Dublin the Irish Literary Theatre&#x27;s performed &quot;The Last Feast of the Fianna” (1900), Milligan&#x27;s interpretation of Celtic legend as national drama.

==Early life and influences==
===Family and education===
Milligan was one of nine surviving children born to Charlotte Burns, a linen shop assistant, and Seaton Milligan, a commercial drapery salesman in a village outside Omagh, County Tyrone, in 1866. In 1879, promoted by his company to an executive position, her father moved the family to Belfast where Milligan was able to attend Methodist College, Belfast, an early pioneer of secondary mixed-sex education. Her first poems were published in the school magazine Eos.

Her father, a liberal unionist and well-known antiquarian, organized talks and lectures for the local workingmen&#x27;s institute and drew his daughter into discussion of history, international affairs and literature. Alice also acknowledged the influence of a family servant, Jane, who conveyed the spirit of her previous mistress Mary Ann McCracken (1770–1866). McCracken was the devoted sister of Henry Joy McCracken, the United Irish leader executed in the wake of the 1798 Rebellion and, to the end of her days in Belfast, an advocate for women and for the poor.

As a by-product of their participation together in the Belfast Naturalists&#x27; Field Club, Milligan and her father wrote an ethnographic travelogue of Ireland, &quot;Glimpses of Erin&quot; (1888). In the book her father offered that &quot;patriotism … far from being an irrational sentiment is entirely rational and desirable from a utilitarian point of view. It is as much so from a Christian standpoint. By living in our own land and doing our best to benefit it, we can best carry out the command &#x27;Do unto others as you would that they should do to you&#x27;&quot;.

===The Gaelic League===
After a year studying in English history and literature at King&#x27;s College, London, Milligan trained as a teacher and 1888 secured a position as a Latin instructor at the MacKillip&#x27;s Ladies Collegiate School in Derry. It is here that she first became interested in Irish, the once majority language that as a child she had heard spoken only by farm hands. In 1891 she took a further position in Dublin. Unable, until the formation in 1893 of the Gaelic League, to find any school or group to teach Irish, she took lessons privately, while reading Irish literature and history in the National Library.

Milligan&#x27;s command of Irish was never fluent, and on that basis Patrick Pearse was to object when, in 1904, the Gaelic League hired her as a travelling lecturer. With the help of costumed &quot;tableaux vivants&quot; evoking Irish historical or literary subjects (a skill she first acquired when commissioned to assist with the Irish exhibit at the 1893 Chicago World Fair), Milligan proved herself by establishing new branches throughout Ireland and raising funds along the way. In the north, in Ulster, she focused on the more difficult task of recruiting Protestants, working with, among other activists, League president Douglas Hyde, Ada McNeill, Roger Casement, Stephen Gwynn, and Seamus McManus.

==Political development ==
===&quot;A Royal Democrat&quot;===
In Dublin Milligan was witness both to the first stirrings of the Irish cultural renaissance and to the last act in the political career of Charles Stewart Parnell. In June 1891 she saw the beleaguered leader of Irish nationalism at a public meeting &quot;beaten and ashamed&quot; by the furore created by his being named in a divorce case (his affair with Kitty O&#x27;Shea). In the poem &quot;At Maynooth&quot; she scathingly contrasts the private life of George V, in 1911 rapturously received at the Catholic seminary by Cardinal Logue, to that of the man once hailed as Ireland&#x27;s &quot;uncrowned King&quot;.

Fascinated by Parnell and his non-denominational nationalism, Milligan followed his appearances across the city, sketching him as she went. This, she conceded, represented a sea-change in her political consciousness. Until then she described herself (despite her father&#x27;s relative liberalism) as still very much a product of a &quot;Tory and Protestant&quot; upbringing, blinded to the literature and history of her native land by her formal education. In May 1891 she noted in her diary: &quot;While in the tram going up O’Connell Street I turned into a Parnellite.&quot;

Writing as &quot;Iris Olkyrn&quot;, Milligan&#x27;s first novel, published the year before Parnell&#x27;s death in October 1891, &quot;A Royal Democrat&quot;, had been a neo-Jacobite tale of a future Prince of Wales who, born to an Irish mother, leads &quot;his&quot; people in the struggle for land rights and a restored Irish Parliament. Assuming of the defeat of the existing Irish Home Rule movement, and attempting too many reconciliations, it was not well received in the nationalist press.

===Commemorating 1798===

In 1893 Milligan returned to Belfast. She lived with Anna Johnston (later to write under the name, Ethna Carbery), the daughter of Robert Johnston, a leading member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood. Together with their next-door neighbour, the English-born suffragist Mary Ann Bulmer, they founded the Irish Women&#x27;s Association (IWA) in Belfast both to spread &quot;national ideas among the women&quot; and to sustain the city&#x27;s national and literary &quot;prestige&quot;. Branches were also established in Moneyreagh (where the Presbyterian minister, Richard Lyttle, convened the Gaelic League), and in Portadown. In 1895 Milligan started writing a regular column for the &quot;Irish Weekly Independent&quot; entitled &quot;Notes from the North&quot; to remind a Dublin readership of these and other contributions of women, and of the North, to the national cause.

Together with Johnston and Bulmer (and her son Bulmer Hobson, later also of the IRB), Milligan was drawn into the orbit of Francis Joseph Bigger. Bigger was a wealthy Presbyterian solicitor; like her father an avid antiquarian (he co-edited the journal of the Irish Folklore Society with Milligan&#x27;s sister Charlotte); and a celebrated host. To his house, &quot;Ard Righ&quot;, on the northern shore of Belfast Lough, Bigger attracted the poets and writers of the &quot;Northern Revival&quot; (among them Seumus McManus, Helen Waddell, Herbert Hughes, and Margaret Pender) as well other prominent &quot;culturati&quot;. It was at &quot;Ard Righ&quot; that Milligan first met, among the regular visitors, James Connolly, Roger Casement and W. B. Yeats. Walking with her on Cave Hill above &quot;Ard Righ&quot; (&quot;holy&quot; to Milligan as the site where Wolfe Tone and McCracken pledged themselves to Irish independence), Yeats disappointed Milligan. He failed “to warm to the least mention of &#x27;98&quot;. 

Milligan&#x27;s passion for the United Irishmen was shared by Bigger (he had a room in &quot;Ard Arigh&quot; dedicated to the rebellion). Together, Neal O&#x27;Boyle and Ethna Carbery, they sought to organise a Belfast commemoration of the 1798 centenary. Milligan produced a six-penny &quot;Life of Theobald Wolfe Tone&quot; (Belfast, 1898). However, the descendants of the &quot;Protestant leaders and peasants&quot; who, according to Milligan, had sealed Tone&#x27;s union of creeds on &quot;the battle field and scaffold&quot;, effectively restricted any commemorative display to Catholic districts. A processive outing (organised with help of Lyttle) to the grave of Betsy Gray, heroine of the Battle of Ballynahinch, ended in a fracas and the destruction by unionists of her memorial stone. Milligan&#x27;s emphasis upon Belfast&#x27;s republican past &quot;served to highlight just how different the city was at the end of the nineteenth century&quot;.

Meanwhile, attitudes on the nationalist side persuaded Milligan to launch (through the IWA) a separate Women&#x27;s Centenary Union. As a woman she found that she was being barred from Centenary meetings, and that these were being appropriated by local politicians to solicit Catholic votes. On April 6, 1897, she beseeched readers of &quot;The Shan Van Vocht&quot;: &quot;Is it too much to ask [...] that the women of Ireland, who are not asked to have any opinion whatever as to who shall have the right to speak for Ireland in the British Parliament, should form the Union which an historic occasion demands&quot;.

==&quot;The Shan Van Vocht&quot;==
===The two-penny journal===

&quot;The Shan Van Vocht&quot; (The &quot;Poor Old Woman&quot; in Irish, the metaphor for Ireland in a rebellion-era ballad) was produced by Milligan and Johnston in the offices of Robert Johnston&#x27;s timber yard (and often edited at &quot;Ard Righ&quot;). They had been editing the paper of another commemorative circle, the Henry Joy McCracken Literary Society, the &quot;Northern Patriot&quot;, but in December 1895 they were dismissed possibly because in three of their four issues they had supported amnesty for Fenian prisoners.

In a short period, the two-penny monthly achieved a wide circulation. As touring lecturers for the Irish Women&#x27;s Association, Milligan and Johnston promoted the magazine and the formation of reading circles. Agents were found in Dublin, Derry, Glasgow and New York. Within a year subscriptions were also coming in from the Irish diaspora in South Africa, Canada, Argentina and Australia. Maud Gonne, who described Milligan as &quot;small, aggressive and full of observant curiosity&quot;, said that she and her friends were &quot;full of almost envious admiration of some numbers of the &quot;Shan Van Vocht&quot;, a daring little paper&quot;.

The formula was similar to that which had launched the Gavan Duffy&#x27;s Young Ireland paper in the 1840s. Like The Nation, &quot;The Shan Van Vocht&quot; offered a mixture of poetry, serialised fiction, Irish history, political analysis and announcements.

The second issue (Belfast, February 1896) contained the following: &quot;America ... Oh mighty foster land&quot; (poem); &quot;The Captain’s Daughter&quot; (a serial written by Milligan under the name Iris Olkyrn); &quot;The Lonely One&quot; (poem); &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Fenian Movement of ‘67&quot; (serialised history); &quot;Manus O’Mallaghan and the Fairies&quot; (folklore); &quot;Irish Football Victory&quot;; &quot;On Inisheer’&quot; (poem); &quot;Willie Kane of the “Northern Star”, How He Escaped the Scaffold&quot; (United Irishman); &quot;Irishmen in the Transvaal&quot; (volunteers with the Boers against the British); &quot;The Burial-Place of the Sheares&quot; (United Irishmen); &quot;Our National Language&quot;; &quot;James Clarence Mangan&quot;; &quot;Reviews – The life of Owen Roe O&#x27;Neill (the rebel Ulster chieftain), The Life and Writings of Fintan Lalor&quot; (prophet of the Land War); &quot;Our Notebook’&quot; (diary and announcements); &quot;The Moonlighters Hound&quot; (poem); &quot;For the Old Land&quot; (review of different agencies advancing the national cause).

===Unity above creed and class===
The very first issue, January 1896, had given a platform to James Connolly: &quot;Socialism and Nationalism&quot;, his argument that without a creed capable of challenging the rule of the capitalist, landlord and financier, the nationalism of &quot;Irish Language movements, Literary Societies or Commemoration Committees&quot; would achieve little. Connolly was allowed further submissions, and Milligan published appreciative letters from readers. Yet while expressing &quot;full sympathy with Mr Connolly&#x27;s views on the labour and social questions&quot;, Milligan opposed the formation of his Irish Socialist Republican Party and refused their invitation to lecture.

Milligan&#x27;s editorials &quot;sidestepped&quot; Connolly&#x27;s proposal to link socialism and nationalism. Instead she took issue with the suggestion that the new party would seek election to Westminster. If successful, she believed that the ISRP would be led into &quot;an alliance with the English labour&quot; no less debilitating than the courtship of English Liberals had proved for the Irish Parliamentary Party. &quot;Freedom&#x27;s boon&quot; had to be won at home.

Milligan&#x27;s ideal remained United Irishmen&#x27;s appeal to nation above both creed and class. It suffused the journal&#x27;s literary features and, not least, her own particular genre of &quot;across-the-divide&quot; romances. Her serialised &quot;The Little Green Slippers&quot; &quot;melds patriotic and erotic desire&quot;. A young society woman in Protestant Belfast, forced in wake of the McCracken&#x27;s execution to attend a British Red-Coat ball, secures the devotion of own her beloved rebel, a country Catholic on the run, by scandalously wearing green slippers and black (mourning) crepe.

The Donegal writer Seumas MacManus wrote that &quot;The Shan Van Vocht&quot; &quot;revived Irish nationalism when it was perishing.&quot; Leading literary revivalist Padraic Colum credited &quot;a freshness that came from its femininity&quot; (Milligan and Johnston were joined as the leading contributors by Alice Furlong, Katherine Tynan, Margaret Pender and Nora Hopper) and a nationalism that was northern and never &quot;parliamentarian&quot;.

Despite the acclaim, the journal&#x27;s attempt to unify nationalists across region, class, sex and religion proved untenable: no faction or party was prepared to provide enough financial support to sustain it. In April 1899, Mark Ryan of the IRB persuaded Milligan and Johnston that after forty issues it was time to pass the project on. &quot;Shan Van Vocht&#x27;s&quot; subscription list was passed to Arthur Griffith and his new weekly, the &quot;United Irishman&quot;, organ of &quot;Cumann na nGaedheal&quot; the forerunner of Sinn Féin.

==Irish Republican==

Milligan&#x27;s &quot;romantic visions were of marching soldiers and green flags flying&quot;. What others regarded as revolutionary violence, the Fenian dynamite campaign of the 1880s, she rejected. In the October 1896 issue of &quot;Shan Van Vocht&quot;, she had condemned the use of dynamite methods:Those who would stoop to suggest, or organise, or carry out anything of the sort, degrade the name of their country, and in the eyes of the whole world render her less worthy of Nationhood. [...] Stern and terrible deeds are often done and may justly be done in such a strife as ours; but this method of bomb throwing and blowing up buildings, without aim or reason other than the mere desire for vengeance is imbecile and wrong.

This was not the light in which she saw the 1916 Easter Rising. Following close upon the death of her parents and her sister Charlotte (whom she had been nursing in London), the insurrection in Dublin, and the executions and loss of Connolly, Tomas MacDonagh and others she had known, affected her deeply. In London she visited Casement in detention. They had been together in Larne in April 1914 after unionists had run German guns through the port, a feat Casement told her nationalists would have to match. On August 3, 1916, she was holding vigil outside Pentonville Prison and heard the applause that signalled his execution. Back in Dublin, she contributed plays and poems to a fund-raising campaign for Irish political prisoners.

Milligan supported Sinn Féin in the 1918 general election, campaigning for the trade unionist and East Rising veteran Winifred Carney in Belfast. While aghast at the civil war that followed, she also sided with Éamon de Valera in rejecting the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty, refusing dominion status and Partition in lieu of the republic.

==Dramatist==
===Cultural activism===

While her parents were tolerant of her views, Milligan&#x27;s childhood community excluded her. At the same time she found that in nationalist circles her Protestant background could count against her. What won over many over was her undeniable role in the cultural revival. Milligan&#x27;s contemporary and fellow poet, Susan Langstaff Mitchell, wrote of her in 1919:In almost every one of the national and intellectual activities in Ireland now known to everyone – the Gaelic Revival, the dramatic movement, the literary renaissance – this indefatigable Irish girl was there at the start of them. She was lecturing for the Gaelic League all over Ireland, she was writing plays and staging them [...] and she was [repeating the judgement of editor and critic, George Russell]. the most successful producer of plays before the Abbey Theatre started on its triumphant way.

Comparing her to the Young Irelander Thomas Davis, in the &quot;Irish Review&quot; in September 1914 Tomas MacDonagh described Milligan as &quot;the most Irish of living poets and therefore the best&quot;. W.B. Yeats was less convinced. Not least because of the comparison with Davis&#x27;s heavy-laden patriotic verse, he advised her to stick to drama.

===“The Last Feast of the Fianna”===
From 1898, in short succession Milligan wrote eleven plays staged by Maud Gonne&#x27;s &quot;Inghinidhe na hÉireann&quot; (Daughters of Ireland), the Gaelic League and Irish Literary Theatre. In February 1901, the ILT performed “The Last Feast of the Fianna” in Dublin&#x27;s Gaiety Theatre. Depicting an episode in the Oisin legend, it was a Greek stage invocation of the twilight of pre-Christian Ireland.

The play&#x27;s lack of action and use of music (provided by her sister Charlotte) created moments of &quot;picturesque stillness&quot; on stage suggestive of the &quot;tableaux vivant&quot; which Milligan mounted on tour for the Gaelic League. At one such moment, John O&#x27;Leary, provided &quot;an extraordinary uniting of past and present, legendary and historical.&quot;. &quot;The Freeman&#x27;s Journal&quot; reported that the Fenian chief, veteran of the 1867 Rising, &quot;favoured the authoress by appearing [on stage] amongst the band of warriors [Fianna] feasting at the banquet board&quot;.

The reviewer of the Dublin edition of the &quot;Daily Express&quot; concluded that &quot;if the aim of the Irish Literary Theatre is to create a national drama&quot;, it was &quot;obvious&quot; that Miss Milligan&#x27;s method was &quot;the proper road&quot; to follow. Yeats, who was working with George Moore on a comparable project (&quot;Diarmuid and Grania&quot;), did allow that the play &quot;touched the heart as some greater drama on some foreign theme would not&quot;. But Augusta Gregory, with whom Yeats had established the ILT, was entirely dismissive. She found the language of the long soliloquies &quot;intolerable&quot; and the overall effect &quot;tawdry&quot;.

===National credo===
In 1905 the Cork National Players performed Milligan&#x27;s “The Daughter of Donagh”. The melodrama (which the ILT&#x27;s successor, the Abbey Theatre had rejected) is based on her unpublished 1893 novel, &quot;The Cromwellians&quot;. Characteristically for Milligan it combines the theme of Irish dispossession with a transgressive relationship: between a Cromwellian soldier and the daughter of the Irish family on which he has been quartered.

Milligan was unapologetic about the continuous nationalist thread in her writing. In 1893 she had written that Irish art could not exist &quot;in some quiet paradise apart&quot; but only &quot;within the noisy field of political warfare&quot;. Invoking the memory of Young Ireland, Milligan criticised those in the Literary Revival who &quot;proceeded on purely literary lines&quot; and &quot;lacked the national spirit that had fired the country in [18]48&quot;.

==Later years==

On the eve of the Great War Milligan was living in Dublin with her younger brother William and his family. They collaborated on two works of fiction, an Irish-Norse saga &quot;Sons of the Sea King&quot;. and &quot;The Dynamite Drummer&quot; (an American tourist comments on the grim determination of Ulster Protestants in opposing Home Rule &quot;not to rule themselves&quot;). With the outbreak of war, William volunteered and when discharged by the British Army suffered from what might today be recognised as Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Late in 1921 he received notice that, as a former British officer, he had 24 hours to quit Dublin or be shot. Who sanctioned the republican order was not established. Leaving her business, an Irish bookshop in Dawson Street, and all her possessions, Milligan fled with her brother first to Belfast and then to England.

Milligan and her brother returned to Tyrone in what was now Unionist-controlled Northern Ireland in the 1931. She lived with William, who had secured a minor civil-service position, his wife and paralysed son in the village of Drumragh outside Omagh. Her nephew, of whom she was very fond, died in 1934 aged only 26. William died three years later.

Hindered by the regular interception of mail, and obliged to report daily to a police barracks, Milligan described herself to Áine Ceannt as an &quot;interned prisoner&quot;. She spoke of the &quot;hostile&quot; &quot;un-Irish&quot; atmosphere of the North at Wexford&#x27;s commemoration of the United Irishmen in July 1938. That year she was the only woman signatory of a pamphlet issued by the Northern Council for Unity protesting Partition.

During the Second World War, after the death of her sister-in-law, Milligan went to live on a farm in County Antrim with her lifelong friend, Eleanor Boyd. Relieved of the burden of caring for sick family members she again wrote poems for the Nationalist press, including &quot;The Irish Press&quot; edited by her friend, M.J. MacManus. In 1941, the National University of Ireland granted her an honorary doctorate.

Alice Milligan died in Trichur, County Tyrone, on 13 April 1953, aged 87. She had ended her life in poverty. Her Unionist relatives, she explained to Bigger, were disinclined to give her a helping hand &quot;as they find that my political activities are constrained by financial embarrassment&quot;. Visiting her in the late 1940s, the Irish writer and broadcaster Benedict Kiely was saddened &quot;to think that to be poor, lonely and smoke-dried should be the lot of a poet at the end of it all&quot;.

In 1914, acknowledging Milligan as &quot;a northern Protestant woman who had denounced the unionist Anglo-centric doctrine of her upbringing&quot;, Tomas MacDonagh described hers as &quot;a cultural practice that gave voice to those (like herself) who were so often confined to the footnotes of colonial history&quot;.

==Commemoration==
During 2010/2011 Ulster History Circle mounted plaques for famous Ulster figures. Charlotte Milligan Fox and Alice Milligan have a plaque mounted on Omagh Library, 1 Spillar&#x27;s Place, Omagh, Co Tyrone.

<doc id="1289651" wikidata="Q3113035" url="?curid=1289651" title="Deputy Prime Minister of Spain">
<text>The deputy prime minister of Spain, officially vice president of the Government (), is the second in command to the Prime Minister, assuming the responsibilities of the premiership when the prime minister is absent or incapable of exercising power. 

The deputy prime minister is usually handpicked by the Prime Minister from the members of the Council of Ministers and appointed by the Monarch before whom they take an oath. The deputy prime minister may be the head of a government department, but it depends on the will of the prime minister, who may have a deputy premier without a portfolio.

When there are more than one deputy prime minister, this position is called First Deputy Prime Minister (). Since 2023, there are four deputy prime ministers; Nadia Calviño serves as first deputy prime minister since 12 July 2021 and as minister of Economy since 2018.

==History==
The office of Deputy Prime Minister, like the premiership, dates back to the 19th century. A Royal Decree of 1840 appointed Joaquín María Ferrer as &quot;Vice President of the Council of Ministers&quot;. However the office was not used again until 1925 when Miguel Primo de Rivera transitioned from a military to a civil government, reestablishing the Council of Ministers, the Presidency of the Council of Ministers and re-creating the Vice Presidency. The vice president&#x27;s function was to replace the president in cases of absence or illness. This vice-president, said article 3 of the Royal Decree, was appointed by the president from among the members of the Council of Ministers. The Vice Presidency was vested in the Under Secretary of the Interior, Severiano Martínez Anido, who combined the position with that of Interior Minister.

With the resignation of Primo de Rivera and the fall of the monarchy, the Second Republic was established in Spain, which did not initially consider a deputy prime minister necessary. However, in December 1933, Prime Minister Lerroux appointed Diego Martínez Barrio Vice President of the Council of Ministers, a position from which he resigned only three months later.

The Law of January 30, 1938, changed the title to &quot;Vice Presidency of the Government&quot; and, with the formation of the first Franco government, this position was granted to general Francisco Gómez-Jordana Sousa. From 1938 to 1981 the position was occupied by military officials, with the exception of the vice presidents Torcuato Fernández Miranda (1973-1973) and José García Hernández (1974-1975). Since 1981, with a democracy markedly established in society, Prime Minister Calvo-Sotelo appointed a civilian as Deputy, definitively separating the military power from the executive power, a situation that remains today.

== Responsibilities ==
As of 2024, the First Deputy Prime Minister responsibilities are:
* Advising the Prime Minister.
* To replace the Prime Minister in the cases of vacancy, absence or illness.
* The exercise of the responsibilities entrusted by the Prime Minister.
* To chair the Government Delegated Committee for Economic Affairs.

<doc id="1289662" wikidata="Q4793837" url="?curid=1289662" title="Arms-to-Iraq affair">
<text>The Arms-to-Iraq affair concerned the uncovering of the government-endorsed sale of arms by British companies to Iraq, then under the rule of Saddam Hussein. The scandal contributed to the growing dissatisfaction with the Conservative government of John Major and the atmosphere of sleaze that contributed to the electoral landslide for Tony Blair&#x27;s Labour Party at the 1997 general election. The whole affair also highlighted the weakness of the constitutional convention of individual ministerial accountability, leading to its codification as the Ministerial Code by the Blair Government.

Following the first Gulf War of 1991 there was interest in the extent to which British companies had been supplying Saddam Hussein&#x27;s administration with the materials to prosecute the war. Four directors of the British machine tools manufacturer Matrix Churchill were put on trial for supplying equipment and knowledge to Iraq, but in 1992 the trial collapsed, when it was revealed that the company had been advised by the government on how to sell arms to Iraq. Several of the directors were eventually paid compensation.

==Matrix Churchill==

Matrix Churchill was an engineering company based in Coventry, with expertise in both the design and manufacture of precision machine tools. Established in 1913 by Walter Tattler and his brother in law Sir Harry Harley, the company had its origins in gauge and tool manufacture, the original company being known as Walter Tattler Ltd.

In 1989, as the result of a debt settlement, it was acquired by &quot;Iraqi interests&quot; for nothing. New directors were appointed including two who worked for the Iraqi security services and the company began shipping components for Saddam Hussein&#x27;s secret weapons programme. According to the International Atomic Energy Authority, its products found in Iraq were among the highest quality of their kind in the world. They were &quot;dual use&quot; machines that could be used to manufacture weapons including artillery shells and parts for medium range missiles.

As one of the other directors claimed to have been working for the British intelligence services, the Ministry of Defence advised Matrix Churchill on how to apply for export licences of materials that could be used to make munitions in such a way that would not attract attention. When Alan Clark admitted under oath that he had been &quot;economical with the &quot;actualité&quot;&quot; in answering questions regarding what he knew about the policy on arms exports to Iraq, the trial collapsed and triggered the Scott Inquiry, which reported in 1996.

This case also raised the issue of public interest immunity, the process by which information believed to be highly sensitive is kept outside the public domain. In order to prevent information being public the relevant government minister must issue a public interest immunity certificate.

<doc id="1289663" wikidata="Q193965" url="?curid=1289663" title="Kamianets-Podilskyi">
<text>Kamianets-Podilskyi (, ) is a city on the Smotrych River in western Ukraine, to the north-east of Chernivtsi. Formerly the administrative center of Khmelnytskyi Oblast, the city is now the administrative center of Kamianets-Podilskyi Raion within the oblast. It hosts the administration of Kamianets-Podilskyi urban hromada. Population: 

Kamianets-Podilskyi is a historical center of Podolia region, serving as a capital of the Duchy of Podolia, Podolian Voivodeship, Podolia Eyalet, Podolia Governorate, and Podolian District. During the Ukrainian–Soviet War, the city officially served as the temporary capital of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic from 1919 to 1920.

==Name==

Originally known as Kamianec, its name was changed to the current following the partitions of Poland and occupation by the Russian Empire in 1795.

The first part of the city&#x27;s dual name originates from &#x27; () or &#x27;, meaning &#x27;stone&#x27; in Old Slavic. The second part of its name relates to the historic region of Podilia (), of which Kamianets-Podilskyi is considered to be the historic capital. Therefore, the town name literally means &#x27;&quot;The Stones of Podilia&quot;&#x27;.

Equivalents of the name in other languages are: ; ; ; ; ; ; ; English: Kamenets-Podolsk.

==Geography==
Kamianets-Podilskyi is located in the southern portion of the Khmelnytskyi Oblast, located in the western Ukrainian region of Podillia. The area where the city is located is part of the Podolian Upland which is notable for its elevated places known as Tovtry (see Podilski Tovtry National Nature Park) and creating a canyon-like relief feature.

The Smotrych River, a tributary of the Dniester, flows through the city. The total area of the city comprises . Among other notable neighboring cities, Kamianets-Podilskyi is located about from the oblast&#x27;s administrative center, Khmelnytskyi and across Dniester in southwestern direction from Chernivtsi, an administrative center of the neighboring Chernivtsi Oblast.

==History==
===Classical antiquity===
Several historians consider that a city on this spot was founded by the ancient Dacians, who lived in what is now modern Romania, Moldova, and portions of Ukraine. Historians write that the founders named the settlement &quot;Petridava&quot; or &quot;Klepidava&quot;, which originate from the Greek word &quot;petra&quot; or Latin &quot;lapis&quot; &#x27;stone&#x27; and Dacian &quot;dava&quot; &#x27;city&#x27;.

===Kyivan Rus and the Tatars (11th c.–1241)===
Modern Kamianets-Podilskyi was first mentioned in 1062, when it belonged to smaller principality of Terebovlia, then Halych principality and Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia, as a town of the Kyivan Rus&#x27; state. In 1241, it was destroyed by the Mongolian invaders.

===Polish rule (1352–1672)===

In 1352, it was inherited by the Polish King Casimir III. In 1374 the city was granted Magdeburg Law. In 1370, the Dominican monastic order began to function in Kamianets, a monastery was founded, and soon the Franciscans founded their own monastery in the city. Later, monks of other orders moved: Jesuits (1608), Discalced Carmelites (1623), Trinitarians (1699). In 1378 it became seat of a Roman Catholic Diocese. In 1432 King Sigismund I the Old granted Kamieniec Podolski city rights. It was an important royal city of Poland. In 1434 it became the capital of the Podolian Voivodship and the seat of local civil and military administration. The ancient castle was reconstructed and substantially expanded by the Polish kings to defend Poland from the southwest against Ottoman and Tatar invasions, thus it was called &quot;the gateway to Poland&quot;. In 1510, a peace treaty was signed in the city between Poland and the Principality of Moldavia.

During the free election period in Poland, Kamianets-Podilskyi, as one of the most influential cities of the state, enjoyed voting rights (alongside Warsaw, Kraków, Poznań, Gdańsk, Lwów, Wilno, Lublin, Toruń and Elbląg).

===Ottoman rule (1672–1699)===

After the Treaty of Buchach of 1672, Kamianets-Podilskyi was briefly part of the Ottoman Empire and capital of Podolya eyalet. It was also sanjak of pasha (central sanjak) of this eyalet with nahiyas of , Satanova, İskala, , Kırıvçe, (It was known as &quot;Ijvan&quot; during Ottoman rule) and Mıhaylov. To counter the Turkish threat to the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, King Jan III Sobieski built a fortress nearby, Okopy Świętej Trójcy (now Okopy, Ternopil Oblast; meaning &quot;the Entrenchments of the Holy Trinity&quot;). In 1674, local Armenians, who made up one of the main Armenian communes in Poland up to that point, were expelled by the Ottomans. Most, after about three years of exile in the Balkans, moved to the territories remaining within Poland, chiefly Lwów and Stanisławów.

In 1687, Poland attempted to regain control over Kamianets-Podilskyi and Podolia, when the fortress was unsuccessfully besieged by the Poles led by Prince James Louis Sobieski.

===Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (1699–1793)===
In 1699, the city was given back to Poland under King Augustus II the Strong according to the Treaty of Karlowitz. The fortress was continually enlarged and was regarded as the strongest in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The preserved ruins of the fortress still contain the iron cannonballs stuck in them from various sieges.
During this period, Bishop Dembowski, at the instigation of the Frankists, convened a public disputation at Kamieniec Podolski, in November 1757, and ordered all copies of the Talmud found in his bishopric to be confiscated and burned. Accounts of the Talmud burning differ—contemporary sources say that up to a thousand copies of the Talmud were destroyed, though other reports say only one copy was burned. Dembowski himself died days after the events. A plague broke out and the local priests exhumed his body and cut the head off to prevent any further disaster.

===Russian rule (1793–1915)===
After the Second Partition of Poland in 1793, the city belonged to the Russian Empire, where it was the capital of the Podolia Governorate. The Russian Tsar Peter the Great, who visited the fortress twice, was impressed by its fortifications. One of the towers was used as a prison cell for Ustym Karmeliuk, a prominent peasant rebel leader of the early 19th century, who managed to escape from it three times. In 1798, Polish nobleman Antoni Żmijewski founded a Polish theater in the city. It was one of the oldest Polish theaters. In 1867 the Roman Catholic Diocese of Kamianets-Podilskyi was abolished by the Russians authorities. It was re-established in 1918 by Pope Benedict XV.

According to the Russian census of 1897, Kamianets-Podilskyi remained the largest city of Podolia with a population of 35,934.

In 1906, the local society &quot;Prosvita&quot; was established in the city, thanks to its activities, the study of the Ukrainian language was introduced in primary and parish schools. On 1 July 1910, more than 48 percent of the city&#x27;s residents were Jews. The city was located in the settlement zone that the Russian Empire had set aside for Jews. In 1914, a direct railway line linked the city to Proskurov.

===World War I and Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic ===

During World War I, the city was occupied by Austria-Hungary in 1915.

After the collapse of the Russian Empire in 1917, the city was briefly controlled by the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic and the Hetmanate before ending up as part of the Ukrainian SSR when Ukraine fell under Bolshevik power. During the Directorate period, the city was chosen as de facto capital of Ukraine after the Russian communist forces occupied Kyiv.

During the Polish-Soviet War, the city was captured by the Polish Army on the night of 16–17 November 1919 and was under Polish administration from 16 November 1919, to 12 July 1920 as capital of the Podolian District.

In July 1920 battles between units of the Army of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic (UPR) and the Red Army took place in the village Veliki Zozulintsi and surrounding villages nearby Kamianets-Podilskyi. On 7 July 1920 soldiers of the 6th Reserve Rifle Brigade of the UPR Army were taken prisoner by the Bolsheviks. After refusing to join the Red Army, captured UPR soldiers were executed. In Veliki Zozulintsi a mass grave of 26 UPR soldiers is located.

===Soviet occupation (1921–1991)===
After the defeat of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic in the Ukrainian-Soviet war, the city was occupied by the Red Army. The area including Kamianets-Podilskyi was ceded to Soviet Ukraine in the 1921 Treaty of Riga, which determined its future for the next seven decades as part of the Ukrainian SSR.

Poles and Ukrainians have always dominated the city&#x27;s population. However, as a commercial center, Kamianets-Podilskyi has been a multiethnic and multi-religious city with substantial Jewish and Armenian minorities. Under Soviet rule it became subject to severe persecutions, and many Poles were forcibly deported to Central Asia. Massacres such as the Vinnytsia massacre have taken place throughout Podillya, the last resort of independent Ukraine. Early on, Kamianets-Podilskyi was the administrative center of the Ukrainian SSR&#x27;s &quot;Kamianets-Podilskyi Oblast&quot;, but the administrative center was later moved to Proskuriv (now Khmelnytskyi).

In December 1927, TIME Magazine reported that there were massive uprisings of peasants and factory workers in southern Ukraine, around the cities of Mohyliv-Podilskyi, Kamianets-Podilskyi, Tiraspol and others, against Soviet authorities. The magazine was intrigued when it found numerous reports from the neighboring Romania that troops from Moscow were sent to the region and suppressed the unrest, causing no less than 4,000 deaths. The magazine sent several of its reporters to confirm those occurrences which were completely denied by the official press naming them as &quot;barefaced lies&quot;. The revolt was caused by the collectivization campaign and the lawless environment in the cities caused by the Soviet government.

The Holodomor of 1932-1933, a terrible crime of the totalitarian system, did not escape the city. Although the situation was somewhat better than in other regions, this was largely due to the proximity of the border with the modern western Ukrainian territories. Given the border status of Kamianechchyna, the population, especially from the villages located on the Zbruch River, tried to move to the modern western regions. There, Podolians exchanged their belongings for bread and grain. There were many cases when people were hired for the opportunity to eat or worked for bread. However, not everyone was able to do this: along the border with Poland along the Zbruch River and the border with Romania along the Dniester River, barricading lines were set up in many places, and Soviet punitive bodies were guarding the borders. The situation was also difficult in the city, according to data in 1932-1933, 585 people died of hunger.

During the years of the Great Terror, namely 1937-1938, 9,009 people of various nationalities and professions were convicted in Kamianets-Podilskyi, 62 people were arrested on charges of espionage, and hundreds of people were evicted from the city by the families of &quot;enemies&quot;. people&quot;, for example 101 families of Polish nationality (see &quot;Polish Operation of the NKVD&quot;). For example, on the territory of the Roman Catholic Church of Archangel Michael, in the former monastery of the Dominican sisters, the Soviet authorities set up a prison, and in its dungeon - a torture chamber. In the 1930s, most of all, in 1937, people were shot in the basements of the monastery. According to some memories, for example, up to a hundred people were brought in a day. Twenty were sent to camps in the north, the rest disappeared. During this period, 11,634 Polish and German families, or at least 46,500 citizens, were evicted from Podillia.

====World War II====
Following the Soviet invasion of Poland at the start of World War II, the administrative center of the oblast was moved from the city of Kamianets-Podilskyi to the city of Khmelnytskyi.
Kamianets-Podilskyi was occupied by the German troops on 11 July 1941 in the course of Operation Barbarossa. German, Ukrainian, and Hungarian police massacred 23,000 Jews 27–28 August 1941.

On 26 March 1944, the town was occupated by the Red Army after German occupation in the battle of the Kamenets-Podolsky pocket. After the capture of the city by the Soviet army, the population&#x27;s disloyalty to the Soviet government was manifested not by a desire to continue the fight against the Nazis, but people were tired of the difficult periods of the German-Soviet war. But the Red Army launched active mobilization measures from the very first days of entering the city. Such measures significantly reduced the quality of the selection of conscripts, and also negatively affected the level of their training. The pernicious practice of their immediate use in hostilities began from the first days of mobilization, therefore a significant number of mobilized residents of Kamianets and local villages died in the subsequent phases of the Dnieper–Carpathian offensive in the territory of neighboring regions. Sending poorly trained, and most often poorly dressed and armed people into battle was more reminiscent of a cruel act of revenge for the disloyalty to the Stalinist government shown in 1941, for such units a conventional name appeared - «Chornopidzhachnyky». Thereafter Kamianets remained in Soviet Ukraine until the Dissolution of the Soviet Union.

Ukrainian Insurgent Army

A structural network of the OUN functioned on the territory of the city: Kamianets-Podilsky District, which belonged to the UPA-South. During the German occupation, Ukrainian national forces formed local self-government bodies: the regional administration, the regional department of education. Hryhoriy Kybets was appointed the head of the regional administration.

In January 1942, the Nazis began mass arrests and executions of people from Bandera in Kamianets-Podilskyi, more than 150 Ukrainian nationalists were shot.

In 1944-45, the 19th tactical division of the Kamianets UPA, the Lysonya military district, and the UPA-West military group operated on the territory of Kamianechchyna in 1944-45. The department was later divided into two parts in the summer of 1945. And self-defense bush units of the UPA from Ternopil Oblast also went on raids.

Soviet occupation after 1944
In 1986, the population of the city reached 100,000 people, according to this indicator, Kamianets moved from the category of medium to large cities.

On 16 October 1990, a rally was held in the city in support of the students of Kyiv, who announced a hunger strike as a sign of protest against the government&#x27;s policies. In the central square of the city, the demands of the students to the Verkhovna Rada of the Ukrainian SSR regarding the adoption of laws on local self-government and the non-signing of the Union Treaty, and to the City Council regarding the raising of the blue-yellow flag were approved. On 16 October the presidium of the city council satisfied the students&#x27; demand and was the first in Khmelnytskyi to raise the national flag.

=== Independent Ukraine ===

On 16 July 1990, the new Ukrainian parliament adopted a declaration of sovereignty.

In the future, many residents of the city gathered every day for vigils under the city council to express their protests against the regime and to support the Euromaidan in Kyiv. The largest rally in terms of numbers took place on 26 January 2014, about 2,000 people took part in it.

, Kamianets-Podilskyi was the third-largest city of Podolia after Vinnytsia and Khmelnytskyi. In 2015, the city center completed the construction of the European Square, where the flags of the European Union countries fly, according to officials, this will be a confirmation of the European choice of the city and Ukraine.

Until 18 July 2020, Kamianets-Podilskyi was incorporated as a city of oblast significance and served as the administrative center of Kamianets-Podilskyi Raion though it did not belong to the raion. In July 2020, as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Khmelnytskyi Oblast to three, the city of Kamianets-Podilskyi was merged into Kamianets-Podilskyi Raion.

===Jewish history===
During the Khmelnytsky Uprising (1648–58), the Jewish community of Kamianets-Podilskyi suffered much from Khmelnytsky&#x27;s Cossacks on the one hand, and from the attacks of the Crimean Tatars (their main object being the extortion of ransoms) on the other.


About the middle of the 18th century, Kamianets-Podilskyi became celebrated as the center of the furious conflict then raging between the Talmudic Jews and the Frankists. The city was the residence of Bishop Dembowski, who sided with the Frankists and ordered the public burning of the Talmud, a sentence which was carried into effect in the public streets in 1757.

Kamianets-Podilskyi was also the residence of the wealthy Joseph Yozel Günzburg. During the latter half of the 19th century, many Jews from Kamianets-Podilskyi emigrated to the United States, especially to New York City, where they organized a number of societies.

One of the first and largest Holocaust massacres carried out in the opening stages of war between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, took place in Kamianets-Podilskyi on 27–28 August 1941. The killings were conducted by the Police Battalion 320 of the Order Police along with Friedrich Jeckeln&#x27;s &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot;, the Hungarian soldiers, and the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police. According to Nazi German reports, in two days a total of 23,600 Jews from the Kamianets-Podilskyi Ghetto were murdered, including 16,000 expellees from Hungary. As the historians of the Holocaust point out, the massacre constituted a prelude to the Final Solution conceived by the Nazis at Wannsee several months later. Eyewitnesses reported that the perpetrators made no effort to hide their deeds from the local population.

<text>The second deputy prime minister of Spain, officially Second Vice President of the Government of Spain (), is a senior member of the Government of Spain. The office of the Second Deputy Prime Minister is defined in the Constitution but is not a permanent position, existing only at the discretion of the Prime Minister.

The current second deputy prime minister is Yolanda Díaz, who is also minister of Labour and Social Economy.

== History ==
The office was established by the Organic Act of the State of 1967 which allowed for the creation of a Council of Ministers composed of the Prime Minister, one or more Deputy Prime Ministers and the Ministers. However, it was not until 1974, one year after the dictator Francisco Franco split the office of head of government (prime minister) and head of state, that prime minister Arias Navarro appointed Antonio Barrera Irimo, Minister of Finance as second deputy prime minister.

In Arias Navarro&#x27;s second term, the Finance Minister Rafael Cabello de Alba was also appointed second deputy prime minister in October 1974. During his third term, Arias Navarro appointed Minister of the Interior Manuel Fraga as second deputy prime minister.

Prime minister 
Adolfo Suárez appointed his Interior Minister, Alfonso Osorio García and Minister of the Presidency as second deputy prime minister. From 1977 to 1981, Suárez appointed his Finance Ministers as Second Deputies and during his short term, Calvo-Sotelo did the same.

Socialist PM González never appointed a second deputy prime minister during his almost 14 years of premiership. José María Aznar and José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero however followed the previous pattern of appointing their Finance Minister as second deputy prime minister. However, a cabinet reshuffle in 2011 appointed the Minister of Territorial Policy and Civil Service, Manuel Chaves as second deputy prime minister.

The conservative PM Mariano Rajoy did not appoint a second deputy prime minister. The subsequent prime minister Pedro Sánchez did not appoint in second deputy prime minister in his first government, but he did in his second term. In March 2021, after the resignation of Pablo Iglesias as second deputy prime minister, the tradition of appointing a minister of economic affairs as second deputy PM was resumed. In July 2021, Labour and Social Economy Minister Yolanda Díaz was appointed as second deputy PM.

==Powers==
The office of second deputy prime minister does not possess special constitutional powers beyond its responsibility as a member of the Council of Ministers. The position is regulated in the Government Act of 1997 and it only specifies that the raison d&#x27;être of the office is to replace the Prime Minister when the office is vacant, or the premier is absent or ill. The second deputy prime minister only assumes this responsibility if the first deputy is unable to fill the role.

<text>USS &quot;Drayton&quot; (DD-23) was a in the United States Navy. She was the first ship named for Captain Percival Drayton.

&quot;Drayton&quot; was launched on 22 August 1910 by Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine, sponsored by Miss E. G. Drayton, niece of Captain Drayton, and commissioned on 29 October 1910.

==Service history==

===Pre-World War I===
&quot;Drayton&quot; arrived at Key West, Florida on 21 December 1910, to cruise in Cuban waters and on the east coast in exercises and development problems. She sailed from Key West on 9 April 1914 to serve on blockade duty off Mexico and take refugees out of the troubled areas, returning to New York on 1 June, and to Newport on 1 August.

===World War I===
&quot;Drayton&quot; served on neutrality patrol and conducted torpedo and gunnery exercises out of Newport, Rhode Island and in the Caribbean. Calling at Jacksonville, Florida from 5–11 April 1917, she took over the German steamer &quot;Frieda Leonhardt&quot; and interned her crew in accordance with a Presidential proclamation issued upon American entry into World War I. &quot;Drayton&quot; arrived at Norfolk, Virginia on 12 April, and the next day reported for duty with the Patrol Force off the east coast serving until 4 May, when she entered Boston Navy Yard to fit out for distant service.

&quot;Drayton&quot; departed Boston, Massachusetts on 21 May, and sailed by way of St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland to Queenstown, Ireland, arriving on 1 June. She patrolled along the coast of Ireland, escorting both inbound and outbound ships. On 20 June, she searched for the submarine which had torpedoed , then rescued 42 survivors who were landed at Bantry Ireland. From 26 June-4 July, she escorted a transport convoy to St. Nazaire and took part in a submarine hunt with two French cruisers. On 15 December, with , she picked up the survivors of , 39 in all.

Transferred to Brest and United States Naval Forces Operating in European Waters, &quot;Drayton&quot; left Queenstown on 15 February 1918. She continued her escort and antisubmarine operations out of this port until 16 December, when she sailed for the United States, arriving at Boston on 2 January 1919 for overhaul. &quot;Drayton&quot; cruised along the east coast on various exercises and maneuvers until 18 July, when she reported to Philadelphia Navy Yard in company with seven other destroyers destined for decommissioning.

&quot;Drayton&quot; was decommissioned on 17 November. On 1 July 1933, her name was dropped and she was known as DD-23 until sold on 28 June 1935.

<doc id="1289700" wikidata="Q3439048" url="?curid=1289700" title="Cleland, North Lanarkshire">
<text>Cleland is a village near Motherwell and Wishaw in North Lanarkshire, Scotland, . As of 2018, it has a population of about 3,000. The village has a strong coal mining heritage, and is a typical example of a working class village in North Lanarkshire and the Glasgow area. Due to its location, despite being at the heart of North Lanarkshire, the village is isolated, geographically and culturally, from surrounding towns such as Motherwell, Shotts and Wishaw. 

==Geography==
The village is about from Edinburgh and from Glasgow by train.
Geographically, the village of Cleland is roughly bounded by the junction of Cleland Road and Chapleknowe road (B7029) to the west, the junction of Biggar Road and the B7033 Newhouse to the North, the junction of Bellside Road and Carlisle Road (A73) to the East and the junction of Swinstie road and Wishaw high road to the south.

==Schools==
Cleland is served by two primary schools. St. Mary&#x27;s is the larger of the two schools with a roll of around 140 (excluding nursery), compared with Cleland Primary&#x27;s roll of around 90. St Mary&#x27;s Primary School also includes the nursery which is non-denominational. 

The two secondary schools which serve the community are Taylor High School in New Stevenston, and Coltness High School near Wishaw.

==Transport==
Cleland is situated in close proximity to the M8 motorway, offering road connections to Glasgow and Edinburgh, between and beyond. It is from the M74 motorway, offering road connections to England and the M6 motorway.

Cleland railway station is situated on Bellside Road and is a stop on the Glasgow - Edinburgh via Shotts Line. It is around a 30-minute journey to Glasgow and an hour to Edinburgh. The trains run every day with a limited service on Sundays.

Several bus services operate into Glasgow, Wishaw, Motherwell and the surrounding areas.

==Governance==
Cleland is in the Scottish parliamentary constituency of Motherwell and Wishaw, in the Scottish Parliament Region of Central Scotland. The current Member of the Scottish Parliament is Clare Adamson of the Scottish National Party.

Cleland&#x27;s is also in the UK Parliament constituency of Motherwell and Wishaw, and is represented by Marion Fellows of the Scottish National Party.

Cleland falls under Ward 20 Murdostoun of North Lanarkshire Council. The current representation is 2 Labour, 1 SNP and 1 Independent. Louise Roarty of the Scottish Labour Party received the most first preferences votes in Cleland in the 2017 and 2022 Local Elections.

==History==
The first Cleland on record is Alexander Cleland who married a cousin of Sir William Wallace. Their son, James Cleland joined William Wallace in battle in 1296 at Loudonhill; at Stirling in 1297; Falkirk in 1298; Glasgow in 1300; and in France in 1301. James Cleland and his son John Cleland fought at Bannockburn in 1314. For his loyalty and good service, Robert the Bruce gave James Cleland the lands of Calder-clere, now East Calder. The Cleland line later extends down to James Cleland, son of William Cleland of that Ilk. James married a daughter of Lord Somerville in 1450, and their line branches out to be the Clelands of Faskin, Monkland and Gartness. The Cleland family lands were therefore a number of areas which included the present day Cleland village. There was no defined village of Cleland as it is known today. Rather there was a Cleland House where the Cleland family lived, and the land where present day Cleland stands was part of the Cleland family&#x27;s estate.

In 1596 Timothy Pont produced a map of Scotland, showing what is now Lanarkshire, with the places of Kneelandtou and Kneelandtounhead. Kneeland is an archaic alternative name for the Cleland family surname. Over time, Kneeland would eventually become Cleland (and Cleland used to be pronounced as Clee-land in the same way as Knee-land).

The united Presbytery of Hamilton and Lanarkshire had its first meeting at Cleland on 6 September 1687.

In 1702 Alexander Cleland of Cleland found himself in debt and sold the Cleland Estate to William and Archibald Hamilton, who in turn sold to Gavin Hamilton of Inverdovat in 1711. The link between the Cleland families and the Cleland lands was therefore broken. The sale of the Estate was described as follows:

General Roy&#x27;s military map of 1755 shows Cleland.

By 1763 the first colliery in what is present day Cleland was in operation at Swinstie, and three years later Alexander Inglis Hamilton of Murdostoun sells Cleland Estate to Captain Hew Dalrymple of Fordal. In 1789 Colonel William Dalrymple (the second son of Sir William Dalrymple, third baronet of Cousland, and the nephew of Captain Hew Dalrymple), distinguishes himself by helping to capture both the Fort of San Fernando de Omoa and the port town of Omoa, in Honduras, Central America. On returning to civilian life Colonel Dalrymple established the Omoa Iron Works on Cleland estate. At first there was only one furnace at Omoa, employing about 40 miners, 40 smelters and other workmen, and 12 horses. The furnace consumed nine tons of calcined ironstone per day, with casts every eighteen hours, yielding about two tons of pig-iron each cast. Omoa claimed to be the second oldest iron works in Scotland (after Wilsontown). The Omoa Waggonway was opened in 1813 from Newarthill collieries to Omoa Iron Works by Colonel Dalrymple. The Omoa Works initially prospered enough to create the new community of Omoa Town.

The procurement of ironstone for the Iron Works was reported as follows:

Omoa Works changed proprietors several times, the last being to Robert Stewart, Esq., of Murdoston. Stewart reconstructed the works, and acquired a lease to an extensive mineral field, which was found to contain an excellent seam of blackband ironstone, he in the course of a few years acquired a considerable fortune, to which after years of great success were to make great additions. He became a member of Glasgow Town Council in 1842, becoming Lord Provost, 1848–1854, and drove the initiative to supply Glasgow with a freshwater supply from Loch Katrine. In 1856 Mr. Stewart acquired from Mr. Baillie Cochrane, now Lord Lamington, at a cost of £55,000, the estate of Murdostoun, situated in the parish of Shotts, and immediately began to improve it upon an extensive scale. The Omoa Works suffered a downturn through a slump in trade following the outbreak of Civil War in America in 1861. Two years after the death of Robert Stewart in 1866, operations ceased, with the furnaces eventually becoming ruins. Collieries around the present village included Knowenoble, Greenhill, Windyedge, and Spindleside, extracting thick-bedded coals and black-band ironstone

The Coltness Iron Company was established in Newmains by Henry Houldsworth in 1837. It was estimated that the site at Newmains could produce 18,000 tons of coal and 1,000 tons of ironstone per acre. Henry Houldsworth had no difficulty, therefore, in attracting experienced labour from the iron works of Yorkshire as well as from Omoa and Wilsontown in Lanarkshire. The Iron Company, needing coal, was also aware of the coal mines in Ireland. When coal was being mined in Shotts, Cleland and the surrounding areas, the Iron Company sent representatives over to Ireland to hire miners for the Scottish mines. This is a primary reason why so many Irish families came to the area. Many came from County Donegal, and the Castlecomer coal fields in what is now north County Kilkenny and south County Laois. The population of Omoa and Cleland was recorded as 1,233 in 1861: Cleland had 190 males and 175 females; Omoa had 509 males and 359 females.

In 1869 the Omoa and Midcalder Line (Caledonian Railway) was opened. The Omoa and Midcalder Line (Caledonian Railway) to Addiewell followed in 1882. Cleland was served with two railway stations. The first was Omoa Station (across from what is now Cleland Hospital), and the second was Cleland Station (behind what is now Cleland Cross). After Cleland Station was closed, Omoa Station was then renamed Cleland Station.A list of mines under Holytown in this year includes Cleland Collieries owned by Wm. Dixon, Monkland Iron Co., Trustees of late Robert Stewart; Wyndedge owned by Robert Dick. The Omoa Fireclay Works, a brickworks, opened in 1870.

In 1871 the population of Cleland and Omoa had fallen to 819, but by 1881 it was 1,626. The Cleland and Omoa Public School opened in 1876, and in 1877 St Mary&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church, a Free Church, and a Chapel of Ease were all established.

In 1885 the &quot;Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland&quot; recorded:

As the Gazetteer suggests, Omoa and Cleland were separate villages, and parts of Omoa and Cleland villages came under the District of West Shotts, and the remainder came under the District of Bothwell. However, both were within the Parish of Cleland.

Further industrial ventures included the Omoa Greenhill Works brickworks (1889-1915), and the Cleland Pottery (1895–1911), the latter across the small gorge from Lithgow Drive. An inspection report for 1896 records the following coal mines in Cleland and Omoa: 
*Beggarford, Omoa owned by Robert Young&#x27;s Trustees, Greenhill, by Holytown; 
*Brownhill, Cleland owned by Barr and Higgins, 75, Bothwell St., Glasgow; 
*Greenhill, Omoa owned by Robert Young&#x27;s Trustees, Greenhill, by Holytown; 
*Hareshaw, Omoa owned by Hareshaw Coal Co., Cleland;

Cleland Poorhouse opened in 1905. Cleland streets were named and houses numbered in 1906. When built, Lithgow Drive was named after Dr Lithgow, and Gibb Street was named after the mid-wife Mrs Gibb, who both served Omoa and Cleland.

The Annual Report of the County &amp; District Medical Officer for Lanarkshire, 1910, describes Omoa Square:

&quot;The Housing Condition of Miners&quot; Report by the Medical Officer of Health, Dr John T. Wilson, 1910, summarises the Square as:

By 1910, the Square&#x27;s houses were semi-abandoned and considered not properly fit for human habitation, with a recommendation for demolition. In the 1920s, hardship led to many Cleland families leaving for other mining areas or emigrating to America and Canada. In 1930 a police census records a population of 4,274, made up of 2,240 males and 2,030 females, though this shows a reduction of 552 compared with the census taken in 1928. In 1930 the Wishaw and Coltness Railway was closed to freight between Newmains and Cleland Junction, and to passengers between Morningside and Holytown (Cleland Junction). What is now Cleland Station collapsed, due to a local mine running under it caving in. It required major repairs before re-opening.

In 1934 Cleland War Memorial was erected after public subscription, to the memory of the men of Cleland and District who fell in the Great War 1914–1918. Electricity was supplied to Cleland in 1934–35. Cleland Public Park opened to celebrate the Silver Jubilee of King George V in May 1935. Further railway closures included the Airdrie and Newhouse Line (Caledonian Railway) Chapelhall to Bellside (1966), and the Cleland (previously Omoa) and Midcalder Line (Caledonian Railway) Polkemmet Colliery line, which was lifted in 1986.

<text>Nizatidine is a histamine H2 receptor antagonist that inhibits stomach acid production, and is commonly used in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease and gastroesophageal reflux disease.
It was patented in 1980 and approved for medical use in 1988. It was developed by Eli Lilly.

==Medical use==

Nizatidine is used to treat duodenal ulcers, gastric ulcers, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD/GORD), and to prevent stress ulcers.

==Adverse effects==
Side effects are uncommon, usually minor, and include diarrhea, constipation, fatigue, drowsiness, headache, and muscle aches.

==History and development==
Nizatidine was developed by Eli Lilly, and was first marketed in 1988. It is considered to be equipotent with ranitidine and differs by the substitution of a thiazole ring in place of the furan ring in ranitidine. In September 2000, Eli Lilly announced they would sell the sales and marketing rights for Axid to Reliant Pharmaceuticals. Subsequently, Reliant developed the oral solution of Axid, marketing this in 2004, after gaining approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, a year later, they sold rights of the Axid Oral Solution (including the issued patent protecting the product) to Braintree Laboratories.

<doc id="1289703" wikidata="Q15515020" url="?curid=1289703" title="Max Merritt">
<text>Maxwell James Merritt (30 April 1941 – 24 September 2020) was a New Zealand-born singer-songwriter and guitarist who was renowned as an interpreter of soul music and R&amp;B. As leader of Max Merritt &amp; The Meteors, his best known hits are &quot;Slippin&#x27; Away&quot;, which reached No. 2 on the 1976 Australian singles charts, and &quot;Hey, Western Union Man&quot; which reached No. 13. Merritt rose to prominence in New Zealand from 1958 and relocated to Sydney, Australia, in December 1964. Merritt was acknowledged as one of the best local performers of the 1960s and 1970s and his influence did much to popularise soul music / R&amp;B and rock in New Zealand and Australia.

Merritt was a venerable pioneer of rock in Australasia who produced crowd-pleasing shows for over 50 years. He engendered respect and affection over generations of performers. This was evident at the 2007 &quot;Concert for Max&quot; which was organised to provide financial support for him after it was announced he had Goodpasture&#x27;s syndrome, a rare autoimmune disease. The Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) recognised Merritt&#x27;s iconic status on 1 July 2008 when he was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame. In 2020, Merritt was inducted into the New Zealand Music Hall of Fame.

==Biography==
===1956–1962: Early career in Christchurch===
Born in Christchurch, New Zealand, Merritt was interested in music from an early age and started guitar lessons at 12. By 1955 he encountered the rock and roll of Bill Haley and Elvis Presley. After leaving school in 1956, aged 15, Merritt formed the Meteors with friends Ross Clancy (sax), Peter Patonai (piano), Ian Glass (bass) and Pete Sowden (drums). Initially a part-time group, they played dances and local charity concerts, Merritt continuing his day job as an apprentice bricklayer in his father&#x27;s business. When his parents, together with local Odeon theatre manager Trevor King, developed the Christchurch Railway Hall into a music venue, The Teenage Club, they hired Merritt and the Meteors. The Teenage Club drew hundreds of locals and increased their popularity in the city when most businesses and public venues closed until late on Sunday afternoon.

Clancy was replaced by Willi Schneider during 1958, the band released their debut single, &quot;Get a Haircut&quot;, in June on HMV Records. By 1959, the Meteors had become a top youth attraction, regularly pulling crowds of 500 or more. Merritt borrowed players from other bands if a Meteors&#x27; member was unavailable, one such band was Ray Columbus &amp; the Invaders fronted by vocalist Columbus. From this band Merritt recruited guitarist Dave Russell and bass guitarist / keyboardist Billy Karaitiana (a.k.a. Billy Kristian). In January 1959, New Zealand&#x27;s top rocker, Johnny Devlin, played in Christchurch. Devlin later saw Merritt at a &quot;Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Roll Jamboree&quot; charity concert where Devlin&#x27;s manager Graham Dent was impressed enough to praise their performance to Auckland promoter Harry M. Miller. Miller added the Meteors to Australian rocker Johnny O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s 1959 tour of New Zealand.

Christchurch had been chosen as the site for a United States paramilitary base to access Antarctica. Code-named &quot;Operation Deep Freeze&quot;, it had the only airfield large enough to handle the huge transport planes. The US presence provided a greater influence of rock and roll music – young servicemen discovered The Teenage Club and the gravel-voiced young Kiwi singer, Merritt. More rock and roll and R&amp;B records entered local jukeboxes and were on radio. From their US connections, both the Meteors and the Invaders were able to equip themselves with Fender guitars and basses, which were still rare in Australia and the UK due to import restrictions. By 1959 the line-up for the Meteors had become Rod Gibson (saxophone), Ian Glass (bass guitar), Bernie Jones (drums) and Billy Kristian (piano). Early in 1960, HMV released their debut album, &quot;C&#x27;mon Let&#x27;s Go&quot;. Follow up singles were &quot;Kiss Curl&quot; and &quot;C&#x27;Mon Let&#x27;s Go&quot; in 1960 and &quot;Mr Loneliness&quot; in 1961. They had local support but were almost unknown beyond the South Island. In an effort to break into the more lucrative North Island market, both Max Merritt &amp; The Meteors and Ray Columbus &amp; the Invaders relocated to Auckland in November 1962.

===1963–1964: Auckland and Invaders &amp; Max Merritt&#x27;s Meteors===
After reaching Auckland, Merritt&#x27;s band became the second most popular band in New Zealand behind the Invaders which played a beat pop style while the Meteors tackled rock and roll, soul and R&amp;B. Max Merrit &amp; The Meteors backed Dinah Lee on recordings. Her best known single, &quot;Reet Petite&quot;, from September 1964 reached No. 1 on the New Zealand charts and No. 6 in Melbourne, Australia. The Meteors&#x27; line-up of Merritt, Peter Williams (guitar), Teddy Toi (bass) and Johnny Dick (drums) recorded material for their second album, &quot;Max Merritt&#x27;s Meteors&quot;. They relocated to Sydney in December 1964.

===1965–1967: Sydney and &quot;Shake&quot; ===
In Sydney, the Meteors made their first Australian television appearance on Johnny O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s &quot;Sing Sing Sing&quot;. By April 1965, the second Meteors&#x27; album was finally released on RCA Records and contained a range of styles, including the single &quot;So Long Babe&quot;. Other singles followed but Toi and Dick left to join Billy Thorpe &amp; The Aztecs and were eventually replaced by former member Kristian on bass and Bruno Lawrence on drums. During February 1966, visiting UK acts the Rolling Stones and the Searchers were supported on tour by Max Merritt and The Meteors. After a cruise ship gig to New Zealand (during which Lawrence abruptly left the group), Merritt heard Otis Redding&#x27;s version of &quot;Try a Little Tenderness&quot; and recorded his own cover in 1967. Turmoil within the Meteors saw a rapid turnover of members and by May, Merritt with Bob Bertles on saxophone, Stewart &quot;Stewie&quot; Speer on drums and John &quot;Yuk&quot; Harrison on bass guitar, decided to relocate to Melbourne.

===1967–1971: Melbourne and &quot;Max Merritt and the Meteors&quot;===
In Melbourne, Merritt and his band initially found it difficult obtaining regular gigs and so travelled widely through the state. On 24 June 1967 the van they were travelling in to Morwell collided head-on with a car near Bunyip, Bertles suffered a broken leg, Speer had both legs crushed, broke both arms and lost the tops off several fingers. Merrit lost his right eye and had his face scarred. It took the band nearly a year to recover. By July 1968 they competed in Hoadley&#x27;s Battle of the Sounds, finishing behind winners the Groove, the Masters Apprentices and Doug Parkinson.

In 1969 the group were re-signed by RCA and they released their first single for over two years, a cover of Jerry Butler&#x27;s &quot;Hey, Western Union Man&quot;, which reached No. 13 on the Australian singles charts. In early 1970 their third album, &quot;Max Merritt and the Meteors&quot;, was released with six original tracks and five covers. It reached No. 8 on the national albums chart. Dave Russell (ex-Ray Columbus &amp; the Invaders) replaced Harrison on bass and Merritt&#x27;s band were asked by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) to provide a four-part TV series called &quot;Max Merritt and the Meteors in Concert&quot;. In late 1970 they released &quot;Stray Cats&quot; and followed with the singles &quot;Good Feelin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Hello LA, Bye Bye Birmingham&quot; in 1971 and &quot;Let it Slide&quot; in 1972. Neither the album nor the singles charted well. By that time, Merritt had relocated again – this time to England.

===1971–1976: United Kingdom===
In London from early 1971, the group played the UK pub circuit, initially with little success but their popularity slowly grew and they supported Slade and the Moody Blues on their tours. In 1974, however, the Meteors fell apart again, leaving Merritt and Speer to recruit John Gourd on guitar, slide guitar and piano; Howard Deniz on bass and Barry Duggan on sax and flute. This line-up were signed by US-based Arista Records for their newly established UK label and released &quot;A Little Easier&quot; with the title single &quot;A Little Easier&quot; in 1975. &quot;Slippin&#x27; Away&quot; was their second single from the album and captured the attention of radio listeners in both Australia and New Zealand, reaching No. 2 in Australia and No. 5 in New Zealand. Their best performed single drove the sales of &quot;A Little Easier&quot; which reached No. 4 on the Australian album charts. Another album, &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; (No. 13, 1976), was released with a renewed version of &quot;Let it Slide&quot; (No. 29) as a single in Australia. During this time the group played regular gigs at the White Hart in Willesden Green, the Nashville Rooms in West Kensington, the Windsor Castle on the Harrow Road and in 1976 played a memorable gig at Alexandra Palace where Merritt got to the gig on the day after travelling back from New Zealand to visit his dying mother, who died while he was en route. By 1977, with the advent of punk rock the band&#x27;s popularity on the UK pub circuit had declined and they effectively disbanded. Merritt then relocated to the US.

===1977–1999: Based in United States===
Merritt relocated to Nashville, Tennessee, in 1977 and signed as a solo artist with Polydor Records, which released &quot;Keeping in Touch&quot; in 1979. He then moved to Los Angeles, where he continued to reside. He toured Australia in 1979 and 1980. On the second tour he put together a band with Stewie Speer on drums, Paul Grant on guitar, John Williams on keyboards, Martin Jenner on guitar and Phil Lawson on bass. This was Merritt and Speer&#x27;s last major tour together: Speer died of a heart attack on 16 September 1986. Merritt released singles &quot;Growing Pains&quot; in 1982 and &quot;Mean Green Fighting Machine&quot; in 1986, the second was a promotional single for the Canberra Raiders Rugby League team. He toured Australia in 1991 with Brian Cadd (ex-The Groop, Axiom, solo) in the Brian Cadd and Max Merritt Band, which comprised Merritt, Cadd (vocals, piano), John Dallimore (guitar; ex-Redhouse, Dallimore, Jon English Band), Craig Reeves (keyboards), Des Scott (bass) and Dave Stewart (drums; ex-Daniel). In late 1996, Merritt returned to Australia to tour the club and pub circuit.

=== 2000–2020: Resurgence and death ===
Merritt toured Australia on a short club circuit in April 2001 along with Doug Parkinson, a fellow veteran rocker from the 1960s. This marked a resurgence of interest for Merritt and April and May were spent touring Australia under the banner &quot;The Heart &amp; Soul of Rock &amp; Roll&quot; with Parkinson; August and September 2002 was the &quot;Long Way To The Top&quot; concert tour. After that, whenever Merritt returned to Australia, a reformed Max Merritt &amp; The Meteors were in demand for special events and music festivals such as the Melbourne Music &amp; Blues Festival, the Perth Moonlight Festival, the Veterans Games in Alice Springs, the Queenscliff Festival and the Toyota Muster in Gympie. In April 2006, the group appeared at the Byron Bay Blues Festival and the Gladstone Harbour Festival.

In mid-April 2007, Merritt was admitted to a Los Angeles hospital with symptoms of kidney failure. He was diagnosed with Goodpasture syndrome, a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the kidneys and lungs. Merritt was struggling with his health and finances, so his manager Wal Bishop and Australian music industry friends, organised a &quot;Concert for Max&quot; benefit held at the Palais Theatre, St Kilda, Victoria, on 21 October 2007 which raised $200,000. On 1 July 2008, Merritt was inducted by Glenn A. Baker into the ARIA Hall of Fame. Merritt was joined on stage by Kasey Chambers and Bill Chambers to perform &quot;Slipping Away&quot;.
Merritt died in Los Angeles, California, on 24 September 2020, at age 79, 13-years after being diagnosed with Goodpasture syndrome.

Prior to his death, Merritt had recorded a new album, titled &quot;I Can Dream&quot;. The album was released on 27 November 2020.

<text>Broadlands is a country house located in the civil parish of Romsey Extra, near the town of Romsey in the Test Valley district of Hampshire, England. Its formal gardens and historic landscape are Grade II* listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. The house itself is Grade I listed.

==History==
The original manor and area known as Broadlands belonged to Romsey Abbey since before the Norman Conquest.

In 1547, after the dissolution of the monasteries, Broadlands was sold to Sir Francis Fleming. His granddaughter married Edward St Barbe, and the manor remained the property of the St Barbe family for the next 117 years. Sir John St Barbe, 1st Baronet () made many improvements to the property but died without children, bequeathing his estate to his cousin Humphrey Sydenham of Combe, Dulverton. In the chancel of Ashington Church, Somerset, is a monument of grey and white marble, inscribed:

Having been ruined by the 18th-century South Sea Bubble, Sydenham sold Broadlands in 1736, with its Tudor and Jacobean manor house, to Henry Temple, 1st Viscount Palmerston, for £26,500. The Viscount began the deformalisation of the gardens between the river and the house and produced the broad-lands, a &quot;gentle descent to the river&quot;.
In 1767, a major architectural &quot;transformation&quot; of the house and garden was begun by Capability Brown, the celebrated architect and landscape designer, and completed by the architect Henry Holland, which made Broadlands the Palladian-style country house seen today. Henry Temple, 2nd Viscount Palmerston had requested that Brown go there and seize upon the &quot;capabilities&quot; of the earlier manor house. Between 1767 and 1780, William Kent&#x27;s earlier &quot;deformalising work&quot; was completed, as well as further landscaping, planting, clearing and riverside work.

Broadlands was the country estate of the 19th-century British prime minister Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston. After his death, the estate was inherited by his step-son, William Cowper-Temple, 1st Baron Mount Temple (1811–1888). A devout Christian, he held public prayer meetings in the grounds and also banned all blood-sports on the property. On his death, the estate passed to a great-nephew, Evelyn Ashley (1836-1907), a younger son of Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury (1801-1885). Subsequently, Broadlands passed to Evelyn Ashley&#x27;s son Wilfrid Ashley, 1st Baron Mount Temple, who died in 1939 and left it to his daughter Edwina Ashley, the wife of Lord Louis Mountbatten.

Elizabeth II (then Princess Elizabeth) and Prince Philip spent their honeymoon at Broadlands in November 1947; the first Earl Mountbatten of Burma, whose home Broadlands was at the time, was Philip&#x27;s uncle. In 1981, the newly married Prince (later Charles III) and Princess of Wales also spent the first three days of their honeymoon at Broadlands, travelling to the estate by train from London Waterloo.

==The present==
Broadlands is the home of the Earl and Countess Mountbatten of Burma. The house is open to the public for guided tours on weekday afternoons in summer.

On 1 August 2004, Irish vocal pop band Westlife held a concert at Broadlands as part of their Turnaround Tour promoting their album &quot;Turnaround&quot;.

<doc id="1289709" wikidata="Q291117" url="?curid=1289709" title="Porirua Harbour">
<text>Te Awarua-o-Porirua Harbour, commonly known as Porirua Harbour, is a natural inlet in the south-western coast of the North Island of New Zealand.

The harbour is within the main urban area of the Wellington Region, and is surrounded by the city of Porirua, with the city centre to the south of the harbour.

==Geography==

The harbour has an entrance only a few hundred metres in width, close to the suburb of Plimmerton. It opens up into two arms, Onepoto Arm to the south and Pāuatahanui Arm to the north-east. Each arm is around three kilometres in length.

The Pāuatahanui Inlet arm extends eastward to the settlement of Pāuatahanui. The wetland there where the Pāuatahanui Stream enters the Pāuatahanui Inlet, is the largest remaining estuarine wetland in the lower North Island, and the Pāuatahanui Wildlife Reserve was established in the 1980s to protect the inlet&#x27;s environment and to restore damaged areas.

==History==
The Porirua Harbour formed when westward flowing rivers were drowned by rising postglacial sea levels approximately 10000–14000 years ago. There is a tradition that the 1855 Wairarapa Earthquake caused tectonic uplift in the Pāuatahanui Arm of the inlet, changing the shoreline and reducing its navigability. However, according to George Eiby, the inlet always had limited accessibility, and the earthquake didn&#x27;t significantly change the shoreline, with any changes likely coming from more recent sedimentation.

Part of the Porirua Inlet was reclaimed for a causeway carrying the North Island Main Trunk railway when the section between Porirua and Mana was straightened and double tracked. The new section of the Kapiti Line was opened on 7 November 1960. A new Paremata Railway Station and bridge over the entrance to the Pāuatahanui Inlet were required.

The line no longer followed the curves of the shoreline bays north of Porirua, and three shallow lagoons on the land side of the new causeway were created. When State Highway 1 was re-aligned and straightened in the 1970s to run alongside the rail line, these lagoons were partially filled in. Aotea Lagoon was developed into a recreational area, albeit very polluted.

The name of the harbour was officially altered to Te Awarua-o-Porirua Harbour in August 2014.

==Recreation==

The Pāuatahanui Inlet is used for windsurfing, but is not recommended for swimming.

North of Paremata are the swimming beaches of Plimmerton and Karehana Bay. The southern end of Plimmerton Beach is also exposed to northwesterly winds for windsurfing.

There are also fishing spots at Tokaapapa Reef (or Grandfather rocks) off Plimmerton, Mana Island and Hunters Bank. However, weather conditions can change quickly and can be hazardous.

==Guardians of Pāuatahanui Inlet==
A community group, the Guardians of Pāuatahanui Inlet, was set up in 1991 as a registered charity, to undertake tasks such as cleaning up around the inlet. They also run photographic competitions.

<text>In group theory, a word metric on a discrete group formula_1 is a way to measure distance between any two elements of formula_1. As the name suggests, the word metric is a metric on formula_1, assigning to any two elements formula_4, formula_5 of formula_1 a distance formula_7 that measures how efficiently their difference formula_8 can be expressed as a word whose letters come from a generating set for the group. The word metric on &quot;G&quot; is very closely related to the Cayley graph of &quot;G&quot;: the word metric measures the length of the shortest path in the Cayley graph between two elements of &quot;G&quot;.

A generating set for formula_9 must first be chosen before a word metric on formula_9 is specified. Different choices of a generating set will typically yield different word metrics. While this seems at first to be a weakness in the concept of the word metric, it can be exploited to prove theorems about geometric properties of groups, as is done in geometric group theory.

== Examples ==

=== The group of integers formula_11 ===

The group of integers formula_11 is generated by the set {-1,+1}. The integer -3 can be expressed as -1-1-1+1-1, a word of length 5 in these generators. But the word that expresses -3 most efficiently is -1-1-1, a word of length 3. The distance between 0 and -3 in the word metric is therefore equal to 3. More generally, the distance between two integers &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot; in the word metric is equal to |&quot;m&quot;-&quot;n&quot;|, because the shortest word representing the difference &quot;m&quot;-&quot;n&quot; has length equal to |&quot;m&quot;-&quot;n&quot;|.

=== The group formula_13 ===

For a more illustrative example, the elements of the group formula_14 can be thought of as vectors in the Cartesian plane with integer coefficients. The group formula_14 is generated by the standard unit vectors formula_16, formula_17 and their inverses formula_18, formula_19. The Cayley graph of formula_14 is the so-called taxicab geometry. It can be pictured in the plane as an infinite square grid of city streets, where each horizontal and vertical line with integer coordinates is a street, and each point of formula_14 lies at the intersection of a horizontal and a vertical street. Each horizontal segment between two vertices represents the generating vector formula_22 or formula_23, depending on whether the segment is travelled in the forward or backward direction, and each vertical segment represents formula_24 or formula_25. A car starting from formula_26 and travelling along the streets to formula_27 can make the trip by many different routes. But no matter what route is taken, the car must travel at least |1 - (-2)| = 3 horizontal blocks and at least |2 - 4| = 2 vertical blocks, for a total trip distance of at least 3 + 2 = 5. If the car goes out of its way the trip may be longer, but the minimal distance travelled by the car, equal in value to the word metric between formula_26 and formula_27 is therefore equal to 5.

In general, given two elements formula_30 and formula_31 of formula_14, the distance between formula_33 and formula_34 in the word metric is equal to formula_35.

== Definition ==

Let &quot;G&quot; be a group, let &quot;S&quot; be a generating set for &quot;G&quot;, and suppose that &quot;S&quot; is closed under the inverse operation on &quot;G&quot;. A word over the set &quot;S&quot; is just a finite sequence formula_36 whose entries formula_37 are elements of &quot;S&quot;. The integer &quot;L&quot; is called the length of the word formula_38. Using the group operation in &quot;G&quot;, the entries of a word formula_36 can be multiplied in order, remembering that the entries are elements of &quot;G&quot;. The result of this multiplication is an element formula_40 in the group &quot;G&quot;, which is called the evaluation of the word &quot;w&quot;. As a special case, the empty word formula_41 has length zero, and its evaluation is the identity element of &quot;G&quot;.

Given an element &quot;g&quot; of &quot;G&quot;, its word norm |&quot;g&quot;| with respect to the generating set &quot;S&quot; is defined to be the shortest length of a word formula_38 over &quot;S&quot; whose evaluation formula_40 is equal to &quot;g&quot;. Given two elements &quot;g&quot;,&quot;h&quot; in &quot;G&quot;, the distance d(g,h) in the word metric with respect to &quot;S&quot; is defined to be formula_44. Equivalently, d(&quot;g&quot;,&quot;h&quot;) is the shortest length of a word &quot;w&quot; over &quot;S&quot; such that formula_45.

The word metric on &quot;G&quot; satisfies the axioms for a metric, and it is not hard to prove this. The proof of the symmetry axiom d(&quot;g&quot;,&quot;h&quot;) = d(&quot;h&quot;,&quot;g&quot;) for a metric uses the assumption that the generating set &quot;S&quot; is closed under inverse.

=== Variations ===

The word metric has an equivalent definition formulated in more geometric terms using the Cayley graph of &quot;G&quot; with respect to the generating set &quot;S&quot;. When each edge of the Cayley graph is assigned a metric of length 1, the distance between two group elements &quot;g&quot;,&quot;h&quot; in &quot;G&quot; is equal to the shortest length of a path in the Cayley graph from the vertex &quot;g&quot; to the vertex &quot;h&quot;.

The word metric on &quot;G&quot; can also be defined without assuming that the generating set &quot;S&quot; is closed under inverse. To do this, first symmetrize &quot;S&quot;, replacing it by a larger generating set consisting of each formula_46 in &quot;S&quot; as well as its inverse formula_47. Then define the word metric with respect to &quot;S&quot; to be the word metric with respect to the symmetrization of &quot;S&quot;.

== Example in a free group ==

Suppose that &quot;F&quot; is the free group on the two element set formula_48. A word &quot;w&quot; in the symmetric generating set formula_49 is said to be reduced if the letters formula_50 do not occur next to each other in &quot;w&quot;, nor do the letters formula_51. Every element formula_52 is represented by a unique reduced word, and this reduced word is the shortest word representing &quot;g&quot;. For example, since the word formula_53 is reduced and has length 2, the word norm of formula_38 equals 2, so the distance in the word norm between formula_55 and formula_56 equals 2. This can be visualized in terms of the Cayley graph, where the shortest path between &quot;b&quot; and &quot;a&quot; has length 2.

== Theorems ==

=== Isometry of the left action ===

The group &quot;G&quot; acts on itself by left multiplication: the action of each formula_57 takes each formula_58 to formula_59. This action is an isometry of the word metric. The proof is simple: the distance between formula_59 and formula_61 equals formula_62, which equals the distance between formula_63 and formula_64.

=== Bilipschitz invariants of a group ===

In general, the word metric on a group &quot;G&quot; is not unique, because different symmetric generating sets give different word metrics. However, finitely generated word metrics are unique up to bilipschitz equivalence: if formula_65, formula_66 are two symmetric, finite generating sets for &quot;G&quot; with corresponding word metrics formula_67, formula_68, then there is a constant formula_69 such that for any formula_70, 

:formula_71.

This constant &quot;K&quot; is just the maximum of the formula_67 word norms of elements of formula_66 and the formula_68 word norms of elements of formula_65. This proof is also easy: any word over &quot;S&quot; can be converted by substitution into a word over &quot;T&quot;, expanding the length of the word by a factor of at most &quot;K&quot;, and similarly for converting words over &quot;T&quot; into words over &quot;S&quot;.

The bilipschitz equivalence of word metrics implies in turn that the growth rate of a finitely generated group is a well-defined isomorphism invariant of the group, independent of the choice of a finite generating set. This implies in turn that various properties of growth, such as polynomial growth, the degree of polynomial growth, and exponential growth, are isomorphism invariants of groups. This topic is discussed further in the article on the growth rate of a group.

=== Quasi-isometry invariants of a group ===

In geometric group theory, groups are studied by their actions on metric spaces. A principle that generalizes the bilipschitz invariance of word metrics says that any finitely generated word metric on &quot;G&quot; is quasi-isometric to any proper, geodesic metric space on which &quot;G&quot; acts, properly discontinuously and cocompactly. Metric spaces on which &quot;G&quot; acts in this manner are called model spaces for &quot;G&quot;.

It follows in turn that any quasi-isometrically invariant property satisfied by the word metric of &quot;G&quot; or by any model space of &quot;G&quot; is an isomorphism invariant of &quot;G&quot;. Modern geometric group theory is in large part the study of quasi-isometry invariants.

<text>James Curtis Hepburn (; March 13, 1815 – September 21, 1911) was an American physician, educator, translator and lay Christian missionary. He is known for the Hepburn romanization system for transliteration of the Japanese language into the Latin alphabet, which he popularized in his Japanese–English dictionary.

== Background and early life ==
Hepburn was born in Milton, Pennsylvania, on March 13, 1815. He attended Princeton University, earned a master&#x27;s degree, after which he attended the University of Pennsylvania, where he received his M.D. degree in 1836, and became a physician. He decided to go to China as a medical missionary, but had to stay in Singapore for two years because the First Opium War was underway and Chinese ports were closed to foreigners. After five years as a missionary, he returned to the United States in 1845 and opened a medical practice in New York City.

==Missionary work in Japan==
In 1859, Hepburn went to Japan as a medical missionary with the American Presbyterian Mission. After first arriving in Nagasaki in October 1859, Hepburn swiftly relocated to the newly opened treaty port of Yokohama, opening his first clinic in April 1861 at the Sokoji Temple. Initially residing at Jobutsuji in Kanagawa, a dilapidated temple formerly occupied by the Dutch consulate, Hepburn was the first Christian missionary to take up residence close to the newly opened treaty port. Hepburn&#x27;s family shared accommodation at Jobutsuji with Dutch Reformed minister Rev. Samuel Robbins Brown and all were quickly absorbed into the local foreign community, Hepburn being appointed honorary physician to the US Consul, Townsend Harris.

Hepburn&#x27;s first clinic failed as the Bakumatsu authorities, wanting the missionaries to relocate to Yokohama, put pressure on patients to stop going to it. In the spring of 1862, Hepburn and his family relocated to the house and compound at Kyoryuchi No. 39, in the heart of the foreigners residential district in the treaty port of Yokohama. There, in addition to his clinic, he and his wife Clara founded the Hepburn School, which eventually developed into Meiji Gakuin University. Hepburn&#x27;s Japanese pupils included Furuya Sakuzaemon, Takahashi Korekiyo, and Numa Morikazu.

For his medical contributions to the city of Yokohama, Hepburn Hall was named in his honor on the campus of Yokohama City University School of Medicine.

In May 1867, with the collaboration of his long-time assistant Kishida Ginkō, Hepburn published a Japanese–English dictionary which rapidly became the standard reference work for prospective students of Japanese. In the dictionary&#x27;s third edition, published in 1886, Hepburn adopted a new system for romanization of the Japanese language developed by the Society for the Romanization of the Japanese Alphabet (&quot;&quot;). This system is widely known as the Hepburn romanization because Hepburn&#x27;s dictionary popularized it. Hepburn also contributed to the translation of the Bible into Japanese.

==Later years==

Hepburn returned to the United States in 1892. On March 14, 1905, a day after Hepburn&#x27;s 90th birthday, he was awarded the decoration of the Order of the Rising Sun, third class. Hepburn was the second foreigner to receive this honor.

He died on September 21, 1911, in East Orange, New Jersey, at the age of 96. He is interred in Orange&#x27;s Rosedale Cemetery.

<text>Antisexualism is opposition or hostility towards sexual behavior and sexuality.

==Terminology==
Other terms whose meanings overlap or are synonymous or interchangeable with antisexualism include &quot;sex-negativism&quot;, &quot;sex-negative movement&quot;, &quot;sex-negativity&quot;, &quot;antisexuality&quot;, &quot;demonization of sex&quot; or as an adjective, &quot;anti-sex&quot; or &quot;sex-negative&quot;. In a broader scope, it may refer to a general opposition to sexuality, especially tending to reduce or eliminate the sex drive or sexual activity or a force in society that suppresses sexual freedom and disseminates antisexual opinions. When such an aversion involves hatred, it is sometimes called &quot;miserotia&quot; or &quot;miserotism&quot;.

==Religious==

Some forms of early ascetic Gnosticism held all matter to be evil, and that unnecessary gratifications of the physical senses were to be avoided. Married couples were encouraged to be chaste. In the first century, Marcion of Sinope held an antisexual and ascetic outlook. The Skoptsys were a radical sect of the Russian Orthodox Church that practiced castration and amputation of sexual organs. The Skoptsy believed that Christ had been castrated during his crucifixion, and it was this castration that brought about salvation. Boston Corbett, who was involved in killing John Wilkes Booth, castrated himself after being mocked and tempted by prostitutes. Ann Lee was the founder of the Shakers, a radical Protestant sect that opposed procreation and all sexual activity. The Shakers were more opposed to pregnancy than anything else. Father Divine, founder of the International Peace Mission Movement, advocated religious abstinence from sex and marriage and taught that sexual objectification is a root cause of undesirable social and political conditions.

James Baldwin in &quot;The Fire Next Time&quot; refers to the United States as an antisexual country dominated by a white culture that regards sensual or soulful behavior by Black Americans as suspect. This contributed to a crisis of Baldwin&#x27;s Christian faith, showing that the world did not accept him, and that Christianity had not made white people accepting.

==Non-religious==
Philosopher Immanuel Kant viewed humans as being subject to the animalistic desires of self-preservation, species-preservation, and the preservation of enjoyment. He argued that humans have a duty to avoid maxims that harm or degrade themselves, including suicide, sexual degradation, and drunkenness. This led Kant to regard sexual intercourse as degrading because it &quot;makes of the loved person an Object of appetite&quot;, rather than focusing on their inherent worth as rational beings, which violates Kant&#x27;s second formulation of the categorical imperative, a philosophical concept he created to judge the morality of actions. He admitted sex only within marriage, which he regarded as &quot;a merely animal union&quot;.

===Feminist===
Various feminist views on sexuality have been described as anti-sex or sex-negative. In particular, second-wave and radical feminist viewpoints and thinkers have been subject to this, including from other feminists.

Prior to the second wave of feminism, which introduced such slogans as &quot;The personal is political&quot; in the 1960s, the subject of women&#x27;s sexuality had rarely been addressed as a politicized subject, although the subjugation of women by aspects of male sexuality had been discussed. Major feminist organizations, such as the National Organization for Women (NOW) in the United States, primarily focused on male supremacy in the public sphere. It was not until the earliest radical feminist groups began to form in the late 1960s that feminist analysis of women&#x27;s sexuality started to become widespread.

According to radical feminist theory, sexuality is the primary sphere of patriarchy, with sexual activity, especially heterosexual sex, as the basis of women&#x27;s oppression by men. Sexuality, according to radical feminists, only serves to revoke the agency of women. Radical feminists oppose the sexual objectification of women, for their sexual and reproductive labor, and hold the view that in a male-dominated society heterosexual practices involve an imbalance of power and serve to sexualize the oppression of women. Ti-Grace Atkinson wrote of heterosexual sex as a social institution serving the needs of men but not necessarily of women. This analysis led some radical feminists to call for women to stop having sex with men altogether, with some advocating for celibacy and others advocating political lesbianism. This led to the second wave polarizing around two camps in what would become known as the feminist sex wars.

Radical feminist writer Julie Bindel described female bisexuality as a &quot;fashionable trend&quot; pushing for sexual hedonism. She writes, &quot;if bisexual women had an ounce of sexual politics, they would stop sleeping with men.&quot;

Several authors have objected to radical feminists on this front. Margaret Hunt criticized Sheila Jeffreys for praising women involved in the 19th-century social purity movement, whose &quot;concern with women&#x27;s victimization&quot; Jeffreys admired.

Naomi Wolf identified a form of feminism she called victim feminism, which she described as &quot;sexually judgmental, even antisexual&quot;.

== Criticism ==
Friedrich Nietzsche has many criticisms of Jesus and Christianity. In &quot;Human, All Too Human&quot;, and &quot;Twilight of the Idols&quot; for example, Nietzsche accuses the Church&#x27;s and Jesus&#x27; teachings as being anti-natural in their treatment of passions, in particularly sexuality: &quot;There [In the Sermon on the Mount] it is said, for example, with particular reference to sexuality: &#x27;If thy eye offend thee, pluck it out.&#x27; Fortunately, no Christian acts in accordance with this precept... the Christian who follows that advice and believes he has killed his sensuality is deceiving himself: it lives on in an uncanny vampire form and torments in repulsive disguises.&quot;

Antisexualism drew sharp criticism from Bertrand Russell in his &quot;Marriage and Morals&quot;:

According to Bertrand Russell, an anti-sexual attitude must be regarded as purely superstitious and those who first inculcated antisexualism must have suffered from a diseased condition of body or mind, or both.

==Anaphrodisiacs==
John Harvey Kellogg, the inventor of the corn flakes variety of breakfast cereal, was opposed to all forms of sexual activity, especially masturbation. &quot;The Road to Wellville&quot; satirized his life and practices. According to some sources, the early Christian theologian Origen castrated himself to avoid temptation and remain pure.

==Fictional==
* The Junior Anti-Sex League, in George Orwell&#x27;s dystopian novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four,&quot; was a group of young adult Party members devoted to banning all sexual intercourse.
* The film &quot;Demolition Man&quot; takes place in a future in which sexual intercourse is banned – reproduction is achieved clinically and the experience itself is simulated through virtual reality. These attitudes resulted from STD outbreaks that caused widespread fear.
* The song Samurai Abstinence Patrol by comedy music duo Ninja Sex Party is about a group known as the Samurai Abstinence Patrol who ban all sex in the future.
