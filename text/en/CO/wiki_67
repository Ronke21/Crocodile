<text>The staged combustion cycle (sometimes known as topping cycle, preburner cycle, or closed cycle) is a power cycle of a bipropellant rocket engine. In the staged combustion cycle, propellant flows through multiple combustion chambers, and is thus combusted in stages. The main advantage relative to other rocket engine power cycles is high fuel efficiency, measured through specific impulse, while its main disadvantage is engineering complexity.

Typically, propellant flows through two kinds of combustion chambers; the first called and the second called . In the preburner, a small portion of propellant, usually fuel-rich, is partly combusted under non-stoichiometric conditions, increasing the volume of flow driving the turbopumps that feed the engine with propellant. The gas is then injected into the main combustion chamber and combusted completely with the other propellant to produce thrust.

== Tradeoffs ==
The main advantage is fuel efficiency due to all of the propellant flowing to the main combustion chamber, which also allows for higher thrust. The staged combustion cycle is sometimes referred to as , as opposed to the gas generator, or open cycle where a portion of propellant never reaches the main combustion chamber. The disadvantage is engineering complexity, partly a result of the preburner exhaust of hot and highly pressurized gas which, particularly when oxidizer-rich, produces extremely harsh conditions for turbines and plumbing.

==History==
Staged combustion () was first proposed by Alexey Isaev in 1949. The first staged combustion engine was the S1.5400 (11D33) used in the Soviet Molniya rocket, designed by Melnikov, a former assistant to Isaev. About the same time (1959), Nikolai Kuznetsov began work on the closed cycle engine NK-9 for Korolev&#x27;s orbital ICBM, GR-1. Kuznetsov later evolved that design into the NK-15 and NK-33 engines for the unsuccessful Lunar N1 rocket.
The non-cryogenic N2O4/UDMH engine RD-253 using staged combustion was developed by Valentin Glushko circa 1963 for the Proton rocket.

After the abandonment of the N1, Kuznetsov was ordered to destroy the NK-33 technology, but instead he warehoused dozens of the engines. In the 1990s, Aerojet was contacted and eventually visited Kuznetsov&#x27;s plant. Upon meeting initial skepticism about the high specific impulse and other specifications, Kuznetsov shipped an engine to the US for testing. Oxidizer-rich staged combustion had been considered by American engineers, but was not considered a feasible direction because of resources they assumed the design would require to make work.
The Russian RD-180 engine also employs a staged-combustion rocket engine cycle. Lockheed Martin began purchasing the RD-180 in circa 2000 for the Atlas III and later, the V, rockets. The purchase contract was subsequently taken over by United Launch Alliance (ULA—the Boeing/Lockheed-Martin joint venture) after 2006, and ULA continues to fly the Atlas V with RD-180 engines as of 2025.

The first laboratory staged-combustion test engine in the West was built in Germany in 1963, by Ludwig Boelkow.

Hydrogen peroxide/kerosene powered engines may use a closed-cycle process by catalytically decomposing the peroxide to drive turbines &quot;before&quot; combustion with the kerosene in the combustion chamber proper. This gives the efficiency advantages of staged combustion, while avoiding major engineering problems.

The RS-25 Space Shuttle main engine is another example of a staged combustion engine, and the first to use liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. Its counterpart in the Soviet shuttle was the RD-0120, which had similar specific impulse, thrust, and chamber pressure, but with some differences that reduced complexity and cost at the expense of increased engine weight.

==Variants==

Several variants of the staged combustion cycle exist. Preburners that burn a small portion of oxidizer with a full flow of fuel are called , while preburners that burn a small portion of fuel with a full flow of oxidizer are called . The RD-180 has an oxidizer-rich preburner, while the RS-25 has two fuel-rich preburners. The SpaceX Raptor has both oxidizer-rich and fuel-rich preburners, a design called &quot;full-flow staged combustion&quot;.

Staged combustion designs can be either or . In the single-shaft design, one set of preburner and turbine drives both propellant turbopumps. Examples include the Energomash RD-180 and the Blue Origin BE-4. In the twin-shaft design, the two propellant turbopumps are driven by separate turbines, which are in turn driven by the outflow of either one or separate preburners. Examples of twin-shaft designs include the Rocketdyne RS-25, the JAXA LE-7, and Raptor. Relative to a single-shaft design, the twin-shaft design requires an additional turbine (and possibly another preburner), but allows for individual control of the two turbopumps. Hydrolox engines are typically twin-shaft designs due to greatly differing propellant densities.

In addition to the propellant turbopumps, staged combustion engines often require smaller boost pumps to prevent both preburner backflow and turbopump cavitation. For example, the RD-180 and RS-25 use boost pumps driven by tap-off and expander cycles, as well as pressurized tanks, to incrementally increase propellant pressure prior to entering the preburner.

===Full-flow staged combustion cycle===

Full-flow staged combustion (FFSC) is a twin-shaft staged combustion fuel cycle design that uses both oxidizer-rich and fuel-rich preburners where the entire supply of both propellants passes through the turbines. The fuel turbopump is driven by the fuel-rich preburner, and the oxidizer turbopump is driven by the oxidizer-rich preburner.

Benefits of the full-flow staged combustion cycle include turbines that run cooler and at lower pressure, due to increased mass flow, leading to a longer engine life and higher reliability. As an example, up to 25 flights were anticipated for an engine design studied by the DLR (German Aerospace Center) in the frame of the SpaceLiner project, and up to 1000 flights are expected for Raptor from SpaceX. Further, the full-flow cycle eliminates the need for an interpropellant turbine seal normally required to separate oxidizer-rich gas from the fuel turbopump or fuel-rich gas from the oxidizer turbopump, thus improving reliability.

Since the use of both fuel and oxidizer preburners results in full gasification of each propellant before entering the combustion chamber, FFSC engines belong to a broader class of rocket engines called . Full gasification of components leads to faster chemical reactions in the combustion chamber, allowing a smaller combustion chamber. This in turn makes it feasible to increase the chamber pressure, which increases efficiency.

Potential disadvantages of the full-flow staged combustion cycle include more stringent materials requirements, and the increased engineering complexity and parts count of the two preburners, relative to a single-shaft staged combustion cycle.

As of 2024, four full-flow staged combustion rocket engines have been tested on test stands; the Soviet storable propellant RD-270 project at Energomash in the 1960s, the US government-funded hydrolox Integrated Powerhead Demonstrator project at Aerojet Rocketdyne in the mid-2000s, SpaceX&#x27;s flight capable methalox Raptor engine first test-fired in February 2019, and the methalox engine developed for the first stage of the Stoke Space Nova vehicle in 2024.

The first flight test of a full-flow staged-combustion engine occurred on 25 July 2019 when SpaceX flew their Raptor methalox FFSC engine on the &quot;Starhopper&quot; test rocket, at their South Texas Launch Site. As of January 2025, the Raptor is the only FFSC engine that has flown on a launch vehicle.

It is a subsidiary of FEMSA which owns 47.8% of its stock, with 27.8% held by wholly owned subsidiaries of The Coca-Cola Company and the remaining 25% listed publicly on the Mexican Stock Exchange (since 1993) and the New York Stock Exchange (since 1998).

It later acquired additional bottling companies in Brazil (its second largest market) as well as the main Coca-Cola bottler in the Philippines in 2013, until 2018 when the company was then renamed to Coca-Cola Beverages Philippines. 

In 2007, Coca-Cola FEMSA acquired Jugos del Valle in a joint venture with The Coca-Cola Company. In June 2008, Coca-Cola FEMSA acquired Refrigerantes Minas Gerais.

In 2011, the company merged Grupo Tampico and Corporación Los Angeles. Later that same year, Coca-Cola FEMSA acquired Grupo Industrias Lacteas, parent company of Estrella Azul, in a joint venture with The Coca-Cola Company.

Coca-Cola FEMSA merged beverage operations with Grupo Fomento Queretano in 2012. In 2013, the company merged more bottling operations with Grupo Yoli as well as acquiring Brazilian companies Companhia Fluminense de Refrigerantes and Industria Brasileira de Bebidas.

<text>Into the West is a 1992 Irish magical realist film about Irish Travellers written by Jim Sheridan and David Keating, directed by Mike Newell, and stars Gabriel Byrne and Ellen Barkin.

==Plot==

&quot;Into the West&quot; is a film about two young boys, Tito (Conroy) and Ossie (Fitzgerald), whose father &quot;Papa&quot; Reilly (Byrne) was &quot;King of Irish Travellers&quot; until his wife, Mary, died during Ossie&#x27;s birth. The boys&#x27; grandfather (David Kelly) is an old story-telling Traveller, who regales the children with Irish folk-tales and legends. When he is followed by a beautiful white horse called Tír na nÓg (meaning &quot;Land of Eternal Youth&quot; in Irish), from the sea to Dublin, where the boys and their father have now settled down in a grim tower block in Ballymun, the boys are overwhelmed with joy and dreams of becoming cowboys. The horse is stolen from them by corrupt Gardai and is sold as a racehorse. They see Tír na nÓg on TV, and they begin their adventure to get their mystical horse back. They escape the poverty of a north Dublin council estate, and ride &quot;Into the West&quot;. Papa Reilly is arrested, and beaten by the corrupt Gardaí, until he is released on the orders of the superintendent. He then returns to his halting site, where he is shown no welcome. His friend Kathleen takes him in and from there they go to track the boys. Meanwhile, the boys find shelter using traditional traveller methods and move further west as &quot;cowboys&quot;. As they travel, they find the Gardai, helicopters and dog packs tracking them. Tír na nÓg always seems to find a way to avoid them. The horse takes them to their mother&#x27;s grave, where Ossie finds out his mother died giving birth to him. The net closes in on the boys, forcing them to flee to the beach, where they find Papa Reilly, Kathleen and the Barrel maker. The Gardai catch Papa Reilly and the Barrel maker in nets, and Tír na nÓg gallops into the sea, with Ossie still on his back. Papa Reilly breaks free and goes into the sea, where he brings out a lifeless Ossie. After receiving CPR, Ossie comes round. The superintendent calls off the hunt for the boys. After that, Papa Reilly finally burns his Barrel Wagon, and puts his Wife&#x27;s memory to rest. The boys see Tír na nÓg&#x27;s image in the flames, and smile.

==Production==
&quot;Into the West&quot; was co-financed by U.S. independent film company Miramax and film-sales outlet Majestic Films International. The script was written by Jim Sheridan, who did not intend to write simply for children, although the film mainly follows two young children on the run with their beautiful, magical white horse. Other themes targeted to adults, are also present: grief, the clash of cultures with differing values, and the use of the police by the rich and powerful to enforce property rights in their favour. Sheridan wrote the script five years before he directed &quot;My Left Foot&quot;.

Gabriel Byrne said it was one of the best scripts he ever read, and described it at the time as Jim Sheridan&#x27;s best work to date. Byrne was committed to the work, and commented: &quot;Apart from it being a story about Travellers, and the relationship between a father and his two sons, it really was in a way about Ireland&quot;. Ellen Barkin said that from the first reading she thought it an extraordinary piece of film writing.

The film&#x27;s most memorable scenes, such as the horse in the cinema and the beans exploding, were shot in the small town of Portarlington in County Laois.

==Release==
In the U.S., &quot;Into the West&quot; was the first release from the Miramax Family Films label.

==Reception==
The film has received a mostly positive critical reception. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a score of 77% based on reviews from 13 critics.

Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times said the &quot;kids will probably love this movie, but adults will get a lot more out of it&quot;. Variety Staff said that &quot;&quot;Into the West&quot; is a likable but modest pic&quot;, and that &quot;a major asset throughout is Patrick Doyle&#x27;s rich, Gaelic-flavoured scoring that carries the movie&#x27;s emotional line and fairy tale atmosphere&quot;. Desson Howe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said that the film is &quot;a charming children&#x27;s crusade – a rewarding journey for all ages&quot;. Rita Kempley of the Washington Post said that &quot;the movie is alternately grim and lyrical&quot;, and &quot;though long on ambiance and short on story, it may appeal to the spiritually inclined – and to oater lovers&quot;.

===Box office===
&quot;Into the West&quot; was the fourth highest-grossing film in Ireland for the year with a gross of £748,080.

===Awards===
* 1993: Roxanne T. Mueller Audience Choice Award for Best Film at the Cleveland International Film Festival – Mike Newell.

* 1994: Golden Calf for Best European Film at the Netherlands Film Festival – Mike Newell.
* 1994: Young Artist Award for Outstanding Family Foreign Film at the Young Artist Awards – Mike Newell.

<text>The Ditto drive series was a proprietary magnetic tape data storage system released by Iomega during the 1990s. It was marketed as a backup device for personal computers.

They were released in several capacities ranging from the original Ditto 250 drive (250MB compressed capacity per cartridge) to the DittoMAX drive, a compatible format with compressed capacities up to 10GB per cartridge. This was accomplished by increasing the physical size of the cartridge (making it longer). Some versions of the drive were also able to read Travan-type tapes.

==Technical aspects==
Ditto internal drives were connected through the floppy drive channel and used MFM encoding to store data (the same method as on older floppy drives). An ISA accelerator card called the &quot;Ditto Dash&quot;, providing higher speed than a stock floppy controller, was also available.

Ditto external drives were connected to the parallel port and offered a print-through port which allowed a printer to operate while daisy-chained to the Ditto drive. This is a feature also commonly found on an Iomega ZIP drive. Usage of the parallel port allowed for transfer speeds (in EPP mode) of a maximum 1 MB/s.

==Discontinuation==
In 1999, Iomega sold the Ditto brand and technology to Tecmar and exited the tape drive business.

The Ditto series has been discontinued. The need for higher capacities has made the Ditto series obsolete. The slow bandwidth of the Ditto also limited its usefulness compared to the Iomega REV or the older (and discontinued) Iomega Jaz.

== Models ==

<text>Eugen Samuilovich &quot;Jenő&quot; Varga (born as Eugen Weisz, November 6, 1879 – October 7, 1964) was a Soviet economist of Hungarian origin.

==Biography==
===Early years===

He was born as Jenő Weiß (Hungarian orthography: Weisz) in a poor Jewish family, as a child of Samuel Weisz - who was a teacher in the primary school of Nagytétény - and Julianna Singer. Eugen &quot;Jenő&quot; Varga studied philosophy and economic geography at the University of Budapest. In 1906, he started writing in socialist and academic journals, mainly on economic subjects. Before World War I he gained some fame by discussing with Otto Bauer the origins of inflation in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In this period, he belonged to the Marxist Centrists, of whom Karl Kautsky and Rudolf Hilferding were the most prominent spokesmen.

===Hungarian revolution===

In February 1919, Varga joined the newly created Hungarian Communist Party. During the short-lived Hungarian Soviet Republic of 1919, led by Béla Kun, he was People&#x27;s Commissar for Finance (March 21-April 3), and then Chairman of the Supreme Council of National Economy. After the overthrow of the Soviet Republic he fled to Vienna.

===Soviet emigration===

In 1920 he went to the Soviet Union with Arthur Holitscher. Here he started working for the Comintern, specializing in international economic problems and agrarian questions. In the years 1922-1927 he was working at the department of trade in the Soviet embassy in Berlin. In 1927-47, he was director of the Institute of World Economy and World Politics. In the 1930s, he became an economic adviser to Joseph Stalin. He survived the purges of the 1930s, during which Bela Kun and other Hungarians were executed.

During World War II he advised the Soviet Government in matters of post-war reparations. He attended the Potsdam Conference of 1945 as an expert. Like most of his compatriots living and working in Moscow, he joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, but he also remained active in the Hungarian Communist Party.

He authored the economic reports the congresses of the Comintern discussed between 1921 and 1935. A large number of his writings were studies of the international economic conjuncture, in which he made great effort to assess quantitative trends in output, investment and employment using official economic data from numerous countries. He also extensively studied German imperialism.

== Personality == 
In 1922, Alexander Barmine, a Soviet diplomat who later defected to the west, travelled by train to Moscow with delegates to the Fourth Congress of Comintern, including Varga, who &quot;showed the most revolting lack of consideration&quot; by demanding a private railway compartment. Barmine considered that he should have content with a berth in a first class carriage. He wrote: &quot;The little luxuries of power go to men&#x27;s heads.&quot;

Another Soviet defector Abdurakhman Avtorkhanov, writing under the pseudonym Alexander Uralov, left a humorous description of Varga, whom he described as having &quot;the pedantry of a German official, the obstinacy of a Russian accountant, and the suppleness of an Oriental fakir&quot;, and of his institute, where &quot;share fluctuations were followed more attentively than in any London or New York bank. The most brilliant member of the Stock Exchange would have envied the way in which Varga was kept informed.&quot;

== Post-War Controversy ==
In 1946, Varga published &quot;The Economic Transformation of Capitalism at the End of the Second World War&quot;, in which he argued that during the war, western governments had accumulated great power over the management of capitalist economies, which brought them closer to socialist economies and more likely to last. He was praised by Kremlin watchers in the west as a &#x27;person with a Western orientation&#x27; and a &#x27;defender&#x27; of the Marshall Plan, but &quot;these implications were highly distasteful to Soviet conservatives&quot; who believed that capitalism was heading for an extreme and possibly terminal crisis. During a closed meeting of economists called by the USSR Academy of Sciences and Moscow University, in May 1947, &quot;Varga was attacked for his writings by most, if not all, of the participants.&quot;

He was also attacked by Nikolai Voznesensky, then a powerful figure as Chairman of Gosplan and a member of the Politburo, who wrote a book in which he accused &#x27;certain theoreticians&#x27; of having &#x27;empty opinions which deserve no consideration&#x27;. Varga&#x27;s book was condemned at a meeting of economists and political experts in May 1947, and the institute he headed was closed and subsumed into Gosplan. Though he remained a leading academic economist, his prestige had diminished - in the second edition of the &quot;Great Soviet Encyclopedia&quot; he was qualified as a &quot;bourgeois economist&quot; - but the fact that he was not dismissed or arrested implies that he had powerful protectors. In March 1949, Voznesensky was arrested, and two days later, on 15 March, Varga published a self-critical letter in &quot;Pravda&quot;.

===Years after Stalin===

After Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953, Varga reappeared on the scene. In February 1956, he wrote an article in &quot;Pravda&quot; that rehabilitated Bela Kun. The new leaders in the Kremlin, believing in the virtues of peaceful co-existence, were not interested in Varga&#x27;s predictions of the outbreak of a &quot;necessary&quot; economic crisis in the United States. After his death, his selected works in three volumes were published in the Soviet Union, Hungary, and East Germany.

Varga never returned to living in his native Hungary. Because he was very close to Mátyás Rákosi, he was several times invited as an economic advisor to Hungary. In this period (1945-1950) he had specialized in economic planning, pricing and monetary reforms, i.e. reforms the Hungarian Communists now in power were carrying out. After the fall of Rákosi caused by the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and the take-over by the Kádár team, Varga&#x27;s advisory work was no longer fashionable.

<text>Dominique Edgard Antoine Potier (2 November 1903 – 11 January 1944) was a Belgian airforce officer during World War II who organised an MI9 escape and evasion network, known as &quot;Mission Martin&quot; in Belgium and the &quot;Possum Line&quot; in France. Captured and tortured by the Germans, Potier committed suicide.

==World War II service==
In May 1940, Potier was Capitaine-Commandant in the Belgian airforce. With the outbreak of World War II, Potier travelled across France, Spain and Portugal and arrived in England in March 1942. At age 39, he was rejected by the RAF as too old for active flying duties. He then joined MI9 and in July 1943 was parachuted into southeast Belgium (Province of Luxembourg) near Suxy, accompanied by a Canadian radio operator Conrad Lafleur. At this time, many allied aircrew, on bombing raids to Germany, were being shot down over the Belgian Ardennes. Potier&#x27;s mission, known as &quot;Mission Martin&quot; in Belgium and the &quot;Possum Line&quot; in France, was to organise the recovery of these airmen and shelter, feed and provide them with false identity documents, before moving them to safe houses in and around Reims in Northern France. Unlike the Ardennes, this area was suitable for evacuation by air, using Lysander aircraft.

Between August and December 1943, three successful operations took place repatriating eleven airmen and one SOE agent. The organisation also provided for and escorted airmen to the Brittany coast, in November 1943, for rescue by sea; an operation organised by the Jade-Fitzroy network. Possum operated safehouses in Paris, allowing evaders to be passed on to the Comète organisation. The two organisations in many ways supplemented each other&#x27;s activities. There are no records, but it is estimated some 60–70 airmen had passed through or were being sheltered by Possum.

After returning to England for a period, Potier was parachuted back into France on 20 December. On 28 December, Lafleur was transmitting messages to London, when he was surprised by the Germans. He escaped, but it was the start of a sequence of events that eventually led to the arrest of Potier. Initially he was taken to Fresnes prison in Paris, then returned to Reims, where after being subjected to considerable torture, he committed suicide on 11 January 1944. As more arrests followed, the organisation around Reims effectively collapsed. Of the 70 network members arrested in the French sector of Possum, some 60 were deported. Less than half returned.

==Reburial==
Potier&#x27;s remains were exhumed from Reims and, on 18 September 1950, he was reburied with full military honours in the Pelouse d&#x27;Honneur Aérienne, Cimetière Communal de B-1140 Bruxelles-Evère.

<doc id="1295385" wikidata="Q78857" url="?curid=1295385" title="Alfred von Arneth">
<text>Alfred Ritter von Arneth (10 July 181930 July 1897) was an Austrian historian. His principal scholarly work is a ten-volume biography of the Habsburg Empress Maria Theresa, first published in installments from 1863 to 1879 and still regarded as the standard work on the subject. Born at Vienna, he was the son of Joseph Calasanza von Arneth (1791–1863), a well-known historian and archaeologist, who wrote a history of the Austrian Empire (Vienna, 1827) and several works on numismatics and brother of Doctor Franz Hektor von Arneth (1818–1907).

==Life==
Alfred Arneth studied law, and became an official of the Austrian state archives, of which in 1868 he was appointed keeper. He was a moderate liberal in politics and a supporter of German unity. As such he was elected to the Frankfurt parliament in 1848. In 1861 he became a member of the Lower Austrian diet and in 1869 was nominated to the Upper House of the Austrian Reichsrat. In 1879 he was appointed president of the Kaiserliche Academie der Wissenschaften (Academy of Sciences) at Vienna, and in 1896 succeeded von Sybel as chairman of the historical commission at Munich.

Von Arneth was an indefatigable worker, and, as director of the archives, his willingness to listen to the advice of experts, as well as his own sound sense, reportedly helped to promote the more scientific treatment and use of public records in most of the archives of Europe. He was noted for his scientific temper and for drawing from original sources.

<text>The National Right to Life Committee (NRLC) is the oldest and largest national anti-abortion organization in the United States with affiliates in all 50 states and more than 3,000 local chapters nationwide.

Since the 1980s, NRLC has influenced anti-abortion policy at national and state levels through campaign financing of anti-abortion and almost exclusively Republican candidates and writing model legislation that would restrict or ban abortion.

==Organization==
The national organization of National Right to Life comprises the:

* National Right to Life Committee, Inc. (NRLC), 501c(4), EIN: 52–0986196;
* National Right to Life Committee Educational Trust Fund, 501c(3), EIN: 52–1241126;
* National Right to Life Educational Foundation, Inc., 501c(3), EIN: 73–1010913;
* National Right to Life Conventions, Inc., 501c(4), EIN: 52–1257773;

==History==

===National Conference of Catholic Bishops: 1968–73===
In 1966 the National Conference of Catholic Bishops (NCCB) asked James T. McHugh to begin observing trends in the reform of policy on abortion. At the time then McHugh was Director of the United States Catholic Conference (USCC) Family Life Bureau, and later became the Bishop of Camden and then of Rockville Centre. The NCCB asked McHugh during its annual conference in April 1967 to organize the National Right to Life Committee (NRLC) and fund the established NRLC with $50,000 to &quot;initiate and coordinate a program of information&quot; with state affiliates that would inform stakeholders of the wave of proposed state legislation to liberalize statutes prohibiting abortion.

The National Right to Life Committee was formalized in 1968. McHugh hired executive assistant Michael Taylor to help with the day-to-day needs of the organization. In October 1968, they published the first NRLC newsletter formally introducing the organization and providing information on the efforts to change abortion laws. On the state level, independent right to life organizations were beginning to form and began to rely on NRLC for direction and information. The newsletter lasted until 1971.

NRLC held its first meeting of nationwide anti-abortion leaders in Chicago, Illinois in 1970 at Barat College. New Jersey attorney Juan Ryan served as the first President of NRLC. In the following year NRLC held its first convention at Macalester College in Saint Paul, Minnesota.

&quot;The only reason that we have a pro-life movement in this country is because of the Catholic people and the Catholic Church&quot;, stated the executive director of NRLC James T. McHugh in 1973.

===Incorporation and Human Life Amendment===
The NRLC was formally incorporated in May 1973, in response to the &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; ruling of the US Supreme Court and the desire to gain autonomy apart from the Catholic Church, to attract more Protestants to the organization. The National Conference of Catholic Bishops launched a campaign to amend the United States Constitution by enacting a Human Life Amendment that not only invalidated &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; but also prohibited both the US Congress and the States from legalizing abortion in the United States. Its first convention as an incorporated organization was held the following month in Detroit, Michigan. At the concurrent meeting of NRLC&#x27;s Board, Ed Golden of New York was elected president. Among the founding members was Mildred Jefferson, the first African-American woman to graduate from Harvard Medical School. Jefferson subsequently served as president in 1975.

===Schisms===
Erma Clardy Craven spoke out against the increasing alignment of anti-abortion groups and the American right.

In 1978, NRLC found itself $100,000 in debt after Jefferson&#x27;s presidency. Rather than acknowledge her record, she left the organization to form the Right to Life Crusade. On April 1, 1979, the American Life League (ALL) was founded by Judie Brown, former public relations director of NRLC, and 9 others after a schism within the NRLC.

=== Media publicity ===
Since its incorporation, the NRLC prioritized its politics over getting publicity due to its concern of being portrayed in a poor light and lack of funds. By 1980 NRLC&#x27;s annual budget increased to $1,600,000 and retained a membership of 11 million, allowing the organization to invest in media strategy and establish its media department in 1984. By 1985, the organization had a communications department that produced and distributed a radio program, media campaigns, and maintained press connections. Its media strategy worked to create a public image that differentiated the NRLC from allies by using medical professionals, including its president and primary spokesperson John Willke. One hallmark of their media campaign was utilizing the slogan &quot;Love them Both&quot; which embraces claims of women&#x27;s rights and welfare through compassion to gain the support of those ambivalent on the issue.

In 1995, the NRLC coined the term &quot;partial-birth abortion&quot; to describe a new medical procedure also known as &quot;dilation and extraction,&quot; or D&amp;X, and &quot;intact D&amp;E&quot; in which the fetus is removed intact from the uterus after 20 weeks gestation. The organization illustrated and published drawings of the procedure in booklets and paid newspaper advertisements to generate public opposition to both the procedure and abortion in general. The NRLC criticized Bill Clinton&#x27;s 1995 veto of a bill that would ban the procedure. The phrase was used by Congress in the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003.

In 1992 and 1998, &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine recognized the NRLC as the most publicly recognized and politically effective anti-abortion organization. In 1999, &quot;Fortune&quot; ranked them as the 8th most influential public policy group working in Washington, DC.

===&quot;The Silent Scream&quot;===
In 1984 the Committee co-produced the documentary &quot;The Silent Scream&quot; on abortion with Bernard Nathanson. In 1985, following 2 years of a boycott of a product of the Upjohn Company that NRLC coordinated, the Company ceased all research on abortifacient drugs. Three years later, NRLC joined other anti-abortion organizations in saying that if any company sold an abortifacient drug, the millions of Americans who opposed abortion would boycott all the products of that company.

===NRLC boycott of Hoechst Marion Roussel and Altace===
In the 1990s the NRLC began a nationwide grassroots lobbying campaign against the Freedom of Choice Act, and announced a boycott of the French pharmaceutical company Roussel Uclaf and its American affiliates for permitting its abortion drug, mifepristone, into the United States. The U.S. National Right to Life Committee announced a 1994 U.S. boycott of all Hoechst pharmaceutical products including Altace, targeting the abortion pill RU-486.

According to Keri Folmar, the lawyer responsible for the language of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, the term &quot;partial-birth abortion&quot; was developed in early 1995 at a meeting of herself, Charles T. Canady, and NRLC lobbyist Douglas Johnson. The phrase elicited strong negative reactions from a focus group and became a key phrase in NRLC&#x27;s attack on abortion.

=== Campaign financing ===
In 1978, James Bopp was hired to serve as legal counsel and the NRLC became more involved in elections to further influence state and federal legislation to advance their anti-abortion position. In 1980, the National Right to Life Political Action Committee (NRL PAC) was founded to support anti-abortion candidates, mostly Republicans. Also that year, Bopp led a walkout of conservative delegates from a White House Conference on Families and defended the NRLC&#x27;s 1980 presidential election voter guides from legal challenges of improper electioneering by a nonprofit.

By the 1990s, the NRLC became a major player in campaign financing through its $2 million campaign contributions in the 1996 presidential election. In 1999, the NRLC aggressively lobbied against the 1999 Shays-Meehan bill, which later became the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), because it would reclassify many of its and other nonpartisan groups&#x27; ads as campaign contributions. A bipartisan group of legislators including John McCain, Ronnie Shows, and Zach Wamp criticized the organization for getting involved in issues that did not affect the unborn. Legislative Director Douglas Johnson defended the NRLC&#x27;s involvement in campaign financing, saying that the bill &quot;would cripple the prolife movement.&quot;

In 2003, Bopp filed a lawsuit on behalf of the NRLC against the Federal Election Commission about whether BCRA violates the First Amendment in its prohibition of the use of &quot;soft money&quot; in campaign financing. On May 1, 2003, the district court issued judgment on the case and the NRLC appeals to the Supreme Court. Later that year, the case was consolidated along with eleven other lawsuits into &quot;McConnell v. FEC.&quot; In the ruling, the Supreme Court upheld the control of soft money and the regulation of electioneering communications in BCRA.

The death of Justice William Rehnquist and retirement of Justice Sandra Day O’Connor changed the Supreme Court to a conservative majority, and in 2007 NRLC&#x27;s affiliate Wisconsin Right to Life brought a case against the FEC again challenging BCRA provisions. In &quot;FEC v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc&quot;., the justices held that issue ads may not be banned from the months preceding a primary or general election.

=== Model legislation strategy ===
At the national and state level, NRLC writes model legislation that lawmakers can utilize in bills to restrict or ban abortion. Their legislation is written with the composition of the Supreme Court in mind, so that the court would be less likely to block it afterwards. For instance, when Justice Anthony Kennedy was on the bench, bills were introduced that would ban abortion after 20 weeks. After the conservative Gorsuch, Barrett and Kavanaugh were appointed, legislations began to pass trigger laws.

Prior to the ruling on &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot;, NRLC released model legislation that bans all abortions unless &quot;necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman&quot;. Enforcement strategies of the legislation include criminal penalties for anyone aiding or abetting a person seeking an abortion, selling or distributing of abortifacients, and transporting a pregnant minor to obtain an abortion.

====In cases of rape====
In 2022, responding to reports that a 10-year-old rape victim obtained an abortion, the group&#x27;s general counsel James Bopp said that the group&#x27;s proposed legislation would have banned that abortion; he also said that they believed she should have carried the baby, and &quot;as many women who have had babies as a result of rape, we would hope that she would understand the reason and ultimately the benefit of having the child.&quot;

==Affiliates==
NRLC has affiliates in all fifty states and over 3,000 local chapters.

Its Virginia affiliate, the Virginia Society for Human Life, was founded in 1967 as the first state right to life organization. Other early affiliates include Georgia Right to Life.

<text>The Family Procedure Rules (previously Family Proceedings Rules), often abbreviated FPR, govern the procedures used in family courts in England and Wales. The Family Procedure Rules 2010 were introduced by Statutory Instrument and are effective 6 April 2011.

Part 7 (Paragraph 75) of the Courts Act 2003 states that &quot;Family Procedure Rules are to be made by a committee known as the Family Procedure Rule Committee&quot;, and specifies who should be on that committee. The Courts Act also states, &quot;Family Procedure Rules may modify the rules of evidence as they apply to family proceedings in any court within the scope of the rules&quot;.

The Family Procedure Rules 2010 are split into 36 parts, together with the Practice Directions, certain Pre Action Protocols and a complete set of Forms. They are intended to modernise and standardise family court practice across the High Court, County Court and Magistrates’ Court.

<text>The pressure-fed engine is a class of rocket engine designs. A separate gas supply, usually helium, pressurizes the propellant tanks to force fuel and oxidizer to the combustion chamber. To maintain adequate flow, the tank pressures must exceed the combustion chamber pressure.

Pressure fed engines have simple plumbing and have no need for complex and occasionally unreliable turbopumps. A typical startup procedure begins with opening a valve, often a one-shot pyrotechnic device, to allow the pressurizing gas to flow through check valves into the propellant tanks. Then the propellant valves in the engine itself are opened. If the fuel and oxidizer are hypergolic, they burn on contact; non-hypergolic fuels require an igniter. Multiple burns can be conducted by merely opening and closing the propellant valves as needed. If the pressurization system also has activating valves, they can be operated electrically, or by gas pressure controlled by smaller electrically operated valves.

Care must be taken, especially during long burns, to avoid excessive cooling of the pressurizing gas due to adiabatic expansion. Cold helium won&#x27;t liquify, but it could freeze a propellant, decrease tank pressures, or damage components not designed for low temperatures. The Apollo Lunar Module Descent Propulsion System was unusual in storing its helium in a supercritical but very cold state. It was warmed as it was withdrawn through a heat exchanger from the ambient temperature fuel.

Spacecraft attitude control and orbital maneuvering thrusters are almost universally pressure-fed designs.
Examples include the Reaction Control (RCS) and the Orbital Maneuvering (OMS) engines of the Space Shuttle orbiter; the RCS and Service Propulsion System (SPS) engines on the Apollo Command/Service Module; the SuperDraco (in-flight abort) and Draco (RCS) engines on the SpaceX Dragon 2; and the RCS, ascent and descent engines on the Apollo Lunar Module.

Some launcher upper stages also use pressure-fed engines. These include the Aerojet AJ10 and TRW TR-201 used in the second stage of Delta II launch vehicle, 
and the Kestrel engine of the Falcon 1 by SpaceX.

The 1960s Sea Dragon concept by Robert Truax for a big dumb booster would have used pressure-fed engines.

Pressure-fed engines have practical limits on propellant pressure, which in turn limits combustion chamber pressure. High pressure propellant tanks require thicker walls and stronger materials which make the vehicle tanks heavier, thereby reducing performance and payload capacity. The lower stages of launch vehicles often use either solid fuel or pump-fed liquid fuel engines instead, where high pressure ratio nozzles are considered desirable.

Other vehicles or companies using pressure-fed engine:
*OTRAG (rocket)
*Quad (rocket) of Armadillo Aerospace
*XCOR EZ-Rocket of XCOR Aerospace
*Masten Space Systems
*Aquarius Launch Vehicle
*NASA&#x27;s Project Morpheus prototype lander
*NASA Mighty Eagle mini lunar lander
*CONAE&#x27;s Tronador II upper stage
*Copenhagen Suborbitals&#x27; Spica

<doc id="1295437" wikidata="Q476562" url="?curid=1295437" title="Georges Henri Halphen">
<text>Georges-Henri Halphen (; 30 October 1844, Rouen – 23 May 1889, Versailles) was a French mathematician. He was known for his work in geometry, particularly in enumerative geometry and the singularity theory of algebraic curves, in algebraic geometry. He also worked on invariant theory and projective differential geometry.

==Biography==
He did his studies at École Polytechnique (X 1862), where he graduated in 1866. He continued his education at École d&#x27;Application de l&#x27;Artillerie et du Génie de Metz. As a lieutenant of Artillery he was sent Auxonne first and then to Strasbourg. In 1872, Halphen settled in Paris, where he became a lecturer at the École Polytechnique and began his scientific studies. He completed his dissertation in 1878. In 1872 he married Rose Marguerite Aron, with whom he had eight children, four sons and four daughters. Of the four sons, three joined the military and two of them died in World War I. Louis Halphen (1880-1950) was a French historian specialized in medivial times; Charles Halphen (1885-1915), was deputy secretary of the Société mathématique de France. One of his grandsons was Étienne Halphen (1911–1954), who did significant work in applied statistics.

==Awards==
Georges-Henri Halphen received in the Steiner prize of the Prussian Academy of Sciences in 1882 along with Max Noether. In 1881 Halphen received the Grand Prix of the &quot;Académie des sciences&quot; for his work on linear differential equations: &quot;Mémoire sur la Reduction des Equations Différentielles Linéaires aux Formes Intégrales&quot;. He received the &quot;Prix Poncelet&quot; in 1883 and the &quot;Prix Petit d&#x27;Ormoy&quot; in 1885. He was elected to the &quot;Académie des sciences&quot; in 1886 in the &quot;Section de Géométrie&quot;, replacing the deceased Jean Claude Bouquet. In 1887 Halphen was elected to the Accademia dei Lincei in Rome.

==Works==
* &quot;Oeuvres de G.H. Halphen&quot;, in 4 vols. edited by Camille Jordan, Henri Poincaré, Charles Émile Picard with assistance from Ernest Vessiot, 1916, 1918, 1921, 1924, Paris, France: Gauthier-Villars
* &quot;Traité des fonctions elliptiques et de leurs applications&quot;, 3 vols., 1886, 1888, 1891 (in vol. 2 applications to physics, geometry, the theory of integrals, and geodesy; in vol. 3 applications to algebra, especially the quintic equation, number theory — vol. 3 consists merely of fragments)

An overview of Halphen&#x27;s work is provided by Laurent Gruson and a complete list of the works was compiled by Camille Jordan as part of Halphen&#x27;s obituary in &quot;Journal de Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées&quot;.

<doc id="1295452" wikidata="Q2659136" url="?curid=1295452" title="Gas-generator cycle">
<text>The gas-generator cycle, also called open cycle, is one of the most commonly used power cycles in bipropellant liquid rocket engines. 

Propellant is burned in a gas generator (or &quot;preburner&quot;) and the resulting hot gas is used to power the propellant pumps before being exhausted overboard and lost. Because of this loss, this type of engine is termed open cycle. 

The gas generator cycle exhaust products pass over the turbine first. Then they are expelled overboard. They can be expelled directly from the turbine, or are sometimes expelled into the nozzle (downstream from the throat) for a small gain in efficiency. 

The main combustion chamber does not use these products. This explains the name of the open cycle. The major disadvantage is that this propellant contributes little to no thrust because they are not injected into the combustion chamber. The major advantage of the cycle is reduced engineering complexity compared to the staged combustion (closed) cycle. 

== Examples ==
*RD-107, RD-108—Soviet engine type developed in the 1950s, used on R-7 family vehicles including the active Soyuz-2.
*F-1—RP-1/LOX engine used on the first stage of Saturn V. Most powerful single combustion chamber liquid-fueled engine ever flown.
*J-2—Upper stage LH2/LOX engine developed in the 1960s and used on Saturn V.
*RS-27A—American RP-1/LOX engine first flown in 1990.
*Vulcain—A family of European first stage engines using LH2/LOX flown on Ariane 5 and Ariane 6.
*Merlin—RP-1/LOX engine developed by SpaceX for Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy, used on both first and second stages.
*RS-68—LH2/LOX engine built in the 1990s by Aerojet Rocketdyne. Largest hydrogen-fueled rocket engine ever flown.
*CE-20—Indian LH2/LOX engine developed in the 2010s for use on the LVM3 launch vehicle.
*YF-20—Chinese N2O4/UDMH engine developed in the 1990s and used on Long March 2, 3, and 4.
*TQ-12—LCH4/LOX engine developed by LandSpace. First flew in 2022 on Zhuque-2.

<text>Box-drawing characters, also known as line-drawing characters, are a form of semigraphics widely used in text user interfaces to draw various geometric frames and boxes. These characters are characterized by being designed to be connected horizontally and/or vertically with adjacent characters, which requires proper alignment. Box-drawing characters therefore typically only work well with monospaced fonts.

In graphical user interfaces, these characters are much less useful as it is more simple and appropriate to draw lines and rectangles directly with graphical APIs. However, they are still useful for command-line interfaces and plaintext comments within source code.

Some recent embedded systems also use proprietary character sets, usually extensions to ISO 8859 character sets, which include box-drawing characters or other special symbols.

Other types of box-drawing characters are block elements, shade characters, and terminal graphic characters; these can be used for filling regions of the screen and portraying drop shadows.

==Unicode==
===Box Drawing===
Unicode includes 128 such characters in the Box Drawing block. In many Unicode fonts, only the subset that is also available in the IBM PC character set (see below) will exist, due to it being defined as part of the WGL4 character set.

The image below is provided as a quick reference for these symbols on systems that are unable to display them directly:
===Block Elements===
The Block Elements Unicode block includes shading characters. 32 characters are included in the block.
===Symbols for Legacy Computing===
In version 13.0, Unicode was extended with another block containing many graphics characters, Symbols for Legacy Computing, which includes a few box-drawing characters and other symbols used by obsolete operating systems (mostly from the 1980s). Few fonts support these characters (one is Noto Sans Symbols 2), but the table of symbols is provided here:
The image below is provided as a quick reference for these symbols on systems that are unable to display them directly:

===Symbols for Legacy Computing Supplement===
In version 16.0 (September 2024), Unicode was extended with another block containing many graphics characters, Symbols for Legacy Computing Supplement, which includes a few box-drawing characters and other symbols used by obsolete operating systems (mostly from the 1970s and 1980s).
==Platform-specific==
Various different platforms defined their own unique set of box-drawing characters.

===DOS===
The hardware code page of the original IBM PC supplied the following box-drawing characters, in what DOS now calls code page 437. This subset of the Unicode box-drawing characters is thus included in WGL4 and is far more popular and likely to be rendered correctly:
The integral halves are also box drawing as they are used alongside 0xB3:
Their number is further limited to 28 on those code pages that replace the 18 characters that combine single and double lines, the left and right half blocks, as well as integral halves with other, usually alphabetic, characters (such as code page 850):
Note: The non-double characters are the thin (light) characters (U+2500, U+2502), not the bold (heavy) characters (U+2501, U+2503).

Some OEM DOS computers supported other character sets, for example the Hewlett-Packard HP 110 / HP Portable and HP 110 Plus / HP Portable Plus, where in a modified version of the character set box-drawing characters were added in reserved areas of their normal HP Roman-8 character set.

===Unix, CP/M, BBS===
On many Unix systems and early dial-up bulletin board systems the only common standard for box-drawing characters was the VT100 alternate character set (see also: DEC Special Graphics). The escape sequence codice_1 switched the codes for lower-case ASCII letters to draw this set, and the sequence codice_2 switched back:

On some terminals, these characters are not available at all, and the complexity of the escape sequences discouraged their use, so often only ASCII characters that approximate box-drawing characters are used, such as - (hyphen-minus), | (vertical bar), _(underscore), =(equal sign) and + (plus sign) in a kind of ASCII art fashion.

Modern Unix terminal emulators use Unicode and thus have access to the line-drawing characters listed above.

===Teletext===
The World System Teletext (WST) uses pixel-drawing characters for some graphics. A character cell is divided in 2×3 regions, and 26 = 64 code positions are allocated for all possible combinations of pixels. These characters were added to the Unicode standard in Version 13.

===Historical===
Many microcomputers of the 1970s and 1980s had their own proprietary character sets, which also included box-drawing characters. Many of these were added to Unicode as Symbols for Legacy Computing.

====Commodore====

Commodore machines, such as the Commodore PET and the Commodore 64, included a set of text semigraphics with block elements and dithering patterns in the PETSCII character set.
====Sinclair====
The Sinclair ZX80, ZX81, and ZX Spectrum included a set of text semigraphics with quadrant-based block elements. The ZX80 and ZX81 also included a set of text semigraphics with dithering patterns.
====BBC and Acorn====
The BBC Micro could utilize the Teletext 7-bit character set, which had 128 box-drawing characters, whose code points were shared with the regular alphanumeric and punctuation characters. Control characters were used to switch between regular text and box drawing.

The BBC Master and later Acorn computers have the soft font by default defined with line drawing characters.

====Amstrad====
The Amstrad CPC character set also has soft characters defined by default as block and line drawing characters.

The CP/M Plus character set used on various Amstrad computers of the CPC, PCW and Spectrum families included a rich set of line-drawing characters as well:

====Apple====
MouseText is a set of display characters for the Apple IIc, IIe, and IIGS that includes box-drawing characters.

==Encoding==
On many platforms, the character shape is determined programmatically from the character code.

* ZX Spectrum block characters:
* Amstrad CPC block characters:
* Amstrad CPC line characters:
* BBC Master line characters:
* Teletext block characters:

However, DOS line- and box-drawing characters are not ordered in any programmatic manner, so calculating a particular character shape needs to use a look-up table.

==Examples==

<doc id="1295472" wikidata="Q5584953" url="?curid=1295472" title="Gordon Campbell, Baron Campbell of Croy">
<text>Gordon Thomas Calthrop Campbell, Baron Campbell of Croy, (8 June 1921 – 26 April 2005) was a British Conservative politician and diplomat.

== Biography ==
=== Early life and career ===
Campbell was born in Quetta, British India (now in Pakistan), the son of Major General James Alexander Campbell and was educated at Rockport School in Holywood, County Down, then at Wellington College before joining the Royal Artillery in 1939. He fought in the Second World War with the Royal Artillery from 1940, winning the Military Cross and Bar. Invalided out in 1947 with the honorary rank of major, he served the Foreign Office in New York and Vienna until 1957.

=== House of Commons ===
Elected to Parliament in 1959, he served as Member of Parliament for the constituency of Moray and Nairn until February 1974 when he was defeated by Winnie Ewing of the Scottish National Party. He served as a Government Whip, 1961–62; Lord Commissioner of the Treasury and Scottish Whip, 1962–63; Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, 1963–64. He was Opposition Spokesman on Defence, 1967–68 and a member of the Shadow Cabinet, 1969–70.

=== Secretary of State for Scotland ===
He was Secretary of State for Scotland during the whole of Edward Heath&#x27;s government. During his term in office the issues of fishing and oil led to him losing his Moray coastal seat to the SNP. Government papers released under the 30 year rule reveal an attitude that may explain that loss. Papers from 1970 revealed how the Scottish Office was prepared to have a &quot;weaker and less efficient national fleet&quot; to enable the UK to sign up to the controversial Common Fisheries Policy. On oil in 1972 Campbell was against any move to pump oil revenues directly into the Scottish economy despite Heath asking government departments to explore such an arrangements to help revive Scotland&#x27;s economy with &quot;its own resources&quot;. Further papers from 1974 revealed how he proposed &quot;exceptional measures&quot; to force Shetland Islands Council to accept an oil terminal without financial benefit to the islands.

=== House of Lords ===
After being defeated by Winnie Ewing of the Scottish National Party at the February 1974 general election, Campbell was made a life peer as Baron Campbell of Croy, of Croy in the County of Nairn on 9 January 1975. He became Chairman of the Scottish Board in 1976, and was Vice President of the Advisory Committee on Pollution at Sea from 1976 to 1984.

===Personal life===
He married Nicola Madan, daughter of Geoffrey Spencer Madan and his wife Marjorie Noble, and had three children. 
* Hon. Colin Ian Calthrop Campbell b. 1950
* Colonel Hon. Alastair James Calthrop Campbell (6 Jan 1952 – 24 Aug 2021)
* Hon. Christina Marjorie Campbell b. 1953.

The Campbell family lived at Holme Rose at Croy in the Nairn Valley. In 2019, the property was put on the market for £2.3 million.

<doc id="1295476" wikidata="Q5895100" url="?curid=1295476" title="Hong Kong Time">
<text>Hong Kong Time (abbreviation: HKT; ) is the time in Hong Kong, observed at UTC+08:00 all year round. The Hong Kong Observatory is the official timekeeper of the Hong Kong Time. It is indicated as Asia/Hong_Kong in the IANA time zone database.

==Time standards==
In Hong Kong, Hong Kong Time is defined in the Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance (Cap 1), Laws of Hong Kong.

Section 67(2) of the Ordinance states that:

&quot;Hong Kong Time&quot; () means the time used for general purposes throughout Hong Kong namely, 8 hours, or such other period as may be determined by the Legislative Council by resolution under this subsection or under section 16 of the Oil (Conservation and Control) Ordinance (Cap 264), in advance of Universal Standard Time.

Currently, Hong Kong time is defined as UTC+08:00. The reference in section 67(2) to the Oil (Conservation and Control) Ordinance is actually a power given to the Legislative Council of Hong Kong to change Hong Kong Time for the purposes of conserving oil, i.e. to implement daylight saving time. However, no daylight saving time has been observed since 1979.

The Hong Kong Time was first set to Local Mean Time (GMT+07:36:42) on 1 January 1885 at 13:00 by the then Royal Observatory Hong Kong. In 1904, the Greenwich Mean Time was adopted as the basis for Hong Kong Time, the time was set at 8 hours in advance of Greenwich Mean Time. The current Coordinated Universal Time system was adopted as an official time standard on 1 January 1972. However, the legal Hong Kong Time still remained based on Greenwich Mean Time until it was changed to Universal Standard Time in 1998 after the Hong Kong handover.

==Timekeeping==
From 1885, Hong Kong Time was determined by astronomical observations at the Hong Kong Observatory using a 6-inch equatorial mount and a 3-inch Transit Circle. The time was announced to the general public, particularly mariners, by dropping a 6-feet diameter time ball from a mast exactly at 13:00 daily in front the Marine Police Headquarters Compound, where it is visible from the Victoria Harbour. In January 1908, the time ball was relocated to the hill of Blackhead Point where it had even higher visibility. With the rise of radio broadcast and the launching of Radio Hong Kong in 1922, the importance of the time ball decreased. It was decommissioned on 30 June 1933.

During the Second World War, the equatorial mount and transit circle were lost. After the war, a pendulum clock was installed and regulated by radio time signals from other timekeeping centres. Timing accuracy gradually improved from the daily engineering tolerance of a few seconds to one-fifth of a second.

In 1966, the pendulum clock in the Royal Observatory Hong Kong was replaced by a crystal oscillator timing system. In the same year, the Royal Observatory started to broadcast the time directly with a 6-pip time signal on 95 MHz. This continued until 16 September 1989.

In 1980, the Royal Observatory adopted a timing system based on a Caesium beam atomic clock. This system narrowed the engineering tolerance down to less than 1 millisecond. The frequency standard of the clock is based on the primary standard used by Japan&#x27;s Communications Research Laboratory. In 1994, the atomic clock was replaced with a newer model.

Current Hong Kong Time can be obtained from the Observatory&#x27;s Network Time Server .

==Daylight Saving==

Hong Kong adopted daylight saving measures in 1941. However, the practice eventually declined in popularity and was eliminated after 1979.

<text>Max Johann Sigismund Schultze (25 March 1825 – 16 January 1874) was a German microscopic anatomist noted for his work on cell theory.

==Biography==

Schultze was born in Freiburg im Breisgau (Baden), son of the anatomist Karl August Sigismund Schultze (1795–1877). He studied medicine at Greifswald and Berlin, and was appointed an associate professor of anatomy at the university of Halle in 1854. Five years later he became a full professor of anatomy and histology and director of the Anatomical Institute at the University of Bonn. He died in Bonn on 16 January 1874; his successor at the anatomical institute being Adolph von La Valette-St. George. He was the older brother of obstetrician Bernhard Sigmund Schultze (1827–1919).

He founded, in 1865, and edited the important &quot;Archiv für mikroskopische Anatomie&quot;, to which he contributed many papers, and he advanced the subject generally, by refining on its technical methods. His works included:
*&quot;Beiträge zur Naturgeschichte der Turbellarien&quot; (1851).
*&quot;Uber den Organismus der Polythalamien&quot; (1854).
*&quot;Beiträge zur Kenntnis der Landplanarien&quot; (1857).
*&quot;Zur Kenntnis der elektrischen Organe der Fische&quot; (1858).
*&quot;Ein heizbarer Objecttisch und seine Verwendung bei Untersuchungen des Blutes&quot;, (In 1865 Schultze provided the first accurate description of the platelet).
*&quot;Zur Anatomie und Physiologie der Retina&quot; (1866).

His name is especially known for his work on cell theory. Uniting Félix Dujardin&#x27;s conception of animal sarcode with Hugo von Mohl&#x27;s of vegetable protoplasma, he pointed out their identity, and included them under the common name of protoplasm, defining the cell as a nucleated mass of protoplasm with or without a cell wall (&quot;Das Protoplasma der Rhizopoden und der Pflanzenzellen; ein Beiträg zur Theorie der Zelle&quot;, 1863).

Schultze studied medicine with the naturalist Fritz Müller, a German biologist and doctor who became a naturalized Brazilian. It was mainly because of his friendship and correspondence with Schultze that Müller to some extent was able to follow the debate in Europe about Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution. Schultze periodically sent him scientific literature, among which was Darwin&#x27;s &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;, and a small microscope manufactured in Berlin, by Friedrich Wilhelm Schiek (1857). Thanks to this microscope, Müller hypothesized from his own studies that &quot;all higher Crustacea probably will be traceable to a Zoea ancestor&quot;. Based on these studies Müller also wrote his book &quot;Für Darwin&quot;, in defense of Darwin&#x27;s theories, corroborating the theory of natural selection.

Swedish pathologist Axel Key studied under Schultze from 1860 to 1861 in Bonn.

<text>Thomas Harvey &quot;Sean&quot; Bonniwell (August 16, 1940 – December 20, 2011) was an American singer-songwriter/guitarist, who was known as the creative force behind the 1960s garage rock band, The Music Machine.

Bonniwell was quoted in Richie Unterberger&#x27;s 1998 book, &quot;Unknown Legends of Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, as saying &quot;Rock and roll was a teenager in the &#x27;60s, and I used that climate to express my confusion, my anger, at the injustice of the world.&quot;

==Life and career==
===Early years to 1960s===
Bonniwell was born in San Jose, California. During his teens, Bonniwell was inspired to form a high school vocal group after hearing the song &quot;Only You&quot; by The Platters. After high school, Bonniwell&#x27;s first serious musical incarnation was that of clean-cut pop-folk guitarist for the quartet The Wayfarers. The Wayfarers released three albums under the RCA label.

As the folk music craze died out, Bonniwell sought to create music with &quot;fuzz and fangs&quot;. In 1965, he formed a trio called The Ragamuffins, which quickly grew into The Music Machine. Adopting Beatles-style moptop hair and all-black outfits (and Bonniwell&#x27;s signature single black leather glove), Music Machine churned out a diversified style of garage rock. After the band&#x27;s debut album spawned the successful single &quot;Talk Talk&quot; (1966), the original line-up broke apart. Bonniwell continued on with Music Machine, now signed to Warner Bros. Records and renamed The Bonniwell Music Machine (1967). Unhappy with the way things were going, Bonniwell sold the rights to the band name to his label to be released from their contract.

In 1969, along with Mosaic Tweed and a duo consisting of Brad Truitt and Billy Woodruff, he was signed to the talent roster of Kevin Deverich and Associates run by Kevin Deverich.
Also that year, Bonniwell released a solo album (&quot;Close&quot;) on Capitol Records. This recording marked a change in identity for Bonniwell, who not only chose to make gentle, sensitive music (contrasting that for which he was known), but also chose to record under the name of T.S. Bonniwell. The recording received minor label support and displeased Bonniwell enough that he left the music industry altogether. He entered a period of spiritual quest and internal soul-searching, grew a beard, sold everything he owned, and drove around the US in a Volkswagen bus.

===1990s to 2000s===
In 1996, Bonniwell self-published a memoir called &quot;Talk Talk,&quot; which was later revised and re-titled &quot;Beyond The Garage,&quot; published by the independent publisher Christian Vision. Several years later, Sundazed Music put out previously unreleased Music Machine material from the 1960s, along with demo recordings from The Ragamuffins. Bonniwell claimed to have written over 300 songs since 1970.

In November 2004, Bonniwell embarked on his first European Tour, performing his hits with musicians from the US and Europe.

In 2006, Bonniwell recorded his first new material in several years, as a guest musician appearing on a self-titled debut album by The Larksmen, a garage rock group from Los Angeles, California. He appeared on two songs entitled &quot;Burn Like A Boy&quot; (actually written back in 1967 for The Music Machine but never released) and &quot;Out Of Darwin&#x27;s Mind&quot;.

==Death==
Bonniwell died on December 20, 2011, in Visalia, California, from lung cancer. He was 71 years old.

<doc id="1295508" wikidata="Q1259773" url="?curid=1295508" title="Morlachs">
<text>Morlachs (; ; ) is an exonym used for a rural Christian community in Herzegovina, Lika and the Dalmatian Hinterland. The term was initially used for a bilingual Vlach pastoralist community in the mountains of Croatia from the second half of the 14th until the early 16th century. Then, when the community straddled the Venetian–Ottoman border until the 17th century, it referred only to the Slavic-speaking people of the Dalmatian Hinterland, Orthodox and Catholic, on both the Venetian and Turkish side. The exonym ceased to be used in an ethnic sense by the end of the 18th century, and came to be viewed as derogatory, but has been renewed as a social or cultural anthropological subject. As the nation-building of the 19th century proceeded, the Vlach/Morlach population residing with the Croats and Serbs of the Dalmatian Hinterland espoused either a Croat or Serb ethnic identity, but preserved some common sociocultural outlines.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;Morlach&quot; is derived from the Italian &quot;Morlacco&quot; (), used by the Venetians to refer to the Vlachs from Dalmatia since the 15th century. The name &quot;Morovlah&quot; appears in Dubrovnik records in the mid-14th century, while in the 15th century, the abbreviated form &quot;Morlah&quot;, &quot;Morlak&quot; or &quot;Murlak&quot; is found in both Dubrovnik and Venice archives. Two main theories have been put forward to explain the origin of the term.

The first one has initially been proposed by the 17th-century Dalmatian historian Johannes Lucius, who suggested that Morlach would have been derived from the Byzantine Greek Μαυροβλάχοι, &quot;Maurovlachoi&quot;, meaning &quot;Black Latins&quot; (from , &quot;mauro&quot;, meaning &quot;dark&quot;, &quot;black&quot;), that is &quot;Black Vlachs&quot;. Lucius based his theory on the &quot;Doclean Chronicle&quot;, which he published and promoted. He explained that the choice made by the Venetians to use this name was made to distinguish the Morlachs from the &quot;White Latins&quot;, who would have been the inhabitants of the former Roman coastal cities of Dalmatia. This theory has had a strong echo in Romanian historiography, and Romanian scholars such as and Ela Cosma have suggested that the term &quot;Morlachs&quot; also meant &quot;Northern Vlachs&quot;, derived from the Indo-European practice of indicating cardinal directions by colors. Petar Skok suggested that while the Latin &quot;maurus&quot; is derived from the Greek &quot;μαύρος&quot; (&quot;dark&quot;), the diphthongs &quot;au&quot; &gt; &quot;av&quot; indicates a specific Dalmato-Romanian lexical remnant.

The other theory, mostly suggested by Croatian historiography of the previous centuries, states that &quot;Morlachs&quot; means &quot;Vlachs near the sea&quot;, from the Serbo-Croatian &quot;more&quot; (&quot;sea&quot;), and &quot;vlah&quot; (&quot;vlach&quot;). The first reference to this theory comes from the 18th-century priest Alberto Fortis, who wrote extensively about the Morlachs in his book &quot;Viaggio in Dalmazia&quot; (&quot;Journey to Dalmatia&quot;, 1774).

==Origin and culture==
The Morlachs are first mentioned in Dalmatian documents from the 14th century, but after the Ottoman conquest of Bosnia in 1463 and especially from the 16th century onwards, &quot;Morlach&quot; was used by the Venetians to refer usually to the Ottoman population from the Dalmatia Hinterland, across the border from Venetian Dalmatia, regardless of their ethnic, religious or social belonging. While their name implies some relation to the Romance-speaking Vlachs, travel accounts from the 17th and 18th century attest that the Morlachs were linguistically Slavs. The same travel accounts indicate that the Morlachs were mostly of the Eastern Orthodox faith, though some were also Roman Catholic. According to Dana Caciur, the Morlach community from the Venetian view, as long as they share a specific lifestyle, could represent a mixture of Vlachs, Croats, Serbs, Bosnians and other people.

Fortis spotted the physical difference between Morlachs; those from around Kotor, Sinj and Knin were generally blond-haired, with blue eyes, and broad faces, while those around Zadvarje and Vrgorac were generally brown-haired with narrow faces. They also differed in nature. Although they were often seen by urban dwellers as strangers and &quot;those people&quot; from the periphery, in 1730 &quot;provveditore&quot; Zorzi Grimani described them as &quot;ferocious, but not indomitable&quot; by nature, Edward Gibbon called them &quot;barbarians&quot;, and Fortis praised their &quot;noble savagery&quot;, moral, family, and friendship virtues, but also complained about their persistence in keeping to old traditions. He found that they sang melancholic verses of epic poetry related to the Ottoman occupation, accompanied with the traditional single stringed instrument called gusle. Fortis gave translation of folk song Hasanaginica at the end of his book. Manfred Beller and Joep Leerssen identified the cultural traits of the Morlachs as being part of the South Slavic and Serb ethnotype.

They made their living as shepherds and merchants, as well as soldiers. They neglected agricultural work, usually did not have gardens and orchards besides those growing naturally, and had for the time old farming tools, Lovrić explaining it as: &quot;what our ancestors did not do, neither will we&quot;. Morlach families had herds numbering from 200 to 600, while the poorer families around 40 to 50, from which they received milk, and made various dairy products.

Contemporary I. Lovrić said that the Morlachs were Slavs who spoke better Slavic than the Ragusans (owing to the growing Italianization of the Dalmatian coast). Boško Desnica (1886–1945), after analysing Venetian papers, concluded that the Venetians undifferentiated the Slavic people in Dalmatia and labeled the language and script of the region as &quot;Illirico&quot; (Illyrian) or &quot;Serviano&quot; [&quot;Serbian,&quot; particularly when referring to the language of the Morlachs or Vlachs in Dalmatia]. Language, idiom, characters/letters are always accompanied by the adjective Serb or Illyrian, when it is a matter of the military always is used term &quot;cavalry (cavalleria) croata&quot;, &quot;croato&quot;, &quot;militia (milizia) croata&quot; while the term &quot;Slav&quot; (schiavona) was used for the population. Lovrić made no distinction between the Vlachs/Morlachs and the Dalmatians and Montenegrins, whom he considered Slavs, and was not at all bothered by the fact that the Morlachs were predominantly Orthodox Christian. Fortis noted that there was often conflict between the Catholic and Orthodox Morlachs.
However some of Morlachs have passed to Islam during Turkish occupation Mile Bogović says in his book that records of that time referred entire population along the Turkish-Venetian border in Dalmatia as Morlachs. Many historians, mostly Serbian, used the name &quot;Morlak&quot; and simply translate it as Serb. Almost the only difference among the Morlachs was their religious affiliation: Catholic or Orthodox.

In his book, &quot;Viaggio in Dalmazia&quot;, Fortis presented the poetry of the Morlachs. He also published several specimens of Morlach songs. Fortis believed that the Morlachs preserved their old customs and clothes. Their ethnographic traits were traditional clothing, use of the gusle musical instrument accompanied with epic singing. Fortis&#x27; work started a literary movement in Italian, Ragusan and Venetian literature: Morlachism, dedicated at the Morlachs, their customs and several other aspects of them.

On Krk island, where a community was settled from the 15th century, two small samples of the language were recorded in 1819 by the local priest from Bajčić in the forms of Lord&#x27;s Prayer and Hail Mary, as shown below:
“&quot;Cače nostru, kirle jesti in če&quot;r

&quot;Neka se sveta nomelu tev&quot;

&quot;Neka venire kraljestvo to&quot;

&quot;Neka fiè volja ta, kasi jaste in čer, asa si prepemint&quot;

&quot;Pire nostre desa kazi da ne astec&quot;

&quot;Si lasne delgule nostre, kasisi noj lesam al delsnic a nostri&quot;

&quot;Si nun lesaj in ne napasta&quot;

&quot;Nego ne osloboda de rev. Asasifi.&quot;”
&quot;&quot;Sora Maria pliena de milosti Domnu kutire&quot; 

&quot;Blagoslovitest tu intre mulierle, si blagoslovituj ploda dela utroba ta Isus&quot; 

&quot;Sveta Maria, majula Domnu, rogè Domnu za noj akmoče si in vrajme de morte a nostru. Asasif!&quot;&quot;

==History==

===Early history===
The use of &quot;Morlachs&quot; is first attested in 1344, when &quot;Morolacorum&quot; are mentioned in lands around Knin and Krbava during the conflict between the counts of the Kurjaković and Nelipić families. The first mention of the term &quot;Morlachs&quot; is simultaneous with the appearance of Vlachs in the documents of Croatia in the early 14th century; in 1321, a local priest on the island of Krk granted land to the church (&quot;to the lands of Kneže, which are called Vlach&quot;), while in 1322 Vlachs were allied with Mladen Šubić at the battle in the hinterland of Trogir. According to Mužić in those early documents there is no identifiable differentiation between the terms Vlach and Morlach. In 1352, in the agreement in which Zadar sold salt to the Republic of Venice, Zadar retained part of the salt that &quot;Morlachi&quot; and others exported by land. In 1362, the &quot;Morlachorum&quot;, settled, without authorization, on lands of Trogir and used it for pasture for a few months. In the Statute of Senj dating to 1388, the Frankopans mentioned &quot;Morowlachi&quot; and defined the amount of time they had for pasture when they descended from the mountains. In 1412, the &quot;Murlachos&quot; captured the Ostrovica Fortress from Venice. In August 1417, Venetian authorities were concerned with the &quot;Morlachs and other Slavs&quot; from the hinterland, who were a threat to security in Šibenik. Authorities of Šibenik in 1450 gave permission to enter the city to Morlachs and some Vlachs who called themselves Croats who were in the same economic and social position at that time.

According to scholar Fine, the early Vlachs probably lived on Croatian territory even before the 14th century, being the progeny of romanized Illyrians and pre-Slavic Romance-speaking people. During the 14th century, Vlach settlements existed throughout much of today&#x27;s Croatia, from the northern island Krk, around the Velebit and Dinara mountains, and along the southern rivers Krka and Cetina. Those Vlachs had, by the end of the 14th and 15th century, lost, their Romance language, or were at least bilingual. As they adopted Slavic language, the only characteristic &quot;Vlach&quot; element was their pastoralism. The so-called Istro-Romanians continued to speak their Romance language on the island of Krk and villages around Lake Čepić in Istria, while other communities in the mountains above the lake preserved the Shtokavian-Chakavian dialect with Ikavian accent from the southern Velebit and area of Zadar. Today&#x27;s Istro-Romanians may be a residual branch of the Morlachs.

The Istro-Romanians, and other Vlachs (or Morlachs), had settled Istria (and mountain Ćićarija) after the various devastating outbreaks of the plague and wars between 1400 and 1600, reaching the island of Krk. In 1465 and 1468, there are mentions of &quot;Morlach&quot; judge Gerg Bodolić and &quot;Vlach&quot; peasant Mikul, in Krk and Crikvenica, respectively. In the second half of the 15th century, Catholic Morlachs (mostly Croatian Vlachs) migrated from the area of southern Velebit and Dinara area to the island of Krk, together with some Eastern Romance-speaking population. The Venetian colonization of Istria (and Ćićarija) occurred not later than the early 1520s, and there were several cases when &quot;Vlachs&quot; returned to Dalmatia.

===16th century===
Although the first Ottoman invasion of Croatia took place in the early 15th century, the threat to Dalmatian towns began only after the conquest of Bosnia in 1463. During the Ottoman–Venetian war of 1499-1502, a considerable demographic shift took place in the Dalmatian hinterland, leading to the abandonment of many of the region settlements by their previous inhabitants. During the years following the Ottoman conquest of Skradin and Knin in 1522, local Ottoman rulers started to resettle the depopulated areas with their Vlach subjects. Referred to as Morlachs in the Venetian records, the newcomers to Šibenik hinterland () came from Herzegovina and among them, three Vlach clans (katuns) predominated: the Mirilovići, the Radohnići, and the Vojihnići. 

At the same time, the Austrian Empire established the Military Frontier, which served as a buffer zone against Ottoman incursions. Thus, other Vlachs, Slavicized Vlachs and Serbs fled the Ottomans and settled in this area. As a consequence, Vlachs were used by both the Ottomans on one side, and Austria and Venice on the other.

From the 16th century onwards, the name &quot;Morlach&quot; became specifically used by the Venetians to refer the any inhabitant of the hinterland, as opposed to those of the coastal towns, in an area stretching from the north of Kotor to the Kvarner Gulf region. In particular, the area around the Velebit mountain range was largely populated by Morlachs, to the extent that the Venetians called it &quot;Montagne della Morlacca&quot; (&quot;mountain of the Morlachs&quot;), while they used the name &quot;Canale della Morlacca&quot; to designate the Velebit Channel.

Between the end of the War of Cyprus in 1573 and the start of the Cretan War in 1645, trading relations between the Venetian Republic and the Ottoman Empire improved significantly. As the border region between the two, Dalmatia became a dynamic center of these relations. In particular, Morlachs from the hinterland played an important role in trade, bringing corn, meat, cheese and wool to towns like Šibenik, and buying fabrics, jewelry, clothing, delicacies and, above all, salt. During this period, a significant number of Morlachs immigrated to the Venetian side near Šibenik, either temporarily or permanently. These migrations were mainly in search of employment as soldiers or servants, or through &quot;mixed&quot; marriages. Most of these Morlach migrants came from the areas of Zagora, Petrovo Polje, the Miljevci plateau and the Cetina valley.

In 1579, several groups of &quot;Morlachs&quot; immigrated and requested to be employed as military colonists. Initially, there were some tensions between these immigrants and the established Uskoks. In 1593, &quot;provveditore generale&quot; (Overseer) Cristoforo Valier mentioned three nations constituting the Uskoks: the &quot;natives of Senj, Croatians, and Morlachs from the Turkish parts&quot;.

===17th century===
At the time of the Cretan War (1645–69) and Morean War (1684–99), a large number of &quot;Morlachs&quot; settled inland of the Dalmatian towns, and Ravni Kotari of Zadar. They were skilled in warfare and familiar with local territory, and served as paid soldiers in both Venetian and Ottoman armies. Their activity was similar to that of the Uskoks. Their military service granted them land, and freed them from trials, and gave them rights which freed them from full debt law (only 1/10 yield), thus many joined the so-called &quot;Morlach&quot; or &quot;Vlach&quot; armies.

At the time, some notable Morlach military leaders who were also enumerated in epic poetry, were: Janko Mitrović, Ilija and Stojan Janković, Petar, Ilija and Franjo Smiljanić, Stjepan and Marko Sorić, Vuk Mandušić, Ilija Perajica, Šimun Bortulačić, Božo Milković, Stanislav Sočivica, and Counts Franjo and Juraj Posedarski. Divided by religion, the Mitrović-Janković family were the leaders of Orthodox Morlachs, while the Smiljanić family were leaders of Catholic Morlachs.

After the dissolution of the Republic of Venice in 1797, and loss of power in Dalmatia, the term Morlach would disappear from use.

== Legacy ==
During the time of Enlightenment and Romanticism, Morlachs were seen as the &quot;model of primitive Slavdom&quot;, and the &quot;spirits of pastoral Arcadia &quot;Morlacchia&quot;&quot;. They attracted the attention of travel writers like 17th-century Jacob Spon and Sir George Wheler, and 18th-century writers Johann Gottfried Herder and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who labeled their poems as &quot;Morlackisch&quot;. In 1793, at the carnival in Venice, a play about Morlachs, &quot;Gli Antichi Slavi&quot; (&quot;antique Slavs&quot;), was performed, and in 1802 it was reconceived as a ballet &quot;Le Nozze dei Morlacchi&quot;. At the beginning of the 20th century, still seen as relics from the primitive past and a byword for barbarous people, they may have inspired science fiction novelist H. G. Wells in his depiction of the fictional Morlocks. Thomas Graham Jackson described Morlach women as half-savages wearing &quot;embroidered leggings thet give them the appearance of Indian squaws&quot;. In the 20th century, Alice Lee Moqué, as did many other women travelers, in her 1914 travelogue &quot;Delightful Dalmatia&quot; emphasized the &quot;barbaric gorgeousness&quot; of the sight of Morlach women and men in their folk costumes, which &quot;made Zara&#x27;s Piazza look like a stage setting&quot;, and regretted the coming of new civilization.

In the Balkans, the term became derogatory, indicating people from the mountains and backward people, and became disliked by the Morlachs themselves. 

Italian cheese Morlacco, also named as Morlak, Morlach, Burlach, or Burlacco, was named after Morlach herders and woodsmen who lived and made it in the region of Monte Grappa. &quot;Morlacchi&quot; remains attested as an Italian family name.

<text>Misty Dawn Marie Hyman (born March 23, 1979) is an American former competition swimmer, Olympic gold medalist, and former world record-holder. Hyman won the gold medal in the women&#x27;s 200-meter butterfly at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney.

In March 1996, she just missed making the U.S. Olympic team for the 1996 Games, finishing third and fourth at the U.S. Olympic Trials in the 100- and 200-meter butterfly events.

Hyman competed as a member of the U.S. Finswimming Team at the 8th World Championship held in Hungary during August 1996.

At the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, Hyman was only expected to contend for silver in women&#x27;s 200-meter butterfly on the night of September 20, 2000, as Australian Susie O&#x27;Neill was expected to repeat her title (O&#x27;Neill had been undefeated in the 200-meter butterfly for the previous 6 years; and was swimming in her home country). Hyman was so shocked that she looked at the scoreboard three times just to make sure that she had won. Hyman&#x27;s victory was largely credited to her expert use of the very difficult fish kick on turns.

Also in 2000, Hyman was ranked 35th in the world in the 50-meter butterfly, twelfth in the 100-meter butterfly, and second in the 200-meter butterfly.

==Personal==

Hyman graduated from Shadow Mountain High School in Phoenix, Arizona. She attended Stanford University, under Hall of Fame Coach Richard Quick where she swam for the Stanford Cardinal swimming and diving team with Jessica Foschi. During this time, she befriended Chelsea Clinton, who was watching in the stands in Sydney when Hyman won gold. She twice received the Honda Sports Award for Swimming and Diving, recognizing her as the outstanding college female swimmer of the year in 1997–98 and again in 2000–01. She graduated from Stanford in 2002 and earned an MBA in Hospitality at Les Roches University in Switzerland.

In 2009, Hyman returned to Shadow Mountain High School and was appointed the Head Swim Coach. She would later be awarded the &quot;Coach of the Year&quot; award later that season. Hyman switched to part-time coaching at SMHS in 2011.

Hyman swam at AFOX under head coach and swim improver Bob Gillett. He was not there to see her swim, but her performance in the &quot;golden&quot; swim is among his biggest accomplishments.

In 1984, Hyman was diagnosed with asthma.

On November 19, 2009, it was announced that Hyman would be teaching private swim instructions as a part of the fitness team at the Sanctuary on Camelback Resort. Now, she has built her own pool and teaches there as well as the Sanctuary in her home state of Arizona in Paradise Valley, working with people at all levels of performance ability.

In 2015, Hyman was named an assistant coach at Arizona State University&#x27;s swimming and diving team.

<doc id="1295520" wikidata="Q560778" url="?curid=1295520" title="Eugene Podkletnov">
<text>Eugene Podkletnov (, Yevgeny Podkletnov) is a Russian ceramics engineer known for his claims made in the 1990s of designing and demonstrating gravity shielding devices consisting of rotating discs constructed from ceramic superconducting materials.

==Background and education==
Podkletnov graduated from the University of Chemical Technology, Mendeleyev Institute, in Moscow; he then spent 15 years at the Institute for High Temperatures in the Russian Academy of Sciences. He received a doctorate in materials science from Tampere University of Technology in Finland. After graduation he continued superconductor research at the university, in the Materials Science department, until his expulsion in 1997. After which he moved back to Moscow where it is reported that he took an engineering job. Since leaving Tampere in 1997 Podkletnov has avoided public contact or appearances. There is a report that he later returned to Tampere to work on superconductors at Tamglass Engineering Oy.

==Gravity shielding==
According to the account Podkletnov gave to &quot;Wired&quot; reporter Charles Platt in a 1996 phone interview, during a 1992 experiment with a rotating superconducting disc:
:&quot;Someone in the laboratory was smoking a pipe, and the pipe smoke rose in a column above the superconducting disc. So we placed a ball-shaped magnet above the disc, attached to a balance. The balance behaved strangely. We substituted a nonmagnetic material, silicon, and still the balance was very strange. We found that any object above the disc lost some of its weight, and we found that if we rotated the disc, the effect was increased.&quot;

===Public controversy===
Podkletnov&#x27;s first peer-reviewed paper on the apparent gravity-modification effect, published in 1992, attracted little notice. In 1996, he submitted a longer paper, in which he claimed to have observed a larger effect (2% weight reduction as opposed to 0.3% in the 1992 paper) to the &quot;Journal of Physics D&quot;. According to Platt, a member of the editorial staff, Ian Sample, leaked the submitted paper to Robert Matthews, the science correspondent for the British newspaper, the &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot;.

On September 1, 1996, Matthews&#x27;s story broke, leading with the startling statement: &quot;Scientists in Finland are about to reveal details of the world&#x27;s first anti-gravity device.&quot; In the ensuing uproar, the director of the laboratory where Podkletnov was working issued a defensive statement that Podkletnov was working entirely on his own. Vuorinen, listed as the paper&#x27;s coauthor, disavowed prior knowledge of the paper and claimed that the name was used without consent. Podkletnov himself complained that he had never claimed to block gravity, only to have reduced its effect.

Podkletnov withdrew his second paper after it had been initially accepted. The resulting uproar over the alleged claims in the withdrawn paper is reported to be the primary reason for his expulsion from his lab and the termination of his employment at the university.

===Attempted verification===
In a 1997 telephone interview with Charles Platt, Podkletnov insisted that his gravity-shielding work was reproduced by researchers at universities in Toronto and Sheffield, but none have come forward to acknowledge this. The Sheffield work is known to have only been intended as partial replication, aimed at observing any unusual effects which might be present, since the team involved lacked the necessary facilities to construct a large enough disc and the ability to duplicate the means by which the original disc was rotated. Podkletnov counters that the researchers in question have kept quiet &quot;lest they be criticized by the mainstream scientific community&quot;. Podkletnov is reported to have visited the Sheffield team in 2000 and advised them on the conditions necessary to achieve his effect, conditions that they never achieved.

In a BBC news item, it was alleged that researchers at Boeing were funding a project called GRASP (Gravity Research for Advanced Space Propulsion) which would attempt to construct a gravity shielding device based on rotating superconductors, but a subsequent &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; news item stated that Boeing had denied funding GRASP with company money, although Boeing acknowledged that it could not comment on &quot;black projects&quot;. It is alleged that the GRASP proposal was presented to Boeing and Boeing chose not to fund it.

In July 2002, an article by Nick Cook in &quot;Jane&#x27;s Defence Weekly&quot; reported about Boeing&#x27;s internal project GRASP — Gravity Research for Advanced Space Propulsion to evaluate the validity of Podkletnov&#x27;s claims. The briefing obtained by &quot;Jane&#x27;s&quot; says &quot;If gravity modification is real, it will alter the entire aerospace business.&quot; The briefing allegedly says that Boeing, as well as BAE Systems and Lockheed Martin tried to approach Podkletnov directly and that &quot;Podkletnov is strongly anti-military and will only provide assistance if the research is carried out in the &#x27;white world&#x27; of open development.&quot;

<doc id="1295522" wikidata="Q7650337" url="?curid=1295522" title="Sutton Valence">
<text>Sutton Valence (in the past also called Sudtone, Town Sutton and Sutton Hastings, see below) is a village about five miles (8 km) SE of Maidstone, Kent, England on the A274 road going south to Headcorn and Tenterden. It is on the Greensand Ridge overlooking the Vale of Kent and Weald. St Mary&#x27;s Church is on the west side of the village on Chart Road, close to the junction of the High Street with the A274. Another landmark is Sutton Valence Castle on the east side of the village, of which only the ruins of the 12th-century keep remain, under the ownership of English Heritage.

==History==

Iron Age and Roman artefacts have been found in the area. The Roman road from Maidstone to Ashford and Lympne passed through the village.

===Saxon era – Before the Battle of Hastings===
The earliest mention of a settlement at Sutton Valence was in 814, when Coenwulf mentioned &quot;Suinothe&quot; in a charter. Before the Battle of Hastings in 1066, the manor was owned by Leofwine Godwinson, brother of Harold who was to become King of England in 1066 and be defeated by William the Conqueror.

===After 1066===
In 1086 the village is recorded in the Domesday Book under the name of Sudtone (South Town, or Sutton), granted to Adam FitzHubert who held it from Odo Bishop of Bayeux, the half-brother of William the Conqueror. Domesday also records a Church of St. Mary in Sudtone, which may have been built of wood in about 1070. The manor was then granted to the Count of Aumale, Baldwin of Bethune, who built a castle, the remains of its keep or tower can be seen on the east side of the village.

In 1212 Baldwin died and the manor passed to his daughter Alice. She married William Marshal the son of the Earl of Pembroke, the manor passing to him on her death in 1215 (the date of Magna Carta). At that time, William Marshal&#x27;s father was perhaps the most important noble in the land after the King and on the death of King John, became Protector of the young king Henry III and Regent of the Realm.

In 1221 a Royal charter was granted by Henry III allowing the village to hold a fair annually. William Marshal&#x27;s son William the second earl then married Eleanor, daughter of King John and sister of his son Henry III (Eleanor was a child bride, aged nine). After the death of the Second Earl, she married Simon de Montfort, who rebelled at the lax rule of Henry III, won the Battle of Lewes but was killed at the Battle of Evesham in 1265, his estates being confiscated by the Crown.

In 1265 after the Battle of Evesham Henry III gave the manor and castle to his half-brother William de Valence, as a reward for his support during the de Montfort rebellion. The village of Sutton then became known as Sutton Valence after the town in France where William de Valence was born. Some of the de Valence Household Accounts have survived and show that the family often travelled between their estates. In 1296–7, Joan de Valence (William’s wife) stayed at eight different residences, including a month at Sutton Valence. In 1307 William&#x27;s son, Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke inherited the manor and according to the Household Accounts, stayed at Sutton Valence in June 1315. In the mid-14th century the manor passed to the Hastings family and became known as Sutton Hastings.

St Mary&#x27;s Church

In the 14th century, the church was rebuilt using the local ragstone a grey limestone, possibly quarried in Boughton Monchelsea between Sutton Valence and Maidstone

===15th–16th centuries===
In 1401, the manor was one of those sold to provide a ransom for the release of Baron Grey of Ruthin who had been captured by Owain Glyndŵr the Welsh leader who rebelled against King Henry IV and is mentioned in the Shakespeare play of that name. In 1418 the manor passed to the Clifford family. In 1548 the manor was sold to the Filmer family, who retained ownership until the early 20th century.

St Mary&#x27;s Church.

A William Lambe was baptised at St Mary&#x27;s in the late 15th century and died in 1522. His will dated 1 July 1522 asked that his remains be placed in the church. In the SE corner of the church was a chapel dedicated to Saint Peter, which then became the Lambe Chapel. His grandson, also William, was a Citizen of the City of London and a member of the Worshipful Company of Clothworkers. He was a gentleman of the chapel to King Henry VIII and reputed to be a friend of the King. He clearly had wealth because later, in 1578, at &quot;his own proper costs and charges&quot;, he built a free grammar school in the village, allowing the Master £20 per year with &quot;a good house and garden to reside in&quot;, and a person called &quot;the Usher&quot; was allowed £10 per year.

Village Alms Houses. 

William Lambe also founded six alms-houses in the village with an orchard and gardens for the poor of the parish. He allotted £10 to be divided among them yearly, and entrusted the Company of Clothworkers with the management of this charity. The inhabitants were usually appointed by the master of the school. The arms of the founder, a &quot;fess between three cinquefoils&quot;, are carved in stone on the front of the alms-houses.

===18th and 19th centuries===

The Filmer family lent money for the construction of the turnpike road from Maidstone to Tenterden (the current A274). When gas became available and replaced candles and oil lamps, the Filmers encouraged the provision of a gas supply in the village. Many of the older buildings in the village are constructed from &quot;ragstone&quot; which was quarried locally at Boughton Monchelsea between the village and Maidstone.

===Local windmills===
The Sutton Valence Town Mill was a Smock mill built about 1720.

In 1796 it was rebuilt and raised a storey following gale damage in which the cap and sails were blown off.

In 1918 it was again damaged in a gale, and was worked into the 1930s by an engine rather than its sails.

In 1945 it was demolished, leaving the base standing. An additional weatherboarded storey was added to the base and it was converted into a house.

Another windmill also stood at Five Wents to the north of Sutton Valence, but was demolished by 1875.

===St Mary&#x27;s Church===
In 1825 an earlier church was rebuilt, the Worshipful Company of Clothworkers contributing the sum of £20 towards the rebuilding.
1827 - the Clothworkers Company gave £20 towards a gallery at the west end, in the front of which the pupils of the grammar school had seats.

1866 - the Clothworkers contributed £10 towards a memorial window at the east end in memory of Rev. F. Walter.

1872 - the Clothworkers gave £21 towards an organ on the north side of the chancel.

1874 - the Clothworkers gave what was called at the time a &quot;munificent sum&quot; of 300 guineas towards further alterations.

=== World War I and after ===
In 1916 the Filmer family connection with Sutton Valence ended when Robert Filmer was killed in France.

Following his death, property in Sutton Valence was sold at auction.

The Filmer family kept East Sutton Park until 1939.

=== World War 2 ===

During the Second World War the residents of Watts&#x27; Almshouses, Rochester were evacuated to a Georgian house in the village called Eylesden.

Pilot Officer Shaw memorial

On 3 September 1940 at the height of the Battle of Britain, Hurricane aircraft P3782 flown by Pilot Officer Robert Henry Shaw crashed just south of Chart Road at Parkhouse Farm, killing the pilot, and there is a memorial at the edge of the field at the crash site.

The 100m contour (328 ft) passes E-W along the N side of Chart Road, along the West part of the Village High Street and East to the remains of the Castle tower. The ground rises to the North and the School sports ground to the East of the A274 is 125 m (410 ft) AMSL (Above Mean Sea Level). The ground falls steeply to the South, and the part of the Village called The Harbour is about 40 m (131 ft) AMSL. At the South end of Sutton Valence CP at Bardingley and the River Beult, the altitude falls to 16 m (52 ft) AMSL.

==Transport links==
Sutton Valence lies on the A274 road from Maidstone south to Headcorn and Tenterden and is linked by bus to each.

The nearest railway station to the village is , on the South Eastern Main Line to the Kent Coast and the Channel Tunnel via Ashford, and to London via Staplehurst, Paddock Wood and Tonbridge. Headcorn to London Bridge station takes about one hour and to Charing Cross, one hour and 10 minutes.

In 1904 Colonel Holman Stephens proposed the construction of an extension of the Kent &amp; East Sussex Railway line from Headcorn to Maidstone via Sutton Valence, but World War I intervened and it was never built.

==The Civil Parish==
 The Sutton Valence Civil Parish (CP) has an area of 859 Hectares. Its width varies between 1 and 2 km from East to West, and is about 6 km from North to South. A diagram is on the left, and the exact boundary is shown by a dotted black line on the Ordnance Survey 1:25,000 map.

===Sutton Valence CP features===
As well as the Village itself to the East of the A274, the CP includes, to the North, Warmlake and the S side of Five Wents; to the West, about 400m along Chart Road; to the East, the Castle and Stallance; to the South, Farthing Green, Babylon Lane and Bardingley down to the River Beult.

===Surrounding CPs===
To the West is Chart Sutton CP; to the South, Headcorn CP; to the East, E Sutton CP; to the NE. Broomfield and Kingswood CP; and to the NW, Langley CP.

==Local features==

Sutton Valence can be split into two parts. The principal and older part is at the top of the Greensand Ridge overlooking the Vale of Kent, the area known as &quot;The Harbour&quot; is to the South at the bottom of the hill, and many houses here were originally owned by the local authority.

The village has a garage on the A274, a school, post office, some shops and three working pubs. There is also a recreation ground next to the village hall.

Village pubs

The pubs are all in the High Street and are, from west to east, The King&#x27;s Head, the Queen&#x27;s Head and The Clothworkers Arms. The Swan Inn is further east along the High Street and is now a private house. The name &quot;Clothworkers Arms&quot; and the next door Clothworkers Cottage is because of the Village association with the London Company of Clothmakers that is mentioned above, particularly with reference to St Mary&#x27;s church and Almshouses.

War memorial

The village war memorial is on the SW side of the junction of the A274 with Chart Road and The High Street. It lists 29 soldiers from the First World War, two each from three of the same families. For World War II, nine soldiers are listed.

==Education==
Sutton Valence School, a leading independent school, is located in the north-west part of the village but also owns Art and Design Technology departments in the centre of the village. There is also Sutton Valence Primary School, which is nearby.

==Sport==
The school provides a venue for individual sporting activities. Sutton Valence Hockey Club play their home matches at Sutton Valence School.
Sutton Valence Village is a local football club. There is also a golf club.

==Sutton Valence Castle==

The site of the 13th-century castle is on the east side of the modern village and the ruined keep can be visited today. See the separate Wiki entry for Sutton Valence Castle.

<text>Demonax is a lunar impact crater near the southern limb of the Moon. This location makes the crater difficult to observe due to foreshortening. The crater is also illuminated at a very low angle, when it is in the sunlit side. Demonax lies just to the north of the crater Scott, one of the south polar formations. To the north-northwest is Boguslawsky.

This crater has a worn and eroded rim, with several small craters lying along the edge and the inner walls. The southeast rim in particular has a notable collection of impacts, including the satellite crater Demonax A which intrudes into the interior floor. The crater bottom has been resurfaced, leaving a flat, level floor. However, there is a group of central peaks near the midpoint, and the northern part of the floor is rough and hummocky. The remains of some s are visible along the western interior floor.

Due to the low angle of sunlight reaching this crater, the inner wall along the north side of the crater receives very little sunlight.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Demonax.

<text>Hugo von Mohl FFRS HFRSE (8 April 1805 – 1 April 1872) was a German botanist from Stuttgart. He was the first person to use the word &quot;protoplasm&quot;.

==Life==

He was a son of the Württemberg statesman (1766–1845), the family being connected on both sides with the higher class of state officials of Württemberg. While a pupil at the gymnasium, he pursued botany and mineralogy in his leisure time, until in 1823 he entered the University of Tübingen. After graduating with distinction in medicine he went to Munich, where he met a distinguished circle of botanists, and found ample material for research.

This seems to have determined his career as a botanist, and he started in 1828 those anatomical investigations which continued until his death. In 1832 he was appointed professor of botany in Tübingen, a post which he never left. Unmarried, his pleasures were in his laboratory and library, and in perfecting optical apparatus and microscopic preparations, for which he showed extraordinary manual skill. He was largely a self-taught botanist from boyhood, and, little influenced in his opinions even by his teachers, preserved always his independence of view on scientific questions. He received many honours during his lifetime, and was elected foreign fellow of the Royal Society in 1868.

The process of cell division as observed under a microscope was first discovered by Hugo von Mohl in 1835 as he worked on green algae &quot;Cladophora glomerata&quot;.

Mohl&#x27;s writings cover a period of forty-four years; the most notable of them were republished in 1845 in a volume entitled &quot;Vermischte Schriften&quot; (For lists of his works see &quot;Botanische Zeitung&quot;, 1872, p. 576, and &quot;Royal Soc. Catalogue&quot;, 1870, vol. iv.) They dealt with a variety of subjects, but chiefly with the structure of the higher forms, including both rough anatomy and minute histology. The word protoplasm was his suggestion; the nucleus had already been recognized by R. Brown and others; but Mohl showed in 1844 that the protoplasm is the source of those movements which at that time excited so much attention.

He recognized under the name of primordial utricle the protoplasmic lining of the vacuolated cell, and first described the behaviour of the protoplasm in cell division. These and other observations led to the overthrow of Schleiden&#x27;s theory of origin of cells by free-cell-formation. His contributions to knowledge of the cell-wall were no less remarkable; he held the view now generally adopted of growth of cell-wall by apposition. He first explained the true nature of pits, and showed the cellular origin of vessels and of fibrous cells; he was, in fact, the true founder of the cell theory. Clearly the author of such researches was the man to collect into one volume the theory of cell-formation, and this he did in his treatise &quot;Die vegetabilische Zelle&quot; (1851), a short work translated into English (Ray Society, 1852).

Mohl&#x27;s early investigations on the structure of palms, of cycads, and of tree ferns permanently laid the foundation of all later knowledge of this subject: so also his work on &quot;Isoetes&quot; (1840). His later anatomical work was chiefly on the stems of dicotyledons and gymnosperms; in his observations on cork and bark he first explained the formation and origin of different types of bark, and corrected errors relating to lenticels. Following on his early demonstration of the origin of stomata (1838), he wrote a classical paper on their opening and closing (1850).

In 1843 he started the weekly &quot;Botanische Zeitung&quot; in conjunction with Schlechtendal, which he edited jointly until his death. He was never a great writer of comprehensive works; no textbook exists in his name, and it would indeed appear from his withdrawal from co-operation in Hofmeister&#x27;s &quot;Handbuch&quot; that he had a distaste for such efforts. In 1850, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In his latter years his productive activity fell off, doubtless through failing health, and he died suddenly at Tübingen on 1 April 1872.

<text>Mello Yello is a highly caffeinated, citrus-flavored soft drink produced, distributed and created by the Coca-Cola Company that was introduced on March 12, 1979, to compete with PepsiCo&#x27;s Mountain Dew.

Mello Yello was withdrawn from Australia in the early 1990s, being replaced with the similar but uncaffeinated Lift.

In South Africa in the 1980s, Mello Yello became associated with Apartheid South African Police and their notorious canary-colored vehicles.

There have been three flavored variants of Mello Yello in North America. Mello Yello Cherry was released in response to Mountain Dew Code Red. The other two variants were Mello Yello Afterglow (peach-flavored) and Mello Yello Melon. All three were only available for a limited time. Mello Yello Cherry is available at Coca-Cola Freestyle machines and is still available in limited markets.

The caffeine content is 49.5 mg per serving ().
==Marketing==
Mello Yello was featured in the 1990 NASCAR-based movie &quot;Days of Thunder&quot;, in which Tom Cruise&#x27;s character, Cole Trickle, drove a Mello Yello-sponsored car to victory in the Daytona 500, although the product name itself is never verbally mentioned in the movie. That livery went on to become a real NASCAR paint scheme the following year, when driver Kyle Petty drove with Mello Yello sponsorship in the Winston Cup Series. He ran four seasons (1991–1994) with the sponsor before switching over to Coors Light in 1995. Mello Yello was seen as a sponsor on die-cast toy and collectible cars for both the Days of Thunder #51 Chevrolet Lumina and Kyle Petty&#x27;s #42 Pontiac Grand Prix. Mello Yello also sponsored the fall Winston Cup race at Charlotte Motor Speedway through 1994.

Mello Yello was also advertised in the Nashville-based Ernest commercials in which he coined the beverage&#x27;s official slogan &quot;Make The Mello Yello Move&quot;, followed by his trademark phrase, &quot;Knowhutimean?&quot;

In 1982, arcade manufacturer Gottlieb created but never released an edition of their successful arcade game Q*Bert with Mello Yello livery in-play as well as proposed cabinet artwork. The game has been preserved and is playable on the MAME arcade emulator.

In 2011, Mello Yello relaunched its ad campaign. The commercial featured cartoon adults who boarded a boat and made a band, singing &quot;Mellow Yellow&quot;.

In 2013, Mello Yello became the title sponsor of the NHRA&#x27;s professional drag racing circuit—the NHRA Mello Yello Drag Racing Series, as part of an extension of the Coca-Cola Company&#x27;s sponsorship. Fellow Coca-Cola brands Powerade and Full Throttle had previously served as title sponsors.

In December 2015, Mello Yello unveiled a new logo and packaging design, featuring a new stylized &quot;MY&quot; emblem in black on yellow. This logo was only used for the regular variant and the Mello Yello Zero. Mello Yello Cherry and Peach continued to use the previous logo until 2017.

==International relaunches==
In October 2006, Mello Yello was relaunched in New Zealand as a &#x27;limited edition&#x27; product after an absence of at least 15 years from the local market. The relaunched New Zealand version contained the original 1980s logo, and as when it was available in the 1980s included the words &quot;A Product of the Coca-Cola Company&quot; on the bottle top. This &#x27;limited edition&#x27; release was available in 600 ml and 1.5 litre plastic bottles and contained the words &quot;Limited Edition&quot;. Only 200,000 cases of the promo product were produced in 2006 according to Coca-Cola. Mello Yello was once again relaunched to the New Zealand market in October 2007 and was available until the end of 2007. It has now been relaunched in New Zealand again as &#x27;limited edition&#x27; for the summer months.

In late June 2011, Mello Yello was relaunched in Japan. Packaging in Japan carries a &#x27;Smooth Taste Smooth Times&#x27; slogan and a &#x27;Since 1983&#x27; badge on the side of cans and bottles. 

In Australia, the Mello Yello brand has returned during the 2012–2013 summer, with a 1980s era logo being used. This Mello Yello is not caffeinated. It is notable that Mountain Dew in Australia had not been caffeinated until about six months prior to this release.

In 1994, it was launched in Colombia by the Coca-Cola Company under the name of .

<text>Drygalski is a large lunar impact crater that lies along the southern limb of the Moon. It partly overlies the crater Ashbrook to the west on the far side of the Moon. Just to the north of Drygalski is the smaller Boltzmann. The location of this crater restricts its observation from the Earth, and even under conditions of favorable libration it is viewed from the edge. It is only illuminated by the Sun at an oblique angle, and it lies close to the south polar craters that are permanently shielded from sunlight.

The outer rim of this crater has been worn and eroded by subsequent impacts, leaving a rugged, mountainous ring that is overlaid in places by small craters. The most notable of these are Drygalski P across the southwest rim where it joins Ashbrook, and Drygalski V along the north-northwest inner wall. There is a small &quot;catena&quot;, or crater chain, beginning tangentially the northern outer rim then arcing to the north towards Boltzmann. To the south is an odd formation of two or more small craters, forming a short valley.

Portions of the interior floor within the inner walls is flat and level, having been resurfaced by lava. The flattest parts are in the southern and eastern sections of the interior. The surface is more rugged in the west, and is marked by several small craterlets. At the midpoint of the interior is a rugged central peak formation with several smaller ridges along the flanks.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Drygalski.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.

<doc id="1295574" wikidata="Q2898656" url="?curid=1295574" title="Hadleigh Castle">
<text>Hadleigh Castle is a ruined fortification in the English county of Essex, overlooking the Thames Estuary from south of the town of Hadleigh. Built after 1215 during the reign of Henry III by Hubert de Burgh, the castle was surrounded by parkland and had an important economic and defensive role. The castle was significantly expanded and remodelled by Edward III, who turned it into a grander property, designed to defend against a potential French attack, as well as to provide the King with a convenient private residence close to London. Built on a soft hill of London clay, the castle has often been subject to subsidence; this, combined with the sale of its stonework in the 16th century, has led to it now being ruined. The remains are now preserved by English Heritage and protected under UK law as a Grade I listed building and scheduled monument.

==History==
===13th century===
Hadleigh Castle was first built by Hubert de Burgh, the 1st Earl of Kent, who was a key supporter of King John. De Burgh was given the honour of Rayleigh by John in 1215 as a reward for his services, but chose not to develop the existing &quot;caput&quot; of Rayleigh Castle, instead building a new fortification south of the town of Hadleigh. The exact date of construction is uncertain, but it is now believed the work was conducted early in de Burgh&#x27;s tenure of the site, permission being retrospectively officially confirmed through a licence to crenellate in 1230 under Henry III.

The site was chosen on top of the South Essex south ridge, overlooking the Thames estuary, formed from generally soft deposits of London clay. In the 13th century, marshlands would have stretched away to the south of the castle, with the tide occasionally reaching up as far as the base of the hill itself, and the area would have been more wooded than today. By 1235 the park of Hadleigh had been formed around the castle, including woodland, a fishpond, stables and a park lodge, but the castle was also associated with a wider estate including Rayleigh, Thundersley and Eastwood Parks.

The first castle built on the site was probably of an octagonal design, running along the top of the ridge, protected by square and semi-circular mural towers, with a barbican guarding the eastern entrance. It probably resembled White Castle in Monmouthshire, remodelled by de Burgh in the same period, or Bolingbroke Castle in Lincolnshire and Beeston Castle in Cheshire, both built in the 1220s. The castle was built of Kentish ragstone and cemented by a mortar containing a large proportion of seashells, particularly cockleshells from the cockle beds of neighbouring Canvey Island. A valuable tidal watermill had been built by 1249, essential for making bread for the castle; recent archaeological work suggests that it was positioned on a wharf reaching out into the estuary just to the south-east of the castle. Terraced gardens were built along the south side of the castle overlooking the estuary, probably including vineyards.

De Burgh finally fell out of favour with Henry III; he was imprisoned and then finally stripped of Hadleigh Castle in 1239. For the rest of the century, Hadleigh was retained as a royal castle, as part of an estate containing of agricultural land, the park and the castle mill. By the 1250s, the castle had fallen into neglect and, despite some investment after it was given to Queen Eleanor in 1273, it remained in relatively poor condition. Only the mill, vital for the operation of the wider estate, appears to have been well-maintained. A new 17-metre-wide by 9-metre-long (56 foot by 30 foot) hall and an adjacent solar complex were built at the castle around 1290, but collapsed due to subsidence shortly afterwards. In 1299 the castle was given to Queen Margaret, who complained about the quality of the building and insisted that repairs were carried out. Her husband, Edward I, visited the castle twice, using it as a base for hunting in the area.

===14th century===

Edward II took a much closer interest in Hadleigh, leading to a period of renewal and rebuilding during his reign and that of his son, Edward III. Edward II first stayed there in 1311, and work was done to renovate the castle before he arrived, including building new royal quarters and repairing some of the castle walls that had succumbed to subsidence. Amongst the buildings known to be in the castle during the period were the castle hall, larder, kitchen, cellar, a long house, prison, an &quot;old chamber&quot; and armoury; they were guarded by a garrison of 24 soldiers during crises. Edward stayed there frequently during his reign up until 1324, on occasion travelling to Hadleigh Castle from London on his royal barge, which docked at a wharf to the south of the castle.

Edward III acquired Hadleigh Castle in 1330, when he recovered it from his mother, Isabella of France, who had taken it from Edward when she deposed him in 1326. Edward paid little initial interest to the castle, but in the 1360s decided to make much greater use of the property, ordering large parts of it to be rebuilt at a cost of more than £2200. Between 1361 and 1363 the internal buildings were renovated and new royal lodgings built along the south walls, after which the east side of the castle was rebuilt entirely, with two large circular towers installed in a new stretch of curtain wall, completed by 1365. The north side of the castle was rebuilt to include a main entrance with a portcullis and a drawbridge, protected by a barbican and a large circular tower called the &quot;High Tower&quot;, which was complete by 1370. The work was probably overseen by William of Wykeham.

Originally, historians believed that Edward&#x27;s decision to rebuild much of the castle was in response to the growing tensions with France; in this version of events, Hadleigh would have formed an important coastal fortification along the Thames estuary, protecting it from French raids. Current historical opinion plays down this motivation, noting that at the time of the work on Hadleigh relations with France were unusually good. Instead, it is suspected that the increasing elderly Edward intended Hadleigh more as a personal retreat close to London, where he could stay in privacy and considerable comfort. Whilst the entrance on the inland side remained relatively basic, the building work created a grander impression from the estuary – any visitors to London, English or French, would have passed by Queenborough Castle on the south bank and Hadleigh on the north, the combination communicating a strong sense of royal power.

===15th–19th centuries===

Edward III&#x27;s grandson, Richard II, made little use of Hadleigh, and the use of the castle was granted to Aubrey de Vere until his death in 1400. The castle was passed amongst a number of high-status owners during the 15th century, but saw little use by the crown. Edmund of Langley and his son Edward of Norwich, the Dukes of York, used the castle in the early years, before passing it on to Humphrey of Lancaster, the Duke of Gloucester. Richard, Duke of York, used the castle next, before it passed to Edmund Tudor in the middle of the century. The tradition of the castle forming part of the queen&#x27;s property was then reinstated and it was granted to Elizabeth Woodville, the wife of Edward IV. Henry VIII made no known use of the castle himself, but it formed part of the dower of three of his wives – Catherine of Aragon, Anne of Cleves, and Catherine Parr – and the castle&#x27;s parks were used as sources of timbers for his navy.

After 1544 the estate began to be broken up; first the parks were sold and then the castle itself, bought by Lord Richard Rich from Edward VI for £700 in 1551. Rich dismantled the castle for the value of its stone, primarily between 1551 and 1575, and the castle, now thoroughly ruined, passed through Rich&#x27;s descendants.
The English painter John Constable visited Hadleigh in 1814 and made a drawing of the castle as preparation for ten oil sketches and a single painting. The oil painting &quot;Hadleigh Castle&quot; was produced in 1829 and exhibited at the Royal Academy in the same year. One of the sketches is currently displayed at the Tate Gallery, London, while the painting now hangs in the Yale Center for British Art at New Haven, United States. Constable&#x27;s painting, &quot;one of his most monumental works&quot; according to the art historians Tammis Groft and Mary Mackay, depicts the early 19th-century Hadleigh Castle as a decaying, man-made structure, succumbing to the elemental power of nature.

William Booth purchased Hadleigh Castle and its surrounding site in 1891 for the use of the Salvation Army, which established a farm to train the English poor prior to them being sent overseas to the British colonies. Considerable subsidence and slippage on the ridge occurred between 1898 and 1923, causing a collapse of the southern curtain wall.

===Today===
The Salvation Army gave the castle to the Ministry of Works in 1948, and it is now owned by English Heritage, classed as a scheduled monument and a Grade I listed building. Subsidence and landslips have continued; the north-east tower largely collapsed in the 1950s, and further major slippages occurred in 1969, 1970, and 2002. One of the three-storey towers at the eastern side stands to nearly full height with narrow rectangular windows in the upper levels. The second tower has only about one-third of its original form. Some sections of the curtain wall have survived, as well as the foundations of the great hall, solars, and the kitchen.

The castle is still surrounded by the 19th-century Salvation Army farm, and beyond that by Hadleigh Country Park, owned and managed by Essex County Council and a Site of Special Scientific Interest with special regard for invertebrates. In 2008, Hadleigh Farm, close to the castle, was announced as the venue for the mountain biking competition in the 2012 Summer Olympics.

<doc id="1295578" wikidata="Q14593729" url="?curid=1295578" title="Lobosa">
<text>Lobosa is a taxonomic group of amoebae in the phylum Amoebozoa. Most lobosans possess broad, bluntly rounded pseudopods, although one genus in the group, the recently discovered &quot;Sapocribrum,&quot; has slender and threadlike (filose) pseudopodia. In current classification schemes, Lobosa is a subphylum, composed mainly of amoebae that have lobose pseudopods but lack cilia or flagella.

==Characteristics==
The group was originally proposed in 1861 by William B. Carpenter, who created it as a taxonomic order containing the single family Amoebina. Carpenter&#x27;s Lobosa consisted of amoeboid organisms whose endoplasm (endosarc) flows into lobe-like &quot;pseudopodian prolongations.&quot; This type of pseudopod, which was understood to be typical of the genus Amoeba &quot;and its allies,&quot; differed from the filose (thread-like) or reticulose (netlike) pseudopods of the Foraminifera. The name Lobosa was chosen for these amoebae &quot;as expressing the lobe-like character of their pseudopodial extensions&quot;.

As currently defined, the subphylum Lobosa includes both shelled (testate) and naked amoebae (gymnamoebae), but excludes some organisms traditionally regarded as &quot;lobosean&quot;, such as &quot;Pelomyxa&quot; and &quot;Entamoeba&quot; (Amoebozoa) and some Heterolobosea (Excavata).

==Phylogeny==
The subphylum Lobosa is paraphyletic, consisting of a grade of three clades: Discosea, Tubulinea and Cutosea. The first two are part of a paraphyletic superclass Glycopoda, while the latter constitutes the monophyletic superclass Cutosa. The clade uniting Tubulinea + Cutosea + Conosa is named Tevosa, while the clade uniting Cutosa + Conosa is named Evosea.

<text>Einstein is a large lunar impact crater that lies along the western limb of the Moon, which makes it difficult to observe from the Earth. The visibility of this formation is subject to libration effects, but even under the best conditions not much detail can be observed except from lunar orbit. Nearby craters of note include Moseley just to the north, Dalton along the eastern rim, Vasco da Gama just to the southeast, and Bohr to the south-southeast. The formation Vallis Bohr is visible to the south.

The outer rim of this walled plain has been strongly obliterated by many smaller impacts. Occupying the center of the interior floor is Einstein A, an impact crater with d inner walls and a central peak. The outer of this concentric crater spreads across the interior floor, covering over half the diameter of Einstein. Several smaller craters also lie scattered across the floor, but there are sections of relatively flat surface in the southwest part of the floor. Two small craters on the west side have fractured floors. These are believed to be secondary craters from the Orientale impact to the south.

The widespread notion that this crater was discovered by Patrick Moore in 1939 is probably erroneous. In the middle of the 20th century Hugh Percy Wilkins designated the crater &quot;Caramuel&quot; to honor Juan Caramuel y Lobkowitz. The crater was known under this unofficial name for some time, but neither this name, nor almost all of Wilkins&#x27; other nomenclature, were adopted by the International Astronomical Union. In 1963 E. Whitaker and D.W.G. Arthur named thie crater &quot;Einstein&quot; after Albert Einstein, and in 1964 this name was adopted by the IAU. Wilkins&#x27; map also contained a crater called Einstein, but it is a less prominent one – .

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Einstein.

<text>Hecataeus is a large lunar impact crater that lies near the eastern limb of the Moon. It is attached to the northern rim of the walled plain Humboldt. To the northeast is the smaller crater Gibbs. East of Hecataeus is a chain of small craters forming a line radial to Humboldt; these are designated the Catena Humboldt, named after the walled plain.

Hecataeus is a worn and eroded walled plain with wide inner walls. Its northern part overlies half of Hecataeus K, a fairly substantial crater. Along the southern rim, the outer of ejecta from Humboldt forms a rugged interior surface across the southern floor. Several small, bowl-shaped craters lay across the eastern rim and inner wall. The western rim is much less damaged by impacts, although it is still eroded. The northern part of the interior floor is relatively featureless.

The crater was named after Hecataeus of Miletus by the IAU in 1935.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Hecataeus.

<doc id="1295605" wikidata="Q333616" url="?curid=1295605" title="Peter Thomas, Baron Thomas of Gwydir">
<text>Peter John Mitchell Thomas, Baron Thomas of Gwydir, (31 July 1920 – 4 February 2008) was a British Conservative politician. He was the first Welshman to become Chairman of the Conservative Party, serving from 1970 to 1972, and the first Conservative to serve as Secretary of State for Wales, holding that office from 1970 to 1974.

==Early life and career==
Thomas was born in Llanrwst, where his father was a solicitor. He was educated at the village school, and then Epworth College in Rhyl, before reading law at Jesus College, Oxford. He joined the Royal Air Force (RAF) in 1939, on the outbreak of the Second World War. He was shot down while serving as a bomber pilot in 1941, and spent four years in prisoner-of-war camps in Germany, moving from Stalag Luft VI to Stalag Luft III and then at Stalag XI-B. He continued his legal studies while imprisoned, and was also an amateur actor.

He became a barrister after the war, and was called to the Bar in 1947 at Middle Temple. He practised on the Wales and Chester circuit, and took silk in 1965. He became deputy chairman of Cheshire quarter sessions in 1966, and then of Denbighshire quarter sessions in 1968, serving in both offices until 1970. He was a Crown Court recorder from 1974 to 1988, and also sat as an arbitrator on the Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris.

He was bilingual in Welsh and English, and took an active part in the Gorsedd, attending Eisteddfodau under the bardic name Pedr Conwy (Welsh: Peter from Conway).

==Marriage==

He married Tessa Dean in 1947. She was the daughter of actor, film, and theatrical producer Basil Dean and his wife, Lady Mercy Greville. His wife died in 1985, and he outlived both of their two sons. He was survived by his two daughters upon his death in February 2008 at the age of 87.

==Political career==
Thomas was elected to Parliament as MP for Conway in 1951, winning a narrow majority in the marginal seat over the Labour incumbent. He turned down the position of Under-Secretary of State for Wales at the Home Office to concentrate on his legal career but later served as Parliamentary private secretary to Sir Harry Hylton-Foster (the Solicitor General and later Speaker) from 1954 to 1959. He was a member of the Council of Europe from 1957 to 1959, and sponsored the private members bill that became the Eisteddfod Act 1959.

He served as Parliamentary Secretary at the Ministry of Labour 1959–61, taking charge of the measures that abolished the requirements for employees to be paid in cash and the maximum wage for a professional footballer (£14 per week in November 1960). He moved to become Under-Secretary of State at the Foreign Office in 1961, travelling to Moscow with Lord Home in 1963 to sign the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. He was promoted to Minister of State for Foreign Affairs in 1963, and was sworn of the Privy Council in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours of 1964, but left office when his party lost the 1964 general election. In opposition, he was a spokesman on foreign affairs and then law from 1965 to 1966. Although he had held his Conway seat (and steadily increased his majority) since 1951, he narrowly lost to Labour at the 1966 general election, but returned as MP for Hendon South at the general election in June 1970, a position which he held until retiring in 1987.

During the whole of Edward Heath&#x27;s premiership, he held the position of Secretary of State for Wales. He was Secretary of State during a period of violent activism by proponents of the Welsh language, including bombings and a campaign by the Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg (Welsh Language Society) to remove English road signs. In February 1971, paralleling plans to reorganise local government in England, Thomas announced the plans to replace the existing 181 local councils with 7 new county councils counties and 36 district councils. An extra county council was added later, for Cardiff. Thomas also served as Chairman of the Conservative Party between 1970 and 1972.

Thomas remained Welsh spokesman after the Conservative Party lost the general election in February 1974, but left the front bench when Margaret Thatcher became party leader in February 1975. He became active on backbench committees, and was president of the Conservative Friends of Israel. He retired from the House of Commons at the 1987 general election, and was raised to the peerage for life in the Dissolution Honours that year, gazetted as Baron Thomas of Gwydir, of Llanrwst in the County of Gwynedd.

<text>Lagrange is a lunar impact crater that is attached to the northwestern rim of the crater Piazzi. It lies near the southwestern limb of the Moon, and the appearance is oblong due to foreshortening. To the northwest of this feature is the Montes Cordillera, a ring-shaped mountain range that surrounds the immense Mare Orientale impact basin.

The southwestern half of this walled plain has been heavily damaged by the mass of ejecta from Mare Orientale. This material forms an irregular striation in the surface that is radial to the Mare Orientale basin. As a result, only the northeast part of the crater is somewhat intact; the remainder just forms an uneven depression in the surface that is covered in long ridges and gouges. The most notable feature in this section is the small bowl-shaped crater Lagrange D.

The surviving section of the rim is worn and eroded, forming an arc-shaped range of low ridges in the surface. The interior floor in this section is relatively level, but even this surface contains traces of the Mare Orientale ejecta.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Lagrange.

<text>Lamarck is a crater in the southwestern part of the Moon. The northern portion of the crater is overlain by the walled plain Darwin. To the southeast is Byrgius.

The outer wall of this formation has been heavily damaged by subsequent impacts, leaving a disintegrated rim that forms a low, irregular ridge in the surface. Parts of the crater are also overlain by ejecta from the Mare Orientale basin to the east. The most notable feature in the interior is the tiny, bowl-shaped impact crater Lamarck B. The remainder of the floor forms a rolling, uneven plain.

Attached to the southwestern rim is Lamarck A, a large but equally disintegrated crater. Lamarck D is a huge formation that lies to the west of Lamarck A. However, this last feature is also worn to the point where it is barely recognizable as a crater.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Lamarck.

<text>Le Gentil is a lunar impact crater that is located in the south-southwest part of the Moon, near the limb, and is nearly attached to the southern rim of the huge walled plain Bailly. To the southeast is the large crater Drygalski. Due to its location, this crater appears considerably foreshortened and is viewed from an oblique angle by observers on the Earth.

As a formation this crater has been deeply eroded by impacts, leaving a heavily worn formation that is little more than a depression in the surface. The rim exists as a circular, rolling ridge with indents and notches where small craters have gouged out the surface. The interior floor is covered in a multitude of tiny craterlets and two small craters: Le Gentil C and Le Gentil B. There is a smaller craterlet attached to the eastern rim of Le Gentil C.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Le Gentil.

<doc id="1295640" wikidata="Q62001484" url="?curid=1295640" title="Snap (card game)">
<text>Snap is a card game in which players deal cards and react quickly to spot pairs of cards of the same rank. Cards are either dealt into separate piles around the table, one per player, or (particularly when played with young children) into a single shared pile. The game may be a simplified version of the older Snip Snap Snorem.

==The game==
The pack of cards is dealt out among the players in face-down stacks as equally as possible. Play proceeds with the players taking it in turns to remove a card from the top of their stack and place it face-up on a pile alongside it. If two cards on the tops of any of these piles are ever identical (or, if a conventional pack of cards is used, are of the same number), the first player to shout &quot;Snap!&quot; takes both face-up piles and adds them to the bottom of their own stack. The player who accumulates all the cards wins.

A &quot;snap pool&quot; is created from matching stacks if two players shout &quot;Snap!&quot; at the exact same time, or from a player&#x27;s own stack if they shout &quot;Snap!&quot; in error. Players can shout &quot;Snap pool!&quot; instead of &quot;Snap!&quot; if the matching cards also match the pool, and may take the pool for doing so. (If multiple players call &quot;snap pool&quot;, the newly matching cards are also added to the pool.)

==Variations==
Cards can be played onto a single shared stack, and players call &quot;snap!&quot; if two consecutive cards on this pile are identical. This makes the game easier for younger children. In this version, players may race to call &quot;snap&quot; while slapping the central pile, making the game similar to Slapjack.

A variation called &quot;Menagerie&quot; assigns each player an animal, and requires players to shout the name of animal corresponding to the player who laid a matching card in order to win the pile.

The game is often one of the first card games to be taught to children and is often played with special packs of cards featuring popular children&#x27;s characters from television programmes or recent films.

==In popular culture==
In J. K. Rowling&#x27;s Harry Potter novels, including &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot;, Harry and his friends sometimes play a game called &quot;Exploding Snap&quot;, in which some of the cards will explode at random during the game.

In the &quot;Goon Show&quot;, Eccles will yell &quot;snap&quot;, sometimes during a poker game or while on the telephone.

== In other cultures ==
In Germany and Austria, the game is known as &quot;Schnipp-Schnapp&quot; or &quot;Spitz, pass auf!&quot;

<text>Somerville is a small lunar impact crater in the eastern part of the Moon. It lies to the east of the prominent crater Langrenus, and was designated Langrenus J before being given a name by the IAU. This is a roughly circular, bowl-shaped formation, with the larger but less conspicuous Langrenus H attached to the northwest rim. The rim has a protruding lip that extends slightly toward the southwest.

This is one of a handful of lunar craters named after a woman, Mary Somerville.

<doc id="1295649" wikidata="Q333652" url="?curid=1295649" title="Cledwyn Hughes, Baron Cledwyn of Penrhos">
<text>Cledwyn Hughes, Baron Cledwyn of Penrhos, (14 September 1916 – 22 February 2001) was a Welsh Labour Party politician, usually associated with the moderate wing of the party. He was also regarded, particularly in later years, as a non-political figure of stature in Wales having held posts of importance in bodies such as the University of Wales.

==Early life==
Cledwyn Hughes was born at 13 Plashyfryd Terrace, Holyhead, the elder son of Henry David Hughes and Emma Davies (née Hughes), who was a young widow with a son, Emlyn, when she remarried in 1915.

His father, widely known as Harri Hughes, had left school at the age of twelve to work in the Dinorwic quarry, as several generations of his family had done. Aged 21, he resumed his education and entered the Calvinistic Methodist ministry, serving as the minister of Disgwylfa Chapel in Holyhead from 1915 until his death in 1947. Harri Hughes was a prominent local Liberal and a strong supporter of Lady Megan Lloyd George, who served as the Liberal MP for Anglesey from 1929.

Cledwyn Hughes was educated at the Holyhead Grammar School and at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth, where he studied Law and became president of the Liberal Society. After graduating in 1937, he returned to Holyhead, and was articled to a local solicitor. As local unemployment deepened, and the Czechoslovak crisis intensified, he listened to local Independent Labour Party speakers, and joined the Labour party in 1938. His decision was also driven by the influence of the writings of R.H. Tawney and the Left Book Club. Like Tawney, he was a Christian socialist, and believed that socialism equated with fellowship. For many years, he regularly preached on Sundays in Anglesey&#x27;s chapels, even when serving as a cabinet minister.

Hughes qualified as a solicitor in 1940. During the Second World War, Hughes served in the RAFVR in an administrative role, achieving the rank of Flight Lieutenant.

==Early political career==
In 1944, local Labour activists urged him to stand in the post-war general election against Lady Megan Lloyd George, who had served as Liberal MP for the Anglesey constituency since 1929. Despite the resistance of his father, Hughes fought the 1945 election with very little organisational support. He made 50 speeches - 45 of them in Welsh, and came within 1,081 votes of victory.

Following demobilisation in 1946, Hughes returned to Holyhead to practise as a solicitor and was appointed acting clerk to Holyhead District Council. In 1946, he became the youngest member of Anglesey County Council when he was elected to represent the Kingsland Ward in Holyhead. He remained a county councillor until 1953 and maintained good relations with the County Council throughout his time as a Member of Parliament, and had some success in bringing employment to the island.

In 1950, he challenged Lady Megan again, but she beat him by 2,000 votes. This was partly because, although a Liberal, she had identified with Labour. In 1951 general election, however, when Labour lost ground nationally, he ousted her by 595 votes.

==Early parliamentary career==

In his maiden speech on 8 November 1951, Hughes addressed a number of issues that would recur during his parliamentary career, including the deficiencies of housing on Anglesey, the case for devolution in Wales, and his concerns about the future of the Welsh language.

In his first term as MP for Anglesey, Hughes placed considerable emphasis on attracting new jobs to the island. He was acutely aware that a large proportion of the young people were obliged to leave Anglesey to look for work, and Hughes was active in the process of securing the Wylfa nuclear power station and later an aluminium smelter project to be located on the island. Such efforts contributed to an increase in his majority to 4,568 at the 1955 General Election.

During his early parliamentary career, Hughes concentrated on Welsh issues. Together with a number of other Welsh-speaking Labour MPs, he supported the Parliament for Wales Campaign. In 1955, he seconded a bill proposed by S.O. Davies in favour of such a parliament but it was supported by only fourteen members of the Commons. A national petition was launched in 1956, which resulted in his being reported to the Labour national executive by the south-Wales-dominated Welsh Council of Labour. Following the failure of this campaign, Hughes supported efforts to secure a Secretary of State for Wales and this became Labour&#x27;s official policy by the 1959 General Election.

In 1957 he was appointed to the Public Accounts Committee. In the following year he conducted a month-long visit to St Helena on behalf of the Labour Party. Hughes was the first MP to visit the island since it was ceded to the British Government by the East India Company in 1843. Hughes submitted a highly critical report describing the &quot;appalling poverty&quot; of the island&#x27;s inhabitants and assisted with the establishment of the island&#x27;s first trade union. This visit established Hughes&#x27;s reputation as a politician actively involved with the affairs of the Commonwealth.

In 1959, Hugh Gaitskell appointed Hughes as a shadow spokesman on housing and local government.

When Labour came to power in 1964, Hughes was appointed Minister of State for Commonwealth Relations and this turned out to be an inspired appointment which Harold Wilson considered to be &quot;one of the Government&#x27;s outstanding successes&quot;. During his two years in post Hughes was heavily involved with decolonization and represented the British Government at the independence celebrations of Malta, Kenya and the Gambia. His negotiating skills were tested by conflicts within the Commonwealth, notably in Cyprus, Malaysia and the Indian sub-continent where Hughes negotiated a cease-fire between India and Pakistan following a military conflict in the Rann of Kutch during June 1965. Hughes was also involved in the negotiations to avert a unilateral declaration of independence in Southern Rhodesia. In July 1965, he visited Salisbury for talks with Ian Smith, but these were unsuccessful and Smith declared UDI the following November.

==Secretary of State for Wales==
In 1966, Wilson made him Secretary of State for Wales in succession to Jim Griffiths. Hughes was supported as Minister of State by George Thomas until 1967 and then by Eirene White who spoke warmly of his support and encouragement in that he allowed her to carry out her duties without undue interference.

His first months at the Welsh Office were difficult despite the fact that Labour had won 32 of the 36 Welsh constituencies. On 14 July 1966, Gwynfor Evans won the Carmarthen by-election to become the first Plaid Cymru MP leading to an upsurge in support for political nationalism, which was also reflected in the Welsh Language Society&#x27;s active campaign for bilingual road tax licences. Within the Labour Party a minority of Welsh MPs and activists supported some form of devolution reminiscent of the campaign which Hughes had supported in the 1950s. At the same time many of Hughes&#x27;s Labour colleagues, particularly veteran MPs in the industrial south, were fiercely opposed to any form of devolution. Hughes ended up caught between these two wings, and disappointed those who had anticipated a greater move towards devolution. In 1968 Hughes was succeeded as Secretary of State by George Thomas, whose views on the subject were fundamentally opposed to those of his predecessor.

Hughes&#x27;s term of office was also deeply affected by the tragedy at Aberfan in October 1966, when a colliery spoil heap engulfed the primary school, leaving 144 dead, the vast majority of them children. Hughes immediately flew to the scene, and helped direct the rescue effort and ensure the well-being of survivors. An inquiry was set up under Lord Justice Edmund-Davies which, amongst its conclusions, stated that Lord Robens, the National Coal Board chairman, had misled Hughes in claiming that all tips were regularly inspected. Hughes described the Aberfan disaster as the darkest days of his life.

He spent much of his time developing the nascent Welsh Office, creating a new civil service structure in Wales and seeking to build the economic base. This included the opening of the Anglesey Aluminium smelter at Holyhead in his constituency. In 1967, Hughes was successful in securing that the Royal Mint be located at Llantrisant in south Wales rather than in Scotland or Durham, as argued by his cabinet colleagues William Ross and Anthony Greenwood respectively. The episode was regarded as enhancing the stature of the relatively new Welsh Office, as well as strengthening Hughes&#x27;s position in the Cabinet.

==Minister for Agriculture==
In 1968 Wilson moved Hughes to become Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Hughes was disappointed to leave the Welsh Office, not least because he had done much preparatory work for the investiture of the Prince of Wales scheduled for 1969. This included sending a monthly letter on Welsh affairs to the Prince, then at Cambridge.

At Agriculture, Hughes replaced Fred Peart, who was strongly opposed to the Common Market. In contrast, Hughes was a supporter, and a great admirer of Roy Jenkins. Despite an early gaffe when he told Danish bacon producers that their product was &quot;the choice of the British housewife&quot;, Hughes fared better than most Labour incumbents in this post, and set out to boost home food production with incentives for producers of cereals and red meat. He also dealt effectively with the consequences of a severe outbreak of foot and mouth disease by ensuring that the recommendations of an enquiry chaired by the Duke of Northumberland were implemented. This action prevented another major occurrence of the disease for many years. During his time as Secretary of State for Wales, Hughes had favoured extending the nascent department&#x27;s powers over agriculture and health; as Minister of Agriculture, he transferred powers over agriculture in Wales to the Welsh Office.

==Later Commons career==
The 1970 General Election in Anglesey was a difficult one for Hughes, who was heavily criticized by Plaid Cymru supporters. At the count there were unpleasant scenes.

Following Labour&#x27;s defeat, Hughes was not elected to the Shadow Cabinet but kept the Agriculture portfolio. However, in 1972 he was dismissed by Wilson for voting in favour of entry into the Common Market. He remained a strong pro-European and was a vice-president of the umbrella group Britain in Europe during the 1975 referendum.

On return to office in 1974, Hughes was disappointed not to be offered a ministerial post. However he successfully challenged Ian Mikardo for the chairmanship of the Parliamentary Labour Party, and held the post throughout the parliament. His ability to nudge people into loyalty were in great demand in view of the Government&#x27;s small majority.

In 1976, Wilson resigned suddenly and Hughes was tasked as chairman of the PLP with organizing the election of a successor. Hughes was close politically not only to Roy Jenkins but also to James Callaghan who he had first met in 1949 at the home of Glenys Kinnock&#x27;s parents in Holyhead. Upon his election, James Callaghan recommended the appointment of Hughes as a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour.

In March 1977, Hughes was actively involved in the negotiations that led to the Lib-Lab pact. In the autumn of the following year, when the Callaghan government did not have a majority in the Commons, Hughes persuaded the three Plaid Cymru members to support the government in return for a commitment to legislate for compensation to workers suffering from silicosis as a result of working in the slate quarrying industry.

In late 1978 he was once again despatched as an envoy to Rhodesia, seeking to accelerate the handover of power to the majority population, but as in 1965, he made little headway in persuading Ian Smith to co-operate. Hughes also failed to persuade Joshua Nkomo to give up the armed struggle.

In 1979 was hugely disappointed by the decisive referendum vote against devolution for Wales held on 1 March 1979. He did eventually participate in the 1997 campaign that led to a narrow vote in favour.

Weeks later, he stood down from his Anglesey seat and was succeeded as Labour candidate by his close ally, Elystan Morgan. However, the seat was surprisingly lost to the Conservative candidate Keith Best with a substantial swing. The result underlined the extent to which Hughes had built up a personal vote during his 29 years as MP for the constituency. Labour did not recapture the seat until 2001.

==House of Lords==
On 16 July 1979 he was made a life peer as Baron Cledwyn of Penrhos, &quot;of Holyhead in the Isle of Anglesey&quot;. Following the death of Lord Goronwy-Roberts in July 1981, Cledwyn became Deputy Leader of the Labour Party in the House of Lords. In November 1982 he challenged Fred Peart for the role of Leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords, following dissatisfaction among leading Labour peers towards Peart&#x27;s leadership. For the next decade he proved highly skilled in organizing the resources at his disposal to keep the government under scrutiny. There were only around 120 Labour peers, and a third of them were too unwell or elderly to regularly participate in debates. During this time the debates in the Lords were televised (at a time when those in the Commons were not) and this gave significant prominence to the Labour opposition in the Lords.

For most of his decade as Labour leader and, as such, a member of the Shadow Cabinet, Neil Kinnock was the leader of the Labour Party and they formed a strong working relationship. Had Labour won the 1992 General Election, Kinnock would have appointed Lord Cledwyn to a Cabinet post. Labour&#x27;s defeat was a great disappointment to him, as he was unable to implement his proposals to reform the institution. The leadership passed to another Welshman, Lord Richard of Ammanford.

==Later life==
During his later years, Lord Cledwyn took on a number of roles in Welsh public life. From 1976 until 1985 he was President of the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth. He has a building named after him at Aberystwyth, which is home to the School of Business and Management. He relinquished this post in 1985 on being appointed Pro-Chancellor of the University of Wales. Over the next decade he devoted much of his time to the University&#x27;s various problems, including financial challenges. In particular, he was successful in obtaining funding from the Conservative government to allow the merger of the University College at Cardiff with the University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology to form what became Cardiff University. In 1995 he became President of the University College of North Wales, Bangor.

Another of his great interests was his involvement in campaigns for recognition of the Welsh language. Most notably, in 1980, he played a leading part in persuading William Whitelaw to change government policy and to establish a Welsh language television service. He was thus instrumental in persuading Gwynfor Evans to abandon his intention to begin a hunger strike. The new channel was launched as S4C in 1982. Most of his contributions in the House of Lords during the last decade of his life were on Welsh subjects.

==Family==
In 1949 he married Jean Beatrice, daughter of Captain Jesse Hughes, of Holyhead. She shared both his religion and politics.
Cledwyn and Jean Hughes had two children, a daughter, Ann and son, Harri. From 1955 until 1959 the family lived in London, but in 1959 decided that they move back to Anglesey where the children could be brought up in a Welsh speaking community.

Lord Cledwyn died, aged 84, at Glan Clwyd Hospital, Bodelwyddan on 22 February 2001. Following a public funeral service at Disgwylfa Chapel on 27 February, he was buried at Maeshyfryd Cemetery, Holyhead.

==Tributes and assessment==

On learning of his death, former Prime Minister James Callaghan said that Cledwyn Hughes &#x27;was an unfailing counsellor to me throughout my political life, and especially during my time as prime minister. Wales has lost a great man, and I mourn a true friend.&#x27;

Cledwyn Hughes was regarded primarily as an efficient administrator, but also as a person of great warmth and humour, with a considerable talent for storytelling. During the 1960s and 1970s his florid complexion was a familiar sight in the news. In Wales and beyond, he was known simply as Cledwyn.

<text>Theophrastus is a small lunar impact crater at the southern part of the Sinus Amoris, a bay at the northeast part of the Mare Tranquillitatis. It was named after ancient Greek philosopher Theophrastus in 1973. It lies to the southeast of the lava-flooded crater Maraldi, and was designated Maraldi M until the IAU gave it its current name. Just to the southeast of Theophrastus is the flooded Franz.

This is a circular crater, with inner walls that slope down to the midpoint and a rim that rises slightly above the surrounding lunar mare. The crater has nearly the same low albedo as the nearby surface. It has no other distinctive features, and is not significantly eroded.

<doc id="1295652" wikidata="Q90659" url="?curid=1295652" title="Hermann Schultz">
<text>Hermann Schultz (December 30, 1836 - May 15, 1903), German Protestant theologian, was born at Lüchow in Hanover (now in Lower Saxony).

==Education==
He studied at Göttingen and Erlangen, became professor at Basel in 1864, and eventually (1876) &quot;professor ordinarius&quot; at Göttingen. Here he also held the appointments of chief university preacher, councillor to the State Consistory of the Church of Hanover (from 1881) and abbot of Bursfelde (1890).

==Religious position==
Professor Schultz&#x27;s theological standpoint was that of a moderate liberal. &quot;It is thought by many that he has succeeded in discovering the &quot;via media&quot; between the positions of Biblical scholars like Delitzsch on the one hand and Stade on the other&quot; (Prof. J. A. Paterson). He was well known to British and American students as the author of an excellent work on &quot;Old Testament Theology&quot; (2 vols., 1869, 5th ed., 1896; Eng. trans., 2nd ed., 1895).

==Divinity of Christ==
In his work on the doctrine of the Divinity of Christ (&quot;Die Lehre von der Gottheit Christi&quot;, 1881) he followed the method of Ritschl, and contended that the deity of Christ ought to be understood as the expression of the experience of the Christian community. In his own person and work Christ represents to the community a personal revelation of God. Faith in the divinity of Christ does not rest upon a miracle in nature, but upon a miracle in the moral world.

==Schultz&#x27;s other works==

*&quot;Die Lehre vom heiligen Abendmahl&quot; (1886).

<doc id="1295662" wikidata="Q1290209" url="?curid=1295662" title="Trevor Huddleston">
<text>Ernest Urban Trevor Huddleston (15 June 191320 April 1998) was an English Anglican bishop. He was the Bishop of Stepney in London before becoming the second Archbishop of the Church of the Province of the Indian Ocean. He was best known for his anti-apartheid activism and his book &quot;Naught for Your Comfort&quot;.

==Early life==
Huddleston was the son of Ernest Huddleston and was born in Bedford, Bedfordshire, and educated at Lancing College (1927–1931), Christ Church, Oxford, and at Wells Theological College. He joined an Anglican religious order, the Community of the Resurrection (CR), in 1939, taking vows in 1941, having already served for three years as a curate at St Mark&#x27;s Swindon. He had been made a deacon at Michaelmas 1936 (27 September) and ordained a priest the following Michaelmas (26 September 1937) — both times by Clifford Woodward, Bishop of Bristol, at Bristol Cathedral.

==South Africa==
In September 1940 Huddleston sailed to Cape Town, and in 1943 he went to the Community of the Resurrection mission station at Rosettenville (Johannesburg, South Africa). He was sent there to build on the work of Raymond Raynes, whose monumental efforts there, building three churches, seven schools and three nursery schools catering for over 6,000 children, had proved to be so demanding that the community summoned him back to Mirfield in order to recuperate. Raynes was deeply concerned about who should be appointed to succeed him. He met Huddleston who had been appointed to nurse him while he was in the infirmary. As a result of that meeting, much to Huddleston&#x27;s surprise as he had only been a member of the community for four years, Raynes was convinced that he had found his successor.

Over the course of the next 13 years in Sophiatown, Huddleston developed into a much-loved priest and respected anti-apartheid activist, earning him the nickname &quot;Makhalipile&quot; (&quot;dauntless one&quot;). He fought against the apartheid laws, which were increasingly systematised by the Nationalist government which was voted in by the white electorate in 1948, and in 1955 the African National Congress (ANC) bestowed the rare Isitwalandwe award of honour on him at the famous Freedom Congress in Kliptown. He was particularly concerned about the Nationalist Government&#x27;s decision to bulldoze Sophiatown and forcibly remove all its inhabitants sixteen miles further away from Johannesburg. Despite Huddleston&#x27;s efforts, these removals began on 9 February 1955 when Nelson Mandela described Huddleston as one of the leaders of the opposition to the removal. Among other work, he established the African Children&#x27;s Feeding Scheme (which still exists today) and raised money for the Orlando Swimming Pools – the only place black children could swim in Johannesburg until post-1994.

There are many South Africans whose lives were changed by Huddleston; one of the most famous is Hugh Masekela, for whom Huddleston provided his first trumpet as a 14-year-old pupil at St. Martin&#x27;s School (Rosettenville) in South Africa. Soon after the &#x27;Huddleston Jazz Band&#x27; was formed, sparking a global career for Masekela and his fellow South African, Jonas Gwangwa. Other notable persons who credit Huddleston with influencing their lives include Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Sally Motlana, (activist and vice-chair of the South African Council of Churches during the 1970s); Archbishop Khotso Makhulu and Robben Islander and later President of the Land Claims Court, Fikile Bam. Huddleston was close to O R Tambo, ANC President during the years of exile, from 1962 to 1990. They hosted many conferences, protests and actions together, in the face of fierce opposition from both Margaret Thatcher, and the South African government and their allies.

==Return to England, Tanzania and Mauritius==

Huddleston&#x27;s community asked him to return to England in 1955 (and he left South Africa in early 1956), some say due to the controversy he was attracting in speaking out against apartheid. However, the Superior at the time, Raymond Raynes, wrote that the decision to recall Trevor was made by Raynes himself. In 1956 he published his seminal work, &quot;Naught for your Comfort&quot;, and began work as the master of novices at CR&#x27;s Mirfield mother house in West Yorkshire for two years before becoming the prior of the order&#x27;s priory in London where he remained until his appointment as a bishop. He was consecrated a bishop on St Andrew&#x27;s Day 1960 (30 November) by Leonard Beecher, Archbishop of East Africa, at St Nicholas&#x27;, Ilala, Dar es Salaam, to serve as Bishop of Masasi (Tanzania), where he worked for eight years, primarily in re-organising the mission schools to be run by the newly independent government of Julius Nyerere, with whom he became a firm friend. He became Bishop of Stepney, a suffragan bishop in the Diocese of London.

In 1974, Huddleston was questioned by the police in connection with complaints of alleged sexual abuse made by the parents of four boys who had been playing in Huddleston&#x27;s office. In his statement Huddleston said &quot;I have never done anything to harm a child ... Neither do I consider it indecent to pat a child on the bottom or pinch him ... The boys are telling the truth but the implications of indecency are completely absurd.&quot; The police report recommended charging him with four counts of gross indecency, but because of his high profile, the matter was referred to the director of public prosecutions, Sir Norman Skelhorn. Skelhorn decided not to charge him after consulting Labour party figures. According to some sources, the existence of the investigation and report was only uncovered as part of research for the 2004 publication of Piers McGrandle&#x27;s biography (see below). However, there was no reason for the report to be public, if the case for prosecution had been dismissed.

In his biography, &quot;Trevor Huddleston: Turbulent Priest&quot;, Piers McGrandle quotes Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Bishop Gerald Ellison dismissing the claims as a plot by the South African Bureau of State Security (B.O.S.S.) to discredit a prominent opponent of apartheid. Tutu wrote the foreword for the McGrandle book, and Archbishop Rowan Williams the afterword. McGrandle was a part-time chaplain to Huddleston, and wanted to introduce Huddleston to a new generation. At a service to mark the Centenary of Huddleston&#x27;s birth in June 2013, many people testified to the impact Huddleston had made on their faith and practice as Anglicans, and others, as activists.

Tutu, who as a little boy knew Huddleston and swears to his innocence, was particularly affronted by the suggestion that Huddleston was anything other than a protector of children. On 14 February 1995 he wrote a lengthy letter saying any suggestion of Huddleston&#x27;s criminality was outrageous and adding that he could easily gather together a dozen black friends of Huddleston&#x27;s acquaintance who would testify to his innocence and integrity.

On 14 February 1995, Desmond Tutu, the then Archbishop of Cape Town wrote: &quot;He [Huddleston] was an enormous thorn in the side of the apartheid regime and was effectively the real spokesman for the anti-apartheid movement for a considerable period. No one did more to keep apartheid on the world&#x27;s agenda than he and therefore it would have been a devastating victory for the forces of evil and darkness had he been discredited&quot;, adding &quot;How ghastly to want to besmirch such a remarkable man, so holy and so good. How utterly despicable and awful.&quot;

Bishop Gerald Ellison, the Bishop of London when Huddleston was Bishop of Stepney, also said that political enemies of Huddleston were involved.

Ellison said: &quot;I want to make it absolutely clear that I have seen no evidence that Bishop Trevor was ever guilty of a criminal act. He undoubtedly had many enemies in South Africa and England who wanted to denigrate him, indeed, to destroy him.&quot; Ellison was also clear that neither he, nor his legal advisers, believed anyone had the right to impede justice if there was any real evidence of guilt. However Sam Silkin, the Attorney General at the time who had taken the decision not to prosecute, later said on the radio:

::&quot;I found that I was in difficulty as the man was very well known. If he had been prosecuted at all it would have ruined his career. Within the DPP&#x27;s department everyone thought he would be acquitted, though there was clearly evidence.&quot;

After 10 years in England, Huddleston was appointed (1978) as the Bishop of Mauritius, a diocese of the Province of the Indian Ocean. Later in the same year he was elected as the Archbishop of the Province of the Indian Ocean. In 1984, he was succeeded by Rex Donat as Bishop of Mauritius.

==After retirement==
After his retirement from episcopal office in 1983, Huddleston continued anti-apartheid work, having become president of the Anti-Apartheid Movement in 1981. He continued to campaign against the imprisonment of children in South Africa, and was able to vote as an honorary South African in the first democratic elections on 27 April 1994. He briefly returned to South Africa but found it too difficult with his diabetic condition and increasing frailty, and returned to Mirfield. In October 1994 he was involved in the establishment of the Living South Africa Memorial, the UK&#x27;s memorial to all those who lost lives under political violence, at St Martin-in-the-Fields church, London, which raised funds for education in the newly democratic South Africa, and campaigned for ongoing investment in the region, under a call to action &#x27;It takes more than a vote to get over apartheid&#x27;.

In 1994, he received honours from Tanzania (Torch of Kilimanjaro) and was awarded the Indira Gandhi Award for Peace, Disarmament and Development. In the 1998 New Year Honours he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG).

In 1994, Huddleston was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters (L.H.D.) degree from Whittier College.

==Death and legacy==
Huddleston died at Mirfield, West Yorkshire, England, in 1998. A window in memory of him is in Lancing College chapel and was visited by Desmond Tutu. They had become friends when Huddleston visited a young Tutu in hospital when he was ill with TB. They later worked together opposing apartheid. The Huddleston Centre in Hackney has been delivering youth provision to disabled young people living in Hackney for over 30 years, and continues to do so. The centre bears Huddleston&#x27;s name after he intervened to ensure that part of a church building was converted to provide an accessible nursery, play (and latterly youth club) space for disabled young people in Hackney, regardless of their faith. The Trevor Huddleston Memorial Centre in Sophiatown was established in 1999 following Huddleston&#x27;s death and the interment of his ashes in the garden of Christ the King Church in Sophiatown where he had been active and then supervised mission activity for 13 years. The Centre delivers youth development programmes in Johannesburg as well as heritage and cultural projects promoting Huddleston&#x27;s belief in developing the potential of every young person and his commitment to non-racialism, multi-faith issues and social justice.

In addition, he also bought the first trumpet of Hugh Masekela, a South African trumpeter, composer and singer, and got Louis Armstrong to give Masekela one of his own trumpets as a gift. Aged 21, Masekela left South Africa for the UK where Huddleston helped him secure a place at the Guildhall School of Music, and then he went to New York, where he began to craft his signature Afro-jazz style, under both Armstrong and Gillespie. Masekela was joined at the event by special guest and New York-born jazz pianist, Larry Willis, whom Masekela first met in those early days in Manhattan. Masekela later gave the Fr Huddleston Memorial Lecture at a special event in central London to mark the end of Huddleston&#x27;s Centenary Year (June 2013-June 2014), and the 20th anniversary of democratic elections.

Hosted by the Trevor Huddleston Memorial Centre (based in Sophiatown, Johannesburg), the Gala Evening raised funds for the work of the Memorial Centre, to help young entrepreneurs get a foothold in the creative industries in South Africa. The Memorial Centre runs training and incubation for entrepreneurs, and awards the Fr Huddleston Arts Bursary to one young South African annually, giving them experience in a UK community arts setting for 3–6 months. In this way, the legacy of Huddleston in assisting young people is continued.

==Writings==

===Books===
Huddleston wrote five books, the seminal two being:
*

===Prayer for Africa===
A well-known prayer of Huddleston&#x27;s is the &quot;Prayer for Africa&quot;. It has been recited throughout South Africa, Tanzania and other African countries.

&lt;poem&gt;
God bless Africa,
Guard her people,
Guide her leaders,
And give her peace.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Alternative version (with emphasis on children):

&lt;poem&gt;
God Bless Africa,
Guard her children,
Guide her leaders,
And give her peace, for Jesus Christ&#x27;s sake. Amen.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Another alternative version:

&lt;poem&gt;
God bless Africa, God bless Africa,
Guard her children, guide her leaders.
God bless Africa, God bless Africa,
God bless Africa and bring her peace.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Anglican parishes in South Africa now routinely say the original prayer, or a variation thereof near the end of their regular services. A slightly different variation is used every week.

Barry Smith who served as Director of Music at the St George&#x27;s Cathedral in Cape Town, composed a musical accompaniment for the version that emphasizes children.

<doc id="1295686" wikidata="Q577360" url="?curid=1295686" title="Santa's Slay">
<text>Santa&#x27;s Slay is a 2005 Christmas black comedy slasher film written and directed by David Steiman, a former assistant to Brett Ratner; Ratner served as a producer. After a millennium of spreading Christmas joy due to losing a bet with an angel, Santa Claus reverts to his demonic self and gives the gift of evil and fear. The film stars Bill Goldberg, Douglas Smith, Emilie de Ravin, Robert Culp, Saul Rubinek, Dave Thomas, Rebecca Gayheart, Chris Kattan, and Fran Drescher.

&quot;Santa&#x27;s Slay&quot; was released in the United States on December 20, 2005, by Media 8 Entertainment. The film received mixed reviews from critics.

==Plot==
On Christmas Eve in Alberta, Canada, the Mason family is bickering about their wealth and material possessions while eating Christmas dinner when Santa Claus comes down the chimney and kills them all in various graphic displays of Christmas-themed violence, such as drowning the matriarch Virginia in eggnog, using the star atop a Christmas tree as a shuriken, and stabbing the patriarch&#x27;s hands to the table with silverware and force-feeding him a leg of turkey before impaling his mouth on it.

Riding on his sleigh driven by his &quot;hell-deer&quot;, a buffalo-like beast, Santa arrives at Hell Township and decimates the locals in various holiday-themed ways. In one of his kills, Santa slaughters the occupants of a local strip club. Pastor Timmons, a crooked minister, manages to survive the massacre. Later, Santa murders the local Jewish delicatessen owner Mr. Green using his own menorah.

Meanwhile, teenager Nicholas Yuleson is living with his grandfather, a crackpot inventor who has built a bunker in their basement to survive Christmas. When Nicholas asks Grandpa why he hates Christmas, he is shown &quot;The Book of Klaus&quot;, which reveals the origins of Santa Claus. Apparently, Santa was the result of a virgin birth produced by Satan. Christmas was &quot;The Day of Slaying&quot; for Santa until A.D. 1005, when an angel defeated him in a curling match and sentenced him to deliver presents on Christmas for 1,000 years. This means that Santa is free to kill again in 2005.

Upon arriving at the delicatessen, Nicholas is taken to the police station for questioning about Mr. Green&#x27;s murder. He is bailed out by his love interest, Mary &quot;Mac&quot; Mackenzie, just before Santa arrives and kills all of the officers. Santa pursues Nicholas and Mac in a police car, but they are able to escape, thanks to a shotgun in Mac&#x27;s truck. They flee to his grandpa’s bunker, with Santa still in pursuit. Nicholas and Mac manage to escape using Grandpa&#x27;s snowmobile; Grandpa Yuleson is apparently killed.

The two teens hide in a local high school, hoping that Santa&#x27;s powers will end once Christmas ends; but they are eventually forced to confront him in the gym. They are almost killed by Santa on a Zamboni but are saved by Grandpa, who is actually the angel who originally defeated and sentenced Santa. With Christmas over and his powers gone, Santa flees; but his &quot;hell-deer&quot; is shot down by Mac&#x27;s father with a bazooka. Pastor Timmons is found dead in a Santa suit and is presumed to be the killer, while, in fact, the real killer Santa Claus is boarding a flight from Winnipeg to the North Pole under the name &quot;Mr. Šatan.&quot; Nicholas notes to Mac that Santa is bound to come back, stating he&#x27;s finishing what his grandfather started. He and Mac then share a kiss to pursue a relationship.

After the credits, Santa is seen looking over his Naughty List, when he looks into the camera and says &quot;Who&#x27;s Next?&quot;

==Cast==
==Release==
&quot;Santa&#x27;s Slay&quot; was released on DVD in the United States by Lionsgate on December 20, 2005. It was released in Canada that same day by Maple Pictures. Lionsgate later re-released the film on November 10, 2008.

==Reception==
Randall Colburn from &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; gave the film a positive review, calling it &quot;simultaneously vulgar and wholesome, stupid and satirical, violent and lighthearted&quot;. Todd Martin of &quot;HorrorNews.net&quot; also liked the film, writing, &quot;It isn&#x27;t perfect and there are times when it is a little too corny for its own good but overall it is just a fun, brainless movie that has a ton of violence in it.&quot; Brett Gallman from &quot;Oh, the Horror&quot; wrote, &quot;Admittedly, the film doesn&#x27;t quite keep up the relentless pace the entire time, but it&#x27;s mostly one hell of a slay ride, full of cheesy dialogue, colorful characters, and plenty of laughs.&quot; David Nusair from &quot;ReelFilm Reviews&quot; gave the film a mixed 2.5 out of 5 stars, commending the film&#x27;s humor, pacing, and Goldberg&#x27;s tongue-in-cheek performance while also stating that the film ran out of steam in the third act.

The film was not without its detractors. Jon Condit from Dread Central was highly critical of the film, awarding it 1.5 out of 5 stars. In his review, Condit criticized the film&#x27;s writing and direction as being &quot;sloppy&quot; and &quot;amateurish&quot;, also criticizing the abrupt ending.

<doc id="1295711" wikidata="Q1593728" url="?curid=1295711" title="Hegemonic stability theory">
<text>Hegemonic stability theory (HST) is a theory of international relations, rooted in research from the fields of political science, economics, and history. HST indicates that the international system is more likely to remain stable when a single state is the dominant world power, or hegemon. Thus, the end of hegemony diminishes the stability of the international system. As evidence for the stability of hegemony, proponents of HST frequently point to the Pax Britannica and Pax Americana, as well as the instability prior to World War I (when British hegemony was in decline) and the instability of the interwar period (when the American hegemon reduced its presence from world politics). 

The key mechanisms in hegemonic stability theory revolve around public goods provision: to resolve collective action problems regarding public goods, a powerful actor who is willing and able to shoulder a disproportionate share of public goods provision is needed. Hegemonic stability may entail self-reinforcing cooperation, as it is in the interest of the hegemon to provide public goods and it is in interest of other states to maintain an international order from which they derive public goods.

== Early development ==
Charles Kindleberger is one of the scholars most closely associated with HST; commentators such as Benjamin Cohen regard him as the theory&#x27;s founder and most influential proponent. In his 1973 book &quot;The World in Depression: 1929-1939&quot;, Kindleberger argued that the economic chaos between World War I and World War II that led to the Great Depression was partly attributable to the lack of a world leader with a dominant economy. Kindleberger&#x27;s reasoning touched upon more than economics, however: the central idea behind HST suggests that the stability of the global system, in terms of politics, international law, and so on, relies on the hegemon to develop and enforce the rules of that system. Other key figures in the development of hegemonic stability theory include Robert Gilpin and Stephen Krasner. 

In his major work, Gilpin theorizes world history as imperial cycles until late modern times and the succession of hegemonies in late modern times when first Britain and later the United States stabilized the international system. Gilpin opposes balancing and the balance-of-power theory. He contends that the system naturally goes toward equilibrium. From global war or &quot;hegemonic war&quot; emerges a new hegemon who creates and keeps the new world order with its own set of preferences. This is partly accomplished by providing public goods. In the case of the hegemony of the United States after 1945, there took place attempts at initialising a stable currency by means of the International Monetary Fund, the Bretton Woods system, establishment of the World Bank, security alliances (such as NATO), and democratisation.

Gilpin argues further that in the global system, the more decisive a victory is after the &quot;hegemonic war&quot;, the more stable the new system will be. He agrees with Paul Kennedy&#x27;s view of &quot;imperialistic overstretch&quot; as one of the reasons that hegemons fall. Gilpin adds that all hegemons inevitably fall because at a certain stage expansion exceeds benefits, distribution of power in the system shifts and other states rise and challenge the hegemon. Eventually, a dissatisfied great power that approaches the power of the current hegemon will cause a new global war and the cycle repeats.

Robert Keohane coined the term &quot;Hegemonic stability theory&quot; in a 1980 article. Keohane&#x27;s 1984 book &quot;After Hegemony&quot; used insights from the new institutional economics to argue that the international system could remain stable in the absence of a hegemon, thus questioning hegemonic stability theory. John Ruggie&#x27;s work on embedded liberalism also challenged hegemonic stability theory. He argued that the post-WWII international order was not just held together by material power but through &quot;legitimate social purpose&quot; whereby governments created support for the international order through social policies that alleviated the adverse effects of globalization. John Ikenberry argues that hegemony is not a precondition for international stability, pointing to path dependence and &quot;stickiness&quot; of institutions.

== Hegemonic attributes ==

In order for a nation-state to rise to the level of hegemon, such a state must combine all or most of the following attributes:

* Superior military force is necessary for the ability to forge new international laws and organizations.
* Insularity provides added security and the potential to project military forces, though in some cases hegemons have not been insular or peninsular. The United States of America, for instance, has become a virtual island. It has two massive seaboards, and its neighbors are long-standing allies, setting it apart from the rest of great powers. Nuclear weapons and superior air force add to its national security.
* A large and growing economy. Usually, unrivaled supremacy in at least one leading economic or technological sector is necessary. Military and economic powers compose the capability to enforce the rules of the system.
* The will to lead and to establish a hegemonic regime by enforcing the rules of the system. After World War I, the United States possessed the capacity to lead, but lacked the will to do so. Without the will to force stability on the international system, the United States missed an opportunity to prevent the onset of the Great Depression or World War II.
* A hegemon must commit to the system, which needs to be perceived as mutually beneficial by other great powers and important state-actors.

== Competing theories of hegemonic stability ==

Research on hegemony can be divided into two schools of thought: the realist school and the systemic school. Each school can be further sub-divided. Two dominant theories have emerged from each school. What Robert Keohane first called the &quot;theory of hegemonic stability&quot;, joins A. F. K. Organski&#x27;s Power Transition Theory as the two dominant approaches to the realist school of thought. Long Cycle Theory, espoused by George Modelski, and World Systems Theory, espoused by Immanuel Wallerstein, have emerged as the two dominant approaches to the systemic school of thought.

=== Systemic school of thought ===

According to Thomas J. McCormick, scholars and other experts on the systemic school define hegemony &quot;as a single power&#x27;s possession of &#x27;simultaneous superior economic efficiency in production, trade and finance.&#x27;&quot; Furthermore, a hegemon&#x27;s superior position is considered the logical consequence of superior geography, technological innovation, ideology, superior resources, and other factors.

==== Long cycle theory ====

George Modelski, who presented his ideas in the book, &quot;Long Cycles in World Politics&quot; (1987), is the chief architect of long cycle theory. In a nutshell, long cycle theory describes the connection between war cycles, economic supremacy, and the political aspects of world leadership.

Long cycles, or long waves, offer interesting perspectives on global politics by permitting &quot;the careful exploration of the ways in which world wars have recurred, and lead states such as Britain and the United States have succeeded each other in an orderly manner.&quot; Not to be confused with Simon Kuznets&#x27; idea of long-cycles, or long-swings, long cycles of global politics are patterns of past world politics.

The long cycle, according to Dr. Dan Cox, is a period of time lasting approximately 70 to 100 years. At the end of that period, &quot;the title of most powerful nation in the world switches hands.&quot;. Modelski divides the long cycle into four phases. When periods of global war, which could last as much as one-fourth of the total long cycle, are factored in, the cycle can last from 87 to 122 years.

Many traditional theories of international relations, including the other approaches to hegemony, believe that the baseline nature of the international system is anarchy. Modelski&#x27;s long cycle theory, however, states that war and other destabilizing events are a natural product of the long cycle and larger global system cycle. They are part of the living processes of the global polity and social order. Wars are &quot;systemic decisions&quot; that &quot;punctuate the movement of the system at regular intervals.&quot; Because &quot;world politics is not a random process of hit or miss, win or lose, depending on the luck of the draw or the brute strength of the contestants,&quot; anarchy simply doesn&#x27;t play a role. After all, long cycles have provided, for the last five centuries, a means for the successive selection and operation of numerous world leaders.

Modeslki used to believe that long cycles were a product of the modern period. He suggests that the five long cycles, which have taken place since about 1500, are each a part of a larger global system cycle, or the modern world system.

Under the terms of long cycle theory, five hegemonic long cycles have taken place, each strongly correlating to economic Kondratieff Waves (or K-Waves). The first hegemon would have been Portugal during the 16th century, then the Netherlands during the 17th century. Next, Great Britain served twice, first during the 18th century, then during the 19th century. The United States has been serving as hegemon since the end of World War II.

The traditional view of long cycle theory has evolved somewhat, as Modelski now suggests that Northern and Southern Sung China, Venice and Genoa were each the dominant economic powers during medieval long cycles. However, he does not classify any of these states as world powers. Only when Portugal gained hegemony after 1500 is that distinction made.

=== Other views of hegemonic stability ===

==== Neorealist interpretation ====

Neorealists have been focusing on this theory recently, the main proponent of it being John J. Mearsheimer who is trying to incorporate it into &#x27;offensive realism&#x27;. In his book &quot;The Tragedy of Great Power Politics&quot; Mearsheimer outlines how the anarchic system that neorealists subscribe to (see Kenneth Waltz for original theory) creates power hungry states who will each attempt to install themselves as regional and global hegemons. The system is created, shaped and maintained by coercion. The hegemon would begin to undermine the institution when it is not in their interests. With the decline of a hegemon, the system descends into instability.

==== Classical liberal interpretation ====
It is motivated by enlightened self-interest; the hegemon takes on the costs because it is good for all actors, thereby creating stability in the system, which is also in the interests of all actors.

==== Neoliberal interpretation ====
Neoliberals argue that the hegemon wishes to maintain its dominant position without paying enforcement costs, so it creates a system in which it can credibly limit the returns to power (loser doesn&#x27;t lose all) and credibly commit to neither dominate nor abandon them. This is done through institutions, which are sticky, (hard to change, more convenient to continue using than to revamp.) These institutions favor the hegemon but provide protection and a stable world order for the rest of the world. The more open this world-order, the less likely that there will be a challenger. With the decline of the hegemon, institutions don&#x27;t automatically die, because they were constructed in a way that benefited all stakeholders; instead, they take on a life of their own (see regime theory).

=== Criticism ===
Keohane&#x27;s 1984 book &quot;After Hegemony&quot; used insights from the new institutional economics to argue that the international system could remain stable in the absence of a hegemon, thus rebutting hegemonic stability theory. Keohane showed that international cooperation could be sustained through repeated interactions, transparency, and monitoring. These factors could reduce transaction costs and provide information about other states (for example, whether the states are cheating or contributing). Duncan Snidal argues that international cooperation is sustainable even after hegemony because smaller states derive sufficient benefits to be willing to contribute towards international institutions.

Using insights from historical institutionalism, John Ikenberry argues that the international institutions set up by the United States are sustainable due to feedback effects, whereby it is costly for actors to set up alternative institutions. Ikenberry also argues that hegemonic stability theory fails to account for regime types, which is essential to understanding why democratic hegemons such as the United States created institutions during periods in which they were hegemons, whereas non-democratic hegemons in previous eras did not set up institutional orders when given the opportunity. Consistent with hegemonic stability theory, Ikenberry argues that the ability to create institutions is partly due to power preponderance.

Dominic Tierney argues that hegemonic stability theorists are wrong in assuming that unipolarity leads to a stable order. He argues that it is the contestation that compels the great power and other states to build international order.

Maria Gavris has criticized HST for its underdeveloped conceptualization of hegemony.

== Post-Cold War period ==
=== Theory ===
On the &quot;unipolar moment&quot; in 1990, the leading expert on the world-systems theory, Christopher Chase-Dunn, linked the forthcoming period with the HST. He reminded that hegemonic rivalry led to World Wars and in future such a rivalry among core states is only likely if the US hegemony continues to decline. But the current situation of single superpower is eminently stable.

To the mainstream International Relations (IR below), the unipolar world came as a surprise. Realists, shaped by “two World Wars and the Cold War, understood the differing logics of multipolar and bipolar systems, but apparently failed to envision a unipolar world because none of their works before the end of the Cold War accounts for it.”

For several more years following the &quot;unipolar moment&quot;, IR analysis overwhelmingly argued for instability and imminent collapse of the hegemonic order. Mark Sheetz was one of the first IR scholars to explicitly link the post-Cold War order with the HST: The US strategy, he wrote in 1997, fits &quot;the expectations of hegemonic stability theory more comfortably than do other Realist theories. The latter predict that efforts to preserve hegemony would be futile and counterproductive, but not so hegemonic stability theory.&quot;

Only in 1999, came to light an article completely and explicitly devoted to the subject. William Wohlforth titled it &quot;The stability of a unipolar world&quot;, paraphrasing the 1964 title, &quot;The stability of a bipolar world&quot;, by the founder of Neorealism, Kenneth Waltz. Wohlforth stressed the theoretical lag: &quot;[The] hegemonic theory has received little shrill in the debate over the nature of the post-Cold War international system. This omission is unwarranted, for the theory has simple and profound implications for the peacefulness of the post-Cold War international order that are backed up by a formidable body of scholarship.&quot;

The first obstacle facing the IR research after the Cold War was mathematical - how many poles gives two minus one. There is no evidence the IR scholars collaborated with the department of mathematics and probably worked on their own. In 1997, Michael W. Doyle summarized six years of calculations: We declare that the new world order exists &quot;and now we must ask what do we mean.&quot; Two poles minus one might give one, three, four, five and even zero poles. Doyle concluded with undefined number of &quot;many&quot; poles.

The mathematical breakthrough occurred two years later in the above-mentioned work by Wohlforth: Two states measured up as polar powers in 1990. &quot;One is gone. No new pole has appeared: 2 - 1 = 1. The system is unipolar.&quot; The article by Wohlforth, according to Stephen Walt, broke the theoretical path.

In the following decade, the IR research tentatively switched to the unipolar or hegemonic stability, which replaced the balance of power as the focus of intense debate among IR scholars. Charles Kupchan, who since 1991 expects an imminent end to the US hegemony, in 2003 agreed that this hegemony causes the present peace and stability.

Until the early 2000s, Jack S. Levy and William Thompson adhered to the main Realist paradigm that hegemonic stability is theoretically impossible because other states would counter-balance. By the end of the decade, however, both engaged in search for the causes of the present hegemonic stability. In 2009, the student and follower of Waltz, Christopher Layne, confessed: &quot;As events transpires, however, the fate of earlier hegemons has not befallen the United States.&quot; In the 2010s, more IR scholars accepted the hegemonic stability as a theory most fitting the post-Cold War period.

Curiously, one of the classics of the HST, Gilpin, denied the existence of the post-Cold-War hegemony and never applied the theory to this period. In 2002, Gilpin referred to some scholars who define the present system as hegemonic. &quot;Less sanguin observers,&quot; however, countered that the bipolar system was supplanted by &quot;chaotic, multipolar world of five or more major powers.&quot; The proclamation of the &quot;new world order&quot; he attributed to the end of the Gulf War in 1991, though the proclamation is attested from 1990 and the Gulf War had been regarded as the first test to the already existing new world order.

=== Application ===
==== United States ====

Although the Hegemonic stability theory is attributed to the 1973 work by Kindleberger and the Realist mainstream rejected it for three decades longer, several scholars since World War II had theorized about the US preponderance of power which is identical in its arguments to the hegemonic stability. Similar arguments ping-ponged in the literature about the American foreign policy until the 2017 Peace through strength promised by Donald Trump.

Three scholars described how the US-led hegemonic system produces stability in the Twenty-First century: The United States makes its power safe for the world and in return the world agrees to live within the hegemonic system maintaining formal or informal alliances and open markets. The United States has been influential in moving many countries towards embracing the free market through institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank (see Washington Consensus).

Curiously, at the peak of the 2003 anti-hegemonic crisis, the world public opinion remained highly pro-hegemonic and convinced in the hegemonic stability. Large majorities of people in most surveyed countries thought that the world would be a more dangerous place if there were a rival to the American superpower. 64% of the French, 70% of the Mexicans and 63% of the Jordanians thought this way.

The US network of alliances created in the early Cold War remains intact in the post-Cold War period and NATO almost doubled in members. When NATO counted only 16 members, it was already described as the most successful alliance in history. As of 2023, it counts 30 members. The exact number of US allies worldwide is undefined because there is no clear criteria for counting unofficial defense partnerships. Bradley A. Thayer counts 84; Max Ostrovsky over 100. 130 countries or even more host US bases. Most of these countries are either formal allies or informal defense partners.

Fifteen years in the post-Cold War period, Thayer calculated the hegemonic stabilization: Of 192 countries, 84 are allied with America and they include almost all of the developed economies. That is a combined GDP ratio of almost 17 to 1, a big change from the Cold War when the same ratio was about 1.8 to 1. Never before in history had any country so many allies. Ostrovsky outlined a political-economic rule which, he claims, has a very few exceptions: countries with the nominal per capita GDP above the world average formally or informally ally with the United States.

These are not alliances in the Westphalian sense characterized by impermanence and power-balancing; rather it is a hegemonic system of the Roman kind. Most states of the world host the hegemonic bases, many of them partly cover expenses for running them (&quot;host nation support&quot;), integrate their strategic forces under the hegemonic command, contribute 1-2% of their GDP to the integrated forces, and tip military, economic and humanitarian contributions in case of the hegemonic campaigns worldwide. Actually, these states, some of them recent great powers, surrender their strategic sovereignty &quot;en masse&quot; in favor of the hegemonic stability.

==== External balancing ====
While the hegemonic bloc concentration is overwhelming, anti-hegemonic military alliances do not form. No power entangles itself in military alliance against the United States. &quot;No counter-hegemonic coalition has taken shape, and none is on the horizon.&quot; The only visible pattern to the relations between Moscow and Beijing since the late 1950s is that there is no pattern. There is no evidence that they want to transform their strategic partnership into a military alliance and much evidence to suggest that they do not.

==== China ====
The United States is still considered by most analysts to be at the top of the world, both economically and in terms of military strength. With these abundant resources and power, the world remains &quot;a single superpower world&quot;. However, many analysts envisage the emergence of new giants which threaten the U.S. hegemony. These giants, they argue, create new power centers all over the world and the world becomes ever more multipolar. Of those new giants, the single greatest competitor of United States is China as it is growing rapidly with &quot;no equal in modern history&quot;. Historically, examples of hegemonic decline come in two prime sectors: the leading state&#x27;s military and its economy. Both arenas are crucial for the analysis of the shifting power structure. 

With the highest gross domestic product at purchasing power parity, China poses a significant challenge to U.S. economic primacy especially with the expectation that U.S. national debt could explode to 717% of GDP by 2080 according to Congressional Budget office. Moreover, this debt is financed largely by China through the purchase of U.S. Treasury bonds. On the other hand, China&#x27;s economic power, not limited to but including industrialization and modernization, is rapidly burgeoning with high consumption and increasing foreign investment. As Global Trends 2025 points out, the rise of China and India to great power status will restore each to &quot;the positions they held two centuries ago when China produced approximately 30 percent and India 15 percent of the world&#x27;s wealth.&quot;

By 2018, Michael Beckley counted hundreds of books and thousands of articles envisioning the decline of the US, the rise of China and the multipolar world, and outlined an element common to these works—they all relied on gross indicators of power, such as GDP or military spending. These are the same indicators that made China look like a superpower during its century of humiliation (1839-1911). They reflect large population but do not consider welfare costs—the expenses a nation pays to provide this population with food, health care, social security, police, administration and education. Deducting these costs from gross indicators would give net indicators. Beckley suggests considering GDP per capita, more precisely multiplying it by total GDP. According to this net indicator, China still lags far behind the US.

Writing in 1992, Andrew L. Shapiro assured regarding the U.S.: With troops operating abroad in more than fifty-five countries, &quot;a military force is extended so much that it nears a breaking point.&quot; After three decades of &quot;nearing a breaking point,&quot; the U.S administration approved a record–breaking peacetime national defense budget of $813 billion. Meanwhile, Shapiro continued in 1992, China is taking advantage by industrializing its army using their wealth. China&#x27;s military budget is increasing, and the troops are expanding. A decade later, Steven W. Mosher insisted that China is building up its armed forces &quot;to break America&#x27;s back in Asia and thus end America&#x27;s reign as the sole superpower in the world.&quot;

Regarding military development in China, by 2022, China was estimated to accumulate between 350 and 400 nuclear warheads, just exceeding Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s force de frappe and 15 times short of the U.S. arsenal. The disparity of the delivery means is even greater. As of 2023, China has not yet introduced its first intercontinental bomber, the longest-range Chinese Xian H-6 bombers can only reach Guam.

As of 2023, China has two outdated Kuznezov-type aircraft carriers. When China purchased the first, analysts supposed that it would serve as a tourist attraction like Soviet carriers &quot;Kiev&quot; and &quot;Minsk&quot; used to. The Chinese anti-hegemonic challenge is like horizon - never gets closer.

Furthermore, many argue that China has a symbiotic relationship with the United States. If the United States declines, it is likely that China also may be in jeopardy. John Gulick points out that China&#x27;s prosperity is &quot;deeply ensconced in the &#x27;China produces and lends, the US borrows and spends&#x27; framework&quot;. Economic interdependence of China derives from the fact that they are a producing state rather than a consuming state. China&#x27;s economy is export heavy as its driving force lies in &quot;export processing measures&quot;. The export dependent structure could severely dampen economic growth if demand for Chinese exports is reduced by another economic crisis in the United States. Besides the economic interdependence, China might face additional barriers to its hegemonic aspirations, such as domestic political instability, environmental degradation, public health issues, and demographic trends.

==== Russia ====
More revisionist appeared Russia under Vladimir Putin. Repeatedly he addressed the international community with anti-hegemonic agenda, arguing that the post-Cold War hegemony is unstable: &quot;After the dissolution of bipolarity on the planet, we no longer have stability.&quot; Key international institutions are ignored by the United States and its western allies. They use force against sovereign states. Instead of settling conflicts they contribute to their escalation, instead of democracy and freedom they support a very dubious public ranging from neo-fascists to Islamic radicals, and instead of stable states they produce chaos, outbreaks in violence and a series of upheavals. A &quot;unilateral diktat&quot; leads to instability.

The Russian foreign policy under Putin steadily became more aggressive, culminating with the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. The United States responded with sanctions and military aid to Ukraine. This U.S. response was criticized by some officials and experts as appeasement. Timo S. Koster who served at NATO as Director of Defence Policy &amp; Capabilities criticized: A massacre is taking place in Europe and the strongest military alliance in the world is staying out of it. Philip Breedlove, a retired four-star U.S. Air Force general and a former SACEUR, said that the West have &quot;ceded the initiative to the enemy.&quot; No attempt was made by NATO to deter Moscow with the threat of military force, as expressed by another expert. Nevertheless, the U.S. response, combined with similar measures by the NATO allies and the Ukrainian resistance, was enough to roll back the Russian troops on most fronts and, as of 2023, reduce the Russian conquests to the regions with pro-Russian majority.

== Test against historical evidence ==
=== Complications ===
The first complication for testing the HST against history is the absence of a case to test. The world hegemony is unprecedented. William Wohlforth emphasized that we are living in the world&#x27;s first hegemonic system. Even the leading Realist opponent of the HST agreed on the matter: A dominant power without rivals rising to challenge is a position without precedent. Hence, Walt concluded in 2009, there is not yet consensus on the overall impact of hegemony. The phenomenon is recent and has yet to receive a sustained theoretical attention.

Moreover, the historical IR research remains Eurocentric and Europe has not experienced pan-European hegemony since the fall of Rome. The world during the Pax Britannica was multipolar rather than hegemonic and the period is characterized by hegemonic rivalry rather than stability. Earlier modern European powers named hegemonic in some works, such as the Netherlands, Spain and Portugal, were even less hegemonic than Britain. Gilpin noted that Portugal and the Netherlands only dominated trade. Modern Europe before 1990 had never been hegemonic system, which by definition has only one unrivaled power. 

A product of eurocentric research, the Hegemonic Stability Theory was as much theory about instability. In a cyclical pattern, the hegemonic stability would be followed by violent hegemonic power transition to rising competitors (Gilpin, Modelski, Organsky). Periods of expansion are followed by equilibrium which is “merely a temporary phenomenon in the continuing process of international political change.” Organsky, having combined the Hegemonic Stability Theory with the Power transition theory, created a perfect oxymoron. Bound to the modern Europe, the IR research found dubious hegemons, drew from these cases the paradigm of imminent hegemonic fall and implied it to the United States: 
=== Beyond modern Europe ===
With the American hegemony counting its first decade (since 1990) and showing no signs of collapse in sight, several IR scholars supposed that to find something similar even on regional scale it is necessary to descend to pre-modern times and extend the scope beyond Europe. In 2007, two books devoted to pre-modern civilizations came to light. One was edited by Wohlforth with contributions from experts on several pre-modern civilizations. One of the contributors was Victoria Tin-bor Hui, whose civilization (China) experienced centuries-long unipolar stability. The other book was by Max Ostrovsky, who completed two degrees in world history and PhD in International Relations. This book became the first attempt of theory by a professional historian and at the same time the first IR research extensively based on primary sources.

Both works found that most civilizations most of time were unipolar and the European long balance of power was exceptional in world history. Victoria Tin-bor Hui and Ostrovsky explained it by the expanding nature of the European system, while hegemonic stability needs a geopolitically closed system. The next complication, however, was the kind of unipolarity. Most of unipolar civilizations were universal empires rather than system-wide hegemonies. The former are distinct by formal rule, territorial conquest and annexation, and regular taxation. The team of Wohlforth disregarded this complication. Ostrovsky found in world history three system-wide hegemonies—Sumer, Qin in 364-221 BC and Rome in 189-63 BC.

=== Three known cases ===
The first striking element is that system-wide hegemonies were rare occasions in world history. The second striking element is that all three known hegemonies were anything but stable. Ostrovsky tested the HST on the three known cases: The hegemon of Sumer, House of Kish, sent envoys to Gilgamesh. Gilgamesh addressed the assembly of warriors: &quot;Let us not submit to the House of Kish, let us smite it with weapons!&quot; The assembly wholeheartedly agreed. &quot;At the word of the fighting men of his city his heart rejoiced, his spirit brightened.&quot; A battle was fought and the hegemon was defeated and imprisoned. Hegemony is as old as history. According to the &quot;Sumerian King List&quot;, Kish established the hegemony yet before the Flood. The anti-hegemonic resistance dates to the same dawn of history too, recorded in one of the earliest literary legacies of mankind.

The hegemonic Qin did not produce anymore stability. The Warring States went more warring. Qin emerged victorious and hegemonic after a war in 364 BC. Shortly, almost all the rest of the Chinese world united into an anti-hegemonic alliance, called Vertical or Perpendicular, and at least once the whole Chinese world &quot;united their wills and joined their forces to attack Qin.&quot; &quot;With a force of 1,000,000 soldiers drown from area ten times large than Qin, they beat upon the Pass [to the land of Qin] and pressed forward toward Qin.&quot; The same dreadful scenario repeated itself several times. Massive anti-hegemonic alliances characterized the period. As in Sumer, in the Warring-States China hegemony was bound with anti-hegemony. The Qin armies repeatedly crashed the anti-hegemonic alliances in at least 15 major campaigns Eventually, Qin launched a universal conquest and established universal empire.

The contemporary to Qin Roman hegemony was more stable with longer periods of peace, but almost each generation the system experienced major wars. The last war against Macedonia (148 BC) and the last Punic War (146 BC) were wars of annexation. Three Mithridatic Wars (88-63 BC) were anti-hegemonic wars led by Pontus and similarly ended by annexation of Pontus and the Near East. In the course of these and other wars, Rome, like Qin, evolved from hegemony into universal empire.

&quot;Balance of power, repeatedly remarked two proponents of hegemonic stability, predicts that states will try to prevent the rise of a hegemon; it tells us nothing about what will happen once a country establishes such a position,&quot; nor history yields such an implication. History, however, yields. Rome and Qin were well established hegemons but were repeatedly counter-balanced by rival powers or coalitions until they conquered and annexed them.

=== Hegemonic stage ===
Historic cases of system-wide hegemonies accord Balance of Power theory rather than the HST—anti-hegemonic balancing happened and on large scales, as Balance of Power predicts. The only difference is that counter-balancing did not lead to the restoration of balance in the system but in the opposite direction—the hegemonies prevailed and established universal empires. Hence, Ostrovsky concluded that the three cases - of Qin, Rome and the US - are analogous systemic transformations from warring states to hegemony to universal empire with the modern process being presently uncompleted.

Remarkably, all three great powers, Rome, Qin and the US were on the edge of the contemporary civilization and geographically protected, Rome by sea, Qin by mountain ranges and the US by oceans. All three began by the policy of isolation using their natural barriers. Rome initially maintained the doctrine of &quot;no foreign foot in Italy&quot; and later of &quot;no foreign foot in Europe;&quot; Qin began with analogous policy of no foreign foot within the passes. And the US began with the policy of isolation and no foreign foot in the Americas. All three abandoned isolationism in favor of hegemony. Rome and Qin were the only cases in world history when great powers first established a system-wide hegemony and later universal empire. All other known universal empires were established directly out of the system of warring states and avoiding the hegemonic stage. Probably geographic isolation favors this particular hegemonic stage.

Earlier, Pentagon strategist, Edward Luttwak, turned into Roman historian and produced a famous research on the Roman hegemony. Implicitly advocating hegemony for the United States, Luttwak argued that transforming hegemony into empire was Rome&#x27;s fatal mistake. By contrast to empire, hegemony saves much power.

Basing on the comparative analysis between Rome and Qin instead of the single case of Rome, Ostrovsky countered that the transformation of hegemony into empire is not always fatal mistake - China still exists. And in both cases the transformation resulted in a more stable order and &quot;Golden Age.&quot; Replying on Luttwak&#x27;s thesis of the &quot;economy of force&quot; by a hegemonic power, Ostrovsky suggested that it &quot;naturally results in the economy of obedience by a ruled periphery.&quot; A year after Ostrovsky published this anti-thesis, Russia invaded Georgia and began ever more anti-hegemonic policy, culminating with a full scale invasion of Ukraine.

=== Permanent hegemony ===
The anti-hegemonic initiative of Vladimir Putin, however, fell short. No major power joined him in the endeavor, international opposition was unanimous and his troops were forced to retreat on most fronts, holding only regions with pro-Russian majority as of 2023. Yet four years before Russia suffered the setback in Ukraine, Ostrovsky completed an advanced analysis of the present hegemonic stability. The latter analysis indicated that, despite the best efforts by Putin, the anti-hegemonic resistance in our world is incomparably weaker than in the ancient Roman and Chinese worlds, and the overall trend in our world is toward hegemonic stabilization. &quot;At this point, he concludes, world history runs out of samples.&quot; World history knows stability of universal empires; it does not know hegemonic stability and hegemonic systems themselves were exceptional. But the real puzzle history poses to the HST is not why the American hegemony did not fall but rather why it did not evolve into empire and, for the first time in world history, produced hegemonic stability.

<doc id="1295714" wikidata="Q3295439" url="?curid=1295714" title="Henery Hawk">
<text>Henery Hawk is an American cartoon character who appears in twelve comedy film shorts produced in the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series. His first appearance is in the 1942 theatrical release &quot;The Squawkin&#x27; Hawk&quot;, which was directed by Chuck Jones and produced by Leon Schlesinger. Henery&#x27;s second screen appearance, one directed by Robert McKimson, is in &quot;Walky Talky Hawky&quot; (1946), which also features the characters Foghorn Leghorn and Barnyard Dawg in their first cartoon roles. The last Warner Brothers theatrical short to showcase the little chickenhawk is the 1961 release &quot;Strangled Eggs&quot; in which he co-stars again with Foghorn Leghorn as well as with another popular character of that period, Miss Prissy. Following that production, Henery continued to be seen periodically in other animated presentations such as &quot;The Looney Tunes Show&quot; and &quot;Looney Tunes Cartoons&quot;.

==Character biography==
Henery is a small, brown chickenhawk with a forelock of feathers. The young bird lives at home with his parents, speaks with tough-guy bravado, and shows surprising strength to pull or deadlift prey more than three times his size. He was played in the first short by Kent Rogers. Rogers died in 1944, so the role was then taken over by Mel Blanc (and later by Joe Alaskey and then Jeff Bergman). Henery has a high-pitched voice with a New York accent and perpetually angry temperament. (With these characteristics, he became the later inspiration for the Hanna-Barbera character Scrappy-Doo.)

In a typical Foghorn/Henery cartoon, Henery strikes out on his own for the first time, eager to capture (and presumably consume) a chicken. Having led a sheltered life, however, he does not know what a chicken looks like, only that chicken hawks eat them. Foghorn presumes that this diminutive, naïve troublemaker is no real threat; however, seeing the potential for annoyance, he points and manipulates Henery in the direction of Barnyard Dawg. The remainder of the cartoon is usually consumed by Dawg and Leghorn alternately assuring Henery that the other is a chicken and encouraging him to attack the &quot;chicken&quot; mercilessly. In a reversal, the cartoon &quot;The Foghorn Leghorn&quot; has Foghorn wanting Henery to believe Foghorn is a chicken, where Henery believes Foghorn is merely a &quot;loud-mouthed shnook,&quot; supposedly a separate kind of creature. Later, when Barnyard Dawg calls Foghorn a &quot;good-for-nothing chicken&quot;, Henery finally wises up.

Many cartoons ended with Henery capturing one (or both) of his tormentors, pragmatically shrugging his shoulders over whether his prey may or may not be an actual fowl. Typically, Henery would decide that one of them must be a real chicken; therefore, he would knock out and capture both, after threatening them with the catch-phrase &quot;Are you comin&#x27; quietly, or do I have to muss ya up!?&quot;

Henery Hawk is also a supporting character in the Looney Tunes comic books; in pre-1970s stories, he often starred in features of his own, typically played against Oliver Owl as well as Foghorn.

Henery was going to have a cameo in &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, but was later dropped for unknown reasons.

Henery Hawk made a brief cameo appearance in the bleacher scenes of the 1996 film &quot;Space Jam&quot;, and has a supporting role in the 2000 film &quot;Tweety&#x27;s High-Flying Adventure&quot;.

In the 2010s series &quot;The Looney Tunes Show&quot;, Henery Hawk appeared in the episode &quot;Fish and Visitors&quot;, in the Merrie Melodies segment &quot;Chickenhawk&quot; (sung by Barnyard Dawg) where he tries to eat Foghorn Leghorn while Foghorn tries to break him of his craving. In &quot;Father Figures,&quot; Porky Pig becomes the father figure of Henery Hawk who wants Porky to get him chicken.

In 2011, Henery Hawk appeared in a commercial for GEICO along with Foghorn Leghorn. In the commercial, Foghorn was serving as a reader for a &quot;book on tape&quot; version of the Charles Dickens novel &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; when Henery—sick and tired of Foghorn&#x27;s ad-libbing—takes a club and hits Foghorn with it off-camera.

Henery makes a cameo in &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale: Rescue Rangers&quot; on a box meal.

<doc id="1295715" wikidata="Q321563" url="?curid=1295715" title="Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli">
<text>Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli (1397 – 10 May 1482) was an Italian mathematician, astronomer, and cosmographer.

== Life ==

Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli was born in Florence, the son of the physician Domenico Toscanelli and Biagia Mei. There is no precise information on his education and background. Gustavo Uzielli claimed in 1894 that Toscanelli studied at the University of Padua, but modern authors consider this pure conjecture. Toscanelli lived most of his life in Florence, with occasional excursions to Todi and Rome. He is said to have entered into correspondence with scholars around Europe, but his writings have yet to be thoroughly researched.

Thanks to his long life, his intelligence and his wide interests, Toscanelli was one of the central figures in the intellectual and cultural history of Renaissance Florence in its early years. His circle of friends included Filippo Brunelleschi, the architect of the Florence Cathedral, and the philosopher Marsilio Ficino. He knew the mathematician, writer and architect Leon Battista Alberti, and his closest friend was Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa—himself a wide-ranging intellect and early humanist, who dedicated two short mathematical works in 1445 to Toscanelli, and made himself and Toscanelli the interlocutors in a 1458 dialogue titled &quot;On Squaring the Circle&quot; (&quot;De quadratura circuli&quot;). When Nicholas of Cusa was on his death bed in the remote Perugian town of Todi in 1464, Toscanelli traversed 120 miles from Florence to be with him.

Toscanelli along with Nicholas of Cusa appears to have belonged to a network of Florentine and Roman intellectuals who searched for and studied Greek mathematical works, along with Filelfo, George of Trebizond, and the humanist Pope Nicholas V, in company with Alberti and Brunelleschi.

=== Cartography ===

According to one theory, in 1439, the Greek philosopher Gemistos Plethon, attending the Council of Florence, acquainted Toscanelli with the extensive travels, writings and mapping of the 1st century BC/AD Greek geographer Strabo, hitherto unknown in Italy. Nearly 35 years later, the Italian was to follow up this amplified knowledge.

In 1474, Toscanelli sent a letter and a map to his Portuguese correspondent Fernão Martins, priest at the Lisbon Cathedral, detailing a scheme for sailing westwards to reach the Spice Islands and Asia. Fernão Martins delivered his letter to the King Afonso V of Portugal, in his court of Lisbon. The original of this letter was lost, but its existence is known through Toscanelli himself, who later transcribed it along with the map and sent it to Christopher Columbus, who carried them with him during his first voyage to the New World. Toscanelli had miscalculated Asia as being 5,000 miles longer than it really was, and Columbus miscalculated the circumference of the Earth by 25 percent: both of which resulted in Columbus not realizing initially he had found a new continent.

An uncorroborated story links Toscanelli’s attendance at a Chinese delegation to the Pope in 1432, when many Chinese inventions were discussed, with a flood of drawings made around the same year by the artist-engineer Taccola (1382 – c.1453), which were later developed by Brunelleschi and Leonardo da Vinci. In a 1474 letter by Toscanelli to Columbus, the authenticity of which has been a matter of disagreement among scholars, Toscanelli mentions the visit of men from Cathay (China) during the reign of Pope Eugenius IV (1431–1447):

It has been suggested that the man in question may have been Niccolo da Conti, who was returning from the east and is known to have met with Pope Eugenius in 1444.

In a second letter, Toscanelli describes further these men as extremely learned and willing to share their knowledge:

=== Astronomy ===
Toscanelli is noted for his observations of six comets, one in 1472, two in 1457, one in 1456 (which was to be named Halley&#x27;s Comet after Edmond Halley predicted its return in 1759), one in 1449, and one in 1433.

In 1475 he pierced a hole in the dome of Florence Cathedral making a gnomon at above the pavement to create a meridian line. The height precluded the installation of a complete meridian line of the floor of the cathedral, but allowed a short section of approximately to run between the main altar and the north wall of the transept. This allows for observation for around 35 days either side of the summer equinox.

<text>The Squawkin&#x27; Hawk is a 1942 &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoon directed by Chuck Jones. The short was released on August 8, 1942, and is the first to star the young Henery Hawk. It was animated by Phil Monroe and was written by Michael Maltese, the latter being his first collaboration with Jones.

==Plot==
Junior wants a chicken for dinner, saying that he is a chicken hawk. His mother insists he eat a worm, or he will get no supper. Junior refuses, much to the worm&#x27;s relief. Junior&#x27;s mother puts him to bed and tells him to &quot;go right to sleep&quot;. Henery sneaks out his house at bedtime, then goes to the chicken coop and soon finds a rooster and his hen, Hazel, who has a panic reaction at the sound of the words &quot;chicken hawk&quot;. The rooster chases him until his mother spots him and sends him home. He is again told to eat a worm and again refuses and says he wants a &quot;chicken&quot;, at which point the worm gives him a big kiss on the beak.

==Reception==
&quot;The Film Daily&quot; called the short &quot;Good&quot;, saying, &quot;The adventures of a baby chicken hawk who goes out prowling for chicken after refusing to sup on worms are treated with loads of fun in this Technicolor short.&quot;

<doc id="1295736" wikidata="Q458618" url="?curid=1295736" title="Noah Gordon (novelist)">
<text>Noah Gordon (November 11, 1926November 22, 2021) was an American novelist.

==Early life and career==
Gordon was born in Worcester, Massachusetts, on November 11, 1926, the son of a pawnbroker. He served in the US Army at the end of World War II. He reported for the &quot;Worcester Telegram&quot; until he was hired by the &quot;Boston Herald&quot; in 1959.

==Works and reception==
Some of the topics covered within his novels include medical history and medical ethics. Later he began to focus more on themes relating to the Inquisition and Jewish cultural history.

Gordon&#x27;s debut novel, &quot;The Rabbi&quot;, spent 26 weeks on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list in 1965. When publishing &quot;The Physician&quot;, the book was picked up by Random House - Germany, which promoted the book in Europe, where Gordon became very popular in Spain and Italy. His novel &quot;The Last Jew&quot; won &quot;Que Leer Prize&quot; (Spain) and &quot;Boccaccio Literary Prize&quot; (Italy).

Though Gordon&#x27;s reception internationally has been quite strong, as of 2015, the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; described Gordon as relatively unknown in the United States. &quot;New York Times&quot; writer Carey Goldberg described a similar tension between Gordon&#x27;s widespread popularity in Germany and relative lack of awareness in the United States in 1996. The reasons for the European success of his novel &quot;The Physician&quot; were discussed in the &quot;Forward&quot;.

His novel &quot;Shaman&quot; won the first James Fenimore Cooper Prize for Best Historical Fiction in 1993.

==Personal life==
Gordon had three children with his wife, Lorraine (&quot;née&quot; Seay). He died on November 22, 2021, in Dedham, Massachusetts, at the age of 95.

<text>Friedrich Wilhelm Ritschl (6 April 1806 – 9 November 1876) was a German scholar best known for his studies of Plautus.

==Biography==
Ritschl was born in Großvargula, in present-day Thuringia. His family, in which culture and poverty were hereditary, were Protestants who had migrated several generations earlier from Bohemia. Ritschl was fortunate in his school training, at a time when the great reform in the higher schools of Prussia had not yet been thoroughly carried out. His chief teacher, Spitzner, a pupil of Gottfried Hermann, divined the boy&#x27;s genius and allowed it free growth, applying only so much either of stimulus or of restraint as was absolutely needful. After a wasted year at the University of Leipzig, where Hermann stood at the zenith of his fame, Ritschl passed in 1826 to Halle.

Here he came under the powerful influence of Christian Karl Reisig, a young Hermannianer with exceptional talent, a fascinating personality and a rare gift for instilling into his pupils his own ardour for classical study. The great controversy between the Realists and the Verbalists was then at its height, and Ritschl naturally sided with Hermann against Böckh. The early death of Reisig in 1828 did not sever Ritschl from Halle, where he began his professorial career with a great reputation and brilliant success, but soon hearers fell away, and the pinch of poverty compelled his removal to Breslau, where he reached the rank of ordinary professor in 1834, and held other offices.

The great event of Ritschl&#x27;s life was a sojourn of nearly a year in Italy (1836–37), spent in libraries and museums, and more particularly in the laborious examination of the Ambrosian palimpsest of Plautus at Milan. The remainder of his life was largely occupied in working out the material then gathered and the ideas then conceived. Bonn, where he moved on his marriage in 1839, and where he remained for twenty-six years, was the great scene of his activity both as scholar and as teacher.

The philological seminary which he controlled, although nominally only joint-director with Welcker, became a veritable &quot;officina litterarum&quot;, a kind of Isocratean school of classical study; in it were trained many of the foremost scholars of the late 19th century. The names of G. Curtius, Ihne, Schleicher, Bernays, Ribbeck, Lorenz, Vahlen, Hübner, Bücheler, Helbig, Benndorf, Riese, Windisch, and Nietzsche, who were his pupils either at Bonn or at Leipzig, attest his fame and power as a teacher. In 1854 Otto Jahn took the place of the venerable Welcker at Bonn, and after a time succeeded in dividing with Ritschl the empire over the philological school there. The two had been friends, but after gradual estrangement a violent dispute arose between them in 1865, which for many months divided into two hostile forces the universities and the press of Germany. Both sides were steeped in fault, but Ritschl undoubtedly received harsh treatment from the Prussian government, and pressed his resignation. He accepted a call to Leipzig, where he died in harness in 1876. Ritschl was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1868.

==Character==
Ritschl&#x27;s character was strongly marked. The spirited element in him was powerful, and to some at times he seemed overbearing, but his nature was noble at the core; and, though intolerant of inefficiency and stupidity, he never asserted his personal claims in any mean or petty way. He was warmly attached to family and friends, and yearned continually after sympathy, yet he established real intimacy with only a few. He had a great faculty for organization, as is shown by his administration of the university library at Bonn, and by the eight years of labour which carried to success a work of infinite complexity, the famous &quot;Priscae Latinitatis Monumenta Epigraphica&quot; (Bonn, 1862). This volume presents in admirable facsimile, with prefatory notices and indexes, the Latin inscriptions from the earliest times to the end of the Republic. It forms an introductory volume to the &quot;Berlin Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum&quot;, the excellence of which is largely due to the precept and example of Ritschl, though he had no hand in the later volumes. The results of Ritschl&#x27;s life are mainly gathered up in a long series of monographs, for the most part of the highest finish, and rich in ideas which leavened the scholarship of the time.

==Scholarship==
As a scholar, Ritschl was of the lineage of Bentley, to whom he looked up, like Hermann, with fervent admiration. His best efforts were spent in studying the languages and literatures of Greece and Rome, rather than the life of the Greeks and Romans. He was sometimes, but most unjustly, charged with taking a narrow view of philology. That he keenly appreciated the importance of ancient institutions and ancient art both his published papers and the records of his lectures amply testify. He devoted himself for the most part to the study of ancient poetry, and in particular of the early Latin drama. This formed the centre from which his investigations radiated. Starting from this he ranged over the whole remains of pre-Ciceronian Latin, and not only analysed but augmented the sources from which our knowledge of it must come. Before Ritschl the acquaintance of scholars with early Latin was so dim and restricted that it would perhaps be hardly an exaggeration to call him its real discoverer.

==Plautus==
To the world in general Ritschl was best known as a student of Plautus. He cleared away the accretions of ages, and by efforts of that real genius which goes hand in hand with labor, brought to light many of the true features of the original. It is infinitely to be regretted that Ritschl&#x27;s results were never combined to form that monumental edition of Plautus of which he dreamed in his earlier life. Ritschl&#x27;s examination of the Plautine manuscripts was both laborious and brilliant, and greatly extended the knowledge of Plautus and of the ancient Latin drama. Of this, two striking examples may be cited. By the aid of the Ambrosian palimpsest he recovered the name T Maccius Plautus, for the vulgate M Accius, and proved it correct by strong, extraneous arguments. On the margin of the Palatine manuscripts the marks &quot;C&quot; and &quot;DV&quot; continually recur, and had been variously explained. Ritschl proved that they meant &quot;Canticum&quot; and &quot;Diverbium&quot;, and hence showed that in the Roman comedy only the conversations in &quot;iambic senarii&quot; were not intended for the singing voice. Thus was brought into strong relief a fact without which there can be no true appreciation of Plautus, viz., that his plays were comic operas rather than comic dramas.

In conjectural criticism Ritschl was inferior not only to his great predecessors but to some of his contemporaries. His imagination was in this field (but in this field only) hampered by erudition, and his judgment was unconsciously warped by the desire to find in his text illustrations of his discoveries. But still a fair proportion of his textual labours has stood the test of time, and he rendered immense service by his study of Plautine metres, a field in which little advance had been made since the time of Bentley. In this matter Ritschl was aided by an accomplishment rare (as he himself lamented) in Germany, the art of writing Latin verse.

In spite of the incompleteness, on many sides, of his work, Ritschl must be assigned a place in the history of learning among a very select few. His studies are presented principally in his &quot;Opuscula&quot; collected partly before and partly since his death. The &quot;Trinummus&quot; (twice edited) was the only specimen of his contemplated edition of Plautus which he completed. The edition has been continued by some of his pupils--Georg Goetz, Gustav Loewe, and others.

==Recommendation of Nietzsche==
Ritschl recommended that his student, Friedrich Nietzsche, be considered for the position of professor at the University of Basel. He described Nietzsche in the following words. 

However many young talents I have seen develop under my eyes for thirty-nine years now, &quot;never yet&quot; have I known a young man, or tried to help one along in my field as best I could, who was so mature as early and as young as this Nietzsche. His &quot;Museum&quot; articles he wrote in the second and third year of his &quot;triennium&quot;. He is the first from whom I have ever accepted any contribution at all while he was still a student. If — God grant — he lives long enough, I prophesy that he will one day stand in the front rank of German philology. He is now twenty-four years old: strong, vigorous, healthy, courageous physically and morally, so constituted as to impress those of a similar nature. On top of that, he possesses the enviable gift of presenting ideas, talking freely, as calmly as he speaks skillfully and clearly. He is the idol and, without wishing it, the leader of the whole younger generation of philologists here in Leipzig who — and they are rather numerous — cannot wait to hear him as a lecturer. You will say, I describe a phenomenon. Well, that is just what he is — and at the same time pleasant and modest. Also a gifted musician, which is irrelevant here. ... Nietzsche is not at all a specifically political nature. He may have in general, on the whole, some sympathy for the growing greatness of Germany, but, like myself, no special &quot;tendre&quot; [fondness] for Prussianism; yet he has vivid feeling for free civic and spiritual development, and thus certainly a heart for your Swiss institutions and way of living. What more am I to say? His studies so far have been weighted toward the history of Greek literature (of course, including critical and exegetical treatment of the authors), with special emphasis, it seems to me, on the history of Greek philosophy. But I have not the least doubt that, if confronted by a practical demand, with his great gifts he will work in other fields with the best of success. He will simply be able to do anything he wants to do.

Walter Kaufmann described the unusual situation as follows. &quot;But Nietzsche had not yet fulfilled his residence requirement and hence had no doctorate. So Ritschl expected the case to be hopeless, &#x27;although in the present instance,&#x27; he wrote, &#x27;I should stake my whole philological and academic reputation that the matter would work out happily.&#x27; It is hardly surprising that Basel decided to ignore the &#x27;formal insufficiency.&#x27; Ritschl was delighted: &#x27;In &quot;Germany&quot;, that sort of thing happens absolutely never.&#x27;.&quot;

Nietzsche was beginning to lose interest in philology at the time, due to his intense interests in science, Wagner&#x27;s music, and Schopenhauer&#x27;s philosophy. Kaufmann continued: &quot;His call to the university of Basel came as a surprise to Nietzsche, who had not yet received his doctorate though he had published some fruits of his research in a scholarly journal. He had actually considered giving up philology for science when, on Ritschl&#x27;s recommendation, he was appointed a professor of classical philology at Basel, and Leipzig hurriedly conferred the doctorate without examination.&quot;

Nietzsche&#x27;s consuming interest in philosophy, however, soon overcame his work in philology. His first published book, &quot;The Birth of Tragedy&quot;, effectively ended his career as professor. &quot;Ritschl dismissed the book as &quot;geistreich Schweinerei&quot;, &#x27;brilliant bull.&#x27; &quot; Enrollment in Nietzsche&#x27;s classes briefly suffered in the wake of the book&#x27;s poor reception by Classics professionals generally. He retired due to migraines and other physical disabilities at the age of thirty-five. Ritschl&#x27;s prophecy had been the direct opposite of the course of events.

Schurz gave an impromptu speech which was well received, and after the adjournment Ritschl met him and asked his age and was disappointed that at nineteen Schurz was still too young to be a member of the planned parliament.

<doc id="1295752" wikidata="Q5416684" url="?curid=1295752" title="Event-driven finite-state machine">
<text>In computation, a finite-state machine (FSM) is event driven if the transition from one state to another is triggered by an event or a message. This is in contrast to the parsing-theory origins of the term finite-state machine where the machine is described as consuming characters or tokens. 

Often these machines are implemented as threads or processes communicating with one another as part of a larger application. For example, a telecommunication protocol is most of the time implemented as an event-driven finite-state machine.

==Example in C==
This code describes the state machine for a very basic car radio system. It is basically an infinite loop that reads incoming events. The state machine is only 2 states: radio mode, or CD mode. The event is either a mode change from radio to cd back and forth, or a go to next (next preset for radio or next track for CD). 
/********************************************************************/
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
typedef enum {
 ST_RADIO,
 ST_CD
} STATES;

typedef enum {
 EVT_MODE,
 EVT_NEXT
} EVENTS;

EVENTS readEventFromMessageQueue(void);
int main(void)
 /* Default state is radio */ 
 STATES state = ST_RADIO;
 int stationNumber = 0;
 int trackNumber = 0;

 /* Infinite loop */
 while (1)
 /* Read the next incoming event. Usually this is a blocking function. */
 EVENTS event = readEventFromMessageQueue();

 /* Switch the state and the event to execute the right transition. */
 switch (state)
 case ST_RADIO:
 switch (event)
 case EVT_MODE:
 /* Change the state */
 state = ST_CD;
 break;
 case EVT_NEXT:
 /* Increase the station number */
 stationNumber++;
 break;
 break;

 case ST_CD:
 switch (event)
 case EVT_MODE:
 /* Change the state */
 state = ST_RADIO;
 break;
 case EVT_NEXT:
 /* Go to the next track */
 trackNumber++;
 break;
 break;
 }

==Same example in Ginr==

Ginr is an industrial-strength compiler producing multitape finite state automata from rational patterns, functions and relations expressed in semiring algebraic terms. The example below shows a binary rational function equivalent to the above example, with an additional transition (nil, radio) to set the system into its initial state. Here the input symbols nil, mode, next denote events that drive a transducer with output effectors cd, nextTrack, radio, nextStation. Expressions like this are generally much easier to express and maintain than explicit listings of transitions.
Compilation produces a subsequential (single-valued) binary transducer mapping sequences of events to sequences of effectors that actuate features of the CD/radio device.

Modelling discrete systems in this manner obtains a clean separation of syntax (acceptable ordering of events) and semantics (effector implementation). The syntactic order of events and their extension into the semantic domain is expressed in a symbolic (semiring) domain where they can be manipulated algebraically while semantics are expressed in a procedural programming language as simple effector functions, free from syntactic concerns. The rational expressions provide concise holistic maps of the protocols that effect system governance. The compiled automata are post-processed to obtain efficient controllers for run-time deployment.

<doc id="1295781" wikidata="Q2455738" url="?curid=1295781" title="National Salvation Front (Romania)">
<text>The National Salvation Front (, FSN) was the most important political organization formed during the Romanian Revolution in December 1989, which became the governing body of Romania in the first weeks after the collapse of the communist regime. It subsequently became a political party, the largest post-communist party, and won the 1990 election with 66% of the national vote, under the leadership of then-President Ion Iliescu, who was elected with 85% of the vote. 

Iliescu nominated again Petre Roman as the Prime Minister of the first cabinet formed after the first free and fair elections. After the fourth ”mineriadă”, Roman was forced to resign. The controversy between the two national leaders was finalized in 1992, at the national Congress of FSN, when the party split in two: the Democratic National Salvation Front (FDSN), under the leadership of President Iliescu; and FSN, under the leadership of Petre Roman (in 1993, it was the renamed as the Democratic Party (PD).

The National Salvation Front (FSN) founded by Iliescu and Roman was the common root of two of the largest active political parties in post-communist Romania: the Social Democratic Party (PSD) and the Democratic Party (PD, later the Democratic Liberal Party, PDL, after the merger with a splinter group from PNL, the Liberal Democratic Party, PLD). In 2014, the second party (the former PD; then PDL) merged into the National Liberal Party (PNL).

==History==
===Formation and rise to power===
In March 1989 six prominent members of the Romanian Communist Party (PCR) wrote an open letter to President Nicolae Ceaușescu that criticised his abuses of power and his economic policies. The so-called &quot;Letter of the Six&quot; was circulated in the Western media and read on Radio Free Europe.

In 1989, before the 14th Congress of the Romanian Communist Party, two letters signed &quot;National Salvation Front&quot; began circulating. They were read on Radio Free Europe on 27 August and 8 November. The first letter had a number of questions about Ceaușescu&#x27;s mismanagement of the economy and human rights violations, while the second letter appealed to the Congress not to re-elect Ceaușescu.

The creation of the FSN was officially announced to the public by Ion Iliescu in radio and TV addresses on 22 December 1989, after the overthrow of Ceaușescu in the Romanian Revolution. The FSN proclaimed itself the supreme power within Romania. Within four days, the FSN formed an interim government with Ion Iliescu being the president and Petre Roman as the interim Prime Minister. The initial membership of FSN came from diverse backgrounds: intellectuals, students, army officers, but the leaders were mostly former Communist officials (see List of members of the National Salvation Front Council). People flocked to the National Salvation Front (FSN) for a multitude of reasons ranging from religious oppression in members such as László Tőkés and alleged mismanagement and marginalization of undesirables within the Communist party in members such as Ion Iliescu.

In the following years, the naming identity between the power body created in December 1989 and the group signing the November 1989 leaflets led some to question whether the National Salvation Front (FSN) existed as an underground organization. According to Silviu Brucan, this was not the case, as the letters were written by Alexandru Melian, a professor at the University of Bucharest, who had no connection to the leaders of the NSF. This was contradicted by Nicolae Militaru, who claimed that he, together with Ion Iliescu, led a clandestine National Salvation Front which asked Melian to write this appeal.

===Interim government===
On 27 December, the FSN decreed the abolition of the one-party system and called for free elections. Shortly afterwards, two major political parties claiming to be the successors of the two most important pre-Communist Romanian parties, more specifically the National Peasants&#x27; Party (PNŢ) and the National Liberal Party (PNL), were founded and registered.

At first, the FSN announced that it would not be nominating candidates in the forthcoming elections. However, Silviu Brucan then launched the concept of &quot;the big party&quot; and supported the transformation of the FSN into a political party. Some members of FSN, like Dumitru Mazilu, Mircea Dinescu, Ion Caramitru, Andrei Pleșu, Dan Hăulică, Gabriel Liiceanu, or Doina Cornea resigned before FSN became a political party.

On 6 February 1990, the FSN, transformed itself into a political party, in order to be able to run in the upcoming elections. Except for a few newspapers, FSN had extensive control over the Romanian mass-media, particularly the state owned television company and the newly founded &quot;Adevărul&quot; newspaper.

Anti-FSN demonstrations were mounted by the Christian Democratic National Peasants&#x27; Party (PNȚ-CD) and the National Liberal Party (PNL) in late January and late February 1990, that degenerated into violence against state authorities. In turn, Iliescu called on the working class to support the FSN against what he noted as &quot;fascist forces, trying to destabilise the country&quot;. This has resulted in what were named the first and second Mineriads.

FSN agreed to allow other parties to participate in the provisional government. The new governing body, the Provisional Council of National Unity (, CPUN), still dominated by FSN, would run the country from early February 1990 until the elections.

Another, much larger, demonstration (the Golaniad) against FSN&#x27;s participation in the elections was organised in April 1990 and lasted 52 days, until 13–15 June, when it was violently dispersed by the third Mineriad.

===First elected government===
The FSN had strong support among the peasants and the urban industrial workers, while the PNL and PNŢCD had strong support among the intellectuals in urban areas.

As popular anger was directly primarily at the Ceaușescu family, the FSN benefited from the institutional links of the disbanded Communist Party and needed no specific program in order to win the elections, being a catch-all party.

FSN and its candidate Ion Iliescu comfortably won the legislative and presidential elections on 20 May 1990, obtaining a majority in both the Assembly of Deputies and the Senate. Petre Roman remained Prime Minister, and its government started cautious economic reforms.

===Breakup===

After growing tensions between Iliescu and Roman, on 7 April 1992, Iliescu and many other members left the FSN and created the Democratic National Salvation Front (, FDSN), which eventually developed to be the current Social Democratic Party (, PSD).

Petre Roman remained leader of the FSN. On 28 May 1993, the party was renamed Democratic Party – National Salvation Front (, PD-FSN), before shortening its name to Democratic Party (PD) in 1998.

==Legacy==
The National Salvation Front (FSN) has had a major impact on post-1989 Romanian politics. The two parties that emerged from the National Salvation Front (FSN), more specifically the Social Democratic Party (PSD) and the Democratic Liberal Party (PDL), the latter which ultimately merged into the National Liberal Party (PNL) in 2014, governed or participated in government coalitions from 1990 until today.

The former President Traian Băsescu entered politics as an FSN member and served as Minister of Transportation in several FSN governments. Băsescu, stemming as a presidential candidate from the Democratic Party (PD), as part of the Justice and Truth Alliance (DA), remarked rhetorically in a live TV debate with Adrian Năstase, stemming from the Social Democratic Party (PSD), before the 2004 run-off presidential election: &quot;You know what Romania&#x27;s greatest curse is right now? It&#x27;s that Romanians have to choose between two former Communist Party (PCR) members.&quot;

<text>Virchow is a small lunar impact crater that is located on the northwestern interior floor of the prominent crater Neper. The latter formation lies near the eastern limb of the Moon, along the southern edge of the Mare Marginis. Observation of this area is hindered due to foreshortening, as well as libration effects. It was named after German physician Rudolf Virchow in 1979. Before, this crater had the designation Neper G.

Virchow has a distorted shape, with a somewhat polygonal rim, particularly in the northern half. The northwestern rim protrudes outwards, giving the crater an asymmetrical appearance. This section of the rim just makes contact with the inner wall of Neper crater. The inner walls of Virchow are relatively narrow, and the interior floor is nearly level and almost featureless.

<text>Christian Aid is a relief and development charity of 41 Christian (Protestant and Orthodox) churches in Great Britain and Ireland, and works to support sustainable development, eradicate poverty, support civil society and provide disaster relief in South America, the Caribbean, Africa and Asia.

It works with hundreds of local partner organisations in some of the world&#x27;s most vulnerable communities in 24 countries. It is a founder member of the Disasters Emergency Committee, and a major member of The Climate Coalition, The Fairtrade Foundation and Trade Justice Movement campaigns. Christian Aid&#x27;s headquarters are in London and it has regional teams across the UK and Ireland, plus country offices elsewhere around the world. Christian Aid also organises the UK&#x27;s largest door-to-door collection, Christian Aid Week, which takes place in May each year.

Its director was Loretta Minghella who was appointed in 2010 but resigned in 2017 to work for the Church Commissioners. Amanda Khozi Mukwashi was Chief Executive in from 2018–2021. She was succeeded by the current Chief Executive Patrick Watt. The 2012–2013 income of Christian Aid was £95.4 million.

Reconstruction after various wars in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia were major projects, alongside the aid given after the overthrow of dictators Idi Amin in Uganda, Somoza family in Nicaragua, and Pol Pot in Cambodia. Yanomami Indians in Brazil were also supported, in a commitment to marginalized peoples.

==Fundraising==

Christian Aid raises income from a wide number of sources, such as institutional grants, regular gifts, the Christian Aid Week appeal, general donations, legacies, and emergency appeals. In 2013, the institutional income, part of which comes from the Department for International Development and the European Commission, constituted 41% of the total income. A significant percentage of the remaining income comes from thousands of individuals in churches and communities. The main fundraising moments include Christmas, Harvest, and Christian Aid Week. In 2013, £12.6 million (or 13% of the total income) was raised during this week. Throughout the year supporters give regularly using direct debit, cash donations, and Will Aid. Churches and community groups also take part in the annual calendar of events (e.g., walks, soup lunches, and quizzes).

==Criticism==
The development economist Paul Collier in his book &quot;The Bottom Billion&quot; suggests that Christian Aid &quot;deeply misinformed&quot; the UK electorate in 2004 and 2005 with a campaign against reducing trade barriers in Africa. He says the campaign was based on a &quot;deeply misleading&quot; study conducted by an economist without the requisite expertise and whose purported review &quot;by a panel of academic experts&quot; was by two people whom the economist had himself chosen and who were also &quot;not noted for their expertise on international trade&quot;. He quotes an unnamed official at the British Department of Trade and Industry as saying &quot;they know it&#x27;s bad, but it sells the T-shirts&quot;.

Several of the Britain&#x27;s leading foreign aid charities, including Christian Aid, British Red Cross, Save the Children, and Oxfam, have been criticized for paying what some alleged to be excessive salaries to some of their managers. In 2013, Christian Aid&#x27;s CEO was paid £126,206 and four other staff members were paid between £80,000 and £90,000. Christian Aid&#x27;s response to this was: &quot;We want to reassure you that we make every effort to avoid paying higher salaries than are necessary. We pay our staff salaries the same as, or below, the median of other church-based and/or international development agencies.&quot;

==Legal action by Zionist Advocacy Center==
In March 2023 Christian Aid commented on a legal action taken against the organisation by the Zionist Advocacy Center. The legal action was commenced in 2017. The legal action alleged that Christian Aid was &quot;virulently anti-Israel&quot; and had fraudulently obtained funding from the US government. Patrick Watt, the chief executive for Christian Aid, said: &quot;I don’t believe … this case was brought against us in the belief that it had legs. I think it was brought against us in an effort to throw sand in the wheels of our advocacy and to make working on IOPT [Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory] very expensive.&quot; The case was dismissed in a US court in June 2021 &quot;for lack of personal jurisdiction,&quot; without reaching the merits of the case. Christian Aid said it was an act of &quot;lawfare&quot; against organizations that help Palestinians, while the director of the plaintiff said “Only when it appears to me that organisations have crossed the line into actionable conduct do I start legal proceedings. Moreover, on two occasions so far [including against Norwegian People’s Aid], the United States government has agreed with me, resulting in millions of dollars in recoveries.&quot;

<doc id="1295795" wikidata="Q649191" url="?curid=1295795" title="Volta (crater)">
<text>Volta is a lunar impact crater near the northwest limb of the Moon. It is located south-southeast of the crater Xenophanes, and due north of the smaller Galvani. The crater Regnault lies across the western rim of Volta. Attached to the southwest rim of Volta and the southern rim of Regnault is Stokes. The worn Langley is lying between Volta and Stokes in the north and Galvani in the south.

The outer rim of Volta is heavily worn and irregular, with small craters overlying the rim crest, a chain of craters along the east, and Regnault along the west rim. Even the northern rim is irregular, with a gouging valley extending through the north-northeast rim towards Xenophanes. In contrast the interior floor is relatively level and flat, other than some fractures. Volta B is in the northeast interior, and Volta D is on the southeast rim.

It was named by the IAU in 1964 after Alessandro Volta, an Italian physicist.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Volta.

<doc id="1295796" wikidata="Q129385" url="?curid=1295796" title="Comb Ceramic culture">
<text>The Comb Ceramic culture or Pit-Comb Ware culture, often abbreviated as CCC or PCW, was a northeast European culture characterised by its Pit–Comb Ware. It existed from around 4200 BCE to around 2000 BCE. The bearers of the Comb Ceramic culture are thought to have still mostly followed the Mesolithic hunter-gatherer (Eastern Hunter-Gatherer) lifestyle, with traces of early agriculture.

==Distribution==
The distribution of the artifacts found includes Finnmark (Norway) in the north, the Kalix River (Sweden) and the Gulf of Bothnia (Finland) in the west and the Vistula River (Poland) in the south. It would include the Narva culture of Estonia and the Sperrings culture in Finland, among others. They are thought to have been essentially hunter-gatherers, though e.g. the Narva culture in Estonia shows some evidence of agriculture. Some of this region was absorbed by the later Corded Ware horizon.

==Ceramics==

The Pit–Comb Ware culture is one of the few exceptions to the rule that pottery and farming coexist in Europe. In the Near East farming appeared before pottery, then when farming spread into Europe from the Near East, pottery-making came with it. However, in Asia, where the oldest pottery has been found, pottery was made long before farming. It appears that the Comb Ceramic Culture reflects influences from Siberia and distant China.

The ceramics consist of large pots that are rounded or pointed below, with a capacity from 40 to 60 litres. The forms of the vessels remained unchanged but the decoration varied.

By dating according to the elevation of land, the ceramics have traditionally (Äyräpää 1930) been divided into the following periods: &quot;early&quot; (Ka I, c. 4200 BC – 3300 BC), &quot;typical&quot; (Ka II, c. 3300 BC – 2700 BC) and &quot;late Comb Ceramic&quot; (Ka III, c. 2800 BC – 2000 BC).

However, calibrated radiocarbon dates for the comb-ware fragments found (e.g., in the Karelian isthmus), give a total interval of 5600 BC – 2300 BC (&quot;Geochronometria&quot; Vol. 23, pp 93–99, 2004).

Among the many styles of comb ware there is one which makes use of the characteristics of asbestos: Asbestos ware. In this tradition, which persisted through different cultures into the Iron Age, asbestos was used to temper the ceramic clay. Other styles are Pyheensilta, Jäkärlä, Kierikki, Pöljä and Säräisniemi pottery with their respective subdivisions. Sperrings ceramics is the original name given for the &quot;younger early Comb ware&quot; (Ka I:2) found in Finland.

==Habitations==
The settlements were located at sea shores or beside lakes and the economy was based on hunting, fishing and the gathering of plants. In Finland, it was a maritime culture which became more and more specialized in hunting seals. The dominant dwelling was probably a teepee of about 30 square meters where some 15 people could live. Also rectangular houses made of timber become popular in Finland from 4000 BC cal. Graves were dug at the settlements and the dead were covered with red ochre. The typical Comb Ceramic age shows an extensive use of objects made of flint and amber as grave offerings.

==Tools==
The stone tools changed very little over time. They were made of local materials such as slate and quartz. Finds suggest a fairly extensive exchange network: red slate originating from northern Scandinavia, asbestos from Lake Saimaa, green slate from Lake Onega, amber from the southern shores of the Baltic Sea and flint from the Valdai area in northwestern Russia.

==Art==
The culture was characterised by small figurines of burnt clay and animal heads made of stone. The animal heads usually depict moose and bears and were derived from the art of the Mesolithic. There were also many rock paintings.

There are sources noting that the typical comb ceramic pottery had a sense of luxury and that its makers knew how to wear precious amber pendants.

==Language==
In earlier times, it was often suggested that the spread of the Comb Ware people was correlated with the diffusion of the Uralic languages, and thus an early Uralic language would have been spoken throughout this culture. It was also suggested that bearers of this culture likely spoke Finno-Ugric languages. Another view is that the Comb Ware people may have spoken Palaeo-European languages, as some toponyms and hydronyms also indicate a non-Uralic, non-Indo-European language at work in some areas. In addition, modern scholars have located the Proto-Uralic homeland east of the Volga, if not even beyond the Urals. The great westward dispersal of the Uralic languages is suggested to have happened long after the demise of the Comb Ceramic culture, perhaps in the 1st millennium BC.

==Genetics==
Saag et al. (2017) analyzed three CCC individuals buried at Kudruküla as belonging to Y-hg R1a5-YP1272 (R1a1b~ after ISOGG 2020), along with three mtDNA samples of mt-hg U5b1d1, U4a and U2e1.

Mittnik (2018) analyzed two CCC individuals. The male carried R1 (2021: R1b-M343) and U4d2, while the female carried U5a1d2b. Generally, the CCC individuals were mostly of Eastern Hunter-Gatherer (EHG) descent, with even more EHG than people of the Narva culture.

Lamnidis et al. (2018) found 15% Western Hunter-Gatherer (WHG) ancestry, 65% Eastern Hunter-Gatherer (EHG) - higher than among earlier cultures of the eastern Baltic, and 20% Western Steppe Herder (WSH).

<text>The Zaporozhian Sich (, , ; also ) was a semi-autonomous polity and proto-state of Cossacks that existed between the 16th to 18th centuries, including as an autonomous stratocratic state within the Cossack Hetmanate for over a hundred years, centred around the Great Meadow region of modern day Ukraine, spanning the lower Dnieper river. In different periods the area came under the sovereignty of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Ottoman Empire, the Tsardom of Russia, and the Russian Empire.

In 1775, shortly after Russia annexed the territories ceded to it by the Ottoman Empire under the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca (1774), Catherine the Great disbanded the Sich. She incorporated its territory into the Russian province of Novorossiya.

The term &quot;Zaporozhian Sich&quot; can also refer metonymically and informally to the whole military-administrative organisation of the Zaporozhian Cossack host.

== Name ==
The name &quot;Zaporizhzhia&quot; refers to the military and political organization of the Cossacks and to the location of their autonomous territory &#x27;beyond the rapids&#x27; (&quot;&quot;) of the Dnieper River. The Dnieper rapids were a major portage on the north–south Dnieper trade route. The term &quot;sich&quot; is a noun related to the East Slavic verb &quot;sich&quot; (), meaning &#x27;to chop&#x27; or &#x27;cut&#x27;; it may have been associated with the usual wood sharp-spiked stockades around Cossack settlements.

Zaporizhzhia was located in the region around the Great Meadow (&quot;Velykyi Luh&quot;) in today&#x27;s south-eastern Ukraine, which was flooded by the Kakhovka Reservoir from the construction of the Kakhovka Dam in 1956 until its destruction in 2023. The area was also known under the historical term &quot;Wild Fields&quot;.

== History ==
A possible precursor of the Zaporozhian Sich was a fortification (&quot;sich&quot;) built on the Tomakivka island () in the middle of the Dnieper River in the present-day Zaporizhzhia region of Ukraine. However, there is no direct evidence about the exact time of the existence of Tomakivka Sich, whereas indirect data suggest that at the time of Tomakivka Sich there was no Zaporozhian Sich yet.

The history of Zaporozhian Sich spans six time-periods:

* the emergence of the Sich (construction of ) (1471–1583)
* as part of the Lesser Poland Province of the Polish Crown by inclusion in the Kiev Voivodeship (1583–1657)
* the struggle against the Rzeczpospolita (the Polish-Lithuanian state), the Ottoman Empire, and the Crimea Khanate for the independence of the Ukrainian part of the Rzeczpospolita (Commonwealth) (1657–1686)
* the struggle with Crimea, the Ottoman Empire, and the Russian Empire for the unique identity of Cossacks (1686–1709)
* the standoff with the Russian government during its attempts to cancel the self-governing of the Sich, and its fall (1734–1775)
* the formation of the Danubian Sich outside the Russian Empire and finding ways to return home (1775–1828)

=== Formation ===
The Zaporozhian Sich emerged as a method of defence by Slavic colonists against the frequent and devastating raids of Crimean Tatars, who captured and enslaved hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians, Belarusians and Poles to supply the Crimean slave trade in operations called &quot;the harvesting of the steppe&quot;. The Ukrainians created a self-defence force, the Cossacks, fierce enough to stop the Tatar hordes, and built fortified camps (&quot;sichi&quot;) that were later united to form a central fortress, the Zaporozhian Sich.

Prince Dmytro Vyshnevetsky established the first Zaporozhian Sich on the island of Small (Mala) Khortytsia in 1552, building a fortress at &quot;Niz Dnieprovsky&quot; (Lower Dnieper) and placing a Cossack garrison there; Tatar forces destroyed the fortress in 1558. The Tomakivka Sich was built on a now-inundated island to the south, near the modern city of Marhanets; Tatars also razed that sich, in 1593. A third sich soon followed, on Bazavluk island, which survived until 1638, when it was destroyed by a Polish expeditionary force suppressing a Cossack uprising. These settlements, founded during the 16th century, were already complex enough to constitute an early proto-state.

=== Struggle for independence ===

The Zaporozhian Cossacks became included in the Kiev Voivodeship from 1583 to 1657, part of the Lesser Poland Province of the Polish Crown. They resented Polish rule, however, one of the reasons being religious differences, as the cossacks were Orthodox Christians whereas the Poles were mostly Catholics. They thus engaged in a long struggle for independence from surrounding powers, the Rzeczpospolita (Polish state), the Ottoman Empire, the Crimean Khanate, and the Tsardom of Russia and Russian Empire. The Sich became the centre of Cossack life, governed by the &quot;Sich Rada&quot; alongside its Kish otaman (sometimes called Hetman, from German &quot;Hauptmann&quot;).

In 1648, Bohdan Khmelnytsky captured a sich at Mykytyn Rih, near the present-day city of Nikopol. From there he began an uprising against the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth that led to the establishment of the Cossack Hetmanate (1648–1764). After the Treaty of Pereyaslav in 1654, the Zaporozhian Host was split into the Hetmanate, with its capital at Chyhyryn, and the more autonomous region of Zaporizhzhia, which continued to be centred on the Sich. During this period the Sich changed location several times but was generally located in the Great Meadow. The Chortomlyk Sich was built at the mouth of the Chortomlyk River in 1652. In 1667 the Truce of Andrusovo made the Sich a condominium ruled jointly by Russia and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

During the reign of Peter the Great, Cossacks were used for the construction of canals and fortification lines in northern Russia. An estimated 20–30 thousands were sent each year. Hard labour led to a high mortality rate among builders, and only an estimated 40% of Cossacks returned home.

After the Battle of Poltava in 1709, the Chortomlyk Sich (sometimes referred to as the &quot;Old Sich&quot; (&quot;Stara Sich&quot;)) was destroyed and Baturyn, the capital of Hetman Ivan Mazepa, was razed. Another sich was built at the mouth of the Kamianets river but was destroyed in 1711 by the Russian government. The Cossacks then fled to the Crimean Khanate to avoid persecution and founded the Oleshky Sich in 1711 (today the city of Oleshky). In 1734, they were allowed to return to the Russian Empire. Suffering from discrimination in the Khanate, Cossacks accepted the offer to return and built another Sich in close proximity to the former Chortomlyk Sich, referred to as the Nova Sich. The population in steppe region numbered around 52,000 in the year 1768.

Fear of the independence of the Sich resulted in the Russian administration abolishing the Hetmanate in 1764. The Cossack officer class was incorporated into the Imperial Russian nobility (Dvoryanstvo). The rank and file Cossacks, however, including a substantial portion of the old Zaporozhians, were reduced to peasant status. Tension rose after the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca, when the need for a southern frontier ended after the annexation of the Crimea. The colonisation of Novorossiya (New Russia) with Serbian and Romanians sponsored by Russia created further conflict. After the end of the war between Russia and the Ottoman Empire for possession of the Black Sea and Crimean steppes, Russia no longer needed the Zaporozhian Cossacks for protection of the border region. Russia finally destroyed the Zaporozhian Sich through military force in 1775.

=== Destruction and aftermath ===

In May 1775, Russian General Peter Tekeli received orders to occupy and destroy the Zaporozhian Sich from Grigory Potemkin, who had been formally admitted into Cossackdom a few years earlier. Potemkin was given direct orders from Catherine the Great. On 5 June 1775, Tekeli surrounded the Sich with artillery and infantry. He postponed the assault and even allowed visits while the head of the Host, Petro Kalnyshevsky, was deciding how to react to the Russian ultimatum. The Zaporozhians decided to surrender. The Sich was officially disbanded by the 3 August 1775 manifesto of Catherine, &quot;On the Liquidation of Zaporozhian Sich and Annexation thereof to Novorossiya Governorate&quot;, and the Sich was razed to the ground.

Some of the Cossack officer class, the &quot;starshyna&quot;, became hereditary Russian nobility and obtained huge lands in spite of their previous attempts to relocate the Sich to either North America or Australia. Under the guidance of a &quot;starshyna&quot; named Lyakh, a conspiracy was formed among a group of 50 Cossacks to pretend to go fishing on the river Inhul next to the Southern Buh in the Ottoman provinces, and to obtain 50 passports for the expedition. The pretext was enough to allow about 5,000 Zaporozhians to flee, some travelling to the Danube Delta where they formed a new Danube Sich, as a protectorate of the Ottoman Empire. Others moved to Hungary to form a Sich there as a protectorate of the Austrian Empire. According to folklore, some moved to Malta, because Kosh otamans and other senior members of the starshyna considered themselves a kind of Maltese chivalry.

The leader of the Zaporozhian Host, Petro Kalnyshevsky, was arrested and exiled to the Solovetsky Islands (where he lived to the age of 112 in the Solovetsky Monastery). Four high level &quot;starshynas&quot; were repressed and exiled, later dying in Siberian monasteries. Lower level &quot;starshynas&quot; who remained and went over to the Russian side were given army ranks and all the privileges that accompanied them, and allowed to join Hussar and Dragoon regiments. Most of the ordinary Cossacks were made peasants and even serfs.

In 1780, after disbanding the Zaporozhian Cossack Host, General Grigorii Potemkin attempted to gather and reorganize the Cossacks on a voluntary basis, and they helped to defend Ukraine from the Turks during the Russo-Turkish War (1787–1792). He was able to gather almost 12,000 Cossacks and called them the Black Sea Cossacks. After the conflict was over, rather than allowing the Cossacks to settle across Southern Ukraine, the Russian government began to resettle them on the Kuban River. In 1860, they changed their name to the Kuban Cossacks.

Ukrainian writer Adrian Kaschenko (1858–1921) and historian Olena Apanovich note that the abolition of the Zaporozhian Sich had a strong symbolic effect, and memories of the event remained for a long time in local folklore.

== Organization and government ==
 
The Zaporozhian Host was led by the Sich Rada that elected a Kish otaman as the host&#x27;s leader. He was aided by a head secretary (&quot;pysar&quot;), head judge, and head archivist. During military operations the Otaman carried unlimited power supported by his staff as the military collegiate. He decided with an agreement from the Rada whether to support a certain Hetman (such as Bohdan Khmelnytsky) or other leaders of state.

Some sources refer to the Zaporozhian Sich as a &quot;Cossack republic&quot;, because the highest power in it belonged to the assembly of all its members, and its leaders (&quot;starshyna&quot;) were elected. The Cossacks formed a society (hromada) that consisted of &quot;kurins&quot; (each with several hundred Cossacks). A Cossack military court severely punished violence and stealing among compatriots, the bringing of women to the Sich, the consumption of alcohol in periods of conflict, and other offenses. The administration of the Sich provided Orthodox churches and schools for the religious and secular education of children.

The population of the Sich had a cosmopolitan component, including Ukrainians, Moldavians, Tatars, Poles, Lithuanians, Jews, Russians and many other ethnicities. The social structure was complex, consisting of destitute gentry and boyars, &quot;szlachta&quot; (Polish nobility), merchants, peasants, outlaws of every sort, runaway slaves from Turkish galleys, and runaway serfs (as the Zaporozhian polkovnyk Pivtorakozhukha). Some of those who were not accepted to the host formed gangs of their own, and also claimed to be Cossacks. However, after the Khmelnytsky Uprising these formations largely disappeared and were integrated mainly into Hetmanate society.

=== Army and warfare ===
The Cossacks developed a large fleet of fast, light vessels. Their campaigns were targeted at rich settlements on the Black Sea shores of the Ottoman Empire, and several times took them as far as Constantinople and Trabzon (formerly Trebizond).

<text>Beaudry () is a Montreal Metro station in the borough of Ville-Marie, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) and serves the Green Line. It is in Montreal&#x27;s Gay Village, part of the Centre-Sud district. Although part of the original network of the Metro, it opened two months after the rest of the network, on December 21, 1966.

== Overview ==


Designed by Adalbert Niklewicz, it is a normal side platform station, built in-tunnel; a transept leads to a long inclined moving sidewalk, the only one of its kind in the Metro, traversing the distance between De Maisonneuve Boulevard and Saint Catherine Street, on which the entrance is located. The moving sidewalk has been a burden to the STM because it is unique and so replacement parts must be custom-built.

The walls in the entrance building, ticket hall, passage to the platforms, and transept area were updated in a stylish light slate blue and stainless steel scheme. The platform is covered in a cream-and-brown tile pattern, but in 1999, part of the walls near the exits were redone during renovations into a pattern of blue tiles and stainless steel.

==Renovations==

In October 2018, the station was temporarily closed for renovations for 8 months, as part of a significant renovation that would take 18 months to complete fully. Unlike at Honoré-Beaugrand and the adjacent Berri-UQAM, which remained partly or wholly open during their recent renovations, &quot;a complete closure was necessary&quot; for the renovations to take place, according to STM spokesperson Amélie Régis, as the station only had a sole entrance. Beaudry&#x27;s closure was the first time that a metro station closed completely for renovations since Beaubien station closed for four months in the spring of 2015. Shuttle buses were provided during the closure to facilitate transport between the station and its two neighbouring stations, Berri-UQAM and Papineau.

The station reopened, as scheduled, on June 3, 2019. Since then, work has been continued to replace the wall on the platform. The renovation has been completed in 2020.

== Architecture and art ==

The station was renovated and partially redecorated in the Réno-Métro program in 1999. Part of this work included a large new glassed-in entrance building by Béïque, Thuot, and Legault; a unique part of its design are rainbow-coloured masts over the door, an homage to Montreal&#x27;s large gay and lesbian neighbourhood, the Village (&quot;Village gai&quot;), which the station serves. These were created by Jacques Thibault.

==Origin of the name==
The station is named for Beaudry Street. Pierre Beaudry (1774–1848) was the landowner across whose farm the street was opened; he also donated the land on which the Saint-Pierre-Apôtre Church was built.

Liss received his BA degree from Syracuse University, an MA from Georgia State University and his M. Phil from Columbia University. He left his post-graduate studies of 18th Century British literature and unfinished dissertation to write full-time. &quot;If things had not worked out with fiction, I probably would have kept to my graduate school career track and sought a job as a literature professor,&quot; he said. A full-time writer since 2010, Liss lives in San Antonio, Texas, with his wife and children.

Most of Liss&#x27; novels are historical-mystery (or historical-thriller) novels. Settings include 18th-century London and America and 17th-century Amsterdam. One novel, &quot;The Ethical Assassin&quot;, is a modern mystery-thriller. His first book, &quot;A Conspiracy of Paper&quot; (2000), won the 2001 Edgar Award for Best First Novel.

<text>Wilhelm is a lunar impact crater in the southern part of the Moon, to the west of the prominent Tycho. Portions of the ray material from Tycho lie across the rim and floor of Wilhelm. Attached to its southern rim is the crater Montanari, while Lagalla is attached to the southwest. To the north-northeast is Heinsius.

This crater is of the type traditionally termed a walled plain. It has a heavily eroded outer rim that is overlain by several smaller craters. Among these are Wilhelm A and Wilhelm K across the southwest rim, and Wilhelm B just to the northwest along the western rim. Wilhelm C intrudes into the north-northeast rim, and Wilhelm D is attached to the northeast outer rim. There is an outward protrusion in the southern rim that extends to contact Montanari.

The interior floor of Wilhelm is relatively level, with a rougher area to the northeast. The remainder is flat and almost featureless except for a few tiny craterlets.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Wilhelm.

<doc id="1295828" wikidata="Q6517486" url="?curid=1295828" title="Legal dispute over Quebec's language policy">
<text>The legal dispute over Quebec&#x27;s language policy began soon after the enactment of Bill 101, establishing the Charter of the French Language, by the Parliament of Quebec in 1977.

The Charter, enacted under the Parti Québécois government of René Lévesque, expanded upon Quebec&#x27;s previous language legislation, Bill 22, also known as the Official Language Act, enacted in 1974 under the Liberal Party of Quebec government of Robert Bourassa. Earlier language legislation in Quebec had included An Act to promote the French language in Quebec in 1969, and the La Vergne Law of 1910.

Both statutes were drafted in an attempt to follow the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry on the Situation of the French Language and Linguistic Rights in Quebec (the Gendron Commission).

Unlike the (Quebec) Official Language Act of 1974 (not to be confused with the federal Official Languages Act), the Charter of the French Language is a legal framework defining the linguistic rights of Quebecers, and a language management policy giving the Government of Quebec the power to intervene in many sectors of public life to promote French as the common language of all citizens. Its enactment sparked a legal battle that still goes on today.

==Before 1982==

In 1867, the British Parliament passed the &quot;British North America Act, 1867&quot;, now known as the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;, which became the supreme law of the Dominion of Canada (although it was modified several times, it is still part of the Constitution of Canada). This act contains only one section (section 133) dealing with language. It reads:

&quot;Either the English or the French Language may be used by any Person in the Debates of the Houses of the Parliament of Canada and of the Houses of the Legislature of Quebec; and both those Languages shall be used in the respective Records and Journals of those Houses; and either of those Languages may be used by any Person or in any Pleading or Process in or issuing from any Court of Canada established under this Act, and in or from all or any of the Courts of Quebec.&quot;

&quot;The Acts of the Parliament of Canada and of the Legislature of Quebec shall be printed and published in both those Languages.&quot;

===Language of legislation and justice===

Three Quebec Lawyers, Peter Blaikie, Roland Durand and Yoine Goldstein first challenged the constitutionality of the &quot;Charter of the French Language&quot; under section 133.

In 1979, the Supreme Court of Canada declared Chapter III of the &quot;Charter of the French Language&quot; unconstitutional, citing it contrary to section 133 of the British North America Act of 1867. The highest court in Canada judged that the enacting and passing of laws had to be done in both French and English in the parliaments of Quebec and Canada.

Sections 7 to 13 of the &quot;Charter of the French Language&quot; had made French the only language of legislation and only provided for a translation of laws in English at the end of the legislative process.

The Quebec government responded by re-enacting the charter (and all other acts enacted since 1977) in French and English. Sections 7 to 13 of the charter were however left untouched.

In 1981, another Supreme Court decision (&quot;Quebec (Attorney General) v. Blaikie (No. 2)&quot;) declared that section 133 also applied to government regulations.

==After 1982==

The patriation of the Canadian Constitution occurred as the British Parliament passed the Canada Act 1982. This act enacted the Constitution Act, 1982 for Canada (including the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms), which has two provisions which have provided the basis for further constitutional disputes concerning Quebec&#x27;s Charter of the French Language. Section 2 of the Charter guarantees freedom of expression, which opens the door to challenges to laws which restrict an individual&#x27;s ability to use a particular language, while section 23 introduced the notion of &quot;minority language education rights&quot;.

Alliance Quebec, an Anglophone rights lobby group was founded in May 1982. It is through this civil association that various anglophone lawyers challenged the constitutionality of Quebec&#x27;s territorial language policy.

===Language of instruction===

==== Quebec (A.G.) v. Quebec Protestant School Boards ====

In 1984, the Supreme Court invalidated Chapter VIII of the Quebec Charter of the French Language on the basis of its incompatibility with section 23 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Section 23 of the Canadian Charter reads:
(1) Citizens of Canada

(a) whose first language learned and still understood is that of the English or French linguistic minority population of the province in which they reside, or

(b) who have received their primary school instruction in Canada in English or French and reside in a province where the language in which they received that instruction is the language of the English or French linguistic minority population of the province, 

have the right to have their children receive primary and secondary school instruction in that language in that province.
Section 73 of the Charter of the French language had recognized the right to English language instruction to Quebec residents alone. Canadian citizens from outside Quebec are forced to send their children to French primary and secondary schools, in direct violation of S26.(3) of the UN Declaration of Human Rights, which states that &quot;&quot;Parents have a prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children.

On July 26, 1984, the Supreme Court invalidated part of Section 73. Judged retroactively unconstitutional, the section had to be modified so that it no longer clashes with the Canadian charter&#x27;s definition of a linguistic minority. The current Section 73 of the Charter of the French language reads:
The following children, at the request of one of their parents, may receive instruction in English:

1) a child whose father or mother is a Canadian citizen and received elementary instruction in English in Canada, provided that that instruction constitutes the major part of the elementary instruction he or she received in Canada;

2) a child whose father or mother is a Canadian citizen and who has received or is receiving elementary or secondary instruction in English in Canada, and the brothers and sisters of that child, provided that that instruction constitutes the major part of the elementary or secondary instruction received by the child in Canada;

3) a child whose father and mother are not Canadian citizens, but whose father or mother received elementary instruction in English in Québec, provided that that instruction constitutes the major part of the elementary instruction he or she received in Québec;

4) a child who, in their last year in school in Québec before 26 August 1977, was receiving instruction in English in a public kindergarten class or in an elementary or secondary school, and the brothers and sisters of that child;

5) a child whose father or mother was residing in Québec on 26 August 1977 and had received elementary instruction in English outside Québec, provided that that instruction constitutes the major part of the elementary instruction he or she received outside Québec.
In 2005, a Supreme Court ruling upheld Section 73 of the Charter of the French language and its corresponding subsections (1 through 5). See Maclean&#x27;s 5 April 2005, an article by John Geddes entitled &quot;Tweaking the Language Laws&quot;. It maintains that the court upheld S.73 yet provided for flexibility in matters dealing with English-speaking Canadians and immigrants from other countries.

==== Bill 104 ====
In August 2007, the Quebec Court of Appeal ruled that a section of the province&#x27;s language legislation is unlawful. The judgment stated that Bill 104, an amendment to the Charter passed in 2002 that stopped children of francophone and newcomers from using the English educational system, was contrary to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The amendment was passed to thwart entry to English schools by pupils who had gone to at least one year of an unsubsidized private institution. It had been passed unanimously (by all parties) in the provincial legislature.

The Appeal Court verdict disallowed a segment of Bill 104, suggesting that students can be present English public establishments if they have been at an English private academy for a minimum of one year or have been permitted a special dispensation. The Quebec government immediately announced it would appeal the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada, which it did.

A judgment was given that delayed use of that conclusion until the Supreme Court of Canada judged on a provincial administration request.

The challenge to Bill 104 continued but with funding from the English school boards affected, as the federal Court Challenges Program established for such minority language rights was cut by the Conservative minority government. There was a precedent for having the government pay the fees of the challenging side, or appointing an .

A representative of the Quebec Association of Independent Schools proclaimed its goal to and Brent Tyler, the advocate for the 26 families in the case, said he would pull together an appeal.

The Quebec English School Board Association (QESBA) suspected the volume of probable English-system learners who might be affected by this result to be 500 annually, the majority of whom would enroll in Montreal schools. It said such a loss to the French school enrollment of almost 1 million would be unimportant. It asked that the decision be respected until it can be referred to the Supreme Court.

About half of all enrollment decline in the English Montreal School Board since 2002 has resulted from Bill 104, a low fertility rate and urban sprawl being other reasons, said a spokesman in 2007.

A coalition of groups for defending French supported the Quebec government in its venture to overturn the Quebec Appeal Court ruling. Former CSN leader Gérald Larose, chairman of the Conseil de la souveraineté, commented negatively on this &quot;undermining&quot; of the Charter of the French Language by an &quot;English judge&quot; (the decision was handed down by the Quebec Court of Appeals, which is not an English body). Larose was also the Parti Québécois–appointed president of a commission on the future of the French language and advocated that Quebec be granted unshared supremacy over language legislation, despite the Canadian constitution which divides such power between the national and provincial governments. Jean Dorion, president of the , said that Appeals Court judges are appointed by the national government and said that they should not have the power to overrule Quebec&#x27;s language laws. Other commentators remonstrated that Justice Hilton had previously served as legal counsel for Alliance Quebec, an anglophone rights group. &quot;Le Devoir&quot; reported, however, that the Quebec department of justice did not ask Hilton to recuse himself from the case. Through a spokesperson, the Ministry of Justice said that such a recusal was not necessary and that the government trusted the Court of Appeal to be fair.
Parti Québécois leader Pauline Marois suggested in 2007 that the ruling could be &quot;catastrophic&quot; and described it as unsatisfactory. Over the 30-year life of Bill 101 &quot;about 4,000 children have used this to get into the English network,&quot; she said, as opposed to the French network.

===Language of commercial signs===

==== Ford v. Quebec (Attorney General) ====

In 1988, the Supreme Court ruled that the sections of the Charter of the French Language enforcing the exclusive use of French on outdoor commercial signs were unconstitutional. The Court-based this decision on the guarantee of freedom of expression in s. 2 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

The Supreme Court remarked that the Quebec government could legitimately require French to have &quot;greater visibility&quot; or &quot;marked predominance&quot; on exterior commercial signs, however it could not enforce the exclusive use of French.

With the &quot;Act to amend the Charter of the French language&quot;, S.Q. 1988, c. 54 (also known as &quot;Bill 178&quot;), the National Assembly (under a Quebec Liberal government) made use of the notwithstanding clause of the Canadian constitution and amended the Charter by allowing English provided that the letters are no larger than half the size of the French.

==== Ballantyne, Davidson, McIntyre v. Canada ====
The use of the notwithstanding clause led to formal complaints by three Quebecers: John Ballantyne, Elizabeth Davidson, and Gordon McIntyre, who own businesses in Sutton, Quebec and Huntingdon, Quebec. In 1993, they brought their case before the Human Rights Committee of the United Nations.

They challenged sections 1, 6 and 10 of Bill No. 178 enacted by the Quebec legislature on 22 December 1988. They alleged to be victims of violations of articles 2, 19, 26 and 27 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights by the federal government of Canada and by the Province of Quebec, due to the act&#x27;s prohibitions on the use English in advertising or in the name of their firms.

After hearing both parties, the Committee gave its opinion on what it believed to be the three major issues:

*(a) whether Sec.58 of the Charter of the French Language, as amended by Bill 178, Sec.1, violates any right that the authors might have by virtue of article 27;
*(b) whether Sec.58 of the Charter of the French Language, as amended by Bill 178, Sec.1, violates the authors&#x27; right to freedom of expression;
*(c) whether the same provision is compatible with the authors&#x27; right to equality before the law.
* 1. The Committee observed that &quot;provisions of article 27 refers to minorities in States&quot;, which English-speaking people in Canada are not. It stated that the &quot;authors therefore have no claim under article 27 of the Covenant&quot;.
* 2. The Committee disagreed with the Government of Quebec which asserted &quot;that commercial activities such as outdoor advertising do not fall within the ambit of article 19.&quot; The Committee stated &quot;Article 19, paragraph 2, must be interpreted as encompassing every form of subjective ideas and opinions capable of transmission to others, which are compatible with article 20 of the Covenant, of news and information, of commercial expression and advertising, of works of art, etc.; it should not be confined to means of political, cultural or artistic expression.&quot; The Committee believed that &quot;it [was] not necessary, in order to protect the vulnerable position in Canada of the francophone group, to prohibit commercial advertising in English.&quot; It suggested that &quot;This protection may be achieved in other ways that do not preclude the freedom of expression, in a language of their choice, of those engaged in such fields as trade. For example, the law could have required that advertising be in both French and English.&quot; It concluded that &quot;A State may choose one or more official languages, but it may not exclude, outside the spheres of public life, the freedom to express oneself in a language of one&#x27;s choice. The Committee accordingly concludes that there has been a violation of article 19, paragraph 2.&quot;
* 3. Regarding the right to equality, the Committee found that &quot;the authors have not been discriminated against on the ground of their language, and concludes that there has been no violation of article 26 of the Covenant.&quot;

There were 5 concurring and dissenting opinions, signed by eight Committee members.

==== Internet ====

The Court of Quebec rendered a number of decisions regarding the applicability of the Charter to advertising over the Internet. The court found that commercial websites of businesses that operate from Quebec and sell to Quebec need to conform to the provisions of the Charter regarding the rights of Quebecers to receive services in French. In &quot;A.G. of Quebec (Procureur Général) c. Stanley John Reid et Frances Muriel Reid&quot; (JE 2002-1266), the defendant raised the argument that the content of Internet is of exclusive federal jurisdiction pursuant to the Constitution Act, 1867, and thus its regulation is &quot;ultra vires&quot; of the Quebec Government. The court confirmed the applicability of the Charter on advertising over the Internet.

===Compliance===

With the &quot;Act to amend the Charter of the French language&quot;, S.Q. 1993, c. 40 (also known as &quot;Bill 86&quot;), the National Assembly (under a Quebec Liberal government) amended the Charter of the French Language to make it comply with the Supreme Court rulings. The amending law introduced the &quot;Canada Clause&quot; which replaced the &quot;Quebec Clause&quot;. That is, the recognized right to English language education was extended to all Canadian citizens. It also introduced the current regulations on the &quot;marked predominance&quot; of French on outdoor commercial signs in conformity with the Supreme Court suggestion.

As suggested by the Supreme Court ruling, the current law specifies that commercial outdoor signs can be multilingual so long as French is markedly predominant. The current provisions regarding exterior commercial signs were confirmed as constitutional by the Quebec Court of Appeal in &quot;R.&quot; c. &quot;Entreprises W.F.H.&quot; [2001] R.J.Q. 2557 (C.A.) (also known as &quot;The Lyon &amp; the Walrus Case&quot;). Today, many businesses choose to put up French-only signs, and at times, even change their registered trademarks to adapt to the Quebec market. Nevertheless, English–French bilingualism quickly returned on exterior signs after 1993, especially on the island of Montreal.

<doc id="1295836" wikidata="Q1440190" url="?curid=1295836" title="Fox Theatre (Atlanta)">
<text>The Fox Theatre (often marketed as the Fabulous Fox), a former movie palace, is a performing arts venue located at 660 Peachtree Street NE in Midtown Atlanta, Georgia, and is the centerpiece of the Fox Theatre Historic District.

The theater was originally planned as part of a large Shrine Temple as evidenced by its Moorish design. The 4,665-seat auditorium was ultimately developed as a lavish movie theater in the Fox Theatres chain and opened in 1929. It hosts a variety of cultural and artistic events including the Atlanta Ballet, a summer film series, and performances by national touring companies of Broadway shows. The venue also hosts occasional concerts by popular artists.

==Architectural features==
When the Fox Theatre first opened, the local newspaper described it as having, &quot;a picturesque and almost disturbing grandeur beyond imagination&quot;. It remains a showplace that impresses theater-goers to this day. The principal architect of the project was Olivier Vinour of the firm Marye, Alger and Vinour.

The original architecture and décor of the Fox can be roughly divided into two architectural styles: Islamic architecture (building exterior, auditorium, Grand Salon, mezzanine Gentlemen&#x27;s Lounge and lower Ladies Lounge) and Egyptian architecture (Egyptian Ballroom, mezzanine Ladies Lounge and lower Gentlemen&#x27;s Lounge). The 4,665-seat auditorium, which was designed for movies and live performances, replicates an Arabian courtyard, complete with 96 embedded crystal &quot;stars&quot; (a third of which flicker) in its ceiling and a projection of clouds that slowly drift across this &quot;night sky&quot;. A longstanding rumor that one of the stars was a piece of a Coca-Cola bottle was confirmed in June 2010 when two members of the theater&#x27;s restoration staff conducted a search from within the attic above the auditorium ceiling.

The Egyptian Ballroom is designed after a temple for Ramses II at Karnak while the mezzanine Ladies Lounge features a replica of the throne chair of King Tut and makeup tables that feature tiny Sphinxes. The Islamic sections feature a number of ablution fountains, which are currently kept dry.

Throughout the Fox there is extensive use of &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot;; &quot;wooden&quot; beams are actually plaster, paint that appears gold leaf is not, areas are painted and lit to appear to receive outside lighting, ornate fireplaces were never designed to have working chimneys, and what appears to be a giant Bedouin canopy in the auditorium is plaster and steel rods designed to help funnel sound to the farthest balcony.

The Fox Theatre gives regular tours of the building&#x27;s interior.

==History==
Originally designed as the Yaarab Shrine Temple, the headquarters for a 5,000-member Shriners organization, the $2.75 million project exceeded the Shriners&#x27; budget, so they leased the auditorium to movie mogul William Fox, who was building theaters around the country at the time. The theater opened on December 25, 1929, just two months after the stock market crash and the start of the Great Depression. A week later, on New Year&#x27;s Day, the Shriners inaugurated their new &quot;mosque&quot; in their part of the building, which contained executive offices, a large lounge, a ballroom/banquet hall, kitchen, practice hall, and locker-shower room. Under the terms of the lease, they remained as paying tenants until 1949.

According to the National Park Service, &quot;the Fox Theatre closed only 125 weeks after it opened. Members of the Yaarab Temple could not meet their [mortgage payments], and by 1932, William Fox was bankrupt.&quot; After the mortgage was foreclosed in December 1932, the entire complex was purchased jointly by Paramount Pictures and Lucas &amp; Jenkins, a Georgia company that owned a hundred theatres.

In 1939, the movie most associated with Atlanta and the South, &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, premiered at the now-demolished Loew&#x27;s Grand Theatre rather than the Fox. Although &quot;GWTW&quot; was produced by Selznick International, it was distributed by Loew&#x27;s Incorporated as part of a deal with rival studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The parade down Peachtree Street for the movie&#x27;s premier coincidentally started just outside the Fox because the movie&#x27;s cast was staying across the street at the Georgian Terrace Hotel.

During the 1940s, the Fox acquired strong management and became one of the finest movie theaters in Atlanta. It was also at this time that the Egyptian Ballroom became Atlanta&#x27;s most popular public dance hall and hosted all the important big bands and country and western swing bands of the era. It was notable at that time for being the only theater in Atlanta allowing both white and black patrons. However, there was a separate black box office, entrance, and seating; the segregation wall in the middle of the second dress seating still remains, and the &quot;colored&quot; box office window stands unused at the back entrance. These are left in place for educational and historical purposes. The theater was integrated in 1962.

During the 1970s, several elements collided to bring about the Fox&#x27;s decline – white flight, the rise of suburban multiplex theaters, and changes in how films were distributed. In 1974, Southern Bell, the regional arm of AT&amp;T, approached the owners of the theater with an offer to buy and with the intent of tearing it down and building the parking deck for a new headquarters on the site. A group was formed to save the theater and it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in May 1974. The ensuing public outcry and massive campaign, including such entertainers as Liberace and Lynyrd Skynyrd (recording their first live album there and debuting guitarist Ed King&#x27;s replacement, Steve Gaines, to the world), among other celebrities, resulted in the city refusing to issue a demolition permit. Ultimately, a complicated deal was brokered that prevented the Fox&#x27;s demolition. The Southern Bell Building (now Tower Square) was built on land adjacent to the theater on the building&#x27;s west side in conjunction with the construction of the North Avenue MARTA station, with its parking deck built on the north end of the property at the corner of West Peachtree and 3rd streets. The U.S. Department of the Interior subsequently named the Fox a National Historic Landmark on May 26, 1976, citing its architectural uniqueness.

After the Fox was saved from demolition, a lengthy and expensive restoration process began. Much of the original décor had survived and new pieces were created with the help of old photographs. Today, the Fox appears much as it did when it opened, with some additions that were in the original plans but had to be scrapped in the 1920s due to financial constraints. Other changes have been made to bring the building up to current safety codes.

The Fox is now the only remaining movie palace in Atlanta. The Loew&#x27;s Grand, Martin Cinerama, Georgia Cinerama, Paramount Theater, and the Roxy Theater, all once-famous Atlanta movie palaces, are gone, and others that opened in the 1960s have since been converted to multiplexes. The Fox Theatre, now run under the non-profit Atlanta Landmarks, Inc., hosts a multitude of cultural and artistic events, including the Atlanta Ballet&#x27;s annual Nutcracker performances, a summer film series, and performances for various national touring companies of Broadway shows. Because of its origins as a movie house, the Fox has a shallow stage by theatrical standards and is unable—without extensive but temporary alterations—to accommodate some of the set pieces required by modern large scale shows such as &quot;The Lion King&quot; and &quot;Miss Saigon&quot;.

In June 2006, the theater installed a $130,000 digital cinema video projection system, which debuted with a showing of &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; on June 26, part of the Summer Film Festival. The sing-alongs that precede each feature are still shown by the Brenograph Movie projector which was installed in 1929.

The Egyptian Ballroom and the Grand Salon are rented regularly for corporate and private functions, including banquets, fundraisers, weddings, trade shows and conventions. They are also both popular spots for proms for many area high schools. Notably, Oxford College of Emory University hosts its annual Fall Formal in the Egyptian Ballroom.

Every year since Atlanta Landmarks assumed management in 1975, the Fox has generated an operating surplus. An estimated 750,000 people visit the Fox every year. The venue was the site of Prince&#x27;s final performance, held one week before his death on April 21, 2016. In May 2017, Aquarium Rescue Unit frontman Col. Bruce Hampton died after collapsing onstage at the Fox during a concert celebrating his 70th birthday.

On February 2, 2019, the Fox hosted the NFL Honors ahead of Super Bowl LIII at Mercedes-Benz Stadium.

Elvis Presley played at the Fox Theatre in 1956, Bruce Springsteen played it in 1976, 1978 and 1996, Bob Marley and the Wailers performed there on December 12, 1979, in support of his Survival Tour and Pearl Jam played there in 1994, and the Rolling Stones in 1981. Georgia musicians the Allman Brothers played at the Fox Theatre in 1980, Ray Charles in 1983, James Brown in 1985, R.E.M. in 1989, the B-52&#x27;s in 1989 and 2022, the Black Crowes in 1992, Alan Jackson in 1992, Widespread Panic in 1993, Collective Soul in 1996, Jeff Foxworthy in &#x27;01, Outkast in 2001, Indigo Girls in &#x27;04, Zac Brown Band in 2009 (released on the live album &quot;Pass the Jar&quot;), Monica in 2010, Mastodon in 2017, Manchester Orchestra in 2018, Drivin&#x27; N&#x27; Cryin&#x27; with Drive-By Truckers in &#x27;19, Blackberry Smoke in &#x27;19, Travis Tritt in &#x27;19, and The Georgia Satellites in 2022.

On September 17, 2024, the Fox Theatre hosted &quot;Jimmy Carter 100: A Celebration in Song&quot;, an event concert to celebrate the 100th birthday of former president Jimmy Carter. The event was produced by the Carter Center and featured appearances by musicians and celebrities.

==The Mighty Mo==
The Fox features a four manual (or keyboard) 42-rank pipe organ nicknamed the &quot;Mighty Mo&quot;. It was custom built for the Fox by M. P. Möller, Inc. in 1929 in Hagerstown, Maryland. With 3,622 pipes, it is the second-largest theater organ in the country, behind the Wurlitzer at Radio City Music Hall in New York City and was the largest theater instrument built by Möller.

As a true theater organ, as opposed to a church organ, Mighty Mo boasts pipes that range in size from 32 feet (nearly 10 meters) tall to the size of a small ballpoint pen, and is designed to imitate the sounds of a full orchestra. Besides the pipes, it also contains a marimba, xylophone, glockenspiel, drums, sleigh bells, a gong, and even a six-foot (1.8m) grand piano (originally from the Kilgen organ in Chicago&#x27;s Piccadilly Theatre); plus a large variety of silent movie sound effects (such as various car horns, thunder and rain effects, bird whistles, etc.). The organ is remarkable for a theater organ because it also includes 12 ranks of pipes for a church organ, known as the &quot;Ethereal&quot; division. Thus the organ can be played as a church organ as well as a theater organ. It is noteworthy that the Mighty Mo is among the shrinking list of instruments which remain installed in the theaters for which they were designed.

Larry Douglas Embury was the theater&#x27;s permanent Organist in Residence from 2002 until his death in February 2016. In that capacity he presided over the Mighty Mo in performances during the Fox&#x27;s summer film festival and the Atlanta Ballet&#x27;s annual production of &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;. In September 2002, he hosted &quot;Fox at the Fox,&quot; a concert commemorating the twenty-second anniversary of the death of the great concert organist, Virgil Fox. Fox had played a famous series of &quot;Fox at the Fox&quot; concerts on the Mighty Mo at the Fox Theatre in the 1970s.

==Private residence==
The Fox also contains a apartment that served as the private residence of Joe Patten, who served as technical director from 1974 to 2004. Patten, who was born in 1927, and died on April 7, 2016, was granted a lifetime rent-free lease to the apartment. Patten first became involved with the Fox when he volunteered to restore the theater&#x27;s Moller pipe organ. He later was instrumental in the movement to save the Fox from demolition. The apartment occupies space previously used as an office by the Shriners, who had built the Fox as a meeting hall. The apartment&#x27;s walls are 2 to thick, and a passageway leads from the bedroom to a former spotlight platform at the top of the auditorium. A separate entrance provides direct access to the street outside the theater.

Patten&#x27;s presence is credited with having saved the Fox from a fast-moving fire in April 1996. The pre-dawn blaze, which broke out in the attic wiring, caused $2 million in damage. Damage likely would have been greater if Patten had not been on site to call the fire department, said Alan Thomas, president of Atlanta Landmarks, the nonprofit agency that owns the Fox.

Atlanta Landmarks had no definite plan on how the apartment will be used after Patten&#x27;s death. &quot;We could use it for dressing space, rehearsal halls,&quot; Thomas told the &quot;Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot;. &quot;It&#x27;s unlikely that we&#x27;d let anyone else live there.&quot;

On August 30, 2010, local news outlets reported a dispute between Patten and the non-profit Atlanta Landmarks which owns the theater. Patten reported that he was being evicted from his apartment by the group which he helped to found. Meanwhile, the Atlanta Landmarks board in a statement to the public indicated their intent to draw a new lease which addressed Patten&#x27;s health needs. They stated he remained welcome to live in the apartment.

<doc id="1295837" wikidata="Q11958" url="?curid=1295837" title="Phillip Cocu">
<text>Phillip John-William Cocu (born 29 October 1970) is a Dutch professional football manager and former midfielder who was most recently the manager of Vitesse.

Cocu was born in Eindhoven but raised in Zevenaar, playing youth football for local clubs DCS and De Graafschap. After a year at AFC &#x27;34, he started his professional career at AZ. In 1990, Cocu moved to Vitesse. A broken fibula disrupted his first season, but he became a first-team regular in the following four seasons. In 1995, he joined PSV, where he won the KNVB Cup and the Eredivisie title in 1997. Cocu played for Barcelona between 1998 and 2004. There, he would become club captain, win La Liga in 1999 and play two Champions League semi-finals. He left the club in 2004 as club record holder for the most league appearances by a foreign player. During Cocu&#x27;s second stint at PSV, he won another three Eredivisie titles and reached the Champions League semi-finals. After a year at Al Jazira, Cocu retired from professional football.

Cocu debuted for the Netherlands national team in 1996 and appeared at the 1998 World Cup, scoring two goals but missing a penalty in the semi-finals against Brazil. He also played at the 2006 World Cup, as well as the 1996, 2000 and 2004 European Championships. Cocu reached the semi-finals in the latter two tournaments and in 2004, he served as captain of the Dutch team. With 101 caps, Cocu is eighth on the list of most Dutch international appearances. During his career, he mainly played as a defensive &quot;playmaker&quot; in midfield, but became equally known for his ability to be fielded as a defender, wing back, winger or forward.

After his retirement from playing professional football, Cocu joined PSV again as youth coach and later assistant manager. He also served as assistant at the Dutch team under Bert van Marwijk between 2008 and 2012. Cocu was caretaker manager at PSV in 2012, during which he won the KNVB Cup. In 2013, he was officially appointed as PSV manager, and won three league titles in his five years at the club.

== Early career ==
Cocu was born in Eindhoven, but he and his family moved to Zevenaar when he was three years old after his father switched jobs. He started playing youth football at the local amateur club DCS when he was six. Even though youth players normally were not allowed to play until they were seven, the team made an exception for Cocu. He played for DCS until he was picked up by De Graafschap&#x27;s youth academy. After a short period, he moved to AFC &#x27;34 in 1986. A year later, his talent was again noticed by a professional club and in June 1987, Cocu joined the AZ youth ranks.

==Club career==

=== Early years ===
Cocu began in the AZ reserve squad but was soon added to the first team. He made his professional debut on 22 January 1989, when assistant coach Hugo Hovenkamp (replacing the bedridden manager Hans Eijkenbroek) brought him on in an Eerste Divisie match against NEC. The 18-year-old played as left winger at the time. Cocu scored his first goal two weeks later in a cup match against Fortuna Sittard, followed up by his first league goal in March against SVV. He would go on and score four goals in his first season. In the 1989-90 season, he appeared in nearly every league match. After the competition ended, Cocu was sold to the newly promoted Vitesse for €272,000.

Cocu played only eight matches in his first Vitesse season after he suffered a broken fibula. He had a more productive second season, playing most matches and scoring three times. He netted his first Vitesse goal in August 1991 in a match against ADO Den Haag. In Arnhem, Cocu changed from being a left winger to a central midfielder. Coach Herbert Neumann envisioned a leading central role for Cocu in 1991 and placed him on the midfield position. In 1992, Cocu played his first European match when Vitesse faced Derry City. After Vitesse defeated Derry City, they beat Belgian side Mechelen in the following round. The away match was decided by a long-range effort from Cocu (1–0). Vitesse was eventually knocked out by Real Madrid. In the Eredivisie, the team finished in fourth place. Cocu also played all league matches and doubled his goal tally in his third season. In the 1993–94 season, Cocu scored 11 Eredivisie goals, including three in a 5–0 victory over Go Ahead Eagles in December. After the season, Louis van Gaal and Ajax became interested in buying Cocu, but they could not meet the transfer fee demands. A year later, PSV and Feyenoord triggered the release clause in Cocu&#x27;s contract, making Vitesse unable to reject the offer. He eventually chose to play for PSV.

Cocu was signed in June 1995 in a joint-transfer with Chris van der Weerden. He immediately scored in his PSV debut against Fortuna Sittard (1–3). In his first season, he won the KNVB Cup with PSV. In the final against Sparta Rotterdam (5–2), Cocu scored the first goal. In October 1996, Cocu scored twice in a 7–2 win against Feyenoord. That season, Cocu and PSV would go on to win the Johan Cruyff Shield, beating Ajax 3–0, and the Eredivisie. In the 1997–98 season, Cocu won the Johan Cruyff Shield again after scoring twice in a 3–1 victory against Roda JC. In the Eredivisie, PSV finished second behind Ajax. The KNVB Cup final was also lost to Ajax (5–0). After the season, Cocu decided not to extend his contract, demonstrating his intent to leave on a free transfer. Atlético Madrid, Real Madrid, Juventus, Inter Milan and Lazio were all keen on signing Cocu, but he ultimately chose to join Barcelona, the club he supported as a child.

===Barcelona===
In Barcelona, Cocu found himself with fellow Dutchmen Louis van Gaal, Michael Reiziger, Frank de Boer, Patrick Kluivert, Boudewijn Zenden, Ronald de Boer and Winston Bogarde. Forming a midfield with Luís Figo and Pep Guardiola, Cocu played 36 league matches and scored 12 goals, thereby contributing to Barcelona&#x27;s La Liga title win. In March, Cocu decided the match against Real Sociedad by scoring both goals (2–0). In his second season, the team finished second in the league behind Deportivo de La Coruña. Cocu scored six league goals, including two against Real Oviedo (a 3–2 win) and two against Athletic Bilbao (a 4–0 win). Barcelona and Cocu reached the Champions League semi-finals, where they were knocked-out by Valencia. Cocu scored the final goal in the return leg. In 2000, Van Gaal left and was succeeded by Lorenzo Serra Ferrer and Carles Rexach. But in the following two seasons, the team performances declined even more, with Barcelona twice ending fourth in the league.

In 2001, Pep Guardiola left Barcelona, making space for a new midfield consisting of Cocu, Xavi and Gabri. In the 2001–02 season, Barcelona reached the Champions League semi-finals again, but were denied the final by Real Madrid. In 2002, the returning coach Louis van Gaal chose Cocu as vice-captain behind Luis Enrique. The 2002–03 season was Barcelona&#x27;s worst in years, however: the team finished sixth in La Liga, Van Gaal was fired early on and Cocu tore his knee ligament in a Champions League match against Inter Milan (0–0) in February. He was sidelined for two months. Weeks earlier, Barcelona had already beat Inter 3–0, with a goal by Cocu. With his contract expiring in 2003, he waited until after the FC Barcelona presidential elections to make a decision on extension. Cocu, who intended to join PSV if the negotiations failed, eventually agreed on a one-year extension in June.

The 2003–04 season began with new coach Frank Rijkaard. Cocu scored Barcelona&#x27;s first goal of the league season, deciding the match against Athletic Bilbao (1–0). He played 36 league matches in total and also frequently served as the team captain. Barcelona finished second in La Liga. In early 2004, Barça announced it would not renew Cocu&#x27;s contract. Both parties could not agree on a new deal after he did not accept Barcelona&#x27;s significantly-lowered offer. Cocu was disappointed by the club&#x27;s decision, but was happy to return to PSV, whose offer always remained. After his departure, he was awarded a plaque for his loyalty by club president Joan Laporta. Cocu&#x27;s 205 La Liga matches and 291 total appearances were Barcelona records for a foreign player when he left; both records remained until Lionel Messi surpassed them in 2011 and 2012 respectively.

===PSV and Al-Jazira===
In 2004, Cocu signed a two-year contract with PSV. He formed a midfield with Johann Vogel and captain Mark van Bommel in a side that won the Eredivisie, the KNVB Cup and reached the Champions League semi-finals in the 2004–05 season. In the Champions League, Cocu scored the PSV away goal in the quarter-final match against Lyon (1–1). PSV reached the semi-finals, but were ultimately eliminated by Milan. After losing the away leg 2–0, PSV went 2–0 ahead in the return game with a goal by Cocu. A goal by Milan&#x27;s Massimo Ambrosini, however, ended the hope to reach the finals, despite an injury-time second goal by Cocu. In the domestic league, Cocu missed the title-winning match against Vitesse after a sending-off in the previous match. He was handed his second yellow card against Willem II after being provoked by Martijn Reuser.

When Mark van Bommel left PSV in 2005, Cocu was handed the role of captain by manager Guus Hiddink. PSV won the league title again and reached the second round of the Champions League, where they were eliminated by Lyon. Cocu was sent off in the return match. For his league performances, Cocu won the Zilveren Schoen as the second-best Eredivisie player that year. After the 2005–06 season, Cocu signed a one-year contract extension with PSV. The team started the 2006–07 season well, but the performances heavily declined in the second half of the season and the title was almost lost. The championship was to be decided on the last league round, with PSV facing Vitesse. PSV won the match 5–1, with Cocu scoring the final goal. This goal eventually decided the title race: the goal difference between PSV and runners-up Ajax was one goal, just enough for the Eredivisie title win.

Cocu was close to announcing his retirement after the 2006–07 season, but still received offers from Australia and Al Jazira Club. After consulting Al Jazira&#x27;s Abe Knoop and László Jámbor (who worked for Ajax), he chose to sign a one-year deal with the club from the United Arab Emirates in August 2007. In his first match, played against Al Wasl, he immediately scored in the team&#x27;s 2–1 victory. With Al-Jazira, Cocu appeared in 17 league matches and scored four goals. After the season ended, Cocu considered staying for another year, but ultimately chose to return to the Netherlands in time for the professional football coach course. In July 2009, Cocu received a testimonial match from PSV at the Philips Stadion. An all-star team consisting of Luís Figo, Edgar Davids, Frank de Boer and many other former players competed against the PSV first team.

==International career==

Cocu was close to his international debut in 1994. Coach Dick Advocaat listed him on the 25-man provisional squad for the 1994 World Cup due to his performances at Vitesse, but he eventually did not make the team. His international debut came at age 25 in early 1996 in an exhibition match against Germany, handed to him by Guus Hiddink. Cocu scored his first international goal against the Republic of Ireland in June. Cocu was called up for Euro 1996 by Hiddink. He appeared as a substitute in two group stage matches and was included in the first team for the quarter-final defeat against France. Two years later, the Dutch team qualified for the 1998 World Cup, with Cocu having secured his place as a first-team member. He appeared in all World Cup matches, while scoring in the group stage matches against South Korea and Mexico. In the semi-final against Brazil, the match went to a penalty shoot-out. Cocu took the third Dutch penalty, but his attempt was saved by Cláudio Taffarel. The Netherlands eventually lost the shoot-out (4–2) and missed out on the final.

Cocu and the Netherlands were present at Euro 2000 after automatically qualifying as a host. The Dutch side, with Cocu in all fixtures, won all group matches and the quarter-final against Yugoslavia. Still, Cocu and the team were again eliminated after a penalty shoot-out in the semi-finals, this time against Italy. The Netherlands and Cocu failed to qualify for the 2002 World Cup in a qualification group with Portugal and the Republic of Ireland. In 2003, Cocu received his first international sending-off in a friendly match against Belgium. The Netherlands did well in the Euro 2004 qualifiers, with Cocu scoring twice (both in separate matches against Austria). During Euro 2004, Cocu was chosen as team captain and appeared in all matches. In the quarter-finals against Sweden, he missed a penalty in the shoot-out, but the Netherlands still managed to win. In the semi-finals, the team was eliminated by hosts Portugal. After Euro 2004, Cocu lost the captain role to Edgar Davids, a decision made by new manager Marco van Basten.

The Netherlands qualified for the 2006 World Cup, with Cocu scoring three times in the qualifying matches. Cocu was a first-team member in most games, but a sending-off against Andorra in September 2005 meant that Cocu missed the last two qualifiers. At the World Cup, the Netherlands progressed from the group stage, but were knocked out by Portugal in the second round, with Cocu coming close to equalizing by hitting the crossbar shortly after the start of the second half. After the tournament, Cocu retired from international football. With 101 caps for the Netherlands, Cocu is currently ranked fifth in the list of most Dutch international appearances. He was granted a farewell and a golden plaque for his services before the match against Belarus in September 2006. In 2011, Cocu was named &quot;bondsridder&quot; of the Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB), an honorary title for his service to Dutch football.

==Style of play==

A complete and versatile player, Cocu played as a defender, midfielder and forward, later noting that he never played as a full-back on the right or as a goalkeeper.

==Managerial career==
===PSV Eindhoven===
After Cocu&#x27;s return from the UAE in 2008, he showed interest in becoming a football coach. He joined the professional football coach course in order to achieve the necessary coaching badges and returned to PSV to assist in several youth squads. Cocu was also immediately appointed second assistant of Bert van Marwijk, who became manager of the Netherlands national team. Later, his role at PSV changed to assisting Ernest Faber at the PSV under-19 squad and becoming a trainee for the PSV first team under Huub Stevens in late 2008. After Stevens resigned in January 2009, Cocu became the assistant manager under caretaker manager Dwight Lodeweges. After the season finished, he continued to be part-time available for the first team. In February 2010, he passed his coaching exam, enabling him to be a manager in the Netherlands. A month later, Cocu agreed to remain assistant manager for the Dutch national team for another two years. With the Netherlands, he was present at the 2010 World Cup, where the team lost the final against Spain.

In December 2010, Cocu was promoted to first assistant manager at the Dutch national team after Frank de Boer became manager of Ajax. In the summer of 2011, Cocu signed a new two-year contract with PSV. When Fred Rutten was dismissed as PSV manager in March 2012, Cocu was appointed as caretaker manager for the remainder of the season. Faber joined PSV from FC Eindhoven to serve as Cocu&#x27;s assistant. During his few months as manager, he promoted youngster Memphis Depay to the first team and replaced Andreas Isaksson with Przemysław Tytoń as the side&#x27;s starting goalkeeper. The results did not improve, however, and after a 2–1 home defeat against RKC Waalwijk, Cocu vocally forfeited the title race. Despite winning the last five games in a row, Cocu and PSV finished third in the league, therefore missing out on Champions League football. Nonetheless, the team won the KNVB Cup by beating Heracles Almelo 3–0 in the final.

For the 2012–13 season, the PSV board appointed Dick Advocaat as the new manager. Eager to gain more experience in coaching a team, Cocu took up the position of the PSV under-19 coach. He also gave up his job as assistant manager at the Dutch national team after Euro 2012, in which the Netherlands were eliminated in the first round. During the season, it was decided that Cocu would succeed Advocaat in case he would announce his departure. When Advocaat quit post-season, Cocu signed a four-year contract as manager of PSV. Joined by Faber and Chris van der Weerden as his assistants, Cocu stressed his emphasis on developing players from the PSV youth ranks. On 18 April 2015, Cocu won the Eredivisie title after a 4–1 win over Heerenveen. This was PSV&#x27;s first league title since 2008, also ending a four-year domination of the league by Ajax. Cocu&#x27;s team successfully defended the league title one season later.

===Fenerbahçe===
On 22 June 2018, Cocu was appointed on a three-year deal at Turkey&#x27;s Fenerbahçe, who were under new ownership. He was dismissed on 28 October with the club just one point and one place above the relegation zone, following a 3–1 home loss to MKE Ankaragücü.

===Derby County===
On 5 July 2019, Cocu was announced as the new manager of Championship club Derby County. He guided Derby to a 10th-place finish, whilst installing a sense of total football locally known as Cocuball. On 14 November 2020, Cocu and Derby parted company with the club at the bottom of the league table.

===Vitesse===
Cocu returned to work after almost two years on 26 September 2022, being appointed at 14th-placed Vitesse, where he had left as a player in 1995. He replaced Thomas Letsch, who had left for VfL Bochum. He resigned on 11 November 2023 after a 1–3 home loss to SC Heerenveen, which saw the team at the bottom of the league with eight points after twelve matches.

<text>Xenophanes is a lunar impact crater that is located along the northwestern limb of the Moon. It is nearly attached to Volta, a similar formation to the south-southwest. To the northeast is the smaller crater Cleostratus. Xenophanes is significantly foreshortened when viewed from the Earth, hindering observation.

It is a worn and eroded crater with a battered outer rim that is overlaid by several smaller craters. The rim is a circular range of rugged, irregular ground that is notched in places along the inner wall. A chain of small craters lies along the northern and northeastern rim. At the west end, a pair of clefts in the rim nearly join the floor to the surface beyond. To the northeast, Xenophanes A is an impact crater with a sharp rim and a rough interior.

The interior surface is irregular, but sections have been resurfaced by basaltic lava. A pair of flooded crater rims lie along the southern and northeast sections of the interior. The interior is more level and less rough at the eastern end.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Xenophanes.

<doc id="1295850" wikidata="Q60262" url="?curid=1295850" title="Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel-Bevern">
<text>Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel-Bevern (8 November 1715 – 13 January 1797) was Queen of Prussia (Queen in Prussia until 1772) and Electress of Brandenburg as the wife of Frederick the Great. She was the longest-serving Prussian queen, with a tenure of more than 46 years. She was praised for her charity work during the Seven Years&#x27; War.

==Crown princess==
In 1730, Crown Prince Frederick of Prussia tried to flee from the tyrannical regime of his father, King Frederick William I, but was caught and imprisoned. To regain his freedom, he was required to marry Elisabeth Christine, daughter of Ferdinand Albert II, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel and his wife Antoinette, in 1733. Elisabeth&#x27;s maternal aunt Elisabeth Christine was the wife of Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor. The match had thus been sought diplomatically by the Austrian court as well as by the &quot;imperial party&quot; around the king. This was in sharp contrast to the &quot;English party&quot; around Queen Sophie Dorothea, sister of King George II of Great Britain, and Crown Prince Frederick himself. They were seeking a marriage to the Queen&#x27;s niece, Princess Amelia of Great Britain, which would result in a strong alliance between Prussia and Great Britain and was considered by the somewhat vain young prince a more &quot;brilliant&quot; match than the &quot;provincial&quot; Elisabeth Christine.

However, on 12 June, 17-year-old Elisabeth Christine was married to Frederick at her father&#x27;s summer palace, Schloss Salzdahlum in Wolfenbüttel, Germany. On their wedding night, Frederick spent a reluctant hour with his wife and then walked about outside for the rest of the night. Due to the circumstances behind their betrothal, he was well known to have resented the marriage from the very beginning. Thus, Elizabeth&#x27;s position at the Berlin court was difficult from the beginning, as the only support that she could count on was the king&#x27;s.

Elisabeth indeed remained attached to her father-in-law, who was particularly fond of her piety, which did nothing to endear her husband. Frederick is widely presumed to have been homosexual, having shown no sexual or even platonic interest in women; the only woman whom he considered a close friend was his older sister, Wilhelmine. However, he was shrewd enough to recognise the opportunity Elisabeth provided to improve his own relationship with his father and systematically used her to gain royal favours. During the first year of their marriage, Frederick was garrisoned in command of his own regiment, at his establishment at Ruppin, which he had been given by his father after the betrothal, while Elisabeth lived in Berlin at the king&#x27;s court. Her husband showered her with letters asking for things such as travel permits and money from the king or even demanding that she run up debts in Brunswick to pay for his expenses. 
This pattern continued even after the couple moved to Rheinsberg Palace in 1736.

==Queen consort==
After the death of her father-in-law, her husband acceded to the throne of Prussia as Frederick II in 1740. He had no known affairs with women and presided over a very spartan, almost military court where women rarely appeared. He did not care for ceremonial court life and representation and left most of the posts in his own court vacant at Potsdam. During the first years of his reign, he did somewhat revive the court life, but after Sanssouci Palace in Potsdam was completed in 1747, he spent his life more isolated in Sanssouci in the summer and the City Palace, Potsdam in the winter, and only appeared at the official royal court in Berlin at special occasions such as royal birthdays and visits of foreign princes. Despite his personal contempt for representational court life, however, he realized its importance in the system of state and therefore did not abolish court life in Prussia, but rather left all court duties to Elisabeth.

Elisabeth had a very visible and public role in Prussia. During the first 17 years of her husband&#x27;s reign, she shared the representational duties of the court with her mother-in-law until the latter&#x27;s death in 1757, after which she handled them alone, as the only member of the royal family living in the huge Berlin Palace. Frederick also gave Elisabeth her own summer residence, Schönhausen Palace near Berlin, and redecorated her apartments in the Berlin Royal Palace, appointing a large court for her to assist her in upholding the court routine. In Berlin, Elisabeth received foreign princes, ambassadors and generals; entertained the royal family and Prussian aristocracy with concerts; and hosted a circle of Lutheran theologians such as Anton Friedrich Büsching, Johann Joachim Spalding and Johann Friedrich Zöllner. At both residences, she presided at the weekly reception days, &quot;courtage&quot;, which were the only occasions where the entire Prussian royal court assembled as a whole during the reign of Frederick the Great, who hardly ever took part himself. In addition to the courtages, large dinners, balls, opera performances, ambassador&#x27;s receptions and family celebrations (birthdays, christenings, weddings) were on her program. Her receptions were always well attended as she hosted the only court life taking place in Prussia at the time, which made it an important social center and a place to meet important people.

A reception by Elisabeth Christine in Schönhausen was described in 1779 by the English tourist Dr. Moore:

Despite the fact that Frederick entrusted the role of representation to her, he did not always give her the funds necessary to play this role, and it caused surprise to foreigners that the king did not give the queen funds necessary to entertain more lavishly. As the king became more spartan over the years, the receptions of the queen became more underfunded, Charpentier once joking: &quot;The Queen must have a grand gala tonight; I saw an old lamp lighted on the staircase as I passed!&quot; The king himself only very rarely attended any of the court events, while the queen was always present. He visited the birthday celebration of the queen only twice between 1741 and 1762. Frederick was often absent even at his own official birthday celebration, where she received birthday congratulations in his place, and when he did attend, he normally appeared very briefly. Frederick was often absent even at important functions, such as the state visit of the Tsesarevich Paul in 1776.

When he did appear in Berlin, mainly during the carnival ball season, Frederick normally did not represent at his own apartment, but merely visited the queen&#x27;s reception in her apartment. While he on rare occasions participated in Berlin court life, he never visited her court at Schönhausen, nor was she ever invited to Sanssouci. On the one hand, compliance with protocol and etiquette was important to him, so he made sure that the queen&#x27;s carriage always drove directly behind his on ceremonial processions, even in front of that of his adored mother. On the other hand, he humiliated her by not even inviting her to some important celebrations. Neither did she receive an invitation to the inauguration of the new wing of Charlottenburg Palace in the summer of 1746, nor to a large celebration that the king gave in August 1749 in honor of his mother in Sanssouci.

In 1763, when after the Seven Years&#x27; War, Frederick saw his wife for the first time in six years, he only told her &quot;Madame has become more stout&quot; and then turned to his waiting sisters. Despite his lack of interest in her person, he demanded that she should be respected in her capacity as a queen, but his separation from her along with her aroused pity made it hard for her to receive respect from the nobility: on one occasion, the opera singers refused to appear at her concert and she forced Frederick to demand that she be treated with respect. In many aspects her situation was similar to that of her sister-in-law, Princess Wilhelmina, the neglected wife of the king&#x27;s brother Prince Henry, only that the queen consort had an important representational task.

===Influence===
During the Seven Years&#x27; War, the king was permanently absent from the capital for six years, which made the queen the symbol of Prussian resilience in the capital during the crisis. Elisabeth was often greeted by cheering crowds when she appeared in public. When Berlin was threatened in 1757, it was Elisabeth who took the responsibility for the royal house and ordered for its evacuation to Magdeburg. She was able to return to Berlin in 1758, but was again forced to evacuate in 1760. It was on the first of these occasions that she saw Sanssouci for the first time.

Elisabeth was interested in political literature and authored several translations under the pseudonym &quot;Constance&quot;. After the death of her friend Sophie Caroline von Camas in 1766, she published a French translation of . Her translations of the aroused public patriotism during the War of Bavarian Succession. Her political works were included in the royal library and the king presented her with his own ideas.

Elisabeth successfully introduced silk cultivation to Prussia and was involved in charity, to which she contributed 23,000 thalers out of her allowance of 40,000 thalers, more than half her income. She said of herself: &quot;God has graciously kept me, so that I need not reproach myself for any action by which any person has with my knowledge been hurt.&quot; Elisabeth is noted to have acted as an intermediary and interceded in favor of supplicants. She particularly supported the French émigrés community in Berlin. Spalding commented: &quot;her memory will always be blessed as a touching example of the noblest mental qualities, the most enlightened and lively piety, and the most wonderfully active benevolence.&quot;

==Queen dowager==

Elisabeth Christine became queen dowager upon the death of Frederick the Great on 17 August 1786. Elisabeth was not present at the death of her spouse and had not seen him since January of that year, but was given public sympathy for his death because of the popularity she enjoyed among the public, to all of whom, according to Spalding, she was &quot;so dear in her affliction.&quot; She commented on the death of Frederick to his successor, Frederick William II, with the words:

In the will of Frederick the Great, Elisabeth was secured not only the continuation of her usual income, but also an additional 10,000 thalers annually, residence, games, wine, and firewood in the royal palaces of her choice, and a directive that his successor and nephew Frederick William always treat her with respect due to her position. As queen dowager, Elisabeth Christine had an active role in public life. Due to her long experience in handling the representational life of the reign of Frederick the Great, &quot;the Queen Dowager, who, by her circumspection and natural dignity, was of more importance than the Queen&quot;, was often consulted in court matters. She was a center in the family life of the royal house, corresponding with them while they were away, particularly with her former foster daughter Princess Frederica Charlotte of Prussia.

<text>Young is a lunar impact crater that is located in the rugged southeast part of the Moon&#x27;s near side. It lies to the east of the crater Metius, and southeast of Rheita. The long Vallis Rheita follows a line tangential to the southwest rim of Rheita, and cuts a wide trough through the southwest floor and outer rim of Young.

The surviving part of the crater is a worn, eroded formation that has seen better times. The rim and inner wall can still be followed across the surface, but it is indented and notched by smaller impacts. The inner floor contains a pair of small, bowl-shaped craters designated Young A and Young B.

To the south of Young, the valley is overlain by Young D, a somewhat less eroded feature than Young. The valley continues intermittently to the southeast, spanning a total distance of about 500 kilometers. This is the longest valley on the near side of the Moon.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Young.

<text>Pachacamac or Pacha Kamaq (Quechua, &quot;Creator of the World&quot;; also &quot;Pacharurac&quot;) was the deity worshipped in the city of Pachacamac (modern-day Peru) by the Ichma.

Pacha Kamaq was believed to have created the first man and woman, but forgot to give them food and the man died. The woman cursed Pacha Kamaq, accusing him of neglect, and Pacha Kamaq made her fertile. Later Pacha Kamaq killed her son and cut the corpse into pieces, each of which became a separate fruit or vegetable plant. The woman&#x27;s second son, Wichama, escaped, so Pacha Kamaq killed the woman. Wichama sought revenge and drove Pacha Kamaq into the ocean.

Tahuantinsuyu adopted Pacha Kamaq when they incorporated the Ichma into their empire. In late Inca mythology he was the father of Inti and Mama Killa, and husband of Mama Pacha. The Wari, the Pachacamac empire, Chancay, Chimor and Ichma possessed the city of Pachacamac at some point but it is unknown if any other peoples, apart from the Ichma, worshipped the Pacha Kamaq deity.

<text>The [[Olympus Corporation|Olympus]] AZ-4 Zoom is a 35mm fixed-lens SLR camera introduced in 1989.

==Overview==
The camera is almost identical to the Ricoh Mirai, except it does not have a remote control socket and uses different batteries. It was one of the earliest examples of a Superzoom lens, with an ability to zoom from 35 to 135mm. The zoom lens moves slowly compared to modern 35mm cameras, and the autofocus is slower and less reliable. However, the images it can achieve are of a very high standard particularly in terms of sharpness.

It has the following features usually only found on SLR cameras:

*Real image viewfinder
*Manual focusing mode
*Exposure adjustment
*Shutter speed adjustment
*Hotshoe for external flash

It has the following features usually only found on compact cameras:

*Autofocus
*Built in pop up flash
*Self timer (Timer to take photo 10 seconds after shutter is pressed)
*Fill-in flash

It also has the following features
*LCD
*Beeps when autofocus locks
*Tripod socket

Some models use 2 123 size lithium batteries. The version marketed by Ricoh can accept a large lithium battery or four AAA size batteries. There is also a Quartz date model, and the back on a regular model can be removed and replaced with a data back.

== Trivia ==
The camera appeared in the 1989 Batman film.

<doc id="1295858" wikidata="Q1892925" url="?curid=1295858" title="Papineau station">
<text>Papineau station () is a Montreal Metro station in the borough of Ville-Marie in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) and serves the Green Line. It is one of two Metro stations that service Montreal&#x27;s Gay Village, part of the Centre-Sud district. It opened on October 14, 1966, as part of the original network of the Metro. It briefly served as the terminus of the Green Line until Frontenac station opened two months later.

== Overview ==
Designed by Bolduc et Venne, it is a normal side platform station, built in tunnel. A transept leads to a long set of stairways to the entrance, located in the centre of a public square. The temporary entrance building was recently replaced by a new permanent one, designed by Mario Bibeau.

In 2022, the STM&#x27;s Universal Accessibility Report noted that design work to make the station accessible was underway.

== Architecture and art ==

The station features a set of three murals by Jean Cartier and George Juhasz at the transept level. Entitled &quot;Les Patriotes de 1837–1838&quot;, these tell the story of the Patriotes Rebellion and commemorate Louis-Joseph Papineau, the famous son of this station&#x27;s namesake. Also, the redevelopment of the square around the station&#x27;s entrance included the addition of a sculpture, &quot;Révolutions&quot;, by Michel de Broin.

==Origin of the name==
Papineau takes its name from nearby av. Papineau, named for Joseph Papineau, a notary, surveyor, politician, and defender of the rights of the people and of the French language. His son, Louis-Joseph Papineau, led the Patriotes Rebellion, the Lower Canadian portion of the Rebellions of 1837.

<doc id="1295867" wikidata="Q1580421" url="?curid=1295867" title="Auguste Joseph Alphonse Gratry">
<text>Auguste Joseph Alphonse Gratry (usually known as &quot;Joseph Gratry&quot;; 10 March 1805 − 6 February 1872) was a French Catholic priest, author and theologian.

==Biography ==
Gratry was born at Lille and educated at the École Polytechnique of Paris. In 1828, he went on to study theology at seminary in Strasbourg under the tutelage of the abbé Bautain. After a period of mental struggle which he has described in &quot;Souvenirs de ma jeunesse&quot;, he was ordained a priest in Strasbourg in 1832. After a stay there as professor of the Petit Séminaire, he was appointed director of the Collège Stanislas in Paris in 1842 and, in 1847, chaplain of the École Normale Supérieure. He was awarded the Order of the Legion of Honor in 1845.

In 1852 he and Abbé Pierre Pététot revived Bérulle&#x27;s Congregation of the Oratory. Gratry was a brilliant academic, holding doctorates in both the humanities and theology. He envisioned communities which could be schools of theological exploration, working with the scientific focus of modern society.

He became vicar-general for the bishop of Orleans in 1861, professor of moral theology at the Sorbonne in 1863, and, on the death of Barante, a member of the Académie française in 1867, where he occupied the seat formerly held by Voltaire.

Together with Abbé Philippe Pététot, pastor of Saint Roch, and Hyacinthe de Valroger, Joseph Gratry reconstituted the French Oratory, a society of priests mainly dedicated to education.

=== Death ===
Gratry developed throat cancer at the end of his life and went to Montreux, Switzerland, for treatment, where he died. He was buried in Montparnasse Cemetery in Paris by his sister.

<text>Tolo Harbour (), or Tai Po Hoi (, historically ), is a sheltered harbour in northeast New Territories of Hong Kong.

==Geography==
Tide Cove, also known as Sha Tin Hoi, is to the south of the harbour, and Plover Cove, Three Fathoms Cove and Tolo Channel are to its east.

The Shing Mun River empties first into Tide Cove, then the harbour.

Several islands are located in the harbour, including Ma Shi Chau, Centre Island, Yeung Chau and Yim Tin Tsai. Yuen Chau Tsai is a former island, now connected to the mainland by a causeway.

==History==
In the past pearls were very abundant here. Pearl hunting had been a major industry in Tai Po from the Han dynasty. In the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, a king of Southern Han changed the name of Tai Po to Mei Chuen To () and ordered an aggressive cultivation effort, which led to many fatalities amongst the pearl hunters. The hunting lasted until the Ming dynasty, when the pearl oysters were nearly extinct in the area.

==Transportation==
Kowloon–Canton Railway was built in 1910s and Tolo Highway in 1980s on its western shore.

Kaito Ferry Services across Tolo Harbour are available:

* Tai Shui Hang – Ma Liu Shui/Tai Mei Tuk
* Ma Liu Shui – Lai Chi Wo
* Ma Liu Shui – Kat O/Ap Chau
* Ma Liu Shui – Tap Mun
* Ma Liu Shui – Tung Ping Chau

<doc id="1295901" wikidata="Q437993" url="?curid=1295901" title="Neil Lennon">
<text>Neil Francis Lennon (born 25 June 1971) is a Northern Irish professional football manager and former player, who was most recently the head coach of Liga I club Rapid București.

During his playing career he represented English clubs Manchester City, Crewe Alexandra and Leicester City. Lennon moved to Celtic in 2000, where he made over 200 appearances and was appointed captain in 2005. Before retiring as a player, he returned to England and played for Nottingham Forest and Wycombe Wanderers. Lennon also earned 40 caps for the Northern Ireland national team over nine years, scoring two goals.

Lennon was appointed manager of former club Celtic in March 2010, initially in a caretaker capacity, following the departure of Tony Mowbray. Lennon enjoyed significant success as Celtic manager, winning three Scottish league championships, two Scottish Cups, qualifying for the group stage of the Champions League twice and the knockout stages once, before leaving the club in May 2014. After an unsuccessful spell back in England with Bolton Wanderers, marred by the club&#x27;s financial problems, Lennon returned to Scottish football in 2016 with Hibernian. He led them to promotion back to the Scottish Premiership in his first season as head coach, and European qualification in his second season, before leaving Hibernian in January 2019.

Lennon returned to Celtic in February 2019, initially on an interim basis for the rest of the 2018–19 season, and guided them to the league and Scottish Cup titles. His contract was renewed and he led Celtic to the Scottish league title again in 2019–20. He also led the team to a fourth consecutive domestic treble by also winning the League Cup and the Scottish Cup that season. Lennon left Celtic in February 2021, as the club had fallen far behind Rangers in the 2020–21 Scottish Premiership.

Lennon returned to football a year later, becoming the new manager of Cypriot club Omonia in March 2022. Less than three months after arriving on the island, he led the club to win the Cypriot Cup, their first since 2012. He was sacked in October 2022 due to disappointing results in the domestic league.

==Early life==
Lennon was born in Lurgan, County Armagh and attended St Michael&#x27;s Grammar School in the town. As a youngster he played gaelic football for the school and was also selected for the Armagh minor team. He grew up supporting Celtic and played football for the local Lurgan Celtic youth team.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Lennon joined Glenavon, after reaching the final of the Milk Cup with Glenavon Select and scored on his Irish League debut. He then joined Manchester City as a trainee in 1987. He made one first team appearance during his time in Manchester, a league match on 30 April 1988 away against Birmingham City, before signing for Crewe Alexandra on a free transfer in August 1990. Lennon made his debut for Crewe on 18 September 1990 against Reading. Despite missing the whole of season 1991–92 due to a back injury, he became an established member of the side and impressed with his intelligent play and consistent performances. Lennon&#x27;s form saw him make his debut for Northern Ireland in 1994, and thus became the first Crewe Alexandra player in 60 years to win a full international cap. In years at Crewe, Lennon made 187 appearances for the club and scored 18 goals.

===Leicester City===
In February 1996, Lennon signed for Leicester City for a fee of £750,000 (£ today). In May 1996, Lennon played in the Leicester City side that defeated Crystal Palace 2–1 at Wembley in the Play-off Final to win promotion to the Premier League. On 16 April 1997, Lennon picked up his first major winner&#x27;s medal when Leicester won 1–0 against Middlesbrough in a replayed League Cup Final. He played in a further two League Cup Finals during his time at Filbert Street, losing 1-0 to Tottenham Hotspur in March 1999 but winning 2–1 against Tranmere Rovers in February 2000.

An on-field incident during a league match in 1998 against Newcastle United between Lennon and Alan Shearer resulted in the England international being charged with misconduct by the FA, Television footage showed Shearer appearing to intentionally kick Lennon in the head following a challenge. The referee of the game took no action against Shearer. Shearer apologised afterwards, but denied that the contact with Lennon was deliberate, and Lennon later gave evidence in Shearer&#x27;s defence at the FA hearing which subsequently cleared the Newcastle and England striker of all charges.

===Celtic===
After Martin O&#x27;Neill became the new manager of Celtic in June 2000, he made several attempts to sign Lennon. After months of protracted negotiations with Leicester, on 6 December Lennon joined the club he supported as a boy for a fee of £5.75 million. That season saw Lennon pick-up three winner&#x27;s medals as Celtic won a domestic treble; the Scottish Premier League, Scottish Cup and Scottish League Cup. The next four seasons at Celtic saw Lennon win a further two league championships and two Scottish Cups. He was also an integral part of the Celtic side that reached the UEFA Cup Final in 2003, losing 3-2 to Porto after extra time.

When Gordon Strachan took over from O&#x27;Neill as manager in the summer of 2005, he made Lennon the new club captain. In January 2006, when Leicester sacked Craig Levein, Lennon was linked with a return to the Midlands side in a player-manager role. He went on record saying he was flattered but wanted to captain Celtic to the Scottish Premier League title.

Although he was also linked with a move to Crystal Palace in a player-manager role in the summer of 2006, on 23 June 2006, Celtic announced he had signed a new one-year contract. Sunderland manager Roy Keane made an attempt to sign Lennon prior to the closure of the August 2006 transfer window, but his approach for the player was rejected by Celtic. On 25 April 2007, Lennon announced he would be leaving Celtic, and in his last game for the club on 26 May 2007, he captained the team to victory in the Scottish Cup Final against Dunfermline Athletic. Celtic&#x27;s 1–0 win clinched the League and Cup Double.

===Later career===
Lennon joined League One club Nottingham Forest on a one-year contract with an option for a second year on 12 June 2007. He made his debut captaining the side in a 0–0 draw at home to AFC Bournemouth. He missed a week&#x27;s training with Forest in November 2007, because of family reasons in Scotland, and lost his place in the team as a consequence.

Lennon joined Wycombe Wanderers of League Two on a free transfer on 31 January 2008, managed by his former Celtic midfield partner Paul Lambert. He left on 3 April to take up a coaching role with Celtic.

==International career==
Lennon made his international debut for Northern Ireland on 11 June 1994 when he come on as a substitute in a friendly against Mexico in Miami. He had to wait nearly a year for his next cap when he played against Chile in another friendly. Lennon made his first competitive appearance three months later on 3 September 1995 in a European Championship qualifier away against Portugal. After that, Lennon became a fixture in the international side although Northern Ireland were unsuccessful in their attempts to qualify for the finals of major tournaments.

Lennon decided to retire from international football in August 2002 upon receiving a death threat before a Northern Ireland match against Cyprus. The threats came after his alleged claim that he wanted to play for a team representing a United Ireland. The threat was allegedly made by the Loyalist Volunteer Force, although the organisation later denied this.

Lennon was capped 40 times by Northern Ireland, scoring two goals. He also captained the team on several occasions.

==Managerial career==
Lennon was linked with the vacant manager&#x27;s job at Hibernian after the resignation of John Collins, but the job was given to Mixu Paatelainen. Lennon&#x27;s first coaching appointment was as first team coach with Celtic in 2008. After the appointment of Tony Mowbray as Celtic manager, Lennon took charge of the Celtic reserve team.

Celtic won the Jock Stein Friendship Cup match on penalties in his first match. With no reserve league, the team played a series of friendlies in Ireland against the first teams of Cork City, Drogheda United, Shamrock Rovers, and Cliftonville, losing only once. They played several times in England against Blackburn Rovers, Everton, Chelsea, Huddersfield Town, Newcastle United
and Sunderland.

===Celtic===
Following Mowbray&#x27;s departure from Celtic on 25 March 2010, Lennon was appointed caretaker manager for the remainder of the 2009–10 season. He appointed former teammate Johan Mjällby as his assistant. Celtic won all of their remaining league games under Lennon, including wins over Kilmarnock, Hibernian, and Rangers, but lost 2–0 to First Division side Ross County in the semi-final of the Scottish Cup. In the aftermath of that defeat, Lennon spoke frankly about the Celtic players and their performances over the course of the season. He said that they had lacked &quot;hunger and desire&quot; and that whether he was installed as manager or not, he would be recommending a significant clear-out of players to the board.

Lennon was appointed manager of Celtic on a full-time basis on 9 June 2010. He retained Mjällby as his assistant, as well as former Celtic teammate Alan Thompson and former Leicester City teammate Garry Parker as first-team coaches

He made considerable changes to the Celtic team for the 2010–11 season. He sold Aiden McGeady for a then Scottish record £9.5 million along with captain Stephen McManus and goalkeeper Artur Boruc. 13 other players also left the club, this gave Lennon enough funds to re-build for the new season. Lennon then went on to sign several talented, young, cheap, relatively unknown players, from smaller leagues around the world; striker Gary Hooper arrived from English side Scunthorpe, Israeli international Beram Kayal was signed, and Honduran left-back Emilio Izaguirre also signed on. Lennon also signed several experienced players on free transfers. Charlie Mulgrew, Joe Ledley, and Daniel Majstorović all went into the first team. In addition to these Lennon also signed five other players, including Fraser Forster on loan from Newcastle who became first choice &#x27;keeper and helped set a new SPL record for most clean sheets. 

On 28 July, in his first competitive game as full-time manager, Celtic lost 3–0 away to Braga in the UEFA Champions League. Celtic won their first eight league matches under Lennon, although controversy erupted in their 2–1 win away at Dundee United on 17 October 2010. Celtic were awarded a penalty kick in the second half, but the decision was then rescinded by referee Dougie McDonald. McDonald explained after the match that he over-ruled the penalty award on the advice of the assistant referee. Lennon reluctantly accepted McDonald&#x27;s explanation, commenting &quot;I suppose you have to put it down to another honest mistake by the referee.&quot; It was, however, later revealed that McDonald had lied in his explanation over the penalty award and the referee subsequently resigned several weeks later having received a warning from the Scottish Football Association after failing to properly explain his overturning of the penalty award. Further refereeing controversy ensued the following week when Celtic lost their unbeaten run in the league, losing 3–1 at home against Rangers. The Ibrox club&#x27;s third goal came as a result of penalty awarded when Rangers&#x27; Kirk Broadfoot fell to the ground under a challenge from Celtic&#x27;s Daniel Majstorović. Lennon stated afterwards that he felt the referee &quot;got a couple of decisions wrong&quot;, and added regarding the penalty, &quot;I&#x27;m not sure that he saw it so I don&#x27;t know why he&#x27;s given it. He&#x27;s got a lot of questions to answer&quot;. In November, Lennon led Celtic to a 9–0 win over Aberdeen, a record win in the Scottish Premier League and Aberdeen&#x27;s heaviest ever defeat. Celtic lost their next game 2–0 away against Hearts, with Celtic&#x27;s Joe Ledley sent off for the first time in his career for a &quot;strong&quot; challenge on Ian Black. Celtic were later denied a penalty award in the second half, and shortly afterwards Lennon was sent to the stand by the referee. Lennon defended Ledley after the match, describing referee Craig Thomson&#x27;s decision as &quot;ridiculous&quot;. Lennon was later given a six match touchline ban for excessive misconduct as a result of the incident in the Hearts&#x27; game, although it was later reduced to four matches after appeal. He was given another four match touchline ban by the SFA following an altercation with Rangers assistant manager Ally McCoist after a Scottish Cup match in March 2011.

Lennon led Celtic to the final of the League Cup in March 2011, but they lost 2–1 to Rangers after extra time. They remained in contention for the SPL title until the final day of the 2010–11 season, when they won 4–0 at home to Motherwell, but finished a point behind Rangers. He won his first silverware as a manager when Celtic beat Motherwell 3–0 in the Scottish Cup Final a week later.

After rallying from a poor start to season 2011–12, Lennon won the SPL Manager of the Month award for November 2011. The club went on to win the 2011–12 Scottish Premier League and Lennon was made SFWA Manager of the Year. Lennon then guided Celtic through two qualification rounds to reach the group stage of the 2012–13 UEFA Champions League, where Celtic beat Barcelona one day after the club&#x27;s 125th birthday. Celtic qualified out of their group to the knock-out stages of the Champions League. Celtic were comfortably beaten on aggregate by Juventus in the last 16 round, but both Celtic and Lennon were still praised for their overall Champions League campaign. On 21 April 2013, Celtic retained the Premier League title. Lennon finished the season by leading Celtic to a League and Cup double with a 3–0 win over Hibernian in the Scottish Cup Final.

Celtic qualified for the group stages of the Champions League again the following season, but had a dismal campaign; winning only once with a 2–1 home win over Ajax, and slumping to a 6–1 rout away against Barcelona in the final group match. They fared little better in the domestic cup competitions; losing 1-0 to Morton in their first game in the Scottish League Cup, and losing 2-1 to Aberdeen in the fourth round of the Scottish Cup. The League campaign was much more impressive through; undefeated until February and losing only twice in all over the course of the season in which they scored 102 goals on the way to their third successive League title. On 22 May 2014, Lennon announced that he was leaving Celtic after four years as manager. &quot;I have parted company with Celtic,&quot; he said in a brief statement, adding &quot;The club are in a very strong position and I wish the fans and the club all the very best for the future.&quot;

Lennon was announced as the new manager of Bolton Wanderers on 12 October 2014, signing a four-year contract. He won his first game in charge 1–0 against Birmingham City at St Andrew&#x27;s stadium, although he was sent to the stands in the 81st minute after an altercation with referee Mark Haywood caused by Lennon leaving his technical area before Craig Davies&#x27;s penalty was saved. Lennon&#x27;s first three months in charge saw Bolton rise ten places from bottom of the league up to fourteenth; a spell that included an eight match unbeaten run and four consecutive clean sheets. Bolton reached the fourth round of the FA Cup and took Liverpool to a replay before conceding a last minute goal to lose 2–1 and go out. Things didn&#x27;t go well for Lennon thereafter, with Bolton winning only one of their last 11 games of the season, and Barry Bannan and Neil Danns being suspended by Lennon for off-field indiscipline. Bolton did however succeed in avoiding relegation, finishing 18th in the league.

Bolton struggled at the start of the following season, and by October 2015 were lying bottom of the table with only one win in their first eleven league games. Lennon maintained confidence in his ability to improve Bolton&#x27;s fortunes, stating &quot;I didn&#x27;t realise quite how tough it was going to be but I have got faith in my own ability and I believe we&#x27;ll turn things around.&quot; By the end of November 2015, Bolton had gone on a run of twelve games without a win, and remained bottom of the Championship. At this time, the club announced that their squad had not been paid this month &quot;due to a short-term funding issue&quot; in a statement which came hours before their 1–1 draw with Brentford. In that game, Bolton striker Gary Madine was seen on television mouthing an insult towards Lennon, although the manager played down the incident afterwards, stating &quot;I don&#x27;t know what he said. He&#x27;s a Geordie, I can&#x27;t understand him! It was probably reciprocated!&quot; Bolton continued to struggle and, with the club at the bottom of the table, Lennon left by &quot;mutual consent&quot; on 15 March 2016.

===Hibernian===
Lennon was appointed head coach of Scottish Championship club Hibernian in June 2016. He led the &quot;Hibees&quot; to the Scottish Championship title and promotion back to the Scottish Premiership (after a three-season absence) in his first season. In September 2017, Lennon and Hibs agreed to extend his contract to the end of the 2019–20 season. Hibs finished fourth in the 2017–18 Scottish Premiership and qualified for the Europa League.

On 25 January 2019, Lennon was suspended by Hibernian following an exchange with other club employees. On 30 January, it was announced that he and assistant coach Garry Parker had left the club by mutual consent. A club statement said that &quot;neither Neil nor Garry has been guilty of any misconduct or wrongdoing and no disciplinary process has been commenced. The suspension, put in place to allow an internal review, was lifted by the club as part of this agreement.&quot;

===Return to Celtic===
On 26 February 2019, Lennon was appointed manager of Celtic for a second time, taking over until the end of the campaign following Brendan Rodgers&#x27; mid-season departure for Leicester City. Having helped the club achieve an unprecedented third domestic treble (&quot;treble treble&quot;), Lennon was appointed permanent manager for a second time at the end of the season. The 2019–20 season saw very similar success, even following the suspension of professional football as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The season was later curtailed and the title awarded to Celtic, who were thirteen points clear at the time of suspension, equalling the national record of nine consecutive championships set by Celtic in the 1970s and matched by Rangers in the 1990s. In addition to the league, they were once again victorious in the League and Scottish cups, giving the club their fourth consecutive domestic treble.

Following a positive start to the 2020–21 campaign, Lennon came under significant criticism after the club underwent a poor run of results that began with a 2–0 Old Firm home loss to Rangers on 17 October; this was followed by failure to qualify for the Champions League group stage, elimination from the Europa League in the group stage and elimination from the League Cup in the second round, ending the possibility of a fifth consecutive treble. As calls were made for Lennon to be sacked and fans began to protest outside Celtic Park following their elimination from the League Cup, the board of directors released a statement on 7 December in which they voiced full support of Lennon and his back room staff. After a brief turnaround in results, Celtic lost the second Old Firm game of the season on 2 January, and calls were once again made for Lennon to be removed from his position as hopes of a historic tenth title faded.

Lennon was also criticised for taking the squad on a training trip to Dubai in January, during which two players contracted COVID-19; health protocols meant that 13 players and three coaches, including Lennon, had to be quarantined for 10 days after they returned. They consequently missed league matches with Hibernian and Livingston, both of which were drawn. There were more fan protests after a home defeat by St Mirren, the first time the Paisley club had won at Celtic Park since 1990. Despite previously stating that he would not resign, Lennon left the club on 24 February 2021 following a 1–0 defeat to Ross County, which left Celtic 18 points behind Rangers in the title race.

=== Omonia ===
On 8 March 2022, Lennon was appointed head coach of Cypriot First Division side Omonia on a two-and-a-half-year deal, replacing former Rangers defender Henning Berg. On 25 May, Lennon led the club to their first trophy under his leadership, as they defeated Ethnikos Achna on penalties to win the Cypriot Cup; during extra time, Lennon received a red card and was ordered to leave the touchline by the referee.

Ahead of the 2022–23 season, Lennon recruited players who he had managed at former clubs, including Adam Matthews and Gary Hooper, whom he had managed at Celtic, and Brandon Barker, whom he had managed at Hibernian. After defeat in the Cypriot Super Cup to Apollon Limassol, Lennon&#x27;s Omonia team shocked Belgian side Gent 4–0 on aggregate to qualify for the UEFA Europa League group stage. Despite respectable showings against Manchester United and Real Sociedad in the group stage, Lennon was sacked on 18 October 2022 due to disappointing results in the domestic league, including losses to newly-promoted sides Akritas Chlorakas and Nea Salamis.

===Rapid București===
On 20 May 2024, Lennon was officially presented as the manager of Liga I club Rapid București, joining the Romanian side on a two-year deal. On 20 August 2024, just after signing twelve players and recording no wins in six matches, Lennon was sacked after three months in charge. 

==Personal life==
Lennon has spoken about having suffered from depression since 2000.

In January 2011, Lennon reached an out of court settlement with the Bank of Ireland after a company of which he was a director defaulted on a €3.7 million loan.

While a young player at Crewe, Lennon was a friend of Andy Woodward and Steve Walters, both of whom were victims of sexual abuse by coach Barry Bennell. After Bennell&#x27;s 2018 conviction, Lennon spoke of his regret at not being aware of the abuse at the time.

He is a supporter of his home-town team Lurgan Celtic.

<text>Gravamen (from Latin &quot;gravare&quot;, to weigh down; &quot;gravis&quot;, heavy), (plural gra·va·mens or gra·vam·i·na) is a complaint or grievance, the ground of a legal action, and particularly the more serious part of a charge against an accused person. In legal terms, it is the essential element of a lawsuit.

In English the term is used chiefly in legal submissions and judicial opinions. The word is commonly misspelled &quot;&quot;.

Apart from the normal usage of the word, the gravamen test is used in contract law to distinguish between the sale of goods and services in &quot;hybrid&quot; transactions. Under the test each component of the sale is isolated and individually determined to be either a good or a service. The more common approach used by courts is the predominant purpose test which looks at the general thrust of the exchange rather than each individual component.

The term is also used in ecclesiastical courts, being the technical designation of a memorial presented from the Lower to the Upper House of Convocation, setting forth grievances to be redressed, or calling attention to breaches in church discipline.

<text>Dysthymia ( ), also known as persistent depressive disorder (PDD), is a mental and behavioral disorder, specifically a disorder primarily of mood, consisting of similar cognitive and physical problems as major depressive disorder, but with longer-lasting symptoms. The concept was used by Robert Spitzer as a replacement for the term &quot;depressive personality&quot; in the late 1970s.

The &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (DSM-5) indicates that persistent depressive disorder— the new name for what was called &quot;dysthymic disorder&quot; in DSM-IV—is a serious state of chronic depression, which persists for at least two years (one year for children and adolescents). Dysthymia causes substantial distress and functional impairment—not as much as major depressive disorder, but close.

As dysthymia is a chronic disorder, those with the condition may experience symptoms for many years before it is diagnosed, if diagnosis occurs at all. As a result, they may believe that depression is a part of their character, so they may not even discuss their symptoms with doctors, family members or friends. In terms of official diagnostic entities, DSM-5 removed dysthymic disorder (DSM-IV), and introduced a new psychiatric construct: persistent depressive disorder. The DSM-5 authors explained that this new disorder subsumes the DSM-IV diagnoses of chronic major depressive disorder and dysthymic disorder. This change arose from research showing no evidence for meaningful differences between chronic major depressive disorder and dysthymic disorder.

==Signs and symptoms==
Dysthymia characteristics include an extended period of depressed mood combined with at least two other symptoms which may include insomnia or hypersomnia, fatigue or low energy, eating changes (more or less), low self-esteem, or feelings of hopelessness. Poor concentration or difficulty making decisions are treated as another possible symptom. Irritability is one of the more common symptoms in children and adolescents.

Mild degrees of dysthymia may result in people withdrawing from stress and avoiding opportunities for failure. In more severe cases of dysthymia, people may withdraw from daily activities. They will usually find little pleasure in usual activities and pastimes.

Diagnosis of dysthymia can be difficult because of the subtle nature of the symptoms and patients can often hide them in social situations, making it challenging for others to detect symptoms. Additionally, dysthymia often occurs at the same time as other psychological disorders, which adds a level of complexity in determining the presence of dysthymia, particularly because there is often an overlap in the symptoms of disorders.

There is a high incidence of comorbid illness in those with dysthymia. Suicidal behavior is also a particular problem with those with dysthymia. It is vital to look for signs of major depression, panic disorder, generalised anxiety disorder, alcohol and substance use disorders, and personality disorder.

==Causes==
There are no known biological causes that apply consistently to all cases of dysthymia, which suggests diverse origin of the disorder. However, there are some indications that there is a genetic predisposition to dysthymia: &quot;The rate of depression in the families of people with dysthymia is as high as fifty percent for the early-onset form of the disorder&quot;. Other factors linked with dysthymia include stress, social isolation, and lack of social support.

In a study using identical and fraternal twins, results indicated that there is a stronger likelihood of identical twins both having depression than fraternal twins. This provides support for the idea that dysthymia is in part hereditary.

===Co-occurring conditions===
Dysthymia often co-occurs with other mental disorders. A &quot;double depression&quot; is the occurrence of episodes of major depression in addition to dysthymia. Switching between periods of dysthymic moods and periods of hypomanic moods is indicative of cyclothymia, which is a mild variant of bipolar disorder.

&quot;At least three-quarters of patients with dysthymia also have a chronic physical illness or another psychiatric disorder such as one of the anxiety disorders, cyclothymia, drug addiction, or alcoholism&quot;. Common co-occurring conditions include major depression (up to 75%), anxiety disorders (up to 50%), personality disorders (up to 40%), somatoform disorders (up to 45%) and substance use disorders (up to 50%). People with dysthymia have a higher-than-average chance of developing major depression. A 10-year follow-up study found that 95% of dysthymia patients had an episode of major depression. When an intense episode of depression occurs on top of dysthymia, the state is called &quot;double depression.&quot;

====Double depression==== 

Double depression occurs when a person experiences a major depressive episode on top of the already-existing condition of dysthymia. It is difficult to treat, as patients accept these major depressive symptoms as a natural part of their personality or as a part of their life that is outside of their control. The fact that people with dysthymia may accept these worsening symptoms as inevitable can delay treatment. When and if such people seek out treatment, the treatment may not be very effective if only the symptoms of the major depression are addressed, but not the dysthymic symptoms. 

Patients with double depression tend to report significantly higher levels of hopelessness than is normal. This can be a useful symptom for mental health services providers to focus on when working with patients to treat the condition. Additionally, cognitive therapies can be effective for working with people with double depression in order to help change negative thinking patterns and give individuals a new way of seeing themselves and their environment.

It has been suggested that the best way to prevent double depression is by treating the dysthymia. A combination of antidepressants and cognitive therapies can be helpful in preventing major depressive symptoms from occurring. Additionally, exercise and good sleep hygiene (e.g., improving sleep patterns) are thought to have an additive effect on treating dysthymic symptoms and preventing them from worsening.

==Pathophysiology==
There is evidence that there may be neurological indicators of early onset dysthymia. There are several brain structures (corpus callosum and frontal lobe) that are different in women with dysthymia than in those without dysthymia. This may indicate that there is a developmental difference between these two groups.

Another study, which used fMRI techniques to assess the differences between individuals with dysthymia and other people, found additional support for neurological indicators of the disorder. This study found several areas of the brain that function differently. The amygdala (associated with processing emotions such as fear) was more activated in dysthymia patients. The study also observed increased activity in the insula (which is associated with sad emotions). Finally, there was increased activity in the cingulate gyrus (which serves as the bridge between attention and emotion).

A study comparing healthy individuals to people with dysthymia indicates there are other biological indicators of the disorder. An anticipated result appeared as healthy individuals expected fewer negative adjectives to apply to them, whereas people with dysthymia expected fewer positive adjectives to apply to them in the future. Biologically these groups are also differentiated in that healthy individuals showed greater neurological anticipation for all types of events (positive, neutral, or negative) than those with dysthymia. This provides neurological evidence of the dulling of emotion that individuals with dysthymia have learned to use to protect themselves from overly strong negative feelings, compared to healthy people.

There is some evidence of a genetic basis for all types of depression, including dysthymia. A study using identical and fraternal twins indicated that there is a stronger likelihood of identical twins both having depression than fraternal twins. This provides support for the idea that dysthymia is caused in part by heredity.

A new model has recently surfaced in the literature regarding the HPA axis (structures in the brain that get activated in response to stress) and its involvement with dysthymia (e.g. phenotypic variations of corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) and arginine vasopressin (AVP), and down-regulation of adrenal functioning) as well as forebrain serotonergic mechanisms. Since this model is highly provisional, further research is still needed.

==Diagnosis==
The &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV&quot; (DSM-IV), published by the American Psychiatric Association, characterizes dysthymic disorder. The essential symptom involves the individual feeling depressed for the majority of days, and parts of the day, for at least two years. Low energy, disturbances in sleep or in appetite, and low self-esteem typically contribute to the clinical picture as well. Those with the condition have often experienced dysthymia for many years before it is diagnosed. People around them often describe them in words similar to &quot;just a moody person&quot;. The following are the diagnostic criteria:

* During a majority of days for two years or more, the adult patient reports depressed mood, or appears depressed to others for most of the day.
* When depressed, the patient has two or more of:
** decreased or increased appetite;
** decreased or increased sleep (insomnia or hypersomnia);
** fatigue or low energy;
** reduced self-esteem;
** decreased concentration or problems making decisions;
** feelings of hopelessness or pessimism.
* During this two-year period, the above symptoms are never absent longer than two consecutive months.
* During the duration of the two-year period, the patient may have had a perpetual major depressive episode.
* The patient has not had any manic, hypomanic, or mixed episodes.
* The patient has never fulfilled criteria for cyclothymic disorder.
* The depression does not exist only as part of a chronic psychosis (such as schizophrenia or delusional disorder).
* The symptoms are often not directly caused by a medical illness or by substances, including substance use or other medications.
* The symptoms may cause significant problems or distress in social, work, academic, or other major areas of life functioning.

In children and adolescents, mood can be irritable, and duration must be at least one year, in contrast to two years needed for diagnosis in adults.

Early onset (diagnosis before age 21) is associated with more frequent relapses, psychiatric hospitalizations, and more co-occurring conditions. For younger adults with dysthymia, there is a higher co-occurrence in personality abnormalities and the symptoms are likely chronic. However, in older adults with dysthymia, the psychological symptoms are associated with medical conditions and/or stressful life events and losses.

Dysthymia can be contrasted with major depressive disorder by assessing the acute nature of the symptoms. Dysthymia is far more chronic (long lasting) than major depressive disorder, in which symptoms may be present for as little as two weeks. Also dysthymia often presents itself at an earlier age than major depressive disorder.

==Prevention==
Though there is no clear-cut way to prevent dysthymia from occurring, there are some suggestions to help reduce its effects. Since dysthymia often appears first in childhood, it is important to identify children who may be at risk. It may be beneficial to work with children in helping to control their stress, increase resilience, boost self-esteem, and provide strong social support networks. These tactics may be helpful in warding off or delaying dysthymic symptoms.

==Treatments==
Persistent depressive disorder can be treated with psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. The overall rate and degree of treatment success is somewhat lower than for non-chronic depression, and a combination of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy shows best results.

===Therapy===

Psychotherapy can be effective in treating dysthymia.
In a meta-analytic study from 2010, psychotherapy had a small but significant effect when compared to control groups. However, psychotherapy is significantly less effective than pharmacotherapy in direct comparisons.

There are many different types of therapy, and some are more effective than others.

* The empirically most studied type of treatment is cognitive-behavioral therapy. This type of therapy is very effective for non-chronic depression, and it appears to be also effective for chronic depression.
* Cognitive behavioral analysis system of psychotherapy (CBASP) has been designed specifically to treat PDD. Empirical results on this form of therapy are inconclusive: While one study showed remarkably high treatment success rates, a later, even larger study showed no significant benefit of adding CBASP to treatment with antidepressants.
* Schema therapy and psychodynamic psychotherapy have been used for PDD, though good empirical results are lacking.
* Interpersonal psychotherapy has also been said to be effective in treating the disorder, though it only shows marginal benefit when added to treatment with antidepressants.

=== Medications ===

In a 2010 meta-analysis, the benefit of pharmacotherapy was limited to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) rather than tricyclic antidepressants (TCA).

According to a 2014 meta-analysis, antidepressants are at least as effective for persistent depressive disorder as for major depressive disorder.
The first line of pharmacotherapy is usually SSRIs due to their purported more tolerable nature and reduced side effects compared to the irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants. Studies have found that the mean response to antidepressant medications for people with dysthymia is 55%, compared with a 31% response rate to a placebo. The most commonly prescribed antidepressants/SSRIs for dysthymia are escitalopram, citalopram, sertraline, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and fluvoxamine. It often takes an average of 6–8 weeks before the patient begins to feel these medications&#x27; therapeutic effects. Additionally, STAR*D, a multi-clinic governmental study, found that people with overall depression will generally need to try different brands of medication before finding one that works specifically for them. Research shows that 1 in 4 of those who switch medications get better results regardless of whether the second medication is an SSRI or some other type of antidepressant.

In a meta-analytic study from 2005, it was found that SSRIs and TCAs are equally effective in treating dysthymia. They also found that MAOIs have a slight advantage over the use of other medication in treating this disorder. However, the author of this study cautions that MAOIs should not necessarily be the first line of defense in the treatment of dysthymia, as they are often less tolerable than their counterparts, such as SSRIs.

Tentative evidence supports the use of amisulpride to treat dysthymia but with increased side effects.

===Combination treatment===
When pharmacotherapy alone is compared with combined treatment with pharmacotherapy plus psychotherapy, there is a strong trend in favour of combined treatment. Working with a psychotherapist to address the causes and effects of the disorder, in addition to taking antidepressants to help eliminate the symptoms, can be extremely beneficial. This combination is often the preferred method of treatment for those who have dysthymia. Looking at various studies involving treatment for dysthymia, 75% of people responded positively to a combination of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and pharmacotherapy, whereas only 48% of people responded positively to just CBT or medication alone.

A 2019 Cochrane review of 10 studies involving 840 participants could not conclude with certainty that continued pharmacotherapy with antidepressants (those used in the studies) was effective in preventing relapse or recurrence of persistent depressive disorder. The body of evidence was too small for any greater certainty although the study acknowledges that continued psychotherapy may be beneficial when compared to no treatment.

===Treatment resistance===
Because of dysthymia&#x27;s chronic nature, treatment resistance is somewhat common. In such a case, augmentation is often recommended. Such treatment augmentations can include lithium pharmacology, thyroid hormone augmentation, amisulpride, buspirone, bupropion, guanfacine, stimulants, and mirtazapine. Additionally, if the person also has seasonal affective disorder, light therapy can be useful in helping augment therapeutic effects.

==Epidemiology==
Globally, the one-year incidence is about 105 million people (1.53% of the global population). , research suggests incidence rates of 1.8% for women and 1.3% for men. In the U.S. general population, research suggests a lifetime prevalence rate of 3 to 6 percent. In primary care settings the lifetime prevalence rate is 5 to 15 percent.

<text>John Purdue (; October 31, 1802 – September 12, 1876) was a wealthy American industrialist in Lafayette, Indiana, and the primary original benefactor of Purdue University.

==Early life==
Most details of Purdue&#x27;s early life were either not recorded or lost.

He was born in Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania, to Charles and Mary Short Purdue. He had eight sisters and no brothers. Sometime after 1813 (possibly as late as 1823), the family moved to Ross County, Ohio. During the move, the second oldest daughter, Nancy, died, and shortly after the move, his father died. Shortly thereafter John was apprenticed to an Adelphi merchant, and his mother and at least a few of his sisters moved north and settled near Westerville, Ohio.

==Teacher==
From 1823 to 1831, he was a school teacher around Ohio and in Michigan.

==Businessman==
As stated in the &quot;1979 Marion County History Book&quot;, on March 13, 1831, he bought a farm in Salt Rock Township in Marion County, Ohio. He sold the same on August 20, 1832, at a profit. He derived additional gain from collecting a commission in taking his neighbor&#x27;s hogs to market.

Purdue developed a farm products brokerage that covered the Adelphi, Worthington and Columbus area. In 1833, he and Moses Fowler opened a general merchandise store in Adelphi. On December 9, 1834, Purdue purchased of land in Indiana from Jesse Spencer for $850 which he partially paid for in store goods. The land that he bought lies northeast of the intersection of Creasy Lane and McCarty Lane in Lafayette, Indiana.

In 1838 or 1839, Purdue and Fowler liquidated their Ohio holdings and permanently moved to Lafayette. Once there, they opened a dry goods business on the courthouse square. Purdue continued to gain wealth and prestige over the next several years. Most accounts show a man devoted to leading a good civic life, donating time, money, and expertise to various local projects including a bridge over the Wabash River, a railroad from Lafayette to Indianapolis and serving on various boards.

In 1844, Fowler and Purdue ended their association. In 1847, a group of five merchants, including Purdue, completed a wooden toll bridge across the Wabash.

On October 20, 1852, Purdue and four others were appointed as the first trustees of the new Lafayette City Public School. While various tax-related lawsuits crippled the new statewide public school budget, Purdue and others privately helped keep Lafayette&#x27;s afloat.

By 1855, Purdue was spending a fair amount of time in New York doing business. In 1856, he became involved in what would come to be Purdue, Ward and Company.

In 1857, he bought stock in and served as a trustee of the Battle Ground Collegiate Institute (college preparatory classes). He also donated $500 in cash to help another collegiate institute in the newly-platted Stockwell, Indiana.

Purdue profited greatly during the American Civil War mainly because of the increase in demand for dry goods by the Union Army. Purdue supported the Union in the war, but some night-time raids by Confederate sympathizers on local businesses were reported. To protect his assets, Purdue established the &quot;Purdue Rifles,&quot; a volunteer protective force of about 100 trained, uniformed and armed men guarding Confederate prisoners, rounded up deserters and maintained order.

Throughout the 1860s, Purdue acquired large tracts of land in nearby Warren County. By 1872, he owned about which came to be known as the Walnut Grove Farm.

In 1867, Purdue invested money in and presided as president of the Lafayette Agricultural Works, a Lafayette implement factory, until the mid-1870s.

In 1868, he contributed money to and was the president for seven years of the new Springvale Cemetery in Lafayette.

In 1869, he helped found the Lafayette Savings Bank.

He later supported some questionable business ventures, including backing the Lafayette, Muncie and Bloomington Railroad, even as lawsuits and debts climbed. Purdue also backed a silver mining scheme in Colorado, the Purdue Gold and Silver Mining and Ore Reduction Company, which failed to pay any dividends.

==Politician==
In 1864, Purdue lost a contentious primary battle to incumbent Godlove Stein Orth for the nomination of the Union Party&#x27;s candidate for Congress.

In 1866, Purdue again challenged Orth but this time in the general election as an Independent. Despite buying the &quot;Lafayette Journal&quot; to counteract the &quot;Lafayette Courier&quot; (which supported Orth), Purdue was again defeated 14,933 to 14,728.

==Purdue University==

In 1862, the Morrill Land Grant Act was passed by Congress, and the competition was on to find a location for a land grant college in Indiana. Bidding was fierce between Indiana University in Bloomington, Northwestern Christian in Indianapolis, and the Stockwell and Battle Ground Collegiate Institutes. After the death of influential Lafayette Senator Albert S. White, the Stockwell bid fell through. Years of wrangling failed to reach a compromise. In 1865, the state started the State Normal College (later Indiana State University), partly to relieve some of the pressure. To make Tippecanoe County stand out, various locals stepped up with offers of land and money.

By 1869, Tippecanoe&#x27;s bid was up to nearly $400,000 in cash, land, and bonds, but the legislature still stalled. Then, Purdue stepped forth with $100,000 of his personal wealth. His only conditions were for the college to be located in Battle Ground and for his surname to be associated with it. After some more negotiations, when the name of the university was chosen and he was added to the board of trustees, Purdue&#x27;s donations were raised to $150,000 (equivalent to $2.9 million in 2019) and of land. The negotiations also allowed the new board of trustees to choose the site of the university and on May 6, 1869, the General Assembly established the institution in Tippecanoe County as Purdue University. Classes began at Purdue on September 16, 1874, with six instructors and 39 students.

==Death==

He died of an apparent stroke on September 12, 1876, aged 73, on the first day of classes of the third academic year at the university he had helped found. Purdue&#x27;s grave is located on the university&#x27;s main campus. A bachelor, he had no heirs; his estate was tied up in litigation for years after his death.

<text>Showtime Movie Channels was a group of Australian pay-TV movie channels, available on the Foxtel, Optus and Austar TV platforms. The service consisted of five original channels (showtime premiere, showcase, showtime action, showtime comedy, showtime drama), three HD simulcasts (showtime premiere HD, showcase HD, showtime action HD) and two timeshift channels (showtime two, showcase two). It was owned and operated by the Premium Movie Partnership (PMP), a joint venture in which Sony Pictures Entertainment, NBCUniversal, Viacom, News Corporation and Liberty Global had equal shares. Foxtel took over managing and producing the Showtime channels as of 31 October 2012, with it purchasing assets of the PMP. On 9 December 2012, it was announced that Movie Network and Showtime (with the exception of Showcase) would be replaced with a new line-up of Foxtel branded movie channels to be named [[Foxtel Movies]]

The main competitor to Showtime was Movie Network Channels.

==History==

Formed in late 1994 through a joint partnership between Australis Media, Columbia TriStar, MCA, Viacom and Tele-Communications Inc., Showtime started broadcasting in 1995 as part of the basic package on the now-defunct Galaxy service, showing first-run films. At the same time its sister channel named Encore was launched, showing older &#x27;classic&#x27; movies. Until their launch in March 1995, trailers and previews were broadcast in their channel slots. Both channels were originally programmed in Burbank, California, until local operations commenced in October 1995. It later became available as part of the Austar and Foxtel services when they were launched. In December 2002, the Showtime channels also became available on Optus Television. Encore was renamed Showtime Greats on 1 March 2004, with a move to more contemporary films.

In September 2007 it was announced that a premium channel called &quot;showcase&quot; would be launched on 1 December 2007 as part of the suite of Showtime channels, ahead of changes that would allow Movie Network to compete directly with Showtime for subscribers.

showcase screens movies (mainly independent, arthouse and documentary features),some comedy programs as well as a number of television series.

On 15 November 2009, Showtime Greats was replaced by showtime action, showtime comedy and showtime drama. In addition, Showtime was renamed showtime premiere.

On 11 October 2012, Foxtel announced they would acquire certain assets of the Premium Movie Partnership, which would result in Foxtel managing and producing the Showtime channels as of 31 October 2012.

==Channels==
All showtime channels area available on Foxtel, Austar and Optus, unless otherwise noted. showtime premiere and showcase are also available through Xbox 360&#x27;s IPTV service.


===Showcase===
===Showtime Greats===
==Internet download services==
Launched on 1 October 2009 were two exclusive channels to Foxtel Download. These were:
* Showtime Family – featured family friendly movies and was exclusive to Foxtel&#x27;s download service.
* Showtime Horror – featured Classic and modern horror movies and was exclusive to Foxtel&#x27;s download service.

==Showtime Australia==
Showtime Australia is unrelated to the American Showtime service, but pays a licence fee for the use of the name and trademark. It also produces some Australian movies, such as &quot;Bad Eggs&quot;, in conjunction with other companies.

==Trademark and branding==
Despite the name being Showtime, for branding purposes it is usually spelt in all capitals to match the channel logo. Similarly, Showcase is usually spelt in all lower case. As a matter of fact, the branding for Showtime uses the former logo from the American cable service until 1997.

<doc id="1295963" wikidata="Q1506785" url="?curid=1295963" title="Empennage">
<text>The empennage ( or ), also known as the tail or tail assembly, is a structure at the rear of an aircraft that provides stability during flight, in a way similar to the feathers on an arrow. The term derives from the French language verb which means &quot;to feather an arrow&quot;. Most aircraft feature an empennage incorporating vertical and horizontal stabilising surfaces which stabilise the flight dynamics of yaw and pitch, as well as housing control surfaces.

In spite of effective control surfaces, many early aircraft that lacked a stabilising empennage were virtually unflyable. Even so-called &quot;tailless aircraft&quot; usually have a tail fin (usually a vertical stabiliser). Heavier-than-air aircraft without any kind of empennage (such as the Northrop B-2) are rare, and generally use specially shaped airfoils whose trailing edge provide pitch stability, and rearwards swept wings, often with dihedral to provide the necessary yaw stability. In some aircraft with swept wings, the airfoil section or angle of incidence may change radically towards the tip.

==Structure==

Structurally, the empennage consists of the entire tail assembly, including the tailfin, the tailplane and the part of the fuselage to which these are attached. On an airliner this would be all the flying and control surfaces behind the rear pressure bulkhead.

The front (usually fixed) section of the tailplane is called the &quot;horizontal stabiliser&quot; and is used to provide pitch stability. The rear section of the tailplane is called the elevator, and is a movable aerofoil that controls changes in pitch, the up-and-down motion of the aircraft&#x27;s nose. In some aircraft the horizontal stabilizer and elevator are one unit, and to control pitch the entire unit moves as one. This is known as a &quot;stabilator&quot; or &quot;full-flying stabiliser&quot;.

The vertical tail structure has a fixed front section called the &quot;vertical stabiliser&quot;, used to control yaw, which is movement of the fuselage right to left motion of the nose of the aircraft. The rear section of the vertical fin is the &quot;rudder&quot;, a movable aerofoil that is used to turn the aircraft&#x27;s nose right or left. When used in combination with the ailerons, the result is a banking turn, a &quot;coordinated turn&quot;, the essential feature of aircraft movement.

Some aircraft are fitted with a tail assembly that is hinged to pivot in two axes forward of the fin and stabiliser, in an arrangement referred to as a &quot;movable tail&quot;. The entire empennage is rotated vertically to actuate the horizontal stabiliser, and sideways to actuate the fin.

The aircraft&#x27;s cockpit voice recorder, flight data recorder and emergency locator transmitter (ELT) are often located in the empennage, because the aft of the aircraft provides better protection for these in most aircraft crashes.

== Trim ==
In some aircraft trim devices are provided to eliminate the need for the pilot to maintain constant pressure on the elevator or rudder controls.

The trim device may be:

*a trim tab on the rear of the elevators or rudder which act to change the aerodynamic load on the surface. Usually controlled by a cockpit wheel or crank.
*an adjustable stabiliser into which the stabiliser may be hinged at its spar and adjustably jacked a few degrees in incidence either up or down. Usually controlled by a cockpit crank.
*a bungee trim system which uses a spring to provide an adjustable preload in the controls. Usually controlled by a cockpit lever.
*an anti-servo tab used to trim some elevators and stabilators as well as increased control force feel. Usually controlled by a cockpit wheel or crank.
*a servo tab used to move the main control surface, as well as act as a trim tab. Usually controlled by a cockpit wheel or crank.

Multi-engined aircraft often have trim tabs on the rudder to reduce the pilot effort required to keep the aircraft straight in situations of asymmetrical thrust, such as single engine operations.

==Tail configurations==
Aircraft empennage designs may be classified broadly according to the fin and tailplane configurations.

The overall shapes of individual tail surfaces (tailplane planforms, fin profiles) are similar to wing planforms.

===Tailplanes===

The tailplane comprises the tail-mounted fixed horizontal stabiliser and movable elevator. Besides its planform, it is characterised by:
*Configuration – tailless or canard.
*Location of tailplane – mounted high, mid or low on the fuselage, fin or tail booms.
*Fixed stabiliser and movable elevator surfaces, or a single combined stabilator or &quot;[all]-flying tail&quot;. (General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark)

Some locations have been given special names:
*Conventional tail – The vertical stabiliser and horizontal stabilisers are mounted to the rear of the fuselage. This is the simplest configuration that performs all three aspects of the function of a tail: trim, stability, and control. Around 60% of current aircraft designs — and about 80% ever — incorporate this type of tail. Examples are found on aircraft of every size and role, from general aviation types like the ubiquitous Cessna 172 to the largest airliners ever flown, such as the Airbus A380. Examples of this type of tail were in use as early as the Blériot VII of 1907.
*Cruciform tail – The horizontal stabilisers are placed midway up the vertical stabiliser, giving the appearance of a cross when viewed from the front. Cruciform tails are often used to keep the horizontal stabilisers out of the engine wake, while avoiding many of the disadvantages of a T-tail. Examples include the Hawker Sea Hawk and Douglas A-4 Skyhawk.
*T-tail – The horizontal stabiliser is mounted on top of the fin, creating a &quot;T&quot; shape when viewed from the front. T-tails keep the stabilisers out of the engine wake, and give better pitch control. T-tails have a good glide ratio, and are more efficient on low speed aircraft. However, the T-tail has several disadvantages. It is more likely to enter a deep stall, and is more difficult to recover from a spin. For this reason a small secondary stabiliser or tail-let may be fitted lower down where it will be in free air when the aircraft is stalled. A T-tail must be stronger, and therefore heavier than a conventional tail. T-tails also tend to have a larger radar cross section. Examples include the Gloster Javelin and McDonnell Douglas DC-9.

===Fins===

The fin comprises the fixed vertical stabiliser and rudder. Besides its profile, it is characterised by:
*Number of fins – usually one or two.
*Location of fins – on the fuselage (over or under), tailplane, tail booms or wings

Twin fins may be mounted at various points:
*Twin tail A twin tail, also called an H-tail, consists of two small vertical stabilisers on either side of the horizontal stabiliser. Examples include the Antonov An-225 Mriya, B-25 Mitchell, Avro Lancaster, and ERCO Ercoupe.
*Twin boom A twin boom has two fuselages or booms, with a vertical stabiliser on each, and a horizontal stabiliser between them. Examples include the Northrop P-61 Black Widow, P-38 Lightning, de Havilland Sea Vixen, Sadler Vampire, and Edgley Optica.
*Wing mounted midwing as on the F7U Cutlass or on the wing tips as on the Handley Page Manx and Rutan Long-EZ

Unusual fin configurations include:
*No fin – as on the McDonnell Douglas X-36. This configuration is sometimes incorrectly referred to as &quot;tailless&quot;.
*Multiple fins – examples include the Lockheed Constellation (three), Bellanca 14-13 (three), and the Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye (four).
*Ventral fin – underneath the fuselage. Often used in addition to a conventional fin as on the (North American X-15 and Dornier Do 335).

===V, Y and X tails===
An alternative to the fin-and-tailplane approach is provided by the V-tail and X-tail designs. Here, the tail surfaces are set at diagonal angles, with each surface contributing to both pitch and yaw. The control surfaces, sometimes called ruddervators, act differentially to provide yaw control (in place of the rudder) and act together to provide pitch control (in place of the elevator).

*V tail: A V-tail can be lighter than a conventional tail in some situations and produce less drag, as on the Fouga Magister trainer, Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk RPV and X-37 spacecraft. A V-tail may also have a smaller radar signature. Other aircraft featuring a V-tail include the Beechcraft Model 35 Bonanza, and Davis DA-2. A slight modification to the V-tail can be found on the Waiex and Monnett Moni called a Y-tail.
*Inverted V tail:The unmanned Predator uses an inverted V-tail as do the Lazair and Mini-IMP.
*Y tail: A V-tail with an added lower vertical fin (generally used to protect an aft propeller), as LearAvia Lear Fan 
*X tail: The Lockheed XFV featured an &quot;X&quot; tail, which was reinforced and fitted with a wheel on each surface so that the craft could sit on its tail and take off and land vertically.

===Outboard tail===
An outboard tail is split in two, with each half mounted on a short boom just behind and outboard of each wing tip. It comprises outboard horizontal stabilizers (OHS) and may or may not include additional boom-mounted vertical stabilizers (fins). In this position, the tail surfaces interact constructively with the wingtip vortices and, with careful design, can significantly reduce drag to improve efficiency, without adding unduly to the structural loads on the wing.

The configuration was first developed during World War II by Richard Vogt and George Haag at Blohm &amp; Voss. The Skoda-Kauba SL6 tested the proposed control system in 1944 and, following several design proposals, an order was received for the Blohm &amp; Voss P 215 just weeks before the war ended. The outboard tail reappeared on the Scaled Composites SpaceShipOne in 2003 and SpaceShipTwo in 2010.

===Tailless aircraft===

A tailless aircraft (often tail-less) traditionally has all its horizontal control surfaces on its main wing surface. It has no horizontal stabiliser – either tailplane or canard foreplane (nor does it have a second wing in tandem arrangement). A &quot;tailless&quot; type usually still has a vertical stabilising fin (vertical stabiliser) and control surface (rudder). However, NASA adopted the &quot;tailless&quot; description for the novel X-36 research aircraft which has a canard foreplane but no vertical fin.

The most successful tailless configuration has been the tailless delta, especially for combat aircraft.

<text>Zaporizhzhia (, ) or Zaporozhzhia () is a historical region in central east Ukraine below the Dnieper rapids (), hence the name, literally &quot;(territory) beyond the rapids&quot;.

From the 16th to the 18th centuries the Zaporizhzhia region functioned as semi-independent quasi-republican Cossack territory centred on the Zaporozhian Sich. Sometimes the region is referred to as &quot;Zaporozhian Sich&quot; as well. Zaporizhzhia corresponds to modern Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, major parts of Zaporizhzhia and Kirovohrad Oblasts, as well as parts of Kherson and Donetsk Oblasts of Ukraine.

==Names==
The region was officially known as Free lands of the Lower Zaporizhzhia Host (, (Wild Fields or Wild Plain), ). Among other names, it was called as Wild Fields, Novorossiya (in Russia), and others.

==Origin==
During the 1667 truce of Andrusovo, the region was under the condominium of both the Tsardom of Muscovy and the Kingdom of Poland, and in 1686, with the signing of the Treaty of Perpetual Peace, it passed under Russian suzerainty. In the 1750s, the Russian authorities sanctioned the establishment of New Serbia as a military frontier in the northwestern portion of the region, right on the border with the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Just before the Koliyivshchyna, the Russian authorities created Novorossiya Governorate, centered on Kremenchuk, which included territories of New Serbia, Slovianoserbia, and northern parts of the Zaporizhzhian region.

== History ==
Zaporizhzhia was the name of the territory of the Cossack state, the Zaporozhian Host, whose fortified capital was the Sich, usually located in the Great Meadow. From the 15th century to the late 17th century it was fought over by Muscovy, the Polish Kingdom and the Ottoman Empire, as well as by the Hetmans of Upper Ukraine (after 1648). For most of that time it was technically controlled by Poland, but it was rarely peaceful, and was widely regarded (from the perspective of the claimant governments) as turbulent and dangerous, the refuge of outlaws and bandits. In the eyes of the vast majority of the Ukrainian people, however, it was a promised land of heroes and free men (as later described in the poetry of Taras Shevchenko). In addition to many invasions by neighbouring countries, inhabitants of the Zaporozhe had to deal with an influx of new settlers from all directions and conflicts between the szlachta (Polish nobility) and independent Cossacks, who enjoyed a kind of autonomy in the region. Further, Cossacks often raided the nearby rich lands of the Ottoman Empire, retaliating for the constant slave raids of the Tatars against Ukrainian territories as far west as Galicia, in return provoking raids by Ottoman vassals, the Tatars.
The more independent Army of Lower Zaporozhia was centered at the Old Sich (&quot;Stara Sich&quot;). In 1709, Tsar Peter I ordered the destruction of the Old Sich, forcing the Zaporozhian Cossacks to flee to Oleshky, on the Black Sea in Ottoman territory. In 1734, the Russians allowed the Cossacks to re-establish their republic as the Free Lands of the Zaporozhian Host, based at the New Sich (&quot;Nova Sich&quot;), but brought in many foreign settlers, and destroyed the Sich for good in 1775, incorporating the territory into Novorossiya.

In the population Zaporizhzhia lands in the late 1770s to early 1780s after liquidation Zaporozhian Sich (1775) (uk) prevailed Ukrainians. In 1779, they accounted for 64.36% of the total population of this region. On the second the place among others ethnic group was occupied by the Greeks (13.76%), followed by Armenians (10.61%) and Russian (8.09%).

== Economy ==
Some historians estimate, that an average peasant&#x27;s hut did not last over 10 years. In the years 1605–1633, for example, Red Ruthenian lands suffered 100,000 people taken captive by the Ottomans, and 24,000 dead; in the first half of the 17th century, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, controlling Zaporizhzhia, lost approximately 300,000 of people due to the Ottoman raids.

==Legacy==
The city of Zaporizhzhia was named after the region in 1921, and was previously known as &quot;Aleksandrovsk&quot;.

<text>Coke Machine Glow is the first solo album released by Gord Downie, the singer for The Tragically Hip. It was released in 2001.

Early copies of the album were released as a joint package with a book by Downie, also titled &quot;Coke Machine Glow&quot;. The book included the song lyrics from the album and other poetry. The book included photographs by Toronto-based artist Michael Adamson. As a result of the album&#x27;s sales, the book is one of the best-selling volumes of poetry ever published by a Canadian writer.

Downie&#x27;s backing band on &quot;Coke Machine Glow&quot; was credited as &quot;the Goddamned Band&quot;. Participating musicians included Julie Doiron, Josh Finlayson, Atom Egoyan and members of The Dinner Is Ruined.

An online music publication formed in 2002 was named after the album.

In 2021, Arts &amp; Crafts Productions announced the release of &quot;Coke Machine Glow: Songwriters&#x27; Cabal&quot;, an expanded 20th anniversary reissue of the album. The reissue will feature a bonus disc of unreleased demos, alternate versions and outtakes, as well as an audiobook version of the poetry book read by figures such as singer-songwriter Sarah Harmer and actors Dan Aykroyd and Bruce McCulloch.

<text>Edward Meyrick Goulburn (11 February 18182 or 3 May 1897) was an English churchman.

Son of Mr Serjeant Edward Goulburn, M.P., recorder of Leicester, and nephew of the Right Hon. Henry Goulburn, chancellor of the exchequer in the ministries of Sir Robert Peel and the Duke of Wellington, he was born in London, and was educated at Eton and at Balliol College, Oxford. In 1839, he became fellow and tutor of Merton, and was ordained in 1842. For some years he held the living of Holywell, Oxford, and was chaplain to Samuel Wilberforce, bishop of the diocese. In 1850, he delivered the Bampton Lectures at Oxford on &quot;The Resurrection of the Body&quot;. In 1849, he had succeeded Tait as headmaster of Rugby, but in 1857 he resigned, and accepted the charge of Quebec Chapel, Marylebone.

In 1858 he became a prebendary of St Paul&#x27;s, and in 1859 vicar of St John&#x27;s, Paddington. In 1866, he was made Dean of Norwich, and in that office exercised a long and marked influence on church life. A strong Conservative and a churchman of traditional orthodoxy, he was a keen antagonist of higher criticism and of all forms of rationalism.

His &quot;Thoughts on Personal Religion&quot; (1862) and &quot;The Pursuit of Holiness&quot; were well received; and he wrote &quot;John William Burgon, Late Dean of Chichester: A Biography, With Extracts from His Letters and Early Journals&quot; (two volumes; 1892) about his friend Dean Burgon, with whose doctrinal views he was substantially in agreement. He resigned the deanery in 1889, and died at Tunbridge Wells on 3 May 1897. There is a memorial to him at Aynho.

<doc id="1296004" wikidata="Q5068781" url="?curid=1296004" title="Chalk, Kent">
<text>Chalk is a village and since 1935 a former civil parish which adjoins the east of Gravesend, in the Gravesham district, in the county of Kent, England. As is intuitive, its name comes from the Saxon word &quot;cealc&quot; meaning a chalkstone.

One layer of the chalk carries &quot;flints&quot;, stones embedded in the chalk, and these were used in building and in providing the means of fire for &quot;muskets&quot;. The stone is often cut to provide a flat edge as a craft known as &quot;flint-knapping&quot;. The trade was worked in Chalk from the 17th century onwards. Gun-flints were produced here in large quantities until the early 19th century.

Current issues relating to the immediate environment around Chalk include a proposed new Lower Thames Crossing across the nearby estuary marshes, confirmed in 2017.

== History ==

Chalk was known to people as early as the 8th century, as a &quot;witanagemot&quot; (a Saxon meeting) held here is mentioned in the Domesday Book. An Iron Age settlement was discovered near St. Mary&#x27;s Church during the laying of a gas pipeline. A large Roman villa was discovered here in 1961. Of the farms in the parish, Filborough is the oldest, having historical mention as early as AD 1220. At one time it was owned by Henry VIII. Two of its manor houses were called &quot;West Court&quot; and &quot;East Court&quot;.

Chalk&#x27;s major claim to fame is its connection with Charles Dickens. Here he spent his honeymoon with his new bride, Catherine Hogarth; and it was here that he wrote the early instalments of &quot;Pickwick Papers&quot;. He also used the old forge in the village as a model for Joe Gargery&#x27;s cottage in &quot;Great Expectations&quot;. The building still stands as a historically listed building

In 1931 the parish had a population of 563. On 1 April 1935 the parish was abolished and merged with Gravesend and became part of the Municipal Borough: until then it had been a somewhat remote village. It is now in the unparished area of Gravesend. In the main street was one of the tollgates for toll road opened between Northfleet and Strood; it remained until 1871. In 1921 the new Gravesend-Rochester road was built which left the former main village street to the north. The village inn, the &quot;White Hart&quot; now stands on the main road (now converted and part of the Harvester Restaurant group); and the school closed to be replaced by the village hall. The school project had been the brainchild of the Vicar of Chalk during the Victorian era, the Revd. William Joynes, and was originally funded largely through Joynes&#x27;s good working relationship with the Earl of Darnley; the ownership of the school became vested in the church&#x27;s Diocesan Board of Education. The local church bought the site through its PCC in 1960 during the ministry of the Revd Alan Holloway. The name &quot;Chalk Parish Hall&quot; was formalised at this time. The building was extensively enlarged in wood and equipped with a new but non-pitched roof in the later 1960s. After the building became significantly decayed through the rotting of the wooden structure, it was totally rebuilt in brick during 2006–7, and officially re-opened by The Duke of Kent on 5 June 2007.

The parish church of St. Mary the Virgin lies some distance to the east of the village centre. A church building existed in this location for the Synod of Chalkhythe in 785 and was noted in the Domesday Book of 1086; the current structure dates from the 12th century. The font is Norman and the oldest bell was first hung in 1348. The tower, a prominent landmark for navigation in the Thames, dates from the 15th century.

Also within the parish was the one-time Gravesend Airport, opened as the Gravesend School of Flying in 1932, which during World War II became a Royal Air Force fighter base. Sold to developers in 1957, on much of its site is now one of the biggest post-war housing estates, known as Riverview Park Estate.

<doc id="1296010" wikidata="Q321803" url="?curid=1296010" title="Effendi">
<text>Effendi or effendy ( ; ; originally from ) is a title of nobility meaning &quot;sir&quot;, &quot;lord&quot; or &quot;master&quot;, especially in the Ottoman Empire and the Caucasus&quot;.&quot; The title itself and its other forms are originally derived from Medieval Greek &quot;aphentēs&quot; which is derived from Ancient Greek &quot;authentēs&quot; meaning lord.

It is a title of respect or courtesy, equivalent to the English Sir. It was used in the Ottoman Empire and Byzantine Empire. It follows the personal name, when it is used, and is generally given to members of the learned professions and to government officials who have high ranks, such as &quot;bey&quot; or &quot;pasha&quot;. It may also indicate a definite office, as , chief physician to the sultan. The possessive form &quot;efendim&quot; (my master) was formerly used by slaves, and is commonplace in formal discourse, when answering the telephone, and can substitute for &quot;excuse me&quot; in some situations (e.g. asking someone to repeat something).

In the Ottoman era, the most common title affixed to a personal name after that of &quot;agha&quot; was &quot;efendi&quot;. Such a title would have indicated an &quot;educated gentleman&quot;, hence by implication a graduate of a secular state school (), even though at least some if not most of these efendis had once been religious students, or even religious teachers.

Lucy Mary Jane Garnett wrote in the 1904 work &quot;Turkish Life in Town and Country&quot; that Ottoman Christians, women, mullahs, sheiks, and princes of the Ottoman royal family could become &quot;effendi&quot;, a title carrying &quot;the same significance as the French &quot;Monsieur&quot;&quot; and which was one of two &quot;merely conventional designations as indefinite as our &#x27;Esquire&#x27; has come to be [in the United Kingdom]&quot;.

The Republican Turkish authorities abolished the title the 1930s.

==Etymology==
The Ottoman Turkish word , in modern Turkish , is a borrowing of the Medieval Greek , from Byzantine Greek , from Ancient Greek , &quot;master, author, doer, perpetrator&quot; (from which &quot;&quot;). The word was widely used as a Greek title for Byzantine nobles as late as 1465, such as in the letters of Cardinal Bessarion concerning the children of Thomas Paleologus.

==Other uses==

* Effendi () was also considered a title for a man of high education or social standing in an eastern (Mediterranean or Middle Eastern) country. It was an analogous to esquire, and junior to bey in Egypt during the period of the Muhammad Ali dynasty, and was used a lot among the Egyptians.
*Effendi is still used as an honorific in Egypt, Jordan, and Turkey (as well as some other former Ottoman states), and is the source of the word أفندم؟ &quot;afandim?&quot;, , a particularly polite way of saying, &quot;Excuse me?&quot;, and can be used in answering the phone.
*The colonial military forces of British East Africa and German East Africa were built from a stock of Sudanese soldiers of the Egyptian army, which was nominally under the Ottoman Empire. These units entered East Africa with some officers who brought their title of effendi with them and, thus, it continued to be used for non-European officers of the two colonial forces. Up to the present the Swahili form &quot;afande&quot; is a way to address officers in the armies of Kenya, Tanzania and recently in Rwanda with the coming to power of RPF.
** Effendi (Governor&#x27;s Commissioned Officer) was the highest rank that African soldiers could reach in the King&#x27;s African Rifles (KAR) and other British Colonial Auxiliary Forces units until 1961 (from then, promotions to commissioned officers became possible). They were equivalent to the Viceroy&#x27;s Commissioned Officers in the British Indian Army. An Effendi&#x27;s authority was confined to other KAR troops (askaris), and he could not command white troops. The KAR rank came into disuse during the 1930s and was reintroduced in 1956.
** Effendi was also a non-European&#x27;s officer rank in the Schutztruppe of German East Africa. Similar to the practice, Effendis were promoted by a governor&#x27;s warrant, not by a kaiser&#x27;s commission, as white commissioned officers were. Effendis had no authority over white troops. In the Schutztruppe this rank was used, together with other ranks of Ottoman origin like &quot;Tschausch&quot; (sergeant) and &quot;Ombascha&quot; (corporal). During the First World War askari NCOs were promoted to the rank of Effendi for exemplary service and leadership.
* In Bosnia and Herzegovina &quot;Efendija&quot; refers to Muslim clerics.
* In Indonesia and Malaysia, &quot;Effendi&quot; can be used as a masculine first name.
* In Pakistan and India, &quot;Effendi&quot; is the surname of some families whose ancestors migrated from Turkey or Afghanistan.
* In Afghanistan, some members of the former ruling Barakzai clan of Durranis also use &quot;Effendi&quot; or a variant &quot;Affandi&quot; as their surname.
* In China, &quot;Effendi&quot; (阿凡提) often refers to Nasreddin.
* Jazz pianist McCoy Tyner has one composition named &quot;Effendi&quot;. It appears on his debut album, &quot;Inception&quot;.
* Shoghi Effendi, born Shoghí Rabbání, acquired the title from ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá in his youth.
* The word “apándi” used among today&#x27;s Uighurs Turkish is a form of Effendi. Apándi is nothing but master

<doc id="1296017" wikidata="Q869210" url="?curid=1296017" title="Corrido">
<text>The corrido (Spanish pronunciation: ) is a famous narrative metrical tale and poetry that forms a ballad. The songs often feature topics such as oppression, history, daily life for criminals, the vaquero lifestyle, and other socially relevant themes. Corridos were widely popular during the Mexican Revolution and in the Southwestern American frontier as it was also a part of the development of Tejano and New Mexico music, which later influenced Western music.

The &quot;corrido&quot; derives mainly from the romance and, in its most known form, consists of a salutation from the singer, a prologue to the story, the story itself, and a moral and farewell from the singer. In Mexico, it is still a popular genre today.

Outside Mexico, corridos are popular in Chilean national celebrations of Fiestas Patrias.

==History==
Corridos play an essential part in Mexican and Mexican American culture. The name comes from the Spanish word &quot;correr&quot; (&quot;to run&quot;). A typical corrido&#x27;s formula is eight quatrains with four to six lines containing eight syllables. Corridos have a long history in Mexico, starting from the Mexican War of Independence in 1810 and throughout the Mexican Revolution. Until the arrival and success of electronic mass media (mid-20th century), the &quot;corrido&quot; served in Mexico as the leading informational and educational outlet, even with subversive purposes, due to an apparent linguistic and musical simplicity that lent itself to oral transmission. After the spread of radio and television, the genre evolved into a new stage and is still in maturation. Some scholars, however, consider the &quot;corrido&quot; dead or moribund in more recent times (see, e.g. Vicente T. Mendoza, &quot;El corrido mexicano&quot;, 1954). In more rural areas where Spanish and Mexican cultures have been preserved because of isolation, the romance has also taken on other forms related to the &quot;corrido&quot;. In New Mexico, for example, a story-song emerged during the colonial period known as an &quot;Indita&quot;, which loosely follows the format of a &quot;corrido&quot;, but is chanted rather than sung, similar to a Native American chant, hence the name &quot;Indita&quot;.

The earliest living specimens of &quot;corrido&quot; are adapted versions of Spanish romances or European tales, mainly about disgraced or idealized love or religious topics. These, which include (among others) &quot;La Martina&quot; (an adaptation of the romance &quot;La Esposa Infiel&quot;) and &quot;La Delgadina&quot;, show the same basic stylistic features of the later mainstream &quot;corridos&quot; (1/2 or 3/4 tempo and &quot;verso menor&quot; lyric composing, meaning verses of eight or less phonetic syllables, grouped in strophes of six or fewer verses).
Beginning with the Mexican War of Independence (1810–1821) and culminating during the Mexican Revolution (1910–1921), the genre flourished and acquired its &quot;epic&quot; tones, along with the three-step narrative structure as described above.

Some &quot;corridos&quot; are love stories. These are not exclusively male; there are also &quot;corridos&quot; about women, such as La Venganza de Maria, Laurita Garza, El Corrido de Rosita Alvirez and La Adelita, or couples, such as La Fama de la Pareja sung by Los Tigres del Norte. Some even employ fictional stories invented by their composers.

Before the widespread use of radio, popular &quot;corridos&quot; were passed around as an oral tradition, often to spread the news of events (for example, &quot;La cárcel de Cananea&quot;) and famous heroes and humour to the population, many of whom were illiterate before the post-Revolution improvements to the educational system. The academic study of &quot;corridos&quot; written during the Revolution shows that they were used to communicate news throughout Mexico as a response to the propaganda being spread in the newspapers, which the corrupt government of Porfirio Díaz owned. Sheet music of popular &quot;corridos&quot; was sold or included in publications. Other &quot;corrido&quot; sheets were passed out free as a form of propaganda to eulogize leaders, armies, and political movements or, in some cases, to mock the opposition. The best-known Revolutionary &quot;corrido&quot; is &quot;La Cucaracha&quot;, an old song rephrased to celebrate the exploits of Pancho Villa&#x27;s army and poke fun at his nemesis Victoriano Huerta.

With the consolidation of &quot;Presidencialismo&quot; (the political era following the Mexican Revolution) and the success of electronic mass media, the &quot;corrido&quot; lost its primacy as a mass communication form, becoming part of a folklorist cult in one branch and, in another, the voice of the new subversives: oppressed workers, drug growers or traffickers, leftist activists and emigrated farm workers (mainly to the United States). Scholars designate this as the &quot;decaying&quot; stage of the genre, which tends to erase the stylistic or structural characteristics of &quot;revolutionary&quot; or traditional &quot;corrido&quot; without a clear and unified understanding of its evolution. This is mainly signified by the &quot;narcocorrido&quot;, many of which are egocentric ballads paid for by drug smugglers to anonymous and almost illiterate composers, but with others coming from the most popular norteño and banda artists and written by some of the most successful and influential ranchera composers.

In the Mestizo-Mexican cultural area, the three variants of &quot;corrido&quot; (romance, revolutionary and modern) are both alive and sung, along with popular sister narrative genres, such as the &quot;valona&quot; of Michoacán state, the &quot;son arribeño&quot; of the Sierra Gorda (Guanajuato, Hidalgo and Querétaro states) and others. Its vitality and flexibility allow original &quot;corrido&quot; lyrics to be built on non-Mexican musical genres, such as blues and ska, or with non-Spanish lyrics, like the famous song El Paso by Marty Robbins, and corridos composed or translated by Mexican indigenous communities or by the &quot;Chicano&quot; people in the United States, in English or &quot;Spanglish&quot;. The &quot;corrido&quot; was, for example, a favourite device employed by the Teatro Campesino led by Luis Valdez in mobilizing predominantly Mexican and Mexican-American farmworkers in California during the 1960s.

&quot;Corridos&quot; have seen a renaissance in the 21st century. Contemporary &quot;corridos&quot; feature contemporary themes such as drug trafficking (narcocorridos), immigration, migrant labour and even the chupacabra.

== Subcategories ==

===Narcocorridos===

Modern artists have created a modern twist to the historical corridos. This new type of corridos is called narcocorridos (&quot;drug ballads&quot;). The earliest form of corridos emerged in the Mexican Revolution and told stories of revolutionary leaders and battles. Narcocorridos typically use accurate dates and places to tell mainly stories of drug smuggling, including violence, murder, poverty, corruption, and crime.

The border zone of Rio Grande has been credited with being the birthplace of narcocorridos. This began in the 1960s with the fast growth of drug empires in the border states of Mexico and the United States. As drug lords grew in influence, people idolized them and began to show their respect and admiration through narcocorridos.

There are two main types of narcocorridos: commercial corridos and private corridos. Commercial narcocorridos are recorded by famous artists who idolize a specific drug dealer and release a song about him, while the drug dealer usually commissions private narcocorridos. While commercial corridos are available to the public, private narcocorridos are restricted to nightclubs that are frequently attended by drug dealers or through CDs bought on the street. Drug lords often pay singers to write songs about them to send a message to rivals. These songs are found to be most popular on YouTube; many have a banner &quot;Approved by the cartel&quot;. These types of corridos are changing from the formula historical and typical corridos would usually take. A first-person voice is now being sung instead of the historic third-person point of view.

The Mexican government has tried to ban narcocorridos because of their explicit and controversial lyrics. Most of the Mexican public argues that crimes and violence are to blame for narcocorridos. However, despite the efforts of the Mexican government to ban narcocorridos, the northern states of Mexico can still get access to these songs through US radio stations whose signal still reaches the conditions of the north of Mexico. Narcocorridos are also widely available on websites like YouTube and iHeartRadio. Today, narcocorridos are popular in Latin American countries like Bolivia, Colombia, Peru, Guatemala and Honduras.

Narcocorridos has grown in popularity in the United States, and the American public has targeted them. More recent narcocorridos are even targeted towards the American people; some are even written in English. Like many artists, narcocorrido singers have chosen American cities to perform concerts because the American public can buy concert tickets for a higher price than the average Mexican citizen.

=== Corridos tumbados ===
&quot;Corridos tumbados&quot; or &quot;trap corridos&quot; are corrido ballads influenced by hip hop and Latin trap. Largely popularized by Natanael Cano, the idea to fuse the two genres was proposed by Dan Sanchez, who wrote Natanael&#x27;s first corrido tumbado, &quot;Soy El Diablo&quot;, which later saw a remix featuring popular reggaeton and trap rapper Bad Bunny. Other prominent artists include Peso Pluma, Fuerza Regida and Junior H. Many corrido tumbado artists cite Ariel Camacho as one of their main influences.

Since 2023, this subgenre of corridos saw a major boom on the mainstream scene all around the world, with popular artists appearing on songs. These artists include Eladio Carrión, Myke Towers and Argentinian producer Bizarrap, who released a music session with Peso Pluma, which became a major hit. As corridos tumbados became popular around the world, major artists from the American hip-hop scene like Drake, Travis Scott and Lil Baby have been seen with acts from corridos tumbados. In Mexico, the genre has been controversial for some lyrics pertaining to &quot;violent themes&quot; including drug criminals.

== Gregorio Cortez ==
Gregorio Cortez was a Mexican man born on a ranch near Matamoros, Mexico, in 1875, as the &quot;seventh child to a family of eight.&quot; Cortez, his parents, and his eight siblings moved to Manor, Texas, in 1887. In 1889, Cortez joined his older brother, Ronaldo, in Karnes County, near Gonzales, Texas. They both worked for farmers as ranch hands and farmhands. They even worked as vaqueros. In 1900, Gregorio and Romaldo went to settle down and married. They were &quot;inseparable&quot;.

On June 12, 1901, sheriff W.T. Morris came to Cortez and Román to investigate a horse theft. Even though Cortez and Román were innocent, they spoke Spanish, and the Sheriff did not. Sheriff Morris relied on poor Spanish translations from his fellow Texas Rangers. Cortez and Romaldo got confused and played along. The Sheriff was looking for a horse thief and asked if they traded a horse. Gregorio said &quot;no&quot; and told the Sheriff he had a mare. After a while, Sheriff Morris assumed Gregorio and Romaldo were lying and framed them for a crime they did not commit.

However, when the Sheriff tried to arrest the brothers, Gregorio stood up to him, saying &quot;You can&#x27;t arrest me for nothing&quot;. The Sheriff did not understand his Spanish and thought he said, &quot;No white man can arrest me&quot;. The Sherriff got out his pistol and shot Ronaldo, wounding him. Gregorio shot the Sheriff in retaliation. However, Gregorio left the scene and headed straight towards the Austin-Gonzales vicinity.

Cortez walked eighty miles daily through rugged terrain to get to the border. All the while, Texas Rangers were following him, and he even killed the Gonzales sheriff Robert M. Glover, who led the charge. Gregorio walked 100 miles to meet a friend, Ceferino Flores, who gave him a saddle. Cortez eventually got a horse to ride 400 miles to the border. Gregorio landed at the Abran de la Garza sheep camp on June 22, 1901, where he started to talk with a man named Jesús González. González, however, led the rangers to find Cortez, and the rangers arrested him. Many Tejanos would brand González a traitor, and he would eventually be known as El Teco.

Cortez was later put on trial. A formal letter was written and signed by the Mexicans of Mexico City and the president of Mexico, who gave him money to help fund his claim. Subsequently, Gregorio was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder and the supposed theft of a horse. However, he was freed after a year. This verdict was a &quot;victory&quot; for Mexican Americans and the unfair treatment of Mexican Americans. His name became immortalized, and his story became a corrido, where Cortez was portrayed as a hero.

=== Ballad ===
The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez is a corrido that is well known by Mexican Americans who live near the Rio Grande border between the United States and Mexico. It tells the story of a Mexican man named Gregorio Cortez, who takes up a pistol to defend his rights against 33 Texas Rangers from June 12 to June 22, 1901.

The story of Gregorio Cortez was made into a corrido, and he would become a folk hero among people on the Texas-Mexico Border.

Cortez, a Mexican man with a kind heart and a diligent work ethic, was described as &quot;a man who never raised his voice to the parent or elder brother and never disobeyed.&quot; Most of the story is no different from his real life, but the report calls him a sharpshooter, and his brother Romaldo was renamed Román.

Sheriff Morris had Román and Cortez questioned about the horses. Instead of Romaldo being wounded, his counterpart Román was shot dead trying to protect his brother and collapsed on the ground. However, Gregorio got a gun and shot the sheriff to avenge his brother. The story fantasizes Gregorio as being a non-disabled man who ran across the country with the Texas Rangers on his tail. The story tells that Gregorio walked 100 miles and rode more than 400 miles. Gregorio walked and walked until he reached the Rio Grande. However, as Gregorio arrived in Goliad, Texas, he met with his friend named &quot;El Teco&quot;. However, El Teco betrayed him and turned him in to the police. The police arrested Gregorio and put him on trial, and Gregorio was sentenced to &quot;ninety-nine years and a day&quot; in federal prison for horse theft, despite never stealing a horse.

=== Impact ===
The story of Gregorio Cortez is a testament to the culture of Mexican-Americans who live in the southwest United States and Mexican American culture in general. His tale was later made into a corrido and passed on from person to person. Cortez ended up becoming a folk hero, and it helped inspire stories of heroism and told the &quot;spirit of the border strife.&quot; Many people called Cortez a hero because his biography and the corrido both involved him running away from the &quot;rinches&quot;, or Texas Rangers. He kept evading them until his capture. This gave Mexican-Americans a Hispanic hero who defended his rights from American &quot;outsiders&quot;.

Both the story and the corrido tell how Gregorio Cortez was strong because he stood up to a legal system that did not favour Mexican Americans and became a hero to people of Mexican descent in Texas.

The corrido has been adapted to other media as well. In 1958, Américo Paredes wrote the book &quot;With His Pistol in His Hand: A Border Ballad and Its Hero&quot;. This book details the corrido and the story of Gregorio Cortes in detail. It has become a &quot;classic of Mexican-American prose.&quot; In 1982, a film titled &quot;The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez&quot; was created, and Edward James Olmos starred as Gregorio Cortez.

== Form ==
&quot;Corridos&quot;, like rancheras, have introductory instrumental music and &quot;adornos&quot; (ornamentations), accommodating the stanzas of the lyrics. Like &quot;rancheras&quot;, &quot;corridos&quot; can be played in virtually all regional Mexican styles. Also, like rancheras, corridos are usually played in polka, waltz, or mazurka mode.

<doc id="1296021" wikidata="Q1382696" url="?curid=1296021" title="John of Seville">
<text>John of Seville (Latin: &quot;Johannes Hispalensis&quot; or &quot;Johannes Hispaniensis&quot;) (fl. 1133-53) was one of the main translators from Arabic into Castilian in partnership with Dominicus Gundissalinus during the early days of the Toledo School of Translators. John of Seville translated a litany of Arabic astrological works in addition to being credited with the production of several original works in Latin.

==Life and Context==
John of Seville was a baptized Jew, whose Jewish name (now unknown) has been corrupted into &quot;Avendeut&quot;, &quot;Avendehut&quot;, &quot;Avendar&quot; or &quot;Aven Daud&quot;. This evolved into the middle name &quot;David&quot;, so that, as a native of Toledo, he is frequently referred to as Johannes (David) Toletanus. However, Avendehut&#x27;s translations typically translated Arabic text into Spanish vernacular. John of Seville was capable of translating Arabic directly into Latin, creating a distinction between himself and Avendehut. Some historians argue that in fact there were two different persons with a similar name, one as Juan Hispano (Ibn Dawud) and other as Juan Hispalense, this last one perhaps working at Galician Limia (Ourense), for he signed himself as &quot;Johannes Hispalensis atque Limiensis&quot;, during the Reconquista, the Christian campaign to regain the Iberian Peninsula. Though his precise birthdate and death date remain unknown, he is known to have flourished in his work from 1133 to 1153. His date of death is sometimes placed around 1157, but this remains an uncertainty.

==Translated and Original works==
Since John of Seville had gone by multiple names throughout his lifetime, it is often debated by historians as to which translations of this time period were actually his. The topics of his translated works were mainly astrological, in addition to astronomical, philosophical and medical. John of Seville&#x27;s particular style of translation is recognized by scholars due to his proclivity to translate works, word for word, while continuing to maintain the original language&#x27;s syntax and grammatical structure.

=== Astrological and Astronomical ===
John of Seville translated Al-Farghani&#x27;s &quot;Kitab Usul &#x27;ilm al-nujum&quot; (&quot;Book on the Elements of the Science of Astronomy&quot;) into Latin in 1135 (&#x27;era MCLXXIII&#x27;) under the revised title of &quot;The Rudiments of Astronomy&quot;, as well as the Arab astrologer Albohali&#x27;s &quot;Book of Birth&quot; into Latin in 1153. This also includes the work to translate another one of Al-Farghani’s works titled &quot;Kitāb fī Jawāmiʿ ʿIlm al-Nujūm&quot; (&quot;Elements of astronomy on the celestial motions&quot;). He also translated &quot;Kitāb taḥāwīl sinī al-‘ālam&quot; (&quot;Flowers of Abu Ma&#x27;shar&quot;) by Abu Ma&#x27;shar al-Balkhi into Latin. More notable works of John of Seville include the translations of a manuscript in the library of St. Marks, the &quot;Greater Introduction of Albumasar&quot;, and the engraved written work of Thebit. Another astronomical work translated by John is &quot;De compositione et utilitate astrolabii&quot; (&quot;The composition and utility of the astrolabe&quot;) which is an instructional book explaining the construction and utilization of astrolabes. The introduction of an effective method of marking alidades, an integral component of astrolabes, was introduced through one of John&#x27;s translations titled &quot;Dixit Johannes: Cum volueris facere astrolabium accipe auricalcum optimum.&quot; The work itself is originally attributed to the Arabic astronomer Mash’allah. Another significant work translated by John of Seville was Omar’s (Umar Ibn al-Farrukhân al-Tabarî) work &quot;Kitâb al-Mawâlid&quot; (&quot;The Book of Nativities&quot;), under the Latin title “De Nativitatibus.” &quot;Kitâb al-Mawâlid&quot; is an astrological treatise concerning “the interpretation of nativities, or birth horoscopes”. It has three separate books with quotes from other authors, including Ptolemy, Messahallah and Hermes. Another work that is attributed to John of Seville through a note in the beginning of one of the margins is from &quot;Astroligi(c)e speculationis exercitium habere volentibus,&quot; which is now at Pommersfelden, near Bamberg in Germany.

=== Medical and Alchemy ===
At least three of his translations, a short version of the &quot;Secretum Secretorum&quot; dedicated to a Queen Tarasia, a tract on gout offered to one of the Popes Gregory, and the original version of the 9th century Arabic philosopher Qusta ibn Luqa&#x27;s &quot;De differentia spiritus et animae&quot; (The Difference Between the Spirit and the Soul), were medical translations intermixed with alchemy in the Hispano-Arabic tradition. His partial translation of the &quot;Secretum Secretorum&quot; is considered to be his earliest known work. Unlike much of his later work, this translation utilizes a first-person perspective. A lesser-known translation of his titled &quot;Speculum Elementorum&quot;, also referred to as &quot;Tractatus de perfecta et infallibili Medicina arte Akimie&quot;, was originally written by an unknown author. Another notable work translated by John of Seville from arabic is the Emerald Tablet, an alchemical work of the Hermetic tradition that is originally credited to Hermes Trismegistus himself, it was said to contain many alchemical secrets.

=== Philosophical ===

In his &quot;Book of Algorithms on Practical Arithmetic&quot;, John of Seville provides one of the earliest known descriptions of Indian positional notation, whose introduction to Europe is usually associated with the book &quot;Liber Abaci&quot; by Fibonacci:

:“A number is a collection of units, and because the collection is infinite (for multiplication can continue indefinitely), the Indians ingeniously enclosed this infinite multiplicity within certain rules and limits so that infinity could be scientifically defined; these strict rules enabled them to pin down this subtle concept.”

John of Seville is also credited with working in collaboration with Dominicus Gundissalinus and Jewish philosopher Abraham Ibn Daud to translate the De anima of Avicenna, a philosophical commentary on Aristotle&#x27;s writings. Avicenna had many other of his works translated such as a philosophical encyclopedia titled Kitab al-Shifa’ (The Book of Healing) and a short script on metaphysics titled &quot;Liber de Causis&quot; (Book of Causes). John even retranslated an original Avicenna translation of Aristotle’s &quot;On the Heavens&quot;. It is speculated that the written work of Zael, titled Liber temporum, may have been translated by John of Seville. However, the name of the translator was never mentioned in the manuscript so it remains uncertain. A work by Jewish philosopher Avencebrol is believed to be translated by both John of Seville and Dominicus Gundissalinus titled Fons Vitae (Source of Life). Another one of John of Seville&#x27;s philosophical translation includes the work by philosopher Al-Ghazali titled &quot;Maqasid al-falasifa&quot; (The Aims of the Philosophers), a book regarding basic philosophical concepts such as judgement, concept and logic.

=== Original ===

In addition to his many translations John of Seville is credited with a work of his own titled, &quot;Epitome artis astrologiae&quot;, written in 1142 which is a summary of astrology as a whole.

== Copying Errors ==
The work of John of Seville was later preserved by medieval scholars through the copying of his translations. These copies occasionally deviate from John&#x27;s original text, producing errors that further perpetuate the issue of John&#x27;s identity. When the name of a translator was improperly copied into a manuscript, further copies of this manuscript would carry this error, initiating a mutation of names and dates over the span of multiple copies. Carelessness further complicated the matter. Abbreviations such as &quot;Ioh Hisp&quot; (Iohannes Hispalensis was yet another possible identity for John) were used, such as in a manuscript from 1503.

Fortunately, a number of factors have aided in determining whether certain translations belong to John of Seville. He would often sign his translations &quot;Cum laude Dei et eius adiutorio,&quot; making otherwise error-ridden manuscripts easily attributable to John.

<doc id="1296027" wikidata="Q7736962" url="?curid=1296027" title="The Gold Bug Variations">
<text>The Gold Bug Variations is a novel by American writer Richard Powers, first released in 1991.

==Plot introduction==
The novel intertwines the discovery of the chemical structure of DNA with the musicality of Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s harpsichord composition the &quot;Goldberg Variations&quot;. A similar theme is explored by Douglas Hofstadter in his 1979 book &quot;Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid&quot;, and the title also alludes to Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s 1843 short story &quot;The Gold-Bug&quot;, which is also incorporated in the plot of the novel.

The plot hinges on two love affairs: the first set in the 1950s, between two scientists intent on discovering the mysteries of DNA; the second in the 1980s, between two lovers who befriend the scientist featured in the novel&#x27;s flashbacks.

==Awards==

&quot;The Gold Bug Variations&quot; has received the following awards:

* &quot;Time&quot; Book of the Year, 1991
* &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; Best Books of 1991
* &quot;Vrij Nederland&quot; Best Books of 1991
* &quot;The New York Times&quot; Notable Book, 1991
* &quot;De Morgen&quot; Best Book of 1991 (named in 1999, in a compilation of the best books each year over the last half century)
* Finalist, National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction, 1991

<doc id="1296030" wikidata="Q1049261" url="?curid=1296030" title="Carbonless copy paper">
<text>Carbonless copy paper (CCP), non-carbon copy paper, or NCR paper (No Carbon Required, taken from the initials of its creator, National Cash Register) is a type of coated paper designed to transfer information written on the front onto sheets beneath. It was developed by chemists Lowell Schleicher and Barry Green, as an alternative to carbon paper and is sometimes misidentified as such.

Carbonless copying provides an alternative to the use of carbon copying. Carbonless copy paper has micro-encapsulated dye or ink on the back side of the top sheet, and a clay coating on the front side of the bottom sheet. When pressure is applied (from writing or impact printing), the dye capsules rupture and react with the clay to duplicate the markings made to the top sheet. Intermediary sheets, with clay on the front and dye capsules on the back, can be used to create multiple copies; this may be referred to as multipart stationery.

== Operation ==
Carbonless copy paper consists of sheets of paper that are coated with micro-encapsulated dye or ink or a reactive clay. The back of the first sheet is coated with micro-encapsulated dye (referred to as a Coated Back or CB sheet). The lowermost sheet is coated on the top surface with a clay that quickly reacts with the dye to form a permanent mark (Coated Front, CF). Any intermediate sheets are coated with clay on top and dye on the bottom (Coated Front and Back, CFB).

When the sheets are written on with pressure (e.g., ball-point pen) or impact (e.g., typewriter, dot-matrix printer), the pressure causes the micro-capsules to break and release their dye. Since the capsules are so small, the resulting print is very accurate.

Carbonless copy paper was also available in a self-contained version that had both the ink and the clay on the same side of the paper.

== Uses ==
Carbonless copy paper was first produced by the NCR Corporation, applying for a patent on June 30, 1953. Formerly, the options were to write documents more than once or use carbon paper, which was inserted between the sheet being written upon and the copy. Carbonless paper was used as business stationery requiring one or more copies of the original, such as invoices and receipts. The copies were often paper of different colors (e.g., white original for customer, yellow copy for supplier&#x27;s records, and other colors for subsequent copies). Stationery with carbonless copy paper can be supplied collated either in pads or books bound into sets, or as loose sets, or as continuous stationery for printers designed to use it.

== Dyes and chemicals ==
The first dye used commercially in this application was crystal violet lactone, which is widely used today. Other dyes and supporting chemicals used are PTSMH (&quot;p&quot;-toluene sulfinate of Michler&#x27;s hydrol), TMA (trimellitic anhydride), phenol-formaldehyde resins, azo dyes, DIPN (diisopropylnaphthalenes, formaldehyde isocyanates, hydrocarbon-based solvents, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polyoxypropylene diamine, epoxy resins, aliphatic isocyanates, bisphenol A, diethylene triamine, and others. The dyes in carbonless copy papers may cause contact dermatitis in sensitive persons.

== Health and environmental concerns ==
Until the 1970s, when the use of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) was banned due to health and environmental concerns, PCBs were used as a transfer agent in carbonless copy paper. PCBs are readily transferred to human skin during handling of such papers, and it is difficult to achieve decontamination by ordinary washing with soap and water. In Japan, carbonless copy paper is still treated as a PCB-contaminated waste.

Exposure to certain types of carbonless copy paper or its components has resulted, under some conditions, in mild to moderate symptoms of skin irritation and irritation of the mucosal membranes of the eyes and upper respiratory tract. A 2000 review found no irritation or sensitization on contact with carbonless copy paper produced after 1987. In most cases, good industrial hygiene and work practices should be adequate to reduce or eliminate symptoms. These include adequate ventilation, humidity, and temperature controls; proper housekeeping; minimal hand-to-mouth and hand-to-eye contact; and periodic cleansing of hands.

In a 1997 study, the University of Florida found that a poorly-ventilated office where large amounts of carbonless copy paper were used had significant levels of volatile organic compounds present in its air, whereas a well-ventilated office where little such paper was used did not. The study also found that there were higher rates of sick leave and illness complaints at the office using large amounts of carbonless copy paper. Another study, which was published in &quot;Environmental Health Perspectives&quot;, connected chronic occupational exposure to paper dust and carbonless copy paper with an increased risk of adult-onset asthma.

The average carbonless copy paper contains a high concentration of bisphenol A (BPA), an endocrine disruptor.

In 2001, three employees of a medical center in San Francisco filed a lawsuit against their employer, blaming exposure to carbonless copy paper and other chemicals for their inflammatory breast cancer.

With the increasing adoption of inexpensive inkjet printers and laser printers on computer systems since the 1980s, the use of carbonless multipart forms in businesses has declined, as it is simpler to make copies of documents.

<doc id="1296031" wikidata="Q2703101" url="?curid=1296031" title="Young Americans (TV series)">
<text>Young Americans is an American drama television series created by Steven Antin. The show debuted on July 12, 2000, on The WB network as a summer replacement for, and spin-off from another Columbia TriStar Television production, &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;. The series was originally ordered for the 1999–2000 United States television season with a planned fall debut, but was delayed due to unresolved matters between Columbia TriStar and The WB.

The main character, Will Krudski, was introduced late in season three of &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; as a childhood friend of the group who has kept in contact with Pacey Witter. The show explores themes of forbidden love, morality, social classes and gender roles.

== Plot summary ==
&quot;Young Americans&quot; is set in the town of New Rawley at a prestigious boarding school, Rawley Academy. Will Krudski, a working class New Englander, earns a scholarship to his hometown&#x27;s posh boarding school, starting with the summer session, as a means of escaping his abusive father. In a moment of carelessness he confesses to his roommate Scout Calhoun that he cheated on the entrance exam. Their professor, Finn, overhears Will and Scout discussing what to do. Before making a final decision about expelling him, Finn has Will write an essay on who he is.

Throughout the series, Will faces moral dilemmas as he struggles to find his place at school while not alienating his friends in town. There is also the forbidden love between Scout and Bella Banks, Will’s childhood friend who may or may not share the same father with Scout. Jacqueline Pratt, in an attempt to see if her mother notices her, enrolls at Rawley Academy posing as a male student with the name Jake. Things get complicated when she develops feelings for Hamilton Fleming, the dean&#x27;s son. Hamilton begins to wonder if he is gay as he realizes he has feelings for Jake. The story lines do not converge until the final two episodes of the show as Bella seeks the truth about her biological father.

== Production ==
Steve Antin credits a stop at a New England gas station as the inspiration for the series. He was a little surprised to see four teenage girls working as pump jockeys. &quot;One of them said, &#x27;My dad owns the station.&#x27; I just thought this was the sweetest thing I ever saw.&quot;

The pilot was filmed in Atlanta in 1999 and with a somewhat different cast. The character of Finn was played by Jeremy Sisto in the pilot, but between the pilot and the reshoots for the series, Sisto was cast in the title role of CBS&#x27; miniseries &quot;Jesus&quot;. When the production relocated they also replaced secondary roles, and the only original cast members that remained were the five principal actors. The pilot&#x27;s soundtrack contained recognizable tracks by Fatboy Slim, New Radicals, and The Flys, but after the reshoots, Antin replaced them with favorites like Nick Drake&#x27;s &quot;Pink Moon&quot; and Israel Kamakawiwo&#x27;ole&#x27;s &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot;, which at the same time became fashionable in commercials for Volkswagen&#x27;s Cabrio convertible and eToys.com. A subplot in the pilot involving an affair between Finn and the dean&#x27;s wife was dropped and later inserted into the third episode of the series.

The series was filmed in Havre de Grace, Maryland where a new &quot;town square&quot;, gas station and Friendly&#x27;s restaurant were built for the production of the show at the intersection of Congress Avenue and North Washington Street. Wilmington and Charlotte, both in North Carolina, had been considered possible filming locations for the series.

=== Sponsorship ===

&quot;Young Americans&quot; was originally supposed to be a mid-season show in 2000 but was put on hold until Coca-Cola offered to sponsor the show. The character of Will Krudski was then written into &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; to associate &quot;Young Americans&quot; with one of The WB&#x27;s established shows. When &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; went on hiatus in the summer of 2000, &quot;Young Americans&quot; occupied its timeslot of Wednesdays at 9 P.M. Repeats were shown at 9 P.M. on Fridays.

The Coca-Cola Company paid $6 million to be the primary sponsor, the show being billed as &quot;Coca-Cola Presents &quot;Young Americans&quot;&quot;. &quot;Young Americans&quot; was profiled by Steve Carell on the August 22, 2000 episode of &quot;The Daily Show&quot; in the Ad Nauseam segment due to the Coca-Cola tie ins. Carell constantly referred to &quot;The Beginning&quot; as an &quot;hour-long commercial&quot;. Some of the scenes also took place in a Friendly&#x27;s restaurant, which was built from an old pizzeria for the show.

Coca-Cola products are seen or mentioned in most episodes. The unaired pilot episode does not contain the product placement. Among the changes to the pilot is a scene that was reshot in order to show the characters drinking Coca-Cola.

=== Promotion ===
A scene from the pilot, which was heavily promoted prior to the show&#x27;s premiere, where the characters and other students at Rawley run in slow motion to the school&#x27;s lake while stripping off their clothes was parodied in another WB show, &quot;Grosse Pointe&quot;.

==Episodes==
The main character, Will Krudski, was introduced late in season three of &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; as a childhood friend of the group who has kept in contact with Pacey Witter. In a three-episode story arc, Will goes to Capeside to visit with old friends while on spring break. After briefly dating Andie McPhee, he leaves Capeside to attend Rawley Academy.

=== Theme song ===
The theme song &quot;Six Pacs&quot; by The Getaway People from the album Turnpike Diaries was changed at the request of the producers to remove the original reference to cigarettes in the lyric.

Joe Voci, the show&#x27;s executive producer, said in an interview with VH1.com that &quot;Unlike other teen shows that are angst-driven, ours is about a group of kids who want to do the right things, and how they handle the obstacles they&#x27;re presented. The song presented a mood, tone and feel that is optimistic and implies a sense of adventure.&quot;

== Reception ==
David Zurawik of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; described the series as &quot;Shakespeare Summer Lite, with some gender-bending and woodland trysts to go along with the star-crossed lovers.&quot; In comparing the series to another debut Ken Tucker of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; found that &quot;it at least avoids the unearned angst of the summer&#x27;s other 15-year-olds-in-school show, Fox&#x27;s hapless &quot;Opposite Sex&quot;&quot;.
Harvard creative writing professor Jane Rosenzweig found that &quot;Young Americans&quot; &quot;has a breadth of focus that&#x27;s far more true to life than the so-called reality-based shows like MTV&#x27;s &quot;Real World&quot; and CBS&#x27;s summer hit &quot;Survivor&quot;.&quot;

Rob Owen of the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; said that the show presents as though the creator &quot;looked at the blueprints of other WB shows and plucked out the elements that would give his series the best chance for success with the Gen Y set.&quot; After naming a checklist of elements of the show that are common to many shows on The WB, Owen says that it is admirable from a business standpoint to make a show in such a manner but that it is not very original. Owen concludes by calling &quot;Young Americans&quot; &quot;mindless and clichéd&quot; but still &quot;guilty summer fun.&quot; Michele Hewitson of &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; compared the show to the film &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot; and said that it is not often &quot;an American television series manages to exceed all expectations - of utter awfulness.&quot;

Despite being a spin-off of one of the most popular WB shows, &quot;Young Americans&quot; received low ratings throughout its summer run and was cancelled in August 2000. As of September 2010 &quot;Young Americans&quot; ranks 49th among unreleased TV shows on TVShowsOnDVD.

<text>In &quot;rudimental drumming&quot;, a form of percussion music, a drum rudiment is one of a number of relatively small patterns which form the foundation for more extended and complex drumming patterns. The term &quot;drum rudiment&quot; is most closely associated with various forms of &quot;field drumming&quot;, where the snare drum plays a prominent role. In this context &quot;rudiment&quot; means not only &quot;basic&quot;, but also &quot;fundamental&quot;. This tradition of drumming originates in military drumming and it is a central component of martial music.
== Definition ==
Rudimental drumming has something of a flexible definition, even within drumming societies devoted to that form of drumming. RudimentalDrumming.com defines it as &quot;the study of coordination.&quot; The Percussive Arts Society defines it as a particular method for learning the drums—beginning with rudiments, and gradually building up speed and complexity through practicing those rudiments. &quot;Camp Duty Update&quot; defines a drum rudiment as an excerpt from a military call with a definite rhythm, definite sticking, definite dynamic structure (accents), and a defined nomenclature. &quot;Encyclopedia Rudimentia&quot; defines a rudiment as a short pattern of strokes, using John Pratt&#x27;s logic that &quot;the rudiments of drumming are strokes,&quot; in reference to the four basic drum strokes.

==History==
The origin of snare drum rudiments can be traced back to Swiss mercenaries armed with long polearms. The use of pikes in close formation required a great deal of coordination. The sound of the tabor was used to set the tempo and communicate commands with distinct drumming patterns. These drumming patterns became the basis of the snare drum rudiments.

=== Swiss ===
The earliest instance of rudimental fife and drum is often cited as the Swiss military at the battle of Sempach in 1386. There is evidence, however, that the Swiss were already using drums in battle in 1315 at the Battle of Morgarten. Initially, Swiss rudiments were very influential to the French system, which in turn was the basis for many other rudimental systems. Switzerland produced two distinct rudimental cultures, the wider &quot;Swiss Ordonnanz Trommel&quot; practiced in Zurich, Valais, and Geneva, and the Basel version or &quot;Basler Trommeln&quot;.

The Basler Trommeln rudiments, in contrast to the Swiss Ordonnanz Trommel, are much more widely known and practiced outside of Switzerland due to Fritz Berger&#x27;s publications, &quot;Das Basler Trommeln, Werden und Wesen&quot; and &quot;Instructor for Basle Drumming&quot;, and travels to the United States in the 1930s. His student Alfons Grieder continued to promote Basel style drumming in North America for many years. The two Swiss systems differ in several ways, including that Basel drumming rudiments draw heavily from the French system while Swiss rudiments are indigenous, and that Basel drumming was notated in a set of symbols until the 20th century (Berger devised his own notation system for export that was much more legible) while Swiss rudiments were written in standard notation centuries earlier. Swiss Ordonnanz rudiments are nearly unknown outside of Switzerland, while Basel rudiments are featured (after the 1930s) in other systems around the world, such as the Scottish, American, and Hybrid. The Top Secret Drum Corps is a prominent organization from Basel Switzerland that utilizes traditional Basel rudimental drumming along with other rudimental influences.

=== French ===
French rudiments were influenced by the Swiss and then later contributed back to the specific Basel culture in a two-way exchange. Thoinot Arbeau&#x27;s &quot;Orchesographie&quot; of 1588 is commonly cited as one of the first &quot;rudimental&quot; texts, though its actual use of notation is limited. French professional drummers became part of the king&#x27;s honor guard in the 17th and 18th centuries. In 1754 published &quot;Instruction pour les Tambours,&quot; which was one of the earliest military drum manuals to codify a specific national duty in legible drum notation. The craft was improved during the reign of Napoleon I. The French dance known as Le Rigodon is one of the cornerstones of modern rudimental drumming. Kastner&#x27;s &quot;Manuel Général de Musique Militaire a L’Usage des Armées Françaises&quot; from 1848 details the rudimental signals starting as far back as the 17th century and works up through the variations to his contemporary mid-19th century usage, showing that the complexity of French drumming increased significantly over time.

At least 5 French military manuals appeared between 1870 and 1900, beginning with Félix Carnaud&#x27;s &quot;École du Tambour&quot; from 1870 and N. Pita&#x27;s &quot;Methode de Tambour&quot; from 1885, followed closely and expanded upon by H. Broutin (1889), Théophile Dureau (1895), and E. Reveillé (1897).

In the 20th century, published his &quot;Méthode de Tambour &quot; in 1901. Robert Tourte&#x27;s &quot;Méthode de Tambour et Caisse Claire d&#x27;Orchestre&quot; was published in 1946 and combined a selection of 34 rudiments and the classic French military calls with studies of common orchestral excerpts such as Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s Scheherezade and Maurice Ravel&#x27;s Bolero. The French system is complex and expansive, rivaled in scope only by the Swiss, American, and Scottish systems. Between 30 and 34 rudiments have normally been taught from the mid-20th century onward, from a historical catalog of over 70 rudiment variations.

=== Spanish ===
Spain used its own rudimental system, documented as far back as 1761, with publication of &quot;Toques de Guerra&quot;. Composed mostly of single strokes, the system is extremely simple with only around eight to ten named patterns.

===Italian===
The Italian peninsula was home to fife and drum traditions as far back as the 1400s. During the 19th century, at least 3 distinct styles of drumming were practiced: Austrian style drumming in the northern regions adjacent to the Austrian Empire, a central Italian style in Sardinia, Piedmont, and the Papal States, and a southern style in Naples and Sicily. With the unification of the Kingdom of Italy in the 1870s, the central Italian style was adopted over the Austrian or Sicilian as the official pan-Italian rudimental system.

=== German ===
German speaking regions of Europe, often referred to historically as Prussian, had developed their own unique rudimental system by the late 18th century, as evidenced by Wittwe&#x27;s 1777 publication &quot;Kurze Anweisung zum Trommel-Spiel&quot; The system was dominated by the right hand and featured only about 14 standard rudiments, such as the druckruf and doppelwirbel. The Prussian drumming style was distinct from the regional rudimental practices of Bavaria, despite Bavaria being a part of modern Germany. It also did not apply in Hannover – which was effectively part of the British Empire for a significant period and thus used British drumming idioms.

=== Swedish ===
Sweden had drummers on military payrolls as early as 1528. The Swedish rudimental style has some unique features and rhythmic interpretations, however it draws significant influence from both French and Prussian sources. The first written manual dates from 1836 with little variation in style until the 20th century. After the 1960s the drum parts in standard military music became simplified compared to their earlier incarnations.

=== Dutch ===
The military tradition of the Netherlands has a distinct rudimental system. Drummers are known to have participated in military functions from possibly as far back as 1570. Military units paid the drummers from their own commanders&#x27; budget until 1688 when the military began paying musicians directly. The rudimental term &quot;Tattoo,&quot; a term for a meeting of drum corps and a signal from the standard camp duty, derives from the Dutch &quot;Taptoe&quot; Tamboers. Manuals go back at least as far as 1809 with the publication of &quot;Over Het Tromslaan – Met Marschen En Andere Muziekstukken Voor Den Trom&quot; which indicates some basic rolls and a few military signals. &quot;Marsen en Signalen voor de Koninklijke Nederlandsche Armee&quot; by was published in 1815 and shows about nine basic rudiments. Several manuals are known from the late 1800s and early 1900s, such as &quot;Voorschrift voor den seargent of korporaaltamboer&quot; of 1893, &quot;Tamboers- and Hoornblazersschool&quot; of 1896, and &quot;Tamboers- and Hoornblazersschool&quot; from 1901. The system was simplified and many embellishments removed in the 1930s. The system was again refined following WWII in 1945 and 1946. Now, only the Dutch Marines continue the official military tradition actively, along with a few civilian groups. There are currently only about 14 Dutch rudiments.

=== Russian ===
Russian drumming was originally brought in from abroad specifically to emulate the drumming of other nations. Dutch drumming was used verbatim in the 17th century. This gave way to a more distinct Russian style in the 18th century under Peter I. Imperial Russian military units stopped using drummers around 1909 but the USSR reintroduced drumming to the military in the 1920s. Russia actually has no names or specific sticking for rudimental patterns but a selection of rolls and ruffs of various lengths are present in military music. Youth Pioneer groups use simplified military signals, though the rudiments taught in these groups use American terms.

=== British ===
British rudimental manuals with decipherable rudiments date back as far as 1634 with the publication of Thomas Fisher&#x27;s &quot;Warlike Directions or the Soldiers Practice&quot; which shows at least 4 ruff-based rudiments. A more thorough manual appeared in 1760, Spencer&#x27;s &quot;The Drummer&#x27;s Instructor&quot;. British military drumming had already been exported to the American Colonies by the time of the American Revolution in the 1770s. The anonymously authored &quot;Young Drummers Assistant&quot; was published around 1780 and was an influential book on both sides of the Atlantic. The British system was further refined for the 19th century by Samuel Potter in 1817 with his book &quot;The Art of Beating the Drum&quot;. In the 18th century, drummers uniforms were reverse color from the rest of their military unit, but after the War of 1812, and coincidentally during Samuel Potter&#x27;s service, their uniforms were switched to the standard color scheme so as not to stand out in battle. Samuel&#x27;s son, Henry Potter, a noted instrument maker, would later publish an updated drum manual called &quot;Authorised Sergeant Drummers&#x27; Manual.&quot; In 1887, the War Office published &quot;Drum and Flute Duty for the Infantry Branch of the Army&quot; which is one of only a few pre-20th century publications to feature the 17 stroke roll. In modern times, every infantry battalion in the British military has a rudimental Corps of Drums except for Irish, Scottish, and Rifle Battalions which feature Pipe Bands and their associated style of Scottish drumming.

=== Scottish ===
Scottish drum and fife signals (those differing significantly from the English) date back to at least the 17th century, when the English referred to them as the &quot;Scots Duty.&quot; The old Scottish calls used similar rudimental patterns and drumming idioms to the English, but featured slightly different drum arrangements and fife tunes, rather than the distinctively snappy dot-cut triplet shuffle sound that pipe band drumming would use later. The Scotch Reveille that would normally accompany The Mother and the Three Camps was adapted from, or at least inspired by, the Scotch Reveilly [sic] from this pre-pipe band era. Scottish pipe bands, in their modern form, were created by the British Army around 1830. British regiments made up of Scottish clansmen married rudimental drumming with the Highland bagpipes and kilts in order to regain their independent culture. The drum rudiments were modified from British and European sources to fit with the piping idioms that had been in place for several hundred years prior. Pipe bands, and their stylistically unique drummers, saw their first widespread use during the Crimean War. They continued to be an active part of battle until World War I, after which they assumed a ceremonial role. There are currently around 60–75 Scottish rudiments played in pipe bands around the commonwealth countries and former British colonies, taking influence from Swiss, French, and American Hybrid drumming as well as traditional Scottish rhythms.

=== American ===
Many attempts at formalizing a standard list of American snare drum rudiments have been made. The first publication to formally organize American drumming was by Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben at Valley Forge. He included camp duty signals in his general manual on military practices for George Washington’s troops, the “blue book” written in 1778–79, though the drum parts were listed in prose. The first America rudimental manual to have prescribed rudimental exercises in notation was &quot;A Revolutionary War Drummers Book&quot;, also from 1778, which displayed 20 exercises that can be taken as rudiments as well as &quot;drum beatings&quot; such as the piece &quot;Valley Forg&quot; [sic]. This was followed by Ben Clark&#x27;s manual on military drumming in 1797 and David Hazeltine&#x27;s book &quot;Instructor in Martial Music&quot; in 1810. Charles Stewart Ashworth was the first person to actually label short drum exercises as &quot;Rudiments&quot; in 1812.

Several more manuals of note were printed between 1812 and 1860, including those by Charles Robbins (1812), Rumrille and Holton (1817), Alvan Robinson (1818), Levi Lovering (1819), and George Klinehanse (1853).

A number of manuals next appeared during the American Civil War, including those by Elias Howe (1861), Keach, Burditt, and Cassidy (1861), Bruce and Emmett (1862), H.C. Hart (1862), Simpson and Canterbury (1862), William Nevins (1864). Adjutant-General Samuel Cooper&#x27;s general military manual of 1861 also contained a small section on rudimental drumming, but in a very simplified form, as did Brigadier General Silas Casey’s tactics manual of 1862.

Gardiner A. Strube published his influential distillation of Civil War practices in 1870. Between the Civil War and the 20th century, Fifes and Drums were phased out in favor of bugles for official signals, though military music continued to be taught and practiced for ceremonial purposes. John Philip Sousa produced a manual in 1886 that would later be revised several times by the U.S. Army. Walter Smith also produced a manual in 1897 for the Army and Navy, though he was a bandleader in the Marines. In 1912, just 42 years after Strube&#x27;s Lessons, Harry Bower, in his book &quot;The Harry A. Bower System for Drums Bells Xylophone and Tympani,&quot; calls the military rudiments &quot;ancient,&quot; &quot;old fashioned,&quot; and &quot;old style beats, rolls, and flourishes,&quot; to be played only when emulating a military sound. The Bower book offers several competing versions of many rudiments taken from multiple competing 19th century manuals.

During World War I, V.F. Safranek published a manual in 1916 (based on Smith&#x27;s 1897 work), while Carl E. Gardner released another in 1918. Sanford Moeller put a list in his 1925 book, which is one of the few books here intended for civilian drummers. The Moeller method advocated for a return to the &quot;ancient&quot; traditions of military drumming technique and rudiments.

The National Association of Rudimental Drummers, an organization established to promote rudimental drumming that included George Lawrence Stone and William F. Ludwig, Sr., organized a list of 13 essential rudiments and second set of 13 additional rudiments to form the Standard NARD 26 in 1933. This was largely based on Strube&#x27;s 25 rudiments from 1870, with a single addition, the single stroke roll.

During World War II, the War Department used a manual from 1940, &quot;TM 20–250 Field Music Technical Manual&quot;, that clearly echoes Smith and Safranek. The Marine Corps had a competing manual, essentially mirroring Sousa but updated in 1942, &quot;Manual for Drummers, Trumpeters, and Fifers&quot;.

Later in the 20th century there were several notable variations and extensions of rudimental drumming from teachers like Charles Wilcoxon, author of &quot;All-American Drummer&quot; and &quot;Modern Rudimental Swing Solos&quot;, and Alan Dawson, whose &quot;Rudimental Ritual&quot; was popular at Berklee College of Music in the 1970s.

Drum Corps International was founded in 1971 bringing together drum corps from around North America to compete, some of which had been in existence since the 1930s or 1940s (though many others were formed as late as the mid-1960s). From the outset, the drummers steadily expanded the rudimental vocabulary from the traditional American military and NARD repertoire to include Swiss rudiments as well as Hybrid rudiments that combined elements of multiple unrelated rudiments into new, more complex patterns.

In 1984, a Percussive Arts Society committee led by Jay Wanamaker reorganized, and reinterpreted, the NARD 26 and added another 14 to form the current 40 International Snare Drum Rudiments.

Beginning in the early 1990s, rudimental instruction began to focus heavily on hybrid rudiments. Edward Freytag&#x27;s 1993 &quot;Rudimental Cookbook&quot; and Dennis Delucia&#x27;s 1995 &quot;Percussion Discussion&quot; both feature significant hybrid rudiment instruction. This trend continued into the 21st century with John Wooton&#x27;s 2010 &quot;Rudimental Remedies&quot;, Bill Bachman&#x27;s 2010 &quot;Rudimental Logic&quot;, and Ryan Bloom&#x27;s 2019 &quot;Encyclopedia Rudimentia&quot; 
significantly focusing on hybrid corps-style rudiments as well as older standards.

=== Present day ===
In the 21st century there are four principal rudimental drumming cultures: Swiss Basler Trommeln, Scottish pipe drumming, Anglo-American ancient drumming, and American modern drumming (or DCI hybrid drumming). Other organized rudimental systems include the French, Dutch, German (Prussian), , , Bavarian, Austro-Hungarian, Italian, Belgian, , , Swiss Ordonnanz Trommel (non-Basel, poorly understood outside of Switzerland), and Bajoaragonés systems, which are still studied and performed on a small scale in their home countries. There is also a distinct historic Spanish military rudimental culture, though this system is no longer widely used, as well as a similarly defunct Sicilian system.

Recently, the International Association of Traditional Drummers (IATD) has been working to once again promote the 26 NARD rudiments of 1933 (1870 Strube list of 25 plus 1). One of the chief issues the IATD has with the PAS 40 is the &quot;Swiss influence,&quot; though only eight of the extra 14 rudiments (that do not appear in the Standard 26) are foreign or not found in American military manuals prior to Strube. Only two of those eight non-traditional rudiments can be traced to a Swiss origin.

There is a movement in the German-speaking areas of Europe, led by Claus Hessler and Percussion Creativ, to revise rudimental practices and combine the French and Basel systems with some of the modern American rudiments into a single Rudimental Codex of 42 rudiments. The Rudimental Codex has been submitted to UNESCO as an intangible World Heritage Site.

==Terminology==
=== Single stroke ===
A stroke performs a single percussive note. There are four basic single strokes.

=== Double stroke ===
A double stroke consists of two single strokes played by the same hand (either RR or LL).

=== Diddle ===
A diddle is a double stroke played at the current prevailing speed of the piece. For example, if a sixteenth-note passage is being played, then any diddles in that passage would consist of sixteenth notes.

=== Paradiddle ===
A paradiddle consists of two single strokes followed by a double stroke, i.e., RLRR or LRLL. When multiple paradiddles are played in succession, the first note always alternates between right and left. Therefore, a single paradiddle is often used to switch the &quot;lead hand&quot; in drumming music.

=== Mill stroke ===
A mill stroke is essentially a reversed paradiddle with the sticking RRLR or LLRL with an accent on the first note. The single flammed mill is the most common mill stroke variant in American playing.

=== Drag ===
A drag is a double stroke played at twice the speed of the context in which it is placed. For example, if a sixteenth-note passage is being played then any drags in that passage would consist of thirty-second notes. Drags can also be notated as grace notes, in which case the spacing between the notes can be interpreted by the player. On timpani, drags are often played with alternating sticking (lrL or rlR).

In Scottish pipe band snare drumming, a drag consists of a flam where the grace note is played as a &quot;deadstick&quot; (staccato note).

=== Ruff ===
Historically, 2 grace notes preceding a beat were known as a Ruff (or Rough) llR if played closed and a Half Drag llR when played open. Ruff can also refer to a single stroked set of grace notes preceding a regular note. In American playing the 3 Stroke Ruff has 2 single stroked grace notes before the primary or full note rlR and a 4 Stroke Ruff has 3 singles before the primary note lrlR. Other rudimental systems have differing sticking methods and names for similar notation figures. Though still used and taught by drummers and drum teachers in practice, the 3 Stroke Ruff and 4 Stroke Ruff are not officially listed on the NARD or PAS rudiment sheets and the term Drag has eclipsed Ruff (or Rough) for the double stroked rudiments, in both open or closed execution, according to the current PAS standard terminology.

=== Flam ===
A flam consists of two single strokes played by alternating hands (rL or lR). The first stroke is a quieter grace note followed by a louder primary stroke on the opposite hand. The two notes are played almost simultaneously, and are intended to sound like a single, broader note. The temporal distance between the grace note and the primary note can vary depending on the style and context of the piece being played. In the past, or in some European systems, open flams and closed flams were listed as separate rudiments.

=== Charge stroke ===
A charge stroke is a special variation on an open flam in which one or both of the notes are accented to provide a driving feel that can create the illusion that the downbeat has moved earlier in time. The two major types are French Lr or Rl and Swiss LR or RL with the first note preceding the downbeat, which falls on the second note, in both types. Charge strokes can be combined with flams or drags to create complex grace note figures preceding a downbeat.

=== Double stop ===
A double stop consists of two single strokes played simultaneously, one on each hand. It differs from a flam or charge stroke in that there is no space between the notes and both hands fall exactly at the same time. This is not considered an American rudiment on any common list, but is a staple of several European systems. Alternative names include Flat Flam, Unison, or Both and the technique is used in modern corps style snare drumming as well as drum kit and classical percussion applications.

=== Roll ===
Drum rolls are various techniques employed to produce a sustained, continuous sound.


==Percussive Arts Society rudiments==
Rudiments according to the Percussive Arts Society. There are more than 850 rudiments worldwide, but these 40 are the current American standards, referred to as “international” because they mix rudiments traditionally used in Anglo-American drumming with several drawn from the Swiss Basel drumming tradition. They were compiled by a committee led by Jay Wanamaker in 1984 that also happened to include William F. Ludwig Jr., son of the founder of NARD in 1933. In contrast, there are 26 rudiments between the NARD &quot;13 Essential&quot; and &quot;13 Rudiments to Complete&quot; sheets, 46 rudiments on the &quot;Scottish Drumming Rudiments&quot; sheet, and 42 rudiments on the French/Swiss &quot;Rudimental Codex&quot; sheet.

===Roll rudiments===

====Single stroke rudiments====
The single-stroke roll consists of alternating sticking (i.e., RLRL, etc.) of indeterminate speed and length.

====Multiple bounce roll rudiments====
====Double stroke open roll rudiments====
There are 10 official variants of the double-stroke roll.

===Diddle rudiments===

===Flam rudiments===

===Drag rudiments===

==Historical organization==
(NARD Standard 26 American Drum Rudiments of 1933)

===Thirteen &quot;essential&quot; rudiments===
===Second thirteen rudiments===
===Last fourteen rudiments===

In 1984, the Percussive Arts Society added 14 more rudiments to extend the list to the current 40 International Snare Drum Rudiments. The ordering was completely changed during this last re-organization.

==Hybrid rudiments==
A hybrid drum rudiment is when two rudiments are combined into one rudiment. For example, the PAS #30 Flam Drag is a simple hybrid combining the traditional PAS rudiments #20 Flam and #31 Drag. A hybrid can also be created by adding a prefix before a rudiment or a suffix at the end of the rudiment in the form of extra notes or a rudimental pattern.

There are certain characteristics that make a reasonable hybrid rudiment;

* The Rudiment cannot be too long as to where it extends beyond one measure (bar).
* The Rudiment needs to be symmetrical meaning that it may be played on the right or left. As an example; the rock beat cannot be a rudiment because the right-hand plays something completely different from the left.

A few examples are the &quot;Herta&quot; which is a drag played with alternating sticking; the &quot;cheese&quot;, a diddle with a grace note; and the &quot;eggbeater&quot;, a five-tuplet with the sticking &quot;rrrll.&quot; These hybrids have themselves given way to further hybrids; the &quot;cheese invert&quot; (an inverted flam tap with cheeses instead of flams) and the &quot;diddle-egg-five&quot; (a paradiddle-diddle followed by an eggbeater and two diddles, one on each hand). Other hybrid rudiments include: &quot;book reports&quot;, &quot;ninjas&quot;, and &quot;flam dragons&quot; (formerly known as &quot;double flam drags&quot;).

Hybrid rudiments have been historically associated with modern marching band repertoire, especially Drum Corps International. The number of hybrid rudiments expanded rapidly starting in the 1990s. Today there are an indeterminate number, with more than 500 published and documented hybrid rudiments or unique variations.

The latest innovation in hybrid rudiments has been &quot;The Grid&quot;, which is a method for producing variations on a simple rudimental pattern by moving the individual elements of the rudiment (for example flams, accents, or diddles) through the notes of basic rhythm of the rudiment. One example of a Grid technique would be to play the PAS Flam Accent (a grace note and accent on the first of 3 single strokes) with the accent on the first note, then the second note, then the third note, producing 3 variations of the pattern and exhausting the placement options for the accent within the rhythm. The same could then be done with the grace note for the flam, producing 3 more patterns. The resulting 6 patterns could then be combined in a sequential way, producing further variations until all combinations of elements are exhausted. Not all of the resulting combinations are named or officially listed as rudiments, but are useful in developing a player&#x27;s skills.

<text>Choccolocco is an unincorporated community and census-designated place in Calhoun County, Alabama, United States. As of the 2010 census, its population was 2,804. It was founded in 1832.

The name Choccolocco is an anglicization of the Creek words &quot;chahko lago&quot; (&quot;big shoals&quot;) or &quot;choko rakko&quot; (&quot;big house&quot;); sources vary.

The community gained brief notoriety in 2001 when &quot;The Daily Show&quot; aired a piece on the &quot;Choccolocco Monster&quot;, a part of local folklore concerning sightings of a mysterious creature in the area in the late 1960s. An October 2001 article in the &quot;Anniston Star&quot; newspaper revealed that the creature was, in fact, local resident Neal Williamson. As a teenager, Williamson would don his costume (consisting of a cow skull and a sheet) and gain the attention of passing cars by jumping out of the woods onto the roadside, often startling motorists.

==Demographics==

Choccolocco first appeared on the 1890 U.S. Census as a town, but did not appear again until 2010 when it was made a census-designated place (CDP).
