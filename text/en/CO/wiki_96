<text>Rock Creek Cemetery is an cemetery with a natural and rolling landscape located at Rock Creek Church Road, NW, and Webster Street, NW, off Hawaii Avenue, NE, in the Petworth neighborhood of Washington, D.C., across the street from the historic Soldiers&#x27; Home and the Soldiers&#x27; Home Cemetery. It also is home to the InterFaith Conference of Metropolitan Washington.

On August 12, 1977, Rock Creek Cemetery and the adjacent church grounds were listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Rock Creek Church Yard and Cemetery.

==History==
The cemetery was first established in 1719 in the British colonial Province of Maryland as a churchyard within the glebe of St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church within the Rock Creek Parish. Later, the vestry decided to expand the burial ground as a public cemetery to serve the city of Washington, D.C., which had acquired the cemetery within its boundaries as established in 1791. The cemetery was formally recognized and established through an Act of Congress in 1840.

An expanded cemetery was landscaped in the rural garden style, to function as both a cemetery and a public park. It is a ministry of St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church, Rock Creek Parish, with sections for St. John&#x27;s Russian Orthodox Church and St. Nicholas Orthodox Cathedral.

The park-like setting of Rock Creek Cemetery has several notable mausoleums, sculptures, and tombstones. The best known is the Adams Memorial, a contemplative, androgynous bronze sculpture seated before a block of granite that was created by Augustus Saint-Gaudens and Stanford White. It marks the graves of Marian Hooper Adams and her husband, Henry Adams, and sometimes, mistakenly, the sculpture is referred to as &quot;Grief&quot;. Saint-Gaudens entitled it &quot;The Mystery of the Hereafter and The Peace of God that Passeth Understanding&quot;.

Other notable memorials include the &quot;Frederick Keep Monument&quot;, the Heurich Mausoleum, the Hitt Monument, the Hardon Monument, the Kauffman Monument that is known as &quot;The Seven Ages of Memory&quot;, the Sherwood Mausoleum Door, and the Thompson-Harding Monument.

<text>A hectocotylus (: hectocotyli) is one of the arms of male cephalopods that is specialized to store and transfer spermatophores to the female. Structurally, hectocotyli are muscular hydrostats. Depending on the species, the male may use it merely as a conduit to the female, analogously to a penis in other animals, or he may wrench it off and present it to the female.

The hectocotyl arm was first described in Aristotle&#x27;s biological works. Although Aristotle knew of its use in mating, he was doubtful that a tentacle could deliver sperm. The name &quot;hectocotylus&quot; was devised by Georges Cuvier, who first found one embedded in the mantle of a female argonaut. Supposing it to be a parasitic worm, in 1829 Cuvier gave it a generic name (&quot;Hectocotyle&quot;),
which is a New Latin term combining the Greek words for &quot;hundred&quot; (&quot;hec(a)to(n)&quot;) and for &quot;hollow thing, cup&quot; (&quot;cotyle&quot;).

== Structure ==
Generalized anatomy of squid and octopod hectocotyli:

==Variability==
Hectocotyli are shaped in many distinctive ways, and vary considerably between species. The shape of the tip of the hectocotylus has been much used in octopus systematics.

* Many coleoids lack hectocotyli altogether. 
* Among Decapodiformes (ten-limbed cephalopods), generally either one or both of arms IV are hectocotylized.
* In incirrate octopuses, it is one of arm pair III. Rare examples of double and bilateral hectocotylization have also been recorded in incirrate octopuses.
* In male seven-arm octopuses (&quot;Haliphron atlanticus&quot;), the hectocotylus develops in an inconspicuous sac in front of the right eye that gives the male the appearance of having only seven arms.
* In argonauts, the male transfers the spermatophores to the female by putting its hectocotylus into a cavity in the mantle of the female, called the &quot;pallial cavity&quot;. This is the only contact the male and female have with each other during copulation, and it can be at a distance. During copulation, the hectocotylus breaks off from the male. The funnel–mantle locking apparatus on the hectocotylus keeps it lodged in the pallial cavity of the female.

<text>Demonology 101 (sometimes abbreviated as &quot;D101&quot;) is a webcomic written and drawn by Faith Erin Hicks from August 1999 to June 2004. It tells the story of Raven, a 16-year-old demon being raised by a human in ordinary human society. Hicks&#x27; first public work gained attention as an early story-focused webcomic, and ran for 700 pages before being concluded.

==Development==
Hicks was inspired &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; in the creation of her first webcomic, alongside Jeff Smith&#x27;s comic &quot;Bone&quot; and the &quot;Gabriel Knight&quot; video game series. Hicks launched &quot;Demonology 101&quot; in August 1999 with its first episode. By 2003, the webcomic consisted of five self-contained stories. Hicks redrew the entirety of Episode 1 in 2002. &quot;Demonology 101&quot; is manga-influenced, and nearly the entire webcomic is rendered in black-and-white with heavy grey shading. Hicks drew her webcomic on printer paper she took from her parents.

Hicks completed &quot;Demonology 101&quot; in 2004, after having created 700 pages. After the conclusion of Episode Five, Hicks also wrote two short character-based stories, as well as a flashback webcomic titled &quot;A Distant Faith&quot;.

Because there were relatively few story-focused webcomics available in the late 1990s and early 2000s, &quot;Demonology 101&quot; very quickly acquired a small readership anticipating its weekly update. Hicks was very critical of her own art, but later said that &quot;Demonology 101&quot; &quot;was so important to me. ... it was all mine and that was wonderful.&quot;

==Synopsis==
&quot;Demonology 101&quot; is centered on seemingly &quot;normal&quot; girl named Raven, who is actually a 16-year-old demon who had been adopted by a human. Raised in isolation, Raven is eager to join the outside world and enrolls in high school. Although Raven is nominally the main character, the supporting cast is well-developed, adding depth to the world and highlighting the themes of the webcomic. The character Raven is mainly concerned with figuring out her own nature and fate, and &quot;Demonology 101&quot; largely explores these questions through her family ties and relationships. &quot;Demonology 101&quot; also explores the ideas of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot; through its complex cast of characters.

==Awards==
&quot;Demonology 101&quot; won two Web Cartoonists&#x27; Choice Awards in 2004, in the categories &quot;Outstanding Dramatic Comic&quot; and &quot;Outstanding Long Form Comic&quot;.

<text>Alexander Pavlovich Rodzyanko (; 26 August 1879 – 6 May 1970) was an officer of the Imperial Russian Army during the World War I and lieutenant-general and a corps commander of the White Army during the Russian Civil War. He also competed at the 1912 Summer Olympics.

==Biography==
Rodzyanko came from an old Ukrainian aristocratic family: his father Pavel Rodzyanko was a major landowner and his uncle Mikhail Rodzianko chaired the State Duma from 1911 to 1917. Aleksandr received his education in the Russian Page Corps military academy and at the Cadre Noir cavalry-school in Saumur in France; he then joined the elite Russian Chevalier Guard regiment. An excellent equestrian sportsman, he also studied for a year at the cavalry school at Pinerolo in Italy under Captain Federico Caprilli, known as &quot;the father of the modern forward seat&quot;. After successfully participating in London (1911), winning the King Eduard VII Cup, he competed in the 5th-placed jumping team for Russia at the 1912 Olympic Games in Stockholm. Most of the equestrian information about Rodzyanko was published by a Dutch horse magazine, called the &#x27;Hoefslag&#x27; by the secretary of the FEI Max E. Amman.

Promoted Colonel in 1912, he went on to take part in World War I. In 1914 he was sent to the frontline where he briefly served in the 2nd Kuban regiment and the 1st Linear Cossack regiment and headed the 16th Don regiment. He later served at the 8th Army and Chevalier Guard Regiment. From May 1916 he headed the Cavalry Officers School. From June to July 1917 he headed the Garrison of Riga. In October 1917 in Pskov the 17th Cavalry division that he headed was disbanded and he was interned by the Germans.

After the Russian Revolution of 1917 he accompanied Prince Lieven to solicit (unsuccessfully) British help for counter-revolutionaries active in Latvia. In 1918 he lived in Riga and received the German assistance in recruiting the volunteers into the anti-bolshevik units. In 1919 General Nikolay Yudenich appointed Rodzyanko (then commander of the Whites&#x27; Northern Corps) as his aide, where he led the counter-offensive actions against the Reds and participated in the unsuccessful advance on Petrograd. Once the Northwestern Army had been pushed back to Narva, Estonia, on 23 November 1919 Yudenich sent him to England to seek financial support for the further anti-bolshevik combat. After his mission proved abortive, he chose not to return to Estonia but settled in the United Kingdom and later in the United States.

His brother Pavel Rodzyanko became an instructor at the Irish cavalry school in Dublin and later emigrated to the United States. Aleksandr Pavlovich Rodzyanko became president of the Chevalier Guards association, wrote memoirs and died in New York City aged 90. He is buried at the Novo-Diveevo cemetery in Nanuet, Rockland County, New York.

<text>Chestnut Hill is a wealthy New England village located west of downtown Boston, Massachusetts, United States. It is best known for being home to Boston College and a section of the Boston Marathon route. Like all Massachusetts villages, Chestnut Hill is not an incorporated municipal entity. It is located partially in Brookline in Norfolk County; partially in the city of Boston in Suffolk County, and partially in the city of Newton in Middlesex County. Chestnut Hill&#x27;s borders are defined by the 02467 ZIP Code. The name refers to several small hills that overlook the 135-acre (546,000 m2) Chestnut Hill Reservoir rather than one particular hill.

==History==
The boundary between Newton and Brookline was originally more or less straight northwest–southeast, following today&#x27;s boundary at the east edge of the Newton Commonwealth Golf Course, and the west boundary of the MBTA rail yards. It followed what is today St. Thomas More Road and Chestnut Hill Driveway through swampland that is today the western edge of the Chestnut Hill Reservoir, and then rejoined today&#x27;s city limit that runs essentially with the portion of Beacon Street that forms the western boundary of the Reservoir, and continues southeast to today&#x27;s triple point between Boston, Brookline, and Newton near the intersection of Reservoir Road and Middlesex Road. Around the 1870s, the Lawrence farm land that is today bounded by Commonwealth Avenue, the slope dividing Boston College upper campus from lower campus, Beacon St., Chestnut Hill Driveway, and St. Thomas More Rd. was ceded from Newton to Boston, so that Boston could construct the Chestnut Hill Reservoir. What is today the Boston College lower campus and stadium was excavated to become the Lawrence Basin of the Reservoir, paired with the surviving Bradlee Basin, to receive water from the Sudbury Aqueduct. Beacon St. was rerouted around the southern and western edges of the Bradlee Basin. The two halves of the Reservoir were separated to preserve the Cochituate Aqueduct, which ran under a causeway separating the two halves of the reservoir, now roughly St. Thomas More Rd. and Chestnut Hill Driveway, and a short stretch of Beacon Street.

While most of Chestnut Hill remained farmland well into the early 20th century, the area around the reservoir was developed in 1870 by landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, designer of Central Park in New York City and of the Emerald Necklace in Boston and Brookline.

Because of the significance of its landscape and architecture, the National Register of Historic Places designated parts of Chestnut Hill as historic districts in 1980s. Examples of Colonial, Italianate, Shingle, Tudor Revival, and Victorian architectural styles are evident in the village&#x27;s country estates and mansions. The Boston College campus is itself an early example of Collegiate Gothic architecture.

==Parkland==

Hammond Pond Reservation, an extensive forest preserve and protected wetlands, goes through Chestnut Hill and Newton where it is also known as Webster Woods.

The Kennard Park and Conservation Area is a post-agricultural forest grown up on 19th century farmland. The mixed and conifer woodlands reveal colonial stone walls, a red maple swamp with century-old trees, and a sensitive fern marsh.

The Chestnut Hill Reservation embraces 120 acres adjacent to the Boston College campus, including a 1.5 mile walking trail around a reservoir. The Reservation was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted’s son and constructed in the late 1860s to give Boston clean drinking water and a rural park. Just outside the park proper, the Boston Waterworks with its three gatehouses at water’s edge and three majestic pump houses on Beacon Street is considered a masterpiece of 19th century engineering and landscape design.

The Heartbreak Hill Park, surrounding the Waban Hill reservoir, opened in 2015, and a major renovation was completed in 2020.

==Shopping centers==

* The Shops at Chestnut Hill
* The Street at Chestnut Hill

==Transportation==
Chestnut Hill is served by two branches of the Green Line of the MBTA, Boston&#x27;s light rail system. Stations include:
*B branch: Boston College; terminus of the line
*D branch: Chestnut Hill
The area is also served by the 51 and 60 MBTA buses.

Massachusetts Route 9 runs through the area from west to east and serves as the main retail corridor for Chestnut Hill and many surrounding communities. Hammond Pond Parkway connects the area from north to south as a four-lane road through conservation areas, bypassing the busy retail areas and residential neighborhoods.

<doc id="1308179" wikidata="Q3788858" url="?curid=1308179" title="Victoria Waterfield">
<text>Victoria Waterfield is a fictional character played by Deborah Watling in the long-running British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. A native of Victorian England, she was a companion of the Second Doctor and a regular in the programme from 1967 to 1968. Only two complete serials to feature her (&quot;The Tomb of the Cybermen&quot; and &quot;The Enemy of the World&quot;) exist complete in the BBC archives. However, DVDs of all her adventures have still seen release, with both official animation and photo reconstructions utilizing the original surviving audio taking the place of the missing episodes.

Watling reprised her role in the spin-off &quot;Downtime&quot; and a few audio dramas, one of which featured her as a temporary assistant to the Sixth Doctor. Victoria appeared in 7 stories (39 episodes).

==Casting==
According to the short BBC Video documentary &quot;The Dalek Factor&quot; about the making of &quot;The Evil of the Daleks&quot;, released in September 2021 as part of the animated restoration of the serial, Denise Buckley was cast in the role of Victoria Waterfield by director Derek Martinus. The production team had been hoping that Pauline Collins would continue in the role of Sam Briggs, that she had played in the previous story &quot;The Faceless Ones&quot;, but had created Victoria as a potential ongoing character should Collins decline. When Collins confirmed she did not want to join the regular cast, it was decided to introduce Victoria as the new companion and Denise Buckley was released, but paid in full, with Deborah Watling replacing her as a more suitable actress for the continuing role.

==Character history==
Victoria first appears in the 1967 serial &quot;The Evil of the Daleks&quot;. She is the daughter of widowed scientist Edward Waterfield (played by John Bailey), who in 1866 is experimenting with time travel and has attracted the attention of the Daleks. In order to assure Waterfield&#x27;s collaboration with their capture of the Doctor and their experiments with the Human and Dalek Factors, the Daleks with the help of Theodore Maxtable took Victoria as a prisoner. To measure his emotional responses, they then manipulated Jamie McCrimmon into rescuing her, although they ultimately re-captured her and took her to Skaro. At the conclusion of the adventure, Waterfield is killed saving the Doctor&#x27;s life, and asks him to take care of Victoria. The Doctor and Jamie take her in as part of the TARDIS crew.

On the outside, Victoria is a typically fragile lady of her era, frequently screaming when faced with the creatures the Doctor and his companions encounter in their travels, such as the Cybermen and the Yeti. However, this exterior hides an inner strength that crops up when needed. Victoria may be young, but she has an instinct for when she is being lied to, and her sensibility is a contrast to the recklessness of Jamie and the curiosity of the Doctor. Jamie, in particular, is very protective towards and fond of Victoria, and is heartbroken when she chooses to leave.

Despite being a good match to her two companions, Victoria eventually finds herself unsuited to extended travel with the Doctor. At the conclusion of the serial &quot;Fury from the Deep&quot;, she decides to leave the TARDIS, settling with a family named Harris in the 20th century. Her subsequent life is not shown in the television series. She is mentioned, but not seen to be travelling with the Second Doctor, in the 1985 serial &quot;The Two Doctors&quot;.

==Other appearances==
Victoria&#x27;s life after leaving the TARDIS is not explored in the series. The video release &quot;Downtime&quot; (1995), and its 1996 novelisation by Marc Platt as part of the Virgin Missing Adventures range, reveals that she struggles to adapt to twentieth century life and eventually returns to the Detsen monastery in Tibet, where she again falls under the influence of the Great Intelligence, now trapped on Earth after the end of &quot;The Web of Fear&quot;. The Intelligence manipulates Victoria into founding New World University, with the money left to her by her father (via a new will he drew up whilst working for the Daleks in 1866), where Victoria serves as Vice Chancellor and the possessed Professor Travers as Chancellor. Using the university&#x27;s computers, the Intelligence seizes control of the internet and creates new Yetis. Realising she has been misled, Victoria helps Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart and Sarah Jane Smith defeat it. She is then approached by both the Third and Fourth Doctors, but chooses not to travel with them.

The 1993 Children in Need campaign featured a short &quot;Doctor Who&quot;/&quot;EastEnders&quot; crossover called &quot;Dimensions in Time&quot;. In a story involving the various incarnations of the Doctor meeting up with various companions, Victoria ends up alongside the Third Doctor (Jon Pertwee) as they make their way back to the TARDIS after finding out that the culprit behind all the confusion is The Rani (played by Kate O&#x27;Mara). Watling had broken her arm prior to filming, and so wore a long cloak to conceal her cast.

Watling also returned to the role of Victoria Waterfield in the audio drama &quot;Power Play&quot;, where she was campaigning against nuclear waste before she became caught up in a plot to frame the Doctor for the actions of an assassin who destroys entire planets, resulting in her meeting the Sixth Doctor and Peri Brown; as in &quot;Downtime&quot;, she declined the offer to rejoin the Doctor, but was assured that the TARDIS doors will always be open to her.

<text>In mathematics, mixing is an abstract concept originating from physics: the attempt to describe the irreversible thermodynamic process of mixing in the everyday world: e.g. mixing paint, mixing drinks, industrial mixing.

The concept appears in ergodic theory—the study of stochastic processes and measure-preserving dynamical systems. Several different definitions for mixing exist, including &quot;strong mixing&quot;, &quot;weak mixing&quot; and &quot;topological mixing&quot;, with the last not requiring a measure to be defined. Some of the different definitions of mixing can be arranged in a hierarchical order; thus, strong mixing implies weak mixing. Furthermore, weak mixing (and thus also strong mixing) implies ergodicity: that is, every system that is weakly mixing is also ergodic (and so one says that mixing is a &quot;stronger&quot; condition than ergodicity).

== Informal explanation ==
The mathematical definition of mixing aims to capture the ordinary every-day process of mixing, such as mixing paints, drinks, cooking ingredients, industrial process mixing, smoke in a smoke-filled room, and so on. To provide the mathematical rigor, such descriptions begin with the definition of a measure-preserving dynamical system, written as .

The set formula_1 is understood to be the total space to be filled: the mixing bowl, the smoke-filled room, &quot;etc.&quot; The measure formula_2 is understood to define the natural volume of the space formula_1 and of its subspaces. The collection of subspaces is denoted by , and the size of any given subset formula_4 is ; the size is its volume. Naively, one could imagine formula_5 to be the power set of ; this doesn&#x27;t quite work, as not all subsets of a space have a volume (famously, the Banach–Tarski paradox). Thus, conventionally, formula_5 consists of the measurable subsets—the subsets that do have a volume. It is always taken to be a Borel set—the collection of subsets that can be constructed by taking intersections, unions and set complements; these can always be taken to be measurable. 

The time evolution of the system is described by a map formula_7. Given some subset formula_4, its map formula_9 will in general be a deformed version of formula_10 – it is squashed or stretched, folded or cut into pieces. Mathematical examples include the baker&#x27;s map and the horseshoe map, both inspired by bread-making. The set formula_9 must have the same volume as formula_10; the squashing/stretching does not alter the volume of the space, only its distribution. Such a system is &quot;measure-preserving&quot; (area-preserving, volume-preserving).

A formal difficulty arises when one tries to reconcile the volume of sets with the need to preserve their size under a map. The problem arises because, in general, several different points in the domain of a function can map to the same point in its range; that is, there may be formula_13 with . Worse, a single point formula_14 has no size. These difficulties can be avoided by working with the inverse map ; it will map any given subset formula_4 to the parts that were assembled to make it: these parts are . It has the important property of not &quot;losing track&quot; of where things came from. More strongly, it has the important property that &quot;any&quot; (measure-preserving) map formula_16 is the inverse of some map . The proper definition of a volume-preserving map is one for which formula_17 because formula_18 describes all the pieces-parts that formula_10 came from.

One is now interested in studying the time evolution of the system. If a set formula_20 eventually visits all of formula_1 over a long period of time (that is, if formula_22 approaches all of formula_1 for large formula_24), the system is said to be ergodic. If every set formula_10 behaves in this way, the system is a conservative system, placed in contrast to a dissipative system, where some subsets formula_10 wander away, never to be returned to. An example would be water running downhill—once it&#x27;s run down, it will never come back up again. The lake that forms at the bottom of this river can, however, become well-mixed. The ergodic decomposition theorem states that every ergodic system can be split into two parts: the conservative part, and the dissipative part.

Mixing is a stronger statement than ergodicity. Mixing asks for this ergodic property to hold between any two sets , and not just between some set formula_10 and . That is, given any two sets , a system is said to be (topologically) mixing if there is an integer formula_28 such that, for all formula_29 and , one has that formula_30. Here, formula_31 denotes set intersection and formula_32 is the empty set.

The above definition of topological mixing should be enough to provide an informal idea of mixing (it is equivalent to the formal definition, given below). However, it made no mention of the volume of formula_10 and , and, indeed, there is another definition that explicitly works with the volume. Several, actually; one has both strong mixing and weak mixing; they are inequivalent, although a strong mixing system is always weakly mixing. The measure-based definitions are not compatible with the definition of topological mixing: there are systems which are one, but not the other. The general situation remains cloudy: for example, given three sets , one can define 3-mixing. As of 2020, it is not known if 2-mixing implies 3-mixing. (If one thinks of ergodicity as &quot;1-mixing&quot;, then it is clear that 1-mixing does not imply 2-mixing; there are systems that are ergodic but not mixing.)

The concept of &quot;strong mixing&quot; is made in reference to the volume of a pair of sets. Consider, for example, a set formula_10 of colored dye that is being mixed into a cup of some sort of sticky liquid, say, corn syrup, or shampoo, or the like. Practical experience shows that mixing sticky fluids can be quite hard: there is usually some corner of the container where it is hard to get the dye mixed into. Pick as set formula_35 that hard-to-reach corner. The question of mixing is then, can formula_10, after a long enough period of time, not only penetrate into formula_35 but also fill formula_35 with the same proportion as it does elsewhere?

One phrases the definition of strong mixing as the requirement that 
:formula_39
The time parameter formula_24 serves to separate formula_10 and formula_35 in time, so that one is mixing formula_10 while holding the test volume formula_35 fixed. The product formula_45 is a bit more subtle. Imagine that the volume formula_35 is 10% of the total volume, and that the volume of dye formula_10 will also be 10% of the grand total. If formula_10 is uniformly distributed, then it is occupying 10% of formula_35, which itself is 10% of the total, and so, in the end, after mixing, the part of formula_10 that is in formula_35 is 1% of the total volume. That is, formula_52 This product-of-volumes has more than passing resemblance to Bayes theorem in probabilities; this is not an accident, but rather a consequence that measure theory and probability theory are the same theory: they share the same axioms (the Kolmogorov axioms), even as they use different notation.

The reason for using formula_53 instead of formula_54 in the definition is a bit subtle, but it follows from the same reasons why 
formula_55 was used to define the concept of a measure-preserving map. When looking at how much dye got mixed into the corner formula_35, one wants to look at where that dye &quot;came from&quot; (presumably, it was poured in at the top, at some time in the past). One must be sure that every place it might have &quot;come from&quot; eventually gets mixed into formula_35.

== Mixing in dynamical systems ==
Let formula_58 be a measure-preserving dynamical system, with &quot;T&quot; being the time-evolution or shift operator. The system is said to be strong mixing if, for any formula_59, one has
: formula_60

For shifts parametrized by a continuous variable instead of a discrete integer &quot;n&quot;, the same definition applies, with formula_61 replaced by formula_62 with &quot;g&quot; being the continuous-time parameter.

A dynamical system is said to be weak mixing if one has
: formula_63

In other words, formula_64 is strong mixing if formula_65 in the usual sense, weak mixing if
: formula_66

in the Cesàro sense, and ergodic if formula_67 in the Cesàro sense. Hence, strong mixing implies weak mixing, which implies ergodicity. However, the converses are not true: There exist ergodic dynamical systems which are not weakly mixing, and weakly mixing dynamical systems which are not strongly mixing. The Chacon system was historically the first example given of a system that is weak mixing but not strong mixing.

Theorem. Weak mixing implies ergodicity.

Proof. If the action of the map decomposes into two components , then we have , so weak mixing implies , so one of formula_29 has zero measure, and the other one has full measure.

=== Covering families ===
Given a topological space, such as the unit interval (whether it has its end points or not), we can construct a measure on it by taking the open sets, then take their unions, complements, unions, complements, and so on to infinity, to obtain all the Borel sets. Next, we define a measure formula_69 on the Borel sets, then add in all the subsets of measure-zero (&quot;negligible sets&quot;). This is how we obtain the Lebesgue measure and the Lebesgue measurable sets.

In most applications of ergodic theory, the underlying space is almost-everywhere isomorphic to an open subset of some formula_70, and so it is a Lebesgue measure space. Verifying strong-mixing can be simplified if we only need to check a smaller set of measurable sets.

A covering family formula_71 is a set of measurable sets, such that any open set is a &quot;disjoint&quot; union of sets in it. Compare this with base in topology, which is less restrictive as it allows non-disjoint unions.

Theorem. For Lebesgue measure spaces, if formula_64 is measure-preserving, and formula_73 for all formula_29 in a covering family, then formula_64 is strong mixing.

Proof. Extend the mixing equation from all formula_29 in the covering family, to all open sets by disjoint union, to all closed sets by taking the complement, to all measurable sets by using the regularity of Lebesgue measure to approximate any set with open and closed sets. Thus, formula_73 for all measurable .

=== &quot;L&quot;2 formulation ===

The properties of ergodicity, weak mixing and strong mixing of a measure-preserving dynamical system can also be characterized by the average of observables. By von Neumann&#x27;s ergodic theorem, ergodicity of a dynamical system formula_58 is equivalent to the property that, for any function formula_79, the sequence formula_80 converges strongly and in the sense of Cesàro to , i.e.,
: formula_81

A dynamical system formula_58 is weakly mixing if, for any functions formula_83 and formula_84
: formula_85

A dynamical system formula_58 is strongly mixing if, for any function , the sequence formula_80 converges weakly to , i.e., for any function formula_84
: formula_89

Since the system is assumed to be measure preserving, this last line is equivalent to saying that the covariance , so that the random variables formula_90 and formula_91 become orthogonal as formula_24 grows. Actually, since this works for any function , one can informally see mixing as the property that the random variables formula_90 and formula_91 become independent as formula_24 grows.

=== Products of dynamical systems ===

Given two measured dynamical systems formula_96 and formula_97 one can construct a dynamical system formula_98 on the Cartesian product by defining formula_99 We then have the following characterizations of weak mixing:

: Proposition. A dynamical system formula_96 is weakly mixing if and only if, for any ergodic dynamical system , the system formula_98 is also ergodic.

: Proposition. A dynamical system formula_96 is weakly mixing if and only if formula_103 is also ergodic. If this is the case, then formula_103 is also weakly mixing.

=== Generalizations ===

The definition given above is sometimes called strong 2-mixing, to distinguish it from higher orders of mixing. A strong 3-mixing system may be defined as a system for which
: formula_105
holds for all measurable sets &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;. We can define strong k-mixing similarly. A system which is strong &quot;k&quot;-mixing for all &quot;k&quot; = 2,3,4... is called mixing of all orders.

It is unknown whether strong 2-mixing implies strong 3-mixing. It is known that strong &quot;m&quot;-mixing implies ergodicity.

=== Examples ===

Irrational rotations of the circle, and more generally irreducible translations on a torus, are ergodic but neither strongly nor weakly mixing with respect to the Lebesgue measure.

Many maps considered as chaotic are strongly mixing for some well-chosen invariant measure, including: the dyadic map, Arnold&#x27;s cat map, horseshoe maps, Kolmogorov automorphisms, and the Anosov flow (the geodesic flow on the unit tangent bundle of compact manifolds of negative curvature.)

The dyadic map is &quot;shift to left in binary&quot;. In general, for any formula_106, the &quot;shift to left in base &quot; map formula_107 is strongly mixing on the covering family , therefore it is strongly mixing on , and therefore it is strongly mixing on .

Similarly, for any finite or countable alphabet , we can impose a discrete probability distribution on it, then consider the probability distribution on the &quot;coin flip&quot; space, where each &quot;coin flip&quot; can take results from . We can either construct the singly-infinite space formula_108 or the doubly-infinite space . In both cases, the shift map (one letter to the left) is strongly mixing, since it is strongly mixing on the covering family of cylinder sets. The Baker&#x27;s map is isomorphic to a shift map, so it is strongly mixing.

== Topological mixing ==
A form of mixing may be defined without appeal to a measure, using only the topology of the system. A continuous map formula_109 is said to be topologically transitive if, for every pair of non-empty open sets formula_110, there exists an integer &quot;n&quot; such that
: formula_111
where formula_112 is the &quot;n&quot;th iterate of &quot;f&quot;. In the operator theory, a topologically transitive bounded linear operator (a continuous linear map on a topological vector space) is usually called hypercyclic operator. A related idea is expressed by the wandering set.

Lemma: If &quot;X&quot; is a complete metric space with no isolated point, then &quot;f&quot; is topologically transitive if and only if there exists a hypercyclic point formula_14, that is, a point &quot;x&quot; such that its orbit formula_114 is dense in &quot;X&quot;.

A system is said to be topologically mixing if, given open sets formula_10 and , there exists an integer &quot;N&quot;, such that, for all , one has
: formula_116

For a continuous-time system, formula_112 is replaced by the flow , with &quot;g&quot; being the continuous parameter, with the requirement that a non-empty intersection hold for all .

A weak topological mixing is one that has no non-constant continuous (with respect to the topology) eigenfunctions of the shift operator.

Topological mixing neither implies, nor is implied by either weak or strong mixing: there are examples of systems that are weak mixing but not topologically mixing, and examples that are topologically mixing but not strong mixing.

== Mixing in stochastic processes ==
Let formula_118 be a stochastic process on a probability space . The sequence space into which the process maps can be endowed with a topology, the product topology. The open sets of this topology are called cylinder sets. These cylinder sets generate a σ-algebra, the Borel σ-algebra; this is the smallest σ-algebra that contains the topology.

Define a function formula_119, called the strong mixing coefficient, as
: formula_120
for all . The symbol formula_121, with formula_122 denotes a sub-σ-algebra of the σ-algebra; it is the set of cylinder sets that are specified between times &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, i.e. the σ-algebra generated by .

The process formula_118 is said to be strongly mixing if formula_124 as . That is to say, a strongly mixing process is such that, in a way that is uniform over all times formula_125 and all events, the events before time formula_125 and the events after time formula_127 tend towards being independent as formula_128; more colloquially, the process, in a strong sense, forgets its history.

=== Mixing in Markov processes ===
Suppose formula_129 were a stationary Markov process with stationary distribution formula_130 and let formula_131 denote the space of Borel-measurable functions that are square-integrable with respect to the measure formula_130. Also let
: formula_133
denote the conditional expectation operator on formula_134 Finally, let
: formula_135
denote the space of square-integrable functions with mean zero.

The &quot;ρ&quot;-mixing coefficients of the process {&quot;xt&quot;} are
: formula_136

The process is called &quot;ρ&quot;-mixing if these coefficients converge to zero as , and “&quot;ρ&quot;-mixing with exponential decay rate” if for some . For a stationary Markov process, the coefficients &quot;ρt&quot; may either decay at an exponential rate, or be always equal to one.

The &quot;α&quot;-mixing coefficients of the process are
: formula_137

The process is called α&quot;-mixing if these coefficients converge to zero as , it is &quot;&quot;α&quot;-mixing with exponential decay rate&quot; if for some , and it is α&quot;-mixing with a sub-exponential decay rate if for some non-increasing function formula_138 satisfying
: formula_139
as .

The &quot;α&quot;-mixing coefficients are always smaller than the &quot;ρ&quot;-mixing ones: , therefore if the process is &quot;ρ&quot;-mixing, it will necessarily be &quot;α&quot;-mixing too. However, when , the process may still be &quot;α&quot;-mixing, with sub-exponential decay rate.

The &quot;β&quot;-mixing coefficients are given by
: formula_140

The process is called β&quot;-mixing if these coefficients converge to zero as , it is β&quot;-mixing with an exponential decay rate if for some , and it is &quot;β&quot;-mixing with a sub-exponential decay rate if as for some non-increasing function formula_138 satisfying
: formula_139
as formula_143.

A strictly stationary Markov process is &quot;β&quot;-mixing if and only if it is an aperiodic recurrent Harris chain. The &quot;β&quot;-mixing coefficients are always bigger than the &quot;α&quot;-mixing ones, so if a process is &quot;β&quot;-mixing it will also be &quot;α&quot;-mixing. There is no direct relationship between &quot;β&quot;-mixing and &quot;ρ&quot;-mixing: neither of them implies the other.

<text>Sovereigntism, sovereignism or souverainism (from , , meaning &quot;the ideology of sovereignty&quot;) is the notion of having control over one&#x27;s conditions of existence, whether at the level of the self, social group, region, nation or globe. Typically used for describing the acquiring or preserving political independence of a nation or a region, a sovereigntist aims to &quot;take back control&quot; from perceived powerful forces, either against internal subversive minority groups (ethnic, sexual or gender), or from external global governance institutions, federalism and supranational unions. It generally leans instead toward isolationism, and can be associated with certain independence movements, but has also been used to justify violating the independence of other nations.

==Classification==
Sovereigntism has a cultural as well as political component and can take the form of hostility towards outsiders having different values or different countries or regions of origin. Sovereigntist groups are associated with populism since they typically claim legitimacy for carrying out the sovereign will of the people. While leftist sovereigntists tend to think of their national border as a defensive line against the corrosive effects of neo-liberal economics, right wing sovereigntists see it more as a filter protecting the sovereign people from undesired new members.

Though there are wide differences in ideology and historical context between sovereigntist movements, those of the twenty first century can be thought of as belonging to three separate categories: conservative sovereigntism, archeo-sovereigntism, and neo-sovereigntism. Conservative sovereignism embraces the national Westphalian model of sovereignty seeking to preserve the interstate order with norms promoting global economic order but halting further advances towards political integration. Some vestiges of colonialism remain, with old powers retaining what they see as historical special responsibilities to intervene in former possessions, such as in the case of Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine. Amongst rising powers, neo-sovereigntism is concerned with issues of autonomism, especially against more privileged nations with concentrated power in transnational entities such as the UN Security Council or G7. It seeks to strengthen norms and agreements protecting the independence of each state, granting their equality, and restraining more powerful states from attempts to influence the behavior of other nations. Archeo-sovereigntism is the most radical, rejecting forces of globalization and restraints on states by transnational bodies, norms and agreements, calling for a return to a pre- World War II order when states were freer from such interference. Examples in Europe include the National Rally in France, the Lega Nord in Italy, the Danish People&#x27;s Party in Denmark, and the UKIP in the UK.

In a paper published in the &quot;European Review of International Studies&quot; outlining these three major tendencies, researchers Alles and Badie summarised them thus: 
==Sovereigntist populist parties in Europe ==

In Europe, sovereigntist populisms political movements divide (on the one hand) between those that seek to leave the European Union completely (or oppose joining it) and (on the other), those who aim for a &quot;Europe of the nations&quot;, a less integrated Europe respecting the individual characteristics and sovereignty of constituent states. Supporters of these doctrines tend to regard themselves as Euro-realists opposed to the Euro-federalists and call for a more confederal version of a European Union. (The European Union is not a federation but shares many characteristics of one.) Thus, sovereigntism in Europe is opposed to federalism and typically involves nationalism, particularly in the United Kingdom (which withdrew from the EU in 2020) and in France where parties on the left and right margins lean strongly towards it.

=== European Union ===
After the 2024 European Parliament election 3 political groups of the European Parliament have been formed which contain sovereignist parties:

* European Conservatives and Reformists
* Europe of Sovereign Nations
* Patriots for Europe

=== France ===

* National Rally (right-wing nationalist) 
* The Patriots (Gaullist and right-wing nationalist)
* Popular Republican Union (Big tent Right-wing to Far-right politics)

=== Germany ===
Parties with tendencies that could be described also as sovereigntist can be also found in Germany:
* Alternative for Germany (right-wing, nationalist, conservative) 

=== Greece ===
Parties with tendencies that could be described also as sovereigntists can also be found in Greece:
* Golden Dawn (ethnic nationalist, neo-fascist) 
* Popular Orthodox Rally (ethnic nationalist, religious conservatism) 

=== Hungary ===

Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and his Fidesz party, in power since 2010, have increasingly followed a sovereigntist policy against the European Union. On December 12, 2023, the Hungarian National Assembly adopted the Sovereignty Protection Act, which creates a new government agency, called the Sovereignty Protection Office, to be established by February 1, 2024. It will have broad powers to investigate alleged attacks on Hungarian sovereignty, including the activities of civic organizations supported from abroad. 

=== Italy ===
* Five Star Movement (populist, left-wing populism) 
* Lega Nord (Conservatism, Populism, Euroscepticism) 
* Lega (Right-wing populism, Federalism) 
* Brothers of Italy (National conservatism, Right-wing populism) 

=== Romania ===
Three sovereigntist parties surpassed the 5% electoral threshold to enter the Parliament of Romania in the 2024 Romanian parliamentary election: the Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR), S.O.S. Romania and the Party of Young People (POT).

===Russia===

Since 2006, Vladimir Putin has espoused the current Russian sovereigntist view of a political, economic, and cultural battle between sovereign peoples of Russia on one side, and on the other- transnational institutions with their neoliberal and cosmopolitan ideologies undermining Russia&#x27;s sovereignty and cultural existence. In Putinism, the &quot;national wealth&quot; of the multiethnic Russian peoples (its morality, values, memory of its forefathers and its culture) both defines and is protected by its sovereignty. Putin advisor Vladislav Surkov articulated the threat to &quot;sovereign democracy&quot; posed by international organizations serving the interest of NATO, the OSCE, and the unipolar world order controlled by the United States. According to the ideology of Putinism, Georgian and Ukrainian sovereignty could not be respected since it had already been lost due to their color revolutions, seen as a collapse of borders protecting them from being engulfed culturally, economically and politically by Europe and the West. As a cultural and political protector against threatening Western powers, the idea of a sovereign union of multiple peoples under Russia&#x27;s leadership has been employed as a legitimation theory for imperial expansion. This usage predates the Soviet Union, tracing back to Pan-Slavism&#x27;s origins in the 16th century, later becoming integrated with Russian nationalism, imperialism and Orthodox messianism in the 19th century.

===Spain===
In the Parliament of Catalonia, parties explicitly supporting independence from Spain are Together for Catalonia (JxCat), heir of the former Democratic Convergence of Catalonia (CDC); Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC), and Popular Unity Candidacy (CUP).

=== United Kingdom ===
Parties with policies that could be described as sovereigntist can be also found in United Kingdom; notably by Reform UK and the Johnson-led Conservative Party (UK) (with respect to the European Union through hard Brexit), the Scottish National Party and (Party of Wales), and in Northern Ireland.

==North America==
=== Canada ===

In the Canadian province of Quebec, &quot;souverainisme&quot; or sovereigntism refers to the Quebec sovereignty movement, which argues for Quebec to separate from Canada and become an independent country. Many leaders in the movement, notably René Lévesque, have preferred the terms &quot;sovereignty&quot; and &quot;sovereigntist&quot; over other common names such as separatist or independentist, although this terminology may be objected to by opponents.

==== Quebec ====

* Parti Québécois (centre-left, nationalist and social democratic)
* Bloc Québécois (centre-left, nationalist and social democratic, represents Quebec separatism in Canada&#x27;s federal parliament)
* Option nationale (centre-left, nationalist and progressive)
* Québec solidaire (left-wing, democratic socialist)

===United States===
Coupled with its history of isolationism and sense of American exceptionalism, US sovereigntism is largely a conservative perspective, celebrating both American self-definition and liberty to engage in unilateral action. Sovereigntism in foreign policy is charactized by opposition to multilateral regimes relating to climate change, war crimes, arms control and international declaration of human rights.

The dominant US sovereigntist perspective is currently that of Trumpism and has three dimensions:
* World order and peace is best secured by sovereign states looking after themselves, as opposed to the rules-based international order of interdependent and integrated countries.
* The needs of the American people come first before any other concern of government. Any other prioritization violates the sovereignty of the people.
* Sovereigntism is used partisan weapon, where anyone who differs with Trumpian formulations of sovereignty are identified as political enemies.

A more extreme conservative view of popular sovereignty involves a radical unwinding of centralized government and an expansion of regional sovereignty, where freedoms are controlled at the local level, not adjudicated at the federal level. From the perspective of the Tea Party and continuing among followers of Trumpism, the populist concept of the sovereign people refers exclusively to a specifically defined community that &quot;invites people of different backgrounds to unite under a common &#x27;American&#x27; sense of self&quot;. Similar to the perspective of Putinism, those individuals who maintain a separate minority identity are not only excluded, but are regarded as a threat to the majority&#x27;s sovereignty, especially when they seek legal redress for violation of their human rights as defined by constitutional and international norms.

<text>Racists is a 2006 novel by Kunal Basu about a scientific experiment in the mid-19th century in which a white girl and a black boy are raised together as savages on a small uninhabited island off the coast of Africa. The long-term experiment is devised by the &quot;racists&quot; of the title, two rival scientists—one British, one French—to once and for all settle the question of racial superiority.

==Plot==
Two scientists decide to settle the question of racial superiority by leaving two children—a white girl and black boy—alone on an island to be raised without speaking by only a nurse, Norah. The British scientist Samuel Bates believes that the girl will emerge as the leader, while the French scientist Jean-Louis Belavoix believes that the two races can not live in peace and the children will ultimately murder each other. The experiment begins to run into problems when Bates and Belavoix argue about the validity of cranial measurements. Meanwhile, Bates&#x27;s long suffering assistant Nicholas Quartley falls in love with Norah and decides to rescue her from the island.

<text>Ada is a township in Dickey County, North Dakota, United States. Its population during the 2020 Census was 29, down from 60 in 2000. Its population in 1900 was 232.

==History==
Ada Township was first settled in the early 1880s. Originally part of Weston Township, which at the time covered two survey townships in Townships 129 and 130N, Range 61W.
Ada was organized around 1900 from the southern of the two townships and the northern one was renamed Kent Township.

The village of Silverleaf, built in 1887, is located 7 miles east of Ellendale, and was once the major population center in the township. The town reported around 25 residents in the late 1910s, and never seemed to exceed more than 50. It is little more than a ghost town today.

The village served a flag station for the Great Northern Railroad. Two conflicting stories exist over the origin of the name. Some say it is for the silverberry bushes found in the area, but others attribute the naming to a joke played by an early settler, Dan Keenan. Keenan reportedly removed the label from a tin of &quot;Silverleaf&quot; lard and nailed it to a boxcar parked at the station.

==Notable person==
John E. Skogland (1879 – 1940) was a member of the North Dakota House of Representatives from 1925 to 1926.

<text>Castle Donington is a market town and civil parish in Leicestershire, England, on the edge of the National Forest and close to East Midlands Airport.

==Etymology==
The name &#x27;Donington&#x27; means &#x27;farm/settlement connected with Dunna&#x27;. Another suggestion is that it could means &#x27;farm/settlement at the hill place&#x27;.

==History==
King&#x27;s Mill, the nearby crossing on the River Trent, is mentioned in a charter issued by Æthelred the Unready in 1009 regarding the boundaries of Weston-on-Trent. &quot;Dunintune&quot; or &quot;Dunitone&quot; is mentioned twice in the Domesday Book of 1086 as having land belonging to Countess Ælfgifu and land assigned to Earl Hugh. It is called &quot;Castoldonyngtoin&quot; in a duchy of Lancaster warrant of 1484.

In 1278, King Edward I granted a charter for a weekly market and an annual Wakes Fair. The Fair continues in Borough Street for three days each October.

Lace-making was an important industry up until the 1850s, when a sharp decline in the population is recorded. The population did not recover to the same level until a century later when in 1950 over 3,000 people are recorded as living in the village.

Bondgate, Borough Street, and Clapgun Street formed the nucleus of the historic village, with the Castle formerly standing at the eastern end of Borough Street on Castle Hill. It was abandoned and its stone used to build Donington Hall within Donington Park.

In the early 1960s local councils from Derby, Nottingham, and Leicester were seeking a suitable site to build an airport for the region. The former RAF Castle Donington, to the south of the village, was chosen and land purchased in the parishes of Kegworth, Hemington and Lockington to form an enclosed site now forming East Midlands Airport. The airport opened in 1965 and is now the tenth largest airport in the UK, the second-largest in terms of freight and cargo. The airport site is now an important economic center and a major employer in the area.
Castle Donington Power Station was built in 1958 as one of the largest coal-fired power stations in Europe. It was closed in September 1994 and demolished in 1996.

==Education==
Castle Donington has three primary schools, St Edwards, Foxbridge, and Orchard, the latter serving the majority of the children of the town. Castle Donington College, which welcomed KS4 for the first time in 2017, takes students from ages 11–16 and is the village&#x27;s only secondary school.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC East Midlands and ITV Central. Television signals are received from the Waltham TV transmitter. The town is served by both BBC Radio Leicester on 104.9 FM and BBC Radio Derby on 104.5 FM. Other radio stations including Capital East Midlands on 102.8 FM, Smooth East Midlands on 101.4 FM, Greatest Hits Radio Midlands on 106.0 FM, and Hermitage FM, a community based station which broadcast on 99.2 FM. The town is served by the local newspapers, &quot;Leicester Mercury&quot; and &quot;Derby Telegraph&quot; (formerly &quot;Castle Donington Messenger&quot;). &quot;Castle Donington Life&quot; is an independently owned local community magazine serving Castle Donington and surrounding areas. 

==Transport and housing==
Castle Donington stands on the former Nottingham to Birmingham trunk road. The town is a mix of the old and new, with modern shops mixed with dignified Georgian and Regency houses. Several timber-framed houses dating from the 17th century and earlier survive along the main road.

The town has no rail station, but East Midlands Parkway opened early in 2008 at Ratcliffe-on-Soar providing links on the Midland Main Line.

In 1868 the Midland Railway opened the Castle Donington Line, which included Castle Donington and Shardlow railway station, on the northern edge of the town. The station was closed to regular passenger traffic in 1930, and closed completely and demolished in 1968. The access driveway still exists but for pedestrians only, and is the start of a footpath to Hemington, running past the site of the old goods yard, now a scrap yard. The railway remains open for substantial flows of freight traffic as an alternative to the route via Derby.

==Economy==

East Midlands Airport is served by several airlines including Ryanair, Jet2.Com, Thomson Airways and Thomas Cook Airlines. The express parcels company DHL has a base at the airport. The now-defunct airline flybmi formerly had its head office at Pegasus Business Park on the airport grounds.

Donington Park motor racing circuit is located to the south west of the village.

The site of the former power station has been redeveloped in to a major retail distribution hub and warehousing area. The principal tenant is Marks and Spencer.

Since 2013 Norton Motorcycles has its head office in Donington Hall. BMI (British Midland), an airline, was headquartered in Donington Hall. The airline moved its headquarters to Donington Hall in 1982. The subsidiary bmibaby also had its head office in Donington Hall.

==Events==
The annual May Bank Holiday Medieval Market takes place in Borough Street and includes local stalls selling various kinds of produce and goods accompanied by dancing and music.

Donington Park was the original venue for the Monsters of Rock festivals through the 1980s and 1990s, and is now the home of the annual Download Festival. It also hosted a Formula One Grand PrixThe European Grand Prixin April 1993, which was won by Ayrton Senna. It was also set to be the home of the British Grand Prix from 2010 for at least 10 years, but the agreement was cancelled due to financial problems.

<text>Henry Croft (January 15, 1856 — July 28, 1917) was an Australian-born lumber and mining magnate on Vancouver Island from the 1880s to 1900s. Born in Australia, Croft moved to England at a young age and was educated there. He moved to Canada in 1883 and became involved in logging, purchasing the sawmill in Chemainus. Croft rose in prominence through his running of the mill, and further enhanced his standing by marrying a daughter of Robert Dunsmuir, a prominent industrialist on Vancouver Island. Croft was elected to the British Columbia Legislature in 1886, representing Cowichan, serving until 1894. He later became involved in mining on Mount Sicker, and founded the town of Crofton, British Columbia in 1902 as a place to house the smelter for mining. Croft is featured on the Netflix series &quot;Haunted&quot; (Season 3 Episode 2) wherein a family claims to have been haunted by his ghost.

==Biography==
Croft was born at Darling Point, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, the youngest of three children. His mother died when Croft was one, so his family moved to England. Croft attended Rugby School and then the Derby School of Mines. In 1883 he moved to Canada to join his brother Ted, who was then on Vancouver Island. Croft arrived in the town of Chemainus in July 1883 and began negotiating to purchase the sawmill there, seeing potential with the E&amp;N Railroad, agreeing to buy the mill in August for $22,000. It was here he met Mary Jean Dunsmuir, daughter of Robert Dunsmuir, a prominent coal miner in the region. Croft and Mary Jean were married on June 29, 1885. Though the wedding itself was small, guests included William Smithe, the Premier of British Columbia, and Theodore Davie, the Attorney-General. Once the E&amp;N Railroad finished construction in 1885, the demand for lumber dropped, and Croft sold his mill to Dunsmuir.

Croft bought of waterfront land in Victoria in November 1889 with plans to build a house there, which he named Mount Adelaide after his home in Australia. To help finance this he sold to subdivide into lots. Mount Adelaide was completed by 1891, though the financing had not worked out for Croft, who ended up nearly $45,000 in debt; part of his losses came from a real estate investment scam. His mother-in-law Joan Dunsmuir loaned him $20,000 to cover his losses, though by 1895 Croft still owed $58,000 and was forced to declare bankruptcy. A trust led by Joan took ownership of Mount Adelaide, who allowed Croft to remain living there, though Mary had to sign the agreement as Croft had no money.

In 1890, Croft was elected to the British Columbia Legislature with 146 votes, or 34.27% of the ballots, representing the Cowichan region. He served this post for the next four years.

He had developed the prosperous Lenora mine at Mount Sicker in 1898. By 1902, his mine was producing more ore than railway cars could load and haul away to the Ladysmith and Nanaimo ports. Inspired by significant profits, Croft bought a townsite near Mount Sicker and established the town of Crofton to build a copper smelter and house his workers. The smelter would last until 1908 when world copper prices fell, and while there were plans to build a large sawmill, it was never completed.

On July 28, 1917, Croft died at the age of 61 at his home, Mount Adelaide in Victoria from a brain hemorrhage. Mary died on August 15, 1928. They had no children.

==Association==
Croft was a member of many different societies as a result of his mining involvement:
*Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society
*Member of the Institute of Mining Engineers
*Member of the Institution of Civil Engineers

==Media==
Croft features on season 3, episode 2 of Netflix&#x27;s show, &quot;Haunted.&quot; Wyatt and his family lived in Croft&#x27;s home and experienced hostile ghostly interactions with Croft. He was seen first allowing his miners to perish after a dynamite incident. He is then seen smoking a cigar before terrorizing one of the family members further, such as pushing him down stairs and setting out fishing hooks as a trap to injure that family member— Wyatt. He is also suspected of causing the suicide of the previous tenant by his hostile actions.

<text>Wards 10 Best Engines is an annual list of the ten &quot;best&quot; automobile engines available in the U.S. market, that are selected by &quot;Wards AutoWorld&quot; magazine. The list was started in 1994 for model year 1995, and has been drawn every year since then, published at the end of the preceding year.

Engines must be available in regular-production vehicles on sale in the U.S. market no later than the first quarter of the year. Eligibility has also been based on availability in a vehicle below a base price limit, which increased progressively from for the 1995 list up to for the 2020 list; this limit was eliminated for future competitions following the announcement of the 2020 winners. During a 2-month testing period, Wards editors evaluate each engine according to a number of objective and subjective criteria in everyday driving situations – there is no instrumented testing. The selection takes into account power and torque output; noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) levels; technical relevance; and basic comparative numbers. Each engine competes against all others.

For the 2020 competition, the name was changed to Wards 10 Best Engines and Propulsion Systems.

<text>Rouen-Les-Essarts was a motor racing circuit in Orival, near Rouen, France.

From its opening in 1950, Rouen-Les-Essarts was recognized as one of Europe&#x27;s finest circuits, with modern pits, a wide track, and spectator grandstands. The street circuit (which ran on public roads) had a few medium straights, a cobbled hairpin turn (Nouveau Monde) at the southernmost tip, and a few blind corners through a wooded hillside The appeal was greatly enhanced by the climb from Nouveau Monde at to Gresil at , with gradients over 9%.

Rouen hosted five Formula One French Grand Prix races, the last one in 1968 resulting in the tragic burning death of Jo Schlesser, at the fast downhill Six Frères curve. The circuit continued to host major Formula 2 events until 1978, after which it was used for various French Championships.

The circuit had a number of different configurations. From its construction in 1950 until 1954 it was in length. In 1955 major works increased the circuit&#x27;s length to , its most famous configuration. Construction of a new Autoroute across the circuit saw a new section of track built and the length of the circuit reduced to . Finally, in 1974 a permanent chicane was built at Six Frères and this part of the circuit was renamed Des Roches.

The circuit was closed down in 1994 due to economic and safety reasons, since it is very hard to organize a race on public roads if modern safety standards are to be met. In 1999, following the circuit&#x27;s closure all evidence of area&#x27;s racing past was demolished, including grandstands, pits, Armco and track signs. The cobbled Nouveau Monde hairpin was also asphalted but it is still possible to drive around on the original circuit configuration.

The name &quot;Les Essarts&quot; comes from a village, which was included into the commune of Grand-Couronne in 1874.

<doc id="1308258" wikidata="Q2484904" url="?curid=1308258" title="Utpaladeva">
<text>Utpaladeva (c. 900–950 CE) was a Shaiva tantrik philosopher, theologian and poet from Kashmir. He belonged to the Trika Shaiva tradition and is a thinker of the Pratyabhijñā school of monistic idealism. His &quot;Īśvarapratyabhijñākārikā&quot; (IPK, &quot;Verses on the Recognition of the Lord&quot;) is a central text for the Pratyabhijñā school of Shaiva Hindu philosophy. Utpaladeva was also a tantrik guru and a religious bhakti poet, having authored the influential &quot;Śivastotrāvalī (A Garland of Hymns to Śiva)&quot;, a collection of Shaiva hymns that remain popular with Kashmiri Shaivas. 

Utpaladeva was a student of Somānanda (875–925 CE) and an influence on the exegete Abhinavagupta, whose works later overshadowed those of Utpaladeva. However, according to the Indologist Raffaele Torella &quot;most of Abhinavagupta’s ideas are just the development of what Utpaladeva had already expounded.&quot;

== Philosophy ==
Torella characterizes Utpaladeva&#x27;s philosophy as a &quot;unique blend of epistemology, metaphysics, religious experience, linguistic philosophy and aesthetic speculation.&quot;

In the chapter &quot;Jñānādhikāra&quot; of the &quot;Īśvarapratyabhijñā-Kārikā&quot;, Utpaladeva aims to establish the existence of a self by emphasizing one&#x27;s capacity of being a knowing subject. Utpaladeva points to memory, which is a cognitive event that takes place over an extended period of time. An element of current self-awareness is present at the moment of original cognition. The element at both points is a manifestation of a single consciousness and so have the same nature. Utpaladeva opposes a Buddhist explanation of memory that rejects a self. Buddhists explain memory without a permanent knowing self because past cognitions leave latent impressions (&quot;saṃskāras&quot;) on later cognitions. However, Utpaladeva counters that the original cognition is restricted to itself.

=== Theology ===
For Utpaladeva, the supreme reality, Shiva, is &quot;an absolute I&quot;, the atman, a singular subject or consciousness. As Torella notes, Utpaladeva constantly works to prove, contra the Buddhists, that there is &quot;a single, dynamic subject that unifies and animates the discontinuity of reality and constitutes the substratum of every limited subject, as well as of every form and activity of everyday life.&quot;

Utpaladeva&#x27;s view of God is stated in the &quot;Īśvarapratyabhijñā-Kārikā&quot;:There is only one Great Divinity, and it is the very inner Self of all creatures. It embodies itself as all things, full of unbroken awareness of three kinds: “I”, “this”, and “I am this.”According to Torella, another important and original contribution of Utpaladeva is his doctrine of &quot;abhasas&quot; (light, radiance, manifestations), which sees everything as radiant manifestations of the consciousness of Shiva which is their necessary foundation. Each &quot;manifestation&quot; is a kind of universal and is connected with a specific Sanskrit word. Torella also notes however that the term abhasa was not a new term &quot;but was commonly used in the Vedantic and Buddhist schools.&quot;

Torella explains Utpaladeva&#x27;s view of God as follows:This I or Consciousness is, on the religious plane, Siva. In his highest form, the supreme divine personality is solely &#x27;I&#x27; - consisting of consciousness and beatitude - in whom all the principles are contained though in a state of complete dissolution. He is present throughout the IPK as the ultimate essence of every reality and is also directly mentioned here and there, even if the stage is generally occupied by a less extreme form of him, which balances between transcendence and immanence. In fact, being an expository work, which requires an object to teach and a recipient of this teaching; it cannot but deal with that form of the God which is open to the world of manifestation, whilst firmly remaining its sovereign. On the supreme plane there is only the I resting in his fullness and no trace of the knowable remains...this more accessible form of the God is connected with the second level. It is mainly indicated as Mahesvara, Isvara, Isa, Prabhu, whereas the supreme form is often given the name of Siva or Paramesvara, but there certainly are exchanges between these two series - which indirectly points out the fact that it is a question of a sole reality and that every distinction of degree and figure is purely instrumental to the expository requirements.This supreme reality expresses itself through a scale of tattvas (reality) in a manner similar to that of Shaivasiddhanta philosophy (all the while remaining thoroughly monistic in character).

Utpaladeva also provided an argument for the existence of God (Ishvara) which was at least partly drawn on Nyaya sources. According to Isabelle Ratie, this argument states that &quot;the universe is an effect consisting of a specific arrangement that must have been created by an intelligent agent considered as its efficient cause.&quot; Furthermore, for Utpaladeva, given the complexity and harmony of the universe, this creator must be omniscient and omnipotent.

=== Recognition ===
As Torella notes, the key element in Utpaladeva&#x27;s theology of liberation is the idea of &quot;recognition&quot; (pratyabhijñā) and how to achieve it. This is none other than the act of recognizing that oneself is the supreme Shiva himself. As Torella explains, recognition is:merely the triggering in the devout of an act of identification, which does not reveal anything new but only rends the veils that hid the I from himself; a cognition is not created but only the blur that prevented its use, its entering into life, is instantly removed. The way by which the master creates the premises for this to occur may, on the contrary, be gradual: this is what Utp. does with his work, which aims through a series of arguments at bringing to light the powers of the I and those of the Lord, until identification is triggered. The practice of such a linear (avakra) path is enough to enter into the nature of Siva and achieve the condition of liberated in life, which may also be accompanied by the extraordinary powers...This occurs within everyday reality just as it is. The light of liberation does not cause its colours to fade, does not cover them but brightens them, performing the miracle of eliminating otherness whilst maintaining the richness of individual flavours.

=== The influence of Buddhism ===
Utpaladeva&#x27;s philosophy draws on and at the same time criticizes the work of the Buddhist Vijñanavada school of pramana, particularly that of Dharmakīrti. Torella writes that &quot;the criticism of their positions is to Utpaladeva of a substantial help in building and refining the Pratyabhijñā philosophy.&quot; While Utpaladeva agrees with the Buddhist critique of the Nyaya categories and uses many of their philosophical tools, he sees their system as lacking an understanding of the supreme lord Śiva, which is &quot;the omnipervasive dynamism of a free and “personal” consciousness.&quot;

Torella writes that Utpaladeva&#x27;s examination and criticism of the Dignaga-Dharmakirti school of Buddhism &quot;resulted in, or at least was accompanied by, the peculiar phenomenon of a more or less conscious absorption of their doctrines and their terminology, that was to leave substantial traces in the structure of the Pratyabhijñá.&quot; This may have also been a way for Utpaladeva to increase the prestige of his school by adopting some of the ways of a respected opponent. Some of the Buddhist ideas which are borrowed and developed by Utpaladeva are the theories of anupalabdhi and apoha.

=== The linguistic nature of reality ===
Utpaladeva also draws on the linguistic metaphysics of the grammarian Bhartr̥hari, which sees knowledge and reality as pervaded with language. Thus, for Utpaladeva, ultimate reality is a free consciousness that is also linguistic in nature. As Torella writes, Utpaladeva sees an &quot;inevitable presence of language at the heart of every cognitive activity.&quot;

As Utpaladeva states in some of the most famous verses of his &quot;Īśvarapratyabhijñā-Kārikā&quot;:
The essential nature of light is reflective awareness; otherwise light, though ‘coloured’ by objects, would be similar to an insentient reality, such as the crystal and so on. - I.V.11
Consciousness has as its essential nature reflective awareness; it is the supreme Word that arises freely. It is freedom in the absolute sense, the sovereignty of the supreme Self. - I.V.13

=== Other contributions ===
Utpaladeva had an universalistic view of scriptures and religion in general. According to Torella, for Utpaladeva, Āgama (scripture) is the voice of Shiva, and &quot;it comprises all the existing Āgamas, from the Vaiṣṇava to the Buddhist (the Śaiva included).&quot;

Utpaladeva also wrote on aesthetics. According to Torella, &quot;Precisely to Utpaladeva we do owe the entrance of aesthetics into philosophical–religious speculation. His concept of camatkāra (wondrous enjoyment) marks a higher level of experience, which leaves the reality and beauty of the manifested world intact, but at same time projects it into a totality whose centre is Supreme Consciousness.&quot;

<text>The Danishmendids or Danishmends () was a Turkoman Chepni founded beylik that ruled in north-central and eastern Anatolia from 1071/1075 to 1178. The dynasty centered originally around Sivas, Tokat, and Niksar in central-northeastern Anatolia, they extended as far west as Ankara and Kastamonu for a time, and as far south as Malatya, which they captured in 1103. In early 12th century, Danishmends were rivals of the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum, which controlled much of the territory surrounding the Danishmend lands, and they fought extensively against the Crusaders.

The dynasty was established by Danishmend Gazi for whom historical information is rather scarce and was generally written long after his death. His title or name, &quot;Dānishmand&quot; () means &quot;wise man&quot; or &quot;one who searches for knowledge&quot; in Persian.

== Origins ==
The Turkoman Chepni Danishmendid dynasty was founded by Danishmend Gazi. Sources about Danishmend Gazi&#x27;s origins however, are steeped in &quot;legendary flavor&quot;. According to Robert Irwin, Danishmend Gazi was a &quot;Turkoman emir of impenetrably obscure origins&quot;. For instance, according to Niketas Choniates, a Byzantine government official and historian and a near-contemporary of Danishmend Gazi, he was of Arsacid descent. According to the medieval Armenian historians Matthew of Edessa and Vardan Areveltsi, Danishmend Gazi was of Armenian origin, which, as Tahsin Yazici explains, &quot;is not incompatible with Niketas&#x27; report&quot;. Yazici adds that other historians explained his origins differently. Some identified him as a nephew of Malik-Shah I (1072–1092), Sultan of the Great Seljuk Empire. According to this narrative, Danishmend Gazi was sent by Malik-Shah to conquer Cappadocia. Others viewed Danishmend Gazi as a maternal uncle of Suleiman ibn Qutulmish (1077–1086), the first ruler of the Sultanate of Rum. In addition, some historians believed he was one of the Seljuq commanders who fought at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. According to Yazici: &quot;Osman Turan&#x27;s suggestion that he was a Seljuq envoy to the Ghaznavid court was based on a misunderstanding of a passage in Abu&#x27;l Fazl Bayhaqi&#x27;s &quot;Tarikh-i Bayhaqi&quot; and is thus totally erroneous&quot;. According to Robert Gregory Bedrosian (citing Suren Yeremian and Halil Yinanc), Danishmend Gazi was an Armenian Muslim. The &quot;Danishmendnâme&quot;, a 14th century (i.e. posthumous) epic romance based on oral traditions dealing with Danishmend Gazi, is likewise filled with &quot;legendary material&quot;. According to the &quot;Danishmendnâme&quot;, Danishmend Gazi was a native of Malatya.

==History==
===The dynasty===

As of 1134, Danishmend dynasty leaders also held the title &quot;Melik&quot; (&quot;the King&quot;) bestowed in recognition of their military successes by the Abbasid caliph Al-Mustarshid, although the Beys (&quot;Emirs&quot;) of Danishmend prior to 1134 may also be retrospectively referred to as &quot;Melik&quot;. Danishmend Gazi himself was alternatively called &quot;Danishmend Taylu&quot;.

The Danishmends established themselves in Anatolia in the aftermath of the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, in which the Seljuks defeated the Byzantine Empire and captured most of Anatolia. Gazi took advantage of the dynastic struggles of the Seljuks upon the death of the Sultan Suleyman I of Rûm in 1086 to establish his own dynasty in central Anatolia. The capital was likely first established in Amasia.

In 1100, Gazi&#x27;s son, Emir Gazi, captured Bohemond I of Antioch, who remained in their captivity until 1103. A Seljuk-Danishmend alliance was also responsible for defeating the Crusade of 1101.

In 1116, the Danishmends helped Mesud I become the Seljuk sultan.
In 1130, Bohemond II of Antioch was killed in a battle with Emir Gazi, after coming to the aid of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, which Gümüshtigin had invaded. Gümüshtigin died in 1134 and his son and successor Melik Mehmed Gazi did not have the martial spirit of his father and grandfather. He is nevertheless considered the first builder of Kayseri as a Turkish city, despite his relatively short period of reign.

When Mehmed died in 1142, the Danishmend lands were divided between his two brothers, Melik Yaghibasan, who maintained the title of &quot;Melik&quot; and ruled from Sivas, and Ayn el-Devle, who ruled from Malatya.

In 1155, Seljuk Sultan Kilij Arslan II attacked Melik Yaghibasan, who sought help from Nur ad-Din, the Zengid emir of Mosul. However, when Nur ad-Din died in 1174, the Sivas lands were incorporated into the Sultanate.

Following the death of Fahreddin in a riding accident in 1172, he was succeeded by his brother Afridun. By 1175, Nasreddin Muhammed had returned to power, and ruled as a Seljuk vassal. In 1178, Malatya was occupied. This event marked the end of the Danishmend rule, while the remaining Danishmends joined Seljuk service.

==Culture and legend==
Danishmend Gazi, the founder of the dynasty, is the central figure of a posthumous romance epic, &quot;Danishmendnâme&quot;, in which he is misidentified with an 8th-century Arab warrior, Sidi Battal Gazi, and their exploits intertwined.

Virtually all Danishmend rulers entered the traditions of the Turkish folk literature, where they are all referred to as &quot;Melik Gazi&quot;. Hence, there are &quot;tombs of Melik Gazi&quot;, many of which are much visited shrines and belong in fact to different Danishmend rulers, in the cities of Niksar, Bünyan, Kırşehir, along the River Zamantı near the castle of the same name (Zamantı) and elsewhere in Anatolia, and Melikgazi is also the name of one of the central districts of the city of Kayseri. The same uniformity in appellations in popular parlance may also apply to other edifices built by Danishmends.

The official title of the Danishmendids was &quot;Malik of All Romania and the East/Anatolia&quot;, was always inscribed in the local currency in Greek, indication of Byzantine influence. The Danishmend&#x27;s coins, along with being bilingual, included an image of a figure slaying a dragon, thought to represent St. George.

<doc id="1308294" wikidata="Q5452326" url="?curid=1308294" title="First Avenue (nightclub)">
<text>First Avenue and 7th St Entry are two historic music venues housed in the same landmark building in downtown Minneapolis. The nightclub sits on the corner of First Avenue North and 7th Street North, from which the venues get their names. The two are colloquially distinguished by locals as The Mainroom and The Entry.

The building was constructed in 1937 as the Minneapolis depot of the Greyhound Lines bus system and operated for 31 years. Allan Fingerhut purchased the facility in 1970 and converted it into a nightclub. During the 1980s, First Avenue flourished and became a landmark in the music and entertainment industry, playing a seminal role in establishing the &#x27;80s funk rock sub genre via the Minneapolis sound, and being the primary local venue for hometown star Prince. Since its rise to fame in the 1980s, First Avenue has hosted many notable local and national music acts. The building is marked by more than 400 large stars on its exterior commemorating these performers, along with other figures notable to the city.

The venue&#x27;s history and cultural significance has resulted in local and national recognition. Journalist David Carr wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that First Avenue&#x27;s cultural weight and history is matched by only a few clubs in the United States: CBGB, Maxwell&#x27;s, Metro Chicago and the 9:30 Club. It was also one of the first clubs to book Black performers in Minneapolis&#x27;s once largely segregated music scene.

The nightclub was featured in Prince&#x27;s commercially successful 1984 film, &quot;Purple Rain&quot;.

== History ==

=== Greyhound Lines Facility, opening ===
The building opened as a bus depot in 1937, decades after Greyhound Lines was founded in Hibbing, Minnesota. It was noted for its Art Deco style and amenities of air conditioning, shower rooms, and public telephones. The interior floor was checkered terrazzo, while the exterior was shiny blue bricks with white trim. The bus station moved to 10th Street in 1968, and moved again to Ramp B near Target Field in 2023.

The transformation from a bus depot into a concert venue has a disputed history. Clearly, Allan Fingerhut, heir to the Fingerhut mail-order merchandise company, had capital and invested $150,000, and Danny Stevens of the band Danny&#x27;s Reasons had a hard-to-get liquor license. Both men agree promoter Skip Goucher had the original idea for a nightclub in the bus depot.

They opened &quot;The Depot&quot; on 3 April 1970, with Joe Cocker and Mad Dogs &amp; Englishmen and a stage crowded with 27 musicians and singers who turned in two sets. Among Cocker&#x27;s Mad Dogs &amp; Englishmen that night were Leon Russell, Rita Coolidge, Claudia Lennear, Jim Keltner, Jim Price and Bobby Keys.

=== Disco era ===
Following two years of steady business, The Depot was faced with a new reality: the public music scene was changing. Psychedelic rock was out and disco was in. In order to stay on top of this new trend, the club needed to change its image. After a short remodel, &quot;The Depot&quot; in July 1972, evolved into &quot;Uncle Sam&#x27;s&quot;, a national franchise of the of Cincinnati. A red, white, and blue patriotic-themed club with recorded dance music, a drummer, a DJ, and a light-up plexiglass dance floor became what doorman Richard Luka described as, &quot;Studio 54 for the discriminating Kmart shopper.&quot; In about late 1973, Steve McClellan (who had become the club&#x27;s talent buyer and eventually general manager) started working at Uncle Sam&#x27;s as a bartender. He would enter American Avents&#x27; management training in 1975.

After left in 1979, general manager McClellan hired his former high school classmate Jack Meyers to help him manage money. Dan Lessard managed the bar staff. The club&#x27;s name was shortened to &quot;Sam&#x27;s&quot; in early 1980. The club got its third name change on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1981 when it became &quot;First Avenue&quot;.

=== 7th St Entry ===

The &quot;7th St Entry&quot; is a smaller stage (capacity 250) attached to the historic First Avenue (capacity 1500). This space was once a restaurant (the &quot;Greyhound Cafe&quot;) and later a coatroom, before staffer Danny Flies and McClellan spent $1,500 to turn it into a barebones music venue as part of Sam&#x27;s. Meyers donated his own Bose speakers for stage monitors. Like Jay&#x27;s Longhorn Bar and Duffy&#x27;s, the Entry catered to local bands, often too new to play the Mainroom.

The Entry opened its doors on 21 March 1980, with Cathy Mason fronting Wilma &amp; the Wilburs, who were first to play, as warmup for headliner Curtiss A.

=== &quot;Danceteria&quot; ===
Chrissie Dunlap began to work days in the office in 1979, about the time McClellan booked the Ramones and Pat Benatar in back-to-back, sell out concerts. Disc jockeys Kevin Cole and Roy Freedom developed weekend dance nights dubbed &quot;Danceteria&quot; inspired by the New York club of that name, often creating enough business to pay the club&#x27;s bills. The club has, through much of its existence, survived on the success of its dance nights. As EDM and rave culture grew in the 1990s, Cole mentored younger local DJs such as Woody McBride, DJ Apollo (Dory Kahalé) and E-Tones at Danceteria and other DJ nights such as House Nation Under a Groove and Depth Probe, helping to create a thriving and distinctive techno-music scene in the upper Midwest.
=== The Prince explosion ===
Discrimination had created a race barrier in the Minneapolis music scene. Encouraged by Dunlap to write their own material, Jimmy Jam and the 11-piece Mind &amp; Matter were able to break through with bookings by McClellan in the mid-1970s. First booking Black acts in the one-hit wonder Lipps, Inc., with lead singer Cynthia Johnson, McClellan decided to book Prince in 1981, for $2,500 plus part of the gate. Before he died in 2016, Prince was to play nine full First Avenue concerts. Over time, many of his fans thought he owned the club.

Recorded live in 1983 by a Record Plant truck parked outside at an August 1983 show, &quot;Purple Rain&quot; became the title of the film &quot;Purple Rain.&quot; Prince&#x27;s management team offered First Avenue $100,000 to use the mainroom for filming in late November into December 1983, with the clause that the Entry would remain open. Most of the club&#x27;s employees were extras in the film. The production gave the club its patch panel and dimmer packs. McClellan feared the audience had changed from genuine music lovers to a lot of tourists; still, he and Meyers were grateful for the boost in revenue.

=== Changes in ownership ===

The club was briefly closed by Fingerhut in late fall 2004 for financial reasons, causing a wave of protest from music fans. The issues were quickly resolved (the judge presiding in the bankruptcy case noted, &quot;I gather there is some urgency about this&quot;), and the club was reopened by new partners Meyers, McClellan, and former business manager Byron Frank, with shows resuming after one week&#x27;s closure. An experienced crowd surfer, Minneapolis mayor R.T. Rybak reneged on his promise to stage dive at the first show after reopening.

McClellan ended his 32-year stint at First Avenue in 2005, and began to focus on local music non-profit, the Diverse Emerging Music Organization (or DEMO). After McClellan&#x27;s departure as general manager, Jack Meyers was appointed to the position and continued until 2009, when Nathan Kranz took over. Dayna Frank took over for her father the same year.

==Notable events==
The nightclub has been the starting point for many acts that have come out of the Twin Cities, including Prince, The Replacements, Hüsker Dü, Soul Asylum, Semisonic, and Lizzo, among others.

Bands and artists have performed at the nightclub and influenced the Minneapolis music scene from 1970 onward, as exemplified by the silver stars that adorn the black building&#x27;s exterior (every star has the name of an artist who has played at First Avenue or 7th St Entry). First Avenue also appeared in Prince&#x27;s 1984 film &quot;Purple Rain&quot;, and many of the film&#x27;s music performances take place at the venue.

U2 wrote part of &quot;October&quot; at First Avenue, during sound check.

Grammy Award-winning alternative-country star Lucinda Williams was married on stage following a performance at First Avenue in 2009.

Gwar guitarist Cory Smoot played his last performance at the venue on 3 November 2011—he died just hours afterward.

The club was named in &quot;Playboy&quot; Magazine&#x27;s Guide to Best Nightclubs in the World at #15 out of 20 in the November 2013 issue.

During the Theory of a Deadman concert on 12 August 2015, part of the ceiling collapsed, pulling down part of the sprinkler pipes. Three people were slightly injured, two of whom were taken to the hospital.

The non-profit Developing Music and Arts Foundation (DMAF) was founded by the club in 1999. It was rechristened The Diverse Emerging Music Organization (DEMO) in 2004 as an independent entity.

==Productions==
In 1970, The Depot recorded the first live album from the venue, titled &quot;Gathering at The Depot&quot;, featuring artists such as Danny’s Reasons and The Litter.

Daniel Corrigan is a First Avenue photographer since 1981 whose work fills the book &quot;Heyday&quot;. Later after the advent of ubiquitous digital photography, he became an employee in the facilities department, and made a series of under-two minute videos for the Minnesota Historical Society describing his photos.

Local Minnesota band Trampled by Turtles released their album &quot;Live at First Avenue&quot; in November 2014.

First Avenue &amp; 7th St Entry published a promotional book in 2000, &quot;First Avenue &amp; 7th Street Entry: Your Downtown &#x27;Danceteria&#x27; Since 1970&quot;. The book was written, edited and designed by Rebecca Noran; and contains information on the history of the club. Furthermore, the club published a magazine entitled &quot;First Avenue In House&quot; for a brief time from September 1998 to August 2000.

In November 2005, First Avenue released its first compilation CD celebrating 35 years of history. The 16 track CD, &quot;Bootlegs Volume 1&quot;, is a collection of songs recorded in either the mainroom or the 7th St Entry. Most of the songs on the CD were &quot;bootlegged&quot;, thus forming the title of the CD. &quot;Bootlegs&quot; was produced by Karrie Vrabel, with the liner notes written by Steve McClellan. All the proceeds of the CD go to McClellan&#x27;s non-profit organization, DEMO. The goals of his organization are &quot;to support musicians while promoting gender equity; diversity of music style and genre; diversity of musicians from local communities; careers in all stages of establishment; and the staging of performances with high production values.&quot;

First Avenue is also home to F1RST Wrestling, a local professional wrestling company currently owned by professional wrestler Arik Cannon. It showcases Minnesota&#x27;s top wrestling talent and brings in bigger names, including Sean Waltman, Jerry Lynn, Tyler Black, Colt Cabana and others. F1RST Wrestling currently holds its WRESTLEPALOOZA events at First Avenue which feature a combination of pro wrestling, live music and burlesque.

<text>Sidekicks is a 1992 American adventure action comedy-drama film directed by Aaron Norris and starring Jonathan Brandis, Mako, Julia Nickson-Soul, Beau Bridges, and Chuck Norris.

==Plot==
Barry Gabrewski is a troubled and bullied asthmatic boy who lives with his widowed father, Jerry (Beau Bridges), in Houston, Texas. A loner, Barry has vivid daydreams about being Chuck Norris&#x27; sidekick, and about battling against Norris&#x27; movie enemies. Said foes are often personified by Barry&#x27;s everyday nemeses, such as class bully Randy Cellini (John Buchanan); Coach Horn (Richard Moll), their loudmouthed and demanding PE instructor; and apathetic Principal Mapes (Gerrit Graham). Noreen Chan (Julia Nickson-Soul), Barry&#x27;s favorite teacher, often plays the damsel-in-distress in these daydreams, most of which parody assorted Chuck Norris films (notably &quot;Missing in Action&quot;, &quot;The Delta Force&quot;, and &quot;The Hitman&quot;).

Barry wants to learn martial arts, yet he is rejected by arrogant dojo-master Kelly Stone (Joe Piscopo)who also happens to be Randy&#x27;s senseifor being too weak. Instead, he is taken on as a student by an old Chinese man named Mr. Lee (Mako), Noreen&#x27;s sly uncle and the owner of a local Chinese restaurant, &quot;Frying Dragon&quot;. Mr. Lee finds creative ways of teaching Barry to defend himself from bullies; he devises training methods that increase Barry&#x27;s endurance, thus helping the boy&#x27;s asthma. Lee also deduces Barry&#x27;s hero-worship of Norris from Barry&#x27;s daydreams; he creatively incorporates this into Barry&#x27;s training, devising scenarios that seem more dangerous than they are so that Barry will feel heroic for succeeding at them.

Lee enters himself, Barry, and Chan into a local team Karate tournament but is a bit stymied to learn that a team must have four members. Norris is attending the tournament as a guest and, at Lee&#x27;s urging, Chan convinces Norris to join the team. Norris is both willing to help an ardent fan and has his own motivation for participating: he has encountered Stone on several occasions and wants to teach him &quot;a lesson in humility&quot;. Barry is stunned to find himself working together with his hero.

The tournament involves four events: Breaking, Men&#x27;s Weapons, Female Kata, and Freestyle fighting. Stone&#x27;s team narrowly defeats Chan in the Female Kata, but Lee defeats Cellini, one of Stone&#x27;s students, in Breaking. True to his word, Norris defeats Stone in Freestyle fighting, and Barryaided by a vivid daydreamscores a victory in Men&#x27;s Weapons. The result is a tie between Stone&#x27;s team and Lee&#x27;s team. In the tie-breaker, Lee is allowed to choose the participants, and chooses Barry and Cellini, saying Barry is the member of the team with &quot;something to prove&quot;. Stone chooses the event, Breaking. Barry is dismayed to be confronting Cellini in the latter&#x27;s best event, but Lee tilts the odds in Barry&#x27;s favor by using a small amount of lighter fluid to set Barry&#x27;s bricks on fire. Faced with a much more heroic-seeming task, Barry wins.

After the tournament, Barry is seen talking to Norris, thanking him for his help. Norris vanishes, and it is implied that Barry has found the strength to live his life without the need for his daydreams. A young boy in a wheelchair finds Barry&#x27;s Chuck Norris magazine and reacts with an excited &quot;Wow!&quot;

<text>Ānandavardhana (c. 820 – 890 CE) was a Kashmiri court poet and literary critic, honored with the title of Rajanak during King Avantivarman&#x27;s reign. Anandavardhana authored the &quot;Dhvanyāloka&quot;, or &quot;A Light on Suggestion&quot; (&quot;dhvani&quot;), a work articulating the philosophy of &quot;aesthetic suggestion&quot; (&quot;dhvani&quot;, &quot;vyañjanā&quot;).

Ānandavardhana is credited with creating the &quot;dhvani&quot; theory. He wrote that &quot;dhvani&quot; (meaning sound, or resonance) is the &quot;soul&quot; or &quot;essence&quot; (&quot;ātman&quot;) of poetry (&quot;kavya&quot;).&quot; &quot;When the poet writes,&quot; said Ānandavardhana, &quot;he creates a resonant field of emotions.&quot; To understand the poetry, the reader or hearer must be on the same &quot;wavelength.&quot; The method requires sensitivity on the parts of the writer and the reader. The complete &quot;Dhvanyāloka&quot; together with Abhinavagupta&#x27;s commentary on it has been translated into English by the Sanskritist Daniel H.H. Ingalls and his collaborators.

Ānandavardhana is mentioned in Kalhana&#x27;s Rajatarangini. He was noted to not have cited or commented on Daṇḍin&#x27;s work, instead preferring Bhamaha or Udbhata.

== &quot;Dhvanyāloka&quot; ==
Anandavardhana classifies three categories of poetry: 

# Dhvani kavya (prominence of suggestion)
# Gunibhuta vyangakavya (secondary place of suggestion)
# Chitra kavya (portrait like - absence of suggestion)

He categorizes Dhvani kavya as the best form of poetry, Gunibhuta vangiya kavya as the second class and the third or lowest class is said to be Chitra kavya.

The philosopher Abhinavagupta (c. 950 – 1016 CE) wrote an important commentary on &quot;Dhvanyāloka&quot; titled the &quot;Locana&quot;, or &quot;The Eye&quot;.

==Assessment by Modern Sanskritists==
Modern Sanskritists have a very high opinion of Ānandavardhana. Commenting on Ānandavardhana&#x27;s &quot;Dhvanyāloka&quot;, P.V. Kane writes that &quot;the Dhvanyāloka is an epoch-making work in the history of Alaṅkāra literature. It occupies the same position in poetics as Pāṇini&#x27;s Aṣtādhyāyī in grammar and Śaṅkarācarya&#x27;s commentary on Vedānta&quot;. Daniel H.H. Ingalls calls Ānandavardhana &quot;the most brilliant of all Sanskrit critics&quot;.

Sushil Kumar De, along with Kane, considered there to be no work similar to the &quot;Dhvanyaloka&quot; in the corpus of Sanskrit literature. Franklin Edgerton and Louis Renou also considered the work to ge exceptional in its treatment of poetic theory and aesthetics.

Lawrence McCrea considers the &quot;Dhvanyaloka&quot; to be influenced by Mīmāṃsā, particularly by how it approached an exegesis of the Vedas.

<doc id="1308318" wikidata="Q1542121" url="?curid=1308318" title="Grandmontines">
<text>Grandmontines were the monks of the Order of Grandmont, a religious order founded by Saint Stephen of Thiers, towards the end of the 11th century. The order was named after its motherhouse, Grandmont Abbey in the eponymous village, now part of the commune of Saint-Sylvestre, in the department of Haute-Vienne, in Limousin, France. They were also known as the &quot;Boni Homines&quot; or &quot;Bonshommes&quot;.

==Founding==
The exact date of the foundation of the order is very uncertain. The traditional story involves serious chronological difficulties, and is based on a bull of Gregory VII, now known to be a forgery. The founder, St. Stephen of Muret (Étienne in French; also called &#x27;of Thiers&#x27;) was so impressed by the lives of the hermits whom he saw in Calabria that he desired to introduce the same manner of life into his native country.

Stephen, being ordained, in 1073 obtained the Pope&#x27;s permission to establish an order. He is said to have settled in Muret near Limoges in 1076, where he made himself a hut of branches of trees and lived there for some time in complete solitude. A few disciples gathered round him, and a community was formed. The Order of Grandmont has been claimed by both Benedictines and Canons Regular as a branch of their respective institutes, although the Grandmontines always maintained that they were hermits.

They tended to seek out woodlands and uplands to situate their monasteries. The architecture of the order of Grandmont is notable for its simplicity. A single barrel vaulted nave with a slightly wider apse. Three windows at the east and one at the west. The entry to the church, in most surviving cases, is in the northwest side.

==The Rule==
The so-called &quot;Rule of St. Stephen&quot; was compiled at the request of the fourth prior, Étienne de Liciac, by Hugh of Lacerta, and embodies the customs of Grandmont some twenty or thirty years after St. Stephen&#x27;s death in 1124. The founder himself left no authentic writings. His maxim was &quot;There is no rule save the Gospel of Christ&quot;; as this was the basis of all rules, to practise its morality was to fulfil all the duties of a good religious. The life was eremitical and very severe in regard to silence, diet and bodily austerities; it was modelled after the rule of the Camaldolese, but various regulations were adopted from the Augustinian canons. The superior was called the &quot;Corrector&quot;. The early Grandmontines were noted for their extreme austerity. Poverty was most strictly observed; the rule forbade the possession of lands, cattle, revenue, or impropriate churches. So concerned were the Grandmontines regarding simoniacal entry that in the customary composed about 1170, it was forbidden to ask a candidate seeking to join, about bringing money, or buying clothes, or equipment for a horse. Begging was only permitted when there was no food in the house, and even then the local bishop was first to be informed of their state. Although discipline was severe, the rule of silence was relatively lenient.

They developed a reputation for simplicity of life and generosity to the poor, along with an emphasis on hospitality. They acquired the nickname the &quot;Bonshommes&quot;.

==Zenith==

After the founder&#x27;s death in 1124, sometime around 1150, having been compelled to leave Muret due to disputed ownership, the hermits settled in the neighboring desert of Grandmont, whence the order derived its name. The influence of the Grandmontines reached its height in the twelfth century. Under Étienne de Liciac the order spread rapidly, and in 1170 numbered sixty monasteries, mostly in Aquitaine, Anjou and Normandy. Under his successor, Bernard de Boschiac, eighty new foundations were made, and the &quot;bons hommes&quot; were to be found in nearly every diocese of France.

Their holy austerity roused the admiration of all beholders, and the kings of England and France vied with one another in bestowing favours upon them. Henry II of England had the monastery rebuilt, and King St. Louis IX of France erected a Grandmontine house at Vincennes near Paris. There were three Grandmontine monasteries in England: Alberbury in Shropshire, Craswall in Herefordshire, and Grosmont Priory in North Yorkshire.

The system of lay brothers was introduced on a large scale, and the management of the temporals was in great measure left in their hands; the arrangement did not work well.

==Decline==
The golden age of Grandmont however lasted only sixty years after the founder&#x27;s death. After then, the history of the order is an almost uninterrupted series of disputes, as quarrels between two categories of monks were a constant source of dissension. Even in the twelfth century, the ill-defined position of the lay brothers caused troubles. They were far more numerous than the choir-monks, and were given entire control of all temporalities so the latter might be free to carry on spiritual duties. Gradual relaxation of the rules of poverty led to great possessions, and thus increased the importance of the lay brothers, who now claimed equality with the choir-monks. This led to scandalous scenes. The political situation embittered these dissensions, the order being divided into two parties, French and English. Successive popes tried to restore peace, but in vain. In 1219 the prior of Grandmont and forty monks were again expelled by the rebellious lay brothers. In 1244 the papal delegates advised a union of the order with the Cistercians as a means of ending the disputes. This threat and the expulsion of a large number of monks produced a certain degree of peace. Numbers, however, declined; about 1150, the order had over 1200 members, but towards the beginning of the fourteenth century only 800. Moreover, a relaxation of the rule (1224) led finally to the cessation of all observance.

In 1317 Pope John XXII, sometimes said to have been a Grandmontine monk, issued the papal bull &quot;Exigente debito&quot; to save the order from complete destruction. Its organization was altered and certain mitigations were approved. The number of houses was reduced from 149 to 39. The prior of Grandmont was made an abbot, and the superiors of the dependent houses, who had hitherto been known as &quot;Correctors&quot;, were for the future to bear the title of Prior. The Abbot of Grandmont was to be elected by his own community, and not, as before, by the deputies of the whole order. A general chapter, to be attended by the prior and one monk from each dependent house, was to be held annually.

These vigorous measures brought about a slight recovery, but in spite of the vigilance of the Holy See and the good administration of the first abbots, the improvement was of short duration. The order suffered severely during the Hundred Years&#x27; War. From 1471 until 1579 Grandmont was held by commendatory abbots; shortly after the latter date there were only eight monks in the monastery. On one occasion, the abbey was seized by the Huguenots, but in 1604 these were expelled by Abbot Rigaud de Lavaur.

==The Strict Observance==
In 1643 Abbot Georges Barny (1635–1654) held a general chapter, the first for 134 years, at which Charles Frémon was authorised to found the Strict Observance of the Order of Grandmont. This new branch, which remained under the jurisdiction of the abbot, was conspicuous for the primitive austerity of its observance, but never numbered more than eight houses.

By the beginning of the eighteenth century the two Observances together numbered only about 150 members, but the quarrels were as frequent and as bitter as ever. Grandmont was one of the first victims of the Commission des Réguliers. The monks of the Strict Observance were dispersed in 1780, but the struggle for existence was prolonged until 1787, when the last abbot died. The monastery was finally destroyed at the beginning of the nineteenth century, and nothing but a few fragments of wall now remains.

==Legacy==

Apart from a number of lives of St. Stephen, the most important work issuing from Grandmont was Gérard Ithier&#x27;s treatise &quot;De institutione novitiorum&quot;—a favourite spiritual work in the Middle Ages, usually but erroneously attributed to Hugh of St. Victor.

The original habit of Grandmont was a coarse tunic with scapular and hood, brown in the early days but changed later to black. The monks gradually laid aside the humble scapular and hood in favour of rochet and biretta. The original habit was resumed by the Strict Observance. The founder had expressly forbidden the reception into the order of houses of religious women, nevertheless four small monasteries of women in the Diocese of Limoges were admitted.

Outside France the order only possessed five houses: two in Navarre (Spain) and three cells in England up to the middle of the 15th century. These latter were Alberbury, Craswall and Grosmont Priories, and as usual in Grandmontine monasteries, were occupied by a very small number of monks.

Later centuries witnessed mitigations and reforms in the life, and at last the order was suppressed just before the French Revolution.
In 1979 the former Grandmontine priory of Sainte-Trinité de Grandmont of Villiers was to become the home of a small group intent on restoring the Grandmontine life style; with the permission of the local bishop they began to attempt the restoration of the principles of S. Stephen&#x27;s monastic life, in the modern world.(Hutchison, Carole A.)

The Grandmontines featured in an episode of the popular BBC TV drama &quot;Bonekickers&quot; entitled Army of God.

<doc id="1308330" wikidata="Q24783855" url="?curid=1308330" title="Thymidine kinase">
<text>Thymidine kinase is an enzyme, a phosphotransferase (a kinase): 2&#x27;-deoxythymidine kinase, ATP-thymidine 5&#x27;-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.21. It can be found in most living cells. It is present in two forms in mammalian cells, TK1 and TK2. Certain viruses also have genetic information for expression of viral thymidine kinases.
Thymidine kinase catalyzes the reaction:
:Thd + ATP → TMP + ADP
where Thd is (deoxy)thymidine, ATP is adenosine triphosphate, TMP is (deoxy)thymidine monophosphate and ADP is adenosine diphosphate.
Thymidine kinases have a key function in the synthesis of DNA and therefore in cell division, as they are part of the unique reaction chain to introduce thymidine into the DNA. Thymidine is present in the body fluids as a result of degradation of DNA from food and from dead cells. Thymidine kinase is required for the action of many antiviral drugs. It is used to select hybridoma cell lines in production of monoclonal antibodies. In clinical chemistry it is used as a proliferation marker in the diagnosis, control of treatment and follow-up of malignant disease, mainly of hematological malignancies.

==History==

The incorporation of thymidine in DNA was demonstrated around 1950. Somewhat later, it was shown that this incorporation was preceded by phosphorylation, 
and, around 1960, the enzyme responsible was purified and characterized.

== Classification ==

Two different classes of thymidine kinases have been identified and are included in this super family: one family groups together thymidine kinase from herpesvirus as well as cellular thymidylate kinases, the second family groups TK from various sources that include, vertebrates, bacteria, the bacteriophage T4, poxviruses, African swine fever virus (ASFV) and Fish lymphocystis disease virus (FLDV). The major capsid protein of insect iridescent viruses also belongs to this family. The Prosite pattern recognizes only the cellular type of thymidine kinases.

== Isozymes ==

Mammals have two isoenzymes, that are chemically very different, TK1 and TK2. The former was first found in fetal tissue, the second was found to be more abundant in adult tissue, and initially they were termed fetal and adult thymidine kinase. Soon it was shown that TK1 is present in the cytoplasm only in anticipation of cell division (cell cycle-dependent), whereas TK2 is located in mitochondria and is cell cycle-independent. The two isoenzymes have different reaction kinetics and are inhibited by different inhibitors.

The viral thymidine kinases differ completely from the mammalian enzymes both structurally and biochemically and are inhibited by inhibitors that do not inhibit the mammalian enzymes. The genes of the two human isoenzymes were localized in the mid-1970s. The gene for TK1 was cloned and sequenced. The corresponding protein has a molecular weight of about 25 kD. Normally, it occurs in tissue as a dimer with a molecular weight of around 50 kD. It can be activated by ATP. After activation, is a tetramer with a molecular weight around 100 kD. However, the form of enzyme present in the circulation does not correspond to the protein as encoded by the gene: the main fraction of the active enzyme in the circulation has a molecular weight of 730 kD and is probably bound in a complex to other proteins. This complex is more stable and has a higher specific activity than any of the lower molecular weight forms.

Recombinant TK1 cannot be activated and converted to a tetramer in this way, showing that the enzyme occurring in cells has been modified after synthesis.

TK1 is synthesized by the cell during the S phase of cell division. After cell division is completed, TK1 is degraded intracellularly and does not pass to body fluids after normal cell division. There is a feed-back regulation of the action of thymidine kinase in the cell: thymidine triphosphate (TTP), the product of the further phosphorylation of thymidine, acts as an inhibitor to thymidine kinase. This serves to maintain a balanced amount of TTP available for nucleic acid synthesis, not oversaturating the system. 5&#x27;-Aminothymidine, a non-toxic analogue of thymidine, interferes with this regulatory mechanism and thereby increases the cytotoxicity of thymidine analogues used as antineoplastic drugs. The reaction kinetics of thymidine and thymidine analogues phosphorylation is complicated and only partly known. The overall phosphorylation of thymidine to thymidine triphosphate does not follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and the various phosphates of thymidine and uridine interfere with the phosphorylation of each other. The kinetics of TK from different species differ from each other&#x27;s and also the different forms from a given species (monomer, dimer, tetramer and serum form) have different kinetic characteristics.

Genes for virus specific thymidine kinases have been identified in Herpes simplex virus, Varicella zoster virus and Epstein-Barr virus.

 + ATP →
 + ADP

Thymidine reacts with ATP to give thymidine monophosphate and ADP.

== Function ==

Thymidine monophosphate, the product of the reaction catalyzed by thymidine kinase, is in turn phosphorylated to thymidine diphosphate by the enzyme thymidylate kinase and further to thymidine triphosphate by the enzyme nucleoside diphosphate kinase. The triphosphate is included in a DNA molecule, a reaction catalyzed by a DNA polymerase and a complementary DNA molecule (or an RNA molecule in the case of reverse transcriptase, an enzyme present in retrovirus).

Thymidine monophosphate is also produced by the cell in a different reaction by methylation of deoxyuridine monophosphate, a product of other metabolic pathways unrelated to thymidine, by the enzyme thymidylate synthase. The second route is sufficient to supply thymidine monophosphate for DNA repair. When a cell prepares to divide, a complete new set-up of DNA is required, and the requirement for building blocks, including thymidine triphosphate, increases. Cells prepare for cell division by making some of the enzymes required during the division. They are not normally present in the cells and are downregulated and degraded afterwards. Such enzymes are called salvage enzymes. Thymidine kinase 1 is such a salvage enzyme, whereas thymidine kinase 2 and thymidylate synthase are not cell cycle-dependent.

== Deficiency ==

Thymidine kinase 2 is used by the cells for synthesis of mitochondrial DNA. Mutations in the gene for TK2 lead to a myopathic form of mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome. Another reason for TK 2 deficiency may be oxidative stress induced S-glutathionylation and proteolytic degradation of mitochondrial thymidine kinase 2. No syndrome caused by TK1 deficiency is known, probably as a defective TK1 gene would lead to fetal death.

== Thymidine kinase during development ==

The formation of tetramer after modification of thymidine kinase 1 after synthesis enhances the enzyme activity. It has been suggested that this is a mechanism for regulation of the enzyme activity. The formation of tetramers is observed after the Dictyostelium development stage. Its use for fine regulation of DNA synthesis is suggested to have been established in warm blooded animals after they branched out from the vertebrates. Also the development of thymidine kinase like enzymes in the development has been studied.

== Species distribution ==

Thymidine kinase is present in animals, plants, some bacteria, archeans and virus. The thymidine kinases from pox viruses, African swine fever virus, Herpes simplex virus, Varicella zoster virus and Epstein- Barr virus have been identified and to a varying degree characterized. The enzyme form in virus is different from that in other organisms. Thymidine kinase is not present in fungi.

== Applications ==

=== Identification of dividing cells ===

The first indirect use of thymidine kinase in biochemical research was the identification of dividing cells by incorporation of radiolabeled thymidine and subsequent measurement of the radioactivity or autoradiography to identify the dividing cells. For this purpose tritiated thymidine is included in the growth medium. In spite of errors in the technique, it is still used to determine the growth rate of malignant cells and to study the activation of lymphocytes in immunology.

=== PET scan of active tumors ===

Fluorothymidine is a thymidine analog. Its uptake is regulated by thymidine kinase 1, and it is therefore taken up preferentially by rapidly proliferating tumor tissue. The fluorine isotope 18 is a positron emitter that is used in positron emission tomography (PET). The fluorine-18 radiolabeled fluorothymidine F-18 is therefore useful for PET imaging of active tumor proliferation, and compares favorably with the more commonly used marker fludeoxyglucose (18F). A standardized protocol that will help comparison of clinical studies has been suggested.

=== Selection of hybridomas ===

Hybridomas are cells obtained by fusing tumor cells (which can divide infinitely) and immunoglobulin-producing lymphocytes (plasma cells). Hybridomas can be expanded to produce large quantities of immunoglobulins with a given unique specificity (monoclonal antibodies). One problem is to single out the hybridomas from the large excess of unfused cells after the cell fusion. One common way to solve this is to use thymidine kinase negative (TK−) tumor cell lines for the fusion. The thymidine kinase negative cells are obtained by growing the tumor cell line in the presence of thymidine analogs, that kill the thymidine kinase positive (TK+) cells. The negative cells can then be expanded and used for the fusion with TK+ plasma cells. After fusion, the cells are grown in a medium with methotrexate or aminopterin that inhibit the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase thus blocking the de novo synthesis of thymidine monophosphate. One such medium that is commonly used is HAT medium, which contains hypoxanthine, aminopterin and thymidine. The unfused cells from the thymidine kinase-deficient cell line die because they have no source of thymidine monophosphate. The lymphocytes eventually die because they are not &quot;immortal.&quot; Only the hybridomas that have &quot;immortality&quot; from their cell line ancestor and thymidine kinase from the plasma cell survive. Those that produce the desired antibody are then selected and cultured to produce the monoclonal antibody. Hybridoma cells can also be isolated using the same principle as described with respect to another gene the HGPRT, which synthesizes IMP necessary for GMP nucleotide synthesis in the salvage pathway.

=== Study of chromosome structure ===

Molecular combing of DNA fibers can be used to monitor the structure of chromosomes in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This provides DNA replication profiles of individual molecules. This requires that the yeast strains express thymidine kinase, which wild type yeasts do not, being fungi (see occurrence). Therefore, a gene for thymidine kinase must be incorporated in the genome.

=== Clinical chemistry ===

Thymidine kinase is a salvage enzyme that is only present in anticipation of cell division. The enzyme is not set free from cells undergoing normal division where the cells have a special mechanism to degrade the proteins no longer needed after the cell division. In normal subjects, the amount of thymidine kinase in serum or plasma is therefore very low. Tumor cells release enzyme to the circulation, probably in connection with the disruption of dead or dying tumor cells. The thymidine kinase level in serum therefore serves as a measure of malignant proliferation, indirectly as a measure of the aggressivity of the tumor.

===Therapeutic applications ===

Some drugs are specifically directed against dividing cells. They can be used against tumors and viral diseases (both against retrovirus and against other virus), as the diseased cells replicate much more frequently than normal cells and also against some non-malignant diseases related to excessively rapid cell replication (for instance psoriasis). It has been suggested that the antiviral and anti-cancer activity of thymidine analogues is, at least partly, achieved by down-regulation of mitochondrial thymidine kinase.

====Cytostatics ====

There are different classes of drugs directed against thymidine metabolism and thereby involving thymidine kinase that are used to control cancer associated cell division. Chain terminators are thymidine analogues that are included in the growing DNA chain, but modified so that the chain cannot be further elongated. As analogs of thymidine, this type of drugs are readily phosphorylated to 5&#x27;-monophosphates. The monophosphate is further phosphorylated to the corresponding triphosphate and incorporated in the growing DNA chain. The analog has been modified so that it does not have the hydroxyl group in the 3&#x27;-position that is required for continued chain growth. In zidovudine (AZT; ATC:J05AF01) the 3&#x27;-hydroxyl group has been replaced by an azido group, in stavudine (ATC: J05AF04) it has been removed without replacement. AZT is used as substrate in one of the methods for determination of thymidine kinase in serum. This implies that AZT interferes with this method and may be a limitation: AZT is a standard component of HAART therapy in HIV infection. One common consequence of AIDS is lymphoma and the most important diagnostic application of thymidine kinase determination is for monitoring of lymphoma.

Other thymidine analogues, for instance Idoxuridine (ATC: J05AB02) act by blocking base pairing during subsequent replication cycles, thereby making the resulting DNA chain defective. This may also be combined with radioactivity to achieve apoptosis of malignant cells.

==== Antivirals ====

Some antiviral drugs, such as acyclovir (ATC: J05AB01) and ganciclovir (ATC: J05AB06) as well as other nucleoside analogs make use of the substrate specificity of viral thymidine kinase, as opposed to human thymidine kinases. These drugs act as pro-drugs, which in themselves are not toxic, but are converted to toxic drugs by phosphorylation by viral thymidine kinase. Cells infected with the virus therefore produce highly toxic triphosphates that lead to cell death. Human thymidine kinase, in contrast, with its more narrow specificity, is unable to phosphorylate and activate the prodrug. In this way, only cells infected by the virus are susceptible to the drug. Such drugs are effective only against viruses from the herpes group with their specific thymidine kinase. In patients treated with this type of drugs, the development of antiviral drug resistance is frequently observed. Sequencing the thymidine kinase gene in Herpes simplex virus and Varicella zoster virus shows the rapid genetic variability and may facilitate the diagnosis of antiviral drug resistance.

After smallpox was declared eradicated by WHO in December 1979, vaccination programs were terminated. A re-emergence of the disease either by accident or as a result of biological warfare would meet an unprotected population and could result in an epidemic that could be difficult to control. Mass vaccination to combat a smallpox epidemic could be challenging because the only approved smallpox vaccine, Vaccinia Virus, can have severe side effects. Nevertheless, some governments stockpile Smallpox vaccine to insure against the possibility. However, the development of specific and effective antiviral drugs is prioritized. One possible approach would be to use the specificity of the thymidine kinase of poxvirus for the purpose, in a similar way that it is used for drugs against herpesvirus. One difficulty is that the poxvirus thymidine kinase belongs to the same family of thymidine kinases as the human thymidine kinases and thereby is more similar chemically. The structure of poxvirus thymidine kinases has therefore been determined to find potential antiviral drugs. The search has, however, not yet resulted in a usable antiviral drug against poxviruses.

==== As a &quot;suicide gene&quot; in gene therapy ====

The herpesvirus thymidine kinase gene has also been used as a &quot;suicide gene&quot; as a safety system in gene therapy experiments, allowing cells expressing the gene to be killed using ganciclovir. This is desirable in case the recombinant gene causes a mutation leading to uncontrolled cell growth (insertional mutagenesis). The cytotoxic products produced by these modified cells may diffuse to neighboring cells, rendering them similarly susceptible to ganciclovir, a phenomenon known as the &quot;bystander effect.&quot; This approach has been used to treat cancer in animal models, and is advantageous in that the tumor may be killed with as few as 10% of malignant cells expressing the gene. A similar system has been tried using tomato thymidine kinase and AZT. In addition, thymidine kinase gene is used as a suicide gene to tackle dangerous graft-versus-host disease in hematopoietic stem cell transplant therapy named Zalmoxis that was conditionally approved in Europe in 2016

====Tumor marker genes ====

A similar use of the thymidine kinase makes use of the presence in some tumor cells of substances not present in normal cells (tumor markers). Such tumor markers are, for instance, CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) and AFP (alpha fetoprotein). The genes for these tumor markers may be used as promoter genes for thymidine kinase. Thymidine kinase can then be activated in cells expressing the tumor marker but not in normal cells, such that treatment with ganciclovir kills only the tumor cells. Such gene therapy-based approaches are still experimental, however, as problems associated with targeting the gene transfer to the tumor cells have not yet been completely solved.

====Neutron capture therapy for tumors ====

Incorporation of a thymidine analogue with boron has been suggested and tried in animal models for boron neutron capture therapy of brain tumors. A very extensive number of thymidine derivatives containing boron have been described.

====Antiparasitics====

The protozoan parasite &quot;Giardia intestinalis&quot; lacks thymidylate synthase and compensates that by having a high-affinity thymidine kinase in order to efficiently use thymidine that it takes up from the surrounding environment. This makes the parasite sensitive to thymidine analogues such as zidovudine (AZT), which when phosphorylated by the enzyme effectively inhibits parasite proliferation &quot;in vitro&quot; and also looks promising as a antigiardial drug in infected rodents. The short treatment period needed (three days) reduces the risk of side effects as compared to the lengthy treatments when it was commonly used as an anti-HIV drug. 

An alternative approach tested in &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot; (causing malaria) is the introduction of a TK gene in the parasite genome. This makes the parasite sensitive to BrdU treatment and also constitutes a sensitive indicator of replication of the parasite genome.

==Measurement==

===In serum and plasma===

Thymidine kinase levels in serum or plasma have been mostly measured using enzyme activity assays. In commercial assays, this is done by incubation of a serum sample with a substrate analog and measurement of the amount of product formed. Direct determination of the thymidine kinase protein by immunoassay has also been used. The amounts of thymidine kinase found by this method does not correlate well with the enzyme activities. One reason for this is that a large amount of serum TK1 identified by immunoassay is not enzymatically active. This is particularly the case with solid tumors where immunoassays may be more sensitive.

===In tissue===

Thymidine kinase has been determined in tissue samples after extraction of the tissue. No standard method for the extraction or for the assay has been developed and TK determination in extracts from cells and tissues have not been validated in relation to any specific clinical question, see however Romain et al. and Arnér et al. A method has been developed for specific determination of TK2 in cell extracts using the substrate analog 5-Bromovinyl 2&#x27;-deoxyuridine. In the studies referred to below the methods used and the way the results are reported are so different that comparisons between different studies are not possible. The TK1 levels in fetal tissues during development are higher than those of the corresponding tissues later. Certain non-malignant diseases also give rise to dramatic elevation of TK values in cells and tissue: in peripheric lymphocytes during monocytosis and in bone marrow during pernicious anemia. As TK1 is present in cells during cell division, it is reasonable to assume that the TK activity in malignant tissue should be higher than in corresponding normal tissue. This is also confirmed in most studies.

=== Immunohistochemical staining ===

Antibodies against thymidine kinase are available for immunohistochemical detection. Staining for thymidine kinase was found to be a reliable technique for identification of patients with stage 2 breast carcinoma. The highest number of patients identified was obtained by combination of thymidine kinase and Ki-67 staining. The technique has also been validated for lung cancer, for colorectal carcinoma, for lung cancer and for renal cell carcinoma.

=== Fluorescent staining ===

2&#x27;-deoxy-2&#x27;,2&#x27;-difluoro-5-ethynyluridine (dF-EdU) binds to Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase but, because of sterical hindrance, not to human thymidine kinase. This reagent together with a fluorescent azide cause fluorescence of infected cells but not of uninfected cells. Therefore, this substrate analog makes it possible to specifically stain infected cells.

<text>The River Culm flows through the Devon Redlands in Devon, England and is the longest tributary of the River Exe. It rises in the Blackdown Hills at a spring near RAF Culmhead in Somerset, and flows west through Hemyock, then Culmstock (in the Culm Valley) to Uffculme. The river turns south, through Cullompton (and alongside the M5 motorway), skirting the northern boundary of Killerton Park to join the River Exe on the north-western outskirts of Exeter. The name of the river is thought to mean &#x27;knot&#x27; or &#x27;tie&#x27;, in reference to the river&#x27;s twists and loops.

== Course of the river ==
The River Culm begins in a marshy field near Culmhead (picture 1). Four and a half miles from its source the river (OS ST17501455) is 1.5m wide (picture 2). At Gladhayes the river passes under a two-arched bridge (picture 3). About half a mile further the river is joined by the waters of Madford River. From here the river continues to Culmstock, a village straddling both sides of the river where the river is shallower. At Uffculme the river flows in a straight course and flows more slowly. The Spratford Steam, whose waters have flowed in a southerly direction, meets the Culm near Willand, and thereafter the river shares its valley with the present main railway line (former Great Western Railway) from Taunton to Exeter. The M5 motorway runs beside the railway, and all three continue past the market town of Cullompton. The river meanders a lot here and is prone to flooding. Shortly prior to reaching Hele - near Kensham House - the small River Weaver flows into the Culm from the east. It passes under a paper mill at Hele. North of Stoke Canon the river has many meanders. 
Shedding the motorway to the south of Hele, the river and the railway continue together into Exeter, although by then the Culm has joined the River Exe - just below Stoke Canon (picture 4).

== The Culm in literature ==
The novel Perlycross by R.D. Blackmore is based on the Upper Culm Valley. Perlycombe is Hemyock, Perlycross is Culmstock and Perliton is Uffculme.

<text>Zipaquirá () is a municipality and city of Colombia in the department of Cundinamarca. Its neighboring municipalities are Cogua and Nemocón to the north; Tocancipá to the east; Tabio, Cajicá and Sopó to the south; and Subachoque and Pacho to the west. Its seat of municipal government is 49 kilometers from the national capital Bogotá. It is part of the Greater Bogotá Metropolitan Area, and is the capital of the Sabana Centro province. It is also the headquarters of the diocese of the same name and that includes much of the Department of Cundinamarca, extending to the centre of Bogotá, the region of Rionegro, the Ubaté Valley, and the region of Guavio.

The city is primarily known for its Salt Cathedral, an underground church built inside a salt mine in a tunnel made as result of the excavation of the &quot;salinas&quot;. Zipaquirá has an original architecture, and the old city centre is a tourist attraction. Its main square is surrounded by old buildings in the Spanish Colonial style. This small city can be reached by train from Bogotá.

== Etymology ==
In Chibcha, the language of the Muisca, who inhabited the Altiplano Cundiboyacense before the Spanish conquest, the name means &quot;The Land of the &quot;zipa&quot;&quot;. &quot;Zipa&quot; was the ruler of this territory. Another origin is &quot;City of our father&quot;.

== History ==
=== Pre-Spanish colonization ===

In the Abra Valley between Zipaquirá and Tocancipá were found some of the most ancient human remains of South America. The lithic strata reveal animal bones and carbon fragments, analysed with carbon 14 dating to be around 12,500 years old, which makes it the oldest evidence of human settlement on the Altiplano Cundiboyacense.

There are two possible origins of its name. One of them is taken from the indigenous people who inhabited the foot of the Zippa mountain range, &quot;Chicaquicha&quot;, which means &quot;our large wall&quot; or according to other sources, &quot;city of our father&quot;, and until the 19th century the name was written beginning with the letter C. The other possibility refers to the name &quot;zipa&quot;, a title conferred to the governor of the village and to his wife, the latter known by the title of &quot;Quira&quot;, and thus &quot;Zipa-Quirá&quot;. The native people who lived there settled in the upper part of the mine called &quot;Puebla Viejo&quot;, now known as Santiago Pérez, approximately 200 meters above the present site of the city, and where early Spanish descriptions (1537) speak of &quot;seeing a few hundred dwellings with a population of 12,000 people&quot;.

These lands were part of the domain of the &quot;zipa&quot; of Bacatá, the leader of the southern part of the Muisca. This area of the Bogotá plain had at that time a series of small lakes and canyons which made possible the transportation of its inhabitants by canoe, by means of which the inhabitants of Nemocón, Gachancipá, and Tocancipá reached Chicaquicha in order to seek supplies of salt which they traded for pottery and tiles. Salt was also traded with peoples throughout the Andean region of Colombia, including the Panche, and Pantágora in the present department of Tolima, and the Muzo of the present-day department of Boyacá.

=== New Kingdom of Granada ===

On July 18, 1600, Don oidor Luis Henríquez established a settlement on the site with workers and their families, and named it the &quot;Village of Zipaquirá&quot;.

On August 2, 1600, Henríquez contracted Juan de Robles to construct the Church of Zipaquirá, which was later reconstructed by Pedro de Tovar y Buendía, when the parish priest was Fernando de Buenaventura y Castillo.

In 1605 the area was named the &quot;Corregimiento de Zipaquirá&quot; and removed to its original location; this was done due to the limited area available on the originally occupied plain, as well as to the fact that the Spanish forces ordered that no Spanish, negros, mestizos or mulattos were permitted to live in native villages, even if they had purchased land therein.

In 1623, the Spanish official Don Francisco de Sosa named as wards the 321 native inhabitants in the &quot;Old Town&quot;, according to the declaration of Alfredo Tinoco.

On October 5, 1638, Gabriel de Carvajal became the guardian of 771 natives in the region and 125 in Tibitó.

In 1778, by order of the Viceroy Manuel Antonio Flórez, the natives who lived in Zipaquirá were transported to Nemocón in order to prevent constant rebellions of previous owners of the salt deposits.

On August 3, 1779, Zipaquirá saw the creation of the Holy Trinity and San Antonio de Padua parish.

In 1852, Zipaquirá became a province, retaining the status until 1855.

During the Spanish reconquest, on August 3, 1816, the so-called Zipaquirá Martyrs were executed in the city square.

=== Republican era ===
With the Constitution of Cundinamarca of 1815, the city became the capital of the province of the same name. On July 10, 1863, it was designated the capital of the Sovereign State of Cundinamarca, although subsequently it was named Funza by decree of president Morales. Law number 46 of April 29, 1905, created the Department of Quesada, the capital of which was Zipaquirá, which remained so until 1910.

== Geography and description ==

Zipaquirá is located north of Bogotá, linked by road and by train. The most famous of its salt mines has been exploited since pre-Columbian times by the Muisca, in which is located the famous Salt Cathedral. González Forero Square is the center of the city, surrounded by buildings that have conserved their colonial style and are considered to be national monuments. The square contains a cathedral constructed between 1760 and 1870, with its stone façade, as well as the city hall and the &quot;Salinas&quot; administration building, with their green republican-style roofs.

The city has undergone recent changes, having transformed streets in the center to pedestrian walkways, limiting vehicle traffic in the area in an attempt at preservation and conservation, and lending a more cordial aspect for tourists. As part of this strategy, the city has also carried out a project of restructuring the Sabana Station (railroad), and, next to it, the construction of Parque La Esperanza.

Currently, the Bogotá - Chía - Cajicá - Zipaquirá highway is completed, making possible more rapid and safer access to the city, since the Cajicá - Zipaquirá segment was one of the most accident-prone roads in the country.

Zipaquirá offers the visitor typical restaurants, colonial houses that are almost 300 years old, tourist agencies, recreation centers such as Panaca Sabana, museums, crafts, and an interesting retail infrastructure.

Agriculture is also important in the municipality, especially dairy and potato farming. Industry in the region is closely associated with the production, processing, and refining of salt. The estimated population is 130,000 inhabitants (called &quot;Zipaquireños&quot;).

The streets, the park, the houses, and the square commemorate the era of the colony. As well as the communal movement and the indigenous struggles that gave way to a new chapter in the history of the country. Today through tourist guides and locals the indigenous origins of the municipality, which in the indigenous language is called Chicaquicha, is visited by a large number of tourists from around the world.

Among the most famous events of the area are the majestic Holy Week processions, organized for the last 54 years by the Nazarene of Zipaquirá Congregation, with processions throughout the week with beautiful Spanish religious relics that attract both local residents and visitors. Tourists actively participate during Good Friday when the procession of the Path of the Cross journeys up to the Plazoleta del Minero to the entrance of the Salt Cathedral.

<doc id="1308353" wikidata="Q7337395" url="?curid=1308353" title="River Erewash">
<text>The River Erewash is a river in England, a tributary of the River Trent that flows roughly southwards through Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire, forming the boundary between the two counties for much of its length. It rises near Kirkby-in-Ashfield, and passes close to Pinxton, Ironville, Langley Mill, Eastwood, Ilkeston, Trowell, Stapleford, Sandiacre, Toton and Long Eaton to reach the River Trent near Beeston.

It shares its valley with a railway line from Kirkby-in-Ashfield to Pye Bridge Junction, and the Erewash Valley line below the junction. The Pinxton Branch of the Cromford Canal runs parallel to the upper reaches, and below Ironville the main line of the abandoned Cromford Canal enters the valley. At Langley Mill, both the Erewash Canal and the abandoned Nottingham Canal fit into the valley, with the Nottingham Canal turning to the east at Trowell, and the Erewash Canal continuing through Long Eaton when the river turns to the east to reach its mouth.

The river passes through three nature reserves, at Erewash Meadows and Aldercar Flash to the north of Langley Mill, and the Attenborough Nature Reserve on the banks of the River Trent. They are managed by the Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust and the Derbyshire Wildlife Trust. Historically, the river has supplied power to several water mills, none of which remain standing, apart from some of Stapleford Mill, which forms part of a social club established in 1922. The river is mentioned several times in the works of the writer D. H. Lawrence.

== Etymology ==
The approximate meaning of the name is not in doubt, but there is room for debate about the precise derivation and its connotations. Brewer gives the commonly accepted explanation that it comes from the Old English words (&quot;wandering&quot;) and (&quot;wet meadow&quot;). This is accepted by Kenneth Cameron, a leading placename expert and Derbyshire specialist, who interprets the name as &quot;wandering, marshy river&quot;. Gelling, who specialises in seeking precise topographical equivalents for toponymic elements, confirms that signifies a marshy meadow but gives only southern examples. She conjectures that there is an element, &quot;wæsse&quot;, perhaps Old English, that signifies very specifically &quot;land by a meandering river which floods and drains quickly&quot;, and her examples are primarily Midland and northern. This seems to fit the Erewash perfectly. A good example of the meandering character of the river will be seen around Gallows Inn Playing Fields, Ilkeston, where rapid flooding and draining occur frequently. As it meanders through Toton and Long Eaton the river splits into two sections; the main course veers to the east and the relief channel flows over a low weir in a straight southerly direction. When there has been prolonged rainfall, the two waters are prone to bursting their banks and meet over the football pitches and the cricket pitch.

== Course ==
The Erewash rises on the south side of Kirkby-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, close to a disused railway embankment to the south of Kirkby-in-Ashfield railway station. It flows to the south-west, and is joined by another stream which rises in Portland Park and flows to the north-west, passsing under the railway line for Kirkby-in-Ashfield to Pye Bridge junction, where it joins the Erewash Valley line. It is culverted beneath another disused embankment, and turns westwards to the north of Kirkby Woodhouse. To the south of Bentinck Town it is crossed by the B6018 Park Lane, and is culverted under the M1 motorway. It is joined by Maghole Brook, which is also culverted under the motorway, a little further to the north. Pinxton in Derbyshire is to the north and Selston in Nottinghamshire is to the south. The county boundary follows the course of the river from the M1 crossing to its mouth. After the motorway, it is crossed by a railway bridge. It passes the basin at the end of the abandoned Pinxton Branch of the Cromford Canal, which shares the valley as the river turns to the south. At Pye Bridge the Erewash Valley line crosses over the river, after which it too shares the valley. The railway bridge is followed by the B600 Alfreton Road bridge. As it approaches Ironville, it is crossed by two railway embankments, now part of the heritage Midland Railway – Butterley, and continues to the east of the disused Cromford Canal to reach Erewash Meadows Nature Reserve.

Erewash Meadows is a large area of floodplain grassland and wetland. It is jointly owned by Derbyshire Wildlife Trust and Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust, and includes of the Cromford Canal which is in water to the north of the ponds which form the central section of the reserve, known as Brinsley Meadows. The river provides habitat for fish and invertebrates, as well as a significant number of water voles. During the spring and summer months, the ponds and the watered section of the canal are populated by grass snakes, amphibians and dragonflies. Butterflies thrive on the wild flowers which inhabit the grasslands, and during the spring, the reserve is a haven for lapwings, beeding snipe, reed buntings and sedge warblers. Wading birds, wildfowl and hen harriers can be seen during the autumn months, and some of the wildfowl stay for the winter, including widgeon and teal. The site covers around . To the south is Aldercar Flash nature reserve, of newly created ponds and reed beds, which house populations of little ringed plover, snipe, shelduck, reed warbler and water voles.
After the reserves, the river is crossed by the A610 road to pass between Langley Mill to the west and Eastwood to the east. It is joined by Nether Green Brook, which flows westwards to reach the Erewash&#x27;s left bank. It is crossed by the A608 road to the east of Langley Mill railway station, loops around the site of the Heanor Milnhay sewage treatment works at Langley Mill, and is joined by Bailey Brook on its right bank. Severn Trent submitted a planning application in 2022 to abandon the treatment works and replace it with a pumping station and pipeline to allow the effluent to be treated elsewhere. To the south-west of Eastwood the river is crossed by a Grade II listed aqueduct, built in 1779 by the engineer John Varley to carry the Erewash Canal over the river. It is constructed of sandstone, and has three segmental arches. Gill Brook joins the river on its left bank, and it is crossed by the Grade II* listed Bennerley Viaduct. It was built in the late 19th century, and is one of only two wrought iron viaducts that survive in England. It was completed in 1887, and continued in use until 1968. It is long and carried the line around above the river. It probably survived because of the difficulty of cutting up wrought iron at the time it was abandoned, and was extensively restored in 2022.

The river is crossed by a railway line to the north of Ilkeston railway station, by the A6096 road which runs westwards into Ilkeston, and then by the railway line again. There is a short section where the river has been straightened to accommodate the railway, before it crosses the river twice more, with the A609 road crossing between the two railway bridges. On the northern edge of Stapleford the M1 motorway crosses, and the river passes between Sandiacre to the west and Stapleford to the east. Three more bridges follow, carring the railway, the B5010 road, and the A52 Brian Clough Way. The river threads between the Erewash Canal and Toton Sidings, and is crossed by the railway for the final time to the north east of Long Eaton. It turns to the east to flow along the southern edge of Toton, and the main channel is supplemented by a relief channel to the south. Both are crossed by the A6005 road bridge, before they join again and enter Attenborough Nature Reserve to the south of Beeston, from where the Erewash flows into the River Trent.

Attenborough Nature Reserve was first created in 1966, on land where Cemex were extracting gravel, and the Attenborough Nature Centre was opened by David Attenborough in 2005. The site is noted for kingfishers, bitterns and otters. Gravel extraction ceased in 2019, and Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust bought the site in December 2020. Cemex had carried out extensive repairs to works bridge, which provides access to the eastern section of the site prior to the sale, but the bridge was deemed to be unsafe and beyond economic repair in 2023, with a replacement estimated to cost $0.5 million. 
The river gives its name to the Erewash Valley, which has a rich industrial history, and the local government district and borough of Erewash, which was named after the river when the former borough of Ilkeston and urban district of Long Eaton were united with some of the surrounding rural areas in 1974.

==History==
The river has been used as a source of water power in the past. Furthest upstream was Kirkby Mill or Fryers Mill, located on Mill Lane between Kirkby in Ashfield and Kirkby Woodhouse. The first known mill had a waterwheel that was in diameter. In the mid-18th century it was owned by the Fryer family, and subsequently by the Robinsons. The building was demolished in 1857 and a new mill constructed, with a wheel that was in diameter and carried the date 1860. Its water supply dropped by a half in 1890, when the London and North Eastern Railway built a tunnel under the Shoulder of Mutton Hill. The mill was sold to William Alfred Curtis in 1932, but only lasted for two more years, as subsidence from the nearby Bentinck Colliery resulted in the land surface dropping by , and the mill became unworkable. It was demolished in 1934, although the mill pond still exists.

To the south of Langton Hall Farm stood an iron furnace. It was built in 1671 by Humphrey Jennens, and used charcoal from Kirkby Wood to heat the ore. Jennens sold 2,034 tons of unrefined cast iron in 1693. The furnace was mentioned in various leases from the 18th century, and was taken over by the Spencer Partnership. After a period of inactivity between 1750 and 1765, it was in use again, but finally closed in 1788. Traces of a mill leat and dam can still be found at the site.

Langley Mills had a mill at the time of the Domesday Book in 1086. More recently, there was a mill accessed from Cromford Road. It was owned by Smith&#x27;s from the mid 1800s, and produced flour. The mill complex was demolished in 2014. Maps show that there were sluices and leats at the site, which was immediately below the confluence of the Nether Green Brook and the Erewash. A mill at Ironville was mentioned in the Nottingham Borough records for 16 June 1348, but no subsequent records are known. 

Newmanleys Mill was located to the south-west of Eastwood. Some land was sold to the Day family in 1612, and the original mill is thought to have been built soon afterwards. John Day&#x27;s mill is shown on a document from 1814, when it had three pairs of stones for grinding corn, an overshot waterwheel and a drying kiln. The Bentley family took over its operation around 1860, and at some point the waterwheel was replaced by an undershot wheel, which was in turn replaced by a turbine in 1892, and subsequently by a paraffin engine and then an oil engine. The mill was demolished in 1933. A new steel framed mill was built on the same site, and milling continued until 1968, with power obtained from both water and electricity. 

Rather less is known about the mill at Trowell, Broxtowe. There was a mill there in the eighth year of Henry VI, around 1430, and another mention of it in 1568. It was shown on maps dating from 1774, 1836 and 1900.

The origins of Stapleford mill are unknown, but when it was sold in 1881, it had three pairs of stones and a dresser. It was converted to a steam-powered mill in 1888. After the first world war, workers used to have drinks with the manager at the mill after work finished on Fridays. The manager died in 1922, and his will left the building to his staff to be run as a social club. It opened as a club on 23 September 1922, initially for working men, but restrictions on membership have since been removed.

Water quality in the Erewash is affected by the discharge of treated and untreated effluent from sewage works. Heanor Milnhay works at Langley Mill discharged directly into the Erewash, while Newthorpe works, to the south of Eastwood, discharged into Gilt Brook, a tributary of the Erewash. Severn Trent Water carried out a major upgrade of the Newthorpe works between 2022 and 2024, and decommissioned the Milnhay works, replacing it with a pumping station to pump untreated effluent to Newthorpe once work there was completed. The work cost around £35.8 million, and was designed to improve the quality of discharges into the river system to meet the requirements of the Water Framework Directive. The treatment process included a new Enhanced Bio-Phosphorus Removal plant, which uses polyphosphate-accumulating organisms rather than chemicals to remove phosphates from the effluent, enabling phosphate levels to meet new requirements for phosphates introduced in December 2024.

 of new dual rising main was constructed between the two works. The route for the pipeline crossed land affected by legacy coal mining, and special permission had to be obtained to lay the pipes through such a high-risk area. At Newthorpe, a new inlet works was constructed to process the flow from Milnhay. The secondary and tertiary treatment sections of the plant were decommissioned, replaced by new treatment structures capable of processing twice the volume of effluent. This included anaerobic and anoxic tanks, a four-lane activated sludge plant, three final settlement tanks which are in diameter, and the largest mixed media filtration system installed in the UK. This was all built on a field next to the existing works, and the outlet from the works was re-routed directly into the Erewash.

At Milnhay, only the storm tanks were retained, although their capacity was increased from 2 megalitres to 7 Ml, by reusing the existing primary settlement tanks and building a new blind tank. The rest of the works were decommissioned, replaced by a pumping station to pump the incoming effluent to Newthorpe. The project was recognised at the 2024 Ground Engineering Awards as the best ‘UK Project with a Geotechnical Value of £500k-£1M’.

== Literary associations ==
For such a small river the Erewash has a high literary profile, due almost entirely to the writer D. H. Lawrence, who mentions it several times and centres a number of works in the Erewash valley. A reference at the beginning of &quot;The Rainbow&quot; is perhaps the most telling from the geographical point of view:
==Water quality==
The Environment Agency assesses the water quality within the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail.

The water quality of the River Erewash system was as follows in 2019/2022.

Reasons for the water quality being less than good include discharge from sewage treatment works and runoff from agricultural land. The closure of Langley Mill sewage treatment works has removed the discharge of treated effluent into the river. Like most rivers in the UK, the chemical status changed from good to fail in 2019, due to the presence of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS) and mercury compounds, none of which had previously been included in the assessment.

<doc id="1308360" wikidata="Q2511208" url="?curid=1308360" title="Vasugupta">
<text>Vasugupta ( – 850 CE) was the author of the &quot;Shiva Sutras&quot;, an important text of the Advaita tradition of Kashmir Shaivism, also called &quot;Trika&quot; (sometimes called &quot;Trika Yoga&quot;).

==Biography==
Little is known about Vasugupta&#x27;s life, other than he lived in Kashmir and in the first half of the 9th century. He probably was born in late 8th century to a Kashmiri Hindu family. This dating is based on mentions of his work in other Indian texts, and the biography of his students particularly Kallata and Somananda, both of whom are dated to have actively composed philosophical texts sometime between 825 and 900 CE. He probably was a contemporary and aware of the ideas of Advaita Vedanta, and of Buddhist scholars of the 8th and 9th century.

The author is believed in Shaiva tradition to have amassed knowledge and recognition through direct realization. He was a native of Kashmir and a Shaiva. It is unclear how and what inspired him to write the Shiva Sutras, and early texts mention no legends. Later tradition and hagiographic texts present inconsistent stories. One states that Vasugupta found the sutras inscribed on a rock called &quot;Sankaropala&quot;. Another states that Shiva appeared in his dream and recited it to him, who then wrote it down. There are additional stories, but the texts of the immediate students of Vasugupta mention none of these legends except the one where Vasugupta discovers the Sutras in his dream.

Vasugupta also wrote the &quot;Spanda Karikas&quot; as a commentary on the Shiva Sutras. He paved the way for later scholars for a cultural and religious renaissance in Kashmir which continued for centuries till the advent of Islam. His principal disciple, Bhatta Kallata spread the Shiva Sutras, and wrote &quot;Spanda-karika&quot; in the 2nd half of the 9th century.

==Philosophy and Kashmir Shaivism==
Vasugupta is regarded by some as the founder of the system of Hindu philosophy known as Advaita Shaivism of Kashmir, or Trika.

Vasugupta&#x27;s Shiva Sutra is an important Yoga text, foundational to the Trika system of Kashmir Shaivism. The text discusses the nature and cause of bondage, and how one liberates from this bondage. The text has been extensively commented upon by Indian authors, and some manuscripts have been translated into English, such as by Mark Dyczkowski and by Jaideva Singh.

<doc id="1308376" wikidata="Q7250229" url="?curid=1308376" title="Property and Environment Research Center">
<text>The Property and Environment Research Center (PERC), previously known as the Political Economy Research Center, is a free-market environmentalist think tank based in Bozeman, Montana, United States. Established in 1980, PERC is dedicated to original research on market approaches to resolving environmental problems.

==History==
PERC began as an intellectual collaboration between economists John Baden and Richard L. Stroup. PERC started with a simple question: &quot;If markets can produce bread and cars, why can&#x27;t they produce environmental quality?&quot;

In 1978, the two men established the Center for Political Economy and Natural Resources at Montana State University with the help of Terry L. Anderson, P.J. Hill and Ronald Johnson. Later, they founded PERC as a free-standing research institution with the goal of showing that economic freedom can improve environmental quality.

While PERC later adopted the term &quot;free market environmentalism,&quot; the original concept was called the New Resource Economics, which was discussed in an article by Terry Anderson in the &quot;American Journal of Agricultural Economics&quot;. As Anderson indicated in his article in the AJAE, the New Resource Economics combined neoclassical economics, property rights, public choice, and Austrian economics.

Notable former board members, fellows and alumni include Tim Sheehy, Henry N. Butler, Jonathan H. Adler, Gary Libecap, Bart Wilson, Jane S. Shaw, Bruce Yandle.

==Outreach==
PERC engages in research and advocacy related to free-market environmentalism and is active on issues including endangered species, water, pollution, and public lands. PERC says that government policy is the root cause of much environmental degradation. &quot;The Dust Bowl Reconsidered&quot;, for instance, blames the federal Homestead Act for accelerating erosion problems by limiting claims of newly settled land to 160-320 acre (0.65 to 1.3 km2) parcels. According to this article, fragmented land ownership reduced the incentives for implementing erosion countermeasures and made it difficult for farmers to negotiate contracts for voluntary soil conservation.

PERC seeks to influence public policy by publishing guides for Congressional staff and organizing weeklong seminars for undergraduates. The organization&#x27;s monthly publication, PERC Reports, regularly features articles questioning assumptions that form the basis of U.S. federal environmental law.

<doc id="1308384" wikidata="Q7250851" url="?curid=1308384" title="Prospector (train)">
<text>The Prospector was a passenger train operated by the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western railroad between Denver, Colorado and Salt Lake City, Utah. There were two incarnations of the train: a streamlined, diesel multiple unit train that operated briefly in 1941 and 1942; and a locomotive-hauled train of conventional passenger equipment that operated from 1945 until 1967.

==1941–1942 &quot;Prospector&quot;==
The train was inaugurated November 17, 1941. The original equipment was a pair of Budd Company-built diesel multiple units numbered M-1 and M-2.

For the inaugural trip in 1941, the railroad made stainless steel pass holders that were intended to be distributed to passengers. The holder was engraved with a line drawing of the train on the outside. On the inside were two cards: one with an embossed picture of a prospector and mule in gold, the other with a message reading:

The holders were not distributed as intended to passengers.

The trainsets had significant reliability problems exacerbated by difficult terrain and the train was discontinued July 5, 1942. The trainsets were returned to Budd and ultimately scrapped.

==The Postwar &quot;Prospector&quot;==

Anticipating increases in overnight Denver-Salt Lake City rail passenger traffic after the end of World War II, the Rio Grande restored the &quot;Prospector&quot; on October 1, 1945, using conventional heavyweight equipment. The railroad also began planning the acquisition of new lightweight equipment for the train. In 1949 it purchased three dome-observation cars built by Budd, and in 1950 it took delivery of 25 Pullman-Standard cars — equipment that had been ordered by the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway, but never used by that railroad. The Pullman-Standard cars began service on the &quot;Prospector&quot; in late 1950, whereas the Budd dome cars generally served on the &quot;Royal Gorge&quot; (see below) and therefore only appeared on the &quot;Prospector&quot; west of Grand Junction, Colorado.

In response to a coal miners&#x27; strike, in 1950 the Rio Grande began combining the &quot;Prospector&quot; and the railroad&#x27;s &quot;Royal Gorge&quot; train west of Grand Junction. This combined operation continued until 1964 when &quot;Royal Gorge&quot; service was cut back to Salida, Colorado. Between 1950 and 1953 the train&#x27;s western terminus was extended from Salt Lake City to Ogden.

Between 1964 and 1967 the railroad occasionally attached flatcars carrying highway vans —piggyback cars — to the rear of the &quot;Prospector&quot;, a relatively rare combination of passenger and freight service in the same train.

The &quot;Prospector&quot; made its final runs on May 28, 1967.

<doc id="1308385" wikidata="Q335276" url="?curid=1308385" title="Lalitaditya Muktapida">
<text>Lalitaditya alias Muktapida (IAST: Lalitāditya Muktāpīḍa; r. c. 724 CE–760 CE) was a Karkota monarch of the Kashmir region in the Indian subcontinent. The 12th-century Kashmiri chronicler Kalhana characterizes Lalitaditya as a &quot;world conqueror&quot;, crediting him with miraculous powers and extensive conquests across India and Central Asia. While Kalhana&#x27;s account is not supported by contemporary records and largely rejected as exaggerations, he is accepted as the most powerful king of his dynasty. The chronicles of the neighbouring Tang dynasty present him as a vassal-ally, and his involvement in the Tang campaigns may have contributed to his reputation as a great conqueror in Kashmir.

Lalitaditya commissioned a number of shrines in Kashmir, including the now-ruined Martand Sun Temple. He also established several towns, including a new capital at Parihasapura.

== Background ==

The main source of information about Lalitaditya is &quot;Rajatarangini&quot;, a chronicle of the rulers of Kashmir, by the 12th-century Kashmiri writer Kalhana. Lalitaditya also finds a brief mention in the New Book of Tang (&quot;Xin Tang shu&quot;), a record of the Tang dynasty of China. This text mentions him as &quot;Mu-to-pi&quot; or &quot;Muduobi&quot; (a variation of Muktapida). The 11th-century Persian chronicler Al-Biruni mentions a Kashmiri king called Muttai, who was most probably Lalitaditya (&quot;Muttai&quot; being derived from the Apabhramsha form of &quot;Muktapida&quot;).

The &quot;Rajatarangini&quot; names Lalitaditya as the youngest son of the Karkota king Durlabhaka (alias Pratapaditya) and queen Narendraprabha. His mother Narendraprabha was previously married to a foreign merchant settled in Kashmir. He had two elder brothers named Chandrapida (alias Vajraditya) and Tarapida (alias Udayaditya), who preceded him as the rulers of Kashmir.

Kalhana states that Lalitaditya&#x27;s reign lasted for 36 years, 7 months and 11 days. He suggests that Lalitaditya ruled during 724-761 CE. However, this is not correct, as Lalitaditya&#x27;s predecessor is known to have sent an embassy to the Tang capital Chang&#x27;an in 720 CE. This predecessor, mentioned as &quot;Tianmu&quot; in the Tang records, was probably Tarapida, although some scholars have identified him as Chandrapida. Modern historians date Lalitaditya&#x27;s reign to c. 724/5 - c. 760 CE.

Lalitaditya claimed to be a descendant of the mythical Nāga king Karkotaka.

== Military career ==

=== Kalhana&#x27;s account ===

Kalhana describes Lalitaditya as a universal monarch, who spent most of his life in military expeditions. He gives the following account of Lalitaditya&#x27;s career:

====Conquest of Kannauj====
Lalitaditya invaded the Antarvedi country, whose capital was located at Gadhipura (Kanyakubja). The defending king Yashovarman submitted to him after a long war and offered a peace treaty. Yashovarman drew up a document outlining the terms of this treaty, titled &quot;The treaty of Yashovarman and Lalitaditya&quot;. Lalitaditya&#x27;s minister Mitrasharman objected to this title, and insisted that Lalitaditya&#x27;s name appear before Yashovarman&#x27;s name in the title. Lalitaditya&#x27;s generals, who were uneasy about the long duration of the war, blamed Mitrasharman for delaying the treaty. But Lalitaditya himself was pleased with Mitrasharman: he broke off the peace negotiations, and &quot;uprooted&quot; Yashovarman. As a result of this defeat, Yashovarman, who had been served by the court poets such as Vakpati and Bhavabhuti, himself became a panegyrist of Lalitaditya. The land of Kanyakubja, located between the Yamuna river and the Kalika river (possibly modern Kali Nadi), came under Lalitaditya&#x27;s control.

Lalitaditya instituted five new offices, which were occupied by Shahi and other princes. After consolidating power in Kanyakubja, Lalitaditya proceeded to the eastern ocean, just like the Ganges river flows from the Himalayas to the eastern ocean. During this expedition, the elephants in this army saw the land of their birth. Lalitaditya reached Kalinga and Gauda, and a number of elephants joined his army from Gauda.

====March to the Southern India====
From the eastern sea-shore, Lalitaditya proceeded to the southern region, where the Karnatas bowed down before him. The sovereign of Dakshinapatha at this time was a Karnata queen named Ratta. She had constructed obstacle-free roads over the Vindhya mountains, and was as powerful as the goddess Vindhyavasini (Durga). Even a powerful figure like her bowed down to Lalitaditya. In the south, Lalitaditya&#x27;s soldiers forgot their fatigue, as they sipped wine of the coconut trees and enjoyed the breeze on the banks of the Kaveri river. The snakes dropping from the sandalwood trees on Chandanadri (the Malaya Mountains) appeared like curved swords falling from the arms because of the fear of an attack by Lalitaditya. The Kashmiri king crossed the oceans via the islands, as one crosses a rivulet by stepping over stones.

====Konkan campaign====
After crossing the ocean, Lalitaditya reached the seven Konkanas. Dvaraka, located on the western sea shore, inspired Lalitaditya&#x27;s soldiers with desire [to enter that city]. Lalitaditya&#x27;s elephant army then marched into Avanti. The dust raised by his army&#x27;s crossing of Vindhya mountain made the Vindhya appear red with anger. In Avanti, the tusks of his elephants were split only by the moonlight falling on the diadem of Mahakala. (This is a reference to the traditional myth that the moonlight can split the elephant tusks).

====Northern campaign====
Having defeated most of the other kings, Lalitaditya proceeded from Avanti to Uttarapatha (the northern region), where he fought with several mighty kings. His army emptied the Kamboja stables of horses (a reference to the Kamboja country&#x27;s reputation for good-quality horses). The resulting darkness made them appear as if they were filled with black buffaloes instead. The Tuhkharas fled to mountain ranges on Lalitaditya&#x27;s approach, leaving behind their horses. He also defeated Mummuni three times in a battle, and made the Bhauttas very anxious. Lalitaditya was too dignified to tolerate the wine-drinking Daradas.

====Invasion of Pragjyotisha====
When Lalitaditya approached the deserted town of Pragjyotisha, he saw the smoke arising from the black aloes burning in the forests. In &quot;Valukambudhi&quot; (&quot;sea of sand&quot;), where the mirage resulted in an illusion of water, Lalitaditya&#x27;s elephants appeared like large crocodiles. The women of &quot;Stri-rajya&quot; (literally &quot;women&#x27;s kingdom&quot;) melted the hearts of Lalitaditya&#x27;s warriors by showing their &quot;high breasts&quot;. When the trembling queen of Strirajya met Lalitaditya, no one could determine whether the emotion displayed by her was the terror or the desire of love. On Lalitaditya&#x27;s approach, the Uttarakurus took shelter in the trees just like snakes hide in holes on seeing a Garuda.

====Return to Kashmir====

Lalitaditya returned to Kashmir with the immense wealth obtained from his conquests. He appointed his attendants as the kings of Jalaṃdhara, Lohara and other countries. By Lalitaditya&#x27;s order, the Turushkas and Dakshinatyas in his kingdom had to display a badge of shame. The Turushkas had to carry their arms at their backs and shave half of their heads, to mark their bondage. The Dakshinatyas had to wear a tail that swept the ground, to signify their similarity to beasts.

Lalitaditya established several cities and shrines during his stay in Kashmir. Once, he invaded and conquered the kingdom of Sikata-sindhu (&quot;Ocean of the Sand&quot;), after crossing a massive wasteland (see miraculous powers section below). After some time, he marched towards the &quot;boundless regions of the north&quot;, because he was curious to visit the lands where no one had reached before. During this campaign, he had several adventures with demons sent by the deity Kubera to test his power.

When Lalitaditya&#x27;s ministers did not receive any news about him for several days, they sent a messenger to find him. The messenger came back with the news that the king did not wish to return, having decided to remain engaged in military conquests until his death. In his message, Lalitaditya provided political wisdom on how to govern the kingdom, and asked for his elder son Kuvalayapida to be appointed as his successor.

Later, some people reported that Lalitaditya died in the Aryanaka country, as a result of excessive out-of-season snowfall. Others reported he immolated himself in a dire situation, because he wanted to die while he remained a great king.

=== General historicity of Kalhana&#x27;s account ===

M. A. Stein (1900), who first translated &quot;Rajatarangini&quot; into English, accepted Lalitaditya&#x27;s subjugation of Yashovarman as a historical fact. However, he rejected the subsequent victories described by Kalhana as &quot;manifestly legendary&quot;, given the absence of historical details. According to him, the kingdom of Kashmir did not have manpower or resources to carry out such extensive campaigns.

According to historian C. V. Vaidya (1861–1938), Kalhana&#x27;s account is corroborated by the 13th century text &quot;Chach Nama&quot;. A letter in this text, addressed by Raja Dahir to Muhammad bin Qasim, mentions &quot;the King of Kashmir on whose royal threshold the other rulers of Hind had placed their heads, who sways the whole of Hind, even the countries of Makran and Turan, whose chains a great many noblemen and grandees have willingly placed on their knees and against whom no human being can stand.&quot; This letter is stated to have been written in 712 CE, so Vaidya theorizes that Lalitaditya&#x27;s conquests must have occurred during 700-712 CE.

Later, art historian Hermann Goetz (1969) devised a historical reconstruction supporting Kalhana&#x27;s account, although he admitted that &quot;this reconstruction cannot claim to be more than a working theory trying plausibly to interconnect the sparse and uncertain data&quot;. Goetz argued that Kalhana&#x27;s account of Lalitaditya&#x27;s military exploits is not only probable, but also supported by other evidence. According to Goetz, Lalitaditya&#x27;s extensive conquests were possible because the other contemporary kingdoms in the region had been weakened by foreign invasions and wars. In addition, Goetz speculated that Lalitaditya managed to create a powerful army as a result of superior China-influenced military organization, administrative set-up and weaponry. Goetz identified several persons mentioned in Kalhana&#x27;s account as historical figures, and argued that a distant writer like Kalhana could not have invented such historical persons.

André Wink (2002) described Goetz&#x27; theory as convincing, but Ronald M. Davidson (2012) dismisses Wink&#x27;s affirmation of Goetz&#x27;s analysis as uncritical. Davidson rejects the argument that the conquests described by Kalhana must have been real, because Kalhana could not have invented historical persons. In his support, Davidson presents the example of the &quot;Nilamata Purana&quot;, which is one of Kalhana&#x27;s sources for &quot;Rajatarangini&quot;, and which ascribes fictional events to historical persons. He argues that Kalhana&#x27;s dubious sources could have fabricated a conquest of known parties. Davidson points out that Yashovarman&#x27;s court poet Vakpati credits him with similar conquests in &quot;Gaudavaho&quot;, according to which Yashovarman conquered not only eastern and southern India, but also defeated the king of Persia. Davidson dismisses both &quot;Gaudavaho&quot; and &quot;Rajatarangini&quot; as poetic boast, describing Kalhana&#x27;s account as &quot;Kashmiri boosterism&quot;. He, however, believes that Kalhana&#x27;s claims might be closer to the truth than Vakpati&#x27;s claims. According to Davidson, Lalitaditya launched his attack in 733 CE, advanced up to Magadha in the east, and then returned to Kashmir in 747 CE.

Tansen Sen (2004) similarly rejects the claims about Lalitaditya&#x27;s conquest of Hindu Kush-Pamir region, based on numismatic evidence and contemporary records other than &quot;Rajatarangini&quot;. According to him, Lalitaditya provided military and logistical support to the Tang campaigns against Tibetans, and the success of these campaigns later led to Kashmiri legends describing him as a great conqueror.

Shyam Manohar Mishra (1977) points out that Lalitaditya&#x27;s achievements &quot;must have been coloured and exaggerated by the popular imagination&quot; by the time of Kalhana, who lived four centuries after Lalitaditya. This is evident from the fact that Kalhana ascribes miraculous powers to Lalitaditya. According to Susan L. Huntington (1997), Lalitaditya&#x27;s campaigns were probably &quot;massive raiding and looting expeditions rather than true conquests&quot;.

=== Detailed analysis of Kalhana&#x27;s account ===

==== Afghanistan and Punjab ====

Goetz theorizes that Lalitaditya had captured Punjab, Afghanistan, and western part of the Central Asian highlands before embarking upon his campaign in central India. He dates Lalitaditya&#x27;s conquest of Afghanistan before 730 CE, and presents the following arguments in his support:

* There is a gigantic gilt copper Buddha statue beside Lalitaditya&#x27;s chaitya at Parihasapura. It appears to be inspired by the Bamiyan Buddha statue. At the same time, there is no influence from the Gupta art, which was popular in Yashovarman&#x27;s territory.
* Before Lalitaditya, Afghanistan was controlled by Turkic Shahi &quot;princelings&quot;, who were under nominal Chinese control after the fall of the Sasanian Empire. After Lalitaditya, Afghanistan came under the control of the Hindu Shahi dynasty of Lalliya.
* The Muslims from the west could not advance beyond Multan in Punjab during this period. While the fall of the Umayyad Caliphate was a factor in this, it also appears that there was an Indian empire powerful enough to offer resistance to the Caliphite armies.

Tansen Sen (2004) criticizes Goetz&#x27; theory, based on numismatic evidence and other contemporary records. These sources suggest that Kapisa and Zabulistan regions in present-day Afghanistan were under control of the independent Turkic Shahi rulers. The records of the Tang dynasty, whose rulers received regular embassies from the Turkic Shahis, testify to their independent status. According to Sen, the Karkota kingdom had peaceful relations with these Turkic neighbours: this very fact may have enabled Lalitaditya to leave Kashmir and lead troops to central and eastern India.

==== Yashovarman ====

Lalitaditya&#x27;s victory over Yashovarman appears to be historically true. Historical evidence suggests that the two kings were immediate neighbours before their conflict: Lalitaditya&#x27;s empire extended up to present-day Punjab in the south-east, while Yashovarman&#x27;s north-eastern frontier included parts of present-day Haryana. The discovery of some coins bearing the legend &quot;Shri-Pratapa&quot; in present-day Uttar Pradesh is also considered as an evidence of Lalitaditya&#x27;s success in this region (as Pratapaditya was the name of Lalitaditya&#x27;s father). Abhinavagupta&#x27;s ancestor Atrigupta, a scholar who originally lived in Yashovarman&#x27;s territory, was brought to Kashmir by Lalitaditya. This may have happened during Lalitaditya&#x27;s invasion.

However, Kalhana&#x27;s account of this victory over Yashovarman cannot be taken at the face value. According to historian Shyam Manohar Mishra (1977), the earlier historians have overrated Lalitaditya&#x27;s success against Yashovarman: the defeated king acknowledged Lalitaditya&#x27;s suzerainty for a short period, but became practically independent when Lalitaditya became engaged in other conflicts.

The date of the conflict between the two kings is not certain. The Annals of the Tang dynasty suggest that Lalitaditya and a Central Indian king had fought against Tibet as allies. Assuming that this central Indian king was Yashovarman (after his subjugation by Lalitaditya), M. A. Stein dated Lalitaditya&#x27;s conquest to sometime before 736 CE. However, Mishra interprets the Tang records differently to theorize that Lalitaditya and Yashovarman were allies at least until 736 CE. According to Mishra, the conflict between Lalitaditya and Yashovarman took place after 736 CE, and before Yashovarman&#x27;s death in 749-753 CE.

German Indologist Hermann Jacobi dated Lalitaditya&#x27;s invasion of Kannauj to 14 August 733 CE, a date that was accepted by several later historians. This theory is based on the &quot;Gaudavaho&quot;, a text composed by Yashovarman&#x27;s court poet Vakpati. This text describes a solar eclipse (an inauspicious omen), which Jacobi considers to be an allusion to Yashovarman&#x27;s defeat. Jacobi also bases his conclusion on a subsequent verse, which he translates as &quot;The corner of his [Yashovarman&#x27;s] eye-brow became twisted on account of the shaking of his [kingly] position.&quot; Assuming 733 CE as the date of Lalitaditya&#x27;s victory, Goetz dated the beginning of the conflict to 730 CE or earlier.

Shyam Manohar Mishra rejects Jacobi&#x27;s conclusion, pointing out that the 733 CE solar eclipse could be seen from several other regions (including Kashmir), and there is no evidence linking it to Yashovarman&#x27;s defeat. In fact, the surrounding verses in the poem make it clear that the verse about solar eclipse does not signify any debacle for Yashovarman. Moreover, Jacobi has mistranslated the subsequent verse, which actually states that if Yashovarman&#x27;s order was defied, he twisted his eyebrow (became angry), resulting in great calamities in the realms of those who defied the order.

==== Eastern India ====

According to Goetz, Lalitaditya conquered present-day Bihar, Bengal and Odisha by 735-736 CE. Based on Kalhana&#x27;s account, Goetz theorized that Lalitaditya marched to Gauda after defeating Yashovarman. There, he defeated the Later Gupta ruler Jivitagupta, and then advanced up to the Bay of Bengal through present-day Odisha. Goetz further theorized that Yashovarman supported Lalitaditya in these campaigns as a vassal. In the poem &quot;Gaudavaho&quot;, Yashovarman&#x27;s courtier Vakpati credits him with victories in eastern and southern India. The &quot;Rajatarangini&quot; makes similar claims for Lalitaditya. According to Goetz, the invasion routes described in both these texts are &quot;practically identical&quot;. He, therefore, concludes that Yashovarman participated in Lalitaditya&#x27;s wars as a vassal. Goetz argues that &quot;Gaudavaho&quot; fails to mention this, because Yashovarman&#x27;s court poet wanted to whitewash his master&#x27;s vassal status. &quot;Gaudavaho&quot; mentions that Yashovarman visited the Mandara mountain. According to Goetz, this is the poet&#x27;s way of hiding Yashovarman&#x27;s visit to Lalitaditya&#x27;s court, which was located in the mountainous region.

Shyam Manohar Mishra (1977) rejects Goetz theory, pointing out that no sources (including &quot;Rajatarangini&quot; and &quot;Gaudavaho&quot;) suggest that Yashovarman participated in Lalitaditya&#x27;s subsequent campaigns as a vassal. Mishra believes that the conflict between the two kings happened after Yashovarman&#x27;s successful campaign, which must have &quot;evoked the jealousy and concern of Lalitaditya&quot;.

==== Southern India ====

The term &quot;Ratta&quot; in Kalhana&#x27;s account appears to be a reference to the Rashtrakutas, who ruled the Karnata region. The term &quot;Vindhyas&quot; here cannot refer to the present-day Vindhya mountains: it is probably used for poetic effect, to compare Queen Ratta to the goddess Vindhyavasini (who is said to reside in the Vindhyan region).

Goetz identified Kalhana&#x27;s Queen Ratta with Bhavagana, who was a wife of the Rashtrakuta king Indra I. Goetz speculates that she acted as a queen regent for her son Dantidurga after Indra&#x27;s death, but her rule was threatened by her brother-in-law Krishna I. As a result, she appealed Lalitaditya for help, who arrived in Deccan and fought on her side. Goetz further theorized that Yashovarman and Jivitagupta participated in this campaign as his vassals. His arguments include:

* &quot;Gaudavaho&quot; claims that Yashovarman also invaded Deccan. According to Goetz, had Yashovarman had invaded Deccan alone, this invasion would have taken place before his debacle against Lalitaditya, that is, sometime before 730 CE. But Vijayaditya, the contemporary ruler of Deccan, was a very powerful king. Therefore, Yashovarman could have invaded Deccan only as part of a more powerful force led by Lalitaditya.
* Bhavagana was a Chalukya princess before marriage, and therefore, her Chalukya relatives could have allowed Lalitaditya to pass through northern Deccan, enabling him to easily invade the territory controlled by Krishna.
* Goetz also assumes that Dantidurga threw off Lalitaditya&#x27;s vassalage after the Kashmiri king returned to the north. In his support, he cites Dantidurga&#x27;s Samangad inscription. According to Goetz, this record claims that Dantidurga repulsed &quot;an invasion by the combined rulers of Sindh, Malwa and Kosala&quot;. The contemporary Arab ruler of Sindh would not have allied with the Hindu rulers of Malwa or Kosala. Therefore, this invasion can only refer to Dantidurga&#x27;s successes against the forces of Lalitaditya and his vassals (Yashovarman and Jivitagupta). Malwa here can be interpreted as Yashovarman&#x27;s frontier territory or Jivitagputa&#x27;s paternal territory. Kosala here may refer to the Kosala region (in present-day Uttar Pradesh) controlled by Yashovarman, or the Dakshina Kosala region which was located at the south-western frontier of Gauda. According to Goetz, the term &quot;Sindh&quot; has been used to describe Kashmir in Pratihara inscriptions.

==== Western India ====

Goetz identified Kalhana&#x27;s &quot;Mummuni&quot; with the contemporary Shilahara ruler of Konkan. Although no contemporary Shilahara king by this name is known, there was an 11th-century Shilahara king with the same name. Goetz speculates Lalitaditya&#x27;s Shilahara contemporary was also called Mummuni: his name must have been removed from the Shilahara family records because of his humiliating defeat against Lalitaditya.

Kalhana mentions that Kayya, the king of Lata, built a temple in Kashmir during Lalitaditya&#x27;s reign. Goetz identifies Kayya with Karka II, the Rashtrakuta governor of the Lata region (present-day southern Gujarat). Although Kalhana doesn&#x27;t mention Kayya in connection with Lalitaditya&#x27;s campaign, Goetz argues that a ruler of Lata would not have gone all the way to Kashmir to build a temple. Goetz assumes that he was taken there as a vassal. However, Karka&#x27;s presence in Gujarat is attested by a 757 CE grant inscription. Goetz theorizes that Lalitaditya must have died before this year, and Karka must have returned to Gujarat after his death.

According to Goetz, Lalitaditya invaded Kathiawar (in present-day Gujarat) between 740 and 746 CE. By this time, the local rulers Maitrakas had already been subjugated by the Chalukyas, which would have allowed Lalitaditya to establish his hegemony in the region.

==== Return to Kashmir ====

According to Goetz, Lalitaditya returned to Kashmir, when the Tibetan king Me Agtsom invaded Kashmir around 747 CE. Goetz theorizes that during this return journey, Lalitaditya passed through Ujjain, Chittorgarh, Marwar and Thanesar. He also speculated that the legendary Guhila ruler Bappa Rawal of Chittorgarh served Lalitaditya as a vassal, and died fighting in the Kashmiri king&#x27;s Central Asian campaigns.

Goetz goes on to connect Lalitaditya to the mythological Agnikula legend, according to which some later regional dynasties originated from a fire pit during a sacrificial ceremony at Mount Abu. Goetz speculated that Lalitaditya wanted to leave behind some governors before marching against Tibetans; therefore, he conducted a ceremony to induct the &quot;various Gurjara tribes&quot; into the Hindu political system as Kshatriyas (recognized warriors).

==== Hindu Kush-Pamir region ====

According to Goetz, after returning to Kashmir, Lalitaditya not only repulsed the Tibetans but also invaded the Tarim Basin. Goetz identified Kalhana&#x27;s &quot;sea of sand&quot; as the desert areas of Turkestan and Tibet. Goetz speculated that in 755-756 CE, Lalitaditya invaded the towns in Taklamakan and Gobi deserts, and marched to Kucha and Turfan, after the Tang power declined as a result of the An Lushan Rebellion.

Goetz&#x27; interpretation was widely accepted and cited by the subsequent scholars. However, Tansen Sen (2004) rejects Goetz&#x27; assessment of Lalitaditya&#x27;s exploits as exaggerated, based on his study of the contemporary Chinese and Tibetan records, as well as numismatic evidence. Sen also analyzed the writings of the Korean monk Hyecho (who visited Kashmir in 725 CE, at the beginning of Lalitaditya&#x27;s reign) and the Chinese monk Wukon (who stayed in Kashmir for four years during c. 753-763 CE, after Lalitaditya&#x27;s death). None of these sources support Goetz&#x27; assertion that Lalitaditya managed to establish a vast Kashmiri empire in the Hindu Kush-Pamir region, or that he marched across the Taklamakan desert. Historical evidence indicates that the Tang dynasty retained control of the oasis states in the desert region until the early 780s CE, when the Tibetans established their dominance. There is no evidence of Lalitaditya&#x27;s march to Pamir region either: the &quot;Old Tibetan Annals&quot; establish that a number of northern Pamir rulers sent envoys to pay homage to the Tibetan court in 756-757 CE. This suggests that this area was under control of the Tibetans, whose records do not mention any conflict with Kashmir.

According to Sen&#x27;s theory, the Karkotas achieved successes against Tibetans as part of an alliance with the Tang dynasty. These successes led to development of legends about Kashmir&#x27;s dominance in the southern Hindu Kush-Pamir region. Based on these legends, four centuries later, Kalhana characterized Lalitaditya as a world-conqueror.

Sen points out that according to the &quot;New Book of Tang&quot;, Lalitaditya&#x27;s envoy came to the Tang court with a letter in March–April 933 CE. In this letter, Lalitaditya presents himself as a Tang vassal who had &quot;submitted to the Heavenly Qaghan&quot;. Lalitaditya further explains that the Tibetans had distressed him and another king of Central India by blocking the five great routes. But the two Indian kings had managed to defeat the Tibetans. Finally, Lalitaditya requests the Tang army to arrive at Palur (present-day Gilgit-Baltistan), offering to set up a camp for them beside the Mahapadma lake (modern Wular Lake). He promises to supply provisions for the Tang army, even if it numbered as large as 200,000.

According to the Tang records, the Tang emperor was pleased by Lalitaditya&#x27;s offer, and bestowed the title of &quot;King&quot; upon Lalitaditya. In the subsequent years, Tang forces fought with the Tibetans over Little Palur (present-day Gilgit Valley). The Tangs finally captured it in 747 CE, after three failed attempts. Lalitaditya&#x27;s Kashmir seems to have played a significant role in these conflicts.

Goetz considered the Tokharian origin of Lalitaditya&#x27;s minister Chankuna (IAST: Caṇkuṇa) as an evidence of the Kashmiri hegemony over the Turkic kingdoms. According to Kalhana, Lalitaditya brought Chankuna to Kashmir from the Tuhkhara land (Tokharistan). &quot;Chankuna&quot; is believed to be a Sanskrit transcription of the Chinese title &quot;jiangjun&quot; (&quot;military general&quot;). Goetz speculated that Chankuna was a Tokharian general in the Chinese army, and introduced the Chinese warfare techniques in Kashmir, which enhanced Lalitaditya&#x27;s military campaigns. Sen criticizes this theory, pointing out that Kalhana&#x27;s writings acclaim Chankuna for magical powers, not military expertise. Moreover, the Tokharian origin of Chankuna cannot be considered as concrete evidence of Kashmiri control over southern Hindu Kush region. Ronald M. Davidson believes that Lalitaditya enlisted soldiers from Tokharistan, leveraging his position as a Chinese vassal; these soldiers supported the Chinese against the Tibetans.

The Tang records also mention that an envoy from Tokharistan visited the Tang court in 749 CE, and requested it to renew its alliance with Kashmir by sending the Kashmir king precious gifts. The envoy&#x27;s objective was to enlist the Tang help against the Tibet&#x27;s ally Kashgar. The envoy pointed out that the ruler of Kashmir respected the Chinese, and had a large cavalry and infantry. The Chinese accepted the envoy&#x27;s recommendation, and in 750 CE, the Tang general Gao Xianzhi conquered Kashgar. These records suggest that Lalitaditya provided military assistance and logistical support to Gao Xianzhi&#x27;s forces in this campaign. According to art historians Denise Patry Leidy and Donna K. Strahan, Kashmir also participated at the Battle of Talas as a Tang ally.

Tansen Sen believes that the &quot;Bhauttas&quot; (Tibetans) and the &quot;Daradas&quot; mentioned by Kalhana may have been Lalitaditya&#x27;s rivals in these 747 CE and 750 CE campaigns.

== Personal life ==

Lalitaditya was succeeded by his sons: first Kuvalayapida and then Vajraditya. Kuvalayapida was a son of queen Kamaladevi, while Vajraditya was a son of Chakramardika. Vajraditya was succeeded by his sons Prthivyapida and Samgramapida.

== Public works ==

=== Cities and towns ===
Kalhana states that Lalitaditya established the following cities and towns:

* &quot;Sunishchita-pura&quot;, when he decided (&quot;sunishchita&quot;) to conquer the world
* &quot;Darpita-pura&quot;, when he felt proud
* &quot;Phala-pura&quot;, when he received fruit (&quot;phala&quot;). M. A. Stein located Phalapura near Parihasapura and the confluence of Vitasta and Sindhu.
* &quot;Parnotsa&quot;, when he took a leaf (&quot;parna&quot;). Stein identified this town with modern Poonch.
* Lokapunya town, which is identified with the area near the Lokabhavana spring near modern Larikpur.
* &quot;Parihasapura&quot;, which was better than the residence of Indra. This city became Lalitaditya&#x27;s residence for a brief period, while Srinagara continued to serve as the other capital. Parihasapura had been deserted and ruined by the time of Kalhana.
* Several towns in salty wastelands, to ensure that anyone suffering from thirst could find water to drink.

Kalhana also mentions that while Lalitaditya was away from his kingdom, his architect built a town called Lalitapura after him, but this angered Lalitaditya. One theory identifies this place with the modern Lethipora (or Latpor). Lalitaditya&#x27;s wife Chakramardika is also said to have built the city of Chakrapura with 7,000 houses.

According to Kalhana, Lalitaditya once ordered the Pravarapura town to be burnt down, while in a drunken stupor. The town had been built by an earlier king named Pravarasena, and Lalitaditya did not want another town as beautiful as Parihasapura to exist. However, when Lalitaditya came to his senses, he regretted his decision. He was relieved when his ministers informed him that they had not actually carried out his order. He was pleased with his ministers&#x27; wise decision, and instructed them to similarly ignore his commands whenever he was drunk.

=== Shrines ===

Kalhana states that Lalitaditya constructed a shrine in every town, village, river, sea and island. His wives, ministers and attendants consecrated hundreds of images in these temples. Lalitaditya placed idols of the deities&#x27; attendants, made of gold and silver, in these shrines.

==== Vishnu shrines ====

According to Kalhana, Lalitaditya commissioned shrines dedicated to various aspects of Vishnu, including Keshava, Nṛhari and Muktasvamin:

* Built a shrine of Keshava in Darpitapura
* Installed an image of Nṛhari in Strirajya. This image was suspended in air by fixing magnets above and below it.
* Built the Muktasvamin shrine at Hushkapura (modern Ushkur).
* Made an offering to Vishnu after building the Lokapunya town.
* Installed several images of Vishnu and his aspects in Parihasapura:
** a silver image of &quot;Parihasa-Keshava&quot; (made of 84,000 of &quot;pala&quot;s; the &quot;pala&quot; is ancient unit equivalent to 4 &quot;tolaka&quot;s)
** a gold image of &quot;Mukta-Keshava&quot; (made of 84,000 &quot;tolaka&quot;s of gold)
** a gold image of &quot;Maha-Varaha&quot;
** a silver image of &quot;Govardhana-Dhara&quot;
* Raised a pillar which measured 54 hands in height, and had an image of Garuda (Vishnu&#x27;s vahana) at the top.

Others also constructed Vishnu shrines during his reign:

* Lalitaditya&#x27;s queen Kamalavati established Kamalahatta (a market), where she installed a silver idol of &quot;Kamala-Keshava&quot;.
* Kayya, the king of Lata, built the famous shrine of Kayyasvamin.

Kalhana also mentions a legend describing the discovery of two ancient idols: Lalitaditya, who was a skilled horse-rider, once took an untrained horse to a wasteland alone. There he saw some lovely dancing girls, who said that they belonged to a temple in the Suravardhamana village located in the wasteland. Next, day the king had the wasteland dug up. This excavation resulted in discovery of two decayed temples, each with an idol of Keshava. The inscriptions on these idols indicated that they had been made by Rama and Lakshmana. The king brought these idols to Parihasapura, where he erected a stone shrine beside the Parihasa-Keshava temple. He installed the &quot;Rama-svamin&quot; (Rama&#x27;s idol) in this stone building. His queen Chakramardika installed the &quot;Lakshmana-svamin&quot; (Lakshmana&#x27;s idol) beside her Chakreshvara shrine.

According to Kalhana, the &quot;Rama-svamin&quot; idol was later destroyed by the men of Gauda to avenge their king&#x27;s assassination by Lalitaditya. The Gauda king had come to Kashmir on a visit, and the idol of &quot;Parihasa-Keshava&quot; had been made a surety for his safety. Despite this, Lalitaditya had him assassinated in Trigrami (modern Trigam). To avenge their king&#x27;s treacherous murder, his servants came from Gauda to Kashmir, determined to destroy Lalitaditya&#x27;s beloved &quot;Parihasa-Keshava&quot; idol. They entered Kashmir under the pretext of visiting the shrine of the goddess Sharada. Lalitaditya was away from Parihasapura at that time, and the attendants of the Parihasa-Keshava temple closed its gates to prevent the Gauda men from entering the shrine. The Gauda men mistook the &quot;Ramasvamin&quot; idol for the &quot;Parihasa-Keshava&quot; idol, and destroyed it, before being killed by Lalitaditya&#x27;s soldiers.

==== Buddhist shrines ====

Kalhana also credits Lalitaditya with building the following Buddhist shrines:

* Built a large vihara with stupa at Hushkapura (modern Ushkur, where the remains of a stupa and a Shiva shrine have been discovered). The Chinese pilgrim Ou-Kong mentions the &quot;Moung-ti&quot; vihara among his list of Kashmiri monasteries; Stein identifies this vihara with the Ushkur site, and theorizes that &quot;Moung-ti&quot; is the Chinese transcription of &quot;Mukta&quot;.
* Built the &quot;Rajavihara&quot; with a large &quot;chatuh-shala&quot; (square), a large chaitya, and a large image of the &quot;Jina&quot; (the Buddha).
* Erected a very high statue of the Brhadbuddha (&quot;Great Buddha&quot;), made of 84,000 &quot;prastha&quot;s of copper (the &quot;prastha&quot; is an ancient unit equivalent to 64 &quot;tolaka&quot;s).

The king&#x27;s subjects are also said to have built Buddhist shrines:

* Kayya, the king of Lata, also built the famous &quot;Kayya-vihara&quot;, which later became the residence of the bhikshu Sarvajnamitra.
* Chankuna established &quot;Chankuna-vihara&quot; (IAST: Cankunavihara), which included a tall stupa and golden image of the &quot;Jina&quot;s.
* Chankuna also established another vihara (with a chaitya) in Srinagara.
* Chankuna&#x27;s son-in-law and physician Ishanachandra also built a vihara after obtaining wealth through the blessings of Takshaka.

==== Shiva shrines ====
According to Kalhana:

* Lalitaditya took 1 crore from Bhutesha (shrine of Shiva) while embarking on world conquest, and gave 11 crores as expiatory offering upon his return to Kashmir. He constructed the Jyeshtharudra stone temple dedicated to Shiva, and granted land and villages to the shrine. The Bhutesha shrine is identified with modern Wangath (Bhutser or Buthser).
* His minister Mitrasharman installed a Shiva linga called &quot;Mitreshvara&quot;.
* A teacher named Bhappata built the linga called &quot;Bhappateshvara&quot;.
* Other people also built several lingas, known as &quot;Rakchatesha&quot;.

==== Surya shrines ====

Kalhana mentions that Lalitaditya built a shrine of Aditya (the sun god) in Lalitapura, and granted the land of Kanyakubja and its villages to this shrine. In addition, he commissioned the Martanda sun temple and the surrounding town.

=== Other activities ===

Kalhana states that Lalitaditya made an arrangement at Chakradhara to distribute the Vitasta river water to several villages using a series of water wheels. Chakradhara is identified with modern Tsakdar Udar plateau near Bijbehara. Ishanadevi, a wife of his minister Chankuna, constructed a water-well whose pure water cured the sick.

According to Kalhana, Lalitaditya collected wise men from different countries, just &quot;as the wind collects masses of full-blown flowers&quot;. For example, from Tuhkhara, he brought Chankuna (IAST: Caṇkuṇa), who had great qualities.

Kalhana states that Lalitaditya started the &quot;Sahasra-bhakta&quot; festival at Parihasapura. During this festival, he distributed 100,001 food dishes beside dakshinas (donations). The 11th century Persian writer Al-Biruni states that the people of Kashmir organized an annual festival on the second day of the Chaitra month to celebrate their past king Muttai&#x27;s alleged victory over the Turks. This Muttai can be identified with &quot;Muktapida&quot;, that is, Lalitaditya. According to Al-Biruni, Kashmiris claimed that Muttai as well as most of the other Kashmiri kings &quot;ruled over the whole world&quot;. Al-Biruni dismissed these claims as lies because of chronological inconsistencies.

== Alleged miraculous powers ==

Kalhana declares that Lalitaditya&#x27;s commands were not disobeyed even by the gods. Once, while encamped on the shores of the eastern ocean in the cold weather, Lalitaditya ordered &quot;kapittha&quot; fruits to be brought to him. His attendants were perplexed, as this fruit was not common in the given season and place. But then, Indra&#x27;s divine messenger brought these fruits to him from the heaven. The messenger explained to him that in his previous birth, he offered his own food and water to a starving Brahmin during a famine. As a result of this good deed, Lalitaditya became entitled to a hundred wishes in the heaven. For example, the king could make streams of sweet water appear in deserts at his mere wish. The messenger cautioned Lalitaditya that he had few wishes left, and therefore, he should not waste these wishes on frivolous requests such as ordering a fruit.

Kalhana also claims that Lalitaditya&#x27;s minister Chankuna was a brother of the magician Kanakavarsha (literally &quot;the one who rains gold&quot;). He produced gold in the king&#x27;s treasury using his magic powers. Once the king&#x27;s army was stranded in the &quot;Panchanada&quot; country (identified with Punjab), because the local streams had &quot;united&quot; and could not be crossed. Chankuna magically parted the waters by throwing a &quot;mani&quot; (gem) into the streams, enabling the king&#x27;s army to cross the waters. He then retrieved his &quot;mani&quot; by using another &quot;mani&quot;, and the streams were united again. The king requested these two &quot;mani&quot;s from Chankuna, offering anything else in return. Chankuna asked for an idol of &quot;Sugata&quot; (Buddha), which had been brought to Kashmir from Magadha on an elephant. The king fulfilled this demand, and Chankuna placed the idol in his &quot;vihara&quot;. This image still existed in the time of Kalhana, and according to him, the metal bands fastened around it proved that it was once fixed on an elephant.

Kalhana also claims that Lalitaditya made several streams appear by pushing his spear (&quot;kuntavahini&quot;) into the ground. Narrating one such incident, he states that one day, when Lalitaditya was engaged in the world conquest, a wounded man came to him. The man, whose limbs and nose had been chopped off, introduced himself as a minister of the rival king of Sikata-sindhu (&quot;Ocean of the Sand&quot;). He said that he had been punished for advising his king to accept Lalitaditya&#x27;s suzerainty. Lalitaditya promised to punish the rival king, and had the wounded minister restored to health under his care. The minister then encouraged Lalitaditya to march to the Sikata-sindhu country through a shortcut, and led his army to a wasteland without water. When Lalitaditya&#x27;s army was on the verge of dying of thirst, the minister revealed that this was all a set-up: he was actually loyal to the rival king and intended to misguide Lalitaditya and his army to their death. Lalitaditya announced that he was impressed with the minister&#x27;s loyalty to his own master, but declared that his plan would not be successful. The Kashmiri king then put his sword into the ground, making a stream come out of the water. He then reached Sikata-sindhu, where he reduced the rival king to the same pitiful condition as his limbless minister.

Kalhana mentions that several other wonderful legends about Lalitaditya existed during his time, but he could not include them all in &quot;Rajatarangini&quot; because he did not want to break the flow of the narrative.

<doc id="1308389" wikidata="Q359180" url="?curid=1308389" title="Inflation-indexed bond">
<text>Daily inflation-indexed bonds (also known as inflation-linked bonds or colloquially as linkers) are bonds where the principal is indexed to inflation or deflation on a daily basis. They are thus designed to hedge the inflation risk of a bond. The first known inflation-indexed bond was issued by the Massachusetts Bay Company in 1780. The market has grown dramatically since the British government began issuing inflation-linked Gilts in 1981. As of 2019, government-issued inflation-linked bonds comprise over $3.1 trillion of the international debt market. The inflation-linked market primarily consists of sovereign bonds, with privately issued inflation-linked bonds constituting a small portion of the market.

==Structure==
Daily inflation-indexed bonds pay a periodic coupon that is equal to the product of the principal and the nominal coupon rate.

For some bonds, such as in the case of TIPS, the underlying principal of the bond changes, which results in a higher interest payment when multiplied by the same rate. For example, if the annual coupon of the bond were 5% and the underlying principal of the bond were 100 units, the annual payment would be 5 units. If the inflation index increased by 10%, the principal of the bond would increase to 110 units. The coupon rate would remain at 5%, resulting in an interest payment of 110 x 5% = 5.5 units.

For other bonds, such as the Series I United States Savings Bonds, the interest rate is adjusted according to inflation.

The relationship between coupon payments, breakeven daily inflation and real interest rates is given by the Fisher equation. A rise in coupon payments is a result of an increase in inflation expectations, real rates, or both.

===Real yield===
The real yield of any bond is the annualized growth rate, less the rate of inflation over the same period. This calculation is often difficult in principle in the case of a nominal bond, because the yields of such a bond are specified for future periods in nominal terms, while the inflation over the period is an unknown rate at the time of the calculation. However, in the case of inflation-indexed bonds such as TIPS, the bond yield is specified as a rate in excess of inflation, so the real yield can be easily calculated using a standard bond calculation formula.

==Global issuance==
The most liquid instruments are Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), a type of US Treasury security, with about $500 billion in issuance. The other important inflation-linked markets are the UK Index-linked Gilts with over $300 billion outstanding and the French OATi/OAT€i market with about $200 billion outstanding. Germany, Canada, Greece, Australia, Italy, Japan, Sweden, Israel and Iceland also issue inflation-indexed bonds, as well as a number of Emerging Markets, most prominently Brazil.



==Inflation-indexed bond indices==

Inflation-indexed bond indices include the family of Barclays Inflation Linked Bond Indices, such as the Barclays Inflation Linked Euro Government Bond Indices, and the Lehman Brothers U.S. Treasury: U.S. TIPS index.

<text>An index (: usually indexes, more rarely indices) is a list of words or phrases (&#x27;headings&#x27;) and associated pointers (&#x27;locators&#x27;) to where useful material relating to that heading can be found in a document or collection of documents. Examples are an index in the back matter of a book and an index that serves as a library catalog. An index differs from a word index, or &quot;concordance&quot;, in focusing on the subject of the text rather than the exact words in a text, and it differs from a table of contents because the index is ordered by subject, regardless of whether it is early or late in the book, while the listed items in a table of contents is placed in the same order as the book.

In a traditional &quot;back-of-the-book index&quot;, the headings will include names of people, places, events, and concepts selected as being relevant and of interest to a possible reader of the book. The indexer performing the selection may be the author, the editor, or a professional indexer working as a third party. The pointers are typically page numbers, paragraph numbers or section numbers.

In a library catalog the words are authors, titles, subject headings, etc., and the pointers are call numbers. Internet search engines (such as Google) and full-text searching help provide access to information but are not as selective as an index, as they provide non-relevant links, and may miss relevant information if it is not phrased in exactly the way they expect.

Perhaps the most advanced investigation of problems related to book indexes is made in the development of topic maps, which started as a way of representing the knowledge structures inherent in traditional back-of-the-book indexes. The concept embodied by book indexes lent its name to database indexes, which similarly provide an abridged way to look up information in a larger collection, albeit one for computer use rather than human use.

== Earliest examples in English ==
In the English language, indexes have been referred to as early as 1593, as can be seen from lines in Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;Hero and Leander&quot; of that year:

&quot;Therefore, even as an index to a book&quot;
&quot;So to his mind was young Leander&#x27;s look.&quot;

A similar reference to indexes is in Shakespeare&#x27;s lines from &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot; (I.3.344), written nine years later:

&quot;And in such indexes, although small pricks&quot; 
&quot;To their subsequent volumes, there is seen&quot; 
&quot;The baby figure of the giant mass&quot; 
&quot;Of things to come at large.&quot;
But according to G. Norman Knight, &quot;at that period, as often as not, by an &#x27;index to a book&#x27; was meant what we should now call a table of contents.&quot; Until about the end of the nineteenth century, books, fiction as well as non-fiction, sometimes had very detailed chapter titles, which could be several sentences long.

Among the first indexes – in the modern sense – to a book in the English language was Leonard Mascall&#x27;s &quot;A booke of the arte and maner how to plant and graffe all sortes of trees&quot; printed in 1575. Another was one in Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Parallel Lives&quot;, in Sir Thomas North&#x27;s 1595 translation. A section entitled &quot;An Alphabetical Table of the most material contents of the whole book&quot; may be found in Henry Scobell&#x27;s &quot;Acts and Ordinances of Parliament&quot; of 1658. This section comes after &quot;An index of the general titles comprised in the ensuing Table&quot;. Both of these indexes predate the index to Alexander Cruden&#x27;s &quot;Concordance&quot; (1737), which is erroneously held to be the earliest index found in an English book.

== Etymology and plural ==
The word is derived from Latin, in which &quot;index&quot; means &quot;one who points out&quot;, an &quot;indication&quot;, or a &quot;forefinger&quot;.

In Latin, the plural form of the word is &quot;indices&quot;. In English, the plural &quot;indices&quot; is commonly used in mathematical and computing contexts, and sometimes in bibliographical contexts – for example, in the 17-volume &quot;Women in World History: A Biographical Encyclopedia&quot; (1999–2002). However, this form is now seen as an archaism by many writers and commentators, who prefer the anglicised plural &quot;indexes&quot;. &quot;Indexes&quot; is widely used in the publishing industry; in the International Standard ISO 999, &quot;Information and documentation – Guidelines for the content, organization and presentation of indexes&quot;; and is preferred by the &quot;Oxford Style Manual&quot;. &quot;The Chicago Manual of Style&quot; allows both forms.

G. Norman Knight quotes Shakespeare&#x27;s lines from &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot; (I.3.344) – &quot;And in such indexes ...&quot; – and comments:

&quot;But the real importance of this passage is that it establishes for all time the correct literary plural; we can leave the Latin form &quot;indices&quot; to the mathematicians (and similarly &quot;appendices&quot; to the anatomists).&quot;

== Indexing process ==

=== Conventional indexing ===

The indexer reads through the text, identifying indexable concepts (those for which the text provides useful information and which will be of relevance for the text&#x27;s readership). The indexer creates index headings to represent those concepts, which are phrased such that they can be found when in alphabetical order (so, for example, one would write &#x27;indexing process&#x27; rather than &#x27;how to create an index&#x27;). These headings and their associated locators (indicators to position in the text) are entered into specialist indexing software which handles the formatting of the index and facilitates the editing phase. The index is then edited to impose consistency throughout the index.

Indexers must analyze the text to enable presentation of concepts and ideas in the index that may not be named within the text. The index is intended to help the reader, researcher, or information professional, rather than the author, find information, so the professional indexer must act as a liaison between the text and its ultimate user.

In the United States, according to tradition, the index for a non-fiction book is the responsibility of the author, but most authors do not actually do it. Most indexing is done by freelancers hired by authors, publishers or an independent business which manages the production of a book, publishers or book packagers. Some publishers and database companies employ indexers.

Before indexing software existed, indexes were created using slips of paper or, later, index cards. After hundreds of such slips or cards were filled out (as the indexer worked through the pages of the book proofs), they could then be shuffled by hand into alphabetical order, at which point they served as manuscript to be typeset into the printed index.

== Indexing software ==

Software is available to aid the indexer in building a book index. There are several dedicated indexing software programs available to assist with the special sorting and copying needs involved in index preparation.

=== Embedded indexing ===

Embedded indexing involves including the index headings in the midst of the text itself, but surrounded by codes so that they are not normally displayed. A usable index is then generated automatically from the embedded text using the position of the embedded headings to determine the locators. Thus, when the pagination is changed the index can be regenerated with the new locators.

LaTeX documents support embedded indexes primarily through the MakeIndex package. Several widely used XML DTDs, including DocBook and TEI, have elements that allow index creation directly in the XML files. Most word processing software, such as StarWriter/OpenOffice.org Writer, Microsoft Word, and WordPerfect, as well as some desktop publishing software (for example, FrameMaker and InDesign), as well as other tools (for example, MadCap Software&#x27;s Flare), have some facility for embedded indexing as well. TExtract and IndexExploit support embedded indexing of Microsoft Word documents.

An embedded index requires more time to create than a conventional static index; however, an embedded index can save time in the long run when the material is updated or repaginated. This is because, with a static index, if even a few pages change, the entire index must be revised or recreated while, with an embedded index, only the pages that changed need updating or indexing.

== Purpose ==

Indexes are also designed to help the reader find information quickly and easily. A complete and truly useful index is not simply a list of the words and phrases used in a publication (which is properly called a concordance), but an organized map of its contents, including cross-references, grouping of like concepts, and other useful intellectual analysis.

Sample back-of-the-book index excerpt:

:sage, 41–42. &quot;See also&quot; Herbs ← directing the reader to related terms
:Scarlet Sages. &quot;See&quot; &quot;Salvia coccinea&quot; ← redirecting the reader to term used in the text
:shade plants ← grouping term (may not appear in the text; may be generated by indexer)
::hosta, 93 ← subentries
::myrtle, 46
::Solomon&#x27;s 
:sunflower, 47 ← regular entry

In books, indexes are usually placed near the end (this is commonly known as &quot;BoB&quot; or back-of-book indexing). They complement the table of contents by enabling access to information by specific subject, whereas contents listings enable access through broad divisions of the text arranged in the order they occur. It has been remarked that, while &quot;[a]t first glance the driest part of the book, on closer inspection the index may provide both interest and amusement from time to time.&quot;

== Index quality ==

Some principles of good indexing include:
* Ensuring each topic/section includes a variety of relevant index entries; use two or three entries per topic
* Understanding the audience and understand what kind of index entries they&#x27;re likely to look for
* Use the same form throughout (singular vs. plural, capitalisation, etc.), using standard indexing conventions

Indexing pitfalls:
* Significant topics with no index entries at all
* Indexing &#x27;mere mentions&#x27;: &quot;But John Major was no Winston Churchill...&quot; indexed under &#x27;Churchill, Winston&#x27;
* Circular cross-references: &#x27;Felidae. &quot;See&quot; Cats&#x27;; &#x27;Cats. &quot;See&quot; Felidae&#x27;
* References to discussions of a single topic scattered among several main headings: &#x27;Cats, 50–62&#x27;; &#x27;Felidae, 175–183&#x27;
* Inconsistently indexing similar topics
* Confusing similar names: Henry V of England, Henri V of France
* Incorrect alphabetization: &#x27;α-Linolenic acid&#x27; under &#x27;A&#x27; instead of &#x27;L&#x27;
* Inappropriate inversions: &#x27;processors, word&#x27; for &#x27;word processors&#x27;
* Inappropriate subheadings: &#x27;processors: food, 213–6; word, 33–7&#x27;
* Computer indexing from section headings: e.g. &#x27;Getting to know your printer&#x27; under &#x27;G&#x27;

== Indexer roles ==
Some indexers specialize in specific formats, such as scholarly books, microforms, web indexing (the application of a back-of-book-style index to a website or intranet), search engine indexing, database indexing (the application of a pre-defined controlled vocabulary such as MeSH to articles for inclusion in a database), and periodical indexing (indexing of newspapers, journals, magazines).

Some indexers with expertise in controlled vocabularies also work as taxonomists and ontologists.

Some indexers specialize in particular subject areas, such as anthropology, business, computers, economics, education, government documents, history, law, mathematics, medicine, psychology, and technology. An indexer can be found for any subject.

== References in popular culture ==

== Societies ==
The American Society for Indexing, Inc. (ASI) is a national association founded in 1968 to promote excellence in indexing and increase awareness of the value of well-designed indexes. ASI serves indexers, librarians, abstractors, editors, publishers, database producers, data searchers, product developers, technical writers, academic professionals, researchers and readers, and others concerned with indexing. It is the only professional organization in the United States devoted solely to the advancement of indexing, abstracting and related methods of information retrieval.

<doc id="1308402" wikidata="Q117026" url="?curid=1308402" title="Thomas Neill Cream">
<text>Thomas Neill Cream (27 May 1850 – 15 November 1892), also known as the Lambeth Poisoner, was a Scottish-Canadian medical doctor and serial killer who poisoned his victims with strychnine. Cream murdered up to ten people in three countries, targeting mostly lower-class women, sex workers and pregnant women seeking abortions. He was convicted and sentenced to death, and was hanged on 15 November 1892.

A popular rumour suggested that Cream&#x27;s last words were a (false) confession that he was Jack the Ripper – but official records show that he was in prison in Illinois at the time of the Ripper murders.

== Early life ==
Thomas Neill Cream was born in Glasgow on 27 May 1850. Cream&#x27;s family moved to Canada, then still a dominion of the British Empire, in 1854; he was raised outside Quebec City. Cream attended the now-defunct Lachute Academy before becoming a student at McGill University in Montreal, graduating with an MDCM degree in 1876. He received his post-graduate training at St Thomas&#x27;s Hospital Medical School in London, and in 1878 obtained additional qualifications as a physician and surgeon in Edinburgh. Cream then returned to North America seeking to practise in a community in need of physicians; after a brief experience in Des Moines, Iowa, he relocated to London, Ontario.

In 1876, while living in Waterloo, Quebec, Cream met and courted a woman named Flora Brooks. When Brooks became pregnant a few months later after Cream had promised to marry her, he attempted to perform an abortion but failed. With Brooks left severely ill, Cream attempted to escape to Montreal but was caught by Brooks&#x27; father, who forced him to return and to marry her. The day after the wedding, Cream left for England to continue his medical education. The Brooks family never saw or heard from him again. Brooks herself almost fully recovered but died of consumption in 1877.

== Murders ==
=== London, Ontario ===
Cream returned to North America in 1878 and established a medical practice in London, Ontario. He was charged under Ontario&#x27;s Medical Act with practising without a license and later pleaded guilty. However, this did not deter patients from visiting his office. 

In 1879, Catharine Hutchinson Gardner was found dead in a privy behind Cream&#x27;s office at 204 Dundas Street. She was pregnant and had been murdered with a handkerchief soaked in chloroform. Cream had refused to help her with an abortion, instead urging her to accuse a local businessman of being the father. Cream claimed Gardner had threatened to poison herself when he had not agreed to perform the abortion, and that she had written him a letter in which she named the businessman as the father. However, Gardner&#x27;s family and roommate denied that she had written it, as the signature and handwriting on the letter did not match her own, and it was dismissed as forgery. Despite rumours and overwhelming evidence against Cream, authorities took no further action and the case was never solved.

=== Chicago ===
Cream established a medical practice not far from the red-light district in Chicago, offering illegal abortions to sex workers. He was investigated in August 1880, after the death of Mary Anne Faulkner, a woman on whom he had allegedly operated; he escaped prosecution due to lack of evidence. In December 1880, another patient, Miss Stack, died after treatment by Cream, and he subsequently attempted to blackmail the pharmacist who had filled the prescription.

In April 1881, a woman named Alice Montgomery died of strychnine poisoning following an abortion in a rooming house barely a block from Cream&#x27;s office. The case was ruled a murder but never solved. The location, time period, and method make Cream a likely suspect.

On 14 July 1881, Daniel Stott died of strychnine poisoning at his home in Boone County, Illinois, after Cream supplied him with an alleged remedy for epilepsy. The death was attributed to natural causes, but Cream wrote to the coroner blaming the pharmacist for the death after he again attempted blackmail. This time, Cream was arrested, along with Julia A. (Abbey) Stott, who had allegedly become Cream&#x27;s mistress and procured poison from Cream to kill her husband. She turned state&#x27;s evidence to avoid jail, laying the blame on Cream, which left him to face a murder conviction on his own. He was sentenced to life imprisonment in Joliet Prison. Daniel Stott&#x27;s friends erected a tombstone at his grave, which reads: &quot;Daniel Stott Died June 12, 1881 Aged 61 Years, poisoned by his wife and Dr Cream.&quot;

Cream was released in July 1891. Governor Joseph W. Fifer had commuted his sentence after Cream&#x27;s brother pleaded for leniency and allegedly bribed the authorities.

=== London ===
Using money inherited from his father, who had died in 1887, Cream sailed for England, arriving in Liverpool on 1 October 1891 (three years after the Jack the Ripper killings had been committed). He went to London and took lodgings at 103 Lambeth Palace Road. At the time, Lambeth was riddled with poverty, petty crime, and sex work.

On 13 October 1891, Ellen &quot;Nellie&quot; Donworth, a 19-year-old sex worker, received two letters from Cream, and agreed to meet him. He offered her a drink from a bottle. She became severely ill that night and died from what was later found to be strychnine poisoning. During her inquest, Cream wrote to the coroner under the pseudonym A. O&#x27;Brien, Detective, offering to name the murderer in return for a £300,000 reward. He also wrote to W. F. D. Smith, owner of the W H Smith bookstalls, accusing him of the murder and demanding money for his silence.

On 20 October, Cream met a 27-year-old sex worker named Matilda Clover, and offered her pills, instructing her to take four before bed. She began experiencing violent, painful spasms later that night and died two hours later. Her death was assumed to be heart failure due to alcohol withdrawal. Cream, under the name M. Malone, wrote a letter to the prominent physician William Broadbent, claiming to have evidence of his involvement in Clover&#x27;s death and demanding £25,000 for his silence. Broadbent contacted Scotland Yard, and they set a trap for the blackmailer when he would come to collect the money. However, no one was caught.

On 2 April 1892, after a vacation in Canada, Cream returned to London, where he met Louise Harvey (née Harris), a sex worker. He offered her two pills, insisting she swallow them right away. Harvey, suspicious of him, pretended to swallow the pills he had given her but palmed them and secretly threw them away.

On 11 April, Cream met two sex workers, Alice Marsh, 21, and Emma Shrivell, 18, and spent the night with them in their flat, then before leaving offered them three pills each and a can of tinned salmon. Both women died later that night from strychnine poisoning.

=== Capture ===
Through his blackmail letters, Cream succeeded in drawing close attention to himself. Not only did the police quickly determine the innocence of those accused, but they noticed something telling in the accusations made by the anonymous letter-writer: he had referred to the murder of Matilda Clover. Clover&#x27;s death had been registered under natural causes, related to her drinking. The police quickly realised that the false accuser who had written the letter was the serial killer now referred to in the newspapers as the &quot;Lambeth Poisoner&quot;.

Not long afterwards, Cream met a policeman from New York City who was visiting London. The policeman had heard of the Lambeth Poisoner, and Cream gave him a brief tour of where the various victims had lived. The American happened to mention it to a British policeman who found Cream&#x27;s detailed knowledge of the case suspicious.

The police at Scotland Yard put Cream under surveillance and soon discovered his habit of visiting sex workers. They also conducted an investigation in the United States and Canada and learned about their suspect&#x27;s history, including the conviction for a murder by poison in 1881.

On 3 June 1892, Cream was arrested for the murder of Matilda Clover, and on 13 July he was formally charged with the murders of Clover, Donworth, Marsh, and Shrivell, the attempted murder of Harvey, and extortion; his medicine/poisoning kit (taken in as evidence) is now in the Crime Museum. From the start, he insisted he was only &quot;Dr Thomas Neill&quot;, not Thomas Neill Cream, and the newspapers usually referred to him as &quot;Dr Neill&quot; in their coverage of the proceedings.

At the inquest into Matilda Clover&#x27;s death that was held by Athelstan Braxton Hicks in July 1892, he read out a letter signed by Jack the Ripper, declaring &quot;Dr Neill&quot; innocent, which produced laughter, including from &quot;Neill&quot;. The jury returned the verdict that Matilda Clover died from strychnine poisoning administered by &quot;Thomas Neill&quot;.

==Trial and execution ==
His trial lasted from 17 to 21 October 1892. After a deliberation lasting only 12 minutes, the jury found him guilty of all counts, and Justice Henry Hawkins sentenced him to death.

The day before his execution, he made a new will leaving his estate to his solicitors. This will revoked a previous will he had made on 7 January 1892, naming Miss Laura Sabatini of Berkhamsted, who he had become engaged to marry on 23 December 1891, as his executor and heir.

Less than a month after his conviction, on 15 November, Cream was hanged at Newgate Prison by James Billington. As was customary with all executed criminals, his body was buried on the same day beneath the flagstones of the prison - along with other executed criminals- marked by one initial. His body was disinterred in 1902 and moved to City of London Cemetery. He is now buried in an unmarked grave in section 339.

=== &quot;I am Jack the...&quot; ===

Billington claimed that Cream&#x27;s last words on the scaffold were &quot;I am Jack The...&quot; Billington promoted this alleged incident as proof that he was responsible for executing the notorious Victorian serial killer Jack the Ripper. These claims are unsubstantiated, as police officials and others who attended the execution made no mention of any such event. Moreover, Cream was in prison at the time of the Ripper murders in 1888, so it would have been impossible for him to be Jack the Ripper.

Ripperologist Donald Bell speculated that Cream had bribed officials and been let out of prison before his official release, and Sir Edward Marshall-Hall speculated that Cream&#x27;s prison term had been served by a look-alike in his place. Such notions are extremely unlikely and contradict all known evidence given by the Illinois authorities, newspapers of the time, Cream&#x27;s solicitors, Cream&#x27;s family, and Cream himself.

One of Cream&#x27;s biographers suggested that Cream, on the scaffold and about to be hanged, was so frightened that he lost control of his bodily functions and stammered &quot;I am ejaculating&quot;, which could have been mistaken for &quot;I am Jack&quot;.

English-Canadian writer Chris Scott won an Arthur Ellis Award for Best Crime Novel in 1989 for &quot;Jack&quot;, a novel based on the premise that Cream was Jack the Ripper.

== Analysis ==
The motivation for the series of poisonings has never been settled. It has generally been assumed that Cream was a sadist who enjoyed the thought of his victims&#x27; agonised deaths, and his control over them (even if he was not physically present to witness these). However, Cream was also interested in money, as evidenced by his attempts at extortion in almost all of his crimes, so it remains a possibility that he committed the murders as part of ill-planned attempts to profit from them. From the start of the series of crimes Cream wrote blackmail notes to prominent people, and the poisoning of his one known male victim, Daniel Stott, was committed with the hope that Stott&#x27;s wealthy widow would share the deceased&#x27;s estate with him.

In addition to the five poisonings Cream was convicted of, he is suspected of the murder of his wife Flora Brooks in 1877, and of at least four other women who died in his care while undergoing abortions.

Cream was the main antagonist of the 1990 BBC Four radio play, &quot;Sherlock Holmes: The Adventure Of The Pimlico Poisoner&quot;. 

In the first episode (in 2000) of &quot;Murder Rooms: Mysteries of the Real Sherlock Holmes&quot;, the young Arthur Conan Doyle and Joseph Bell pursue a murder case that involves a Thomas Neill, played by Alec Newman. At the end, a postscript further identifies him as Thomas Neill Cream, who attended medical school alongside Conan Doyle.

In the 2015 BBC One television series &quot;River&quot;, Cream appears frequently to and converses with D.I. John River as a &quot;manifest&quot;.

<doc id="1308408" wikidata="Q5051740" url="?curid=1308408" title="Catchers (band)">
<text>Catchers are an Irish indie pop band formed in 1993 and led by singer-songwriter Dale Grundle with Alice Lemon (vocals/keyboards). Former band members include Peter Kelly (drums), Ger FitzGerald (bass until 1995), Craig Carpenter (bass, 1996 onwards), and Jonathan Lord (lead guitar, 1998). Grundle and Lemon have known each other since their teens in Portstewart, Northern Ireland. In 2006, Grundle formed The Sleeping Years. In 2021, Dale and Alice began writing new material with drummer Roger Luxton, releasing Catchers’ single &quot;Something&#x27;s Taking Over Me&quot; on 5 November 2021.

==Biography==
Early demos were sent to various London-based labels in 1994 and caught the attention of Setanta Records supremo, Keith Cullen. Their first release, a 7&quot; called &quot;Cotton dress&quot;, was recorded with Divine Comedy producer Darren Allison at Dave Stewart&#x27;s London studio and became Melody Maker&#x27;s Single Of The Week. &quot;Catchers are sublime, enchanting and some strange kind of wonderful&quot; (Melody Maker). A great deal of press attention followed, especially in France where, on the strengths of the &quot;Cotton Dress&quot; single alone, the band was offered a prestigious Black Session on C&#x27;est Lenoir, a legendary Radio France program.

&quot;Mute&quot;, the band&#x27;s first album, was produced by Mike Hedges at his studio in Normandy, France. &quot;Mute&quot; was released at the end of September 1994 to critical acclaim on both sides of the English Channel, especially in France. &quot;Truly wonderful&quot; (Melody Maker). &quot;Deliriously great songs&quot; (NME). ‘’A record of pastoral delights’’ (The Times). From then on, France would become a second home for the band. In 1994, &quot;Mute&quot; made both the journalists’ and the readers’ top ten albums of the year poll in the influential Les Inrockuptibles magazine. The rest of the year and the first part of 1995 were spent on the road in the UK and mainland Europe opening for the likes of Oasis, Pulp, and Edwyn Collins, as well as headlining their own shows and playing both La Route du Rock and Les Inrocks festivals in France.

In 1995, Catchers signed to Warner Music Discovery in the US, a label run by the legendary Jac Holzman, founder of Elektra Records. Holzman had previously signed The Doors and Love to his fledgling label in the sixties. The band temporarily relocated to New York City and started a three-month tour that would take them from coast to coast, opening for The Innocence Mission as well as headlining their own dates.

In the autumn of 1995, the band returned to London and Dale Grundle started working on new demos in his home studio. Catchers resurfaced in 1998 with a new single, &quot;Call Her Name&quot;. By this time, the band had become a five-piece with the addition of an extra guitarist, Jonathan Lord, and a new bass player, Craig Carpenter.

Later that year, the band released &quot;Stooping to Fit&quot;, their second album. Recorded at the Cocteau Twins studios in London, &quot;Stooping to Fit&quot; displayed some intense and beautiful strings and brass arrangements by Nick Drake&#x27;s collaborator, Robert Kirby, and revealed a darker edge to Grundle&#x27;s pop sensibility. Comparisons with The Cure were made in recognition of Dale&#x27;s ability to write an album with great, straightforward pop songs as well as more moody and searing numbers.

&quot;Stooping to Fit&quot; was very well received in France and the band was invited to play at La Route du Rock festival in Brittany a second time as well as Les Rockomotives festival in Vendôme. In September 1998, Catchers embarked on a 15-date tour around France for what would ultimately be their last headlining tour.

In spite of glowing reviews (&quot;Wonderfully crafted song smithery&quot; (&quot;Time Out&quot;), &quot;A soft-spoken masterpiece&quot; (&quot;The Times&quot;), &quot;The most emotive pop music around&quot; (&quot;Totally Wired&quot;)), &quot;Stooping to Fit&quot; was poorly promoted by their UK label, Setanta Records, and sales were disappointing.

On 19 February 1999, Catchers played at The Garage in Highbury, London. This was to be their last show for several years.

In 2006, news of Dale Grundle surfaced in an interview for the French online fanzine &quot;Attica&quot; in which he announced that he was working on a new project called The Sleeping Years.

In June 2019, Catchers reissued &quot;Mute&quot; on vinyl through the French record label, Les Disques du 7ème Ciel, and also released a live album and an album of outtakes, &quot;We Speak in Flames&quot; through TSY Records. That year, Dale and Alice reformed the band to play shows in France to promote the 25th-anniversary edition of &quot;Mute&quot;.

<text>The Oldman River is a river in southern Alberta, Canada. It flows roughly west to east from the Rocky Mountains, through the communities of Fort Macleod, Lethbridge, and on to Grassy Lake, where it joins the Bow River to form the South Saskatchewan River, which eventually drains into the Hudson Bay.

Oldman River has a total length of and a drainage area of .

== Etymology ==
The river is named after Napi, a figure in Blackfoot mythology, who is also referred to as the &quot;Old Man.&quot;

==History==
The Oldman River was, at one time, known as the Belly River. The Belly River is now a separate river that is a tributary of the Oldman.

In 1991, the Alberta government finished construction of the Oldman River Dam. The Piikani activist Milton Born With A Tooth had attempted to divert the Oldman River away from the Lethbridge Northern Irrigation District canal intake. This led to an armed standoff and his eventual imprisonment. The dam was constructed where the Oldman, Crowsnest, and Castle river systems converge.
==2013 floods==
On June 21, 2013, during the 2013 Alberta floods Alberta experienced heavy rainfall that triggered catastrophic flooding throughout much of the southern half of the province along the Bow, Elbow, Highwood and Oldman rivers and tributaries. A dozen municipalities in Southern Alberta declared local states of emergency on June 21 as water levels rose and numerous communities were placed under evacuation orders.

==Tributaries==


From headwaters to mouth, Oldman River receives:
*Livingstone River
*Crowsnest River
*Castle River
*Pincher Creek
*Beaver Creek
*Willow Creek
*Belly River
**Waterton River
*St. Mary River
**Lee Creek
*Little Bow River

==Nature==
Oldman River originates in the &quot;Beehive Natural Area&quot;, an area of alpine tundra and old-growth spruce and fir forests. Downstream it flows through Bob Creek Wildland Provincial Park and Black Creek Heritage Rangeland. &quot;Oldman Dam&quot; and &quot;Oldman River&quot; are other Provincial Recreation Areas established along the river.

The river and some of its tributaries have formed coulees in Southern Alberta, and the strata revealed by these formations guide local prospectors to ammolite deposits.

===Fish===
The Oldman River contains fish species such as rainbow trout, cutthroat trout, bull trout, brown trout, hybrid trout species (&quot;cutbow&quot; rainbow and cutthroat cross), mountain whitefish, pike, walleye, lake sturgeon, catostomidae, goldeye, and minnows.

<text>Sukh Jiwan Mal () was the Raja of Kashmir from 1754 to 1762. He rose from the rank of soldier to governor and then finally became a ruler. He was the last independent monarch of Kashmir.

== Early life ==
Sukh Jiwan Mal was born and raised in the city of Bhera, then in the Subah of Lahore, into a Punjabi Hindu Khatri family.

== History ==

=== Background ===
Kashmir under Afghan rulers was in a bad state. Locals were tortured and killed during the reign of Afghans. The very first Afghan chief Abdullah Khan Isk Aquasi appointed by Ahmad Shah Abdali would line up all Kashmiris whom he considered rich and would ask them to either part with their wealth or to face death. The Afghan army would often raid and loot common Kashmiri houses.

=== Rise ===
After the loot and plunder, Abdullah Khan Isk Aquasi returned to Kabul leaving Kashmir under the charge of Abdullah Khan Kabuli. Kabuli appointed Sukh Jiwan as his chief advisor. A local leader of the Kashmiri Muslims, Abu&#x27;l Hasan Bandey wanted to get rid of the cruel Afghan rulers. Bandey convinced Sukh Jiwan to kill Kabuli and become independent. Subsequently, Kabuli was assassinated and Sukh Jiwan became the independent ruler after formally getting the title of &quot;Raja&quot;.

=== Reign ===

As the ruler of Kashmir, Sukh Jiwan appointed Bandey as his prime minister. As a retaliation, Ahmad Shah Abdali sent Khwaja Kijak and Abdullah Khan Isk Aquasi to Kashmir. They were both defeated. In another occasion, Afghan prisoners of war were paraded in the streets with Kashmiri crowds spitting at them. The locals of Kashmir were at large happy with the smooth and efficient administration but the happiness did not last very long. A destructive famine occurred in 1755 followed by locust attack. These natural calamities forced the locals to desperately eat dead locusts. Sukh Jiwan distributed 80 lakh kg rice for free among the poor people.

According to Schwartz, &quot;Kashmir&#x27;s only respite from economic and political pressures during the Afghan and Sikh rule occurred during the reign of Sukh Jiwan Mal, marked by a flowering of literacy activity attached to patronage.&quot; Sukh Jiwan held weekly symposiums to which he invited all the poets. He also employed poets to produce history of Kashmir in the style of Book of Kings. Under the advice of Mahanand Dhar, Sukh Jiwan in order to facilitate his work imported many Khatri Hindus from Punjab to Kashmir.

=== Defeat ===
When force did not work, Abdali used wit to get control of Kashmir. He attempted to destroy the good relations between Sukh Jiwan and Bandey by putting a wedge against them. Taking advantage of this situation, Abdali sent an army led by Nur-ud-Din Khan Bamzai to Kashmir. A major portion of Raja Sukh Jiwan&#x27;s army including his commander-in-chief Bakth Mal betrayed him. Eventually, he was captured, blinded and sent to Abdali in Lahore where he was killed by throwing him under an elephant.

<text>The Traffic Service Position System (TSPS) was developed by Bell Labs in Columbus, Ohio to replace traditional cord switchboards. The first TSPS was deployed in Morristown, New Jersey in 1969 and used the Stored Program Control-1A CPU, &quot;Piggyback&quot; twistor memory (a proprietary technology developed by Bell Labs similar to core memory) and Insulated Gate Field Effect Transistor solid state memory devices similar to dynamic random access memory.

==Features==
The TSPS system utilized special analog trunks that originated at Class 5 end office circuit switch systems and Class 4 toll access circuit switch systems that were connected to Class 3 primary toll circuit switch systems such as the 4A-ETS/PBC and 4ESS switch systems. The TSPS system did not perform switching between the originating end office switch and the toll switch for the subscriber voice path.

The TSPS system included the &quot;Remote Trunking Arrangement&quot; (RTA) feature that consolidated the trunk connection at the originating switch and provided a switched connection to a telephone operator only as required for a short duration at the beginning of a call to obtain billing information or at the end of a call in which the caller requested &quot;time and charges&quot;.

The TSPS system provided a temporary switched connection to a toll operator who helped facilitate calls requiring human assistance such as person-to-person, collect, third-party-billed, and hotel billing. The TSPS system supported up to seven &quot;Chief Operator Groups&quot; (COGs) with each COG supporting up to 31 operator consoles. Operator consoles initially used nixie tube displays that were quickly replaced by light-emitting diode displays due to reliability issues.

The TSPS system was replaced by the Operator Service Position System (OSPS) feature package developed for the 5ESS switching system. During the era of TSPS systems, calls to mobile and marine radiotelephone customers were initially handled by operators at a Special Operator Service Treatment cord switchboard. Operator assisted calls to international destinations were handled by &quot;Code 10&quot; and &quot;Code 11&quot; operators generally co-located at special gateway international switching systems.

==Hotel Billing Information System==
The TSPS system included the &quot;Hotel Billing Information System&quot; (HoBIS) special feature to provide automated billing of long-distance calls from hotel front desks so guests could be charged for calls made almost immediately prior to their departure. Private Teletype data links were provisioned to large hotels that subscribed to this service.

==Automated Coin Toll System==
Debuted in Phoenix, Arizona in 1977, the &quot;Automated Coin Toll System&quot; (ACTS) was an addition to TSPS which provided an automated way to perform charge advisory and toll collection of coin paid calls, reducing the need for operator involvement. The ACTS sub-system handled the automated voice announcements, e.g. &quot;Please deposit five cents for the next three minutes&quot; (initially voiced by Jane Barbe, and later Pat Fleet), and worked with TSPS for coin deposit (start of call) and coin collection/coin return (at end of call).

<text>Böblingen (; Swabian: &quot;Beblenga&quot;) is a town in Baden-Württemberg, Germany, seat of Böblingen District. Sindelfingen and Böblingen are contiguous.

==History==

Böblingen was founded by Count Wilhelm von Tübingen-Böblingen in 1253. Württemberg acquired the town in 1357, and on 12 May 1525 one of the bloodiest battles of the German Peasants&#x27; War took place in Böblingen. Jörg Truchsess von Waldburg attacked a force of 15,000 armed peasants; 3,000 were killed. By the end of the Thirty Years&#x27; War in 1648, the population of Böblingen had been reduced to 600.

After the establishment of the Kingdom of Württemberg, Böblingen became the seat of an &quot;Oberamt&quot; (administrative unit) in 1818. The town was connected to the railroad network in 1879, allowing industrialization to take place. In the context of administrative reform in 1938, Böblingen &quot;Oberamt&quot; became Böblingen &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district).

During World War I, an airbase was established. It went into service on 16 August 1915. It had a significant impact on the further development of the city. In 1925 the airbase became the Landesflughafen (state airport) of Baden-Württemberg called Böblingen Airport. The aircraft pioneer Hanns Klemm (1885–1961) established his company &quot;Klemm Leichtflugzeugbau GmbH&quot; (&quot;Klemm Light Aircraft Company&quot;) next to it. Until the Second World War it was the major employer in Böblingen.

During World War II, the town had a Luftwaffe airbase and military barracks. On 1 September 1939 (the day the war began) the airbase was the home station for the I/JG 52 (1st Group of the Jagdgeschwader 52) flying the Bf 109 E-1 fighter aircraft.

On the night of 7 October 1943 during World War II, Allied air forces dropped 408 incendiary bombs and 35 high explosive bombs, killing 20 men, 12 women, 12 children and wounding 200 people. 1,735 people lost their homes and 70 percent of the old town was destroyed. In July 1944, another attack followed, killing 36 more civilians.

In 1945 the district town of Böblingen fell into the American zone of occupation and belonged to the newly founded state of Württemberg-Baden, which merged in 1952 in the present state of Baden-Württemberg.

After the currency reform of 20 June 1948, a dynamic reconstruction began. The population tripled in just two decades (1950: 12,600; 1970: 37,500). With the settlement of future-oriented companies such as IBM (1949) and Hewlett-Packard (1959) as well as medium-sized companies, which have also settled on the Hulb since the 1970s, strong economic growth began in parallel with the increase in population.

In 1962, Böblingen was designated a &quot;Große Kreisstadt&quot; (major district town). Its current boundaries were established in 1971 when it was merged with the municipality of Dagersheim.

==Population history==
==Climate==
The climate of Böblingen is classified as temperate oceanic(&quot;Cfb&quot;) in Köppen climate classification, which transitions to humid continental climate(&quot;Dfb&quot;).
==Transport==

Böblingen is easily reached by multiple forms of transport.

;Air

Böblingen is about 20 minutes away from Stuttgart Airport via S-Bahn.

;Automobile

The interchange between the federal freeways (&quot;Autobahn&quot;) A 8 and A 81 lies northeast from Böblingen. A 81 leads past the north of the city. The exits are Böblingen &quot;Ost&quot; (East), Böblingen/Sindelfingen, Böblingen Hulb and Ehningen. Federal highways B 464 (Renningen - Reutlingen) and B 14 run by the city.

;Rail

Böblingen station is situated on the Stuttgart–Horb railway (&quot;Gäubahn&quot;) from Stuttgart to Singen. Regional trains serve the city every hour.

;Local bus and rail

Local public transport within Böblingen operates under the uniform prices and coordination of the &quot;Verkehrs- und Tarifverbund Stuttgart&quot; (&quot;Stuttgart Transit and Fare Association&quot; or VVS). The S1 (Kirchheim unter Teck–Stuttgart–Herrenberg) &quot;S-Bahn&quot; (suburban rail) line connects Böblingen with Stuttgart and its &quot;S-Bahn&quot; network. The travel time to Stuttgart is about 25 minutes.

In 1996, the Schönbuchbahn line to Dettenhausen was re-activated. In 2004 the reactivation of the Rankbachbahn line to Renningen began and since 2010 it has been served by line S60 of the S-Bahn.

In addition to the main rail station, the following stations also serve the city: on S-Bahn line S1: Goldberg and Hulb; on the Schönbuchbahn line: Danziger Street, Böblingen &quot;Süd&quot; (South), Heusteig Street and Zimmerschlag. Numerous bus routes operate in the city, and are also under the VVS.

==U.S. military==
Panzer Kaserne (translated as Tank Barracks) is a US base where headquarters are located for Marine Corps Forces, Europe (MARFOREUR), &#x27;Marine Corps Forces, Africa (MARFORAF) and the 1st Battalion of the US Army&#x27;s 10th Special Forces Group. This former German military installation was the home of the US Army&#x27;s 7th Army Support Command (7th Army SUPCOM) until mid-1969 and its VII Corps successor VII Corps COSCOM (Corps Support Command). Later, units of the 3rd Brigade of the 1st Infantry Division (Forward) were stationed here as part of VII Corps.

In 1979, several US Army units created a tented barracks area outside the city as part of REFORGER exercises.

==Education==
Education in Germany has two lower levels of school, &quot;Kindergarten&quot; and elementary school (&quot;Grundschule&quot; - grades 1–4), and three upper levels of school, &quot;Werkrealschule&quot; (grades 5–9/10), &quot;Realschule&quot; (5–10) and &quot;Gymnasium&quot; (5–12/13). Parents decide, at the end of the fourth grade, which level of school the child should attend based on academic performance and aptitude.

==Events==
* Several fairs around the marketplace/Schlossplatz and the lakes (e.g. Town fair &quot;Böblinger Jahrmarkt&quot; in July, wine festival in September and Christmas Market in December).
* Since 1996: every year &quot;Böblinger Sommer am See&quot; (lit. Summer at the lake) from June to September. There are over 60 events (&quot;e.g.&quot; concerts, flea market) taking place around the two lakes in Böblingen.
* At regular intervals concerts and other events took place at the former Sporthalle (Civic Center, closed in 2007 and demolished since then) and at the Kongresshalle (Congregational hall; a place where numerous town events happen), like the Wetten, dass..? show, and concerts by international pop and rock stars.

==Business==

The Böblingen–Sindelfingen area is the location of several large enterprises:

* Advantest (Semiconductor Test)
* Agilent Technologies (Electronic Equipment, Instruments and Components)
* Avago Technologies (Semiconductors)
* Mercedes-Benz Group (Automobiles)
* HP Inc. (Computers, Software and Services)
* IBM (Computers, Software and Services)
* Keysight Technologies (Electronic Test and Measurement)
* Kroll Ontrack
* Philips (Medical Monitors)
* Smart (Automobiles)
* Softpro (Electronic Signature Verification)
* Wörwag Pharma (Drugs and Food Supplements)

Böblingen/Sindelfingen can be called a center of both automobile and computer industries. Daimler develops and manufactures its Mercedes brand of luxury cars here.

Hewlett-Packard (and its offspring) and IBM develop computer systems, software and electronic products in the area. Böblingen was once also a major center of European computer manufacturing, with an IBM semiconductor and printed circuit board lab and an HP computer systems manufacturing operation. Most of those electronics-production sites have either been closed or moved to other locations (such as nearby Herrenberg).

<doc id="1308452" wikidata="Q2385593" url="?curid=1308452" title="TV-B-Gone">
<text>TV-B-Gone is a universal remote control device for turning off various brands of television sets. Released in 2004, its inventor referred to it as &quot;an environmental management device&quot;. Although it can require up to 72 seconds for the device to find the proper code for a particular television receiver, the most popular televisions turn off in the first few seconds.

== History ==
TV-B-Gone was invented by Mitch Altman and is sold by his company Cornfield Electronics. The standard model TV-B-Gone consists of an infra-red LED, two CR2032 cells and an integrated circuit containing the television power code database, all in a plastic case. The original case aesthetics and design were created by Robert Ellis.

== Models ==
=== TV-B-Gone Pro SHP ===
The TV-B-Gone Pro SHP (Super High Power) is the latest TV-B-Gone to be announced. It is considerably more powerful than the standard model, using eight infra-red LEDs to allow TVs to be turned off from distances of up to 100 meters (300 feet). TV-B-Gone Pro SHP is switchable between its North American and European databases of POWER codes. Later, in 2009, Mitch Altman made a new kind of TV-B-Gone Pro SHP. Instead of disguising it as an iPhone, Mitch Altman has made the new and improved TV-B-Gone look like an iPod Nano and go ten more yards than the old one.

The recent invention of &gt;1W 850 and 970 nm IREDs makes a miniature long range version of the TV-B-Gone feasible.

=== TV-B-Gone Kit ===
At several hacker conventions Mitch Altman has run workshops that allow participants to build their own TV-B-Gones using Adafruit Industries&#x27; micro controller–based mini-POV kit. Around January 2008, Adafruit Industries released a kit to build an open source TV-B-Gone.

== Consumer Electronics Show controversy ==
During the 2008 Consumer Electronics Show, an individual associated with Gizmodo brought a TV-B-Gone remote control and shut off many display monitors at booths and during demos affecting several companies. These actions caused the individual to be banned for life from future CES events.

<doc id="1308457" wikidata="Q4915620" url="?curid=1308457" title="Birbal Dhar">
<text>Birbal Dhar was a leader in the Kashmiri resistance to Afghan rule in the early 19th century. He led a deputation which persuaded Sikh ruler Maharaja Ranjit Singh to invade Kashmir in 1819, which effectively ended Afghan and Muslim rule in Kashmir.

Due to his role in the ending of the Afghan rule, Birbal Dhar was awarded with the role of Taluqdar, rough translation - Nawab, for the province of Kashmir under the rule of Maharaja Ranjit Singh.

He was offered a seat on the council of the Maharaja, but refused in order to be able to be close to his people in Kashmir.

Ever since the time of Mughals and Afghans, the Taluqdar was the highest administrative service for a state.

He was an avid follower of a previous Taluqdar of Kashmir, Ali Mardan Khan, and so was a tradition for him and his descendants to keep up the Chashme Shahi Garden where apparently the Kurdish General had found God.

<text>Pan Am Systems was a privately held Portsmouth, New Hampshire-based Florida corporation composed of rail transport, manufacturing and energy, transportation related brands, and real estate divisions. It formerly held a now-defunct airline division.

Pan Am Systems was put up for sale in July 2020. On November 30, 2020, CSX Corporation announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to purchase Pan Am Systems. The sale of Pan Am Systems to CSX underwent regulatory review by the Surface Transportation Board, which approved the sale on April 14, 2022. At midnight on June 1, 2022, CSX began operating Pan Am Systems and its Pan Am Railways; also, Pan Am Systems was merged into a temporary subsidiary of CSX which will eventually merge into CSX.

==History==
===1981–2020===
Guilford Transportation Industries (GTI) was formed in 1981. GTI entered the railroad business in 1981 with its purchase of the Maine Central Railroad Company from U.S. Filter Corporation. This was followed by its 1983 purchase of the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, and in 1984 it purchased the Delaware and Hudson Railway (D&amp;H). In 1988, GTI declared D&amp;H bankrupt. Francis DiCello, an appointed bankruptcy trustee, oversaw the estate while the New York, Susquehanna &amp; Western Railway managed it employing the D&amp;H workforce. Susquehanna&#x27;s management expired in early 1990 and the trustee managed it directly until selling in 1991 to the Canadian Pacific Railway.

GTI purchased the name, colors, and logo of Pan American World Airways in 1998 and Pan Am Systems was established that same year. In March 2006, GTI changed its name to Pan Am Railways.

The company was privately owned by Timothy Mellon, an heir to the Mellon banking fortune, and several other stakeholders including former Penn Central employee David Fink and son David A. Fink.

===CSX acquisition===
In July 2020, Pan Am Systems was put up for sale. On November 30, 2020, an agreement was announced for CSX Corporation (parent company for CSX Transportation) to acquire Pan Am Systems. Norfolk Southern expressed concern about possible impacts on competition. The sale was proposed as follows: CSX will own and operate between Mattawamkeag, ME and Ayer, MA. Between Ayer and Rotterdam, NY, Genesee and Wyoming Rail will be the operating party. This means the track will be owned by CSX, but CSX will not dispatch it. Also, Norfolk Southern will keep its 49% stake in Pan Am Southern (PAS). With the sale, the intermodal traffic between Mechanicville and Ayer will be re-routed over the B&amp;A to Worcester, MA. From there the traffic will come up the Worcester main and into Ayer Yard.

On March 25, 2021, after numerous letters questioning CSX&#x27;s acquisition of Pan Am Railways parent Pan Am Systems from the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Vermont Rail System, as well as many other local political figures and community leaders from other New England states, the Surface Transportation Board ruled the acquisition as &quot;Significant&quot; meaning that a more rigorous review process would be necessary.

On April 30, 2021, CSX submitted a 478-page plan of purchase outlining a broad range of topics, from implementations of track upgrades to the controversial issue of Norfolk Southern intermodal routing, as well as the fate of Pan Am&#x27;s hodgepodge fleet of aging motive power, which is made up of EMD and GE locomotives from railroads such as Conrail, NS, CSX, the Milwaukee Road, and Kansas City Southern.

On May 26, 2021, the federal regulators of the Surface Transportation Board rejected CSX&#x27;s purchase application, deeming it &quot;incomplete.&quot; The board cited &quot;contradictions&quot; and &quot;lack of necessary information&quot; to properly judge the acquisition, and therefore could not rule on the matter. While CSX has the option of re-submitting a revised application, which it has motioned toward in its official statement, the transaction stands on uncertain ground.

On July 30, 2021, the Surface Transportation Board accepted a revised merger application for consideration, allowing CSX to move forward with the acquisition on Pan Am Systems. The decision determined that an environmental and historic review are unnecessary and establishes criteria for additional filings, public comments, and a deadline for a final Surface Transportation Board decision.

The STB approved the sale of Pan Am Systems to CSX on April 14, 2022, for $600 million. At midnight on June 1, 2022, CSX began operating Pan Am Railways and Pan Am Systems was merged into a temporary subsidiary of CSX called 747 Merger Sub 2 which will become the new Pan Am Systems, the new Pan Am Systems and Pan Am Railways will eventually merge into CSX.

==Divisions==
===Air===
*Pan American Airways (1998–2004), a United States airline that operated scheduled services in the eastern USA under the purchased &quot;Pan American Airways&quot; brand, as well as charters for tour operators and services to the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico.

*Boston-Maine Airways (Pan Am Clipper Connection), the formerly certified airline, which operated charter and scheduled passenger airline services between the northeastern United States and Florida and the Caribbean under the &quot;Pan Am Clipper Connection&quot; brand. In February 2008 the U.S. Department of Transportation proposed the revocation of Boston-Maine&#x27;s air carrier certification, as it &quot;is not financially fit and does not possess the managerial competence to conduct any air transportation operations and has failed to comply with the regulations governing its operations.&quot; Services ended on February 29, 2008.

<text>Leela is a fictional character played by Louise Jameson in the long-running British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. She was a companion of the Fourth Doctor and a regular in the programme from 1977 to 1978. Leela appeared in nine stories (40 episodes).

==Appearances==

===Television===
Leela was the daughter of Sole. She first appears in the 1977 serial &quot;The Face of Evil&quot;. She is a warrior of the savage Sevateem tribe, who were amongst the descendants of the crew of an Earth starship from the Mordee Expedition that crash-landed on an unnamed planet in the far future. The tribe&#x27;s name is a corruption of &quot;survey team&quot;. The Doctor at this point was content to travel alone, but Leela barged into the TARDIS and continued to accompany him on his journeys.

Though a noble savage, Leela was highly intelligent, grasping advanced concepts easily and translating them into terms she could cope with. Despite the Doctor&#x27;s attempts at &quot;civilizing&quot; her, Leela was strong-willed enough to continue in her ways. She usually dressed in animal skins, and was armed with a knife or a set of poisonous Janis thorns, which she did not hesitate to use on people who threatened her, much to the Doctor&#x27;s disapproval. She often demonstrated a highly accurate sense of danger.

In her travels with the Doctor, Leela faced killer robots (&quot;The Robots of Death&quot;), murderous homunculi (&quot;The Talons of Weng-Chiang&quot;), the Rutan Host (&quot;Horror of Fang Rock&quot;), and the Sontaran invasion of the Doctor&#x27;s home planet of Gallifrey. During this final adventure, &quot;The Invasion of Time&quot;, she meets and falls in love with Andred, a native Gallifreyan, and decides to stay behind to be with him. The first K-9 remains with her. This exit for her character was created after Louise Jameson announced her intention to leave the show.

Following her departure, she was mentioned in the series on two subsequent occasions. In &quot;Full Circle&quot;, when the Doctor believes he has returned to Gallifrey, he admits, &quot;I&#x27;m so looking forward to seeing how Leela and Andred are getting on&quot;. When he finally does arrive on Gallifrey in &quot;Arc of Infinity&quot;, he asks after her: &quot;Tell me, what of my former companion Leela?&quot; The Doctor is told she is &quot;well and very happy&quot;, to which he responds &quot;I was so sorry to miss her wedding&quot;.

===Other media===
Jameson reprised the role of Leela onscreen in the 1993 charity special &quot;Dimensions in Time&quot;.

Leela&#x27;s life on Gallifrey has been explored in various spin-off media. In the Virgin New Adventures novel &quot;Lungbarrow&quot;, by Marc Platt, Leela and Andred are expecting a child, the first naturally conceived baby on Gallifrey for millennia. When the Doctor learns this, he asks her to name it after him; Platt explained that this was meant to suggest a time loop in which the hybrid child goes on to become the Other and subsequently the Doctor, explaining his half-human parentage in the 1996 TV film.

Jameson has voiced the character in six series of Big Finish Productions audio plays set on Gallifrey, alongside Lalla Ward as Romana and John Leeson as K-9. In the &quot;Gallifrey&quot; audio series, Leela acts as Romana&#x27;s bodyguard, advisor, and friend. Being in the presence of Time Lord biology extends Leela&#x27;s lifespan and keeps her relatively youthful; if she ever left them, however, then she would quickly age to death. In &quot;Gallifrey&quot;, Leela and Andred separate after Andred fakes his death to infiltrate the Celestial Intervention Agency (he regenerates and impersonates a man who attempted to kill him, not considering how his actions would affect Leela). Andred is subsequently killed and Leela is blinded during a Gallifreyan civil war, which also results in her version of K9 (the original) being destroyed. She is then taken out of time, to avoid her perishing with the rest of Gallifrey. She follows Romana through several alternative universes, regaining vision in one eye by ingesting vampire blood, her unique physiology allowing her to be physically enhanced by it without experiencing the negative, mental side-effects. She eventually returns to her original universe with Romana in time to save their Gallifrey.

In 2011, Leela joined the cast of the second series of &quot;Jago &amp; Litefoot&quot;, where she is sent by Romana to investigate breaks in time in Victorian London. In the same year, Jameson reprised the role of Leela alongside Tom Baker as the Fourth Doctor for a series of audio dramas for Big Finish. These dramas began to be released in January 2012, and are adaptations of stories planned for TV but never produced, as well as original storylines set in the gap between &quot;The Talons of Weng-Chiang&quot; and &quot;Horror of Fang Rock&quot;. Leela has also appeared in several Past Doctor Adventures, including four novels by Chris Boucher pairing her with the Fourth Doctor, with whom she also appears in Philip Reeve&#x27;s 2013 short story &quot;The Roots of Evil&quot; (which sees the Fourth Doctor and Leela deal with the aftermath of a situation created by the Eleventh Doctor).

Seemingly surviving the Time War, Leela features in a trilogy of &quot;Companion Chronicles&quot; audio stories in which she ages a year per day without the Time Lords. In &quot;The Catalyst&quot;, an elderly Leela is interrogated by a Z&#x27;Nai warrior to learn what secrets she may know of a legendary &quot;lost world&quot; (presumably Gallifrey), and tells stories of her past to a child imprisoned in the room. In her final audio, &quot;The Time Vampire&quot;, she recalls how K9 flew into the Time Vortex and she had a vision of an &quot;ancient&quot; woman. Once her tale is told and she feels ready to die, K9 suddenly appears before her; he frees her, and guides her soul to its next stage.

In 2017, Jameson appeared as Leela alongside John Hurt as the War Doctor, the retroactive &#x27;ninth&#x27; Doctor who fought in the Time War, in the &quot;War Doctor&quot; audio series. In this audio, Leela is stated to have been lost in an early battle in the Time War, but was actually struck by a Disruptor Dalek, intended to erase her from all alternate timelines, only for unspecified factors – hinted to be Leela&#x27;s strength of will – to draw Leela back to this universe, but now forced to endure the memories of every possible alternate path her life might have taken and no way to determine which one is true. After helping Leela seal a dimensional rift, the War Doctor is able to use the TARDIS to bring Leela&#x27;s memories back into order.

Later in 2017, Jameson as Leela appeared in the Fifth Doctor audio &quot;Time in Office&quot;; when the Fifth Doctor is recalled to Gallifrey to take on the role as President to stabilise Gallifrey&#x27;s tenuous political situation after Borusa&#x27;s deceptions (&quot;The Five Doctors&quot;), Leela assists his current companion Tegan Jovanka in finding a loophole that allows her to stay on Gallifrey with him, essentially acting as the Doctor&#x27;s bodyguard and advisor until he returns to his travels.

In 2024, Jameson reprised the role of Leela in the closing moments of the Time War in &quot;Leela vs the Time War&quot;, an official Doctor Who short film on YouTube announcing Season 15 of Classic Doctor Who as being released on Blu-ray.

==Characterisation==

===Conception===
The character of Leela was first conceived by producer Philip Hinchcliffe and script editor Robert Holmes. They wanted a companion in the mould of George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s Eliza Doolittle (from &quot;Pygmalion&quot;): a bright but unsophisticated primitive who would learn from the Doctor. Writer Chris Boucher had submitted a story proposal titled &quot;The Mentor Conspiracy&quot; which featured a character named Leela, fitting Hinchcliffe&#x27;s and Holmes&#x27;s ideas. Boucher named the character after the Palestinian hijacker Leila Khaled. 

Although &quot;The Mentor Conspiracy&quot; was not produced, Boucher reused the character of Leela for &quot;The Day God Went Mad&quot; – later retitled &quot;The Face of Evil&quot; – seeing her as a mixture of Emma Peel (from &quot;The Avengers&quot;) and Leila Khaled. Boucher was asked to write two endings to &quot;Face&quot;, one in which Leela left with the Doctor, and one in which she stayed behind. The decision to have Leela become a companion was made soon after. An oft-repeated story (also stated in the DVD commentary to &quot;The Robots of Death&quot;) is that Leela&#x27;s skimpy leather outfits were very popular with the &quot;dads&quot;, which kept them watching the programme.

===Casting===
According to the official DVD release of the story &quot;The Face of Evil&quot; in 2012, Louise Jameson won the role of Leela over 26 other hopeful actresses auditioned between 10 and 25 August 1976. Emily Richard was producer Philip Hinchcliffe&#x27;s first choice, but when she proved unavailable, Celia Foxe, Colette Gleeson, Elaine Donnelly, Gail Grainger, Belinda Sinclair, Ann Pennington, Sally Geeson, Pamela Salem, Carol Leader, Heather Tobias, Marilyn Galsworthy, Katherine Fahey, Deborah Fairfax, Irene Gorst, Kay Korda, Lois Hantz, Belinda Low, Gail Harrison, Michelle Newell, Philippa Vazey, Sue Jones-Davies, Lydia Lisle, Janet Edis, Susan Wooldridge and Carol Drinkwater were all seen for the part. The last five actresses were shortlisted with Louise Jameson and all recalled. Auditions took place in batches of eight actresses, with Jameson amongst the first batch. As Tom Baker was not available for her audition, director Pennant Roberts played the part of the Doctor. Jameson was given the role on 26 August 1976. Despite not being on the final shortlist, Pamela Salem won a small voice role in Leela&#x27;s debut story, &quot;The Face of Evil&quot;, followed by a substantial part in the next story &quot;The Robots of Death&quot;.

Although Jameson&#x27;s eyes are naturally blue, as Leela she initially wore red contact lenses to make them brown. However, the contact lenses severely limited her vision, and producer Graham Williams promised her she could stop wearing them. To explain the change in-story, writer Terrance Dicks wrote a scene in the 1977 serial &quot;Horror of Fang Rock&quot; in which Leela&#x27;s eyes suffer &quot;pigment dispersal&quot; and turn blue after viewing the explosion of the Rutan ship.

Tom Baker disliked Leela&#x27;s character concept because he felt that she was too violent. Jameson reports that he was cold to her for the first several stories they did together. Eventually, during the filming of &quot;Horror of Fang Rock&quot;, she insisted on multiple takes of a scene in which he repeatedly entered the scene early, thereby upstaging her. This incident appears to have increased Baker&#x27;s respect for her, and their working relationship substantially improved thereafter. Aside from feeling that Baker was &quot;competitive&quot;, Jameson suffered from glandular fever in the middle of her time on the show and also was allergic to dry ice.

Graham Williams offered to rewrite the end of &quot;The Invasion of Time&quot; so Leela could stay, but Jameson declined as she was already committed to a play of &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;. Jameson was also invited to return for a whole season when Peter Davison became the Doctor and ease the transition, but she only wished to participate in one story.

<text>Prokhor of [[Gorodets, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast|Gorodets]] (&quot;Прохор&quot;, &quot;Прохор с Городца&quot; in Russian) was a medieval Russian icon-painter, thought to have been the teacher of Andrei Rublev.

Together with Rublev and Theophanes the Greek, Prokhor painted a number of frescos in the old Cathedral of the Annunciation in the Moscow Kremlin in 1405 (the cathedral was rebuilt in 1416). Russian historians attribute a number of icons in the iconostasis of this cathedral to Prokhor, including &quot;Crucifixion&quot;, &quot;Ascension&quot; and &quot;Assumption&quot;, which can still be found in today&#x27;s Cathedral of the Annunciation.

<doc id="1308493" wikidata="Q4705254" url="?curid=1308493" title="Alabama Gang">
<text>The Alabama Gang was the nickname for a group of NASCAR drivers (and subsequently their offspring) who set up shop and operated out of Hueytown, Alabama (near Birmingham, Alabama). In the late 1950s, young auto racer Bobby Allison left Miami, Florida, looking for an area that had more opportunities to race. He discovered central Alabama in his travels. The region was dotted with small dirt tracks, and Allison won big his first few times out. He returned to Florida to pick up his brother Donnie Allison, and friend Red Farmer.

The trio set up shop in Hueytown, Alabama, and were dominant throughout the 1960s and early 1970s. In 1973, Jimmy Means joined the gang. Beginning in 1979, their sons and contemporaries began racing, and became known as members of the Alabama Gang themselves. Bobby&#x27;s son Davey Allison, and fellow Hueytown residents Neil Bonnett, and David Bonnett. Donnie&#x27;s daughter Pam married Hut Stricklin, who joined this generation.

Other drivers (notably Dale Earnhardt) were great friends with members of this group, and while not Alabama residents, these other drivers became associated with the Alabama Gang.

All of the original members of the Alabama Gang have been inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame. Davey Allison&#x27;s little brother, Clifford Allison, followed the Alabama Gang tradition, but while practicing for a Busch Series race at Michigan International Speedway in 1992, he spun out in turn 4 and was killed. Davey Allison died in a helicopter crash at Talladega Superspeedway in 1993 while flying to observe a practice session for David Bonnett (Neil&#x27;s son). Then Neil Bonnett died while practicing for the 1994 Daytona 500. Bobby Allison retired in 1988 after suffering injuries in a race at the Miller High Life 500 in June 1988 at Pocono Raceway that nearly cost him his life, but returned in 1993 to race in a Jaguar as part of ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Fast Masters&quot; held at Lucas Oil Raceway. Farmer, born October 15, 1932, is the oldest member of the &quot;Gang&quot;. His first race was in 1948. He was injured in the helicopter crash that took Davey Allison&#x27;s life, but recovered and still at 92, races regularly at the Talladega Short Track across the street from Talladega Superspeedway. (2024)

In February 1988, two Gang members Neil Bonnett and Bobby Allison, traveled to Melbourne, Australia for the first ever NASCAR race held outside of North America held at the Calder Park Thunderdome. Bonnett and Allison qualified on the front row and dominated the 280 lap race known as the Goodyear NASCAR 500. Bonnett won the race by just 0.86 seconds from Allison.

The third generation of the Alabama Gang has continued the legacy. Donnie&#x27;s grandsons Taylor Stricklin (son of Pam) and ARCA driver Justin Allison (son of Kenny) have scored wins with Justin Allison winning the ARCA ModSpace 125 at Pocono Raceway and Taylor winning a Limited Late Model title at Hickory Motor Speedway. Neil&#x27;s grandson Justin Bonnett (son of David) has also raced Late Models and Modifieds in the Alabama and Florida panhandle region.

Hueytown memorialized the racers by renaming its main street &quot;Allison-Bonnett Memorial Drive.&quot; There are other tributes to the &quot;Gang&quot; around the city. Other streets bear names of the members, including &quot;Davey Allison Boulevard&quot; and &quot;Red Farmer Drive,&quot; and certain local businesses also have paid tribute to the famous drivers. A Honda automobile dealership located in Hueytown was named &quot;Neil Bonnett Honda&quot; for many years, but it was renamed &quot;Serra Honda&quot; in 2006. Additionally, the Seal of the City of Hueytown features two checkered flags, acknowledging the large part racing has played in the city&#x27;s history. On April 30, 2014, Talladega Superspeedway renamed the back straightaway &quot;The Alabama Gang Superstretch&quot;.

<text>Bhaskara was a notable writer from the Kashmir Shaivism sect of Hinduism. He wrote an important commentary, the Varttika, on the Shiva Sutras of Vasugupta. According to Dyczkowski, &quot;We know nothing about him except that he was the son of one Divakarabhatta and was, therefore, like the other Kashmiri Saiva authors, a Brahmin by caste, as Bhatta was a title bestowed to learned Brahmins in Kashmir at that time&quot; (p. 2).

<text>Alvin Olin King (June 21, 1890 – February 21, 1958) was an American politician allied with the Democratic faction of Governor Huey Pierce Long Jr. A state senator, he was President Pro Tempore in 1931, after Long had been elected in 1930 as a US Senator.

After Long had conflict with his lieutenant governor, who was ruled to have resigned, King advanced to serve as lieutenant governor for a year. Beginning in late January 1932, he served for three and a half months as governor of Louisiana, after Long had resigned and moved to Washington, D.C.

==Early life and education==
King was born in Leoti in Wichita County in western Kansas – not to be confused with the city of Wichita in southern Kansas. He attended Tulane University Law School in New Orleans and began the practice of law in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana.

==Political career==
King had joined the Democratic Party and was elected to the Louisiana State Senate from Calcasieu Parish in the southwestern part of the state. He rose to President Pro Tempore of that body.

In 1930 Huey Long, then serving as governor, was elected from Louisiana to the United States Senate. In 1931 Dr. Paul Narcisse Cyr of Jeanerette, a physician and lieutenant governor, filed an ouster suit against Long, under &quot;a law prohibiting dual office holding.&quot; He also attempted to take the oath of office as governor at the time when Long would normally have been expected to have vacated the position. The two men had been bitter foes since early years in office.

But Long had not resigned from the governorship, as he had some work he wanted to complete before leaving for Washington, D.C., and being sworn in as senator. The State Supreme Court rejected Cyr&#x27;s suit. Long won a favorable court ruling that Cyr had given up the position of lieutenant governor by his actions.

King, as President Pro Tempore, assumed the office according to the succession plan, to fill out the term. King succeeded Cyr as Lieutenant Governor in 1931. Cyr filed an ouster suit against King, but it was rejected by the State Supreme Court. Cyr ended his political career at that point and returned to his life in Iberia Parish.

After Long finally resigned in January 1932, King assumed the governorship, serving for the three and a half months remaining in 1932 in Long&#x27;s elected term, from January 25, 1932, to May 10, 1932.

During his brief tenure, King called for a reduction in highway spending, since the Great Depression made it difficult to finance bonds at an acceptable rate. The Huey P. Long Bridge in Jefferson Parish was under construction in this period, and completed under the next elected governor, Oscar K. Allen. Signs above the roadway entrance to the bridge say only that it was built during the administrations of Huey Long and Oscar K. Allen.

==Later years==
After his several months as governor, King did not run for office again. He returned to practicing law and served for a time as president of the Louisiana Bar Association. He was a Methodist. He died in his home city of Lake Charles.

<text>Somananda (875–925 CE) was one of the teachers of Kashmir Shaivism, in the lineage of &quot;Trayambaka&quot;, author of the first philosophical treatise of this school, &quot;Śivadṛṣṭi&quot;. A contemporary of &quot;Bhaṭṭa Kallaṭa&quot;, the two formed the first wave of Kashmiri Shaivites to propose in a rigorous and logical way the concepts of nondual Shaivism. Somananda lived in Kashmir, most probably in Srinagar, where most of the later philosophers of the school lived, as a householder.

==Lineage==

There is considerable myth surrounding the origins of &quot;Somananda&quot;. He claimed he was a descendant of the sage Durvasa. &quot;Durvasa&quot; received from Shiva the spiritual mission of keeping the tradition and secrets of Agamic Shaivism alive. It is said that &quot;Durvasa&quot; created his son, &quot;Tryambaka&quot;, directly from the mind (in a similar way with the creation of Athena directly from the mind of her father, Zeus, in the Greek mythology). In turn, &quot;Tryambaka&quot; also created a son directly from his mind. This went on for 15 generation terminating with the father of &quot;Sangamaditya&quot;, who took a woman as a wife. Then, there were three more generations until &quot;Somananda&quot;. So, &quot;Somananda&quot; claims a divine spiritual ancestry and investiture.

&quot;Somananda&quot; was also the disciple of Vasugupta, another important Shaivite master. &quot;Vasugupta&quot; was the author of Shiva Sutra, one of the fundamental texts of nondual Shaivism. &quot;Bhatta Kallata&quot;, the author of &quot;Spanda Karika&quot;, was contemporary with &quot;Somananda&quot; and had also been a disciple of &quot;Vasugupta&quot;. Thus, from &quot;Vasugupta&quot; emerged two disciples, &quot;Somananda&quot; and &quot;Bhatta Kallata&quot;, each proposing a school of monistic &quot;Shaivism&quot;, Pratyabhijna and respectively &quot;Spanda&quot;.

The difference between the texts we have left from these rival disciples is mainly in their scope, not in essence. While &quot;Somananda&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Sivadristi&quot; has a philosophical bent, &quot;Bhatta Kallata&#x27;s Spanda Karika&quot; is more practical and shorter in length.

&quot;Somananda&quot; main disciple was &quot;Utpaladeva&quot;. &quot;Utpaladeva&quot; wrote a number of texts to continue and develop his teacher&#x27;s work including the Īśvarapratyabhijñākārikā, of which Abhinavagupta&#x27;s Īśvarapratyābhijñāvimarśinī is a commentary. &quot;Utpaladeva&quot; also commented on his teacher&#x27;s work, &quot;Sivadṛṣṭi&quot;. Following &quot;Utpaladeva&quot; came &quot;Lakshmanagupta&quot;, and then Abhinavagupta, who was the epitome of the &quot;Kashmiri Shaivism&quot;. &quot;Abhinavagupta&quot; took teachings from all the schools of &quot;Shaivism&quot; and was said to reach spiritual liberation himself, after which he took on the huge undertaking of uniting all these schools into one coherent system. Abhinavagupta&#x27;s main work is Tantraloka.

==Philosophy==

Based on his writings it is supposed &quot;Somananda&quot; attained the highest spiritual realization. From such a position of deep understanding and insight he compiled his texts based on logic. He had minute attention for detail and a great capacity to express in clear terms even the most difficult points. When debating opposing views, he makes an effort to understand exactly what they are and present them in his work, then refute them by subtle logic.

&quot;Somananda&quot; was a householder and his system is to be applied by people in the midst of everyday life. He rejected practices which required reclusion and leaving behind of society.

&quot;Somananda&quot; is mainly remembered as the first perceptor of the &quot;Pratyabhijna&quot; school. He defined the theoretical aspects of &quot;Pratyabhijna&quot; in his main work &quot;Sivadristi&quot;. His son, Utpaladeva refined and developed it, leaving the task of bringing it to completion and integrating it with the other schools of &quot;Kashmir Shaivism&quot; to the great master &quot;Abhinavagupta&quot;.

His philosophy is both idealistic-monism and theistic.
In essence, he states that &quot;Everything is Shiva&quot;. Besides being &quot;all-things&quot;, &quot;Shiva&quot; is also cit-ananda - consciousness and bliss. He is in possession of an absolutely free will, Svatantrya, with which he creates the manifestation without the use of any external instruments or materials. He manifests through his powers of knowledge and action.

The notion of &quot;Svatantrya&quot; is central to &quot;Somananda&#x27;s&quot; philosophy. The free-will of &quot;Shiva&quot; is manifested as energy, called Shakti, which emanates from &quot;Shiva&quot; himself and is the stuff from which the world is created, thus, being ontologically anterior to the world, it is beyond any obstacles. When &quot;Shakti&quot; begins the process of manifestation it subdivides into a number of ontological categories or substances called tattvas, 36 in number. Thus, the world is considered real (not illusory, as in other monistic idealistic spiritual schools).

The written work of &quot;Somananda&quot; contains more than philosophical system building. It also contains an account of the rival schools of philosophy and a series of refutations based on logic. For example, &quot;Somananda&quot; disagrees with the gross realism of the Nyaya-Vaisesika system, the subtle realism of Samkhya, and the idealism of Vedanta, or that of Vijnanavada of Buddhism. In his view, the universe is an appearance, but not of Maya (illusion) but of the free will of &quot;Shiva&quot;. In reality the universe is &quot;Shiva himself&quot;. Instead of postulating a principle of beginning-less ignorance avidya like &quot;Advaita Vedanta&quot;, he points out that it is though the free-will of &quot;Shiva&quot;, &quot;Svatantriya&quot;, that ignorance appears. Ignorance is not an ontological reality but an epistemological phenomenon.

==Works==

&quot;Somananda&quot; was the author of the first philosophical treatise on monistic &quot;Saivism&quot;, &quot;Sivadristi&quot;, a work in seven chapters. It starts by describing the eternal nature of &quot;Shiva&quot; and the creation of the universe. The author exposes his theory of non-differentiation, unity of subject and object, everything being of the nature of consciousness, &quot;cid-rupa&quot;. A large portion of the book is dedicated to the exposition, analysis and critique of the Vivarta theory of the grammarians, the Shakta approach to the ultimate reality, the &quot;Vijnanavadin&quot; nuanced differences with respect to the principle of monism, the &quot;Advaita Vedanta&quot; concept of ignorance and the fundamental principles of all the other major spiritual schools of the time. In the end &quot;Somananda&quot; describes the history of &quot;Kashmiri Shaivism&quot; and of his own family. Other texts by &quot;Somananda&quot; include a commentary on his own &quot;Sivadristi&quot; and on &quot;Paratrimsika Vivarana&quot;.

<text>The Kashmir Shaivism tradition, also called Trika Shaivism, is a non-dualist branch of Shaiva-Shakta Tantra Hinduism that originated in Kashmir after 850 CE. In its place of origin in Kashmir, this tradition is commonly referred to as &quot;Kashmiri Shaivism.&quot; It later spread beyond Kashmir, with its great scholar Abhinavagupta calling it &quot;Trika&quot; (meaning &quot;the Trinity&quot;). It particularly flourished in the states of Odisha and Maharashtra. Defining features of the Trika tradition are its idealistic and monistic &quot;Pratyabhijna&quot; (&quot;Recognition&quot;) philosophical system, propounded by Utpaladeva (c. 925–975 CE) and Abhinavagupta (c. 975–1025 CE), and the centrality of the three goddesses Parā, Parāparā, and Aparā.

While Trika draws from numerous Shaiva texts, such as the Shaiva Agamas and the Shaiva and Shakta Tantras, its major scriptural authorities are the &quot;Mālinīvijayottara Tantra&quot;, the &quot;Siddhayogeśvarīmata&quot; and the &quot;Anāmaka-tantra.&quot; Its main exegetical works are those of Abhinavagupta, such as the &quot;Tantraloka&quot;, &quot;Mālinīślokavārttika&quot;, and &quot;Tantrasāra&quot; which are formally an exegesis of the &quot;Mālinīvijayottara Tantra&quot;, although they also drew heavily on the Kali-based Krama subcategory of the Kulamārga. Another important text of this tradition is the &quot;Vijñāna-bhairava-tantra,&quot; which focuses on outlining numerous yogic practices.

Kashmir Shaivism shares many parallel points of agreement with the lesser known monistic school of Shaiva Siddhanta as expressed in the Tirumantiram of Tirumular. While also sharing this branch&#x27;s disagreements with the dualistic Shaiva Siddhanta school of Meykandar, which scholars consider to be normative tantric Shaivism. The doctrines of Kashmir Shaivism were very influential on the Shri Vidya tradition of Shaktism.

==History==
===Non-dual Shaiva influences===
Dating from around 850–900 CE, the &quot;Shiva Sutras of Vasugupta&quot; and &quot;Spandakārikā&quot; were a Śākta Śaiva attempt to present a non-dualistic metaphysics and gnostic soteriology in opposition to the dualistic exegesis of the Meykandar school of Shaiva Siddhanta, while remaining in agreement with the monistic view expressed in the older and arguably more authoritative Tirumantiram of Tirumular. The &quot;Shiva Sutras&quot; appeared to Vasugupta in a dream, according to tradition. The &quot;Spandakārikā&quot; was either composed by Vasugupta or his student Bhatta Kallata.

===Main theologians of the Trika===
The main theologians of Trika Shaivism are those of the Pratyabhijñā (Recognition) school of Shaiva non-dual philosophy.

Somānanda was the first theologian of the recognition school and his main work is the &quot;Śivadr̥ṣṭi&quot;. However, it was Utpaladeva (c. 900–950 CE) and Abhinavagupta (c. 950–1016, a student of one of Utpaladeva&#x27;s disciples) who developed the system into its mature form. Utpaladeva&#x27;s &quot;Īśvarapratyabhijñā-kārikā (Verses on the Recognition of the Lord)&quot; is one of the main works of this tradition, however, it was overshadowed by the work of Abhinavagupta. Thus, according to Torella, &quot;Abhinavagupta&#x27;s &quot;Īśvarapratyabhijñā-Vimarśinī&quot; and the &quot;Īśvarapratyabhijñā-Vivr̥ti-Vimarśinī&quot; (a commentary on Utpaladeva’s Vivr̥ti on his own &quot;Īśvarapratyabhijñā-Kārikā&quot; and Vr̥tti) are generally considered the standard works of the Pratyabhijñā.&quot; Torella notes however, that &quot;most of Abhinavagupta’s ideas are just the development of what Utpaladeva had already expounded.&quot;

Abhinavagupta&#x27;s tantric synthesis was the most influential form of the tantric &quot;Kashmir Shaivism&quot;. It brought together elements from the following sampradayas (lineages): the Trika, Pratyabhijñā, the Kaula Krama, and Shaiva Siddhantha.

Abhinavagupta wrote numerous other works on Shaiva tantra. His &quot;Tantrāloka&quot;, &quot;Mālinīślokavārttika&quot;, and &quot;Tantrasāra&quot; are mainly based on the &quot;Mālinīvijayottara Tantra&quot;, although they also drew heavily on the Kali-based Krama tradition of the Kulamārga. Abhinavagupta&#x27;s &quot;Tantrāloka&quot; is probably his most important work. According to Christopher Wallis, &quot;the &quot;Tantrāloka&quot; is a monumental explication of Tantrik practice and philosophy in over 5,800 verses. It is encyclopedic in its scope though not organized like an encyclopedia, for instead of just enumerating theories and practices, it brings them all into a coherent framework in which everything has its place and everything makes sense in relation to the whole.&quot;

One of Abhinavagupta&#x27;s students, Kshemaraja, is also an important figure who authored the short &quot;Pratyabhijñāhṛdayam&quot; (&quot;The Essence of Self-Recognition&quot;).

Jayaratha (1150–1200 CE) wrote a commentary on the &quot;Tantrāloka&quot;.

=== Decline and influence ===
The institutional basis and support for the Trika Shaiva tradition mostly disappeared with Islamic conquests of the region leading to the slow decline and contraction of the tradition (though it continued to be passed down and practiced well into the 18th century).

However, the Trika Shaiva tradition was widely influential on other Indian religious traditions, particularly the Haṭha-yoga traditions, such as the Nāth school of Gorakṣa and the Dasanāmī Sannyāsins, which draw much of their yogic practice and ideas of the subtle body from Trika scriptures.

Trika Shaivism also strongly influenced Shakta traditions. Śrīvidyā, which likely originated in Kashmir, relied heavily on Trika philosophy in its seminal explanatory texts like the Yoginīhṛdaya and received commentaries by Trika masters like Jayaratha, and became an influential tradition on mainstream Hinduism, flourishing with institutional support in South India. Another tantric tradition influenced by Trika was the post-classical Kalikula (family of &quot;Kali&quot;) form of Shaktism which is influential in northeastern Indian regions, such as in Bengal, Orissa, and Nepāl.

=== 20th-century revival ===

The number of major writers and publications declined after approximately the 14th century, although writers such as Rājānaka Ānanda Kavi, Anantaśaktipāda, Śivopādhyāya, Bhāskarakaṇṭha, Rājānaka Lakṣmīrāma, and Harabhaṭṭa Śāstri continued to produce important commentaries on core Kashmiri Shaiva texts into the early 20th century. In the 20th century Swami Lakshman Joo, a Kashmiri Hindu, helped revive both the scholarly and yogic streams of Kashmir Shaivism. His contribution is enormous. He inspired a generation of scholars who made Kashmir Shaivism a legitimate field of inquiry within the academy.

Acharya Rameshwar Jha, a disciple of Lakshman Joo, is often credited with establishing the roots of Kashmir Shaivism in the learned community of Varanasi. Rameshwar Jha with his creativity, familiarity with the ancient texts and personal experiences provided access to concepts of non-dualistic Kashmir Shaivism. His writings of Sanskrit verses have been published as the books &quot;Purnta Pratyabhijna&quot; and &quot;Samit Swatantram&quot;.

Lilian Silburn (1908–1993) was a French Indologist specialising in Kashmir Shaivism, Tantra and Buddhism. Working together with Louis Renou, she translated from Sanskrit and published the core scriptures of Kashmir Shaivism, including &quot;Shiva Sutras of Vasugupta&quot;, &quot;Vijnana Bhairava Tantra&quot;, and others, many being first-ever translations of the recently discovered texts. Silburn, a student of Lakshman Joo, authored &quot;Kundalini: The Energy of the Depths, A Comprehensive Study Based on the Scriptures of Nondualistic Kasmir Saivism&quot; (Shaiva Traditions of Kashmir, State University of New York Press, 1988).

Swami Muktananda, although not belonging to the direct lineage of Kashmir Shaivism, felt an affinity for the teachings, validated by his own direct experience. He encouraged Motilal Banarsidass to publish Jaideva Singh&#x27;s translations of &quot;Shiva Sutras&quot;, &quot;Pratyabhijnahrdayam&quot;, &quot;Spanda Karikas&quot; and &quot;Vijnana Bhairava&quot;, all of which Singh studied in-depth with Lakshman Joo. He also introduced Kashmir Shaivism to a wide audience of western meditators through his writings and lectures on the subject.

The &quot;Vijnana Bhairava Tantra&quot;, a chapter from the &quot;Rudrayamala Tantra&quot;, was introduced to the West by Paul Reps, a student of Lakshman Joo, by including an English translation in his book &quot;Zen Flesh, Zen Bones&quot;. Cast as a discourse between the god Shiva and his consort Devi or Shakti, it presents 112 meditation methods or centering techniques (&quot;dharana&quot;s).

The four key Trika mandalas from Abhinavagupta’s &quot;Tantrāloka,&quot; previously considered indecipherable, were translated, decoded and illustrated by Christian de Vietri in his 2024 book titled &quot;Trika Maṇḍala Prakāśa&quot;.

==Practice==
=== Prerequisites ===

Since it is a Tantric tradition, a necessary prerequisite for Trika yogic practice is tantric initiation or dīkṣa. The &quot;Mālinīvijayottara Tantra,&quot; a major source for the tradition, states: &quot;Without initiation there is no qualification for Saiva yoga.&quot;

Although domesticated into a householder tradition, Kashmir Shaivism recommended a &quot;secret&quot; performance of Kaula practices in keeping with its tantric heritage. This was to be done in seclusion from public eyes, therefore allowing one to maintain the appearance of a typical householder.

The &quot;Mālinīvijayottara Tantra&quot; outlines several major preconditions conferring the authority to practice Yoga:The Yogin who has mastered posture [and] the mind, controlled the vital energy, subdued the senses, conquered sleep, overcome anger and agitation and who is free from deceit, should practise Yoga in a quiet, pleasant cave or earthen hut free from all obstructions.

=== Six &quot;laksyas&quot; ===

Numerous texts, including the Mālinīvijayottara Tantra, outline six &quot;varieties of the goal&quot; or &quot;targets&quot; (laksyas) of yogic practices, mainly.

* Contemplation of void (&quot;vyoman&quot;), which bestows all Perfections and liberation.
* Contemplation of body (&quot;vigraha&quot;), which bestows the coercion of deities like Visnu or Rudra
* Contemplation of drop (&quot;bindu&quot;), which bestows sovereignty over Yogins
* Contemplation of phoneme (&quot;varna&quot;), which bestows the Perfection of mantra
* Contemplation of world (&quot;bhuvana&quot;), which bestows regency of a world
* Contemplation of resonance (&quot;dhvani&quot;), which leads to isolation and liberation.

Each of the goals is given specific practices. For example, in the &quot;Mālinīvijayottara Tantra,&quot; perfecting the Void is said to be reached by moving the mind and vital energy (through the use of mantric resonance) through two groups of three voids located along the central channel (which are also correlated with a system of six cakras), reaching to the region above the head. Different scriptures outline different lists of voids and their location in the body. The practice of resonance deals with various sounds, and how the yogin is to focus on a specific sound and its resonance within the central channel.

Regarding mantra, different Saiva tantras and texts teach different mantras and bija (seed) mantras. These mantras are generally intoned (&quot;uccara&quot;) at different positions in the body along the central channel (such as at the heart, throat, forehead, etc). The &quot;Diksottara tantra&quot; for example, teaches the intonation of the &quot;&#x27;haṃsá&quot;&#x27; mantra, beginning in the heart region. Some texts teach &quot;a lineal ascent through the heart, the throat, the palate, and the forehead, culminating with the transcendence of sonic experience as the &#x27;Limit of Resonance&#x27; [&quot;nadanta&quot;] in the cranium is pierced.&quot; Other texts have the mantric energy follow the breath through the nose outside the body.

=== Yogas ===
Since Trika Saivism is a synthesis of various traditions, its texts, such as the Mālinīvijayottara Tantra, distinguish four different types of Saiva yoga. According to Somadev Vasudeva:Two of these have been assimilated from the Tantras of the Siddhanta which has two schools, one monist and the other dualist [1.] the conquest of the reality-levels (&quot;tattvajaya&quot;), which has been transformed into a radically new type of yoga based on the fifteen levels of the apperceptive process, and, [2.] the yoga of six ancillaries (&quot;ṣaḍaṅgayoga&quot;), which is taken over with only minor variations. The third is [3.] Kaula yoga with its system of four immersions (pindastha, padastha, rupastha and rupatita) and as a fourth may be counted [4.] the three types of possession (avesa) taught in the Trika (anava, sakta and sambhava) which are innovatively presented as three meta-categories under which all yogic exercises can be subsumed.
==== The conquest of the tattvas ====
In Trika texts as well as those of other Saiva schools, it is common to formulate the process of yogic conquest of the realities (tattvas) as a series of Dhāraṇās. Dhāraṇās (&quot;introspections&quot;) are &quot;complex sequences of meditative practices&quot; which focus on a series of contemplations on a &quot;hierarchy of apperceptive states designed to bring him ever closer to the level of the highest perceiver, Shiva&quot;. This hierarchy of meditations and visualizations is based on the Shaiva schema of the 36 tattvas. According to Somadev Vasudeva, the procedure can be described thus:The Yogin starts by disengaging the mind from external stimuli and then fixes it upon a tattva [such as earth, water, etc] with ever deepening absorption. He attains an internalised vision of the reality, and compares it with his authoritative, scriptural knowledge of the highest level. By means of tarka [reasoning], an ontological value judgement, he discerns that it is different from Siva and thus transcends it. The Yogin’s ascension inevitably brings him to the reality which is Siva at the zenith of all paths.One example of the meditation on the tattva of buddhi (intellect) from the &quot;Mālinīvijayottara Tantra&quot; is as follows:Contemplating in the heart a lotus with colour of the rising sun, with eight petals containing the [eight bhavas] of dharma etc., and a pericarp, [the Yogin’s] intellect becomes steady within a month. Within six he becomes a knower of the Sruti (scripture). Within three years he himself becomes an author of scriptures. Contemplating his own [physical] form there (in the heart), he perceives the principle of intellect.

==== Yoga with six ancillaries (&quot;ṣaḍaṅgayoga&quot;) ====
Trika yoga generally uses a system of six &quot;limbs&quot; or ancillaries (&quot;aṅgas&quot;) which are seen as subsidiary to the principle conquest of the tattvas. This system was adopted from the Saiva Siddhanta as well as in Pāñcarātra scriptures such as the &quot;Jayakhyasamhita&quot;. According to Somadeva Vasudeva, in Trika, &quot;ṣaḍaṅgayoga&quot; &quot;is to be understood as a collection of helpful or even indispensable yogic techniques which enable the prospective Yogin to achieve the required “coalescence” or “identification” (&quot;tanmayata&quot;, lit. the “consisting-of-that-ness”) with the object of contemplation.&quot;

These six subsidiaries as outlined by the &quot;Mālinīvijayottara Tantra,&quot; are:

*Prānāyāma, control of the &quot;breath&quot; or &quot;vital energy&quot; (prana), includes various forms of inhalation, exhalation, kumbhakah, as well as proper posture (asana), defined as either lotus or some other seated posture. The practice of &quot;udgatha&quot; (eruption) is also taught, which is a &quot;process whereby the retained air is propelled or launched upwards from the navel-region so that it strikes the head.&quot;
*Dhāranā (fixations or concentrations). Four are taught: Fire, Water, Sovereign (defined as bindu and nada) and Nectar (fixating upon a lunar disc above the cranium which drops divine nectar into the central channel, filling the body).
*Tarka (judgment or reasoning), defined as &quot;the ascertainment of what is to be cultivated and what is to be rejected.&quot;
*Dhyāna (meditation), defined as &quot;attentive contemplation on Siva&quot; or &quot;a focused stream of awareness directed towards the judged and thus accepted reality&quot;.
*Samādhi, a deep absorption that arises from prolonged (the text states 48 minutes) and &quot;firmly established&quot; meditation, in which the yogin &quot;becomes as though non-existent. He reaches a state where he becomes as though dead, from which even intense sounds and other such [sense data] cannot rouse him.&quot;
*Pratyāhāra, complete withdrawal of the mind

In the &quot;Mālinīvijayottara Tantra&quot; (chapter 17)&quot;,&quot; these are seen as six progressive steps leading to complete identification with the object of meditation. It is important to note that different Saiva tantras outline different forms of the six ancillaries, and &quot;there is no consensus as to their order, their definition or even their subdivisions&quot; among the different tantras.

==== Yogic suicide ====
The practice of &quot;utkrānti&quot;, also called &quot;yogic suicide&quot;, is also taught in nondual Saiva Tantras like the &quot;Mālinīvijayottara Tantra,&quot; which uses the vital energy rising through the central channel to end one&#x27;s life and proceed to union with Siva. The text says that this abandonment of the body can be done at the end of one&#x27;s life, after one has mastered all that one has set out to achieve.

=== Four &quot;upayas&quot; ===
To attain &quot;moksha&quot;, &quot;sādhana&quot; or spiritual practice is necessary. Trika texts describes four major methods (&quot;upāya&quot;-s) to reach total immersion (samāveśa) into the divine:

# &quot;āṇavopāya&quot;, the embodied method or individual method, which emphasizes various techniques which make use of the body, breath, centers of the subtle body (chakras) and the imagination and focuses on the power of action (kriyā-śakti). This method includes most of the usual methods of classical yoga: meditation (dhyāna), prāṇāyāma, visualization, mantras, meditation with seed syllables (varṇa-uccāra), activation of the subtle centers, yogic postures (karaṇa), and meditative ritual performance (pūjā). In the Tantrasāra, Abhinavagupta defines this method as &quot;that which is applied in the spheres of imagination, prāṇa, the body, and external things. There is absolutely no difference among these methods in that the practice of any of them may yield the supreme fruit.&quot; 
# &quot;śāktopāya&quot;, the empowered method, or the method of the power of consciousness. Wallis writes that this method &quot;focuses on shedding mental constructs that are not in alignment with reality (aśuddha-vikalpas) and the cultivation of wisdom, that is, modes of understanding that are in alignment with reality (śuddha-vikalpas).&quot; This method mainly works with the power of knowing (jñāna-śakti) and emphasizes the use of the power of cognition to purify and refine our mental constructs (vikalpas) and the energy of our thoughts and emotions so as to bring them into full alignment with the truth. 
# &quot;śāmbhavopāya&quot;, the method of consciousness. This method is a way of grace which works with the pure will (icchā-śakti) of consciousness. It is a non-conceptual (nirvikalpa) method, which may work with everyday experiences, bija mantras or certain simple techniques to access the divine, such as gazing at the sky, becoming absorbed in a powerful emotion or the practice of &quot;catching hold of the first moment of perception.&quot; Wallis defines it as an &quot;immediate intuitive apprehension of the total flow of reality as it is, free of thought-constructs, dawning within awareness already whole and complete (pūrṇa), even if momentary.&quot; 
# &quot;anupāya&quot; the ‘methodless’ method. Wallis explains this as a very rare case in which &quot;a śaktipāta awakening so intense that one single teaching from a true guru is enough to stabilize that awakening permanently.&quot;

==Philosophy==

===Influences and major exponents===
The philosophy of Trika Shaivism is called &quot;Pratyabhijñā&quot; (Recognition) and it is mainly a nondual idealistic and monistic theism. It is influenced by the works of the Saiva monist Vasugupta (c. 800–850 CE) and numerous Śaiva scriptures such as the Agamas, the Śaiva-Śakta Tantras and Kaula scriptures. The Trika philosophical system of &quot;Pratyabhijñā&quot; is presented in the works of Somānanda (c. 900–950 CE), Utpaladeva (c. 925–975 CE), Abhinavagupta (c. 975–1025 CE) and his disciple Kṣemarāja (c. 1000–1050).

According to Christopher Wallis, the philosophy of Trika Shaivism also adopted much of the ontological apparatus of Sāṅkhya school, such as its system of 25 &quot;tattvas,&quot; expanding and reinterpreting it for its own system of 36 tattvas. Another important source for Trika is the monistic theism of Tirumular&#x27;s Shaiva Siddhanta. The Saivas also were influenced by the work of Buddhist Vijñānavāda and Pramanavada philosophers, especially Dharmakirti, who was also taken as a primary non-Saiva opponent and whose doctrines were sometimes absorbed into the &quot;Pratyabhijñā&quot; system.

===Metaphysics and theology===
The philosophy of Recognition, as outlined by thinkers like Utpaladeva, teaches that though the identity of all souls is one with God (Isvara) or Shiva (which is the single reality, Being and absolute consciousness), they have forgotten this due to Maya or ignorance. However, through knowledge one can recognize one&#x27;s authentic divine nature and become a liberated being. Another important element of Trika theology is the active and dynamic nature of consciousness, which is described as the spontaneous vibration or pulsation (&quot;spanda&quot;) of universal consciousness, which is an expression of its freedom (&quot;svātāntrya&quot;) and power (&quot;Śakti&quot;). Because of this, though this philosophy is idealist, it affirms the reality of the world and everyday life, as a real transformation (&quot;parinama&quot;), manifestation or appearance (&quot;ābhāsa&quot;) of the absolute consciousness. The Absolute is also explained through the metaphor of light (&quot;prakasha&quot;) and reflective awareness (&quot;vimarsha&quot;).

The basic theology of Trika&#x27;s Recognition school, as summarised by Utpaladeva in &quot;Īśvarapratyabhijñā-Kārikā&quot; (Verses on the Recognition of the Lord), is as follows:There is only one Great Divinity, and it is the very inner Self of all creatures. It embodies itself as all things, full of unbroken awareness of three kinds: “I”, “this”, and “I am this.”The school&#x27;s theology is expressed by Kshemaraja in his &quot;Pratyabhijñā-hṛdayam&quot; (&quot;The Heart of Recognition&quot;) as follows:Awareness, free and independent, is the cause of the performance of everything. She unfolds the universe through Her own will and on Her own canvas. It becomes diverse by its division into mutually adapting subjects and objects. The individual conscious being, as a condensation of universal Awareness, embodies the entire universe in a microcosmic form.The modern scholar-practitioner of Shaiva Tantra, Christopher Wallis outlines the metaphysics and theology of non-dual Shaiva Tantra thus:

All that exists, throughout all time and beyond, is one infinite divine Consciousness, free and blissful, which projects within the field of its awareness a vast multiplicity of apparently differentiated subjects and objects: each object an actualization of a timeless potentiality inherent in the Light of Consciousness, and each subject the same plus a contracted locus of self-awareness. This creation, a divine play, is the result of the natural impulse within Consciousness to express the totality of its self-knowledge in action, an impulse arising from love. The unbounded Light of Consciousness contracts into finite embodied loci of awareness out of its own free will. When those finite subjects then identify with the limited and circumscribed cognitions and circumstances that make up this phase of their existence, instead of identifying with the transindividual overarching pulsation of pure Awareness that is their true nature, they experience what they call “suffering.” To rectify this, some feel an inner urge to take up the path of spiritual gnosis and yogic practice, the purpose of which is to undermine their misidentification and directly reveal within the immediacy of awareness the fact that the divine powers of Consciousness, Bliss, Willing, Knowing, and Acting comprise the totality of individual experience as well—thereby triggering a recognition that one’s real identity is that of the highest Divinity, the Whole in every part. This experiential gnosis is repeated and reinforced through various means until it becomes the nonconceptual ground of every moment of experience, and one’s contracted sense of self and separation from the Whole is finally annihilated in the incandescent radiance of the complete expansion into perfect wholeness. Then one’s perception fully encompasses the reality of a universe dancing ecstatically in the animation of its completely perfect divinity.This single supreme reality is also sometimes referred to as &quot;Aham&quot; (the heart). It is considered to be a non-dual interior space of Śiva, support for the entire manifestation, supreme mantra and identical to Śakti. In Kashmir Shivaism the highest form of Kali is Kalasankarshini who is nirguna, formless and is often show as a flame above the head of &quot;Guhya Kali&quot; the highest gross form of Kali. In Nepali Newar arts, both form and formless attributes of Kali is often envisioned in a single art form showing the hierarchy of goddesses in their tradition. In it Guhyakali image culminates in flame, with Kalasankarshini, the highest deity in the sequence, who consumes time within herself and is envisioned solely as a flame representing Para Brahman.

====Theology of the Triad or Trika====

An important element of Trika Shaivism&#x27;s theology is the use of several triads (symbolized by the trident) in its theological explanation of the Absolute reality. There are several triads described in Trika theology of thinkers like Abhinavagupta including,

* Three realities: Śiva (The Supreme Transcendent), Śakti (immanent in creation, the link between the macrocosm and the microcosm) and (the limited atom or individual, a complete image of the ultimate, the microcosm of the macrocosm).
*Three powers: &quot;Icchā&quot; (will), &quot;Jñāna&quot; (knowledge), and &quot;Kriyā&quot; (action). Any action of any being, including God, is subject to these three fundamental energies. Iccha or Will is in the beginning of any action or process. Jnana by which the action is clearly expressed first in mind, before it is put into action. Then comes Kriyā, the energy of the action.
* Three entities: &quot;pati&quot; (Śiva), &quot;pāśa&quot; (bondage), &quot;paśu&quot; (soul)
* Shakti Triad or Three Goddesses: Parā (transcendence), Parāparā (transcendence and immanence) and Aparā śakti (immanence)
* Three aspects of knowledge: &quot;Pramatri&quot; (the subject), &quot;Pramana&quot; (the modalities of knowledge) and &quot;Prameya&quot; - the known object
* Three states of consciousness: &quot;jāgrat&quot; (waking), &quot;svapna&quot; (dreaming) and &quot;suṣupti&quot; (dreamless sleep)
* Three-fold spiritual path: &quot;Śāmbhavopāya&quot;, &quot;Śāktopāya&quot; and &quot;&quot;
* The transcendental triad: &quot;prakāśa&quot; (luminosity), &quot;vimarśa&quot; (dynamics),&quot;sāmarasya&quot; (homogeneous bliss)
* The three impurities: āṇavamala, māyā, karma

===Comparison with Advaita Vedanta===
Kashmir Shaivism and Advaita Vedanta are both non-dual philosophies that give primacy to Universal Consciousness (&quot;Chit&quot; or &quot;Brahman&quot;). In Kashmir Shaivism, all things are a manifestation of this Consciousness, but the phenomenal world (&quot;Śakti&quot;) is real, existing and having its being in Consciousness (&quot;Chit&quot;). Jaideva Singh lists seven key differences between Advaita and Kashmir Shaivism, where in Kashmir Shaivism, (1) the absolute is active, rather than passive, (2) the world is a real appearance, rather than false (mithyā), (3) grace (anugraha) has a soteriological role, (4) the ātman is present in the human body in dynamic form (spaṇda), rather than as a pure witness (sākṣī), (5) the methods include all four upāyas, rather than solely emphasize Śāmbhavopāya, (6) ignorance (avidyā) is uprooted at both intellectual (bauddha) and personal (paurusha) levels, rather than just the intellectual level, and (7) liberation (muktī) is not an isolation from the world (kaivalya) but an integration into world which appears as Shiva.

According to Mark S. G. Dyczkowski, Kashmiri Trika Shaivism looks to three scriptures &quot;as its primary authorities&quot;, the &quot;Mālinīvijayottara Tantra&quot;, the &quot;Siddhayogeśvarīmata and the Anāmaka-tantra.&quot;

As a monistic tantric system, Trika Shaivism, as it is also known, draws teachings from shrutis, such as the monistic &quot;Bhairava Tantras&quot;, Shiva Sutras of Vasugupta, and also a unique version of the &quot;&quot; which has a commentary by Abhinavagupta, known as the &quot;Gitartha Samgraha&quot;. Teachings are also drawn from the &quot;Tantrāloka&quot; of Abhinavagupta, prominent among a vast body of &quot;smritis&quot; employed by Kashmir Shaivism.

In general, the whole written tradition of Shaivism can be divided in three fundamental parts: &quot;Āgama Śāstra&quot;, &quot;Spanda Śāstra&quot; and &quot;Pratyabhijñā Śāstra&quot;.

1. &quot;Āgama Śāstra&quot; are those writings that are considered as being a direct revelation from Siva. These writings were first communicated orally, from the master to the worthy disciple. They include essential works such as &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &quot;&quot; and others. There are also numerous commentaries to these works, &quot;&quot; having most of them.

2. &#x27;, the main work of which is &#x27; of Bhatta Kallata, a disciple of Vasugupta, with its many commentaries. Out of them, two are of major importance: &#x27; (this commentary talks only about the first verses of &#x27;), and &quot;&quot; (which is a commentary of the complete text).

3. &quot;Pratyabhijñā Śāstra&quot; are those writings which have mainly a metaphysical content. Due to their extremely high spiritual and intellectual level, this part of the written tradition of Shaivism is the least accessible for the uninitiated. Nevertheless, this corpus of writings refers to the simplest and most direct modality of spiritual realization. &quot;Pratyabhijñā&quot; means &quot;recognition&quot; and refers to the spontaneous recognition of the divine nature hidden in each human being (atman). The most important works in this category are: &#x27;, the fundamental work of Utpaladeva, and &#x27;, a commentary to &#x27;. &#x27; means in fact the direct recognition of the Lord (&quot;Īśvara&quot;) as identical to one&#x27;s Heart. Before &quot;Utpaladeva&quot;, his master Somānanda wrote &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Vision of Siva&quot;), a devotional poem written on multiple levels of meaning.

<text>&quot;Knockin&#x27; on Heaven&#x27;s Door&quot; is a song by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, written for the soundtrack of the 1973 film &quot;Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid&quot;. Released as a single two months after the film&#x27;s premiere, it became a worldwide hit, reaching the Top 10 in several countries. The song became one of Dylan&#x27;s most popular and most covered post-1960s compositions, spawning covers from Eric Clapton, Guns N&#x27; Roses, Randy Crawford, and more.

Described by Dylan biographer Clinton Heylin as &quot;an exercise in splendid simplicity&quot;, the song features two short verses, the lyrics of which comment directly on the scene in the film for which it was written: the death of a frontier lawman (Slim Pickens) who refers to his wife (Katy Jurado) as &quot;Mama&quot;.

It was ranked number 190 in 2004 by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, in their 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, and number 192 in 2010.

==Other Bob Dylan versions==
According to his website, Dylan has performed the song in concert 460 times between its live debut in 1974 and its last outing in 2003. Some of these versions have appeared on Dylan&#x27;s live and &quot;Bootleg Series&quot; albums including:
* &quot;Before the Flood&quot;
* &quot;Bob Dylan at Budokan&quot;
* &quot;Dylan &amp; the Dead&quot;
* &quot;The 30th Anniversary Concert Celebration&quot;
* &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;
* &quot;Thirty-Nine Years of Great Concert Performances&quot;
* &quot;The Rolling Thunder Revue&quot;

==Eric Clapton and Arthur Louis versions==
In January 1975 Eric Clapton played on Arthur Louis&#x27;s recording of &quot;Knockin&#x27; on Heaven&#x27;s Door&quot; which was arranged in a cross-over reggae style. After the recording sessions with Louis, Clapton recorded his own version of the song which was released as a single in August 1975 two weeks after Louis&#x27;s version. This version was released on &quot;&quot;. Clapton&#x27;s version made it to No. 38 on the UK charts, but the single was less successful in the U.S. where it failed to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 (although it reached on No. 109 on &quot;Cashbox&#x27;s&quot; Looking Ahead chart). Clapton&#x27;s 1996 boxed set &quot;Crossroads 2: Live in the Seventies&quot; features a performance of the song recorded in London in April 1977. There were also performances of the song included on the &quot;Journeyman&quot; (1990) and the &quot;One More Car, One More Rider&quot; (2003) world tours. Several Clapton compilation albums also feature the song.

==Guns N&#x27; Roses versions==

In 1987, American hard rock band Guns N&#x27; Roses started performing the song. A live version of the song was released on the 12-inch single of &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot; the same year. They recorded and released a studio version in 1990 for the soundtrack of the film &quot;Days of Thunder&quot; that reached No. 18 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Album Rock Tracks chart and No. 56 on Canada&#x27;s &quot;RPM&quot; 100 Hit Tracks chart.

This studio recording was slightly modified for the band&#x27;s 1991 album &quot;Use Your Illusion II&quot;, discarding the responses in the second verse. Released as the second single from the album, it reached No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart and the New Zealand Singles Chart. Elsewhere, the single topped the charts of Portugal, Belgium, and the Netherlands; it was the best-selling song of 1992 in the latter country. In Ireland, where the song also reached No. 1, it became Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; third (and to date last) number-one single as well as their ninth consecutive top-five hit.

Their performance of the song at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert in 1992 was used as the B-side for the single release and was also included on their &quot;Live Era &#x27;87–&#x27;93&quot; album, released in 1999. Another version was released on the video &quot;Use Your Illusion World Tour - 1992 in Tokyo II&quot;. The music video for this version of the song was directed by Andy Morahan.

==Dunblane tribute==

In 1996 and with the consent of Dylan, Scottish musician Ted Christopher wrote a new verse for &quot;Knockin&#x27; on Heaven&#x27;s Door&quot; in memory of the schoolchildren and teacher killed in the Dunblane school massacre. This has been, according to some sources, one of the few times Dylan has officially authorized anybody to add or change the lyrics to one of his songs.

This version of the song, featuring children from the village singing the chorus with the guitarist and producer of Dylan&#x27;s album &quot;Infidels&quot; (1983), Mark Knopfler, was released on December 9, 1996, in the United Kingdom and reached No. 1 on the UK and Scottish Singles Charts, as well as No. 6 in Iceland and Ireland. The proceeds went to charities for children.
The song was featured on the compilation album &quot;Hits 97&quot;, where all royalties from the song were given to three charities.

==Sampled version==
Gabrielle&#x27;s single &quot;Rise&quot; (2000) sampled from this song. Dylan liked &quot;Rise&quot; so much that he allowed Gabrielle to use the sample for free, while receiving a co-writer credit for providing the song&#x27;s chord progression and vocal sample.

<doc id="1308644" wikidata="Q960059" url="?curid=1308644" title="Hughes brothers">
<text>Albert Hughes and Allen Hughes (born April 1, 1972), known together professionally as the Hughes Brothers, are American twin brother filmmakers. They are known for visceral and often violent films, including &quot;Menace II Society&quot; (1993), &quot;Dead Presidents&quot; (1995), &quot;From Hell&quot; (2001), and &quot;The Book of Eli&quot; (2010). They did most of their collaborations between 1993 and 2001. They have primarily worked separately since Albert moved to Prague in 2004, with &quot;The Book of Eli&quot; being the only film they have directed together following his move.

==Early lives==
Albert and Allen Hughes were born in Detroit on April 1, 1972, the twin sons of Armenian-American mother Aida and African-American father Albert Hughes. Aida&#x27;s family were Iranian-Armenians from Tehran. Albert is older by nine minutes. Although they originally believed themselves to be fraternal twins, the brothers now suspect they may be identical despite not having had a DNA test. Their parents divorced when they were two years old. At the age of nine, the brothers moved with their mother to Claremont, California, where she raised them alone while putting herself through school and starting her own vocational center. Supportive of her sons&#x27; ambitions as filmmakers, she gave them a video camera when they were 12. They spent their free time making short films, and when a teacher suggested that they make a &quot;How-To&quot; film for an assignment, they created the short film &quot;How to Be a Burglar&quot;.

==Career==
Allen and singer Stevvi Alexander had a son together at the age of 18, prompting the twins to drop out of high school and begin working on music videos. They soon directed for artists such as Tone Loc and Tupac Shakur. Their first feature film, 1993&#x27;s &quot;Menace II Society&quot;, premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. Centering on black, disenfranchised youth, it was made on a budget of $3.5 million when they were 20 years old. Tyger Williams wrote the screenplay, and shared story credit with the brothers. It became a critical as well as a box office success and was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award for Best First Feature. Because of their previous experience in directing music videos, they became the first sibling duo since Jerry and David Zucker allowed a waiver by the Directors Guild of America to take co-credit as directors.

Their second film was &quot;Dead Presidents&quot; in 1995. Dealing with the black underclass society like their feature film debut, and also starring Larenz Tate, the film centered on war veterans during the racially charged Vietnam War era. The film, which was released at the New York Critics Film Festival, failed to make as much of a profit as their first film. They followed &quot;Dead Presidents&quot; with &quot;American Pimp&quot;, a feature-length documentary about the underground pimp culture and exploitation of women. It premiered at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival. They had originally set out to do an adaptation of Iceberg Slim&#x27;s novel &quot;Pimp&quot;, but someone else acquired the rights. The brothers have stated that the film&#x27;s perspective was partially shaped by being raised by their mother, who is a feminist and a lesbian. In between projects, they filmed several anti-handgun public service announcements.

In a departure from their previous material, the Hughes brothers co-directed &quot;From Hell&quot;, the 2001 film adaptation of Alan Moore&#x27;s graphic novel of the same name about the Jack the Ripper murders in Victorian England, starring Johnny Depp and Heather Graham. Considered too violent and gory by some critics, the film had to be edited in order to avoid an NC-17 rating by the MPAA. As described by the film&#x27;s star, there were sometimes disagreements between the twins regarding the direction of the film. For example, the amount of shown violence was a point of contention between the two; one brother thought the brutality should be shown, while the other believed implied violence would suffice.

Their only film together since 2001&#x27;s &quot;From Hell&quot; was the post-apocalyptic drama &quot;Book of Eli&quot;, which was released in January 2010.

In 2006, the brothers were announced as directing &quot;The Iceman&quot;, a film about serial killer Richard Kuklinski, but it was eventually directed by Ariel Vromen, and released in 2012. They were also slated to direct a film version of the classic TV series &quot;Kung Fu&quot;. It was announced in 2010 that the brothers were tapped to direct a live-action adaptation of the 1988 manga &quot;Akira&quot;, but they left the project in 2011.

When the brothers collaborate, Allen typically works with the actors while Albert handles the technical aspects of their films, stemming from his experience of studying at Los Angeles City College&#x27;s film school.

==Solo projects==
===Allen===
Allen directed a few episodes of the American version of the TV series &quot;Touching Evil&quot; (for which his brother was an executive producer) as well as the 2005 television feature &quot;Knights of the South Bronx&quot;.

In 2009, Allen directed a segment of &quot;New York, I Love You&quot;, starring Drea De Matteo and Bradley Cooper.

Allen Hughes directed the 2013 film &quot;Broken City&quot;, a crime thriller starring Mark Wahlberg and Russell Crowe. He directed the four-part 2017 HBO documentary miniseries &quot;The Defiant Ones&quot;, about music producers Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre.

===Albert===
In 2005, it was announced that Albert would direct a feature film called &quot;Art Con&quot;, although no further news was reported on its development.

In December 2012, Albert Hughes announced that he would be producing an online video series using the &quot;Crysis 3&quot; game engine called &quot;The 7 Wonders of Crysis 3&quot;.

In 2018, Albert Hughes directed his first solo feature film, &quot;Alpha&quot;. The film was written by Daniele Sebastian Wiedenhaupt, based on a story written by Hughes, and holds an approval rating of 79% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes.

==Personal lives==
Known as much for their frank manner as for their films, the brothers have been known to get into altercations. They took rapper Tupac Shakur to court in 1994 after he assaulted them during a music video shoot. Shakur had originally been slated to star in &quot;Menace II Society&quot;, but was replaced after the incident, which apparently stemmed from him disliking the role they had chosen for him. He was later sentenced to 15 days in jail for the assault, as well as another incident that occurred the day before his sentencing.

The brothers are open about their marijuana use and have turned down offers to make anti-marijuana commercials.

Allen and singer Stevvi Alexander have a son together named Eric, who was born while the two were in high school.
Albert has a daughter named Adrienne, and has lived in Prague since 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times/Ito&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Albert said of his relationship with Allen in 2013, &quot;I think the relationship is just much more complex now than it used to be. We love each other, and in the end we&#x27;re still the best of friends. We&#x27;re the only people we&#x27;re going to call [when stressful things happen] but we&#x27;re kind of in a weird dance right now.&quot;

<text>Douglas Keith Davey, (April 21, 1926 January 17, 2011) was a Canadian politician and campaign organizer.

== Family, early life and education ==
Born in Toronto, Ontario to Charles Minto Davey (Toronto Star Production Manager) and Grace Viola (née Curtis), Keith Davey attended high school at North Toronto Collegiate Institute. Davey graduated with a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Toronto in 1949.

==Business career==
Davey became a sales manager for CKFH, a Toronto radio station, from 1949 to 1960. The station was owned and managed by noted broadcaster Foster Hewitt.

==Political career==
Davey became a political organizer for the Liberal Party at the constituency level in Toronto in his early 20s, and joined the Executive of the Ontario Young Liberals in the 1950s, along with Judy LaMarsh (later a federal cabinet minister). In 1960 he became a campaign manager for his home riding of Eglinton.

Davey was appointed National Campaign Director of the Liberal Party of Canada in 1961. He directed the Liberal campaigns in 1963 and 1965. Commuting regularly between homes in Ottawa and Toronto, Davey played important roles in every federal Liberal campaign up to and including 1984, serving Prime Ministers Lester Pearson, Pierre Trudeau, and John Turner. These elections were held in 1968, 1972,1974, 
1979, 1980, and 1984.
===Senator (1966-1996)===
Davey was appointed to the Senate of Canada by Lester Pearson in 1966, just before his 40th birthday. He resigned in 1996.

In 1969, Davey chaired the Special Committee on Mass Media. Terence Corcoran argues that it was Davey&#x27;s contention that a subsidized press is necessary &quot;to supplement the privately owned media&quot; which &quot;were a menace to a democratic society.&quot;

==Other==

In 1966, Davey served briefly as the second commissioner of the Canadian Football League, resigning after less than two months on the job, due to stated incompatibility with many leading league figures.

Davey was portrayed on an episode of &quot;King of Kensington&quot; as Senator Keith Davis on the episode titled &quot;Mr. King Goes to Ottawa&quot;; he was portrayed by actor Ken James.
In 1986, Davey published a political memoir, &quot;The Rainmaker: a Passion for Politics&quot;.

Davey was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1999.

==Marriages==
He married Catherine Isobel Hart in 1952; they had three children, Douglas, Ian and Catherine. The union was dissolved around 1975. He remarried to Dorothy Elizabeth Petrie in 1978.

==Death==
Davey died on January 17, 2011, aged 84, at Belmont House in Toronto. He had been suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. He was survived by his second wife, and his three children from his first marriage.

<text>Wittmund is a town and capital of the district of Wittmund, in Lower Saxony, Germany.

==Geography==
Wittmund is a town of 21,000 inhabitants located in Germany&#x27;s historic coastal district of East Frisia, between the towns of Aurich and Jever. The town&#x27;s borough covers an area of which make it one of the largest boroughs in Lower Saxony.

While the town of Wittmund is about from the North Sea coast, its borough includes the little port of Harlesiel which is the starting point for ferries to the island of Wangerooge. Harlesiel is named after the Harle, a small river that starts and finishes within Wittmund borough. (A &quot;siel&quot; is a sluice in a dyke. At low tide, water from the river may flow into the sea.)

==Mayor==
Since November 1, 2006, Rolf Claußen is the mayor of Wittmund. He was reelected in 2014.

==History==
The town of Wittmund, on the edge of the geest, and its surroundings are an ancient area of settlement. It was linked to inland East Frisia&#x27;s network of roads early on and commercially oriented to the nearby coast. Around 1200, Wittmund was the hub of the rural parish (&quot;Landgemeinde&quot;) of Wangerland and was called &quot;Wiedemund&quot; or &quot;Wiedemundheim&quot; at that time. The territorial units of the rural parishes were based roughly on old Frisian districts. Esens was the administrative centre of the Harlingerland.

The chieftain family of Kankena lived in a castle in the town in the late 14th century. Around 1400, Hamburg forces occupied the castle grounds as a result of allegations that the Kankenas had supported piracy against the Hanseatic city. The release of the castle into the hands of the ruling chieftain family of tom Brok saw the Kankenas regaining possession of their estate.

The subsequent ruler of the Brokmerland, Focko Ukena, cleverly took advantage of the weakness of the Kankenas and enlisted them for military operations in the Battle of the Wild Fields, which he won. In 1454 the castle fell to the ruler of Harlingerland, Sibet Attena. In the same year, Sibet Attena united the rulers of Esens, Stedesdorf and Wittmund in order to ensure the independence of Harlingerland against the East Frisian counts. Not until 1600 was the Harlingerland, including Wittmund, finally joined to East Frisia through political and family mergers.

In 1584, the place is recorded on a card as &quot;Witmondt&quot;. Later, the town was given a district (&quot;Amt&quot;) constitution and made into an &quot;Amt&quot; as part of the new comital order. In 1730 &quot;Witmundt&quot; is recorded within the &quot;Amt&quot; of Witmundt on another map. In 1744, East Frisia was absorbed by Prussia, and then, after a brief period under Dutch/French rule, became part of the Kingdom of Hanover in 1815.

Under Hanoverian rule, the &quot;Landdrostei&quot; emerged, with the &quot;Landdrost&quot; as the highest state representative in the province. In 1866, East Frisia once again became part of Prussia. The state of Prussia initially took over the &quot;Amt&quot; structure with its existing &quot;Ämter&quot; of Aurich, Berum, Emden, Esens, Leer, Stickhausen, Weener and Wittmund. From 1884 they were transferred into the new district (&quot;Landkreis&quot;) structure. In East Frisia the new districts of Aurich, Emden (independent), Leer, Norden, Weener and Wittmund (1885) were created. Even the former Hanoverian &quot;Landdrostei&quot; were transformed into administrative provinces (&quot;Regierungsbezirke&quot;). The district hall was built in Wittmund in 1903.

Wittmund was given town rights as early as 1567 by Agnes, Countess of Rietberg. In the 17th century these rights were rescinded and were not granted again until 1929.

The Luftwaffe&#x27;s 71st Tactical Fighter Squadron (&quot; Taktisches Luftwaffengeschwader 71 &quot;Richthofen&quot;&quot;) is based at Wittmundhafen Air Base.

<doc id="1308662" wikidata="Q1801472" url="?curid=1308662" title="Glossopteris">
<text>Glossopteris (etymology: from Ancient Greek γλῶσσα (glôssa, &quot; tongue &quot;) + πτερίς (pterís, &quot; fern &quot;)) is the largest and best-known genus of the extinct Permian order of seed plants known as Glossopteridales (also known as Arberiales, Ottokariales, or Dictyopteridiales). The name &quot;Glossopteris&quot; refers only to leaves, within the framework of form genera used in paleobotany (for likely reproductive organs, see Glossopteridaceae). 

Species of &quot;Glossopteris&quot; were the dominant trees of the middle to high-latitude lowland vegetation across the supercontinent Gondwana during the Permian Period. &quot;Glossopteris&quot; fossils were critical in recognizing former connections between the various fragments of Gondwana: South America, Africa, India, Australia, New Zealand, and Antarctica.

==Description==

The leaves of &quot;Glossopteris&quot; are characterized by their distinctive tongue shape that gives them their name, as well as their reticulate venation. The leaves were either widely spaced on long stems, or were densely helically arranged on short shoots. 

&quot;Glossopteris&quot; bearing plants grew as woody, seed-bearing trees and shrubs. Their trunks had a maximum diameter of , with some likely reaching a height of . They had a softwood interior resembling Araucariaceae conifers. 

Seeds were borne on one side of variably branched or fused structures, and microsporangia containing pollen were borne in clusters at the tips of slender filaments. Both the seed- and pollen-bearing organs were partially fused (adnate) to the leaves, or, in some cases, possibly positioned in the axils of leaves. The homologies of the flattened seed-bearing structures have remained particularly controversial with some arguing that the fertile organs represent megasporophylls (fertile leaves) whereas others have interpreted the structures as flattened, seed-bearing, axillary axes (cladodes). It is unclear whether glossopterids were monoecious or dioecious, the fact that only pollen organ bearing leaves and not ovules were found in some layers suggest that at least some species were the latter.

==Distribution==
More than 70 fossil species of this genus have been recognized in India alone, with additional species from South America, Australia, Africa, Madagascar and Antarctica. Essentially, &quot;Glossopteris&quot; was restricted to the middle- and high-latitude parts of Gondwana during the Permian and was an important contributor to the vast Permian coal deposits of the Southern Hemisphere continents. Most northern parts of South America and Africa lack &quot;Glossopteris&quot; and its associated organs. 

However, in recent years a few disparate localities in Morocco, Oman, Anatolia, the western part of the island of New Guinea, Thailand and Laos have yielded fossils that are of possible glossopterid affinity. These peri-gondwanan records commonly occur together with Cathaysian or Euramerican plant species—the assemblages representing a zone of mixing between the strongly provincial floras of the Permian. Apart from those in India and the peri-gondwanan localities, a few other fossils from the Northern Hemisphere have been assigned to this group, but these are not identified with great certainty. For example, specimens assigned to &quot;Glossopteris&quot; from the far east of Russia in the 1960s are more likely to be misdentifications of other gymnosperms such as &quot;Pursongia&quot;. Confident assignment of fossil leaves to &quot;Glossopteris&quot; normally requires their co-preservation with the distinctive segmented roots of this group (called &quot;Vertebraria&quot;) or with the distinctive fertile organs. In 2018, &quot;Glossopteris&quot; leaves were reported from mid-Permian (Roadian – early Wordian) deposits in Mongolia, then located at high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, but these fossils were not found in association with other typical glossopterid organs, such as chambered roots or reproductive structures, so the phylogenetic affinities of these leaves remain uncertain.

== Chronology ==
The Glossopteridales arose in the Southern Hemisphere around the beginning of the Permian Period (), but became extinct during the end-Permian (Changhsingian) mass extinction. The putative persistence of &quot;Glossopteris&quot; into younger strata is commonly invoked on the basis of the distribution of dispersed taeniate bisaccate pollen. However, this category of pollen is known to have been produced by various seed plants, and Triassic examples, in the absence of convincing co-preserved &quot;Glossopteris&quot; leaves, probably belonged to non-glossopterid groups, such as voltzialean conifers. The distribution of &quot;Glossopteris&quot; across several, now detached, landmasses led Eduard Suess, amongst others, to propose that the southern continents were once amalgamated into a single supercontinent—Pangea. These plants went on to become the dominant elements of the southern flora through the rest of the Permian but disappeared in almost all places at the end of the Permian (). The only potential Triassic records are &quot;Glossopteris&quot; leaves exposed in the banks of the Gopad River near Nidpur, India, but even these records are stratigraphically ambiguous owing to faulting and complex juxtapositioning of Permian and Triassic strata at Nidpur. Moreover, even if some &quot;Glossopteris&quot; leaves do persist above the end-Permian extinction horizon, this level pre-dates the Permian-Triassic boundary proper in continental settings of Gondwana by several hundred thousand years and there are no convincing examples of &quot;Glossopteris&quot; in confidently dated Triassic strata. Although most modern palaeobotany textbooks cite the continuation of glossopterids into later parts of the Triassic and, in some cases into the Jurassic, these ranges are erroneous and are based on misidentification of morphologically similar leaves such as &quot;Gontriglossa&quot;, &quot;Sagenopteris&quot;, or &quot;Mexiglossa&quot;. Glossopterids were, thus, one of the major casualties of the end-Permian mass extinction event.

==Taxonomy==
Long considered a fern after its discovery in the 1820s, it was later assigned to the gymnosperms &quot;sensu lato&quot; (i.e. Spermatophyta). The genus is in the order Glossopteridales, which is placed in the division Pteridospermatophyta (often informally called &quot;seed ferns&quot;). In reality, many of the plant groups included within this division are only distantly related to one another, and the relationships of Glossopteridales to other seed plant groups is unclear. Some authors have suggested that the Glossopteridales are closely related to flowering plants, though the evidence for such a relationship is weak.

&quot;Glossopteris&quot; should strictly be used to refer to the distinctive spathulate fossil leaves with reticulate venation, however, the term has also been used to refer to the parent plant as a whole. Leaves of &quot;Glossopteris&quot; are associated with reproductive structures belonging to the family Dictyopteridiaceae within the Glossopteridales.

The name comes from Ancient Greek ( &#x27;tongue&#x27;), because the leaves were tongue-shaped, and ( &#x27;fern, feathery&#x27;).

==Paleoecology==

They are interpreted to have grown in very wet soil conditions, similar to the modern Bald Cypress. The leaves ranged from about 2 cm to over 30 cm in length.

The profile of glossopterid trees is largely speculative as complete trees have not been preserved. However, based on analogies with modern high-latitude plants, polar-latitude &quot;Glossopteris&quot; trees have been suggested to have had a tapered, conical profile like that of a Christmas tree and to have been relatively widely spaced to take advantage of the low-angle sunlight at high latitudes, instead of needles, they had large, broad lance- or tongue-shaped leaves commonly with well differentiated palisade and spongy mesophyll layers.

&quot;Glossopteris&quot; trees are assumed to have been deciduous, as fossil leaves are commonly found as dense accumulations representing autumnal leaf banks. The broad fossilized growth rings in &quot;Glossopteris&quot; woods from Antarctica, then part of Gondwana, reveal that the plants experienced strong growth spurts each spring-summer but underwent the abrupt cessation of growth before each following winter, a transition that could take as little as a month. The idea that all &quot;Glossopteris&quot; species are deciduous has been challenged, with an isotopic study finding that Antarctic &quot;Glossopteris&quot; forests were mixed evergreen-deciduous.

The &quot;Glossopteris&quot; bearing plants are likely to have primarily been wind pollinated. Seeds borne by &quot;Glossopteris&quot; bearing plants include the genera &quot;Plectilospermum&quot;, &quot;Choanostoma&quot;, &quot;Pachtestopsis&quot;, &quot;Illawarraspermum, Lakkosia, Lonchiphyllum&quot; and &quot;Homevaleia.&quot; Many of these bear wings, and it is likely that at least some of these were wind dispersed. One species &quot;Choanostoma verruculosum,&quot; may have been adapted to being dispersed by water.

&quot;Glossopteris&quot; leaves are morphologically simple so there are few characters that can be used to differentiate species. Consequently, many past researchers have considered the Permian &quot;Glossopteris&quot; flora to be rather homogeneous with the same species distributed throughout the Southern Hemisphere. However, more recent studies of the more morphologically diverse fertile organs have shown that taxa had more restricted regional distributions and several intra-gondwanan floristic provinces are recognizable. Seeds, much too large to be wind-borne, could not have blown across thousands of miles of open sea, nor is it likely they have floated across vast oceans. Observations such as these led the Austrian geologist Eduard Suess to deduce that there had once been a land bridge between these areas. He named this large land mass Gondwanaland (named after the district in India where the plant &quot;Glossopteris&quot; was found). These same observations would also lend support to Alfred Wegener&#x27;s Continental drift theory.

The first Antarctic specimens of &quot;Glossopteris&quot; were discovered by members of Robert Scott&#x27;s doomed &quot;Terra Nova&quot; expedition. The expedition members abandoned much of their gear in an effort to reduce their load, but kept 35 pounds of &quot;Glossopteris&quot; fossils; these were found alongside their bodies.

<doc id="1308687" wikidata="Q5570667" url="?curid=1308687" title="Global Sunday">
<text>Global Sunday was a Canadian news magazine television program which aired Sunday evenings on the Global Television Network. The program was launched in September 2001, with Charles Adler as host. Run separately from the rest of Global&#x27;s news division, the program often reflected the political views of Global&#x27;s founder, Israel Asper and the Asper family, and was designed to showcase a Western Canadian perspective on Canadian political affairs.

The program ran a mix of features reporting and interviews, effectively acting as a cross between a newsmagazine and an American-style Sunday talk show, and aired reportage and panel discussions featuring journalists from both Global News and the network&#x27;s co-owned CanWest News Service network of newspapers.

The program&#x27;s launch also spurred both of Global&#x27;s major rival networks, CTV and CBC, to relaunch Sunday public affairs shows. CTV, which had not produced such a program since the cancellation of Mike Duffy&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Edition&quot; in 1999, relaunched its earlier show &quot;Question Period&quot;, while CBC launched &quot;CBC News: Sunday&quot;.

==Hosts and features==
As a right-wing voice in Canadian television, the show developed a loyal audience, and was broadcast weekly from studios in Calgary, the cultural hotbed of Canadian conservatism. Adler was simultaneously host of a weekday radio talk show on CJOB in Winnipeg, and commuted to Calgary on weekends to host &quot;Global Sunday&quot;.

On February 24, 2002, the show staged and broadcast the candidate debates in the inaugural leadership convention of the then-new Canadian Alliance political party, with Adler as moderator.

Adler, who described his hosting style on the program as &quot;a mix of Larry King, Ted Koppel and Vince McMahon&quot;, also recorded a weekly series of news commentaries for the network&#x27;s weekday &quot;Global National&quot; newscasts concurrently with his stint as host of the program. However, not wishing to continue his schedule of weekly flights to Calgary, Adler resigned after a year. The program was then hosted for the next number of months by a rotating roster of guest hosts, both Global News personalities and outside figures.

In early 2003, Global named a permanent host in Danielle Smith, who at the time was an editorial writer for the &quot;Calgary Herald&quot;. In 2004, the program introduced &quot;The Final Round&quot;, a weekly debate segment featuring Stephen LeDrew and Ezra Levant.

==Cancellation==
With the launch of &quot;Global National&quot;&#x27;s weekend edition in February 2005, the program lost its coveted early-evening timeslot. Ratings and resources both dwindled, and the decision was made in August 2005 to cancel &quot;Global Sunday&quot;. The network replaced it with &quot;Global Currents&quot;, which aired documentary reports, and merged some other features, including &quot;The Final Round&quot;, into the Sunday edition of &quot;Global National&quot;.

In 2011, Global resumed airing a weekly national public affairs show with &quot;The West Block&quot;.

<text>Jeptha Homer Wade (August 11, 1811 – August 9, 1890) was an American industrialist, philanthropist, and one of the founding members of Western Union Telegraph. Wade was born in Romulus, New York, the youngest of nine children of Jeptha and Sarah (Allen) Wade. He made the first Daguerreotypes west of New York, was a portrait painter, and moved to Adrian, Michigan, in 1840 before developing an interest in the telegraph.

==Biography ==
In 1847, he was subcontractor for J.J. Speed and constructed a telegraph line from Detroit to Jackson, Michigan, where Wade and his son operated the telegraph office. He also connected Detroit, Michigan, to Buffalo, New York, Cleveland to Cincinnati (Cleveland and Cincinnati Telegraph Company, the Wade Line), and others.

Wade moved to Cleveland, Ohio, in 1856 with his wife and only child, Randall P. Wade (1835–1876). Eventually Randall would supervise the construction of two adjoining mansions with a shared driveway on Cleveland&#x27;s Euclid Avenue, called Millionaires&#x27; Row. His grandson, Jeptha H. Wade II (1811–1890) commissioned the Cleveland firm of Hubbell &amp; Benes to design several residences, commercial and public buildings.

In 1856 Jeptha helped Hiram Sibley consolidate most of the telegraph industry by forming Western Union through a series of acquisitions and mergers. In 1861, Jeptha Wade joined forces with Benjamin Franklin Ficklin and Hiram Sibley to form the Pacific Telegraph Company. The company&#x27;s formation completed the linkage between the east and west coast of the United States by telegraph. Wade became president of Western Union in 1866. A year later he resigned because of ill-health and sold his interests to Jay Gould, and William Orton succeeded to the presidency of Western Union. Jeptha was nominated by the Democratic Party for Representative of Ohio&#x27;s 18th congressional district in 1864, but lost. He was an incorporator of the Cleveland Rolling Mill Company and the Citizens Savings and Loan Association (becoming its first president), became president of National Bank of Commerce, and served on the board of directors of eight railroads.

Wade used his vast wealth to benefit the city of Cleveland. In 1882, he donated of land east of the city for the purpose of creating Wade Park, which was named in his honor. Wade Park is Cleveland&#x27;s cultural center surrounded by the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, the Western Reserve Historical Society and the Cleveland Botanical Garden.

Wade also was heavily involved with the establishment of Hathaway Brown School, a private academy for young girls and women. He also co-founded the Case School of Applied Technology, which later became part of Case Western Reserve University. In addition, Wade served as the first President of the Board of Trustees for Lake View Cemetery on Cleveland&#x27;s east side.

==Personal life ==
Wade married Rebecca Louiza Facer in 1832, who bore his first son, Randall Palmer Wade, later that year. Rebecca Wade died November 30, 1836, at the age of 24.

He remarried in 1837 to Susan Maranda Fleming, with whom he adopted 4 more children. All are buried in Lake View Cemetery, Cleveland.

==Legacy==
Wade&#x27;s grandchildren included Jeptha Homer Wade II (1857–1926), son of Randall Palmer Wade and Anna Rebecca McGaw Wade. He worked in the banking industry, railway business, mining industry, and manufacturing after graduating from Mt. Pleasant Military Academy in Ossining, New York, and Western Reserve University. He owned the USS Wadena (SP-158). He established the family&#x27;s Mill Pond Plantation in Thomasville, Georgia, in 1906 (later divided by the family to include the Arcadia Plantation). He bequeathed to the Cleveland Museum of Natural History a large gem collection that is now part of the Jeptha Homer Wade II Gallery of Gems and Jewels. Jeptha H. Wade II was also a founder of the Cleveland Museum of Art, which houses two paintings by Jeptha Wade I. 

A grandchild of Jeptha Homer Wade II was Jeptha Homer Wade III (December 26, 1924 – August 8, 2008), son of George Garretson and Irene Love Wade, who was a prominent Boston attorney assisting in the formation of the federal Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, and served in the American Field Service beginning in 1944. He graduated from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1946 and Harvard Law School in 1950. He volunteered as an assistant to retired Secretary of the Army John McCloy in the formation of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency under the Kennedy Administration before returning to Choate, Hall &amp; Stewart in 1961. He was an advocate for nuclear arms control, president of the Lawyers Alliance for Nuclear Arms Control (later known as LAWS, Lawyers for World Security). He married Emily Vanderbilt, daughter of William Henry Vanderbilt III, who in 2015 added to the family&#x27;s land holdings in Thomasville, Georgia, by purchasing roughly of the Greenwood Plantation. The large tract of old-growth forest will be conserved for research on the ecology of longleaf yellow pine forests. Jeptha Wade has many living descendants.

<doc id="1308723" wikidata="Q96418788" url="?curid=1308723" title="Leader of the Scottish National Party">
<text>The leader of the Scottish National Party is the highest position within Scotland&#x27;s Scottish National Party (SNP). The incumbent is John Swinney, who was elected unopposed in the 2024 leadership election on 6 May 2024, succeeding Humza Yousaf as party leader.

Scotland has had a devolved government since 1999. When the SNP is Scotland&#x27;s major governing party, as it currently is, its leader has also been the First Minister of Scotland.

== History ==
The post was officially created on 7 April 1934 with the foundation of the SNP. The role was titled Chairman of the Scottish National Party from 1934 until 1969, with the first chairman, Alexander MacEwen, appointed to the office in 1934. In 1969 the title of chairman was replaced with that of National Convener, with William Wolfe the first person elected as National Convener. The post gained its current title of &quot;Leader&quot; at the SNP spring conference on 24 April 2004.

While Gordon Wilson had the longest uninterrupted spell as leader, lasting just over eleven years from 1979 to 1990, Alex Salmond has been the party&#x27;s longest-serving leader overall, serving twenty years and two months across two spells as leader.

== Other party leadership ==
Keith Brown is the depute leader of the party; however, he is not the Deputy First Minister of Scotland.

Stephen Flynn is the Leader of the party&#x27;s House of Commons delegation, with Mhairi Black as deputy leader.

<text>Books to Prisoners is an umbrella term for organizations that mail free reading material to prison inmates. 

==Background==

The first Books to Prisoners projects were founded in the early 1970s. These included Seattle&#x27;s Books to Prisoners, Boston&#x27;s Prison Book Program, and the Prison Library Project which was founded in Durham, North Carolina but relocated to Claremont, California in 1986. Since then, dozens of prison book programs have been established, although many have had short life-spans. Currently there are more than fifty similar projects in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The groups communicate about common issues and solutions through a listserv created in 2006 and have held national and regional conferences, including a 2003 conference in Philadelphia, PA, a 2007 conference in Urbana-Champaign, IL, and a 2019 conference in Boston, MA. In keeping with the anarchist cultural roots of the concept, each group is autonomous though they frequently collaborate on common challenges, especially prison book restrictions and book bans. 

Books to Prisoners programs have a diverse range of political affiliations. Many groups identify as anarchist or abolitionist. Others are nonpolitical and simply promote education and literacy. Some are religious. Some groups serve specific populations and focus on gender, sexuality, or race.

Books to prisoners programs generally accept donations of books from publishers, bookstores, and individuals. During the COVID-19 pandemic, when processing donated books was impractical, many groups launched wish lists at independent bookstores where supporters could buy in-demand books which were later sent to prisoners. Each project solicits book requests from incarcerated people, usually by genre or by naming a preferred author. Often-requested materials include dictionaries, how-to books, educational books, and historical works, especially those focusing on African-American, Latino, and Native American history. Project volunteers or workers fill the requests by sending a few books taken from the project&#x27;s library. There is no cost to book recipients.

Generally, volunteers answer letters, mail packages, and complete administrative work. Many of the projects are affiliated with a local independent bookstore in their home city, which provides a drop-off location for donations and sometimes a small supply of books as well. 

Prison book groups continuously struggle to fulfill their mission in the face of prison book bans, which constitute the largest area of book censorship in the United States. In 2018, Mississippi-based prison book group Big House Books sued the Mississippi Department of Corrections over an all-encompassing ban on non-religious books; the lawsuit was dropped after the Department of Corrections agreed to allow Big House Books to continue sending free books to Mississippi prisons. Also in 2018, the state of New York issued Directive 4911A in an attempt to restrict the books available to prisoners at three of its prisons; after public outcry and media attention, garnered in part through the efforts of New York City-based prison book group Books Through Bars, the directive was rescinded. In 2019, the Washington Department of Corrections banned the shipment of used books directly to prisoners. After facing public criticism and pushback from Seattle Books to Prisoners, the Washington DOC partially backed down and allowed shipments from four BTP programs to continue. 

== List of Books to Prisoners organizations ==

<doc id="1308730" wikidata="Q4780971" url="?curid=1308730" title="Appeal procedure before the European Patent Office">
<text>The European Patent Convention (EPC), the multilateral treaty instituting the legal system according to which European patents are granted, contains provisions allowing a party to appeal a decision issued by a first instance department of the European Patent Office (EPO). For instance, a decision of an Examining Division refusing to grant a European patent application may be appealed by the applicant. The appeal procedure before the European Patent Office is under the responsibility of its Boards of Appeal, which are institutionally independent within the EPO.

== Overview ==
Decisions of the first instance departments of the European Patent Office (EPO) can be appealed, i.e. challenged, before the Boards of Appeal of the EPO, in a judicial procedure (proper to an administrative court), as opposed to an administrative procedure. These boards act as the final instances in the granting and opposition procedures before the EPO. The Boards of Appeal have been recognised as courts, or tribunals, of an international organisation, the EPO.

The Boards of Appeal of the EPO, including the Enlarged Board of Appeal, were until 2017 based at the headquarters of the EPO in Munich, Germany. In October 2017, the Boards of Appeal moved to Haar, a municipality located 12 km east of Munich&#x27;s city centre. In contrast to the Boards of Appeal, the Examining Divisions and Opposition Divisions, i.e. the first instance departments carrying the examination of patent applications and of oppositions to granted European patents, are not all based in a single location; those may be in Munich, in Rijswijk (a suburb of The Hague, Netherlands), or in Berlin, Germany.

===Enlarged Board of Appeal===
In addition to the Boards of Appeal (i.e., the Technical Boards of Appeal and the Legal Board of Appeal), the European Patent Office also has an &quot;Enlarged Board of Appeal&quot; (sometimes abbreviated &quot;EBoA&quot; or &quot;EBA&quot;). The Enlarged Board of Appeal does not constitute an additional level of jurisdiction in the classical sense. It is fundamentally a legal instance in charge of deciding on points of law, and has the four following functions.

The first two functions of the Enlarged Board of Appeal are to make decisions or to issue opinions when the case law of the Boards of Appeal becomes inconsistent or when an important point of law arises, either upon a referral from a Board of Appeal (first function of the Enlarged Board of Appeal), in which case the Enlarged Board issues a decision, or upon a referral from the President of the EPO (second function of the Enlarged Board of Appeal), in which case the Enlarged Board issues an opinion. Its purpose is to ensure uniform application of the European Patent Convention and to clarify or interpret important points of law in relation to the European Patent Convention. When fulfilling these two functions, the Enlarged Board of Appeal is composed of seven members, five legally qualified members and two technical members. The referral of a question of law by a Board of Appeal to the Enlarged Board of Appeal is fairly similar to a referral by a national court to the European Court of Justice. 

The third function of the Enlarged Board of Appeal is to examine petitions for review of decisions of the Boards of Appeal. The third function is relatively recent. It is indeed only since December 2007 and the entry into force of the EPC 2000, the revised European Patent Convention, that a petition for review of a decision of a Board may be filed, albeit on limited grounds.

The fourth function is to propose the removal from office of a member of the boards of appeal. Under Article 23(1) EPC, a member of the Enlarged Board or of a Board of Appeal may not be removed from office during the five-year term of appointment, other than on serious grounds and if the &quot;Administrative Council, on a proposal from the Enlarged Board of Appeal, takes a decision to this effect.&quot; The Enlarged Board has been requested on three occasions to propose the removal from office of the same Board member, but did so in none of these cases.

===Organisational structure, and supervision===
The Boards of Appeal, the Enlarged Board of Appeal, as well as their registries and support services, form a separate unit within the European Patent Office, the so-called &quot;Boards of Appeal Unit&quot;. It is directed by the President of the Boards of Appeal, a position held as of 2018 by former Swedish Judge Carl Josefsson. The President of the Boards of Appeal is also the chairperson of the Enlarged Board of Appeal. The &quot;Presidium of the Boards of Appeal&quot; is the autonomous authority within the Boards of Appeal Unit, and consists of the President of the Boards of Appeal and twelve members of the Boards of Appeal, elected by their peers. 

Furthermore, a &quot;Boards of Appeal Committee&quot; has been set up by the Administrative Council of the European Patent Organisation to adopt the Rules of Procedure of the Boards of Appeal (and of the Enlarged Board of Appeal), and to assist the Administrative Council in supervising the Boards of Appeal. The Boards of Appeal Committee consists of six members, three of whom are members of the Administrative Council itself (i.e. representatives of the Contracting States within the meaning of ) and the remaining three are &quot;serving or former judges of international or European courts or of national courts of the Contracting States&quot;.

The current organisational and managerial structure of the Boards of Appeal resulted from a reform undertaken by the Administrative Council as a reaction to Enlarged Board of Appeal decision R 19/12 of 25 April 2014. The reform was undertaken by the Administrative Council &quot;within the existing framework of the European Patent Convention, without requiring its revision.&quot;

== Procedure ==
An appeal may be filed against a decision of a first instance department of the EPO, i.e. a decision of the Receiving Section, of an Examining Division, of an Opposition Division or of the Legal Division. The Boards of Appeal are not competent, however, to review decisions taken by the EPO acting as international authority under the Patent Cooperation Treaty. Most appeals are filed (i.e., lodged) against decisions of Examining Divisions and Opposition Divisions, with a relatively small number of cases being appeals against decisions of the Receiving Section and Legal Division. An appeal has a suspensive effect, which means that, for example, &quot;[i]n the case of a refusal of an application, the filing of an appeal will have the effect of suspending the effect of the order refusing the application&quot;. The provisions applicable to the first instance proceedings from which the appeal derives also apply during appeal proceedings, &quot;[u]nless otherwise provided.&quot;

=== Possible interlocutory revision in &quot;ex parte&quot; proceedings ===
If an appeal is lodged against a decision in &quot;ex parte&quot; proceedings (i.e., proceedings where the appellant is not opposed to another party) and if the first instance department that took the decision regards the appeal to be admissible and well founded, it has to rectify its decision.&lt;ref name=&quot;G3/03-2.s1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This is called an &quot;interlocutory revision&quot;, which is said to be a rather unusual procedure within the EPO. Nonetheless, this is a very useful procedure, for procedural expediency and economy, for example if amendments are filed with the appeal, which clearly overcome the objections in the first instance decision. If the appeal is not allowed by the first instance department within three months of receipt of the statement of grounds, the first instance department has to transfer the case to the Board of Appeal without delay, and without comment as to its merit.&lt;ref name=&quot;G3/03-2.s2&quot;&gt;G 3/03, Reasons 2, second sentence.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the event of an interlocutory revision, the appeal fee is reimbursed in full &quot;if such reimbursement is equitable by reason of a substantial procedural violation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;G3/03-3.s1&quot;&gt;G 3/03, Reasons 3, first sentence.&lt;/ref&gt; Whether the appeal fee is to be reimbursed in the event of an interlocutory revision must be examined &quot;regardless of whether or not the appellant has actually submitted&quot; a request for reimbursement of the appeal fee.&lt;ref name=&quot;G3/03-3.s2&quot;&gt;G 3/03, Reasons 3, second sentence.&lt;/ref&gt; If the first instance department decides to grant the interlocutory revision but not a request of the appellant for reimbursement of the appeal fee, the first instance department has to remit &quot;the request of the appellant for reimbursement of the appeal fee to a board of appeal&quot;. In other words, in such a case, the first instance department &quot;is not competent to refuse a request of the appellant for reimbursement of the appeal fee.&quot; Instead, a Board is competent to decide on the request.

=== Examination of the admissibility of the appeal===
For an appeal to be admissible, amongst other requirements, notice of appeal must be filed at the EPO within two months of notification of the contested decision, and the fee for appeal must be paid. In addition, within four months of notification of the decision, a statement setting out the grounds of appeal (i.e., the appeal grounds) must be filed, which shall contain the appellant&#x27;s complete case. The appellant must also be adversely affected by the appealed decision. A party is only adversely affected by an appealed decision if the order of the appealed decision does not comply with its request (i.e., what the party requested during the first instance proceedings). For instance, when &quot;the order of the decision of the opposition division is the revocation of the patent, an opponent who requested revocation of the patent in its entirety is not &quot;adversely affected by&quot; said decision... irrespective of the reasons given in the decision.&quot;

The admissibility of an appeal may be assessed at every stage of the appeal proceedings. Furthermore, the requirements for admissibility must not only be satisfied when lodging the appeal, they must be sustained throughout the duration of the appeal proceedings.

=== Examination of the merits of the appeal ===
If the appeal is found to be admissible, the Board of Appeal examines whether the appeal is allowable, i.e. the Board addresses the merits of the case. When doing so, &quot;the boards have competence to review appealed decisions in full, including points of law and fact&quot;. 

In that context, if the first instance department exercised its discretion (pursuant to ) to admit facts or evidence which were not submitted in due time by a party, the Board &quot;should only overrule such a decision, if it concludes that the department that took it applied the wrong principles, took no account of the right principles, or exercised its discretion in an unreasonable way, thus exceeding the proper limits of its discretion&quot;.

=== Optional remittal ===
After examining the allowability of an appeal, a Board has the discretion to either &quot;exercise any power within the competence of the department which was responsible for the decision appealed&quot; (correction of a decision) or &quot;remit the case to that department for further prosecution&quot; (cassation of a decision). When a board remits a case to the first instance, it does so notably to give the parties the possibility of defending their case before two instances, i.e. at two levels of jurisdiction, although there is no absolute right to have an issue decided upon by two instances. The boards generally take into account as well the need for procedural efficiency when deciding whether to remit a case to the first instance and &quot;the general interest that proceedings are brought to a close within an appropriate period of time&quot;.

=== Accelerated processing ===
Appeal proceedings conducted at the EPO may be accelerated &quot;by giving a case priority over others&quot;. A party to the proceedings may request accelerated processing of the appeal proceedings. The request must be reasoned. The Board has the discretion to grant or refuse the request. Courts, competent authorities of the contracting states, and the Unified Patent Court (UPC) may also request acceleration of proceedings relating to a specific patent, without providing a specific reason. The Board may also decide to accelerate the proceedings of its own motion.

=== Oral proceedings ===
During appeal proceedings, oral proceedings may take place at the request of the EPO or at the request of any party to the proceedings, i.e. the applicant (who is, in pre-grant appeal, the appellant), or the patentee or an opponent (who are, in opposition appeal, appellant and/or respondent). The oral proceedings in appeal are held in Haar or Munich, and are public unless very particular circumstances apply. This contrasts with oral proceedings held before an Examining Division, which are not public. The list of public oral proceedings in appeal is available on the EPO web site. The right to oral proceedings is a specific and codified part of the procedural right to be heard. Oral proceedings may also be held by videoconference. 

To prepare the oral proceedings, the Board shall &quot;issue a communication drawing attention to matters that seem to be of particular significance for the decision to be taken&quot;. Together with such a communication, &quot;[t]he Board may also provide a preliminary opinion&quot; on the merits of the case. A decision may be, and often is, announced at the end of the oral proceedings, since the purpose of oral proceedings is to come to a conclusion on a case.

=== Substantial procedural violation and reimbursement of the appeal fee ===
The EPC provides that, if the Board of Appeal finds out that a substantial procedural violation took place during the first instance proceedings and if the Board considers the appeal to be allowable, the appeal fee shall be reimbursed if such reimbursement is equitable.

A substantial procedural violation may for instance occur during the first instance proceedings if the right of the parties to be heard were violated () or if the first instance decision was not properly reasoned (). To be properly reasoned, &quot;a decision must contain, in logical sequence, those arguments which justify its order&quot; &quot;so as to enable the parties and, in case of an appeal, the board of appeal to examine whether the decision was justified or not&quot;.

More generally, a substantial procedural violation is &quot;an objective deficiency affecting the entire proceedings&quot;. The expression &quot;substantial procedural violation&quot; is to be understood, in principle, as meaning &quot;that the rules of procedure have not been applied in the manner prescribed by the [European Patent] Convention.&quot;

=== Full or partial reimbursement of the appeal fee upon withdrawal of the appeal ===
The appeal fee is reimbursed in full &quot;if the appeal is withdrawn before the filing of the statement of grounds of appeal and before the period for filing that statement has expired.&quot; Besides, the appeal fee is partially reimbursed, at a rate of 75%, 50%, or 25%, if the appeal is withdrawn at certain stages of the appeal proceedings. The withdrawal of an appeal must be explicit and unambiguous.

== Binding character of decisions ==
The legal system established under the EPC differs from a common law legal system in that &quot;[it] does not treat (...) established jurisprudence as binding.&quot; Under the EPC, there is no principle of binding case law.&lt;ref name=&quot;T 1099/06&quot;&gt;T 1099/06, Reasons 1.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the binding effect of board of appeal decisions is extremely limited.

A decision of a Board of Appeal is only binding on to the department whose decision was appealed, insofar as the facts are the same (if the case is remitted to the first instance of course). However, &quot;[if] the decision which was appealed emanated from the Receiving Section, the Examining Division shall similarly be bound by the ratio decidendi of the Board of Appeal.&quot; However, if &quot;a Board consider[s] it necessary to deviate from an interpretation or explanation of the [EPC] given in an earlier decision of any Board, the grounds for this deviation shall be given, unless such grounds are in accordance with an earlier decision or opinion of the Enlarged Board of Appeal (...).&quot;

A decision of the Enlarged Board of Appeal (pursuant to ) is only binding on the Board of Appeal in respect of the appeal in question, i.e. on the Board of Appeal that referred the question to the Enlarged Board of Appeal. Furthermore, in the event that a Board considers it necessary to deviate from an opinion or decision of the Enlarged Board of Appeal, a question must be referred to the Enlarged Board of Appeal.

Outside the European Patent Office, the decisions of the Boards of Appeal are not strictly binding on national courts, but they certainly have a persuasive authority.

===Correction of a Board&#x27;s decision under Rule 140 EPC===
Under , &quot;only linguistic errors, errors of transcription and obvious mistakes may be corrected&quot; in decisions of the EPO. This possibility to correct a decision is also available for decisions of the EPO Boards of Appeal.

== Independence of the members of the Boards of Appeal ==
The members of the Boards of Appeal and of the Enlarged Board of Appeal are appointed by the Administrative Council of the European Patent Organisation on a proposal from the President of the European Patent Office. Moreover, during their five-year term, the Board members may only be removed from office under exceptional circumstances.

According to Sir Robin Jacob, the members of the Boards of Appeal are &quot;judges in all but name&quot;. They are only bound by the European Patent Convention. They are not bound by any instructions, such as the &quot;Guidelines for Examination in the European Patent Office&quot;. They have a duty of independence.

However, since &quot;the [appeal] boards&#x27; administrative and organisational attachment to the EPO which is an administrative authority obscures their judicial nature and is not fully commensurate with their function as a judicial body&quot;, there have been calls for creating, within the European Patent Organisation, a third judicial body alongside the Administrative Council and the European Patent Office. This third judicial body would replace the present Boards of Appeal and could be called the &quot;&quot;Court of Appeals of the European Patent Organisation&quot; or the &quot;European Court of Patent Appeals&quot;&quot;. This third body would have its own budget, would have its seat in Munich, Germany and would be supervised &quot;without prejudice to its judicial independence&quot; by the Administrative Council of the EPO. The EPO has also proposed that the members of the Boards of Appeal should be appointed for lifetime, &quot;with grounds for termination exhaustively regulated in the EPC&quot;. These changes would however need to be approved by a new Diplomatic Conference.

According to some experts, the calls to improve the institutional independence of the Boards of Appeal have not received so far the appropriate consideration by the Administrative Council of the European Patent Organisation. Echoing these concerns, the Enlarged Board of Appeal in its decision R 19/12 regarded an objection of partiality against the Vice-President DG3 (Directorate-General Appeals) as justified on the grounds that he was acting both as chairman of the Enlarged Board of Appeal and as a member of the Management Committee of the EPO. The decision shows the persistent disquietude caused by the integration of the Boards of Appeal into the European Patent Office. This question, namely the question of the independence of the Boards of Appeal, was also raised by Spain &quot;against the Regulations on the unitary patent&quot; in cases C-146/13 and C-147/13.

== Case references ==
Each decision of the Boards of Appeal and the Enlarged Board of Appeal, as well as each opinion of the Enlarged Board of Appeal, has an alphanumeric reference, such as decision &quot;T 285/93&quot;. The first letter (or the text &quot;Art 23&quot;) of the reference indicates the type of board which took the decision:
*&quot;G&quot; – Enlarged Board of Appeal (decisions and opinions under )
*&quot;R&quot; – Enlarged Board of Appeal (petitions for review under )
*&quot;T&quot; – Technical Board of Appeal
*&quot;J&quot; – Legal Board of Appeal
*&quot;D&quot; – Disciplinary Board of Appeal
*&quot;W&quot; – Decision concerning PCT reserves under or 
*&quot;Art. 23&quot; – Enlarged Board of Appeal (proposals to the Administrative Council under for removal from office of a member of the Boards of Appeal)
The number before the oblique is the serial number, allocated by chronological order of receipt at the DG3, the Directorate General 3 (Appeals) of the European Patent Office. The last two digits give the year of receipt of the appeal in DG3. The letter &quot;V&quot; is sometimes used to refer to a decision of an Examining or Opposition Division.

In addition to their alphanumeric reference, decisions are sometimes referred to and identified by their date to distinguish between decisions regarding the same case issued at a different date (e.g. T 843/91 of 17 March 1993 and T 843/91 of 5 August 1993 , T 59/87 of 26 April 1988 and T 59/87 of 14 August 1990 or T 261/88 of 28 March 1991 and T 261/88 of 16 February 1993 ).

<doc id="1308769" wikidata="Q16059" url="?curid=1308769" title="Cloppenburg">
<text>Cloppenburg (; ; ) is a town in Lower Saxony, in north-western Germany, capital of Cloppenburg District and part of Oldenburg Münsterland. It lies 38 km south-south-west of Oldenburg in the Weser-Ems region between Bremen and the Dutch border. Cloppenburg is not far from the A1, the major motorway connecting the Ruhr area to Bremen and Hamburg. Another major road is the federal highway B213 being the shortest link from the Netherlands to the A1 and thus to Bremen and Hamburg.

==History==

Under Nazi Germany, it was the location of a forced labour subcamp of the prison in Vechta and a camp for Sinti and Romani people (see &quot;Romani Holocaust&quot;).

The town had strong cultural links with St Munchins Parish in Limerick, Ireland from the 1970s to the 1990s. During this period many groups of teens/young adults from both areas visited and were hosted by families from the other area. 

==Economy==

The town is a centre for the largely agricultural region of southern Oldenburg. It is the administrative centre of the district and there are many schools.

However, there is also some industry in town: e.g. Lumberg, (connector systems) and Derby Cycle (bikes).

==Tourism==

One of Cloppenburg&#x27;s main tourist attractions is the Cloppenburg Museum Village, an open-air museum containing a collection of old buildings from the region that were dismantled and reassembled in the museum.

<doc id="1308784" wikidata="Q2355409" url="?curid=1308784" title="Street team">
<text>A street team is a term used in marketing to describe a group of people who engage with urban or campus communities to promote events. They are particularly prevalent in the music industry, which uses street teams for grassroots marketing and to promote awareness for artists and bands.

==History==
The now ubiquitous &quot;street team&quot; model was originally developed by urban record labels, such as: Loud Records, Jive, Bad Boy Records, Roc-A-Fella Records, Priority Records, and Ruthless Records. Rap labels found it affordable and highly effective bridge to their target audience that did not require the traditional outlets found in print, radio, television mediums and elusive large scale record distribution deals. One of the first independent rock bands to introduce a version of the street team was Chicago folk-rockers the Drovers, who launched a &quot;campus rep&quot; initiative in 1991 for the college rock club circuit, copying practices used by the Mondale presidential campaign to activate registration and turnout at universities. 

This grassroots tactic was partly born in the mid-1990s from the larger monopolistic record distributors trying to shut out rap and smaller music labels of the day from radio and mass distribution due to the early stigma of gangsta rap and &quot;punk&quot; on those genres as a whole.

Street Teams were used by smaller independent record labels as a tool to circumvent the larger out-of-reach distributors and corporate owned record labels. Other independent label owners used street teams as a way to build equity in their stable of artists for the benefit of gaining a courtship by a larger music label or record distributor to merge or sell part or all of the company. (see Loud Records sale late 1990s)

For the smaller labels trying to get in the door of the music business, the thinking was in part to build a loyal fan base in key markets first, getting a strong street hype and &quot;street-cred,&quot; getting on the local radio stations through the hype/word-of-mouth, and moving on to the larger record distributors with a much stronger negotiating hand and a solid &quot;sellable&quot; commodity.

Through this method of building a solid fan base with disposable income first, the smaller label could wield greater power in their initial distribution negotiations for the benefit of their recording artists and their profit margins. Often, distribution deals for an &quot;unproven&quot; new artist(s) who comes with a built-in fan base, generally receive better upfront money deals than music artists had previously received without street teams sharing the music and spreading the word, (viral marketing) nationwide.

===Street teamers===
The position of street team representative was often filled by fans of an artist or young people looking for an introductory position in the music industry. In many cases, an influential teen referred to as a neighborhood &quot;tastemaker&quot; was sought out or pinpointed by a record label to be used as a conduit to their respective neighborhood, due to their stronger influence over other teens that looked to them for &quot;what&#x27;s hot&quot; or &quot;what&#x27;s the next hot thing&quot;. The tastemaker was directed to create a team on the streets to make an unsigned music artist more popular through word-of-mouth and hype.

The concept for organized promotion teams in the music business can also be traced back to mid-1970s, when Starkey and Evans, two teenage Kiss fans from Terre Haute, Indiana created the Kiss Army as a group of fans determined to promote the Kiss name. Although this could be more attributed to fan clubs, fans worked together outside of their homes, to promote Kiss to other kids at school or while hanging out. This Kiss army was quickly taken over by the band Kiss itself and army recruits were offered limited edition merchandise and seating.

Usually unpaid, street teams for bands and artists are still often composed of teenagers who are rewarded with free band merchandise or show access in exchange for a variety of actions:

* placing stickers and posters in their communities
* bringing friends to the shows
* convincing friends to buy band merchandise
* phoning the local radio stations to request their songs for airplays &amp; voting in the charts
* bringing vinyl and CDs to local DJs in the clubs where they work
* posting to band internet forums online

In some cases, points are assigned to an individual for a particular action, and those points can be exchanged for tickets to shows, or for band merchandise. Some bands even produce special items just for street team members.

<doc id="1308799" wikidata="Q634582" url="?curid=1308799" title="Repossessed (film)">
<text>Repossessed is a 1990 American comedy horror film that parodies the 1973 horror film, &quot;The Exorcist&quot;. It was written and directed by Bob Logan. The film features the original star of &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, Linda Blair, as well as Leslie Nielsen and Anthony Starke. Many gags parodied events in &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, such as the green-vomit and head-spinning scenes, and real-life events such as the televangelist scandals of the 1980s.

==Plot==
In 1973, Father Jedediah Mayii casts out the devil from the body of young Nancy Aglet. In 1990, Nancy&#x27;s body is possessed once again, while watching &quot;The Ernest and Fanny Miracle Hour&quot;, a prosperity gospel broadcast by two hucksters.

After a visit to the hospital, and a visit from Father Luke Brophy, Brophy concludes that Nancy is indeed possessed. Mayii, however, refuses to perform the exorcism, claiming he is too weak, and that both he and Nancy barely survived her previous exorcism. Brophy visits the Supreme Council for Exorcism Granting. Ernest and Fanny of &quot;The Ernest and Fanny Miracle Hour&quot; are also present. Ernest concludes that an exorcism is warranted, and convinces the council to televise Nancy&#x27;s exorcism. They agree, believing it will convert millions, so Ernest presents &quot;Ernest and Fanny&#x27;s Exorcism Tonight&quot; to the network.

Feeling he may be needed, Mayii visits &quot;Bods-R-Us&quot;, a gymnasium, to restore his physical strength. There, Brophy approaches him, informs him of the televised exorcism, and attempts once more to convince Mayii to conduct the exorcism. He refuses again.

After a montage of attempts to free Nancy&#x27;s body using phone donations, song, and insults, &quot;Ernest and Fanny&#x27;s Exorcism Tonight&quot; is announced as having the largest audience in history. Upon hearing this, the devil, in Nancy&#x27;s body, sets the studio on fire, causing the audience to flee. He reveals to Ernest and Fanny that he used them to get the largest audience, and turns them into a pantomime horse.

Using the camera, the devil tries to claim the souls of the viewing audience, but is stopped by Brophy, who destroys the camera. The devil announces he knows another way to claim their souls, and runs away, heading for a satellite transmitter. He is pursued by religious figures from around the world, who have gathered at Brophy&#x27;s command. Brophy teases the devil about his earlier defeat by Mayii.

Back in the studio, the devil uses the camera to lure Mayii to him for a rematch. The exorcism, with commentary by &quot;Mean Gene&quot; Okerlund and Jesse &quot;The Body&quot; Ventura, is ineffective until the devil mentions that he hates rock &#x27;n roll. Turning the TV studio into a live concert, the song &quot;Devil with a Blue Dress On&quot; is played to the devil by the various religious figures, including The Pope on guitars. The devil is tormented so much that he is finally driven from Nancy&#x27;s body for good.

==Cast==
*Linda Blair as Nancy Aglet
*Ned Beatty as Ernest Weller 
*Leslie Nielsen as Father Jedediah Mayii 
*Anthony Starke as Father Luke Brophy 
*Lana Schwab as Fanny Ray Weller
*Thom J. Sharp as Braydon Aglet
*Robert Fuller as Dr. Hackett

*Gene Okerlund as himself
*Bob Zany as Studio Tour Guest
*Jake Steinfeld as himself
*Wally George as himself
*Jack LaLanne as himself
*Army Archerd as himself

==Release==
The film received a limited theatrical release in the United States by New Line Cinema in September 1990, one month after the release of &quot;The Exorcist III&quot;.

==Home media==
The film was released on VHS and laserdisc by LIVE Home Video the same year.

In 2003, Artisan Entertainment released the film on DVD. The film was re-released on DVD on April 14, 2009 by Lions Gate Entertainment, in a collection of forgotten films called the &quot;Lost Collection&quot;. The corporation again released the film on DVD on January 4, 2011, in a &quot;4-Film Collection&quot; set along with &quot;My Best Friend Is a Vampire&quot;, &quot;Slaughter High&quot; and &quot;Silent Night, Deadly Night 3: Better Watch Out!&quot;

==Reception==
One review came from Mick Martin and Marsha Porter&#x27;s &quot;DVD and Video Guide&quot;, where they called it an &quot;uproarious parody&quot; and praising Nielsen&#x27;s performance.

The film otherwise received largely negative reviews on the few theatrical releases it had and on its video release. Craig MacInnes of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; called the film a &quot;fitful locker room farce&quot; that &quot;delights in trotting out a bevy of naked women with pendulous breasts and happily indulges in vicious sexist remarks that seek immunity in the name of parody.&quot; However, he praised Blair&#x27;s performance and the work of the special effects crew, remarking that the latter &quot;actually made Blair look as scary and repugnant and possessed as she did in [&quot;The Exorcist&quot;]. If only she had turned her hell’s-belle fury on-the movie’s hapless writers.&quot; Leonard Maltin gave the film one-and-a-half stars out of four and remarked that it has &quot;too few gags, too many targets, and a poor finale&quot; but noted that &quot;Blair and Nielsen are good.&quot;

&quot;Repossessed&quot; currently has a 13% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, out of eight reviews.

The film won a Razzie Award, the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Original Song, for the song &quot;He&#x27;s Comin&#x27; Back (The Devil!)&quot;.

<text>Eric Goulden (born 18 May 1954), known as Wreckless Eric, is an English rock and new wave singer-songwriter, best known for his 1977 single &quot;Whole Wide World&quot; on Stiff Records. More than two decades after its release, the song was included in &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the best punk rock singles of all time. It was also acclaimed as one of the &quot;top 40 singles of the alternative era 1975–2000&quot;.

== Early life ==
Wreckless Eric was born in Newhaven, East Sussex. He is a cousin of actress Gemma Arterton through her mother. In 1973, he began attending Art School in Hull, where he joined bands such as Dirty Henry that played local clubs. On a break after his first year at school he saw Kilburn and the High Roads in Oldham. Struck by their honest approach to music, Eric decided to employ the same to his composing and performing. His next band, Addis and the Flip Tops, were the first incarnation of what would later be known as the DIY style. He first became known as one of the original members of the late 1970s Stiff Records artist roster, along with Ian Dury, Elvis Costello and Nick Lowe. 

Eric&#x27;s first appearance on record was &quot;Whole Wide World&quot; on the Stiff label sampler &quot;A Bunch of Stiff Records&quot; in April 1977. The single version of that song was finally released in August. The song was produced by, and featured bass and guitar by Nick Lowe, with Steve Goulding on drums. The following month, the song was one of five tracks broadcast for the first of two sessions Eric recorded for DJ John Peel at BBC Radio 1. The song went on to make number 47 in John Peel&#x27;s &#x27;Festive Fifty&#x27;, the so-called &#x27;lost list&#x27; of 1977; it was also number 8 in the &quot;Sounds&quot; critics&#x27; singles of the year. The song&#x27;s reputation has grown over the years and numerous bands have covered &quot;Whole Wide World&quot;, such as the Lightning Seeds, Mental As Anything, The Monkees (on their &quot;Pool It!&quot; album in 1987), The Proclaimers (on their 2007 album &quot;Life with You&quot;), Paul Westerberg, The Bahamas, and Cage The Elephant (on their 2017 album &quot;Unpeeled&quot;).

His debut album &quot;Wreckless Eric&quot; was a Top 50 hit in the UK Albums Chart. His second album with Stiff Records was &quot;The Wonderful World of Wreckless Eric&quot;.

== End of Stiff days ==
Eric became increasingly unhappy with Stiff Records&#x27; business ideas and promotion. The label forced Eric to work with songwriting teams, hired backing bands and assigned his music to unsympathetic producers. By 1980, shortly after the release of &quot;Big Smash!&quot;, he decided to leave Stiff and record music at his home studio. Despite leaving the mainstream music business, he has continued writing songs and performing consistently throughout Europe and the United States. Since the 1980s Eric has released albums on numerous independent record labels.

== Post-Stiff bands ==
Eric&#x27;s post-Stiff bands/projects include: the Captains of Industry, the Len Bright Combo, the Hitsville House Band, with one album &quot;Karaoke&quot; (1997) recorded under his real name, Eric Goulden.

== Post-Stiff albums ==

In 1985, he released &quot;A Roomful of Monkeys&quot; with the Captains of Industry. It was followed in 1986 by a couple of homemade garage albums with &#x27;The Len Bright Combo&#x27;. He always stayed in touch with Ian Dury and the Blockheads – two Blockheads, Norman Watt-Roy and Mick Gallagher, were in the Captains of Industry.

In 1989, he signed to New Rose Records as Eric Goulden, released the homemade &quot;Le Beat Group Electrique&quot; with bassist André Barreau and drummer Catfish Truton. This same year he moved to France, in a quiet countryside corner where he stayed for about ten years. By the time he made this move to the vineyard country, he had already ended his &quot;career of full-time alcoholic&quot;, that he referred to in his autobiography.

Eric toured Eastern Europe in a 1960s Peugeot car, both solo and with his band. In 1990, he released a second Le Beat Group Electrique album, recorded live in a New Rose record shop in Paris, entitled &quot;At the Shop&quot; with Eduardo Leal de la Gala and Fabrice Bertran on the drums. Together they formed the Hitsville House Band.

Eric returned to the UK in 1998, wrote his autobiography &quot;A Dysfunctional Success – The Wreckless Eric Manual&quot; about his life in England in the punk rock years and the music industry, ending at his departure for France. Eric contributed his version of &quot;Clevor Trever&quot; &quot;(sic)&quot; to the Ian Dury tribute album &quot;Brand New Boots and Panties&quot; released in 2001. A new album &quot;Bungalow Hi&quot; was home-recorded, produced and released in 2004.

== Later career ==
The soundtrack to the 2002 film &quot;Heartlands&quot; contained &quot;(I&#x27;d Go The) Whole Wide World&quot;.

&quot;(I&#x27;d Go The) Whole Wide World&quot; appears in the 1996 film &quot;Different for Girls&quot;.

In the 2006 film &quot;Stranger Than Fiction&quot;, starring Will Ferrell, Ferrell sings &quot;Whole Wide World&quot; while playing the guitar, until the original Wreckless Eric version takes over.

In 2008, &quot;Wreckless Eric &amp; Amy Rigby&quot; was released. The album had a sound that was described as including &quot;lots of strummed acoustic guitars, insistent and melodic bass lines and atmospherics created by vintage keyboards, synthesizers, processed electric guitars and electronic effects&quot;. They toured to support the album.

Eric joined The Proclaimers onstage at Edinburgh Castle in Scotland, on 19 July 2008, to perform his song, &quot;(I&#x27;d Go the) Whole Wide World&quot; which they covered on their album &quot;Life with You&quot;. Eric and Amy Rigby joined John Wesley Harding onstage at Wiggins Park in Camden, New Jersey, United States, on 25 July 2009, to perform &quot;(I&#x27;d Go the) Whole Wide World&quot;.

In September 2010, Eric and Rigby offered a track for a compilation album, &quot;Daddy Rockin Strong: A Tribute to Nolan Strong &amp; The Diablos&quot;. They recorded a cover of the 1950s doo-wop song &quot;I Want To Be Your Happiness.&quot; The Wind Records, along with Norton Records, released the album.

After some years living in France with his wife and co-performer, singer-songwriter Amy Rigby, Goulden moved with her to the United States in 2011. As of November 2011, they lived in upstate New York, and continued to tour together.

In 2012, Wreckless Eric and Amy Rigby recorded a version of the Bread song &quot;The Guitar Man&quot;, for the fund raising CD &quot;Super Hits of the Seventies&quot;, for the radio station WFMU.

In December 2013, Fire Records re-released both Len Bright Combo records and the band reunited for a one off show at The Lexington in London. In 2014, Fire Records re-released &quot;Le Beat Group Electrique&quot;, &quot;The Donovan of Trash&quot; and &quot;12 O&#x27;Clock Stereo&quot;.

In December 2016, Wreckless Eric appeared in the Mighty Mighty Bosstones Hometown Throwdown at the House of Blues in Boston. He sang &quot;(I&#x27;d Go The) Whole Wide World&quot;.

In April 2018, Wreckless Eric released an album of new songs, &quot;Construction Time &amp; Demolition&quot;, supported with shows in the UK, the US, and Canada.

&quot;(I&#x27;d Go The) Whole Wide World&quot; appears in the eighth episode of the 2019 Amazon TV series &quot;The Widow&quot;.

&quot;In December 2024, Eric supported the Lightning Seeds at the Cambridge and London dates of their 35th Anniversary tour, and collaborated with the band on a cover of his most famous record Whole Wide World&quot;

<doc id="1308814" wikidata="Q219636" url="?curid=1308814" title="Marcel Moore">
<text>Marcel Moore (born Suzanne Alberte Malherbe, 19 July 1892 – 19 February 1972) was a French illustrator, designer, and photographer. She, along with her romantic and creative partner Claude Cahun, was a surrealist writer and photographer.

==Early life==
Moore was born Suzanne Alberte Malherbe in Nantes, France on 19 July 1892, and studied at the Fine Arts Academy in Nantes. In 1909, at age seventeen, Malherbe met fifteen-year-old Lucy Schwob and began a lifelong artistic collaboration. Malherbe&#x27;s widowed mother married Schwob&#x27;s divorced father in 1917. Curator Tirza True Latimer has theorized that this step-sister relationship not only encouraged the young women&#x27;s creative collaborations but also facilitated their romantic relationship. Between 1920 and 1937, they lived in Paris, where they became involved with the surrealism movement and contributed to avant-garde theater activities. They took male pseudonyms: Malherbe became Marcel Moore, and Schwob became Claude Cahun. They remained together until Cahun&#x27;s death in 1954.

==Career==
In her early twenties Moore worked as a graphic designer, producing ornate illustrations influenced by the japonism trend and the Paris fashion scene of the 1910s. Her modern fashion designs were published in the newspaper &quot;Phare de la Loire&quot;, owned by the Schwob family. She also collaborated with the poet Marc-Adolphe Guégan, producing illustrations for two of his books: &quot;L&#x27;Invitation à la fête primitive&quot; (1921) and &quot;Oya-Insula ou l&#x27;Enfant à la conque&quot; (1923).

Moore is best known as Claude Cahun&#x27;s collaborator. Cahun&#x27;s photographic oeuvre, all but forgotten for a few decades, was rediscovered in the 1980s and interpreted as a predecessor of Cindy Sherman&#x27;s theatrical self-portraits. However, recent scholarship suggests that Moore was not only a muse but also had an active hand in the creation of some of Cahun&#x27;s best-known works. In an essay for the 2005–2006 exhibition &quot;Acting Out: Claude Cahun and Marcel Moore&quot; at the Frye Art Museum in Seattle, curator Tirza True Latimer argues that Cahun&#x27;s photographs are not so much &quot;self-portraits&quot; as collaborations with Moore. At times, they photographed each other posing alternately in the same tableau. Moore&#x27;s shadow is visible in some photographs of Cahun, making visible her own role behind the camera.

Moore illustrated Cahun&#x27;s creative writing on several occasions. For Cahun&#x27;s 1919 poetry volume &quot;Vues et visions&quot;, Moore created pen-and-ink illustrations similar to the decorative style of Aubrey Beardsley. Moore was the subject of Cahun&#x27;s dedication, &quot;I dedicate this puerile prose to you, so that the entire book will belong to you and in this way your designs may redeem my text in our eyes.&quot; In 1930 Cahun and Moore published a second book of verses and illustrations called &quot;Aveux non avenus&quot; (translated as &quot;disavowed confessions&quot;). Moore&#x27;s illustrations for this work consist of collaged images assembled from her many photographs of Cahun, dealing with many of the same themes of identity that can be read in Cahun&#x27;s own photography and poetry.

==Activism==
In 1937 Moore and Cahun moved from Paris to Jersey, possibly to escape the increasing anti-Semitism and political upheavals leading up to World War II. They remained on the island of Jersey when German troops invaded in 1940. For several years, the two risked their lives by distributing anti-Nazi propaganda to the German soldiers. Moore was fluent in German, and was able to translate the secret notes and messages that she and Cahun composed into German, in hopes of fooling the occupation troops into believing that there was a conspiracy on the island.  She was often the one to take the most significant risks, slipping her notes into pockets of German soldiers or leaving them in German staff cars. As historian Jeffrey H. Jackson writes in his definitive study of their wartime resistance &quot;Paper Bullets,&quot; for Cahun and Moore, &quot;fighting the German occupation of Jersey was the culmination of lifelong patterns of resistance, which had always borne a political edge in the cause of freedom as they carved out their own rebellious way of living in the world together.  For them, the political was always deeply personal.&quot; Despite having reverted to their original names and introducing themselves as sisters in Jersey, their resistance activities were discovered in 1944, and they were sentenced to death and imprisoned. They were saved by the Liberation of Jersey in 1945, but their home and property had been confiscated and much of their art destroyed by the Germans.

==Later life==
Claude Cahun&#x27;s health suffered during her wartime imprisonment; Cahun died in 1954, after which Moore relocated to a smaller home. Moore died by suicide in 1972. She was buried alongside her partner Cahun in St Brelade&#x27;s Church.

==Legacy==
In 2018, a street of Paris, close to the rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs where Marcel and Claude lived, took the name of &quot;allée Claude Cahun–Marcel Moore&quot; in the 6th district of the French capital.

Rupert Thomson&#x27;s 2018 novel, Never Anyone But You, was based on the lives of Moore and Cahun in Paris and Jersey.

<text>Benjamin Mazar (; born Binyamin Zeev Maisler, June 28, 1906 – September 9, 1995) was a pioneering Israeli historian, recognized as the &quot;dean&quot; of biblical archaeologists. He shared the national passion for the archaeology of Israel that also attracts considerable international interest due to the region&#x27;s biblical links. He is known for his excavations at the most significant biblical site in Israel: south and south west of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. In 1932 he conducted the first archaeological excavation under Jewish auspices in Israel at Beit She&#x27;arim (the largest catacombs ever found in Israel) and in 1948 was the first archaeologist to receive a permit granted by the new State of Israel (Tell Qasile, 1948). Mazar was trained as an Assyriologist and was an expert on biblical history, authoring more than 100 publications on the subject. He developed the field of historical geography of Israel. For decades he served as the chairman of the Israel Exploration Society and of the Archaeological Council of Israel (which he founded as the authority responsible for all archaeological excavations and surveys in Israel). Between 1951 and 1977, Mazar served as Professor of Biblical History and Archaeology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In 1952 he became Rector of the university and later its president for eight years commencing in 1953.

He founded the Hebrew University&#x27;s new campus at Givat Ram and Hadassah Medical School and Hospital at Ein Karem and led the academic development of the university into one of the leading Universities of the World (see Academic Ranking of World Universities). He was regarded by his students as an inspiring teacher and academic leader and many of these students are now considered leading historians and archaeologists in Israel today.

==Biography==
Mazar was born in Ciechanowiec, Poland, then part of the Russian Empire. He was educated at Berlin University and Giessen University in Germany. At the age of 23, he immigrated to Mandatory Palestine and in 1943 joined the faculty of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, whose original campus at Mount Scopus was an enclave in the Jordanian sector of Jerusalem following the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. In 1952 he became Rector of the university and later its president for eight years from 1953 to 1961, following Selig Brodetsky and succeeded by Giulio Racah.

==Archaeological career==

In 1936 Mazar started the excavations of Beth Shearim, the first archaeological excavation organized by a Jewish institution, and uncovered there the large Jewish catacombs dated to the 2nd-4th centuries CE, known as the burial place of the Jewish leader Rabbi Yehudah Hanasi, the compiler of the Mishnah. In 1948 he was the first archaeologist to receive a permit to dig in the new State of Israel, and explored the Philistine town of Tell Qasile in northern Tel Aviv. He later conducted excavations at Ein Gedi and between 1968 and 1978 directed the excavations south and south-west of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, including an area he described as the Ophel, uncovering extensive remains from the Iron Age through the Second Temple period and to Jerusalem&#x27;s Islamic period.

=== Tomb of Himyarites ===

In 1937, Benjamin Mazar revealed at Beit She&#x27;arim a system of tombs belonging to the Jews of Ḥimyar (now southern Yemen) dating back to the 3rd century CE. The strength of ties between Yemenite Jewry and the Land of Israel can be learnt, of course, by the system of tombs at Beit She&#x27;arim dating back to the 3rd century. It is of great significance that Jews from Ḥimyar were being buried in what was then considered a prestigious place, near the tombs of the Sanhedrin. Those who had the financial means brought their dead to be buried in the Land of Israel, as it was considered an outstanding virtue for Jews not to be buried in foreign lands, but rather in the land of their forefathers. It is speculated that the Ḥimyarites, during their lifetime, were known and respected in the eyes of those who dwelt in the Land of Israel, seeing that one of them, whose name was Menaḥem, was coined the epithet &quot;qyl ḥmyr&quot; [prince of Ḥimyar], in the eight-character Ḥimyari ligature, while in the Greek inscription he was called &quot;Menae presbyteros&quot; (Menaḥem, the community&#x27;s elder). The name of a woman in Greek letters, in its genitive form, Ενλογιαζ, was also engraved there, meaning either ‘virtue’, ‘blessing’, or ‘gratis’.

== Mazar family ==
Benjamin Mazar&#x27;s son Ory Mazar, grandchildren Eilat Mazar and Dan Mazar and nephew Amihai Mazar all played an important role in the study and dissemination of Israeli archaeology and historical knowledge. Eilat Mazar was a frequent spokesperson for concerns regarding the archaeology of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem while Amihai Mazar was the recipient of the 2009 Israel Prize for Archaeology. Benjamin Mazar is the brother-in-law of Israel&#x27;s second and only three-term President, Yitzhak Ben Zvi.

== Awards ==
* In 1968, Mazar was awarded the Israel Prize, for Jewish studies.
* Also in 1968, he received the Yakir Yerushalayim (Worthy Citizen of Jerusalem) award.
* In 1986, he was awarded the Harvey Prize by the Technion (Israel Institute of Technology).
