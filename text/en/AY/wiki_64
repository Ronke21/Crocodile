<text>Oaxaca de Juárez (), or simply Oaxaca (Valley Zapotec: &quot;Ndua&quot;), is the capital and largest city of the eponymous Mexican state of Oaxaca. It is the municipal seat for the surrounding municipality of Oaxaca, the most populous municipality in Oaxaca and the fourth most densely populated municipality in Oaxaca, only being less densely populated than San Jacinto Amilpas, Santa Lucía del Camino, and Santa Cruz Amilpas. It is in the Centro District in the Central Valleys region of the state, in the foothills of the Sierra Madre at the base of the Cerro del Fortín, extending to the banks of the Atoyac River. 

Heritage tourism makes up an important part of the city&#x27;s economy, and it has numerous colonial-era structures as well as significant archeological sites and elements of the continuing native Zapotec and Mixtec cultures. The city, together with the nearby archeological site of Monte Albán, was designated in 1987 as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is the site of the month-long cultural festival called the &quot;Guelaguetza&quot;, which features Oaxacan dance from the seven regions, music, and a beauty pageant for indigenous women.

The city is also known as &quot;la Verde Antequera&quot; (the green Antequera) due to its prior Spanish name (&quot;Nueva Antequera&quot;) and the variety of structures built from a native green stone. The name &quot;Oaxaca&quot; is derived from the Nahuatl name for the place, &quot;Huaxyacac&quot;, which was Hispanicized to Guajaca, later spelled Oaxaca. In 1872, &quot;de Juárez&quot; was added in honor of Benito Juárez, a native of this state who became president, serving from 1852 to 1872, and leading the country through challenges, including an invasion by France. The Zapotec name of the city, &quot;Ndua&quot;, is still used in the Zapotec language (Tlacolula Zapotec). The coat of arms for the municipality bears the image of Donají, a Zapotec woman hostage killed and beheaded by the Mixtec in conflict immediately after the Conquest.

==History==
===Early settlements===
The Zapotec and Mixtec peoples had settlements in the valley of Oaxaca for thousands of years, especially in connection with the important ancient centers of Monte Albán and Mitla. The modern city of Oaxaca developed relatively near them. The Aztecs entered the valley in 1440 and named it &quot;Huaxyacac&quot;, a Nahuatl phrase meaning &quot;among the huaje&quot; (Leucaena leucocephala) trees. They created a strategic military position at what is now called the Cerro (large hill) del Fortín to oversee the Zapotec capital of Zaachila and secure the trade route between the Valley of Mexico, Tehuantepec, and what is now Central America.

When the Spanish arrived in 1521, the Zapotec and the Mixtec were involved in one of their many wars. The Spanish conquest ended this fighting, imposing a kind of imperial peace on the area. At the same time, Spanish Catholic missionaries began evangelizing the indigenous peoples, urging them to conversion.

===Colonial period===
The first Spanish expedition to Oaxaca arrived late in 1521, headed by Captain Francisco de Orozco who was accompanied by 400 Aztec warriors. Hernán Cortés sent Francisco de Orozco to Oaxaca because Moctezuma II had said that the Aztecs&#x27; gold came from there. The Spanish expedition under Orozco set about building a Spanish city where the Aztec military post was at the base of the Cerro de Fortín.

The first mass in Oaxaca was given by Chaplain Juan Díaz on the bank of the Atoyac River under a large huaje tree, where the Church of San Juan de Dios would be constructed later. This same chaplain added saints&#x27; names to the surrounding villages, in addition to keeping their Nahuatl names: Santa María Oaxaca, San Martín Mexicapan, San Juan Chapultepec, Santo Tomas Xochimilco, San Matías Jalatlaco, Santiago Tepeaca, etc. This group of Spaniards chose their first mayor, Gutierres de Badajoc, and their first town council, and began construction of the cathedral of Oaxaca in 1522. Their name for the settlement was Guajaca, a Hispanization of the Nahuatl name used by the Aztec (it was later spelled as Oaxaca).

The relatively independent village did not suit Hernán Cortes, who wanted to control power over the entire region. Cortés sent Pedro de Alvarado, who proceeded to drive out most of the village&#x27;s population. The original Spanish settlers appealed to the Spanish crown to recognize the village they founded, which it did in 1526, dividing the land among the Spaniards of Orozco&#x27;s expedition. But three months later, Cortés forced out the population of the village once again and replaced the town council with his own appointees. The original founders appealed again to Spanish royal authority, this time to the viceroy in Mexico City, Nuño de Guzmán. He also sided with the original founders; they reestablished the town in 1529, naming it Antequera, in honor of Nuño de Guzmán&#x27;s hometown. Francisco de Herrera convened the new, Crown-approved town council. Juan Peláez de Berrio platted the new settlement.
In the meantime, Cortés gained from the crown the title of the Marquis of the Valley of Oaxaca, which contains the disputed village. This enabled him to demand high taxes in the area, and to control the territory that surrounded the village. The village had to survive while surrounded by other villages that answered to Cortés. These villages not only did not take orders from Antequera, they were hostile to it, mostly likely encouraged by Cortés.

To counter this, the village petitioned the Crown to be elevated to the status of a city, which would give it certain rights, privileges and exceptions. It would also ensure that the settlement would remain under the direct control of the king, rather than of Cortés. This petition was granted in 1532 by Charles V of Spain.

===Early Mexico===
After the Independence of Mexico in 1821, the city became the seat of a municipality. The name of both the city and the municipality became Oaxaca, changed from Antequera. In 1872, &quot;de Juárez&quot; was added to the city and municipality names to honor Benito Juárez, a native son who had begun his legal and political career here and who served as president of Mexico from 1858 until his death in 1872.

===Modern history===

The 2006 Oaxaca protests developed from state actions in 2005. Oaxaca&#x27;s new state governor Ulises Ruiz Ortiz banned political demonstrations in the capital&#x27;s main square and historic center, or &quot;zócalo&quot;. He acted to make the Zócalo a modernized tourist attraction, turning the state legislature building into a museum. In summer 2005, Oaxaca&#x27;s urban middle classes joined in protests against these decisions.

In May 2006, the national teachers&#x27; union staged their annual occupation of the Zócalo, a union negotiation tactic and local tradition performed every summer since 1989. After a year of protests and growing resistance to the new governor, in 2006 the summer occupation of the square attracted more teachers than usual.

The government announced increases in wages and employment benefits for teachers a short time later. An internal conflict in the local teachers&#x27; union led to accusations that the bargaining had not really been in the teachers&#x27; best interest. On the night of June 14, the state police attacked and tear-gassed the teachers still sleeping in the Zócalo, generating more public outrage against Governor Ruiz and the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party.

Many radical groups merged with the teachers&#x27; union to form the Popular Assembly of the People of Oaxaca (APPO). This assembly defended the rights of several neighborhoods and organizations against government repression, in particular the &quot;caravanas de la muerte&quot; – death squads of government agents patrolling the city in police trucks. The assembly also closed government buildings, barricaded access roads to the city, and replaced the city&#x27;s police force with the Honorable Cuerpo de Topiles, a civilian law force based on indigenous traditions of communal policing.

In October 2006 president Vicente Fox sent in more than 10,000 paramilitaries to take back control of the city. Armed confrontations resulted in many deaths, including that of Indymedia journalists Bradley Roland Will, Roberto López Hernández, and Jorge Alberto Beltrán. In late December, teachers&#x27; union leaders announced an end to their strike. Several leaders of the APPO were arrested. These grassroots groups continued to clash with local and state government, but finally all the barricades were removed and they turned over control of the city.

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
Oaxaca has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Aw&quot;), closely bordering on a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cwa&quot;), due to its high altitude. During the dry season, temperatures during the day remain warm with an average high of in the coolest month, December, and an average high of in April, just before the beginning of the wet season. Although daytime temperatures are warm, nighttime temperatures are cool with an average low of in January. Due to its altitude of , the climate of Oaxaca is cooler than lowland areas at the same latitude. Precipitation is concentrated in the summer months with June being the wettest with an average precipitation of .

==Economy and tourism==

The city is the primary attraction of the state, which also relies economically on tourism. From 1984 to 2009, tourism grew to become the dominant factor in Oaxaca&#x27;s economy. The attractions are the verdant landscapes of the Oaxaca Valley, and the architectural and cultural charms of the city itself. A massive 77% of the municipality of Oaxaca has employment that is related in some way to tourism. The 2006 Oaxaca protests had a severe negative impact on tourism revenue. The next largest economic sectors are mining and manufacturing, which employ 20% of the work force.

The city centre was included in a World Heritage Site designated by UNESCO, in recognition of its treasure of historic buildings and monuments. Tourist activity peaks in three seasons: Holy Week, summer (especially during Guelaguetza) and New Year. Many of the tourists who come during Holy Week and for New Year come from other parts of Mexico and include native Oaxacans returning to visit from their places of work. Most international visitors come during the summer.

==Notable sites==

===Plaza de la Constitución (Zócalo)===

The Plaza de la Constitución, or Zócalo, was planned out in 1529 by Juan Peláez de Berrio. During the entire colonial period this plaza was never paved, nor had sidewalks, only a marble fountain that was placed here in 1739. This was removed in 1857 to put in the bandstand and trees were planted. In 1881, the vegetation here was rearranged and in 1885, a statue of Benito Juárez was added. It was remodeled again in 1901 and a new Art Nouveau bandstand installed. Fountains of green stone with capricious figures were installed in 1967. The bandstand in the center hosts the State Musical Band, La Marimba and other groups.

The plaza is surrounded by various arcades. On the south side of the plaza are the Portales de Ex-Palacio de Gobierno, which was vacated by the government in 2005 and then reopened as a museum called &quot;Museo del Palacio &#x27;Espacio de Diversidad&#x27;&quot; Other arcades include the &quot;Portal de Mercadores&quot; on the eastern side, &quot;Portal de Claverias&quot; on the north side and the &quot;Portal del Señor&quot; on the west side.

The State Government Palace is located on the main square. This site used to be the Portal de la Alhóndiga (warehouse) and in front of the palace is the Benito Juárez Market. The original palace was inaugurated in 1728, on the wedding day of the prince and princess of Spain and Portugal. The architectural style was Gothic. The building currently on this site was begun in 1832, inaugurated in 1870 but was not completed until 1887. The inside contains murals reflecting Oaxaca&#x27;s history from the pre-Hispanic era, the colonial era and post-Independence. Most of these were painted by Arturo García Bustos in the 1980s.

The Federal Palace is located across from the cathedral and used to be the site of the old Archbishiop&#x27;s Palace until 1902. Its architecture is &quot;neo-Mixtec&quot; reflecting the nationalism of the early 20th century and the reverence in which the Mixtec-Zapotec culture has been held in more recent times. The architectural elements copy a number of those from Mitla and Monte Albán.

Northwest of the Zócalo is the Alameda de León, a garden area that is essentially an annex of the main square. In 1576, viceroy Martín Enríquez de Almanza set aside two city blocks on which to build the city government offices, but they were never built here. One of the blocks was sold and the other became a market. Antonio de León, governor of the state of Oaxaca, lived in front of this market and decided to turn it into a park in the 1840s, making it a small replica of the Alameda Central in Mexico City. In 1885, a statue of León was added.
===Andador Macedonio Alcalá===
The Macedonio Alcalá Tourist Corridor is a street paved with green cantera. It was closed to traffic in 1985 and is now only open to pedestrian traffic. Along the street are notable places such as the original building to house the Universidad Autónoma Benito Juárez. The Museo de Arte Contemporáneo (Museum of Contemporary Art) or MACO is located here as is the Plazuela (small plaza) Labastida and the Parroquia de la Preciosa Sangre de Cristo (Parish of the Precious Blood of Christ).

===Churches and religious buildings===

Oaxaca Cathedral, also referred to as Cathedral of Our Lady of the Assumption, is the third to be built as the first two were destroyed by large earthquakes in the 16th and 18th centuries. Construction of this third church began in 1702 and it was consecrated in 1733. Its facade is made of the green cantera stone commonly found in Oaxaca&#x27;s buildings, and the interior is in Neoclassical style. The altar features a bronze statue of Our Lady of the Assumption (Nuestra Señora de al Asunción) sculpted by Tadoini and cast in Italy during the presidency of Porfirio Díaz.
The church and former monastery of Santo Domingo de Guzmán is located 4 blocks north of the cathedral. It was constructed between 1555 and 1666. It is divided into two parts: the church and the former living/working areas of the monks. The front of the church is Renaissance-style, in the central relief, Saint Dominic and Hippolytus of Rome are holding up the church. After La Reforma around 1860, the church was converted into a stable, which caused serious deterioration of the building. It was returned to devotional use at the end of the 19th century. The living and working areas were converted into barracks and officers&#x27; quarters. In 1994, work began to convert this area as the Centro Cultural Santo Domingo.
The Basílica de Nuestra Señora de la Soledad is located four blocks west of the cathedral on Avenida Independencia. It was built between 1682 and 1697 by Father Fernando Méndez on a site where supposedly an image of the Virgin Mary appeared inside a box. It is of Baroque style finished in 1690. Its front is made of a reddish stone sculpted to look like a folding screen. In the back of the church is the Museo de la Basilica de Nuestra Señora de La Soledad that exhibits the Virgin&#x27;s dresses, offering and small painting done in her honor. The statue of the Virgin of Solitude, crowned with a 2 kg solid gold crown studded with diamonds – was recently the subject of a theft. Over the years, the cloister has been converted into a correctional facility, a teacher&#x27;s college and district attorney&#x27;s office. Now it serves as the Municipal Palace. The building conserves a number of valuable items such as paintings, sculptures and religious vestments and a pipe organ dated 1686.

The Church and ex-monastery of Del Carmen Alto belonged to the Carmelites, who established themselves here in 1696. The complex began as a hermitage built over the teocalli of Huaxyacac. The project was financed by Manuel Fernandez Fiallo. In the late 17th century, much of this space was occupied by a jail and barracks.

Church and former monastery of St John of God (Templo y Exconvento de San Juan de Dios), Oaxaca&#x27;s oldest church still standing, completed in 1703. This is where the first mass in Oaxaca was held in 1521.
Church of San Felipe Neri The Church of San Felipe Neri is considered a classic example of Baroque with estipite (inverted truncated pyramid) columns from the end of the 18th century, and has a large gilded main altarpiece. While the church overall is Baroque, the portal contains other decorative elements as well. Benito Juárez married Margarita Maza here in 1841.

Ex monastery of San Catalina was built in the second half of the 16th century by Dominican friar Hernando de Carvarcos, who also was responsible for the Santo Domingo de Guzmán monastery. In 1862, the monastery became a jail and at the end of the 19th century, the southern part became the Municipal Palace. Since 1976, it has been a hotel, called Hotel Camino Real.

Church of the Company of Jesus (Iglesia de la Compañia de Jesús), located to the southwest of the Zócalo, was built by the Jesuits in 1579 and consecrated to Francis Xavier and the Immaculate Conception. The towers were destroyed by a series of earthquakes and never rebuilt. Inside the chapel is a statue of the Virgin of Guadalupe with a prayer written in Spanish, English, Náhuatl as well as 12 other languages native to the state of Oaxaca, including 4 dialects of Zapotec.

===Museums and the arts===

The Centro Cultural de Santo Domingo occupies the former monastery buildings attached to Santo Domingo church, and were restored in 1996 and considered to be one of the best restoration works in Latin America. Some important artifacts from Monte Albán are displayed here. In the center of the Centro Cultural, there is a courtyard with a fountain and a very large staircase. The passages along the courtyard have vaulted ceilings, cupolas and intricate corridors. Much of the Centro Cultural is occupied by the Museo de las Culturas de Oaxaca (Museum of Oaxacan Cultures), whose entrance is the one pilgrims used to use to enter the church area of the complex. This museum was placed in the Centro Cultural in 1964, after originally being in the Instituto de Ciencias y Artes, among other places. The museum specializes in Zapotec and Mixtec cultures, covering ten halls and one auditorium. In Sala III is displayed the &quot;Tesoro Mixteco&quot; (Mixtec Treasure) which is a collection of offerings that were discovered by archeologist Alfonso Caso in Tomb 7 of Monte Álban. These offerings include hundreds of pieces of jewelry made of gold and silver. They make up the richest collection of gold and silver smithing of ancient Mexico. Another important exhibit is the objects from Tomb 5 of Lambitieco, which dates back to 700 C. E and from Monte Albán. The museum has rooms dedicated to everyday items from the colonial period as well. The center also contains the Biblioteca Fray Francisco de Burgoa (Fray Francisco de Burgoa Library) which holds over 25,000 degrees that were conferred from the 15th to the 20th century from the Universidad Autónoma Benito Juárez in Oaxaca.

The Museum of Contemporary Art (Museo de Arte Contemporaneo de Oaxaca, MACO) is housed in the so-called Casa de Cortés. It is one of the oldest buildings in the city and one of the most representative of non-religious buildings. It dates from after the death of Hernán Cortés and could never have served as his house. Although it has been modified somewhat over the years, it still conserves its basic layout with rooms surrounding three courtyards. The architectural style is basically Andalucian modified by Oaxaca traditions. The facade has two levels, and the doors and windows have lintels, and are protected by wrought iron railings. To the far left of the facade, there are two arched entrances that permitted entrance of carriages to the third courtyard. The main portal is Spanish Baroque and has three levels. In the first, there are two &quot;tritóstila&quot; columns that support the balcony which has wrought iron railings. On the second level two Solomonic columns flanking a window. The jambs of the window are decorated with circles and the lintel with inverted curves. At the top of the window is seal of the Jesuits. The third level contains a central niche with a sculpture of an archangel as well as the coats of arms of the Laso de la Vega and the Pinelo families. This group is flanked by Solomonic columns. The house was acquired by the state of Oaxaca and initially housed the Museo Historico Urbano de Oaxaca in 1986. The museum was created with help from the state government, the José F. Gómez Foundation, painter Francisco Toledo and the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes. Its permanent collection contains works by Rufino Tamayo, Toledo, Nieto, Aquinos and others.

The Museo de los Pintores Oaxaqueños(Museum of Oaxacan Painters) is located north of the Alameda de León on Avenida Independencia in a former 18th century mansion. It is dedicated to local artists such as Rodolfo Morales whose work is on permanent display. The museum has also featured exhibitions by Felipe Morales, Rodolfo Nieto, Alejandro Santiago and Francisco Toledo.

The Casa de Culturas Oaxaqueñas used to the Church and ex monastery Los Siete Príncipes dating from the 18th century. The only part still used for religious purposes is the small chapel. The complex was restored in the 1960s and in 1970, the Casa opened. It houses the Instituto Oaxaqueño de la Culturas, which is a state government entity to promote culture and the arts.

The Rufino Tamayo Museum (Museo Arte Prehispánico de Rufino Tamayo) or Museo Rufino Tamayo, has an important collection of pre-Hispanic art that the painter himself collected. He donated the collection, as well as the house that is now the museum to his home state (Oaxaca) in 1974. This house, which was known as the Casa de Villanaza, was built in the 18th century. It first housed the State Museum Archives, before becoming what it is today. The museum exhibits over 1150 pieces from different Mesoamerican periods, including Mayan steles, ceramic dogs from Colima and stone faces from the Gulf of Mexico coast. The purpose of the museum is to show the aesthetic as well as the cultural value of these works.
The Religious Museum of the Ex monastery of La Soledad is located next to the Basilica of la Soledad. It contains objects such as paintings, sculptures and vestments. It is located in the southwest portion of the old monastery.

The Instituto de Artes Gráficos de Oaxaca (Graphic Arts Institute of Oaxaca) contains a large collection of graphic designs both present and past.

The Casa de Juárez, is a museum devoted to the life of Benito Juárez. It belonged to someone named Antonio Salanueva, but Juárez lived here from 1818 to 1828 after arriving from his hometown of Guelatao. It contains documents related to his presidency as well as furnishings designed to recreate the environment of that period. Its architecture is typical of homes built in this city in the 18th century and located on Garcia Vigil 609. It also contains ordinary artifacts from that time period, some of which belonged to Juárez.

Hemeroteca Publica de Oaxaca &quot;Nestor Sánchez&quot; (Nestor Sanchez Public Newspaper Library of Oaxaca) is located behind the ex-convent of Santo Domingo along with the Jardin Ethobotánico (Ethnobotanic Gardin) at the corner of Reforma and Constitución. These two occupy more than 2 hectares which used to be the gardens of the convent of Santa Domingo.
Teatro Macedonio Alcalá is a working theatre and also houses a collection of romantic art. Built between 1903 and 1909, it was originally named the Luis Mier y Terán Theater. The design is typical of the Porfirio Díaz period ending the 19th century and beginning the 20th. It was later renamed the Jesús Carranza Theater. The current name dates back to 1932, honoring the composer of the state anthem &quot;Dios Nunca Muere&quot; (God Never Dies). The theatre has three parts: the vestibule, the main hall and the stage. The main entrance is on the corner. On the Armenta and López Street sides, the lower level is occupied by shops and by the Miguel Cabrera Salon, which hosts art exhibits. The vestibule is Louis XV style with a white marble staircase and the main hall is in &quot;Imperial&quot; style, in which the anthropomorphic columns stand out.

Other cultural places of interest include the Alvarez Bravo Photography Center, the Oaxaca Stamp Museum, the Railway Museum of Southern Mexico (in the old train station) and the Planetarium located on the Cerro del Fortín.

===Monte Albán===
Monte Albán is a pre-Hispanic city that was an ancient capital of the Zapotecs. It reached its peak between 500 BCE and 800 CE with about 35,000 inhabitants. Monte Albán is known for its architecture, its carved stones and its ceramic urns. In 1987, it was declared a World Heritage Site, along with the city of Oaxaca itself.

===Markets===

The Benito Juárez Market is located one block south of the Zócalo on Flores Magón and Las Casas but it takes up the entire block to 20 de Noviembre and Aldama streets. It offers flowers, fruit, ices, fruit drinks, handcrafts, leather goods, hats and knives, among other things. The block to the south houses the Mercado (Market) 20 de Noviembre which is the official name, but this market is commonly known as the &quot;Mercado de la Comida (food)&quot; because of the food stands that dominate the place. It is recommended by &quot;México Desconocido&quot; magazine for Oaxacan regional dishes such as moles, tasajo, tlayudas, pan de yema (a type of egg bread), chapulines (fried grasshoppers in chili), Oaxaca cheese (known locally as &quot;quesillo&quot;), queso fresco (lit. &quot;fresh cheese&quot;), as well as very large cups of hot chocolate made locally that is often spiced with cinnamon and almonds.

===Parks and gardens===

The city contains a number of parks, gardens and plazas, many of which were former monastery lands, for example, the Jardín Etnobotánico de Oaxaca, surrounding the former monastery of Santo Domingo. Even better known is the Plaza de la Danza y Jardín Sócrates complex on Morelos Street at the foot of the Cerro del Fortín. It is part of the area bounded by the Basilica de la Soledad and the Church of San José. The Plaza de la Danza was constructed in 1959 by Eduardo Vasconcelos to hold the annual Bani-Stui-Gulal (representation of antiquity) dance, held one day before the festival of the Guelaguetza. The Plaza also hosts other cultural events including art shows, concerts and political rallies. The Socrates Garden is the old atrium of the Basilica de la Soledad, converted into a public park in 1881. It features a bronze chalice cast in that year. In 1981, the Garden was remodeled, adding a new layer of stone to the floor. The Cerro de Fortín next to it bears in stone letters Benito Juárez&#x27;s slogan, &quot;El respeto al derecho ajeno es la paz&quot; (Respect for others&#x27; rights is peace). The Antonia Labastida Garden is named after a woman who fought with Porfirio Díaz during the French Intervention. This park has become a place for artists and artisans to display their wares.

==Festivals and traditions==

===Guelaguetza===

The Guelaguetza, also known as the Fiestas de los Lunes del Cerro (Festivals of Mondays at the Hill) is the major cultural event in the city with origins in pre-Hispanic times. The &quot;Hill&quot; is the Cerro del Fortín, which was the scene of the annual rites to the goddess Centeótl, or goddess of the corn. The hill had a teocalli, or sacred plaza, built by the Aztecs. The ritual would end with the sacrifice of a young maiden chosen to represent the goddess.

This rite was prohibited by the Spanish after the Conquest, who also destroyed the teocalli. In its place, they constructed the Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmen, now known as Carmen Alto. The recently baptized Mixtecs and Zapotecs then replaced ceremonies to Centeótl with those to this manifestation of the Virgin Mary, at the same place, the Cerro del Fortín.

This revised festival grew over time to be the largest and most anticipated for the town. In 1932, the city of Oaxaca realized its 400th anniversary and decided to combine these festivities with those of the Cerro del Fortín, adding traditional dances, music, regional cuisine and Margarita Santaella as the first Miss Oaxaca, in addition to the religious rites. The word &quot;guelaguetza&quot; is from Zapotec and means offering, sympathy, caring and cooperation. This first Guelaguetza was such a hit that organizers decided to repeat it every year at the Cerro del Fortin, on all the Mondays of July starting in 1953, becoming an amalgam of Oaxacan festivals from many parts of the state.

Originally, the festival took place at the foot of the Cerro del Fortín, where the curve of the land makes for a natural theatre. Since 1974, many of the events, which have grown in number, have been moved to a number of different venues, included the then-inaugurated Guelaguetza Auditorium. This is a Greek-style venue with seats 11,400 people.

One venue is the Church of Santo Domingo de Guzmán, where regional band come to play, dressed in colorful costumes as part of the opening ceremonies. They march from here to Oaxaca Cathedral, where they are joined by folk dance groups such as the China Oaxaqueñas, the Chilenas de Pinotepa Nacional and the Jarabes Serranos. Another major event, which takes place at the Jardin Socrates, is a beauty pageant for indigenous women from different regions of Oaxaca state. The winner represents the goddess Centeótl and presides over the festivities along with public officials. The Bamo-Stui-Gulal takes place at the Plaza de la Danza and represents the history of Oaxaca and the Guelaguetza itself. The Plaza is divided into four quadrants, each representing a different period in Oaxaca&#x27;s history. One other event, hosted in the Auditorium is a reenactment of the Legend of Donají, which takes place at the time of the Conquest. On the streets of the city, there are parades with children and giant papier-mâché puppets.

===Noche de Rábanos===
The &quot;Noche de Rábano&quot; or Night of the Radishes is a tradition of the city of Oaxaca. Artisans show off designs created from large radishes, often decorated with other plant materials. The event only lasts a few hours but draws most of the city&#x27;s population to the main square to look at the creations. It occurs each year on 23 December.

The event developed from a Dominican Christmas tradition, when they would have a large dinner on the night of 23 December. To decorate the tables, indigenous servants of the monks would carve radishes and adorn them with flowers and other plants. This led 23 December to the known as the Night of the Radishes. This led to a special market on this day selling the radishes along with two other popular Christmas plant materials, the Flor Inmortal (immortal flower) and corn husks. This market has grown into a major cultural event and now is sponsored by the city, which packs the main square on that day. The day also includes a competition where radish creations are judged by originality, technical skill and beauty.

===Donají===

Donají was a high-ranking Zapotec woman in pre-Hispanic Mitla. When she was born, a seer predicted that she would die for her country. When she grew up, the Zapotec were involved in one of their many wars with the Mixtec, who generally dominated the area. One day, Zapotec warriors brought a prisoner, a Mixtec prince named Nucano, to Mitla. Taking pity on him, Donají took care of his wounds. When he healed, he asked her to free him, which she did. The war continued, and the Zapotec king and Donaji forced to abandon their capital of &quot;Zaachila&quot;. Peace negotiations were attempted but the Mixtec did not trust the Zapotec king, taking Donají captive as insurance.

This occurred during the Conquest, when the Spanish Christian evangelization of the country had begun. Donají asked for baptism and was renamed Doña Juana de Cortés.

As the Mixtec feared, the Zapotec broke the peace treaty, attacking Monte Albán while the Mixtec slept. The survivors killed their hostage. Later the body of Donají, decapitated, was found in the Atoyac River. Time passed. One day a shepherd came to the place where Donaji was buried by the river. A fragrant lily flower grew there. Fifteen days later, he returned to find the same flower, still fresh and fragrant in the same place, as if a mysterious force was preserving it. She is honored by having her severed head as part of the coat of arms of the city of Oaxaca. In addition, her story is reenacted every year at the Guelaguetza festival.

===Cinema===

Every year in the fall, Oaxaca hosted the Oaxaca FilmFest. It was permanently canceled in 2022.

==Food and drink==


The city of Oaxaca has long been considered &quot;Mexico&#x27;s culinary capital.&quot; The most notable aspect of Oaxacan cuisine is its variety of moles, which are a type of complex sauce. Their origins go back to the melding of Spanish and Arabic food in Spain. After the Conquest, New World ingredients such as chile mulato, miltomate (a small whitish wild tomato), tomatoes, peanuts, avocado leaves, and chocolate were incorporated. While moles can be found in many parts of Mexico, Oaxaca has the greatest variety including negro (black), colorado (red), coloradito (faint red), chichilo, verde (green), amarillo (yellow), and manchamanteles (lit. &#x27;stainer of tablecloths&#x27;). They are sold in markets all over the city as a paste which is combined with water and simmered with a variety of meats.

Other notable foods sold in markets include bars of chocolate (primarily used for making hot chocolate), traditional breads, and chapulines (fried grasshoppers with chile). Street foods include tlayudas, which are large, slightly crispy corn tortillas piled high with ingredients such as grilled beef (called tasajo), cheese, tomatoes, avocados, onions etc. Local drinks include those made with water, sugar and a flavoring such as aguamiel (honey water), trocitos de melón (melon), horchata (rice), tuna batida (cactus fruit shake), and nuez (nuts) as well as local fruits such as chilacayota and guanábana. In nearby Tlacolula and Ejutla an indigenous drink called tejate is still prepared and sold in the local market. Known here as the drink of the gods, it is prepared with corn, cacao, cacao flower and the seed of the mamey fruit. As for alcoholic beverages, this area prefers mezcal, which like tequila is made from agave, but unlike tequila can be made from a variety of different species of the plant.

As in other areas in Mexico, chocolate has had special importance here since long before the Conquest. Aside from being a foodstuff, it was also used as medicine and cacao seeds were used as money. The chocolate prepared in this city is well known within Mexico, as it is distinguished by being flavored with cinnamon, almonds and sugar and is usually prepared with hot water or milk, served in large coffee cups with a local sweet roll.

==Education==
The city of Oaxaca is home to several universities. It is the site of the Universidad Autónoma Benito Juárez de Oaxaca, which has buildings in various parts of the city. The most visible building is the Edificio Central de la Universidad (Central Building of the University), which is located in the historic downtown. It is in a building that originally housed the Sciences Institute. It was constructed between 1899 and 1901, in the European Romantic style that was popular for academic institutions at that time. However, indigenous touches, such as the cresting over the portal, can be seen as well. This building houses the Department of Law and Social Studies as well as the gymnasium. Additionally, the Universidad de Mesoamérica has locations in the city. The Universidad Anáhuac Oaxaca was opened in 2000.

==Transportation==
Oaxaca-Xoxocotlan Airport (IATA code OAX) is approximately 7 km south of the city centre. Most flights are to Mexico City for onward connection, but there are also flights to Huatulco, Cancún, Tuxtla Gutiérrez and Tijuana. In addition both American Airlines and United Airlines have nonstop flights between Oaxaca and their respective U.S. hubs in Dallas and Houston.

The city has separate first class and second class bus stations, offering services to most places within the state of Oaxaca, including the coastal resorts of Huatulco, Puerto Escondido, Puerto Ángel and Pinotepa Nacional, and also long-distance services to Puebla and Mexico City and other Mexican locations such as Veracruz. There are several bus lines which run in Oaxaca. The largest is TUSUG, a type of cooperative company. All of the drivers own their own buses and are aided by other drivers in purchasing new buses.

The major highways serving Oaxaca are Federal Highways 175 and 131, southwards to the Oaxacan coastal resorts; National Highways 190 and 125, southwest to Pinotepa Nacional; National Highways 190 and 130, to Mexico City; the autopista 150D/131D, offering a quicker route to Mexico City; and National Highway 175 north to the city of Veracruz.

==Surrounding towns==
A number of small towns surround the main city and are closely linked economically and culturally with the main city. Some of these towns are known for producing certain crafts that are identified with the three central valleys of Oaxaca. In these towns one can see the workshops and the crafts being produced in the traditional manner although most of these towns&#x27; products are sold in the main city. Santa María Atzompa produces glazed, glass-inlaid pottery of green, while San Antonio Arrazola and San Martín Tilcajete make alebrijes, small painted wooden figures. San Bartolo Coyotepec is known for its barro negro pottery, and Teotitlán del Valle works with wool to make tapestry and rugs. These rugs are known for their colors and geometric designs, made traditionally with natural dyes; a wild marigold, &quot;pericon&quot;, that grows in the nearby mountains gives a gold yellow, cochineal, a native insect, gives reds and indigo, raised in the hotter regions of the state gives blues. 

In addition, Oaxaca city and surrounding towns have market days, where one can visit the tianguis (open-air markets) set up for that day. There are markets on each day of the week. Monday in Miahuatlán is for buying daily staples, and Tuesday, in Ayoquezco is noted for wood furniture. On Wednesday, people head to Etla and Zimatlán for dairy products, especially cheese. Thursday is reserved for the two largest &quot;tianguis&quot; in Ejutla and Villa de Zaachila. On Friday, in Coyotepec, Jalietza and Ocotlán cotton textiles, embroidered blouses, corn-husk flowers and glazed pottery from Atzompa are sold. Saturday is reserved for the main city of Oaxaca, and to finish, on Sunday mezcal is sold in Tlacolula.

==Municipality of Oaxaca==

<text>The International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) was a multinational military mission in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2014. It was established by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1386 according to the Bonn Agreement, which outlined the establishment of a permanent Afghan government following the U.S. invasion in October 2001. ISAF&#x27;s primary goal was to train the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) and assist Afghanistan in rebuilding key government institutions; it gradually took part in the broader war in Afghanistan against the Taliban insurgency.

ISAF&#x27;s initial mandate was to secure the Afghan capital of Kabul and its surrounding area against opposition forces to facilitate the formation of the Afghan Transitional Administration headed by Hamid Karzai. In 2003, NATO took command of the mission at the request of the UN and Afghan government, marking its first deployment outside Europe and North America. Shortly thereafter, the UN Security Council expanded ISAF&#x27;s mission to provide and maintain security beyond the capital region. ISAF incrementally broadened its operations in four stages, and by 2006 took responsibility for the entire country; ISAF subsequently engaged in more intensive combat in southern and eastern Afghanistan.

At its peak between 2010 and 2012, ISAF had 400 military bases throughout Afghanistan (compared to 300 for the ANSF) and roughly 130,000 troops. A total of 42 countries contributed troops to ISAF, including all 30 members of NATO. Personnel contributions varied greatly throughout the mission: Initially, Canada was the largest contributor, though by 2010 the United States accounted for the majority of troops, followed by the United Kingdom, Turkey, Germany, France, and Italy; nations such as Georgia, Denmark, Norway, and Estonia were among the largest contributors per capita. The intensity of the combat faced by participating countries varied greatly, with the U.S. sustaining the most casualties overall, while the British, Danish, Estonian, and Georgian forces suffered the most deaths for their size. The Canadian Armed Forces had the highest per-capita casualty rate among coalition members.

Under its ultimate aim of transitioning security responsibilities to Afghan forces, ISAF ceased combat operations and was disbanded in December 2014. Several troops remained to serve a supporting and advisory role as part of its successor organization, the Resolute Support Mission.

==Jurisdiction==

For almost two years, the ISAF mandate did not go beyond the boundaries of Kabul. According to General Norbert Van Heyst, such a deployment would require at least ten thousand additional soldiers. The responsibility for security throughout the whole of Afghanistan was to be given to the newly reconstituted Afghan National Army. However, on 13 October 2003, the Security Council voted unanimously to expand the ISAF mission beyond Kabul with Resolution 1510. Shortly thereafter, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien said that Canadian soldiers (nearly half the entire force at that time) would not deploy outside Kabul.

On 24 October 2003, the German Bundestag voted to send German troops to the region of Kunduz. Approximately 230 additional soldiers were deployed to that region, marking the first time that ISAF soldiers operated outside of Kabul. After the Afghan parliamentary election in September 2005 the Canadian base Camp Julien in Kabul closed, and the remaining Canadian assets were moved to Kandahar as part of Operation Enduring Freedom in preparation for a significant deployment in January 2006. On 31 July 2006, the NATO‑led International Security Assistance Force assumed command of the south of the country, ISAF Stage 3, and by 5 October, also of the east of Afghanistan, ISAF Stage 4.

ISAF was mandated by UN Security Council Resolutions 1386, 1413, 1444, 1510, 1563, 1623, 1659, 1707, 1776, and 1917 (2010). The last of these extended the mandate of ISAF to 23 March 2011.

==History==

The initial ISAF headquarters (AISAF) was based on 3rd UK Mechanised Division, led at the time by Major General John McColl. This force arrived in December 2001. Until ISAF expanded beyond Kabul, the force consisted of a roughly division-level headquarters and one brigade covering the capital, the Kabul Multinational Brigade. The brigade was composed of three battle groups and was in charge of the tactical command of deployed troops. ISAF headquarters served as the operational control center of the mission.

Eighteen countries were contributors to the force in February 2002, and it was expected to grow to 5,000 soldiers. Turkey assumed command of ISAF in June 2002 (Major General Hilmi Akin Zorlu, chief of Turkish Army Plans and Policy). During this period, the number of Turkish troops increased from about 100 to 1,300. In November 2002, ISAF consisted of 4,650 troops from over 20 countries. Around 1,200 German troops served in the force alongside 250 Dutch soldiers operating as part of a German-led battalion. Turkey relinquished command in February 2003 and assumed command for a second time in February 2005. Turkey&#x27;s area of operations expanded into the rugged west of Afghanistan. The expansion of its zone of activities saw ISAF troops operating in 50 percent of Afghanistan, double its previous responsibility.

On 10 February 2003, German Lieutenant General Norbert van Heyst took command of ISAF, with Brigadier General Bertholee of the Netherlands serving as Deputy. The mission HQ was formed from HQ I.  German/Dutch Corps (1GNC), including staff from the UK, Italy, Turkey, Norway, and others. In March 2003, ISAF was composed of 4,700 troops from 28 countries. Service in ISAF by NATO personnel from 1 June 2003. onward earns the right to wear the NATO Medal if a service member meets a defined set of tour length requirements.

In Kabul on 7 June 2003, a taxi packed with explosives rammed a bus carrying German ISAF personnel, killing four soldiers and wounding 29 others; one Afghan bystander was killed and 10 Afghan bystanders were wounded. The 33 German soldiers, after months on duty in Kabul, were en route to the Kabul International Airport for their flight home to Germany. At the time, German soldiers made up more than 40 percent of ISAF troops.

ISAF command originally rotated among different nations every six months. However, there was tremendous difficulty securing new lead nations. To solve the problem, the command was turned over indefinitely to NATO on 11 August 2003. This marked NATO&#x27;s first deployment outside Europe or North America.

* In February 2002, South Korea sent a medical contingent of 99 soldiers.
* Between February and July 2002, Portugal sent a sanitary team and an air team to ISAF. 
* A study by CARE International in the summer of 2003 reported that Kosovo had one peacekeeper to 48 people, East Timor one for every 86, while Afghanistan has just one for every 5,380 people.

===Stage 1: to the north – completed October 2004===
* On 11 August 2003, NATO took command of ISAF, which consisted of 5,000 troops from more than 30 countries. About 90 percent of the force was contributed by NATO nations. By far the largest single contingent, 1,950 were Canadian. About 2,000 German troops were involved, and Romania had about 400 troops at the time.
* The first ISAF rotation under the command of NATO was led by Lieutenant General Goetz Gliemeroth, Germany, with Canadian Army Major General Andrew Leslie as his deputy. Canada originally had been slated to take over command of ISAF on 11 August 2003.
* 13 October 2003: Resolution 1510 passed by the UN opened the way to a wider role for ISAF to support the government of Afghanistan beyond Kabul.
* In December 2003, the North Atlantic Council authorized the Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, General James Jones, to initiate the expansion of ISAF by taking over command of the German-led PRT in Kunduz. The other eight PRTs operating in Afghanistan in 2003 remained under the command of Operation Enduring Freedom, the continuing U.S.‑led military operation in Afghanistan. On 31 December 2003, the military component of the Kunduz PRT was placed under ISAF command as a pilot project and the first step in the expansion of the mission. Six months later, on 28 June 2004, at the Summit meeting of the NATO Heads of State and Government in Istanbul, NATO announced that it would establish four other provincial reconstruction teams in the north of the country: in Mazar-i-Sharif, Meymana, Feyzabad and Baghlan. After the completion of Stage 1 the ISAF&#x27;s area of operations then covered about 3,600 square kilometers in the north, and the mission was able to influence security in nine Northern provinces of the country.
* As late as November 2003, the entire ISAF force had only three helicopters.
* On 9 February 2004, Lieutenant General Rick Hillier of Canada took command, with Major General Werner Korte of Germany as deputy. During this time frame, Canada was the largest contributor to the ISAF force, providing 2,000 troops.
* In May 2004, Turkey sent three helicopters and 56 flight and maintenance personnel to work in ISAF.
* In July 2004, Portugal sent 24 soldiers and one C‑130 Hercules cargo plane to assist ISAF.
* On 7 August 2004, General Jean-Louis Py, commander of Eurocorps, took command of ISAF. Eurocorps contributors deploying to Afghanistan included France, Germany, Spain, Belgium, and Luxembourg. Canada reduced its forces to about 800 personnel.
* In September 2004, a Spanish battalion of about 800 personnel arrived to provide the ISAF Quick Reaction Force, and an Italian Army battalion of up to 1,000 troops arrived to provide the in‑theater Operational Reserve Force. With a force of 100, Georgia became the first Commonwealth of Independent States country to send an operational force to Afghanistan.
* Stage 1 (North) was completed in October 2004, under the Regional Command of Germany.

===Stage 2: to the west – completed September 2005===
* In February 2005, General Ethem Erdagi of Turkey took command
* On 10 February 2005, NATO announced that ISAF would be expanded into the west of Afghanistan. This process began on 31 May 2006, when ISAF took command of two additional Provincial Reconstruction Teams in the provinces of Herat and Farah, and of a Forward Support Base (a logistic base) in Herat. At the beginning of September, two additional ISAF-led PRTs in the west became operational, one in Chaghcharan, capital of Ghor province, and one in Qala-e-Naw, capital of Baghdis province; this completed ISAF&#x27;s expansion into the west. The extended ISAF mission led a total of nine PRTs in the north and the west, providing security assistance in 50 percent of Afghanistan&#x27;s territory.
* As the area of responsibility was increased, ISAF also took command of an increasing number of PRTs, to improve security and facilitate reconstruction outside the capital. The first nine PRTs (and lead nations) were based at Baghlan (Netherlands, then Hungary, in October 2006), Chaghcharan (Lithuania), Farah (U.S.), Fayzabad (Germany), Herat (Italy), Kunduz (Germany), Mazar-i-Sharif (U.K., then Denmark and Sweden, then Sweden and Finland), Maymana (U.K., then Norway), Qala‑e Naw (Spain).
* In May 2005, ISAF Stage  2 took place, doubling the size of the territory for which ISAF was responsible. The new area was the former U.S. Regional Command West consisting of Badghis, Farah, Ghor, and Herat Provinces.
* On 5 August 2005, Italian General Mauro del Vecchio assumed command of ISAF. During 2005, Italy commanded four multinational military operations: in Afghanistan, Bosnia, Kosovo and Albania.
* In September 2005, ISAF Stage 2 was completed under the Regional Command of Italy. The Alliance also temporarily deployed 2,000 additional troops to Afghanistan to support the 18 September provincial and parliamentary elections.
* On 27 January 2006, it was announced in the British Parliament that ISAF would replace U.S.; Operation Enduring Freedom troops in Helmand Province. The British 16th Air Assault Brigade became the core of the force in Helmand Province.
* In February 2006, the Netherlands expanded its troop contribution with an extra 1,400 soldiers.
* On 22 May 2006, a British Army WAH-64 Apache gunship fired a Hellfire missile to destroy a French armored vehicle that had been disabled during a firefight with Taliban forces in North Helmand province the previous day, as it had been determined that attempting to recover the vehicle would have been too dangerous. This was the first time U.K. Apaches had opened fire in a hostile theater and was, after a fashion, the WAH-64&#x27;s first &quot;combat kill.&quot;

===Stage 3: to the south – completed July 2006===

* On 8 December 2005, meeting at NATO Headquarters in Brussels, the Allied Foreign Ministers endorsed a plan that paved the way for an expanded ISAF role and presence in Afghanistan. The first element of this plan was the expansion of ISAF to the south in 2006, also known as Stage 3. After this stage, the ISAF assumed command of the southern region of Afghanistan from U.S.‑led Coalition forces, expanding its area of operations to cover an additional six provinces – Day Kundi, Helmand, Kandahar, Nimroz, Uruzgan, and Zabul – and taking on command of four additional PRTs. The expanded ISAF led a total of 13 PRTs in the north, west, and south, covering some three-quarters of Afghanistan&#x27;s territory. The number of ISAF forces in the country also increased significantly, from about 10,000 before the expansion to about 20,000 after.
* On 4 May 2006, United Kingdom General David Richards assumed command of the ISAF IX force in Afghanistan. The mission was led by the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps.
* On 31 July 2006, Stage 3 was completed; the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force also assumed command in six provinces of the south. Regional Command South was established at Kandahar. Led by Canada, 8,000 soldiers were positioned there.
* With the Taliban regrouping, especially in its birthplace of Kandahar province bordering Pakistan, NATO launched its biggest offensive against the guerrillas on the weekend of 2 and 3 September 2006 (Operation Medusa). NATO reported that it had killed more than 250 Taliban fighters, but the Taliban stated that NATO casualty estimates were exaggerated.
* On 7 September 2006, a British soldier was killed and six were wounded when their patrol strayed into an unmarked minefield in Helmand, the major opium poppy-growing province west of Kandahar.
* On 28 September 2006, the North Atlantic Council gave final authorization for the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (NATO-ISAF) to expand its area of operations to 14 additional provinces in the east of Afghanistan, boosting NATO&#x27;s presence and role in the country. With this further expansion, NATO-ISAF assisted the Government of Afghanistan in providing security throughout the entire country. The expansion saw the NATO-ISAF controlling 32,000 troops from 37 countries, although by this stage, the alliance was struggling to find extra troops to hold off a spiraling Taliban-led insurgency in the volatile south.

===Stage 4: ISAF takes responsibility for the entire country – completed October 2006===
* On 5 October 2006, ISAF implemented the final stage of its expansion by taking over command of the international military forces in eastern Afghanistan from the U.S.‑led Coalition. In addition to expanding the Alliance&#x27;s area of operations, the revised operational plan also paved the way for a greater ISAF role in the country. This includes the deployment of ISAF Operational Mentoring and Liaison Teams (OMLTs) to Afghan National Army units at various levels of command.
* 10,000 more Coalition troops moved under NATO command. 31,000 ISAF troops were now in Afghanistan and 8,000 U.S.; troops continued separate training and counter-terrorism activities.
* On 21 October 2006, the Canadian government expressed frustration over the unwillingness of some European NATO members to deploy troops to help fight mounting Taliban resistance in the south. 

===ISAF after Stage 4: October 2006 to 2014===

* In November 2006, a study by the Joint Co-ordinating and Monitoring Board, made up of the Afghan government, its key foreign backers, and the U.N, suggested that more than 3,700 people died from January to November 2006. The majority of the dead appeared to be insurgents, but it was estimated that 1,000 civilians had been killed that year, along with members of the Afghan National Army, ISAF, and U.S. Operation Enduring Freedom forces.
* On 28–29 November 2006, there was a NATO summit at Riga, Latvia. Combat curbs were the most contentious issue at the two-day summit in Latvia, following tension over the reluctance of France, Germany, Spain, and Italy to send troops to southern Afghanistan. Countries agreeing to ease the restrictions on deployment against the Taliban insurgency included the Dutch, Romanians, and smaller nations such as Slovenia and Luxembourg. France, Germany, Spain, and Italy agreed to send help to trouble zones outside their areas, but only in emergencies. The summit also saw several countries offer additional troops and training teams. France agreed to send more helicopters and aircraft. NATO commanders said they believed they could move an additional 2,500 troops around the country after some smaller members relaxed their mission conditions.
* On 15 December 2006, ISAF started a new offensive, Operation Baaz Tsuka (Falcon&#x27;s Summit), against the Taliban in the Panjaway valley in Kandahar province.
* On 4 February 2007, U.S. General Dan K. McNeill replaced British General David Richards as commander of ISAF. Analysts reported that he planned to place a heavier emphasis on fighting than on peace deals. Meanwhile, observers and commanders were expecting a new Taliban &quot;spring offensive,&quot; and NATO commanders asked for more troops.
* On 6 March 2007, NATO-ISAF launched Operation Achilles, an offensive to bring security to northern Helmand and set the conditions for meaningful development that would fundamentally improve the quality of life for Afghans in the area. The operation eventually involved more than 4,500 NATO troops and nearly 1,000 Afghan soldiers in Helmand province, according to the alliance. It focused on improving security in areas where Taliban extremists, narco-traffickers, and other elements were trying to destabilize the government of Afghanistan, and on empowering village elders. The overarching purpose was to assist the government in improving its ability to begin reconstruction and economic development in the area. Strategically, the goal was also to enable the government to begin the Kajaki hydro-energy project.
* On 2 June 2008, General David D. McKiernan, U.S. Army, assumed command of ISAF. its troops numbered around 55,100. There were troops from 26 NATO, 10 partner and two non-NATO/non-partner countries,
* On 6–7 February 2009, U.K, forces mounted Operation Diesel raid in Helmand province.
* On 27 April – 19 May 2009, ISAF launched Operations Zafar and Zafar 2 in the Helmand Province. Operation Zafar lasted one week and Operation Zafar 2 lasted four days. Both operations were in preparation for Operation Panther&#x27;s Claw.
* On 29 May 2009, ISAF launched Operation Mar Lewe around the village of Yatimchay, six kilometers (3.7 mi) south of Musa Qaleh in Helmand Province. Operation Mar Lewe lasted three days. &quot;Mar Lewe&quot; is Pashto for &quot;snake wolf&quot;.

* On 15 June 2009, General Stanley A. McChrystal, U.S. Army, assumed command of NATO forces.
* On 19 June 2009, ISAF launched Operation Panther&#x27;s Claw to secure control of various canal and river crossings in Helmand Province and to establish a lasting ISAF presence in an area described by Lt. Col. Richardson as &quot;one of the main Taliban strongholds&quot; ahead of the 2009 Afghan presidential election.
* On 2 July 2009, ISAF launched Operation Strike of the Sword or Operation Khanjar in Helmand Province. This operation was the largest U.S. Marine offensive since the battle of Fallujah, Iraq – Operation Phantom Fury in 2004.
* Beginning in 2010 the Afghanistan Mission Network became the primary information-sharing platform for all troops in Afghanistan in support of General McChrystal&#x27;s counterinsurgency campaign.
* On 23 June 2010, Lieutenant General Sir Nick Parker, British Army, former deputy commander of ISAF, assumed interim command after the resignation of General McChrystal.
* On 4 July 2010, General David Petraeus, U.S. Army, assumed command of NATO forces; Petraeus was formally approved by the US Senate to replace McChrystal on 30 June 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBC-2010/07/03/petraeus-afghanistan&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Colombia had planned to deploy around 100 soldiers in spring 2009. These forces were expected to be de-mining experts. General Freddy Padilla de Leon announced to CBS News that operators of Colombia&#x27;s Special Forces Brigade were scheduled to be deployed to Afghanistan in either August or September 2009. However, the Colombians were not listed as part of the force as of June 2011.

Three NATO states announced withdrawal plans beginning in 2010. Canada in 2011, Poland, in 2012, and the United Kingdom in 2010. Between 1 July 2014, and August, Regional Command Capital and Regional Command West were re-designated Train Advise and Assist Command Capital (TAAC Capital) and TAAC West. The United States ended combat operations in Afghanistan in December 2014. Sizable advisory forces would remain to train and mentor Afghan National Security Forces, and NATO will continue operating under the Resolute Support Mission. ISAF Joint Command, in its final deployment provided by Headquarters XVIII Airborne Corps, ceased operations ahead of the end of the NATO combat mission on 8 December 2014.

===Security and reconstruction===

From 2006, the insurgency by the Taliban intensified, especially in the southern Pashtun parts of the country, areas that were the Taliban&#x27;s original power base in the mid‑1990s. After ISAF took over command of the south on 31 July 2006, British, Dutch, Canadian, and Danish ISAF soldiers in the provinces of Helmand, Uruzgan, and Kandahar came under almost daily attack. British commanders said that the fighting for them was the fiercest since the Korean War, 50 years previously. In an article, BBC reporter Alastair Leithead, embedded with the British forces, called it &quot;Deployed to Afghanistan&#x27;s hell.&quot;

Because of the security situation in the south, ISAF commanders asked member countries to send more troops. On 19 October, the Dutch government decided to send more troops because of increasing attacks by suspected Taliban on their Task Force Uruzgan, making it difficult to complete the reconstruction work that they sought to accomplish. Derogatory alternative acronyms for the ISAF were created by critics, including &quot;I Saw Americans Fighting,&quot; &quot;I Suck at Fighting,&quot; and &quot;In Sandals and Flip Flops.&quot;

===ISAF and the illegal opium economy===

Before October 2008, ISAF had only served an indirect role in fighting the illegal opium economy in Afghanistan through shared intelligence with the Afghan government, protection of Afghan poppy crop eradication units, and helping in the coordination and the implementation of the country&#x27;s counter-narcotics policy. For example, Dutch soldiers used military force to protect eradication units that came under attack.

Crop eradication often affects the poorest farmers who have no economic alternatives on which to fall back. Without alternatives, these farmers no longer can feed their families, causing anger, frustration, and social protest. Thus, being associated with this counterproductive drug policy, ISAF soldiers on the ground found it difficult to gain the support of the local population.

Though problematic for NATO, this indirect role allowed NATO to avoid the opposition of the local population who depended on the poppy fields for their livelihood. In October 2008, NATO altered its position to curb the financing of insurgency by the Taliban. Drug laboratories and drug traders became the targets, and not the poppy fields themselves. To satisfy France, Italy and Germany, the deal involved the participation in an anti-drug campaign only of willing NATO member countries; the campaign was to be short-lived and with the cooperation of the Afghans.

On 10 October 2008, during a news conference, after an informal meeting of NATO Defense Ministers in Budapest, Hungary, NATO Spokesman James Appathurai said:

===Military and civilian casualties===
ISAF military casualties, and the civilian casualties caused by the war and Coalition/ISAF friendly fire, became a major political issue, both in Afghanistan and in the troop-contributing nations. Increasing civilian casualties threatened the stability of President Hamid Karzai&#x27;s government. Consequently, effective from 2 July 2009, Coalition air and ground combat operations were ordered to take steps to minimize Afghan civilian casualties in accordance with a tactical directive issued by General Stanley A. McChrystal, USA, the commander of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan.

Another issue over the years has been numerous &#x27;insider&#x27; attacks involving Afghan soldiers opening fire on ISAF soldiers. While these diminished, in part due to the planned ending of combat operations on 31 December 2014, they continued to occur, albeit at a lower frequency. On 5 August 2014, a gunman believed to have been an Afghan soldier opened fire on several international soldiers, killing a U.S. general, Harold J. Greene, and wounding about 15 officers and soldiers, including a German brigadier general and several U.S. soldiers, at a training academy near Kabul.

==ISAF command structure as of 2011==

Throughout the four different regional stages of ISAF, the number of Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) grew. The expansion of ISAF, to November 2006, to all provinces of the country brought the total number of PRTs to twenty-five. The twenty-fifth PRT, at Wardak, was established that month and was led by Turkey. Allied Joint Force Command Brunssum, at Brunssum, the Netherlands, was ISAF&#x27;s superior NATO headquarters. The headquarters of ISAF was located in Kabul. In October 2010, there were 6 Regional Commands, each with subordinate Task Forces and Provincial Reconstruction Teams. The lower strength numbers of the ISAF forces were as of 6 October 2008. The numbers also reflected the situation in the country. The north and west were relatively calm, while ISAF and Afghan forces in the south and east came under almost daily attack. In December 2014 the force reportedly numbered 18,636 from 48 states.

===List of Commanders===
The command of ISAF has rotated between officers of the participating nations. The first American took command in February 2007 and only Americans have commanded ISAF since that time.

==Contributing nations==

All NATO member states have contributed troops to the ISAF, as well as some other partner states of the NATO alliance.

===NATO states===




On 28 July 2010, Albania sent 44 soldiers from the Albanian Special Operations Battalion to engage in combat operations in the province of Kandahar alongside US and British special forces. The contingent was given the name &quot;Eagle 1&quot;. On 25 January 2011, the second rotation consisting of 45 soldiers named &quot;Eagle 2&quot; was sent to Afghanistan following the return of the first, &quot;Eagle 3&quot; followed. On 16 January 2011, Albania sent its fourth mission codenamed &quot;Eagle 4&quot; to Kandahar. However, the main contingent was composed of a company under Italian command in the province of Herat. Albania also had a squad of soldiers under Turkish command in Kabul and a contribution to a joint medical team with the Czech contingent. The last contingent was composed of 222 soldiers of the 8th Regiment.
The Belgian mission was named BELU ISAF 21. Their main task was to provide security at Kabul International Airport, while detachments (KUNDUZ 16) assisted in the northern PRTs of Kunduz and Mazar-i-Sharif. In September 2008, OGF 4 started: four F‑16s with about 140 support personnel deployed. They operated from Kandahar Airport. The Belgian Air Force operated in close cooperation with Dutch F-16 fighter jets already deployed there.
In December 2009, Bulgarian Minister of Defence Nickolay Mladenov said that the Bulgarian contingent in Afghanistan, which was divided between two military bases in Kabul and Kandahar with a total of 602 soldiers, would be consolidated in Kandahar and that it could add 100 troops in Afghanistan in 2010. In July 2011, Bulgaria sent 165 more soldiers bringing the total number to 767. Bulgarian troops participated in training the Afghan forces and providing security until their withdrawal in 2021.
Canadian Forces were actively engaged in fighting the Taliban in the south and suffered a high proportion of the allied casualties. In 2006, with the situation in Kandahar Province turned increasingly violent, the Canadian Forces participated in several operations and battles from the beginning of the war in Afghanistan in 2001. The Royal Canadian Air Force had a major presence in Afghanistan, including three CC‑130 Hercules cargo planes, two CP‑140 surveillance planes, six CH‑147 Chinook transport helicopters, six Mil Mi‑8 leased for one year from Skylink Aviation, eight CH‑146 Griffon utility helicopters and three CU‑170 unmanned aerial vehicles. The Canadian Army increased their presence with main battle tanks, some ten Leopard C2 and twenty Leopard 2A6M CAN, approximately one hundred LAV III armored vehicles and six 155 mm M777 howitzers. Canada has suffered 159 killed in Afghanistan. In 2011, all Canadian combat forces had withdrawn from Kandahar and relocated the bulk of their forces to Kabul, with detachments in RC North and RC West. Canada completed its participation in March 2014.
Croatian troops were involved in three locations. The Croatian parliament voted on extra troop numbers on 7 December with all parties supporting a troop increase, parliament also recognized that additional increases in troop numbers might be possible during 2011 and 2012 to help train local army and police units. Maximal number of Croatian soldiers in Afghanistan was about 450.

Czech troops in Afghanistan were involved in four locations. In Czech combat units (special forces) in peak served 100–120 troops. In other non-combat military units, primarily engineering, medical, trainee, advisory, or guard, served during the tours of about 4000 soldiers, medical staff, civilian engineers, and other specialists. The largest unit was deployed as PRT Logar composed of 192 troops and 12 civilians in Logar Province, in place since 19 March 2008. Four BMP‑2 IFVs were part of PRT Logar, however, they were only involved in guarding the Shank Base due to their weak IED protection. 4 Pandur II were also part of PRT Logar, which were actively used in operations. The Iveco LMV was the most commonly used vehicle by the Czech Armed Forces all over Afghanistan. The Field Hospital at Kabul Airport was deployed in March 2007 and consisted of 81 medical and 30 NBC protection personnel. Eight helicopter pilots and technicians were part of the Operational Mentoring and Liaison Team (OMLT). Also, four weather forecast specialists and two air traffic controllers were part of the Czech contingent deployed to Kabul International Airport. A third unit was sent to Afghanistan at the end of April 2007 and involved 350 members of the Czech Military Police Special Operations Group, who were attached to British forces in the Southern Helmand province. A fourth unit was deployed in July 2008 and was composed of 63 troops who were in charge of force protection at Dutch FOB Hadrain in Uruzgan Province. The Czechs also donated 6 Mi‑17 and 6 Mi‑24 helicopters to the Afghan National Army, flew 3 Mi‑17 helicopters in Pakitika Province, and announced the deployment of one C‑295 in 2011. Nine Czech soldiers were killed in Afghanistan.
In Kandahar, Royal Danish Air Force (RDAF) personnel helped man the Kandahar Airfield Crisis Establishment (KAF CE), which ran the airfield. Danish troops were also deployed to other parts of Afghanistan. In northern Afghanistan, approximately twenty troops served in the German-led PRT in Faizabad. In western Afghanistan, ten troops served in the Lithuanian-led PRT in Chagcharan. There was also a small contribution to ISAF headquarters in Kabul and the staffing of Kabul International Airport. There was also a RDAF presence with the NATO AWACS contingent in Mazar-i-Sharif. In Helmand Danish troops were involved in the worst fighting their armed forces had undertaken since the Second Schleswig War of 1864. Denmark lost 43 soldiers in Afghanistan. A Danish SOF Task Force was operating in Lashkar Gar mentoring Afghan forces. A 2009 survey argued that Denmark had by far the highest count of casualties relative to population.
Most of the Estonian Afghanistan Contingent was deployed to PRT Lashkar-Gah in Helmand, together with the forces of the United Kingdom and Denmark. 9 Estonian soldiers were killed in Afghanistan.
French forces deployed in the Surobi District and to the Kapisa Province under the command of the Brigade La Fayette. Six French Dassault Mirage 2000D fighters and two C‑135F refueling aircraft were based at Dushanbe Airport in Dushanbe, Tajikistan but relocated to Kandahar on 26 September 2007. Two hundred naval, air force, and army special forces personnel were withdrawn from Southern Afghanistan in early 2007, but around 50 remained to train Afghan forces. On 26 February 2008 it was reported that Paris would deploy troops to the east to free up American soldiers, who would then be able to assist Canadian forces in Kandahar. Shortly afterwards, 700 troops were deployed to reinforce Surobi and Kapisa. The deployment marked a significant change in French policy in Afghanistan. It was later announced that 100 additional troops and Aérospatiale Gazelle helicopters would be sent to the country. France decided to send Eurocopter Tiger attack helicopters to Afghanistan in the second quarter of 2009. In April 2010, French president Nicolas Sarkozy ruled out sending additional troops to Afghanistan shortly. 88 French troops have been killed in Afghanistan. An additional OMLT of 250 arrived in October 2010, bringing the number of French forces in Afghanistan to 4,000. The remaining troops are to be withdrawn by the end of 2012.
The German Bundeswehr led Regional Command North based in Mazar-i-Sharif. The task of the German forces was to assist the Afghan government with security and reconstruction in the four northern provinces of Kunduz, Takhar, Baghlan and Badakhshan. Germany leads the Provincial Reconstruction Teams in the provinces of Kunduz and Badakhshan. The mandate issued by the Bundestag does not allow the Bundeswehr to take part in combat operations against the Taliban insurgency in the south and east of Afghanistan, other than in exceptional circumstances. However, German troops together with allied forces of Regional Command North conducted their combat operations in northern and northeast Afghanistan, inflicting as many as 650 casualties upon insurgents. Germany has agreed to send 850 additional troops in 2010, raising the mandate ceiling to 5,350 troops. 53 German troops and 3 police officers were killed in Afghanistan. 156 service members were wounded in action. In the 2006 German troops controversy, 23 German soldiers were accused of posing with human skulls in Afghanistan. Following the Kunduz airstrike on two captured fuel tankers, which killed over 100 civilians, Germany reclassified the Afghanistan deployment in February 2010 as an &quot;armed conflict within the parameters of international law&quot;, allowing German forces to act without risk of prosecution under German law.
ΕΛΔΑΦ was established as a Unit at the headquarters of the 71st Brigade on January 14, 2002, in the context of Greece&#x27;s participation in the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). It included the Special Battalion of Engineers (ELMHEA) and a security personnel element. In June 2005, the mission was renamed ΤΕΣΑΦ (Afghanistan Special Forces Battalion) and in conjunction with the 299 ΚΙΧΝΕ ( Mobile Army Surgical Hospital), they formed the ΕΛΔΑΦ-2. A total of 3,295 officers (524 officers and 2,771 non-commissioned officers) served in ΕΛΔΑΦ-2, while a total of 28 senior officers served as commanders. The work of the Hellenic Force in Afghanistan included the distribution of humanitarian aid and medical supplies, the reconstruction of government buildings, the maintenance of public works, and the reconstruction of schools. ΤΕΝΞ (Landmine Clearance Battalion) cleared landmine fields and worked on the disposal of explosives remnants. Engineer personnel and equipment were also provided for the release of Afghan civilians from the rubble of Kabul Hospital, which collapsed on July 26, 2004. The Greek presence in Afghanistan ended in July 2021, when the last 4 assisting officers left the country.
The Hungarian infantry unit was situated in Kabul, however, on 1 October 2006, Hungary requisitioned its forces and took over responsibility from the Dutch for the Provincial Reconstruction Team in the town of Pul‑e Khumri, the capital of Baghlan province. From 1 October 2008, one of the tasks of the Hungarians was to provide security at Kabul International Airport. In 2008 Hungarian special forces deployed to South Afghanistan for special reconnaissance and patrol operations. In 2010 Budapest added 200 soldiers to the 340 troops it already has in Afghanistan working on reconstruction and training. Six Hungarian soldiers were killed in Afghanistan.
Icelandic personnel are stationed at ISAF HQ at Kabul International Airport.
Italian troops currently lead Regional Command West and the PRT in Herat Province. Although the mandate issued by the Parliament of Italy does not allow Italian forces to take part in the battle against the Taliban insurgency in the south and east of Afghanistan, other than in exceptional circumstances, the former Italian Minister of Defense Ignazio La Russa has officially stated in July 2008 that such combat activities have indeed taken place over the last year in the Farah area. An Italian contingent including 9 helicopters Agusta A129 Mangusta, 2 C‑27 Spartan, 1 C‑130, 3 AB‑212, 3 CH‑47. Additionally, in April 2008, 4 AMX International AMX reconnaissance jets and 3 helicopters AB‑412, with corresponding 250 personnel (also included), were deployed to Kabul in support of ISAF combat operations in the country. In February 2009 the Italian government decided to boost its contingent by 800 to help out with police training and economic development. A thousand more soldiers were sent in Afghanistan in 2010, for 3,800 in total. Italy has suffered 53 casualties in Afghanistan.
Latvian troops were divided between Kabul and the PRTs in Mazar-i-Sharif and Meymaneh as of December 2007. Several special operations forces operate in the restive south. Three Latvian soldiers were killed in Afghanistan.


Stationed at two bases, Pol-e-Khomri and Marmal.
The Netherlands deployed aircraft as part of the European Participating Air Force (EPAF) in support of ground operations in Afghanistan. The Netherlands deployed further troops and helicopters to Afghanistan in 2006 as part of a new operation in the south. Dutch ground and air forces totaled almost 2,000 personnel during 2006, taking part in combat operations alongside British and Canadian forces in the south. The Netherlands has suffered 21 casualties in Afghanistan. The Netherlands announced in December 2007 that it would begin withdrawing its troops, mainly in Uruzgan, in July 2010. A handover to the United States and Australia took place on 1 August 2010, formally ending the Dutch combat phase. The return of vehicles and other equipment was planned to take five more months.
Norwegian troops are divided between Meymaneh in Faryab province where they lead a Provincial Reconstruction Team, and Mazar-i-Sharif, where they operate alongside Swedish forces. Four Royal Norwegian Air Force F‑16s operated from Kabul during 2006. Decisions were made to reinforce the Norwegian contribution with 150 special forces, an aeromedical detachment of three Bell 412 helicopters and around 60 personnel from 339 Squadron to be based at Camp Meymaneh for 18 months from 1 April 2008, and 50 troops tasked with training Afghan soldiers. After the attack on the Serena Hotel on 14 January 2008, the decision was made to send a team of military explosives experts to Kabul. Nine Norwegian soldiers were killed while on duty.
The Polish brigade-level Task Force White Eagle was responsible for the province of Ghazni. The task force was based in five different locations around the province: FOB Warrior, COP Qarabagh, FB Giro, FB Four Corners, and FOB Ghazni. The Polish contingent operated 70 Rosomak wheeled armored vehicles and 40 Cougars on loan from the United States. Additionally, 4 Mil Mi‑24 and 4 Mil Mi‑17 were in use. In December 2009, the Polish Ministry of Defence announced that as of April 2010, it would dispatch an additional 60 Rosomaks, 5 Mi‑17 and 600 troops. The contingent would also include 400 backup troops based in Poland who could be deployed in Afghanistan at short notice. In March 2010, the Polish MoND announced that one battalion of the American 101st Airborne Division would be dispatched to Ghazni and would operate under Polish command. Thirty-seven Polish troops were killed in Afghanistan. Two Polish special forces units, TF‑49 and TF‑50, operated in Ghazni Province and partially in Paktika Province.
Portuguese participation in operations in Afghanistan began in February 2002. A military health detachment composed of the three branches of the Armed Forces remained in Kabul for three months in a British ISAF campaign hospital. Followed by a C‑130 Detachment acted from Karachi (Pakistan), between April and July of that year. In May 2004, Portugal became involved with a C‑130 Detachment and supporting staff of the Portuguese Air Force, as meteorologists, firefighters, and drivers, based at Kabul International Airport (KAIA). In August 2005, the Portuguese Air Force took command of KAIA with several of its services (for three months), but now without aircraft. Between June and August 2005, the Portuguese Army began the task of ISAF Quick Reaction Force (QRF) with a light infantry company (alternated 4 Commandos companies and 2 of Paratroopers), and a TACP Detachment of the Air Force. Officers and sergeants of the three branches served in the ISAF HQ and other regional structures, more or less discreetly. Between late July 2008 and mid-December, a detachment of the Portuguese Air Force, incorporating a C‑130 and support staff in various specialties, like maintenance and force protection, totaling some 40 soldiers, met the new mission from Kabul. In addition to one seriously injured and several light injuries, the Portuguese army suffered two deaths, on 18 November 2005 and on 24 November 2007. The Portuguese forces for 2012 were: a Military Intelligence Cell, an Army Military Advisor Team for Afghan Capital Division HQ, 2 Air Force Advisor Teams, one for Afghan Air Force Academy and the other for Kabul International Airport, one GNR (gendarmerie type police) Advisor Team at National Police Training Center, in Wardak, Army Police and Navy Marines in service with Kabul International Airport Force Protection and a Support Unit for Portuguese forces with a Protection Company (2 Commando Platoons) and a Logistic Platoon (Maintenance, Health and communications)
Romanian forces consist of a battalion in Qalat, Zabul Province. Additionally, a special forces squad (39 personnel) operates from Tagab in Kapisa Province, and a training detachment of 47 personnel is in Kabul under the U.S.‑led Operation Enduring Freedom. In January 2010, Romania announced plans to send 600 more troops to Afghanistan, boosting its military presence there to more than 1,600 soldiers. Romania suffered 76 casualties in Afghanistan, including 20 killed in action.
In 2007, at the request of NATO command, Slovak forces were moved from Kabul to operate in southern Afghanistan. Currently, there are 165 guard soldiers providing force protection at Kandahar Airbase. 57 personnel of Multirole engineer company located in Kandahar Airport. Responsible for demining, building, and repairing the airport. 53 soldiers of mechanized infantry are holding an outpost in Tarin Kowt, Uruzgan Province. 15 personnel are in the OMLT team, 4 explosives disposal specialists are part of the EOD PALADIN‑S Team. 2 personnel are part of the reconstruction team in Tarim Kowt. Twelve officers are members of commanding staff in – HQ ISAF IJC, RC-S, KAF a PALADIN. 15 personnel are part of the National Support Element (NSE) in Kandahar Airport. In September 2011, 20 soldiers of 5th Special Forces Regiment were deployed to Afghanistan to help with mentoring and training of Afghan National Police personnel.
Slovenian troops (including two civilians – CIMIC programme) perform OMLT (mentoring an Infantry Battalion in Bala Boluk and joint mentoring with Italian army of a Combat Support Battalion in Herat) and PRT tasks; and also placing some commanding positions in Regional Command West and ISAF HQ.
The collective Spanish military contribution to ISAF is known as ASPFOR. Spanish forces are divided between Herat Province, where they form a quick-reaction company, an instructors team for Afghan National Army training and a Combat Search &amp; Rescue unit; Kabul, and Badghis Province, where they lead PRT Qala-i-Naw. The deployment involves engineers, infantry, a transport helicopters unit, and a logistics component. Spanish soldiers are constrained by caveats. The mandate issued by the Spanish Parliament did not allow Spanish forces either to engage Taliban insurgents unless being directly attacked first or to move into the south and east of Afghanistan. 102 Spanish soldiers were killed in Afghanistan. Spain has rejected three times to lead the ISAF when its shift to do so has come.
Turkey&#x27;s responsibilities included providing security in Kabul (it led RC Capital), as well as in Wardak Province, where it led PRT Maidan Shahr. Turkey was once the third largest contingent within the ISAF. Turkey&#x27;s troops were not engaged in combat operations and Ankara long resisted pressure from Washington to offer more combat troops. In December 2009, Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan said that &quot;Turkey has already done what it can do by boosting its contingent of soldiers there to 1,750 from around 700 without being asked&quot;.
Troops were deployed in Helmand Province under Operation Herrick. The Royal Air Force and Army Air Corps had a major presence in and around the country, including attack aircraft, C‑130 Hercules cargo planes, CH‑47 Chinook transport helicopters, Nimrod surveillance planes, Westland Lynx utility helicopters and Westland WAH-64 Apache attack helicopters. They were officially there to help train Afghan security forces, facilitate reconstruction, and provide security. In 2006, the situation in the north of Helmand turned increasingly violent, with British troops involved in fierce firefights against the Taliban and anti-coalition militia, particularly in the towns of Sangin, Musa Qala, Kajaki and Nawzad. According to the BBC, on 30 November 2009, Gordon Brown announced an increase in British troop numbers, which would bring the total to 10,000 personnel (500 extra ground troops, and 500 Special Forces); additionally, more modified Merlin helicopters would be deployed. The deployment would mean British troop levels in the theatre would be the highest since the invasion in 2001. The United Kingdom contributed the most troops to the mission after the United States and was involved in the fiercest fighting. As a result, 456 personnel were killed fighting in Afghanistan, and over 2000 wounded.
Made up more than half of the total number of ISAF troops.

===Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC) nations===
* – Armenia sent about 40 troops to serve under German command. Additional 86 troops deployed since summer 2011.
* – Deployed in Kabul. In 2002, 75 soldiers have temporarily deployed in Kabul, and in the year 2005 a contingent of 100 soldiers served in Afghanistan.

* – Predominantly tasked with peacekeeping and counterinsurgency operations in the volatile Helmand province, Georgia is the largest non-NATO, as well as largest per-capita, contributor to the ISAF. Since 2010, 31 Georgian servicemen have died, all in the Helmand campaign, and 435 wounded, including 35 amputees, as of July 2014. The first Georgian fatality occurred on 5 September 2010, when 28 years old Lieutenant Mukhran Shukvani was killed in a sniper attack and Corporal Alexandre Gitolendia was seriously wounded. The most recent deaths occurred on 7 June 2013, when a suicide attack using a truck bomb struck a Georgian base in Helmand Province. Previously, on 13 May 2013, 3 Georgian soldiers, Cpl Alexander Kvitsinadze, Lower Sergeant Zviad Davitadze and Cpl Vladimer Shanava, were killed after a terrorist incursion and an accompanying suicide attack on the 42nd Battalion military base, also in Helmand.
* – Ireland provided 7 troops on six-month deployments from the Defence Forces, mainly as trainers, medical staff, and experts from its bomb disposal units.
* – The Republic of North Macedonia (then Republic of Macedonia/Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) began its participation in the NATO-led ISAF operation in August 2002, with the sending of two officers as part of the Turkish contingent. In March 2003, the Macedonian army increased its contribution to the ISAF mission by sending one section from the composition of the 2nd Infantry Brigade as part of the German contingent. As a result of the successful carrying out of the mission and the high marks received for participation in ISAF, from August 2004 until the end of 2006, the ARM participated with one mechanized infantry platoon from the Leopard unit. At the same time, in August 2005 medical personnel were sent to ISAF as part of the Combined Medical Team in the A3 format (Macedonia, Albania, Croatia), which successfully carried out tasks at the Kabul airport, firstly in the composition of the Greek Field Hospital, and later in the composition of the Czech Field Hospital. In June 2006 sent also one mechanized infantry company, part of the first mechanized infantry brigade, in the composition of the British contingent in ISAF. In the second rotation of the company for securing the ISAF command, Macedonia increased the participation from ninety to one hundred and twenty-seven participants, and from January 2008 it sent three staff officers to the ISAF Command in Kabul. As a support to the efforts for self-sustainability of the Afghanistan National Army (ANA), beginning in March 2008, Macedonia sent soldiers as part of the Combined Multinational Operational Mentor and Liaison Team (OMLT) in Mazar-i-Sharif while, beginning from December 2008, in cooperation with Norway, a Macedonian medical team is included through one Surgical team in the organizational structure of the surgical unit of the Norwegian Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) in Meymanah, Afghanistan.
* – Russia provided a field hospital as well as a hospital in Kabul for allies and Afghan civilians. Russia has also agreed to provide logistic support for the United States forces in Afghanistan to aid in anti-terrorist operations. Russia allowed US and NATO forces to pass through its territory to go to Afghanistan. Russian Special Forces also assisted US and Afghan forces in operations in Afghanistan, by helping with intel and studying the lay of the land.
* – On 23 February 2008, the Swiss Ministry of Defence announced that its small deployment had concluded two weeks prior. Two officers had worked alongside German troops in the PRT responsible for the northeastern Kunduz province. The stated reason for the withdrawal was the burden placed on other troops for their protection, which had begun to hinder operations. A total of 31 Swiss soldiers were sent to Afghanistan since the beginning of their country&#x27;s participation in 2003.
* – Sweden leads the PRT Mazar-i-Sharif. The main force consists of three mechanized companies operating in Mazar-i-Sharif and also includes helicopters for medical evacuation and an OMLT training Afghan soldiers. Five Swedish Soldiers have been killed in action and 20+ wounded since 2001. Over time, the Swedish force consisted of up to 891 troops, 9 CV9040, 20 Patria XA-203, 60+ BAE RG32M and 2 Super Puma Medevac helicopters.
* – Mostly military doctors serving in the Lithuanian-led PRT Chagcharan, while one officer works at the ISAF HQ in Kabul.

===Non-NATO and non-EAPC nations===

* – Australia was one of the largest non-NATO contributors to the War in Afghanistan. Called Operation Slipper, the core of the Australian contingent was based in the southern province of Uruzgan. Australia had joint command of Uruzgan Province with the United States (Combined Team Uruzgan). Australia provided the majority of combat forces in Uruzgan. This included an infantry-based Battle Group known as the Mentoring Task Force, which also includes cavalry, engineers, artillery, and other supporting assets. The Battle Group&#x27;s main effort is Operational Mentoring and Liaison Teams (OMLTs), which are embedded with Afghan National Army units at remote Combat Outposts and Forward Operating Bases. The OMLTs conduct almost daily patrolling in the Green Zone with the Afghan National Army and have been involved in the heaviest combat experienced by regular Australian Defence Force members since the Vietnam War. Australia also contributed a 300-strong Special Operations Task Group, code-named Task Force 66, manned by the Special Air Service Regiment, 2nd Commando Regiment and 1st Commando Regiment. Task Force 66 operated in Uruzgan, Helmand, Zabul, and other surrounding provinces, and had significant success in both capturing and inflicting large numbers of casualties against the Taliban. Australian Army CH-47D Chinook heavy-lift helicopters served in Afghanistan as coalition heavy-lift transport helicopters, and the Royal Australian Air Force also committed C17 Globemaster and C130 Hercules transport aircraft, AP-3C Orion surveillance aircraft, and unmanned aerial vehicles. 42 Australian soldiers were killed and another 256 were wounded in action.
* 
* – Jordanian troops were deployed in December 2001 to establish a 50‑bed medical facility in Mazar-i-Sharif. According to the US Department of Defense, the hospital provided care for up to 650 local patients a day, and as of February 2006, over 500,000 people had been treated by the Jordanians.
* – Mongolia sent troops to back the U.S. surge in the country. Some soldiers protect Camp Eggers while others serve as trainers for the Afghan National Army.
* – New Zealand deployed an undisclosed number of NZSAS and regular troops to crew the Provincial Reconstruction Team (New Zealand) in Bamiyan to assist the United States. The troops were supplied by Royal New Zealand Air Force Lockheed C-130 and Boeing 757 transport aircraft and later in the deployment a quantity of NZLAV armoured fighting vehicles were sent to supplement the force. 10 soldiers were killed during the deployment, several during the Battle of Baghak.
* – The Singapore Armed Forces deployed close to 500 personnel to Afghanistan since May 2007 as part of Singapore&#x27;s contributions to multinational stabilization and reconstruction efforts there. In May 2007, a five-man team was sent to central Afghanistan to set up a dental clinic serving local citizens, while training Afghans in dentistry so that they could eventually assume responsibility. Other contributions included a UAV team and a Weapons Locating Radar to provide rocket-launch warnings for Camp Holland.
* – The first South Korean contingent had been withdrawn by 14 December 2007 due to the expiration of its mandate, despite American calls for its continued presence. The withdrawal had been one of the pledges made to the Taliban captors of 21 South Korean Christian missionaries in July 2007, in return for the hostages&#x27; release. The deployment consisted of 60 medics comprising the &#x27;Dongeui unit and 150 military engineers forming the &#x27;Dasan&#x27; unit at Bagram Airbase, north of Kabul. They had been sent to Afghanistan in 2002 and 2003 respectively. Afterward, Seoul took only the role of providing medical and vocational training by assisting the United States with only two dozen volunteers working inside Bagram Air Base, north of Kabul. According to an ISAF statement, on 30 June 2008, South Korea returned, operating a small hospital near the airbase in Bagram with military and civilian personnel. In December 2009, the South Korean defence ministry announced it would send 350 troops in 2010 to protect South Korean civilian engineers working on reconstruction. These troops would not engage in any fighting except to protect the base of the South Korean Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) and escort and protect the activities of the PRT members. The South Korean contingent would be based in Parwan province, just north of Kabul for 30 months from 1 July 2010. This invoked threats from the Taliban. In a statement e‑mailed to international media, Taliban insurgents said Seoul must be ready to face &quot;bad consequences&quot; if the troops were deployed. The South Korean government said it made no promises to stay out of Afghanistan when it withdrew its troops in 2007. South Korea redeployed its troops to Afghanistan in July 2010, and was the PRT leading nation in Parwan Province. Korea also dispatched 4 UH‑60 Black Hawks, which came under the tactical control of the 3rd US Infantry Division.
* – The UAE had 170 soldiers serving in Tarin Kowt province in March 2008.

==Financing==

Resolution 1386 of the United Nations Security Council established that the expense of the ISAF operation must be borne by participating states. For this purpose, the resolution established a trust fund through which contributions could be channeled to the participating states or operations concerned and encouraged the participating states to contribute to such a fund.

<text>The Interplanetary Transport Network (ITN) is a collection of gravitationally determined pathways through the Solar System that require very little energy for an object to follow. The ITN makes particular use of Lagrange points as locations where trajectories through space can be redirected using little or no energy. These points have the peculiar property of allowing objects to orbit around them, despite lacking an object to orbit, as these points exist where gravitational forces between two celestial bodies are equal. While it would use little energy, transport along the network would take a long time.

==History==
Interplanetary transfer orbits are solutions to the gravitational three-body problem, which, for the general case, does not have analytical solutions, and is addressed by numerical analysis approximations. However, a small number of exact solutions exist, most notably the five orbits referred to as &quot;Lagrange points&quot;, which are orbital solutions for circular orbits in the case when one body is significantly more massive.

The key to discovering the Interplanetary Transport Network was the investigation of the nature of the winding paths near the Earth-Sun and Earth-Moon Lagrange points. They were first investigated by Henri Poincaré in the 1890s. He noticed that the paths leading to and from any of those points would almost always settle, for a time, on an orbit about that point. There are in fact an infinite number of paths taking one to the point and away from it, and all of which require nearly zero change in energy to reach. When plotted, they form a tube with the orbit about the Lagrange point at one end.

The derivation of these paths traces back to mathematicians Charles C. Conley and Richard P. McGehee in 1968. &quot;Hiten&quot;, Japan&#x27;s first lunar probe, was moved into lunar orbit using similar insight into the nature of paths between the Earth and the Moon. Beginning in 1997, Martin Lo, Shane D. Ross, and others wrote a series of papers identifying the mathematical basis that applied the technique to the &quot;Genesis&quot; solar wind sample return, and to lunar and Jovian missions. They referred to it as an Interplanetary Superhighway (IPS).

==Paths==
As it turns out, it is very easy to transit from a path leading to the point to one leading back out. This makes sense, since the orbit is unstable, which implies one will eventually end up on one of the outbound paths after spending no energy at all. Edward Belbruno coined the term &quot;weak stability boundary&quot; or &quot;fuzzy boundary&quot; for this effect.

With careful calculation, one can pick &quot;which&quot; outbound path one wants. This turns out to be useful, as many of these paths lead to some interesting points in space, such as the Earth&#x27;s Moon or between the Galilean moons of Jupiter, within a few months or years.

For trips from Earth to other planets, they are not useful for crewed or uncrewed probes, as the trip would take many generations. Nevertheless, they have already been used to transfer spacecraft to the Earth–Sun point, a useful point for studying the Sun that was employed in a number of recent missions, including the &quot;Genesis&quot; mission, the first to return solar wind samples to Earth. The network is also relevant to understanding Solar System dynamics; Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 followed such a trajectory on its collision path with Jupiter.

===Further explanation===
The ITN is based around a series of orbital paths predicted by chaos theory and the restricted three-body problem leading to and from the orbits around the Lagrange points – points in space where the gravity between various bodies balances with the centrifugal force of an object there. For any two bodies in which one body orbits around the other, such as a star/planet or planet/moon system, there are five such points, denoted through . For instance, the Earth–Moon point lies on a line between the two, where gravitational forces between them exactly balance with the centrifugal force of an object placed in orbit there. These five points have particularly low delta-v requirements, and appear to be the lowest-energy transfers possible, even lower than the common Hohmann transfer orbit that has dominated orbital navigation since the start of space travel.

Although the forces balance at these points, the first three points (the ones on the line between a certain large mass, e.g. a star, and a smaller, orbiting mass, e.g. a planet) are not stable equilibrium points. If a spacecraft placed at the Earth–Moon point is given even a slight nudge away from the equilibrium point, the spacecraft&#x27;s trajectory will diverge away from the point. The entire system is in motion, so the spacecraft will not actually hit the Moon, but will travel in a winding path, off into space. There is, however, a semi-stable orbit around each of these points, called a halo orbit. The orbits for two of the points, and , are stable, but the halo orbits for through are stable only on the order of months.

In addition to orbits around Lagrange points, the rich dynamics that arise from the gravitational pull of more than one mass yield interesting trajectories, also known as low energy transfers. For example, the gravity environment of the Sun–Earth–Moon system allows spacecraft to travel great distances on very little fuel, albeit on an often circuitous route.

==Missions==
Launched in 1978, the ISEE-3 spacecraft was sent on a mission to orbit around one of the Lagrange points. The spacecraft was able to maneuver around the Earth&#x27;s neighborhood using little fuel by taking advantage of the unique gravity environment. After the primary mission was completed, ISEE-3 went on to accomplish other goals, including a flight through the geomagnetic tail and a comet flyby. The mission was subsequently renamed the International Cometary Explorer (ICE).

The first low energy transfer using what would later be called the ITN was the rescue of Japan&#x27;s &quot;Hiten&quot; lunar mission in 1991. 

Another example of the use of the ITN was NASA&#x27;s 2001–2003 Genesis mission, which orbited the Sun–Earth point for over two years collecting material, before being redirected to the Lagrange point, and finally redirected from there back to Earth. 

The 2003–2006 &quot;SMART-1&quot; of the European Space Agency used another low energy transfer from the ITN. 

In a more recent example, the Chinese spacecraft Chang&#x27;e 2 used the ITN to travel from lunar orbit to the Earth-Sun point, then on to fly by the asteroid 4179 Toutatis.

==Asteroids==
The asteroid 39P/Oterma&#x27;s path from outside Jupiter&#x27;s orbit, to inside, and back to outside is said to follow these low energy paths.

<text>LexisNexis Risk Solutions is a global data and analytics company that provides data and technology services, analytics, predictive insights, and fraud prevention for a wide range of industries. It is headquartered in Alpharetta, Georgia (part of the Atlanta metropolitan area), and has offices throughout the U.S. and in Australia, Brazil, China, France, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Israel, the Philippines, and the United Kingdom.

The company&#x27;s customers include businesses within the insurance, financial services, healthcare and corporate sectors as well as local, state and federal government, law enforcement and public safety.

LexisNexis Risk Solutions operates within the Risk &amp; Business Analytics market segment of RELX, a multinational information and analytics company based in London.

==Overview==
===Market segments===

LexisNexis Risk Solutions operates in four market segments:

* Insurance Services
* Business Services
* Health Care Services
* Government Services

===Portfolio===
LexisNexis Risk Solutions provides customers with information-based analytics, decisioning tools and data management services that help customers remain compliant, reduce risk and improve operations. They serve multiple industries and sectors with specialized industry Data Services including ICIS, Cirium, Brightmine(formerly XpertHR), EGTM and Nextens.

===Technology===

LexisNexis Risk Solutions uses HPCC Systems, also known as DAS (Data Analytics Supercomputer), extensively—its software architecture runs from commodity computing clusters to provide high-performance, data-parallel processing for big data applications. The HPCC Systems platform includes a data refinery (Thor) and a rapid data delivery engine (ROXIE) that utilize the Enterprise Control Language (ECL). LexisNexis Risk Solutions open-sourced the HPCC Systems platform in 2011, and has seen some success with the adoption of this platform by diverse entities, an example being GuardHat, which makes smart hard hats with embedded HPCC Systems technology.

==History==
A subsidiary of RELX (formerly Reed Elsevier), LexisNexis Risk Solutions first began as the Risk &amp; Information Analytics Group (RIAG) within LexisNexis, a corporation offering legal database services. In 2000, Reed Elsevier acquired RiskWise and PeopleWise, which together became the basis of RIAG. The creation of RIAG expanded LexisNexis offerings to include public records collections. In 2000, LexisNexis also launched HPCC Systems, its data-intensive computing system platform.

In 1994, Reed Business Information (later Reed Elsevier and now RELX),acquired ICIS-LOR thereby adding extensive price reporting on chemicals and oil to the Reed Business Information chemicals portfolio.

LexisNexis Risk Solutions moved into Collections after Reed Elsevier acquired the public records businesses of Dolan Media Company in 2003. That same year, the LexisNexis Special Services Inc. (LNSSI) was founded to provide government agencies with global sources of data fusion technology and analytics. LNSSI also granted Reed Elsevier the ability to participate in classified U.S. government programs as a foreign-owned entity.

In 2004, Reed Elsevier purchased Seisint Inc., based in Boca Raton, Florida. Seisint housed and operated the Multistate Anti-Terrorism Information Exchange (MATRIX).

In September 2008, Reed Elsevier purchased data aggregator ChoicePoint. This acquisition included an insurance business and the C.L.U.E. database, an underwriting database for the U.S. auto insurance market. LexisNexis completed the migration of public records to HPCC Systems the same year. Reed assumed $600 million in debt with the acquisition.

===Launch===

In September 2009, ChoicePoint was integrated with the Risk &amp; Information Analytics Group (RIAG), and the combined new entity became LexisNexis Risk Solutions. In 2011, LexisNexis Risk Solutions was officially launched as a separate company within the Reed Elsevier portfolio.

Mark Kelsey was named CEO of LexisNexis Risk Solutions in December 2012. Over the next two years the company purchased 12 companies, including WorldCompliance, Enclarity, Mapflow, Tracesmart, Wunelli and Health Market Science.

===Divestiture===

In January 2013, LexisNexis Risk Solutions announced it would sell its background screening business to the Palo Alto-based private equity firm Symphony Technology Group (STG). STG planned to combine LexisNexis screening with its portfolio company, First Advantage.

===Coplogic (2014)===

In December 2014, LexisNexis Risk Solutions acquired Coplogic, a provider of citizen self-reporting software solutions to law enforcement agencies. The acquisition – which includes Coplogic’s technology, staff and book of business – adds a citizen incident reporting capability to the LexisNexis eCrash solution.

===Insurance Initiatives Ltd. (2016)===

In July 2016, LexisNexis Risk Solutions acquired Insurance Initiatives Ltd. (IIL), a data distribution platform that extracts, hosts and processes large quantities of data to deliver information into the point-of-quote in the U.K.&#x27;s Property and Casualty Insurance industry.

===Appriss (2016)===

In August 2016, LexisNexis Risk Solutions acquired the Crash and Project business group Appriss, a public safety business that provides technology solutions for the efficient collection of crash reports and electronic citations. LexisNexis will utilize the acquired technology within its LexisNexis Coplogic Solutions portfolio, a comprehensive electronic crash and incident reporting suite, to enhance its capabilities to provide a more complete solution to the law enforcement community.

===ThreatMetrix (2018)===

RELX purchased ThreatMetrix, a digital identity and risk-based authenticator platform, in February 2018.

===Lumen (2019)===

In May 2019, LexisNexis Risk Solutions purchased Lumen, an integrated data platform leveraged by public safety and law enforcement from Numerica Corporation.

===ID Analytics (2020)===

In January 2020, LexisNexis Risk Solutions closed its acquisition of ID Analytics, a provider of fraud and credit risk solutions. Previously ID Analytics was a NortonLifeLock company.

===Emailage (2020)===

In February 2020, LexisNexis Risk Solutions, announced that it would acquire Emailage, an Arizona-based fraud prevention and identity verification start-up for $500 million.

===ICIS (2020)===

==Governance==

LexisNexis Risk Solutions is a subsidiary of RELX (tickers: RELX and REL.UK)

==Corporate social responsibility==

===Missing children===

==== U.S. ====
LexisNexis Risk Solutions developed the ADAM (Automated Delivery of Alerts on Missing children) program in 2000 to help the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (NCMEC) find missing children. ADAM distributes missing child alert posters to law enforcement, hospitals, libraries and businesses within specific geographic search areas. The system was expanded in 2017 to allow individuals to receive an email alert when a child is reported missing near to them.

In 2017, a feature was added to ADAM to allow NCMEC to focus on a highway where a missing child and abductor may be travelling to distribute posters to recipients along the relevant corridor. Combining this filter along with the system&#x27;s radius search allows for broad, yet targeted, poster coverage. Functionality was added to ADAM to allow members of the public to sign up for missing child email alerts in their area. More than 1.8 million individuals, private enterprises, hospitals, schools, news outlets and law agencies have signed up to receive automated ADAM alerts.

==== U.K. ====
In 2017, LexisNexis Risk Solutions began working with the charity Missing People and the UK National Crime Agency to support their Child Rescue Alert service, which disseminates missing alerts via text message. Along with Charlie Hedges Advisory (one of the U.K.’s foremost experts on missing persons), LexisNexis Risk Solutions and Missing People scoped a training course to assist law enforcement, schools, hospitals and others with missing cases, particularly those involving children who are abducted and/or trafficked.

===Food stamp fraud prevention===
Since 2013, the Florida Department of Children and Families used LexisNexis Risk Solutions for its identity management solutions to prevent food stamp fraud and improve operational efficiencies, achieving a total cost avoidance of more than $843.7 million.

===Humanitarian emergency education ===
In 2017, LexisNexis Risk Solutions developed the Global Business Coalition for Education&#x27;s Rapid Education Action (REACT) database to record private sector educational contributions and assets that can be deployed quickly in the wake of a humanitarian emergency.

=== Law enforcement ===

====PSDE database====
The Public Safety Data Exchange (PSDEX) is a contributory database that of more than 1,300 law enforcement agencies across the U.S. that was created by LexisNexis Risk Solutions. PSDEX helps its participants solve crimes, identify threats and anticipate future threats. LexisNexis Risk Solutions created an Advisory Committee to advise on policy and governance of PSDEX data, to help assure adherence to federal Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS), state and local standards for security and privacy of law enforcement-provided data. The PSDEX Advisory Committee is composed of former Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Secret Service, metropolitan police department and other criminal justice experts, in partnership with LexisNexis Risk Solutions leaders.

====LexisNexis Accurint Virtual Crime Center====
The LexisNexis Accurint Virtual Crime Center gives law enforcement “greater visibility into crime in both their jurisdictions and nationwide by linking billions of public records with agency-provided data.” It links to PSDEX and brings together disconnected data to provide a more comprehensive view of people&#x27;s identities so that law enforcement agencies can better target investigations, identify patterns, predict upcoming events and deploy resources more efficiently.

==COVID-19==
===COVID-19 analyzer===
In April, 2020, LexisNexis Risk Solutions created a free tracking tool to monitor and report the progress of the COVID-19 virus and provide better contextual understanding of the pandemic&#x27;s evolution. Using data from Johns Hopkins University (daily cases and deaths), the US Census Bureau (US population) and the UN DESA (world population), the tracker provides metrics and analysis for locations across the globe, with maps that drill down to country and regional levels, helping to understand how the virus is propagating.

In July 2020, researchers from Florida Atlantic University&#x27;s College of Engineering and Computer Science in collaboration with LexisNexis Risk Solutions, received a grant for Rapid Research (RAPID) from the National Science Foundation to develop a model of COVID-19 spread using innovative big data analytics techniques and tools. The project leverages prior experience in modeling Ebola spread to successfully model the spread of COVID-19.

=== COVID-19 Data Resource Center ===
The Health Care segment of LexisNexis Risk Solutions announced in April 2020 the launch of a free COVID-19 Data Resource Center to provide county-level insights on at-risk populations and potential care capacity gaps to support the U.S. healthcare industry&#x27;s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. By combining its own data and analytics with those of other industry stakeholders, the company created insights to be used by healthcare organizations, public health officials and health researchers to help allocate resources to the populations with the greatest need. The COVID-19 Data Resource Center features heat maps with insights that identify at-risk populations and correlated gaps in provider coverage. Each county is assigned a percentile rank on a scale of 0 (low-risk) to 100 (high-risk) across various parameters. The map is updated regularly to quickly address the care needs of the community. In June 2020, the group added national telehealth trending insights to its COVID-19 Data Resource Center to show exponential growth of telehealth adoption resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.

<doc id="194217" wikidata="Q2827651" url="?curid=194217" title="Ahmed Ressam">
<text>Ahmed Ressam (; also Benni Noris; born May 9, 1967), also known as the &quot;Millennium Bomber&quot;, is an Algerian al-Qaeda member who lived for a time in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. He received extensive terrorist training in Afghanistan.

He was convicted in 2001 of planning to bomb the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1999, as part of the foiled 2000 millennium attack plots. He was initially sentenced to 22 years in prison, after cooperating with the government in testifying about al-Qaeda and associated terrorist networks. In February 2010, an appellate court held his sentence to be too lenient, and ordered that it be extended. In October 2012, he was re-sentenced to 37 years&#x27; imprisonment. He is serving out his sentence at ADX Florence in Colorado, US.

==Early life==
The eldest of seven children, Ressam was born in 1967 and grew up in a town west of Algiers; he graduated from high school in 1988. In 1984, Ressam traveled to Paris, France, for special medical treatments; it was his first time out of Algeria. Ressam failed the exams to college and applied for jobs with police or security forces but was turned down. Over the next four years he worked with his father in a coffee shop.

He left Algeria on September 5, 1992, due to the civil war in the country, entering France on a forged Moroccan passport in the name of &quot;Nassar Ressam&quot;. He was arrested on immigration violations in Corsica, a territorial collectivity of France, in November 1993, and France deported him to Morocco on November 8, 1993. It banned him from returning for three years. Morocco determined that he was not Moroccan and returned him to France.

Faced with a March 1994 hearing, Ressam flew to Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

===Canada===
Ressam entered Canada on February 20, 1994, using a fake, illegally altered French passport in the name of &quot;Anjer Tahar Medjadi&quot;. When immigration officials at the Montreal-Mirabel International Airport arrested him and confronted him about the altered passport, he divulged his real name and applied for refugee status. In his effort to obtain political asylum, he told the Canadian authorities a false story about having been subjected to abuse and torture in Algeria. He was released pending a hearing, and approved for up to three years of welfare benefits. His application for refugee status was denied on June 6, 1995, and his appeal was turned down.

On May 4, 1998, a warrant was issued for his arrest by Citizenship and Immigration Canada. At the time the warrant was issued, Ressam was in Afghanistan, attending a terrorist training camp. He evaded deportation thereafter by using a Canadian passport he had obtained in March 1998 by submitting a baptismal certificate; he used a stolen blank certificate, filling it in with the fake name, &quot;Benni Antoine Noris.&quot;

He supported himself by theft (stealing tourists&#x27; suitcases at hotels, pickpocketing, and shoplifting), and through welfare benefits of C$500 per month. He was arrested four times, but never jailed. By 1999, Ressam had a Canadian criminal history for theft under C$5,000, an outstanding Canada-wide immigration arrest warrant, and a British Columbia-wide arrest warrant for theft under C$5,000.

Settling in the east end of Montreal, he lived with other Algerian immigrants in an apartment building on Malicorne Avenue, later identified as the local headquarters of a cell connected to the Armed Islamic Group, which had connections to Osama bin Laden. He was recruited into al-Qaeda. According to Canadian Security Intelligence Service officials, he was under surveillance as part of an investigation into a suspected terrorist ring from 1996 until he left the country.

==Terrorist training in Afghanistan==
Ressam became friends with Raouf Hannachi, an al-Qaeda member who served as the muezzin at Montreal&#x27;s Assuna Mosque. Hannachi returned to Montreal from Afghanistan toward the end of the summer of 1997, where he had trained for &quot;jihad&quot; at Khalden Camp. He told Ressam about the experience and &quot;jihad&quot;, encouraged him to train as well, and ultimately arranged a trip to the camp for him and his roommate Mustapha Labsi.

On March 17, 1998, interested in joining &quot;jihad&quot; in Afghanistan, Ressam traveled using his fraudulent &quot;Benni Noris&quot; passport from Montreal to Karachi, Pakistan. There, he contacted al-Qaeda leader Abu Zubaydah in Peshawar, who was thought to supervise Afghan terrorist training camps funded and organized by Bin Laden. Abu Zubaydah arranged for Ressam to be transported over the Khyber Pass into Afghanistan in April.
Using the alias &quot;Nabil&quot;, Ressam attended three camps for Islamic terrorists between March 1998 and February 1999. At Khalden Camp, which generally hosted 50–100 trainees at any time, he trained in light weapons, handguns, small machine guns, rocket-propelled grenade launchers (RPGs), explosives (including TNT, C4 plastic explosives, and black plastic explosives), poisons (including cyanide), poison gas, sabotage, target selection, urban warfare, tactics (including assassinations), and security. Trainees were from Jordan, Algeria, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Chechnya, Turkey, Sweden, Germany, and France. During the five to six months he was there, he met Zacarias Moussaoui, later associated with the 9/11 attacks in the United States. He trained for six weeks in how to manufacture advanced explosives and make electronic circuits at Derunta training camp, outside Jalalabad, Afghanistan.

Abu Zubeida, in contrast, testified before his Combatant Status Review Tribunal that Khalden only trained fighters for &quot;defensive jihad&quot;. He said trainees were explicitly instructed to attack only military targets, that it was an offense against Islam to kill or injure innocent civilians. He said Ressam would not have been sent to Khalden if he were thought to be someone who believed Islam justified attacking civilians.

A six-person terrorist cell that included Ressam was created, and tasked with meeting in Canada. They were to attack a U.S. airport or consulate before the end of 1999. The cell was directed by Abu Jaffar in Pakistan and Abu Doha in Europe.

==Plot to bomb LAX==

Ressam returned to Montreal in February 1999 under the name &quot;Benni Noris&quot;, bringing $12,000 in cash he had obtained in Afghanistan to fund the attack. He also brought in hexamine (used as an explosive booster in the manufacture of explosives) and glycol, and a notebook with instructions for making explosives. While in Montreal, he shared an apartment with Karim Said Atmani, an alleged forger for the Armed Islamic Group of Algeria.

In April 1999, French investigators asked Canadian authorities to locate Ressam for questioning, but the Canadians were unable to locate him, as he was living under the name Benni Noris. In the summer of 1999, informed by Abu Doha that the other members of his cell had been unable to reach Canada due to immigration issues, he chose to continue without them.

In August 1999, he decided to bomb Los Angeles International Airport, the third-busiest airport in the world at the time. He was familiar with it and also thought it would be a politically and economically sensitive target. He planned to conduct a rehearsal using a luggage cart, putting it in a place that was not suspicious, and observing how long it would take for airport security to notice it. He planned to execute his plan in a passenger waiting area, using one or two suitcases filled with explosives.

In September 1999, Ressam purchased electronic equipment and components in order to build detonators, and made four timing devices. He recruited Abdelmajid Dahoumane, an old friend of his, to help him. In November, with Dahoumane&#x27;s assistance, he bought urea and aluminum sulfate from nurseries, and mixed it together with nitric and sulphuric acid he stole from fertilizer manufacturers to create a TNT-like explosive substance.

He had met Mokhtar Haouari in early 1994, when he first arrived in Canada. Haouari was involved in fraudulent activity that included the theft and sale of stolen passports and creation of fraudulent credit cards, and Ressam sold him some stolen identity cards. In early November he recruited Haouari to assist him in what he described as &quot;some very important and dangerous business in the U.S.&quot;, by providing continued funding for his project, a credit card, and a fake ID. In addition, Haouari in turn recruited Brooklyn, New York-based Algerian illegal immigrant Abdelghani Meskini, a con man who he said was involved in bank fraud, to assist Ressam.

On November 17, 1999, Ressam and Dahoumane traveled from Montreal, Quebec, to Vancouver, British Columbia. They rented a small motel cottage at the 2400 Kingsway Motel, where they prepared the explosives for LAX. They left behind an acid burn stain on a table and corroded plumbing. In December Ressam called Abu Jaffar in Afghanistan to ask whether Osama bin Laden wanted to take credit for the attack, but did not get an answer. He also called Abu Doha in London, told him that he wanted to return to Algeria after the attack, and was assured he would receive money and documents.

Ressam arranged for the English-speaking Meskini to wait for him in Seattle. Meskini would assist him by helping him rent a car and communicate in English, driving him, and giving him a cell phone and money withdrawn with a stolen bank debit card.

==Capture==
Ressam rented a dark green 1999 Chrysler 300M luxury sedan, and on the evening of December 13, Ressam and Dahoumane hid the explosives and all the related components in the wheel well in the car&#x27;s trunk. On December 14, they left Vancouver, traveling to Victoria, British Columbia. Believing that he would draw less scrutiny alone, Ressam sent Dahoumane back to Vancouver by bus. 

Ressam took the &quot;M/V Coho&quot; car ferry from Victoria to Port Angeles, Washington. He successfully passed through U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service checks in Victoria, and boarded the last ferry of the day for the 90-minute crossing to the U.S.

After the ferry docked in Port Angeles at 6 pm, Ressam intended to be the last car to leave the ferry. Although there had not been any intelligence reports suggesting threats, U.S. Customs inspector Diana Dean decided to have a secondary Customs search conducted of Ressam&#x27;s car, saying later that Ressam was acting &quot;&quot; and asked him to get out of the car.

At first, Ressam was not cooperative. Dean requested that he fill out a Customs declaration form, which he did, identifying as a Canadian citizen named Benni Noris. He had a passport, Quebec driver license, and credit cards all in the Noris name, as well as another Quebec driver license with the same date of birth, but in the name &quot;Mario Roig&quot;. Royal Canadian Mounted Police later advised that the Mario Roig driver license was a fake, and did not exist on their records.
Another Customs inspector searched the car and found in the spare tire well: 
*ten green plastic garbage bags with of a fine white powder (which tests later identified as urea, used to manufacture explosives and fertilizer),
*two lozenge bottles filled with primary explosives hexamethylene triperoxide diamine (HMTD) and cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX),
*two plastic bags with of a crystalline powder (later shown to be aluminium sulfate, used primarily as a desiccant, to keep things dry),
*two 22-ounce olive jars with of golden-brown liquid (later identified as secondary explosive ethylene glycol dinitrate (EGDN), an extremely explosive and volatile nitroglycerin equivalent that is twice as powerful as TNT), and
*four operational timing devices designed to detonate primary explosives, consisting of small black boxes containing circuit boards connected to Casio watches and 9-volt battery connectors.

As one of the Customs inspectors escorted Ressam from the car, he broke free and fled. Inspectors chased him for five to six blocks and caught him as he tried to force his way into a car stopped at a traffic light. They took him into custody.

He was arrested by the U.S. Border Patrol on charges of misrepresentation on entry and failure to be inspected, booked into the Clallam County Jail in Clallam County, Washington, and investigated by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Customs officials searching him and the car also found the phone numbers of Abu Doha and Meskini. His fingerprints were analyzed by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, who determined that he was &quot;Ahmed Ressam&quot;, rather than &quot;Benni Antoine Noris&quot;.

An explosives expert concluded that the materials in his car could have produced a blast 40x greater than that of a devastating car bomb. It was ultimately determined that he had intended to detonate the explosives at the Los Angeles International Airport.

==Trial, sentencing, and appeals==
===Indictment and trial===

Ressam was indicted by a superseding indictment on January 20, 2000, for nine counts of criminal activity in connection with his attempt to bomb the Los Angeles International Airport on December 31, 1999: 1) an act of terrorism transcending a national boundary; 2) placing an explosive in proximity to a terminal; 3) false identification documents; 4) use of a fictitious name for admission to the U.S.; 5) the felony of making a false statement to a U.S. Customs official; 6) smuggling; 7) transportation of explosives; 8) possession of an unregistered firearm; and 9) carrying an explosive during the commission of a felony.

Following a 19-day trial in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, with approximately 120 witnesses, a jury found Ressam guilty on all counts of his indictment on April 6, 2001. That same day, he was convicted &quot;in absentia&quot; in France, and sentenced to five years for conspiring to commit terrorist acts there.

===Cooperation and sentencing===

Ressam&#x27;s sentencing was delayed for four years, to give counter-terrorism analysts a chance to fully exploit him as an intelligence source. Facing up to 130 years in prison, Ressam began cooperating with investigators after his conviction. He entered into a June 23, 2001, cooperation agreement with the U.S. government. Under the agreement, after he cooperated fully with the U.S. and other governments, the U.S. government would recommend a prison sentence taking his cooperation into consideration, though the recommendation would not under any circumstances be less than 27 years.

Ressam provided information to law enforcement officials of the U.S. and six other countries with regard to al-Qaeda&#x27;s organization, recruitment, and training activities. He revealed that al-Qaeda sleeper cells existed within the U.S. This information was included in the President&#x27;s Daily Brief delivered to President George W. Bush on August 6, 2001, entitled &quot;Bin Ladin Determined To Strike in US&quot;. He testified in July 2001 against his accomplice and co-conspirator, Haouari. In addition, Ressam said that Ahcene Zemiri, a fellow Algerian who was being held at Guantanamo Bay detention camp, was involved in the plot. Zemiri&#x27;s Combatant Status Review Tribunal used this information to continue to hold Zemiri as unlawful combatant, without charges.

Ressam&#x27;s accusations were used as the basis of 7 of the 12 unclassified allegations in the Summary of Evidence memo prepared for Abu Zubeida&#x27;s Combatant Status Review Tribunal. &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; opined that the intelligence analysts&#x27; reliance on Ressam&#x27;s confessions was due to wanting unclassified allegations against Abu Zubeida to be based on evidence that was not gained through torture. Abu Zubaydah had been tortured while held by the CIA before being transferred to military custody and Guantanamo in September 2006. None of the evidence gained through coercive interrogation could be admitted to court.
Ressam had trained with Zacarias Moussaoui at Khalden Camp and was able to identify him when asked. Moussaoui was an al-Qaeda member later implicated in the 9/11 plot. Moussaoui had been arrested by the FBI on August 16, 2001. However, FBI agents were not successful in convincing their superiors of enough evidence against him to obtain a warrant to allow them to search Moussaoui&#x27;s laptop and belongings. The 9/11 Commission Report opined that had Ressam been asked about Moussaoui, he would have broken that logjam.

By November 28, 2001, Ressam began to express reluctance about discussing some matters. By early 2003, after having provided 65 hours of trial and deposition testimony and the names of 150 people involved in terrorism, he stopped cooperating. He began to recant his prior testimony.

The &quot;Seattle Times&quot; described Ressam&#x27;s sentencing hearing as the &quot;gripping climax&quot; to his journey through the U.S. court system. U.S. Attorney John McKay argued Ressam should get a 35-year sentence, because he had declined to cooperate in two cases, which would go unprosecuted. Ressam&#x27;s lawyer argued that Ressam should be given a sentence of less than 20 years, to reflect the value of his original cooperation, saying: &quot;It is a flat fact that law enforcement, the public, and public safety benefited in immeasurable ways from Ressam&#x27;s decision to go to trial and [later] cooperate.&quot; Ressam did not say anything during his sentencing hearing, but sent the judge a personal note, in which he apologized for planning to bomb the airport.

On July 27, 2005, United States District Court Judge John Coughenour sentenced Ressam to 22 years in prison, plus 5 years of supervision after his release; credited for good conduct, he could have been released after 14 years. According to the &quot;Seattle Times&quot;, the judge used the occasion of Ressam&#x27;s sentencing 
to unleash a broadside against secret tribunals and other war on terrorism tactics that abandon &#x27;the ideals that set our nation apart.&#x27;&quot; The judge added: &quot;The tragedy of September 11 shook our sense of security and made us realize that we, too, are vulnerable to acts of terrorism. Unfortunately, some believe that this threat renders our Constitution obsolete ... If that view is allowed to prevail, the terrorists will have won.

In November 2006, Ressam wrote to Judge Coughenour, recanting his accusations against Zemiri and saying he had not participated at all in the bombing plot. Zemiri&#x27;s attorneys advised the military lawyers at Guantanamo and incorporated this information in his &quot;habeas corpus&quot; case. Zemiri was released without charge finally in January 2010 and repatriated to Algeria, his country of citizenship.

===Appeals and resentencings===

In January 2007, a divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Seattle reversed Ressam&#x27;s conviction on the count of carrying an explosive &quot;during the commission of&quot; the felony of making a false statement to a US customs official. The Ninth Circuit read the word &quot;during&quot; to require that the explosive be carried &quot;in relation to&quot; the underlying felony, and found that this requirement was not met. The Supreme Court of the United States reversed the Ninth Circuit in an 8–1 decision in May 2008. It held that &quot;during&quot; only meant a &quot;temporal link&quot;, and restored the original conviction. The case went back to the district court for resentencing, where Judge Coughenour again sentenced Ressam to 22 years in prison.

On February 2, 2010, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Ressam&#x27;s 22-year sentence was too lenient, and did not fit in the then-mandatory sentencing guidelines, which indicated he should have received at least 65 years, and up to 130 years, in prison. Finding that the trial court judge&#x27;s &quot;views appear too entrenched to allow for the appearance of fairness on remand,&quot; the appellate court ordered that Ressam be re-sentenced by a different district court judge from the one who had handed down the original sentence. An 11-judge en banc panel of the Ninth Circuit reheard the case. The en banc panel agreed that the 22-year sentence was unreasonable, but sent the case back to Judge Coughenour for resentencing.

In October 2012, Coughenour resentenced Ressam to 37 years&#x27; imprisonment. Ressam served his sentence at ADX Florence, the federal Supermax prison, following his first sentencing. In September 2023, Ressam was transferred to USP Florence - High.

<doc id="194218" wikidata="Q1304390" url="?curid=194218" title="Oyakodon">
<text>, literally &quot;parent-and-child donburi&quot;, is a &quot;donburi&quot;, or Japanese rice bowl dish, in which chicken, egg, sliced scallion (or sometimes regular onions), and other ingredients are all simmered together in a kind of soup that is made with soy sauce and stock, and then served on top of a large bowl of rice. The name of the dish is a poetic reflection of both chicken and egg being used in the dish.

==History==
The origins of the dish are unknown. The earliest written mention of the terms &quot;oyako&quot; and &quot;don&quot; in combination is in a newspaper advertisement for a restaurant in Kobe in 1884. The advertisement mentions dishes named &quot;oyakojōdon, oyakonamidon&quot; and &quot;oyakochūdon,&quot; possibly referring to different sizes.

==Variations==
Several other Japanese dishes pun on the parent-and-child theme of &quot;oyakodon&quot;. , literally &quot;stranger bowl&quot;, is otherwise identical but replaces the chicken with beef or pork. A dish of salmon and salmon roe served raw over rice is known as (salmon parent-child donburi).

<text>John James (Johann Jacob) Heidegger (Zürich 19 June 1666 – Richmond upon Thames 5 September 1749) was a leading impresario of masquerades in England in the early part of the 18th century.

The son of Zürich clergyman Johann Heinrich Heidegger, Johann Jacob Heidegger came to England in 1708 as a Swiss negotiator. He failed in his undertaking, and was involved in difficulties. So he entered as a private in the Guards, and afterwards became influential in the management of the opera. In 1709 he made five hundred guineas by furnishing the spectacle for Motteux&#x27;s opera &quot;Thomyris, Queen of Scythia&quot;.

From 1710 on, as part of a new commercial public entertainment, he promoted masquerade balls at the Haymarket Theatre. The fashionable world of London was enthusiastic about it and called Heidegger &#x27;the Swiss Count&#x27;. Though moralists protested and clergymen preached against such activities, the carnivalesque phenomenon became a trend throughout 18th-century London. In 1724, William Hogarth published a satire on Heidegger in his print, &quot;Masquerades and Operas&quot;. By that time, masquerades were equally reputed for their great popularity and immoral influences. Indeed, much of the occasion&#x27;s popularity resulted from the aura of sexual danger and mystery, as women of pleasure were also constantly present.

In 1727, during the coronation of King George II in Westminster Hall, he provided a spectacle of lighting 1800 candles in under three minutes. He had used a burnable connector that ran from candle to candle. According to the poet Thomas Gray, the Queen and her ladies &quot;were in no small terror&quot; as trains of flax were set alight and flames ran swiftly from candle to candle. The expiring flax fell in large flakes upon the heads of those beneath but did no harm.

In 1728 Heidegger was called in to nurse the Opera, which throve by his bold puffing. In 1729 Handel and Heidegger were permitted to produce operas at the King&#x27;s Theatre by The Royal Academy in London. &quot;I was born,&quot; Heidegger himself said, &quot;a Swiss, and came to England without a farthing, where I have found means to gain 5000 a year, — and to spend it. Now I defy the ablest Englishman to go to Switzerland and either gain that income or spend it there.&quot;

<text>The Altamaha River is a major river in the U.S. state of Georgia. It flows generally eastward for from its origin at the confluence of the Oconee River and Ocmulgee River towards the Atlantic Ocean, where it empties into the ocean near Brunswick, Georgia. No dams are directly on the Altamaha, though some are on the Oconee and the Ocmulgee. Including its tributaries, the Altamaha River&#x27;s drainage basin is about in size, qualifying it among the larger river basins of the US Atlantic coast.

==Course==

The Altamaha River originates at the confluence of the Oconee and Ocmulgee Rivers, near Lumber City. At its source, the river forms the border between Jeff Davis County to the south and Montgomery County to the north.

It is reportedly the third-largest contributor of fresh water to the Atlantic Ocean from North America. Including its longest tributary (the Ocmulgee) in length calculations, as is standard USGS practice, its length of places it seventh on the list of U.S. rivers entirely within one state, behind only four Alaskan rivers, the Sacramento-Pit River in California, and the Trinity River in Texas. The beginning of the Colorado River of Texas is just within New Mexico. The long Mobile-Alabama-Coosa River system, mostly in Alabama, originates a short distance within Georgia.

The Altamaha River traverses a broad area of low population density with few significant towns or cities along its course. Some cities are along its upper tributaries, such as the Fall Line cities of Milledgeville on the Oconee and Macon on the Ocmulgee.

Bullard Creek Wildlife Management Area occupies the southern floodplain of the river&#x27;s first few miles, after which the river marks the boundary between Toombs County to the north and Appling County to the south.

On the north side, Toombs County gives way to Tattnall County, in which the Ohoopee River joins the Altamaha. The Big Hammock Wildlife Management Area and Big Hammock Natural Area are located along the Altamaha at the Ohoopee confluence. Big Hammock Natural Area is a National Natural Landmark site, noted for its ecological biodiversity and many rare plant species, including Georgia plume.

Below Big Hammock, the tributary Beards Creek joins the Altamaha from the north, after which the river marks the border between Long County to the north and Wayne County to the south. The Altamaha passes through Griffin Ridge Wildlife Management Area before flowing by Doctortown, near Jesup. A wide and swampy floodplain surrounds the river in this area.

Several miles below Doctortown, Wayne County gives way to McIntosh County on the north side of the river. From this point to the river&#x27;s mouth, numerous wildlife management areas line the river. The Sansaville Wildlife Management Area lies on the south side of the river, while the Altamaha Wildlife Management Area lies on the north and extends down to the river&#x27;s mouth at Altmaha Sound. Wolf Island National Wildlife Refuge occupies Wolf Island on the Atlantic coast, north of Altamaha Sound. In its last several miles, the Altamaha River marks the boundary between McIntosh County on the north and Glynn County on the south.

The town of Darien lies just north of the Altamaha River&#x27;s mouth. Several miles to the south lies the larger city of Brunswick. St. Simons Island lies on the south side of the Altamaha estuary.
The estuary of the Altamaha River, where fresh and salt water mix, is about in size, one of the largest intact, relatively undegraded estuaries on the Atlantic coast. The Altamaha River Delta has been designated as a site of regional importance to shorebirds by the Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network.

==Natural history==

Although used in the 19th century as a route for commerce between central Georgia and the coast, the river is nearly entirely still in its natural state, and was designated a bioreserve by The Nature Conservancy in 1991.

The Altamaha River flows through a flood plain up to wide, consisting of some of the last remaining hardwood bottomlands and cypress swamps in the American South. As the river approaches the Atlantic Ocean, it becomes a broad estuary. At least 120 species of rare or endangered plants and animals live in the Altamaha River watershed, including 11 species of pearly mussels, seven of which are endemic to the Altamaha.

The river basin also supports the only known example of old-growth longleaf pine and black oak forest in the United States. Other notable species include shortnose sturgeon, Atlantic sturgeon, West Indian manatee, Eastern indigo snake (&quot;Drymarchon couperi&quot;), greenfly orchid, and Georgia plume.

The unusual Franklin tree (&quot;Franklinia alatamaha&quot;), now extinct in the wild, was found by John Bartram along the Altamaha River in 1765. Bartram sent seeds from the trees to England and planted some in his garden in Philadelphia, where some still live.

==History==
According to the USGS, variant and historical names of the Altamaha River include A-lot-amaha, Alatahama, Alatamaha, Allamah, Frederica River, Rio Al Tama, Rio de Talaje, and Talaxe River.

In prehistoric times, the Timucua people occupied northern Florida and a portion of Georgia reaching as far north as the Altamaha River. The Utinahica tribe lived along the river and the Spanish mission of Santa Isabel de Utinahica was established around 1610 near the source of the Altamaha. Along the coast of Spanish Florida, the Altamaha River marked the boundary between the Guale and Mocama missionary provinces.

Fort Caroline, built by the French in 1564 and probably the oldest European fortified settlement in North America, was likely constructed near the mouth of the Altamaha River. Historian Fletcher Crowe noted: “This fort is older than St. Augustine, considered to be the oldest continuously inhabited city in America.&quot; It was long believed the legendary fort was located near today&#x27;s city of Jacksonville, but detailed archival research in France on Fort Caroline and the early history of &#x27;La Floride Française&#x27; has proved that wrong, suggesting the Altamaha mouth location as highly likely. The site still remains to be excavated by archaeologists. In 1565, Spanish soldiers under Pedro Menéndez marched into Fort Caroline and slaughtered all the French Huguenot Protestants, regardless of age or gender (some 143 men and women) residing there.

In the later 17th century, a group of Yamasee Indians under Chief Altamaha took up residence near the mouth of the Altamaha. The Altamaha River marked the western border of the Colony of Georgia until the American Revolution, so was the western border of the English settlement in North America. It also marked the boundary between the Spanish missionary provinces of Guale and Mocama. In 1738 James Oglethorpe wrote the Duke of Newcastle that he had taken down Fort King George, a fort on the Altamaha that had offended the Spanish. The river&#x27;s name comes from a Yamasee chief named Altamaha.

For centuries, riverboats used the Altamaha as the main transportation route to reach those towns and the plantations founded along the river. The Altamaha was also an active transportation corridor for the Georgia timber trade throughout the 19th century, when timber rafts were constructed to deliver logs to the ports of Brunswick and Darien, where they were loaded onto timber schooners and transported to international markets like Liverpool, Rio de Janeiro, and Havana.

Rivermen assigned colorful names to the various features and hazards along their route down the Atamaha. Among the many &quot;riverman monikers&quot; was &quot;Old Hell Bight&quot;, where the river marks the border between Long County to the north and Wayne County to the south, and is a particularly troublesome bend, with associated dangerous currents, where a pilot and crew might lose &quot;their wages, their timber, and occasionally their lives&quot;

The timber rafts had a maximum width of about , that being the widest that could pass between the pilings of railroad bridges. Maximum length was about , that being the longest that could navigate The Narrows, several miles of the river that were not only very narrow but also very crooked. Each raft had two oars forty to fifty feet long, one in the bow, the other at the stern. The oars were for steering, not propelling, the raft. The minimum raft crew was two men, the pilot who usually manned the stern oar, and his bow hand. Rafts usually had a lean-to shack for shelter and a mound of dirt for a hearth to warm by and cook on.

In Oliver Goldsmith&#x27;s 1770 poem &quot;The Deserted Village&quot;, he laments the depopulation of English villages, and he paints an unhappy picture of the lands to which the former inhabitants have fled, mentioning the Altamaha by name:&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;
Ah, no. To distant climes, a dreary scene, 
Where half the convex world intrudes between, 
Through torrid tracts with fainting steps they go, 
Where wild Altama murmurs to their woe. 
Far different there from all that charm&#x27;d before, 
The various terrors of that horrid shore; 
Those blazing suns that dart a downward ray, 
And fiercely shed intolerable day; 
Those matted woods where birds forget to sing, 
But silent bats in drowsy clusters cling; 
Those poisonous fields with rank luxuriance crowned, 
Where the dark scorpion gathers death around; 
Where at each step the stranger fears to wake 
The rattling terrors of the vengeful snake; 
Where crouching tigers wait their hapless prey, 
And savage men, more murderous still than they; 
While oft in whirls the mad tornado flies, 
Mingling the ravaged landscape with the skies.&lt;/poem&gt;

==Industry==
The 1,759-megawatt Plant Hatch nuclear power plant sits on the southern bank of the Altamaha River in Appling County.

A Rayonier paper mill that manufactures cellulose fibers used in plastics and absorbent materials for diapers, tampons, and other products is located on the southern bank of the Altamaha River in Wayne County.

==Preservation and restoration==
In January 2021, Ingka Investments, part of the parent company of IKEA, acquired near the Altamaha River Basin from The Conservation Fund. The legal agreement is to protect the land from fragmentation, restore the longleaf pine forest, and safe-guard the habitat of the gopher tortoise.”

<text>Wolfgang Tillmans (born 16 August 1968) is a German photographer. His diverse body of work is distinguished by observation of his surroundings and an ongoing investigation of the photographic medium’s foundations.

Tillmans was the first photographer, and first non-British person, to be awarded the Turner Prize. He has been the subject of large-scale retrospectives at the Museum of Modern Art, Tate Modern and Moderna Museet. In 2023, Tillmans was named one of the most influential people in the world by Time. He lives in Berlin and London.

==Early life and education==
Tillmans was born in 1968 in Remscheid in the German area of Bergisches Land. At the age of 14 to 16, visits to museums in Düsseldorf and to the Museum Ludwig in Cologne acquainted him with the photo-based art of Gerhard Richter, Sigmar Polke, Robert Rauschenberg and Andy Warhol, which counts among his earliest influences. During his first visit to England as an exchange student in 1983, he discovered the British youth culture and the local fashion and music magazines of the time. Also in high school, he became friends with Alexandra Bircken and Lutz Hülle.

From 1987 to 1990, Tillmans lived in Hamburg; there, in 1988, he had his first solo exhibitions, at Café Gnosa, Fabrik-Foto-Forum, and Front. From 1990 through 1992, he studied at Bournemouth and Poole College of Art and Design (now Arts University Bournemouth) in southern England.

==Work==
After his studies he moved to London and then to New York in 1994 for a year, where he met the German painter Jochen Klein. After moving back to England, Tillmans lived with Klein until Klein died of AIDS-related complications in 1997.

From 1995, Tillmans primarily lived and worked in London. During the summer of 1998, Tillmans participated in a month-long residency at the last active Shaker community in the world, in Sabbathday Lake, Maine.

Since 2007, Tillmans has divided his time between Berlin and London. In Berlin, his studio is located in an annex of a modernist building from the early 1930s, designed by the architect Max Taut.

===Beginnings===

Tillmans was initially known for his seemingly casual, sometimes snapshot-like portraits of friends (most notably, fashion designer Lutz Huelle and fellow artist Alexandra Bircken) and other youth in his immediate surroundings and scene. His photos – from the Europride in London (1992) or the Love Parade in Berlin (1992), for example – appeared in magazines such as &quot;i-D, Spex, Interview, SZ Magazin&quot; and &quot;Butt&quot;, and established his reputation as a prominent witness of a contemporary social movement. He was made co-editor of &quot;Spex&quot; in 1997. For the &quot;Index Magazine&quot;, he shot covers and assignments, including images of John Waters, Gilbert &amp; George, and Udo Kier.

Tillmans was considered the “documentarian of his generation, especially that of the London club and gay scenes” (though he has said &quot;It was never my intention to be seen as diaristic or autobiographical. I was not recording the world around me or my tribe or whatever. There is a big misunderstanding there that still persists to this day.&quot;). Half of his work is staged, with the artist choosing the clothes and the location, as well as setting his models up in their positions. The series of his friends Lutz and Alex, also published in &quot;i-D&quot; in 1992, are considered important photographic documents of the 1990s. In his early photographs of people, Tillmans portrayed freedom in a different way and he says: &quot;I wanted to somehow represent what was not being represented elsewhere.&quot; From 1992 to 1994 Tillmans lived and worked in London, moving to New York in 1994. During this time, he began to show more frequently, developing an exhibition style that consisted of nonhierarchical arrangements of unframed photographs pinned or taped onto the gallery’s walls. Color photographs are placed next to inkjet prints and next to postcards and magazine clippings of his own images, reaching almost to the ceiling and the floor. He views each exhibition as a site-specific installation, often addressing the exhibition space as a larger composition.

===&quot;Pictures, in order to see the world&quot;===
Tillmans’ photographic practice subsequently developed to encompass a wide array of genres. His portraits, still lifes, sky photographs (e.g. the &quot;Concorde&quot; series), astrophotography, aerial shots and landscapes are motivated equally by aesthetic and political interests, especially related to homosexuality and gender identity. Tillmans says of his work: “I take pictures, in order to see the world.” He produces images for installations in three sizes, from small to very large, and either in signed, mounted prints, which must be protected in a frame, or as replaceable inkjet prints that can be attached directly to the wall (the latter generated by a certificate-authenticated optical disc). They are installed in meticulous wall installations, sometimes combined with photocopies, and magazine and newspaper clippings (for example, in the installation “Soldiers – The Nineties”); or presented in vitrines, arranged in extensive table-installations (“truth study center”). Operating on the basis of the fundamental equality of all motifs and supports, through this continual re-arranging, repositioning, questioning and reinforcement, Tillmans avoids ascribing any ‘conclusions’ to his work and thus subjects his photographic vision to a perpetual re-contextualization.

In 2009, after Tillmans had been using an analog 50 mm Contax SLR camera almost exclusively for over two decades, he turned to digital photography. In 2012, he abandoned film altogether and became a full-time digital photographer. In an interview that year, he describes the corresponding change from using viewfinders to integrated camera monitors as &quot;completely turning on its head the psychology of photography, which has always been a dialogue between photographer, object and the imaginary image that one is envisioning, thinking, hoping for.&quot; According to Tillmans, the higher resolution of digital photographs correlates to &quot;a transformation in the whole world&quot;; he further explains: &quot;In recent years, everything has become HD, so I think it is inevitable that the overwhelming nature of this information density is reflected in my images. In this way, they again describe quite well my sense of perception today.&quot;

Wolfgang has a passion and love for the streets and the clubs. Which this two inspire him in his work along with his work in the gay rights movement.(Jobey, 2010).

====Grids====
The 56 photographs of equal dimensions that make up the &quot;Concorde Grid&quot; were taken in and around London as part of a commission for Tillmans’ exhibition at Chisenhale Gallery in 1997. Shot from a wide range of places, including private gardens, parks, railway tracks, and the perimeter fence around Heathrow airport, they record the daily passing of the airplane. &quot;Total Solar Eclipse Grid&quot; (1998), a set of which was included in his Turner Prize installation and is now in the permanent collection of the Tate, documents the spectacle of a solar eclipse. Each of the 21 photographs in the grid was taken during the eclipse of his immediate surroundings in a tropical locale, with varying degrees of light and detail. &quot;Snow/Ice Grid&quot; (1999) is a grid of images of trampled and melting ice and snow.

====Abstractions====
Tillmans exhibited his first abstract and damaged pictures as a Parkett edition in 1998. The edition, 60 unique works on color-negative photographic paper collected by the artist since he began colour printing in 1990, was a combination of true darkroom mistakes and years of darkroom experimentation that they inspired. The &quot;Silver&quot; works, which Tillmans has been creating since 1998, reflect the reaction of the photographic paper to light, as well as mechanical and chemical processes. The name &quot;Silver&quot; arises from the dirt traces and silver salt stains that remain on the paper when the artist develops the photographs in a machine that is filled with water and has not been completely cleaned.

Since 2000, Tillmans has become increasingly interested in the chemical foundations of photographic material, as well as its haptic and spatial possibilities. The &quot;Conquistador&quot; series of photographs were the first of these interventions to be exhibited. Later works created directly in the darkroom without the use of a camera, and often largely accidental (e.g. &quot;Blushes,&quot; &quot;Mental Pictures,&quot; and &quot;Freischwimmer&quot;), present photography as a self-referential medium – one that could serve as an experimental ground for the creation of a new type of image structure. These “abstract” works now appear next to the figurative photographs. In &quot;Blushes,&quot; fine, thread-like lines, apparently drawn with light, swim over the surface of the photographic paper, and create delicate, fluid patterns.

Tillmans further explores the bounds of photography as a medium in his “paper drop” series (2001–08). He started to make ‘paper drop’ images depicting photographic paper specifically exposed to coloured light in his darkroom in 2001. He creates extraordinary sculptural forms in photographic paper; then, by photographing them, returns them to the accustomed flatness of that medium. Photography’s step from ‘picture’ to ‘object’ is best demonstrated in the works from the “Lighter” Series (2005–08), in which the artist dropped the act of photographing and allowed the photographs - in their three-dimensional form – to only represent themselves, recalling his ongoing series &quot;Impossible Color&quot; (1996–present). These colourful photo-paper works are folded, creased or otherwise manipulated, allowing for a subtle play with the material surface and the resulting illusion of lines and contrast. Contained under plexiglas lids, they have a rather sculptural quality.

====Photocopies====

Tillman&#x27;s first exhibition in 1988 was composed exclusively of images that were created with the latest kind of monochrome laser copier. He regards these so-called &quot;Approach&quot; pictures (1987–1988) as his &quot;first work before [he] even owned a camera.&quot; Over the years, Tillmans has often returned to this medium. The ways that surface structure and image depth influence each other is shown in his large-format works whose original material is analogue photocopies (ongoing since 2006). Here he also references his earlier works from the end of the 1980s that he began in the course of experimenting with an old Canon photocopier. The uncontrolled contrasts and pigment particles in the images from these old machines are clear only after drastic enlargement (framed ca. 260 x 180 cm). The resulting effects are distanced but also concrete – created through not only the materiality of the printing process but also the play and variation of scale. With the analogue photocopy – probably the most ephemeral form of image (re)production – a system of values for images is brought into a critical light.

Commissioned by Tate Modern, Tillmans was on-site throughout the development of the museum&#x27;s The Tanks galleries from 2012 until 2016, capturing each stage in a series of 176 shots. Turning his lens on building paraphernalia like scaffolding, walkie-talkies and sacks of cement, he manipulated his shots on an old photocopier that produces a single colour image after scanning a picture four times, ‘distorting and shifting the colours so that each one is a unique work’.

====Table works (&quot;truth study center&quot;)====
In 2005, at his major supporter Maureen Paley&#x27;s gallery, Tillmans showed his large-scale display-case installation &quot;Truth Study Center&quot;. Going even further than his wall-installations, Tillmans’ table works combine a diverse array of image formats and content. His own photographs are presented and arranged under glass next to extracts from books, newspapers, magazines, postcards, packaging and other found materials. The collage-like arrangements of the table displays produce an open-ness and potentiality in terms of aesthetics and content, while raising a critical question about the interpretive possibilities of the visible in a global information-society. With that, claims of absolute (in particular, religious) truth are caricatured, as if Tillmans would like to put them to a kind of test (“truth study center”). The works draw attention to the exercise of power behind the ideologies of Islamic fundamentalism, Catholicism, and capitalism.

===Videos===
In 1987, Tillmans began making videos, and he has exhibited them since 2002. In most, the camera barely moves, the sound is direct, and the only cuts occur when the camera is turned on and off. &quot;Lights (Body)&quot; (2000–2002), a video installation featuring static shots of the light effects inside an empty dance club, with the bass pulse of the ‘Hacker Remix&#x27; of ‘Don&#x27;t be Light&#x27; by Air, is the first work by the photographer using the medium of film. The only indications of people on the crowded dance floor are the subtle vibrations and occasionally visible particles of dust. In 2002, Tillmans filmed a video clip for the pop band Pet Shop Boys’ single &quot;Home and Dry,&quot; composed almost entirely of shots documenting the mice living in the London Underground system. The film &quot;Kopierer&quot; (2010) depicts an open color laser copy machine, the CLC 1100, in the act of copying documents over a period of ten minutes.

===Commissions===
In 2001, Tillmans was awarded first prize in the competition for the design of the AIDS memorial for the City of Munich, whereupon the memorial was erected after his designs at the Sendlinger Tor.

In 2015, Tillmans was commissioned with creating the official portrait of retiring British Museum director Neil MacGregor, which was subsequently acquired by the museum as the first photograph portrait in a tradition stretching back 250 years.

===Music and art collaboration===
In 2011, Tillmans collaborated with The Opiates by offering a range of photographs to accompany their &quot;Hollywood Under the Knife&quot; album and &quot;Rainy Days and Remixes EP.&quot;

A fan of the 1980s experimental synthpop group Colourbox, Tillmans curated an exhibition dedicated to the group, &quot;Music of the Band (1982 - 1987),&quot; at his Between Bridges gallery in 2014, and also selected the track list and provided original artwork for a tie-in compilation of the same name. The exhibition was the first to be held in the gallery&#x27;s dedicated Playback Room, where visitors can listen to Tillmans&#x27; music selections on high-end speakers.

In 2016, Tillmans&#x27; track &quot;Device Control&quot; was included on American singer and rapper Frank Ocean&#x27;s video album &quot;Endless.&quot; After Ocean met with Tillmans to discuss the use of his photography for Ocean&#x27;s studio album &quot;Blonde&quot;, Tillmans sent Ocean two of his tracks after piquing his interest. Ocean later asked if he could sample the track, to which Tillmans agreed. Although Ocean was initially planning to only sample &quot;Device Control&quot;, it was released in its entirety as an opening and ending of the video album.

===Between Bridges===
Between Bridges is a non-profit exhibition space maintained by Tillmans in Berlin.

Between April 2006 and late 2011, Tillmans maintained the exhibition space in the ground floor of his Bethnal Green studio, a former umbrella factory named Moarain House, at 223 Cambridge Heath Road, London. The project&#x27;s name is taken from a 1999 photograph by the artist, and also refers to the studio&#x27;s physical location between two rail bridges. The space opened with a show of works by the New York artist and activist David Wojnarowicz. In the small gallery Tillmans developed a program of exhibitions with political art from other artists who he believed had not been given the attention they deserved, specifically in London. Exhibitions were held of work by Jenny Holzer, Wolfgang Breuer, David Wojnarowicz, Corita Kent, Charlotte Posenenske, Isa Genzken, the films of Len Lye, and photographs from the Center for Land Use Interpretation.

From 2014 to 2019, Between Bridges was based at a former artist studio and gallery in Tiergarten, Berlin. In 2022, it relocated to a six-story corner building Tillmans designed and built in the Kreuzberg district.

== Tillmans&#x27; Experience with AIDS ==
Tillmans contracted HIV at the age of 26 from his boyfriend Jochen Klein, a German painter and his collaborator on art during most of his life. Klein died from AIDS in 1997. Tillmans stated in his interview with the SHOWStudio&#x27;s Lou Stoppard that after experiencing this he feels like life is fragile, and should not take advantage of it.

In the interview with SHOWStudio&#x27;s Lou Stoppard, Tillmans talks about how some of his artwork has reflected how he felt about HIV and AIDS:

To accompany an essay by Anthony Fauci, the &quot;New York Times&quot; asked Tillmans in 2022 to photograph Fauci — his first assignment for the newspaper. In addition to the photographs, the newspaper also published a conversation between Tillmans and Fauci on HIV.

==Exhibitions==

Despite having already exhibited in Hamburg, in 1993 Tillmans held his first exhibition at the Galerie Buchholz in Cologne. In 1995 his work was included at a show at the Serpentine Gallery in London, curated by Hans-Ulrich Obrist. Tillmans&#x27; work has since been shown in large solo exhibitions at European museums, for example the Kunsthalle Zürich (1995), Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía in Madrid (1998), Museum Ludwig in Cologne (2001), Castello di Rivoli in Italy (2002), Palais de Tokyo in Paris (2002), the Hamburger Bahnhof in Berlin (2008), and Serpentine Gallery in London (2010).

Tate Britain&#x27;s extensive mid-career retrospective of Tillmans’ work was shown in 2003. In 2006, MoMA PS1 presented Tillmans&#x27; first exhibition for an American museum. That same year, the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles mounted Tillman&#x27;s first major retrospective in the US, which travelled to the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington D.C. His first South American exhibition was shown at the São Paulo Museum of Modern Art in 2012. In 2005 and in 2009, Tillmans was included in the Venice Biennale.

In 2004, the Portikus, Frankfurt, invited Tillmans to curate &quot;Inventory / Scott King / Donald Urquhart&quot;, an exhibition presenting three artistic positions from London. The Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, entrusted Tillmans with the role of a guest curator in 2008, inviting him to present a personal choice of works by Isa Genzken, Roberto Matta, and Ellsworth Kelly from the museum&#x27;s collection.

Tillmans carefully designs his exhibitions, in which printed, audiovisual and sometimes textile materials interact with the space they are exhibited in. This preoccupation, together with a rigorous attention to detail (as the pins, clips and tape used for hanging the pictures), has led him to have a dedicated team for setting up his exhibitions. The members of this team are Danish sculptor Anders Clausen, Chilean biologist and architect Federico Martelli (since 2006), and Colombian artist Juan Echeverri (since 2012).

==Other activities==
===Teaching===
Following a guest professorship at the University of Fine Arts of Hamburg from 1998 to 1999 and an Honorary Fellowship at the Arts University Bournemouth in 2001, Tillmans was a professor for Interdisciplinary Art at the Städelschule in Frankfurt am Main from 2003 to 2006.

===Philanthropic activities===
In 2011, he travelled to Haiti with the charity Christian Aid to document reconstruction work after the country&#x27;s devastating earthquake one year before.

Between 2009 and 2014, Tillmans served as an Artist Trustee of the Tate Board. He is also a member of the museum&#x27;s Collection Committee and the Tate Britain Council. In 2017, he was elected to the Council of the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA); in 2019, he was appointed the chair of the board. In this capacity, he organized an auction at Sotheby’s in October 2022 to benefit the ICA, with contributions from Tacita Dean, Richard Prince and Anish Kapoor, among others.

===Jury member===
As part of the inaugural “Artist-to-Artist” initiative at Frieze London in 2023, Tillmans proposed Mark Barker for a solo exhibition at the fair. In 2024, he was a member of the jury that selected Simone Fattal as a recipient of the Akademie der Künste&#x27;s Berlin Art Prize.

===Political activities===
In the lead-up to the 2016 referendum over whether Britain should leave the European Union, Tillmans devoted himself and the resources of his studio to a campaign to keep Britain in. In the lead-up to Germany’s 2017 parliamentary elections, he produced posters against the far-right Alternative for Germany party. Ahead of the 2024 European elections, he donated 50,000 euros to the Social Democratic Party (SPD).

<text>Heat capacity or thermal capacity is a physical property of matter, defined as the amount of heat to be supplied to an object to produce a unit change in its temperature. The SI unit of heat capacity is joule per kelvin (J/K).

Heat capacity is an extensive property. The corresponding intensive property is the specific heat capacity, found by dividing the heat capacity of an object by its mass. Dividing the heat capacity by the amount of substance in moles yields its molar heat capacity. The volumetric heat capacity measures the heat capacity per volume. In architecture and civil engineering, the heat capacity of a building is often referred to as its &quot;thermal mass&quot;.

== Definition ==
=== Basic definition ===
The heat capacity of an object, denoted by formula_1, is the limit
formula_2
where formula_3 is the amount of heat that must be added to the object (of mass &quot;M&quot;) in order to raise its temperature by formula_4.

The value of this parameter usually varies considerably depending on the starting temperature formula_5 of the object and the pressure formula_6 applied to it. In particular, it typically varies dramatically with phase transitions such as melting or vaporization (see enthalpy of fusion and enthalpy of vaporization). Therefore, it should be considered a function formula_7 of those two variables.

=== Variation with temperature ===
The variation can be ignored in contexts when working with objects in narrow ranges of temperature and pressure. For example, the heat capacity of a block of iron weighing one pound is about 204 J/K when measured from a starting temperature &quot;T&quot; = 25 °C and &quot;P&quot; = 1 atm of pressure. That approximate value is adequate for temperatures between 15 °C and 35 °C, and surrounding pressures from 0 to 10 atmospheres, because the exact value varies very little in those ranges. One can trust that the same heat input of 204 J will raise the temperature of the block from 15 °C to 16 °C, or from 34 °C to 35 °C, with negligible error.

===Heat capacities of a homogeneous system undergoing different thermodynamic processes===

==== At constant pressure, &quot;δQ&quot; = &quot;dU&quot; + &quot;pdV&quot; (isobaric process) ====
At constant pressure, heat supplied to the system contributes to both the work done and the change in internal energy, according to the first law of thermodynamics. The heat capacity is called formula_8 and defined as:

formula_9

From the first law of thermodynamics follows formula_10 and the inner energy as a function of formula_6 and formula_5 is:

formula_13

For constant pressure formula_14 the equation simplifies to:

formula_15

where the final equality follows from the appropriate Maxwell relations, and is commonly used as the definition of the isobaric heat capacity.

==== At constant volume, &quot;dV&quot; = 0, &quot;δQ&quot; = &quot;dU&quot; (isochoric process) ====
A system undergoing a process at constant volume implies that no expansion work is done, so the heat supplied contributes only to the change in internal energy. The heat capacity obtained this way is denoted formula_16 The value of formula_17 is always less than the value of formula_8. (formula_19.)

Expressing the inner energy as a function of the variables formula_5 and formula_21 gives:

formula_22

For a constant volume (formula_23) the heat capacity reads:

formula_24

The relation between formula_17 and formula_8 is then:

formula_27

==== Calculating &quot;Cp&quot; and &quot;CV&quot; for an ideal gas ====

Mayer&#x27;s relation:

formula_28
formula_29

where:

* formula_30 is the number of moles of the gas,
* formula_31 is the universal gas constant,
* formula_32 is the heat capacity ratio (which can be calculated by knowing the number of degrees of freedom of the gas molecule).

Using the above two relations, the specific heats can be deduced as follows:

formula_33
formula_34
Following from the equipartition of energy, it is deduced that an ideal gas has the isochoric heat capacity

formula_35

where formula_36 is the number of degrees of freedom of each individual particle in the gas, and formula_37 is the number of internal degrees of freedom, where the number 3 comes from the three translational degrees of freedom (for a gas in 3D space). This means that a monoatomic ideal gas (with zero internal degrees of freedom) will have isochoric heat capacity formula_38.

==== At constant temperature (Isothermal process) ====
No change in internal energy (as the temperature of the system is constant throughout the process) leads to only work done by the total supplied heat, and thus an infinite amount of heat is required to increase the temperature of the system by a unit temperature, leading to infinite or undefined heat capacity of the system.

==== At the time of phase change (Phase transition) ====
Heat capacity of a system undergoing phase transition is infinite, because the heat is utilized in changing the state of the material rather than raising the overall temperature.

===Heterogeneous objects===
The heat capacity may be well-defined even for heterogeneous objects, with separate parts made of different materials; such as an electric motor, a crucible with some metal, or a whole building. In many cases, the (isobaric) heat capacity of such objects can be computed by simply adding together the (isobaric) heat capacities of the individual parts.

However, this computation is valid only when all parts of the object are at the same external pressure before and after the measurement. That may not be possible in some cases. For example, when heating an amount of gas in an elastic container, its volume &quot;and pressure&quot; will both increase, even if the atmospheric pressure outside the container is kept constant. Therefore, the effective heat capacity of the gas, in that situation, will have a value intermediate between its isobaric and isochoric capacities formula_8 and formula_17.

For complex thermodynamic systems with several interacting parts and state variables, or for measurement conditions that are neither constant pressure nor constant volume, or for situations where the temperature is significantly non-uniform, the simple definitions of heat capacity above are not useful or even meaningful. The heat energy that is supplied may end up as kinetic energy (energy of motion) and potential energy (energy stored in force fields), both at macroscopic and atomic scales. Then the change in temperature will depend on the particular path that the system followed through its phase space between the initial and final states. Namely, one must somehow specify how the positions, velocities, pressures, volumes, etc. changed between the initial and final states; and use the general tools of thermodynamics to predict the system&#x27;s reaction to a small energy input. The &quot;constant volume&quot; and &quot;constant pressure&quot; heating modes are just two among infinitely many paths that a simple homogeneous system can follow.

== Measurement ==
The heat capacity can usually be measured by the method implied by its definition: start with the object at a known uniform temperature, add a known amount of heat energy to it, wait for its temperature to become uniform, and measure the change in its temperature. This method can give moderately accurate values for many solids; however, it cannot provide very precise measurements, especially for gases.

==Units==

===International system (SI)===
The SI unit for heat capacity of an object is joule per kelvin (J/K or J⋅K−1). Since an increment of temperature of one degree Celsius is the same as an increment of one kelvin, that is the same unit as J/°C.

The heat capacity of an object is an amount of energy divided by a temperature change, which has the dimension L2⋅M⋅T−2⋅Θ−1. Therefore, the SI unit J/K is equivalent to kilogram meter squared per second squared per kelvin (kg⋅m2⋅s−2⋅K−1 ).

===English (Imperial) engineering units===
Professionals in construction, civil engineering, chemical engineering, and other technical disciplines, especially in the United States, may use the so-called English Engineering units, that include the pound (lb = 0.45359237 kg) as the unit of mass, the degree Fahrenheit or Rankine (K, about 0.55556 K) as the unit of temperature increment, and the British thermal unit (BTU ≈ 1055.06 J), as the unit of heat. In those contexts, the unit of heat capacity is 1 BTU/°R ≈ 1900 J/K. The BTU was in fact defined so that the average heat capacity of one pound of water would be 1 BTU/°F. In this regard, with respect to mass, note conversion of 1 Btu/lb⋅°R ≈ 4,187 J/kg⋅K and the calorie (below).

===Calories===
In chemistry, heat amounts are often measured in calories. Confusingly, two units with that name, denoted &quot;cal&quot; or &quot;Cal&quot;, have been commonly used to measure amounts of heat: 
* The &quot;small calorie&quot; (or &quot;gram-calorie&quot;, &quot;cal&quot;) is exactly 4.184 J. It was originally defined so that the heat capacity of 1 gram of liquid water would be 1 cal/°C. 
* The &quot;grand calorie&quot; (also &quot;kilocalorie&quot;, &quot;kilogram-calorie&quot;, or &quot;food calorie&quot;; &quot;kcal&quot; or &quot;Cal&quot;) is 1000 cal, that is, exactly 4184 J. It was originally defined so that the heat capacity of 1 kg of water would be 1 kcal/°C.
With these units of heat energy, the units of heat capacity are
* 1 cal/°C = 4.184 J/K ;
* 1 kcal/°C = 4184 J/K.

==Physical basis==
== Negative heat capacity ==
Most physical systems exhibit a positive heat capacity; constant-volume and constant-pressure heat capacities, rigorously defined as partial derivatives, are always positive for homogeneous bodies. However, even though it can seem paradoxical at first, there are some systems for which the heat capacity formula_41 is &quot;negative&quot;. Examples include a reversibly and nearly adiabatically expanding ideal gas, which cools, formula_4&lt; 0, while a small amount of heat formula_43 is put in, or combusting methane with increasing temperature, formula_4&gt; 0, and giving off heat, formula_45. Others are inhomogeneous systems that do not meet the strict definition of thermodynamic equilibrium. They include gravitating objects such as stars and galaxies, and also some nano-scale clusters of a few tens of atoms close to a phase transition. A negative heat capacity can result in a negative temperature.

===Stars and black holes===

According to the virial theorem, for a self-gravitating body like a star or an interstellar gas cloud, the average potential energy &quot;U&quot;pot and the average kinetic energy &quot;U&quot;kin are locked together in the relation

formula_46

The total energy &quot;U&quot; (= &quot;U&quot;pot + &quot;U&quot;kin) therefore obeys

formula_47

If the system loses energy, for example, by radiating energy into space, the average kinetic energy actually increases. If a temperature is defined by the average kinetic energy, then the system therefore can be said to have a negative heat capacity.

A more extreme version of this occurs with black holes. According to black-hole thermodynamics, the more mass and energy a black hole absorbs, the colder it becomes. In contrast, if it is a net emitter of energy, through Hawking radiation, it will become hotter and hotter until it boils away.

===Consequences===
According to the second law of thermodynamics, when two systems with different temperatures interact via a purely thermal connection, heat will flow from the hotter system to the cooler one (this can also be understood from a statistical point of view). Therefore, if such systems have equal temperatures, they are at thermal equilibrium. However, this equilibrium is stable only if the systems have &quot;positive&quot; heat capacities. For such systems, when heat flows from a higher-temperature system to a lower-temperature one, the temperature of the first decreases and that of the latter increases, so that both approach equilibrium. In contrast, for systems with &quot;negative&quot; heat capacities, the temperature of the hotter system will further increase as it loses heat, and that of the colder will further decrease, so that they will move farther from equilibrium. This means that the equilibrium is unstable.

For example, according to theory, the smaller (less massive) a black hole is, the smaller its Schwarzschild radius will be, and therefore the greater the curvature of its event horizon will be, as well as its temperature. Thus, the smaller the black hole, the more thermal radiation it will emit and the more quickly it will evaporate by Hawking radiation.

<text>After the Taliban took charge in Kabul, Afghanistan in 1994, Commander Kashmir Khan opposed the Taliban regime and fought several battles with the Taliban. 
Kashmir Khan belonged to the Shura Nizami (military council) of Hezb-e Islami.
Human Rights Watch, quoting the Afghan Support Project, reports that the
Hezb-e Islami attacked Kabul through regular rocket bombardment, causing extensive civilian casualties, and damage to property.

In 2002 the Hezb-e Islami is reported to have split, with the hard-line Islamists, including Kashmir Khan, remaining with the party&#x27;s leader, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar.
Other former senior members are reported to have wished to join in the democratic process.

On August 29, 2002, the &quot;Asia Times&quot; reported:
:&quot;If American forces venture into Kunar they will be against tremendous odds. Kashmir Khan - the most powerful Hezb-e-Islami commander - keeps his base in the mountains of Kunar. Haji S says that &#x27;even the Taliban at the time did not disturb him. He is not interested in ideology or politics. He is interested in power.&#x27; This also means that Kashmir Khan is unbribable by the Americans.&quot;

Kashmir Khan was reported to have been in negotiations with the Hamid Karzai government on February 22, 2005.

The &quot;Asia Times&quot; reported, on February 8, 2006, that Khan was alive, and still serving as a commander for the Hezb-e Islami.

<doc id="194242" wikidata="Q156032" url="?curid=194242" title="Red River of the South">
<text>The Red River is a major river in the Southern United States. It was named for its reddish water color from passing through red-bed country in its watershed. It also is known as the Red River of the South to distinguish it from the Red River of the North, which flows between Minnesota and North Dakota into the Canadian province of Manitoba. Although once a tributary of the Mississippi River, the Red River now is a tributary of the Atchafalaya River, a distributary of the Mississippi that flows separately into the Gulf of Mexico. This confluence is connected to the Mississippi River by the Old River Control Structure.

The south bank of the Red River formed part of the US–Mexico border from the Adams–Onís Treaty (in force only in 1821) until the Texas Annexation and the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.

The Red River basin is the second-largest in the southern Great Plains. It rises in two branches in the Texas panhandle and flows eastward, serving as a border between the states of Texas and Oklahoma. It forms a short border between Texas and Arkansas before entering Arkansas. It forms much of the eastern border of Miller County, Arkansas, turning south near Fulton and flowing into Louisiana, where it feeds the Atchafalaya River. The total length of the river is , with a mean flow of over at the mouth.

==Geography==
===Course===
The Red River begins at the junction of Buck Creek and Prairie Dog Town Fork, in Harmon County, Oklahoma.

Specialists have debated whether the North Fork or the Prairie Dog Town Fork is the true stem. In 1852, Randolph B. Marcy&#x27;s expedition had followed the Prairie Dog Town Fork. Because of a cartographic error, the land between the north and south forks was claimed by both the state of Texas and the United States federal government. Originally called Greer County, Texas, the US Supreme Court ruled that it belonged to the United States, which at the time oversaw the Oklahoma Territory. That territory was later incorporated into the state of Oklahoma, whose southern border follows the south fork. Today, the southern Prairie Dog Town Fork is considered the main fork, though the North Fork is as long and normally has a greater water flow.

The southern fork, about long, is generally considered the main stem of the Red River. It is formed in Randall County, Texas, near the county seat of Canyon, by the confluence of Tierra Blanca Creek and intermittent Palo Duro Creek (not to be confused with another Palo Duro Creek 75 miles to the north, which drains into the North Canadian River). It turns and flows southeast through Palo Duro Canyon in Palo Duro Canyon State Park at an elevation of , and past Newlin, Texas, to cross the Oklahoma state line. About 2 miles south of Elmer, Oklahoma, the Salt Fork of the Red River joins from the north. These combined waters receive the North Fork Red River from the north about 10 mi (16 km) west-southwest of Frederick, Oklahoma to form the Red River proper.

The combined river follows a winding course east through one of the most arid parts of the Great Plains, receiving the Wichita River about 25 miles northeast of the city of Wichita Falls. Near Denison, the river exits the eastern end of Lake Texoma, a reservoir formed by the Denison Dam. (The lake is also fed by the Washita River from the north.) Beyond the dam it runs generally east towards Arkansas, receiving Oklahoma&#x27;s Muddy Boggy Creek on the left bank before turning southward near Texarkana.

Soon after, the waterway crosses south into Louisiana. The sister cities of Shreveport and Bossier City were developed on either bank of the river, as were the downriver cities of Alexandria and Pineville. After being joined from the north by the Black River (downstream name of the Ouachita River, its largest tributary) about 1.5 miles south of Acme, the river broadens into a complex network of marshlands west of the Mississippi River. Its waters eventually become a tributary of the Atchafalaya River and flow generally southward into the Gulf of Mexico.

===Tributaries===
Tributaries include the Little Red River, Prairie Dog Town Fork Red River, Salt Fork Red River, North Fork Red River, Cross Bayou, Pease River, Washita River, Kiamichi River, Wichita River, Little Wichita River, Little River, Sulphur River, Bayou Brevelle, Loggy Bayou (through Lake Bistineau and Dorcheat Bayou), the Blue River, as well as the Ouachita River (also known as the Black River at that point) not far (at Acme, Louisiana) from the mouth.

===Saltwater river===
The Red River is salty through tributaries above Lake Texoma. The saltiness is caused by a natural phenomenon that dates back to ancient times. About 250 million years ago, an inland sea blanketed parts of the region. As time passed, that sea evaporated, leaving salt deposits – mostly sodium chloride. Deposition eventually buried the deposits, but the salt continues to leach through natural seeps in tributaries above Lake Texoma, sending as much as 3,450 tons of salt per day flowing down the Red River.

==Watershed==
The Red River&#x27;s watershed covers and is the southernmost major river system in the Great Plains. Its drainage basin is mostly in the states of Texas and Oklahoma, but also covers parts of New Mexico, Arkansas and Louisiana. Its basin is characterized by flat, fertile agricultural land, with only a few major cities. The drainage basin of the Red River is very arid and receives little precipitation. As a result, much of the river above the Texas–Oklahoma border is intermittent, and the flow varies widely until the river is beyond its great bend south in Arkansas. Most of the agriculture in the basin is sustained by groundwater, which is recharged with rainfall and riverflow. The lower course of the river flows through a series of marshes and swamps, which dramatically moderate its flow.

==History==
===Native Americans===
Native American cultures along the river were diverse, developing specialized adaptations to the many different environments. Starting near the headwaters, the Plains division of the Lipan Apache dominated the western Red River area until the 18th century, when they were displaced by invading Comanche from the north. The middle part of the Red River was dominated by the Wichita and Tonkawa. This area was prairie, where Native Americans constructed portable and temporary tepees for housing. They practiced limited farming and followed game in seasonal, nomadic hunting cycles. By the time of European contact, the eastern Piney Woods of the lower river courses were dominated by the numerous historic tribes of the Caddo Confederacy. They found plentiful game and fish, and also had good land for cultivating staple crops.

===American exploration and settlement, 1806 onwards ===
In 1806, President Thomas Jefferson commissioned the Red River Expedition to explore parts of the new lands of the 1803 Louisiana Purchase by traveling up the Red River. Jefferson wrote in a letter to explorer William Dunbar that the river was &quot;in truth, next to the Missouri, the most interesting water of the Mississippi&quot;. Having threaded the maze of bayous at the river&#x27;s confluence and the &quot;Great Raft&quot; of lodged driftwood, the expedition was stopped by the Spanish near present-day New Boston, Texas.

In 1806, Lieutenant Zebulon Pike, under orders to ascertain the source of the Red River, ascended the Arkansas River, made his way downstream on what turned out to be the Rio Grande, and was sent home by the Spanish authorities. A more successful exploration of the river&#x27;s upper reaches to both its sources came with the 1852 expedition under Capt. Randolph Barnes Marcy, assisted by Brevet Capt. George B. McClellan. (A decade later McClellan became an important general in the American Civil War.)

In April 1815, Captain Henry Miller Shreve was the first person to bring a steamboat, the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, up the Red River. Fulton and Livingston, who claimed the exclusive right to navigate Louisiana waters by steamboat, sued Shreve in the District Court of New Orleans. The judge ruled that the monopoly claimed by the plaintiffs was illegal. That decision, along with a similar outcome in &quot;Gibbons v. Ogden&quot;, freed navigation on every river, lake or harbor in the United States from interference by monopolies.

When John Quincy Adams became Secretary of State in 1817, one of his highest priorities was to settle with Spain the boundaries of the Louisiana Purchase. He negotiated with Luis de Onís, the Spanish Minister to the United States, and finally concluded the Adams–Onis Treaty, also known as the Treaty of 1819. The treaty defined the south bank of the river as the boundary between the United States and Spain, as of when it was surveyed and demarcated following 1819. That boundary continued to be recognized when Mexico gained its independence from Spain in 1821, and ongoingly when Texas became independent from Mexico in 1835–1836. It remained the official boundary until the United States Congress consented in October 2000 to the Red River Boundary Compact, which had been adopted in 1999 by the states of Oklahoma and Texas . This set the jurisdictional boundary between these states at the vegetation line on the south bank, leaving title of adjacent property owners at the south bank. (The Red River actively meanders, as shown by comparing current maps of the political boundaries with those defined by the river&#x27;s course decades ago.)

The Red River Campaign (March–May 1864) was fought along the Red River Valley in Louisiana during the American Civil War. It was part of a failed attempt by the Union to occupy eastern Texas. Confederate commander Richard Taylor succeeded in repelling an army under Nathaniel Banks that was three times bigger than his own.

In Louisiana, the area of present-day Natchitoches Parish was settled by French Creole and mixed-race Louisiana Creole people, starting before 1800. The Cane River National Heritage Area, with plantations and churches founded by Louisiana Creoles, marks this area of influence. Some of the sites are designated as destinations on the Louisiana African American Heritage Trail, established from 2008 onwards.

The area along the lower Red River of Grant Parish, Louisiana and neighboring parishes has a mixture of hill-country farms and cotton plantations.

===Great Raft===

In the early 19th century, settlers found that much of the river&#x27;s length in Louisiana was unnavigable because of a collection of fallen trees that formed a Great Raft over long. In 1839, Captain Henry Miller Shreve began clearing the log jam, but it was not completely cleared until the 1870s, when dynamite became available. The river was thereafter navigable, although north of Natchitoches it was restricted to small craft. Removal of the raft further connected the Red and Atchafalaya rivers, accelerating the development of the Atchafalaya River channel.

===&quot;Toll Bridge War&quot;===
The Red River Bridge War of 1931 was a boundary conflict between Oklahoma and Texas over an existing toll bridge and a new free bridge crossing the Red River. A joint project to build a free bridge between Durant, Oklahoma and Denison, Texas turned into a major dispute when the Governor of Texas blocked traffic from entering his state on the new bridge. The Red River Bridge Company of Texas owned the original toll bridge and had a dispute over its purchase deal. Oklahoma Governor William H. Murray sent the Oklahoma National Guard to reopen the bridge that July. Texas had to retreat when lawyers determined that Oklahoma had jurisdiction over both banks of the river.

===2015 Red River flood===
In June 2015, the Red River flooded parts of northeast Texas, southwest Arkansas, southeast Oklahoma and Louisiana, from Denison Dam, to just south of Alexandria, Louisiana. The river reached its highest level in over 70 years, cresting in most of the affected areas at around 6–9 feet over the flood levels. At 4 PM on June 9, the river reached its maximum height of 37.14 feet.

In 1943, Denison Dam was built on the Red River to form Lake Texoma, a large reservoir of , some north of Dallas. Other reservoirs on the river&#x27;s tributaries serve as flood control.

<doc id="194244" wikidata="Q204279" url="?curid=194244" title="Goran Ivanišević">
<text>Goran Ivanišević (; born 13 September 1971) is a Croatian former professional tennis player and current coach. He was ranked world No. 2 in men&#x27;s singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), in July 1994. Ivanišević won 22 ATP Tour-level singles titles, including the 2001 Wimbledon Championships. He is the only player to win a Wimbledon singles title as a wild card, achieving the feat while ranked world No. 125. He had previously been runner-up at Wimbledon in 1992, 1994, and 1998. Ivanišević was known for his powerful left-handed serve, and for almost two decades held the record for most aces at Wimbledon with 1,377 (before Roger Federer broke it in 2019). He was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2020.

Following his playing career, Ivanišević coached Marin Čilić from September 2013 to July 2016, leading Čilić to a major title at the 2014 US Open. He then coached Novak Djokovic from 2019 to 2024, leading Djokovic to nine major titles. He shortly coached Elena Rybakina in 2025, before ending the partnership due to Rybakina&#x27;s troubled relationship with her ex-coach Stefano Vukov.
== Career ==
Goran is the son of Gorana (née Škaričić) and Srđan Ivanišević. As a boy, he was trained by Jelena Genčić. He turned professional in 1988 and, later that year, with Rüdiger Haas, won his first career doubles title in Frankfurt. Although he focused mostly on his singles career, he also had some success in doubles, winning nine titles and reaching a career-high ranking of 20.

In 1989, as a qualifier he made the quarterfinals of the Australian Open. Ivanišević made his first significant impact on the tour in 1990, knocking Boris Becker out of the first round of the French Open men&#x27;s singles; he went on to reach the quarterfinals. He was also, with Petr Korda, the runner-up in the French Open men&#x27;s doubles. At that year&#x27;s Wimbledon, Ivanišević reached the semifinals, where he lost to Becker in four sets. Ivanišević also won his first tour singles title in 1990 at Stuttgart and helped Yugoslavia win the World Team Cup. He played in eight ties for Yugoslavia in the Davis Cup before quitting the team after the Croatian declaration of independence in 1991. Yugoslavia lost its subsequent tie against France 5–0.

Ivanišević quickly became known on the tour for his strong, attacking style of play and for an extremely powerful serve. For several years, he had more aces than anyone else on the tour. He was also known for occasional on-court temper tantrums—usually directed towards himself—and the volatility of the standard of his play. Ivanišević received death threats at the 1992 Australian Men&#x27;s Hardcourt Championships. He went on to win the tournament.

In 1992, Ivanišević surged his way into his first Wimbledon singles final, having defeated Ivan Lendl, Stefan Edberg, and Pete Sampras in succession. Ivanišević&#x27;s 6–7, 7–6, 6–4, 6–2 semifinal victory over Sampras was particularly impressive, with Ivanišević serving 36 aces and not even facing a break point in the entire match. In the final, Ivanišević faced Andre Agassi and was heavily favored to win; with both players attempting to win their first Grand Slam title. Agassi eventually won 6–7, 6–4, 6–4, 1–6, 6–4. In the fifth set, Ivanišević had a break point on Agassi&#x27;s serve at 3–3, but failed to convert it. In the final game of the match, Ivanišević served 2 double faults to start the game, even though he had only served 5 double faults in the entire match before that. Ivanišević&#x27;s ace count for the tournament (206) was the highest in Wimbledon history at the time, until Ivanišević beat his own record in 2001 with 213 aces. Ivanišević served 37 aces in the 1992 Wimbledon final against Agassi, while Agassi had 37 aces in the entire tournament. Later that summer at the Olympic Games in Barcelona, Ivanišević won bronze medals in both singles and doubles representing Croatia, a state that had only recently declared independence; he also served as flagbearer for the Croatian team at the opening ceremony. In order to earn his single bronze medal, he won four consecutive 5-sets matches. He also won four singles titles that year.

Ivanišević reached the Wimbledon final for the second time in 1994, where he was defeated by defending-champion Pete Sampras 7–6, 7–6, 6–0. Ivanišević reached his career-high singles ranking of world No. 2 in July that year.

In 1995, Ivanišević won the Grand Slam Cup, beating Todd Martin in the final 7–6, 6–3, 6–4. At Wimbledon, Ivanišević again lost in the semifinals to Sampras 6–7, 6–4, 3–6, 6–4, 3–6.

In 1996, Ivanišević won a career-best five singles titles in a calendar year. He reached the Grand Slam Cup final again, but this time lost to Becker in straight sets. Ivanišević also teamed with Iva Majoli to win the 1996 Hopman Cup for Croatia. That year Ivanišević also defeated Stefan Edberg to reach the semifinals of the U.S. Open, his first Grand Slam semifinal away from Wimbledon; the match was the last Grand Slam match of Edberg&#x27;s career. In the semifinals, Ivanišević fell again to Sampras, in four sets; Sampras would go on to defeat Michael Chang to win his fourth U.S. Open championship.

In April 1997, Ivanišević became the only player to defeat the &quot;king of clay&quot;, Thomas Muster, in a Davis Cup singles match on clay. Ivanišević defeated Muster, 6–7, 7–5, 6–7, 6–2, 7–5, despite Muster having won 112 of his previous 117 matches on clay going into the match. During 1997, Ivanišević also got back up to his career high ranking of world No. 2, although his ranking fell down to No. 15 by the end of the year.

In 1998, Ivanišević reached his third Wimbledon final, facing Sampras once again. Ivanišević started the match well, but failed to take set points which would have given him a two-set lead, and Ivanišević eventually lost to Sampras in five sets, 7–6, 6–7, 4–6, 6–3, 2–6.

Ivanišević finished runner-up in the French Open men&#x27;s doubles in 1999 (with Jeff Tarango). However, for much of 1999, 2000, and 2001, he struggled with a shoulder injury and his performance and world ranking began to slide steadily.

During his second round match at the 2000 Brighton International, Ivanišević was defaulted after he smashed all three of his rackets and had none available to complete the match. He told the Associated Press, &quot;At least when I&#x27;ve finished playing tennis, they&#x27;ll remember me for something...They&#x27;ll say, &#x27;There&#x27;s that guy who never won Wimbledon, but he smashed all his rackets.&#x27;&quot;

By the summer of 2001, Ivanišević was ranked the world No. 125. This was not sufficient to earn him an automatic place in the main draw at Wimbledon but, given his past record as a three-time runner-up, he was awarded a wild card for entry into the singles draw. He defeated former and future world No. 1 players Carlos Moyá, Andy Roddick and Marat Safin as well as Fredrik Jonsson and Greg Rusedski to reach the semifinal, beating home favourite Tim Henman in a five-set, rain-affected semifinal played over three days (7–5, 6–7, 0–6, 7–6, 6–3), considered a classic. With the win, he set up a match with the previous year&#x27;s runner-up and former US Open champion Patrick Rafter. It was Ivanišević&#x27;s first singles final since 1998. In a match lasting over three hours, Ivanišević defeated Rafter 6–3, 3–6, 6–3, 2–6, 9–7. Two months shy of his 30th birthday, Ivanišević became the lowest-ranked player and the first wild card entry to win Wimbledon. To date, he is the only male entrant to have won a Grand Slam singles title as a wild card. His Wimbledon success was rated sixteenth at the list of 100 Greatest Sporting Moments by a British television programme. Ivanišević dedicated his victory to Croatian basketball player Dražen Petrović.

On 10 July 2001, Ivanišević received a hero&#x27;s welcome in his home city of Split where a crowd of over 150,000 led by local and state dignitaries greeted him at the central harbor, with a parade of boats and fireworks, topped off by Ivanišević himself taking off his clothes and jumping into the sea. Later that year he received the BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year Award.

The 2001 Wimbledon title was the last grand slam (individual) win of Ivanišević&#x27;s career. He temporarily retired in 2002 due to shoulder surgery. He returned to tennis sparingly in the following years but, in 2004, retired after a third-round loss to Lleyton Hewitt at Wimbledon, held on the Centre Court, the scene of his greatest triumph.

In 2005, he was part of the Croatian Davis Cup team that won the Davis Cup, although he did not play.

== Football ==
Ivanišević played football for the Croatian team Hajduk Split in 2001. A supporter of English team West Bromwich Albion, he became a fan after the Midland club&#x27;s escape from Premiership relegation in 2005. He wore an Albion shirt whilst warming up prior to the 2006 BlackRock Masters final and finally watched his first match in December 2011, as West Bromwich Albion played Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road.

Ivanišević also participated in an exhibition match of the Croatian national team of 1998 versus the International football stars on 7 October 2002 in Zagreb. It was the last career match of Croatian midfielder and team captain Zvonimir Boban. Ivanišević scored the goal for 1–1 (the game ended 2–1 for the International stars).
==Playing style==

Ivanisevic was a serve and volleyer and played a fast, aggressive game suited to grass courts. He was known for his powerful and accurate left-handed serve, particularly his first serve that was clutch, and is widely considered one of the most dominant servers in the history of tennis. He often won entire games without the ball being returned.

Like many serve-and-volleyers, Ivanisevic&#x27;s return game and defence was weaker due to his powerful but inconsistent groundstrokes. On the backhand side, he would often use the slice instead of hitting with top-spin and use the chip-and-charge tactic to come to the net.

== Post-playing ==
===Senior tennis tour and other engagements===
Right after retiring from the ATP Tour in 2004, Ivanišević started playing on the ATP Champions Tour (seniors&#x27; circuit).

In 2005, he was a member of the Croatian team for the Davis Cup final against Slovakia in Bratislava, although he did not play. Croatia won the final 3–2. Ivanišević received a winner&#x27;s medal and his name was engraved on the trophy along with Mario Ančić, Ivo Karlović, Ivan Ljubičić and team captain Nikola Pilić.

In June 2006, he performed in the Calderstones Park tournament in Liverpool. In November of the same year, Ivanišević won the Merrill Lynch Tour of Champions tournament in Frankfurt, defeating John McEnroe 7–6(12), 7–6(1).

In 2007, Roger Federer, seeking his 5th consecutive Wimbledon title against Rafael Nadal in the final, practiced with Ivanišević. Federer said the practice session helped him against Nadal.

As of 2019, Ivanišević still takes part in tournaments on the seniors&#x27; circuit, and he is currently coaching Novak Djokovic.

On 17 July, Ivanišević faced Rafter once again in an exhibition match on 2019 Croatia Open Umag. The match was held to celebrate 18th &quot;birthday&quot; of the famous 2001 Wimbledon final in which Ivanišević won. Ivanišević won once again 6–4, 6–4. The Croatian Open Centre Court has also been renamed in Ivanišević&#x27;s honour.

===Investments===
Retiring in 2004 also allowed thirty-three-year-old Ivanišević to devote more attention to investing in the real estate and construction industries, which he had already been involved with since 1998, conducting the activities through the simultaneously registered Sport Line limited liability company based in Split, Croatia. Due to Ivanišević still being an active tennis player at the time of the venture&#x27;s launch, most of the company&#x27;s initial day-to-day business was handled by his father Srdjan. Their main activity was an ambitious undertaking—construction of a 65-unit luxury apartment building in the Split neighbourhood of Firule. Named &quot;Lazarica 2&quot;, the building&#x27;s construction was supposed to start in November 1998 and finish by late 2000. After many delays, the project finally completed in 2003, but dragged the company into debt due to many unsold units.

News of Ivanišević&#x27;s financial problems first appeared in the summer of 2005 after he talked about it in an interview with &quot;Globus&quot; newsmagazine, revealing Lazarica 2 to be a &quot;failed project&quot;, as well as admitting to being &quot;devoured by sharks&quot; after hastily getting into investments that in hindsight he viewed as &quot;jumping overnight from kindergarten to university&quot;. Later that year, he also talked to the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; about &quot;losing substantial amount of money&quot; in some of his investments.

By September 2006, after months of speculation, Ivanišević joined a group of investors—including active AC Milan footballer Dario Šimić, retired basketball player Ivica Žurić as well as businessmen Marijan Šarić, Mate Šarić, and Batheja Pramod—for a joint HRK93 million (~€12.5 million) investment into the added market capitalization of Karlovačka banka. Ivanišević, Šimić, and Žurić invested HRK19 million (~€2.5 million) each, thus each obtaining 9% ownership stake in the bank.

Ivanišević&#x27;s finances became news again in August 2010 after reports of his Sunseeker Predator 72 motor yacht being repossessed by Hypo Leasing Kroatien, a subsidiary of Hypo Alpe Adria Bank due to reportedly a full year of Ivanišević failing to meet his €12,000 monthly lease payments. Ivanišević would deny this, saying that the yacht was returned due to mechanical defect.

On 31 January 2013, after accumulating debts of HRK5.7 million (~€752,000), Ivanišević&#x27;s company Sport Line filed for bankruptcy settlement proceedings before the Croatian Trade Court. Among the list of entities the company reportedly owed money to is the Croatian government in the amount of HRK1.1 million (~€145,000). Additionally, even his real estate business, conducted through another limited liability company, Goran promocije, was in trouble, with its account blocked for over a year with debts of HRK1.14 million. According to Croatian media reports, as of his company&#x27;s 2013 bankruptcy proceedings, most of Ivanišević&#x27;s assets—such as his two Zagreb apartments, his ownership stake in Karlovačka banka, and his 40,000 m2 of land in Duilovo—were safe from being sold off or liquidated as he had already signed them over to either his wife Tatjana Dragović (the Zagreb apartments and bank stake) or his mother Gorana Ivanišević (the plot of land).

====Meje villa and Duilovo land controversy====
Soon after his memorable 2001 Wimbledon win and the next day&#x27;s rapturous hero&#x27;s homecoming with 150,000 people coming out to greet him in the Split harbour, Ivanišević purchased a derelict seaside property within the Marjan hill park/forest in the neighbourhood of Meje adjacent to the city centre. Simultaneously, he further bought an undeveloped 40,000 m2 plot of land in Duilovo on the city outskirts. Despite the city of Split urban development plan intending the attractively located area by the sea in Meje for public use, the tennis player successfully petitioned the city authorities into changing their plan thus opening the door for tearing down the existing dilapidated structure and instead building a private use 1,000 m2 modernist villa, which Ivanišević claimed would become his family home once he retires from playing tennis professionally. Furthermore, he managed to obtain approval for the land in Duilovo to be re-purposed from green to sporting usage. In his 2001 application submission to the Split city council, the Wimbledon champion tied the two construction projects together, asking to be allowed to build a private-use property in Meje while promising to &quot;give back to the citizens of Split and Croatian sports&quot; by building a youth tennis academy on the plot of land in Duilovo. Furthermore, Ivanišević&#x27;s application contained the following emotional appeal: &quot;It&#x27;s been a long time wish of mine to, at long last, settle down in the city of my birth, the home of my ancestors for centuries. I want to give permanence to my family&#x27;s residence and I want to do so not by spatial conquest but by building a contemporary villa&quot;.

Amid vociferous exchanges in the local Split-based press invoking &quot;civic pride&quot; and &quot;investor flight out of the city&quot;, including Ivanišević himself complaining about being &quot;chased out of Split to Zagreb&quot;, the Split city council granted its hometown hero, Wimbledon champion Ivanišević, a special status for both projects: his family home construction project in Meje and his tennis academy project in Duilovo.

By 2006, the construction of the new 1,500 m2 three-storey, five-bedroom villa designed by his relative, architect Vjeko Ivanišević on a 1,560 m2 plot of land was completed with extensive amenities such as an indoor and outdoor pool, Jacuzzi, sauna, weight room, and wine cellar. During the villa&#x27;s early-to-mid 2000s construction, when not in tournaments, Ivanišević (an active professional tennis player until 2004) spent most of his time in Zagreb where he had already been owning multiple residential properties. However, even after retiring in 2004, contrary to his earlier pronouncements, he never moved into the Split villa once it was complete in 2006, instead continuing to reside in Zagreb with his model girlfriend Tatjana Dragović.

By January 2008, the retired tennis player announced the sale of his Split villa, putting it on the market for HRK57 million (~€7 million). The move instantly provoked angry reactions in the Croatian public and Split-based media outlets with accusations of &quot;exploiting his hometown hero status&quot; and &quot;not only emotionally blackmailing his fellow &quot;Splićani&quot; but also outright lying to them&quot; being directed at Ivanišević.

After more than four years on the market and multiple re-listings with a lower asking price—including being offered in 2010 through the British real estate agency Savills that advertised it in the English press during fall 2010 as a high-end weekend escape property—the villa (that had been listed for HRK31 million as of summer 2011) was in May 2012 sold to the Hvar-born, Russia-based Croatian businessman Stefano Vlahović for an undisclosed amount widely speculated to be less than half of the amount Ivanišević originally asked for.

In addition to never using the villa as a family home, thus breaking the pledge made in his 2001 city of Split urban development plan change application, Ivanišević also failed to deliver on another promise he made in the same application—that of building a youth tennis academy in Duilovo. Instead, in 2012, the Split city authorities allowed the retired tennis player to once again re-purpose his 40,000 m2 Duilovo plot of land under the city development plan, this time for mixed usage, all of which was a prelude to Ivanišević selling the land in 2015 to the real estate developer Ciril Zovko.

===Sports administration===
In August 2005 Ivanišević got voted to be one of four vice-presidents of the Croatian Olympic Committee (HOO) working under president Zlatko Mateša.

===Coaching===
====Marin Čilić (2013—2016)====
In June 2013, in the wake of Marin Čilić&#x27;s doping-related nine-month suspension that came into effect in the middle of his 2013 Wimbledon participation, the player reached out to his compatriot Ivanišević to become his new coach. Čilić&#x27;s suspension was eventually reduced to 4 months.

Čilić won the 2014 US Open under Ivanišević&#x27;s guidance. The two split after the 2016 Wimbledon where Čilić lost a tough five-set quarterfinal match to Roger Federer having initially been up 2-sets-to-none.

====Tomáš Berdych (2016—2017)====
Only weeks after Ivanišević&#x27;s split with Čilić, Tomáš Berdych announced on 8 August 2016 via social media that Ivanišević will begin coaching him, starting at 2016 Western &amp; Southern Open.

In early June 2017, immediately after Berdych&#x27;s second round upset loss to unseeded Karen Khachanov at the 2017 French Open, the 14th-ranked ATP player Berdych fired his coach Ivanišević.

====Milos Raonic (2018—2019)====
In February 2018, the 31st-ranked ATP player and 2016 Wimbledon finalist Milos Raonic—having had his 2017 season marked by prolonged layoffs due to wrist and knee injury issues in addition to just coming off being eliminated from the Australian Open in a first round upset to unseeded Lukáš Lacko—looked to hire a new coach by holding separate trials with Jonas Björkman during the Delray Beach Open and Ivanišević during the Indian Wells Masters. Soon after, having made the semifinals at Indian Wells, Raonic hired Ivanišević.

Ivanišević coached Raonic until just before the 2019 Indian Wells Masters, when Raonic announced that he would be getting a new coach Fabrice Santoro. In a December 2019 interview, ten months removed from his collaboration with Raonic, Ivanišević (now coaching Novak Djokovic) described the experience of coaching Raonic as being &quot;filled with struggles due to lack of proper communication&quot;, likening it to &quot;talking to a wall&quot; and adding that Raonic should have gotten a psychiatrist instead of a coach.

====Novak Djokovic (2019—2024)====
On 30 June 2019, Novak Djokovic confirmed that he had added Ivanišević to his coaching team. Working alongside Djokovic&#x27;s existing coach Marian Vajda, Ivanišević&#x27;s first order of business was the 2019 Wimbledon. However, due to a previously agreed commitment—exhibition match versus Goran Prpić ahead of the 2019 Croatia Open in Umag—he could be with Djokovic at Wimbledon for only the first week of the tournament, thus missing Djokovic&#x27;s epic final win versus Roger Federer. Discussing his initial week-long interaction with Djokovic, Ivanišević praised the player&#x27;s &quot;perfectionism&quot;, stating to have felt &quot;wanted as a coach for the first time in a long time&quot; while simultaneously experiencing the &quot;pleasure of coaching an individual that asks questions and actually listens to and processes what you have to say&quot; and adding that he has &quot;tragically had a more meaningful and worthwhile communication with Djokovic in an hour than with Raonic in the entire year&quot;.

On 27 March 2024, Novak Djokovic announced their separation.

====Elena Rybakina (2025–)====
On 1 November 2024, Elena Rybakina confirmed that she had hired Ivanišević as her new coach, with the partnership set to begin with the 2025 WTA Tour.

== Personal life ==
During the early 1990s, several years after turning professional, young tennis player Ivanišević began dating the Croatian model and 1990 beauty pageant winner Daniela Mihalić, two years his senior. The couple soon moved in together, residing in his properties in both Split and Monte Carlo. The relationship ended in the mid 1990s after five years together; following the split, Mihalić would go on to marry football coach Nenad Gračan.

===Marriages===
In 1998, 27-year-old Ivanišević began dating 17-year-old Serbian-Croatian model Tatjana Dragović after reportedly seeing her on the cover of the &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; magazine&#x27;s September 1996 edition and subsequently obtaining her phone number by contacting her New York City-based modeling agency, Elite. Ivanišević married Dragović in 2009 and they have two children, Amber Maria and Emanuel. Their official divorce proceedings, reportedly initiated by Dragović, began in April 2013.

He has one child, Oliver, with his second wife .

His eldest son Emanuel is also playing tennis. In 2023, he has won U-16 Croatian doubles championships.

===Political endorsements===
====Support for Croat generals indicted for war crimes====
In July 2001, fresh off winning Wimbledon, Ivanišević reportedly joined 10 other prominent Croatian professional athletes in addressing the Croatian government and parliament via signing an open letter expressing their disapproval of the Croatian authorities&#x27; (under Prime Minister Ivica Račan) decision to co-operate with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in The Hague by handing over two Croatian Army generals indicted for crimes against humanity during Yugoslav Wars, Rahim Ademi and Ante Gotovina. Claiming to be speaking up out of &quot;human and moral obligation to our greatest heroes&quot;, the 11 athletes express being horrified at the Croatian government&#x27;s decision to hand over war crimes suspects, seeing it as an attempt to &quot;distort historical facts&quot; before concluding that the &quot;one and only truth is that Croatia was a victim [in the Yugoslav Wars] while its soldiers and generals were heroes&quot;. Among the other Croatian athletes that signed the letter were Zvonimir Boban, Alen Bokšić, Davor Šuker, Slaven Bilić, Igor Štimac, Aljoša Asanović, Dino Rađa, and Stojko Vranković.

The letter caused immediate reaction in Croatia, including (NSZ) sarcastically dismissing the signatories as &quot;pro athletes on their yachts and in their Ferraris [who] would certainly not be feeling the pain of resulting international political and economic sanctions inflicted upon Croatia were it to refuse co-operation with the ICTY&quot;. The reaction to the letter prompted Ivanišević&#x27;s father Srđan to come out with a claim that his son&#x27;s signature on the letter is a &quot;forgery designed to publicly embarrass him due to his well-known opposition to extradition of any Croats to the Hague tribunal&quot;. For his part, when asked about the signature, Ivanišević himself claimed &quot;to not remember signing it&quot; but that he nevertheless &quot;agrees with its points&quot;.

====Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ)====
Throughout 2007, ahead of the 2007 Croatian parliamentary election, retired tennis player Ivanišević participated in promoting the ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) of incumbent Prime Minister Ivo Sanader via personal appearances at campaign stops and in television ads.

At a late June 2007 rally at the Dražen Petrović Basketball Hall, where he arrived with his pregnant girlfriend Tatjana Dragović, Ivanišević addressed the crowd using tennis analogies: &quot;Over the previous 4 years, we [Croatia led by Sanader and the HDZ] learned the backhand, forehand, and baseline play; and in the last 10 years we&#x27;ve mastered the serve; now, we have to learn net play by being accepted into the European Union&quot;. Also endorsing the HDZ on this campaign trail were other prominent Croatian sporting figures such as retired basketball star Dino Rađa, active footballers Niko Kovač and Tomislav Butina, retired water polo player Zdeslav Vrdoljak, retired basketball players Franjo Arapović and Stojko Vranković, handball coach Lino Červar, retired handballer Slavko Goluža, football administrators Zdravko and Zoran Mamić, boxer Stipe Drviš, active water polo players Teo Đogaš, Mile Smodlaka, and Josip Pavić, and active handballers Ivano Balić, Petar Metličić, and Renato Sulić.

Weeks prior to the election, the HDZ released a number of television ads with the sporting figures endorsing the party. One such ad features Ivanišević delivering a tennis pun into the camera by stating that he &quot;trusts Sanader and his aces&quot;. In March 2008, months following the election that the HDZ had won, responding to an interview question about his motivation to endorse the HDZ, Ivanišević claimed to have been &quot;supporting PM Sanader, not the HDZ&quot;, adding that he believes in Sanader.

<text>More Specials is the second album by English ska band the Specials, released by 2 Tone Records in September 1980. After the success of the band&#x27;s debut album, band member Jerry Dammers assumed the role as the band&#x27;s leader and stirred them into expanding their 2 Tone sound into other genres of music, most prominently a lounge music and easy listening style inspired by Muzak. Several band members disagreed with Dammers&#x27; vision and brought their own influences to the album, including from northern soul and rockabilly, contributing to an eclectic sound palette. The relations between band members continued to sour into the album&#x27;s accompanying tour and most of the band departed in 1981.

The album features collaborations with the Go-Go&#x27;s members Belinda Carlisle, Charlotte Caffey, and Jane Wiedlin; Rhoda Dakar from the Bodysnatchers; and Lee Thompson from Madness. The lyrics on the album, as with the band&#x27;s debut album, are often intensely political. Upon its release, the album alienated some fans, but reached number 5 in the UK Albums Chart, while its singles reached the top 10 of the UK Singles Chart. The album also reached number 98 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart. Critics greeted the album with praise, where journalists felt the album marked a bold step for the band. It has been since cited as an influence on the trip hop genre in the 1990s, and has been re-released several times.

== Background ==

Formed in Coventry in 1977, the Specials were the originators of 2 Tone music, a style that mixed the Jamaican genres of ska and reggae with the attitude and energy of punk rock and a focus on politically and socially conscious lyrics. They began 2 Tone Records, partly named for the band&#x27;s multiracial line-up, on which they released their debut single &quot;Gangsters&quot; in 1979, which reached the UK Singles Chart top 10. The subsequent debut album &quot;The Specials&quot; (1979) was a critical and commercial success, while the &quot;Too Much Too Young&quot; EP released in early 1980 reached number one in the UK Singles Chart.

By early-mid-1980, after six months of touring, the band were physically exhausted and felt they could not sustain the large amount of energy required to be in the band, but they had a schedule to adhere to; Chrysalis Records, the owner of 2 Tone Records, were hurrying the band into recording their second album, while managers wanted the band to tour in Europe, Japan and the United States. Various deals, including large concerts, TV programmes and a feature film, also needed to be discussed. Bassist Horace Panter recalled: &quot;Decisions needed to be made, and all we wanted to do was sleep. We didn&#x27;t have any choice. We had to learn to enjoy the ride or get off, and nobody wanted to get off!&quot;

A new single was required, so the band released &quot;Rat Race&quot;, written by guitarist Roddy Byers as a critique on how privileged students &quot;would spend three years pissing it up in college, knowing full well that Daddy would get them a good job when they left no matter what.&quot; With Linton Kwesi Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Me Wan&#x27; Fi Go Rave&quot; as a musical starting point, band founder and keyboardist Jerry Dammers added a plucked piano intro inspired by John Barry, foreshadowing his primary direction on &quot;More Specials&quot;. The single was a success, reaching number 5 in the UK charts. Meanwhile, drummer John Bradbury wanted to record a solo single, a cover version of the northern soul track &quot;Sock It to &#x27;em J.B.&quot;, imagining the titular initials changing from James Bond to John Bradbury. The band recorded it with him at Tulse Hill, and though it was not released as a single, it did make it onto &quot;More Specials&quot;.

For the band&#x27;s second album, Dammers wanted to move the band&#x27;s sound forward, away from ska and towards new territory. He declared: &quot;It&#x27;s time for 2-Tone bands to begin getting experimental. Some of the home-grown ska has started to become a cliche. We&#x27;ve got to start all over again.&quot; He reflected years later: &quot;Ska was just a launching point. I didn&#x27;t want us to end up like Bad Manners.&quot; For Dammers, this change meant he could pursue his fascination with easy listening and mood music, both &quot;background sounds not designed for active listening, but which, if you paid attention, turned out to be weird, even creepy,&quot; according to writer Simon Reynolds. In particular, he was interested in Muzak. Band member Neville Staple said this was a reflection of the band&#x27;s constant touring abroad: &quot;We were in aeroplanes too much, man, and hotels! We were hearing that kind of elevator music, those drum-machine beats, everywhere we went. You soak up what surrounds you.&quot; In Dammers&#x27; own recollection, he had been inspired by listening to the styles while on tour in America in particular; in 2009, he reflected:
== Recording ==
Unlike the first Specials album, which was produced by Elvis Costello in a raw fashion, Jerry Dammers himself produced &quot;More Specials&quot; with Dave Jordan, except for &quot;Sock It to &#x27;em J.B.&quot; which was produced by Bradbury. It was recorded during summer 1980 at Coventry&#x27;s Horizon Studios and mixed at Wessex Studios in London. In contrast to the first album, &quot;More Specials&quot; was predominately crafted in the studio, as, in his pursuit of musical perfection, Dammers had become infatuated with the idea of a recording studio and the possibilities it presented for numerous overdubs and fine tuning. Consequently, &quot;More Specials&quot; is more producer-dominated than the band&#x27;s previous work. According to Panter, Dammers would listen to any music with an open mind, feeling that no matter whether he initially thought the music was good or bad, he would grow to like it with repeated plays. His ambition with &quot;More Specials&quot; was to destroy people&#x27;s preconceived ideas of good and bad music to the point where listeners would hear a record and &quot;won&#x27;t even know if they like it or not.&quot; Panter said the band&#x27;s intention was to become &quot;more international.&quot;
Several band members opposed Dammers&#x27; proposed &quot;Muzak-lounge jazz experiment&quot;. Byers was moving into a different direction in his fusions of ska with rockabilly, contributing to a difference of opinion which destroyed his friendship with Dammers. While Byers acknowledged Dammers as having had the determination and vision to start the band, he felt he wanted to dominate the band and &quot;run everything himself,&quot; with group manager Rick Rogers serving merely to interpret Dammers&#x27; ideas. The guitarist stated he wanted to start his own band to play his rockabilly-styled rock and roll, which would have been stylistically consistent with acts like Stray Cats who were becoming popular in London. Consequently, he had begun creating songs in punk rock and power pop styles, while Bradbury&#x27;s interest in northern soul remained intact, thus contributing to the varied sound of the final album.

Regardless, as Dammers was the band&#x27;s production mastermind, he dominated the recording. Byers reflected that, with &quot;More Specials&quot;, the Specials &quot;went from &quot;With the Beatles&quot; to &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s&quot; without doing &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;,&quot; a comment Panter found to be &quot;very pertinent,&quot; who noted that: &quot;[Dammers would] often say we&#x27;ve done that, now let&#x27;s do something else. And other people would say, hey we&#x27;ve got this great thing going on here, why are we doing something different? That was probably the beginning of the fracturing of the band.&quot; During recording, Dammers had a heated row with Bradbury, who wanted to do a &quot;2 Tone review, mixing ska, soul and reggae,&quot; which Panter also advocated. Recording was also hindered by outside interference, including when a journalist entered the studio to interview the band, who felt the interruption had sabotaged the &quot;vibe&quot; of the song they were working on. Further contributing factors to the dark tone of &quot;More Specials&quot; were the drink and drug-related issues within the band, racial squabbles in the audience of the band&#x27;s live shows and guitarist Lynval Golding being victim to a violent racist attack.

For his experiments in Muzak, the &quot;cheesy&quot; tone of the pre-recorded rhythms on Dammers&#x27; newly bought Yamaha home organ, especially the Latin-America rhythms, were integral to his vision. For the Muzak-style tracks, including &quot;Stereotypes&quot;, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stand It&quot; and &quot;International Jet Set&quot;, the band sacrificed the live &#x27;ensemble&#x27; recording of their first album for a &quot;one instrument at a time&quot; multitrack recording style, firstly laying down the keyboard and drum tracks, then adding bass, then guitar, and so on, contributing to a &quot;totally different feel to the music&quot; that Panter disliked.

== Composition ==
&quot;More Specials&quot; is more adventurous than the band&#x27;s debut, given the disparate influences of their members, and comprises an eclectic mix of songs written by different members, including Terry Hall&#x27;s first composition, several cover versions, Dammers&#x27; experiments in muzak and electronica and some &quot;rockabilly mod&quot; material from Byers. &quot;Louder Than War&quot; wrote that the album was &quot;ambitious and totally unique, expanding the group’s musical palette into areas never previously explored in &#x27;rock&#x27; music,&quot; citing the inclusion of gloomy lounge, dub reggae, muzak, dark exotica, calypso, bossa nova, northern soul and Spaghetti Western music. The group also incorporated inflections of jazz and soul into their sound, and flourishes of Mariachi flugelhorn are provided by guest musician Dick Cuthell. Simon Reynolds described the record as a &quot;ragbag of revivalisms&quot; and &quot;a motley compromise&quot; between band members. &quot;More Specials&quot; is split into two distinct sides; Panter stated that side one is the &quot;songs side&quot; and side two is the &quot;muzak side.&quot;

The album is nonetheless dominated by Dammers and his Muzak-inspired direction, to the extent where &quot;The Rough Guide to Rock&quot; considers the record to be a venture into lounge music, while critic Scott Plagenhoef describes the album as &quot;lounge-inspired post-punk.&quot; Dammers saw his contributions as &quot;a DIY punk appropriation of Muzak.&quot; His preferential musical textures on &quot;More Specials&quot; are, according to Nick Reynolds of BBC Music, &quot;odd and particularly British,&quot; citing the &quot;basic rhythm boxes, brass sections in full cry, and a variety of cheesy keyboards and fairground and cinema organs.&quot; The record has also been described as avant-pop. Contrasting the often upbeat music, the record&#x27;s lyrics are comparably bleak, depicting English life &quot;in all its drab, suffocating despair and there&#x27;s no way out,&quot; according to Nick Reynolds. John Lewis of &quot;Uncut&quot; wrote that, compared to the &quot;teenage male fear writ large&quot; on the band&#x27;s first album, &quot;More Specials&quot; &quot;presents a dread that’s more existential than adolescent.&quot; Critic Vivien Goldman nonetheless commented that the band&#x27;s bleak world view is presented with humour: &quot;This may be the funniest record of 1980.&quot;

===Side one===

Side one is eclectic, incorporating energetic ska (&quot;Enjoy Yourself&quot;), northern soul (&quot;Sock It to &#x27;em J.B.&quot;), reggae (&quot;Do Nothing&quot;) and a &quot;kitsch singalong&quot; (&quot;Pearl&#x27;s Cafe&quot;). The album is bookended by two cover versions of music hall standard &quot;Enjoy Yourself (It&#x27;s Later than You Think).&quot; Nick Reynolds writes that the irony behind recording the song is &quot;very black indeed.&quot; In the version that opens the album, the song is upbeat, with inventive drumming from Bradbury, but ironically hints at the nation&#x27;s then-fear of a potentially impending nuclear war. Indicating the band&#x27;s move away from ska, the song&#x27;s horn arrangements are said by Goldman to &quot;evoke Bernard Herrmann and the Northern Dance Orchestra more than the cool jerk at Studio One.&quot;

&quot;Man at C&amp;A&quot;, Hall&#x27;s first composition, also shares a theme of nuclear war with its lyrics addressing doomsday, and was described by Simon Reynolds as a &quot;film soundtrack/Muzak fusion.&quot; The song includes a horn arrangement inspired by Nelson Riddle and &quot;explosion&quot; sounds from Bradbury&#x27;s synthesised drums. Bradbury&#x27;s interest in new technology, including synthesised drums, provided a foil to most of the other band members, who preferred simplistic live recording. Lee Thompson of Madness contributes saxophone solos to &quot;Hey, Little Rich Girl&quot;, which concerns an aspiring young woman whose career detours into pornography after moving to London.

&quot;Do Nothing&quot; sharply warns about the &quot;dangers of obliviousness&quot;, although its searching lyrics are contrasted with the upbeat, laidback rhythm. Peter Chick of &quot;The Guardian&quot; noted that &quot;[t]he track might conjure a blissful, muzak-smooth, easy-listening utopia, but – as seemed to be &quot;More Specials&quot;&#x27; bleak theme – underneath the surface, everything was fucked up.&quot; &quot;Pearl&#x27;s Cafe&quot; features future Specials vocalist Rhoda Dakar, then of the Bodysnatchers, dueting with Hall, and lyrically comments on the country&#x27;s frustration, with one critic particularly noting the line: &quot;It&#x27;s all a load of bollocks, and bollocks to it all.&quot; Bradbury&#x27;s northern soul tribute &quot;Sock It to &#x27;em J.B.&quot; was updated via saxophone work from Paul Haskett, who applies a 1960s kitsch sound to proceedings.

=== Side two ===

Side two sees the album enter into more radical territory, dominated by Dammers&#x27; infatuation for exotica and film scores. Throughout this side, Dammers plays rhythms in the styles of cha-cha, beguine and bossa nova on his Yamaha home organ. &quot;Stereotypes/Stereotypes Pt. 2&quot; blends lounge, dub and Spaghetti Western music and features complex chord circles that have been compared to Bach. The track begins with exotica sounds, a &quot;chintzy&quot; drum machine beat and ominously harmonised vocals from Hall, Golding and Staple. In the song&#x27;s second part, it transforms into an extended dub section with Dammers&#x27; ringing synth figures, Byers&#x27;s flamenco notes and drum machine beats rubbing with echo-laden snare drums. Lyrically, it concerns a slacker who drinks heavily and then crashes his car in a police chase. &quot;Holiday Fortnight&quot; is an instrumental flavoured by Mexican and calypso music, whereas &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stand It&quot; contains cool jazz licks, and was one of the first songs Dammers had ever written.

&quot;International Jet Set&quot; is a bleak psychedelic track in an exotica and &quot;elevator music&quot; style with a sitar-style groove and lucid synths. Lyrically, Hall narrates a personal nervous breakdown on a McDonnell Douglas DC-10 aeroplane in which he talks of the misery of life and his alienation, before the sound of a captain announcing over the PA that the plane is to take a crash landing, presumably killing its passengers. According to Simon Price of &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, the wider message is explicit: &quot;There’s no one driving. This is the late 20th century and the lunatics have their fingers on the red button. We’re alone. We’re all going to die. Brrrr.&quot; The reprise of &quot;Enjoy Yourself&quot; that closes the album is a collaboration with the Go-Go&#x27;s and is slower and broodier than the first version, transforming the song into &quot;a wry cynicism worthy of &#x27;Threepenny Opera&#x27; or similar Brecht/Weill cabaret collaborations,&quot; according to Goldman.

== Release and promotion ==
With photography from Carol Starr and Chalkie Davies, the album cover of &quot;More Specials&quot; depicts a &quot;cheesy&quot; out-of-focus colour photograph of the band snapped in the bar of the former Regent Hotel in Leamington Spa. Dammers asked Davies to take a deliberately bad, out-of-focus picture reminiscent of the album sleeves of Jamaican artists like King Tubby. Simon Reynolds felt this colour sleeve &quot;announced the end of the black-and-white 2-Tone aesthetic,&quot; even noting that some of the band are smiling, compared to the serious facial expressions on the first album&#x27;s sleeve. The identity of the woman on the sleeve was for many years unknown, with many fans wrongly identifying her as Rhoda Dakar. She was later revealed as Pat Bailey; in a 2023 interview, she revealed that she was a neighbour of Neville Staple&#x27;s and was paid £200 for her appearance. In September 1980, the first single from the album, a double A-side of &quot;Stereotypes&quot; and &quot;International Jet Set&quot;, was released to present the band&#x27;s new &quot;post-ska&quot; sound. It reached number 6 in the UK Singles Chart in September. Released several months later, the second single &quot;Do Nothing&quot; reached number 4 on the chart in December. &quot;Rat Race&quot;, included on the American edition of the album, reached number 89 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Club Play Singles chart.

&quot;More Specials&quot; was released on 19 September 1980 in the United Kingdom by 2 Tone Records. Although the band&#x27;s new direction bewildered some of their fan base, the album was a commercial success, reaching number 5 on the UK Albums Chart and staying on the chart for 20 weeks. It was ultimately certified Gold by the British Phonographic Industry. In the United States, where it was released by Chrysails Records with &quot;Rat Race&quot; added to the track listing, it reached number 98 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album also made the top 30 in New Zealand and Sweden. It has been re-released several times, including by 2 Tone as an LP in 1987, by Chrysalis as a CD in 1989, again by Chrysalis as a remastered CD in 2002 and more recently as a 2CD deluxe edition by 2 Tone in March 2015, adding a range of bonus material to the album.

Coinciding with the album&#x27;s release, the Specials began the More Specials Tour in autumn 1980, but the conflicts between band remembers that had surfaced during the album&#x27;s recording sessions continued to develop throughout the tour, with relations between members being the worst they had ever been. Dammers recalled band members becoming tired and constantly feeling under pressure, and throughout the tour, they watched &quot;the country falling apart&quot; as shops throughout the British towns and cities they played became shuttered up and closed down: &quot;Margaret Thatcher had apparently gone mad, she was closing down all the industries, throwing millions of people on the dole. We could actually see it by touring around. You could see that frustration and anger in the audience. In Glasgow, there were these little old ladies on the streets selling all their household goods, their cups and saucers. It was unbelievable. It was clear that something was very, very wrong.&quot;

The scenes they saw inspired the lyrics of their subsequent unemployment-themed non-album single, &quot;Ghost Town&quot; (1981), a critically acclaimed hit which musically mixes reggae with Dammers&#x27; continued experimentation with easy listening and programme music, and which reached number one during the 1981 England riots. The popularity of the song was not enough to rebuild relations within the band, and most of the members left later on in 1981, leaving only Dammers and Bradbury, who thereafter added new members and changed the band&#x27;s name to The Special AKA.

== Critical reception ==
Critical reception to &quot;More Specials&quot; was very favourable, with Vivien Goldman of the &quot;NME&quot;, John Orme of &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, Mike Gardner of &quot;Record Mirror&quot; and Garry Bushell of &quot;Sounds&quot; all praising the album and considering it a bold step for the band. In the words of Panter, they wrote of how it was a &quot;[break] away from a safe-ska stance, redefining dance music for the eighties (dance muzak for the eighties, to be precise).&quot; In the &quot;NME&quot;, Goldman felt that &quot;[f]ans expecting more frenetic ska re-runs will do a treble-flip when they hear the conglomerate of Zhivago-esque movie soundtracks and other much-maligned musics the Specials have re-validated. Their energy has become more sensual, too, less St Vitus&#x27;s dance, more mellow hip-grind.&quot; She wrote that she would play side two &quot;more than any other 2 Tone artefact&quot; and concluded that &quot;The Specials&#x27; maturing process is a proper tonic.&quot;

In &quot;Smash Hits&quot;, David Hepworth felt the decision the change in direction was wise and called the record &quot;[a]n original and highly intelligent album that suggests The Specials can keep it up if you can.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; complimented the lyrics as &quot;uniformly excellent whether they&#x27;re speaking of love or a tribute to James Bond.&quot; In his &quot;Record Guide&quot;, Robert Christgau was somewhat less receptive, saying that although &quot;they make the ska sound their own by synthesizing its trippy beat and their own inborn vocal attenuation into a single formal principle--a platonic ideal of fun,&quot; this becomes so conspicuous on side two that &quot;the result is so light it&#x27;s almost ethereal, political consciousness and all.&quot;

Among retrospective reviews, Jo-Ann Greene of AllMusic reflected that the album was &quot;an intensely satisfying set in its day, even if it wasn&#x27;t as centered as their debut.&quot; In &quot;Uncut&quot;, John Lewis complimented the lyrical &quot;dread that&#x27;s more existential than adolescent,&quot; but felt &quot;the most interesting development is the sonic shift from monochrome into Technicolor.&quot; Simon Tucker of &quot;Louder Than War&quot; agreed that &quot;More Specials&quot; documents the point &quot;where the band widen their palette even further with the black and white replaced by rainbow,&quot; and felt that it was a shame that the album &quot;signposts what could have been if the band had managed to stay together, but maybe they’d said all they could have as a unit by this time.&quot; In his review for BBC Music, Nick Reynolds said that the album &quot;has lots of quality, and is almost a classic,&quot; while Martin C. Strong of &quot;The Great Rock Bible&quot; felt the album proved the Specials &quot;were no one trick pony.&quot; Less favourable were &quot;Trouser Press&quot;, who bemoaned the &quot;more turgid experimental approach.&quot;

===Accolades===
At the end of 1980, it was named the year&#x27;s 32nd best album by the &quot;NME&quot;, and 31st best by &quot;OOR&quot;. In 1995, &quot;Melody Maker&quot; included it in a list of &quot;great lost albums,&quot; having been chosen for inclusion by Simon Price, who wrote an accompanying essay for the album&#x27;s entry. The album was included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In 1987, &quot;Rockdelux&quot; named it the 91st best album released between 1980 and 1986. In 2003, &quot;Mojo&quot; included in their list of the &quot;Top 50 Eccentric Albums,&quot; while in 2007 they included in their list of &quot;The 80 Greatest Albums of the 80s.&quot; In 2006, Garry Mulholland included it in &quot;Fear of Music: The 261 Greatest Albums Since Punk and Disco&quot;. It is listed in Amy Britton&#x27;s book &quot;Revolution Rock: The Albums Which Defined Two Decades&quot;. Steve Taylor wrote in &quot;The A to X of Alternative Music&quot; that the Specials &quot;made the music less obviously antagonistic and as a result more powerfully brooding.&quot;

==Legacy==
Ranking Roger of fellow 2 Tone band the Beat poses &quot;More Specials&quot; as one of the reasons why the Beat became more musically adventurous on their second album &quot;Wha&#x27;ppen?&quot; (1981). He recalled that, unlike the &quot;punkish with an edge&quot; sound of the inaugural Specials album, &quot;More Specials&quot; &quot;was like Muzak, hotel music! Obviously they’d been on the road too long, that’s what we thought. We thought they’ve been on the road too long cause this is the kind of music we hear in them hotels when we tour round America – everywhere! But it still had a message and that was really successful for them. And maybe it was more successful for them because they challenged to change.&quot; He told one interviewer, &quot;[&quot;More Specials&quot;] was more like muzak and Spanish music and we thought, &#x27;hey up what&#x27;s going on? It&#x27;s modern cowboy music or something?&#x27; – but people still got into it, they still think of it as a classic.&quot;

Music critic Jon Harrington wrote that the &quot;eclectic mixture of styles&quot; on &quot;More Specials&quot; influenced 1990s trip hop acts including Massive Attack and Portishead, while the revival of interest for easy listening in the mid-1990s could be traced back to Dammers&#x27; work on &quot;More Specials&quot;. Blur were also influenced by &quot;More Specials&quot;, and some critics have compared several Blur songs to the album; Ian Wade of &quot;The Quietus&quot; felt the &quot;spectral gloom&quot; of &quot;More Specials&quot; resides &quot;like a shadow&quot; over Blur&#x27;s fourth album &quot;The Great Escape&quot; (1995), most notably on the &quot;kitchen-sink-ska&quot; of &quot;Fade Away&quot;, while &quot;Best Days&quot; and &quot;He Thought of Cars&quot; from the same album were said by Scott Plagenhoef of &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; to develop upon the &quot;lounge-inspired post-punk&quot; of &quot;More Specials&quot;. Wade also cites the B-sides &quot;Supa Shoppa&quot; (1994) and especially &quot;The Horrors&quot; (1995) as further examples, the latter song combining &quot;a cheap tango rhythm-preset with schoolhouse piano to push &quot;More Specials&quot;&#x27; postcard bleakness into something approaching existential dread.&quot; Orbital sampled &quot;Man at C&amp;A&quot; on the song &quot;Are We Here?&quot; from &quot;Snivilisation&quot; (1994).

Panter originally felt the album had a strong &quot;beyond cynicism&quot; vibe that seemed &quot;angry at its own impotence. It didn&#x27;t seem to care.&quot; He did not listen to the album for 20 years &quot;because it just reminds me of that time when the band was just falling to bits because it was exhausted.&quot; Upon revisiting the album, he found it to be inferior to the band&#x27;s debut album but noted &quot;it really stands up. Some of the songs are my favourites – &#x27;Man at C&amp;A&#x27;, I love &#x27;International Jet Set&#x27; and &#x27;Enjoy Yourself&#x27; has become anthemic these days.&quot; The band were considering commemorating the album&#x27;s 35th anniversary in some fashion in 2015, but these plans did not materialise.

<text>Harry Frederick Oppenheimer OMSG (28 October 1908 – 19 August 2000) was a prominent South African businessman, industrialist and philanthropist. Oppenheimer was often ranked as one of the wealthiest people in the world, and was considered South Africa&#x27;s foremost industrialist for four decades. In 2004 he was voted 60th in the SABC3&#x27;s Great South Africans.

==Early life and education==
He was born in Kimberley, on 28 October 1908 to Jewish parents, May (née Pollak; 1886–1934), and Ernest Oppenheimer (1880 -1957). His paternal grandparents and maternal grandmother were German Jews, whereas his maternal grandfather was Czech Jewish from Mikulov.His parents married in London in a Jewish ceremony in the Reform tradition. His &quot;Brit Milah&quot; was performed by Rabbi Harris Isaacs of the Griqualand West Jewish Congregation. He spent his first seven years in Kimberley and attended the Kimberley Shul. Successive generations of his family believe that he had a &quot;Bat Mitzvah&quot; when he turned 13 in 1921.

After completing his primary schooling in Johannesburg, he attended Charterhouse School in England, before going on to study at Christ Church, Oxford, graduating in 1931 in Philosophy, Politics and Economics. In the same year he returned to Johannesburg, and settled in Brenthurst, the private estate built by his father, Ernest.

==Career==
Harry Oppenheimer was the chairman of Anglo American Corporation for 25 years and chairman of De Beers Consolidated Mines for 27 years until he retired from those positions in 1982 and 1984 respectively. 

In his 1983 &quot;The New York Times&quot; interview with Oppenheimer, Joseph Lelyveld wrote that Oppenheimer &quot;more than anyone else has managed to preserve and strengthen the economic ties binding Johannesburg to Western financial centers.&quot;

He was also politically engaged, opposing racial discrimination and police-state methods during the apartheid era. He was a reformist in that he supported full trade union rights for black workers: &quot;I do not believe that blacks will ever be brought to accept that the organisation of labor which is regarded as right and necessary for white workers, not only in South Africa but throughout the Western world, is not suitable for them.&quot; He served as Member of Parliament for Kimberley (1948 to 1957) with the United Party. He also became the opposition spokesman on economics, finance and constitutional affairs. In the 1970s and 1980s he subsequently financed the anti-apartheid Progressive Federal Party that later merged into the Democratic Alliance. In September 1985, he was one of 91 business leaders that signed a newspaper advertisement calling for an end to apartheid and negotiations with &quot;acknowledged black leaders&quot; on power sharing.

Oppenheimer also maintained cordial relations with African statesmen, such as Zambia&#x27;s Kenneth Kaunda, dining at their official residences. He had more distant relations with the leadership of the ruling National Party in South Africa. In 1982 his house guest was Henry Kissinger and when the pair were invited by P.W. Botha to the Official residence, Libertas, it was the first time that he had dined there since 1948.

Through De Beers, he maintained extensive business interests on the continent, with diamond mines operating in Botswana, Namibia, Tanzania and Angola. Anglo American was also the premier company in neighbouring Zimbabwe. In a special agreement with the Soviet Union, De Beers sold Soviet diamonds through a London-based organisation. In the 1970s and 1980s, Oppenheimer capital was also used to found or purchase many businesses in Europe, the United States and Australia.

==Philanthropy==
Oppenheimer visited Israel for the first time in 1968, meeting statesman David Ben Gurion. He made several other visits, visiting Yad Vashem and met with Prime Minister Menachem Begin. He became a generous benefactor of the country. He personally directed that Israel receive the necessary diamond raw products from De Beers to establish itself as one of the world&#x27;s diamond polishing and exporting countries. He remained a supporter of Jewish causes during his entire life. He authorised the flow of diamonds to Israel&#x27;s important diamond-sorting and diamond-cutting industry. 

The Harry Oppenheimer Agricultural High School in Limburg, Limpopo is named in his honour in recognition of the funds he provided for its establishment.

The Harry Oppenheimer Fellowship Award, Africa&#x27;s premier research prize, is awarded every year by the Oppenheimer Memorial Trust, in memory of Harry Oppenheimer&#x27;s commitment to an ideal of &quot;unambiguous excellence.&quot;

==Personal life==
He married Bridget (née McCall) in 1943 and converted to Anglicanism.

He was a South African Freemason.

He died on 19 August 2001. His funeral was held at St. George&#x27;s Church, an Anglican church where he had been a parishioner. A number of cabinet ministers and business leaders were also in attendance. Future president Cyril Ramaphosa said: &quot;He did well in advancing he causes of many people.&quot;

===Family===
His son, Nicky Oppenheimer, became Deputy Chairman of Anglo American Corporation in 1983 and Chairman of De Beers in 1998. His daughter, Mary Slack, resides predominantly at Brenthurst, but has houses in Muizenberg and London, England, and Wilgerbosdrift stud farm in the Western Cape.

===Residences===
His main residence was the Brenhurst Estate in Parktown in Johannesburg.

Oppenheimer also required a Cape Town residence during his time as an MP, and in 1948 he purchased a cottage on Buitencingel street in the City Bowl.
In 1968, he built Milkwood, a seaside villa in uMhlanga, north of Durban. His wife, Bridget, was robbed at knifepoint at the home in 2008.

Oppenheimer later purchased an apartment in the Carlyle Hotel, an Art Deco luxury hotel on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.

==Honours==
Kimberley conferred Freedom of the City on Oppenheimer on 4 September 1973 as a tribute to &quot;an illustrious son of the city&quot; who continued to promote Kimberley as &quot;the diamond centre of the world.&quot;

Harry Oppenheimer Diamond Museum in Ramat Gan, Israel, was founded in 1986 to present his life and career.

<text>Shanghai Knights is a 2003 martial arts action comedy film. It is the sequel to &quot;Shanghai Noon&quot;, and the second installment of the &quot;Shanghai&quot; film series. Directed by David Dobkin and written by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, it stars Jackie Chan, Owen Wilson, Fann Wong, Donnie Yen and Aidan Gillen.

It was released in the United States on February 7, 2003. The film received mixed reviews but it performed well at the box office.

==Plot==
In 1887, Lord Nelson Rathbone leads a band of Boxers into the Forbidden City, stealing the Imperial Seal of China and mortally wounds its Keeper. Before dying, the Keeper gives his daughter Chon Lin a puzzle box for her brother, Chon Wang. In Carson City, Nevada, Wang is now sheriff. He receives the box and a letter from Lin, telling him of their father&#x27;s death and that she has tracked his killer to London.

Wang travels to New York City to find his old partner Roy O&#x27;Bannon and collect his share of their gold so that he can buy passage to London. Roy has left law enforcement, invested all the gold, and is now a waiter and gigolo. Following a series of misunderstandings, the pair ship themselves to London in a crate.

In London, Roy&#x27;s pocket is picked by a youth named Charlie, leading to a massive brawl; Roy and Wang are arrested. In Scotland Yard, the two quickly befriend Inspector Artie Doyle and are released. Artie shows them that Lin is in custody for attempting to kill Rathbone. Roy is instantly smitten with Lin. Wang and Roy reunite with Charlie and acquire an invitation to a gala at Rathbone&#x27;s country estate.

Roy and Wang infiltrate the gala in disguise, and follow Rathbone to a private library, where he slips through a secret passage. Lin, having escaped prison, arrives and saves Roy from Boxer guards. The three see Rathbone give the Imperial Seal to Wu Chow, the illegitimate brother of the Emperor of China. After a brief struggle, Charlie steals the seal. Everyone escapes and Wang, Roy and Lin make their way to Whitechapel.

At a brothel, Roy is devastated when he overhears Wang try to convince Lin that Roy is an unsuitable husband. Wang, Roy, and Lin are found and captured by Rathbone, who reveals his plan: In exchange for the seal, Wu Chow will kill the British royal family with a prototype machine gun and frame Lin. Rathbone, tenth in line for the throne, will become king. Roy and Wang reconcile and manage to escape.

Wang and Roy consult Artie about Charlie&#x27;s location. Artie deduces that Charlie is at Madame Tussauds. They save him from the Boxers, but are forced to hand over the seal in exchange for Charlie&#x27;s life. Roy and Wang are arrested, but Charlie rescues them and reveals that his full name is Charlie Chaplin. Roy and Wang free Lin and stop the assassination, killing Wu Chow with fireworks. The three pursue Rathbone to the top of Big Ben. Wang is able to throw Rathbone through the face of the clock, killing him.

Roy, Wang, and Artie are knighted for saving the royal family. Artie decides to become a writer and creates the character Sherlock Holmes based on the disguise Roy wore at the gala. Wang opens the box his father sent him to find a message reminding him of the importance of family. Roy proposes that he and Wang go to Hollywood to join the new motion picture industry. Charlie stows away in their carriage as they drive off.

==Production==

Director David Dobkin was personally chosen by Jackie Chan. Dobkin had a difficult time choosing a suitable Asian actress who could do movement work, emote well and speak excellent English. He then saw clips of Fann Wong&#x27;s videos &quot;Wo lai ye&quot; (2001) and &quot;Qing she yu bai she&quot; (2001) and asked to audition her in London, which she did. She got the role and the number of scenes with her in was increased by thirty percent. According to Jackie Chan&#x27;s memoir &quot;Never Grow Up&quot;, Faye Wong from his native city Hong Kong was his first choice, but Fann Wong was incorrectly hired instead.

Aside from establishing shots of iconic English landmarks, including The House of Lords, Buckingham Palace and Madame Tussaud&#x27;s, the scenes in London were largely filmed in Prague, Czech Republic from February 4 to June 21, 2002.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;Shanghai Knights&quot; received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for the chemistry between Chan and Wilson, the action sequences, and the fun nature of the film, but strong criticism for the plot.

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 65% based on 150 reviews, with an average rating of 6.1/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;A silly, anachronistic mess, but the pairing of Chan and Wilson makes the movie fun.&quot;

On Metacritic, the film has a score of 58 out of 100, based on reviews from 33 critics. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;B+&quot; on scale of A to F.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun Times&quot; gave the film three out of four stars, calling it &quot;fun in a broad, genial way&quot;, but disapproved of the &quot;entirely arbitrary&quot; plot.
Joe Leydon of &quot;Variety&quot; found it better than its predecessor: &quot;A hugely entertaining and more lavishly mounted follow-up to 2000&#x27;s &quot;Shanghai Noon&quot;, the high-concept East-meets-Western that first teamed [the] top-billed duo pic rides even taller in the saddle as a fleet and funny crowd-pleaser.&quot; Elvis Mitchell of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave a positive review, singling out Chan&#x27;s fight sequences and Wilson&#x27;s performance, noting how &quot;Wilson gets to steal a part of the movie that Chan is smart enough not to want.&quot; Mitchell also praised the &quot;bluntly gorgeous&quot; cinematography, and said Chan&#x27;s reputation is &quot;resuscitated in the rousing, cheerful sequel&quot;, calling it &quot;one of his best.&quot; Nathan Rabin of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; also praised the chemistry between the two leads, writing, &quot;Chan [...] found the perfect screen buddy in Wilson.&quot; Rabin criticized the &quot;thin&quot; plot, but found &quot;there&#x27;s a greatest-hits element&quot; to Chan&#x27;s fight scenes.

==Planned sequel==
MGM announced in May 2015 that they were moving forward with &quot;Shanghai Dawn&quot;. Jackie Chan, Owen Wilson, and Fann Wong are expected to reprise their roles as Chon Wang, Roy O&#x27;Bannon, and Chon Lin respectively. In September 2016, Jared Hess signed on as director for the film, while both Millar and Gough would develop a screen story with Theodore Riley and Aaron Buchsbaum writing the script for the film.

Gough said the third film will be set in China because Chan &quot;wants to showcase China in the way that the first film showcased the old West&quot;. Gough added that Chan and Wilson also have a hand in the creative process: &quot;With those films, the collaboration of Jackie and Owen comes out on screen as they get along very well. With that in mind, you want to get their input in the story phase, so that when we got to script, it&#x27;s based into the DNA of the story.&quot;

In 2024, Gough later revealed that the sequel will most likely never happen as Chan seemed to lose interest in producing it. He further revealed that the plot would have picked up from where the last film left off with Chon Wang now a Hollywood stunt man. He would receive news that Roy O&#x27;Bannon was in Mexico with revolutionaries and would team back up with him.

<text>A boy is a young male human. The term is commonly used for a child or an adolescent. When a male human reaches adulthood, he is usually described as a man.

==Definition, etymology, and use==
According to the &quot;Merriam-Webster Dictionary&quot;, a boy is &quot;a male child from birth to adulthood&quot;.

The word &quot;boy&quot; comes from Middle English &quot;boi, boye&quot; (&quot;boy, servant&quot;), related to other Germanic words for &quot;boy&quot;, namely East Frisian &quot;boi&quot; (&quot;boy, young man&quot;) and West Frisian &quot;boai&quot; (&quot;boy&quot;). Although the exact etymology is obscure, the English and Frisian forms probably derive from an earlier Anglo-Frisian *&quot;bō-ja&quot; (&quot;little brother&quot;), a diminutive of the Germanic root *&quot;bō-&quot; (&quot;brother, male relation&quot;), from Proto-Indo-European *&quot;bhā-&quot;, *&quot;bhāt-&quot; (&quot;father, brother&quot;). The root is also found in Norwegian dialectal &quot;boa&quot; (&quot;brother&quot;), and, through a reduplicated variant *&quot;bō-bō-&quot;, in Old Norse &quot;bófi&quot;, Dutch &quot;boef&quot; &quot;(criminal) knave, rogue&quot;, German &quot;Bube&quot; (&quot;knave, rogue, boy&quot;). Furthermore, the word may be related to &quot;Bōia&quot;, an Anglo-Saxon personal name.

===Specific uses===
====Race====
Historically, in the United States and South Africa, &quot;boy&quot; was used not only for domestic servants but also more generally as a disparaging term for black men; the term implied a subservient status. Thomas Branch, an early African-American Seventh-day Adventist missionary to Nyassaland (Malawi) referred to the native students as &quot;boys&quot;: Multiple politicians – including New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and former Kentucky Congressman Geoff Davis – have been criticized publicly for referring to a black man as &quot;boy&quot;.

During an event promoting the 2017 boxing bout between Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Conor McGregor, the latter told the former to &quot;dance for me, boy.&quot; The remarks led several boxers – including Mayweather and Andre Ward – as well as multiple commentators to accuse McGregor of racism.

==Biology==
===Sex determination===

Human sex is determined at fertilization when the genetic sex of the zygote is determined by whether the sperm cell contains an X or Y chromosome. If the sperm cell contains an X chromosome, the fetus will be XX and, typically, a girl will develop. A sperm cell carrying a Y chromosome results in an XY combination, and typically a boy will develop. Variations from this general rule result in intersex fetuses.

===In utero development and genitalia===

In male embryos at six to seven weeks&#x27; gestation, &quot;the expression of a gene on the Y chromosome induces changes that result in the development of the testes&quot;. At approximately nine weeks&#x27; gestation, the production of testosterone by a male embryo results in the development of the male reproductive system. 

The male reproductive system includes both external and internal organs. The external organs include the penis, the scrotum, and the testicles (or testes). The penis is a cylindrical organ filled with spongy tissue. It is the organ used by boys to expel urine. The foreskin of some boys&#x27; penises is removed in a process known as circumcision. The scrotum is a loose sac of skin behind the penis which contains the testicles. Testicles are oval-shaped gonads. A boy generally possesses two testicles. Internal male reproductive organs include the vas deferens, the ejaculatory ducts, the urethra, the seminal vesicles, and the prostate gland.

===Physical maturation===
Puberty is the process by which children&#x27;s bodies mature into adult bodies that are capable of reproduction. On average, boys begin puberty at ages 11–12 and complete puberty at ages 16–17.

In boys, puberty begins with the enlargement of the testicles and scrotum. The penis also increases in size, and a boy develops pubic hair. A boy&#x27;s testicles also begin making sperm. The release of semen, which contains sperm and other fluids, is called ejaculation. During puberty, a boy&#x27;s erect penis becomes capable of ejaculating semen and impregnating a female. A boy&#x27;s first ejaculation is an important milestone in his development. On average, a boy&#x27;s first ejaculation occurs at age 13. Ejaculation sometimes occurs during sleep; this phenomenon is known as a nocturnal emission.

When a boy reaches puberty, testosterone triggers the development of secondary sex characteristics. A boy&#x27;s muscles increase in size and mass, his voice deepens, his bones lengthen, and the shape of his face and body changes. The increased secretion of testosterone from the testicles during puberty causes the male secondary sexual characteristics to be manifested. Male secondary sex characteristics include:

* Growth of body hair, including underarm, abdominal, chest, and pubic hair. 
* Growth of facial hair.
* Enlargement of larynx (Adam&#x27;s apple) and deepening of voice.
* Increased stature; adult males are taller than adult females, on average.
* Heavier skull and bone structure.
* Increased muscle mass and strength.
* Broadening of shoulders and chest; shoulders wider than hips.
* Increased secretions of oil and sweat glands.

== Group and gender norms ==
Boys across various age groups are often part of social circles that establish their own unique norms. These norms serve as a benchmark for boys to assess their peers. The adherence to these group norms often holds more weight than the mere affiliation to the group. In fact, boys who do not conform to these norms are often evaluated lower than those who, despite being strangers, conform to the group’s norms. This phenomenon underscores the powerful influence of group norms in shaping attitudes and actions, and the social implications of conformity.
Boys who defy gender norms may face a higher risk of abuse, and may experience more depression than gender-conforming peers, as well as social stigma from parents and peers. The gender policing towards them can increase the risk of alcohol use, anxiety, and depression in adulthood.

In some cultures, the birth of a male child (boy) is considered prosperous.

== Boys and child labor ==

Boys perform the majority of child labor around the world compared to girls; 88 million child laborers are boys and 64 million are girls. Boys are also the primary victims of hazardous child labor. They are mainly employed in the agriculture, construction and mining sectors. Boy workers also account for about 87 percent of those who died on the job between 2003 and 2016 in the US.

Boys are given a basic reading, writing and mathematics skill and then forced to pursue their father&#x27;s profession in order to alleviate financial burden of the family. This is one of the main reasons why boys are preferred over girls by the rural communities in poor countries. In India, by contrast, the majority of adopted children are girls even though boys are preferred in general compared to girls.

<doc id="194260" wikidata="Q75561" url="?curid=194260" title="Catechism of the Catholic Church">
<text>The Catechism of the Catholic Church (; commonly called the Catechism or the CCC) is a reference work that summarizes the Catholic Church&#x27;s doctrine. It was promulgated by Pope John Paul II in 1992 as a reference for the development of local catechisms, directed primarily to those (in the church) responsible for catechesis and offered as &quot;useful reading for all other Christian faithful&quot;. It has been translated into and published in more than twenty languages worldwide.

John Paul II referred to it as &quot;the Catechism of the Second Vatican Council&quot;.

== Drafting ==
The decision to publish an official catechism was taken at the Second Extraordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops, which was convened by Pope John Paul II on 25 January 1985 to evaluate the progress of implementing the Vatican II council&#x27;s goals on the 20th anniversary of its closure. The assembly participants expressed the desire that &quot;a catechism or compendium of all Catholic doctrine regarding both faith and morals be composed, that it might be, as it were, a point of reference for the catechisms or compendiums that are prepared in various regions. The presentation of doctrine must be biblical and liturgical. It must be sound doctrine suited to the present life of Christians&quot;.

John Paul II says that in 1986 he formed a commission composed of 12 cardinals and bishops chaired by cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (who later became Pope Benedict XVI) to prepare the first draft of the &quot;Catechism&quot;. The commission was assisted by a committee consisting of seven diocesan bishops, experts in theology and catechesis. 

The first principal part of the &quot;Catechism&quot;, which deals with the Profession of Faith, was drafted by Bishop José Manuel Estepa Llaurens and Bishop Alessandro Maggiolini. The second principal part, on the sacraments, was drafted by future Cardinals Jorge Medina and Estanislao Esteban Karlic. The third principal part, on life in Christ, was drafted by the future Cardinal Jean Honoré and Bishop David Konstant. The final principal part, on prayer, was drafted by Fr. Jean Corbon, a Lebanese Melkite priest. Future CDF Prefect William Levada wrote the &quot;Catechism&quot;&#x27;s glossary. The project&#x27;s editorial secretary was the future Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, OP.

Reminiscing those days, Ratzinger said in 2011: &quot;I must confess that even today it seems a miracle to me that this project [the &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot;] was ultimately successful&quot;.

Cardinal Georges Cottier said he had worked on the catechism.

== Promulgation ==

The &quot;Catechism&quot; was promulgated by John Paul II on 11 October 1992, the 30th anniversary of the opening of the Second Vatican Council, with his apostolic constitution &quot;Fidei depositum&quot; (in English, &quot;The Deposit of Faith&quot;).

On 15 August 1997—the Solemnity of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary—John Paul II promulgated the Latin typical edition, with his apostolic letter &quot;Laetamur magnopere&quot;. 

== Publication ==
The &quot;CCC&quot; was published in the French language in 1992. In the United States, the English translation was published in 1994 and more than 250,000 copies had been pre-ordered before its release, with a note that it was &quot;subject to revision according to the Latin typical edition (&quot;editio typica&quot;) when it is published&quot;.

The Latin typical edition, the official text of reference promulgated on 15 August 1997, amended the contents of the provisional French text at a few points. As a result, the earlier translations from the French into other languages (including English) had to be amended and re-published as &quot;second editions&quot;.

Over eight million copies have been sold worldwide and the book has been published in more than twenty languages.

== Doctrinal value ==
In the apostolic constitution &quot;Fidei depositum&quot;, John Paul II declared that the &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; is &quot;a valid and legitimate instrument for ecclesial communion and a sure norm for teaching the faith&quot;, and stressed that it &quot;is not intended to replace the local catechisms duly approved by the ecclesiastical authorities, the diocesan Bishops and the Episcopal Conferences&quot;.

The &quot;Catechism&quot; states:

== Contents ==
The &quot;Catechism&quot; is a source on which to base other Catholic catechisms (e.g., &quot;YOUCAT&quot; or the &quot;United States Catholic Catechism for Adults&quot;) and other expositions of Catholic doctrine. As stated in the apostolic constitution &quot;Fidei depositum&quot;, with which its publication was ordered, it was given so &quot;that it may be a sure and authentic reference text for teaching Catholic doctrine and particularly for preparing local catechisms&quot;.

The &quot;Catechism&quot; is arranged in four principal parts:
* The Profession of Faith (the Apostles&#x27; Creed)
* The Celebration of the Christian Mystery (the Sacred Liturgy, and especially the sacraments)
* Life in Christ (including the Ten Commandments)
* Christian Prayer (including the Lord&#x27;s Prayer)

The section on Scripture in the &quot;Catechism&quot; covers the Patristic tradition of &quot;spiritual exegesis&quot; as further developed through the scholastic doctrine of the &quot;four senses&quot;. The &quot;Catechism&quot; by specifies that the necessary spiritual interpretation should be sought through the four senses of Scripture.

The literal sense pertains to the meaning of the words themselves, including any figurative meanings. The spiritual senses pertain to the significance of the things (persons, places, objects or events) denoted by the words. Of the three spiritual senses, the allegorical sense is foundational. It relates persons, events, and institutions of earlier covenants to those of later covenants, and especially to the New Covenant. Building on the allegorical sense, the moral sense instructs in regard to action, and the anagogical sense points to man&#x27;s final destiny. The teaching of the &quot;Catechism&quot; on Scripture has encouraged the pursuit of covenantal theology, an approach that employs the four senses to structure salvation history via the biblical covenants.

=== Paragraph 2267 (capital punishment) ===

One of the changes in the 1997 update consisted of the inclusion of the position on the death penalty that is defended in John Paul II&#x27;s encyclical &quot;Evangelium vitae&quot; of 1995.

The paragraph dealing with the death penalty (2267) was revised again by Pope Francis in 2018.

The text previously stated (1997):

The 2018 change to the &quot;Catechism&quot; reads:

== Reception ==
In 1992, cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI) stated:

Ulf Ekman, former Charismatic pastor and the founder of Livets Ord, says that the &quot;Catechism&quot; is &quot;the best book he has ever read&quot;.

== Derived works ==
The &quot;Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; was published in 2005, and the first edition in English in 2006. It is a more concise, dialogic and illustrated version of the &quot;Catechism&quot;. The text of the &quot;Compendium&quot; is available in fourteen languages on the Vatican website, which also gives the text of the &quot;Catechism&quot; itself in ten languages.

&quot;Youcat&quot; is a 2011 publication aimed at helping youth understand the &quot;Catechism&quot;.

<doc id="194261" wikidata="Q1377445" url="?curid=194261" title="Common-law marriage">
<text>Common-law marriage, also known as non-ceremonial marriage, marriage, informal marriage, de facto marriage, more uxorio or marriage by habit and repute, is a marriage that results from the parties&#x27; agreement to consider themselves married, followed by cohabitation, rather than through a statutorily defined process. Not all jurisdictions permit common law marriage, but will typically respect the validity of such a marriage lawfully entered in another state or country.

The original concept of a &quot;common-law&quot; marriage is one considered valid by both partners, but not formally recorded with a state or religious registry, nor celebrated in a formal civil or religious service. In effect, the act of the couple representing themselves to others as being married and organizing their relation as if they were married, means they are married.

The term &quot;common-law marriage&quot; (or similar) has wider informal use, often to denote relations that are not legally recognized as marriages. It is often used colloquially or by the media to refer to cohabiting couples, regardless of any legal rights or religious implications involved. This can create confusion in regard to the term and to the legal rights of unmarried partners (in addition to the actual status of the couple referred to).

==Terminology==
Common-law marriage is a marriage that takes legal effect without the prerequisites of a marriage license or participation in a marriage ceremony. The marriage occurs when two people who are legally capable of being married, and who intend to be married, live together as a married couple and hold themselves out to the world as a married couple.

===Common-law marriage vs. cohabitation===
The term &quot;common-law marriage&quot; is often used incorrectly to describe various types of couple relationships, such as cohabitation (whether or not registered) or other legally formalized relations. Although these interpersonal relationships are often called &quot;common-law marriage&quot;, they differ from its original meaning in that they are not legally recognized as &quot;marriages&quot;, but may be a parallel interpersonal status such as a &quot;domestic partnership&quot;, &quot;registered partnership&quot;, &quot;common law partner&quot; &quot;conjugal union&quot;, or &quot;civil union&quot;. Non-marital relationship contracts are not necessarily recognized from one jurisdiction to another.

In Canada, while some provinces may extend to couples in marriage-like relationships many of the rights and responsibilities of a marriage, they are not legally considered married. They may be legally defined as &quot;unmarried spouses&quot; and for many purposes such as taxes and financial claims, and within those contexts treated the same as married spouses.

A 2008 poll in the UK showed that 51% of respondents incorrectly believed that cohabitants had the same rights as married couples.

In Scotland, common-law marriage does not exist, although there was a type of irregular marriage called &#x27;marriage by cohabitation with habit and repute&#x27; which could apply to couples in special circumstances until 2006, and was abolished by the Family Law (Scotland) Act 2006 (irregular marriages established before 4 May 2006 are recognised).

==History==
In ancient Greece and Rome, marriages were private agreements between individuals and estates. Community recognition of a marriage was largely what qualified it as a marriage. The state had only limited interests in assessing the legitimacy of marriages. Normally, civil and religious officials took no part in marriage ceremonies and did not keep registries. There were several more or less formal ceremonies to choose from (partly interchangeable, but sometimes with different legal ramifications) as well as informal arrangements. It was relatively common for couples to cohabit with no ceremony; cohabiting for a moderate period of time was sufficient to make it a marriage. Cohabiting for the purpose of marriage carried with it no social stigma.

In medieval Europe, marriage came under the jurisdiction of canon law, which recognized as a valid marriage one in which the parties stated that they took one another as wife and husband, even in absence of any witnesses.

The Catholic Church forbade clandestine marriage at the Fourth Lateran Council (1215), which required all marriages to be announced in a church by a priest. The Council of Trent (1545–1563) introduced more specific requirements, ruling that future marriages would be valid only if witnessed by the pastor of the parish or the local ordinary (the bishop of the diocese) or by the delegate of one of said witnesses, the marriage being invalid otherwise, even if witnessed by a Catholic priest. The Tridentine canons did not bind the Protestants or the Eastern Orthodox, but clandestine marriages were impossible for the latter since their validity required the presence of a priest. England abolished clandestine or common-law marriages in the Marriage Act 1753, requiring marriages to be performed by a priest of the Church of England unless the participants in the marriage were Jews or Quakers. The Act applied to Wales but not to Scotland, which retained its own legal system by the Acts of Union 1707. To get around the requirements of the Marriage Act, such as minimum age requirements, couples would go to Gretna Green, in the south of Scotland, or other border villages such as Coldstream, to get married under Scots law. The Marriage Act 1753 also did not apply to Britain&#x27;s overseas colonies of the time and so common-law marriages continued to be recognized in what are now the United States and Canada.

Marriages &quot;per verba de praesenti&quot;, sometimes known as common-law marriages, were an agreement to marry, rather than a marriage.

==Legislation==

===Australia===

Australia does not have common law marriage as it is understood under common law. The term used for relationships between any two persons who are not married, but are living in certain domestic circumstances, may vary between states and territories, although the term &quot;de facto relationship&quot; is often used.

Since March 1, 2009, de facto relationships have been recognized in the Family Law Act (Commonwealth), applicable in states that have referred their jurisdiction on de facto couples to the Commonwealth&#x27;s jurisdiction. In Western Australia, the only state that has not referred its jurisdiction, state legislation is still valid. There is also no federal recognition of de facto relationships existing outside of Australia (see Section 51(xxxvii) of the Australian Constitution), and so this is also a state matter. Regulation of &quot;de facto&quot; relations is a combination of federal and state/territory laws.

===Canada===

Canada does not have the institution of common-law marriage within the meaning of the legal concept of such a marriage under the common-law, although common-law relationships are recognized for certain purposes in Canada. The Parliament of Canada has exclusive legislative authority over marriage and divorce in Canada under section 91(26) of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;. Marriage is regulated throughout Canada by the &quot;Civil Marriage Act&quot;, and violations of the requirements of this act are subject to the &quot;Criminal Code of Canada&quot; (&quot;Offences Against Conjugal Rights&quot; and &quot;Unlawful Solemnization of Marriage&quot; chapters, articles 290–296), also applicable throughout Canada.

By contrast, the regulation of non-marital relations, which are often referred to as &quot;common-law spouses&quot;, falls largely under provincial law. As such, the legal definition and many implications of marriage-like relationships fall under provincial jurisdiction. As family law varies between provinces, there are differences between the provinces regarding the recognition of common-law relationships. Most such regulations deal with relations that are romantic/sexual in nature, but some, such as adult interdependent relationships in Alberta, do not have such a requirement and can apply to platonic relations, including relatives. In addition, the term &quot;common law&quot; appears informally in documents from the federal government. Common-law partners may be eligible for various federal government spousal benefits. Various laws include &quot;common-law status&quot;, which automatically takes effect when two people (of any sex) have lived together in a conjugal relationship for a minimum period. In 1999, in its ruling &quot;M. v. H.&quot;, the Supreme Court of Canada decided that same-sex partners would also be included in common-law relationships.
Around one-fifth of Canadian couples are in common-law relationships, a three-fold increase from 1981, according to 2016 data from Statistics Canada.

==== Federal ====
Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) states, as of 2007, &quot;living common-law&quot; means living with a person in a conjugal relationship without being married and at least one of the following is true:

# the couple has been living in a conjugal relationship for at least 12 continuous months;
# the couple are parents of a child by birth or adoption; or
# one of the couple has custody and control of the other&#x27;s child (or had custody and control immediately before the child turned 19 years of age) and the child is wholly dependent on that person for support.

Canada recognizes unmarried partners under certain circumstances for the purpose of immigration. Citizenship &amp; Immigration Canada states that a common-law partner refers to a person who is living in a conjugal relationship with another person (opposite or same sex), and has done so continuously for a period of at least one year. A conjugal relationship exists when there is a significant degree of commitment between two people. This can be shown with evidence that the couple share the same home, that they support each other financially and emotionally, that they have children together, or that they present themselves in public as a couple. Common-law partners who are unable to live together or appear in public together because of legal restrictions in their home country or who have been separated for reasons beyond their control (for example, civil war or armed conflict) may still qualify and should be included on an application.

====Alberta====
See Adult interdependent relationship in Alberta.

====British Columbia====
The term &quot;common-law marriage&quot; does not appear in British Columbia (BC) law. A distinction is made between being a &quot;spouse&quot; and being &quot;married&quot;. Married couples include only those who have engaged in a legal marriage ceremony and have received a marriage licence. &quot;Spouses&quot; include married couples as well as those, of same or opposite sex, who satisfy criteria for being in a &quot;marriage-like relationship&quot; for a time period that depends on the law that is being considered. Hence the meaning of the term &quot;unmarried spouse&quot; in BC depends on the legal context. The criteria for a relationship being accepted as &quot;marriage-like&quot; include cohabitation for at least the specified period, unbroken by excessively long intervals that are unexplained by exigent circumstances. If dispute arises about whether the relationship was &quot;marriage-like&quot;, a court would consider a comprehensive set of further criteria including the domestic and financial arrangements, degree and nature of intimacy, and the sense of the relationship presented to friends and families (especially by each spouse to his/her own family). &quot;Mere roommates will never qualify as unmarried spouses. There needs to be some other dimension to the relationship indicative of a commitment between the parties and their shared belief that they are in a special relationship with each other.&quot; The criteria do not exclude the existence of a previous marriage to a third person during the period of the &quot;marriage-like relationship&quot; of the unmarried spouses. Hence a person may have more than one spouse at the same time.

The implications of becoming an unmarried spouse include:

* &quot;Child support&quot;. A spouse is responsible for contributing towards support of a child and possibly the other spouse if he/she is a biological or adoptive parent, or has contributed to support of the child for at least one year during the &quot;marriage-like relationship&quot; with the child&#x27;s parent and the parent applies to the court for continuing support after separation and within one year of the last support contribution. (The contribution towards child support expected from a non-parent is not as great as from a parent.) 
* &quot;Financial support and division of property and debts after separation&quot;. If the &quot;marriage-like relationship&quot; has continued for two years, the laws that apply upon separation are the same as those that apply to married couples, according to the &quot;Estate Administration Act&quot;. All property and debts acquired prior to the relationship are exempt. If no agreement between the partners about property and/or debts is written during or after the relationship, then the law specifies equal sharing of all acquired during the relationship, as well as any changes in the value of those brought into the relationship. (There is an exemption from equal sharing for certain categories, such as gifts and inheritances received by one spouse.) The degree of participation of each spouse in the acquisition of property or debt does not affect the sharing. Financial support may also be requested from the former spouse. A claim for financial support or the division of property and debt must be made within two years of the date of separation.
* &quot;Inheritance&quot;. A spouse is eligible for inheritance if the &quot;marriage-like relationship&quot; has existed for at least two years immediately prior to the death of the other spouse. All property and debts held in common are fully inherited automatically by the surviving spouse. Those brought into the relationship are subject to any existing valid will, which may be vulnerable to challenge if it does not provide for the surviving spouse and any children.
* &quot;Benefits from government programs&quot;. Access to benefits from government programs or policies can become more (or less) available upon becoming an unmarried spouse. In general, these become similar or identical to those of married couples, but the criteria for qualifying as &quot;unmarried spouses&quot;, such as longevity of the relationship, differ for the various programs. Social assistance is often immediately reduced when there is perceived to be a &quot;spouse in the house&quot;, regardless of the nature of the relationship.

====Manitoba====
See Common-law relationships in Manitoba.

====New Brunswick====
In New Brunswick, a couple must live together for three years or have a natural or adopted child together. They cannot have been married to another person during this time.

====Nova Scotia====
See Domestic partnership in Nova Scotia.

====Ontario====
In Ontario, section 29 of the &quot;Family Law Act&quot; specifically recognizes unmarried spouses in dealing with spousal support issues. The definition is having cohabited continuously for not less than three years or &quot;in a relationship of some permanence&quot; if parents of a child. However, common-law spouses do not have automatic rights under the &quot;Family Law Act&quot; to their spouses&#x27; property (section 29 applies only to the support sections of the Act). Thus, common-law partners do not have a statutory right to divide property in a breakup, and must ask courts to look to concepts such as the constructive or resulting trust to divide property in an equitable manner between partners.

Married people may also have a recognized common-law spouse even before being divorced from the first spouse.

Another difference that distinguishes common-law spouses from married partners is that a common-law partner can be compelled to testify against his or her partner in a court of law.

====Quebec====
The Civil Code of Quebec has never recognized a common-law partnership as a form of marriage. However, many laws in Quebec explicitly apply to common-law partners (called ) in &quot; unions&quot; (marriages being &quot; unions&quot;) as they do to married spouses. Same-sex partners are also recognized as in unions, for the purpose of social benefit laws. However, common-law partners do not have any legal rights between them, such as alimony, family patrimony, compensatory allowance and matrimonial regime. The Quebec Court of Appeal ruled this restriction to be unconstitutional in 2010; but on January 25, 2013 the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that common-law couples do not have the same rights as married couples.

A 2002 amendment to the Civil Code recognizes a type of domestic partnership called a civil union that is similar to marriage and is likewise available to same-sex partners. No citizen of Quebec can be recognized under family law to be in both a civilly married state and a within the same time frame. Divorce from one conjugal relationship must occur before another conjugal relationship may occur in family law.

Same-sex partners can also marry legally in Quebec, as elsewhere in Canada.

====Saskatchewan====
In Saskatchewan, common-law relations are regulated by &quot;The Family Property Act&quot; and &quot;The Family Maintenance Act&quot;. Queen&#x27;s Bench justices have sanctioned common-law relationships as simultaneously existing in family law while one or more of the spouses were also civilly married to others.

=== Denmark ===
§ 27 of the historical Jyske Lov, which covered Funen, Jutland and Schleswig in the years 1241–1683, reads:
=== India ===
In the case of &quot;D. Velusamy v D. Patchaiammal&quot; (2010), the Supreme Court of India defined, with reference to the Domestic Violence Act of 2005, &quot;a relationship in the nature of marriage&quot; as &quot;akin to a common law marriage&quot;. The Supreme Court declared that the following are required to satisfy the conditions for a common-law marriage or a relationship in the nature of marriage:

# Must be of marriageable age.
# Must not be already married and is qualified to marry.
# Must be living together in a way that seems to society that the couple is married
# Must have cohabited for a &quot;significant&quot; period of time.
# Must be living together voluntarily.

There is no specified time for the common-law marriage to actually take effect but needs it to be &quot;significant&quot;. The case clarified that there was a difference between &quot;live-in relationships&quot;, &quot;a relationship in the nature of marriage&quot;, casual relationships and having a &quot;keep&quot;. Only &quot;a relationship in the nature of marriage&quot; can afford the rights and protections conferred in the Domestics Violence Act of 2005 and Section 125 of the Criminal Code, which include alimony for the female partner (unless she leaves her partner for no reason, had an affair with another man, or left with a mutual understanding, in which case alimony amounts must be settled mutually too), allowances, shelter and protections for the female partner in case of abuse, right to live in her partner&#x27;s house and child custody. Furthermore, children born in such relationships will be granted allowances until they reach full age and, provided the person is not a married adult daughter, if the person is of full age and is handicapped. Furthermore, the Hindu Marriage Act stipulates that children born out of wedlock (including to live-in relationships, relationships in the nature of marriage and casual relationships) are treated as equivalent to legitimate children in terms of inheritance. However, the Hindu Marriage Act is only applicable if the children&#x27;s parent is Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist or Jain.

===Ireland===
Ireland does not recognize common-law marriage, but the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 (in force between 2010 and 2015) gives some rights to unmarried cohabitants. Following the Marriage Act 2015 which legalized same-sex marriage in Ireland, civil partnerships are no longer available in Ireland; couples already in a civil partnership may apply to convert their civil partnership into marriage or may remain in a civil partnership which will continue to be valid, if contracted before November 2015. A constitutional amendment that would have recognised family as including unmarried &#x27;durable&#x27; relationships, proposed in March 2024, failed by 67%.

===Israel===
In Israel, courts and a few statutes (such as social security which grants death and disability benefits) have recognized an institute of () meaning a couple who are &quot;known in the public&quot; (lit. translation) as living together as husband and wife. Generally speaking the couple needs to satisfy two tests which are: 1) &quot;intimate life similar to married couple, relationship based on same emotions of affection and love, dedication and faithfulness, showing they have chosen to share their fate&quot; (Supreme Court of Israel, judge Zvi Berenson (intimacy test)), and 2) sharing household (economic test). In addition courts usually are more likely to recognize such relationship as marriage for granting benefits if the couple could not get married under the Israeli law.

Israel&#x27;s common-law status grants Israeli couples virtually the same benefits and privileges as married couples in Israel.

=== Kuwait ===
Common-law marriage or partnerships have some limited recognition in Kuwait in the cases of expatriate familial disputes such as maintenance payments and child support dues. Family courts use the law of the male partner or husband&#x27;s country of nationality to deal with family matters and hence if the male partner comes from a country where partnerships or other similar unions are recognised, then a Kuwaiti court can also consider it. However, intercourse outside of marriage is illegal in Kuwait so such recognition can only practically apply in exceptional cases like illegitimate children born abroad and the parents having since separated abroad but relocated to Kuwait. No recognition is extended to couples where one or both parties are Kuwaiti or to homosexual couples.

===United Kingdom===
====England and Wales====
The term &quot;common-law marriage&quot; has been used in England and Wales to refer to unmarried, cohabiting heterosexual couples. However, this is merely a social usage. The term does not confer on cohabiting parties any of the rights or obligations enjoyed by spouses or civil partners. Unmarried partners are recognised for certain purposes in legislation: &quot;e.g.,&quot; for means-tested benefits. For example, in the Jobseekers Act 1995, &quot;unmarried couple&quot; was defined as a man and woman who are not married to each other but who are living together in the same household as husband and wife other than in prescribed circumstances. But in many areas of the law cohabitants enjoy no special rights. Thus when a cohabiting relationship ends, ownership of any assets will be decided by property law. The courts have no discretion to reallocate assets, as occurs on divorce.

It is sometimes mistakenly claimed that before the Marriage Act 1753 cohabiting couples would enjoy the protection of a &quot;common-law marriage&quot;. In fact, neither the name nor the concept of &quot;common-law marriage&quot; was known at this time. Far from being treated as if they were married, couples known to be cohabiting risked prosecution by the church courts for fornication.

&quot;Contract marriages&quot; (or more strictly marriages ) could be presumed, before the Marriage Act 1753, to have been undertaken by mutual consent by couples who lived together without undergoing a marriage ceremony. However, they were not understood as having the legal status of a valid marriage until the decision in &quot;Dalrymple&quot; clarified this in 1811. This decision affected the subsequent development of English law due to the fact that the Marriage Act 1753 did not apply overseas. English courts later held that it was possible to marry by a simple exchange of consent in the colonies, although most of the disputed ceremonies involved the ministrations of a priest or other clergyman.

The English courts also upheld marriages by consent in territories not under British control but only if it had been impossible for the parties to marry according to the requirements of the local law. The late 1950s and early 1960s saw a spate of cases arising out of the Second World War, with marriages in prisoner-of-war camps in German-occupied Europe posing a particular problem for judges. (Some British civilians interned by the Japanese during the Second World War were held to be legally married after contracting marriages under circumstances where the formal requirements could not be met.) To this limited extent, English law does recognise what has become known as a &quot;common-law marriage&quot;. English legal texts initially used the term to refer exclusively to &quot;American&quot; common-law marriages. Only in the 1960s did the term &quot;common-law marriage&quot; begin to be used in its contemporary sense to denote unmarried, cohabiting heterosexual relationships, and not until the 1970s and 1980s did the term begin to lose its negative connotations. The use of the term is likely to have encouraged cohabiting couples to believe falsely that they enjoyed legal rights. By the end of the 1970s a myth had emerged that marrying made little difference to one&#x27;s legal rights, and this may have fuelled the subsequent increase in the number of couples living together and having children together outside marriage.

====Scotland====
Under Scots law, there have been several forms of &quot;irregular marriage&quot;, among them:

# Irregular marriage by declaration &quot;de praesenti&quot; – declaring in the presence of two witnesses that one takes someone as one&#x27;s wife or husband.
# Irregular marriage conditional on consummation
# Marriage contracted by correspondence
# Irregular marriage by cohabitation with habit and repute

The Marriage (Scotland) Act 1939 provided that the first three forms of irregular marriage could not be formed on or after 1 January 1940. However, any irregular marriages contracted prior to 1940 can still be upheld. This act also allowed the creation of regular civil marriages in Scotland for the first time (the civil registration system started in Scotland on 1 January 1855).

Until this act, the only regular marriage available in Scotland was a religious marriage. Irregular marriages were not socially accepted and many people who decided to contract them did so where they were relatively unknown. In some years up to 60% of the marriages in the Blythswood Registration District of Glasgow were &quot;irregular&quot;.

In 2006, &quot;marriage by cohabitation with habit and repute&quot;, the last form of irregular marriage that could still be contracted in Scotland, was abolished in the Family Law (Scotland) Act 2006. Until that act had come into force, Scotland remained the only European jurisdiction never to have totally abolished the old-style common-law marriage. For this law to apply, the time the couple had lived together continuously had to exceed 20 days.

As in the American jurisdictions that have preserved it, this type of marriage can be difficult to prove. It is not enough for the couple to have lived together for several years, but they must have been generally regarded as husband and wife. Their friends and neighbors, for example, must have known them as Mr. and Mrs. So-and-so (or at least they must have held themselves out to their neighbors and friends as Mr. and Mrs. So-and-so). Also, like American common-law marriages, it is a form of lawful marriage, so that people cannot be common-law spouses, or husband and wife by cohabitation with habit and repute, if one of them was legally married to somebody else when the relationship began.

It is a testament to the influence of American legal thought and English colloquial usage that, in a study conducted by the Scottish Executive in 2000, 57% of Scots surveyed believed that couples who merely live together have a &quot;common-law marriage&quot;. In fact, that term is unknown in Scots law, which uses &quot;marriage by cohabitation with habit and repute&quot;.

Otherwise, men and women who otherwise behave as husband and wife did &quot;not&quot; have a common-law marriage or a marriage by habit and repute merely because they set up housekeeping together, but they &quot;must&quot; have held themselves out to the world as husband and wife. (In many jurisdictions, they must do so for a certain length of time for the marriage to be valid.) The Scottish Survey is not clear on these points. It notes that &quot;common-law marriage&quot; is not part of Scots law, but it fails to note that &quot;marriage by cohabitation with habit and repute&quot;, which is the same thing but in name, &quot;was&quot; part of Scots law until 2006.

===United States===
In the U.S., most states have abolished common-law marriage by statute. However, common-law marriage can still be contracted in Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Montana, Rhode Island, Texas, Utah, Oklahoma and the District of Columbia. Once they meet the requirements of common-law marriage, couples in those true common-law marriages are considered legally married for all purposes and in all circumstances.

All U.S. jurisdictions recognize common-law marriages that were validly contracted in the originating jurisdiction, although the extent to which the U.S. Constitution requires interstate marriage recognition has not been fully articulated by the Supreme Court. However, absent legal registration or similar notice of the marriage, the parties to a common law marriage or their eventual heirs may have difficulty proving their relationship to be marriage. Some states provide for registration of an informal or common-law marriage based on the declaration of each of the spouses on a state-issued form.

===English-speaking Caribbean===
Due to their colonial past, the islands of the English-speaking Caribbean have statutes concerning common-law marriage similar to those in England. However, in the Caribbean, the term &quot;common-law&quot; marriage is also widely described, by custom as much as by law, to be any long term relationship between male and female partners. Such unions are widespread, making up a significant percentage of families, many of which have children and may last for many years. The reasons for people choosing common-law arrangements is debated in sociological literature. Although the acceptance of this type of union varies, men being more inclined to consider them as legitimate than women, they have become an institution.

<text>George Abel Rothrock Jr. (November 11, 1932 – April 3, 1993) was a professor of European history at the University of Alberta, known for his research on the military history of early modern Europe and the Ancien Régime in France, including books on Huguenots and on 17th-century military engineer Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban, and a translation of de Vauban&#x27;s work.

==Life==
Rothrock was born on November 11, 1932 in Wilmington, Delaware, and was a 1954 graduate of the University of Delaware. He became a graduate student of history at the University of Minnesota, earning a master&#x27;s degree there in 1956 and completing his Ph.D. in 1958. His dissertation, &quot;The French Crown and the Estates General of 1614&quot;, was supervised by John Baptist Wolf.

After postdoctoral research as a Fulbright Scholar at the University of Grenoble, Rothrock returned to the US, and taught at the University of Omaha from 1958 to 1962, at University of Michigan from 1962 to 1963, and at the University of Saskatchewan from 1963 to 1964. He joined the University of Alberta faculty in 1964 as an associate professor in 1964, became a full professor in 1971, and retired as a professor emeritus in 1992.

He died on April 3, 1993.

<text>Frozen Dead Guy Days (started 2002) is an annual celebration held in the town of  Nederland, Colorado until 2023 and in Estes Park, Colorado in 2023, to loosely celebrate the cryopreservation of Bredo Morstøl.

==History==
In 1989, a Norwegian citizen named Trygve Bauge brought the corpse of his recently deceased grandfather, Bredo Morstøl, to the United States. The body was preserved on dry ice for the trip, and stored in liquid nitrogen at the Trans Time cryonics facility in San Leandro, California from 1990 to 1993.

In 1993, Bredo was returned to dry ice and transported to the town of Nederland, where Trygve and his mother Aud planned to create a cryonics facility of their own. When Trygve was deported from the United States for overstaying his visa, his mother, Aud, continued keeping her father&#x27;s body cryogenically frozen in a shack behind her unfinished house.

Aud was eventually evicted from her home for living in a house with no electricity or plumbing, in violation of local ordinances. At that time, she told a local reporter about her father&#x27;s body, and those of two other individuals, and the reporter went to the local city hall in order to let them know about Aud&#x27;s fears that her eviction would cause her father&#x27;s body to thaw out.

According to an article in the February 7, 1995, &quot;The Denver Post&quot;, Aud Morstøl was found guilty by a jury of building-use and zoning violations. The Nederland town judge ordered her to remove the frozen body of her father from Nederland by March 6 or face 10 days in jail and a $600.00 fine.

The story caused a sensation. In response, the city added a broad new provision to Section 7-34 of its Municipal Code, &quot;Keeping of bodies&quot;, outlawing the keeping of &quot;the whole or any part of the person, body or carcass of a human being or animal or other biological species which is not alive upon any property&quot;. However, because of the publicity that had arisen, they made an exception for Bredo, a grandfather clause. Trygve secured the services of Delta Tech, a local environmental company, to keep the cryonic facility running. Bo Shaffer, CEO of Delta Tech, was known locally as &quot;The Iceman&quot; and caretaker responsible for transporting the dry ice necessary for cryopreservation to the IC Institute, something he has done since 1995. In that year, the local Tuff Shed supplier and a Denver radio station built a new shed in which to store the body of Bredo. In the fall of 2012, Jane Curtis Gazit and Mike Wooten, took over as Bredo&#x27;s caretakers, but they passed caretaking duties to Brad Wickham, a resident of Nederland, who is the current caretaker.

In honor of the town&#x27;s unique resident, Nederland holds an annual celebration, first started in 2002.

==Annual celebration==

Frozen Dead Guy Days is typically celebrated on the second weekend of March. Coffin races, a hearse parade, and &quot;Frozen Dead Guy&quot; lookalike contests are held. A documentary on &quot;Grandpa Bredo&quot;, called &quot;Grandpa&#x27;s in the Tuff Shed&quot;, is shown. A newer version of the film, &quot;Grandpa&#x27;s Still in the Tuff Shed&quot;, was premiered in Nederland on March 7, 2003.

Other events include a tour of the Tuff Shed where Grandpa is still frozen; a &quot;polar plunge&quot; for those brave enough to go swimming in Colorado in early March (which generally requires breaking through the ice); coffin races (a team of 7 members build a ‘coffin’ and race an obstacle course carrying a teammate in said coffin), a dance, called &quot;Grandpa&#x27;s Blue Ball&quot;; pancake breakfasts; Poetry Slam; a market showcasing local artists; Snowy Human Foosball, Fix-A-Frozen-Flat and frozen t-shirt competitions, and snow sculpture contests. Glacier Ice Cream, headquartered in the nearby city of Boulder, makes a flavor specifically for the festival (named, appropriately enough, Frozen Dead Guy), consisting of fruit-flavored blue ice cream mixed with crushed Oreo cookies and sour gummy worms. Tours of the Tuff Shed where Grandpa is still frozen were suspended after 2005, after Grandpa&#x27;s family &quot;became frustrated with Frozen Dead Guy Days&quot;, but they resumed with the 2010 celebration.

There has been a growing increase in interest in the festival, with rising attendance numbers each year. The 2019 event had an estimated 25,000 visitors. Various fan films have documented the backstory of the festival. In March 2020, just days before the 19th annual weekend event, the festival was cancelled due to rising concerns about the risk of large crowds spreading the coronavirus pandemic, especially given the rising number of documented cases.

Although Trygve and Aud filed a complaint against Nederland involving money and naming rights in 2005, Frozen Dead Guy Days continued to be held annually. Long-time organizer Amanda MacDonald partially relinquished ownership and control of the event in 2019. The celebration was last held March 19–20, 2022 after a two year hiatus due to the coronavirus pandemic. Organizers announced the 2023 iteration would be cancelled, stating Nederland refuses &quot;to work with the festival&#x27;s current owners again.&quot; For 2023, the festival moved to Estes Park, and currently (2025) charges $50 per person.

<text>Astronautics (or cosmonautics) is the practice of sending spacecraft beyond Earth&#x27;s atmosphere into outer space. Spaceflight is one of its main applications and space science is its overarching field.

The term &quot;astronautics&quot; (originally &quot;astronautique&quot; in French) was coined in the 1920s by J.-H. Rosny, president of the Goncourt academy, in analogy with aeronautics. Because there is a degree of technical overlap between the two fields, the term aerospace is often used to describe both at once. In 1930, Robert Esnault-Pelterie published the first book on the new research field.

The term &quot;cosmonautics&quot; (originally &quot;cosmonautique&quot; in French) was introduced in the 1930s by Ary Sternfeld with his book &quot;Initiation à la Cosmonautique&quot; (Introduction to cosmonautics) (the book brought him the Prix REP-Hirsch, later known as the Prix d&#x27;Astronautique, of the French Astronomical Society in 1934.)

As with aeronautics, the restrictions of mass, temperatures, and external forces require that applications in space survive extreme conditions: high-grade vacuum, the radiation bombardment of interplanetary space and the magnetic belts of low Earth orbit. Space launch vehicles must withstand titanic forces, while satellites can experience huge variations in temperature in very brief periods. Extreme constraints on mass cause astronautical engineers to face the constant need to save mass in the design in order to maximize the actual payload that reaches orbit.

==History==
The early history of astronautics is theoretical: the fundamental mathematics of space travel was established by Isaac Newton in his 1687 treatise &quot;Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot;. Other mathematicians, such as Swiss Leonhard Euler and Franco-Italian Joseph Louis Lagrange also made essential contributions in the 18th and 19th centuries. In spite of this, astronautics did not become a practical discipline until the mid-20th century. On the other hand, the question of spaceflight puzzled the literary imaginations of such figures as Jules Verne and H. G. Wells. At the beginning of the 20th century, Russian cosmist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky derived the rocket equation, the governing equation for a rocket-based propulsion, enabling computation of the final velocity of a rocket from the mass of spacecraft (formula_1), combined mass of propellant and spacecraft (formula_2) and exhaust velocity of the propellant (formula_3).
:formula_4

By the early 1920s, Robert H. Goddard was developing liquid-propellant rockets, which would in a few brief decades become a critical component in the designs of such famous rockets as the V-2 and Saturn V.

The Prix d&#x27;Astronautique (Astronautics Prize) awarded by the Société astronomique de France, the French astronomical society, was the first prize on this subject. The international award, established by aviation and astronautical pioneer Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André-Louis Hirsch, was given from 1929 to 1939 in recognition of the study of interplanetary travel and astronautics.

By the mid-1950s, the Space Race between the USSR and the US had begun.

==Subdisciplines==
Although many regard astronautics itself as a rather specialized subject, engineers and scientists working in this area must be knowledgeable in many distinct fields.
* Astrodynamics – the study of orbital motion. Those specializing in this field examine topics such as spacecraft trajectories, ballistics and celestial mechanics.
* Spacecraft propulsion – how spacecraft change orbits, and how they are launched. Most spacecraft have some variety of rocket engine, and thus most research efforts focus on some variety of rocket propulsion, such as chemical, nuclear or electric.
* Spacecraft design – a specialized form of systems engineering that centers on combining all the necessary subsystems for a particular launch vehicle or satellite.
* Controls – keeping a satellite or rocket in its desired orbit (as in spacecraft navigation) and orientation (as in attitude control).
* Space environment – although more a sub-discipline of physics rather than astronautics, the effects of space weather and other environmental issues constitute an increasingly important field of study for spacecraft designers.
* Bioastronautics

<doc id="194273" wikidata="Q17590" url="?curid=194273" title="Saint Lawrence">
<text>Saint Lawrence or Laurence (, &quot;laurelled&quot;; 31 December 225 – 10 August 258) was one of the seven deacons of the city of Rome under Pope Sixtus II who were martyred in the persecution of the Christians that the Roman emperor Valerian ordered in 258.

== Life ==
Lawrence is thought to have been born on 31 December AD 225, in Huesca (or less probably, in Valencia), the town from which his parents came in the later region of Aragon that was then part of the Roman province of Hispania Tarraconensis. The martyrs Orentius (Modern Spanish: ) and Patientia (Modern Spanish: ) are traditionally held to have been his parents.

Lawrence encountered the future Pope Sixtus II, a famous teacher born in Greece, in Caesaraugusta (Zaragoza), and they travelled together from Hispania to Rome. When Sixtus became the pope in 257, he ordained the young Lawrence who was only 32, as a deacon, and later appointed him as &quot;archdeacon of Rome&quot;, the first among the seven deacons who served in the cathedral church. This was a position of great trust that included the care of the treasury and riches of the Church and the distribution of alms to the indigent.
St. Cyprian, Bishop of Carthage, noted that at the time the norm was that Christians who were denounced were executed and all their goods confiscated by the Imperial treasury. At the beginning of August 258, the Emperor Valerian issued an edict that all bishops, priests, and deacons should immediately be put to death. Pope Sixtus II was captured on 6 August 258, at the cemetery of St. Callixtus while celebrating the liturgy and was executed immediately.

After the death of Sixtus, the prefect of Rome demanded that Lawrence turn over the riches of the Church, and St. Ambrose wrote that Lawrence asked for three days to gather the wealth. He worked swiftly to distribute as much Church property to the indigent as possible to prevent it from being seized by the prefect. On the third day, at the head of a small delegation, he presented himself to the prefect. When ordered to deliver the treasures of the Church, he presented the city&#x27;s indigent, crippled, blind, and suffering, and declared that these were the true treasures of the Church: &quot;Here are the treasures of the church. You see, the church is truly rich, far richer than your emperor!&quot;

== Martyrdom ==
As a deacon in Rome, Lawrence was responsible for the material goods of the Church and the distribution of alms to the poor. Ambrose of Milan related that when the treasures of the Church were demanded of Lawrence by the prefect of Rome, he brought forward the poor, to whom he had distributed the treasure as alms. &quot;Behold in these poor persons the treasures which I promised to show you; to which I will add pearls and precious stones, those widows and consecrated virgins, which are the Church&#x27;s crown.&quot; The prefect was so angry that he had a great gridiron prepared with hot coals beneath it and had Lawrence placed on it, hence Lawrence&#x27;s association with the gridiron.

Lawrence was sentenced at San Lorenzo in Miranda and imprisoned in San Lorenzo in Fonte, where he baptized fellow prisoners. He was martyred in San Lorenzo in Panisperna and was buried in San Lorenzo fuori le Mura. The Almanac of Filocalus for 354 states that he was buried in the Catacomb of Cyriaca on the Via Tiburtina by Hippolytus and Justin the Confessor, a presbyter. One of the early sources for his martyrdom was the description of Aurelius Prudentius Clemens in his &quot;Peristephanon&quot;, Hymn 2.
Despite the Church being in possession of the actual gridiron, historian Patrick J. Healy opines that the traditional account of how Lawrence was martyred is &quot;not worthy of credence,&quot; as the slow, lingering death cannot be reconciled &quot;with the express command contained in the edict regarding bishops, priests, and deacons (&quot;animadvertantur&quot;) which ordinarily meant decapitation.&quot; A theory of how the tradition arose is proposed that as the result of a mistake in transcription, the omission of the letter &quot;p&quot; – &quot;by which the customary and solemn formula for announcing the death of a martyr – &quot;passus est&quot; [&quot;he suffered,&quot; that is, was martyred] – was made to read &quot;assus est&quot; [he was roasted].&quot; The &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;, which is held to draw from sources independent of the existing traditions and &quot;Acta&quot; regarding Lawrence, uses &quot;passus est&quot; concerning him, the same term it uses for Pope Sixtus II, who was martyred by decapitation during the same persecution 4 days earlier.

Emperor Constantine I is held to have erected a small oratory in honour of Lawrence, which was a station on the itineraries of the graves of the Roman martyrs by the seventh century. Pope Damasus I rebuilt or repaired the church, now the Basilica di San Lorenzo fuori le Mura, while the Minor Basilica of San Lorenzo in Panisperna was erected over the site of his martyrdom. The gridiron of the martyrdom was placed by Pope Paschal II in the Minor Basilica of San Lorenzo in Lucina.

== Associated Roman churches ==

The Roman Catholic Church erected six churches on the sites in Rome traditionally associated with his martyrdom:

*Minor Basilica of St Lawrence in Damaso (Basilica Minore di San Lorenzo in Damaso): site where he performed his duties as deacon of Rome;
*Minor Basilica of St Mary in Domnica alla Navicella (Basilica Minore di Santa Maria in Domnica alla Navicella): site where he customarily distributed alms to the indigent;
*Annexed Church of St Lawrence in Miranda (Chiesa Annessa San Lorenzo de&#x27; Speziali in Miranda): site of his sentencing and condemnation by the Prefect of Rome;
*Annexed Church of St Lawrence in Fonte (Chiesa Annessa San Lorenzo in Fonte): site of his imprisonment by the centurion Ippolito and of the fountain in which the Saint baptized his fellow prisoners;
*Church of St Lawrence in Panisperna (Chiesa di San Lorenzo in Panisperna): site of his actual martyrdom/death and the oven used to roast him to death; and
*Papal Minor Basilica of St Lawrence outside the Walls (Basilica Minore Papale di San Lorenzo fuori le Mura): site of his burial and sepulchre.

Also in Rome are three other significant churches that are dedicated to Saint Lawrence but not associated with his life:
*Minor Basilica of St Lawrence in Lucina (Basilica Minore di San Lorenzo in Lucina), which possesses the relics of the gridiron on which and the chains with which he was martyred;
*Church of St. Lawrence in Palatio ad Sancta Sanctorum, Pontifical Sanctuary of the Holy Stairs (Chiesa di San Lorenzo in Palatio ad Sancta Sanctorum, Pontificio Santuario della Scala Santa), proximate to the Archbasilica of St. John in Laterano, which was originally a private Papal chapel when the edifice that houses it was a Papal palace, and which housed some of the most precious relics of the Roman Catholic Church, hence the title &quot;Sancta Sanctorum&quot; (&quot;Holy of Holies&quot;); and
*Church of St Lawrence in Piscibus (San Lorenzo in Piscibus), which is proximate to the Basilica of St. Peter

== Miracles ==

The life and miracles of Lawrence were collected in &quot;The Acts of St Lawrence&quot; but those writings have been lost. The earliest existing documentation of miracles associated with him is in the writings of Gregory of Tours (538–594), who mentions the following:

The mediaeval Church of St Mary Assumed (Chiesa di Santa Maria Assunta) in the small commune of Amaseno, Lazio, Italy houses the famous reliquary of the &quot;ampulla&quot; containing relics of Lawrence, namely a quantum of his blood, a fragment of his flesh, some fat and ashes. Tradition holds that annually, on the Feast of St. Lawrence, and sometimes on other occasions, the blood in the ampulla miraculously liquefies during the Feast and re-coagulates by the following day.

== Veneration ==
Due to his conspiring to hide and protect the written documents of the Church, Lawrence is known as the patron saint of archivists and librarians.

=== Roman Catholic Church ===
Lawrence is one of the most widely venerated saints of the Roman Catholic Church. Legendary details of his death were known to Damasus, Prudentius, Ambrose, and Augustine. Devotion to him was widespread by the fourth century. His liturgical celebration on 10 August has the rank of feast in the General Roman Calendar, consistent with the oldest of Christian calendars, e. g. the Almanac of Philocalus for the year 354, the inventory of which contains the principal feasts of the Roman martyrs of the middle of the fourth century. He remains one of the saints enumerated in the &quot;Roman Canon&quot; of the Holy Mass as celebrated in the Latin Church.

Lawrence is especially honoured in the city of Rome, of which he is considered the third patron after St. Peter and St. Paul. The church built over his tomb, the Papal Minor Basilica di San Lorenzo fuori le Mura, became one of the seven principal churches of Rome and a favourite place of Roman pilgrimages. The area proximate to the Basilica di San Lorenzo fuori le Mura is named the &quot;Quartiere San Lorenzo&quot;.

Because the Perseid Meteor Shower typically occurs annually in mid-August on or proximate to his feast day, some refer to the shower as the &quot;Tears of St Lawrence&quot;.

His intercession to God is invoked by librarians, archivists, comedians, cooks and tanners as their patron. He is the patron saint of Ampleforth Abbey, whose Benedictine monks founded one of the world&#x27;s leading public schools for British (and other) Roman Catholics, located in North Yorkshire.

The Festival of San Lorenzo is a religious celebration occurring every year in Tarapacá, Chile.

=== Anglican Communion ===
Within Anglicanism Lawrence&#x27;s name is traditionally spelled &quot;Laurence or Lawrence&quot;. His feast is on 10 August which is in the calendar of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, the volume of prayers which, in its 1662 format, was the founding liturgical document of a majority of Anglican provinces. In the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; the feast is titled &quot;S Laurence, Archdeacon of Rome and Martyr&quot;. His feast on 10 August has been carried into the contemporary calendars of most Anglican provinces, Laurence is remembered in the Church of England with a Lesser Festival under the title &quot;Laurence, deacon, martyr, 258&quot; on 10 August.

Anglo-Catholics venerate Lawrence, who is the patron of many Anglican parish churches, including 228 in England. A major church in Sydney, Australia, in the former civil parish of St Laurence, is known as &quot;Christ Church St Laurence&quot;. The Anglican charitable society, Brotherhood of St Laurence also bears his name.

== Legacy ==
According to Francesco Moraglia the role of deacon is distinguished by service of the poor. He is destined both to the service of the table (corporal works of mercy) and to the service of the word (spiritual works of mercy). &quot;The beauty, power and the heroism of [d]eacons such as Lawrence help to discover and come to a deeper meaning of the special nature of the diaconal ministry.&quot;
Many churches, schools, parishes, towns, and geographic features throughout the world are named for Lawrence of Rome. Depending on locality they are named &quot;St. Lawrence&quot;, &quot;St. Laurence&quot;, &quot;San Lorenzo&quot;, &quot;St. Laurent&quot;, &quot;St. Lorenz&quot; or similarly in other languages. San Lorenzo del Escorial, the monastery built by King Philip II of Spain, commemorates his victory at the Battle of St. Quentin (1557) on the Feast of St. Lawrence. The monastery and the attached palace, college, and library are laid out in a pattern that resembles the gridiron of Lawrence&#x27;s martyrdom. The gridiron of Lawrence is also thought the basis of the design of the Certosa di San Lorenzo di Padula, which is a monastery in Padula, Salerno, Italy. 

Saint Lawrence is one of Canada&#x27;s patron saints. On his second voyage, French explorer Jacques Cartier, arriving in the river estuary of the North American Great Lakes on the Feast of St. Lawrence in 1535, named it the &quot;Gulf of St. Lawrence&quot;.
The river emptying into the gulf was named the &quot;St. Lawrence River&quot;. Many names in what are now Québec and the Maritime Provinces of Canada are references to this important seaway, e. g., the Laurentian Mountains north of the city of Montreal, Saint-Laurent (borough), Saint Lawrence Boulevard which spans the width of the Island of Montreal, and St. Lawrence County, New York, United States near Lake Ontario. 
In the province of Ontario, St. Lawrence is a prominent, historic neighbourhood in old centre of Toronto (formerly named York), now most known for the expansive St. Lawrence Market. The Laurentian Mountains gave rise to the name for the Laurential Plateau, or the Canadian Shield. In Switzerland, Saint Lawrence is represented on the coat of arms of the city of Bülach with a gridiron.

The rescue operation for the miners trapped in the 2010 Copiapó mining accident in Chile was named &quot;Operacíon San Lorenzo&quot; after Lawrence, patron saint of miners.

Bernalillo, New Mexico celebrates three days of devotions to the Saint, to honor a devotional promise made by Spanish settlers during the 1692 Pueblo Revolt. Among the festivities are a set of dances performed by matachines. An image of the saint is kept in the house of a local family throughout the year, and a vigil and feast are held from 9–11 August. It is one of the oldest dancing processions in the New World.

In &quot;Fargo&quot;, season 1, episode 3, Lorne Malvo notes the stained glass window of St Lawrence in Stavros&#x27; office, in response to which Stavros narrates his martyrdom, in &quot;A Muddy Road&quot;.

In a scene in the 1992 film &quot;Lorenzo&#x27;s Oil&quot;, Augusto, Michaela, and Lorenzo tell a story about St Lawrence and refer to his Feast Day as &quot;The Night of The Shooting Stars&quot;.

<doc id="194275" wikidata="Q1094360" url="?curid=194275" title="Destiny of an Emperor">
<text>Destiny of an Emperor, known in Japan as is a tactical role-playing video game developed and published by Capcom for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It is based on the &quot;Tenchi wo Kurau&quot; manga by Hiroshi Motomiya. It was originally released in Japan in 1989, with an English language localization released for the North American market in 1990.

==Story==
Liu Bei, Zhang Fei, and Guan Yu form a small militia to defend their village from Yellow Turban rebels, followers of the sorcerer Zhang Jiao. Liu Bei gathers peasants and farmers from nearby villages and camps, eventually defeating Zhang Jiao and his people. Tao Qian, the governor of Xu Province, falls ill and requests that Liu Bei assume his position. Liu Bei hesitantly agrees, thus beginning the events depicted in the novel, albeit with significant alterations. Upon successfully completing the game, the player successfully unites China under the Shu Han banner.

Although the game loosely follows the events portrayed in &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, in many cases, the outcome is altered in Liu Bei&#x27;s favor against the various other warlords of the period. Most of the deviations occur later in the game, particularly involving the invasions of the other ruling powers, the Kingdom of Sun Wu and the Kingdom of Cao Wei.

The branching storyline allows the player the option of choosing alternate paths, which generally do not affect the plot in any significant manner.

==Gameplay==

Unlike virtually every other RPG released at the time or since, the non-boss battles of &quot;Destiny of an Emperor&quot; do not consist solely of encounters with generic units. While generic enemy units do appear in the game, most random battles are fought against one or more generals randomly selected from those roaming the lands the player&#x27;s party is traveling through at the time. Additionally, most of these unique units can be recruited. After being defeated in battle, there is a random chance that the general will offer to join the party, usually under the condition that the player character pays him a bribe of either money or horses (which can be purchased at item shops). Once recruited, the general will no longer be encountered in random battles.

Because of this system, the game has an exceptionally large number of playable characters, 150 in all, although many of these characters do not increase in power even when they accumulate experience points, making them useful only for a limited time. Also, the player may only have up to 70 characters in his party. After reaching this limit, the player can only recruit new characters if he ejects characters from his party to free up the slots. After being removed from the party, generals are again the player&#x27;s enemies and can once more be encountered in random battles.

The player&#x27;s active party consists of up to seven members, five of which can actively participate in combat at any single time, one who serves as a replacement for characters killed in combat, and one to serve as both a reinforcement member and party tactician. The tactician provides magic-like effects, which all members involved in combat are able to use.

In addition to standard attack and tactics options available in most games of the type, there is an option called &quot;All-Out&quot;. When chosen, the computer AI takes control of the battle, which proceeds at an extremely fast rate. This is solely a way of speeding up the easier battles and has no tactical advantage, as the player is unable to coordinate attacks or employ tactics, while the AI-controlled enemy can.

==Release==
&quot;Destiny of an Emperor&quot; is based on Hiroshi Motomiya&#x27;s manga, &quot;Tenchi wo Kurau&quot;, which follows the story of Chinese historical figure Liu Bei and his sworn brothers, Zhang Fei and Guan Yu. This story is loosely based upon the events in the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; by Luo Guanzhong, which itself was based on historical events and battles which occurred before and during the Three Kingdoms period of ancient China. &quot;Destiny of an Emperor&quot; was included in the &quot;Nintendo Classic Mini: Family Computer Weekly Shonen Jump 50th Anniversary Commemoration Version&quot;, a console created to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the weekly Japanese manga magazine &quot;Shōnen Jump&quot;.

A sequel to &quot;Destiny of an Emperor&quot;, &quot;Tenchi wo Kurau II: Shokatsu Kōmei Den&quot;, was released exclusively for the Japanese Family Computer.

==Reception==
Jeremy Parish praised it as &quot;interesting&quot; and &quot;adorable&quot;, suggesting people check it out while noting that it is not an &quot;oft-mentioned classic&quot;. 9dragons of &quot;RPGamer&quot; discussed how the game was fun, but the story did not interest them when they were younger. When they tried the game at a later age, they felt more invested in the game, now knowing that it is based on historical events, which made them feel like they were &quot;living the history&quot;. Ethan Gach of &quot;Kotaku&quot; expressed hope that &quot;Destiny of an Emperor&quot; would be released for the Nintendo Switch&#x27;s NES library. Joshua Jankiewicz of &quot;Hardcore Gaming 101&quot; felt it odd that it was released in the United States due to the reticence of publishers to release role-playing games, particularly those with &quot;Eastern&quot; themes, in the United States. They lamented the lack of press coverage at the time for the game, praising it for being challenging without being unfair in a way that other games often fail to do. They also praised the auto-battle function, feeling it a good way to keep battles with weaker enemies from feeling tedious. They however found the exploration limited and monotonous and felt that problems with the game, such as money and food being too abundant and the high number of characters being useless due to the proficiency of the five main characters, pop up in the latter part of it. Despite this, they felt these flaws were not significant due to it being Capcom&#x27;s first attempt at a role-playing game. Author Andy Slaven felt it was &quot;all too often overlooked&quot;, calling its gameplay unique, challenging, and fun.

In 2007, a hacking tool was created called &quot;Destiny of an Editor&quot;. This tool was originally meant to alter stats, but over time gained additional functionality, including the ability to edit maps, text, enemy encounters, and graphics. The hacking community went on to create the Huan Ho awards, celebrating the best &quot;Destiny of an Emperor&quot; hacks.

<doc id="194276" wikidata="Q153981" url="?curid=194276" title="Thomas Müntzer">
<text>Thomas Müntzer ( – 27 May 1525) was a German preacher and theologian of the early Reformation whose opposition to both Martin Luther and the Catholic Church led to his open defiance of late-feudal authority in central Germany. Müntzer was foremost amongst those reformers who took issue with Luther&#x27;s compromises with feudal authority. He was a leader of the German peasant and plebeian uprising of 1525 commonly known as the German Peasants&#x27; War.

In 1514, Müntzer became a priest in Braunschweig, where he began to question the teachings and practices of the Catholic Church. He then became a follower and acquaintance of Martin Luther, who recommended him for a post in Zwickau. His beliefs became increasingly spiritual and apocalyptic; by his arrival at Allstedt in 1523 he had completely broken with Luther. Amidst the peasant uprisings in 1525, Müntzer organized an armed militia in Mühlhausen. He was captured after the Battle of Frankenhausen, tortured and finally executed.

Few other figures of the German Reformation raised as much controversy as Müntzer, which continues to this day. A complex and unusual character, he is now regarded as a significant personality in the early years of the German Reformation and the history of European revolutionaries. Almost all modern studies stress the necessity of understanding his revolutionary actions as a consequence of his theology: Müntzer believed that the end of the world was imminent and that it was the task of the true believers to aid God in ushering in a new era of history.

==Early life and education==
Thomas Müntzer was born in late 1489 (or possibly early 1490), in the small town of Stolberg in the Harz Mountains of central Germany. The legend that his father had been executed by the feudal authorities is untrue. There is every reason to suppose that Müntzer had a relatively comfortable background and upbringing, as evidenced by his lengthy education. Both his parents were still alive in 1520, his mother dying at around that time.

Shortly after 1490, the family moved to the neighbouring and slightly larger town of Quedlinburg, and it was as &quot;Thomas Munczer de Quedlinburgk&quot; that he enrolled at the University of Leipzig in 1506. Here he may have studied the arts or even theology: relevant records are missing, and it is uncertain whether Müntzer actually graduated from Leipzig. He later enrolled in late 1512 at the Viadriana University of Frankfurt an der Oder. It is not known what degrees he had obtained by 1514, when he found employment within the church: almost certainly a bachelor&#x27;s degree in theology and/or the arts; and possibly, but less certainly, a master of the arts. Again, the university records are incomplete or missing. At some time in this rather obscure period of his life, possibly before his studies at Frankfurt, he was employed as an assistant teacher in schools in Halle and Aschersleben, at which time, according to his final confession, he is alleged to have formed a &quot;league&quot; against the incumbent Archbishop of Magdeburg – to what end the league was formed is wholly unknown.

==Early employment and the Wittenberg contacts==
In May 1514, he took up a post as priest in the town of Braunschweig (Brunswick), where he was occupied on and off for the next few years. It was here that he began to question the practices of the Catholic Church, and to criticize, for example, the selling of indulgences. In letters of this time, he is already being addressed by friends as a &quot;castigator of unrighteousness&quot;. Between 1515 and 1516, he also managed to find a job as schoolmaster at a nunnery in Frose, near Aschersleben.

In the autumn of 1517, he was in Wittenberg, met with Martin Luther, and became involved in the great discussions which preceded the posting of Luther&#x27;s 95 Theses. He attended lectures at the university there, and was exposed to Luther&#x27;s ideas as well as other ideas originating with the humanists, among whom was Andreas Bodenstein von Karlstadt, who later became a radical opponent of Luther. Müntzer did not remain in Wittenberg for long, and was reported in various other locations in Thuringia and Franconia. He continued to be paid for his position at Braunschweig until early 1519, when he turned up in the town of Jüterbog, north-east of Wittenberg, where he had been asked to stand in for the preacher Franz Günther. Günther had already been preaching the reformed gospel, but had found himself attacked by the local Franciscans; requesting leave of absence, he left the scene and Müntzer was sent in. The latter picked up where Günther had left off. Before long, the local ecclesiastics were complaining bitterly about Müntzer&#x27;s heretical &quot;articles&quot; which challenged both church teaching and church institutions. By this time, Müntzer was not simply following Luther&#x27;s teachings; he had already begun to study the works of the mystics Henry Suso and Johannes Tauler, was seriously wondering about the possibility of enlightenment through dreams and visions, had thoroughly explored the early history of the Christian church, and was in correspondence with other radical reformers such as Karlstadt.

In June 1519, Müntzer attended the disputation in Leipzig between the reformers of Wittenberg (Luther, Karlstadt, and Philip Melanchthon) and the Catholic Church hierarchy (represented by Johann Eck). This was one of the high points of the early Reformation. Müntzer did not go unnoticed by Luther, who recommended him to a temporary post in the town of Zwickau. However, at the end of that year, he was still employed in a nunnery at Beuditz, near Weissenfels. He spent the entire winter studying works by the mystics, the humanists, and the church historians.

==Zwickau==

In May 1520, Müntzer was able to capitalize on the recommendation made by Luther a year earlier, and stood in as temporary replacement for a reformist/humanist preacher named Johann Sylvanus Egranus at St Mary&#x27;s Church in the busy town of Zwickau (population at that time ca. 7,000), near the border with Bohemia. Zwickau was in the middle of the important iron- and silver-mining area of the Erzgebirge, and was also home to a significant number of plebeians, primarily weavers. Money from the mining operations, and from the commercial boom which mining generated, had infiltrated the town. This led to an increasing division between rich and poor citizens, and a parallel consolidation of larger manufacturers over small-scale craftsmen. Social tensions ran high. It was a town which, although exceptional for the times, nurtured conditions which presaged the trajectory of many towns over the following two centuries.

At St Mary&#x27;s, Müntzer carried on as he had started in Jüterbog. This brought him into conflict with the representatives of the established church. He still regarded himself as a follower of Luther, however, and as such he retained the support of the town council, so much so that when Egranus returned to post in late September 1520, the town council appointed Müntzer to a permanent post at St Katharine&#x27;s Church.

St Katharine&#x27;s was the church of the weavers. Even before the arrival of Lutheran doctrines, there was already in Zwickau a reform movement inspired by the Hussite Reformation of the 15th century, especially in its radical, apocalyptic Taborite flavour. Amongst the Zwickau weavers this movement was particularly strong, along with spiritualism. Nikolaus Storch was active here, a self-taught radical who placed every confidence in spiritual revelation through dreams. Soon he and Müntzer were acting in concert. In the following months, Müntzer found himself more and more at odds with Egranus, the local representative of the Wittenberg movement, and increasingly embroiled in riots against the local Catholic priests. The town council became nervous at what was going on at St Katharine&#x27;s, and in April 1521 at last decided that enough was enough: Müntzer was dismissed from his post and was forced to leave Zwickau.

==Prague and months of wandering==
Müntzer initially travelled over the border into Bohemia to the town of Žatec (Saaz); this town was known as one of the five &quot;safe citadels&quot; of the radical Taborites of Bohemia. But Müntzer only used this as a stop-over en route to Prague. It was in Prague that the Hussite Church was already firmly established and Müntzer thought to find a safe home where he could develop his increasingly un-Lutheran ideas. He arrived here in late June 1521, was welcomed as a &quot;Martinist&quot; (a follower of Luther), and was allowed to preach and to give lectures. He also found the time to prepare a summary of his own beliefs, which appeared in a document known to posterity, slightly misleadingly, as the &quot;Prague Manifesto&quot;. This document exists in four forms: one in Czech, one in Latin, and two in German. One of them is written on a large piece of paper, about , much like a poster, but written on both sides. However, it is evident that none of the four items was ever published in any shape or form. The contents of this document indicate clearly just how far he had diverged from the road of the Wittenberg reformers, and how much he believed that the reform movement was something apocalyptic in nature. &quot;I, Thomas Müntzer, beseech the church not to worship a mute God, but a living and speaking one; none of the gods is more contemptible to the nations than this living one to Christians who have no part of him.&quot;

In November or December 1521, having discovered that Müntzer was not at all what they had supposed, the Prague authorities ran him out of town. The next twelve months were spent wandering in Saxony: he turned up in Erfurt and in Nordhausen, in each of which he spent several weeks, applying for suitable posts but failing to be appointed. He also visited his hometown in Stolberg to give sermons (Easter), and in November 1522 visited Weimar to attend a disputation. From December 1522 until March 1523, he found employment as chaplain at a nunnery at Glaucha just outside Halle. Here he found little opportunity to continue with his desire for change, despite the existence of a strong and militant local reform movement; his one attempt to break the rules, by delivering the communion &quot;in both kinds&quot; (Utraquism) to a noblewoman named Felicitas von Selmenitz probably led directly to his dismissal.

==Allstedt==

His next post was both relatively permanent and productive. In early April 1523, through the patronage of Selmenitz, he was appointed as preacher at St John&#x27;s Church in Allstedt in Saxony. He found himself working alongside another reformer, Simon Haferitz who preached at the church of St Wigberti. The town of Allstedt was small, barely more than a large village (population 600), with an imposing castle set on the hill above it. Elector Friedrich held the right to appoint to St John&#x27;s, but the town council either forgot to advise him, or did not feel that his approval was necessary. Almost immediately on arrival, Müntzer was preaching his version of the reformed doctrines, and delivering the standard church services and masses in German. Such was the popularity of his preaching and the novelty of hearing services in German that people from the surrounding countryside and towns were soon flocking to Allstedt. Some reports suggest that upwards of two thousand people were on the move every Sunday. Within weeks, Luther heard of this and wrote to the Allstedt authorities, asking them to persuade Müntzer to come to Wittenberg for closer inspection. Müntzer refused to go. He was far too busy carrying through his Reformation and wanted no discussion &quot;behind closed doors&quot;. At this time, he also married Ottilie von Gersen, a former nun; in the spring of 1524, Ottilie gave birth to a son.

It was not only Luther who was concerned. The Catholic Count Ernst von Mansfeld spent the summer of 1523 trying to prevent his own subjects from attending the reformed services in Allstedt. Müntzer felt secure enough to pen a letter to the count in September, ordering him to leave off his tyranny: &quot;I am as much a Servant of God as you, so tread gently, for the whole world has to be exercised in patience. Don’t grab, or the old coat may tear. (...) I will deal with you a thousand times more drastically than Luther with the Pope.&quot;

Throughout the remainder of 1523, and into 1524, Müntzer consolidated his reformed services and spread his message in the small town. He arranged for the printing of his &quot;German Church Service&quot;; the &quot;Protestation or Proposition by Thomas Müntzer from Stolberg in the Harz Mountains, now pastor of Allstedt&quot;, about his teachings; and &quot;On the Counterfeit Faith&quot;, in which he set out his belief that the true faith came from inner spiritual suffering and despair.
In the spring of 1524, supporters of Müntzer burned down a small pilgrimage chapel at Mallerbach, much to the annoyance of the abbess of the Naundorf nunnery. The town council and the castellan failed to do anything about her complaint. But in July, Müntzer was invited before the Electoral Duke Johann in Allstedt Castle, possibly in lieu of a belated &quot;trial sermon&quot;, and there he preached his famous sermon on the &quot;Second Chapter of the Book of Daniel&quot; (aka &quot;The Sermon Before the Princes&quot;) – a barely concealed warning to the princes that they should pitch in with the Allstedt reforms or face the wrath of God.
The immediate reaction of the princes is not documented, but Luther did not hold back: he published his &quot;Letter to the Princes of Saxony about the Rebellious Spirit&quot; demanding the radical&#x27;s banishment from Saxony. However, the princes simply summoned all the relevant persons of Allstedt, Müntzer included, to a hearing at Weimar where, after being interrogated separately, they were warned about their future conduct. This hearing had the desired effect upon town officials, who back-pedalled rapidly and withdrew their support for the radicals. In the night of 7 August 1524, Müntzer slipped out of Allstedt (by necessity abandoning wife and son, who were only later able to join him), and headed for the self-ruling Imperial Free City of Mühlhausen, around to the southwest.

==Mühlhausen and Nuremberg==
Mühlhausen was a city with a population of 8,500. During 1523 social tensions which had been brewing for several years came to a head, and the poorer inhabitants had managed to wrest some political concessions from the town council; building on this success, the radical reform movement kept up the pressure, under the leadership of a lay preacher named Heinrich Pfeiffer, who had been denouncing the practices of the old church from the pulpit of St Nikolaus Church. Thus, before Müntzer arrived, there was already considerable tension in the air. He was not appointed to any pulpit, but this did not stop him from preaching, agitating, and publishing pamphlets against Luther. His comrade-in-arms here was Pfeiffer; while the two men did not necessarily share the same beliefs (as in Zwickau with Storch) there was enough common-ground in their reformatory zeal and belief in the inspired spirit to allow them to work together closely. A minor civic coup took place in late September 1524, as a result of which, leading members of the town council fled the town, taking with them the city insignia and the municipal horse. But the coup was short-lived – partly because of divisions within the reformers inside the town and partly because the peasantry in the surrounding countryside took issue with the &quot;unchristian behaviour&quot; of the urban radicals. After only seven weeks in the town, on 27 September, Müntzer was forced to abandon wife and child once more and escape with Pfeiffer to a safer haven.

He travelled first to Nuremberg in the south, where he arranged for the publication of his anti-Lutheran pamphlet &quot;A Highly Provoked Vindication and Refutation of the unspiritual soft-living flesh in Wittenberg&quot;, as well as one entitled &quot;A Manifest Exposé of False Faith&quot;. Both were confiscated by the city authorities, the former before any copies could be distributed. Müntzer kept a low profile in Nuremberg, clearly considering that his best strategy would be to spread his teaching in print, rather than end up behind bars. He remained there until November and then left for the southwest of Germany and Switzerland, where peasants and plebeians were beginning to organize themselves for the great peasant uprising of 1525 in defiance of their feudal overlords. There is no direct evidence of what Müntzer did in this part of the world, but almost certainly he would have come in contact with leading members of the various rebel conspiracies; it is proposed that he met the later Anabaptist leader, Balthasar Hubmaier in Waldshut, and it is known that he was in Basel in December, where he met the Zwinglian reformer Oecolampadius, and may also have met the Swiss Anabaptist Conrad Grebel there. He spent several weeks in the Klettgau area, and there is some evidence to suggest that he helped the peasants to formulate their grievances. While the famous &quot;Twelve Articles&quot; of the Swabian peasants were certainly not composed by Müntzer, at least one important supporting document, the &quot;Constitutional Draft&quot;, may well have originated with him.

==Final months==

In February 1525 Müntzer returned to Mühlhausen (via Fulda, where he was briefly arrested and then – unrecognized – released) and took over the pulpit at St Mary&#x27;s Church; the town council neither gave, nor was asked for, permission to make this appointment; it would seem that a popular vote thrust Müntzer into the pulpit. Immediately, he and Pfeiffer, who had managed to return to the town some three months earlier, were at the centre of considerable activity. In early March, the citizens were called upon to elect an &quot;Eternal Council&quot; which was to replace the existing town council, but whose duties went far beyond the merely municipal. Surprisingly, neither Pfeiffer nor Müntzer were admitted to the new council, nor to its meetings. Possibly because of this, Müntzer then founded the &quot;Eternal League of God&quot; in late March (but some researchers date this League to September 1524). This was an armed militia, designed not just as a defence league, but also as a God-fearing cadre for the coming apocalypse. It met under a huge white banner which had been painted with a rainbow and decorated with the words &quot;The Word of God will endure forever&quot;. In the surrounding countryside and neighbouring small towns, the events in Mühlhausen found a ready echo, for the peasantry and the urban poor had had news of the great uprising in southwest Germany, and many were ready to join in.
In late April, all of Thuringia was up in arms, with peasant and plebeian troops from various districts mobilized. However, the princes were laying their own plans for the suppression of the revolt. The feudal authorities had far better weapons and more disciplined armies than their subjects. At the beginning of May, the Mühlhausen troop marched around the countryside in north Thuringia, but failed to meet up with other troops, being content to loot and pillage locally.
Luther pitched in very firmly on the side of the princes; he made a tour of southern Saxony – Stolberg, Nordhausen, and the Mansfeld district – in an attempt to dissuade the rebels from action, although in some of these places he was roundly heckled. He followed this up with his pamphlet &quot;Against the Robbing and Murdering Hordes of Peasants&quot;, calling for the ruthless suppression of the revolt. This had a title and a timing that could not have been more ill-considered since it was the German peasantry who at that time died in their thousands at the hands of the princely armies. Estimates put the figure at 70,000–75,000, possibly even as high as 100,000.

At length, on 11 May, Müntzer and what remained of his troops arrived outside the town of Frankenhausen, meeting up with rebels there who had been asking for help for some time. No sooner had they set up camp on a hill than the princes’ army arrived, having already crushed the rebellion in southern Thuringia. On 15 May, battle was joined. It lasted only a few minutes, and left the streams of the hill running with blood. Six thousand rebels were killed, but only a few soldiers. Many more rebels were executed in the following days. Müntzer fled, but was captured as he hid in the upper storey of a house in Frankenhausen. His identity was revealed by a sack of papers and letters which he was clutching. On 27 May, after torture and confession, he was executed alongside Pfeiffer, outside the walls of Mühlhausen, their heads being displayed prominently for years to come as a warning to others.

== Theology ==
Müntzer&#x27;s theology has been the subject of many studies over the years. Modern researchers agree that Müntzer was deeply read and that it was his theology, and not any socio-political dogma, which drove him to stand up to feudal authority. The short paragraphs below attempt to give a very brief summary of his theology.

===Influences and study===
Evident from Müntzer&#x27;s writings is his broad knowledge of aspects of the Christian religion. From 1514 onwards, possibly earlier, he read widely in the early Christian fathers (Tertullian and Cyprian), in the history of the early church (Eusebius and Egesippus), in the mystics of the late medieval period (Suso and Tauler), in Humanist ideas which harked back to Plato, and in the Bible itself. By around 1522, after he had left Prague, most of his theology had matured and settled around some guiding principles, even if some details, such as the identity of &quot;the Elect&quot;, were unclear.

===The spirit, not the letter===
Despite the profusion of biblical quotations in Müntzer&#x27;s writings, it was his doctrine that true belief was dictated by spiritual experience, not by written testimony. The Bible was for him evidence only of spiritual experiences of the past; the words of the Bible still had to be validated by the working of the Spirit in the believer&#x27;s heart. &quot;If someone had never had sight or sound of the Bible at any time in his life, he could still hold the one true Christian faith because of the true teaching of the spirit, just like all those who composed the holy Scripture without any books at all.&quot; The insistence on written, Biblical proof by the &quot;academics&quot; or scholars (this included Luther) meant that it was impossible for the common man to gain a true understanding of the true faith. Müntzer&#x27;s true believers (also known as &quot;the Elect&quot;) were capable of reaching faith through personal suffering, guided by &quot;true servants of God&quot;, and without regard to Catholic or Lutheran-reformed priests.

===Dreams and revelations===
Spiritual revelation came sometimes through dreams and visions and sometimes through suffering. In Zwickau, Müntzer&#x27;s belief in the possibilities of revelation by dream matched the same belief in the sect of radicals led by Nikolaus Storch. Storch was later to confound Luther&#x27;s colleague Melanchthon with plausible arguments about this. Müntzer himself clearly believed in the power of vision and dream, as evidenced by his lengthy and carefully argued &quot;Sermon Before the Princes&quot;, which discussed the dream of Nebuchadnezzar:
===Suffering and pain===
It was essential, in Müntzer&#x27;s view, for a person to experience real suffering and pain – either spiritual or physical – in order to come to a true Christian belief. The theme of hardship and suffering, purgation and sevenfold cleansing, runs through all of his writings.

On the very eve of Battle at Frankenhausen, he had this to say to the people of Allstedt:
===Fear of God and man===
One of the principal dialectics in Müntzer&#x27;s teaching is the opposition of the &quot;Fear of Man&quot; to the &quot;Fear of God&quot;. Regardless of one&#x27;s position in society, it was necessary for the true believer to have a fear of God and to have no fear of man. This was the thrust of his &quot;Sermon Before the Princes&quot; and it was the rallying call in his final letter to Mühlhausen in May 1525: &quot;May the pure, upright fear of God be with you my dear brothers.&quot; In his &quot;Sermon Before the Princes&quot; he stated quite clearly: &quot;The fear of God must be pure, unsullied by any fear of men or creaturely things. How desperately we need a fear like this! For just as it is impossible to fear two masters and be saved, so it is impossible to fear both God and created things and be saved.&quot;

===Apocalypticism===
Interwoven with Müntzer&#x27;s mystical piety, as for many of his contemporaries, was a conviction that the whole cosmos stood at a tipping point. Now God would set right all the wrongs of the world, largely by destruction, but with the active assistance of true Christians. From this would emerge a new age of mankind. In the &quot;Prague Manifesto&quot; he wrote: &quot;O ho, how ripe the rotten apples are! O ho, how rotten the elect have become! The time of the harvest has come! That is why he himself has hired me for his harvest.&quot; In a letter to the people of Erfurt, in May 1525, he wrote:
===&quot;===

In his final confession under torture of May 1525, Müntzer stated that one of the primary aims of himself and his comrades was &quot; – &quot;all things are to be held in common and distribution should be to each according to his need&quot;. This statement has often been cited as evidence of Müntzer&#x27;s &quot;early communism&quot;, but it stands quite alone in all of his writings and letters. It may have been a statement of what his captors feared rather than what Müntzer actually believed. In the same confession, Müntzer is reported as recommending that princes should ride out with a maximum of eight horses and &quot;gentlemen with two&quot;. Müntzer&#x27;s own writings and letters clearly propose that power be taken from the feudal authorities and given to the people. For that proposal, he may be described as a revolutionary, but not proposing redistribution of wealth. Subsequent scholars have analysed Müntzer&#x27;s movement as a communist movement. Friedrich Engels&#x27; analysis of Thomas Müntzer&#x27;s work and the wider German Peasants&#x27; War led him and Karl Marx to conclude that the communist revolution, when it occurred, would be led not by a peasant army but by an urban proletariat.

===Summary===
The doctrines of essential suffering, of spiritual revelation, of denial of the fear of Man - all combined with the expectation of the Apocalypse to place the &quot;Elect&quot; person in total opposition to feudal authority, and to both Catholic and Lutheran teaching. However, this was no individualistic path to salvation. The importance which Müntzer laid on communal activities – the reformed liturgies and the leagues he founded or supported in Zwickau, Allstedt, and Mühlhausen – are central to his ministry. To judge from his writings of 1523 and 1524, it was by no means inevitable that Müntzer would take the road of social revolution. However, it was precisely on this same theological foundation that Müntzer&#x27;s ideas briefly coincided with the aspirations of the peasants and plebeians of 1525. Viewing the uprising as an apocalyptic act of God, he stepped up as &quot;God&#x27;s Servant against the Godless&quot; and took his position as leader of the rebels.

===Differences with Luther===
Müntzer was one of many preachers and theologians caught up in the extraordinary atmosphere of the early Reformation. In this period, from around 1517 to 1525, Martin Luther had no monopoly of the reforms. This was the time not only of Luther, but also of Erasmus of Rotterdam and fellow-Humanists, of the alchemists Paracelsus and Cornelius Agrippa, of localized urban and rural acts of defiance. The social upheavals triggered the Reformation - or more precisely, &#x27;the reformations&#x27;, for it was above all a time of massive dissent, and indeed dissent from dissent; in turn, the reformation of thought triggered further social and political upheavals.

In this roiling pot of ideas, Müntzer quite readily respected Luther for a period and then just as readily rejected the Lutheran doctrines. Although it is clear in retrospect that Müntzer&#x27;s ideas were already diverging from Luther&#x27;s at least as early as the period in Zwickau, Müntzer himself may not have been aware of this. Luther, like Müntzer, had shown an avid interest in the mystic and theologian Johannes Tauler. Müntzer may even have looked at Luther&#x27;s many admiring references to Tauler in his &quot;Theologia Germanica&quot; and assumed him to be a fellow fan of Tauler&#x27;s work. In July 1520, Müntzer was still able to sign off a letter to Luther as &quot;Thomas Müntzer, whom you brought to birth by the gospel&quot;. However, it is clear that Luther considered that Müntzer was moving ahead too fast, and correspondence (now missing) from Wittenberg seems to have contained explicit criticisms of his activities. By March 1522, Müntzer was writing to Melanchthon in Wittenberg, warning that &quot;our most beloved Martin acts ignorantly because he does not want to offend the little ones... Dear brothers, leave your dallying, the time has come! Do not delay, summer is at the door. ... Do not flatter your princes, otherwise you will live to see your undoing.&quot; An attempt at reconciliation with Luther, in a letter written by Müntzer from Allstedt in July 1523, went without reply. In June 1524, however, Luther published his pamphlet &quot;A Letter to the Princes of Saxony concerning the Rebellious Spirit&quot;, which essentially called on Prince Friedrich and Duke Johann to deal firmly with the &quot;rebellious spirit of Allstedt&quot;, this &quot;bloodthirsty Satan&quot;. Luther displayed his own conviction in which he was sure that Müntzer&#x27;s preaching would lead to violence, as noted in his 1524, &quot;Letter to the Princes of Saxony Concerning the Rebellious Spirit.&quot; Müntzer then reacted with his &quot;Vindication and Refutation&quot;, in which he tears into Luther as having an unholy and self-serving alliance with princes and therefore partakes in the tyranny committed to the people. Shortly afterwards, Müntzer described Luther as &quot;Brother Fatted Pig and Brother Soft Life&quot; in his &quot;Sermon Before the Princes&quot;. After the summer of 1524, the tone of the written conflict became ever more bitter on both sides, culminating in Müntzer&#x27;s pamphlet &quot;A Highly-Provoked Vindication and a Refutation of the Unspiritual Soft-living Flesh in Wittenberg&quot; of 1524, and in Luther&#x27;s &quot;A Terrible History and Judgement of God on Thomas Müntzer&quot; of 1525, in which the radical preacher (by then dead) was described as &quot;a murderous and bloodthirsty prophet&quot;.

==Legacy==
During the last two years of his life, Müntzer had come into contact with a number of other radicals; prominent amongst them were Hans Hut, Hans Denck, Melchior Rinck, Hans Römer, and Balthasar Hubmaier. All of them were leaders of the emerging Anabaptist movement, which nurtured similar reformed doctrines to those of Müntzer himself. While it is not appropriate to claim that they were all or consistently &quot;Müntzerites&quot;, it is possible to argue that they all shared some common teaching. A common thread links Müntzer, the early Anabaptists, the &quot;Kingdom of Münster&quot; in North Germany in 1535, the Dutch Anabaptists, the radicals of the English Revolution, and beyond.
There was a short-lived legacy even within the &quot;official&quot; reformed church as well; in the towns where Müntzer had been active, his reformed liturgies were still being used some ten years after his death.

Friedrich Engels and Karl Kautsky claimed him as a precursor of the revolutionaries of more modern times. They based their analysis on the pioneering work of the German liberal historian Wilhelm Zimmermann, whose important three-volume history of the Peasants War appeared in 1843. It is not only as an early &quot;social revolutionary&quot; that Müntzer has historical importance as his activities within the early Reformation movement were influential on Luther and his reforms.
Further interest in Müntzer was spurred at various moments in German (occasionally European) history: during the creation of a German national identity between 1870 and 1914; in the revolutionary era in Germany immediately after 1918; in an East Germany looking for its &quot;own&quot; history after 1945 (Müntzer&#x27;s image was used on the 5 East German Mark banknote); and leading up to the 450th anniversary of the Peasant War in 1975 and the 500th anniversary of Müntzer&#x27;s birth in 1989. In terms of pure statistics, the number of books, articles and essays devoted to Müntzer rose dramatically after 1945. Before that year, around 520 had appeared; between 1945 and 1975, another 500; between 1975 and 2012, 1800.

Since around 1918, the number of fictional works on Müntzer has grown significantly; this encompasses over 200 novels, poems, plays and films, almost all in German. A film of his life was produced in East Germany in 1956, directed by Martin Heilberg and starring Wolfgang Stumpf. In 1989, shortly before the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Peasants&#x27; War Panorama at Bad Frankenhausen was opened, containing the largest oil painting in the world, with Müntzer in central position. The painter was Werner Tübke.

==Müntzer&#x27;s wife==
Very little is known about Müntzer&#x27;s wife Ottilie von Gersen other than the fact that she was a nun who had left a nunnery under the influence of the Reformation movement. Her family name may have been &quot;von Görschen&quot;. She may have been one of a group of sixteen nuns who left the convent at Wiederstedt, some miles north of Allstedt, of whom eleven found refuge in Allstedt. She and Müntzer were married in June 1523. Apart from the son born to her and Müntzer on Easter Day, 1524, it is possible she was again pregnant at the time of her husband&#x27;s death, by which time, the son may also have died. A letter she wrote to Duke Georg on 19 August 1525, pleading for the chance to recover her belongings from Mühlhausen, went unheeded. No further reports of her life have been found.

<text>The mangonel, also called the traction trebuchet, was a type of trebuchet used in Ancient China starting from the Warring States period, and later across Eurasia by the 6th century AD. Unlike the later counterweight trebuchet, the mangonel operated on manpower-pulling cords attached to a lever and sling to launch projectiles.

Although the mangonel required more men to function, it was also less complex and faster to reload than the torsion-powered onager which it replaced in early Medieval Europe. It was replaced as the primary siege weapon in the 12th and 13th centuries by the counterweight trebuchet. A common misconception about the mangonel is that it was a torsion siege engine.

==Etymology==

The word &quot;mangonel&quot; was first attested in English in the 13th century, it is borrowed from Old French &quot;mangonel&quot;, &quot;mangonelle&quot; (&gt; French &quot;mangonneau&quot;). The French word is from Medieval Latin &quot;manganellus&quot;, &quot;mangonellus&quot;, diminutive form of Late Latin &quot;manganum&quot;, itself probably derived from the Greek &quot;mangana&quot;, &quot;a generic term for construction machinery.&quot; or &quot;mágganon&quot; &quot;engine of war, axis of a pulley&quot; 

Mangonel was a general term for medieval stone-throwing artillery and was used more specifically to refer to manually (traction--) powered weapons. It is sometimes wrongly used to refer to the onager. Modern military historians came up with the term &quot;traction trebuchet&quot; to distinguish it from previous torsion machines such as the onager.

The mangonel was called &quot;al-manjanīq&quot;, &quot;arrada&quot;, &quot;shaytani&quot;, or &quot;sultani&quot; in Arabic. In China, the mangonel was called the &quot;pào&quot; (砲).

==History==
===China===

The mangonel originated in ancient China. Torsion-based siege weapons such as the ballista and onager are not known to have been used in China.

The first recorded use of mangonels was in ancient China. They were probably used by the Mohists as early as 4th century BC; descriptions can be found in the &quot;Mozi&quot; (compiled in the 4th century BC). According to the &quot;Mozi&quot;, the mangonel was high with buried below ground, the fulcrum attached was constructed from the wheels of a cart, the throwing arm was long with three quarters above the pivot and a quarter below to which the ropes are attached, and the sling long. The range given for projectiles are , , and . They were used as defensive weapons stationed on walls and sometimes hurled hollowed out logs filled with burning charcoal to destroy enemy siege works. By the 1st century AD, commentators were interpreting other passages in texts such as the &quot;Zuo zhuan&quot; and &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot; as references to the mangonel: &quot;the guai is &#x27;a great arm of wood on which a stone is laid, and this by means of a device [ji] is shot off and so strikes down the enemy. The &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; say that &quot;The flying stones weigh 12 catties and by devices [ji] are shot off 300 paces.&quot; Mangonels went into decline during the Han dynasty due to long periods of peace but became a common siege weapon again during the Three Kingdoms period. They were commonly called stone-throwing machines, thunder carriages, and stone carriages in the following centuries. They were used as ship mounted weapons by 573 for attacking enemy fortifications. It seems that during the early 7th century, improvements were made on mangonels, although it is not explicitly stated what. According to a stele in Barkul celebrating Tang Taizong&#x27;s conquest of what is now Ejin Banner, the engineer Jiang Xingben made great advancements on mangonels that were unknown in ancient times. Jiang Xingben participated in the construction of siege engines for Taizong&#x27;s campaigns against the Western Regions.

In 617 Li Mi (Sui dynasty) constructed 300 mangonels for his assault on Luoyang, in 621 Li Shimin did the same at Luoyang, and onward into the Song dynasty when in 1161, mangonels operated by Song dynasty soldiers fired bombs of lime and sulphur against the ships of the Jin dynasty navy during the Battle of Caishi. During the Jingde period (1004–1007), many young men rose in office due to their military accomplishments, and one such man, Zhang Cun, was said to have possessed no knowledge except how to operate a Whirlwind mangonel. When the Jurchen Jin dynasty (1115–1234) laid siege to Kaifeng in 1126, they attacked with 5,000 mangonels.

====Chinese mangonels====
The &quot;Wujing Zongyao&quot; lists various types of the mangonel:

* Whirlwind – a swivel mangonel for shooting small missiles that could be turned to face any direction
** Whirlwind battery – five whirlwind mangonels combined on a single turntable
* &quot;Pao che&quot; (catapult cart) – a whirlwind mangonel on wheels
* Crouching tiger – medium-sized mangonel considered stronger than the whirlwind type but weaker than the four-footed
* Four-footed – a trestle-frame mangonel for shooting heavier projectiles
** Two-seven component – different weight classes for the four-footed type indicated by the number of poles bound together to create the swinging arm

===Spread===

The mangonel was adopted by various peoples west of China such as the Byzantines, Persians, Arabs, and Avars by the sixth to seventh centuries AD. Some scholars suggest that Avars carried the mangonel westward while others claim that the Byzantines already possessed knowledge of the mangonel beforehand. Regardless of the vector of transmission, it appeared in the eastern Mediterranean by the late 6th century AD, where it replaced torsion powered siege engines such as the ballista and onager. The rapid displacement of torsion siege engines was probably due to a combination of reasons. The mangonel is simpler in design, has a faster rate of fire, increased accuracy, and comparable range and power. It was probably also safer than the twisted cords of torsion weapons, &quot;whose bundles of taut sinews stored up huge amounts of energy even in resting state and were prone to catastrophic failure when in use.&quot; At the same time, the late Roman Empire seems to have fielded &quot;considerably less artillery than its forebears, organised now in separate units, so the weaponry that came into the hands of successor states might have been limited in quantity.&quot; Evidence from Gaul and Germania suggests there was substantial loss of skills and techniques in artillery further west.

According to the &quot;Miracles of Saint Demetrius&quot;, probably written around 620 by John, Archbishop of Thessaloniki, the Avaro-Slavs attacked Thessaloniki in 586 with more than 50 mangonels. The bombardment lasted for hours, but the operators were inaccurate and most of the shots missed their target. When one stone did reach their target, it &quot;demolished the top of the rampart down to the walkway.&quot; The &quot;Miracles&quot; does not provide a clear date of the siege, which could have been in 586 or 597. An argument has been made that the Byzantines were already acquainted with mangonels prior to this based on the &quot;History&quot; written by Theophylact Simocatta in the late 620s. The account contained describes a captured Byzantine soldier named Busas who taught the Avars how to construct a &quot;besieging machine&quot; which led to their conquest of Appiaria in 587. The word used for the machine is &quot;helepolis&quot;, which does not indicate a specific siege engine. It has been variously interpreted as a battering ram, a stone-throwing trebuchet, and a siege tower. Theophylact&#x27;s account is vague on descriptions of the device and why it allowed the Avars to take Appiaria after they had already taken many Roman cities beforehand. The Greek term &quot;manganikon&quot;, from which the Arabic word for trebuchet &quot;mandjanik&quot; is derived, was also first used to describe Avar machines used against Constantinople in 626. Peter Purton notes that the account by Theophylact is not contemporary and likely written when the mangonel was more common. David Graff and Purton argue that the account by Theophylact has chronological problems and does not explain why the machine used by the Avars in the &quot;Miracles&quot; was treated as a novelty in either 586 or 597, since the Byzantines would have known about it in both cases. Yet there are no descriptions of the mangonel in the west prior to the encounter with the Avars.

Purton considers it equally likely for the Avars, Byzantines, or Persians to have learned of the mangonel first in the western world. Michael Fulton says it is at least equally likely that the Avars or some other vector transmitted the technology to the Byzantines, but expressed skepticism that the mangonel was complex enough to require explanation by a captured Byzantine soldier. He described Theophylact&#x27;s account as a &quot;racially motivated explanation of how a supposedly &#x27;barbaric&#x27; people were able to replicate and incorporate a piece of &#x27;civilised&#x27; technology&quot;. Others like Stephen McCotter and John Haldon consider the Avar theory to be the most likely. As McCotter puts it, &quot;there is no good reason to doubt that the Avars may have brought it and the Byzantines copied it.&quot; According to Georgios Kardaras, the idea that the Avars directly learned siegecraft from a Byzantine captive is not credible, as they had been perfectly capable of taking walled Byzantine towns beforehand and had been in contact with other tribes who engaged in siege warfare.

The Byzantines may have used the mangonel in 587 against a Persian fort near Akbas, although the operators did not seem to have handled it very effectively, suggesting that it was still a new weapon. The Persians may have used mangonels against Dara in the early 7th century and against Jerusalem in 614. The Arabs had ship mounted mangonel by 653 and used them at Mecca in 683. The Franks and Saxons adopted the weapon in the 8th century. The &quot;Life of Louis the Pious&quot; contains the earliest western European reference to mangonels in its account of the siege of Tortosa (808–809). In the 890s, Abbo Cernuus described &quot;mango&quot; or &quot;manganaa&quot; used at the Siege of Paris (885–886) which had high posts, presumably meaning they used trebuchet-type throwing arms. In 1173, the Republic of Pisa tried to capture an island castle with mangonels on galleys. Mangonels were also used in India.

===Independent invention===
According to Leife Inge Ree Peterson, a mangonel could have been used at Theodosiopolis in 421 but was &quot;likely an onager&quot;. Peterson says that mangonels may have been independently invented or at least known in the Eastern Mediterranean by 500 AD based on records of different and better artillery weapons, however there is no explicit description of a mangonel. According to Peterson&#x27;s timeline and presumption that the mangonel became widespread throughout the Roman Empire by the mid-6th century, mangonels would also have been used in Spain and Italy by the mid 6th century, in Africa by the 7th century, and by the Franks in the 8th century. Tracy Rihll suggests that the mangonel was independently invented through an evolution of the Byzantine staff-sling, although this has received little support. There are no sources indicating whether Byzantium received the mangonel from East Asia or if it was independently invented.

===Notable uses in history===
The mangonel was most efficient as an anti-personnel weapon, used in a supportive position alongside archers and slingers. Most accounts of mangonels describe them as light artillery weapons while actual penetration of defenses was the result of mining or siege towers. At the Siege of Kamacha in 766, Byzantine defenders used wooden cover to protect themselves from the enemy artillery while inflicting casualties with their stone throwers. Michael the Syrian noted that at the siege of Balis in 823 it was the defenders that suffered from bombardment rather than the fortifications. At the siege of Kaysum, Abdallah ibn Tahir al-Khurasani used artillery to damage houses in the town. The Sack of Amorium in 838 saw the use of mangonels to drive away defenders and destroy wooden defenses. At the siege of Marand in 848, mangonels were used, &quot;reportedly killing 100 and wounding 400 on each side during the eight-month siege.&quot; During the siege of Baghdad in 865, defensive artillery was responsible for repelling an attack on the city gate while mangonels on boats claimed a hundred of the defenders&#x27; lives.

Some exceptionally large and powerful mangonels have been described during the 11th century or later. At the Siege of Manzikert (1054), the Seljuks&#x27; initial siege artillery was countered by the defenders&#x27; own, which shot stones at the besieging machine. In response, the Seljuks constructed another one requiring 400 men to pull and throw stones weighing . A breach was created on the first shot but the machine was burnt down by the defenders. According to Matthew of Edessa, this machine weighed and caused several casualties to the city&#x27;s defenders. Ibn al-Adim describes a mangonel capable of throwing a man in 1089. At the siege of Haizhou in 1161, a mangonel was reported to have had a range of 200 paces (over ). 

===Decline===
West of China, the mangonel remained the primary siege engine until the late 12th century when it was replaced by the counterweight trebuchet. In China the mangonel was the primary siege engine until the counterweight trebuchet was introduced during the Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty in the 13th century. The counterweight trebuchet did not completely replace the mangonel. Despite its greater range, counterweight trebuchets had to be constructed close to the site of the siege unlike mangonels, which were smaller, lighter, cheaper, and easier to take apart and put back together again where necessary. The superiority of the counterweight trebuchet was not clear cut. Of this, the Hongwu Emperor stated in 1388: &quot;The old type of trebuchet was really more convenient. If you have a hundred of those machines, then when you are ready to march, each wooden pole can be carried by only four men. Then when you reach your destination, you encircle the city, set them up, and start shooting!&quot; The mangonel continued to serve as an anti-personnel weapon. The Norwegian text of 1240, &quot;Speculum regale&quot;, explicitly states this division of functions. Mangonels were to be used for hitting people in undefended areas. As late as the Siege of Acre (1291), where the Mamluk Sultanate fielded 72 or 92 trebuchets, the majority were still mangonels while 14 or 15 were counterweight trebuchets. The counterweight trebuchets were unable to create a breach in Acre&#x27;s walls and the Mamluks entered the city by sapping the northeast corner of the outer wall. The Templar of Tyre described the faster firing mangonels as more dangerous to the defenders than the counterweight trebuchets.

<text>Aortic stenosis (AS or AoS) is the narrowing of the exit of the left ventricle of the heart (where the aorta begins), such that problems result. It may occur at the aortic valve as well as above and below this level. It typically gets worse over time. Symptoms often come on gradually with a decreased ability to exercise often occurring first. If heart failure, loss of consciousness, or heart related chest pain occur due to AS the outcomes are worse. Loss of consciousness typically occurs with standing or exercising. Signs of heart failure include shortness of breath especially when lying down, at night, or with exercise, and swelling of the legs. Thickening of the valve without causing obstruction is known as aortic sclerosis.
Causes include being born with a bicuspid aortic valve, and rheumatic fever; a normal valve may also harden over the decades due to calcification. A bicuspid aortic valve affects about one to two percent of the population. As of 2014 rheumatic heart disease mostly occurs in the developing world. Risk factors are similar to those of coronary artery disease and include smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and being male. The aortic valve usually has three leaflets and is located between the left ventricle of the heart, and the aorta. AS typically results in a heart murmur. Its severity can be divided into mild, moderate, severe, and very severe, distinguishable by ultrasound scan of the heart.
Aortic stenosis is typically followed using repeated ultrasound scans. Once it has become severe, treatment primarily involves valve replacement surgery, with transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) being an option in some who are at high risk from surgery. Valves may either be mechanical or bioprosthetic, with each having risks and benefits. Another less invasive procedure, balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV), may result in benefit, but for only a few months. Complications such as heart failure may be treated in the same way as in those with mild to moderate AS. In those with severe disease a number of medications should be avoided, including ACE inhibitors, nitroglycerin, and some beta blockers. Nitroprusside or phenylephrine may be used in those with decompensated heart failure depending on the blood pressure.
Aortic stenosis is the most common valvular heart disease in the developed world. It affects about 2% of people who are over 65 years of age. Estimated rates were not known in most of the developing world as of 2014. In those who have symptoms, without repair the chance of death at five years is about 50% and at 10 years is about 90%. Aortic stenosis was first described by French physician Lazare Rivière in 1663.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms related to aortic stenosis depend on the degree of stenosis. Most people with mild to moderate aortic stenosis do not have symptoms. Symptoms usually present in individuals with severe aortic stenosis, though they may also occur in those with mild to moderate aortic stenosis. The three main symptoms of aortic stenosis are loss of consciousness, anginal chest pain and shortness of breath with activity or other symptoms of heart failure such as shortness of breath while lying flat, episodes of shortness of breath at night, or swollen legs and feet. It may also be accompanied by the characteristic &quot;Dresden china&quot; appearance of pallor with a light flush. 

===Angina===
Angina in setting of heart failure also increases the risk of death. In people with angina, the 5-year mortality rate is 50% if the aortic valve is not replaced.

Angina in the setting of AS occurs due to left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) that is caused by the constant production of increased pressure required to overcome the pressure gradient caused by the AS. While the muscular layer of the left ventricle thickens, the arteries that supply the muscle do not get significantly longer or bigger, so the muscle may not receive enough blood supply to meet its oxygen requirement. This ischemia may first be evident during exercise when the heart muscle requires increased blood supply to compensate for the increased workload. The individual may complain of anginal chest pain with exertion. Exercise stress testing with or without imaging is strictly contraindicated in symptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis. Exercise stress test is now recommended by current guidelines in asymptomatic patients and may provide incremental prognostic value.

Eventually, however, the heart muscle will require more blood supply at rest than can be supplied by the coronary artery branches. At this point there may be signs of &quot;ventricular strain pattern&quot; (ST segment depression and T wave inversion) on the EKG, suggesting subendocardial ischemia. The subendocardium is the region that is most susceptible to ischemia because it is the most distant from the epicardial coronary arteries.

===Syncope===
Syncope (fainting spells) from aortic valve stenosis is usually exertional. In the setting of heart failure it increases the risk of death. In people with syncope, the three-year mortality rate is 50% if the aortic valve is not replaced.

It is unclear why aortic stenosis causes syncope. One theory is that severe AS produces a nearly fixed cardiac output. When a person with aortic stenosis exercises, their peripheral vascular resistance will decrease as the blood vessels of the skeletal muscles dilate to allow the muscles to receive more blood to allow them to do more work. This decrease in peripheral vascular resistance is normally compensated for by an increase in the cardiac output. Since people with severe AS cannot increase their cardiac output, the blood pressure falls and the person will faint due to decreased blood perfusion to the brain.

A second theory is that during exercise the high pressures generated in the hypertrophied left ventricle cause a vasodepressor response, which causes a secondary peripheral vasodilation that, in turn, causes decreased blood flow to the brain resulting in loss of consciousness. Indeed, in aortic stenosis, because of the fixed obstruction to blood flow out from the heart, it may be impossible for the heart to increase its output to offset peripheral vasodilation.

A third mechanism may sometimes be operative. Due to the hypertrophy of the left ventricle in aortic stenosis, including the consequent inability of the coronary arteries to adequately supply blood to the myocardium (see &quot;Angina&quot; below), abnormal heart rhythms may develop. These can lead to syncope.

Finally, in calcific aortic stenosis at least, the calcification in and around the aortic valve can progress and extend to involve the electrical conduction system of the heart. If that occurs, the result may be heart block, a potentially lethal condition of which syncope may be a symptom.

===Congestive heart failure===
Congestive heart failure (CHF) carries a grave prognosis in people with AS. People with CHF attributable to AS have a 2-year mortality rate of 50% if the aortic valve is not replaced. CHF in the setting of AS is due to a combination of left ventricular hypertrophy with fibrosis, systolic dysfunction (a decrease in the ejection fraction) and diastolic dysfunction (elevated filling pressure of the LV).

===Associated symptoms===
In Heyde&#x27;s syndrome, aortic stenosis is associated with gastrointestinal bleeding due to angiodysplasia of the colon. Recent research has shown that the stenosis causes a form of von Willebrand disease by breaking down its associated coagulation factor (factor VIII-associated antigen, also called von Willebrand factor), due to increased turbulence around the stenotic valve.

===Complications===
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the American Heart Association changed its recommendations regarding antibiotic prophylaxis for endocarditis. Specifically, as of 2007 it is recommended that such prophylaxis should be limited only to those with prosthetic heart valves, those with previous episode(s) of endocarditis, and those with certain types of congenital heart disease.

Since the stenosed aortic valve may limit the heart&#x27;s output, people with aortic stenosis are at risk of syncope and dangerously low blood pressure should they use any of a number of medications for cardiovascular diseases that often coexist with aortic stenosis. Examples include nitroglycerin, nitrates, ACE inhibitors, terazosin (Hytrin), and hydralazine. Note that all of these substances lead to peripheral vasodilation. Under normal circumstances, in the absence of aortic stenosis, the heart is able to increase its output and thereby offset the effect of the dilated blood vessels. In some cases of aortic stenosis, however, due to the obstruction of blood flow out of the heart caused by the stenosed aortic valve, cardiac output cannot be increased. Low blood pressure or syncope may ensue.

==Causes==
Aortic stenosis is most commonly caused by age-related progressive calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) (&gt;50% of cases), with a mean age of 65 to 70 years. CAVD is the build-up of calcium on the cusps of the valve, and this calcification causes hardening and stenosis of the valve. Another major cause of aortic stenosis is the calcification of a congenital bicuspid aortic valve or, more rarely, a congenital unicuspid aortic valve. Those with unicuspid aortic valves typically need intervention when very young, often as a newborn, while those with congenital bicuspid aortic valve make up 30-40% of those presenting during adulthood and typically present earlier (ages 40+ to 50+) than those with tricuspid aortic valves (65+).

Acute rheumatic fever post-inflammatory is the cause of less than 10% of cases. Rare causes of aortic stenosis include Fabry disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, Paget disease, high blood uric acid levels, and infection.

==Pathophysiology==

The human aortic valve normally consists of three cusps or leaflets and has an opening of 3.0-4.0 square centimeters. When the left ventricle contracts, it forces blood through the valve into the aorta and subsequently to the rest of the body. When the left ventricle expands again, the aortic valve closes and prevents the blood in the aorta from flowing backward (regurgitation) into the left ventricle. In aortic stenosis, the opening of the aortic valve becomes narrowed or constricted (stenotic) (e.g., due to calcification). Degenerative (the most common variety), and bicuspid aortic stenosis both begin with damage to endothelial cells from increased mechanical stress. Inflammation is thought to be involved in the earlier stages of the pathogenesis of AS and its associated risk factors are known to promote the deposition of LDL cholesterol and lipoprotein(a), a highly damaging substance, into the aortic valve, causing significant damage and stenosis over time. Infiltration of inflammatory cells (macrophages, T lymphocytes), followed by the release of inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-1-beta and transforming growth factor beta-1 occurs.
Subsequently, fibroblasts differentiate into osteoblast-like cells, which results in abnormal bone matrix deposition leading to progressive valvular calcification and stenosis.

As a consequence of this stenosis, the left ventricle must generate a higher pressure with each contraction to effectively move blood forward into the aorta. Initially, the LV generates this increased pressure by thickening its muscular walls (myocardial hypertrophy). The type of hypertrophy most commonly seen in AS is known as concentric hypertrophy, in which the walls of the LV are (approximately) equally thickened.

In the later stages, the left ventricle dilates, the wall thins, and the systolic function deteriorates (resulting in impaired ability to pump blood forward). Morris and Innasimuthu et al. showed that different coronary anatomy is associated with different valve diseases. Research was in progress in 2010 to see if different coronary anatomy might lead to turbulent flow at the level of valves leading to inflammation and degeneration.

==Diagnosis==

=== Palpation ===
Aortic stenosis is most often diagnosed when it is asymptomatic and can sometimes be detected during routine examination of the heart and circulatory system. Good evidence exists to demonstrate that certain characteristics of the peripheral pulse can rule in the diagnosis. In particular, there may be a slow and/or sustained upstroke of the arterial pulse, and the pulse may be of low volume. This is sometimes referred to as &quot;pulsus parvus et tardus&quot;. There may also be a noticeable delay between the first heart sound (on auscultation) and the corresponding pulse in the carotid artery (&#x27;apical-carotid delay&#x27;). In a similar manner, there may be a delay between the appearance of each pulse in the brachial artery (in the arm) and the radial artery (in the wrist).

=== Auscultation ===
The first heart sound may be followed by a sharp ejection sound (&quot;ejection click&quot;) best heard at the lower left sternal border and the apex, and, thus, appear to be &quot;split&quot;. The ejection sound, caused by the impact of left ventricular outflow against the partially fused aortic valve leaflets, is more commonly associated with a mobile bicuspid aortic valve than an immobile calcified aortic valve. The intensity of this sound does not vary with respiration, which helps distinguish it from the ejection click produced by a stenotic pulmonary valve, which will diminish slightly in intensity during inspiration.

An easily heard systolic, crescendo-decrescendo (i.e., &#x27;ejection&#x27;) murmur is heard loudest at the upper right sternal border, at the 2nd right intercostal space, and radiates to the carotid arteries bilaterally. The murmur increases with squatting and decreases with standing and isometric muscular contraction such as the Valsalva maneuver, which helps distinguish it from hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). The murmur is louder during expiration but is also easily heard during inspiration. The more severe the degree of the stenosis, the later the peak occurs in the crescendo-decrescendo of the murmur.

The second heart sound (A2) tends to become decreased and softer as the aortic stenosis becomes more severe. This is a result of the increasing calcification of the valve preventing it from &quot;snapping&quot; shut and producing a sharp, loud sound. Due to increases in left ventricular pressure from the stenotic aortic valve, over time the ventricle may hypertrophy, resulting in diastolic dysfunction. As a result, there may be a fourth heart sound due to the stiff ventricle. With continued increases in ventricular pressure, dilatation of the ventricle will occur, and a third heart sound may be manifest.

Finally, aortic stenosis often co-exists with some degree of aortic insufficiency (aortic regurgitation). Hence, the physical exam in aortic stenosis may also reveal signs of the latter, for example, an early diastolic decrescendo murmur. Indeed, when both valve abnormalities are present, the expected findings of either may be modified or may not even be present. Rather, new signs that reflect the presence of simultaneous aortic stenosis and insufficiency, e.g., pulsus bisferiens, emerge.

According to a meta-analysis, the most useful findings for ruling in aortic stenosis in the clinical setting were slow rate of rise of the carotid pulse (positive likelihood ratio ranged 2.8–130 across studies), mid to late peak intensity of the murmur (positive likelihood ratio, 8.0–101), and decreased intensity of the second heart sound (positive likelihood ratio, 3.1–50).

Other peripheral signs include:
* sustained, heaving apex beat, which is not displaced unless systolic dysfunction of the left ventricle has developed
* A precordial thrill
* narrowed pulse pressure

=== Blood tests ===
For asymptomatic severe aortic valve stenosis, the European guidelines recommend B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) measurements to aid risk stratification and optimize the timing of aortic valve replacement surgery. In patients with non-severe asymptomatic aortic valve stenosis, increased age- and sex adjusted N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels alone and combined with a 50% or greater increase from baseline had been found associated with increased event rates of aortic valve stenosis related events (cardiovascular death, hospitalization with heart failure due to progression of aortic valve stenosis, or aortic valve replacement surgery). In patients with non-severe asymptomatic aortic valve stenosis and no overt coronary artery disease, the increased troponin T (above 14 pg/mL) was found associated with an increased 5-year event rate of ischemic cardiac events (myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, or coronary artery bypass surgery).

===Electrocardiogram===
Although aortic stenosis does not lead to any &quot;specific&quot; findings on the electrocardiogram (ECG), it still often leads to a number of electrocardiographic abnormalities. ECG manifestations of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) are common in aortic stenosis and arise as a result of the stenosis having placed a chronically high-pressure load on the left ventricle (with LVH being the expected response to chronic pressure loads on the left ventricle no matter what the cause).

As noted above, the calcification process that occurs in aortic stenosis can progress to extend beyond the aortic valve and into the electrical conduction system of the heart. Evidence of this phenomenon may rarely include ECG patterns characteristic of certain types of heart block such as Left bundle branch block.

===Heart catheterization===
Cardiac chamber catheterization provides a definitive diagnosis, indicating severe stenosis in valve area of &lt;1.0 cm2 (normally about 3 cm2). It can directly measure the pressure on both sides of the aortic valve. The pressure gradient may be used as a decision point for treatment. It is useful in symptomatic people before surgery. The standard for diagnosis of aortic stenosis is non-invasive testing with echocardiography. Cardiac catheterization is reserved for cases in which there is a discrepancy between the clinical picture and non-invasive testing, due to risks inherent to crossing the aortic valve, such as stroke.

===Echocardiogram===
Echocardiogram (heart ultrasound) is the best non-invasive way to evaluate the aortic valve anatomy and function.
The aortic valve area can be calculated non-invasively using echocardiographic flow velocities. Using the velocity of the blood through the valve, the pressure gradient across the valve can be calculated by the continuity equation or using the modified Bernoulli&#x27;s equation: A normal aortic valve has a gradient of only a few mmHg. A decreased valvular area causes increased pressure gradient, and these parameters are used to classify and grade the aortic stenosis as mild, moderate or severe. The pressure gradient can be abnormally low in the presence of mitral stenosis, heart failure, co-existent aortic regurgitation and also ischaemic heart disease (disease related to the decreased blood supply and oxygen causing ischemia).

Echocardiogram may also show left ventricular hypertrophy, thickened and immobile aortic valve, and dilated aortic root. However, it may appear deceptively normal in acute cases.

===Chest X-ray===
A chest X-ray can also assist in the diagnosis and provide clues as to the severity of the disease, showing the degree of calcification of the valve, and in a chronic condition, an enlarged left ventricle and atrium.

=== Computer tomography ===
The use of CT calcium scoring is gaining spread as a diagnostic tool to complement echo in the assessment of patients with aortic stenosis. Aortic valve calcium scoring by multidetector computed tomography (CT-AVC) is used to quantify the degree of calcification of the aortic valve. According to the 2021 ESC/EACTS Guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease the recommended thresholds indicating severe aortic stenosis are &gt; 1200 AU in women and &gt; 2000 AU in men.

==Management==
Treatment is generally not necessary in people without symptoms. In moderate cases echocardiography is performed every 1–2 years to monitor the progression, possibly complemented with a cardiac stress test. In severe cases, echocardiography is performed every 3–6 months. In both moderate and mild cases, the person should immediately make a revisit or be admitted for inpatient care if any new related symptoms appear. There are no therapeutic options currently available to treat people with aortic valve stenosis; however, studies in 2014 indicated that the disease occurs as a result of active cellular processes, suggesting that targeting these processes may lead to viable therapeutic approaches.

===Medication===

Observational studies demonstrated an association between lowered cholesterol with statins and decreased progression, but a randomized clinical trial published in 2005 failed to find any effect on calcific aortic stenosis. The effect of statins on the progression of AS is unclear. A 2007 study found a slowing of aortic stenosis with rosuvastatin. In 2013 it was reported that trials did not show any benefit in slowing AS progression, but did demonstrate a decrease in ischemic cardiovascular events.

In general, medical therapy has relatively poor efficacy in treating aortic stenosis. However, it may be useful to manage commonly coexisting conditions that correlate with aortic stenosis:
* Any angina is generally treated with beta-blockers and/or calcium blockers. Nitrates are contraindicated due to their potential to cause profound hypotension in aortic stenosis.
* Any hypertension is treated aggressively, but caution must be taken in administering beta-blockers. The optimal blood pressure in patients with asymptomatic aortic stenosis and no manifest atherosclerotic disease or diabetes mellitus was found to be a systolic blood pressure of 130-139 mmHg and a diastolic blood pressure of 70-90 mmHg.
* Any heart failure is generally treated with digoxin and diuretics, and, if not contraindicated, cautious administration of ACE inhibitors.

=== Aortic valve repair ===

Aortic valve repair or aortic valve reconstruction describes the reconstruction of both form and function of the native and dysfunctioning aortic valve. Most frequently it is applied for the treatment of aortic regurgitation. It can also become necessary for the treatment of an aortic aneurysm, less frequently for congenital aortic stenosis.  

===Aortic valve replacement===

In adults, symptomatic severe aortic stenosis usually requires aortic valve replacement (AVR). While Surgical AVR has remained the most effective treatment for this disease process and is currently recommended for patients after the onset of symptoms, aortic valve replacement approaches included open-heart surgery, minimally invasive cardiac surgery (MICS), and minimally invasive catheter-based (percutaneous) aortic valve replacement. However, surgical aortic valve replacement is well-studied, and generally has a good and well-established longer-term prognosis.

A diseased aortic valve is most commonly replaced using a surgical procedure with either a mechanical or a tissue valve. The procedure is done either in an open-heart surgical procedure or, in a smaller but growing number of cases, a minimally invasive cardiac surgery (MICS) procedure. Minimally invasive approach via right minithoracotomy is most beneficial in the high risk patient such as the elderly, the obese, those with chronic obstructive pulmonary, chronic kidney disease and those requiring re-operative surgery.

===Transcatheter aortic valve replacement===
Globally more than 250,000 people have received transcatheter aortic valve intervention (TAVI). For people who are not candidates for surgical valve replacement and most patients who are older than 75, TAVI may be a suitable alternative. Conduction abnormalities requiring permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation remain a common finding after TAVI due to the close proximity of the atrioventricular conduction system to the aortic root.

===Balloon valvuloplasty===
For infants and children, balloon valvuloplasty, where a balloon is inflated to stretch the valve and allow greater flow, may also be effective. In adults, however, it is generally ineffective, as the valve tends to return to a stenosed state. The surgeon will make a small incision at the top of the person&#x27;s leg and proceed to insert the balloon into the artery. The balloon is then advanced up to the valve and is inflated to stretch the valve open.

===Heart failure===
Acute decompensated heart failure due to AS may be temporarily managed by an intra-aortic balloon pump while pending surgery. In those with high blood pressure nitroprusside may be carefully used. Phenylephrine may be used in those with very low blood pressure.

==Prognosis==
If untreated, severe symptomatic aortic stenosis carries a poor prognosis, with a 2-year mortality rate of 50-60% and a 3-year survival rate of less than 30%. Prognosis after aortic valve replacement for people younger than 65 is about five years less than that of the general population; for people older than 65 it is about the same.

==Epidemiology==
Approximately 2% of people over the age of 65, 3% of people over age 75, and 4% percent of people over age 85 have aortic valve stenosis. The prevalence is increasing with the aging population in North America and Europe.

Risk factors known to influence disease progression of AS include factors similar to those of coronary artery disease such as hypertension, advanced age, being male, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, metabolic syndrome, and end-stage kidney disease.

==History==
Aortic stenosis was first described by French physician Lazare Rivière in 1663.

==Research==
People on bisphosphonates were found in a 2010 study to have less progression of aortic stenosis, and some regressed. This finding led to multiple trials, ongoing . Subsequent research failed to confirm the initial positive result.

<text>Abdullah Gan, is a mountainous region of Afghanistan. The population there are primarily members of the Shia Muslim Hazara ethnic group. They were particularly obstinate in their opposition to the hard-line Sunni Taliban regime.

Throughout the war, the Taliban laid siege to Abdullah Gan, refusing to allow any aid through. Villagers caught trying to bring food up from Zari were beaten.

<text>Ujjal Dev Dosanjh (; born September 9, 1947) is a Canadian lawyer and politician. He served as the 33rd premier of British Columbia from 2000 to 2001 and as a Liberal Party of Canada member of Parliament from 2004 to 2011. He was minister of health from 2004 until 2006, when the party lost government. He then served in the Official Opposition from January 2006 until 2011. Dosanjh was one of four visible minorities to serve in Paul Martin&#x27;s Ministry.

Prior to being involved in federal politics, he spent ten years in provincial politics. He was elected in the Vancouver-Kensington riding in 1991 as a member of the British Columbia New Democratic Party (BC NDP) and was re-elected there in 1996. He served as the Attorney General of British Columbia from August 1995 to February 2000. When the leader of his party resigned in 1999, Dosanjh put himself forward as a candidate and won the leadership vote. With the win, he became Canada&#x27;s first Indo-Canadian provincial leader. He served as the 33rd Premier of British Columbia until June 2001 when he lost the province&#x27;s general election. He was the last NDP premier of the province until John Horgan was elevated to the position in 2017.

Born in a village in the Jalandhar district of Punjab, India, Dosanjh emigrated to the United Kingdom at the age of 17 before moving to Canada almost four years later. He worked numerous manual labour jobs and attended university, studying political science. He earned his law degree at the University of British Columbia and opened his own law firm. He has been a vocal opponent of violence and extremism.

==Early life and career==
Ujjal Dosanjh was born in Dosanjh Kalan, a village in Jalandhar, India, in 1947 after the fall of British Colonial India.

After moving to another village, he lived with his grandfather, Moola Singh Bains, who had established a primary school. Dosanjh gained an early interest in politics from listening to debates between his father, a follower of Jawaharlal Nehru and Indian National Congress, and his grandfather, a former British Raj freedom fighter and socialist. 

Dosanjh wanted to pursue an education in political science, but his father wanted him to be a doctor. In 1964, at the age of 17, Dosanjh left India for the United Kingdom where he could pursue his own interests. In London he learned English and worked as an assistant editor for a Punjabi-language newspaper. He emigrated to Canada three and a half years later, arriving in British Columbia on May 12, 1968, to live with his aunt. He completed his Bachelor of Arts degree in political science. He went on to earn a law degree from the University of British Columbia Faculty of Law in 1976, and was called to the bar the following year. During this time he taught English as a second language courses at Vancouver Community College and worked as an assistant editor of a local Punjabi newspaper. He established his own law practice in 1979, specializing in family and personal injury law. His involvement with community organizations included founding the Farm Workers’ Legal Information Service (later Canadian Farm Workers&#x27; Union), serving on the board of directors for BC Civil Liberties Association and the Vancouver Multicultural Society, and the Labour Advocacy Research Association, as well as volunteer work with MOSAIC Immigrant Services Centre, and the South Vancouver Neighbourhood House.

A prominent moderate Sikh in Vancouver, Dosanjh spoke out against violence by Sikh extremists who advocated Khalistani independence from India. As a result of these views, in February 1985 he was attacked in the parking lot of his law office by an assailant wielding an iron bar. Dosanjh, 37 at the time, suffered a broken hand and received 80 stitches in his head.

He was targeted again, on 26 December 1999, while he was a member of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia, when his constituency office was broken into and a Molotov cocktail left burning on a table.

Dosanjh and his wife Raminder have three sons. In April 2000, his middle son, Aseem, was charged with assaulting an Ontario police officer during a bar brawl, but was found not guilty. Dosanjh has travelled back to India several times, on official state business and for personal reasons, since emigrating. In January 2003, he was awarded the Pravasi Bharatiya Samman (Expatriate Indian Honour) from Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in New Delhi. The award recognises individual excellence in various fields for persons of Indian origin across the world.

In 2014, author Doug Welbanks published a biography, &quot;Unbreakable: The Ujjal Dosanjh Story&quot;.

==Provincial politics==
Dosanjh ran as the British Columbia New Democratic Party candidate in the Vancouver South riding in the 1979 and 1983 provincial elections. He lost both times to the BC Social Credit Party candidates. He ran in the 1991 provincial election in the Vancouver-Kensington riding where he won as his party came to power. He would be re-elected in that same riding in the 1996 provincial election. He spent his first few years as a Member of the Legislative Assembly as a backbencher. In 1993, he chaired the Select Standing Committee on Parliamentary Reform, Ethical Conduct, Standing Orders and Private Bills. He served two years as caucus chair for his party until April 10, 1995, when Premier Mike Harcourt dismissed Robin Blencoe from his cabinet and replaced him with Dosanjh as Minister of Government Services and Minister Responsible for Sports. A month later, in a small cabinet shuffle upon the resignation of Moe Sihota, Harcourt added Minister Responsible for Multiculturalism and Human Rights to Dosanjh&#x27;s portfolio. In another cabinet shuffle, as Sihota was re-instated into the cabinet in August, Dosanjh&#x27;s portfolio was changed to Minister Responsible for Multiculturalism, Human Rights and Immigration and he was appointed Attorney General.

As Attorney General, Dosanjh oversaw the resolution of the Gustafsen Lake Standoff involving the Secwepemc Nation, set up a database for registering violent offenders, established a hate crime division in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and lobbied for more police officers, probation officers, and judiciary. At the same time his office drew criticism for reducing legal aid and closing courthouses. As the Minister Responsible for Multiculturalism, Human Rights and Immigration he successfully lobbied for laws giving same-sex couples the equal rights and responsibilities for child support, custody and access. In early 1999, a special prosecutor under the RCMP opened an investigation into possible influence peddling by Premier Glen Clark concerning casino licensing. On March 4, after the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) raided the Premier&#x27;s house, they briefed Attorney General Dosanjh, whose office had to assist, and placed him under a gag order. The order was lifted on August 13, he informed Clark, and called a press conference, after which Clark resigned as Premier. Dosanjh&#x27;s actions were variously criticized for not informing his party caucus and not going public sooner, and applauded for avoiding perceptions of conflict of interest despite his power to intervene.

==Premier of British Columbia==
The leadership convention to replace Clark was set for February 20, 2000. Dosanjh was among the front runners, along with Corky Evans, Gordon Wilson, and Joy MacPhail who all had served at various cabinet posts. Clark, Wilson and fellow MLA Moe Sihota campaigned specifically against Dosanjh. MacPhail dropped out and endorsed Dosanjh followed by Wilson dropping out and endorsing Evans. Dosanjh was successful and became Premier on February 24, 2000, Canada&#x27;s first Indo-Canadian provincial leader.

As Premier for two and a half sessions of the 36th Parliament, between February 24, 2000 and June 5, 2001, Dosanjh gave priority to issues of health care, education, and balanced budgets. A boost in government revenue from rapidly expanding oil and gas development, led Dosanjh to direct the Finance Minister to draft balanced budget legislation. With the previous year&#x27;s budget unexpectedly in surplus and increased revenue expected to continue, Dosanjh was able to keep the provincial budget in surplus while increasing spending by 8% in the 2001 budget year. The increased spending was mostly directed to renovations of hospital, public schools and higher education institutions, as well as building cancer treatment centers, lowering post-secondary tuition fees, and creating significantly more new spaces in the province&#x27;s apprenticeship program and post-secondary institutions. Dosanjh became the first provincial leader to march in a gay pride parade and the provincial government adopted the &quot;Definition of Spouse Amendment Act&quot; which extended equal rights to same-sex couples. With Dosanjh as Premier the Legislative Assembly adopted the &quot;Tobacco Damages and Health Care Recovery Act&quot;, which permitted lawsuits against tobacco organizations to re-coup associated health care expenses, the &quot;Sex Offender Registry Act&quot;, and the &quot;Protection of Public Participation Act&quot; which prevented lawsuits against citizens who participated in public processes. 

However, the BC NDP were deeply unpopular within the province, reaching a low at 15% support in opinion polls at the time of Glen Clark&#x27;s resignation as Premier in August 1999. With Dosanjh as leader, support had risen to 21% by August 2000. Dosanjh was consistently ranked higher personal popularity over opposition leader Gordon Campbell until the run-up to the May 16, 2001 provincial election. Dosanjh and the BC NDP knew they would not be reelected, so they concentrated their campaign to a few ridings in the Lower Mainland which were still considered competitive. Their campaign focused on the expanding economy, issues of health care and education, and Dosanjh&#x27;s personal popularity over Campbell. Dosanjh conceded defeat a week before the election, but requested voters consider making the NDP a strong opposition party. After the vote on May 16, Dosanjh lost his seat in Vancouver-Kensington along with all but two members of his Cabinet in the second-worst defeat of a sitting provincial government in Canada. The BC Liberals won all 77 other seats.

==Federal politics==
Following the election loss Dosanjh returned to practicing law and let his party membership lapse. There had been speculation dating back to October 2002 that Dosanjh was interested in joining the Liberal Party of Canada. New Democratic Party leader Jack Layton approached Dosanjh in 2003 to see if he was interested in running as a federal candidate but Dosanjh refused. In March 2004, with a federal election expected in the spring or summer, Prime Minister Paul Martin approached Dosanjh to be a candidate for the Liberal Party of Canada. Dosanjh agreed and Martin appointed him to Vancouver South over two other nomination candidates while announcing Dosanjh as part of a team of BC star candidates along with economist David Emerson, union leader Dave Haggard, community activist Shirley Chan and Liberal party organizer Bill Cunningham. The advertising of Dosanjh emphasized the party&#x27;s socially progressive aspect. In the June election Dosanjh won his riding with 44.5% of the vote.

===38th Canadian Parliament===
In the 38th Canadian Parliament, Dosanjh was appointed Minister of Health in the federal Cabinet. As Health Minister, Dosanjh strongly supported Canada&#x27;s existing single-tier, publicly funded health-care system. Dosanjh introduced legislation to make cigarettes fire safe, new regulations to further limit lead content in children&#x27;s jewelry, and supported an NDP motion to ban trans fats. He advocated that Canada ratify the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which they did in November 2004. Dosanjh funded a program to revise the Canada food guide to include more multicultural foods and another program to integrate foreign-trained medical professionals into the health-care system. Supported by a unanimous vote in the House of Commons, the government agreed to compensate the 6,000 Canadians infected with hepatitis C from tainted blood transfusion. 

Along with Prime Minister Martin, a 10-year, $41 billion funding plan was negotiated with the provinces to deliver health care – with $5.5 billion to specifically address wait times that had been an election issue during the 2004 federal election – but they rejected Premiers&#x27; demands for a national program to purchase pharmaceuticals in bulk. As the Minister of Health, Dosanjh introduced Bill C-12 &quot;An Act to prevent the introduction and spread of communicable diseases&quot; which updated the 1985 &quot;Quarantine Act&quot;; it was given royal assent in May 2005.

In May 2005, opposition MP Gurmant Grewal accused Dosanjh and the Prime Minister&#x27;s Chief of Staff, Tim Murphy, of attempting to bribe him with an ambassadorship and a senate seat for his wife, Nina Grewal, if he would cross the floor or abstain from a crucial upcoming vote. Grewal released tapes he secretly recorded of the conversation between Dosanjh, Grewal, and Murphy. Dosanjh claimed innocence and accused Grewal of altering the tapes to imply wrongdoing and the Prime Minister dismissed calls to remove Dosanjh from cabinet. Audio analysis concluded that the tapes were altered and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police did not pursue any criminal investigations. Nevertheless, fellow MP John Reynolds filed a complaint with the Law Society of British Columbia accusing Dosanjh of violating the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; and the society&#x27;s Professional Conduct Handbook. The Law Society reviewed the affair and concluded that Grewal had attempted to elicit rewards for his compliance but cleared Dosanjh and Murphy of misconduct charges.

===39th Canadian Parliament===
In the January 2006 federal election, Dosanjh decisively won his riding against Tarlok Sablok, the Indo-Canadian Conservative candidate, and the community activist and NDP candidate Bev Meslo. With the Liberal party forming the Official Opposition, Dosanjh became the critic for National Defence and sat on the Standing Committee on National Defence and the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development. In the December 2006 Liberal leadership race he supported Bob Rae, a fellow former-NDP premier. When Rae was eliminated on the final ballot, Dosanjh supported Stéphane Dion. With Dion as the new leader, Dosanjh remained on the two committees but his critic responsibility was moved to Foreign Affairs. Dosanjh suffered a mild heart attack on the morning of February 13, 2007, outside the House of Commons. He was attended by fellow MP Carolyn Bennett, who is also a doctor, and he was rushed to hospital where a successful operation to remove a blood clot near his heart was performed. In the second session of the 39th Parliament, from October 2007 to September 2008, Dosanjh sat on the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security and the Special Committee on the Canadian Mission in Afghanistan, and his critic responsibility was moved Public Safety.

===40th Canadian Parliament===
The next election was called for October 2008. Dosanjh faced sociologist Wai Young running for the Conservatives, health worker Ann Chambers running for the NDP, and an IT consultant, Csaba Gulyas for the Green Party. Dosanjh won by 33 votes over Young, both receiving 38.4% of the vote. A recount confirmed Dosanjh&#x27;s victory but only by a margin of 22 votes. The Conservative Party requested a second, judicial recount, which again confirmed Dosanjh as the victor. In the 40th Canadian Parliament, with his party once again forming the official opposition, Dosanjh was appointed the National Defence critic for the first parliamentary session which was short-lived. During the 2008–09 Canadian parliamentary dispute he defended the proposed coalition government as a reaction to inappropriate leadership on economic issues by the existing government. When Dion resigned as party leader, Dosanjh considered but did not run for leadership citing his inability to speak French and again supported Rae&#x27;s bid. In October 2009, Michael Ignatieff appointed Dosanjh as the Liberals&#x27; critic for National Defence.

When the 40th Parliament re-convened for its 2nd session Dosanjh continued as the National Defence critic and served on the Standing Committee on National Defence, as well as the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, and the Special Committee on the Canadian Mission in Afghanistan. In the 3rd session of the 40th Parliament Dosanjh continued with the Standing Committee on National Defence and the Special Committee on the Canadian Mission in Afghanistan, but also sat with the Standing Committee on Health. In September 2010 he was reassigned to being the critic on health for the Liberal Party. Dosanjh introduced private member bill C-467 &quot;An Act to amend the Citizenship Act (children born abroad)&quot; in the 2nd session, and re-introduced it in the 3rd session where it received 2nd reading in September 2010, which would grant natural citizenship to children born to, or adopted by, Canadian citizens working for the federal government (including members of the Canadian Forces).

==Vaisakhi Parade controversy==
On April 16, 2010, the day prior to the annual Vaisakhi Parade held in Surrey, B.C., one of the parade organizers issued a statement indicating should Dosanjh and BC Liberal backbencher Dave Hayer choose to attend the parade, their safety could not be guaranteed. This was due in part to comments that Dosanjh had made after the parade in 2007, suggesting a police investigation into reports of a parade float that had a picture of Talwinder Singh Parmar on it, accused in the Air India bombing.

&quot;Everybody&#x27;s invited except those who&#x27;ve been excluded&quot;, Bains said of the event that would include security for some participants. &quot;Everyone (is invited) except... two people – Ujjal Dosanjh and Dave Hayer,&quot; he said. &quot;We&#x27;ve never invited them. If they come they should bring their own security.&quot;

Premier Gordon Campbell called for an apology. None was forthcoming and all three declined to attend the parade.

On April 23, 2010, the RCMP launched an investigation into threats made against Dosanjh on a Facebook site, titled “Ujjal Dosanjh is a Sikh Traitor.” Canada&#x27;s parliamentarians condemned any death threats against Dosanjh.

==Award==
In 2003, he was awarded Pravasi Bharatiya Samman by the President of India.

In 2009, he was one of the recipients of the Top 25 Canadian Immigrant Awards, presented by Canadian Immigrant Magazine.

<text>The Elaeagnaceae are a plant family, the oleaster family, of the order Rosales comprising small trees and shrubs, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, south into tropical Asia and Australia. The family has about 60 species in three genera.

They are commonly thorny, with simple leaves often coated with tiny scales or hairs. Most of the species are xerophytes (found in dry habitats); several are also halophytes, tolerating high levels of soil salinity.

The Elaeagnaceae often harbor nitrogen-fixing actinomycetes of the genus &quot;Frankia&quot; in root nodules, making them useful for soil reclamation. This characteristic, together with their production of plentiful seeds, often results in the Elaeagnaceae being regarded as weeds.

The stems and leaves are covered with silvery brown or golden hairs which are either peltate or scaly. &quot;Shepherdia&quot; and &quot;Hippophae&quot; are unisexual, the female and male borne on different plants (dioecious). There are no petals, the perianth comprising a single whorl of two to eight fused sepals. In the male flower the receptacle is often flat, while in the bisexual and female flowers it is tubular, there are four to eight stamens with free filaments and bilocular anthers. The ovary is superior with one carpel containing a single erect anatropous ovule. The style is long and bears a single stigma. The fruit is an achene or a drupe like structure enclosed by the thickened lower part of the persistent calyx. It contains a single seed with little or no endosperm and a straight embryo with thick fleshy cotyledons. A number of species are grown as ornamental shrubs, notably &quot;Elaeagnus angustifolia&quot; (oleaster), &quot;Elaeagnus pungens&quot;, &quot;Elaeagnus umbellata&quot; and &quot;Elaeagnus macrophylla&quot;, which are mainly grown as deciduous or evergreen shrubs for their attractive foliage and &quot;Hippophae rhamnoides&quot; (sea buckthorn) for its bright orange berries in autumn and winter. The fruits of a number of species are edible, for example those of &quot;Shepherdia argentea&quot; (silver buffalo berry). Its fruits are used as jelly and are also eaten dried with sugar in various parts of the United States of America and Canada. The berries of &quot;Shepherdia canadensis&quot; (russet buffalo berry) when dried or smoked are used as food by Inuit, Yupik and Aleut peoples. The berries of &quot;Hippophae rhamnoides&quot; are made into a sauce in France and into jelly elsewhere. The wood of this species is fine-grained and is used for turnery. The fruit of the Japanese shrub &quot;Elaeagnus multiflora&quot; (cherry elaeagnus) are used as preserves and are used in alcoholic beverage.

==Phylogeny==

Modern molecular phylogenetics suggest the following relationships:

==Fossil history==
Fossil pollen of &quot;Elaeagnacites&quot; is described from the late Cretaceous (Santonian) of China and pollen similar to that of Elaeagnaceae is widespread in the Paleocene. There are pollen evidence of &quot;Elaeagnus&quot; from the upper Eocene Florissant Formation, Colorado, McGinitie&#x27;s Wardell Ranch Flora locality in Colorado of middle to late middle Eocene and similar samples from the Washakie Basin Laney Shale Member of early Eocene. A fossil †&quot;Elaeagnus orchidioides&quot; flower is recorded from the late Pliocene of Willershausen (Kalefeld), Hesse, Germany. There are two fossil wood records with extensive documentation of anatomical features: †&quot;Elaeagnus semiannulipora&quot; from the early Miocene of Yamagata, Japan and †&quot;EIeagnaceoxylon shepherdioides&quot;, considered similar to &quot;Shepherdia&quot;, from the Pliocene Beaufort Formation, northwestern Banks Island, Canada. Four fossil leaves have been described with diagnostic features of &quot;Elaeagnus&quot; from the late Miocene of eastern Tibet, modern altitude of 3910 m The silverberry genus &quot;Elaeagnus&quot; (Elaeagnaceae) reaches its greatest diversity (54 species) and endemism (36 species) in this area. The diversification of &quot;Elaeagnus&quot; in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and adjacent areas might have been driven by continuous uplift at least since the late Miocene, causing formation of complex topography and climate with high rainfall seasonality.

<doc id="194292" wikidata="Q360371" url="?curid=194292" title="Antony Gormley">
<text>Sir Antony Mark David Gormley (born 30 August 1950) is a British sculptor. His works include the &quot;Angel of the North&quot;, a public sculpture in Gateshead in the north of England, commissioned in 1994 and erected in February 1998; &quot;Another Place&quot; on Crosby Beach near Liverpool; and &quot;Event Horizon&quot;, a multipart site installation which premiered in London in 2007, then subsequently in Madison Square in New York City (2010), São Paulo, Brazil (2012), and Hong Kong (2015–16).

==Early life==
Gormley was born in Hampstead, London, the youngest of seven children, to a German mother (maiden name Brauninger) and a father of Irish descent. His paternal grandfather was an Irish Catholic from Derry who settled in Walsall in Staffordshire. The ancestral homeland of the Gormley Clan (Irish: &quot;Ó Goirmleadhaigh&quot;) in Ulster was east County Donegal and west County Tyrone, with most people in both Derry and Strabane being of County Donegal origin. Gormley has stated that his parents chose his initials, &quot;AMDG&quot;, to have the inference Ad maiorem Dei gloriam – &quot;to the greater glory of God&quot;.

Gormley grew up in a Roman Catholic family living in Hampstead Garden Suburb. The family was wealthy, with a cook and a chauffeur, with a home overlooking the golf course; Gormley&#x27;s father was an art lover. He attended Ampleforth College, a Benedictine boarding school in Yorkshire, before reading archaeology, anthropology, and the history of art at Trinity College, Cambridge, from 1968 to 1971. He travelled to India and the Dominion of Ceylon / Sri Lanka to learn more about Buddhism between 1971 and 1974. When Gormley returned to England, and inspired by his time in India, he made one of his first artworks, &quot;Sleeping Place&quot;, by laying a plaster-soaked sheet over a friend. Its hollow plaster shell hinted at the form of a body and recalled the people Gormley saw asleep in India wrapped in saris or dhotis. 

After attending Saint Martin&#x27;s School of Art and Goldsmiths in London from 1974, he completed his studies with a postgraduate course in sculpture at the Slade School of Fine Art, between 1977 and 1979. Gormley&#x27;s work as a student used natural materials such as stone and wood.

==Career==

Gormley&#x27;s career began with a solo exhibition at the Whitechapel Gallery in 1981. In this exhibition, Gormley showed a series of works that were concerned with surfaces, skins and inner structures, such as &quot;Natural Selection&quot;, a ten metre row of objects, including tools, fruits, weapons and vegetables, encased in lead, and &quot;Room&quot;, an enclosure reminiscent of a barbed-wire fence made from a set of the artist&#x27;s clothes. 

Gormley then turned his attention to the human body, creating moulds of his own body in plaster that he would then encase in lead. These works, such as the three-part sculptures &quot;Three Ways: Mould Hole and Passage&quot; and &quot;Land Sea and Air II&quot;, as well as the single body-case works &quot;Plateau&quot;, &quot;Night&quot; and &quot;Peer&quot;, attempt to investigate the body as a space. In Gormley&#x27;s words, &quot;How to make bodies into vessels that both contain and occupy space? The early three-piece lead works are the first works in which I used my own body. I was trying to map out the phenomenology of the body and to find a new way of evoking it as being less a thing, more a place; a site of transformation, and an axis of physical and spatial experience.&quot; Throughout the 1980s, Gormley&#x27;s lead body-cases were extended, suspended, sealed, pierced and also doubled into two joined forms. 

Gormley describes his work as &quot;an attempt to materialise the place at the other side of appearance where we all live.&quot; His work attempts to treat the body not as an object, but as a place and in making works that enclose the space of a particular body to identify a condition common to all human beings. The work is not symbolic but indexical – a trace of a real event of a real body in time. 

In the 1990s, the hollow body-cases became solid, with Gormley casting the work in iron to create masses that displace space. One of these works, &quot;Critical Mass II&quot;, was installed in an old tram storage station in Vienna. Comprising 60 life-size sculptures, all presented in a variety of positions and poses, the work has been described by Gormley as &quot;an anti-monument to the victims of the 20th century&quot;. This work has since been exhibited in a variety of countries and contexts, each time reconfigured in response to its environment. Notable presentations include the Royal Academy of Arts in London, Art Changsha in China and Forte di Belvedere in Florence. 

The 2006 Sydney Biennale featured Gormley&#x27;s &quot;Asian Field&quot;, an installation of approximately 200,000 small clay figurines crafted by around 300 Chinese villagers in five days from 100 tons of red clay. Use of others&#x27; works attracted minor comment. Some figurines were stolen. Also in 2006, the burning of Gormley&#x27;s 25-m high &quot;The Waste Man&quot; formed the zenith of the Margate Exodus. Other collaborative projects include &quot;Clay and the Collective Body&quot;, &quot;Inside Australia&quot;, &quot;Domain Field&quot; and Gormley&#x27;s ongoing &quot;Field&quot; works, including &quot;Asian Field&quot;, &quot;Amazonian Field&quot;, &quot;American Field&quot;, &quot;Field for the Art Gallery of New South Wales&quot; and &quot;Field for the British Isles&quot;.

In 2007, Gormley&#x27;s &quot;Event Horizon&quot;, consisting of 31 life-sized and anatomically correct casts of his body, four in cast iron and 27 in fiberglass, was installed on top of prominent buildings along London&#x27;s South Bank, and installed in locations around New York City&#x27;s Madison Square in 2010. Critic Howard Halle said that &quot;Using distance and attendant shifts of scale within the very fabric of the city, [&quot;Event Horizon&quot;] creates a metaphor for urban life and all the contradictory associations – alienation, ambition, anonymity, fame – it entails.&quot;

In July 2009, Gormley presented &quot;One &amp; Other&quot;, a Fourth Plinth commission, an invitation for members of the public, chosen by lot, to spend one hour on the vacant plinth in Trafalgar Square in London. This &quot;living art&quot; happening initially attracted much media attention. It even became a topic of discussion on the long-running BBC radio drama series &quot;The Archers&quot;, where Gormley made an appearance as himself.

Throughout the 2000s, Gormley has interrogated the relationship between the human body and architecture, notably in his series of steel and iron &quot;Blockworks&quot;. In these works, Gormley replaces anatomy with architectural blocks that recall the built environment.

In March 2014, Gormley appeared in the BBC Four series &quot;What Do Artists Do All Day?&quot; in an episode that followed his team and him in their Kings Cross studio, preparing a new work – a group of 60 enormous steel figures – called &quot;Expansion Field&quot;. The work was shown at the Zentrum Paul Klee in Bern.

In May 2015 five life-sized sculptures, &quot;Land&quot;, were placed near the centre and at four compass points of the UK in a commission by the Landmark Trust to celebrate its 50th anniversary. They are at Lowsonford (Warwickshire), Lundy (Bristol Channel), Saddell Bay (Scotland), the Martello Tower (Aldeburgh, Suffolk), and Clavell Tower (Kimmeridge Bay, Dorset). The Dorset sculpture was knocked over into Kimmeridge Bay by a storm in September 2015.

On 6 September 2015, &quot;Another Place&quot; marked the 10th anniversary of its installation at Crosby Beach in Merseyside. Gormley commented:

In September 2015, Gormley had his first sculpture installed in New Zealand. &quot;Stay&quot; is a group of identical cast-iron human form sculptures, with the first installed in the Avon River / Ōtākaro in Christchurch&#x27;s central city, and the other sculpture installed in the nearby Arts Centre in early 2016.

In 2015, at the Forte di Belvedere in Florence, Gormley presented a group of cast iron works that acted as points of ″acupuncture″ throughout the historical fortress. Gormley returned to Florence in 2018 with the exhibition &quot;Essere&quot; at the Uffizi Gallery. The exhibition featured both historical and recent work, notably &quot;Room&quot; from 1980, &quot;Sense&quot; from 1991 and &quot;Passage&quot; from 2016. 

In 2017, Gormley curated &quot;Inside&quot;, an exhibition at the Southbank Centre, London, presented by Koestler Trust showing artworks by prisoners, detainees, and ex-offenders. In addition, he judged their annual category prize, also on the theme &quot;inside&quot;.

Gormley then held the first solo exhibition at the newly remodelled Kettle&#x27;s Yard in Cambridge, England. Two new bodies of work, known as &quot;Rooters&quot; and &quot;Polyhedra Works&quot;, were shown that year at White Cube in Hong Kong and Thaddaeus Ropac in Salzburg, respectively. 

On 21 April 2018, Gormley released a limited edition vinyl album of ambient sounds from his studio for Record Store Day titled &quot;Sounds of the Studio&quot;. It consisted of two tracks (one on each side) titled &quot;Sounds of the Studio (Part 1)&quot; and &quot;Sounds of the Studio (Part 2)&quot;. It came with an inner with a monochrome print of his studio on one side and text by the artist with a photo on the other.

In 2019, Gormley populated the island of Delos with iron &quot;bodyforms&quot; with the exhibition &quot;Sight&quot;. Organised and commissioned by the NEON Organization and presented in collaboration with the Ephorate of Antiquities of Cyclades, this project marked the first time that an artist took over the archaeological site of Delos since the island was inhabited over 5,000 years ago, and is the first time a contemporary art installation has been unanimously approved by the Greek Archaeological Council of the Ministry of Culture to take place in Delos, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. He installed 29 sculptures made during the last 20 years, including five new works specially commissioned by the NEON Organization, both at the periphery and integrated amongst Delos&#x27;s archaeological site and museum animating the geological and archaeological features of the island.

Also in 2019, the Royal Academy held an exhibition filling its 13 main galleries with Gormley&#x27;s works, including some new (designed to fit the space), some remade for the gallery, and some of his early sculptures, with two rooms of his drawings and sketchbooks.

In 2020, Gormley was confirmed to be &quot;lending&quot; a sculpture to Kirklees College to sit atop its new building at Pioneer House in Dewsbury, as part of a major redevelopment in the town.

In 2022, a Gormley sculpture called &quot;Alert&quot; was installed on the main campus of Imperial College London. The installation raised objections from the student body due to its perceived &quot;phallic&quot; interpretation.

That year, Gormley also held exhibitions at the Lehmbruck Museum in Duisburg, Germany and Museum Voorlinden in Wassenaar, the Netherlands. In Duisburg, his work was placed in dialogue with Wilhelm Lehmbruck&#x27;s expressionistic, elongated sculptures. Gormley&#x27;s &quot;Reflection II&quot; has remained on display at the museum. 

In 2023, Gormley opened a number of large-scale exhibitions, including &quot;Living Time&quot; at TAG Art Museum in Qingdao, China, and &quot;Critical Mass&quot; at Musée Rodin in Paris, France, which marked the first time that a living artist has been invited to exhibit in all areas of the museum, including the Hôtel Biron. As part of the exhibition, Gormley showed his major artwork &quot;Critical Mass II&quot;, a sculpture comprising 60 cast iron bodies, in and around the museum and its grounds. Inside the Hôtel Biron, Gormley placed four sculptures in dialogue with Rodin&#x27;s own work and also selected a number of his working models to be seen alongside Rodin&#x27;s plaster maquettes. Later in the year, Gormley opened &quot;Body Politic&quot; at White Cube in London, a solo exhibition of new sculptures responding to themes of movement and containment, as well as the topic of migration. As part of the exhibition, a new installation, &quot;Resting Place&quot;, filled a room with 244 bodies built from fired bricks, and a row of what the artist calls concrete &quot;bunkers&quot; ran down the gallery&#x27;s central corridor. 

In 2024, &quot;Time Horizon&quot;, an installation of 100 cast iron sculptures, opened at Houghton Hall in Norfolk. The installation responded to the specific landscape of the parkland and the history of the Hall. Gormley also unveiled &quot;True, for Alan Turing&quot; at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. This sculpture, made from slabs of Corten steel, celebrates the life and enduring influence of mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing. Speaking on the sculpture, Gormley stated &quot;Alan Turing unlocked the door between the industrial and the information ages. I wanted to make the best sculpture I could to honour a man who was pivotal in changing the course of all our lives. It is not about the memorialisation of a death, but about a celebration of the opportunities that a life allowed&quot;.

Gormley&#x27;s first solo exhibition in New York, USA, in over eight years opened at White Cube and ran until June 2024. The artist exhibited a new site-specific installation titled &quot;Aerial&quot;, from which the exhibition took its name. This sculpture was made from horizontal and vertical aluminium bars that filled the room like &quot;whiskers&quot; and visitors were invited to enter and find their way through this space. 

==Recognition==
Gormley won the Turner Prize in 1994 with &quot;Field for the British Isles&quot;. 

Gormley has been a Royal Academician since 2003, and was a trustee of the British Museum from 2007 to 2015. He is an honorary fellow of the Royal Society of Arts and the Royal Institute of British Architects, honorary doctor of the universities of Teesside, Liverpool, University College London, and Cambridge, and a fellow of Trinity and Jesus Colleges, Cambridge. In October 2010, along with 100 other leading artists, he signed an open letter to Culture Minister Jeremy Hunt protesting cutbacks in the arts.

On 13 March 2011, Gormley was awarded the Laurence Olivier Award for Outstanding Achievement in Dance for the set design for &quot;Babel (Words)&quot; at Sadler&#x27;s Wells in collaboration with Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui and Damien Jalet. He was the recipient of the Obayashi Prize in 2012 and is the 2013 Praemium Imperiale laureate for sculpture. Gormley was knighted in the 2014 New Year Honours for services to the arts, having previously been appointed OBE in 1998.

For &quot;Room&quot;, he received the 2015 Marsh Award for Excellence in Public Sculpture.

In 2008, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; ranked Gormley number four in their list of the &quot;100 most powerful people in British culture&quot;.

==Personal life ==
While at the Slade School of Fine Art, Gormley met Vicken Parsons, who was to become his assistant, and in 1980, his wife, as well as a successful artist in her own right. The couple have a daughter and two sons.

Gormley is a patron of Paintings in Hospitals, a charity that provides art for health and social care in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland.

In June 2022 Gormley said that he had applied for German citizenship, to which he is entitled through his German mother, after describing Brexit as &quot;a practical disaster&quot; and a &quot;betrayal&quot;.

<text>Solomon (Shloyme) Mikhoels ( [also spelled שלוימע מיכאעלס during the Soviet era], , – 13 January 1948) was a Soviet actor and the artistic director of the Moscow State Jewish Theater. Mikhoels served as the chairman of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee during World War II. However, as Joseph Stalin pursued an increasingly anti-Jewish line after the War, Mikhoels&#x27;s position as a leader of the Jewish community led to increasing persecution from the Soviet state. He was assassinated in Minsk in 1948 by order of Stalin.

==Early life==
Born Shloyme Vovsi to a family of Jewish heritage in Dvinsk, Russian Empire (now Daugavpils, Latvia), Mikhoels studied law in Saint Petersburg, but left school in 1918 to join Alexis Granowsky&#x27;s Jewish Theater Workshop, which was attempting to create a national Jewish theater in Russia in Yiddish. The workshop moved to Moscow in 1920, where it established the Moscow State Jewish Theater. That was in keeping with Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s policy on nationalities, which encouraged them to pursue and to develop their own cultures under the aegis of the Soviet state.

==Theatrical career==
Mikhoels was the company&#x27;s leading actor and, as of 1928, its director. His memorable roles included Tevye in an adaptation of Sholom Aleichem&#x27;s novel &quot;Tevye the Milkman&quot; (which was adapted for an American audience as &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;) and the title role in a Yiddish translation of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot;, in 1935. As a director he commissioned a new &quot;Bar Kochba&quot;, written by Shmuel Halkin, which the company successfully staged as a socialist turn on the traditional story.

These plays were ostensibly supportive of the Soviet state; however, the historian Jeffrey Veidlinger has argued that closer readings suggest that they actually contained veiled critiques of Joseph Stalin&#x27;s regime and assertions of Jewish national identity. Ukrainian director Les Kurbas seems to have had a lasting influence on Mikhoel&#x27;s directing style.

==Antifascist activities==
By the mid-1930s, Mikhoels&#x27;s career was threatened because of his association with other leading intelligentsia members who were victims of Stalin&#x27;s Great Purge.

On August 24, 1941, Mikhoels led a gathering of thousands in central Moscow&#x27;s Gorky Park. It was explicitly a Jewish rally and aimed to raise funds for the Soviet war effort from the international Jewish community. Speakers included the writer David Bergelson.

Mikhoels actively supported Stalin against Adolf Hitler and, in 1942, was made the chairman of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee. In that capacity, he travelled around the world and met with Jewish communities to encourage them to support the Soviet Union in its war against Nazi Germany.

That was useful to Stalin during World War II, but after the war, Stalin opposed contacts between Soviet Jews and Jewish communities in noncommunist countries, particularly Mikhoels&#x27; aims of establishing Jewish autonomy in Crimea, which he regarded as a plot by American capitalists. The Jewish State Theater was closed, and the members of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee were arrested. All but two were eventually executed in the purges shortly before Stalin&#x27;s death.

==Death==
On the morning of 13 January 1948, workmen discovered Mikhoels&#x27;s dead body lying in snow in a quiet street in Minsk. The theatre critic was lying dead beside him. It was announced that they had been killed in a traffic accident. Mikhoels&#x27;s body lay in state for a day in the Jewish National Theatre. He was praised in a &quot;Pravda&quot; obituary and accorded a state funeral, with prominent members of the party and government officials among the mourners. His daughter, Natalya, and her composer husband Moisei Weinberg hosted a stream of mourners at their flat, including the composer Dmitri Shostakovich. He was buried at the New Donskoy Cemetery, in Moscow.

Even at the time, many people suspected that his death was not an accident, including the Yiddish poet Peretz Markish, who hinted in a poem that Mikhoels&#x27;s name should be added to the six million victims of The Holocaust.
Stalin&#x27;s daughter, Svetlana Alliluyeva, later wrote that:
Two weeks after Mikhoels&#x27; death, his alleged assassin, Lavrentiy Tsanava, was secretly given the Order of Lenin &quot;for exemplary execution of a special assignment from the government&quot;.

After Stalin&#x27;s death in March 1953, Lavrentiy Beria regained control of the Ministry for State Security (MGB), which he had temporarily lost, and on 2 April, he informed the party praesidium that Mikhoels and Golubov had been murdered. The men he accused of the murders, Tsanava, Minister of State Security for the Belorussian republic, and Soviet Deputy Minister State Security, Sergei Ogoltsov, were arrested. When Beria was himself arrested, in June, Ogoltsov&#x27;s wife and Tsanava pleaded for the case to be overturned. Ogoltsov was released, though Tsanava died in prison.

According the former MGB officer Pavel Sudoplatov, who was assigned in 1953 to investigate the murder, Mikhoels was lured to Tsanava&#x27;s country dacha, ostensibly to meet some of Byelorussia&#x27;s leading dramatic artists, and was stabbed with a poison needle by an MGB officer named Lebedev, with Tsanava and Ogoltsov supervising the operation. Golubov was an MGB informer, who was also killed by the chekists because he was an &quot;inconvenient witness&quot;.

==Family==

Mikhoels was married to Anastasia Pototskaya, a Russian of Polish descent. He had two daughters from his first marriage to Sara Kantor, Nina and Natalya Vovsi.

Mikhoels&#x27; cousin Miron Vovsi was a famous physician. He was arrested during the Doctors&#x27; plot affair but released after Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953, as was Mikhoels&#x27; son-in-law, the Polish-born composer Mieczysław Weinberg. In 1983, Mikhoels&#x27; daughter, Natalia Vovsi-Mikoels, wrote a biography of her father: &quot;My Father Shlomo Mikhoels: The Life and Death of a Jewish Actor&quot;.

<text>George Bryan &quot;Beau&quot; Brummell (7 June 1778 – 30 March 1840) was an important figure in Regency England, and for many years he was the arbiter of British men&#x27;s fashion. At one time, he was a close friend of the Prince Regent, the future King George IV, but after the two quarrelled and Brummell got into debt, he had to take refuge in France. Eventually, he died from complications of neurosyphilis in Caen.

Brummell was remembered afterwards as the preeminent example of the dandy, and a whole literature was founded upon his manner and witty sayings, which have persisted until today. His name is still associated with style and good looks and has been given to a variety of modern products to suggest their high quality.

==Life==
Brummell was born in Downing Street, London, the younger son of William Brummell ( 1795), Private Secretary to the Prime Minister, Lord North, and Mary (née Richardson, daughter of the Keeper of the Lottery Office). North rated William Brummell highly, procuring for him appointments including those he held at the time of his death, namely Receiver of the Duties on Uninhabited Houses in London and Middlesex, Comptroller of the Hawkers&#x27; and Pedlars&#x27; Office, and Agent and Paymaster to the out-pensioners of Chelsea Hospital; these gave William about £2,500 per annum. On his retirement from politics, William had bought Donnington Grove in Berkshire and served as High Sheriff of Berkshire in 1788. William was the son of another William Brummell ( 1770), who had been valet to a Lincolnshire politician, Charles Monson, and, reckoned &quot;an excellent servant&quot;, met with some success despite his modest origins through patronage and good fortune; he went into business as a confectioner in Bury Street, &quot;in an area notorious for[...] high-class brothels&quot;, letting some rooms in the family&#x27;s house for boarding. The statesman Charles Jenkinson, 1st Earl of Liverpool, stayed there for a time and got the younger William a clerical position at the Treasury, which led to his successful career.

The family had achieved middle class status, but William Brummell was ambitious for his son George to become a gentleman, and he was raised with that understanding. It was suggested (possibly by the Brummells) that William Brummell was an illegitimate descendant of Frederick, Prince of Wales.

Brummell was educated at Eton College and made his precocious mark on fashion when he not only modernised the white stock, or cravat, that was the mark of the &quot;Eton boy&quot;, but added a gold buckle to it.

He progressed to Oxford University, where, by his own example, he made cotton stockings and dingy cravats fall out of favour. While an undergraduate at Oriel College in 1793, he competed for the Chancellor&#x27;s Prize for Latin Verse, coming second to Edward Copleston, who later became provost of his college. He left the university after only a year at age 16.

===Military career===
In June 1794, Brummell joined the 10th Light Dragoons, later the Tenth Royal Hussars as a cornet, the lowest rank of commissioned officer, and soon after had his nose broken by a kick from a horse. His father died in 1795, by which time Brummell had been promoted to lieutenant. His father had left him an inheritance of some £30,000. Ordinarily a considerable sum, it was inadequate for the expenses of an aspiring officer in the personal regiment of the Prince of Wales. The officers, many of whom were heirs to noble titles and lands, &quot;wore their estates upon their backs – some of them before they had inherited the paternal acres.&quot; Officers in any military regiment were required to provide their own mounts and uniforms and to pay mess bills, but the 10th in particular had elaborate and nearly endless variations of uniform. Their mess expenses were unusually high because the regiment frequently enjoyed banquets and entertainment.

For such a junior officer, Brummell took the regiment by storm, fascinating the Prince:

In 1797, when his regiment was sent from London to Manchester, he immediately resigned his commission, citing the city&#x27;s poor reputation, undistinguished ambience and want of culture and civility.

===In London society===

Although he was now a civilian, Brummell&#x27;s friendship with (and influence over) the Prince continued. He became a noted figure in fashion and adopted a habit of dress that rejected overly ornate clothes in favour of understated but perfectly fitted and tailored bespoke garments; this was the moment of the so-called Great Male Renunciation seen across Europe. His daily dress was similar to that of other gentlemen in his time, based upon dark coats and full-length trousers (rather than knee breeches and stockings). Above all, Brummell favoured immaculate shirt linen and an elaborately knotted cravat. This mode of cravat-wearing has been described as Brummell&#x27;s chief innovation.

Brummell took a house on Chesterfield Street in Mayfair and, for a time, managed to avoid the nightly gaming and other extravagances frequent in such elevated circles. Where he refused to economise was on his dress: when asked how much it would cost to keep a single man in clothes, he was said to have replied: &quot;Why, with tolerable economy, I think it might be done with £800&quot;, at a time when the average annual wage for a craftsman was £52. Additionally, he claimed that he took five hours a day to dress and recommended that boots be polished with champagne. This preoccupation with dress, coupled with a nonchalant display of wit, was referred to as dandyism.

Brummell put into practice the principles of harmony of shape and contrast of colours with such a pleasing result that men of superior rank sought his opinion on their own dress:

His personal habits, such as a fastidious attention to cleaning his teeth, shaving, and daily bathing exerted an influence on the &quot;ton&quot;—the upper echelons of polite society—who began to do likewise. Enthralled, the Prince would spend hours in Brummell&#x27;s dressing room, witnessing the progress of his friend&#x27;s lengthy morning toilette.

In June 1811 he was one of the guests at the Carlton House Fête held to celebrate the beginning of the Regency era.

===Cricket===
While studying at Eton, Brummell played for the school&#x27;s first eleven, although he is said to have once terrified a master there by asserting that he thought cricket was &quot;foolish&quot;. He did, however, play a single first-class match for Hampshire at Lord&#x27;s Old Ground in 1807 against an early all-England cricket team. Brummell made scores of 23 and 3 on that occasion, leaving him with a career batting average of 13.00.

===Downfall===
Brummell&#x27;s wealthier friends influenced him; he began spending and gambling as though his fortune was as ample as theirs. He found it increasingly difficult to maintain his lifestyle as his spending continued over time, but his prominent position in society allowed him to float a line of credit. This situation changed in July 1813 at a masquerade ball jointly hosted at Watier&#x27;s private club by Brummell, Lord Alvanley, Henry Mildmay and Henry Pierrepont. The four were considered the prime movers of Watier&#x27;s, dubbed &quot;the Dandy Club&quot; by Lord Byron. The Prince Regent greeted Alvanley and Pierrepont at the event, and then &quot;cut&quot; Brummell and Mildmay by staring at their faces without speaking. This provoked Brummell&#x27;s remark, &quot;Alvanley, who&#x27;s your fat friend?&quot;.

This incident marked the final breach in a rift between Brummell and the Regent that had opened in 1811, when the Prince became Regent and began abandoning all his old Whig friends. Brummell became an anomalous favourite, flourishing without a patron, influencing fashion and courted by a large segment of society.

===Later life===
In 1816, Brummell, owing thousands of pounds, fled to France to escape debtor&#x27;s prison. Some sources liberally estimate he owed up to £600,000 at the time. Usually, Brummell&#x27;s gambling obligations, being &quot;debts of honour&quot;, were paid immediately. The one exception to that was his final wager, dated March 1815 in White&#x27;s betting book, which was marked &quot;not paid, 20th January, 1816&quot;. Seemingly unable to quell his urge to spend and gamble, it became apparent his lifestyle could no longer be sustained. Brummell was ostracized from his social circle and soon found refuge in France.

He lived the remainder of his life in French exile, spending ten years in Calais without an official passport, before acquiring an appointment to the consulate at Caen in 1830 through the influence of Lord Alvanley and the Duke of Beaufort. This provided him with a small annuity to fuel his new life in France; however, this lasted only two years because the Foreign Office acted on Brummell&#x27;s recommendation to abolish the consulate. He had made it in the hope of being appointed to a more remunerative position elsewhere to regain some influence, but no new position was forthcoming, much to his detriment.

Rapidly running out of money and growing increasingly slovenly in his dress, he was forced by his long-unpaid Calais creditors into debtors&#x27; prison in 1835. Only through the charitable intervention of his friends in England was he able to secure his release later that year. In 1840, Brummell died at the age of 61, penniless and demented from syphilis, at Le Bon Sauveur Asylum on the outskirts of Caen. He is buried at Cimetière Protestant, Caen, France.

==In the arts==

===Artistic memorials===

A very early portrait of Brummell, along with his elder brother William, occurs in the Joshua Reynolds painting of the curly-headed Brummell children, dating from 1781 and now in the Kenwood House collection. The caricaturist Richard Dighton painted a watercolour of Brummell at the elegant height of his dandyism and used it as the basis for a popular print in 1805. Two centuries later, it served as model for a 2002 statue of Brummell by Irena Sedlecká, erected in Jermyn Street. A plaque on the front of this statue is inscribed with his own words: &quot;to be truly elegant, one should not be noticed.&quot; On the other side of Piccadilly, a blue plaque has marked Brummell&#x27;s former home in Chesterfield Street since 1984, while in 2013, another plaque commemorated his name as a member of the hunting and dining club in Melton Mowbray.

===Brummelliana===
In literature, Brummell has been more extensively portrayed. Scarcely had he left England than he was satirised as the witty Bellair in the picaresque novel &quot;Six Weeks at Long&#x27;s, by a Late Resident&quot; (1817), now ascribed to Eaton Stannard Barrett. Among his humorous remarks there, he is credited with denouncing the eating of vegetables and, when challenged whether he had ever tried it, replying, &quot;Oh, yes, I remember I once ate a pea.&quot; A collection of the witticisms ascribed to him and of anecdotes about him followed under the title &quot;Brummelliana&quot; was republished many times in the following decades. This began with the story of him enquiring the identity of his companion&#x27;s &quot;fat friend&quot;, and also included his &quot;I once ate a pea&quot; remark. William Hazlitt borrowed the same title, &quot;Brummelliana&quot;, for an unsympathetic essay published in 1828, referring to some of these stories and repeating others uncollected there. Dandyism also came under attack in George Robert Wythen Baxter&#x27;s satirical essay &quot;Kiddyism&quot;, published in humorous journals from 1832 onwards, which culminates in a set of satirical aphorisms purporting to be yet more Brummelliana. Further fictitious aphorisms were published in France by Honoré de Balzac in the course of a series of articles published under the title (1830). These sayings were supposed to have arisen during an interview with Brummell in Boulogne, rather than Calais, and epitomise his view of &quot;the elegant life&quot;.

===Literary portrayals===
Brummell appears at length in &quot;The Memoirs of Harriette Wilson, Written by Herself,&quot; (1825) as a former suitor of Harriette Wilson&#x27;s friend Julia. &quot;In short,&quot; she wrote, &quot;his maxims on dress were excellent. Besides this, he was neither uneducated nor deficient. He possessed also a sort of quaint, dry humour, not amounting to anything like wit; indeed, he said nothing which would bear repetition; but his affected manners and little absurdities amused for the moment. Then it became the fashion to court Brummell&#x27;s society, which was enough to make many seek it who cared not for it; and many more wished to be well with him through fear, for all knew him to be cold, heartless, and satirical.&quot;

Two more books were later dedicated to confirming Brummell as a cult figure. In England, there was Captain Jesse&#x27;s two volume &quot;Life of George Brummell&quot; (1844), the first biography devoted to him. In France, there was the influential essay of Jules Amédée Barbey d&#x27;Aurevilly, &quot;On Dandyism and George Brummell&quot; (1845), which seeks to define the essence of dandyism through a study of his career and opinions. In the course of his essay, Barbey d&#x27;Aurevilly deprecates English attempts to portray Brummell in fiction: &quot;Within Brummell&#x27;s lifetime two well-known authors took up their pensharpened to exquisite points and dipped in musk-scented Chinese inkto cast on blue-tinted paper with silver borders a few facile lines where one catches a glimpse of Brummell.&quot; He was referring to two examples of the fashionable or silver fork novel, of which more than a thousand were to be written over the next two decades.

Brummell&#x27;s character also served as foundation for depiction of fictional dandies. One such is the character Trebeck in Thomas Henry Lister&#x27;s &quot;Granby&quot; (1826), who abandons dandyism when he discovers a waistcoat of his devising worn by &quot;a natty apprentice&quot;. In Bulwer Lytton&#x27;s 1828 novel &quot;Pelham&quot;, the hero of the title passes through Calais and meets the inspiration of his dandiacal way of life in the character of Mr. Russelton. The latter is modeled on Brummell, and to him are attributed such stories from the Brummell apocrypha as his once needing three tailors to make his gloves and the sartorial insult, &quot;Do you call this a coat?&quot;

Brummell appeared under his own name as a character in Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s 1896 historical novel &quot;Rodney Stone&quot;. In this, the title character&#x27;s uncle, Charles Tregellis, is the center of the London fashion world, until Brummell ultimately supplants him. Tregellis&#x27;s subsequent death from mortification serves as a &quot;deus ex machina,&quot; in that it resolves Rodney Stone&#x27;s family poverty.

Georgette Heyer, author of a number of Regency romance novels, included Brummell as a character in her 1935 novel &quot;Regency Buck&quot;. He is also referred to, or figures as a minor character, in the work of later writers of this genre. More recently, Brummell was made the detective-hero of a series of period mysteries by Californian novelist Rosemary Stevens, starting with &quot;Death on a Silver Tray&quot; in 2000. These are written as if related by their hero. Yet another American reinterpretation of his character appears in Cecilia Ryan&#x27;s homoerotic novella &quot;The Sartorialist&quot; (2012).

===Stage and cinema===
In the United States, Brummell&#x27;s life was dramatised in an 1890 stage play in four acts by Clyde Fitch with Richard Mansfield as Brummell. This in turn was adapted for the 1924 film &quot;Beau Brummel&quot;, with John Barrymore and Mary Astor. Another play about him, authored by Bertram P Matthews, is only remembered because it had incidental music written for it by Edward Elgar. When it was staged at the Theatre Royal, Birmingham in November 1928, Elgar himself conducted the orchestra on its first night. With the exception of the minuet, Elgar&#x27;s orchestral score subsequently disappeared and the manuscript has never been located. Brummell&#x27;s later years were the setting for Ron Hutchinson&#x27;s 2001 two-character play &quot;The Beau&quot; (originally &quot;Beau Brummell&quot;), which, following a UK national tour, played for one month at Theatre Royal Haymarket, starring Peter Bowles as Brummell.

Earlier movies included a 10-minute film by the Vitagraph Company of America (1913), based on a Booth Tarkington story, and &quot;Beau Brummell and his Bride&quot;, a short comedy made by the Edison Company in the same year. In 1937, there was a radio drama on Lux Radio Theater with Robert Montgomery as Brummell. A further film, &quot;Beau Brummell&quot;, was made in 1954 with Stewart Granger playing the title role, Peter Ustinov as the Prince of Wales, and Elizabeth Taylor as Lady Patricia Belham. There were also two television dramas: the sixty-minute German &quot;So war Herr Brummell&quot; (Süddeutscher Rundfunk, 1967) and the UK&#x27;s &quot;Beau Brummell: This Charming Man&quot; (2006).

In 1931, there was a French three-act operetta, &quot;Brummell&quot;, composed by Reynaldo Hahn to a libretto by Rip and Robert Dieudonné. This featured Brummell as the main character in a fabricated story of a rural courtship which saw occasional performance in later years. This was later broadcast by Radio-Lille (1963).

==A guarantee of style==
Brummell&#x27;s name became associated with style and good looks, and was therefore borrowed for a variety of products or alluded to in songs and poetry. One example was the paint colour Beau Brummel Brown, used exclusively on the 1931 Oldsmobile. In 1934, a rhododendron hybridised by Lionel de Rothschild was named after the dandy. In 1928, there were several Beau Brummel styles from the Illinois Watch Company and in 1948, LeCoultre marketed a Beau Brummel watch with a minimalist design and no numbers. In 2016, a men&#x27;s skincare and shaving company launched using the name Beau Brummell for Men.

T. S. Eliot&#x27;s poem about &quot;Bustopher Jones: The Cat About Town&quot; refers to him as the &quot;Brummell of Cats&quot;, an allusion taken up in Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &quot;Cats&quot;, the 1981 musical based on Eliot&#x27;s &quot;Old Possum&#x27;s Book of Practical Cats&quot; (1939). Other allusions to Brummell appear in the lyrics of such songs as &quot;All I Need Is The Girl&quot; from the 1959 musical &quot;Gypsy&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile&quot; from the musical &quot;Annie&quot; (1977), and Billy Joel&#x27;s 1980 hit &quot;It&#x27;s Still Rock and Roll to Me&quot;.

Various bands also adopted Brummell&#x27;s name, beginning with Zack Whyte and His Chocolate Beau Brummels, a jazz-style dance band that toured between 1924 and 1935. During the 1960s, there were the rock bands such as The Beau Brummels from San Francisco and Beau Brummell Esquire and His Noble Men, the name used by South African born Michael Bush for his English group.

<doc id="194311" wikidata="Q449574" url="?curid=194311" title="Maria Fitzherbert">
<text>Maria Anne Fitzherbert (&quot;née&quot; Smythe, previously Weld; 26 July 1756 – 27 March 1837) was a longtime companion of George, Prince of Wales (later King George IV of the United Kingdom). In 1785, they married secretly in a ceremony that was invalid under English civil law because his father, King George III, had not consented to it. Fitzherbert was a Catholic, and the law at the time forbade Catholics or spouses of Catholics to become monarch, so had the marriage been approved and valid, the Prince of Wales would have lost his place in the line of succession. Before marrying George, Fitzherbert had been twice widowed. Her nephew from her first marriage, Cardinal Weld, persuaded Pope Pius VII to declare the marriage sacramentally valid.

==Early life==
Fitzherbert was born at Tong Castle in Shropshire. She was the eldest child of Walter Smythe (c. 1721–1788) of Brambridge, Hampshire, younger son of Sir John Smythe, 3rd Baronet, of Acton Burnell, Shropshire. Her mother was Mary Ann Errington of Beaufront, Northumberland, maternal half-sister of Charles William Molyneux, 1st Earl of Sefton. Fitzherbert was educated in Paris at a French convent.

==Marriages==

At eighteen, Maria married Edward Weld, 16 years her senior, a rich Catholic widower and landowner of Lulworth Castle in July 1775. Weld died just three months later, after a fall from his horse; having failed to sign his new will, his estate went to his younger brother Thomas, the father of fifteen children, including the future Cardinal Weld. His widow was left effectively destitute, had little or no financial support from the Weld family, and was obliged to remarry as soon as she was able.

Three years later, in 1778, she married Thomas Fitzherbert of Swynnerton Hall, Staffordshire. He was ten years her senior. They had a son who died young. She was widowed again on 7 May 1781. He left her an annuity of £1,000 (£ in ), and a town house in Park Street, Mayfair.
== Relationship with George ==

The twice-widowed Fitzherbert soon entered London high society. In spring 1784, she was introduced to a youthful admirer: George, Prince of Wales, six years her junior. The prince became infatuated with her and pursued her endlessly until she agreed to marry him. Secretly, and – as both parties were well aware – against the law, they went through a form of marriage on 15 December 1785, in the drawing room of her house in Park Street, London. Her uncle, Henry Errington, and her brother, John Smythe, were the witnesses. The marriage ceremony was performed by one of the prince&#x27;s Chaplains in Ordinary, the Reverend Robert Burt, whose debts of £500 (£ in ) were paid by the prince to release him from Fleet Prison.

The marriage was not valid under English law because it had not received the prior approval of King George III and the Privy Council as required by the Royal Marriages Act 1772. Had approval been sought, it might not have been granted for many reasons, including, for example, Fitzherbert&#x27;s Catholic religion. Had consent been given and the marriage been legal, the Prince of Wales would have been automatically removed from the succession to the British throne under the provisions of the Bill of Rights and the Act of Settlement 1701 and replaced as heir-apparent by his brother, the Duke of York. In a similar case, his brother, Prince Augustus Frederick, contracted an invalid marriage with Lady Augusta Murray in 1793 without the King&#x27;s consent and had two children with her.
On 23 June 1794, Fitzherbert was informed by letter that her relationship with the Prince was over. George told his younger brother, the Duke of York, that he and Fitzherbert were &quot;parted, but parted amicably&quot;, conveying his intention to marry their first cousin, Duchess Caroline of Brunswick. According to King George III it was the only way out of a hole: his heir apparent&#x27;s enormous debts of £600,000 (£ in ) would be paid the day he wed. So the Prince married Caroline on 8 April 1795. However, in 1796, three days after Caroline gave birth to their daughter, Princess Charlotte of Wales, on 10 January, the Prince of Wales wrote his last will and testament, bequeathing all his &quot;worldly property ... to my Maria Fitzherbert, my wife, the wife of my heart and soul&quot;. Although by the laws of the country she &quot;could not avail herself publicly of that name, still such she is in the eyes of Heaven, was, is, and ever will be such in mine&quot;. However, this did not lead to a reunion. The Prince finally sought a reconciliation with his &quot;second self&quot; during the summer of 1798. By then, he had separated from Caroline for good. He was bored with his mistress, Frances Villiers, Countess of Jersey. In 1811, after becoming Regent, he invited Maria Fitzherbert to the Carlton House Fête. Still, his insistence on seating her at a lower table led to her refusal to attend.

During the first few years of his reign as King George IV, he turned violently against Fitzherbert and several former associates. Whenever he mentioned her name it was &quot;with feelings of disgust and horror&quot;, claiming that their union &quot;was an artificial marriage ... just to satisfy her; that it was no marriage – for there could be none without a licence or some written document.&quot; Fitzherbert had documents, and after their final break, her demands for her annuity payments were often accompanied by veiled threats to go public with her papers if she did not receive the funds. In June 1830, when the King was dying, he eagerly seized her &quot;get well soon&quot; letter and, after reading it, placed it under his pillow. Fitzherbert – who had no idea just how ill he was – was deeply hurt that he had never replied to her final letter. However, before dying, the King asked to be buried with Fitzherbert&#x27;s eye miniature around his neck, which was done.

Following the death of George IV on 26 June 1830, it was discovered that he had kept all of Fitzherbert&#x27;s letters, and steps were taken to destroy them. Fitzherbert told George IV&#x27;s brother, King William IV, about their marriage and showed him the document in her possession. He &quot;begged her to accept the title of Duchess, but she refused, asking only permission to wear widow&#x27;s weeds and to dress her servants in royal livery&quot;.

==Death==
Architect William Porden designed Steine House, on the west side of Old Steine in Brighton, for Fitzherbert. She lived there from 1804 until she died in 1837. She was buried at St John the Baptist&#x27;s Church, Brighton, a church built largely with her funds. The memorial sculpture in the nave shows her wearing three wedding rings.

==Possible children by George IV==
Some scholars have suggested that Maria Fitzherbert had one or two children by her marriage to the future king. &quot;In 1833, after the King&#x27;s death, one of [his] executors, Lord Stourton, asked her to sign a declaration he had written on the back of her marriage certificate. It read: &#x27;I Mary Fitzherbert ... testify that my Union with George P. of Wales was without issue.&#x27; According to Stourton, she, smiling, objected, on the score of delicacy.&quot; Indeed, during her early days in Brighton with the Prince of Wales, his uncle, the Duke of Gloucester, and other friends believed Mrs. Fitzherbert to be pregnant.

Members of the Wyatt family claim to be descendants of George IV by her. On Fitzherbert&#x27;s death, it is stated that her children were adopted by a Scottish family named Wyatt, whose name they assumed. Afterwards, they came south, settling in Erith, Kent. The Wyatt family, in the person of J. G. Wyatt, a former Erith man who later moved to Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, Canada, and Isabella Annie Wyatt, claimed title to a portion of the Fitzherbert estate in 1937.

One suggested child of the Prince and his longtime paramour was James Ord (born 1786), whose curious history of assisted relocations and encouragement has been chronicled. Ord eventually emigrated to the United States where he worked first near Norfolk, Virginia, as a shipbuilder, next in Charles County, Maryland, in ship construction, and then on a farm outside of Washington, D.C. He joined the Society of Jesus in 1806, but left the order in 1811. Soon thereafter, Ord joined the Navy, but he served in the infantry during the War of 1812. Ord lived in Allegheny County, Maryland, from 1815 to 1819, in Washington, D.C., from 1819 to 1837, in Sault Sainte Marie, Michigan, in the mid-1800s, and in California after 1855. James Ord died in 1873.

In addition to James Ord, the long-term relationship between Fitzherbert and George, as prince and king, appears to have led to more than a dozen claims of children conceived out of wedlock. These join the many additional catalogued cases of George&#x27;s liaisons, some of which have received further discussion &quot;vis-a-vis&quot; largely inexplicable financial care given by King George IV or his peers to the immediate purported descendant. 

Edward VII, the Prince&#x27;s great-nephew, granted permission to historian and Fitzherbert biographer William H. Wilkins to open her vault at Coutts Bank in 1906. The release of Wilkins&#x27; book later that year prompted several supposed descendants of the Prince and Fitzherbert to claim the latter&#x27;s substantial estate. A Rebecca Fitzherbert Harris of Kenvil, New Jersey, maintained that through family lore, she was the couple&#x27;s great-granddaughter via a purported son named Thomas Edward, named after Fitzherbert&#x27;s first two husbands. In a letter to Edward VII, Harris claimed that Thomas also had a brother and sister who lived for a time with their mother in Dublin. Thomas was supposedly sent to the United States in 1833 by Fitzherbert, who thought her children would be safer there following her death. Harris further stated that her family had received an income from an unknown source in the United Kingdom for many years. Harris requested access to Fitzherbert&#x27;s papers to pursue her claim of the estate. Edward VII was noted to have acknowledged Harris&#x27;s letter but stated that he would not assist her further.

The second codicil to Maria Fitzherbert&#x27;s will outlines her two principal beneficiaries and includes a personal note: &quot;This paper is addressed to my two dear children ... I have loved them both with the tenderest affection any mother could do, and I have done the utmost in my power for their interests and comfort&quot;.

Their married names were Mary Ann Stafford-Jerningham and Mary Georgina Emma Dawson-Damer. Stafford-Jerningham was nominally Fitzherbert&#x27;s &#x27;niece&#x27;, and was raised as Mary Ann Smythe. Dawson-Damer was nominally the daughter of Admiral Lord Hugh Seymour and Lady Anna Horatia Waldegrave. Seymour had been a close associate of George IV since their youth and Seymour&#x27;s son George was an executor and minor beneficiary of Fitzherbert&#x27;s will. There is no evidence that either of these women were the natural children of Maria Fitzherbert – indeed, the reference to &#x27;the affection any mother could do&#x27; (with stress on mother) could indicate she only saw herself as a mother figure to them and no more. The will does not refer to any sons, though this observation must be seen in its historical context: of the ten illegitimate children of Dorothea Jordan, Anglo-Irish actress and mistress of 20 years to the Duke of Clarence, later King William IV, care for the five boys was initially assumed by their father and his households, and custody and care for the girls given to Jordan.

Notably, any historical claim of descent is accompanied by controversy, and many preceding have been challenged. Given the death of Princess Charlotte without surviving children, should the Ord link be substantiated, the line descended through them would join a large number of claimed surviving descendants of King George IV.

== Appearance ==
Fitzherbert was described as having an aquiline nose and loose teeth. She had hazel eyes, silky blonde hair, and a flawless complexion.

<doc id="194316" wikidata="Q132440" url="?curid=194316" title="Princess Charlotte of Wales (1796–1817)">
<text>Princess Charlotte Augusta of Wales (7 January 1796 – 6 November 1817) was the only child of George, Prince of Wales (later George IV), and Caroline of Brunswick. She was expected to ascend the British throne after the deaths of her grandfather, George III, and her father, but died in childbirth at the age of 21, predeceasing them both.

Charlotte&#x27;s parents disliked each other from before their arranged marriage and soon separated. The Prince of Wales left most of Charlotte&#x27;s care to governesses and servants, only allowing her limited contact with her mother, who eventually left the country. As Charlotte grew to adulthood, her father pressured her to marry William, Hereditary Prince of Orange (later King of the Netherlands). After initially accepting him, Charlotte soon broke off the intended match. This resulted in an extended contest of wills between her and her father, who finally permitted her to marry Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld (later King of the Belgians). After a year-and-a-half of happy marriage, Charlotte died after giving birth to a stillborn son.

Charlotte&#x27;s death set off tremendous mourning among the British, who had seen her as a sign of hope and a contrast to both her unpopular father and mentally ill grandfather. She had been George III&#x27;s only legitimate grandchild and her death prompted a succession crisis, as there was a chance the throne would pass to a distant relative. The King&#x27;s ageing and unmarried sons looked for wives; it was his fourth son, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, who fathered the eventual heir, Victoria.

== Birth ==

In 1794 George, Prince of Wales, sought a suitable bride. He did not do so out of any particular desire to secure the succession, but because he was promised an increased income if he married. His choice fell on his German cousin Caroline of Brunswick, although he had never met her. They were repelled by one another when they first met, but the marriage went ahead on 8 April 1795. The couple ended up separating within weeks, though they remained under the same roof. George later stated that they had only had sexual relations three times.

Caroline gave birth to a daughter at their residence, Carlton House, London on 7 January 1796. While George was mildly unhappy that she was not a boy, King George III, who preferred female babies, was delighted at the birth of his first legitimate grandchild, and hoped that the birth would serve to reconcile George and Caroline. This did not come to pass, however. Three days after the birth, George drew up a will directing that his wife have no role in the upbringing of their child, and bequeathed all his worldly goods to his mistress, Maria Fitzherbert. Caroline was left one shilling. Many members of the royal family were unpopular but the nation celebrated the princess&#x27;s birth. On 11 February 1796, she was christened Charlotte Augusta, after her grandmothers, Queen Charlotte and Augusta, Duchess of Brunswick-Lüneburg, in the Great Drawing Room at Carlton House by John Moore, Archbishop of Canterbury. Her godparents were the King, the Queen and Augusta (for whom Charlotte, Princess Royal, stood proxy).

Despite Caroline&#x27;s demands for better treatment now that she had given birth to the second-in-line to the throne, George restricted her contact with the child, forbidding her to see their daughter except in the presence of a nurse and governess. Caroline was allowed the usual daily visit which upper class parents paid to their young offspring at this time; she was not allowed any say in the decisions made about Charlotte&#x27;s care. Sympathetic household staff disobeyed the Prince and allowed Caroline to be alone with her daughter. George was unaware of this, having little contact with Charlotte himself. Caroline was even bold enough to ride through the streets of London in a carriage with her daughter, to the applause of the crowds.

== Childhood ==

Charlotte was a healthy child, and according to her biographer Thea Holme, &quot;The impression one gets from all the early recorded stories of Charlotte is of a happy recklessness, and a warm heart.&quot; As Charlotte grew, her parents continued to battle, and to use the young girl as a pawn in their conflict, with both parents appealing to the King and Queen to take their side. In August 1797, Caroline left Carlton House, establishing herself in a rented home near Blackheath and leaving her daughter behind—at the time, English law considered the father&#x27;s rights to minor children paramount. However, the Prince took no action to further restrict Caroline&#x27;s access to her daughter. In December 1798, the Prince invited his estranged wife to spend the winter at Carlton House, which she refused to do. It was the last serious effort at reconciliation, and its failure meant there was little likelihood that George would have a legitimate son who would come between Charlotte and the British throne. Caroline visited her daughter at Carlton House, and sometimes Charlotte was driven out to Blackheath to visit her mother, but was never allowed to stay overnight in her mother&#x27;s house. During the summers, the Prince leased Shrewsbury Lodge at Blackheath for his daughter, which made visiting easier, and according to Alison Plowden, who wrote of George&#x27;s relationship with his wife and daughter, Caroline probably saw as much of her daughter as she wanted to.

When Charlotte was eight, her father, whose affections had returned to Fitzherbert, decided that he wanted Carlton House to himself. He took over his wife&#x27;s apartments (Caroline received space in Kensington Palace instead), and moved their daughter into Warwick House, adjacent to Carlton House. As James Chambers, another Charlotte biographer, put it, the young Princess &quot;lived in a household of her own, in the company of no one who was not paid to be there&quot;. The move took place without the presence of Charlotte&#x27;s governess, Lady Elgin, with whom she was very close. The governess had been forced to retire, ostensibly on account of age, but most likely because George was angry that she had taken the girl to see the King without George&#x27;s permission. George also dismissed the sub-governess, Miss Hayman, for being too friendly with Caroline—and the Princess of Wales promptly hired her. Lady Elgin&#x27;s replacement, Lady de Clifford, was fond of Charlotte, and too good-natured to discipline the child, who had grown into an exuberant tomboy. Lady de Clifford brought one of her grandsons, the Honourable George Keppel, three years younger than Charlotte, as a playmate for her. Forty years later, Keppel, by then Earl of Albemarle, would remember Charlotte in his memoirs, the source of many of the anecdotes of Charlotte as a small girl. In addition to tomboy tales of horses and fisticuffs, he remembered them seeing a crowd gathered outside the Keppel house at Earl&#x27;s Court, who were hoping to see the young Princess. The two children went outside and joined the crowd, unrecognised.

In 1805 the King began making plans for Charlotte&#x27;s education, and engaged a large staff of instructors for his only legitimate grandchild, with the Bishop of Exeter to instruct her in the Anglican faith that King George believed one day Charlotte, as queen, would defend. The King hoped that these teachers would &quot;render her an honour and comfort to her relations, and a blessing to the dominions over which she may hereafter preside&quot;. According to Holme, this instruction made little impression on Charlotte, who chose to learn only what she wanted to learn. Taught by composer Jane Mary Guest, Charlotte became an accomplished pianist.

Princess Caroline&#x27;s unconventional behaviour led, in 1807, to accusations that she had had sexual relations with other men since the separation. Caroline was caring for a young child, William Austin, who was alleged to be her child by another man. The Prince of Wales hoped that what was termed &quot;the Delicate Investigation&quot; would turn up evidence of adultery that would permit him to get a divorce, and forbade Charlotte to see her mother. Charlotte was aware of the investigation. The ten-year-old was deeply hurt when mother and daughter caught sight of each other in the park, and Caroline, obedient to the Prince&#x27;s command to have no contact with Charlotte, pretended not to see her. To George&#x27;s bitter disappointment, the investigating committee found no evidence Caroline had had a second child, though it noted that the Princess&#x27;s behaviour was very much open to misconstruction. The King, who was fond of Caroline, had refused to see her during the investigation, but began to receive her again afterwards. After the conclusion of the Delicate Investigation, the Prince reluctantly allowed Charlotte to see her mother again, with the condition that William Austin not be a playmate.

== Adolescence ==

As Charlotte entered her teenage years, members of the Court considered her behaviour undignified. Lady de Clifford complained about Charlotte&#x27;s allowing her ankle-length underdrawers to show. Lady Charlotte Bury, a lady-in-waiting to Caroline and a diarist whose writings have survived, described Princess Charlotte as a &quot;fine piece of flesh and blood&quot; who had a candid manner and rarely chose to &quot;put on dignity&quot;. Her father was proud of her horsemanship. She was fond of music by Mozart and Haydn, and she identified with the character of Marianne in &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;. In 1808 Charlotte Jones was appointed as Charlotte&#x27;s own official miniature portrait painter.

In late 1810 George III began his final descent into madness. Charlotte and the King were very fond of each other, and the young Princess was greatly saddened by his illness. On 6 February 1811, Charlotte&#x27;s father was sworn in as Prince Regent before the Privy Council, as she rode back and forth in the gardens outside Carlton House, trying to catch glimpses of the ceremony through the ground-floor windows. She was an enthusiastic Whig, as her father had been. However, now that he was exercising the powers of the monarchy, he did not recall the Whigs to office as many had expected him to do. Charlotte was outraged by what she saw as her father&#x27;s treason, and, at the opera, demonstrated her support by blowing kisses in the direction of the Whig leader, Earl Grey.

George had been raised under strict conditions, which he had rebelled against. Despite this, he attempted to put his daughter, who had the appearance of a grown woman at age 15, under even stricter conditions. He gave her a clothing allowance insufficient for an adult princess, and insisted that if she attended the opera, she was to sit in the rear of the box and leave before the end. With the Prince Regent busy with affairs of state, Charlotte was required to spend most of her time at Windsor with her maiden aunts. Bored, she soon became infatuated with her cousin George FitzClarence, illegitimate son of Prince William, Duke of Clarence. FitzClarence was, shortly thereafter, called to Brighton to join his regiment, and Charlotte&#x27;s gaze fell on Lieutenant Charles Hesse of the Light Dragoons, reputedly the illegitimate son of her uncle, Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany. Hesse and Charlotte had a number of clandestine meetings. Lady de Clifford feared the Prince Regent&#x27;s rage should they be found out, but Princess Caroline was delighted by her daughter&#x27;s passion. She did everything that she could to encourage the relationship, even allowing them time alone in a room in her apartments. These meetings ended when Hesse left to join the British forces in Spain. Most of the Royal Family, except the Prince Regent, were aware of these meetings, but did nothing to interfere, disapproving of the way George was treating his daughter.

In 1813 with the tide of the Napoleonic Wars having turned firmly in Britain&#x27;s favour, George began to seriously consider the question of Charlotte&#x27;s marriage. The Prince Regent and his advisers decided on William, Hereditary Prince of Orange, son and heir-apparent of Prince William VI of Orange. Such a marriage would increase British influence in Northwest Europe. William made a poor impression on Charlotte when she first saw him, at George&#x27;s birthday party on 12 August, when he became intoxicated, as did the Prince Regent himself and many of the guests. Although no one in authority had spoken to Charlotte about the proposed marriage, she was quite familiar with the plan through palace whispers. Dr. Henry Halford was detailed to sound out Charlotte about the match; he found her reluctant, feeling that a future British queen should not marry a foreigner. Believing that his daughter intended to marry Prince William Frederick, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh, the Prince Regent saw his daughter and verbally abused both her and Gloucester. According to Charlotte, &quot;He spoke as if he had the &quot;most improper ideas of my inclinations&quot;. I see that he is &quot;compleatly poisoned against me&quot;, and that he will &quot;never&quot; come round.&quot; She wrote to Earl Grey for advice; he suggested she play for time. The matter soon leaked to the papers, which wondered whether Charlotte would marry &quot;the Orange or the Cheese&quot; (a reference to Gloucester cheese), &quot;Slender Billy&quot; [of Orange] or &quot;Silly Billy&quot;. The Prince Regent attempted a gentler approach, but failed to convince Charlotte who wrote that &quot;I could not quit this country, as Queen of England &quot;still less&quot; and that if they wed, the Prince of Orange would have to &quot;visit his frogs solo&quot;&quot;. However, on 12 December, the Prince Regent arranged a meeting between Charlotte and the Prince of Orange at a dinner party, and asked Charlotte for her decision. She stated that she liked what she had seen so far, which George took as an acceptance, and quickly called in the Prince of Orange to inform him.

Negotiations over the marriage contract took several months, with Charlotte insisting that she not be required to leave Britain. The diplomats had no desire to see the two thrones united, and so the agreement stated that Britain would go to the couple&#x27;s oldest son, while the second son would inherit the Netherlands; if there was only one son, the Netherlands would pass to the German branch of the House of Orange. Charlotte signed the marriage contract on 10 June 1814. Charlotte had become besotted with a Prussian prince whose identity is uncertain; according to Charles Greville, it was Prince Augustus, although historian Arthur Aspinall disagreed, thinking that her love interest was the younger Prince Frederick. At a party at the Pulteney Hotel in London, Charlotte met a lieutenant-general in the Russian cavalry, Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. Charlotte invited Leopold to call on her, an invitation he took up, remaining for three quarters of an hour, and writing a letter to the Prince Regent apologising for any indiscretion. This letter impressed George very much, although he did not consider the impoverished Leopold as a possible suitor for his daughter&#x27;s hand.

The Princess of Wales opposed the match between her daughter and the Prince of Orange, and had great public support: when Charlotte went out in public, crowds would urge her not to abandon her mother by marrying the Prince of Orange. Charlotte informed the Prince of Orange that if they wed, her mother would have to be welcome in their home—a condition sure to be unacceptable to the Prince Regent. When the Prince of Orange would not agree, Charlotte broke off the engagement. Her father&#x27;s response was to order that Charlotte remain at her residence at Warwick House (adjacent to Carlton House) until she could be conveyed to Cranbourne Lodge at Windsor, where she would be allowed to see no one except the Queen. When told of this, Charlotte raced out into the street. A man, seeing her distress from a window, helped the inexperienced Princess find a hackney cab, in which she was conveyed to her mother&#x27;s house. Caroline was visiting friends and hastened back to her house, while Charlotte summoned Whig politicians to advise her. A number of family members also gathered, including her uncle, the Duke of York—with a warrant in his pocket to secure her return by force if need be. After lengthy arguments, the Whigs advised her to return to her father&#x27;s house, which she did the next day.

== Isolation and courtship ==

The story of Charlotte&#x27;s flight and return was soon the talk of the town; Henry Brougham, a former MP and future Whig Lord Chancellor, reported &quot;All are against the Prince&quot;, and the Opposition press made much of the tale of the runaway Princess. Despite an emotional reconciliation with his daughter, the Prince Regent soon had her conveyed to Cranbourne Lodge, where her attendants were under orders never to let her out of their sight. She was able to smuggle a note out to her favourite uncle, Prince Augustus, Duke of Sussex. The Duke responded by questioning the Tory prime minister, Lord Liverpool, in the House of Lords. He asked whether Charlotte was free to come and go, whether she was allowed to go to the seaside as doctors had recommended for her in the past, and now that she was eighteen, whether the government planned to give her a separate establishment. Liverpool evaded the questions, and the Duke was summoned to Carlton House and castigated by the Prince Regent, who never spoke with his brother again.

Despite her isolation, Charlotte found life at Cranbourne Lodge surprisingly agreeable, and slowly became reconciled to her situation. At the end of July 1814, the Prince Regent visited Charlotte in her isolation and informed her that her mother was about to leave England for an extended stay on the Continent. This upset Charlotte, but she did not feel that anything she might say could change her mother&#x27;s mind, and was further aggrieved by her mother&#x27;s casualness in the leavetaking, &quot;for God knows how long, &quot;or what events&quot; may occur before we meet again&quot;. Charlotte would never see her mother again. In late August, Charlotte was permitted to go to the seaside. She had asked to go to fashionable Brighton, but the Prince Regent refused, sending her instead to Weymouth. As the princess&#x27;s coach stopped along the way, large, friendly crowds gathered to see her; according to Holme, &quot;her affectionate welcome shows that already people thought of her as their future Queen&quot;. On arrival in Weymouth, there were illuminations with a centrepiece &quot;Hail Princess Charlotte, Europe&#x27;s Hope and Britain&#x27;s Glory&quot;. Charlotte spent time exploring nearby attractions, shopping for smuggled French silks, and from late September taking a course of heated seawater baths. She was still infatuated with her Prussian, and hoped in vain that he would declare his interest in her to the Prince Regent. If he did not do so, she wrote to a friend, she would &quot;take the next best thing, which was a good tempered man with good sence  ... that man is the P of S-C&quot; [Prince of Saxe-Coburg, i.e. Leopold]. In mid-December, shortly before leaving Weymouth, she &quot;had a very sudden and great shock&quot; when she received news that her Prussian had formed another attachment. In a long talk after Christmas dinner, father and daughter made up their differences.

In the early months of 1815, Charlotte fixed on Leopold (or as she termed him, &quot;the Leo&quot;) as a spouse. Her father refused to give up hope that Charlotte would agree to marry the Prince of Orange. However, Charlotte wrote, &quot;&quot;No arguments, no threats, shall ever bend&quot; me to marry this detested Dutchman.&quot; Faced with the united opposition of the Royal Family, George finally gave in and dropped the idea of marriage to the Prince of Orange, who became engaged to Grand Duchess Anna Pavlovna of Russia that summer. Charlotte contacted Leopold through intermediaries, and found him receptive, but with Napoleon renewing the conflict on the Continent, Leopold was with his regiment fighting. In July, shortly before returning to Weymouth, Charlotte formally requested her father&#x27;s permission to marry Leopold. The Prince Regent replied that with the unsettled political situation on the Continent, he could not consider such a request. To Charlotte&#x27;s frustration, Leopold did not come to Britain after the restoration of peace, even though he was stationed in Paris, which she deemed to be only a short journey from Weymouth or London.

In January 1816, the Prince Regent invited his daughter to the Royal Pavilion in Brighton, and she pleaded with him to allow the marriage. On her return to Windsor, she wrote her father, &quot;I no longer hesitate in declaring my partiality in favour of the Prince of Coburg—assuring you that no one will be more steady or consistent in this their present &amp; last engagement than myself.&quot; George gave in and summoned Leopold, who was in Berlin en route to Russia, to Britain. Leopold arrived in Britain in late February 1816, and went to Brighton to be interviewed by the Prince Regent. After Charlotte was invited as well, and had dinner with Leopold and her father, she wrote:


The Prince Regent was impressed by Leopold, and told his daughter that Leopold &quot;had every qualification to make a woman happy&quot;. Charlotte was sent back to Cranbourne on 2 March, leaving Leopold with the Prince Regent. On 14 March, an announcement was made in the British House of Commons to great acclaim, with both parties relieved to have the drama of Charlotte&#x27;s romances at an end. Parliament voted through a bill naturalising Leopold as a British citizen, awarded him £50,000 per year (equivalent to £ in ), purchased Claremont House for the couple, and allowed them a generous single payment to set up house. George also contemplated making Leopold a royal duke, the Duke of Kendal, though the plan was abandoned due to government fears that it would draw Leopold into party politics and suggestions that becoming a &#x27;mere duchess&#x27; would be viewed as a demotion for Charlotte. Fearful of a repetition of the Orange fiasco, George limited Charlotte&#x27;s contact with Leopold; when Charlotte returned to Brighton, he allowed them to meet only at dinner, and never let them be alone together.

The marriage ceremony was set for 2 May 1816. On the wedding day, huge crowds filled London; the wedding participants had great difficulties in travelling. At nine o&#x27;clock in the evening in the Crimson Drawing Room at Carlton House, with Leopold dressing for the first time as a British General (the Prince Regent wore the uniform of a Field Marshal), the couple were married. Charlotte&#x27;s wedding dress cost over £10,000 (equivalent to £ in ). The only mishap was during the ceremony, when Charlotte was heard to giggle when the impoverished Leopold promised to endow her with all his worldly goods.

== Marriage and death ==
The couple honeymooned at Oatlands Palace, the Duke of York&#x27;s residence in Surrey. Neither was well and the house was filled with the Yorks&#x27; dogs and the odour of animals. Nevertheless, Charlotte wrote that Leopold was &quot;the perfection of a lover&quot;. Two days after the marriage, the Prince Regent visited the couple at Oatlands; he spent two hours describing the details of military uniforms to Leopold, which according to Charlotte &quot;is a &quot;great mark&quot; of the &quot;most perfect good humour&quot;&quot;. The couple returned to London for the social season, and when they attended the theatre, they were invariably treated to wild applause from the audience and the singing of &quot;God Save the King&quot; from the company. When she was taken ill at the Opera, there was great public concern about her condition. It was announced that she had suffered a miscarriage. On 24 August 1816, they took up residence for the first time at Claremont.

Leopold&#x27;s physician-in-ordinary, Christian Stockmar (later, as Baron Stockmar, adviser to both Queen Victoria and Prince Albert), wrote that in the first six months of the marriage, he had never seen Charlotte wear anything that was not simple and in good taste. He also noted that she was much more calm and in control of herself than she used to be, and attributed this to Leopold&#x27;s influence. Leopold wrote later, &quot;Except when I went out to shoot, we were together always, and we &quot;could&quot; be together, we did not tire.&quot; When Charlotte became too excited, Leopold would say only, &quot;Doucement, chérie&quot; (&quot;Gently, my love&quot;). Charlotte both accepted the correction and began calling her husband &quot;Doucement&quot;.

The Coburgs, as they came to be called, spent the Christmas holidays at the Brighton Pavilion with various other royals. On 7 January, the Prince Regent gave a huge ball there to celebrate Charlotte&#x27;s 21st birthday, but the Coburgs did not attend, having returned to Claremont and preferring to remain there quietly. At the end of April 1817, Leopold informed the Prince Regent that Charlotte was again pregnant, and that there was every prospect of her carrying the baby to term.

Charlotte&#x27;s pregnancy was the subject of the most intense public interest. Betting shops quickly set up book on what sex the child would be. Economists calculated that the birth of a princess would raise the stock market by 2.5%; the birth of a prince would raise it 6%. Charlotte spent her time quietly, spending much time sitting for a portrait by Sir Thomas Lawrence. She ate heavily and got little exercise; when her medical team began prenatal care in August 1817, they put her on a strict diet, hoping to reduce the size of the child at birth. The diet, and occasional bleeding, seemed to weaken Charlotte. Stockmar was amazed at a treatment he saw as outdated, and declined to join the medical team, believing that, as a foreigner, he would be blamed if anything went wrong.

Much of Charlotte&#x27;s day to day care was undertaken by Sir Richard Croft. Croft was not a physician, but an , much in fashion among the well-to-do. Charlotte was believed to be due to deliver on 19 October, but as October ended, she had shown no signs of giving birth, and drove out as usual with Leopold on Sunday 2 November. On the evening of 3 November, her contractions began. Croft encouraged her to exercise, but would not let her eat: late that evening, he sent for the officials who were to witness and attest to the royal birth. As the fourth of November became the fifth, it became clear that Charlotte might be unable to deliver the child, and Croft and Charlotte&#x27;s personal physician, Matthew Baillie, decided to send for obstetrician John Sims. However, Croft did not allow Sims to see the patient, and forceps were not used. Plowden suggests that they might have saved her and the child, though there was a very high mortality rate when instruments were used in the era before antiseptics.

At nine o&#x27;clock in the evening of 5 November, Charlotte finally gave birth to a large stillborn boy. Efforts to resuscitate him were in vain, and the noble observers confirmed that it was a handsome boy, resembling the Royal Family. They were assured that the mother was doing well, and took their leave. An exhausted Charlotte heard the news calmly, stating it was the will of God. She took some nourishment after her lengthy fast and seemed to be recovering. Leopold, who had remained with his wife throughout, apparently took an opiate and collapsed into bed.

Soon after midnight, Charlotte began vomiting violently and complaining of pains in her abdomen. Croft was called, and was alarmed to find his patient cold to the touch, breathing with difficulty, and bleeding. He placed hot compresses on her, the accepted treatment at the time for postpartum bleeding, but the blood did not stop. He called in Stockmar and urged him to bring Leopold. Stockmar found Leopold difficult to rouse, and went to see Charlotte, who grabbed his hand and told him, &quot;They have made me tipsy.&quot; Stockmar left the room, planning to try again to rouse Leopold, but was called back by Charlotte&#x27;s voice, &quot;Stocky! Stocky!&quot; He entered the room to find her dead.

== Aftermath ==
Henry Brougham, one of the chief advisers to Queen Caroline, wrote of the public reaction to Charlotte&#x27;s death, &quot;It really was as though every household throughout Great Britain had lost a favourite child.&quot; The whole kingdom went into deep mourning; linen-drapers ran out of black cloth. Even the poor and homeless tied armbands of black on their clothes. The shops closed for two weeks, as did the Royal Exchange, the Law Courts, and the docks. Even gambling dens shut down on the day of her funeral, as a mark of respect. Wrote &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;It certainly does not belong to us to repine at the visitations of Providence ... there is nothing impious in grieving for that as a calamity.&quot; Mourning was so complete that the makers of ribbons and other fancy goods (which could not be worn during the period of mourning) petitioned the government to shorten the period, fearing they would otherwise go bankrupt. 

The Prince Regent was prostrate with grief, and was unable to attend his child&#x27;s funeral. Princess Caroline heard the news from a passing courier, and fainted in shock. On recovering, she stated, &quot;England, that great country, has lost everything in losing my ever beloved daughter.&quot; Even the Prince of Orange burst into tears at hearing the news, and his wife ordered the ladies of her court into mourning. The greatest effect fell on Prince Leopold. Stockmar wrote years later, &quot;November saw the ruin of this happy home, and the destruction at one blow of every hope and happiness of Prince Leopold. He has never recovered the feeling of happiness which had blessed his short married life.&quot; According to Holme, &quot;without Charlotte he was incomplete. It was as if he had lost his heart.&quot; Leopold remained a widower until remarrying in 1832 to Louise of Orleans when he had become King of the Belgians. His youngest daughter, later known as Empress Carlota of Mexico, was named in honour of his lost wife.

Prince Leopold wrote to Sir Thomas Lawrence:

Charlotte was buried, her son at her feet, in St. George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle, on 19 November 1817. A monument by the sculptor Matthew Cotes Wyatt was erected, by public subscription, at her tomb. It was not long before the public began to pin blame for the tragedy. The Queen and the Prince Regent were blamed for not being present at the birth, though Charlotte had specifically requested that they stay away. Although the post-mortem was inconclusive, many blamed Croft for his care of the princess. The Prince Regent refused to blame Croft; nevertheless, three months after Charlotte&#x27;s death and while attending another young woman, Croft snatched up a gun and fatally shot himself. The &quot;triple obstetric tragedy&quot;—death of child, mother, and practitioner—led to significant changes in obstetric practice, with obstetricians who favoured intervention in protracted labour, including in particular more liberal use of forceps, gaining ground over those who did not.

An obelisk in memory of Charlotte was erected by the then Liberal MP for Walsall, Robert Wellbeloved Scott, in the grounds of his country house (now Red House Park, in Sandwell). Having become badly damaged through age, the obelisk was restored in August 2009, at cost of £15,000.

Charlotte&#x27;s death left the King without any legitimate grandchildren; his youngest surviving child was over forty. The newspapers urged the King&#x27;s unmarried sons towards matrimony. One such leading article reached the King&#x27;s fourth son, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, at his home in Brussels, where he was living with his mistress, Julie de St Laurent. Edward quickly dismissed his mistress and proposed to Leopold&#x27;s sister Victoria, Dowager Princess of Leiningen. They married in May 1818 and their only child was born twelve months later. This daughter, Victoria, became Queen of the United Kingdom in 1837.

<text>Vostok 5 (, &quot;Orient 5&quot; or &quot;East 5&quot;) was a joint mission of the Soviet space program together with Vostok 6; as with the previous pair of Vostok 3 and Vostok 4 the two Vostok spacecraft came close to one another in orbit and established a radio link.

Vostok 5 launched on 14 June 1963, and returned to Earth on 19 June, and was piloted by Valery Bykovsky.

==Mission==
Several delays plagued the prelaunch preparations of Vostok 5, the biggest being concern over elevated solar flare activity. At this early phase, it was not well understood what effects this might have on the spacecraft and its passenger, so the planned launch date of 11 June was postponed a few days. On the 14th, Bykovsky was strapped into the capsule awaiting liftoff when further delays occurred. A gyroscope in the Blok E stage malfunctioned and needed to be replaced, but this would mean removing the propellants from the booster, taking it down from the pad back to the vehicle assembly building, and delaying the launch another several days. It was decided to take the calculated risk of simply doing the repair work on the fully fueled launch vehicle. A replacement gyroscope was quickly installed and liftoff took place at 2:59 PM Moscow time. One last minor problem popped up when a pad umbilical failed to disconnect, but as soon as the booster began lifting, it was yanked out. The launch proceeded without any difficulties, although the Blok E stage slightly underperformed and put the spacecraft into a lower-than-intended orbit at 108×137 miles (175×222 kilometers) versus the normal 112×146 miles (181×235 kilometers).

Cosmonaut Valery Bykovsky was originally intended to stay in orbit for eight days, but the mission details changed many times due to elevated levels of solar flare activity at the time and he was eventually ordered back after five days. This remains the record for solo crewed flight in Earth orbit. In addition, the low orbit of the spacecraft made it uncertain as to whether decay would not occur in under eight days. This combined with solar flare activity affecting the diameter of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere might potentially introduce drag that could not only cause premature reentry, but result in Vostok 5 landing almost anywhere on Earth.

Bykovsky performed a couple of simple scientific experiments in orbit and also practiced exercise and testing his body&#x27;s reactions to weightlessness. In the postflight debriefing, he would say that the overall design of the spacecraft was good, but the clock was in a location that made it hard to see and the instrument panel was placed too far away. The first aid kit could not be reached at all without unstrapping from the seat. Like Valentina Tereshkova, he noted that the helmet headset produced sharp, unpleasant noise. He described the food as generally of good quality, although it probably should not be eaten before launch.

A problem with the spacecraft&#x27;s waste collection system is reported to have made conditions &quot;unpleasant&quot; in the capsule. The only other difficulty encountered was that, like on Vostok 1 and Vostok 2, the re-entry module failed to separate cleanly from the service module when it was time for Bykovsky to come home and he experienced several seconds of sharp vibrations following separations.

The Vostok 5 landing coordinates were , 2 km northwest of Karatal, North Kazakhstan, Kazakhstan; and 550 km northwest of Karagandy, Kazakhstan. A group of local farmers greeted Bykovsky prior to rescue crews arriving. At the landing location is a small fenced park with two monuments. One monument is a 10-meter tall silver rectangle with a small stone marker nearby listing the date of the landing. The second monument is an L-shaped sandy colored stone structure. One leg of the &quot;L&quot; is an observation deck with stairs leading to it. The other leg of the &quot;L&quot; has a space-themed mural carved into the stone face. The mural depicts a floating cosmonaut in a spacesuit surrounded by stars, telescopes, planets, and the Sun.

The re-entry capsule is on display at the Tsiolkovsky Museum in Kaluga.

<text>Vostok 6 (, &quot;Orient 6&quot; or &quot;East 6&quot;) was the first human spaceflight to carry a woman, cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova, into space.

==Mission==
The spacecraft was launched on 16 June 1963. While Vostok 5 had been delayed by technical problems, Vostok 6&#x27;s launch proceeded with no difficulties. Data collected during the mission provided better understanding of the female body&#x27;s reaction to spaceflight. Like other cosmonauts on Vostok missions, Tereshkova maintained a flight log, took photographs, and manually oriented the spacecraft. Her photographs of the horizon from space were later used to identify aerosol layers within the atmosphere. The mission, a joint flight with Vostok 5, was originally conceived as being a joint mission with two Vostoks each carrying a female cosmonaut, but this changed as the Vostok program experienced cutbacks as a precursor to the retooling of the program into the Voskhod program. Vostok 6 was the last flight of a Vostok 3KA spacecraft and the final flight of the Vostok programme.

The Vostok 6 landing site coordinates are , west of Barnaul, Altai, Russia and south of Baevo, and northeast of Karagandy, Kazakhstan. At the site, in a small park at the roadside is a statue of Tereshkova, with arms outstretched, at the top of a curved column.

The capsule is now on display at the RKK Energia Museum in Korolyov (near Moscow). From September 2015 it formed part of the content of the &quot;Cosmonauts&quot; exhibition at the Science Museum, London. The Exhibition featured many iconic objects from the Soviet space program.

=== During flight ===
The Soviet state television network broadcast live video of Tereshkova from a camera inside the capsule, and she conversed with Premier Nikita Khrushchev over the radio. Communications with ground controllers about her overall health were described in post-flight reports as &quot;evasive&quot;, and later official accounts of the mission had somewhat condescending remarks about Tereshkova&#x27;s overall in-flight performance.
In Tereshkova&#x27;s account of the mission in her postflight debriefing, she mentioned having assorted body pains and difficulty with her helmet headset (also reported by Bykovsky on Vostok 5). She vomited while attempting to eat, although she attributed this to the taste of the food rather than her physical condition. Another problem was that while the Soviet space agency had provided her with food, water and tooth paste, they had forgotten to pack a toothbrush.

An official history of the Soviet space program published in 1973 described Tereshkova&#x27;s physical condition and in-flight performance as (, &#x27;fair&#x27; or &#x27;adequate&#x27;) rather than (, &#x27;good&#x27; or &#x27;outstanding&#x27;).

=== During landing ===
Like all the previous Vostok flights, Tereshkova had to eject. She landed safely by parachute.

It was revealed in 2004 that an error in the control program made the spaceship ascend from orbit instead of descending. Tereshkova noticed the fault on the first day of the flight and reported it to spacecraft designer Sergey Korolev. Flight controllers then provided Tereshkova with data to enter into the descent program. By request of Korolev, Tereshkova kept the problem secret. &quot;I kept silent, but Evgeny Vasilievich decided to make it public. So, I can easily talk about it now.&quot;

<doc id="194323" wikidata="Q912455" url="?curid=194323" title="Danish and Norwegian alphabet">
<text>The Danish and Norwegian alphabet is the set of symbols, forming a variant of the Latin alphabet, used for writing the Danish and Norwegian languages. It has consisted of the following 29 letters since 1917 (Norwegian) and 1948 (Danish):

The letters , , , and are not used in the spelling of indigenous words. They are rarely used in Norwegian, where loan words routinely have their orthography adapted to the native sound system. Conversely, Danish has a greater tendency to preserve loan words&#x27; original spellings. In particular, a that represents is almost never normalized to in Danish, as would most often happen in Norwegian. Many words originally derived from Latin roots retain in their Danish spelling, for example Norwegian vs Danish .

The &quot;foreign&quot; letters also sometimes appear in the spelling of otherwise-indigenous family names. For example, many of the Danish families that use the surname (meaning &#x27;forest&#x27;) spell it .

The difference between the Dano-Norwegian and the Swedish alphabet is that Swedish uses the variant instead of , and the variant instead of , similarly to German. Also, the collating order for these three letters is different in Swedish: &quot;Å, Ä, Ö&quot;. and are sorted together in all Scandinavian languages, as well as Finnish, and so are and .

==Letters and their names==
The below pronunciations of the names of the letters do not necessarily represent how the letters are used to represent sounds. The list includes the number of each letter when following official ordering.



==Ordering==
===Danish===
When sorting in alphabetical order in Danish, the numbers provided in the list above is used. Some peculiarities exist, however. 
*The digraph is sorted as if it was if it represents one vowel sound. This means it is sorted like two adjacent cases of when it represents two syllables, e.g. as a result of a compound (e.g. &#x27;air conditioner&#x27;). It does not matter which vowel sound is represented, meaning that words like &#x27;Afrikaans&#x27; and &#x27;Canaanite&#x27; should be sorted as if they have an despite not containing any sounds commonly represented by . If two entries contain exactly the same letters except and , the form with comes first. 
*If two entries only differ in capitalization, but otherwise contain precisely the same letters, the word with capitalization comes first.
*Accents are not taken into account, except when it is the only difference, in which case the form without an accent comes first.
*In foreign proper names, the letters are sorted as respectively. In the case of a Danish vs. non-Danish letter being the only difference in the names, the name with a Danish letter comes first.
*For expressions of multiple words (e.g. ), one can choose between ignoring the space or sorting the space, the lack of any letter, first.

== Diacritics ==
===Danish===
Danish orthography has no compulsory diacritics, but allows the use of an acute accent () for disambiguation. Most often, an accent on marks a stressed syllable in one of a pair of homographs that have different stresses, for example &#x27;a boy&#x27; versus &#x27;one boy&#x27;, or &#x27;all, every, everyone&#x27; versus &#x27;avenue&#x27;. Less often, any vowel including (where it is however recommended to avoid diacritics) may be accented to indicate stress on the word, as this can disambiguate the meaning of the sentence or ease the reading otherwise. For example: &#x27;I was standing&#x27; versus &#x27;I got out of bed&#x27; (i.e. unit accentuation). Alternatively, some of these distinctions can be made using typographical emphasis (italics, underlining). The dictionary explicitly allows the use of further diacritics when quoting names from other languages. This also means that the ring above and the strike through are not regarded as diacritics, as these are separate letters.

===Norwegian===
Nynorsk uses several letters with diacritic signs: , , , , , , and . The diacritic signs are not compulsory, but can be added to clarify the meaning of words (homonyms) that would otherwise be identical. One example is (&quot;a boy&quot;) versus (&quot;one boy&quot;). Loanwords may be spelled with other diacritics, most notably , , and , following the conventions of the original language. The Norwegian vowels , and never take diacritics.

Bokmål is mostly spelled without diacritic signs. The only exception is one word of Norwegian origin, namely , to be distinguished from (see below) as well as any subsequent compound words, eg (coat lining) and (animal feed). There are also a small number of words in Norwegian which use the acute accent. The words are (avenue), (diarrhea), (cafe), (idea), (entrance), (committee), (compartment), (mosque), (supper), (trophy) and (discreet). An acute accent can also be used to differentiate / (a) from / (one) eg. (one boy) (a boy).

The diacritic signs in use include the acute accent, grave accent and the circumflex. A common example of how the diacritics change the meaning of a word, is :
* (preposition. &quot;for&quot; or &quot;to&quot;), 
* (verb. &quot;went&quot;, in the sense &quot;left&quot;), 
* (noun. &quot;furrow&quot;, only Nynorsk), 
* (noun. &quot;fodder&quot;), , the circumflex indicating the elision of the edh from the Norse spelling ( → ; → )
* (noun &quot;lining&quot;, as in a garment)

Also used is the cedille, but only on a in loanwords, when pronounced like .
* Françoise
* provençalsk
* Curaçao

== History ==
The letter (HTML &amp;aring;) was introduced in Norwegian in 1917, replacing . The new letter came from the Swedish alphabet, where it has been in official use since the 16th century. Similarly, the letter was introduced in Danish in 1948, but the final decision on its place in the alphabet was not made. The initial proposal was to place it first, before . Its place as the last letter of the alphabet, as in Norwegian, was decided in 1955. The former digraph still occurs in personal names, and in Danish geographical names. In Norway, geographical names tend to follow the current orthography, meaning that the letter will be used. Family names may not follow modern orthography, and therefore retain the digraph where would be used today. remains in use as a transliteration, if the letter is not available for technical reasons. is treated like in alphabetical sorting, not like two adjacent letters , meaning that while is the first letter of the alphabet, is the last. In Norwegian (but not in Danish), this rule does not apply to non-Scandinavian names, so a modern atlas would list the German city of Aachen under , but list the Danish town of Aabenraa under . In Danish, the rule is applied, as long as it denotes one sound, for example German Aachen or Dutch kraal, but if it denotes 2 sounds like in (extra work), the two s are sorted as two.

In current Danish and Norwegian, is recognized as a separate letter from . In Danish, the transition was made in 1980; before that, the was merely considered to be a variation of the letter and words using it were sometimes alphabetized accordingly (e.g., &quot;Wandel, Vandstad, Wanscher, Varberg&quot; in &quot;Dansk Biografisk Leksikon&quot;, 1904). The Danish version of the Alphabet song still states that the alphabet has 28 letters; the last line reads (&quot;that makes twenty-eight&quot;). However, today, the letter is considered an official letter.

== Computing standards ==

In computing, several different coding standards have existed for this alphabet:
* DS 2089 (Danish) and NS 4551-1 (Norwegian), later established in international standard ISO 646
* IBM PC code page 865
* ISO 8859-1
* Unicode

<text>The Swedish alphabet () is a basic element of the Latin writing system used for the Swedish language. The 29 letters of this alphabet are the modern 26-letter basic Latin alphabet ( to ) plus , , and , in that order. It contains 20 consonants and 9 vowels (). The Latin alphabet was brought to Sweden along with the Christianization of the population, although runes continued in use throughout the first centuries of Christianity, even for ecclesiastic purposes, despite their traditional relation to the Old Norse religion. The runes underwent partial &quot;latinization&quot; in the Middle Ages, when the Latin alphabet was completely accepted as the Swedish script system, but runes still occurred, especially in the countryside, until the 18th century, and were used decoratively until mid 19th century.

==Letters==
The pronunciation of the &quot;names&quot; of the letters (that does not necessarily coincide with the sounds the letters represent) is as follows:





===Å, Ä and Ö===
In addition to the 26 letters of the ISO basic Latin alphabet, A through Z, the Swedish alphabet includes Å, Ä, and Ö at the end. They are distinct letters in Swedish and are sorted after .

===Uncommon letters===
The letter is rare. was common in ordinary words before 1889, when its replacement by was allowed. Since 1900, only the forms with are listed in dictionaries. Some proper names kept their despite the change to common words: Qvist, Quist, Husqvarna, Quenby, Quinby, Quintus, Quirin and Quirinus. Other uses include some loanwords that retained , including &quot;queer&quot;, &quot;quisling&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;quilting&quot;; student terms such as &quot;gasque&quot;; and foreign geographic names like &quot;Qatar&quot;.

The letter is rare. Before the 19th century, was interchangeable with ( was used in Fraktur, in Antiqua). Official orthographic standards since 1801 use only for common words. Many family names kept their despite the change to common words. Foreign words and names bring in uses of , particularly combinations with &quot;webb&quot; for (World Wide) Web. Swedish sorting traditionally and officially treated and as equivalent, so that users would not have to guess whether the word, or name, they were seeking was spelled with a or a . The two letters were often combined in the collating sequence as if they were all or all , until 2006 when the 13th edition of &quot;Svenska Akademiens ordlista&quot; (The Swedish Academy&#x27;s Orthographic Dictionary) declared a change. was given its own section in the dictionary, and the = sorting rule was deprecated. This means Swedish books printed before 2006 would group with in the index, and most Swedish software published before 2006 would treat the two as variations of a single character when sorting text.

The letter is rare, used in names and a few loanwords such as &quot;zone&quot;. historically represented . By 1700, this had merged with . As a result, was replaced by in 1700. was instead used in loanwords for historical . is the second least used letter in Swedish, before .

===Foreign letters===
The characters (which is used only in a few rare non-integrated loanwords such as , from French) and (used in some integrated loanwords like and , and in some surnames such as or ) are recognised but regarded as variants of and , respectively.

The umlauted is recognised but is only used in names of German origin, and in German loanwords such as . It is otherwise treated as a variant of and is called &quot;German &quot;.

For foreign names, and many others might be used, but are usually converted to , etc.

The letters and , used in Danish and Norwegian, are considered variants of and , and are collated as such. Unlike letters with diacritics like , , , etc. and are not easily available on Swedish keyboards, and are thus often replaced with and . The news agency TT follows this usage because some newspapers have no technical support for and , although there is a recommendation to use and . The letter was used in earlier Swedish script systems, when there was in general more similarity between the Scandinavian languages. 

The ligature , used in Latin as a variant of , is used in some Swedish surnames. It is then considered equivalent with and collated accordingly. However, sometimes it is collated as : in the 14th edition of the &quot;Svenska Akademiens ordlista&quot;, the words (from the surname Læstadius) are sorted between and .

=== Handwritten cursive alphabet ===

The Swedish traditional handwritten alphabet is the same as the ordinary Latin cursive alphabet, but the letters and are written by connecting the dots with a curved line, identical to a tilde , hence looking like and . In text the dots should be clearly separated, but in handwriting writers frequently replace them with a macron : , .

==Sound–spelling correspondences==
Short vowels are followed by two or more consonants; long vowels are followed by a single consonant, by a vowel or are word-final.

===Spellings for the -phoneme ===
Due to several phonetic combinations coalescing over recent centuries, the spelling of the Swedish sje-sound is very eclectic. Some estimates claim that there are over 50 possible different spellings of the sound, though this figure is disputed. Garlén (1988) gives a list of 22 spellings (, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ), but many of them are confined to only a few words, often loanwords, and all of them can correspond to other sounds or sound sequences as well. Some spellings of the sje-sound are as follows:

* in most French loanwords, but in final position often respelled . English loanwords with this spelling usually use the &quot;tje&quot;-sound
* in words mainly from French, for example (generous) and (generous, posh, stylish)
* mostly in the end of the word in many French loanwords, like &quot;garage&quot;, &quot;prestige&quot;
* in for example (religious)
* in French loanwords, e.g. (jalousie window)
* in (fascinate)
* in all positions in many German loanwords, like (&quot;chess&quot;)
* in all positions in many English loanwords
* in many native Swedish words
* in native Swedish words before the front vowels 
* in five words only, four of which are enumerated in the phrase (In just &quot;his shirt&quot; he &quot;pushes&quot; the &quot;vehicle&quot; into the &quot;shed&quot;). The fifth word is (shear). It is also used in an old word (Eurasian magpie) and dialectic derivations of the same
* in four words only: , , , 
* in three words only: , , . These are not common and are often pronounced as . All of them are compound words: väst+göte (person from Västergötland) öst+göte (person from Östergötland) and gäst+giveri (inn)
* occurs only in the words , , , , the place-name &quot;Kristianstad&quot;, and in the pronunciation of the name &quot;Christian&quot; when used about Danish kings
* in five words only, all enumerated in the phrase (It is easier to &quot;steal&quot; a &quot;stalk&quot; than to &quot;overturn&quot; a &quot;star&quot; with &quot;your behind&quot;)
* , , () in many words of Latin origin, e. g. , (in a few of these words, the sje-sound is preceded by a , e. g. , ); also for is used before vowels in some adjective derivations (e. g. , )
* for the sequence occurs only in the place-name Växjö
