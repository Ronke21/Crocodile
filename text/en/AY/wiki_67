<text>The IAS machine was the first electronic computer built at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) in Princeton, New Jersey. It is sometimes called the von Neumann machine, since the paper describing its design was edited by John von Neumann, a mathematics professor at both Princeton University and IAS. The computer was built under his direction, starting in 1946 and finished in 1951.
The general organization is called von Neumann architecture, even though it was both conceived and implemented by others. The computer is in the collection of the Smithsonian National Museum of American History but is not currently on display.

==History==

Julian Bigelow was hired as chief engineer in May 1946. Hewitt Crane, Herman Goldstine, Gerald Estrin, Arthur Burks, George W. Brown and Willis Ware also worked on the project.
The machine was in limited operation in the summer of 1951 and fully operational on June 10, 1952. It was in operation until July 15, 1958.

==Description==
The IAS machine was a binary computer with a 40-bit word, storing two 20-bit instructions in each word. The memory was 1,024 words (5 kilobytes in modern terminology). Negative numbers were represented in two&#x27;s complement format. It had two general-purpose registers available: the Accumulator (AC) and Multiplier/Quotient (MQ). It used 1,700 vacuum tubes (triode types: 6J6, 5670, 5687, a few diodes: type 6AL5, 150 pentodes to drive the memory CRTs, and 41 CRTs (type: 5CP1A): 40 used as Williams tubes for memory plus one more to monitor the state of a memory tube). The memory was originally designed for about 2,300 RCA Selectron vacuum tubes. Problems with the development of these complex tubes forced the switch to Williams tubes.

It weighed about .

It was an asynchronous machine, meaning that there was no central clock regulating the timing of the instructions. One instruction started executing when the previous one finished. The addition time was 62 microseconds and the multiplication time was 713 microseconds.

Although some claim the IAS machine was the first design to mix programs and data in a single memory, that had been implemented four years earlier by the 1948 Manchester Baby. The Soviet MESM also became operational prior to the IAS machine.

Von Neumann showed how the combination of instructions and data in one memory could be used to implement loops, by modifying branch instructions when a loop was completed, for example. The requirement that instructions, data and input/output be accessed via the same bus later came to be known as the Von Neumann bottleneck.

==IAS machine derivatives==
Plans for the IAS machine were widely distributed to any schools, businesses, or companies interested in computing machines, resulting in the construction of several derivative computers referred to as &quot;IAS machines&quot;, although they were not software compatible.

Some of these &quot;IAS machines&quot; were:

*AVIDAC (Argonne National Laboratory)

<doc id="194609" wikidata="Q981305" url="?curid=194609" title="Spoke wrench">
<text>A spoke wrench or spoke key is a small wrench or tool used to adjust the tension in the spokes of a tension-spoked wheel. A spoke wrench is sometimes called a nipple wrench, as it is the spoke nipple – not the spoke – that is turned in the process of changing the tension of a spoke.

==Overview==
Spoke nipples are typically T-shaped in cross section, with an internal thread running part of the way through the hole that runs along the spoke nipple&#x27;s principal axis. A spoke nipple rests in a hole drilled radially through the wheel&#x27;s rim, and the nipple is threaded onto the external thread of a spoke. The spoke itself is fixed, at its other end, through a hole in the hub. The spoke and nipple are functionally equivalent to a bolt and a nut. However, unlike a typical nut-and-bolt pair, a spoke and nipple do not join two parts (the rim and the hub) so much as bridge them, under tension.

The area of the nipple around which the spoke wrench, or key, is fitted is generally square in cross-section. The tool grips the square of the nipple on either 3 or 4 sides; the latter type has a small cutout to enable it to be fitted over a spoke, after which it may be slid along to engage all four flats of the nipple. Gripping all four sides of the nipple results in less chance of rounding off the nipple than the 3-sided type, but is slower to use.

==Sizes==

Spoke Wrench Size does not correlate to Spoke Gauge. For example, a 3.23mm Spoke Wrench might be used on 15ga, 14ga, and even 13ga.


==Use==
A spoke wrench is used during the assembly, maintenance, or repair of bicycle wheels to adjust the tension of the spokes. The goal common to these activities is to bring the wheel (nearer) to the state of true — namely, a wheel in which the rim is: 
# a circle concentric with the axis of the axle in the hub, and 
# planar, such that the plane of the rim is centered laterally between the two extremes of the axle where it is supported in a frame.

A further goal it is to adjust the tension of the spokes so that they are brought as close to equal tension on each side of a wheel as is possible given the initial properties of the wheel&#x27;s rim. This act of equalizing tension is called &quot;tension balancing&quot; and results in a stronger wheel. On modern bicycles, considerable space is needed for multi-speed clusters of gears as well as disc brakes; this means that there are usually two lengths of spokes on each wheel, one length per side. The act of shifting over the centerline of the rim between axle locknuts is referred to as &quot;dishing the wheel&quot;. A wheel calibrated so that the planar centerline of the rim corresponds the vertical centerline of the finished bicycle is referred to as &quot;properly dished&quot;.

By increasing or decreasing the tension of individual spokes, or groups of spokes, around the circumference, a wheelbuilder or bicycle mechanic can correct for local deviations from true – e.g. wobbles, or hops.

<doc id="194610" wikidata="Q336697" url="?curid=194610" title="John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale">
<text>John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale, KG, PC (24 May 1616 – 24 August 1682) was a Scottish statesman and peer.

==Background==
Maitland was a member of an ancient family of both Berwickshire and East Lothian, the eldest surviving son of John Maitland, 2nd Lord Maitland of Thirlestane (d. 1645), (who had been created Viscount of Lauderdale in 1616, and Earl of Lauderdale etc., in 1624), and of Lady Isabel (1594–1638), daughter of Alexander Seton, 1st Earl of Dunfermline and great-grandson of Sir Richard Maitland of Lethington, the poet.

==Covenanter==
Maitland began public life as a zealous adherent of the Presbyterian cause, took the Covenant, sat as an elder in the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland at St Andrews in July 1643, and was sent to the Kingdom of England as a Commissioner for the Covenant in August, and to attend the Westminster Assembly in November.

==Privy Councillor in two kingdoms==
In February 1644 he was a member of the Privy Council of England and the Privy Council of Scotland, and on 20 November was one of the Commissioners appointed to meet the king at Uxbridge, when he made efforts to persuade King Charles I to agree to the establishment of Presbyterianism. In 1645 he advised Charles to reject the proposals of Independents, and in 1647 he was in London when the Scottish Estates in Edinburgh ordered the king&#x27;s surrender to the Scots.

==Second English Civil War and the Worcester Campaign==

Once Charles surrendered to the Scots, Lauderdale veered round completely to the king&#x27;s cause, had several interviews with him, and engaged in various projects for his restoration, offering the aid of the Scots, on the condition of Charles&#x27;s consent to the establishment of Presbyterianism, and on 26 December he obtained from Charles at Carisbrooke Castle &quot;The Engagement&quot; by which Presbyterianism was to be established for three years, schismatics were to be suppressed, and the acts of the Parliament of Scotland ratified, the king in addition promising to admit the Scottish nobles into public employment in England and to reside frequently in Scotland.

Returning to Scotland, in the spring of 1648, Lauderdale joined the party of Hamilton in alliance with the English royalists. Their defeat at the Battle of Preston, postponed the arrival of the Charles, Prince of Wales, but Lauderdale had an interview with the prince in the Downs in August, and from this period obtained supreme influence over the future king. He persuaded Prince Charles later to accept the invitation to Scotland from Archibald Campbell, Marquess of Argyll&#x27;s faction, accompanied him thither in 1650 and in the expedition into England, and was captured following the Battle of Worcester in 1651. He escaped from the city in the company of the Earl of Derby and Duke of Buckingham, but they were taken prisoner near Newport in Shropshire.

==Interregnum==

Lauderdale remained in confinement from his capture at Worcester until March 1660. He was exempted from Cromwell&#x27;s Act of Grace under which his estates were confiscated by Oliver Cromwell the Lord Protector. This was fortunate for him, because confiscated estates were restored to their owners, while land sales to pay fines were not reversed at the Restoration.

==Restoration==
Just before the restoration, he joined Charles II in May 1660 at Breda, the Netherlands, and in spite of the opposition of Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon and George Monck, was appointed Secretary of State for Scotland.

==King&#x27;s councillor==
From this time onwards he kept his hold upon the king, was lodged at Whitehall, was &quot;never from the king&#x27;s ear nor council&quot;, and maintained his position against his numerous adversaries by a crafty dexterity in dealing with men, a fearless unscrupulousness, and a robust strength of will, which overcame all opposition. Though a man of considerable learning and intellectual attainment, he was authoritarian and determined to implement the King&#x27;s instructions.

He abandoned Argyll to his fate, permitted, if he did not assist in, the restoration of episcopacy in Scotland, and after triumphing over all his opponents in Scotland drew into his own hands the whole administration of that kingdom, and proceeded to impose upon it the absolute supremacy of the crown in Kirk and state, restoring the nomination of the lords of the articles to the king and initiating severe measures against the Covenanters. In 1669 he was able to boast with truth that &quot;the king is now master here in all causes and over all persons&quot;.

==The Cabal Ministry==

His own power was now at its height, and his position as the favourite of Charles II, controlled by no considerations of patriotism or statesmanship, and completely independent of the English parliament, recalled the worst scandals and abuses of the Stuart administration before the English Civil War.

He was a member of the Cabal Ministry, but took little part in English affairs, and being a Presbyterian was not entrusted with the first secret Treaty of Dover, but gave personal support to Charles in his degrading demands for pensions from Louis XIV. On 2 May 1672 he was created Duke of Lauderdale and Earl of March, and on 3 June Knight of the Garter.

In 1673, on the resignation of James, Duke of York in consequence of the Test Act, he was appointed a Lord Commissioner of the Admiralty. In October he visited Scotland to suppress the dissenters and obtain money for the Third Anglo-Dutch War. The intrigues organised by Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury, against his power in his absence, and the attacks made upon him in the House of Commons in January 1674 and April 1675, were alike rendered futile by the steady support of Charles and James.

On 25 June 1674 he was created Earl of Guilford and Baron Petersham in the Peerage of England. His ferocious measures having failed to suppress the conventicles in Scotland, he summoned to his aid in 1677 a band of Highlanders, who were sent into the western country. In consequence, a large party of Scottish nobles went to London, made common cause with the English Country Faction, and compelled Charles to order the disbandment of the marauders. In May 1678 another demand made in the Commons for Lauderdale&#x27;s removal was defeated due to court influence, by a margin of only a single vote.

He maintained his triumphs almost to the end. In Scotland, which he visited immediately after this victory in the Parliament of England, he overbore all opposition to the king&#x27;s demands for money. Another address for his removal from the Commons in England was suppressed by the dissolution of parliament on 26 May 1679, and a renewed attack upon him, by the Scottish party and Shaftesbury&#x27;s faction combined, also failed. Later that summer on 22 June 1679 the last attempt of the Covenanters was suppressed at the Battle of Bothwell Brig.

==Resignation==
Following a stroke or heart attack early in 1680, his health and abilities failed leading Lauderdale to resign in October that year the place and power for which he had so long successfully struggled. His vote given for the execution of Lord Stafford on 29 November incurred the displeasure of the Duke of York.

==Personal life==

Lauderdale&#x27;s first marriage was to Lady Anne Home, daughter of Alexander Home, 1st Earl of Home and Mary (Dudley) Sutton, by whom he had one daughter, Mary who married John Hay, 2nd Marquess of Tweeddale.

In 1672, after his wife&#x27;s death in Paris he married Elizabeth, Countess of Dysart in her own right, daughter of William Murray, 1st Earl of Dysart, and now widow of Sir Lionel Tollemache. Among his stepchildren was General Thomas Tollemache. He left no male heir, consequently his dukedom and his English titles became extinct, but he was succeeded in the earldom by his brother Charles Maitland, 3rd Earl of Lauderdale.

<text>Charles Maitland, 3rd Earl of Lauderdale (c. 1620 – 9 June 1691), was the second son (&quot;The Great Seal of Scotland&quot; gives him as third son) of John Maitland, 1st Earl of Lauderdale (died 1645) and his wife Isabel Seton.

Maitland was born at Lethington in East Lothian. Following the death of his father-in-law, Richard Lauder of Haltoun, in November 1675, he formally adopted the territorial designation Charles Maitland of Haltoun, although he had the barony of Haltoun settled upon him &quot;in fee&quot; on 4 December 1660.

Shortly after the Restoration of King Charles II (4 December 1660), Charles Maitland was created sole Captain-General of The Mint for life, and appointed a Privy Counsellor 15 June 1661. He was elected one of the Commissioners for Edinburghshire and Lord of the Articles in the parliament of 1669. On the 1 (or 8) June 1670 he was admitted an Ordinary Lord and Senator of the College of Justice as Lord Haltoun. In February 1671, he succeeded Sir William Bellenden as Treasurer-Depute, and shortly afterwards, following the quarrel between the John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale and the Earl of Tweeddale, became his brother&#x27;s chief assistant in the management of Scottish affairs.

By charter of novodamus of 1676, later ratified by the Scots Parliament, King Charles II granted Charles Maitland, Lord Haltoun, &quot;the office of bearing our insignia within our said realm of Scotland&quot;. (But in 1952, the Lord Lyon decided that the Earl of Lauderdale&#x27;s right was to bear the saltire as the Bearer of the National Flag of Scotland, whereas the Earl of Dundee as the Bearer of the Royal Banner bears the Royal Standard of the &quot;lion rampant&quot;).

In a paper presented by the Duke of Hamilton to King Charles II in 1679, he detailed the grievances under which Scotland then suffered and complained that Lord Haltoun was &quot;overbearing and insolent in the extreme&quot;. Upon the fall of The Duke of Lauderdale, Lord Haltoun&#x27;s enemies began to attack him. He was, in July 1681, accused before parliament of perjury, the prosecution only halted by the adjournment of parliament. In November that year, a letter was procured from the King whereby he was deprived of the honour of presiding in Council, which, in the absence of the Lord Chancellor and Lord Privy Seal, it appears he had formerly enjoyed, and, at the same time, the accounts of the Treasury were ordered to be investigated.

In the same year, Maitland purchased Queensberry House in the Canongate from Margaret Douglas of Balmakellie after he was obliged to give up his &#x27;grace and favour&#x27; accommodation at the Palace of Holyrood House. He sold the mansion to William Douglas, 1st Duke of Queensberry in 1686.

In June 1682, a Commission, chiefly composed of his enemies, was appointed to inquire into the coinage and Mint, and, upon their report, he was deprived of his offices, and the Lord Advocate ordered to proceed against him, either civilly or criminally, for malversation. The case was tried in the Court of Session, which, on 20 March 1683, fined Sir John Falconer and him £72,000 sterling, a vast sum for the time. The King mitigated the penalty to £20,000 sterling, ordaining £16,000 to be paid to the Lord Chancellor, and £4000 to Graham of Claverhouse. The latter two disputed as to the division of the spoil, but at length Claverhouse obtained the lands of Dudhope and the Constabulary of Dundee, which procured him, in the following reign, the more honourable title by which history knows him.

Lord Haltoun succeeded his brother as Earl of Lauderdale in 1683, and was readmitted a Privy Counsellor on 11 March 1686.

Charles Maitland married, on 18 November 1652, Elizabeth, younger daughter of Richard Lauder of Haltoun, (nr. Ratho), Sheriff Principal for Edinburgh, &amp;c., the owner of Haltoun House and its lands, as well as extensive properties at Lauder, all of which passed to the Maitlands upon and after his marriage, Lauder&#x27;s elder daughter having been provided with a money dowry. By a very extensive charter in &quot;The Great Seal of Scotland&quot;, confirmed at Whitehall, London, on 4 December 1660, Charles Maitland and his heirs male by his marriage were bound to &quot;take the name of Lauder and bear the Arms of Lauder of Haltoun&quot;, which was done in accordance with the charter by John Maitland, Charles 2nd son, who received a baronetcy of Nova Scotia as Sir John Lauder. As provided in the charter, when Sir John inherited the Earldom of Lauderdale on the death of his elder brother Richard, he reverted to the surname of Maitland.

The third Earl of Lauderdale died at Haltoun House. He left six sons and two daughters, his eldest son and heir being Richard Maitland, 4th Earl of Lauderdale. Of his daughters: Isobel married John, 8th Lord Elphinstone, and Mary married Charles Carnegie, 4th Earl of Southesk.

<text>What&#x27;s Going On is the eleventh studio album by the American soul singer Marvin Gaye. It was released on May 21, 1971, by the Motown Records subsidiary label Tamla. Recorded between 1970 and 1971 in sessions at Hitsville U.S.A., Golden World, United Sound Studios in Detroit, and at The Sound Factory in West Hollywood, California, it was Gaye&#x27;s first album to credit him as producer and to credit Motown&#x27;s in-house session musicians, known as the Funk Brothers.

&quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot; is a concept album with most of its songs segueing into the next and has been categorized as a song cycle. The narrative established by the songs is told from the point of view of a Vietnam veteran returning to his home country to witness hatred, suffering, and injustice. Gaye&#x27;s introspective lyrics explore themes of drug abuse, poverty, and the Vietnam War. He has also been credited with promoting awareness of ecological issues before the public outcry over them had become prominent (&quot;Mercy Mercy Me&quot;).

&quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot; stayed on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs for over a year and became Gaye&#x27;s second number-one album on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Soul LPs chart, where it stayed for nine weeks, and on the No. 2 spot for another 12 weeks, respectively. The title track, which had been released in January 1971 as the album&#x27;s lead single, hit number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and held the top position on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Soul Singles chart five weeks running. The follow-up singles &quot;Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)&quot; and &quot;Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)&quot; also reached the top 10 of the Hot 100, making Gaye the first male solo artist to place three top ten singles on the Hot 100 from one album.

The album was an immediate commercial and critical success, and came to be viewed by music historians as a classic of 1970s soul. Multiple critics, musicians, and many in the general public consider &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot; to be one of the greatest albums of all time and a landmark recording in popular music. In 1985, writers on British music weekly the &quot;NME&quot; voted it the best album of all time. In 2020, it was ranked number one on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;.

==Background==

By the end of the 1960s, Marvin Gaye had fallen into a deep depression following the brain tumor diagnosis of his Motown singing partner Tammi Terrell, the failure of his marriage to Anna Gordy, a growing dependency on cocaine, troubles with the IRS, and struggles with Motown Records, the label he had signed with in 1961. One night, while holed up at a Detroit apartment, Gaye attempted suicide with a handgun, only to be stopped by Berry Gordy&#x27;s father.

Gaye started to experience more international success around this time as both a solo artist with hits such as &quot;I Heard It Through the Grapevine&quot; and &quot;Too Busy Thinking About My Baby&quot; and as a dual artist with Tammi Terrell, but Gaye said during this time that he felt he &quot;didn&#x27;t deserve&quot; his success and he felt like &quot;a puppet - Berry&#x27;s puppet, Anna&#x27;s puppet. I had a mind of my own and I wasn&#x27;t using it.&quot; In March 1970, Gaye&#x27;s singing partner Terrell died of a brain tumor. The singer responded to Terrell&#x27;s death by refusing to perform onstage for several years. In January 1970, Motown released Gaye&#x27;s next studio album, &quot;That&#x27;s the Way Love Is&quot;, but Gaye refused to promote the recording, choosing to stay at home. During this secluded period, Gaye ditched his previous clean-cut image to grow a beard, and preferred to wear sweatsuits instead of dress suits and sweaters.

The singer also got back in touch with his spirituality and also attended several concerts held by the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, which had been used for several Motown recordings in the 1960s. Around the spring of 1970, Gaye also began seriously pursuing a career in football with the professional football team the Detroit Lions of the NFL, even working out with the Eastern Michigan Eagles football team. However, his pursuit of a tryout was stopped after the owner of the team advised him that any future injury would derail his career. Gaye befriended three of the Lions teammates, Mel Farr, Charlie Sanders and Lem Barney, as well as then-Detroit Pistons star Dave Bing.

==Conception==

While traveling on his tour bus with the Four Tops on May 15, 1969, Four Tops member Renaldo &quot;Obie&quot; Benson witnessed an act of police brutality and violence committed on anti-war protesters who had been protesting at Berkeley&#x27;s People&#x27;s Park in what was later termed as &quot;Bloody Thursday&quot;. Benson later told author Ben Edmonds, &quot;I saw this and started wondering &#x27;what was going on, what is happening here?&#x27; One question led to another. Why are they sending kids far away from their families overseas? Why are they attacking their own kids in the street?&quot; Returning to Detroit, Motown songwriter Al Cleveland wrote and composed a song based on his conversations with Benson of what he had seen in Berkeley. Benson sent the song to the Four Tops but his bandmates turned the song down. Benson said, &quot;My partners told me it was a protest song. I said &#x27;no man, it&#x27;s a love song, about love and understanding. I&#x27;m not protesting. I want to know what&#x27;s going on.

Benson offered the song to Marvin Gaye when he participated in a golf game with the singer. Returning to Gaye&#x27;s home outside Outer Drive, Benson played the song to Gaye on his guitar. Gaye felt the song&#x27;s moody flow would be perfect for The Originals. Benson eventually convinced Gaye that it was his song. The singer responded by asking for partial writing credit, which Benson allowed. Gaye added new musical composition, a new melody and lyrics that reflected Gaye&#x27;s own disgust. Benson said later that Gaye tweaked and enriched the song, &quot;added some things that were more ghetto, more natural, which made it seem like a story and not a song ... we measured him for the suit and he tailored the hell out of it.&quot; During this time, Gaye had been deeply affected by letters shared between him and his brother after he had returned from service in the Vietnam War over the treatment of Vietnam veterans.

Gaye had also been deeply affected by the social ills plaguing the United States at the time, and covered the track &quot;Abraham, Martin &amp; John&quot;, in 1969, which became a UK hit for him in 1970. Gaye cited the 1965 Watts riots as a pivotal moment in his life in which he asked himself, &quot;with the world exploding around me, how am I supposed to keep singing love songs?&quot; One night, he called Berry Gordy about doing a protest record, to which Gordy chastised him, &quot;Marvin, don&#x27;t be ridiculous. That&#x27;s taking things too far.&quot; The singer&#x27;s brother Frankie wrote in his 2003 autobiography, &quot;My Brother Marvin&quot;, that while reuniting at their former childhood home in Washington, D.C., Frankie&#x27;s recalling of his tenure at the war made both brothers cry. At one point, Marvin sat propped up in a bed with his hands in his face. Afterwards, Gaye told his brother: &quot;I didn&#x27;t know how to fight before, but now I think I do. I just have to do it my way. I&#x27;m not a painter. I&#x27;m not a poet. But I can do it with music.&quot;

In an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Marvin Gaye discussed what had shaped his view on more socially conscious themes in music and the conception of his eleventh studio album:

==Recording==

On June 1, 1970, Gaye entered Motown&#x27;s Hitsville U.S.A. studios to record &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot;. Immediately after learning about the song, many of Motown&#x27;s musicians, known as The Funk Brothers noted that there was a different approach with Gaye&#x27;s record from that used on other Motown recordings, and Gaye complicated matters by bringing in only a few of the members while bringing his own recruits, including drummer Chet Forest. Longtime Funk Brothers members Jack Ashford, James Jamerson and Eddie Brown participated in the recording. Jamerson was pulled into the recording studio by Gaye after he located Jamerson playing with a local band at a blues bar and Eli Fontaine, the saxophonist behind &quot;Baby, I&#x27;m For Real&quot;, also participated in the recording. Jamerson, who could not sit properly on his seat after arriving to the session drunk, performed his bass riffs, written for him by the album&#x27;s arranger David Van De Pitte, on the floor. Fontaine&#x27;s alto saxophone riff to open the song was not originally intended. When Gaye heard the playback of what Fontaine thought was simply a demo, Gaye instantly decided that the riff was the ideal way to start the song. When Fontaine said he was &quot;just goofing around&quot;, Gaye being pleased with the results replied, &quot;Well, you goof off exquisitely. Thank you.&quot;

The laid-back sessions of the single were credited to lots of &quot;marijuana smoke and rounds of Scotch&quot;. Gaye&#x27;s trademark multi-layering vocal approach came off initially as an accident by engineers Steve Smith and Kenneth Sands. Sands later explained that Gaye had wanted him to bring him the two lead vocal takes for &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot; for advice on which one he should use for the final song. Smith and Sands accidentally mixed the two lead vocal takes together. Gaye loved the sound and decided to keep it and use it for the duration of the album.

That September, Gaye approached Gordy with the &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot; song while in California where Gordy had relocated. According to one account, Gordy disliked the song, allegedly calling it &quot;the worst thing I ever heard in my life&quot;. As a result, Gaye angrily responded to Gordy&#x27;s alleged putdown by going on strike until Gordy changed his mind. Gordy himself denied this claim, stating he loved the song&#x27;s jazzy feel but cautioned Gaye that the sound was out of date of the sound of the times and also feared the loss of Gaye&#x27;s crossover audience by releasing the political song. Gaye continued to record his own compositions during this time, some of which later made his 1973 album, &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It On&quot;. Motown executive Harry Balk recalled trying to get Gordy to release the song at the end of the year, to which Gordy replied to him, &quot;that Dizzy Gillespie stuff in the middle, that scatting, it&#x27;s old.&quot; Gordy mentioned later that he feared no one would buy songs with a jazz influence after his attempt to be a record store owner of a jazz shop folded after a year, years prior to starting Motown. Most of Motown&#x27;s Quality Control Department team also turned the song down, with Balk later stating that &quot;they were used to the &#x27;baby baby&#x27; stuff, and this was a little hard for them to grasp.&quot;

With the help of Motown sales executive Barney Ales, Harry Balk got the song released to record stores on January 20, 1971, sending 100,000 copies of the song without Gordy&#x27;s knowledge, with another 100,000 copies sent after that success. Upon its release, the song became a hit and was Motown&#x27;s fastest-selling single at the time, peaking at number 1 on the Hot Soul Singles Chart, and peaking at number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Stunned by the news, Gordy drove to Gaye&#x27;s home to discuss making a complete album, stating Gaye could do what he wanted with his music if he finished the record within 30 days before the end of March and thus effectively giving him the right to produce his own albums. Gaye returned to Hitsville to record the rest of &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot;, which took a mere ten business days between March 1 and March 10. The album&#x27;s rhythm tracks and sound overdubs were recorded at Hitsville, or Studio A, while the strings, horns, lead and background vocals were recorded at Golden World, or Studio B.

The album&#x27;s original mix, recorded in Detroit at both Hitsville and Golden World as well as United Sound Studios, was finalized on April 5, 1971. When Gordy listened to the mix, he worried that no other hit single would emerge from it. To ease Gordy&#x27;s worries, Gaye and the album&#x27;s engineers entered The Sound Factory in West Hollywood in early May, integrating the orchestra somewhat closer with the rhythm tracks, while Gaye used different vocal tracks and added extra instrumentation. Presented to Motown&#x27;s Quality Control department team, they were worried about future hit singles due to its concurrent style with each song leading to the next. Gordy however vetoed their decision, agreeing to put this mix of the album out that month.

==Music and lyrics==

&quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot;, the title track, features soulful, passionate vocals and multi-tracked background singing, both by Gaye. The song had strong jazz, gospel, classical music orchestration, and arrangements. Reviewer Eric Henderson of Slant stated the song had an &quot;understandably mournful tone&quot; in response to the fallout of the late 1960s counterculture movements. Henderson also wrote that &quot;Gaye&#x27;s choice to emphasize humanity at its most charitable rather than paint bleak pictures of destruction and disillusionment is characteristic of the album that follows.&quot;

This is immediately followed in segue flow by the second track, &quot;What&#x27;s Happening Brother&quot;, a song Gaye dedicated to his brother Frankie, in which Gaye wrote to explain the disillusionment of war veterans who returned to civilian life and their disconnect from pop culture. &quot;Flyin&#x27; High (In the Friendly Sky)&quot;, which took its title from a United Airlines tag, &quot;fly the friendly skies&quot;, dealt with dependence on heroin. The lyric, &quot;I know, I&#x27;m hooked my friend, to the boy, who makes slaves out of men&quot;, references heroin as &quot;boy&quot;, which was slang for the drug. &quot;Save the Children&quot; was an emotional plea to help disadvantaged children, warning, &quot;who really cares/who&#x27;s willing to try/to save a world/that is destined to die?&quot;, later crying out, &quot;save the babies&quot;. A truncated version of &quot;God Is Love&quot; follows &quot;Save the Children&quot; and makes references to God.

&quot;Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)&quot; was another emotional plea, this time for the environment. Motown legend, musician and Funk Brothers leader Earl Van Dyke once mentioned that Berry Gordy didn&#x27;t know of the word &quot;ecology&quot; and had to be told what it was, though Gordy claimed otherwise. The song featured a memorable tenor saxophone solo from Detroit music legend Wild Bill Moore. &quot;Right On&quot; was a seven-minute jam influenced by funk rock and Latin soul rhythms that focused on Gaye&#x27;s own divided soul in which Gaye later pleaded in falsetto, &quot;if you let me, I will take you to live where love is King&quot; after complying that &quot;true love can conquer hate every time&quot;. &quot;Wholy Holy&quot; follows &quot;God Is Love&quot; as an emotional gospel plea advising people to &quot;come together&quot; to &quot;proclaim love [as our] salvation&quot;. The final track, &quot;Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)&quot;, focuses on urban poverty, backed by a minimalist, dark blues-oriented funk vibe, with its bass riffs composed and performed by Bob Babbitt, who also performed on &quot;Mercy Mercy Me&quot;. The entire album&#x27;s stylistic use of a song cycle gave it a cohesive feel and was one of R&amp;B&#x27;s first concept albums, described as &quot;a groundbreaking experiment in collating a pseudo-classical suite of free-flowing songs.&quot;

David Hepworth described the album as &quot;like a jazz record not merely because it had jazz manners and was slathered in strings and employed congas and triangle as its most prominent form of percussion...But it&#x27;s also jazz in the sense that...[i]t plays like one long single.&quot;

The Absolute Sound described the album as &quot;a brilliant psychedelic soul song-cycle&quot;.

== Release and promotion ==
Released on May 21, 1971, &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot; shipped gold upon its release and became Gaye&#x27;s first Top 10 entry on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs, peaking at number six. It stayed on the chart over a year, selling some two million copies within twelve months. It was Motown&#x27;s (and Gaye&#x27;s) best-selling album to that date – until he released &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It On&quot; in 1973. It also became Gaye&#x27;s second number-one album on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Soul LPs chart, where it stayed for nine weeks, remaining on the Billboard Soul LPs chart for 58 weeks throughout 1971 and 1972. The title track, which had been released in January 1971 as the lead single to promote the album, sold more than 200,000 copies within its first week and two-and-a-half-million by the end of the year. It hit number 1 in &quot;Record World&quot;, number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 (behind Three Dog Night&#x27;s &quot;Joy to the World&quot;), number 1 on the &quot;Cash Box&quot; Top 100, and held the pole position on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Soul Singles chart five weeks running.

The follow-up single, &quot;Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)&quot;, peaked at number-four on the Hot 100, and also went number-one on the R&amp;B chart. The third, and final, single, &quot;Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)&quot;, peaked at number-nine on the Hot 100, while also rising to number-one on the R&amp;B chart, thus making Gaye the first male solo artist to place three top ten singles on the Hot 100 off one album, as well as the first artist to place three singles at number one on any &quot;Billboard&quot; chart (in this case, R&amp;B), off one single album. The album had a modest commercial reception in countries such as Canada and the United Kingdom; &quot;Save the Children&quot; reached number 41 on the latter country&#x27;s singles chart, while the album, 25 years after its original release, reached number 56. In 1984, the album re-entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 following Gaye&#x27;s untimely death. In 1994, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in the United States for sales of half a million copies after it was issued on CD. It was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry for shipments of 300,000 albums.

Six months after the release of &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot;, Sly and the Family Stone released &quot;There&#x27;s a Riot Goin&#x27; On&quot; (1971), titled in response to Gaye&#x27;s album.

==Critical reception==
&quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot; was generally well received by contemporary critics. Writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1971, Vince Aletti praised Gaye&#x27;s thematic approach towards social and political concerns, while discussing the surprise of Motown releasing such an album. In a joint review of &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot; and Stevie Wonder&#x27;s &quot;Where I&#x27;m Coming From&quot;, Aletti wrote, &quot;Ambitious, personal albums may be a glut on the market elsewhere, but at Motown they&#x27;re something new ... the album as a whole takes precedence, absorbing its own flaws. There are very few performers who could carry a project like this off. I&#x27;ve always admired Marvin Gaye, but I didn&#x27;t expect that he would be one of them. Guess I seriously underestimated him. It won&#x27;t happen again.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; described the record as &quot;a cross between Curtis Mayfield and that old Motown spell and outdoes anything Gaye&#x27;s ever done&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; magazine hailed it as a &quot;vast, melodically deft symphonic pop suite&quot;. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau was less impressed. Writing in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), he deemed it both a &quot;groundbreaking personal statement&quot; and a Berry Gordy product, baited by three highly original singles but marred elsewhere by indistinct music and indulgent use of David Van De Pitte&#x27;s strings, which Christgau called &quot;the lowest kind of movie-background dreck&quot;.

According to Paul Gambaccini, Gaye&#x27;s death in 1984 prompted a critical re-evaluation of the album, and most reviewers have since regarded it as an important masterpiece of popular music. In &quot;MusicHound R&amp;B&quot; (1998), Gary Graff said &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot; was &quot;not just a great Gaye album but is one of the great pop albums of all time&quot;, and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; later credited the album for having &quot;revolutionized black music&quot;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; critic Geoffrey Himes names it an exemplary release of the progressive soul development from 1968 to 1973, and &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Tom Breihan calls it a prog-soul masterpiece. BBC Music&#x27;s David Katz described the album as &quot;one of the greatest albums of all time, and nothing short of a masterpiece&quot; and compared it to Miles Davis&#x27;s &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; by saying &quot;its non-standard musical arrangements, which heralded a new sound at the time, gives it a chilling edge that ultimately underscores its gravity, with subtle orchestral enhancements offset by percolating congas, expertly layered above James Jamerson&#x27;s bubbling bass&quot;. In his 1994 review of Gaye&#x27;s re-issues, &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; reviewer Greg Kot described the album as &quot;soul music&#x27;s first &#x27;art&#x27; album, an inner-city response to the Celtic mysticism of Van Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Astral Weeks&quot;, the psychedelic pop of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; [and] the rewired blues of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot;.&quot; Richie Unterberger found the album somewhat overrated, writing in &quot;The Rough Guide to Rock&quot; (2003) that much of its &quot;meandering introspection&quot; paled in comparison to its three singles.

A remastered deluxe edition with 28 additional tracks was released on May 31, 2011, to similar acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 100, based on ten reviews.

===Accolades===
In 1985, writers on British music weekly the &quot;NME&quot; voted it the best album of all time. &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1998. The album&#x27;s title track was ranked number four on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time in the original 2004 ranking and the 2010 revision. The publication ranked the song number six on its updated 2021 list and its 2024 revision, and in 2025, it ranked the song at number 15 on its list of &quot;The 100 Best Protest Songs of All Time.&quot; A 1999 critics&#x27; poll conducted by British newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; named it the &quot;Greatest Album of the 20th Century&quot;. In 1997, &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot; was named the 17th greatest album of all time in a poll conducted in the United Kingdom by HMV Group, Channel 4, &quot;The Guardian&quot; and Classic FM. In 1997, &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked the album number one on its list of the 100 Best Albums Ever. In 1998 &quot;Q&quot; magazine readers placed it at number 97, while in 2001 the TV network VH1 placed it at number 4. In 2003, it was one of 50 recordings chosen that year by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry. &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot; was ranked number 6 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2003 list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, one of three Gaye albums to be included, succeeded by 1973&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It On&quot; (number 165) and 1978&#x27;s &quot;Here, My Dear&quot; (number 462). The album is Gaye&#x27;s highest-ranking entry on the list, as well as several other publications&#x27; lists. In a revised 2020 list, this time voted on by musicians instead of music critics, the album moved up to the top spot, replacing the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;.

<text>James Francis Dorsey (February 29, 1904 – June 12, 1957) was an American jazz clarinetist, saxophonist, composer and big band leader. He recorded and composed the jazz and pop standards &quot;I&#x27;m Glad There Is You (In This World of Ordinary People)&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s the Dreamer in Me&quot;. His other major recordings were &quot;Tailspin&quot;, &quot;John Silver&quot;, &quot;So Many Times&quot;, &quot;Amapola&quot;, &quot;Brazil (Aquarela do Brasil)&quot;, &quot;Pennies from Heaven&quot; with Bing Crosby, Louis Armstrong, and Frances Langford, &quot;Grand Central Getaway&quot;, and &quot;So Rare&quot;. He played clarinet on the seminal jazz standards &quot;Singin&#x27; the Blues&quot; in 1927 and the original 1930 recording of &quot;Georgia on My Mind&quot;, which were inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Jimmy Dorsey was born in Shenandoah, Pennsylvania, United States, the first son of Theresa Langton Dorsey and Thomas Francis Dorsey. His father, Thomas, was initially a coal miner, but would later become a music teacher and marching-band director. Both Jimmy and his younger brother, Tommy Dorsey, were musically active during their childhoods and by the age of seven, Jimmy was already playing with his father&#x27;s band. He made his first public appearance at the age of 9 while playing trumpet with J. Carson McGee&#x27;s King Trumpeters in New York in 1913. He switched to alto saxophone in 1915, and then learned clarinet. Jimmy Dorsey played on a clarinet outfitted with the Albert system of fingering, as opposed to the more common Boehm system used by most of his contemporaries including Benny Goodman and Artie Shaw.

With his brother Tommy playing trombone, they formed Dorsey&#x27;s Novelty Six, later called Dorsey&#x27;s Wild Canaries, one of the first jazz bands to broadcast. In 1924 he joined the California Ramblers (who were based in New York City). He did much freelance radio and recording work throughout the 1920s. The brothers also appeared as session musicians on many jazz recordings. He joined Ted Lewis&#x27;s band in 1930, with whom he toured Europe. The same year, he played clarinet on the iconic jazz standard &quot;Georgia on My Mind&quot; in 1930 with Hoagy Carmichael and His Orchestra which featured Bix Beiderbecke on cornet. Dorsey married Jane Porter in 1928, and they had one daughter, Julia. Jane Porter and Dorsey divorced in 1949.

== Career ==
During his early days as a musician, Jimmy Dorsey performed with various ensembles and artists, including the Scranton Sirens, The California Ramblers, Red Nichols, Jean Goldkette, Frankie Trumbauer, Ben Pollack, and Paul Whiteman. He played the clarinet solo on the iconic 1927 jazz standard &quot;Singin&#x27; the Blues&quot;, with the Frankie Trumbauer Orchestra featuring Bix Beiderbecke (which would, a half-century later, be inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame). After returning to the United States from his European tour, he worked briefly with Rudy Vallee, and with several other bandleaders; and likewise with his brother Tommy—including starting their famed eponymous band. He appeared on at least seventy-five radio broadcasts, many of them with his brother. He was a member of Nathaniel Shilkret&#x27;s orchestra, on programs such as (starting in 1937) &quot;The Music That Satisfies&quot; (also known as the Chesterfield Quarter Hour).
Glenn Miller arranged and played trombone on several early sessions that he and his brother Tommy did together for OKeh Records, including &quot;The Spell of the Blues&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Do It&quot;, and &quot;My Kinda Love&quot;—all with Bing Crosby on vocals.

In 1927, the brothers created the Dorsey Brothers Orchestra and signed with Okeh Records. For some of their sessions, Glenn Miller would join them as trombonist, arranger, and composer; composing &quot;Annie&#x27;s Cousin Fanny&quot;, &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Another Day&quot;, &quot;Harlem Chapel Chimes&quot;, and &quot;Dese Dem Dose&quot;. Their first song to chart was &quot;Coquette&quot; with vocals from Bill Dutton in June, 1928. Their song, &quot;Let&#x27;s Do It (Let&#x27;s Fall in Love)&quot; with vocals by Bing Crosby, was their first to reach the top ten charts. Despite their success, the brothers frequently disagreed over management of the band and their conflict would come to a head in May 1935 when, after an onstage disagreement, Tommy stormed off. Afterward, Jimmy continued the band, keeping the Dorsey Brothers name in hopes his younger brother would return; in September 1935, the Dorsey Brothers band became &quot;Jimmy Dorsey and His Orchestra&quot;, and he signed with Decca Records. In December, 1935 Dorsey&#x27;s first song with the band, &quot;You Let me Down&quot;, would reach the charts. For the next two years, Jimmy Dorsey and His Orchestra would provide accompaniment for Bing Crosby&#x27;s &quot;Kraft Music Hall&quot; radio show. The band was featured on 73 programs, from December 1935 to July 1937; they also backed Crosby on his commercial recordings during this time. In 1936, Bing Crosby released the single &quot;Pennies from Heaven&quot; recorded with the Jimmy Dorsey Orchestra on Decca Records. The early band was considered more jazz-oriented than his brother&#x27;s, and in response the band recorded instrumental swing classics: &quot;Dorsey Stomp,&quot; &quot;Tap Dancer&#x27;s Nightmare,&quot; &quot;Parade of the Milk Bottle Caps,&quot; &quot;John Silver&quot; and &quot;Dusk in Upper Sandusky,&quot; and included musicians such as Bobby Byrne, Ray McKinley, Donald Matteson and Skeets Herfurt along with vocalists Bob Eberly and Kay Weber.

Dorsey left Crosby in 1937, to concentrate on his own career, and he did well commercially, although he was overshadowed by Benny Goodman, whose big band had &quot;grabbed center stage&quot; in the mid-1930s. Dorsey&#x27;s main vocalist was Bob Eberly, considered to be the best in the music business, and in 1939, Helen O&#x27;Connell joined the band, and the idea to have them perform duets proved to be highly successful. She and Bob Eberly possessed a &quot;boy and girl next door&quot; charm, and their pairing produced several of the band&#x27;s biggest hits. Many of the Eberly-O&#x27;Connell recordings were arranged in an unusual 3-section &quot;a-b-c&quot; format. This format was reportedly developed at the insistence of a record producer (then called an A&amp;R executive) who wanted to feature both singers and the full band in a single 3-minute 78 rpm recording. Eberly sang the first minute, usually as a slow romantic ballad, the next minute featured the full band backing Jimmy&#x27;s saxophone, and the last minute was sung by O&#x27;Connell in a more up-tempo style, sometimes with lyrics in Spanish. Almost every record released during 1939–1943 were hits, but especially their Latin American stylized songs like &quot;Amapola&quot;, &quot;Maria Elena&quot;, and &quot;Green Eyes&quot;, which topped the charts in 1941. They continued singing with his band for future records and motion picture appearances. Kitty Kallen sang with the Jimmy Dorsey orchestra following Helen O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s departure in 1942. Jerry Lewis&#x27; first wife Patti Palmer (birth name Esther Calonico) was a singer with his orchestra for less than a year, starting about 1944. Despite personnel changes, Jimmy remained one of the top big band leaders after World War II and into the 1950s, always updating the sound of his band, but the big band business was beginning to decline. Dorsey employed pianist and arranger Joe Lipman in 1939 (who had just left Bunny Berigan); he contributed heavily to the repertoire of the band and success of the recordings through the next three years.

Jimmy and Tommy Dorsey reunited on March 15, 1945, to record a V-Disc at Liederkranz Hall in New York City. Released in June 1945, V-Disc 451 featured &quot;More Than You Know&quot; backed with &quot;Brotherly Jump&quot;. The songs featured the combined orchestras of Jimmy and Tommy Dorsey. In 1947, Jimmy signed with MGM Records and in the same year, the brothers would put aside their tensions to film &quot;The Fabulous Dorseys.&quot; The film was a look inside the brothers&#x27; lives from practicing as children, to making it big as adults; the brothers played themselves in the film. It also highlighted their struggles leading the Dorsey Brothers Orchestra and showed what their lives were like on the road. Despite the brothers coming together for the movie, Jimmy continued to lead his own band until the early 1950s. In 1950, Jimmy moved to Columbia Records and his brother offered him a seat in the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra.

In 1953, Tommy and Jimmy would rename the band, the &quot;Dorsey Brothers Orchestra.&quot; Tommy was the leader of the group, and made Jimmy both the co-leader and featured soloist. On December 26, 1953, the brothers and their orchestra appeared on Jackie Gleason&#x27;s CBS television program. The success of that television appearance led Gleason to produce a weekly variety program, &quot;Stage Show&quot;, hosted by the brothers on CBS from 1954 to 1956. The show gave other big band leaders hope in a business that was steadily declining for them. In January 1956, the &quot;Stage Show&quot; made history with the network television debut of Elvis Presley. Promoting his early recordings for RCA Victor, Presley made a total of six guest appearances. Competitive ratings from NBC&#x27;s popular Perry Como Show forced &quot;Stage Show&quot; into early cancellation.

In 1956, after Tommy Dorsey died from choking in his sleep, Jimmy took over leadership of the orchestra. Around that same time, Jimmy was diagnosed with throat cancer. He died on June 12, 1957, at age 53 in New York City. Broadcasts of Jimmy Dorsey and The Fabulous Dorsey Orchestra on &quot;NBC Bandstand&quot; survive from December 24-28, 1956, and December 31, 1956-January 1, 1957. At least two other extant broadcasts from the month of December 1956 are available. Recordings of the band from their winter 1957 tour have not surfaced. These recordings would provide the last aural evidence of Jimmy Dorsey&#x27;s work, which otherwise is the &quot;NBC Bandstand&quot; broadcast from January 1, 1957. It was once thought that Dorsey&#x27;s last appearance was in Joplin, Missouri, on March 12, 1957; but, he did lead the band starting on March 19, 1957, at the Roseland Ballroom, for less than a week before traveling to Florida, as his health was failing rapidly. 

At the time of his death, Jimmy&#x27;s final hit song, &quot;So Rare&quot;, reached the number-two spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, becoming the highest-charting song by a big band during the first decade of the rock-and-roll era. With an arrangement heavily influenced by R&amp;B saxophonist Earl Bostic, it marked Dorsey&#x27;s attempt to acknowledge rock music and marked a significant departure from his earlier work. This final recording sold 500,000 copies and earned him a gold record.

Jimmy Dorsey is considered one of the most important and influential alto saxophone players of the Big Band and Swing era, and also after that era. Jazz saxophonists Lester Young and Charlie Parker both acknowledge him as an important influence on their styles.

==Movie appearances and filmography==
Dorsey appeared in a number of Hollywood motion pictures, including &quot;That Girl From Paris&quot;, &quot;Shall We Dance&quot;, &quot;The Fleet&#x27;s In&quot;, &quot;Lost in a Harem&quot; with Abbott and Costello, &quot;I Dood It&quot;, and the bio-pic with his brother Tommy, &quot;The Fabulous Dorseys&quot; in 1947.

In 1938, Jimmy Dorsey and His Orchestra also appeared in a movie short performing many of his hits including &quot;It&#x27;s the Dreamer in Me&quot;, &quot;I Love You in Technicolor&quot;, and &quot;Parade of the Milk Bottle Caps&quot;.

Mertz had been a pianist with the Jean Goldkette orchestra in the 1920s and had worked in Hollywood. Sung by Dorsey vocalist Bob Eberly, it was released on Decca as 4197B in 1942. It was also released on Decca 18799A with Dee Parker in 1946.

<doc id="194617" wikidata="Q945926" url="?curid=194617" title="The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill">
<text>The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill is the debut solo studio album by American rapper and singer Lauryn Hill. It was released on August 19, 1998, by Ruffhouse Records and Columbia Records. Recorded after the Fugees embarked on a hiatus, the album was almost entirely written and produced by Hill. It is a concept album about educating oneself on love, with lyrical themes encompassing relationship complexities, interpersonal conflicts, motherhood, and faith. Predominantly a neo soul and R&amp;B record, it incorporates genres such as hip-hop, reggae, and soul, and features guest appearances from Carlos Santana, Mary J. Blige, and D&#x27;Angelo.

After touring with the Fugees, Hill became involved in a romantic relationship with Jamaican entrepreneur Rohan Marley, and shortly after, became pregnant with their first child. The pregnancy, as well as other circumstances in her life, inspired Hill to create a solo album. Recording sessions for &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; took place from September 1997 to June 1998, initially in New York and New Jersey, before relocating to the Tuff Gong Studios in Kingston, as Hill collaborated with a group of musicians known as New Ark in writing and producing the songs. Gordon &quot;Commissioner Gordon&quot; Williams supervised the project, while Che Pope and James Poyser also contributed to a majority of the tracks. Hill strived to differentiate her musical style from that of the Fugees, and wrote songs discussing the turmoil within the group. As she refrained from following mainstream music trends and sounding overproduced, live instruments were heavily incorporated into the recordings.

&quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; was met with universal critical acclaim and became one of the most acclaimed albums of 1998, with most praise directed towards Hill&#x27;s presentation of a woman&#x27;s view on life and love, and her artistic range. A substantial commercial success, the album debuted atop the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, with first-week sales of 422,000 copies, largest for a female artist at the time. At the 41st Annual Grammy Awards (1999), it won Album of the Year and Best R&amp;B Album, while Hill broke records for most nominations and wins in a single ceremony for a woman. The album produced three singles—&quot;Doo Wop (That Thing)&quot;, which peaked atop the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and broke numerous chart records; &quot;Ex-Factor&quot;, and &quot;Everything Is Everything&quot;. Hill further promoted the record with multiple televised performances and a sold-out worldwide concert tour; since 2018, she has also embarked on two anniversary world tours.

The success of &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; propelled Hill to global prominence, and contributed to bringing hip-hop and neo soul to the forefront of popular music. New Ark, however, felt Hill and her record labels did not properly credit them for their contributions, and filed a lawsuit, which was settled out of court in 2001. Regardless of the controversy, various critics have exalted the album as one of the best of its era and of all time, due to its tremendous influence on other artists and ubiquitous impact on the music industry; the album was ranked atop Apple Music&#x27;s 100 Best Albums. In addition, it has been selected for inclusion at a multitude of cultural institutions, including the Library of Congress, the Smithsonian, and the Grammy Hall of Fame. The album eventually went on to be certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for 10 million units consumed in the US. With over 20 million copies sold worldwide, &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; is among the best-selling albums of all time. Despite its immense success and achievements, it remains Hill&#x27;s sole studio album.

==Background and development==

In 1996, Lauryn Hill met Rohan Marley, son of Bob Marley, while touring as a member of the Fugees, in support of their widely successful second studio album &quot;The Score&quot;. Hill and Marley gradually formed a close relationship, and during the tour, Hill became pregnant with his child. After contributing to fellow Fugees member Wyclef Jean&#x27;s solo debut &quot;Wyclef Jean Presents The Carnival&quot; (1997), Hill refrained from touring and recording due to her pregnancy and cases of writer&#x27;s block. However, circumstances in her life stimulated her to record a solo album, having already expressed the desire to do so and depart from the Fugees. She credited her pregnancy for rejuvenating her songwriting; according to her then-manager Jayson Jackson, the songwriting was prompted by Wendy Williams revealing Hill&#x27;s pregnancy on her radio show and the intense media scrutiny over the identity of the child&#x27;s father, as Hill had never publicized her relationship with Marley prior to the pregnancy.

Of the early writing process, Hill said: &quot;Every time I got hurt, every time I was disappointed, every time I learned, I just wrote a song.&quot; While inspired, Hill wrote over 30 songs in her attic studio in South Orange, New Jersey. Many of these songs drew upon the turbulence in the Fugees, as well as past love experiences. In the summer of 1997, as Hill was due to give birth to her first child, she was requested to write a song for gospel musician CeCe Winans. Several months later, she went to Detroit to work with soul singer Aretha Franklin, writing and producing her single &quot;A Rose Is Still a Rose&quot;. Franklin would later have Hill direct the song&#x27;s music video. Shortly after this, Hill did writing work for Whitney Houston. Having written songs for artists in gospel, hip-hop, and R&amp;B, she drew on these influences and experiences to record &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot;.

==Recording and production==

Hill began recording &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; in September 1997 at the Chung King Studios in New York City. In an interview, Hill described the first day of recording: &quot;The first day in the studio I ordered every instrument I ever fell in love with: harps, strings, timpani, organs, clarinets. It was my idea to record it so the human element stayed in. I didn&#x27;t want it to be too technically perfect.&quot; Furthermore, she herself played the guitar on &quot;Superstar&quot;. Gordon &quot;Commissioner Gordon&quot; Williams, who engineered most of the record, acted as the project supervisor. Initially, Wyclef Jean did not support Hill recording a solo album, but eventually offered to help as a producer, which she rejected. Columbia Records considered bringing in an outside producer for the album and had early talks with RZA of Wu-Tang Clan. However, Hill was adamant about writing, arranging, and producing the album herself, with Ruffhouse Records executive Chris Swartz ensuring her artistic freedom while recording the album. She formed a team of collaborators named New Ark, composed of programmer Vada Nobles, songwriter Rasheem Pugh, pianist Tejumold Newton, and guitarist Johari Newton. Two of the earliest recordings Hill and New Ark worked on—&quot;Ex-Factor&quot; and &quot;Loved Real Hard Once&quot;, which was later retitled &quot;When It Hurts So Bad&quot;—were originally intended for other artists, before being retained due to their personal content. Che Pope was credited as a co-producer of &quot;Lost Ones&quot; and &quot;To Zion&quot;, under his pseudonym Che Guevara. He revealed he produced &quot;To Zion&quot; in a small studio apartment in Brooklyn in 20 minutes, and Hill subsequently recorded it at Chung King and the Perfect Pair Studios in East Orange, New Jersey. John Legend, then an obscure artist, played the piano on &quot;Everything Is Everything&quot;, which marked his commercial debut.

Throughout most of the initial sessions, Hill simultaneously recorded at multiple locations throughout New York City and New Jersey; even parts of a single song were recorded at multiple studios. Furthermore, &quot;Final Hour&quot; was partly recorded at the Metropolis Studio in London. The majority of &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot;, however, was recorded at Tuff Gong, the studio built by Bob Marley, in Kingston, Jamaica, where the album would be completed in June 1998. Regarding the shift in environment, Hill stated: &quot;When I started recording in New York and New Jersey, lots of people were talking to me about going different routes. I could feel people up in my face, and I was picking up on bad vibes. I wanted a place where there was good vibes, where I was among family, and it was Tuff Gong.&quot; Numerous members of the Marley family were present in the studio during the recording sessions, among them Julian Marley, who contributed with guitar elements to &quot;Forgive Them Father&quot;. In an interview, Williams recalled the recording of &quot;Lost Ones&quot;, stating: &quot;It was our first morning in Jamaica and I saw all of these kids gathered around Lauryn, screaming and dancing. Lauryn was in the living room next to the studio with about fifteen Marley grandchildren around her, the children of Ziggy, and Stephen, and Julian, and she starts singing this rap verse, and all the kids start repeating the last word of each line, chiming in very spontaneously because they were so into the song.&quot;

Inspired by Sonny Carson&#x27;s autobiographical novel &quot;The Education of Sonny Carson&quot; and its 1974 film adaptation, Hill originally wanted to title the album after it. However, her collaborators urged a more &quot;self-deprecating&quot; title, in reference to Carter G. Woodson&#x27;s 1933 book &quot;The Mis-Education of the Negro&quot;, hence devising the title &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot;.

===Lawsuit===
Though &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; was largely a collaborative work between Hill and New Ark, there was &quot;label pressure to do the Prince thing&quot;, wherein all tracks would be credited as written and produced by the artist with little outside help. While recording the album, Hill was against the idea of creating documentation defining each musician&#x27;s role.

In November 1998, New Ark filed a 50-page lawsuit against Hill, her management and her record label, stating that Hill &quot;used their songs and production skills, but failed to properly credit them for the work.&quot; New Ark demanded writing and/or production credits for 13 of the album&#x27;s 14 tracks, excluding &quot;To Zion&quot;, alongside monetary reimbursement. The musicians claimed to be primary songwriters of &quot;Nothing Even Matters&quot; and &quot;Everything Is Everything&quot;, and major contributors on others, though Williams described the project as a &quot;powerfully personal effort by Hill ... It was definitely her vision.&quot; Audio engineer Tony Prendatt, who also worked on the album, defended Hill, with a statement saying &quot;Lauryn&#x27;s genius is her own&quot;. In response to the lawsuit, Hill claimed that New Ark took advantage of her success. The suit was eventually settled out of court in February 2001, for a reported $5 million. While Pope was not involved in the lawsuit, he claimed he solely produced &quot;To Zion&quot;, despite being merely credited as a co-producer, and contemplated filing a lawsuit of his own but ultimately abandoned the idea.

==Music and lyrics==
&quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; is predominantly considered a neo soul and R&amp;B album. Its musical styles emerge from genres such as soul, hip-hop, and reggae, with some songs based in hip-hop soul. Hill said that she &quot;didn&#x27;t want to come out with a [Fugees] type of sound&quot;, but create &quot;something that was uniquely and very clearly a Lauryn Hill album.&quot; She also said that she did not intend for the album&#x27;s sound to be commercially appealing: &quot;There&#x27;s too much pressure to have hits these days. Artists are watching &quot;Billboard&quot; instead of exploring themselves. Look at someone like Aretha, she didn&#x27;t hit with her first album, but she was able to grow up and find herself. I wanted to make honest music. I don&#x27;t like things to be too perfect, or too polished. People may criticize me for that, but I grew up listening to Al Green and Sam Cooke. When they hit a high note, you actually felt it.&quot; Much of Hill&#x27;s lyrics dealt with motherhood, the Fugees, reminiscence, love, heartbreak, and God, with multiple critics characterizing the album as a progressive rap work due to its lyricism. Commenting on the album&#x27;s gospel content, Hill revealed that she frequently read the Bible, from which she sought inspiration. Meanwhile, tracks such as &quot;Lost Ones&quot;, &quot;Ex-Factor&quot;, &quot;Superstar&quot;, and &quot;Forgive Them Father&quot; were widely speculated as direct attacks at fellow Fugees members Jean and Pras. While mostly in English, &quot;Lost Ones&quot; and &quot;Forgive Them Father&quot; both feature singing and rapping in patois, the common dialect in Jamaica. Biographer Chris Nickson accentuated Hill&#x27;s vocal progression since &quot;The Score&quot;, both through the expansion of her range and her acquired musical versatility, specifically on &quot;To Zion&quot;, &quot;When It Hurts So Bad&quot;, and &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot;, which author Kathy Iandoli attributed to Hill&#x27;s pregnancy.
Throughout &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot;, several interludes of a teacher, speaking to what is implied to be a classroom of children, are played. The teacher was portrayed by American poet and politician Ras Baraka, who was recorded speaking to a group of children in the living room of Hill&#x27;s New Jersey home. Hill requested that Baraka speak to the children about the concept of love, to which he improvised in the lecture. In a retrospective analysis, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; writer Carvell Wallace observed Hill educating herself on different kinds of love—love of God through love of her child on &quot;To Zion&quot;, love of others and its nuisances on &quot;When It Hurts So Bad&quot;, and ultimately love of self on the title track. Regarding the influence of &quot;The Mis-Education of the Negro&quot;, Hill &quot;adopts Woodson&#x27;s thesis and makes it part of her own artistic process. Like the songs themselves, the intro/outro classroom scenes suggest a larger community working to redefine itself.&quot; 

===Songs===
&quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; opens with a spoken-word intro, featuring Baraka as the teacher taking attendance, with Hill as the sole student absent from the class. &quot;Lost Ones&quot; fuses hip-hop with reggae, and is built on tight snares embellished with spirited toasting and scratching. Its hook interpolates Sister Nancy&#x27;s &quot;Bam Bam&quot;. Despite its sound, Hill defined the song as a gospel track due to its lyrical content, which centers on the concept of karma. While &quot;Lost Ones&quot; discusses the dissolution of Hill&#x27;s business relationship with Jean, &quot;Ex-Factor&quot; addresses the end of their personal one. A 1960s-influenced soul track received comparisons to Minnie Riperton and Aretha Franklin. It replays elements of Wu-Tang Clan&#x27;s &quot;Can It Be All So Simple&quot;, and ends with a guitar solo by Johari Newton. &quot;To Zion&quot;, among the more introspective tracks on the album, spoke about how Hill&#x27;s family comes before her career, and her decision to have her first child, even though many at the time encouraged her to terminate the pregnancy, so as not to conflict with her burgeoning career. Featuring Carlos Santana, it is an acoustic Spanish guitar-driven hip-hop track. Musically a &quot;short trip through black music&quot;, &quot;Doo Wop (That Thing)&quot; fuses doo-wop harmonies, soul horns, contemporary hip-hop, and turntable work before transitioning into an R&amp;B-styled chorus. Lyrically, it advises women to value themselves by not engaging in relationships with deceitful men, or succumbing to superficial trends, while criticizing men attempting to portray a false lifestyle of affluence and power.
Although a track intertwining R&amp;B, hip-hop, and soul, &quot;Superstar&quot; contains an interpolation of the rock song &quot;Light My Fire&quot; by The Doors, against a percussion, harpsichord and harp-driven background. The flute-accompanied jazz and hip-hop track &quot;Final Hour&quot; cautions against hedonistic overindulgence, and instead advocates focusing on one&#x27;s fate in the afterlife, while containing Biblical allusions. &quot;When It Hurts So Bad&quot; fuses roots reggae, traditional soul, and contemporary R&amp;B, while detailing anguish caused by unrequited love. Mary J. Blige-assisted &quot;I Used to Love Him&quot; follows the protagonist who is now dispassionately reflecting on the concluded relationship in a self-critical manner. Hill and Blige are accompanied by a gospel-influenced choir of background vocalists. The roots reggae-gospel &quot;Forgive Them Father&quot; warns of individuals with hidden agendas and asks God to forgive them; it is an interpretation of &quot;Concrete Jungle&quot; by Bob Marley and the Wailers. Nickson noted a narrative constructed through the track order of &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot;, calling &quot;I Used to Love Him&quot; thematically a &quot;logical successor&quot; to &quot;When It Hurts So Bad&quot;, while the &quot;idea of asking God for forgiveness [on &quot;Forgive Them Father&quot;] flowed quite naturally&quot; from &quot;I Used to Love Him&quot;. The theme is discontinued on &quot;Every Ghetto, Every City&quot;, which sees Hill reminisce about her childhood. A funk track redolent of Stevie Wonder&#x27;s &quot;Living for the City&quot;, it replays elements of David Axelrod&#x27;s &quot;Tony Poem&quot; and Steve &quot;Silk&quot; Hurley&#x27;s &quot;Jack Your Body&quot;.

Although a large portion of love songs on &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; would turn out to be bitter from Hill&#x27;s previous relationship, &quot;Nothing Even Matters&quot; showcased a brighter, more intimate perspective on the subject. The track is a collaboration with D&#x27;Angelo, who also plays the electric piano. It was inspired by Hill&#x27;s relationship with Rohan Marley. Speaking about its lyrics, she remarked: &quot;I wanted to make a love song, á la Roberta Flack &amp; Donny Hathaway, and give people a humanistic approach to love again without all the physicality and overt sexuality.&quot; &quot;Everything Is Everything&quot; discusses life changes, and expresses dissatisfaction with adult cynicism prevailing over adolescent idealism, while the album&#x27;s title track, built on the Hammond organ, piano, and strings, encourages self-examination and pursuing one&#x27;s individual destiny, branding traditional education insufficient. &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; also includes two hidden tracks. The cover of Frankie Valli&#x27;s &quot;Can&#x27;t Take My Eyes Off You&quot; merges 1960s soul with contemporary hip hop, featuring beatboxing, and offers an optimistic view on the album&#x27;s recurring theme of love. Nickson described the fingerstyle guitar-driven &quot;Tell Him&quot; as &quot;a prayer that was sung, almost a hymn&quot;, recognizing it as a dedication to God, to Hill&#x27;s son Zion David, and to Rohan Marley.

==Marketing==
===Imagery===
Having already established himself as a viable art director at Sony Music, Erwin Gorostiza was selected to manage art direction for &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot;. As he concluded Hill was involved with her imagery more than any other artist he had previously worked with, he insisted she be given the art direction credit equal to his. Gorostiza soon enlisted photographer Eric Johnson for the album&#x27;s accompanying artwork. Hill decided to set the photo shoot at the Columbia High School, her alma mater, to go along with the album&#x27;s title and concept. While there were numerous images photographed inside a classroom, a hallway, a lavatory, and a school bus, a close-up image of Hill was chosen to be retouched, to look as if it was carved into a wooden desk, for the album cover. The cover has been included on numerous lists of best hip-hop and R&amp;B album covers ever. The high school theme was maintained in the promotional televised teasers for the album, which featured voice-overs by Joan Baker.

The marketing strategy for &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; was highly concentrated on print media, with Hill appearing on the covers of &quot;Details&quot;, &quot;Essence&quot;, &quot;GQ&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, &quot;Honey&quot;, &quot;Interview&quot;, &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;The Source&quot;, &quot;Teen People&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, and &quot;Vibe&quot;. Hill&#x27;s publicist Miguel Baguer pushed fashion magazines to recognize Hill as &quot;a cultural disruptor and a cover girl&quot;. Hill was also invested in her styling for the covers, envisioning gold-sprayed locks for the &quot;Details&quot; cover, as she and her styling team &quot;didn&#x27;t succumb to mainstream’s definition of beauty&quot;. &quot;CR Fashion Book&quot; editor Faith Brown retrospectively remarked that Hill established herself as a fashion icon during the promotional cycle of &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot;.

Tamara Palmer wrote for The Recording Academy that the &quot;masterful&quot; accompanying music videos for the album&#x27;s singles &quot;showed Hill as a woman who transcends the ages&quot;. &quot;Doo Wop (That Thing)&quot; featured a split screen showing a block party in Washington Heights; the left side displayed the party set in 1967, with Hill wearing a 1960s-inspired wig and a zebra-striped dress, while the right side showed the party set in 1998. The video went on to win four MTV Video Music Awards in 1999, including Video of the Year, becoming the first hip-hop music video to win the award. &quot;Ex-Factor&quot; first pictures Hill in a light room, wearing white clothing, before transitioning into black and blue-tinged nightclub scenery, while &quot;Everything Is Everything&quot; shows Hill walking around New York City, which is depicted as spinning around on an enormous phonograph. The latter was nominated for Best Short Form Music Video at the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards.

===Release and promotion===
&quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; was first released in Japan on August 19, 1998, before being released in the US on August 25, and elsewhere throughout the following month. To commence its pre-release marketing campaign, Ruffhouse Records mailed a promotional vinyl of &quot;Lost Ones&quot; to select radio stations; the song managed to garner enough airplay to reach number 27 on the US R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Airplay. &quot;Can&#x27;t Take My Eyes Off You&quot;—which originally appeared in the 1997 film &quot;Conspiracy Theory&quot;—began receiving heavy unsolicited airplay, prompting it to reach the top 40 on the US Hot 100 Airplay; consequently, the song was added on &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; as a hidden track. &quot;Doo Wop (That Thing)&quot; was then released as the album&#x27;s official lead single on August 10, 1998, debuting atop the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and breaking numerous chart records. Stephanie Gayle, senior director of marketing at Columbia Records, retrospectively analyzed: &quot;&#x27;Lost Ones&#x27; set the tone for how Lauryn the solo artist would be embraced at Black radio (and anywhere hip-hop was being played). But &#x27;Doo Wop (That Thing)&#x27; told the world there was nowhere this young lady of color would &quot;not&quot; be heard.&quot;

Hill further promoted &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; with televised performances on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and at the &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards in December. &quot;Ex-Factor&quot; was released as the second single on December 14, but failed to replicate the success of its predecessor, peaking at number 21 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, while reaching the top five in Iceland and the UK. Meanwhile, &quot;To Zion&quot; had been released as a promotional single in November, and would be performed with Carlos Santana at the 41st Annual Grammy Awards on February 24, 1999. &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; was also released as a promotional single, exclusively in Japan, in March. &quot;Everything Is Everything&quot; was released as the third and final single on May 3, peaking at number 35 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Hill performed the song alongside &quot;Lost Ones&quot; at the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards on September 9. Furthermore, she performed &quot;Final Hour&quot; at &quot;The Source&quot; Hip-Hop Music Awards on August 18.

==Touring==

Initially, there was no immediate tour planned in support of &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot;, due to the album not needing further promotion and Hill being pregnant with her second child Selah, whom she gave birth to in November 1998. In January 1999, however, Hill recruited a band and began rehearsals for what would become The Miseducation Tour. Tickets sold out as soon as the tour was announced, which included three sold-out nights at The Theater at Madison Square Garden. &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; called the tour &quot;quite possibly the most accomplished tour ever by a hip-hop artist&quot; at the time. Notable attendees included Harrison Ford, Natalie Portman, Star Jones, Casey Affleck, Nina Simone, John Galliano, Rosie O&#x27;Donnell, Mary J. Blige, Sean Combs, and a young Adele. The tour featured Outkast, Busta Rhymes, and the Roots as opening acts. According to OutKast&#x27;s tour manager Michael &quot;Blue&quot; Williams, the tour helped establish the group as touring artists, with Williams elaborating: &quot;After that, we never went under $100,000 a show again. That was because we got in front of Lauryn&#x27;s 12 million fans, who were hip hop and pop fans, and they became Outkast fans.&quot;

The Miseducation Tour began at the Nippon Budokan in Tokyo on January 21, 1999. Hill performed there again the following night, and played at two other Tokyo venues in the following week. She then flew to London for her performance at the Brixton Academy on February 5. The 20-date US leg of the tour, which featured Outkast as the opening act, started on February 18 in Detroit, and ended on April 1 in Hill&#x27;s hometown of Newark. Hill began the tour&#x27;s 14-date European leg on May 13, when she performed at the Oslo Spektrum in Norway, ending the leg on June 2 at the Manchester Arena in England. Hill would return to the US, performing 10 shows throughout July and August, with Busta Rhymes as an opening act. She then returned to Japan, where the tour was completed. The September 7 show in Tokyo was recorded and, in November 2020, released on the live album &quot;Live in Tokyo, Japan &#x27;99&quot;. Hill did not want an extensive tour because of obligations to her family and the difficulties she experienced touring with the Fugees in 1996, which she found desensitizing and isolating. According to Chris Nickson, &quot;there was the possibility of more dates being added ... but it was unlikely that Lauryn would be willing to make the tour more grueling and draining. She&#x27;d come to know that there was much more to life than a career.&quot;

The Miseducation Tour was co-sponsored by the Italian luxury brand Armani. American denim brand Levi Strauss &amp; Co. also sponsored the tour, and sold a denim outfit designed by Hill on their website, which helped improve the company&#x27;s declining sales. Those sponsorships marked a relatively new concept at the time, which strayed from the traditional jingle-based brand collaborations. Thembisa Mshaka of Okayplayer emphasized the importance the sponsorships for black artists, writing: &quot;The Fortune 500 brand partnerships with Black musicians that are ubiquitous today, were seeded by the success of Lauryn’s solo debut.&quot; Outfits worn during the tour have been displayed during exhibitions at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Met Gala. In 2019, &quot;Andscape&quot; named the Miseducation Tour the greatest female hip-hop tour ever.

===Anniversary tours===
Though Hill had toured extensively in support of &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot;, she had not performed the album live in its entirety until August 2011, 13 years after its release, when she co-headlined the annual hip-hop festival Rock the Bells. Her performances were met with a mixed reception, with reviewers criticizing her alterations of the songs&#x27; arrangements. Hill continued changing arrangements and tempos of the tracks in subsequent concerts, elaborating: &quot;There&#x27;s no way I could continue to play the same songs over and over as long as I&#x27;ve been performing them without some variation and exploration&quot;. Speculation arose over Hill being prohibited from performing original versions in the aftermath of New Ark&#x27;s lawsuit against her, which she refuted. 

In April 2018, Hill announced The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill 20th Anniversary Tour, with its first North American leg scheduled to commence in Virginia Beach on July 5, and finish in St. Louis, Missouri on October 5. In the months preceding the tour, Hill performed at a myriad of festivals worldwide. As the Virginia Beach date was postponed and ultimately cancelled, the tour commenced in Boston on July 11. Nas, Dave Chappelle, M.I.A., Santigold, ASAP Rocky, SZA, Big Boi, De La Soul, Busta Rhymes, Talib Kweli, and Shabazz Palaces, among others, were announced as the tour&#x27;s special guests. Reviewing the tour&#x27;s Portland stop, Eric Diep of &quot;Billboard&quot; praised the set list and Hill&#x27;s &quot;sharp&quot; verse delivery. The tour was subsequently extended into Europe, with the leg starting in Brussels, Belgium on November 18, and ending in Stockholm, Sweden on December 10. In a review of the Arena Birmingham show, published via &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Kitty Empire criticized alterations of the song&#x27;s arrangements, but commended Hill&#x27;s &quot;lucid and engaged&quot; stage presence. Despite mostly favorable commentaries on Hill&#x27;s performances, her frequent tardiness elicited backlash from both audiences and critics. The controversy intensified in February 2019, when the tour visited Australia, with Hill notoriously over an hour late to her Sydney show and appearing too ill to perform. Regardless, Hill continued the tour until late September, with legs in Africa and South America, and various festival concerts across North America and Europe.

In August 2023, Hill announced The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill 25th Anniversary Tour, with initial dates spanning from September 8 to November 9, 2023, throughout North America and Oceania. With the Fugees as the opening act for the North American dates, the tour also served as the group&#x27;s reunion tour. In October, Hill announced 10 additional shows. The following month, however, she postponed remaining dates until 2024 due to a vocal strain. The postponed dates were subsequently incorporated into a new tour, The Celebration Continues Tour, which is co-headlined with the Fugees to honor &quot;The Score&quot; in addition to &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot;. Furthermore, Hill&#x27;s son YG Marley is set to accompany the group as a special guest. Upon the tour&#x27;s announcement, Hill and Marley performed together on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot; and at the BET Awards 2024. The tour was originally set to begin in Miami on August 9, 2024, with its European leg scheduled to commence in Manchester, England on October 12. However, on August 7, Hill issued a statement elaborating the abrupt cancellation of the North American leg the previous day, citing low ticket sales, which she attributed to media sensationalism over the November 2023 tour postponement.

==Critical reception==

&quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; was met with widespread critical acclaim. According to &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; journalist Geoff Boucher, it was the most acclaimed album of 1998, with reviewers frequently praising Hill&#x27;s presentation of a woman&#x27;s perspective on life and love. Eric Weisbard from &quot;Spin&quot; called her a &quot;genre-bender&quot; whose confident singing and rapping was balanced by vulnerable themes and sentiment. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Ann Powers found it &quot;miraculous&quot; and &quot;exceptional&quot; for Hill to use &quot;her faith, based more in experience and feeling than in doctrine&quot;, as a means of connecting &quot;the sacred to the secular in music that touches the essence of soul.&quot; AllMusic&#x27;s John Bush was impressed by Hill producing most of the album &quot;not as a crossover record, but as a collection of overtly personal and political statements&quot;, while demonstrating &quot;performing talents, vocal range, and songwriting smarts&quot;. David Browne, writing in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, called it &quot;an album of often-astonishing power, strength, and feeling&quot;, as well as &quot;one of the rare hip-hop soul albums&quot; not to lose focus with frivolous guest appearances. Browne applauded Hill&#x27;s artistic vision and credited her for &quot;easily flowing from singing to rapping, evoking the past while forging a future of her own&quot;. Dream Hampton of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; said Hill seamlessly &quot;travels her realm within any given song&quot;, while &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; critic Greg Kot deemed the record a &quot;vocal tour de force&quot; with arrangements which &quot;bristle with great ideas&quot;. An editor of &quot;XXL&quot; wrote that &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; &quot;not only verifies [Hill] as the most exciting voice of a young, progressive hip-hop nation, it raises the standards for it&quot;, with the album being the first ever to receive an &quot;XXL&quot; rating.

In a less enthusiastic review for &quot;Q&quot;, Dom Phillips felt the music&#x27;s only flaw was &quot;a lack of memorable melody&quot; on some songs that did not use interesting samples. John Mulvey from &quot;NME&quot; quibbled about what he felt were redundant skits, Hill&#x27;s &quot;propensity&quot; for histrionics, and declarations of &quot;how brilliant God is&quot; on an otherwise &quot;essential&quot; album. &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Neil Lieberman found some of the ballads tedious and the melodies &quot;cheesy&quot;. Citing &quot;Lost Ones&quot; and &quot;Superstar&quot; as highlights, &quot;The Village Voice&quot; music editor Robert Christgau deemed it the &quot; record of the year&quot;, featuring exceptionally understated production and skillful rapping but also inconsistent lyrics, average singing, and superfluous skits. He appreciated the &quot;knowledge [and] moral authority&quot; of Hill&#x27;s perspective and values, although he lamented her appraisal of God on record. In the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Soren Baker believed Hill was more effective as a critical rapper than a singer on the more emotional songs, where her voice was &quot;too thin to carry such heavy subject matter&quot;.

Critical acclaim for &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; persevered with retrospective commentaries. Including it in their 2003 listing The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; credited Hill with retrieving 1970s soul and popularizing it within the hip-hop culture. Jon Caramanica, writing in &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), called the record &quot;as earnest, unpretentious, and pleasantly sloppy an album as any woman of the hip-hop generation has ever made&quot;, and said that, by appealing to a wide spectrum of listeners with hip-hop filtered through a &quot;womanist lens&quot;, the album propelled Hill to superstardom &quot;of epic proportions&quot; and &quot;the focal point at hip-hop&#x27;s crossover into the mainstream.&quot; According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, the album &quot;taught a generation about the power of baring your soul through song&quot;. Upon the record&#x27;s 15th anniversary in 2013, rapper Nas reviewed the album for &quot;XXL&quot;, hailing it as a model for artists of all genres to follow. He further labeled it &quot;a timeless record, pure music&quot;, and said it &quot;represents the time period—a serious moment in Black music, when young artists were taking charge and breaking through doors.&quot; Chris Mench of &quot;Complex&quot; wrote that the album &quot;set a new standard for rap women, and even for rap in general&quot;, adding that &quot;its influence extends far beyond the genre walls of hip-hop&quot;, emphasizing the impact it had on respective artistries of Lupe Fiasco, Kendrick Lamar, Adele, Amy Winehouse, and FKA Twigs. David Opie of &quot;Highsnobiety&quot; declared that &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; has educated &quot;pretty much everyone who&#x27;s recorded music since&quot;, as well as &quot;inspiring both newer artists and hip-hop stalwarts alike.&quot; Writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Kitty Empire called the record a &quot;game-changing cri de coeur&quot; and a predecessor to Beyoncé&#x27;s &quot;Lemonade&quot; (2016) and Janelle Monáe&#x27;s &quot;Dirty Computer&quot; (2018), proclaiming that it &quot;channelled some precious learning for a generation or more of young women, black and white alike; one in which a ferociously talented artist preached self-determination and self-respect, self-knowledge and getting one&#x27;s due&quot;. In the same publication, Kelefa Sanneh heralded the album as &quot;the high-water mark of the conscious hip-hop movement&quot;.

==Accolades==
===Awards and nominations===
&quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; and its tracks were nominated for a myriad of industry awards, winning most. At the 1998 &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards, the album won R&amp;B Album of the Year, based on its performance on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. Hill was among the biggest winners at the 1999 NAACP Image Awards with four awards, including Outstanding Album for &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot;, and the President&#x27;s Award for &quot;special achievement in furthering the cause of civil rights and public service&quot;. Hill&#x27;s 10 nominations at the 41st Annual Grammy Awards marked the most Grammy Award nominations in a single ceremony for a woman. Winning five awards, Hill became the female artist with most wins in a single ceremony. Among the awards was Album of the Year for &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot;, which marked the first time a hip-hop artist won the award. The album also won Best R&amp;B Album, while Hill won Best New Artist, as well as Best R&amp;B Song and Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance for &quot;Doo Wop (That Thing)&quot;. Hill was the most awarded artist at the 1999 Soul Train Music Awards as well, winning Best R&amp;B/Soul or Rap Album of the Year and Best R&amp;B/Soul Album – Female for &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot;, the Sammy Davis Jr. Award for Entertainer of the Year – Female, and the Michael Jackson Award for Best R&amp;B/Soul or Rap Music Video for &quot;Doo Wop (That Thing)&quot;. The album subsequently won the &quot;Source&quot; Hip-Hop Music Award and the Soul Train Lady of Soul Award, both for Album of the Year. At the American Music Awards of 2000, Hill won Favorite Soul/R&amp;B Female Artist, while &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; won Favorite Soul/R&amp;B Album. Internationally, the album was nominated for Best Album at the 1999 MTV Europe Music Awards, and International Album of the Year at the inaugural NRJ Music Awards.

===Listings===
===Honors===
&quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; was declared &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the Library of Congress, and selected for inclusion in the 2014 class of the National Recording Registry, becoming the first female rap recording to enter the National Recording Registry. In 2017, Harvard University selected it as one of the first batch of hip-hop albums to preserved in the Loeb Music Library. Additionally, the album has also been collected by the National Museum of African American History and Culture, while The Recording Academy inducted it into the 2024 class of the Grammy Hall of Fame.

==Commercial performance==
In the US, &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; debuted atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart dated September 12, 1998, becoming the first number-one album by an unaccompanied female rapper on the chart. It also became the first debut album by a woman to debut atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, which made Hill the first artist to debut atop both the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 with the first entries. The album&#x27;s first-week sales of over 422,624 copies broke the record for female artists at the time; they remained the highest first-week sales for a debut album released by a woman in the 20th century, and the highest for a female rapper ever. In its second week, the album remained at the summit, selling 265,000 copies, and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It stayed atop the chart in its third week, before descending to number two, and returning to the top in its fifth week. By late October, it had spent nearly two consecutive months within the top three. The album&#x27;s chart stability was considered rare for a hip-hop release at the time, since most high-debuting hip-hop albums would quickly plummet. &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; had sold 2.9 million units in the country by December 1998, becoming one of the best-selling albums of the year, and topping the year-end Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums. Sales increased after the 41st Annual Grammy Awards, as it sold 234,000 copies during the week of March 3, 1999, and 200,000 copies the following week. The album spent a total of 92 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, being the longest-charting debut album by a female rapper until it was surpassed by Cardi B&#x27;s &quot;Invasion of Privacy&quot; (2018). &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; remains the only rap album by a woman to spend over one week at number one, and one of the longest-running number-one rap albums ever on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. In 2021, the album was certified diamond by the RIAA, denoting album-equivalent units of 10 million in the US; Hill thus became the first female rapper to receive a RIAA diamond certification.

In Canada, &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; debuted at number 16 on the Canadian Albums Chart dated September 12, 1998, peaking atop the chart on October 17. By August 1999, it had sold 700,000 units in the country, being certified septuple platinum. In the UK, the album debuted and peaked at number two on the UK Albums Chart, while debuting atop the UK R&amp;B Albums Chart, where it spent 18 non-consecutive weeks at the summit. In 2022, it was certified quadruple platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), denoting album-equivalent units of 1,200,000. As of October 2023, the album is among the 20 most streamed albums of the 1990s in the country. In Ireland, &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; became the first rap album to reach number one on the Irish Albums Chart. Across Europe, it reached the top 10 in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Norway, and Sweden, as well as number two on the European Top 100 Albums. The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) certified the album double platinum, for sales of two million copies in Europe, in 1999. In Japan, &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; peaked at number six on the Oricon Albums Chart, and was certified million by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) in September 1999. In Australia, the album was a sleeper hit, debuting at number 47 and peaking at number two in its 23rd week; it was certified double platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) in 2019, denoting units of 140,000. In New Zealand, the album peaked at number five, and was certified triple platinum for shipments of 45,000 units. Within its first year, &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; sold 10 million copies worldwide, having sold over 20 million by its 20th anniversary, when it was also confirmed as the most streamed 1998 album on Spotify. In addition to being one of the best-selling albums of all time, it is also the best-selling neo soul album ever.

===Industry impact===

In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Danyel Smith stated that &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; &quot;dragged rap back to the land of the living&quot; after the twin drive-by murders of Tupac Shakur and Notorious B.I.G. Hill appeared on the cover of the February 8, 1999 issue of &quot;Time&quot;, becoming the first rapper to do so. Later that month, Hill broke a multitude of records at the 41st Annual Grammy Awards, winning Album of the Year—often recognized as the most prestigious award in the music industry—for &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot;, among other awards. According to music executive Clive Davis, the win helped the Grammy Awards become more accepting of rap and hip-hop music, while Amazon&#x27;s former senior music editor Pete Hilgendorf stated the win marked the start of &quot;the progression of R&amp;B moving into hip-hop&quot;.

Radio personality Ed Lover argued that &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; offered a different perspective from other women in hip-hop, who generally rapped about sexual themes or being &quot;rugged&quot;, while rapper Redman emphasized its empowerment of women and compared Hill&#x27;s lyrical impact to Martin Luther King Jr. Jay-Z stated that Hill &quot;made something that&#x27;s going to stand the test of time&quot; with the record, while Cyndi Lauper remarked that the album &quot;changed everything and everybody. Lauryn Hill changed phrasing. She started a whole new kind of singing, taking church and hip-hop and stirring it with this freaking great feeling and voice.&quot; Christian rap artist Lecrae credited the album and its religious themes for introducing him to gospel music. Talent manager Nick Shymansky recognized &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; prompting him to search for an artist similar to Hill, which led him to discover Amy Winehouse, who eventually began working on her debut album &quot;Frank&quot; (2003) with Commissioner Gordon.

Along with &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; (1995) by D&#x27;Angelo, &quot;Maxwell&#x27;s Urban Hang Suite&quot; (1996) by Maxwell, and &quot;Baduizm&quot; (1997) by Erykah Badu, &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; is considered to be one of the most important and definitive releases in the history of neo soul music. Credited for bringing the genre to the forefront of popular music, &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; became neo soul&#x27;s most critically acclaimed and popular album. Kyle Anderson of MTV emphasized the album&#x27;s influence on neo soul artists such as Badu, Alicia Keys, and Jill Scott. &quot;Encyclopedia of African American Music&quot; (2010) noted that, while some tracks are based in hip-hop soul more than neo soul, the record is filled with live musicians and layered harmonies, &quot;and therefore it is a trendsetting record that connects modern hip hop, R&amp;B, and classic soul music together, creating groundwork for what followed it in the neo soul genre.&quot; In conversation with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; about the success of &quot;Black Diamond&quot; (1999) by Angie Stone, editor Emil Wilbekin of &quot;Vibe&quot; stated that &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; introduced new practices to contemporary R&amp;B, such as recording with live instruments.

===Artistic influence===
In &quot;The Rough Guide to Rock&quot; (2003), author Peter Buckley hailed &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; as the &quot;ultimate cross-over album of the hip-hop era&quot;. The album has been cited as one of the earliest to fully blend rapping and singing, with Genius dubbing Hill as the first recording artist to excel at both simultaneously. Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2018, Jon Caramanica noted the influence the performance style had on Drake, adding: &quot;Rappers are singers now, to the point where the framework of singing has been refracted almost wholly through the needs of hip-hop.&quot; When speaking to &quot;Pitchfork&quot; about the album, rapper Vince Staples called it &quot;a classic body of work&quot;, and credited Hill for her innovative singing-rapping style, lyricism, and arrangements. Janelle Monáe shared a similar sentiment, arguing that Hill &quot;was hip-hop and R&amp;B, but nobody had used [the combination] in the way she did. She created something that we had never tasted before.&quot; Kathy Iandoli recognized how the album touching upon themes of love, distrust, pregnancy, and self-actualization introduced emotionally charged lyricism to hip-hop, allowing rappers such as Kid Cudi and Kanye West to showcase vulnerability in their music.

A multitude of artists have cited &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; as an inspiration for their work, including Omar Apollo, H.E.R., Ella Mai, Rachel Platten, Maren Morris, Jay-Z, Alicia Keys, 
Tierra Whack, and Macy Gray. Furthermore, Rihanna, Dan Smith of Bastille, and Adele have all called &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; their personal favorite album. Donald Glover stated that it&#x27;s his most listened album, while Zendaya, J. Cole, and Kendrick Lamar have cited it as their favorite album by a female artist. Maxwell named it his favorite album of the 1990s, praising it for its combination of &quot;incredible songwriting and hip-hop&quot;. In celebration of the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary, &quot;Billboard&quot; interviewed 16 artists who have cited the album as an inspiration—Maggie Rogers, Rapsody, Chloe Bailey, Jessie Ware, Lizzo, Ruth B., K.Flay, Anne-Marie, Jess Glynne, Jazmine Sullivan, Seinabo Sey, Andra Day, Saweetie, Normani, Teyana Taylor, and Ella Mai—with each artist commenting on one of the album&#x27;s tracks. Film director Gina Prince-Bythewood stated that she was inspired by Hill and &quot;Ex-Factor&quot; while filming &quot;Love &amp; Basketball&quot; (2000). Actress Alexa Demie mentioned that she drew inspiration from &quot;To Zion&quot; for her role in the HBO drama series &quot;Euphoria&quot;.

&quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; has been credited with influencing the albums &quot;The College Dropout&quot; (2004) by Kanye West, &quot;Confessions&quot; (2004) by Usher, &quot;4&quot; (2011) by Beyoncé, &quot;Daytona&quot; (2018) by Pusha T, and &quot;Immunity&quot; (2019) by Clairo. Producer Savan Kotecha told &quot;Vulture&quot; that he and Ariana Grande listened to &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; album during the recording of Grande&#x27;s album &quot;Sweetener&quot; (2018), and that the chord changes in Grande&#x27;s song &quot;No Tears Left to Cry&quot; were modeled after the album. Country singer Lucinda Williams stated that her album &quot;World Without Tears&quot; (2003) and its single &quot;Righteously&quot; were influenced by &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; and its hip-hop elements. Hill&#x27;s album inspired the 2002 Maroon 5 album &quot;Songs About Jane&quot;, most evidently on the track &quot;Sweetest Goodbye&quot;, which drew from &quot;Tell Him&quot;. Numerous artists have titled their projects after the album, including Freddie Gibbs with his mixtape &quot;The Miseducation of Freddie Gibbs&quot; (2009), whose cover artwork also imitates Hill&#x27;s, Lil&#x27; Kim on her mixtape track &quot;Mis-education of Lil&#x27; Kim&quot;, which heavily samples and interpolates &quot;Lost Ones&quot;, and Calboy and Lil Wayne on their 2021 single &quot;Miseducation&quot;.

===Aftermath===
Following the success of &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot;, Hill rose to international prominence and established herself as a pioneering woman in hip-hop,&lt;ref name=&quot;BlackPressUSA/NNPA&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a &quot;&quot;—a successful rapper, singer, songwriter and producer. As early as March 1999, she was described as a hip-hop icon in &quot;Jet&quot;. Brandon Tensley of &quot;Time&quot; remarked that she achieved the icon status through the impact of &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; alone. However, the record remains Hill&#x27;s only studio album. After its success, she shunned her celebrity status and pursued a private life, raising six children, but both personal and professional difficulties followed. As &quot;Miami New Times&quot; journalist Juliana Accioly explained, Hill was reported to have spent years &quot;on a spiritual quest while dealing with bipolar disorder. She was sued over songwriting credits. She served a three-month prison sentence in 2013 for tax evasion. She was deemed a diva for wanting to be called &#x27;Ms. Hill&#x27; and criticized for her erratic performances.&quot; In 2021, Hill revealed that she had never released another album due to Columbia Records not offering her adequate support in producing it, and due to fearing jeopardizing her artistic authenticity by continuing to record for the label.

In 2015, Marvel Comics released a series of variant comic book covers inspired by influential contemporary rap albums, which included a reimagined &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot;-themed Ms. Marvel comic cover. Yerba Buena Center for the Arts music collective UnderCover Presents released the tribute album &quot;UnderCover Presents: A Tribute to The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; in 2017. In September 2018, in conjunction with the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary, Legacy Recordings launched &quot;&quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; Album Cover Experience&quot;, which allowed users to recreate and personalize the cover, and subsequently post the final product on social media. The album was the subject of the 2018 book &quot;She Begat This: 20 Years of The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; by author and journalist Joan Morgan. To further commemorate the anniversary, Hill collaborated with American clothing company Woolrich to design &quot;Miseducation&quot;-inspired pieces for their collection &quot;American Soul Since 1830&quot;, and starred in its accompanying advertising campaign. She performed at New York Fashion Week to promote the collection. Meanwhile, Spotify both presented the art installation &quot;Dear Ms. Hill&quot; in Brooklyn, which featured fan letters, and launched the miniseries &quot;Dissect&quot;, whose first season covered &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; and its impact. Furthermore, a 2019 episode of the BET anthology series &quot;Tales&quot; was inspired by and titled after &quot;Ex-Factor&quot;.

<text>In statistics, completeness is a property of a statistic computed on a sample dataset in relation to a parametric model of the dataset. It is opposed to the concept of an ancillary statistic. While an ancillary statistic contains no information about the model parameters, a complete statistic contains only information about the parameters, and no ancillary information. It is closely related to the concept of a sufficient statistic which contains all of the information that the dataset provides about the parameters.

==Definition==
Consider a random variable &quot;X&quot; whose probability distribution belongs to a parametric model P&quot;θ&quot; parametrized by &quot;θ&quot;.

Say &quot;T&quot; is a statistic; that is, the composition of a measurable function with a random sample &quot;X&quot;1...,&quot;X&quot;n.

The statistic &quot;T&quot; is said to be complete for the distribution of &quot;X&quot; if, for every measurable function &quot;g,&quot;

:formula_1

The statistic &quot;T&quot; is said to be boundedly complete for the distribution of &quot;X&quot; if this implication holds for every measurable function &quot;g&quot; that is also bounded.
== Examples ==

=== Bernoulli model ===

The Bernoulli model admits a complete statistic. Let &quot;X&quot; be a random sample of size &quot;n&quot; such that each &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot; has the same Bernoulli distribution with parameter &quot;p&quot;. Let &quot;T&quot; be the number of 1s observed in the sample, i.e. formula_2. &quot;T&quot; is a statistic of &quot;X&quot; which has a binomial distribution with parameters (&quot;n&quot;,&quot;p&quot;). If the parameter space for &quot;p&quot; is (0,1), then &quot;T&quot; is a complete statistic. To see this, note that

:formula_3

Observe also that neither &quot;p&quot; nor 1 − &quot;p&quot; can be 0. Hence formula_4 if and only if:

:formula_5

On denoting &quot;p&quot;/(1 − &quot;p&quot;) by &quot;r&quot;, one gets:

:formula_6

First, observe that the range of &quot;r&quot; is the positive reals. Also, E(&quot;g&quot;(&quot;T&quot;)) is a polynomial in &quot;r&quot; and, therefore, can only be identical to 0 if all coefficients are 0, that is, &quot;g&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) = 0 for all &quot;t&quot;.

It is important to notice that the result that all coefficients must be 0 was obtained because of the range of &quot;r&quot;. Had the parameter space been finite and with a number of elements less than or equal to &quot;n&quot;, it might be possible to solve the linear equations in &quot;g&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) obtained by substituting the values of &quot;r&quot; and get solutions different from 0. For example, if &quot;n&quot; = 1 and the parameter space is {0.5}, a single observation and a single parameter value, &quot;T&quot; is not complete. Observe that, with the definition:

:formula_7

then, E(&quot;g&quot;(&quot;T&quot;)) = 0 although &quot;g&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is not 0 for &quot;t&quot; = 0 nor for &quot;t&quot; = 1.

=== Gaussian model with fixed variance ===

This example will show that, in a sample &quot;X&quot;1, &quot;X&quot;2 of size 2 from a normal distribution with known variance, the statistic &quot;X&quot;1 + &quot;X&quot;2 is complete and sufficient. Suppose &quot;X&quot;1, &quot;X&quot;2 are independent, identically distributed random variables, normally distributed with expectation &quot;θ&quot; and variance 1.
The sum

:formula_8

is a complete statistic for &quot;θ&quot;.

To show this, it is sufficient to demonstrate that there is no non-zero function formula_9 such that the expectation of

:formula_10

remains zero regardless of the value of &quot;θ&quot;.

That fact may be seen as follows. The probability distribution of &quot;X&quot;1 + &quot;X&quot;2 is normal with expectation 2&quot;θ&quot; and variance 2. Its probability density function in formula_11 is therefore proportional to

:formula_12

The expectation of &quot;g&quot; above would therefore be a constant times

:formula_13

A bit of algebra reduces this to

:formula_14

where &quot;k&quot;(&quot;θ&quot;) is nowhere zero and

:formula_15

As a function of &quot;θ&quot; this is a two-sided Laplace transform of &quot;h&quot;, and cannot be identically zero unless &quot;h&quot; is zero almost everywhere. The exponential is not zero, so this can only happen if &quot;g&quot; is zero almost everywhere.

By contrast, the statistic formula_16 is sufficient but not complete. It admits a non-zero unbiased estimator of zero, namely formula_17.

=== Sufficiency does not imply completeness ===

Most parametric models have a sufficient statistic which is not complete. This is important because the Lehmann–Scheffé theorem cannot be applied to such models. Galili and Meilijson 2016 propose the following didactic example.

Consider formula_18 independent samples from the uniform distribution:

:formula_19

formula_20 is a known design parameter. This model is a &quot;scale family&quot; (a specific case of a location-scale family) model: scaling the samples by a multiplier formula_21 multiplies the parameter formula_22.

Galili and Meilijson show that the minimum and maximum of the samples are together a sufficient statistic: formula_23 (using the usual notation for order statistics). Indeed, conditional on these two values, the distribution of the rest of the sample is simply uniform on the range they define: formula_24.

However, their ratio has a distribution which does not depend on formula_22. This follows from the fact that this is a scale family: any change of scale impacts both variables identically. Subtracting the mean formula_26 from that distribution, we obtain:

:formula_27

We have thus shown that there exists a function formula_28 which is not formula_29 everywhere but which has expectation formula_29. The pair is thus not complete.

==Importance of completeness==
The notion of completeness has many applications in statistics, particularly in the following theorems of mathematical statistics.

===Lehmann–Scheffé theorem===
Completeness occurs in the Lehmann–Scheffé theorem,
which states that if a statistic that is unbiased, complete and sufficient for some parameter &quot;θ&quot;, then it is the best mean-unbiased estimator for &quot;θ&quot;. In other words, this statistic has a smaller expected loss for any convex loss function; in many practical applications with the squared loss-function, it has a smaller mean squared error among any estimators with the same expected value.

Examples exists that when the minimal sufficient statistic is not complete then several alternative statistics exist for unbiased estimation of &quot;θ&quot;, while some of them have lower variance than others.

See also minimum-variance unbiased estimator.

===Basu&#x27;s theorem===
Bounded completeness occurs in Basu&#x27;s theorem, which states that a statistic that is both boundedly complete and sufficient is independent of any ancillary statistic.

===Bahadur&#x27;s theorem===

Bounded completeness also occurs in Bahadur&#x27;s theorem. In the case where there exists at least one minimal sufficient statistic, a statistic which is sufficient and boundedly complete, is necessarily minimal sufficient.

<doc id="194619" wikidata="Q1465318" url="?curid=194619" title="Morale">
<text>Morale ( , ) is the capacity of a group&#x27;s members to maintain belief in an institution or goal, particularly in the face of opposition or hardship. Morale is often referenced by authority figures as a generic value judgment of the willpower, obedience, and self-discipline of a group tasked with performing duties assigned by a superior. According to Alexander H. Leighton, &quot;morale is the capacity of a group of people to pull together persistently and consistently in pursuit of a common purpose&quot;. With good morale, a force will be less likely to give up or surrender. Morale is usually assessed at a collective, rather than an individual level. In wartime, civilian morale is also important.

==Definition==
Military history experts have not agreed on a precise definition of &quot;morale&quot;. Clausewitz&#x27;s comments on the subject have been described as &quot;deliberately vague&quot; by modern scholars. George Francis Robert Henderson, a widely read military author of the pre-World War I era, viewed morale as related to the instinct of self-preservation, the suppression of which he said was &quot;the moral fear of turning back&quot;, in other words, that a willingness to fight was bolstered by a strong sense of duty. Henderson wrote:

Human nature must be the basis of every leader&#x27;s calculations. To sustain the &quot;moral[e]&quot; of his own men; to break down the &quot;moral[e]&quot; of his enemy—these are the great objects which, if he be ambitious of success, he must always keep in view.

During the proceedings of the Southborough Committee inquiry concerning shellshock, testimony by Colonel J. F. C. Fuller defined morale as &quot;the acquired quality which in highly-trained troops counterbalances the influence of the instinct of self-preservation.&quot; Of Henderson&#x27;s &quot;moral fear&quot;, the soldier&#x27;s sense of duty, it is contrasted with the fear of death, and to control one&#x27;s troops required of a commander more than authoritarian force, but other strategies to be deployed to that purpose.

==Military==

In military science, there are two meanings to morale: individual perseverance and unit cohesion. Morale is often highly dependent on soldier effectiveness, health, comfort, safety, and belief-in-purpose, and therefore an army with good supply lines, sound air cover, and a clear objective will typically possess, as a whole, better morale than one without. &quot;Will to fight&quot; is the single most important factor in war. Will to fight helps determine whether a military unit stays in the fight and also how well it fights. 

Historically, elite military units such as special operations forces have &quot;high morale&quot; due to their training and pride in their unit. When a unit&#x27;s morale is said to be &quot;depleted&quot;, it means it is close to &quot;crack and surrender&quot;. It is well worth noting that generally speaking, most commanders do not look at the morale of specific individuals but rather the &quot;fighting spirit&quot; of squadrons, divisions, battalions, ships, etc.

In August 2012, an article entitled &quot;Army morale declines in survey&quot; states that &quot;only a quarter of the [US] Army&#x27;s officers and enlisted soldiers believe the nation&#x27;s largest military branch is headed in the right direction.&quot; The &quot;... most common reasons cited for the bleak outlook were &quot;ineffective leaders at senior levels,&quot; a fear of losing the best and the brightest after a decade of war, and the perception, especially among senior enlisted soldiers, that &quot;the Army is too soft&quot; and lacks sufficient discipline.&quot;

==Employee morale==

Employee morale is proven to have a direct effect on productivity; it is one of the cornerstones of business.

<text>Ángel O. Berríos Díaz (September 21, 1940 – April 28, 2006) was a native of Caguas, Puerto Rico. An engineer of profession, Berríos became the 22nd mayor of Caguas in 1973, after winning the 1972 elections, as a member of the Popular Democratic Party (PPD).

Berrios was defeated in the 1976 elections by the New Progressive Party candidate Miguel Hernández, but he came back on top during the 1980 elections. After being sworn back to office in 1981, he began a period of 16 years in a row as mayor of Caguas. During his tenure, new hospitals, malls, department stores and housing complexes were built.

Berríos became the managing owner of the Criollos de Caguas basketball team in 1987, and, later on, acquired the Criollas de Caguas women&#x27;s volleyball team. He was a member of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity.

Berríos decided not to run for mayor again in 1996, being substituted by William Miranda Marín as PPD leader in Caguas. Miranda Marín went on to win the elections that year.

Later on, an entertainment center was named after Berríos, the Centro de Bellas Artes Ángel O. Berríos.

Berríos died on April 28, 2006, due to complications of a stroke which had occurred six months prior. He was buried at Cementerio Borinquen Memorial Park I in Caguas, Puerto Rico.

==Legacy==
A sports complex in Caguas was posthumously named after Ángel O. Berríos.

<doc id="194624" wikidata="Q1876790" url="?curid=194624" title="Afrocentrism">
<text>Afrocentrism is a worldview that is centered on the history of people of African descent or a view that favors it over non-African civilizations. It is in some respects a response to Eurocentric attitudes about African people and their historical contributions. It seeks to counter what it sees as mistakes and ideas perpetuated by the racist philosophical underpinnings of Western academic disciplines as they developed during and since Europe&#x27;s Early Renaissance as justifying rationales for the enslavement of other peoples, in order to enable more accurate accounts of not only African but all people&#x27;s contributions to world history. Afrocentricity deals primarily with self-determination and African agency and is a pan-African point of view for the study of culture, philosophy, and history.

Afrocentrism is a scholarly movement that seeks to conduct research and education on global history subjects, from the perspective of historical African peoples and polities. It takes a critical stance on Eurocentric assumptions and myths about world history, in order to pursue methodological studies of the latter. Some of the critics of the movement believe that it often denies or minimizes European, Near Eastern, and Asian cultural influences while exaggerating certain aspects of historical African civilizations that independently accomplished a significant level of cultural and technological development. In general, Afrocentrism is usually manifested in a focus on the history of Africa and its role in contemporary African-American culture among others.

What is today broadly called Afrocentrism evolved out of the work of African American intellectuals in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, but flowered into its modern form due to the activism of African American intellectuals in the U.S. civil rights movement and in the development of African American studies programs in universities. However, following the development of universities in African colonies in the 1950s, African scholars became major contributors to African historiography. A notable pioneer is the professor Kenneth Dike, who became chairman of the Committee on African Studies at Harvard in the 1970s. In strict terms Afrocentrism, as a distinct historiography, reached its peak in the 1980s and 1990s. Today it is primarily associated with Cheikh Anta Diop, John Henrik Clarke, Ivan van Sertima and Molefi Kete Asante. Asante, however, describes his theories as Afrocentricity.

Proponents of Afrocentrism support the claim that the contributions of various Black African people have been downplayed or discredited as part of the legacy of colonialism and slavery&#x27;s pathology of &quot;writing Africans out of history&quot;.

Major critics of Afrocentrism include Mary Lefkowitz, who dismiss it as pseudohistory, reactive, and obstinately therapeutic. Others, such as Kwame Anthony Appiah, believe that Afrocentrism defeats its purpose of dismantling unipolar studies of world history by seeking to replace Eurocentricity with an equally ethnocentric and hierarchical curriculum, and negatively essentializes European culture and people of European descent. Clarence E. Walker claims it to be &quot;Eurocentrism in blackface&quot;.

==Terminology==
The term &quot;Afrocentrism&quot; dates to 1962. The adjective &quot;Afrocentric&quot; appears in a typescript proposal for an entry in &quot;Encyclopedia Africana&quot;, possibly due to W. E. B. Du Bois. The abstract noun &quot;Afrocentricity&quot; dates to the 1970s, and was popularized by Molefi Asante&#x27;s &quot;Afrocentricity: The Theory of Social Change&quot; (1980). Molefi Kete Asante&#x27;s theory, Afrocentricity, has been one developed in academic settings and may incorporate the terms Afrocentric to describe scholarship and Afrocentrists to describe scholars, but does not use Afrocentrism. According to Asante, though the two terms are often confused to mean the same, Afrocentrists are not adherents of Afrocentrism. This has caused confusing notions about who is considered an Afrocentrist, as various scholars who may or may not be associated with Asante and his works have been erroneously given the title, even by other academics. Asante has written that Afrocentricity and Afrocentrism are not the same and neither do they share the same origin:

By way of distinction, Afrocentricity should not be confused with the variant Afrocentrism. The term “Afrocentrism” was first used by the opponents of Afrocentricity who in their zeal saw it as an obverse of Eurocentrism. The adjective “Afrocentric” in the academic literature always referred to “Afrocentricity.” However, the use of “Afrocentrism” reflected a negation of the idea of Afrocentricity as a positive and progressive paradigm. The aim was to assign religious signification to the idea of African centeredness. However, it has come to refer to a broad cultural movement of the late twentieth century that has a set of philosophical, political, and artistic ideas which provides the basis for the musical, sartorial, and aesthetic dimensions of the African personality. On the other hand, Afrocentricity, as I have previously defined it, is a theory of agency, that is, the idea that African people must be viewed and view themselves as agents rather than spectators to historical revolution and change. To this end Afrocentricity seeks to examine every aspect of the subject place of Africans in historical, literary, architectural, ethical, philosophical, economic, and political life. 

==History==

Afrocentrism has its origins in the work of African and African diaspora intellectuals in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, following social changes in the United States and Africa due both to the end of slavery and the decline of colonialism. Following the American Civil War, African Americans in the South gathered together in communities to evade white control, established their own church congregations, and worked hard to gain education. They increasingly took more active public roles despite severe racial discrimination and segregation. American and African intellectuals looked to the African past for a re-evaluation of what its civilizations had achieved and what they meant for contemporary people.
As an ideology and political movement, Afrocentrism had its beginnings in activism among black intellectuals, political figures, and historians in the context of the US American civil rights movement. According to U.S. professor Victor Oguejiofor Okafor, concepts of Afrocentricity lie at the core of disciplines such as African American studies. But Wilson J. Moses claims that Afrocentrism roots are not exclusively African:
In 1987, Martin Bernal published his &quot;Black Athena&quot;, in which he claims that ancient Greece was colonized by northern invaders mixing with a colony established by Phoenicia (modern Lebanon). A major theme of the work is the alleged denial by Western academia of the African and (western) Asiatic influence on ancient Greek culture.

==Aspects of Afrocentricity and Afrocentrism==

===Afrocentricity book===
In 2000, African American Studies professor Molefi Kete Asante, gave a lecture entitled &quot;Afrocentricity: Toward a New Understanding of African Thought in this Millennium,&quot; in which he presented many of his ideas:
* Africa has been betrayed by international commerce, by missionaries and imams, by the structure of knowledge imposed by the Western world, by its own leaders, and by the ignorance of its own people of its past.
* Philosophy originated in Africa and the first philosophers in the world were Africans.
* Afrocentricity constitutes a new way of examining data, and a novel orientation to data; it carries with it assumptions about the current state of the African world.
* His aim is &quot;to help lay out a plan for the recovery of African place, respectability, accountability, and leadership.&quot;
* Afrocentricity can stand its ground among any ideology or religion: Marxism, Islam, Christianity, Buddhism, or Judaism. Your Afrocentricity will emerge in the presence of these other ideologies because it is from you.
* Afrocentrism is the only ideology that can liberate African people.

Asante also stated:

However, Wilson J. Moses, said of Asante: &quot;His second book, &quot;The Afrocentric Idea&quot; (1987), was a creative and in some respects brilliant but rambling theoretical work, much influenced by the revolution in &quot;critical theory&quot; that occurred in American intellectual life during the late 1970s and early 1980s.&quot; Some also assert that the definition of Afrocentricity has never sat still long enough to be properly described and accurately critiqued.

===Afrocentric education===

Afrocentric education is education designed to empower peoples of the African diaspora. A central premise behind it is that many Africans have been subjugated by limiting their awareness of themselves and indoctrinating them with ideas that work against them. To control a people&#x27;s culture is to control their tools of self-determination in relationship to others. Like educational leaders of other cultures, proponents assert that what educates one group of people does not necessarily educate and empower another group–so they assert educational priorities distinctly for the Africans in a given context.

===Afrocentric theology===

The black church in the United States developed out of the creolization of African spirituality and European-American Christianity; early members of the churches made certain stories their own. During the antebellum years, the idea of deliverance out of slavery, as in the story of Exodus, was especially important. After Reconstruction and the restoration of white supremacy, their hope was based on deliverance from segregation and other abuses. They found much to respond to in the idea of a personal relationship with Jesus, and shaped their churches by the growth of music and worship styles that related to African as well as European-American traditions.

Twentieth-century &quot;Africentric approaches&quot; to Christian theology and preaching have been more deliberate. Writers and thinkers emphasize &quot;Black presence&quot; in the Christian Bible, including the idea of a &quot;Black Jesus&quot;.

===Kwanzaa===
In 1966 Maulana Karenga of the black separatist US Organization created Kwanzaa; which became the first specifically African American holiday to be widely observed amongst African Americans. Karenga rejected liberation theology and considered the practice of Christianity anti-thetical to the creation of an African-American identity independent from white America. Karenga said his goal was to &quot;give Blacks an alternative to the existing holiday and give Blacks an opportunity to celebrate themselves and history, rather than simply imitate the practice of the dominant society.&quot;

===Race and Pan-African identity===
Many Afrocentrists seek to challenge concepts such as white privilege, color-blind perspectives, and race-neutral pedagogies. There are strong ties between Afrocentricity and Critical race theory.

Afrocentrists agree with the current scientific consensus that holds that Africans exhibit a range of types and physical characteristics, and that such elements as wavy hair or aquiline facial features are part of a continuum of African types that do not depend on admixture with Caucasian groups. They cite work by Hiernaux and Hassan that they believe demonstrates that populations could vary based on micro-evolutionary principles (climate adaptation, drift, selection), and that such variations existed in both living and fossil Africans.

Afrocentrists have condemned what they consider to be attempts at dividing African peoples into racial clusters as new versions of discredited theories, such as the Hamitic hypothesis and the Dynastic Race Theory. These theories, they contend, attempted to identify certain African ethnicities, such as Nubians, Ethiopians and Somalis, as &quot;Caucasoid&quot; groups that entered Africa to bring civilization to the natives. They believe that Western academics have traditionally limited the peoples they defined as &quot;Black&quot; Africans to those south of the Sahara, but used broader &quot;Caucasoid&quot; or related categories to classify peoples of Egypt or North Africa. Afrocentrists also believe strongly in the work of certain anthropologists who have suggested that there is little evidence to support that the first North African populations were closely related to &quot;Caucasoids&quot; of Europe and western Asia.

In 1964 Afrocentric scholar Cheikh Anta Diop expressed a belief in such a double standard:
French historian Jean Vercoutter has claimed that archaeological workers routinely classified Negroid remains as Mediterranean, even though they found such remains in substantial numbers with ancient artefacts.

Some Afrocentrists have adopted a pan-Africanist perspective that people of color are all &quot;African people&quot; or &quot;diasporic Africans,&quot; citing physical characteristics they exhibit in common with Black Africans. Afrocentric scholar Runoko Rashidi writes that they are all part of the &quot;global African community.&quot; Some Afrocentric writers include in the African diaspora the Dravidians of India, &quot;Negritos&quot; of Southeast Asia (Thailand, the Philippines and Malaysia); and the aboriginal peoples of Australia and Melanesia.

===Pre-Columbian Africa-Americas theories===

In the 1970s, Ivan van Sertima advanced the theory that the complex civilizations of the Americas were the result of trans-oceanic influence from the Egyptians or other African civilizations. Such a claim is his primary thesis in &quot;They Came Before Columbus&quot;, published in 1978. The few hyper-diffusionist writers seek to establish that the Olmec people, who built the first highly complex civilization in Mesoamerica and are considered by some to be the mother civilization for all other civilizations of Mesoamerica, were deeply influenced by Africans. Van Sertima said that the Olmec civilization was a hybrid one of Africans and Native Americans. His theory of pre-Columbian American-African contact has since met with considerable and detailed opposition by scholars of Mesoamerica. Van Sertima has been accused of &quot;doctoring&quot; and twisting data to fit his conclusions, inventing evidence, and ignoring the work of respected Central and South American scholars to advance his own theory. Mainstream historians of Mesoamerica overwhelmingly reject that view with detailed rebuttals.

Claims have been also forwarded contending that African civilizations were founding influences on the Chinese Xia cultures.

===Afrocentrism and Ancient Egypt===

Several Afrocentrists have claimed that important cultural characteristics of ancient Egypt were indigenous to Africa and that these features were present in other early African civilizations such as the later Kerma and the Meroitic civilizations of Nubia. Scholars who have held this view include Marcus Garvey, George James, Martin Bernal, Ivan van Sertima, John Henrik Clarke, and Molefi Kete Asante as well as the Afrocentrist writers Cheikh Anta Diop and Chancellor Williams. The claim has also been made by many Afrocentric scholars that the Ancient Egyptians themselves were Black African (sub-saharan African) rather than North African/Maghrebi, and that the various invasions on Egypt resulted in the &quot;Africanity&quot; of Ancient Egypt becoming diluted, resulting in the modern diversity seen today. Examining this view, Egyptologist Stuart Tyson Smith, wrote that &quot;Any characterization of race of the ancient Egyptians depends on modern cultural definitions, not on scientific study. Thus, by modern American standards it is reasonable to characterise the Egyptians as &#x27;black&#x27;, while acknowledging the scientific evidence for the physical diversity of Africans&quot;. Smith, however, expressed criticism of Egyptologists and Afrocentrists that defined ancient Egyptians &quot;as members of an essentialist racial category&quot; with perceived &quot;Caucasoid&quot; or &quot;Negroid/Africoid&quot; phenotypes&quot;.

As historian Ronald H. Fritze argued, mainstream Egyptologists and other scholars strongly object to Afrocentric Egyptology, viewing it as &quot;theurapetic mythology&quot; for black people, since it fails to provide sufficient evidence or persuasive interpretations to back up its claims.

Stephen Howe, professor in the history and cultures of colonialism at Bristol University, writes that contrary to &quot;Afrocentric speculation, depending on undocumented assertions that the relatively light-skinned people of the lower Nile today descend from Arab conquerors rather than earlier residents&quot;. Howe also cited a 1995 publication which stated &quot;the latest major synthetic work on African populations is firmly of the opinion that &quot;It was not the Arabs physically displaced Egyptians. Instead the Egyptians were transformed by relatively small number of immigrants bringing in new ideas, which, when disseminated, created a wider ethnic identity&quot;.

S.O.Y. Keita, a biological anthropologist and research affilitate at the Smithsonian Institution who has been described as sympathetic to Afrocentrism, but defined his position as that &quot;it is not a question of “African” “influence”; Ancient Egypt was organically African. Studying early Egypt in its African context is not “Afrocentric,” but simply correct&quot;. Keita has argued that the original inhabitants of the Nile Valley were primarily a variety of indigenous Northeast Africans from the areas of the desiccating Sahara and more southerly areas. He reviewed studies on the biological affinities of the Ancient Egyptian population and described the skeletal morphologies of early dynastic Egyptian remains as a &quot;Saharo-tropical African variant&quot;. He also noted that over time gene flow from the Near East and Europe added more genetic variability to the region. In 2022, Keita argued that some genetic studies have a &quot;default racialist or racist approach&quot; and should be interpreted in a framework with other sources of evidence. Several other academics, including Christopher Ehret, Fekri Hassan, 
Bruce Williams, Frank Yurco, Molefi Kete Asante, Lanny Bell and A.J. Boyce across various disciplines have contended that Ancient Egypt was fundamentally an African civilization, with cultural and biological connections to Egypt&#x27;s African neighbors.

Scholars have challenged the various assertions of Afrocentrists on the cultural and biological characteristics of Ancient Egyptian civilization and its people. At a UNESCO Symposium in the 1970s, some of the participants, including Jean Vercoutter, Serge Sauneron, Gunnar Säve-Söderbergh and Jean Leclant expressed &quot;profound&quot; disagreement with the &quot;Black&quot;, homogeneous hypothesis. Despite contestations, UNESCO decided to include his &quot;Origin of the ancient Egyptians&quot; in the General History of Africa, with an editorial comment mentioning the disagreement. However, Diop&#x27;s chapter was credited as a &quot;painstakingly researched contribution&quot; in the general conclusion of the symposium report by the International Scientific Committee&#x27;s Rapporteur, Professor Jean Devisse, which nevertheless lead to a &quot;real lack of balance&quot; in the discussion among participants. The ancient world did not employ racial categories such as &quot;Black&quot; or &quot;White&quot; as they had no conception of &quot;race&quot;, but rather labeled groups according to their land of origin and cultural traits. However, Keita studying the controversy, finds simplistic political appellations (in the negative or affirmative) describing ancient populations as &quot;black&quot; or &quot;white&quot; to be inaccurate and instead focuses on the ancestry of ancient Egypt as being a part of the native and diverse biological variation of Africa, which includes a variety of phenotypes and skin gradients.

Egyptian Egyptologist Zahi Hawass has gone on record as saying that the Ancient Egyptians were not black and “We believe that the origin of Ancient Egyptians was purely Egyptian based on the discovery made by British Egyptologist Flinders Petrie at Naqada, and this is why the Ancient Egyptian civilisation did not occur in Africa, it occurred only here”. In 2022, Hawass reiterated his view that &quot;Africans have nothing to do with the pyramids scientifically&quot; and stated that Africans &quot;ruled in Egypt in the late Era, at the time of the 25th dynasty&quot;. Hawass also accused some international figures of African descent that promoted Afrocentrism of racism and fabrication of Egyptian history.

In 2008, Stuart Tyson Smith expressed criticism of a facial reconstruction of Tutankhamun as &quot;very light-skinned&quot; which reflected &quot;bias&quot; and &quot;predictably and justifiably, it has provoked protests from Afrocentrists&quot; as &quot;Egyptologists have been strangely reluctant to admit that the ancient Egyptians were rather dark-skinned Africans, especially the farther south one goes&quot;.

In 2011, Stephen Quirke, professor of Egyptian Archaeology and Philology argued that the UNESCO-sponsored conference on the General History of Africa in 1974 &quot;did not change the Eurocentric climate of research&quot; and of the need to incorporate both African-centred studies and White European, academic perspectives. He later outlined that &quot;research conferences and publications on the history and language of Kemet [Egypt] remain dominated ... by those brought up and trained in European, not African societies and languages (which include Arabic)&quot;.

=== African-American Afrocentric &quot;hoteps&quot; and the far-right ===
African-Americans who use the Black Egyptian hypothesis as a source of black pride have been called &quot;the hoteps&quot; (after the Egyptian word &quot;hotep&quot;). The term has often been used disparagingly by non-hotep African-Americans, some of whom have linked the ideology of the hotep community – which is anti-feminist, anti-gay and anti-Semitic – to the far-right. Hoteps have been described as promoting false histories and misinformation about black people and black history. Some have argued hotep beliefs are too narrow-minded (focusing only on Egypt as opposed to other aspects of African history), and black feminists argue that hoteps perpetuate rape culture by policing women&#x27;s sexuality and not criticizing predatory black men.

===Alkebulan===
Among Afrocentrists the name &#x27;Alkebulan&#x27; (also spelled &#x27;Al Kebulan&#x27; or &#x27;Alkebu Lan&#x27;) is sometimes used a replacement for &#x27;Africa.&#x27; Users often erroneously claim that it derives from the Arabic for &#x27;Land of the Blacks&#x27; (in reality &quot;Bilad as-Sudan&quot;), or alternatively that it comes from one or more indigenous African languages and means &#x27;Garden of Life&#x27; or &#x27;Motherland&#x27;. The earliest record of the term &#x27;Alkebulan&#x27; is the introduction to an 1813 Spanish poem celebrating the defenders of Zaragoza, in which the author claimed an Arabic origin of the term. In the 20th century it was popularized by Yosef Ben-Jochannan, though this is sometimes incorrectly credited to Cheikh Anta Diop in a non-existent book called “The Kemetic History of Afrika”.

==Reception==

Afrocentrism has encountered opposition from mainstream scholars who charge it with historical inaccuracy, scholarly ineptitude, and racism.

Yaacov Shavit, a critic of the movement, summarises its goals in the preface to his book &quot;History in Black&quot;, in which he states:

Other critics, such as Mary Lefkowitz, contend that the Afrocentric historical approach is entrenched in myth and fantasy. She argues that Afrocentrism is grounded in identity politics and myth rather than sound scholarship. In &quot;The Skeptic&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;, philosophy professor Robert Todd Carroll labeled Afrocentrism &quot;pseudohistorical&quot;. He argued that Afrocentrism&#x27;s prime goal was to encourage black nationalism and ethnic pride in order to effectively combat the destructive consequences of cultural and universal racism. Professor of history Clarence E. Walker has described Afrocentrism as &quot;a mythology that is racist, reactionary, essentially therapeutic&quot; and &quot;Eurocentrism in black face.&quot;

Classicist Mary Lefkowitz rejects George James&#x27;s theories about Egyptian contributions to Greek civilization as being faulty scholarship. She writes that ancient Egyptian texts show little similarity to Greek philosophy. Lefkowitz states that Aristotle could not have stolen his ideas from the great Library at Alexandria as James suggested, because the library was founded after Aristotle&#x27;s death. On the basis of such errors, Lefkowitz calls Afrocentrism &quot;an excuse to teach myth as history.&quot; Mary Lefkowitz in 1997 whilst criticising elements of Afrocentrism had acknowledged that the origins of the ancient Egyptians were more clear due to the &quot;recent evidence on skeletons and DNA [which] suggests that the people who settled in the Nile valley, like all of humankind, came from somewhere south of the Sahara; they were not (as some nineteenth-century scholars had supposed) invaders from the North.&quot;

In 2002, Ibrahim Sundiata wrote in the &quot;American Historical Review&quot; that:

Literature and languages scholar Cain Hope Felder, a supporter of Afrocentric ideas, has warned Afrocentrists to avoid certain pitfalls, including:
* Demonizing categorically all white people, without careful differentiation between persons of goodwill and those who consciously perpetuate racism.
* Adopting multiculturalism as a curricular alternative that eliminates, marginalizes, or vilifies European heritage to the point that Europe epitomizes all the evil in the world.
* Gross over-generalizations and using factually or incorrect material is bad history and bad scholarship.

Nathan Glazer writes that although Afrocentricity can mean many things, the popular press has generally given most attention to its most outlandish theories. Glazer agrees with many of the findings and conclusions presented in Lefkowitz&#x27;s book &quot;Not Out of Africa&quot;. Yet he also argues that Afrocentrism often presents legitimate and relevant scholarship. The late Manning Marable was also a critic of Afrocentrism. He wrote:

Some Afrocentrists agree in rejecting those works which critics have characterized as examples of bad scholarship. Adisa A. Alkebulan states that the work of Afrocentric scholars is not fully appreciated because critics use the claims of &quot;a few non-Afrocentrists&quot; as &quot;an indictment against Afrocentricity.&quot;

In 1996, the historian August Meier critically reviewed the new work of Mary Lefkowitz on Afrocentrism as &quot;Eurocentric&quot;. He criticized her book &quot;Not Out of Africa: How Afrocentrism Became an Excuse to Teach Myth as History&quot; for what he saw as her neglect of the African-American historic literature of the 19th and 20th centuries. Meier believes she fails to take the African-American experiences into account, to the extent that she &quot;fails to answer the question raised in this book&#x27;s subtitle.&quot;

Maghan Keita describes the controversy over Afrocentrism as a cultural war.

<text>Coleman Randolph Hawkins (November 21, 1904 – May 19, 1969), nicknamed &quot;Hawk&quot; and sometimes &quot;Bean&quot;, was an American jazz tenor saxophonist. One of the first prominent jazz musicians on his instrument, as Joachim E. Berendt explained: &quot;there were some tenor players before him, but the instrument was not an acknowledged jazz horn&quot;. Hawkins biographer John Chilton described the prevalent styles of tenor saxophone solos prior to Hawkins as &quot;mooing&quot; and &quot;rubbery belches&quot;. Hawkins denied being first and noted his contemporaries Happy Caldwell, Stump Evans, and Prince Robinson, although he was the first to tailor his method of improvisation to the saxophone rather than imitate the techniques of the clarinet. Hawkins&#x27; virtuosic, arpeggiated approach to improvisation, with his characteristic rich, emotional, and vibrato-laden tonal style, was the main influence on a generation of tenor players that included Chu Berry, Charlie Barnet, Tex Beneke, Ben Webster, Vido Musso, Herschel Evans, Buddy Tate, and Don Byas, and through them the later tenormen, Arnett Cobb, Illinois Jacquet, Flip Phillips, Ike Quebec, Al Sears, Paul Gonsalves, and Lucky Thompson. While Hawkins became known with swing music during the big band era, he had a role in the development of bebop in the 1940s.

Fellow saxophonist Lester Young, known as the &quot;President of the Tenor Saxophone&quot;, commented, in a 1959 interview with &quot;The Jazz Review&quot;: &quot;As far as I&#x27;m concerned, I think Coleman Hawkins was the president, first, right? As far as myself, I think I&#x27;m the second one.&quot; Miles Davis once said: &quot;When I heard Hawk, I learned to play ballads.&quot;

==Early life==
Hawkins was born in Saint Joseph, Missouri, United States, in 1904. He was named Coleman after his mother Cordelia&#x27;s maiden name. There is record of Hawkins&#x27; parents&#x27; first child, a girl, being born in 1901 and dying at the age of two. 
At age four, Hawkins began to study the piano, then the cello at age seven, before switching to the saxophone by age nine. By the age of fourteen, he was playing around eastern Kansas. He attended high school in Chicago, then in Topeka, Kansas, at Topeka High School. He later stated that he studied harmony and composition for two years at Washburn College in Topeka while still attending high school.

The origin of Hawkins&#x27; nickname, &quot;Bean&quot;, is not clear. Theories around the nickname&#x27;s basis include a reference to Hawkins&#x27; head shape, his frugality (saying &quot;I haven&#x27;t a bean&quot;) or due to his immense knowledge of chords.

==Later life and career==
===1921–1939===

Hawkins&#x27;s first significant gig was with Mamie Smith&#x27;s Jazz Hounds in 1921, and he was with the band full-time from April 1922 to 1923, when he settled in New York City. In the Jazz Hounds, he coincided with Garvin Bushell, Everett Robbins, Bubber Miley and Herb Flemming. Hawkins joined Fletcher Henderson&#x27;s Orchestra, where he remained until 1934, sometimes doubling on clarinet and bass saxophone. Hawkins&#x27;s playing changed significantly during Louis Armstrong&#x27;s tenure with the Henderson Orchestra (1924–25). In the late 1920s, Hawkins participated in some of the earliest integrated recording sessions with the Mound City Blue Blowers. During his time with Henderson, he became a star soloist with increasing prominence on records. While with the band, he and Henry &quot;Red&quot; Allen recorded a series of small group sides for ARC (on their Perfect, Melotone, Romeo, and Oriole labels). Hawkins also recorded a number of solo recordings with either piano or a pick-up band of Henderson&#x27;s musicians in 1933–34, just prior to his period in Europe. He was also featured on a Benny Goodman session on February 2, 1934 for Columbia, which also featured Mildred Bailey as guest vocalist.

In late 1934, Hawkins accepted an invitation to play with Jack Hylton&#x27;s orchestra in London, and toured Europe as a soloist until 1939, performing and recording with Django Reinhardt and Benny Carter in Paris in 1937. During Hawkins&#x27; time touring Europe between 1934 and 1939, attention in the U.S. shifted to other tenor saxophonists, including Lester Young, Ben Webster, and Chu Berry. Following his return to the United States, he quickly re-established himself as one of the leading figures on the instrument by adding innovations to his earlier style.

On October 11, 1939, he recorded a two-chorus performance of the standard &quot;Body and Soul&quot;, which he had been performing at Bert Kelly&#x27;s New York venue, Kelly&#x27;s Stables. In a landmark recording of the swing era, captured as an afterthought at the session, Hawkins ignores almost all of the melody, with only the first four bars stated in a recognizable fashion. Hawkins&#x27; departure from the melodic themes of the tune, use of upper chord intervals, and implied passing chords in that recording have been described as &quot;one of the early tremors of bebop&quot;.

Loren Schoenberg, Director of National Jazz Museum in Harlem, states that “no matter how nonchalantly Hawkins tried to make the choice to record &quot;Body And Soul&quot; seem, it had long been his encore during his European years, and he had a lot riding on this session. Lester Young was at his zenith with the Basie band, and virtually all of the other major bands had a Hawkins-styled tenor in a featured position. The decades as a musical omnivore came to fruition as he signaled to pianist Gene Rodgers to make an introduction in Db. The sounds of Bach, Tatum, Armstrong, and the untold musicians who had filled his head and ears culminated in one of the greatest spontaneous set of variations ever recorded&quot;.

===The 1940s and 1950s===

After a brief period in 1940 leading a big band, Hawkins led small groups at Kelly&#x27;s Stables on Manhattan&#x27;s 52nd Street. During 1944, He recorded in small and large groups for the Keynote, Savoy, and Apollo labels. Hawkins always had a keen ear for new talent and styles, and he was the leader on what is generally considered to have been the first ever bebop recording session on February 16, 1944 including Dizzy Gillespie, Don Byas, Clyde Hart, Oscar Pettiford, and Max Roach. On October 19, 1944, he led another bebop recording session with Thelonious Monk on piano, Edward Robinson on bass, and Denzil Best on drums.

Given his love of Bach and Pablo Casals and his own unquenchable thirst for self-expression, it was inevitable that Hawkins would move towards solo performances. During his European tour, he began surrounding his songs with unaccompanied introductions and codas. In January 1945 he recorded &quot;Solo Sessions.&quot; Harry Lim, a Javanese jazz lover who came to America in 1939, first produced jam sessions in Chicago and New York and then founded Keynote Records, a premier small jazz label. In an article for &quot;Metronome&quot; magazine in May, 1944, Lim dubbed Hawkins “the Picasso of Jazz”.

In 1945, he recorded extensively with small groups with Best and either Robinson or Pettiford on bass, Sir Charles Thompson on piano, Allan Reuss on guitar, Howard McGhee on trumpet, and Vic Dickenson on trombone, in sessions reflecting a highly individual style with an indifference toward the categories of &quot;modern&quot; and &quot;traditional&quot; jazz. That general period saw him recording with such diverse stylists as Sid Catlett, Tyree Glenn, Hilton Jefferson (a Fletcher Henderson colleague), Hank Jones, Billy Taylor, J. J. Johnson and Fats Navarro. He also toured with Jazz at the Philharmonic (JATP). Hawkins divided his time between New York and Europe, making numerous freelance recordings.

In the 1950s, Hawkins performed with musicians such as Red Allen and Roy Eldridge, with whom he appeared at the 1957 Newport Jazz Festival and recorded &quot;Coleman Hawkins Encounters Ben Webster&quot; with fellow tenor saxophonist Ben Webster along with Oscar Peterson, Herb Ellis, Ray Brown, and Alvin Stoller. His 1957 album &quot;The Hawk Flies High&quot;, with Idrees Sulieman, J. J. Johnson, Hank Jones, Barry Galbraith, Oscar Pettiford, and Jo Jones, shows his interest in modern jazz styles, during a period better known for his playing with more traditional musicians.

Hawkins&#x27; interest in more modern styles manifested in a reunion with Monk, with whom he had remained close even though they had not played together for over a decade. Monk led a June 1957 session featuring Hawkins and John Coltrane, that yielded &quot;Monk&#x27;s Music&quot;, issued later that summer. Outtakes from this session comprised half of the tracks on &quot;Thelonious Monk with John Coltrane&quot;, released on the Jazzland Records subsidiary of Riverside Records in 1961.

===1960–1969===
In the 1960s, Hawkins appeared regularly at the Village Vanguard in Manhattan. In 1960, he participated in the recording of Max Roach&#x27;s &quot;We Insist!&quot; suite, part of the political and social linkages developing between jazz and the civil rights movement. At the behest of Impulse Records producer Bob Thiele, Hawkins availed himself of a long-desired opportunity to record with Duke Ellington for the 1962 album &quot;Duke Ellington Meets Coleman Hawkins&quot;, alongside Ellington band members Johnny Hodges, Lawrence Brown, Ray Nance, and Harry Carney as well as the Duke. Sessions for Impulse with his performing quartet yielded &quot;Today and Now&quot;, also in 1962 and judged one of his better latter-day efforts by &quot;The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings&quot;. Hawkins recorded in 1963 alongside Sonny Rollins for their collaborative album &quot;Sonny Meets Hawk!&quot;, for RCA Victor.

It was shortly after this busy period that Hawkins fell into the grip of depression and heavy drinking and his recording output began to wane. His last recording was in 1967; Hawkins died of liver disease on May 19, 1969, at Wickersham Hospital, in Manhattan. He was survived by his widow, Dolores, who died in 2010, and by three children: a son, Rene, and two daughters, Colette and Mimi. Hawkins is interred in the Yew Plot at the Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City.

&quot;The Song of the Hawk&quot;, a 1990 biography written by British jazz historian John Chilton, chronicles Hawkins&#x27;s career.

<text>Straight Outta Compton is the debut studio album by American gangsta rap group N.W.A, which, led by Eazy-E, formed in Los Angeles County&#x27;s City of Compton in early 1987. Released by his label, Ruthless Records, on January 25, 1989, the album was produced by N.W.A members Dr. Dre, DJ Yella, and Arabian Prince, with lyrics written by N.W.A members Ice Cube and MC Ren along with Ruthless rapper and unofficial member The D.O.C. Not merely depicting Compton&#x27;s street violence, the lyrics repeatedly threaten to lead it by attacking peers and even police. The track &quot;Fuck tha Police&quot; drew an FBI agent&#x27;s warning letter, which aided N.W.A&#x27;s notoriety, with N.W.A calling itself &quot;the world&#x27;s most dangerous group.&quot;

In July 1989, despite its scarce radio play beyond the Los Angeles area, &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; received gangsta rap&#x27;s first platinum certification, one million copies sold by then. That year, the album peaked at number 9 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, and at number 37 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Receiving media spotlight, N.W.A&#x27;s example triggered the rap genre&#x27;s movement toward hardcore, gangsta rap.

Remastered, the album&#x27;s September 2000 reissue gained four bonus tracks. Nearing the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary, another extended version of it arrived in December 2007. In 2015, after an album reissue on red cassettes, theater release of the biographical film &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; reinvigorated sales of the album, which by year&#x27;s end was certified 3x Multi-Platinum. In 2016, it became the first rap album inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. The next year, the Library of Congress enshrined &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; in the National Recording Registry, who have deemed it to be &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Background==
For most of the 1980s, New York City, the birthplace of hip-hop, remained the rap genre&#x27;s dominant scene. Los Angeles County was secondary. Until 1988, the Los Angeles hip-hop scene, retaining more of hip-hop&#x27;s dance and party origin, prioritized DJs and DJ crews as the central players in hip-hop; the prevailing style at the time was electro rap and &quot;funk hop&quot;, similar to the New York-based 1982 hit &quot;Planet Rock&quot;. By contrast, East Coast hip-hop had moved to prioritizing the lyricist (or &quot;MC&quot;) after the success of Run-DMC&#x27;s self-titled 1984 album.

As the 1980s continued, it became increasingly popular to record lyrics on top of electro rap music. The World Class Wreckin&#x27; Cru, which included Dr. Dre and DJ Yella, published the West Coast&#x27;s first rap album to be released under a major record label. Also among LA&#x27;s rising lyricists was Ice-T. Inspired by Philadelphia rapper Schoolly D&#x27;s 1985 single &quot;P.S.K. What Does It Mean?&quot; Ice-T released the track &quot;6 in the Mornin&#x27;&quot; in 1986. This song began to pull the Los Angeles scene&#x27;s attention away from electro rap; it reached gold sales and inaugurated a new rap subgenre, later called &quot;gangsta rap&quot;.

In 1986, Eric Wright, a Kelly Park Compton Crip, formed Ruthless Records, an independent record label based in Compton. Through drug dealing, Wright had become acquainted with Dr. Dre and Arabian Prince, a pair of locally successful record producers and recording artists who were struggling to receive royalties. Wright recruited the South Central Los Angeles-based rapper Ice Cube, then a member of rap group C.I.A., as a ghostwriter, and instructed him to collaborate with Dr. Dre and write a song for the label. The resulting track was &quot;Boyz-n-the-Hood&quot;. This song was originally intended to be performed by a New York-based group who were signed to Ruthless Records; however, after that group rejected the song, Wright adopted the stage name Eazy-E and performed the rapping himself. Released under the name N.W.A, &quot;Boyz-n-the-Hood&quot; became a local hit, despite criticism that it sounded similar to Schoolly D&#x27;s &quot;P.S.K.&quot; single, and that its tempo was too slow to dance to.

Expanding upon Ice-T&#x27;s model, N.W.A imparted to gangsta rap a signature style that featured &quot;exaggerated descriptions of street life, militant resistance to authority, and outright sexist violence&quot;. N.W.A further strove to secure radio play by supplying radio edits of their music to local stations such as KDAY. Despite these efforts, N.W.A&#x27;s national debut, &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot;, saw virtually no radio play; even so, the album was hugely successful, selling one million copies and becoming the first gangsta rap album to be certified platinum. As rap fans, even from afar, sought more from Compton and South Central, local rappers, like MC Eiht of Compton&#x27;s Most Wanted, met the call. The Los Angeles rap scene rapidly moved from party rap to hardcore rap.

On the global stage, N.W.A towered as gangsta rap&#x27;s icons. The group&#x27;s profane, unrelentingly violent lyrics led to backlash from law enforcement and other groups: an FBI agent sent the record label a warning letter, MTV banned the &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; video, some venues banned N.W.A performance, and some police officers refused to work security at N.W.A shows elsewhere. The controversy served to further bolster N.W.A&#x27;s anti-establishment image, and so the rappers would highlight it themselves in later tracks.

&quot;Slant Magazine&quot; describes &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; as laying the foundation for the East Coast–West Coast hip-hop rivalry, referring to the album as &quot;the West Coast firing on New York&#x27;s Fort Sumter in what would become &#x27;90s culture&#x27;s biggest Uncivil War.&quot;

==Record production==
The album was recorded and produced in Audio Achievements Studio in Torrance, California for $12,000. Dr. Dre, in a 1993 interview, recalls, &quot;I threw that thing together in six weeks so we could have something to sell out of the trunk.

In an incident recalled in Jerry Heller&#x27;s book and later portrayed in the film &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot;, police approached the group while they were standing outside the studio in 1988 and demanded them to get on their knees and show ID without explanation. Outraged by the experience, Cube began writing the lyrics that would become &quot;Fuck tha Police.&quot; Initially, still spending weekends in jail over traffic violations, Dre was reluctant to do &quot;Fuck tha Police&quot;, a reluctance that dissolved once that sentence concluded.

===Synthesis===
The album&#x27;s producers were Dr. Dre with DJ Yella and Arabian Prince. Its production was mostly sampled horn blasts, some funk guitar riffs, sampled vocals, and turntable scratches atop a drum machine. Their drum machine, used for kick, was the Roland TR-808.

=== Vocals ===
N.W.A&#x27;s Ice Cube and MC Ren along with Ruthless Records rapper The D.O.C. wrote the lyrics, including those rapped by Eazy-E and by Dr. Dre. On the other hand, DJ Yella never raps, and Arabian Prince does only minor vocals on &quot;Something 2 Dance 2&quot;. Otherwise, each group member stands out through a solo rap, too.

MC Ren has two solo tracks, &quot;If It Ain&#x27;t Ruff&quot; and &quot;Quiet on tha Set&quot;. Dr. Dre dominates &quot;Express Yourself&quot;. Ice Cube&#x27;s is &quot;I Ain&#x27;t tha 1&quot;. Eazy-E&#x27;s is a remix of &quot;8 Ball&quot;, a track which originally appeared on N.W.A&#x27;s 1987 debut compilation album &quot;N.W.A. and the Posse&quot;. The one guest is The D.O.C., who raps the opening verse of &quot;Parental Discretion Iz Advised&quot;.

Whereas Ren wrote his own lyrics, and The D.O.C. wrote many of Eazy&#x27;s lyrics, Cube wrote his lyrics, and both Dre&#x27;s and Eazy&#x27;s as well. Still, even Eazy and Dre, alike Cube and Ren, each brings a distinct delivery and character, making N.W.A altogether stand out from imitators.

===Content===
Reflecting in 2002, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writer Jon Caramanica calls the album a &quot;bombastic, cacophonous car ride through Los Angeles&#x27; burnt-out and ignored hoods&quot;. In a contemporary review, rather, Mark Holmberg, in the &quot;Richmond Times-Dispatch&quot;, calls it &quot;a preacher-provoking, mother-maddening, reality-stinks&quot; album that &quot;wallows in gangs, doping, drive-by shootings, brutal sexism, cop slamming and racism&quot;. &quot;Newsweek&quot; wrote, &quot;Hinting at gang roots, and selling themselves on those hints, they project a gangster mystique that pays no attention to where criminality begins and marketing lets off.&quot; Even when depicting severe and unprovoked violence, the rappers cite their own stage names as its very perpetrators. By their sheer force, the album&#x27;s opening three tracks—&quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot;, &quot;Fuck tha Police&quot;, and &quot;Gangsta Gangsta&quot;—signature songs setting N.W.A&#x27;s platform, says AllMusic album reviewer Steve Huey, &quot;threaten to dwarf everything that follows&quot;.

First, the title track, smearing and menacing civilians and police, men and women, while women receive gruff sexual advances, too, even threatens to &quot;smother your mother&quot;. Then, after a skit of the police put on criminal trial, &quot;Fuck tha Police&quot;, alleging chronic harassment and brutality by officers, singularly threatens lethal retaliation. &quot;Gangsta Gangsta&quot; depicts group outings to carouse with women while slurring unwilling women and assaulting men, whether confrontational troublemakers, innocent bystanders, or a driver who, fleeing the failed carjacking, gets shot at. &quot;8 Ball&quot; is dedicated to the 40 oz bottles of malt liquor, Olde English 800. &quot;Express Yourself&quot;, written by Cube and rapped by Dre, incidentally scorns weed smoking—already proclaimed by Cube in &quot;Gangsta Gangsta&quot; as his own, chronic practice—which allegedly causes brain damage, a threat to the song&#x27;s optimistic agenda, liberal individuality. &quot;I Ain&#x27;t tha 1&quot; scorns spending money on women. &quot;Dopeman&quot; depicts the crack epidemic&#x27;s aftermath. Closing the album, &quot;Something 2 Dance 2&quot; is upbeat.

The term &quot;gangsta rap&quot;, soon to arise in journalism, had not been coined yet. According to Ice Cube, the rappers themselves called it &quot;reality rap&quot;. Indicting N.W.A as its leading example, journalist David Mills, in 1990, acknowledges, &quot;The hard-core street rappers defend their violent lyrics as a reflection of &#x27;reality&#x27;. But for all the gunshots they mix into their music, rappers rarely try to dramatize that reality&quot; empathetically. &quot;It&#x27;s easier for them to imagine themselves pulling the trigger.&quot; Still, the year before, Bud Norman, reviewing in the &quot;Wichita Eagle-Beacon&quot;, assesses that on &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot;, &quot;they don&#x27;t make it sound like much fun&quot;. In Norman&#x27;s view, &quot;They describe it with the same nonjudgmental resignation that a Kansan might use about a tornado.&quot; Steve Huey, writing for AllMusic, considered that &quot;&quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; insistent claims of reality ring a little hollow today, since it hardly ever depicts consequences. But despite all the romanticized invincibility, the force and detail of Ice Cube&#x27;s writing makes the exaggerations resonate.&quot;

N.W.A&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, released in July 1996, featured six tracks from &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot;: &quot;Gangsta Gangsta&quot;, &quot;If It Ain&#x27;t Ruff&quot;, &quot;I Ain&#x27;t tha 1&quot;, &quot;Express Yourself&quot;, an extended mix of &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot;, and &quot;Fuck tha Police&quot;, which is absent from &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot;&#x27;s censored version.

==Release==
In the United Kingdom, the album was released by 4th &amp; B&#x27;way Records after a period that Roy Wilkinson of &quot;Sounds&quot; described as &quot;months&quot; of selling well as an import release.

==Critical reception==
===Critiques===
Music journalist Greg Kot, reviewing &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, finds N.W.A&#x27;s sound &quot;fuller and funkier&quot; than that of East Coast hip-hop, and their lyrics just as &quot;unforgiving&quot; as those of East Coast group Public Enemy. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Dennis Hunt anticipates that listeners may be offended by the album&#x27;s lack of &quot;moralizing&quot;, &quot;even more so than the searing street language&quot;, and advises, &quot;To appreciate this remarkable, disturbing album you have to approach it for what it is—a no-holds-barred, audio-documentary of ghetto life.&quot; On the other hand, Cary Darling, in California&#x27;s &quot;Orange County Register&quot;, while thinking that the lyrics make Ice-T &quot;look like a Cub Scout&quot;, ultimately deems &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; &quot;curiously uninvolving&quot;, as it &quot;lacks the insight and passion that put the best work by the likes of Boogie Down Productions, Ice-T and Public Enemy so far ahead of the field&quot;. Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; perceives N.W.A&#x27;s persona as calculated: &quot;Right, it&#x27;s not about salary—it&#x27;s about royalties, about brandishing scarewords like &#x27;street&#x27; and &#x27;crazy&#x27; and &#x27;fuck&#x27; and &#x27;reality&#x27; until suckers black and white cough up the cash.&quot;

In the UK, &quot;Sounds&quot; reviewer Roy Wilkinson declared &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; &quot;rap&#x27;s answer to Slayer&#x27;s &quot;Reign in Blood&quot;—a record the majors were scared to touch&quot;, continuing, &quot;This is rock made genuinely wild again. Beware, the pop jive of the current &#x27;Express Yourself&#x27; single will in no way prepare you for the Magnum beat that fires here.&quot; Other British publications were less enthusiastic. Paolo Hewitt of &quot;NME&quot; takes issue with the lyrics&#x27; &quot;macho repetition and tunnel vision&quot;, while in the &quot;Hi-Fi News &amp; Record Review&quot;, Peter Clark, going further, calls the lyrics &quot;unrelenting in their unpleasantness&quot;. Offering the lowest possible rating, Clark adds, &quot;The cumulative effect is like listening to an endless fight next door. The music on this record is without a hint of dynamics or melody.&quot; Charlie Dick, writing for &quot;Q&quot;, contends, &quot;In the wake of Public Enemy and KRS-One, it is amazing that something this lightweight could cause such a stir. The all-mouth-and-trousers content is backed up by likable drum machine twittering, minimal instrumentation and duffish production.&quot; Still, he predicts, &quot;This regressive nonsense will be passed off as social commentary by thrill-seekers all across the free world.&quot;

By 1991, while criticizing group members for allegedly carrying misogynist lyrics into real life, &quot;Newsweek&quot; incidentally comments that &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot;, nonetheless, &quot;introduced some of the most grotesquely exciting music ever made&quot;. Writing in retrospect, Steve Huey, in AllMusic, deems the album mainly just &quot;raising hell&quot; while posturing, but finds that &quot;it still sounds refreshingly uncalculated because of its irreverent, gonzo sense of humor, still unfortunately rare in hardcore rap&quot;. In the 2004 &quot;Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, Roni Sarig states that although &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; was viewed as a &quot;perversion&quot; of the &quot;more politically sophisticated&quot; style of hip-hop exemplified by Public Enemy, the album displays &quot;a more righteous fury than the hundreds of copycats it spawned&quot;.

===Rankings===
In 1994, British magazine &quot;Hip Hop Connection&quot;, placing the album third among rap&#x27;s best albums, adds, &quot;&quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; sounded so exciting, insignificant details such as realism and integrity could be overlooked.&quot; Hip-hop magazine &quot;The Source&quot; included &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; in its 1998 &quot;100 Best Albums&quot; list. Television network VH1, in 2003, placed it 62nd. &quot;Spin&quot; magazine, sorting the &quot;100 Greatest Albums, 1985–2005&quot;, identified it 10th.

The first rap album ever to gain five stars from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; at initial review, it placed 70th among the magazine&#x27;s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time in its 2020 revised list. &quot;Time&quot;, in 2006, named it one of the 100 greatest albums of all time. &quot;Vibe&quot; appraised it as one of the 100 Essential Albums of the 20th Century. In 2012, &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; listed it 18th among the &quot;Best Albums of the 1980s&quot;. In any case, in November 2016, &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; became the first rap album inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. In 2017, &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress, who deemed it to be &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
Released on January 25, 1989, &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; was N.W.A&#x27;s best selling album; it attained gold certification, half a million copies sold, three months after its release. Meanwhile, the album peaked at number 9 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, and on April 15, 1989, at number 37 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, which ranks the week&#x27;s most popular albums. On July 18, 1989, the album was certified platinum, one million copies sold.

By contrast, &quot;N.W.A. and the Posse&quot;, out since November 1987, reached gold certification in September 1994. The group&#x27;s &quot;100 Miles and Runnin&#x27;&quot; EP, which took a year to produce and was released in August 1990, went platinum in September 1992. That year, on March 27, &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; was certified double-platinum, two million copies sold.

By Priority Records&#x27; estimation, about 80% of &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot;&#x27;s sales occurred in suburban areas predominantly white. N.W.A&#x27;s next and final full-length album, &quot;Efil4zaggin&quot; or &quot;Niggaz4Life&quot;, released on May 28, 1991, went platinum just over two months later, in August 1991, yet in 2020 remains platinum, whereas on November 11, 2015, &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; was certified triple-platinum, three million copies sold.

Approaching the August 2015 release of the film &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot;, the album reentered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number 173. The next week, it rose to number 97, another week later reached number 30—beyond its 1989 peak position of #37—and on September 5 peaked at number 6. Meanwhile, the album&#x27;s title track, entering the popular songs chart, the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, becoming N.W.A&#x27;s first song in the Top 40, spent two weeks at number 38.

==Media presence==
In 2004, the &quot;DigitaArts&quot; list 25 Best Albums Covers included &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot;. By the album&#x27;s release, Arabian Prince, on the cover, had left N.W.A. Lacking him, an iconic group photo taken by Ithaka Darin Pappas on November 11, 1988, at Pappa&#x27;s studio apartment in Los Angeles&#x27; Miracle Mile district, has been repeatedly republished in media, including &quot;The Source&quot; May 1989 cover, captioning, &quot;California Rap Hits Nationwide!&quot; Pappas calls it the &quot;Miracle Mile Shot&quot;, the DVD cover of the 2015 documentary &quot;Kings Of Compton&quot;, in France&#x27;s Musée d&#x27;art contemporain de Marseille from 2017 to 2018, and a backdrop at N.W.A&#x27;s Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony in 2016 in Brooklyn, New York.

Sinéad O&#x27;Connor, then herself controversial, appraised in 1990 that &quot;It&#x27;s definitely the best rap record I&#x27;ve ever heard&quot;. But, feeling that he had rushed its production, N.W.A&#x27;s own Dr. Dre, in a 1993 interview, remarked, &quot;To this day, I can&#x27;t stand that album. I threw that thing together in six weeks so we could have something to sell out of the trunk.” Additionally, he said, “Back then, I thought the choruses were supposed to just be me scratching.” In 2006, parodic music artist &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic released a new album, &quot;Straight Outta Lynwood&quot;. Punk rock band NOFX released the 2009 song &quot;Straight Outta Massachusetts&quot;. In the 2014 film &quot;22 Jump Street&quot;, the character Mrs. Dickson, whose husband is played by Ice Cube, says she&#x27;s &quot;straight outta Compton&quot;. In 2015, the biopic &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; was a hit film.

<text>In probability theory and statistics, the moment-generating function of a real-valued random variable is an alternative specification of its probability distribution. Thus, it provides the basis of an alternative route to analytical results compared with working directly with probability density functions or cumulative distribution functions. There are particularly simple results for the moment-generating functions of distributions defined by the weighted sums of random variables. However, not all random variables have moment-generating functions.

As its name implies, the moment-generating function can be used to compute a distribution’s moments: the -th moment about 0 is the -th derivative of the moment-generating function, evaluated at 0.

In addition to real-valued distributions (univariate distributions), moment-generating functions can be defined for vector- or matrix-valued random variables, and can even be extended to more general cases.

The moment-generating function of a real-valued distribution does not always exist, unlike the characteristic function. There are relations between the behavior of the moment-generating function of a distribution and properties of the distribution, such as the existence of moments.

==Definition==
Let formula_1 be a random variable with CDF formula_2. The moment generating function (mgf) of formula_3 (or formula_2), denoted by formula_5, is

formula_6

provided this expectation exists for formula_7 in some open neighborhood of 0. That is, there is an formula_8 such that for all formula_7 in formula_10, formula_11 exists. If the expectation does not exist in an open neighborhood of 0, we say that the moment generating function does not exist.

In other words, the moment-generating function of &quot;X&quot; is the expectation of the random variable formula_12. More generally, when formula_13, an formula_14-dimensional random vector, and formula_15 is a fixed vector, one uses formula_16 instead of 
formula_17

formula_18 always exists and is equal to 1. However, a key problem with moment-generating functions is that moments and the moment-generating function may not exist, as the integrals need not converge absolutely. By contrast, the characteristic function or Fourier transform always exists (because it is the integral of a bounded function on a space of finite measure), and for some purposes may be used instead.

The moment-generating function is so named because it can be used to find the moments of the distribution. The series expansion of formula_19 is

formula_20

Hence

formula_21

where formula_22 is the formula_14th moment. Differentiating formula_5 formula_25 times with respect to formula_7 and setting formula_27, we obtain the formula_25th moment about the origin, formula_29;
see Calculations of moments below.

If formula_3 is a continuous random variable, the following relation between its moment-generating function formula_5 and the two-sided Laplace transform of its probability density function formula_32 holds:

formula_33

since the PDF&#x27;s two-sided Laplace transform is given as

formula_34

and the moment-generating function&#x27;s definition expands (by the law of the unconscious statistician) to
formula_35

This is consistent with the characteristic function of formula_3 being a Wick rotation of formula_5 when the moment generating function exists, as the characteristic function of a continuous random variable formula_3 is the Fourier transform of its probability density function formula_32, and in general when a function formula_40 is of exponential order, the Fourier transform of formula_41 is a Wick rotation of its two-sided Laplace transform in the region of convergence. See the relation of the Fourier and Laplace transforms for further information.

==Examples==
Here are some examples of the moment-generating function and the characteristic function for comparison. It can be seen that the characteristic function is a Wick rotation of the moment-generating function formula_5 when the latter exists.
&lt;/math&gt;
|Multivariate Cauchy

|Does not exist
|formula_44

==Calculation==
The moment-generating function is the expectation of a function of the random variable, it can be written as:

* For a discrete probability mass function, formula_45
* For a continuous probability density function, formula_46
* In the general case: formula_47, using the Riemann–Stieltjes integral, and where formula_48 is the cumulative distribution function. This is simply the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of formula_48, but with the sign of the argument reversed.

Note that for the case where formula_3 has a continuous probability density function formula_40, formula_52 is the two-sided Laplace transform of formula_40.

formula_54

where formula_22 is the formula_14th moment.

===Linear transformations of random variables ===
If random variable formula_3 has moment generating function formula_5, then formula_59 has moment generating function formula_60

formula_61

===Linear combination of independent random variables===
If formula_62, where the &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot; are independent random variables and the &quot;a&quot;&quot;i&quot; are constants, then the probability density function for &quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot; is the convolution of the probability density functions of each of the &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot;, and the moment-generating function for &quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot; is given by

formula_63
===Vector-valued random variables===
For vector-valued random variables formula_64 with real components, the moment-generating function is given by

formula_65

where formula_15 is a vector and formula_67 is the dot product.

==Important properties==

Moment generating functions are positive and log-convex, with &quot;M&quot;(0) = 1.

An important property of the moment-generating function is that it uniquely determines the distribution. In other words, if formula_3 and formula_69 are two random variables and for all values of ,

formula_70

then

formula_71

for all values of &quot;x&quot; (or equivalently &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; have the same distribution). This statement is not equivalent to the statement &quot;if two distributions have the same moments, then they are identical at all points.&quot; This is because in some cases, the moments exist and yet the moment-generating function does not, because the limit

formula_72

may not exist. The log-normal distribution is an example of when this occurs.
===Calculations of moments===
The moment-generating function is so called because if it exists on an open interval around &quot;t&quot; = 0, then it is the exponential generating function of the moments of the probability distribution:

formula_73

That is, with &quot;n&quot; being a nonnegative integer, the &quot;n&quot;th moment about 0 is the &quot;n&quot;th derivative of the moment generating function, evaluated at &quot;t&quot; = 0.

==Other properties==
Jensen&#x27;s inequality provides a simple lower bound on the moment-generating function:
formula_74
where formula_75 is the mean of &quot;X&quot;.

The moment-generating function can be used in conjunction with Markov&#x27;s inequality to bound the upper tail of a real random variable &quot;X&quot;. This statement is also called the Chernoff bound. Since formula_76 is monotonically increasing for formula_77, we have
formula_78
for any formula_77 and any &quot;a&quot;, provided formula_5 exists. For example, when &quot;X&quot; is a standard normal distribution and formula_81, we can choose formula_82 and recall that formula_83. This gives formula_84, which is within a factor of 1+&quot;a&quot; of the exact value.

Various lemmas, such as Hoeffding&#x27;s lemma or Bennett&#x27;s inequality provide bounds on the moment-generating function in the case of a zero-mean, bounded random variable.

When formula_3 is non-negative, the moment generating function gives a simple, useful bound on the moments:
formula_86
For any formula_87 and formula_77.

This follows from the inequality formula_89 into which we can substitute formula_90 implies formula_91 for any formula_92.
Now, if formula_77 and formula_94, this can be rearranged to formula_95.
Taking the expectation on both sides gives the bound on formula_96 in terms of formula_97.

As an example, consider formula_98 with formula_99 degrees of freedom. Then from the examples formula_100.
Picking formula_101 and substituting into the bound:
formula_102
We know that in this case the correct bound is formula_103.
To compare the bounds, we can consider the asymptotics for large formula_99.
Here the moment-generating function bound is formula_105,
where the real bound is formula_106.
The moment-generating function bound is thus very strong in this case.

==Relation to other functions==
Related to the moment-generating function are a number of other transforms that are common in probability theory:

;Characteristic function: The characteristic function formula_107 is related to the moment-generating function via formula_108 the characteristic function is the moment-generating function of &quot;iX&quot; or the moment generating function of &quot;X&quot; evaluated on the imaginary axis. This function can also be viewed as the Fourier transform of the probability density function, which can therefore be deduced from it by inverse Fourier transform.
;Cumulant-generating function: The cumulant-generating function is defined as the logarithm of the moment-generating function; some instead define the cumulant-generating function as the logarithm of the characteristic function, while others call this latter the &quot;second&quot; cumulant-generating function.
;Probability-generating function: The probability-generating function is defined as formula_109 This immediately implies that formula_110

<text>The Hawker Tempest is a British fighter aircraft that was primarily used by the Royal Air Force (RAF) in the Second World War. The Tempest, originally known as the &quot;Typhoon II&quot;, was an improved derivative of the Hawker Typhoon, intended to address the Typhoon&#x27;s unexpected deterioration in performance at high altitude by replacing its wing with a thinner laminar flow design. Since it had diverged considerably from the Typhoon, it was renamed &quot;Tempest&quot;. The Tempest emerged as one of the most powerful fighters of World War II and at low altitude was the fastest single-engine propeller-driven aircraft of the war.

Upon entering service in 1944, the Tempest performed low-level interception, particularly against the V-1 flying bomb threat, and ground attack supporting major invasions like Operation Market Garden. Later, it successfully targeted the rail infrastructure in Germany and &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; aircraft on the ground, as well as countering similar attacks by German fighters. The Tempest was effective in the low-level interception role, including against newly developed jet-propelled aircraft like the Messerschmitt Me 262.

The further-developed Tempest II did not enter service until after the end of hostilities. It had several improvements, including being tropicalised for combat against Japan in South-East Asia as part of the Commonwealth Tiger Force.

== Design and development ==
=== Origins ===
During development of the earlier Hawker Typhoon, the design team, under the leadership of Sydney Camm, had already planned out a series of design improvements; these improvements culminated in the &quot;Hawker P. 1012&quot;, otherwise known as the &quot;Typhoon II&quot; or &quot;Thin-Wing Typhoon&quot;. Although the Typhoon was generally considered to be a good design, Camm and his design team were disappointed with the performance of its wing, which had proved to be too thick in its cross section, and thus created airflow problems which inhibited flight performance, especially at higher altitudes and speeds where it was affected by compressibility. The Typhoon&#x27;s wing, which used a NACA 4 digit series wing section, had a maximum thickness-to-chord ratio of 19.5 per cent (root) to 12 per cent (tip), in comparison to the Supermarine Spitfire&#x27;s 13.2 per cent tapering to 6 per cent at the tip, the thinner design being deliberately chosen to reduce drag. In addition, there had been other issues experienced with the Typhoon, such as engine unreliability, insufficient structural integrity, and the inability to perform high altitude interception duties.
In March 1940, engineers were assigned to investigate the new low–drag laminar flow wing developed by NACA in the United States, which was later used in the North American P-51 Mustang. A laminar flow wing adopted for the Tempest series had a maximum thickness-to-chord ratio of 14.5 per cent at the root, tapering to 10 per cent at the tip. The maximum thickness of the Tempest wing was set further back at 37.5 per cent of the chord versus 30 per cent for the Typhoon&#x27;s wing, reducing the thickness of the wing root by five inches on the new design. The wingspan was originally greater than that of the Typhoon at , but the wingtips were later &quot;clipped&quot; and the wing became shorter; versus .

The wing planform was changed to a near-elliptical shape to accommodate the 800 rounds of ammunition for the four 20 mm Hispano cannons, which were moved back further into the wing. The new wing had greater area than the Typhoon&#x27;s, but the new wing design sacrificed the leading edge fuel tanks of the Typhoon. To make up for this loss in capacity, Hawker engineers added a new fuel bay in front of the cockpit, with a 76 Igal (345 L) fuel tank. In addition, two inter-spar wing tanks, each of 28 Igal (127 L), were fitted on either side of the centre section and, starting with late model Tempest Vs, a 30 Igal (136 L) tank was carried in the leading edge of the port wingroot, giving the Tempest a total internal fuel capacity of 162 Igal (736 L).

Another important feature of the new wing was Camm&#x27;s proposal that the radiators for cooling the engine be fitted into the leading edge of the wing inboard of the undercarriage. This eliminated the distinctive &quot;chin&quot; radiator of the Typhoon and improved aerodynamics. A further improvement of the Tempest wing over that of the Typhoon was the exceptional, flush-riveted surface finish, essential on a high-performance laminar flow airfoil. The new wing and airfoil, and the use of a four-bladed propeller, acted to eliminate the high frequency vibrations that had plagued the Typhoon. The design team also chose to use the new Mark IV version of the Napier Sabre H-block 24 cylinder engine for the Tempest, drawings of which had become available to Hawker in early 1941.

In February 1941, Camm commenced a series of discussions with officials within the Ministry of Aircraft Production on the topic of the P.1012. In March 1941 of that year, clearance to proceed with development of the design, referred to at this point as the Typhoon II, was granted. The design at the time encompassed the Sabre E.107C (as it was then known) with a four-blade propeller, 42 ft span elliptical wing with six cannon armament; while the front of the fuselage was redesigned the rear was unchanged from the Typhoon. At this point, work was undertaken by a team of 45 draughtsmen at Hawker&#x27;s wartime experimental design office at Claremont, Esher to convert the proposal into technical schematics from which to commence manufacture. In March 1941, the Air Ministry issued specification F.10/41 that had been written to fit the aircraft. The performance estimate given to MAP was 455 mph at 26,000 ft. In September Camm was told that the Air Ministry&#x27;s Director of Technical Development that they had decided to have two Typhoons converted to the new design. By October 1941, development of the proposal had advanced to the point where the new design was finalised.

=== Prototypes ===

On 18 November 1941, a contract was issued by the Air Ministry for a pair of prototypes of the &quot;Typhoon Mark II&quot;; the new fighter was renamed &quot;Tempest&quot; on 28 February 1942. Complications were added to the Tempest program by external factors in the form of engine issues: the Rolls-Royce Vulture engine and corresponding Hawker Tornado aircraft which was being developed in parallel to the Typhoon were both terminated. This measure turned out to be prudent, as engine development was not trouble-free on some of the variants of the Tempest. The Bristol Centaurus radial engine was now also considered for equipping the Typhoon and Camm was forewarned in October 1941 to expect a request for a Centaurus to be fitted. This was confirmed in February as an order for six prototypes with the Centaurus; the DTD stating that the development was highest priority. 

Delays with the Sabre IV development affected the project. With the expected first flight date for the Tempest was September 1942, the engine for &quot;HM595&quot; was changed to a Sabre II complete with the Typhoon cooling system and under nose radiator. Due to this previous experience on other programmes, the Air Ministry was sufficiently motivated to request that Tempest prototypes be built using different engines so that, if a delay hit one engine, an alternative powerplant would already be available.An order was approved for six more prototypes with alternate engines in May and the contract for two with Sabres, two with Centaurus and two with Rolls Royce Griffons followed in June. 
The six prototypes built were as follows:
* One Tempest Mk.I (serial number &quot;HM599&quot;), equipped with the Napier Sabre Mk.IV engine
* Two Tempest Mk.II (serial numbers &quot;LA602&quot; and &quot;LA607&quot;), equipped with the Bristol Centaurus Mk.IV engine (LA607 later receiving a Centaurus Mk.V)
* One Tempest Mk.III (serial number &quot;LA610&quot;), equipped with the Rolls-Royce Griffon 85 engine (originally planned for the Griffon IIB)
* One Tempest Mk.IV (serial number &quot;LA614&quot;), which was never completed but planned to be equipped with a Griffon 61 engine
* One Tempest Mk.V (serial number &quot;HM595&quot;), equipped with the Napier Sabre Mk.II engine

The Tempest Mk.I featured other new features, such as a clean single-piece sliding canopy in place of the car-door framed canopy, and it used wing radiators instead of the &quot;chin&quot; radiator. Due to development difficulties with the Sabre IV engine and its wing radiators, the completion of the Mk.I prototype, &quot;HM599&quot;, was delayed, and thus it was the Mk.V prototype, &quot;HM595&quot;, that would fly first.
On 2 September 1942, the Tempest Mk.V prototype, &quot;HM595&quot;, conducted its maiden flight, flown by Philip Lucas from Langley, Berkshire, England. &quot;HM595&quot;, which was powered by a Sabre II engine, retained the Typhoon&#x27;s framed canopy and car-style door, and was fitted with the &quot;chin&quot; radiator, similar to that of the Typhoon. It was quickly fitted with the same bubble canopy fitted to Typhoons, and a modified fin that almost doubled the vertical tail surface area, made necessary because the directional stability with the original Typhoon fin had been reduced over that of the Typhoon by the longer nose incurred by the new fuel tank. The horizontal tailplanes and elevators were also increased in span and chord; these were also fitted to late production Typhoons. Test pilots found the Tempest a great improvement over the Typhoon in performance; in February 1943 the pilots from the Aeroplane &amp; Armament Experimental Establishment at Boscombe Down reported that they were impressed by &quot;a manoeuvrable and pleasant aircraft to fly with no major handling faults&quot;.

On 24 February 1943, the second prototype &quot;HM599&quot; first flew, representing the &quot;Tempest Mk.I&quot; equipped with the Napier Sabre IV engine; this flight had been principally delayed by protracted problems and slippages encountered in the development of the new Sabre IV engine. Construction had been on hold (so parts could be used for possible repairs to the first prototype) until &quot;HM595&quot; was converted to Sabre II. &quot;HM599&quot; was at first equipped with the older Typhoon cockpit structure and vertical tailplane. The elimination of the &quot;chin&quot; radiator did much to improve overall performance, leading to the Tempest Mk.I quickly becoming the fastest aircraft that Hawker had built at that time, having attained a speed of during test flights. The Sabre IV was failing testing and so the Mk I Tempest was abandoned by the MAP. 

On 27 November 1944, the Tempest Mk.III prototype, &quot;LA610&quot;, conducted its first flight; it was decided to discontinue development work on the Mk.III, this was due to priority for the Griffon engine having been assigned to the Supermarine Spitfire instead. The Air Ministry had seen the Mk III as a replacement for the Hurricane in ground attack, with the narrower engine giving a better view as well but the Typhoon would be the interim aircraft for the role. In practice the Typhoon proved very good for ground attack.

Work on the Tempest Mk.IV variant was abandoned without any prototype being flown at all. The Tempest Mk.II, which was subject to repeated delays due to its Centaurus powerplant, was persisted with, but would not reach production in time to see service during the Second World War. Continual problems with the Sabre IV meant that only the single Tempest Mk.I (&quot;HM599&quot;) was built; consequently, Hawker proceeded to take the Sabre II-equipped &quot;Tempest V&quot; into production instead.

In August 1942, even before the first flight of the prototype Tempest V had been conducted, a production order for 400 Tempests was placed by the Air Ministry. This order was split, with the initial batch of 100 being Tempest V &quot;Series I&quot;s, powered by the Sabre IIA series engine, which had the distinctive chin radiator, while the rest were to have been produced as the Tempest I, equipped with the Sabre IV and leading-edge radiators. These 300 Tempest Is were intended to replace an order for a similar quantity of Typhoons placed with the Gloster Aircraft Company. As it transpired, the difficulties with the Sabre IV and the wing radiators led to this version never reaching production, the corresponding order was switched to 300 Tempest V &quot;Series 2&quot;s instead.

=== Tempest Mk.V ===

During early 1943, a production line for the Tempest Mk.V was established in Hawker&#x27;s Langley facility, alongside the existing manufacturing line for the Hawker Hurricane. Production was initially slow, claimed to be due to issues encountered with the rear spar. On 21 June 1943, the first production Tempest V, &quot;JN729&quot;, rolled off the production line and its maiden flight was conducted by test pilot Bill Humble.
During production of the first batch of 100 Tempest V &quot;Series Is&quot;, distinguishable by their serial number prefix &quot;JN&quot;, several improvements were progressively introduced and were used from the outset on all succeeding Tempest V &quot;Series 2s&quot;, with serial number prefixes EJ, NV and SN. The fuselage/empennage joint originally featured 20 external reinforcing &quot;fishplates&quot;, similar to those fitted to the Typhoon, but it was not long before the rear fuselage was strengthened and, with the fishplates no longer being needed, the rear fuselage became detachable. The first series of Tempest Vs used a built-up rear spar pick-up/bulkhead assembly (just behind the cockpit) which was adapted from the Typhoon. Small blisters on the upper rear wing root fairing covered the securing bolts. This was later changed to a new forged, lightweight assembly which connected to new spar booms: the upper wing root blisters were replaced by small &quot;teardrop&quot; fairings under the wings.

The first 100 Tempest Vs were fitted with Hispano Mk.II cannon with long barrels which projected ahead of the wing leading edges and were covered by short fairings; later production Tempest Vs switched to the short-barrelled Hispano Mk.Vs, with muzzles flush with the leading edges. Early Tempest Vs used Typhoon-style five-spoke wheels, but most had smaller four-spoke wheels. The new spar structure of the Tempest V also allowed up to of external stores to be carried underneath the wings. As a result, several early production Tempest V aircraft underwent extensive service trials at Boscombe Down for clearance to be fitted with external stores, such as one bomb or eight &quot;60lb&quot; air-to-ground RP-3 rockets under each wing. On 8 April 1944, the Tempest Mk.V attained general clearance to carry such ordnance, but few Tempest Mk.V deployed bombs operationally during the war. Rockets were never used operationally during the war by the Mk.Vs.

As in all mass-produced aircraft, there may have been some overlap of these features as new components became available. In mid-to-late 1944 other features were introduced to both the Typhoon and Tempest: A &quot;Rebecca&quot; transponder unit was fitted, with the associated aerial appearing under the portside centre section. A small, elongated oval static port appeared on the rear starboard fuselage, just above the red centre spot of the RAF roundel. This was apparently used to measure the aircraft&#x27;s altitude more accurately.

Unusually, in spite of the Tempest V being the RAF&#x27;s best low- to medium-altitude fighter, it was not equipped with the new Mk.IIC gyroscopic gunsight (as fitted in RAF Spitfires and Mustangs from mid-1944), which would have considerably improved the chances of shooting down opposing aircraft. Tempest pilots continued to use either the Type I Mk.III reflector gunsight, which projected the sighting graticule directly onto the windscreen, or the Mk.IIL until just after the Second World War, when the gyro gunsight was introduced in Tempest IIs.

Two Tempest Vs, &quot;EJ518&quot; and &quot;NV768&quot;, were fitted with Napier Sabre Vs and experimented with several different Napier-made annular radiators, with which they resembled Tempest IIs. This configuration proved to generate less drag than the standard &quot;chin&quot; radiator, contributing to an improvement in the maximum speed of some 11 to 14 mph. &quot;NV768&quot; was later fitted with a ducted spinner, similar to that fitted to the Fw 190 V1.

==== 47 mm anti tank gun trials ====
Tempest V &quot;SN354&quot; was fitted with two experimental underwing Class P 47 mm guns (built by Vickers) just after the war. These guns were part of a project started in mid-1942 to develop a more powerful airborne anti-tank gun than the Vickers 40 mm Class S gun which had been used on the Hurricane IID. The Vickers guns were housed in long slim streamlined gun pods carried on the bomb racks and had 38 rounds each. Surviving photographs suggests that the 20 mm wing guns were removed for this installation. Testing of the guns revealed that the weapon had potential, but no production was undertaken.

=== Tempest Mk.II ===

As a result of the termination of the Tornado project, Sydney Camm and his design team transferred the alternative engine proposals for the Tornado to the more advanced Tempest. Thus, it was designed from the outset to use the Bristol Centaurus 18 cylinder radial engine as an alternative to the liquid cooled engines which were also proposed. A pair of Centaurus-powered Tempest II prototypes were completed. Apart from the new engine and cowling, the Tempest II prototypes were similar to early series Tempest Vs. The Centaurus engine was closely cowled and the exhaust stacks grouped behind and to either side of the engine: to the rear were air outlets with automatic sliding &quot;gills&quot;. The carburettor air intakes were in the inner leading edges of both wings, an oil cooler and air intake were present in the inner starboard wing. The engine installation owed much to examinations of a captured Focke-Wulf Fw 190, and was clean and effective.

On 28 June 1943, the first Tempest II, &quot;LA602&quot;, flew powered by a Centaurus IV (2,520 hp/1,879 kW) driving a four-blade propeller. &quot;LA602&quot; initially flew with a Typhoon-type fin and rudder unit. This was followed by the second, &quot;LA607&quot;, which was completed with the enlarged dorsal fin and first flew on 18 September 1943: &quot;LA607&quot; was assigned to engine development. The first major problem experienced during the first few flights was serious engine vibrations, which were cured by replacing the rigid, eight-point engine mountings with six-point rubber-packed shock mounts. In a further attempt to alleviate engine vibration, the four-blade propeller was replaced with a five-blade unit; eventually, a finely balanced four bladed unit was settled on. Problems were also experienced with engine overheating, poor crankshaft lubrication, exhaust malfunctions and reduction-gear seizures. Because of these problems, and because of the decision to &quot;tropicalise&quot; all Tempest IIs for service in the South-East Asian theatre, production was delayed.
Orders had been placed as early as September 1942 for 500 Tempest IIs to be built by Gloster but in 1943, because of priority being given to the Typhoon, a production contract of 330 Tempest IIs was allocated instead to Bristol, while Hawker were to build 1,800. This switch delayed production even more. On 4 October 1944, the first Tempest II was rolled off the line; the first six production aircraft soon joined the two prototypes for extensive trials and tests. With the end of the Second World War in sight, orders for the Tempest II were trimmed or cancelled; after 50 Tempest IIs had been built by the Bristol shadow factory near Banwell, production was stopped and shifted back to Hawker, which built a total of 402, in two production batches: 100 were built as fighters, and 302 were built as fighter-bombers (FB II) with reinforced wings and wing racks capable of carrying bombs of up to 1,000 lb.

Physically, the Tempest II was longer than the Tempest Mk.V ( versus and lower. The weight of the heavier Centaurus engine ( versus was offset by the absence of a heavy radiator unit, so that the Tempest II was only some heavier overall. Performance was improved; maximum speed was at and climb rate to the same altitude took four and a half minutes compared with five minutes for the Tempest Mk.V; the service ceiling was also increased to .

Tropicalising measures included the installation of an air filter and intake in the upper forward fuselage, just behind the engine cowling, and the replacement of the L-shaped pitot head under the outer port wing by a straight rod projecting from the port outer wing leading edge. All production aircraft were powered by a ( Centaurus V driving a diameter Rotol propeller. Tempest IIs produced during the war were intended for combat against Japan and would have formed part of Tiger Force, a proposed British and Empire long-range bomber force based on Okinawa to attack the Japanese home islands. The Pacific War ended before they could be deployed.

=== Tempest Mk.VI ===

Various engineering refinements that had gone into the Tempest II were incorporated into the last Tempest variant, designated as the &quot;Tempest VI&quot;. This variant was furnished with a Napier Sabre V engine with . The more powerful Sabre V required a bigger radiator which displaced the oil cooler and carburettor air intake from the radiator&#x27;s centre; air for the carburettor was drawn through intakes on the leading edge of the inner wings, while the oil cooler was located behind the radiator. Most Tempest VIs were tropicalised, the main feature of this process being an air filter which was fitted in a fairing on the lower centre section. Other changes included the strengthening of the rear spar and the inclusion of spring tabs, which granted the variant superior handling performance.

The original Tempest V prototype, &quot;HM595&quot;, was extensively modified to serve as the Tempest VI prototype. On 9 May 1944, &quot;HM595&quot; made its first flight after its rebuild, flown by Bill Humble. In December 1944, &quot;HM595&quot; was dispatched to Khartoum, Sudan to conduct a series of tropical trials. During 1945, two more Tempest V aircraft, &quot;EJ841&quot; and &quot;JN750&quot;, were converted to the Tempest VI standard in order to participate in service trials at RAF Boscombe Down.

At one point, 250 Tempest VIs were on order for the RAF; however, the end of the war led to many aircraft programs being cut back intensively, leading to only 142 aircraft being completed. For a long time, it was thought there were Tempest VIs that had been converted for target towing purposes; however, none of the service histories of the aircraft show such conversions and no supporting photographic evidence has been found. The Tempest VI was the last piston-engined fighter in operational service with the RAF, having been superseded by jet propelled aircraft.

=== Drawing board designs ===
In 1943, Camm initiated work on a new design for fighter equipped with the at that point unbuilt Rolls-Royce R.46 engine. The project designated as the &quot;P.1027&quot; was essentially a slightly enlarged Tempest with the R.46 engine, which Hawker expected to develop around 4,000 hp (2,980 kW). This engine would have driven a pair of four-bladed contra-rotating propellers. The radiator was relocated into a ventral bath set underneath the rear fuselage and wing centre section: the wingspan was and the length was .

However, work upon the P.1027 design was soon dropped in favour of concentrating upon a further developed design, the &quot;P.1030,&quot; in September It featured wing leading edge radiators and had larger overall dimensions of wingspan and length. The top speed was calculated as at 20,000 ft, with a rate of climb of 6,400 ft/min (1,951 m/min). Service ceiling was projected to be more than . Work on both was ultimately dropped when Camm decided to focus design efforts upon the more promising jet engine designs he was working on instead.

== Design ==
The Tempest was a single engine fighter aircraft that excelled at low-level flight. In service, its primary role soon developed into performing &quot;armed reconnaissance&quot; operations, often deep behind enemy lines. The Tempest was particularly well suited to the role because of its high speed at low to medium altitudes, its long range when equipped with two 45-gallon drop tanks, the good firepower of the four 20mm cannon and the good pilot visibility. The three-piece windscreen and side windows of the Tempest had directly benefited from examination of captured Focke-Wulf Fw 190s, improvements included the careful design and positioning of the frame structure, blind spots being reduced to an absolute minimum. It had a bullet-resistant centre panel made up of two layers, the outer thick and the inner .

The majority of production Tempests were powered by a single high-powered Napier Sabre II 24-cylinder engine. All versions of the Sabre drove either a four-bladed, diameter de Havilland Hydromatic or Rotol propeller. Starting with EJxxx series, on the Tempest V, both the improved Sabre IIB and IIC were used, these engines were capable of producing over on emergency boost for short periods of time. Alternative engines were used on some production variants, such as the Tempest II, for which a single Bristol Centaurus 18 cylinder radial engine was adopted, or the final Tempest VI, upon which a Napier Sabre V was used. Early on in development, the adoption of several other engines was proposed, some of which were tested upon multiple prototypes.

The wing of the Tempest was one of its more significant design features, having been developed from the Typhoon to use a thinner laminar flow design approach. The wing planform was of a near-elliptical shape; the aircraft&#x27;s armament of four 20 mm Hispano cannons with 800 rounds of ammunition was also embedded into the wing. The ailerons were fitted with spring-loaded tabs which lightened the aerodynamic loads, making them easier for the pilot to use and dramatically improving the roll rate above . The spar structure of the Tempest V also allowed the wings to carry up to of external stores. Also developed specifically for the Tempest by Hawker was a streamlined 45 gal (205 L) &quot;drop tank&quot; to extend the operational radius by and carrier fairing; the redesigned wing incorporated the plumbing for these tanks, one to each wing.
The main undercarriage was redesigned from the Typhoon, featuring lengthened legs and a wider track () to improve stability at the high landing speed of , and to allow tip clearance for a new de Havilland diameter four-blade propeller. The main undercarriage units were Dowty levered suspension units incorporating trunnions which shortened the legs as they retracted. The retractable tailwheel was fully enclosed by small doors and could be fitted with either a plain Dunlop manufactured tyre, or a Dunlop-Marstrand &quot;twin-contact&quot; anti-shimmy tyre.

During development, Camm and the Hawker design team had placed a high priority on making the Tempest easily accessible to both air and ground crews; to this end, the forward fuselage and cockpit areas of the earlier Hurricane and the Tempest and Typhoon families were covered by large removable panels providing access to as many components as possible, including flight controls and engine accessories. Both upper wing roots incorporated panels of non-slip coating. For the pilot a retractable foot stirrup under the starboard root trailing edge was linked to a pair of handholds which were covered by spring-loaded flaps. Through a system of linkages, when the canopy was open the stirrup was lowered and the flaps opened, providing easy access to the cockpit; as the canopy was closed, the stirrup was raised into the fuselage and the flaps snapped shut.

== Operational history ==
By April 1944, the Tempest V had attained general acceptance and was in the hands of operational squadrons; 3 Squadron was the first to be fully equipped, closely followed by 486 (NZ) Squadron (the only Article XV squadron to be equipped with the Tempest during the Second World War), replacing their previous Typhoons. A third unit—56 Squadron—initially kept its Typhoons and was then temporarily equipped with Spitfire IXs until sufficient supplies of Tempests were available. By the end of April 1944, these units were based at RAF Newchurch in Kent a new &quot;Advanced Landing Ground&quot; (ALG), where they formed 150 Wing, commanded by Wing Commander Roland Beamont. The new Wing was part of the Second Tactical Air Force (2nd TAF).

Most of the operations carried out by 150 Wing comprised high-altitude fighter sweeps, offensive operations known as &quot;Rangers&quot;, as well as reconnaissance missions. Prior to the Normandy landings, Tempests would routinely conduct long-range sorties inside enemy territory and penetrate into Northern France and the Low Countries, using a combination of cannons and bombs to attack airfields, radar installations, ground vehicles, coastal shipping and the launch sites for the German V-1 flying bombs. The build-up of Tempest-equipped squadrons was increased rapidly, in part due to factors such as the V-1 threat, although a labour strike in Hawker&#x27;s assembly shop adversely affected this rate; by September 1944, five frontline Tempest squadrons with a total of 114 aircraft were in operation.

In June 1944, the first of the V-1s were launched against London; the excellent low-altitude performance of the Tempest made it one of the preferred tools for handling the small fast-flying unmanned missiles. 150 Wing was transferred back to the RAF Fighter Command; the Tempest squadrons soon racked up a considerable percentage of the total RAF kills of the flying bombs (638 of a total of 1,846 destroyed by aircraft). Using external drop tanks, the Tempest was able to maintain standing patrols of four and half hours off the south coast of England in the approach paths of the V-1s. Guided by close instructions from coastal radar installation, Tempests would be positioned ready for a typical pursuit and would either use cannon fire or nudge the V-1 with the aircraft itself to destroy it.

In September 1944, Tempest units, based at forward airfields in England, supported Operation Market Garden, the airborne attempt to seize a bridgehead over the Rhine. On 21 September 1944, as the V-1 threat had receded, the Tempest squadrons were redeployed to the 2nd TAF, effectively trading places with the Mustang III squadrons of 122 Wing, which became part of the Fighter Command units deployed on bomber escort duties. 122 Wing now consisted of 3 Sqn., 56 Sqn., 80 Sqn., 274 Sqn. (to March 1945), and 486(NZ)Sqn. From 1 October 1944 122 Wing was based at ALG B.80 (Volkel) near Uden, in the Netherlands. During the early phase of operations, the Tempest regularly emerged victorious and proved to be a difficult opponent for the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;″s Messerschmitt Bf 109G and Fw 190 fighters to counter.

Armed reconnaissance missions were usually flown by two sections (eight aircraft), flying in finger-four formations, which would cross the front lines at altitudes of 7,000 to 8,000 feet: once the Tempests reached their allocated target area the lead section dropped to or lower to search for targets to strafe, while the other section flew cover higher and down sun. After the first section had carried out several attacks, it swapped places with the second section and the attacks continued until all ammunition had been exhausted, after which the Tempests would return to base at 8,000 ft. As many of the more profitable targets were usually some 250 miles from base, the Tempests typically carried two 45-gallon drop tanks which were turned on soon after takeoff. Although there were fears that the empty tanks would explode if hit by flak, the threat never eventuated and, due to the tanks being often difficult to jettison, they were routinely carried throughout an operation with little effect on performance, reducing maximum speed by 5 to 10 mph and range by 2 per cent.

Between October and December 1944, the Tempest was practically withdrawn from combat operations for overhaul work, as well as to allow operational pilots to train newcomers. The overhaul process involved the replacement or major servicing of their engines and the withdrawal of the limited number of aircraft which were equipped with spring-tabs; these increased manoeuvrability so much that there was a risk of damaging the airframe. In December 1944, upon the Tempest&#x27;s reentry into service, the type had the twin tasks of the systematic destruction of the North German rail network along with all related targets of opportunity, and the maintenance of air supremacy within the North German theatre, searching for and destroying any high-performance fighter or bomber aircraft of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, whether in the air or on the ground.

In December 1944, a total of 52 German fighters were downed, 89 trains and countless military vehicles were destroyed, for the loss of 20 Tempests. Following the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;″s &quot;Unternehmen Bodenplatte&quot; of 1 January 1945, 122 Wing bore the brunt of low- to medium-altitude fighter operations for the Second Tactical Air Force, which had fortuitously evaded the extensive Bodenplatte raid, and had contributed to efforts to intercept the raiders. During this time, Spitfire XIVs of 125 and 126 Wings often provided medium- to high-altitude cover for the Tempests, which came under intense pressure, the wing losing 47 pilots in January. In February 1945, 33 and 222 Sqns. of 135 Wing converted from Spitfire Mk IXs and, in March, were joined by 274 Sqn. 135 Wing was based at ALG B.77 (Gilze-Rijen airfield) in the Netherlands. The intensity of operations persisted throughout the remainder of the war.

=== Against advanced German planes ===
Piloting a Tempest on 19 April 1945, Flying Officer Geoffrey Walkington was the first to shoot down a Heinkel He 162, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;″s then-latest jet fighter, which had just entered service with the I./JG 1 (1st Group of &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; 1 &quot;Oesau&quot; — &quot;1st Fighter Wing &quot;Oesau&quot;&quot;).

Tempest pilots, including French ace Pierre Clostermann, made the first Allied combat encounter with a Dornier 335 in April 1945. In his book &quot;The Big Show,&quot; he describes leading a flight of Hawker Tempests from No. 3 Squadron RAF over northern Germany, when they saw a lone unusual looking aircraft flying at maximum speed at treetop level. Detecting the British aircraft, the German pilot reversed course to evade. Despite the Tempests&#x27; considerable low altitude speed, Clostermann decided not to attempt to follow as it was obviously much quicker though one of the other two Tempests did pursue it briefly.

During 1945, Tempests scored of a number of kills against the new German jets, including the Messerschmitt Me 262. Hubert Lange, a Me 262 pilot, said: &quot;the Messerschmitt Me 262&#x27;s most dangerous opponent was the British Hawker Tempest — extremely fast at low altitudes, highly manoeuvrable and heavily armed.&quot;

Some Me 262s were destroyed using a tactic known to 135 Wing as the &quot;Rat Scramble&quot;; Tempests on immediate alert took off when an Me 262 was reported to be airborne. They did not directly intercept the jet, but instead flew towards the airbase at Rheine-Hopsten, known to base Me 262s and Ar 234s. The aim was to attack jets on their landing approach, when they were at their most vulnerable, travelling slowly, with flaps down and incapable of rapid acceleration. The Germans responded by creating a &quot;flak lane&quot; of over 150 of the &quot;Flakvierling&quot; quadruple 20 mm AA batteries at Rheine-Hopsten, to protect the approaches. After seven Tempests were lost to anti-aircraft fire at Rheine-Hopsten in a single week, the &quot;Rat Scramble&quot; was discontinued. For a few days in March 1945, a strict &quot;&quot;No&quot;, repeat, No ground attacks&quot; policy was imposed.

=== Air combat success ratio ===
In air-to-air combat, the Tempest units achieved an estimated air combat success ratio of about 8:1, scoring 239 confirmed victories (not including the additional &quot;victories&quot; against the unmanned V-1 flying bomb), 9 probable victories, and 31 losses and probable losses.

The top-scoring Tempest pilot was Squadron Leader David Fairbanks DFC, an American who joined the Royal Canadian Air Force in 1941. By mid-1944, he was flying with 274 Squadron. When he was shot down and made a prisoner of war in February 1945, he had destroyed 11 or 12 German aircraft (and one shared), to make him the highest-scoring Tempest ace.

=== Other activities ===
Early flights by RAF pilots found the Tempest, unlike the Typhoon, was buffet-free up to and somewhat beyond . During 1944, several veteran USAAF pilots flew the Tempest in mock combat exercises held over the south of England; the consensus from these operations was that it was roughly akin to the American Republic P-47 Thunderbolt. According to aviation author Francis K. Mason, the Tempest was commonly accepted as the best–performing RAF fighter in operational service by VE Day. Following the end of the war, the RAF decided upon the Tempest as its standard fighter, pending the introduction of newer aircraft, many of which would be developed post-war, such as the de Havilland Hornet and the de Havilland Vampire, as well as the Gloster Meteor. A number of squadrons would operate the Tempest as their final piston-engined type before converting to the new generation of jet-powered fighter aircraft that would come to dominate the next decade and beyond.

===Far East===
The later Tempest Mk.II was tropicalised as it had been decided that this variant would be intended for combat against Japan. The envisioned role for the type would have been as a purpose-built type which would participate in the Tiger Force, which was a proposed British Commonwealth long-range bomber force to have been stationed on Okinawa as a forward base for operations against the Japanese mainland. Before the Tempest Mk.II entered operational service, the Pacific War ended. By October 1945, a total of 320 Tempest IIs had been delivered to maintenance units stationed at RAF Aston Down and RAF Kemble; these aircraft were mainly dispatched to squadrons stationed overseas in Germany and in India, along with other locations such as Hong Kong and Malaysia. On 8 June 1946, a Tempest II, flown by Roland Beamont, led the flypast at the London Victory Celebrations of 1946. RAF Tempest IIs saw combat use against guerrillas of the Malayan National Liberation Army during the early stages of the Malayan Emergency.

==Post war==
A total of 142 Tempest Mk VI were produced, which equipped nine squadrons of the RAF, five of these being stationed in the Middle East due to its suitability for such environments. This particular variant was anticipated to have a short lifetime and their phasing out commenced in 1949. During the 1950s, the Tempest was mainly used in its final capacity as a target tug aircraft. In 1947, the RAF transferred a total of 89 Tempest FB IIs to the Indian Air Force (IAF), while another 24 were passed on to the Pakistani Air Force (PAF) in 1948. Both India and Pakistan would operate the Tempest until 1953. Several of these aircraft remain in existence, with three being restored to airworthiness in the United States and New Zealand. The restoration of an IAF Tempest Mk.II, &quot;MW376&quot;, in New Zealand was stalled due to the unexpected death of the owner in 2013, the aircraft being sold to a Canadian enthusiast; as of April 2016, MW376 was receiving extensive work at facilities in Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada. It is being restored to an operational condition.

<text>Pavel Romanovich Popovich (; ; 5 October 1930 – 29 September 2009) was a Soviet cosmonaut.

Popovich was the fourth cosmonaut in space, the sixth person in orbit, the eighth person and first Ukrainian in space.

== Biography ==

Popovich was born in Uzyn, Kyiv Oblast, Ukrainian SSR to Roman Porfirievich Popovich (a fireman in a sugar factory) and Theodosia Kasyanovna Semyonova. He had two sisters (one older, one younger) and two brothers (both younger).

During World War II, the Germans occupied Uzyn and burned documents, including Popovich&#x27;s birth certificate. After the war, these were restored through witness testimony, and although his mother said that Popovich was born in 1929, two witnesses insisted it was in 1930, which thus became the official year of his birth.

In 1947, Popovich left vocational school in Bila Tserkva with qualifications as a carpenter. In 1951, Popovich graduated as a construction engineer from a technical school in Magnitogorsk, as well as receiving a pilot&#x27;s degree.
In 1954, Popovich joined the Young Communist League.

He married Marina Popovich, a retired Soviet Air Force colonel and test pilot. They had two daughters but later divorced, and Popovich married Alevtina Oshegova.

Popovich was a keen weightlifter:
:&quot;Service in the Air Force made us strong, both physically and morally. All of us cosmonauts took up sports and PT seriously when we served in the Air Force. I know that Yuri Gagarin was fond of ice hockey. He liked to play goal keeper. Gherman Titov was a gymnastics enthusiast, Andriyan Nikolayev liked skiing, Pavel Popovich went in for weight lifting. I don&#x27;t think I am wrong when I say that sports became a fixture in the life of the cosmonauts.&quot;

He was also a member of the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic 6th–11th convocations.

After his retirement in 1993, Popovich lived in Moscow.

Popovich died in a hospital in Gurzuf where he was taken following a stroke on 29 September 2009, six days before his 79th birthday. Brain hemorrhage was cited as the cause of death. He was buried in Moscow.

== Military ==
In 1952, Popovich graduated from a course at the Stalingrad Military Aviation School near Novosibirsk. He then went on to train at the Military Officers of the Air Force Aviation Training School in Grozny, until 1954, when he joined the Soviet Air Force.

== Cosmonaut ==

In 1960, he was selected as one of the first group of twenty air force pilots that would train as the first cosmonauts for the Soviet space program. The training took place between March 1960 and January 1961, and Popovich passed his final exams in Cosmonaut Basic Training on 17/18 January 1961. He was appointed as an astronaut on 25 January 1961.

He was considered a strong candidate for the first spaceflight – but while Yuri Gagarin was ultimately chosen for the Vostok 1 flight, Popovich served as the flight&#x27;s capcom.

From May to August 1961, he trained to fly on spacecraft &quot;Vostok-2&quot; in a group of astronauts, followed (between September and November 1961) with training to fly &quot;Vostok-3&quot;. This flight was cancelled. Between November 1961 and May 1962, he trained as a pilot for &quot;Vostok-4&quot;. Between June and August of that year, he received further training in the maintenance of this spacecraft.

He commanded the space flight Vostok 4 (&quot;&quot;) in 1962 which, along with Andrian Nikolayev on Vostok 3, was the first time that more than one crewed spacecraft were in orbit at the same time. His call sign for this flight was &quot;Golden eagle ()&quot;.

In January 1964, he became a cosmonaut instructor, becoming deputy commander to the 2nd group of cosmonauts.

Popovich was selected to command one of the Soviet Union&#x27;s planned Moon landings, and trained for this between 1966 and 1968, when the Soviet Moon landing plans were scrapped.
In 1968, he was selected as commander for Soyuz 2, but after the death of Vladimir Komarov during the reentry of Soyuz 1, Soyuz 2 was launched without a crew.

In 1969 he was a senior cosmonaut instructor, and became (by 1972) the Chief of cosmonaut training.

In 1974, he commanded his second (and final) space flight Soyuz 14 (&quot;&quot;) in 1974. Again, his call sign for this flight was &quot;Golden eagle ()&quot;. This flight was the first to the Salyut 3 space station.

In 1977, he received a post-graduate degree in technical sciences.
In March 1978, he was on duty in the Flight Control Center for Vladimír Remek&#x27;s flight aboard Soyuz 28.

From 1978 he was the deputy chief of the Gagarin Cosmonauts Training Center responsible for research and testing work. From 1980 to 1989, he was Deputy chief of the Cosmonaut Training Center. In January 1982, he was removed from the list of active cosmonauts, so that he could serve as Deputy Chief for Scientific Testing and Research at the Center.

In 1984 Popovich joined the Russian Academy of Sciences&#x27; newly created All-Union Investigation Committee for Anomalous Aerial Phenomena and became head of the Academy&#x27;s UFO Commission.

In the 2002 SciFi Channel documentary &quot;Out of the Blue&quot;, Popovich relays a sighting of a UFO next to the airplane he was travelling aboard as he was returning home from Washington, D.C., with a delegation of scientists. The UFO was seen by everyone on board the plane. It was perfect triangle shaped and emitted a very bright, white light at a distance of about and an altitude about above the airplane. The object had an estimated speed of travelling parallel to the airplane and passed and overtook the plane in about 30 to 40 seconds.

Popovich was the president of the UFO association of Russia.

<text>An acetate is a salt formed by the combination of acetic acid with a base (e.g. alkaline, earthy, metallic, nonmetallic or radical base). &quot;Acetate&quot; also describes the conjugate base or ion (specifically, the negatively charged ion called an anion) typically found in aqueous solution and written with the chemical formula . The neutral molecules formed by the combination of the acetate ion and a &quot;positive&quot; ion (called a cation) are also commonly called &quot;acetates&quot; (hence, &quot;acetate of lead&quot;, &quot;acetate of aluminium&quot;, etc.). The simplest of these is hydrogen acetate (called acetic acid) with corresponding salts, esters, and the polyatomic anion , or .

Most of the approximately 5 million tonnes of acetic acid produced annually in industry are used in the production of acetates, which usually take the form of polymers. In nature, acetate is the most common building block for biosynthesis.

==Nomenclature and common formula==
When part of a salt, the formula of the acetate ion is written as , , or . Chemists often represent acetate as OAc− or, less commonly, AcO−. Thus, HOAc is the symbol for acetic acid, NaOAc for sodium acetate, and EtOAc for ethyl acetate (as Ac is common symbol for acetyl group CH3CO). The pseudoelement symbol &quot;Ac&quot; is also sometimes encountered in chemical formulas as indicating the entire acetate ion (). It is not to be confused with the symbol of actinium, the first element of the actinide series; context guides disambiguation. For example, the formula for sodium acetate might be abbreviated as &quot;NaOAc&quot;, rather than &quot;NaC2H3O2&quot;. Care should also be taken to avoid confusion with peracetic acid when using the OAc abbreviation; for clarity and to avoid errors when translated, HOAc should be avoided in literature mentioning both compounds.

Although its systematic name is &quot;ethanoate&quot; (), the common &quot;acetate&quot; remains the preferred IUPAC name.

==Salts==

The acetate anion, [CH3COO]−,(or [C2H3O2]−) is one of the carboxylate family. It is the conjugate base of acetic acid. Above a pH of 5.5, acetic acid converts to acetate:
:CH3COOH ⇌ CH3COO− + H+
Many acetate salts are ionic, indicated by their tendency to dissolve well in water. A commonly encountered acetate in the home is sodium acetate, a white solid that can be prepared by combining vinegar and sodium bicarbonate (&quot;bicarbonate of soda&quot;):

:CH3COOH + NaHCO3 → CH3COO−Na+ + H2O + CO2

Transition metals can be complexed by acetate. Examples of acetate complexes include chromium(II) acetate and basic zinc acetate.

Commercially important acetate salts are aluminium acetate, used in dyeing, ammonium acetate, a precursor to acetamide, and potassium acetate, used as a diuretic. All three salts are colourless and highly soluble in water.

==Esters==

Acetate esters have the general formula CH3CO2R, where R is an organyl group. The esters are the dominant forms of acetate in the marketplace. Unlike the acetate salts, acetate esters are often liquids, lipophilic, and sometimes volatile. They are popular because they have inoffensive, often sweet odors, they are inexpensive, and they are usually of low toxicity.

Almost half of acetic acid production is consumed in the production of vinyl acetate, precursor to polyvinyl alcohol, which is a component of many paints. The second largest use of acetic acid is consumed in the production of cellulose acetate. In fact, &quot;acetate&quot; is jargon for cellulose acetate, which is used in the production of fibres or diverse products, e.g. the acetate discs used in audio record production. Cellulose acetate can be found in many household products. Many industrial solvents are acetates, including methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, ethylhexyl acetate. Butyl acetate is a fragrance used in food products.

==Acetate in biology==
Acetate is a common anion in biology. It is mainly utilized by organisms in the form of acetyl coenzyme A.

Intraperitoneal injection of sodium acetate (20 or 60 mg per kg body mass) was found to induce headache in sensitized rats, and it has been proposed that acetate resulting from oxidation of ethanol is a major factor in causing hangovers. Increased serum acetate levels lead to accumulation of adenosine in many tissues including the brain, and administration of the adenosine receptor antagonist caffeine to rats after ethanol was found to decrease nociceptive behavior.

Acetate has known immunomodulatory properties and can affect the innate immune response to pathogenic bacteria such as the respiratory pathogen &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;.

==Fermentation acetyl CoA to acetate==
Pyruvate is converted into acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) by the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase. This acetyl-CoA is then converted into acetate in &quot;E. coli&quot;, whilst producing ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation. Acetate formation requires two enzymes: phosphate acetyltransferase and acetate kinase.
      acetyl-CoA + phosphate → acetyl-phosphate + CoA 

      acetyl-phosphate + ADP → acetate + ATP

==Fermentation of acetate==

Acetic acid can also undergo a dismutation reaction to produce methane and carbon dioxide:

:CH3COO− + H+ → CH4 + CO2 Δ&quot;G&quot;° = −36 kJ/mol

This disproportionation reaction is catalysed by methanogen archaea in their fermentative metabolism. One electron is transferred from the carbonyl function (e− donor) of the carboxylic group to the methyl group (e− acceptor) of acetic acid to respectively produce CO2 and methane gas.

<text>Valery Fyodorovich Bykovsky (; 2 August 1934 – 27 March 2019) was a Soviet cosmonaut who flew on three space flights: Vostok 5, Soyuz 22, and Soyuz 31. He was also backup for Vostok 3 and Soyuz 37.

== Early life and career ==
Born in Pavlovsky Posad, Russia, on 2 August 1934, Bykovsky was the son of Fyodor Fyodorovich Bykovsky and Klavdia Ivanova. He had an older sister named Margarita, born three years earlier. When he was four years old, World War II began, forcing the family to move to Kuybyshev, and later again to Syzran, before moving back to near Moscow. By the age of 14, Bykovsky wanted to attend naval school; however, his father was not a proponent of this idea and encouraged him to stay at his school. A few days later, Bykovsky attended a lecture on the Soviet Air Force Club which inspired him to pursue his dream of becoming a pilot. He began flight theory lessons when he was 16 at the Moscow City Aviation Club.

Bykovsky graduated from aviation school aged 18 and enrolled in the Kachinsk Military Aviation Academy. He served as a fighter pilot and later as an instructor pilot, training other pilots on fighter aircraft. During his military service, Bykovsky logged over 5,000 hours of flying time on various types of aircraft, including jet fighters and bombers.

Bykovsky also had a passion for aviation research and experimentation. He was involved in several research programs aimed at improving the performance and safety of military aircraft. One of the programs he participated in was the development of the Tupolev Tu-16 jet bomber, which was used by the Soviet Air Force from the 1950s to the 1980s. Bykovsky was also involved in the testing of new jet engines and aviation equipment. In the 1950s, he participated in the testing of the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-19 jet fighter, which was the first Soviet production aircraft capable of supersonic flight.

He graduated from the academy at 21 years old and received the rank of lieutenant. By the time he began his cosmonaut training, he had done over 72 parachute jumps.

== Cosmonaut career==
=== Vostok programme ===
At 26 years old, he started his cosmonaut training at Zhukovsky Military Engineering academy. Although an exceptional pilot in his own right Bykovsky was not part of the original &quot;Vanguard Six&quot; assigned to the Vostok mission, however, due to a back injury sustained by Valentin Varlamov, Bykovksy was added to the group. His first assignment was as the backup pilot to the Vostok 3 mission. 
He launched on the Vostok 5 mission from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 14 June 1963. During the flight he conducted experiments, such as photographing the Earth&#x27;s horizon and documenting the growth of peas. He also floated about in the cabin and adjusted the spacecraft orientation numerous times. Two days into his flight, Valentina Tereshkova flew the Vostok 6 spacecraft within five kilometres of Bykovsky&#x27;s. Bykovsky set a space endurance record of five days in orbit where his call-sign was &quot;Hawk&quot; (Russian: Ястреб). Although this duration has been surpassed by multi-crew flights, it remains the record for a solo spaceflight. He also performed the first human bowel movement in space, at 9 hours and 5 minutes into the mission.

He was given his nation&#x27;s highest honour, &quot;Hero of The Soviet Union&quot; for his contribution to Soviet spaceflight. During his Vostok 5 mission, Bykovsky was also made a member of the Communist Party. He was promoted to colonel on 30 April 1966.

On June 25, 1963, Bykovsky and Tereshkova went to Moscow University for a press conference where Bykovsky was quoted by &quot;The Times&quot; describing how weightlessness affected him: &quot;The muscles of the arms feel extremely light; you lift a hand without any effort, you pick up something-and it weighs nothing. You get accustomed to this, but not at once.&quot;

=== Soyuz programme ===
Bykovsky was assigned to be the commander of the original Soyuz 2 mission, which was planned to be launched soon after Soyuz 1. Two of the three crewmen from Soyuz 2 were to conduct an extravehicular activity (EVA) and enter Soyuz 1. During the Soyuz 1 flight, many concurrent problems forced mission control to command an early reentry of the spacecraft. This also caused them to cancel the Soyuz 2 flight as no rendezvous could occur. On Soyuz 1, tube holding the main parachute was too rough, which created enough friction that the drogue parachute was unable to pull it out. The spacecraft struck the ground at approximately 93 miles per hour, killing Vladimir Komarov. As the Soyuz 2 capsule was made with the same specifications as Soyuz 1, if the mission had flown Bykovsky and his crew would have been killed.

He flew the Soyuz 22 mission with Vladimir Aksyonov. The mission launched on 15 September 1976. The capsule was originally a backup for the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project (ASTP). The main purpose of the mission was studying and practising Earth observation techniques.

He flew the Soyuz 31 mission to the Salyut 6 space station with the East German Sigmund Jähn. It was launched on 26 August 1978. They joined two other cosmonauts on the space station that had arrived on Soyuz 29. The four conducted biological experiments on themselves during their stay. Bykovsky and Jähn undocked from the station in the Soyuz 29 capsule on 3 September and landed back on Earth later that day.

==Post-cosmonaut career==

Much of his later career was devoted to promoting the Intercosmos programme amongst the world&#x27;s Socialist nations. Due to his age, he was moved from active duty to the reserves in 1988. He became the director of the Centre of Soviet Science and Culture in East Berlin after the Soyuz 31 mission. He retired sometime in 1990.

Valery Bykovsky established the Russian Federation of Cosmonautics (RFC) in 1998 with the objective of advancing the development of space exploration and science in Russia. The RFC&#x27;s main goals included increasing public interest in space exploration, providing educational opportunities for young people, and supporting research and development initiatives in the space sector. Bykovsky was the president of the RFC until his death in 2019.

==Personal life==
Bykovsky was a keen sportsman:
Bykovsky was a proficient aesthete and photographer who evinced a particular penchant for the art of painting. His extensive body of work, characterized by a predominantly figurative style, has been widely showcased in renowned galleries and museums throughout Russia. Additionally, he had an abiding passion for photography and had taken numerous photographs during his space missions, using both conventional and digital cameras to capture stunning images of the Earth&#x27;s surface and the celestial bodies.

He was married to Valentina Mikhailovna Sukhova; they had two sons. In 1986, his first son died in an aviation incident. Valery Bykovsky died on 27 March 2019.

<doc id="194641" wikidata="Q11588306" url="?curid=194641" title="Social services">
<text>Social services are a range of public services intended to provide support and assistance towards particular groups, which commonly include the disadvantaged. They may be provided by individuals, private and independent organizations, or administered by a government agency. Social services are connected with the concept of welfare and the welfare state, as countries with large welfare programs often provide a wide range of social services. Social services are employed to address the wide range of needs of a society. Prior to industrialisation, the provision of social services was largely confined to private organisations and charities, with the extent of its coverage also limited. Social services are now generally regarded globally as a &#x27;necessary function&#x27; of society and a mechanism through which governments may address societal issues.

The provision of social services by governments is linked to the belief of universal human rights, democratic principles, as well as religious and cultural values. The availability and coverage of social services varies significantly within societies. The main groups which social services is catered toward are: families, children, youths, elders, women, the sick, and the disabled. Social services consists of facilities and services such as: public education, welfare, infrastructure, mail, libraries, social work, food banks, universal health care, police, fire services, public transport and public housing.

== Characteristics ==

The term ‘social services’ is often substituted with other terms such as social welfare, social protection, social assistance, social care and social work, with many of the terms overlapping in characteristics and features. What is considered a ‘social service’ in a specific country is determined by its history, cultural norms, political system and economic status. The most central aspects of social services include education, health services, housing programs, and transport services. Social services can be both communal and individually based. This means that they may be implemented to provide assistance to the community broadly, such as economic support for unemployed citizens, or they may be administered specifically considering the need of an individual – such as foster homes. Social services are provided through a variety of models. Some of these models include:

* The Scandinavian model: based on the principles within &#x27;universalism&#x27;. This model provides significant aid to disadvantaged groups such as people with disabilities and is administered through the local government with limited contributions from non-governmental organisations.
* The family care model: employed throughout the Mediterranean, this model relies on the aid of individuals and families which usually work with clergy, as well as that of NGOs such as the Red Cross. 
* The means-tested model: employed in the UK and Australia, the government provides support but has stringent regulations and checks which it employs to determine who is entitled to receive social services or assistance.

=== Recipients ===
Social services may be available to the entirety of the population, such as the police and fire services, or they may be available to only specific groups or sections of society. Some examples of social service recipients include elderly people, children and families, people with disabilities, including both physical and mental disabilities. These may extend to drug users, young offenders and refugees and asylum seekers depending on the country and its social service programs, as well as the presence of non-governmental organisations.

== History ==

=== Early developments ===
The development of social services increased significantly in the last two decades of the nineteenth century in Europe. There are a number of factors that contributed to the development of social services in this period. These include: the impacts of industrialisation and urbanisation, the influence of Protestant thought regarding state responsibility for welfare, and the growing influence of trade unions and the labour movement.

==== Europe (1833–1914) ====

In the nineteenth century, as countries industrialised further, the extent of social services in the form of labour schemes and compensation expanded. The expansion of social services began following Britain&#x27;s legislation of the 1833 Factory Act. The legislation set limits on the minimum age of children working, preventing children younger than nine years of age from working. Additionally, the Act set a limit of 48 working hours per week for children aged 9 to 13, and for children aged 13 to 18 it was set at 12 hours per day. The Act also was the first legislation requiring compulsory schooling within Britain. Another central development for the existence of social services was Switzerland&#x27;s legislation of the Factory Act in 1877. The Factory Act introduced limitations on working hours, provided maternity benefits and provided workplace protections for children and young adults. In Germany, Otto von Bismarck also introduced a large amount of social welfare legislation in this period. Mandatory sickness insurance was introduced in 1883, with workplace accident insurance enacted in 1884 alongside old age and invalidity schemes in 1889. Insurance laws of this kind were emulated in other European countries afterwards, with Sweden enacting voluntary sickness insurance in 1892, Denmark in 1892, Belgium in 1894, Switzerland in 1911, and Italy in 1886. Additionally, Belgium, France and Italy enacted legislation subsidising voluntary old-age insurance in this period. By the time the Netherlands introduced compulsory sickness insurance in 1913, all major European countries had introduced some form of insurance scheme.
==== South America (1910–1960) ====
According to Carmelo Meso-Lago, social services and welfare systems within South America developed in three separate stages, with three groups of countries developing at different rates. The first group, consisting of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica and Uruguay, developed social insurance schemes in the late 1910s and the 1920s. The notable schemes, which had been implemented by 1950, consisted of work injury insurance, pensions, and sickness and maternity insurance. The second group, consisting of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru and Venezuela, implemented these social services in the 1940s. The extent to which these programs and laws were implemented were less extensive than the first group. In the final group, consisting of the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras and Nicaragua, social services programmes were implemented in the 1950s and 1960s, with the least coverage out of each group. With the exception of Nicaragua, social service programs are not available for unemployment insurance or family allowances. Average expenditure on social services programs in as a percentage of GDP in these states is 5.3%, which is significantly lower than that of Europe and North America.

==== Asia (1950–2000) ====

Within Asia, the significant development of social services first began in Japan after the conclusion of World War II. Due to rising levels of social inequality in the 1950s following the reformation of the Japanese economy, the incumbent Liberal Democratic Party legislated extensive health insurance laws in 1958 and pensions in 1959 to address societal upheaval. In Singapore, a compulsory superannuation scheme was introduced in 1955. Within Korea, voluntary health insurance was made available in 1963 and mandated in 1976. Private insurance was only available to citizens employed by large corporate firms, while a separate insurance plans were provided to Civil Servants and military personnel. In Taiwan, the Kuomintang government in 1953 propagated a healthcare inclusive workers insurance programme. A separate insurance scheme for bureaucrats and the military was also provided in Korea in this time. In 1968, Singapore increased its social services program to include public housing, and expanding this further in 1984 to include medical care. Within both Korea and Taiwan, by the 1980s the number of workers that were covered by labour insurance had not increased above 20%.

Following domestic political upheaval within Asian countries in the 1980s, the availability social services considerably increased in the region. In 1988 in Korea, health insurance was granted to self-employed rural workers, with coverage extended to urban-based self-employed workers in 1989. Additionally, a national pension program was initiated. Within Taiwan, an extensive national health insurance system was enacted in 1994 and implemented in 1995. During this period the Japanese government also expanded social services for children and the elderly, providing increased support services, increasing funding to care facilities and organisations, and legislating new insurance programs. In the 1990s, Shanghai introduced a housing affordability program which was then later expanded to include all of China. In 2000, Hong Kong introduced a superannuation scheme policy, with China implementing a similar policy soon after.

== Impacts ==

=== Quality of life ===
There have been several findings which indicate that social services have a positive impact upon the quality of life of individuals. An OECD study in 2011 found that the countries with the highest ratings were Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland, while the lowest ratings were given by people from Estonia, Portugal and Hungary. Another study recorded by the Global Barometer of Happiness in 2011 found similar results. Both of these studies indicated that the most important aspects of quality of life to people were health, education, welfare and the cost of living. Additionally, the countries with the perception of high-quality public services, specifically Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and the Netherlands, scored the highest on levels of happiness. Conversely, Bulgaria, Romania, Lithuania and Italy, who scored low on levels of satisfaction of social services, had low levels of happiness, with some sociologists arguing this indicates there is a strong correlation between happiness and social services.

=== Poverty ===
Research indicates that welfare programs, which are included as a part of social services, have a considerable impact upon poverty rates in countries in which welfare expenditure accounts for over 20% of their GDP.

However, the impact of social service programs on poverty varies depending on the service. One paper conducted within China indicates that social services in the form of direct financial assistance does not have a positive impact on the reduction of poverty rates. The paper also stated that the provision of public services in the form of medical insurance, health services and hygiene protection have a &#x27;significantly positive&#x27; impact upon the reduction of poverty.
 
=== Expenditure on social welfare programs ===
The table below displays the welfare spending of countries as a percentage of their total GDP. The statistics are sourced from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

=== Health services ===

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the provision of health services is a significant factor in ensuring that individuals are able to maintain their health and wellbeing. The WHO identifies 16 health services that must be provided by countries to ensure that universal health coverage is achieved. These are classified under four categories: reproductive, maternal and children health services, infectious diseases, &#x27;noncommunicable&#x27; diseases, and basic access to medical services. OECD data reveals that the provision of universal health coverage leads to significantly positive outcomes on society. This includes a positive correlation between life expectancy and the provision of health services and a negative relationship between life expectancy and countries which&#x27;s social service programs do not provide universal healthcare coverage. Additionally, the density of the provision of healthcare services by the government is positively associated with increases in life expectancy.

=== Children ===
Within the area of child welfare, social services aim to provide help to children and their families, while providing mechanisms to ensure they are able to live safe, stable lives with a permanent home. In the United States, 3 million children are maltreated each year, with the overall economic costs of child maltreatment totalling up to US$80 billion annually. Social service programs cost the US$29 billion USD on child maltreatment prevention and child welfare services. According to researchers, social service programs are effective in reducing maltreatment and reducing overall economic costs to society, however the effectiveness of these programs are significantly reduced when they are not correctly implemented, or when these programs are not implemented together. The issues in which social services attempt at preventing for children include substance abuse, underemployment and unemployment, homelessness and criminal convictions. Social service programs within this area include family preservation, kinship care, foster and residential care.

=== Women ===
Empirical evidence suggests that social service programs have had a significant impact upon the employment of single mothers. Following 1996 welfare reform in the US, employment rates among single mothers have increased considerably from 60% in 1994 to 72% in 1999. Social services, particularly education, are considered by UNICEF as an effective method through which to combat gender inequality. Social services such as education may be employed to overcome discrimination and challenge gender norms. Social services, notably educational programs and aid provided by organisations such as UNICEF, are also essential in providing women strategies and tools to prevent and respond to domestic and family violence. Other examples of social services which may help address this issue include the police, welfare services, counselling, legal aid and healthcare.

=== Social services and COVID-19 ===

Social services have played a central role in the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Healthcare workers, public officials, teachers, social welfare officers and other public servants have provided critical services in containing the pandemic and ensuring society functions. The impact of the pandemic was compounded by the shortage of social services globally, with the world requiring six million more nurses and midwives to achieve the goals set within the Sustainable Development Goals at the time of the outbreak. Social services, such as education, have been required to adapt to changing social conditions while still providing essential services. Social services have expanded worldwide through the introduction of economic stimulus packages, with governments globally committing US$130 Billion as of June 2020 to manage the pandemic.

<doc id="194652" wikidata="Q217248" url="?curid=194652" title="Exile on Main St.">
<text>Exile on Main St. is the tenth studio album by the English rock band the Rolling Stones, released on 12 May 1972, by Rolling Stones Records. The 10th released in the UK and 12th in the US, it is viewed as a culmination of a string of the band&#x27;s most critically successful albums, following &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; (1968), &quot;Let It Bleed&quot; (1969) and &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; (1971). &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot; is known for its murky, inconsistent sound due to more disjointed musicianship and production, along with a party-like atmosphere heard in several tracks.

Recording began in 1969 at Olympic Studios in London during sessions for &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot;, with the main sessions beginning in mid-1971 at Nellcôte, a rented villa in the South of France, after the band members became tax exiles. Due to the lack of a professional studio nearby, they worked with a mobile recording studio and recorded in-house. The loose and unorganised Nellcôte sessions went on for hours into the night, with personnel varying greatly from day to day. Recording was completed with overdub sessions at Sunset Sound in Los Angeles and included additional musicians such as the pianist Nicky Hopkins, the saxophonist Bobby Keys, the drummer and producer Jimmy Miller, and the horn player Jim Price. The results produced enough songs for the Stones&#x27; first double album.

The band continued a back-to-basics direction heard in &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; after the experimental instrumentation of previous albums, yet &quot;Exile&quot; exhibited a wider range of influences in blues, rock and roll, swing, country and gospel, while the lyrics explored themes related to hedonism, sex and time. The album contains frequently-performed concert staples and topped the charts in six countries, including the UK, US and Canada. It included the singles &quot;Happy&quot;, which featured lead vocals from Keith Richards, the country ballad &quot;Sweet Virginia&quot;, and the worldwide top-ten hit &quot;Tumbling Dice&quot;. The album&#x27;s artwork, a collage of various images, reflected the Rolling Stones&#x27; prideful rebellion. After its release, the Stones embarked on an American tour, gaining infamy for riotous audiences and performances.

&quot;Exile on Main St.&quot; was originally met with mixed reviews before receiving strong reassessments by the end of the 1970s. It has since been recognized as a pivotal hard rock album, viewed by many critics as the Rolling Stones&#x27; best work and as one of the greatest albums of all time. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked the album number 7 on its list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; in 2003 and 2012, with it dropping to number 14 in the 2020 edition, consistently as the highest-ranked Rolling Stones album on the list. In 2012, the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, the band&#x27;s fourth album to be inducted. A remastered and expanded version of the album was released in 2010 featuring a bonus disc with 10 new tracks. Unusual for a re-release, it also charted highly at the time of its release, reaching number one in the UK and number two in the US.

==Recording==
===Early sessions===
&quot;Exile on Main St.&quot; was written and recorded between 1969 and 1972. Mick Jagger said, &quot;After we got out of our contract with Allen Klein, we didn&#x27;t want to give him [those earlier tracks],&quot; as they were forced to do with &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; and &quot;Wild Horses&quot; from &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; (1971). Many tracks were recorded between 1969 and 1971 at Olympic Studios and Jagger&#x27;s Stargroves country house in East Woodhay during sessions for &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot;.

By the spring of 1971 the Rolling Stones had spent the money they owed in taxes and left Britain before the government could seize their assets. Jagger settled in Paris with his new bride Bianca, and guitarist Keith Richards rented a villa, Nellcôte, in Villefranche-sur-Mer, near Nice. The other members settled in the south of France. As a suitable recording studio could not be found where they could continue work on the album, Richards&#x27; basement at Nellcôte became a makeshift studio using the band&#x27;s mobile recording truck.

===Nellcôte===
Recording began in earnest sometime near the middle of June. The bassist Bill Wyman recalls the band working all night, every night, from eight in the evening until three the following morning for the rest of the month. Wyman said of that period, &quot;Not everyone turned up every night. This was, for me, one of the major frustrations of this whole period. For our previous two albums we had worked well and listened to producer Jimmy Miller. At Nellcôte things were very different and it took me a while to understand why.&quot; By this time Richards had begun a daily habit of using heroin. Thousands of pounds&#x27; worth of heroin flowed through the mansion each week, along with visitors such as William S. Burroughs, Terry Southern, Gram Parsons, John Lennon, and Marshall Chess, the son of the famous blues impresario Leonard Chess, who had been recently recruited to serve as president of the Rolling Stones&#x27; new eponymous record label. Parsons was asked to leave Nellcôte in early July 1971, the result of his obnoxious behavior and an attempt by Richards to clean the house of drug users as the result of pressure from the French police.

Richards&#x27; substance abuse frequently prevented him from attending the sessions that continued in his basement, while Jagger and Wyman were often unable to attend sessions for other reasons. This often left the band in the position of having to record in altered forms. A notable instance was the recording of one of Richards&#x27; most famous songs, &quot;Happy&quot;. Recorded in the basement, Richards said in 1982, Happy&#x27; was something I did because I was for one time early for a session. There was Bobby Keys and Jimmy Miller. We had nothing to do and had suddenly picked up the guitar and played this riff. So we cut it and it&#x27;s the record, it&#x27;s the same. We cut the original track with a baritone sax, a guitar and Jimmy Miller on drums. And the rest of it is built up over that track. It was just an afternoon jam that everybody said, &#x27;Wow, yeah, work on it.

The basic band for the Nellcôte sessions consisted of Richards, Keys, Mick Taylor, Charlie Watts, Nicky Hopkins, Miller (who covered for the absent Watts on the aforementioned &quot;Happy&quot; and &quot;Shine a Light&quot;), and Jagger when he was available. Wyman did not like the ambiance of Richards&#x27; villa and sat out many of the French sessions. Although Wyman is credited on only eight songs of the released album, he told &quot;Bass Player&quot; magazine that the credits are incorrect and that he actually played on more tracks than that. The other bass parts were credited to Taylor, Richards and the session bassist Bill Plummer. Wyman noted in his memoir &quot;Stone Alone&quot; that there was a division between the band members and associates who freely indulged in drugs (Richards, Miller, Keys, Taylor and the engineer Andy Johns) and those who abstained to varying degrees (Wyman, Watts and Jagger).

===Los Angeles===
Work on basic tracks (including &quot;Rocks Off&quot;, &quot;Rip This Joint&quot;, &quot;Casino Boogie&quot;, &quot;Tumbling Dice&quot;, &quot;Torn and Frayed&quot;, &quot;Happy&quot;, &quot;Turd on the Run&quot;, &quot;Ventilator Blues&quot; and &quot;Soul Survivor&quot;) began in the basement of Nellcôte and was taken to Sunset Sound Recorders in Los Angeles, where overdubs (all lead and backing vocals, all guitar and bass overdubs) were added during sessions that meandered from December 1971 until March 1972. Although Jagger was frequently missing from Nellcôte, he took charge during the second stage of recording in Los Angeles, arranging for the keyboardists Billy Preston and Dr. John and the cream of the city&#x27;s session backup vocalists to record layers of overdubs. The final gospel-inflected arrangements of &quot;Tumbling Dice&quot;, &quot;Loving Cup&quot;, &quot;Let It Loose&quot; and &quot;Shine a Light&quot; were inspired by Jagger, Preston, and Watts&#x27; visit to a local evangelical church where Aretha Franklin was recording what would become the live album/movie &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;.

The extended recording sessions and differing methods on the part of Jagger and Richards reflected the growing disparity in their personal lives. During the making of the album, Jagger had married Bianca, followed closely by the birth of their only child, Jade, in October 1971. Richards was firmly attached to his girlfriend Anita Pallenberg, yet both were in the throes of heroin addiction, which Richards would not overcome until the turn of the decade.

==Music and lyrics==
According to Bill Janovitz, in his account of the album for the 33⅓ book series, &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot; features &quot;a seemingly infinite amount of subtle (and not so subtle) variations on rock &amp; roll – a form that had seemed to be severely limited to basic, guitar-driven music.&quot; The music biographer John Perry writes that the Rolling Stones had developed a style of hard rock for the album that is &quot;entirely modern yet rooted in 1950s rock &amp; roll and 1930s–1940s swing&quot;. Stephen Thomas Erlewine, writing for AllMusic, described &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot; as &quot;a sprawling, weary double album&quot; featuring &quot;a series of dark, dense jams&quot; that encompass rock and roll, blues, country, and gospel styles. The &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writer Richard Gehr compared the album to outlaw music and observed a strong influence of music from the American South in its &quot;loose-limbed&quot; explorations of 1950s rock, African-American soul, and gospel country.

Although &quot;Exile&quot; is often thought to reflect Richards&#x27; vision for a raw, rootsy rock sound, Jagger was already expressing his boredom with rock and roll in several interviews at the time of the album&#x27;s release. Jagger&#x27;s stance on &quot;Exile&quot;″s rock and roll sound at the time is interpreted by the music academic Barry J. Faulk to seemingly &quot;signal the end of the Stones&#x27; conscious attempt to revive American-style roots rock&quot;. With Richards&#x27; effectiveness seriously undermined by his dependence on heroin, the group&#x27;s subsequent 1970s releases – directed largely by Jagger – would experiment to varying degrees with other musical genres, moving away from the rootsy influences of &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot;

According to Robert Christgau, &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot; expands on the hedonistic themes the band had explored on previous albums such as &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot;. As he writes, &quot;It piled all the old themes – sex as power, sex as love, sex as pleasure, distance, craziness, release – on top of an obsession with time that was more than appropriate in men pushing 30 who were still committed to what was once considered youth music.&quot;

==Packaging==
For &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot;, Mick Jagger wanted an album cover that reflected the band as &quot;runaway outlaws using the blues as its weapon against the world&quot;, showcasing &quot;feeling of joyful isolation, grinning in the face of a scary and unknown future&quot;. As the band finished the album in Los Angeles, they approached the designer John Van Hamersveld and his photographer partner Norman Seeff, and also invited the documentary photographer Robert Frank. The same day Seeff photographed the Stones at their Bel Air mansion, Frank took Jagger for photographs at Los Angeles&#x27; Main Street. The location was the 500 block near the Leonide Hotel. At the time there was a pawnshop, a shoeshine business and a pornographic theatre (The Galway Theatre) at the location. Still, Van Hamersveld and Jagger chose the cover image from an already existing Frank photograph, an outtake from his seminal 1958 book &quot;The Americans&quot;. Named &quot;Tattoo Parlor&quot; but possibly taken from Hubert&#x27;s Dime museum in New York City, the image is a collage of circus performers and freaks, such as &quot;Three Ball Charlie&quot;, a 1930s sideshow performer from Humboldt, Nebraska, who holds three balls (a tennis ball, a golf ball, and a &quot;5&quot; billiard ball) in his mouth; Joe &quot;The Human Corkscrew&quot; Allen, pictured in a postcard-style advertisement, a contortionist with the ability to wiggle and twist through a hoop; and Hezekiah Trambles, &quot;The Congo Jungle Freak&quot;, a man who dressed as an African savage, in a picture taken by the then recently deceased Diane Arbus. The Seeff pictures were repurposed as 12 perforated postcards inside the sleeve, while Frank&#x27;s Main Street photographs were used in the gatefold and back cover collage made by Van Hamersveld, which features other pictures Frank took of the band and their crew—including their assistant Chris O&#x27;Dell, a former acquaintance of Van Hamersveld who brought him to the Stones—and other &quot;The Americans&quot; outtakes.

==Release and reception==

&quot;Exile on Main St.&quot; was first released on 12 May 1972 as a double album by Rolling Stones Records. It was the band&#x27;s tenth studio album released in the United Kingdom. Preceded by the UK (number 5) and US (number 7) Top 10 hit &quot;Tumbling Dice&quot;, &quot;Exile on Main St&quot; was an immediate commercial success, reaching number 1 worldwide just as the band embarked on their celebrated 1972 American Tour. Their first American tour in three years, it featured many songs from the new album. The Richards-sung &quot;Happy&quot; was released as a second single to capitalize on the tour; it would peak at number 22 in the United States in August.

After the release of &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot;, Allen Klein sued the Rolling Stones for breach of settlement because five songs on the album were composed while Jagger and Richards were under contract with his company, ABKCO: &quot;Sweet Virginia&quot;, &quot;Loving Cup&quot;, &quot;All Down the Line&quot;, &quot;Shine a Light&quot; and &quot;Stop Breaking Down&quot; (written by Robert Johnson but re-interpreted by Jagger and Richards). ABKCO acquired publishing rights to the songs, giving it a share of the royalties from &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot;, and was able to release another album of Rolling Stones songs, &quot;More Hot Rocks (Big Hits &amp; Fazed Cookies)&quot;.

&quot;Exile on Main St.&quot; was not well received by some contemporary critics, who found the quality of the songs inconsistent. Reviewing in July 1972 for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Lenny Kaye said the record has &quot;a tight focus on basic components of the Stones&#x27; sound as we&#x27;ve always known it,&quot; including blues-based rock music with a &quot;pervading feeling of blackness&quot;. However, he added that the uneven quality of songs means &quot;the great Stones album of their mature period is yet to come&quot;. Richard Williams of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; was more enthusiastic and deemed it the band&#x27;s best album, writing that it will &quot;take its place in history&quot; as the music &quot;utterly repulses the sneers and arrows of outraged put down artists. Once and for all, it answers any questions about their ability as rock &#x27;n&#x27; rollers.&quot; Geoffrey Cannon of &quot;The Guardian&quot; agreed, stating: &quot;&quot;Exile On Main Street&quot; will go down as [the Stones&#x27;] classic album, made at the height of their musical powers and self-confidence.&quot; The &quot;NME&quot;″s Roy Carr gave additional praise to the tracks, praising the styles present, the performances of the band and the lyrical content. In a year-end list for &quot;Newsday&quot;, Christgau named it the best album of 1972, stating the &quot;fagged-out masterpiece&quot; marks the peak of rock music for the year as it &quot;explored new depths of record-studio murk, burying Mick&#x27;s voice under layers of cynicism, angst and ennui&quot;.

==Legacy and reappraisal==

Critics later reassessed &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot; favourably, and by the late 1970s it had become viewed as the Rolling Stones&#x27; greatest album. In retrospect, Janovitz called it &quot;the greatest, most soulful, &quot;rock &amp; roll&quot; record ever made&quot; because it seamlessly distills &quot;perhaps all the essential elements of rock &amp; roll up to 1971, if not beyond&quot;. He added that it is &quot;the single greatest rock &amp; roll record of all time&quot;, distinguished from other contending albums by the Beatles or &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, which are more &quot;brilliant pop records&quot;. On the response to the album, Richards said, &quot;When [&quot;Exile&quot;] came out it didn&#x27;t sell particularly well at the beginning, and it was also pretty much universally panned. But within a few years the people who had written the reviews saying it was a piece of crap were extolling it as the best frigging album in the world.&quot;

In 2003, Jagger said, &quot;&quot;Exile&quot; is not one of my favourite albums, although I think the record does have a particular feeling. I&#x27;m not too sure how great the songs are, but put together it&#x27;s a nice piece. However, when I listen to &quot;Exile&quot; it has some of the worst mixes I&#x27;ve ever heard. I&#x27;d love to remix the record, not just because of the vocals, but because generally I think it sounds lousy. At the time Jimmy Miller was not functioning properly. I had to finish the whole record myself, because otherwise there were just these drunks and junkies. Of course I&#x27;m ultimately responsible for it, but it&#x27;s really not good and there&#x27;s no concerted effort or intention.&quot; Jagger also stated he did not understand the praise among Rolling Stones fans because the album did not yield many hits.

Richards also said, &quot;&quot;Exile&quot; was a double album. And because it&#x27;s a double album you&#x27;re going to be hitting different areas, including &#x27;D for Down&#x27;, and the Stones really felt like exiles. We didn&#x27;t start off intending to make a double album; we just went down to the south of France to make an album and by the time we&#x27;d finished we said, &#x27;We want to put it all out.&#x27; The point is that the Stones had reached a point where we no longer had to do what we were told to do. Around the time Andrew Oldham left us, we&#x27;d done our time, things were changing and I was no longer interested in hitting Number One in the charts every time. What I want to do is good shit—if it&#x27;s good they&#x27;ll get it some time down the road.&quot;

===Accolades===
&quot;Exile on Main St.&quot; has been ranked on various lists as one of the greatest albums of all time. In 1987, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it third on a list of the 100 best albums from 1967–1987. In 1993, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; placed it first on their list of &quot;100 Greatest CDs&quot;. In 1998, &quot;Q&quot; magazine readers voted &quot;Exile on Main St&quot; the 42nd-greatest album of all time, while in 2000 the same magazine placed it at number 3 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever. In 2003, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked it number 11 on their Top 100 Albums of the 1970s. In 2001, VH1 placed it at number 12 on their greatest albums list. In 2003, it was ranked 7th on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, maintaining the rank in a 2012 revision, but dropping to number 14 on the 2020 and 2023 revisions of the list, the highest Rolling Stones album ranked on the list. In 2005, &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot; was ranked number 286 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot;″s book &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. It was ranked number 19 on the October 2006 issue of &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the greatest 100 guitar albums of all time. In 2007, the National Association of Recording Merchandisers (NARM) and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame placed it sixth on the &quot;Definitive 200&quot; list of albums that &quot;every music lover should own.&quot; It was voted number 35 in the 3rd edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000) and was included in &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

Its re-release has a highest normalised rating of 100 on Metacritic based on seven professional reviews, a distinction it shares with other re-releases such as &quot;London Calling&quot; by The Clash. In 2012, it was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. Tom Waits named it one of his favorite albums: &quot;this is just a tree of life. This record is the watering hole. Keith Richards plays his ass off. This has the Checkerboard Lounge all over it.&quot;

===In popular culture===
The album and its title have been referenced several times in popular culture.

The garage-trash noise-rock band Pussy Galore released a complete cover of the album, titled &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot;, that reflected their personal and musical interpretations of the songs, rather than paying tribute to the original sound. John Duffy of AllMusic rated their album three and a half out of five stars, and &quot;NME&quot; ranked it number 253 in &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;.

The British acid house group Alabama 3 titled its debut album &quot;Exile on Coldharbour Lane&quot;. Perhaps the most notable reference comes from indie singer/songwriter Liz Phair&#x27;s debut album &quot;Exile in Guyville&quot;. Phair claimed the album to be a direct song-by-song &quot;response&quot; of sorts to &quot;Exile on Main St&quot;. Post-grunge band Matchbox Twenty paid homage by titling their 2007 retrospective &quot;Exile on Mainstream&quot;. Industrial rock band Chemlab named the leading track from their album &quot;East Side Militia&quot;, &quot;Exile on Mainline&quot;, in reference to the Rolling Stones album.

&quot;The Departed&quot;, a 2006 film by Martin Scorsese, features a scene in which Bill Costigan mails Madolyn Madden an &quot;Exile on Main St&quot; jewel case containing an incriminating recording of Colin Sullivan conspiring with crime boss Frank Costello. The same film also uses the song &quot;Let It Loose&quot; from the album. On 31 October 2009, American rock band Phish covered &quot;Exile on Main St&quot; in its entirety as the &quot;musical costume&quot; for their Halloween show in Indio, California. The first episode of the fourth season of the Showtime program &quot;Californication&quot; is called &quot;Exile on Main St&quot;. A later episode in the sixth season featured a guest character waking up next to her musician boyfriend who had died from an overdose in the night in room &quot;1009,&quot; a reference to the lyrics of &quot;Shine a Light&quot;. The same song was also played by Tim Minchin&#x27;s character in the following episode. The first episode of the sixth season of the hit CW show &quot;Supernatural&quot; is titled &quot;Exile on Main Street&quot;.

==Reissues==
In 1994, &quot;Exile on Main St&quot; was remastered and reissued by Virgin Records, along with the rest of the post-&quot;Get Yer Ya-Ya&#x27;s Out&quot; catalogue, after the company acquired the masters to the band&#x27;s output on its own label. This remaster was initially released in a Collector&#x27;s Edition CD, which replicated in miniature many elements of the original vinyl album packaging, including the postcards insert.

Universal Music, which remastered and re-released the rest of the post-1970 Rolling Stones catalogue in 2009, issued a new remastering of &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot; in Europe on 17 May 2010 and in the United States the next day, featuring a bonus disc with ten new tracks. Of the ten bonus tracks, only two are undoctored outtakes from the original sessions: an early version of &quot;Tumbling Dice&quot; entitled &quot;Good Time Women&quot;, and &quot;Soul Survivor&quot;, the latter featuring a Richards lead vocal (with dummy/placeholder lyrics). The other tracks received overdubs just prior to release on this package, with new lead vocals by Jagger on all except &quot;I&#x27;m Not Signifying&quot;, backing vocals in places by past and current Stones tour singers Cindy Mizelle and Lisa Fischer, and several new guitar parts by Keith Richards and Mick Taylor on &quot;Plundered My Soul.&quot; On the selection of tracks, Richards said, &quot;Well, basically it&#x27;s the record and a few tracks we found when we were plundering the vaults. Listening back to everything we said, &#x27;Well, this would be an interesting addition.. All harmonica heard was added during 2010 sessions by Jagger, and Richards added a new guitar lead on &quot;So Divine&quot;. &quot;Title 5&quot; is not an actual outtake from the sessions for &quot;Exile&quot;, it is an outtake from early 1967 sessions. It features the MRB effect (mid-range boost) from a Vox Conqueror or Supreme amp, as used by Richards in 1967 and 1968. &quot;Loving Cup&quot; is an outtake from early June 1969, but is actually an edit from two outtakes. The first 2 minutes and 12 seconds is the well-known &#x27;drunk&#x27; version, as has been available on bootlegs since the early 1990s, but the second part is spliced from a second, previously unknown take. &quot;Following the River&quot; features Jagger overdubs on a previously uncirculated track featuring Nicky Hopkins on piano.

The re-released album entered at number one in the UK charts, almost 38 years to the week after it first occupied that position. The album also re-entered at number two in the US charts selling 76,000 during the first week. The bonus disc, available separately as &quot;Exile on Main St Rarities Edition&quot; exclusively in the US at Target also charted, debuting at number 27 with 15,000 copies sold.

It was released once again in 2011 by Universal Music Enterprises in a Japanese-only SHM-SACD version.

<text>Wilfredo Vázquez Olivera (born August 2, 1960) is a Puerto Rican former professional boxer who competed from 1981 to 2002. He held world championships in three weight classes, including the WBA bantamweight title from 1987 to 1988, the WBA super bantamweight title from 1992 to 1995, and the WBA and lineal featherweight titles from 1996 to 1998. His son, Wilfredo Vázquez Jr., is also a former boxer and world champion.

==Early life and amateur career==
Vázquez was born in Río Piedras, one of the largest districts of San Juan, but he was raised in Bayamón. Unlike most Puerto Rican boxers, he began practicing the basics of boxing when he was 18 years old. Vázquez began training in November 1978, two weeks after the death of his father, Juan Vázquez. His decision was directly influenced by his father&#x27;s desire of having a son that practiced boxing. Juan Vázquez was a follower of Wilfredo Gómez and died shortly after purchasing tickets for Gomez&#x27;s fight against Carlos Zarate. This affected Vázquez, who decided to mimic Gómez and win a professional world championship, drawing motivation from his accomplishments. He began training at Ruiz Soler gym, where he met several boxers that he regarded as &quot;world class&quot; material, but all of them failed to reach success after following other paths. As an amateur, Vázquez fought 17 times, losing three contests. He didn&#x27;t pursue a spot in Puerto Rico&#x27;s national boxing team, considering that at his age it would be hard to earn a spot, while being expecting to earn money quickly as a professional. Vázquez married Alice Lozada, with whom he has three sons, Wilfredo, Jr., Noel and Israel.

==Professional career==
Vázquez debuted as a professional on January 29, 1981, training under the guidance of Manny Siaca. In this contest, he lost to William Ramos by unanimous decision in a four-round fight. After this fight, he won his first victory in his second fight, defeating Felix Cortez by knockout in two rounds. This was followed by a second knockout against Roberto Mercedes, who debuted against Vázquez. On April 30, 1981, he scored the first draw of his career, in a six-round fight against Eusebio Espinal. Vázquez&#x27;s first contest outside of Puerto Rico was against Reinaldo Roque, whom he defeated by knockout in Miami, Florida. In his next match, he won the first decision of his career scoring a points victory over Herminio Adorno. Vázquez was scheduled to participate in Don King&#x27;s Carnival of Champions card, where Gómez and Wilfred Benítez competed, but an injury suffered during training left him out of the event. In the last fight of this year, he defeated Pedro Alindato by knockout. On March 3, 1982, Vázquez beat Orlando Perez by points. He would fight eight more times during this year, all of them in New York City or Las Vegas. In these fights, Vázquez defeated Ion Trian, Jose Luis Martinez, Sonny Long and Rudy Perez twice. In 1983, he fought five times, winning every contest by knockout. His opponents during this time frame were: Euginio Paulino, Andres Torres, Robert Mullins, Ramón Cruz and Pedro Rodriguez. On March 17, 1984, Vázquez defeated Juan &quot;Chiqui&quot; Torres by knockout in the fourth round to win the vacant Puerto Rican bantamweight title. In his next fight, Vázquez received the first no contest of his career against Julio Guerrero. He closed the year defeating Javier Barajas and Norgie Castro. In 1985, Vázquez had a slow year, only fighting twice. His only contests were against Jeff Whaley and Osvaldo Acevedo, both of whom he defeated by technical knockout.

===First title shot===
On February 8, 1986, Vázquez received his first opportunity for a world championship against Miguel &quot;Happy&quot; Lora, who held the World Boxing Council&#x27;s bantamweight championship. Vázquez received a knockdown the second round, before scoring one in the fourth round. After twelve rounds, the judges awarded Lora a unanimous decision. His next fight was against José &quot;Pambelito&quot; Cervantes, who had fought for the WBC&#x27;s super bantamweight championship five years earlier. Vázquez won this contest by knockout in the third round. After losing to Antonio Avelar by eighth round knockout, he concluded the year defeating Jesus Muñiz. On March 14, 1987, Vázquez defeated Juan Carazo by technical knockout in the first round. Less than a month later, he defeated Lee Cargle in five rounds.

===WBA bantamweight champion===
On October 4, 1987, Vázquez earned a second titular opportunity, receiving a fight against Chan-yong Park in South Korea. He won the fight by knockout in the tenth round to become the World Boxing Association&#x27;s champion. 
Vázquez&#x27;s first defense was versus Takuya Muguruma in a card organized in Osaka. The fight was declared a draw, although two of the judges scored it 116-114 and 117-112 in favor of Vázquez, while the third considered it a 115-115 tie. Subsequently, he defended against Kaokor Galaxy in Thailand, losing by split decision. The scores were 112-115 and 113-115 in favor of Galaxy and 114-113 in favor of Vázquez. Three months later, he returned to action against Raúl Pérez, but lost by unanimous decision in 10 rounds. Following this defeat, Vázquez signed a contract with Felix &quot;Tutico&quot; Zabala who managed to secure a regional title fight against Fernie Morales. The contest was for the International Boxing Federation&#x27;s Inter-Continental bantamweight championship, in twelve rounds, Vázquez earned a points victory. This was followed by a knockout victory in preparatory fight against Patrick Kamy, which was part of a card organized in Spain. On June 19, 1990, Vázquez fought against Israel Contreras, who won by knockout, earning what was regarded as an unexpected victory. After recovering from this loss, he defeated Joe Orewa to win the International Boxing Council&#x27;s super bantamweight title on September 10, 1990. Vázquez closed the year with a technical knockout victory over Atenor Solar. On April 8, 1991, he defeated Paquito Openo by knockout in seven rounds.

===WBA super bantamweight champion===
This win earned Vázquez an opportunity for the WBA&#x27;s super bantamweight championship. The fight was a rematch against Raúl Pérez and it took place on March 27, 1992. After scoring a knockdown in the second round, Vázquez defeated Pérez by technical knockout in the third, when the fight was interrupted seconds after a second knockdown. After defeating Juan Batista Bisono in a preparatory fight, Vázquez began a series of successful defenses. The first of these was a majority decision over Freddy Cruz in Italy. This was followed by victories over Thierry Jacob, Luis Enrique Mendoza, Thierry Jacob, a controversial points win against Juan Polo Perez in France, Hiroaki Yokota and Yūichi Kasai in Japan and Jae-Won Choi and Orlando Canizales in the United States. Due to his tendency of competing in title fights outside of Puerto Rico, Vázquez became known as &quot;El Viajero&quot;, Spanish for &quot;the traveler&quot;. His fight against Canizales was recognized by Home Box Office as the best in the division. On May 13, 1995, he competed in his first defense in Bayamón, losing the fight against Antonio Cermeño by points. In his first fight since this loss, Vázquez scored a solid victory over Pablo &quot;Mulato&quot; Valenzuela. After this fight, he returned to action in Ponce, defeating Carlos Rocha by knockout in the first round. His last fight of the year was against Jose Luis Velazquez whom he defeated by technical knockout to win the vacant WBA Fedelatin featherweight championship.

===WBA and lineal featherweight champion===
On May 18, 1996, Vázquez fought Eloy Rojas for the &quot;lineal&quot; &amp; WBA featherweight championships in Las Vegas. Rojas held the championships and entered the fight with a record of 33-1, which made him a favorite to retain the titles. Until the eleventh round, Rojas had a lead in all of the judges&#x27; scorecards, with scores of 98-92, 92-100 and 94-96. During the break between rounds, his corner told Vázquez that he was losing, surprising him since he considered that the fight was close to the point of being tied. Realizing this fact, he pressured the offensive, scoring two knockdowns which prompted the referee to stop the fight as a technical knockout. On December 7, 1996, Vázquez made his first defense of the titles against Bernardo Mendoza. He dominated the first four rounds by boxing, limiting his offense while Mendoza presented a timid offensive. During the final minute of the fifth round, Vázquez noticed an opening in Mendoza&#x27;s defense and landed a combination that scored a knockdown. Mendoza was able to stand before the conclusion of the protection count, but his corner submitted following a second knockdown. On August 23, 1997, Vázquez defended against Roque Cassiani. Throughout the fight, Cassini moved his head from side to side, which resulted in multiple head butts. Due to this, Vázquez pursued the offensive but retained a cautious approach. In the tenth round, he slipped and fell to the floor as Cassini threw a punch, which was scored as a knockdown. Vázquez was eventually declared the winner by unanimous decision, with scores 118-110, 116-112 and 116-110. On November 8, 1997, he defeated Genaro Ríos to retain for the third time. In March 1998, the WBA stripped the championship from Vázquez, citing that he failed to meet the organisation&#x27;s regulation by not signing a contract against their first contender, Antonio Cermeño, within the established time. He openly expressed anger over the issue, citing that a contract was solicited but not signed due to managerial differences with Don King.

====Vázquez vs. Hamed====

This was followed by a contest against the World Boxing Organization&#x27;s champion, Naseem Hamed. The fight took place on April 18, 1998, being held in Manchester. Hamed used his speed to control the offensive, scoring four knockdowns. In the seventh round, the referee stopped the contest following a second consecutive knockdown. Vázquez&#x27;s best round was the fifth, where he outscored Hamed, landing 26 punches against 4. Vázquez would lose his lineal championship to Hamed. This was the most lucrative fight of his career, when he received $600,000 as payment. This fight caused tension within his family, who were being informed by telephone of the results. From this point onwards, Vázquez began fighting sporadically.

===Later career===
In 2000, he returned after a year on inactivity, defeating Antonio Oscar Salas and Russell Mosley before losing to Juan Lazcano in a contest for the vacant NABF lightweight championship. On December 13, 200, he announced his retirement, but returned to action on February 22, 2002, defeating José Alfonso Rodríguez. Vázquez closed his career that year after defeating Julio César Cardona and Eddie Saenz twice, including his last fight that was held in Bayamón.

==Retirement and legacy==
Following his first retirement, Vázquez followed a practice done also by other pugilists, such as Juan Laporte, Félix Trinidad, Julio César Chávez, Bobby Czyz, Sean O&#x27;Grady, Sugar Ray Leonard, Santos Laciar, Lennox Lewis, Roy Jones Jr. and Héctor Camacho among others, deciding to become a boxing commentator. Since he was sure that this retirement was definitive, the pugilist joined Univision and began narrating fights along the network&#x27;s other sportscasters. Following his second retirement, Vázquez began working as a boxing trainer. Under this office, he has most notably trained his two sons, Wilfredo and Israel. Vázquez, Jr. debuted as a professional on December 8, 2006, being managed by Rubén Zavala and his promotion All Star Boxing. Vázquez has expressed that he didn&#x27;t want his son to become a boxer, expecting him to study and develop a profession within the fields of law, but he accepted to train him after noticing real interest, despite knowing that he lacked any amateur experience. Subsequently, he noted his interest to be one half of the first father and son duo to win world championships in Puerto Rico. On September 12, 2008, Vázquez, Jr. won his first professional championship, the WBO Latino super bantamweight title, before incorporating the WBA Fedecentro super bantamweight title to his résumé two months later. On February 27, 2010, Vázquez, Jr. won the WBO&#x27;s super bantamweight world championship joining his father as the third father-and-son combination to win world championships. They also became the first to do so in the same division. Israel Vázquez debuted on his brother&#x27;s second defense, competing in the light flyweight division.

Outside of the championships won as an active boxer, Vázquez also received other recognitions due to his work. In 1996, he received the Frank Parilla Award from the Puerto Rico Boxing Commission, which is awarded to the boxer that is universally regarded as the best Puerto Rican Boxer of the year. He won this recognition after he made history by becoming the first boxer to win three separate titles within the same organisation, in this case the World Boxing Association. That same year, the WBA gave him the award for &quot;Best Latin American Boxer of the Year&quot;. Vázquez subsequently commented that he expected to win the &quot;Boxer of the Year&quot; award that was won by Evander Holyfield, but he accepted the selection under the circumstances. He is the only Puerto Rican boxer to be honored by having a long-distance foot race named after him, with the &quot;Maratón Wilfredo Vázquez&quot; being held annually in Bayamón since 1988.

Prior to many of his fights, Vázquez spent months training for them at Toluca, Mexico, a city that was also favored by such other boxing luminaries as Chávez and Salvador Sánchez for such practice

<text>Highly Evolved is the debut studio album by Australian alternative rock band the Vines, released in July 2002 on Capitol Records and produced by Rob Schnapf. The album was a significant success, riding the wave of the garage rock revival trend and earning critical acclaim, including being named the 2nd best album of 2002 by NME and being included in &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot; and &quot;100 Best Australian Albums.&quot;

== Release ==
&quot;Highly Evolved was&quot; released on 14 July 2002 on Capitol Records. Produced by Rob Schnapf, known for his collaboration with Tom Rothrock on Elliott Smith&#x27;s albums &quot;Either/Or&quot;, &quot;XO&quot;, and &quot;Figure 8&quot;, &quot;Highly Evolved&quot; was an immensely popular debut, part of a trend towards garage rock revival bands known as much for the relentless hype from the UK music press as for their music; the Vines were frequently compared to Nirvana. The debut single, &quot;Highly Evolved&quot;, was chosen as Single of the Week by influential British music magazine &quot;NME&quot;. The magazine also voted it the 2nd best album of the year in 2002. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In October 2010, it was listed in the book &quot;100 Best Australian Albums&quot;.

== Recording and mastering ==

&quot;Highly Evolved&quot; was recorded and mixed at The Sound Factory and Sunset Sound Recorders in Hollywood, California. It was recorded between July 2001 and February 2002.

<text>Leonid Vitalyevich Kantorovich (, ; 19 January 19127 April 1986) was a Soviet mathematician and economist, known for his theory and development of techniques for the optimal allocation of resources. He is regarded as the founder of linear programming. He was the winner of the Stalin Prize in 1949 and the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1975.

== Biography ==
Kantorovich was born on 19 January 1912, to a Russian Jewish family. His father was a doctor practicing in Saint Petersburg. In 1926, at the age of fourteen, he began his studies at Leningrad State University. He graduated from the Faculty of Mathematics and Mechanics in 1930, and began his graduate studies. In 1934, at the age of 22 years, he became a full professor. In 1935 he received his doctoral degree.

Later, Kantorovich worked for the Soviet government. He was given the task of optimizing production in a plywood industry. He devised the mathematical technique now known as linear programming in 1939, some years before it was advanced by George Dantzig. He authored several books including &quot;The Mathematical Method of Production Planning and Organization&quot; (Russian original 1939), &quot;The Best Uses of Economic Resources&quot; (Russian original 1959), and, with Vladimir Ivanovich Krylov, &quot;Approximate methods of higher analysis&quot; (Russian original 1936). For his work, Kantorovich was awarded the Stalin Prize in 1949.

After 1939, he became a professor at Military Engineering-Technical University. During the Siege of Leningrad, Kantorovich was a professor at VITU of Navy and worked on safety of the Road of Life. He calculated the optimal distance between cars on ice in dependence of the thickness of ice and the temperature of the air. In December 1941 and January 1942, Kantorovich walked himself between cars driving on the ice of Lake Ladoga on the Road of Life to ensure that cars did not sink. However, many cars with food for survivors of the siege were destroyed by the German airstrikes. For his feat and courage Kantorovich was awarded the Order of the Patriotic War, and was decorated with the medal &quot;For Defense of Leningrad&quot;. 

In 1948 Kantorovich was assigned to the atomic project of the USSR.

After 1960, Kantorovich lived and worked in Novosibirsk, where he created and took charge of the Department of Computational Mathematics in Novosibirsk State University.

The Nobel Memorial Prize, which he shared with Tjalling Koopmans, was given &quot;for their contributions to the theory of optimum allocation of resources.&quot;

==Mathematics==
In mathematical analysis, Kantorovich had important results in functional analysis, approximation theory, and operator theory.

In particular, Kantorovich formulated some fundamental results in the theory of normed vector lattices, especially in Dedekind complete vector lattices called &quot;K-spaces&quot; which are now referred to as &quot;Kantorovich spaces&quot; in his honor.

Kantorovich showed that functional analysis could be used in the analysis of iterative methods, obtaining the Kantorovich inequalities on the convergence rate of the gradient method and of Newton&#x27;s method (see the Kantorovich theorem).

Kantorovich considered infinite-dimensional optimization problems, such as the Kantorovich-Monge problem in transport theory. His analysis proposed the Kantorovich–Rubinstein metric, which is used in probability theory, in the theory of the weak convergence of probability measures.

<doc id="194662" wikidata="Q6435354" url="?curid=194662" title="Kozmo.com">
<text>Kozmo.com was a venture capital–funded online company that promised free one-hour delivery of &quot;videos, games, DVDs, music, mags, books, food, basics and more&quot; and Starbucks coffee in several major cities in the United States. It was founded in March 1998 by young investment bankers Joseph Park and Yong Kang in New York City, and was out of business by April 2001. The company is often cited as an example of the dot-com bubble. In January 2013, the brand was bought by Yummy.com and announced that they would relaunch soon. In March 2018, Kozmo was relaunched as a warehouse club. The Kozmo.com website is offline as of July 2023.

==Model==
Kozmo had a business model built around the delivery of small purchased goods within an hour by bicycle, car, truck, or public transportation for no delivery fee. The model was criticized by some business analysts, who said that one-hour point-to-point delivery of small objects is extremely expensive and were skeptical that Kozmo could make a profit as long as it refused to charge delivery fees. The company countered in part that, in their target markets, savings due to not needing to rent space for retail stores would exceed delivery costs.

==History==
Kozmo.com&#x27;s headquarters was in New York City. According to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in 1999 the company had revenue of $3.5 million, with a resulting net loss of $26.3 million. The company had raised probably about $250 million, including $28 million from a group of investors in 1999 which included Flatiron, Oak and Chase and $60 million from Amazon.com in 2000. It had entered a five-year co-marketing agreement with Starbucks in February 2000, in which it agreed to pay Starbucks $150 million ($ in ) to promote its services inside the company&#x27;s coffee shops. This included up to 500 Starbucks locations to host drop-boxes in-store for video returns. Kozmo.com ended its deal in March 2001 after paying out $15 million (~$ in ). In July 2000, at the height of its business, the company operated in Atlanta, Chicago, Houston, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland, Boston, New York, Washington, D.C., San Diego, and Los Angeles. Kozmo filed an IPO with Credit Suisse First Boston, but never went public.

The company was the subject of an April 2000 report by MSNBC.com reporters Brock N. Meeks and Elliot Zaret claiming that Kozmo was redlining sections of the cities it served that were populated primarily by African Americans. Kozmo denied that race played any part in its decision on what zip codes to deliver to, saying it chose market areas based primarily on Internet penetration rates. The Equal Rights Center (ERC), the Washington, DC–based civil rights group referenced in the article, pursued the company about the allegations. Later in the year, the ERC announced a joint initiative with Kozmo and stated that &quot;Kozmo&#x27;s initial service area was not motivated by racial discrimination,&quot; and Kozmo committed $125,000 toward increased Internet availability for underserved communities.

While popular with college students and young professionals, the company failed soon after the burst of the dot-com bubble, laying off its staff of 1,100 employees and shutting down in April 2001. Employees at many of the company&#x27;s 18 locations found out about the shutdown only after arriving to work their scheduled shifts and finding the doors locked. Those locations, as well as their Memphis distribution center, were soon liquidated by a veteran entertainment wholesaler from Florida.

==Post-Kozmo==
The documentary film &quot;e-Dreams&quot;, released in June 2001, depicts the growth and fate of the company. 
In April 2005, former CTO Chris Siragusa launched &quot;MaxDelivery&quot;, a Kozmo-like service in downtown Manhattan specializing in the delivery of food, wine, DVDs and essentials, and is still in business as of November, 2018.

Joseph Park, former co-founder and CEO, went on to co-found Askville in 2006, which is now part of Amazon.com. Park left Amazon.com in June 2009 to become president of BibleGateway.com, which is owned by Zondervan, a Christian publisher that is a unit of HarperCollins (which is owned by News Corp.).

Yong Kang, former co-founder, returned to Wall Street, and as of June 2008 listed his occupation as investment banking at Lehman Brothers (now Barclays Capital).

Some grocery-store delivery chains offering online ordering with same-day delivery survived the dot-com bust, and in the 2010s various competing same-day delivery services started in larger U.S. cities.

<text>The Flintstones is a 1994 American family comedy film directed by Brian Levant and written by Tom S. Parker, Jim Jennewein, and Steven E. de Souza based on the 1960–1966 animated television series of the same name by Hanna-Barbera. The film stars John Goodman as Fred Flintstone, Rick Moranis as Barney Rubble, Elizabeth Perkins as Wilma Flintstone, and Rosie O&#x27;Donnell as Betty Rubble, along with Kyle MacLachlan as Cliff Vandercave, a villainous executive-vice president of Fred&#x27;s company, Halle Berry as Sharon Stone, his seductive secretary, and Elizabeth Taylor (in her final theatrical film appearance) as Pearl Slaghoople, Wilma&#x27;s mother. The B-52&#x27;s performed their version of the cartoon&#x27;s theme song, playing cavemen versions of themselves as the BC-52&#x27;s.

The film, shot in California, was theatrically released on May 27, 1994. It received generally negative reviews from critics but was a box office success grossing almost $342 million worldwide against a $46 million budget. A tie-in promotion with McDonald&#x27;s was made to promote the film.

A prequel titled &quot;The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas&quot; was released in 2000.

== Plot ==

In Stone Age suburban Bedrock, Slate &amp; Co.&#x27;s new vice-president Cliff Vandercave and his glamorous secretary Sharon Stone discuss their plan to swindle the company of its vast fortune, pin the theft on an employee, and flee. Fred Flintstone loans his best friend and neighbor Barney Rubble money so that he and his wife Betty can adopt a little boy named Bamm-Bamm, who can only pronounce his own name. Though initially hard to control because of his super strength, Bamm-Bamm eventually warms up to his new family and befriends Fred&#x27;s daughter Pebbles. Despite his mother-in-law Pearl Slaghoople&#x27;s doubts, Fred&#x27;s wife Wilma remains supportive of his decision to loan the Rubbles money.

Cliff holds an aptitude test, with the worker with the highest mark becoming the company&#x27;s new vice executive president. Barney, who is doing well on the test, notices Fred is struggling miserably. In an act to return the kindness Fred has previously given him, Barney intentionally swaps his test sheet under Fred&#x27;s file. Fred receives the promotion, complete with executive perks such as a luxurious office and Stone appointed as his secretary. To test Fred&#x27;s willingness to follow orders, Cliff asks him to dismiss Barney who, with Fred&#x27;s test paper, has the lowest score in the company. Though Fred is unwilling to fire him, he reluctantly accepts, but continues to help Barney support his family, even inviting the Rubbles to live with them so that they can rent out their house. However, Fred&#x27;s job and newfound wealth eventually hinder his relationships with Wilma and the Rubbles. Cliff eventually tricks Fred into dismissing the other workers, over the objections of his office Dictabird. Later, Barney confronts Fred after seeing worker riots on the news and, after revealing that he switched tests with Fred, moves out with Betty and Bamm-Bamm. Wilma and Pebbles also leave for Pearl&#x27;s house, leaving Fred behind.

Fred goes to the quarry, discovers Cliff&#x27;s plan, and tries getting Mr. Slate to fire Cliff. However, having framed Fred for thievery, Cliff has reported the theft to the police. Fred flees, but a manhunt ensues by both the police and the fired workers. Wilma and Betty see this on the news and break into Slate &amp; Co. to get the Dictabird, the only witness who can clear Fred&#x27;s name, unaware that Cliff saw them from his office window. As a disguised Fred enters the workers&#x27; cave, he is discovered and the workers try hanging him. When Barney shows up as a snow-cone truck driver, the workers also try to hang him as well when he admits his role in the events. Fred and Barney reconcile before Wilma, Betty and the Dictabird save them and Wilma and the Dictabird tell the workers the truth of Cliff&#x27;s manipulations.

When the Flintstones and Rubbles return home, they learn Cliff has kidnapped the children and find a letter proposing to trade them for the Dictabird. Fred and Barney confront Cliff at the quarry, where Cliff has tied Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm to a huge machine. Though they hand him the Dictabird, Cliff activates the machine to stall them. Barney rescues the children while Fred destroys the machine. The Dictabird escapes from Cliff and lures him back to the quarry, where Stone incapacitates him, having had a change of heart after learning of Cliff&#x27;s plan to betray her. The police, Wilma, Betty, and Mr. Slate arrive and Cliff attempts to escape, but he is killed by a substance falling from the machine.

Fred and the Dictabird tell the police of Cliff&#x27;s actions and all charges against Fred are dropped. Impressed with the substance that Fred inadvertently created by destroying the machine, Mr. Slate dubs the substance &quot;concrete&quot; in honor of his daughter Concretia and declares the stone age over. Mr. Slate asks for the workers to be rehired and makes plans to produce the concrete with Fred leading its division. Having experienced the negatives of wealth and status, Fred declines the offer and asks that the workers be given two weeks paid leave as part of their salary among other benefits, preferring to return to his old life.

== Production ==
=== Development and writing ===
In 1985, producers Keith Barish and Joel Silver bought the rights for a live-action feature film version of &quot;The Flintstones&quot; and commissioned Steven E. de Souza to write a script with Richard Donner hired to direct. De Souza&#x27;s script submitted in September 1987 was eventually rejected and in October 1989 a new script by Daniel and Joshua Goldin was submitted. Peter Martin Wortmann and Robert Conte submitted another draft in March 1990 before Mitch Markowitz was hired to write a script. Said to be inspired by &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;, Markowitz commented that &quot;I don&#x27;t even remember it that well, but Fred and Barney leave their town during a terrible depression and go across the country, or whatever that damn prehistoric thing is, looking for jobs. They wind up in trailer parks trying to keep their families together. They exhibit moments of heroism and poignancy.&quot; Markowitz&#x27;s version was apparently too sentimental for director Donner, who disliked it. A further draft was then submitted and revised by Jeffrey Reno and Ron Osbourne in 1991 and 1992. Eventually, the rights were bought by Amblin Entertainment and Steven Spielberg who, after working with Goodman on &quot;Always&quot;, was determined to cast him in the lead as Fred. Brian Levant was hired as director because of his love for the original series.

When Levant was hired, all previous scripts were thrown out. In May 1992, Michael J. Wilson submitted a four-page story that became the basis for the film. This was turned into a script by Jim Jennewein and Tom S. Parker. A meeting of Levant, Bruce Cohen, Jason Hoffs and Kate Barker gave notes to Gary Ross, who produced another draft. Levant then recruited what he called an &quot;all-star writing team&quot; which consisted of his writer friends from television shows such as &quot;Family Ties&quot;, &quot;Night Court&quot;, and &quot;Happy Days&quot;. Levant described as &quot;a sitcom on steroids, just trying to improve it.&quot; The writers, dubbed the Flintstone Eight, were Al Aidekman, Cindy Begel, Lloyd Garver, David Silverman, Stephen Sustarsic, Nancy Steen, Neil Thompson plus Levant. The group wrote a new draft but four more round table sessions ensued, each of which was attended by new talent, including Rob Dames, Lenny Ripps, Fred Fox Jr., Dava Savel, Lon Diamond, David Richardson, Roy Teicher, Richard Gurman, Michael J. Digaetano and Ruth Bennett. Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel worked on it next with Levant, taking home a reported $100,000 for just two days work. Rick Moranis was also present at Levant&#x27;s roundtables, and later described the film as &quot;one of those scripts that had about 18 writers.&quot; Levant made eight more revisions before finally registering a shooting script on August 7, 1993. Of the 35 writers, the Flintstone Eight were submitted for arbitration by the Writers Guild of America plus Wilson for story credit; however, credit was given to the first script by De Souza and to Jennewein and Parker for their drafts.

The effects for Dino, the Dictabird and other prehistoric creatures were provided by Jim Henson&#x27;s Creature Shop while most of the film&#x27;s CGI effects were provided by Industrial Light &amp; Magic after Levant was impressed by their work on the dinosaurs in &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; (another Universal/Amblin production released the previous year).

=== Casting ===
John Candy, Jim Belushi, Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray, and Chevy Chase were all considered for the role of Fred Flintstone. The last four actors were all deemed too skinny and a fat suit was deemed too inappropriate to be used. Goodman felt he was &quot;sandbagged&quot; into the role of Fred years earlier at the table read for the film &quot;Always&quot;, when Steven Spielberg announced: &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen, I&#x27;d like to say something before we start: I&#x27;ve found my Fred Flintstone&quot;. Goodman said it was &quot;not a role I was looking forward to doing&quot; but said the experience was &quot;fun&quot;. Had Goodman turned the role down, the film would not have been made. Geena Davis, Faith Ford, and Catherine O&#x27;Hara were all considered for the role of Wilma, but Elizabeth Perkins eventually won the role. Danny DeVito was the original first choice for Barney, but he turned down the role as he felt he was too gruff to do the character properly and reportedly suggested Rick Moranis for the role. DeVito was also considered for Fred. Although Janine Turner was considered, Rosie O&#x27;Donnell won the role of Betty Rubble with her impersonation of the cartoon character&#x27;s signature giggle. Both Tracey Ullman and Daphne Zuniga were also considered for the role. Sharon Stone was to play Miss Stone, but turned it down because of scheduling conflicts. The role was also offered to Nicole Kidman. Both Audrey Meadows and Elizabeth Montgomery were considered for the role of Pearl Slaghoople.

=== Filming ===
Principal photography began on May 17, 1993, and wrapped three months later, on August 20. Parts of the film were shot at Glen Canyon in Utah as well as Los Angeles County, California. Sets that resembled a complete street from Bedrock were constructed adjacent to Vasquez Rocks in California. Before they were totally demolished, visitors could tour the location.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
&quot;The Flintstones&quot; was a box office success, grossing $130.5 million in the U.S. and Canada, including the $37.2 million it made during its 4-day Memorial Day opening weekend in 1994 (a then-record gross for the Memorial Day weekend, surpassing &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot;). It performed well internationally, making another $211.1 million, for a total of $341.6 million worldwide, more than seven times its $46 million budget. Along with &quot;Lethal Weapon 3&quot;, the film also had the biggest May opening weekend until it was overtaken by &quot;Twister&quot; in 1996. In the same year, &quot;&quot; surpassed &quot;The Flintstones&quot; to have the highest Memorial Day opening weekend gross. The film topped the box office for two weeks until it was dethroned by &quot;Speed&quot;. In the United Kingdom, it had the second highest opening week at the time behind &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, with a gross of $8.7 million. In Mexico, it had a record opening with $4.9 million in four days. In Australia, it grossed $2 million in its opening weekend, also the second highest at the time behind &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;. In Italy, it grossed $4.8 million in its first six days, again the second biggest opener in Italy at the time behind &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;. It set opening records in Hungary and Poland. It went on to gross over $15 million in Italy, $35 million in Germany and $31 million in the United Kingdom. It did not perform well in France or South Korea.

=== Critical response ===
 Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;B+&quot; on scale of A+ to F.

On &quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert &amp; the Movies&quot;, Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; and his colleague Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film two thumbs down. Ebert gave it 2.5 stars out of 4 in his newspaper review, and Siskel gave it 1.5 stars out of 4 in his newspaper review. They both mentioned that its main storylines (embezzlement, mother-in-law problems, office politics and extra-marital affairs) were storylines for adult films, and ones that children would not be able to understand.

Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that the film never had much potential and &quot;has been carefully designed to be as bright and insubstantial as a child’s toy balloon.&quot; Comparing the film to &quot;The Addams Family&quot;, he called both films &quot;clever, lively and ultimately wearying pieces of showy Hollywood machinery&quot; that favor visuals over writing.

Caryn James of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that Goodman &quot;goes a long way toward carrying &quot;The Flintstones&quot; over a script that is essentially a bunch of rock jokes and puns stretched to feature-film length,&quot; but James also said the film is too faithful to its 1960s source material and lacks modern pop culture references.

Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; said that &quot;with all manner of friendly beasts, a superenergetic John Goodman and a colorful supporting cast inhabiting a Bedrock that resembles a Stone Age version of Steven Spielberg suburbia, this live-action translation of the perennial cartoon favorite is a fine popcorn picture for small fry, and perfectly inoffensive for adults.&quot;

Michael Wilmington of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote that the film resembled &quot;a mountain of production, a rock of a cast, [and] a pebble of thought.&quot;

A few reviews were positive, including one from Richard Schickel of &quot;Time&quot;, who said that &quot;nothing has been lost—or worse, inflated out of proportion&quot; in the adaptation. He said it &quot;doesn&#x27;t feel overcalculated, over-produced or overthought.&quot;

In a 1997 interview, Joseph Barbera, co-founder of Hanna-Barbera Productions and co-creator of &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, stated that, although he was impressed by the film&#x27;s visuals, he felt the story &quot;wasn&#x27;t as good as I could have made it.&quot;

=== Year-end lists ===

=== Accolades ===

O&#x27;Donnell won the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actress for her performance in this film. The film also won Worst Screenplay and was nominated for two others: Taylor as Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actress (the second performance in the film nominated for this award) and for the film as Worst Remake or Sequel. At the 1994 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, the film was nominated for Worst Resurrection of a TV Show and Worst Actress for O&#x27;Donnell. The film also received four Saturn Award nominations, including Best Fantasy Film, Best Costume Design and Best Supporting Actress for O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s and Berry&#x27;s performances.

=== Marketing ===
McDonald&#x27;s marketed a number of Flintstones promotions for the film, including the return of the McRib sandwich and the &quot;Grand Poobah Meal&quot; combo with it, a line of premium glass mugs, and toys based on characters and locations from the film. In the commercials and released items for the Flintstones promotion, McDonald&#x27;s was renamed &quot;RocDonald&#x27;s&quot; with stone age imagery, similarly to other businesses and proper names in the Flintstones franchise. The week the film was released, MTV aired a block of &quot;The Grind&quot; with Eric Nies at the film&#x27;s Bedrock set with dancers in cave outfits performing to hit music at the time from Ace of Base, Was (Not Was), Warren G and Nate Dogg while Eric asked the dancers themed trivia questions from the show and encouraged the viewers to purchase the film&#x27;s soundtrack. &quot;The Flintstones: The Movie&quot;, a video game based on the film, was developed by Ocean software and released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Game Boy and Mega Drive/Genesis (Sega Channel exclusive) in 1995. In the United Kingdom, Tetley promoted TV commercials with audio from the film, including mugs starring characters from the film. &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, the name of another movie, was also seen briefly as a park in the film.

== Home media ==
The film was released on VHS and LaserDisc on November 8, 1994, and on DVD on March 16, 1999. It was released on Blu-ray on August 19, 2014.

== Video game ==

A video game based on the film was released for the Game Boy, Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Channel in both 1994 and 1995 respectively, developed by Ocean Software (SNES), Twilight (GB), Hi-Tech (SC) and published by Ocean Software. In the game, the player takes control of Fred Flintstone and has to rescue Wilma, Barney, Pebbles and Bam-Bam from Cliff Vandercave.

A Sega Genesis version developed by Foley Hi-Tech and published by Ocean Software was also planned, but was later canceled and was released on the Sega Channel instead.

== Prequel ==

A prequel, &quot;The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas&quot;, was released in 2000. The original main cast did not reprise their roles of the characters, though O&#x27;Donnell provided the voice of an octopus who gave massages to younger versions of Wilma and Betty. Irwin Keyes returned as Joe Rockhead, the only cast member to reprise his role from the first film. It received negative reviews and was a box office failure.

<doc id="194666" wikidata="Q6407672" url="?curid=194666" title="Killin' Time (Clint Black album)">
<text>Killin&#x27; Time is the debut studio album by American country music singer-songwriter Clint Black. It was released on May 2, 1989, by RCA Nashville. The album, buoyed by the chart-topping success of its first four singles, was a huge hit upon its release, and established Black as one of the biggest new stars in country music. The album is currently certified triple platinum by the RIAA.

&quot;A Better Man&quot;, &quot;Nothing&#x27;s News&quot;, &quot;Walking Away&quot;, &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Home&quot;, and &quot;Killin&#x27; Time&quot; were all huge hit songs. All of these except &quot;Nothing&#x27;s News&quot; reached Number One on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles and Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) chart, while &quot;Nothing&#x27;s News&quot; reached No. 3. In addition, &quot;A Better Man&quot; and &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Home&quot; were declared the Number One songs of 1989 and 1990, respectively, according to &quot;Billboard&quot;.

==Critical reception==
The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that &quot;Black has a winning vocal style that evokes a very young Merle Haggard at times, and musically he can Western swing just as hard as fellow Texan George Strait, which he proves on the delightful &#x27;Straight From the Factory&#x27;.&quot;

==Musical style and composition==

&quot;Killin&#x27; Time&quot; has been described musically as neotraditional country, Texas country, Western swing. It has been compared to the musical style of classic country music artists such as Merle Haggard and as neotraditional country contemporaries such as George Strait and Randy Travis.

<text>Red Headed Stranger is the eighteenth studio album by American outlaw country singer Willie Nelson, released in 1975. Following the success of his recordings with Atlantic Records, coupled with the negotiating skills of his manager, Neil Reshen, Nelson signed a contract with Columbia Records, the label that gave him total creative control over his works. The concept for the album was inspired by the &quot;Tale of the Red Headed Stranger&quot;, a song that Nelson used to play as a disc jockey on his program in Fort Worth, Texas. After signing with Columbia, he decided to record the song, and arranged the details during his return to Austin, Texas, from a trip to Colorado. It was recorded at low cost at Autumn Sound Studios in Garland, Texas. The songs featured sparse arrangements, largely limited to Nelson&#x27;s guitar, piano, and drums. Nelson presented the finished material to Columbia executives, who were dubious about releasing an album that they at first thought was a demo. However, Nelson had creative control, so no further production was added.

A concept album, &quot;Red Headed Stranger&quot; is about a fugitive on the run from the law after killing his wife and her lover. The content consists of songs with brief poetic lyrics and arrangements of older material such as Fred Rose&#x27;s &quot;Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain&quot;, Wolfe Gilbert&#x27;s &quot;Down Yonder&quot;, and Juventino Rosas&#x27; &quot;O&#x27;er the Waves&quot;. Despite Columbia&#x27;s doubts and the limited instrumentation, &quot;Red Headed Stranger&quot; was a blockbuster among country music and mainstream audiences. It was certified multiple-platinum, and made Nelson one of the most recognized artists in country music. The cover of &quot;Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain&quot;, released as a single before the album, became Nelson&#x27;s first number-one hit. The title of the album became a lasting nickname for Nelson. It was ranked number 183 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and number one on CMT&#x27;s &quot;40 Greatest Albums in Country Music&quot;. In 2010, it was inducted to the National Recording Registry.

In 1986, Nelson starred as the Red Headed Stranger in a movie of the same name, based on the story of the album. The album has had a strong cultural impact; the song &quot;Time of the Preacher&quot; was used often in the British television miniseries &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot;, and its lyrics were used in the first issue of the comic &quot;Preacher&quot;.

==Background==
Nelson first achieved fame as a songwriter in Nashville after writing hits such as &quot;Hello Walls&quot;, &quot;Night Life&quot;, &quot;Funny How Time Slips Away&quot;, &quot;Pretty Paper&quot;, and &quot;Crazy&quot;. After recording two albums for Liberty, he moved to RCA and recorded over a dozen albums, many produced by Chet Atkins, but his recordings were given the Nashville Sound treatment, orchestration that Nelson felt was largely unnecessary. In 1973, he signed to Atlantic Records by Jerry Wexler, who accepted Nelson&#x27;s desire to use his own band in the studio and eschew commercial concerns, for US$25,000 per year, he became the first country artist signed by the label. His first album with Atlantic was the critically acclaimed &quot;Shotgun Willie&quot;, which was followed by one of the first concept albums in country music, &quot;Phases and Stages&quot;. Following the success of these recordings, Nelson signed with Columbia Records, and was given complete creative control.

During his return to Austin, Texas, after a ski trip in Colorado, Nelson was inspired by his then-wife Connie Koepke to write a western concept album. Koepke suggested the inclusion of Arthur &quot;Guitar Boogie&quot; Smith&#x27;s &quot;Tale of the Red Headed Stranger&quot;, which Nelson sang during his radio shows on KCNC in Fort Worth, Texas, and previously, to his children at bedtime. Nelson decided to write a complete story that included details of events before the ones described in the song. As he spontaneously composed the songs, Koepke recorded the lyrics. With his original writings, Nelson included in the story, Fred Rose&#x27;s &quot;Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain&quot;, Wolfe Gilbert&#x27;s &quot;Down Yonder&quot;, Juventino Rosas&#x27; &quot;&quot;Sobre las Olas&quot; (O&#x27;er the Waves)&quot;, Hank Cochran&#x27;s &quot;Can I Sleep in Your Arms?&quot;, Eddy Arnold&#x27;s &quot;I Couldn&#x27;t Believe It Was True&quot;, and Billy Callery&#x27;s &quot;Hands on the Wheel&quot;. When he arrived in Austin, Nelson recorded a demo of the songs on a tape recorder accompanied with his guitar at his ranch on Fitzhugh Road.

==Recording and composition==
Nelson started to look for a studio in Texas to record his new material to avoid the modifications that they did to his recordings in his previous sessions. Engineer Phil York, who was hired freelance by the recently opened Autumn Sound Studios in Garland, Texas, heard about his need. York, an acquaintance of Nelson&#x27;s harmonicist Mickey Raphael, offered Nelson a day of free recording to boost the popularity of the studio. Autumn&#x27;s studio, a quiet room with cypress wood paneling, featured the first 24-track studio console in Texas, and came equipped with a Bosendorfer concert grand piano, a 92-key instrument made in Vienna with four extra bass notes that retailed for $25,000. Nelson and his band went to the trial session during January, and recorded five songs. Later, Raphael called back York, announcing that Nelson would record the entire album there. After hearing the tapes by Nelson, the band started to improvise to the song &quot;Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain&quot;. Disliking the result, Nelson decided to strip down the instrumentation. Nelson also instructed York to undo the equalization he performed on the tracks, remarking that it was the method his producers used in Nashville. The recording took five days, with an additional day for the mixing, that summed up to US$4,000 in studio costs. The additional costs took the total to US$20,000. Nelson featured arrangements of acoustic guitar, accompanied by piano, played by his sister Bobbie, as well complementary arrangements of drums, harmonica, and mandolin.
The title track of the album was written by Edith Lindeman Calisch and Carl Stutz, and made popular by Arthur &quot;Guitar Boogie&quot; Smith. It had previously had been recorded by John D. Loudermilk and Eddy Arnold. While the album initially was inspired by &quot;The Tale of the Red Headed Stranger&quot;, Nelson later insisted the story came together quickly after he penned the opening track &quot;Time of the Preacher&quot;: &quot;I took my time, all the while staying focused on the preacher&#x27;s feelings ... Hank Cochran&#x27;s &#x27;Can I Sleep in Your Arms&#x27; was the kind of tune the preacher would use to sing himself to sleep. I could also hear the preacher doing a beautiful old ballad by Fred Rose, &#x27;Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain&#x27;, that had been sung by everyone from Hank Williams to Gene Autry to Conway Twitty. It was another song about lost love whose mantra – &#x27;Love is like a dying ember and only memories remain&#x27; – expressed the overall theme and tied all the loose ends together&quot;. Author Michael Streissguth considered it Nelson&#x27;s &quot;first true concept album&quot;, composed of new songs and old, arranged in a sequence that formed a story. In Chet Flippo&#x27;s essay for the 2000 reissue of the album, Nelson commented &quot;I wanted it to be real sparse. I had in mind, I remember, some of my favorite records: Eddy Arnold with just his guitar; Ernest Tubb with just his guitar; so I wanted to have that kind of feel with maybe just some help along the way to keep it from getting too, you know, obnoxious. Or monotonous.&quot;

The story begins with &quot;Time of the Preacher&quot;, where the character evokes his love for his wife, whom he suspects is unfaithful. In the following song, &quot;I Couldn&#x27;t Believe It Was True&quot;, the infidelity is revealed. This leads to a short version of &quot;Time of the Preacher&quot;, wherein the singer ends with the line &quot;Now the lesson is over, and the killing&#x27;s begun&quot;. The reaction of the husband is depicted by Nelson in a medley of &quot;Blue Rock, Montana&quot; and &quot;Red Headed Stranger&quot;. The first song describes the double murder of the unfaithful woman and her lover by the Stranger, who states, &quot;And they died with a smile on their faces&quot;. This leads to the second song of the medley, which describes the grief of the Stranger. This section is followed by Nelson&#x27;s cover of the 1947 Fred Rose song &quot;Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain&quot;, where the fugitive laments the loss of his wife. In &quot;Red Headed Stranger&quot;, the protagonist commits a subsequent murder—he kills a woman who merely reaches out to touch one of his horses. The horse &quot;means more to him than life&quot; because it had belonged to his wife, but the Stranger goes free because it was determined that &quot;you can&#x27;t hang a man for killin&#x27; a woman who&#x27;s tryin&#x27; to steal your horse&quot;.

The story continues with the Stranger traveling south. In the song &quot;Denver&quot;, the character falls in love with a woman he meets in a bar in town. One of the lines from &quot;Blue Rock, Montana&quot; is repeated, with a variation: &quot;And they danced with a smile on their faces&quot;. The following song &quot;Can I Sleep in Your Arms?&quot; shows the Stranger&#x27;s desire for redemption and love. Next is &quot;Remember Me&quot;, where he announces that his vows to his deceased wife are broken and he is free to love. The story ends with &quot;Hands on the Wheel&quot;, which depicts the Stranger as an old man who is accompanied by a child, presumably his grandson, and his new love. The song marks the end of the sorrow of the Stranger, and his redemption years later. The album ends with the instrumental song &quot;Bandera&quot;.

==Release and reception==
Initially, Columbia Records was not satisfied with the finished product; the sparsely instrumented acoustic arrangements caused the label&#x27;s directors to doubt releasing the album as presented, feeling it was under-produced and no more than a demo. Nelson later remembered that &quot;when the chief Columbia bigwig heard the tracks, he said, &#x27;Why are you turning in a demo?&#x27; &#x27;Ain&#x27;t no demo&#x27;, I explained. &#x27;This is the finished product.&#x27;&quot; When Nelson asked the Columbia executive what a finished record was supposed to sound like, the executive replied &quot;Anything but this. The songs feel disconnected. The mood is too down. And the sound is far too flat. You need to go back in and polish it.&quot; Nelson&#x27;s manager Neil Reshen and Waylon Jennings then traveled to New York City to play the album for Columbia president Bruce Lundvall. Lundvall had suggested that the album be sent to Nashville producer Billy Sherrill for further overdubbing. An infuriated Jennings called Lundvall a &quot;tone-deaf, tin-eared sonofabitch&quot;. When he first heard it, Sherrill asked, &quot;Did he make this in his living room? It&#x27;s a piece of shit! It sounds like he did this for about two bucks. It&#x27;s not produced.&quot; However, Nelson had complete creative control, and it was released without any further modifications. Reflecting on the album&#x27;s success, Columbia executive Rick Blackburn later commented &quot;&quot;Red Headed Stranger&quot; was a hit for all the wrong reasons. It didn&#x27;t follow the formula, the fashionable mix of the day. There were 1,000 reasons that record should not be a hit. But the &quot;Red Headed Stranger&quot; project took on Willie&#x27;s personality and became a hit for the right reasons – because it was Willie Nelson. It was Willie&#x27;s statement.&quot;

&quot;Red Headed Stranger&quot; reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart for Top Country Albums, and number 28 during a 43-week stay in the Top LPs &amp; Tapes chart. On March 11, 1976, it was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America, and on November 21, 1986, it was certified double-platinum.

===Original reviews===

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writer Paul Nelson considered &quot;&quot;Red Headed Stranger&quot; &quot;extraordinarily ambitious, cool, tightly controlled&quot;. The reviewer remarked that the album &quot;ties precise, evocative lyrics&quot;, and called the result &quot;haunting yet utterly unsentimental&quot;.&quot; Meanwhile, critic Robert Christgau wrote, &quot;Some of the individual pieces are quite nice, but the gestalt is the concept album at its most counterproductive—the lyrics render the nostalgic instrumental parts unnecessarily ironic and lose additional charm in narrative context.&quot;

Music critic Chet Flippo wrote an article in &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; that was titled &quot;Mathew, Mark, Luke and Willie: Willie Nelson&#x27;s latest album is more than a good country music; it&#x27;s almost Gospel&quot;: &quot;The difference between Nelson&#x27;s &quot;Red Headed Stranger&quot; and any current C&amp;W album, and especially what passes for a soundtrack for Nashville, is astounding. What Nelson has done is simply unclassifiable; it is the only record I have heard that strikes me as otherworldly. &quot;Red Headed Stranger&quot; conjures up such strange emotions and works on so many levels that listening to it becomes totally obsessing&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; described the album as &quot;lots of instrumental work, with particularly fine piano by Bobbie Nelson, and the usual highly stylized Willie Nelson vocals&quot;. In &quot;Mother Jones&quot; Joe Nick Patoski wrote: &quot;Texans have known for 15 years what &quot;Red Headed Stranger&quot; finally revealed to the world – that Nelson is simply too brilliant a songwriter, interpreter, and singer – just too damn universal – to be defined as merely a country artist&quot;.

The &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot; noted the use of Nelson&#x27;s usual backing band instead of session musicians. The review praised Mickey Raphael&#x27;s playing on &quot;Hands on the Wheel&quot; and Bobbie Nelson&#x27;s on &quot;Bandera&quot;, while it also remarked that the style of the album reflected &quot;the Nelson of several years ago&quot; with its &quot;aura of quiet intensity&quot;. John Edminston, from &quot;The Paris News&quot;, declared: &quot;&quot;Red Headed Stranger&quot;, if nothing else, will bring Willie to the forefront as one of the nation&#x27;s top country-western recording artists. And that&#x27;s where he belongs&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;Red Headed Stranger&quot;″s critical success cemented Nelson&#x27;s outlaw image, and made him one of the most recognized artists in country music. The title of the album became a nickname for Nelson. The cover of Fred Rose&#x27;s 1945 song &quot;Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain&quot;, that had been released as a single previous to the album, became his first number one hit as a singer.
Nelson met publisher and screenwriter William D. Wittliff in 1977 at a Mexican restaurant in Austin through writer Bud Shrake. Because of the success of the album, Wittliff decided to write a script for Nelson based on the story of the Red Headed Stranger. In 1979, Wittliff finished a draft of the project, which was turned over to Universal Studios. The studio budgeted the film at $14 million and sent the script to Robert Redford, who turned it down. The movie project was tabled, and Wittliff and Nelson had to buy the script back from Universal. The script then went to HBO, who assigned the project a budget of $5 million, but this project was not completed either. Finally, Nelson and Wittliff decided to finance the film themselves. In &quot;Red Headed Stranger&quot;, Nelson portrayed the role of the stranger, and the movie was released in 1986.

In 2002, the 1975 original recording of the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

In 2000, &quot;Red Headed Stranger&quot; was reissued on CD. The new released included the bonus tracks &quot;Bach Minuet In G&quot;, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Help It (If I&#x27;m Still In Love With You)&quot;, &quot;A Maiden&#x27;s Prayer&quot; and &quot;Bonaparte&#x27;s Retreat&quot;. In 2003, the album was ranked at number 184 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list, before dropping to number 237 in a 2020 revised list. In 2006, it was ranked number one in Country Music Television&#x27;s 40 Greatest Albums in Country Music. In 2009, &quot;Red Headed Stranger&quot; was added to the National Recording Registry as it was considered that it was &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically important, and/or informs or reflects life in the United States&quot;. In 2020, Legacy Recordings reissued &quot;Red Headed Stranger&quot; on its original LP format.

===Posterior reviews===
In 1996, Nell Zink wrote in &quot;CMJ New Music Monthly&quot;: &quot;His &quot;Red Headed Stranger&quot; was the &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s&quot; of country music, the first record to follow a coherent theme instead of merely compiling radio singles&quot;. Stephen Thomas Erlewine in AllMusic described &quot;Red Headed Stranger&quot; as &quot;really elusive, as the themes get a little muddled and the tunes themselves are a bit bare. It&#x27;s undoubtedly distinctive – and it sounds more distinctive with each passing year – but it&#x27;s strictly an intellectual triumph and, after a pair of albums that were musically and intellectually sound, it&#x27;s a bit of a letdown, no matter how successful it was&quot;. In 2003, it was included among the top 1,000 albums of &quot;Zagat Survey&quot; magazine, and was rated five stars out of five. The magazine wrote &quot;Supporters (of the album) spread the gospel that it&#x27;s just a quintessential outlaw recording, but perhaps the greatest country album ever with a spare style that changed the way C&amp;W was played&quot;.

&quot;Sputnikmusic&quot; wrote: &quot;The &quot;Red Headed Stranger&quot; is simple and bare. Following the story of a preacher man that kills his cheating wife and her lover, ol&#x27; Willie spins the tale with a laid back nonchalance that just seems to ooze out of him, his aching chords and somber melodies encapsulating the futility and pain of his character&#x27;s situation [...] The &quot;Red Headed Stranger&quot; is timeless. Willie Nelson&#x27;s captivating story telling, and the minimalist majesty of his music fills a well worn grove in the hearts of those that enjoy the folk roots of the United States.&quot; Writing for &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, Rebecca Bengal deemed it &quot;a big and beautiful dream made real by simple and spare music&quot;, noting Nelson&#x27;s &quot;uncanny ability to bend the listener’s perception of time&quot;. The &quot;Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot; defined it as a &quot;country classic&quot; 

===In popular culture===
The first track, &quot;Time of the Preacher&quot;, was used in Bob Dylan&#x27;s 1978 film &quot;Renaldo and Clara&quot; and episodes of the 1985 television drama &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot;. The lyrics to &quot;Time of the Preacher&quot; were used in the opening pages of the first issue of the Vertigo comic book &quot;Preacher&quot;, with the song being used in the opening of the premiere of the TV series based on the comic. A 2002 episode of the TV series &quot;Monk&quot;, &quot;Mr. Monk and the Red-Headed Stranger&quot;, guest-stars Willie Nelson. In the episode, Nelson is accused of murder. The complete album was performed and recorded by Carla Bozulich in 2003. &quot;The Red Headed Stranger&quot; included a guest appearance by Nelson.

<doc id="194671" wikidata="Q928132" url="?curid=194671" title="Saturday Night Fever (soundtrack)">
<text>Saturday Night Fever is the soundtrack double album (in 2 Long Play records) from the 1977 film &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; starring John Travolta. The soundtrack was released on November 15, 1977 by RSO Records. Prior to the release of &quot;Thriller&quot; by Michael Jackson, &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; was the best-selling album in music history, and still ranks among the best-selling soundtrack albums worldwide, with sales figures of over 40 million copies.

In the United States, the album was certified 16× Platinum for shipments of at least 16 million units. The album stayed atop the charts for 24 straight weeks from January to July 1978 and stayed on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s album charts for 120 weeks until March 1980. Three singles from the album contributed by the Bee Gees—&quot;How Deep Is Your Love&quot;, &quot;Stayin&#x27; Alive&quot; and &quot;Night Fever&quot;—along with Yvonne Elliman&#x27;s &quot;If I Can&#x27;t Have You&quot;, all reached No. 1 in the US. In the UK, the album spent 18 consecutive weeks at No. 1. The album epitomized the disco phenomenon on both sides of the Atlantic and was an international sensation. The album was added to the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress in 2012 for being &quot;culturally, historically, and/or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Writing and recording==
According to the DVD commentary for &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;, the producers intended to use the song &quot;Lowdown&quot; by Boz Scaggs in the rehearsal scene between Tony and Stephanie in the dance studio, and choreographed their dance moves to the song. However, representatives for Scaggs&#x27;s label, Columbia Records, refused to grant legal clearance for it, as they wanted to pursue another disco movie project, which never materialized. Composer David Shire, who scored the film, had to, in turn, write a song to match the dance steps demonstrated in the scene and eliminate the need for future legal hassles. However, this track does not appear on the movie&#x27;s soundtrack.

The Bee Gees&#x27; involvement in the film did not begin until post-production. As John Travolta asserted, &quot;The Bee Gees weren&#x27;t even involved in the movie in the beginning ... I was dancing to Stevie Wonder and Boz Scaggs.&quot;

Producer Robert Stigwood commissioned the Bee Gees to create the songs for the film. Robin Gibb recalled:
The brothers wrote the songs &quot;virtually in a single weekend&quot; at Château d&#x27;Hérouville studio in France. The first song they recorded was &quot;If I Can&#x27;t Have You&quot;, but their version was not used in the film.

Barry Gibb remembered the reaction when Stigwood and music supervisor Bill Oakes arrived and listened to the demos:
Maurice Gibb recalled, &quot;We played him demo tracks of &#x27;If I Can&#x27;t Have You&#x27;, &#x27;Night Fever&#x27; and &#x27;More Than a Woman&#x27;. He asked if we could write it more discoey.&quot;

The Brothers Gibb then wrote a song called &quot;Saturday Night&quot; but as Maurice explains, 
The track was recorded at Criteria Studios, with Maurice Gibb playing a bass line similar to the guitar riff, Barry Gibb and Alan Kendall on guitar riffs, and Blue Weaver on synthesizers. Barry chose to sing falsetto on the whole song, except on the line &quot;life’s going nowhere, somebody help me&quot;. 

Dennis Bryon, who was a backing drummer, left in the middle of the session due to the death of his mother, so the group looked for a replacement. However, as there was a shortage of qualified drummers in the area, they tried out a drum machine, with unsatisfactory results. After listening to the drum track of the already-recorded &quot;Night Fever&quot;, they took two bars from that track, and re-recorded them as a loop.

==Commercial performance==
At the time, &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; with &quot;Grease&quot; held the record for biggest preorders in Netherlands with 150,000 records sold.

==Release==
The original issue of the album included the original studio version of &quot;Jive Talkin; later LP pressings included a version culled from &quot;Here at Last ... Bee Gees ... Live&quot;. All CD releases have included the original &quot;Jive Talkin. &quot;Jive Talkin was to have been used in a deleted scene taking place the day after Tony Manero&#x27;s first Saturday night at the disco, but as the sequence was cut for the final film, the song was cut as well. In addition to the Bee Gees songs, additional incidental music was composed and adapted by David Shire. Three of Shire&#x27;s cues – &quot;Manhattan Skyline&quot;, &quot;Night on Disco Mountain&quot; (based on the classical piece &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot;) and &quot;Salsation&quot; – are included on the soundtrack album as well. Five additional cues – &quot;Tony and Stephanie&quot;, &quot;Near the Verrazano Bridge&quot; (both adapted from the Bee Gees&#x27; song &quot;How Deep Is Your Love&quot;), &quot;Barracuda Hangout&quot;, &quot;Death on the Bridge&quot; and &quot;All Night Train&quot; – while heard in the film, remain unreleased on CD. In 1995, the soundtrack was re-released on CD through Polydor Records. In 2006, the album was re-released on Reprise Records as part of the Bee Gees&#x27; regaining control of their master tapes.

To commemorate the movie&#x27;s 40th anniversary, Capitol Records released a newly remastered version (However, CD 1 is the same remaster used for the 1995 Polydor release.) on April 21, 2017, with the original artwork and gatefold packaging.

On November 17, 2017, a deluxe box set was released with the original soundtrack, 4 new mixes of &quot;Stayin&#x27; Alive&quot;, &quot;Night Fever&quot;, &quot;How Deep Is Your Love&quot; and &quot;You Should Be Dancing&quot;, a collector&#x27;s book, art prints, a movie poster and a turntable mat.

==Reception and legacy==

Along with the success of the movie, the soundtrack, composed and performed primarily by the Bee Gees, is the second best-selling soundtrack album of all time after the soundtrack to &quot;The Bodyguard&quot;. &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; had a large cultural impact in the United States. The Bee Gees had originally written and recorded five of the songs used in the film – &quot;Stayin&#x27; Alive&quot;, &quot;Night Fever&quot;, &quot;How Deep Is Your Love&quot;, &quot;More Than a Woman&quot; (performed in the film in two different versions – one version by Tavares, and another by the Bee Gees) and &quot;If I Can&#x27;t Have You&quot; (performed in the movie by Yvonne Elliman) as part of a regular album. They had no idea at the time they would be making a soundtrack and said that they basically lost an album in the process. Two previously released Bee Gees songs – &quot;Jive Talkin and &quot;You Should Be Dancing&quot; – are also included on the soundtrack. Other previously released songs from the disco era round out the music in the movie. Rick Dees&#x27; single &#x27;Disco Duck&#x27;, and another song by Dees, &#x27;Dr. Disco&#x27;, both appear in the film, but are not included on the soundtrack album. 

The soundtrack won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. It is the only disco album to do so, and one of only three soundtrack albums so honored. In 2012, the album was ranked No. 132 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, ranked again in a 2020 revised list at number 163. The soundtrack hit the No. 1 spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart&#x27;s Pop Album and Soul Album charts. In 2003 the TV network VH1 named it the 57th greatest album of all time, and it was ranked 80th in a 2005 survey held by British television&#x27;s Channel 4 to determine the 100 greatest albums of all time. Pitchfork Media listed &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; as the 34th best album of the 1970s.

The album was added to the National Recording Registry in the Library of Congress on March 21, 2013 for preservation.

<text>Baker yeast is the common name for the strains of yeast commonly used in baking bread and other bakery products, serving as a leavening agent which causes the bread to rise (expand and become lighter and softer) by converting the fermentable sugars present in the dough into carbon dioxide and ethanol. Baker&#x27;s yeast is of the species &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;, and is the same species (but a different strain) as the kind commonly used in alcoholic fermentation, which is called brewer&#x27;s yeast or the deactivated form nutritional yeast. Baker&#x27;s yeast is also a single-cell microorganism found on and around the human body.

The use of steamed or boiled potatoes, water from potato boiling, or sugar in a bread dough provides food for the growth of yeasts; however, too much sugar will dehydrate them. Yeast growth is inhibited by both salt and sugar, but more so by salt than sugar. Some sources say fats, such as butter and eggs, slow down yeast growth; others say the effect of fat on dough remains unclear, presenting evidence that small amounts of fat are beneficial for baked bread volume.

&quot;Saccharomyces exiguus&quot; (also known as &quot;S. minor&quot;) is a wild yeast found on plants, grains, and fruits that is occasionally used for baking; however, in general, it is not used in a pure form but comes from being propagated in a sourdough starter.

==History==
It is not known when yeast was first used to bake bread; the earliest definite records come from Ancient Egypt. Researchers speculate that a mixture of flour meal and water was left longer than usual on a warm day and the yeasts that occur in natural contaminants of the flour caused it to ferment before baking. The resulting bread would have been lighter and tastier than the previous hard flatbreads. It is generally assumed that the earliest forms of leavening were likely very similar to modern sourdough; the leavening action of yeast would have been discovered from its action on flatbread doughs and would have been either cultivated separately or transferred from batch to batch by means of previously mixed (&quot;old&quot;) dough. Also, the development of leavened bread seems to have developed in close proximity to the development of beer brewing, and barm from the beer fermentation process can also be used in bread making.

Without an understanding of microbiology, early bakers would have had little ability to directly control yeast cultures but still kept locally interesting cultures by reusing doughs and starters to leaven later batches. However, it became possible to isolate and propagate favored yeast strains in the same manner as was done in the beer industry, and it eventually became practical to propagate yeast in a slurry with a composition similar to beer wort, usually including malted barley and wheat flour. Such cultures (sometimes referred to in old American cookery as &quot;emptins&quot;, from their origins as the dregs of beer or cider fermentation) became the ancestors of modern baker&#x27;s yeast, as, in general, they were carefully maintained to avoid what was later discovered to be bacterial contamination, including using preservatives such as hops as well as boiling the growth medium.

In the 19th century, bread bakers obtained their yeast from beer brewers, and this led to sweet-fermented breads such as the Imperial &quot;Kaiser-Semmel&quot; roll, which in general lacked the sourness created by the acidification typical of &quot;Lactobacillus&quot;. However, beer brewers slowly switched from top-fermenting to bottom-fermenting yeast (&quot;Saccharomyces pastorianus&quot;) and this created a shortage of yeast for making bread, so the Vienna Process was developed in 1846. While the innovation is often popularly credited for using steam in baking ovens, leading to a different crust characteristic, it is notable for including procedures for high milling of grains (see Vienna grits), cracking them incrementally instead of mashing them with one pass; as well as better processes for growing and harvesting top-fermenting yeasts, known as press-yeast.

Refinements in microbiology following the work of Louis Pasteur led to more advanced methods of culturing pure strains. In 1879, Great Britain introduced specialized growing vats for the production of &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot;, and in the United States around the turn of the century centrifuges were used for concentrating the yeast, making modern commercial yeast possible, and turning yeast production into a major industrial endeavor. The slurry yeast made by small bakers and grocery shops became cream yeast, a suspension of live yeast cells in growth medium, and then compressed yeast, the fresh cake yeast that became the standard leaven for bread bakers in much of the Westernized world during the early 20th century.

During World War II, Fleischmann&#x27;s developed a active dry yeast for the United States armed forces, which did not require refrigeration and had a longer shelf-life and better temperature tolerance than fresh yeast; it is still the standard yeast for US military recipes. The company created yeast that would rise twice as fast, cutting down on baking time. 

In 1973, Lesaffre created instant yeast (also called &quot;quick rise&quot; or &quot;fast acting&quot; yeast), which has gained considerable use and market share at the expense of both fresh and active dry yeast in their various applications. Instant yeast differs from active dry yeast in several ways: Instant yeast rises faster than active dry yeast; instant yeast can be directly added to the dry ingredients, whereas active dry yeast should be mixed with liquid (water, milk or beer) and proofed before mixing; instant yeast has a lower moisture content; and instant yeast is formed of smaller granules.

Modern baker&#x27;s yeast is the species &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;. One of its properties is that it is not inhibited by propionates, which are commonly added to baked goods like bread dough to inhibit mold development and bacterial growth. Conversely, sorbates do inhibit yeast fermentation activity, so are not added directly to yeast-leavened dough but may be sprayed onto finished products or even incorporated into packing materials.

==Types of baker&#x27;s yeast==


Baker&#x27;s yeast is available in a number of different forms, the main differences being the moisture contents. Though each version has certain advantages over the others, the choice of which form to use is largely a question of the requirements of the recipe at hand and the training of the cook preparing it. Dry yeast forms are good choices for longer-term storage, often lasting more than a year at room temperatures without significant loss of viability. In general, with occasional allowances for liquid content and temperature, the different forms of commercial yeast are considered interchangeable.

*Cream yeast is the closest form to the yeast slurries of the 19th century, in essence being a suspension of yeast cells in liquid, siphoned off from the growth medium. Its primary use is in industrial bakeries with special high-volume dispensing and mixing equipment, and it is not readily available to small bakeries or home cooks.
*Compressed yeast is, in essence, cream yeast with most of the liquid removed. It is a soft solid, beige in color, and best known in the consumer form as small, foil-wrapped cubes of cake yeast. It is also available in a larger-block form for bulk usage. It is highly perishable; though formerly widely available for the consumer market, it has become less common in supermarkets in some countries due to its poor keeping properties, having been superseded in some such markets by active dry and instant yeast. It is still widely available for commercial use, and is somewhat more tolerant of low temperatures than other forms of commercial yeast; however, even there, instant yeast has made significant market inroads.
*Active dry yeast is the form of yeast most commonly available to non-commercial bakers in the United States. It consists of coarse oblong granules of yeast, with live yeast cells encapsulated in a thick jacket of dry, dead cells with some growth medium. Under most conditions, active dry yeast must first be proofed or rehydrated. It can be stored at room temperature for a year, or frozen for more than a decade, which means that it has better keeping qualities than other forms, but it is generally considered more sensitive than other forms to thermal shock when actually used in recipes.

*Instant yeast appears similar to active dry yeast, but has smaller granules with substantially higher percentages of live cells per comparable unit volumes. It is more perishable than active dry yeast but also does not require rehydration, and can usually be added directly to all but the driest doughs. In general, instant yeast has a small amount of ascorbic acid added as a preservative. Some producers provide specific variants for doughs with high sugar contents, and such yeasts are more generally known as osmotolerant yeasts.
*Rapid-rise yeast is a variety of dried yeast (usually a form of instant yeast) that is of a smaller granular size, thus it dissolves faster in dough, and it provides greater carbon dioxide output to allow faster rising. There is considerable debate as to the value of such a product; while most baking experts believe it reduces the flavor potential of the finished product, &quot;Cook&#x27;s Illustrated&quot; magazine, among others, feels that, at least for direct-rise recipes, it makes little difference. Rapid-rise yeast is often marketed specifically for use in bread machines.
*Deactivated yeast is dead yeast which has no leavening value and is not interchangeable with other yeast types. Typically used for pizza and pan bread doughs, it is used at a rate of 0.1% of the flour weight, though manufacturer specifications may vary. It is a powerful reducing agent used to increase the extensibility of a dough.

=== Difference between instant and active dry yeast ===
Instant and active dry yeast are essentially the same ingredient, just in slightly different forms and applications. Consumers should keep sealed packets of both yeast types at room temperature and store partially used packets in an airtight container in the refrigerator. The main differences between the two are:

* Active yeast needs rehydration. Instant yeast can be mixed directly into dry ingredients, whereas active dry yeast must first be dissolved and rehydrated in warm water.
* Instant yeast needs less time to rise. Since instant yeast has a finer texture than active dry yeast, it is possible to skip the initial rise time and shape loaves immediately after kneading. Loaves made with active dry yeast require longer rising times for the yeast to work its way through the dough.

== Commercial brands ==
For most commercial uses, yeast of any form is packaged in bulk (blocks or freezer bags for fresh yeast; vacuum-packed brick bags for dry or instant); however, yeast for home use is often packaged in pre-measured doses, either small squares for compressed yeast or sealed packets for dry or instant. For active dry and instant yeast, in general a single dose (reckoned for the average bread recipe of between 500 g and 1000 g of dough) is about 2.5 tsp (~12 mL) or about , though comparatively lesser amounts are used when the yeast is used in a pre-ferment. In general, a yeast flavor in the baked bread is not noticeable when the bakers&#x27; percent of added yeast is less than 2.5%.

Notable commercial brands of baker&#x27;s yeast include Lesaffre&#x27;s SAF red and SAF gold, Fleischmann&#x27;s, and Red Star Yeast.

==Use in research==
===Model organism===
Because it is readily available and easy to culture, baker&#x27;s yeast has long been used in chemical, biological, and genetic research as a model organism. &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; is a facultative anaerobe and undergoes aerobic fermentation in the presences of oxygen and sugars. In 1996, after six years of work, &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; became the first eukaryote to have its entire genome sequenced. It has over 12 million base pairs and around 6000 genes. Since then, it has remained in the forefront of genetic research. For example, most of our knowledge of the cell division cycle was worked out from experiments with yeast.

===Organic synthesis===

Baker&#x27;s yeast contains enzymes that can reduce a carbonyl group into a hydroxyl group in fairly high yield, thus making it useful for biotransformations in organic syntheses. It is known to reduce organometallic carbonyl compounds in very high yield.

====Psychoactive drugs====
* Baker&#x27;s yeast can also be used to produce ethanol via fermentation for use in chemical synthesis, although doing so in some places requires permits.
* A GMO strain of baker&#x27;s yeast, DLAM33B, has been developed to produce the precursor for LSD, lysergic acid.

== Industrial production ==
The baking industry relies on industrial production of its ingredients, including baking yeasts. Much effort has been put into developing and marketing yeasts that will perform reliably in mass production. Since the end of the nineteenth century, baker&#x27;s yeast has been produced by companies that specialize in its production.

The main ingredients for industrial production are yeast cultures, sugar from cane and sugar beet; but a number of minerals, nitrogen and vitamins are also needed.

Fermentation happens in several phases, which vary depending on the manufacturer:
* pure cultures in a laboratory flask for 2 to 4 days, then batch fermentations for 13 to 24 hours (anaerobic);
* intermediate and stock fermentation with gradual feeding and constant aeration;
* pitch and trade fermentation with large air supplies for up to 15 hours;
* filtration, blending, extrusion, and cutting, drying.
The yeast grows from hundreds of kilograms in the intermediate and stock fermentor to tens of thousands of kilograms in the trade fermentor, where most yeast is produced. The earlier stages produce more ethanol and other alcohols, while in the final stages ethanol production is suppressed up to 95% by controlling the amount of oxygen and sugar, in order to increase the yeast production instead.

The industry is highly concentrated, with five companies holding up to 80% of the worldwide market for dry yeast as of 2006. While dry yeast is exported over long distances and mostly sold in the developing countries, industrial customers often prefer to supply fresh yeast from local facilities, with a single wholesaler having up to 90% of the liquid yeast market in the UK in 2006. In the US companies like Lesaffre Group, AB Vista, GB Plange and AB Mauri produced hundreds of thousands of metric tons of yeast in 2012.

<text>Spy Kids is an American media franchise centered on a series of spy action comedy films created by Robert Rodriguez. The plot follows various children, who discover that their respective parents are spies and become involved in an espionage organization when their parents go missing. The films include Hispanic themes, as Rodriguez is of Mexican descent.

== Background ==
=== Influences ===
&quot;Spy Kids&quot; was influenced by elements of the James Bond movies, through the genre of family films. Rodriguez has stated that the first movie was &quot;a fusion of Willy Wonka and James Bond&quot;, while the second was the &quot;&quot;Mysterious Island&quot; and James Bond mix&quot;.

The spy organization in the films is called the OSS. These initials are from the Office of Strategic Services, a former U.S. intelligence organization during World War II which later evolved into the CIA. The character Donnagon Giggles was named after William Joseph Donovan, the director of the original OSS. The initials in the &quot;Spy Kids&quot; universe are never specified on screen, but, in one of the books, they stand for the Organization of Super Spies.

=== Themes ===
One of the main themes of &quot;Spy Kids&quot; is the unity of family. The children have adult responsibilities, and a lesson is that keeping secrets from family members can have a negative effect on relationships. The first film also deals extensively with sibling rivalry and the responsibility of older children. There is also a strong sense of Latino heritage.

=== Technical innovations ===
The other films were shot with High Definition digital video, parts of the third film using an anaglyphic process to create the 3-D effect. Audiences were given red/blue 3D glasses with their tickets in movie theatres. Four sets of these glasses were also included in the DVD release. The third film was used as a test for a special Texas Instruments digital projector which can project polarized 3D, which does not require the red-blue lenses, later reused for &quot;The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D&quot; (2005).

== Films ==
===&quot;Spy Kids&quot; (2001)===

After retiring from espionage for ten years, Gregorio and Ingrid (Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino) are pulled back into duty for their important assignment despite the fact they were out of practice, and were captured. Their two children, Carmen and Juni (Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara), stay with their uncle Felix Gumm (Cheech Marin) and discover the truth of their parents&#x27; past, which they had neglected to tell them because they were afraid that if they knew, they would picture danger at every corner; and decide to rescue them. On their first mission, Carmen and Juni manage to bring around their estranged uncle, Isador &quot;Machete&quot; Cortez (Danny Trejo), a genius gadget inventor and Juni helps to redeem a TV show host named Fegan Floop (Alan Cumming). Together, Carmen and Juni thwart the plan of Floop&#x27;s notorious second in-command Alexander Minion (Tony Shalhoub) to develop an army of androids resembling young children (including Carmen and Juni themselves) for a mastermind named Mr. Lisp (Robert Patrick) and his partner Ms. Gradenko (Teri Hatcher). The robots based on Carmen and Juni became part of Floop&#x27;s show. The film was shot on location in Austin, Texas. 

=== &quot;Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams&quot; (2002) ===

As agents of the OSS, Carmen and Juni try to save the daughter (Taylor Momsen) of the President of the United States (Christopher McDonald) while facing a particularly hard competition with Gary and Gerti Giggles (Matt O&#x27;Leary and Emily Osment), the two children of a double-dealing agent Donnagon Giggles (Mike Judge), whom Carmen and Juni helped to rescue them from the first film. Juni gets fired from the OSS after fighting with Gary over a smaller version of the transmooker, a device that can shut off all electronic devices even though it was Gary who started the fight. Juni loses his spot for the best spy kid of the year award, while Donnagon plans to steal the transmooker to take over the world. On their second mission, Carmen and Juni follow the trail to the mysterious island of Leeke Leeke which is home to Romero (Steve Buscemi), an eccentric scientist who attempted to create genetically miniaturised animals, but instead ended up with his island inhabited by mutant monsters. Eventually, Donnagon is fired and Gary is suspended, and the transmooker is destroyed. Juni is offered his job back, but in order to take a break from the OSS, he retires to start his own private eye agency.

=== &quot;Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over&quot; (2003) ===

After retiring from the OSS, Juni is thrust back into service when an evil mastermind named Sebastian &quot;The Toymaker&quot; (Sylvester Stallone) creates a fictional video game called &quot;Game Over&quot;, which hypnotizes its users. Carmen was sent on a mission to disable the game, but disappeared on Level 4. With the help of his maternal grandfather, Valentin Avellan (Ricardo Montalban), who uses a wheelchair, Juni is sent after Carmen and helps her to disable the game in order to save the world. It is revealed that Sebastian was the one who disabled Valentin in the first place. Instead of avenging his former partner, Valentin forgives Sebastian who is redeemed.

=== &quot;Spy Kids: All the Time in the World&quot; (2011) ===

The OSS has become the world&#x27;s top spy agency, while the Spy Kids department has become defunct. Marissa (Jessica Alba), a retired spy, is thrown back into the action along with her two stepchildren, Rebecca and Cecil (Rowan Blanchard and Mason Cook), when a maniacal Timekeeper (Jeremy Piven) attempts to take over the world. In order to save the world, Rebecca and Cecil must team up with Marissa.

=== &quot;Spy Kids: Armageddon&quot; (2023) ===

The fifth installment titled &quot;Spy Kids: Armageddon&quot;, served as a relaunch of the franchise, involves a plot that centers on a multicultural family. Robert Rodriguez is again writer/director, while the project is a joint-venture production between Skydance Media and Spyglass Media Group. The film is scheduled for distribution on Netflix, making it the second &quot;Spy Kids&quot; project produced for the platform. Gina Rodriguez, Zachary Levi, Everly Carganilla and Connor Esterson were set to star, along with Billy Magnussen and D. J. Cotrona. The plotline for the film: &quot;When the children of the world&#x27;s greatest secret agents unwittingly help a powerful Game Developer unleash a computer virus that gives him control of all technology, they must become spies themselves to save their parents and the world&quot;. Production of the film wrapped in late August 2022, and was released on Netflix on September 22, 2023.

Though the movie does not include other characters from the franchise, Rodriguez confirmed that it takes place in the same continuity as the previous installments.

===Future===
In September 2023, Rodriguez confirmed that Netflix intends to develop additional &quot;Spy Kids&quot; movies, with the filmmaker expressing hope to begin production on a sequel the following year. Rodriguez explained that &quot;Armageddon&quot; incorporated a new family because so much time had passed since &quot;All the Time in the World&quot;, and so he wanted to incorporate a new set of characters before returning to what came before; confirming that he intends to bring back &quot;legacy characters&quot; from the previous installments in future movies.

== Television ==
=== &quot;Spy Kids: Mission Critical&quot; (2018) ===

An animated series based on the films, &quot;Spy Kids: Mission Critical&quot;, was released on Netflix in 2018. The first and second seasons both consist of 10 episodes and is produced by Mainframe Studios. Robert Rodriguez was one of the executive producers on the show.

Isador &quot;Machete&quot; Cortez, who appeared in all four &quot;Spy Kids&quot; film series as a supporting character, additionally had a series of two stand-alone films: &quot;Machete&quot; and &quot;Machete Kills&quot;, also written and directed by Robert Rodriguez. However, the &quot;Machete&quot; films share little in common with the &quot;Spy Kids&quot; films thematically and are not considered direct spin-offs, the first film instead being an adult-oriented action exploitation film, with the second film introducing science fiction elements; both films additionally share several cast members and characters with the &quot;Spy Kids&quot; films. The idea for a &quot;Machete&quot; film came from a fake trailer promoting the &quot;Grindhouse&quot; double-feature by Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino. Trejo and Rodriguez have made two conflicting statements regarding its canonicity to the &quot;Spy Kids&quot; films; Trejo claimed that the films depict &quot;what Uncle Machete does when he&#x27;s not taking care of the kids&quot;, while Rodriguez said in a Reddit AMA that they are alternate universes. Regardless, Rodriguez claimed that he was prompted by an incident on the set of the first &quot;Machete&quot; film to start envisioning a fourth film in the main &quot;Spy Kids&quot; film series, casting Jessica Alba as Machete&#x27;s sister Marissa, a different character to the one she portrayed in &quot;Machete&quot;, with Trejo additionally reprising his role alongside her.

<doc id="194690" wikidata="Q741108" url="?curid=194690" title="Enzyme Commission number">
<text>The Enzyme Commission number (EC number) is a numerical classification scheme for enzymes, based on the chemical reactions they catalyze. As a system of enzyme nomenclature, every EC number is associated with a recommended name for the corresponding enzyme-catalyzed reaction.

EC numbers do not specify enzymes but enzyme-catalyzed reactions. If different enzymes (for instance from different organisms) catalyze the same reaction, then they receive the same EC number. Furthermore, through convergent evolution, completely different protein folds can catalyze an identical reaction (these are sometimes called non-homologous isofunctional enzymes) and therefore would be assigned the same EC number. By contrast, UniProt identifiers uniquely specify a protein by its amino acid sequence.

==Format of number==
Every enzyme code consists of the letters &quot;EC&quot; followed by four numbers separated by periods. Those numbers represent a progressively finer classification of the enzyme. Preliminary EC numbers exist and have an &#x27;n&#x27; as part of the fourth (serial) digit (e.g. EC 3.5.1.n3).

For example, the tripeptide aminopeptidases have the code &quot;EC 3.4.11.4&quot;, whose components indicate the following groups of enzymes:

* &quot;EC 3&quot; enzymes are hydrolases (enzymes that use water to break up some other molecule)
* &quot;EC 3.4&quot; are hydrolases that act on peptide bonds
* &quot;EC 3.4.11&quot; are those hydrolases that cleave off the amino-terminal amino acid from a polypeptide
* &quot;EC 3.4.11.4&quot; are those that cleave off the amino-terminal end from a tripeptide

==Top level codes==
NB:The enzyme classification number is different from the &#x27;FORMAT NUMBER&#x27;
==Reaction similarity==
Similarity between enzymatic reactions can be calculated by using bond changes, reaction centres or substructure metrics (formerly EMBL-EBI Enzyme Portal).

==History==
Before the development of the EC number system, enzymes were named in an arbitrary fashion, and names like old yellow enzyme and malic enzyme that give little or no clue as to what reaction was catalyzed were in common use. Most of these names have fallen into disuse, though a few, especially proteolyic enzymes with very low specificity, such as pepsin and papain, are still used, as rational classification on the basis of specificity has been very difficult.

By the 1950s the chaos was becoming intolerable, and after Hoffman-Ostenhof and Dixon and Webb had proposed somewhat similar schemes for classifying enzyme-catalyzed reactions, the International Congress of Biochemistry in Brussels set up the Commission on Enzymes under the chairmanship of Malcolm Dixon in 1955. The first version was published in 1961, and the Enzyme Commission was dissolved at that time, though its name lives on in the term &quot;EC Number&quot;. The current sixth edition, published by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology in 1992 as the last version published as a printed book, contains 3196 different enzymes. Supplements 1-4 were published 1993–1999. Subsequent supplements have been published electronically, at the website of the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. In August 2018, the IUBMB modified the system by adding the top-level EC 7 category containing translocases.

<text>Waimea Bay is located in Haleiwa on the North Shore of Oʻahu in the Hawaiian Islands at the mouth of the Waimea River. Waimea Valley extends to the east of Waimea Bay. means &quot;reddish water&quot; in Hawaiian.

==History==

On February 27, 1779, Captain Charles Clerke, second in command during the third voyage of James Cook, stopped briefly at Waimea Bay. Clerke had only 2 weeks earlier taken command of the expedition after Cook was killed at Kealakekua Bay on February 14. Waimea Bay was the only O&#x27;ahu anchorage visited by the expedition. Waimea Valley was densely populated at the time, and the remains of Pu&#x27;u o Mahuka, an important heiau (Hawaiian temple) can still be seen above the bay.

==Geography==
Puʻu o Mahuka Heiau State Monument is a Native Hawaiian historical site located just above the bay, off Pupukea Road. It is a historically important site on the North Shore, as well as providing a view of Waimea Bay and the Waianae Mountain range.

Waimea Bay is located along Kamehameha Highway. The bay is on the north-west side of the highway (at the entrance point).

The Waimea Bay shoreline has been experiencing erosion due to both man made and natural causes.

==Surfing==

In winter, Waimea and other North Shore locations such as Pipeline and Sunset Beach host a number of surfing contests because of the large waves found here. These waves are created by winter storms in the North Pacific, and their arrival on O&#x27;ahu&#x27;s North Shore is typically forecast accurately several days in advance. In summer, Waimea typically has clear and calm water.

The surf break at Waimea Bay was significant in the development of big wave surfing. Larger surf at the bay went unridden for years until November 7, 1957 when a handful of surfers finally paddled out and rode the giant waves that break off the northern point of the bay. While the surf only breaks big several times a year, Waimea was the most prestigious big wave surf break in the world for decades. With the advent of tow-in surfing, more and more big wave breaks have been discovered that are far superior in quality to Waimea. However, the bay still holds a significant place even in today&#x27;s world of big wave surfing.

The Quiksilver Big Wave Invitational in Memory of Eddie Aikau takes place in Waimea Bay to honor the legendary surfer and the first lifeguard of the North Shore of Oahu. Since its inception in 1984, the tournament has only been held ten times, due to a precondition that open-ocean swells reach a minimum height of before the competition can be held. Open-ocean swells of this height generally translate to wave faces in the bay of to . The most recent tournament was in January 2023.

On January 28, 1998, Hawaii issued its first ever &quot;condition black&quot; legally closing all North Shore beaches including Waimea Bay. The Quiksilver Big Wave Invitational in Memory of Eddie Aikau was canceled due to above-average behemoth surf.
==In popular culture==
The 1964 film &quot;Ride the Wild Surf&quot; and the Jan and Dean song &quot;Ride the Wild Surf&quot;, which played at the end of the film and became a Top 20 National hit, made Waimea Bay famous.

Waimea Bay was not the primary filming location for the television series &quot;Lost&quot;, although some scenes may have been shot in the park in the valley. (The downed plane was at Mokuleia at the end of Dillingham airstrip almost to road&#x27;s end at Kaena Point.) The actual main location and filming area was at Kawailoa Beach, about 1/2 mile north of Pueana Point.

Waimea Bay is mentioned in the 1963 Beach Boys&#x27; song Surfin&#x27; U.S.A.

Waimea Bay is mentioned in the Jimmy Buffett song Beautiful Swimmers

Waimea Bay is mentioned in the 1987 cult film Surf Nazis Must Die when Adolf asks a young gang member where the best surfing beaches are. There have been many other Hollywood movies such as &quot;Ride the Wild Surf&quot; and &quot;Big Wednesday&quot; filmed there, as well as many surf movies. Waimea Bay&#x27;s shorebreak waves, and the large surf off the point have been the topic of many media documentaries and features

<text>The Five Books of the Lives and Deeds of Gargantua and Pantagruel (), often shortened to Gargantua and Pantagruel or the  (&quot;Five Books&quot;), is a pentalogy of novels written in the 16th century by François Rabelais. It tells the adventures of two giants, Gargantua ( ; ) and his son Pantagruel ( ; ). The work is written in an amusing, extravagant, and satirical vein, features much erudition, vulgarity, and wordplay, and is regularly compared with the works of William Shakespeare and James Joyce. Rabelais was a polyglot, and the work introduced &quot;a great number of new and difficult words ... into the French language&quot;.

The work was stigmatised as obscene by the censors of the . In a social climate of increasing religious oppression in the lead up to the French Wars of Religion, contemporaries treated it with suspicion and avoided mentioning it.

It is the origin of the word &quot;,&quot; meaning &quot;burlesque comedy that has an underlying serious purpose.&quot;

==Initial publication==
The novels were written progressively without a preliminary plan.

==Synopsis==
===&quot;Pantagruel&quot;===
The full modern English title for the work commonly known as Pantagruel is The Horrible and Terrifying Deeds and Words of the Very Renowned Pantagruel King of the Dipsodes, Son of the Great Giant Gargantua and in French, &quot;Les horribles et épouvantables faits et prouesses du très renommé Pantagruel Roi des Dipsodes, fils du Grand Géant Gargantua&quot;. The original title of the work was &quot;Pantagruel roy des dipsodes restitué à son naturel avec ses faictz et prouesses espoventables&quot;. Although most modern editions of Rabelais&#x27; work place &quot;Pantagruel&quot; as the second volume of a series, it was actually published first, around 1532 under the pen name &quot;Alcofribas Nasier&quot;, an anagram of &quot;François Rabelais&quot;.

Inspired by an anonymous book, &quot;The Great Chronicles of the Great and Enormous Giant Gargantua&quot; (in French, &quot;Les Grandes Chroniques du Grand et Enorme Géant Gargantua&quot;), &quot;Pantagruel&quot; is offered as a book of the same sort.

The narrative begins with the origin of giants; Pantagruel&#x27;s particular genealogy; and his birth. His childhood is briefly covered, before his father sends him away to the universities. He acquires a great reputation. On receiving a letter with news that his father has been translated to Fairyland by Morgan le Fay, and that the Dipsodes, hearing of it, have invaded his land and are besieging a city, Pantagruel and his companions depart.

Through subterfuge, might, and urine, the besieged city is relieved, and their residents are invited to invade the Dipsodes, who mostly surrender to Pantagruel as he and his army approach their towns. During a downpour, Pantagruel shelters his army with his tongue, and the narrator travels into Pantagruel&#x27;s mouth. He returns some months later and learns that the hostilities are over.

===&quot;Gargantua&quot;===

After the success of &quot;Pantagruel&quot;, Rabelais revisited and revised his source material, producing an improved narrative of the life and deeds of Pantagruel&#x27;s father: The Very Horrific Life of Great Gargantua, Father of Pantagruel (in French, &quot;La vie très horrifique du grand Gargantua, père de Pantagruel&quot;), commonly known as Gargantua.

The narrative begins with Gargantua&#x27;s birth and childhood. He impresses his father (Grandgousier) with his intelligence, and is entrusted to a tutor. This education renders him a great fool, and he is later sent to Paris with a new tutor.

After Gargantua&#x27;s reeducation, the narrator turns to some bakers from a neighbouring land who are transporting some fouaces. Some shepherds politely ask these bakers to sell them some of the said fouaces, which request escalates into war.

Gargantua is summoned, while Grandgousier seeks peace. The enemy king (Picrochole) is not interested in peace, so Grandgousier reluctantly prepares for violence. Gargantua leads a well-orchestrated assault, and defeats the enemy.

===&quot;The Third Book&quot;===
In The Third Book of Pantagruel (in French, &quot;Le tiers-livre de Pantagruel&quot;; the original title is &quot;Le tiers livre des faicts et dicts héroïques du bon Pantagruel&quot;), Rabelais picks up where &quot;Pantagruel&quot; ended, continuing in the form of a dialogue.

Pantagruel and Panurge discuss the latter&#x27;s profligacy, and Pantagruel determines to pay his debts for him. Panurge, out of debt, becomes interested in marriage, and wants advice.

A multitude of counsels and prognostications are met with, and repeatedly rejected by Panurge, until he wants to consult the Divine Bottle.

Preparations for a voyage thereto are made.

===&quot;The Fourth Book&quot;===
In The Fourth Book of Pantagruel (in French, &quot;Le quart-livre de Pantagruel&quot;; the original title is &quot;Le quart livre des faicts et dicts héroïques du bon Pantagruel&quot;), Rabelais picks up where &quot;The Third Book&quot; ended, with Pantagruel and companions putting to sea for their voyage toward the Divine Bottle, Bacbuc (which is the Hebrew word for &quot;bottle&quot;, בקבוק)

They sail onward, passing, or landing at, places of interest, until they meet a storm, which they endure, until they can land again.

Having returned to sea, they kill a sea-monster, and drag that ashore, where they are attacked by Chitterlings. Fierce culinary combat ensues, but is peaceably resolved, having been interrupted by a flying pig-monster.

Again, they continue their voyage, passing, or landing at, places of interest, until the book ends, with the ships firing a salute, and Panurge soiling himself.

===&quot;The Fifth Book&quot;===

The Fifth Book of Pantagruel (in French, &quot;Le cinquième-livre de Pantagruel&quot;; the original title is &quot;Le cinquiesme et dernier livre des faicts et dicts héroïques du bon Pantagruel&quot;) was published posthumously around 1564, and chronicles the further journeyings of Pantagruel and his friends. 

At Ringing Island, the company find birds living in the same hierarchy as the Catholic Church. On Tool Island, the people are so fat they slit their skin to allow the fat to puff out. At the next island they are imprisoned by Furred Law-Cats, and escape only by answering a riddle. Nearby, they find an island of lawyers who nourish themselves on protracted court cases. In the Queendom of Whims, they uncomprehendingly watch a living-figure chess match with the miracle-working and prolix Queen Quintessence.

Passing by the abbey of the sexually prolific Semiquavers, and the Elephants and monstrous Hearsay of Satin Island, they come to the realms of darkness. Led by a guide from Lanternland, they go deep below the earth to the oracle of Bacbuc. After much admiring of the architecture and many religious ceremonies, they come to the sacred bottle itself. It utters the one word &quot;trinc&quot;. After drinking liquid text from a book of interpretation, Panurge concludes wine inspires him to right action, and he forthwith vows to marry as quickly and as often as possible.

==Analysis==
===Authorship of The Fifth Book===
The authenticity of &quot;The Fifth Book&quot; has been doubted since it first appeared in 1564. (Rabelais died in 1553.) Both during and after Rabelais&#x27; life, books that he did not write were published in his name. &quot;The Fifth Book of Pantagruel&quot; that usually accompanies the other, certainly genuine, books, is not the only &quot;Fifth Book of Pantagruel&quot; known to have existed. At least one pseudo-Rabelaisian book was merely subsumed by this &quot;Fifth Book&quot; that accompanies Rabelais&#x27; certain books. It includes much &quot;flatly borrowed [...] and dull material&quot;.

Some people believe the book was based on some of Rabelais&#x27; papers; some believe that it has &quot;nothing to do with Rabelais&quot;. M. A. Screech is of this latter opinion, and, introducing his translation, he bemoans that &quot;[s]ome read back into the Four books the often cryptic meanings they find in the &quot;Fifth&quot;&quot;. Donald M. Frame is of the opinion that, when Rabelais died, he &quot;probably left some materials on where to go on from Book 4&quot;, and that somebody, &quot;after some adding and padding&quot;, assembled the book that he does not find &quot;either clearly or largely authentic&quot;. Frame is &quot;taken with&quot; Mireille Huchon&#x27;s work in &quot;Rabelais Grammairien&quot;, which he cites in support of his opinion. J. M. Cohen, in his Introduction to a Penguin Classics edition, indicates that chapters 17–48 were so out-of-character as to be seemingly written by another person, with the Fifth Book &quot;clumsily patched together by an unskilful editor.&quot;

===Bakhtin&#x27;s analysis of Rabelais===
Mikhail Bakhtin&#x27;s book &quot;Rabelais and His World&quot; (published in 1965) explores &quot;Gargantua and Pantagruel&quot; and is considered a classic of Renaissance studies. Bakhtin declares that for centuries Rabelais&#x27; book had been misunderstood. Throughout &quot;Rabelais and His World&quot;, Bakhtin attempts two things. First, to recover sections of Gargantua and Pantagruel that in the past were either ignored or suppressed. Secondly, to conduct an analysis of the Renaissance social system in order to discover the balance between language that was permitted and language which was not.

Through this analysis, Bakhtin pinpoints two important subtexts in Rabelais&#x27; work: the first is carnivalesque which Bakhtin describes as a social institution, and the second is grotesque realism, which is defined as a literary mode. Thus, in &quot;Rabelais and His World&quot;, Bakhtin studies the interaction between the social and the literary, as well as the meaning of the body.

Bakhtin explains that &quot;carnival&quot; in Rabelais&#x27; work and age is associated with the collectivity, for those attending a carnival do not merely constitute a crowd. Rather the people are seen as a whole, organized in a way that defies socioeconomic and political organization. According to Bakhtin, &quot;[A]ll were considered equal during carnival. Here, in the town square, a special form of free and familiar contact reigned among people who were usually divided by the barriers of caste, property, profession, and age&quot;.

At carnival time, the unique sense of time and space causes the individual to feel he is a part of the collectivity, at which point he ceases to be himself. It is at this point that, through costume and mask, an individual exchanges bodies and is renewed. At the same time there arises a heightened awareness of one&#x27;s sensual, material, bodily unity and community.

Bakhtin says also that in Rabelais the notion of carnival is connected with that of the grotesque. The collectivity partaking in the carnival is aware of its unity in time as well as its historic immortality associated with its continual death and renewal. According to Bakhtin, the body is in need of a type of clock if it is to be aware of its timelessness. The grotesque is the term used by Bakhtin to describe the emphasis of bodily changes through eating, evacuation, and sex: Rabelais uses it as a measuring device.

===Contradiction and conflicting interpretations===
The five books of &quot;Gargantua and Pantagruel&quot; often open with &quot;Gargantua&quot;, which itself opens with Socrates, in &quot;The Symposium&quot;, being likened to Sileni. Sileni, as Rabelais informs the reader, were little boxes &quot;painted on the outside with merry frivolous pictures&quot; but used to store items of high value. In Socrates, and particularly in &quot;The Symposium&quot;, Rabelais found a person who exemplified many paradoxes, and provided a precedent for his &quot;own brand of serious play&quot;. In these opening pages of &quot;Gargantua&quot;, Rabelais exhorts the reader &quot;to disregard the ludicrous surface and seek out the hidden wisdom of his book&quot;; but immediately &quot;mocks those who would extract allegorical meanings from the works of Homer and Ovid&quot;. As Rudnytsky says, &quot;the problem of conflicting interpretations broached in the Prologue to &quot;Gargantua&quot; is reenacted by Rabelais in various forms throughout his work&quot;. Moreover, as he points out, this &quot;play of double senses&quot; has misled even the most expert of commentators.

===Satire===
Rabelais has &quot;frequently been named as the world&#x27;s greatest comic genius&quot;; and &quot;Gargantua and Pantagruel&quot; covers &quot;the entire satirical spectrum&quot;. Its &quot;combination of diverse satirical traditions&quot; challenges &quot;the readers&#x27; capacity for critical independent thinking&quot;; which latter, according to Bernd Renner, is &quot;the main concern&quot;. It also promotes &quot;the advancement of humanist learning, the evangelical reform of the Church, [and] the need for humanity and brotherhood in politics&quot;, among other things.

According to John Parkin, the &quot;humorous agendas are basically four&quot;: 
*the &quot;campaigns in which Rabelais engaged, using laughter to enhance his principles&quot;; 
* he &quot;derides medieval scholarship both in its methods and its representatives&quot;; 
* he &quot;mocks ritual prayer, the traffic in indulgences, monasticism, pilgrimage, Roman rather than universal Catholicism, and its converse, dogmatic Protestantism&quot;; 
* and he &quot;lampoons the emperor Charles V, implying that his policies are tyrannical&quot;.

==Reception and influence==

In the wake of Rabelais&#x27; book the word gargantuan (glutton) emerged, which in Hebrew is גרגרן Gargrån. French &quot;&quot;, following betacism a likely etymology of his name, means to swallow, to clean.

===English literature===
There is evidence of deliberate and avowed imitation of Rabelais&#x27; style, in English, as early as 1534. The full extent of Rabelais&#x27; influence is complicated by the known existence of a chapbook, probably called &quot;The History of Gargantua&quot;, translated around 1567; and the &quot;Songes drolatiques Pantagruel&quot; (1565), ascribed to Rabelais, and used by Inigo Jones. This complication manifests itself, for example, in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;As You Like It&quot;, where &quot;Gargantua&#x27;s mouth&quot; is mentioned; but evidence that Shakespeare read Rabelais is only &quot;suggestive&quot;. A list of those who quoted or alluded to Rabelais before he was translated includes: Ben Jonson, John Donne, John Webster, Francis Bacon, Robert Burton, and James VI and I. In intellectual circles, at the time, to quote or name Rabelais was &quot;to signal an urban(e) wit, [and] good education&quot;; though others, particularly Puritans, cited him with &quot;dislike or contempt&quot;. Rabelais&#x27; fame and influence increased after Urquhart&#x27;s translation; later, there were many perceptive imitators, including Jonathan Swift (&quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;) and Laurence Sterne (&quot;Tristram Shandy&quot;). James Joyce&#x27;s familiarity with Rabelais has been a vexed point, but &quot;[t]here is now ample evidence both that Joyce was more familiar with Rabelais&#x27; work than he admitted and that he made use of it in &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;&quot;.

==English translations==
===Urquhart and Motteux===
The work was first translated into English by Thomas Urquhart (the first three books) and Peter Anthony Motteux (the fourth and fifth) in the late seventeenth-century. Terence Cave, in an introduction to an Everyman&#x27;s Library edition, notes that both adapted the anti-Catholic satire. Moreover, 
The translation is also extremely free. Urquhart&#x27;s rendering of the first three books is half as long again as the original. Many of the additions spring from a cheerful espousal of Rabelais&#x27;s copious style. [...] Le Motteux is a little more restrained, but he too makes no bones about adding material of his own. [...] It is a literary work in its own right. 
J. M. Cohen, in the preface to his translation, says Urquhart&#x27;s part is &quot;more like a brilliant recasting and expansion than a translation&quot;; but criticised Motteux&#x27;s as &quot;no better than competent hackwork... [W]here Urquhart often enriches, he invariably impoverishes&quot;. Likewise, M. A. Screech says that the &quot;translation of Urquhart and Motteux [...] is at times a recasting [...] rather than a translation&quot;; and says it &quot;remains a joy to read for its own self&quot;. Donald M. Frame, with his own translation, says he finds &quot;Sir Thomas Urquhart [...] savory and picturesque but too much Urquhart and at times too little R&quot;.

The translation has been used for many editions, including that of Britannica&#x27;s &quot;Great Books of the Western World&quot;.

From &quot;The Third Book&quot;, Chapter Seven: Copsbody, this is not the Carpet whereon my Treasurer shall be allowed to play false in his Accompts with me, by setting down an X for an V, or an L for an S; for in that case, should I make a hail of Fisti-cuffs to fly into his face.

===Smith===
William Francis Smith (1842–1919) made a translation in 1893, trying to match Rabelais&#x27; sentence forms exactly, which renders the English obscure in places. For example, the convent prior exclaims against Friar John when the latter bursts into the chapel,
What will this drunken Fellow do here? Let one take me him to prison. Thus to disturb divine Service!
Smith&#x27;s version includes copious notes.

Donald M. Frame, with his own translation, says that Smith &quot;was an excellent scholar; but he shuns R&#x27;s obscenities and lacks his raciness&quot;.

===Putnam===
Also well annotated is an abridged but vivid translation of 1946 by Samuel Putnam, which appears in a Viking Portable edition that was still in print as late as 1968. Putnam omitted sections he believed of lesser interest to modern readers, including the entirety of the fifth book. The annotations occur every few pages, explain obscure references, and fill the reader in as to original content excised by him.

Donald M. Frame, with his own translation, calls Putnam&#x27;s edition &quot;arguably the best we have&quot;; but notes that &quot;English versions of Rabelais [...] all have serious weaknesses&quot;.

===Cohen===
John Michael Cohen&#x27;s modern translation, first published in 1955 by Penguin, &quot;admirably preserves the frankness and vitality of the original&quot;, according to its back cover, although it provides limited explanation of Rabelais&#x27; word-plays and allusions.

Donald M. Frame, with his own translation, says that Cohen&#x27;s, &quot;although in the main sound, is marred by his ignorance of sixteenth-century French&quot;.

===Frame===
An annotated translation of Rabelais&#x27; complete works by Donald M. Frame was published posthumously in 1991. In a translator&#x27;s note, he says: &quot;My aim in this version, as always, is fidelity (which is not always literalness): to put into standard American English what I think R would (or at least might) have written if he were using that English today.&quot;

Frame&#x27;s edition, according to Terence Cave, &quot;is to be recommended not only because it contains the complete works but also because the translator was an internationally renowned specialist in French Renaissance studies&quot;.

However, M. A. Screech, with his own translation, says: &quot;I read Donald Frame&#x27;s translation [...] but have not regularly done so since&quot;, noting that &quot;[h]ad he lived he would have eliminated [...] the gaps, errors and misreadings of his manuscript&quot;. Barbara C. Bowen has similar misgivings, saying that Frame&#x27;s translation &quot;gives us the content, probably better than most others, but cannot give us the flavor of Rabelais&#x27;s text&quot;; and, elsewhere, says it is &quot;better than nothing&quot;.

From &quot;The Third Book&quot;, Chapter Seven: &#x27;Odsbody! On this bureau of mine my paymaster had better not play around with stretching the &quot;esses&quot;, or my fists would go trotting all over him!

===Screech===
Penguin published a translation by M. A. Screech in 2006 which incorporates textual variants; and brief notes on sources, puns, and allusions. In a translator&#x27;s note, he says: &quot;My aim here for Rabelais (as for my Penguin Montaigne) is to turn him loyally into readable and enjoyable English.&quot;

From &quot;The Third Book&quot;, Chapter Seven: Crikey. My accountant had better not play about on my bureau, stretching esses into efs - &quot;sous&quot; into &quot;francs&quot;! Otherwise blows from my fist would trot all over his dial!

==Illustrations==

An example of the giants&#x27; shift in body size, above where people are the size of Pantagruel&#x27;s foot, and below where Gargantua is under twice the height of a human.
The most famous and reproduced illustrations for &quot;Gargantua and Pantagruel&quot; were done by French artist Gustave Doré and published in 1854. Over 400 additional drawings were done by Doré for the 1873 second edition of the book. An edition published in 1904 was illustrated by W. Heath Robinson. Another set of illustrations was created by French artist Joseph Hémard and published in 1922. Frank C. Papé illustrated an edition published in 1927.

<text>The University of Hawaiʻi System is a public college and university system in Hawaiʻi. The system confers associate, bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and doctoral degrees through three universities, seven community colleges, an employment training center, three university centers, four education centers, and various other research facilities distributed across six islands throughout the state of Hawaii.

All schools in the University of Hawaiʻi System are accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. The system&#x27;s main administrative offices are located on the property of the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa in Honolulu&#x27;s.

==History==

The University of Hawai&#x27;i System was created in 1965, combining the State of Hawai&#x27;i&#x27;s technical and community colleges into a single system within the former University of Hawaiʻi.

The original University of Hawaiʻi was established by the Territory of Hawaiʻi in 1907 as a land-grant college for agriculture and mechanical arts, holding its first classes that same year. In 1912, it moved to its current location in Mānoa Valley and was renamed the College of Hawaii. In 1919, the Hawaiʻi Territorial Legislature granted the College of Hawaiʻi university status, renaming it the University of Hawaiʻi.

In 1965, the state legislature created a system of community colleges and placed it within the university. To distinguish it from other campuses in the University of Hawaiʻi System, the university was renamed the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa in 1972.

==Colleges and universities==
The University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa is the flagship institution of the University of Hawaiʻi system. It was founded as a land-grant college under the terms of the Morrill Acts of 1862 and 1890. Programs include Hawaiian/Pacific Studies, Astronomy, East Asian Languages and Literature, Asian Studies, Comparative Philosophy, Marine Science, Second Language Studies, along with Botany, Engineering, Ethnomusicology, Geophysics, Law, Business, Linguistics, Mathematics, and Medicine.

The second-largest institution is the University of Hawaiʻi at Hilo on the Hawaii, with over 3,000 students. The University of Hawaiʻi – West Oʻahu in Kapolei primarily serves students residing in western and central suburban Honolulu&#x27;s communities.

The University of Hawaiʻi Community College System comprises four island campuses on O&#x27;ahu and one each on Maui, Kauaʻi, and Hawaii. These colleges were established to improve course accessibility for more Hawaiʻi residents and provide an affordable means of easing the transition from secondary school/high school to college for many students. University of Hawaiʻi education centers are located in more remote areas of the State and its several islands, supporting rural communities through distance education.

It oversees all aspects of governance for the university system, including its internal structure and management, and also appoints, evaluates, and, if necessary, removes the president of the University of Hawaiʻi.

===Student regents===
The university&#x27;s governing board includes a current student, appointed by the governor of Hawaiʻi, who serves a two-year term as a full voting regent. The Hawaiʻi State Legislature approved the practice of appointing a student to the board in 1997.

==Notable alumni==
Alumni of the University of Hawaiʻi system include many notable individuals from various walks of life. Senators Daniel Inouye and Tammy Duckworth are both veterans of the U.S. military who were injured in the line of duty and later entered government service. Bette Midler and Georgia Engel are successful entertainers. Composer Hsiung-Zee Wong also attended the University of Hawai&#x27;i. President Barack Obama&#x27;s parents, Barack Obama Sr. and Ann Dunham, and half-sister, Maya Soetoro-Ng, earned degrees from the Mānoa campus, where his parents met in a Russian language class. His mother earned three degrees from the University of Hawaiʻi, including a PhD in anthropology.

Mazie Hirono is a current U.S. senator and a graduate of the University of Hawaii with a BA in psychology. She is the first elected female senator from Hawaii, the first Asian-American woman elected to the Senate, the first U.S. senator born in Japan, and the nation&#x27;s first Buddhist senator.

Alice Augusta Ball was the first woman to graduate from the College of Hawaiʻi (now the University of Hawaiʻi) in 1915, as well as the first African American research chemist and instructor in the college&#x27;s chemistry department. She was also the first person to successfully develop a water-soluble form of chaulmoogra oil, used for decades to relieve the symptoms of Hansen&#x27;s disease (leprosy).

==Notable faculty==
The University of Hawaiʻi system has had many noteworthy faculty members, including visiting faculty and those who arrived after winning major awards, such as Nobel Laureate Georg von Békésy. Ryuzo Yanagimachi, principal investigator of the research group that developed a method of cloning from adult animal cells, remains on the faculty.

In July 2019, Bob Huey, a professor of Japanese literature in the Department of East Asian Languages and Literatures, was presented with the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold Rays with Neck Ribbon, one of Japan&#x27;s highest honors for non-Japanese citizens.

<doc id="194711" wikidata="Q443904" url="?curid=194711" title="Beryl Markham">
<text>Beryl Markham (born Clutterbuck; 26 October 1902 – 3 August 1986) was a Kenyan aviator born in England (one of the first bush pilots), adventurer, racehorse trainer and author. She was the first person to fly solo, non-stop across the Atlantic from Britain to North America. She wrote about her adventures in her memoir, &quot;West with the Night&quot;.

==Early years==
Markham was born in the village of Ashwell, in the county of Rutland, England, the daughter of Charles Baldwin Clutterbuck, a horse trainer, and Clara Agnes (&quot;née&quot; Alexander) (1878–1952). She had an older brother, Richard Alexander &quot;Dickie&quot; Clutterbuck (1900–1927).

When she was four years old, she moved with her father to Kenya, which was then colonial British East Africa. He built a horse racing farm in Njoro, near the Great Rift Valley between the Mau Escarpment and the Rongai Valley. Markham spent an adventurous childhood learning, playing, and hunting with the local children of all races. On her family&#x27;s farm, she developed her knowledge of and love for horses, establishing herself as a trainer at the age of 17, after her father left for Peru.

She befriended the Danish writer Karen Blixen during the years that Blixen was managing her family&#x27;s coffee farm in the Ngong hills outside Nairobi. When Blixen&#x27;s romantic connection with the hunter and pilot Denys Finch Hatton was winding down, Markham started her own affair with him. He invited her to tour game lands on what turned out to be his fatal flight, but Markham supposedly declined because of a premonition of her flight instructor, British pilot Tom Campbell Black.

Inspired and coached by Tom Campbell Black, Markham learned to fly. She worked for some time as a bush pilot, spotting game animals from the air and signalling their locations to safaris on the ground.
Markham was married three times, taking the name Markham from her second husband, the wealthy Mansfield Markham, with whom she had a son, Gervase.

In 1928, while pregnant with Gervase, she entered into an affair with Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester – known informally as Harry – the son of George V, who became besotted with her during his trip to Kenya. It is said that Beryl also simultaneously had an affair with Harry&#x27;s older brother, Edward, Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII) during this time.

Returning to England, Harry installed Beryl as his mistress in the Grosvenor House Hotel, a few minutes&#x27; walk from Buckingham Palace. George V attempted to end the affair by sending Harry on a royal visit to Japan, but the affair resumed on his return to England. Historian Jane Ridley notes that Beryl &quot;was spotted running barefoot along the corridors of Buckingham Palace&quot;. Mansfield later threatened to divorce Beryl and cite Harry as a co-respondent. Though Mansfield and his brother Charles were vociferously warned against &quot;citing a prince of the blood in a divorce petition&quot; by Queen Mary, the Palace agreed to pay up in the face of the brother&#x27;s blackmail attempts. £15,000 was placed in a trust fund, providing Beryl with an annuity of £500 (around £32,000 in 2021).

Beryl also had an affair with Hubert Broad, who was later named by Mansfield Markham as a co-respondent in his 1937 divorce from Markham. After her Atlantic crossing, she returned to be with Broad, who was also an influence in her flying career.

== Record flight ==

In 1936, Markham made a solo flight across the Atlantic, from England to North America. When she decided to take on the Atlantic crossing, no pilot had yet flown non-stop from Europe to New York. On 4 September 1936, she took off from Abingdon, southern England. After a 20-hour flight, her Percival Vega Gull, &quot;VP-KCC&quot; named &quot;The Messenger&quot;, suffered fuel starvation due to icing of the fuel tank vents, and she crash-landed at Baleine Cove on Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, Canada. She became the first person to make it from England to North America non-stop from east to west, and was celebrated as an aviation pioneer.

Markham chronicled many of her adventures in her memoir, &quot;West with the Night&quot;, published in 1942. Despite strong reviews in the press, the book sold modestly, and then quickly went out of print. After living for many years in the United States, Markham moved back to Kenya in 1952.

== Rediscovery ==
Markham&#x27;s memoir lingered in obscurity until 1982, when California restaurateur George Gutekunst read a collection of Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s letters, including one in which Hemingway praised Markham&#x27;s writing:

Intrigued, Gutekunst read &quot;West with the Night&quot; and became so enamoured of Markham&#x27;s prose that he helped persuade a California publisher, North Point Press, to re-issue the book in 1983. The re-release of the book led to praise for the 80-year-old Markham as a great author as well as flyer.

When found in Kenya by AP East Africa correspondent Barry Shlachter, Markham was living in poverty. She had recently been badly beaten during a burglary at her house near the Nairobi racetrack, where she still trained thoroughbreds. The success of the re-issue of &quot;West with the Night&quot; provided enough income for Markham to finish her life in relative comfort. Earlier, she had been supported by a circle of friends and owners of race horses she trained into her 80s. The book became a best-seller, spurred by the 1986 broadcast of a public television documentary about Markham&#x27;s life, &quot;World Without Walls: Beryl Markham&#x27;s African Memoir&quot;, produced by Gutekunst, Shlachter, Joan Saffa, Stephen Talbot and Judy Flannery in collaboration with KQED-TV in San Francisco. Gutekunst and Shlachter had approached the station to co-operate on the documentary, directed by Andrew Maxwell-Hyslop. Actor Lyle Talbot narrated the film, British actress Diana Quick was the voice of Markham in readings from her memoir, and Shlachter conducted most of the interviews. CNN Africa correspondent Gary Streiker did the filming for the well-reviewed, award-winning PBS program.

Markham died in Nairobi in 1986. Her short stories were posthumously collected in &quot;The Splendid Outcast&quot;, with an introduction by Mary S. Lovell. A tale from &quot;West with the Night&quot; was excerpted and illustrated by Don Brown as a children&#x27;s book, &quot;The Good Lion&quot;. In 1988, CBS aired the biographical miniseries, &quot;Beryl Markham: A Shadow on the Sun&quot;, with Stefanie Powers in the title role.

Both &quot;West with the Night&quot; and &quot;Splendid Outcast&quot; appeared on the &quot;New York Times&quot; best-seller list of hardcover fiction.

== Authorship controversy ==
Critics raised questions as to whether Markham was the true, or sole author of &quot;West with the Night&quot;, when her third husband Raoul C. Schumacher made claims to the book. Evidence abounds that she was indeed the sole author; copies of the manuscripts sent to her editor prior to Markham meeting her ex-husband quickly silenced the critics and his claims. Schumacher was lodging with Hollywood writer Allen Vincent in California according to the 1940 census and Markham re-entered the United States via Florida in 1941. It is unlikely that Schumacher would have had time to process such a detailed biography in such a short time, but may have suggested it might make a Hollywood film to encourage Markham to marry him.

Author Mary S. Lovell visited Markham in Nairobi and interviewed her extensively shortly before Markham&#x27;s death, in preparation for her biography, &quot;Straight on Till Morning&quot; (1987). From her research, Lovell concluded that Markham was the sole author, although Schumacher made some basic edits to the manuscript. Instead, Lovell suggests Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, another of Markham&#x27;s lovers, may have served as inspiration for Markham&#x27;s clear, elegant language and storytelling style.

<doc id="194714" wikidata="Q224086" url="?curid=194714" title="Kahoʻolawe">
<text>Kahoolawe (Hawaiian: ), anglicized as Kahoolawe ( ), is the smallest of the eight main volcanic islands of the Hawaiian Islands. Unpopulated, it lies about southwest of Maui. The island is long by wide, with a total land area of . Its highest point is the crater of Lua Makika, at the summit of Puʻu Moaulanui, about above sea level.

Kahoʻolawe is relatively dry, with an average annual rainfall of less than resulting from a combination of being too low to generate much orographic precipitation from the northeastern trade winds and lying in the rain shadow of eastern Maui&#x27;s volcano, Haleakalā. More than one quarter of Kahoʻolawe has been eroded down to saprolitic hardpan soil, largely on exposed surfaces near the summit.

Historically, Kahoʻolawe was always sparsely populated, due to its lack of fresh water. During World War II and the following decades, it was used as a training ground and bombing range by the Armed Forces of the United States. After decades of protests, the U.S. Navy ended live-fire training exercises on Kahoʻolawe in 1990, and the whole island was transferred to the jurisdiction of the state of Hawaii in 1994. The Hawaii State Legislature established the Kahoʻolawe Island Reserve to restore and to oversee the island and its surrounding waters. Today Kahoʻolawe can be used only for native Hawaiian cultural, spiritual, and subsistence purposes. It has no permanent residents.

==Geology==

Kahoʻolawe is an extinct shield volcano, which formed during the Pleistocene epoch. It was once connected to the island of Maui Nui before splitting off about 300,000 years ago. Most of the island is covered by basaltic lava flows. A caldera is located in the eastern part of the island. The last confirmed volcanic activity on the island occurred about one million years ago, though eruptions could have occurred about 10,000 years ago.

==Climate==
Kahoʻolawe experiences a semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSh&quot;).

==History==
===Settlement===
Sometime around the year 1000, Kahoʻolawe was settled by Polynesians, and small, temporary fishing communities were established along the coast. Some inland areas were cultivated. Puʻu Moiwi, a remnant cinder cone, is the location of the second-largest basalt quarry in Hawaiʻi, and this was mined for use in stone tools such as &quot;koʻi&quot; (adzes). Originally a dry forest environment with intermittent streams, the land changed to an open savanna of grassland and trees when inhabitants cleared vegetation for firewood and agriculture. Hawaiians built stone platforms for religious ceremonies, set rocks upright as shrines for successful fishing trips, and carved petroglyphs, or drawings, into the flat surfaces of rocks; these indicators of an earlier time can still be found on Kahoʻolawe. The island itself is venerated as a &quot;kinolau&quot; or body form of the sea god Kanaloa.

While it is not known how many people inhabited Kahoʻolawe, the lack of freshwater probably limited the population to a few hundred people. As many as 120 people might have once lived at Hakioawa, the largest settlement, which was located at the northeastern end of the island—facing Maui.

The U.S. Census Bureau defines Kahoʻolawe as Block Group 9, Census Tract 303.02 of Maui County, Hawaii.

===Warfare===
Violent wars among competing &quot;aliʻi&quot; (chiefs) laid waste to the land and led to a decline in the population. During the 18th century War of Kamokuhi, Kalaniʻōpuʻu, the ruler of the Big Island of Hawaii, raided and pillaged Kahoʻolawe in an unsuccessful attempt to take Maui from Kahekili II, the King of Maui.

===Post-contact===
From 1778 to the early 19th century, observers on passing ships reported that Kahoʻolawe was uninhabited and barren, destitute of both water and wood.

After the arrival of missionaries from New England, the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi under the rule of King Kamehameha III replaced the death penalty with exile, and Kahoʻolawe became a men&#x27;s penal colony sometime around 1830. Food and water were scarce, some prisoners reportedly starved, and some of them swam across the channel to Maui to find food. The law making the island a penal colony was repealed in 1853.

A survey of Kahoʻolawe in 1857 reported about 50 residents here, about of land covered with shrubs, and a patch of sugarcane growth. Along the shore, tobacco, pineapple, gourds, pili grass, and scrub trees grew. Beginning in 1858, the Hawaiian government leased Kahoʻolawe to a series of ranching ventures. Some of these proved to be more successful than others, but the lack of freshwater was an unrelenting hindrance. Through the next 80 years, the landscape changed dramatically, with drought and uncontrolled overgrazing denuding much of the island. Strong trade winds blew away most of the topsoil, leaving behind red hardpan dirt.

===20th century===
From 1910 to 1918, the Territory of Hawaii designated Kahoʻolawe as a forest reserve in the hope of restoring the island through a revegetation and livestock removal program. This program failed, and leases again became available. In 1918, the rancher Angus MacPhee of Wyoming, with the help of the landowner Harry Baldwin of Maui, leased the island for 21 years, intending to build a cattle ranch there. By 1932, the ranching operation was enjoying moderate success. After heavy rains, native grasses and flowering plants would sprout, but droughts always returned. In 1941, MacPhee sublet part of the island to the U.S. Army. Later that year, because of continuing drought, MacPhee removed his cattle from the island.

===Training grounds===
On December 7, 1941, after the Imperial Japanese Navy attacked Pearl Harbor and Oahu, the U.S. Army declared martial law throughout Hawaii, and it used Kahoʻolawe as a place to train American soldiers and Marines headed west to engage in the War in the Pacific. The use of Kahoʻolawe as a bombing range was believed to be critical, since the United States was executing a new type of war in the Pacific Islands. Their success depended on accurate naval gunfire support that suppressed or destroyed enemy positions as U.S. Marines and soldiers struggled to get ashore. Thousands of soldiers, sailors, Marines, airmen, and coastguardsmen prepared on Kahoʻolawe for the brutal and costly assaults on islands such as the Gilbert and Marshall Islands, the Marianas and Pelileu, New Guinea in the Western Pacific.

Military and naval training on Kahoʻolawe continued following World War II. During the Korean War, warplanes from aircraft carriers played a critical role in attacking enemy airfields, convoys, and troop staging areas. Mock-ups of airfields, military camps, and vehicles were constructed on Kahoʻolawe, and while pilots were preparing for war at Barbers Point Naval Air Station on Oʻahu, they practiced spotting and hitting the mock-ups at Kahoʻolawe. Similar training took place throughout the Cold War and during the War in Vietnam, with mock-ups of aircraft, radar installations, gun mounts, and surface-to-air missile sites being placed across this island for pilots and bombardiers to use in their training.

In early 1965, the U.S. Navy conducted Operation Sailor Hat to determine the blast resistance of ships. Three onshore tests on the eastern shore of Kahoʻolawe near Smuggler Cove subjected the island and a target ship to massive explosions, with 500 tons of conventional TNT detonated on the island near the target ship . This warship was damaged, but she was not sunk. The blasts created a crater on the island known as &quot;Sailor Man&#x27;s Cap&quot; and are speculated to have cracked the island&#x27;s caprock, causing some groundwater to be lost into the ocean.
===Operation Protect Kahoʻolawe ʻOhana (PKO)===
In 1976, a group called the Protect Kahoʻolawe ʻOhana (PKO) filed suit in U.S. Federal Court to stop the Navy&#x27;s use of Kahoʻolawe for bombardment training, to require compliance with a number of new environmental laws and to ensure protection of cultural resources on the island. In 1977, the U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii allowed the Navy&#x27;s use of this island to continue, but the Court directed the Navy to prepare an environmental impact statement and to complete an inventory of historic sites on the island.

The effort to regain Kaho‘olawe from the U.S. Navy began as a new wave of political awareness and activism was inspired within the Hawaiian community. Charles Maxwell and other community leaders began to plan a coordinated effort to land on the island, which was still under Navy control. The effort for the &quot;first landing&quot; began in Waikapu, on Maui, on January 5, 1976. Over 50 people from across the Hawaiian islands, including a range of cultural leaders, gathered on Maui with the goal of &quot;invading&quot; Kahoʻolawe on January 6, 1976. The date was selected because of its association with the United States&#x27; bicentennial anniversary.

As the group headed towards the island, they were intercepted by military craft. One boat, occupied by the so-called &quot;Kahoʻolawe Nine&quot;, continued and successfully landed on the island. This group comprised Walter Ritte, Emmett Aluli, George Helm, Gail Kawaipuna Prejean, Stephen K. Morse, Kimo Aluli, Ellen Miles, Ian Lind, and Karla Villalba (of the Puyallup/Muckleshoot tribe of Washington State).
On the way back to Maui, George Helm and Kimo Mitchell ran into severe weather and were unable to reach land. Despite extensive rescue and recovery efforts, they were never recovered.
Ritte became a leader in the Hawaiian community, coordinating community efforts including for water rights, opposition to land development, and the protection of marine animals and ocean resources.

===Kahoʻolawe Island Archeological District===
On March 18, 1981, the entire island of Kahoʻolawe was added to the National Register of Historic Places. At that time, the Kahoʻolawe Archaeological District was noted to contain 544 recorded archaeological or historic sites and over 2,000 individual features. As part of the soil conservation efforts, Mike Ruppe, an Army Specialist on loan from Schofield Barracks, plus other military personnel, laid lines of explosives, detonating them to break the hardpan so that seedling trees could be planted. Used car tires were taken to Kahoʻolawe and placed in miles of deep gullies to slow the washing of red soil from the barren uplands to the surrounding shores. Ordnance and scrap metal was picked up by hand and then transported by large trucks to a collection site. It is also on the Hawaiʻi Register of Historic Places.

===End of live-fire training===
In 1990, President George H. W. Bush ordered an end to live-fire training on the island. The U.S. Department of Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1991 established the Kahoʻolawe Island Conveyance Commission to recommend terms and conditions for the conveyance of Kahoʻolawe from the U.S. government to the state of Hawaii.

===Transfer of title and UXO cleanup===
In 1993, Senator Daniel Inouye of Hawaii sponsored Title X of the Fiscal Year 1994 for the Department of Defense appropriation bill, directing that the U.S. government convey Kahoʻolawe and its surrounding waters to the state of Hawaii. Title X also established the objective of a &quot;clearance or removal of unexploded ordnance (UXO)&quot; and the environmental restoration of the island, to provide &quot;meaningful safe use of the island for appropriate cultural, historical, archaeological, and educational purposes, as determined by the State of Hawaii.&quot; In turn, the Legislature of Hawaii created the Kahoʻolawe Island Reserve Commission to exercise policy and management oversight of the Kahoʻolawe Island Reserve. As directed by Title X and in accordance with a required memorandum of understanding between the U.S. Navy and the state of Hawaii, the Navy transferred the title to the land of Kahoʻolawe to the state of Hawaii on May 9, 1994.

As required by Title X, the U.S. Navy retained access control to the island until the clearance and environmental restoration projects were completed, or until November 11, 2003, whichever came first. The state agreed to prepare a use plan for Kahoʻolawe and the Navy agreed to develop a cleanup plan based on that use plan and to implement that plan to the extent Congress provided funds for that purpose.

In July 1997, the Navy awarded a contract to the Parsons/UXB Joint Venture to clear unexploded ordnance from the island to the extent funds were provided by Congress. After the state and public review of the Navy cleanup plan, Parsons/UXB began their work on the island in November 1998.

From 1998 to 2003, the U.S. Navy executed a large-scale, but limited, removal of unexploded ordnance and other environmental hazards from Kahoʻolawe. Since the clearance did not completely remove all the hazardous and dangerous materials from the island, a residual level of danger remains. The Kahoʻolawe Island Reserve Commission developed a plan to manage the residual risk to reserve users and to carry out a safety program, and to establish stewardship organizations to work in conjunction with the commission.

===Fire===
In 2020, a wildfire burned more than 30% of the island. Firefighters abandoned suppression efforts on the first day of the fire due to fears about unexploded ordnance.

==Kahoʻolawe Island Reserve==
In 1993, the Hawaiian State Legislature established the Kahoʻolawe Island Reserve, consisting of &quot;the entire island and its surrounding ocean waters in a two mile (three km) radius from the shore&quot;. By state law, Kahoʻolawe and its waters can be used only for Native Hawaiian cultural, spiritual, and subsistence purposes; fishing; environmental restoration; historic preservation; and education. All commercial uses are prohibited.

The legislature also created the Kahoʻolawe Island Reserve Commission to manage the reserve. The restoration of Kahoʻolawe will require a strategy to control erosion, re-establish vegetation, recharge the water table, and gradually replace alien plants with native species. Plans will include methods for damming gullies and reducing rainwater runoff. In some areas, non-native plants will temporarily stabilize soils before planting of permanent native species. Species used for revegetation include &quot;ʻaʻaliʻi&quot; (&quot;Dodonaea viscosa&quot;), &quot;ʻāheahea&quot; (&quot;Chenopodium oahuense&quot;), &quot;kuluʻī&quot; (&quot;Nototrichium sandwicense&quot;), &quot;Achyranthes splendens&quot;, &quot;ʻūlei&quot; (&quot;Osteomeles anthyllidifolia&quot;), &quot;kāmanomano&quot; (&quot;Cenchrus agrimonioides&quot; var. &quot;agrimonioides&quot;), &quot;koaiʻa&quot; (&quot;Acacia koaia&quot;), and &quot;alaheʻe&quot; (&quot;Psydrax odorata&quot;).

In July 2015, a Business Plan for the Restoration of Hawaiian Bird Life and Native Ecosystems on Kaho‘olawe was proposed in partnership with KIRC, Island Conservation, DLNR, The Nature Conservancy, Protect Kaho‘olawe ‘Ohana, HDOA, American Bird Conservancy, and USFWS. The plan outlines the restoration of Kaho‘olawe Island through the removal
of feral cats (&quot;Felis catus&quot;), rats (&quot;Rattus exulans&quot;) and mice (&quot;Mus musculus&quot;). The document investigates and addresses the biological, cultural, financial, and regulatory implications associated with the eradication.

==Traditional subdivisions==
Traditionally, Kahoʻolawe has been an ahupuaʻa of Honuaʻula, one of the twelve &quot;moku&quot; of the island (&quot;mokupuni&quot;) of Maui, and was subdivided into twelve &quot;ʻili&quot; that were later combined to eight. The eight &quot;ʻili&quot; are listed below, in counterclockwise sequence, and original area figures in acres, starting in the northeast:

The boundaries of all but the two westernmost &quot;ʻili&quot; converge on the crater rim of Lua Makika, but do not include it. The crater area of Lua Makika is not considered an &quot;ʻili&quot; and does not belong to any &quot;ʻili&quot;.

According to other sources, the island was subdivided into 16 &quot;ahupuaʻa&quot; that belonged to three &quot;moku&quot;, namely Kona, Ko’olau and Molokini.

<text>Molokai () (Hawaiian: Molokaʻi ) is the fifth most populated of the eight major islands that make up the Hawaiian Islands archipelago in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. It is 38 by 10 miles (61 by 16 km) at its greatest length and width with a usable land area of , making it the fifth-largest in size of the main Hawaiian Islands and the 27th largest island in the United States. It lies southeast of Oʻahu across the wide Kaʻiwi Channel and north of Lānaʻi, separated from it by the Kalohi Channel.

The island&#x27;s agrarian economy has been driven primarily by cattle ranching, pineapple production, sugarcane production and small-scale farming. Tourism comprises a small fraction of the island&#x27;s economy, and much of the infrastructure related to tourism was closed and barricaded in the early 2000s when the primary landowner, Molokai Ranch, ceased operations due to substantial revenue losses. In Kalawao County, on the Kalaupapa Peninsula on the north coast, settlements were established in 1866 for quarantined treatment of persons with leprosy; these operated until 1969. The Kalaupapa National Historical Park now preserves this entire county and area. Several other islands are visible from the shores of Molokai, including Oahu from the west shores; Lanai from the south shores, and Maui from the south and east shores.

==Name==
The island is known under several names by the local population: Molokaʻi ʻĀina Momona (land of abundance), Molokaʻi Pule Oʻo (powerful prayer), and Molokaʻi Nui A Hina (of the goddess Hina). 

Both the form &quot;Molokai&quot; (without an okina) and &quot;Molokai&quot; (with) have long been used by native speakers of Hawaiian, and there is debate as to which is the original form, with conflicting claims as to which the elders used. The USGS uses the form with the ʻokina.

==Geography==

Molokai developed from two distinct shield volcanoes known as East Molokai and the much smaller West Molokai. The highest point is &quot;Kamakou&quot; on East Molokai, at . Today, East Molokai volcano, like the Koʻolau Range on Oʻahu, is what remains of the southern half of the original mountain. The northern half suffered a catastrophic collapse about 1.5 million years ago and now lies as a debris field scattered northward across the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. What remains of the volcano on the island include the highest sea cliffs in the world. The south shore of Molokai boasts the longest fringing reef in the U.S. and its holdings—nearly long.

Molokai is part of the state of Hawaii and located in Maui County, Hawaii, except for the Kalaupapa Peninsula, which is separately administered as Kalawao County. Maui County encompasses Maui, Lanai, and Kahoolawe in addition to Molokai. The largest town on the island is Kaunakakai, which is one of two small ports on the island. Molokai Airport is located on the central plains of Molokai.

The United States Census Bureau divides the island into three census tracts, Census Tract 317 and Census Tract 318 of Maui County and Census Tract 319 of Kalawao County. The total 2010 census population of these was 7,345, living on a land area of . Molokai is separated from Oahu to the northwest by the Molokai Channel, from Maui to the southeast by the Pailolo Channel and from Lanai to the south by the Kalohi Channel.

The Kauhako Crater Lake is a soda lake.

==Ecology==

Molokai is split into two main geographical areas. The low western half is very dry and the soil is heavily denuded due to poor land management practices, which allowed over-grazing by deer and goats. It lacks significant ground cover and virtually the entire section is covered in non-native &quot;kiawe&quot; (&quot;Prosopis pallida&quot;) trees. One of the few natural areas remaining almost intact are the coastal dunes of Moʻomomi, which are part of a Nature Conservancy preserve.

The eastern half of the island is a high plateau rising up to an elevation of on Kamakou peak and includes the Molokai Forest Reserve. The eastern half is covered with lush wet forests that get more than of rain per year. The high-elevation forests are populated by native &quot;ʻōhiʻa lehua&quot; (&quot;Metrosideros polymorpha&quot;) trees and an extremely diverse endemic flora and fauna in the understory. Much of the summit area is protected by the Nature Conservancy&#x27;s Kamakou and Pelekunu valley preserves.

Below , the vegetation is dominated by introduced and invasive flora, including strawberry guava (&quot;Psidium littorale&quot;), eucalyptus (&quot;Eucalyptus&quot; spp.), and cypress (&quot;Cupressus&quot; spp.). Introduced axis deer (&quot;Axis axis&quot;) and feral pigs (&quot;Sus scrofa&quot;) roam native forests, destroying native plants, expanding spreading invasive plants through disturbance and distribution of their seeds, and threatening endemic insects. Near the summit of Kamakou is the unique Pēpēʻōpae bog, where dwarf &quot;ʻōhiʻa&quot; and other plants cover the soggy ground.

Molokai is home to a great number of endemic plant and animal species. However, many of its species, including the &quot;olomaʻo&quot; (&quot;Myadestes lanaiensis&quot;), &quot;kākāwahie&quot; (&quot;Paroreomyza flammea&quot;), and the Bishop&#x27;s ‘ō‘ō (&quot;Moho bishopi&quot;) have become extinct. Molokai is home to a wingless fly among many other endemic insects.

==History==
It used to be thought that Molokai was first settled around AD 650 by indigenous peoples most likely from the Marquesas Islands. However, a 2010 study using revised, high-precision radiocarbon dating based on more reliable samples has established that the period of eastern Polynesian colonization of the Marquesas Islands took place much later, in a shorter time frame of two waves: the &quot;earliest in the Society Islands 1025–1120, four centuries later than previously assumed; then after 70–265 years, dispersal continued in one major pulse to all remaining islands 1190–1290.&quot; Later migrants likely came from Tahiti and other south Pacific islands.

Although Captain James Cook recorded sighting Molokai in 1778, the first European sailor to visit the island was Captain George Dixon of the British Royal Navy in 1786. The first significant European influence came in 1832 when a Protestant mission was established at Kaluaʻaha on the East End of the island by the Reverend Harvey Hitchcock. The first farmer on Molokai to grow, produce and mill sugar and coffee commercially was Rudolph Wilhelm Meyer, an immigrant from Germany who arrived in 1850. He built the first and only sugar mill on the island in 1878, which is now a museum.

Ranching began on Molokai in the first half of the 19th century when King Kamehameha V set up a country estate on the island, which was managed by Meyer and became what is now the Molokai Ranch. In the late 1800s, Kamehameha V built a vacation home in Kaunakakai and ordered the planting of over 1,000 coconut trees in Kapuaiwa Coconut Grove.

===Leper colony===
Leprosy (also known as Hansen&#x27;s disease) was among Eurasian diseases introduced to the Hawaiian islands by traders, sailors, workers and others who lived in societies where these diseases were endemic. Because of the islanders&#x27; lack of immunity to the new diseases, they suffered high rates of infection and death from smallpox, cholera, measles and whooping cough, as well as leprosy. Sugar planters were worried about the effects on their labor force and pressured the government to take action to control the spread of leprosy.
The legislature passed a control act requiring quarantine of people with leprosy. The government established Kalawao located on the isolated Kalaupapa peninsula on the northern side of Molokai, followed by Kalaupapa as the sites of a leper colony that operated from 1866 to 1969. Because Kalaupapa had a better climate and sea access, it developed as the main community. A research hospital was developed at Kalawao. The population of these settlements reached a peak of 1,100 shortly after the beginning of the 20th century.

In total over the decades, more than 8,500 men, women and children living throughout the Hawaiian islands and diagnosed with leprosy were exiled to the colony by the Hawaiian government and legally declared dead. This public health measure was continued after the Kingdom became a U.S. territory. Patients were not allowed to leave the settlement nor have visitors and had to live out their days here. 

Arthur Albert St. Mouritz served as a physician to the leper settlement from 1884 to 1887. He explained how leprosy was spread.
Pater Damiaan de Veuster, a Belgian priest of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary served as a missionary for 16 years in the communities of sufferers of leprosy. Joseph Dutton, who served in the 13th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment during the American Civil War and converted to Roman Catholicism in 1883, came to Molokai in 1886 to help Pater Damiaan and the rest of the population who suffered from leprosy. Pater Damiaan died at Kalaupapa in 1889 while Joseph Dutton died in Honolulu in 1931 at the age of 87. Mother Marianne Cope of the Sisters of Saint Francis of Syracuse, New York, brought six of her Sisters to work in Hawaiʻi with leprosy sufferers in the late 19th century, also serving on Molokai.

Both Father Damiaan and Mother Marianne have been canonized as Saints by the Roman Catholic Church for their charitable work and devotion to sufferers of leprosy. In December 2015, the cause of Joseph Dutton was formally opened, obtaining him the title Servant of God.

In the 1920s, people confined in the leper colony were treated with a new method devised by Alice Ball and involving chaulmoogra oil. In the 1940s, sulfonamide drugs were developed and provided a more effective treatment. Antibiotic Dapsone has been used for leprosy since 1945. Modern Multidrug therapy (MDT) remains highly effective, and people are no longer infectious after the first monthly dose.

In 1969, the century-old laws of forced quarantine were abolished. Former patients living in Kalaupapa today have chosen to remain here, most for the rest of their lives. In the 21st century, there are no persons on the island with active cases of leprosy, which has been controlled through medication, but some former patients chose to continue to live in the settlement after its official closure.

==Economy==
Over the years Molokai Ranch has also acted as a developer, establishing hotels and related amenities for resort tourists on their property. The local indigenous community fought for many decades to inhibit the development by Molokai Ranch in order to preserve their community and unique way of life. In some cases, protests have become violent, such as fence cutting, poisoning of the Ranch&#x27;s exotic African Safari animals in 1994, an arson attack in Kaupoa in 1995, and the destruction of of Ranch water pipes in 1996.

In 2007, community residents organized the &quot;Save Laʻau Point&quot; movement to oppose Molokai Ranch&#x27;s attempt to expand its resort operation. As a result, on March 24, 2008, Molokai Ranch, then the island&#x27;s largest employer, decided to shut down all resort operations, including hotels, movie theater, restaurants, and golf course, and dismiss 120 workers. In September 2017 the company that owns Molokai Ranch, Singapore-based Guoco Leisure Ltd, put this property, encompassing 35% of the island of Molokai, on the market for $260 million.

Due to the fight against development and tourism, Molokai has Hawaii&#x27;s highest unemployment rate. The residents have fought hard to maintain a lifestyle based on indigenous subsistence practices. This lifestyle is not without challenges, however, and many live below the federal poverty line. One third of its residents use food stamps. , the largest industry on the island is seed production for Monsanto and Mycogen Seeds, including GMO seeds.

===Tourism===
The tourism industry on Molokai is relatively small, compared to the other islands in Hawaiʻi. Only 64,767 tourists visited Molokai in 2015. For decades, residents of Molokai have resisted private developers&#x27; attempts to increase tourism because of the irreparable changes to community and culture that are associated with a tourism industry. Accommodations are limited; as of 2014, only one hotel was open on the island. Most tourists find lodgings at rental condos and houses.

&quot;National Geographic Traveler&quot; magazine and the National Geographic Center for Sustainable Destinations conduct annual Destination Scorecard surveys, aided by George Washington University. In 2007, a panel of 522 experts in sustainable tourism and destination stewardship reviewed 111 selected human-inhabited islands and archipelagos around the world. Molokai ranked 10th among the 111 destination locales. The survey cited Molokai&#x27;s undeveloped tropical landscape, environmental stewardship, and rich, deep Hawaiian traditions (the island&#x27;s &quot;mana&quot;). The neighbor islands of Hawaii, Kauai, Maui and Oahu, ranked 50, 61, 81 and 104, respectively.

Molokai is believed to be the birthplace of the hula. The annual Molokaʻi Ka Hula Piko festival is held on this island.

Molokai can be reached by plane. Planes fly into Molokaʻi daily from other Hawaiian islands including Oʻahu (Honolulu and Kalaeloa), Maui (Kahului) and Hawaii (Kona), operated by Mokulele Airlines, Paragon Air and Hawaiian Airlines.

A ferry that formerly sailed between Molokai and Lāhainā Harbor, Maui closed operations on October 27, 2016. Sea Link President and Senior Capt. Dave Jung attributed the closure to competition from federally subsidized commuter air travel and declining ridership.

==Infrastructure==
===Health care===
The island of Molokai is served by Molokaʻi General Hospital, which operates all day, every day. It is also serviced by Molokai Community Health Center and Molokai Family Health Center.

===Education===
The island public school system includes four elementary schools, one charter school, one middle school, and one high school. There is also a community college. The island has one private middle/high school.

===Parks===

The island contains many parks and other protected areas, but most parks do not have service staff, potable water, or restroom facilities. Parks within the Maui County parks jurisdiction include Palaʻau State Park, Kiowea Beach Park, Kakahaiʻa National Wildlife Refuge, Molokaʻi Forest Reserve, Pelekunu Preserve, George Murphy Beach Park, Hālawa Beach Park, and Papohaku Beach Park (with a beach) in the portion within Maui County. Today Kalawao County is preserved by the Kalaupapa National Historical Park (accessible by guided mule or hiking tour).

==Transportation==
===Highways===
The island can be traversed by a two-lane highway running east to west (highways 450 and 460). Highway 470 is a spur up to the barrier mountains of Kalawao County and the Kalaupapa peninsula. By land this area (Kalaupapa) can only be reached by a hiking trail. Mule rides on the trail were suspended in 2018 when the trail temporarily closed due to a landslide and bridge damage. Most access to the Kalaupapa peninsula is by sea.

===Bus===
Maui Economic Opportunity operates public transportation on Molokai.

<doc id="194718" wikidata="Q4752854" url="?curid=194718" title="Ancient Hawaiian aquaculture">
<text>Before contact with Europeans, the Hawaiian people practiced aquaculture through development of fish ponds (), the most advanced fish-husbandry among the original peoples of the Pacific. While other cultures in places like Egypt and China also used the practice, Hawaii&#x27;s aquaculture was very advanced considering the much smaller size of the area of Hawaii compared to other aquacultural societies. Hawaiian fishponds were typically shallow areas of a reef flat surrounded by a low lava rock wall () built out from the shore. Several species of edible fish (such as mullet) thrive in such ponds, and Hawaiians developed methods to make them easy to catch.
The Hawaiian fishpond was primarily a grazing area in which the fishpond-keeper cultivated algae; much in the way cattle ranchers cultivate grass for their cattle. The porous lava walls let in seawater (or sometimes fresh or brackish water, as in the case of the &quot;Menehune&quot; fishpond near Līhue, Kauai), but prevent the fish from escaping. Fishponds were located next to the mouth of a stream, so by opening a sluice gate the pondkeeper provided the fish with water rich in nutrients that had passed through inland, terraced pondfields and returned to the stream. At the time of Captain James Cook&#x27;s arrival, there were at least 360 fishponds producing of fish per year.

== Types of fishponds ==
There were four basic types of fishponds developed within the Ahupua&#x27;a known in ancient Hawaii. The four types of fishponds were freshwater taro fishponds (loko i&#x27;a kalo), other freshwater ponds (loko wai), brackish water ponds (loko pu&#x27;unone), and seawater ponds (loko kuapa).

Taro fishponds (loko i&#x27;a kalo) were usually seen inland and were used to cultivate Taro as well as grow fish, such as mullet, silver perch, Hawaiian gobies, Freshwater prawn, and green algae. Taro fish ponds were usually located close to the sea and contained surplus of fish. Fish were also able to directly enter the taro patch-fishponds from the sea through newly created artificial estuary. Fish in these ponds thrived and were able to survive the transition from seawater to freshwater. They also helped the taro in these ponds by feeding on insects and ripe leaf stems of taro. The taro would help prevent silt by catching it before it would go downstream into the ocean. Planting between the wetland areas would also help provide green manure, medicines and other products.

Loko wai are other freshwater ponds that are seen inland and usually were excavated by hand from natural depressions like lakes or ponds and were supplied from naturally created water supplies (i.e., streams, rivers, springs, etc.). These ponds contained native species of freshwater prawn and fishes that migrate from the sea and into freshwater (i.e., mullet, milkfish. etc.). Fishes in these ponds were often harvested when spawning fish moved seaward, usually during full moons in the spring. 

Brackish water ponds (loko pu&#x27;unone) were seen very close to the ocean and excavated by hand from natural bodies of water that have been stranded by sea-level change, or by creating an earth embankment with mud, sand, and coral. This made a wall that separated the pond from the ocean. However, these ponds were still connected to the ocean via small canals which would allow seawater fish to enter the fishpond during the rising tide. These brackish-water ponds were very productive and were filled with many different types of species. 

According to B.A. Costa-Pierce, seawater ponds were the &quot;ultimate aquaculture achievement of native Hawaiians and a valuable contribution to native engineering and subsistence food production.&quot; These ponds were constructed by a seawall, usually made of coral or lava rocks, with lengths of these walls ranging from . Coralline algae was gathered and used as a natural cement to hold and strengthen the walls. These ponds were very diverse, usually containing about 22 species of marine life. One of the most important features of these ponds were canals that was connected directly to the sea and had a grate made of wood and ferns that sat in the middle of these canals. These innovative grates allowed for very small fish to enter the pond and prevented bigger and mature fish from leaving. Harvesting timing and methods were usually determined by the behavior of the fish. For example, during migration seasons for fishes such as milkfish and mullet that migrate to the ocean to spawn, keepers of the fishpond would set out nets on the pond side of the grates and watch as the fishes trapped themselves as they tried to reach the sea. 

==Restoration==
Several fishponds have been restored in recent years. Although fishponds were developed on most islands, the largest number were found in Keehi Lagoon, Pearl Harbor, Maunalua Bay (known as the largest on Oahu prior to it being filled for housing development), and Kāneohe Bay on Oahu, and along nearly the entire south shore of Molokai. Few remain today, although Molokai offers the best opportunities to view a Hawaiian .

Three different styles of fish ponds are being reconstructed at the Kaloko-Honokōhau National Historical Park on the Big Island of Hawaii. The non-profit is restoring Kalepolepo Fishpond also known as Koie - i.e. in Kīhei on Maui - using a mixture of volunteers and skilled stonemasons. On Oahu, the private non-profit organization (&quot;Threshold of Heʻeia&quot;) is rehabilitating the roughly 600-to–800-year-old Heeia Fishpond, which is a walled (&quot;kuapa&quot;-style) enclosure in Heʻeia covering of brackish water. The Kāneiolouma Complex, an ancient village on the south shore of the island of Kauai, has a fishpond within the that includes taro patches, heiau, and a makahiki sporting arena.

These fishponds have been found to increase overall fish stocks in nearby waters, serving as a nursery that protects fish from predators.

<text>Marquess of Salisbury is a title in the Peerage of Great Britain, held by a branch of the Cecil family. It was created in 1789 for the 7th Earl of Salisbury. Most of the holders of the title have been prominent in British political life over the last two centuries, particularly the 3rd Marquess, who served three times as Prime Minister in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

== Background ==

This branch of the Cecil family descends from Sir Robert Cecil, the son of Elizabeth I&#x27;s chief minister William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, from his second marriage, to Mildred Cooke. His elder half-brother the 2nd Baron Burghley was created Earl of Exeter in 1605 and is the ancestor of the Marquesses of Exeter. Cecil notably served under Elizabeth and later King James I as Secretary of State, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Lord Privy Seal and Lord High Treasurer. In 1603 he was raised to the Peerage of England as Baron Cecil, of Essendon in the County of Rutland, and the following year he was created Viscount Cranborne. In 1605 he was further created Earl of Salisbury. The last two titles were also in the Peerage of England.

The Earl of Salisbury was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. He represented Weymouth in the House of Commons and also served as Captain of the Honourable Band of Gentlemen Pensioners and as Lord Lieutenant of Hertfordshire and Dorsetshire. His great-grandson, the fourth Earl, converted to Roman Catholicism and in 1689 the House of Commons decided to impeach him for high treason. However, the charges were not brought any further and he was succeeded by his son, the fifth Earl, Lord Lieutenant of Hertfordshire.

== History ==

The seventh Earl was a politician and served as Lord Chamberlain of the Household for many years. In 1789, he was created Marquess of Salisbury in the Peerage of Great Britain.

He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second marquess. He was a Conservative politician and held office as Lord Privy Seal and Lord President of the Council. Lord Salisbury married as his first wife Frances Mary Gascoyne, daughter of Bamber Gascoyne, in 1821. The same year he assumed by royal licence the additional surname of Gascoyne.

He was succeeded by his third but eldest surviving son, the third marquess. The third marquess was Prime Minister three times, from 1885 to 1886, 1886 to 1892 and 1895 to 1902 and also served four times as foreign secretary. His time as Prime Minister coincided with a great expansion of the British Empire. Lord Salisbury is also remembered as an adherent of the policy of &quot;splendid isolation&quot;, the desire to keep Great Britain out of European affairs and alliances. He was also &quot;the last Prime Minister to lead a government from the Lords&quot;. Salisbury was offered a dukedom by Queen Victoria in 1886 and 1892, but declined both offers, citing the prohibitive cost of the lifestyle dukes were expected to maintain.

He was succeeded by his eldest son, the fourth marquess. The fourth marquess was also an influential Conservative politician and served as Lord Privy Seal, as President of the Board of Trade, as Lord President of the Council, as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and as Leader of the House of Lords. Like his father he was regarded as a staunch Conservative and bitterly opposed the Parliament Act 1911, which sought to curtail the powers of the House of Lords.

His eldest son, the fifth marquess, was also a Conservative politician. In 1941 he was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father&#x27;s junior title of Baron Cecil. During his career Lord Salisbury notably held office as Paymaster General, Secretary of State for the Dominions, Secretary of State for the Colonies, Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the House of Lords. He was an opponent of attempts to reform the House of Lords but was forced to see the Parliament Act 1949 even further limit the power of the House of Lords. However, Lord Salisbury was also behind the Salisbury Convention of 1945, which states that the House of Lords shall not oppose the second reading of any government legislation promised in its election manifesto.

The fifth Marquess was succeeded by his eldest son, the sixth marquess. Although he briefly represented Bournemouth West in Parliament he did not take such an active role in national politics as his predecessors.

As of 2012, the titles are held by the sixth marquess&#x27;s eldest son, the seventh Marquess, who succeeded in 2003. The seventh marquess is also a Conservative politician. After representing South Dorset in the House of Commons, he was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father&#x27;s junior title of Baron Cecil in 1992 (the last time a writ of acceleration was issued). Lord Salisbury then served under his close political ally John Major as Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the House of Lords from 1994 to 1997. As Leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords after 1997, he played a leading role in negotiating the terms of the House of Lords Act 1999, in which the automatic right of hereditary peers to sit in the upper chamber of Parliament was abolished. Salisbury managed to obtain a compromise with the Labour government of Tony Blair, whereby 92 selected hereditary peers were allowed to remain on an interim basis. However, the compromise was agreed without the knowledge of Conservative leader William Hague and Salisbury was dismissed as Conservative Leader in the House of Lords. The same year, along with all former Leaders of the House of Lords, he was given a life peerage as Baron Gascoyne-Cecil, of Essendon in the County of Rutland, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, so that he could remain a member of the House of Lords. He continued to sit under his life peerage until 8 June 2017, when he retired from the House under Section 1 of the House of Lords Reform Act 2014.

Several other members of the Cecil family have gained distinction. Lord Eustace Cecil, fourth son of the second Marquess, was a Lieutenant-Colonel in the Army and Member of Parliament. His son Evelyn Cecil was a Conservative politician and was created Baron Rockley in 1934. The Right Reverend Lord William Gascoyne-Cecil, Bishop of Exeter; Robert Cecil, 1st Viscount Cecil of Chelwood; Lord Edward Cecil; and Hugh Cecil, 1st Baron Quickswood; were all younger sons of the third Marquess. Lord David Cecil, Professor of English Literature at the University of Oxford, was the second son of the fourth Marquess, while the journalist Lord Richard Cecil was the second son of the sixth Marquess. Also, Lady Blanche Gascoyne-Cecil, daughter of the second Marquess, was the mother of Prime Minister Arthur Balfour, 1st Earl of Balfour.
The family seats are Hatfield House and Cranborne Manor. The traditional burial place of the marquesses is the Salisbury Chapel in St Etheldreda Church, Hatfield, Hertfordshire. The 6th Marquess had holdings of 8,500 acres around Hatfield House, and 1,300 acres at Cranborne Manor, Dorset. At the time of his obituary he owned property around Leicester and Leicester Square, London, held by Gascoyne Holdings.

All the marquesses, except the 6th marquess, have been appointed as Knights Companion of the Order of the Garter.

==Family tree==

The Cecils are descended from Sir David Cecil (c. 1460 – 1540), a Welsh landowner, courtier, and Member of Parliament. He was born into a Welsh family, the third son of Richard Cecil ap Philip Seisyllt of Alt-yr-Ynys on the border of Herefordshire and Monmouthshire but settled near Stamford, Lincolnshire. The spelling of the family name as Seisyllt is still similar to how the name is pronounced, Sissill.
