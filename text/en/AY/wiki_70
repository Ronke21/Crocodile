<text>The Symphony No. 6 in A minor by Gustav Mahler is a symphony in four movements, composed in 1903 and 1904, with revisions from 1906. It is sometimes nicknamed the Tragic (&quot;Tragische&quot;), though the origin of the name is unclear.

==Introduction==
Mahler conducted the work&#x27;s first performance at the Saalbau concert hall in Essen on 27 May 1906. Mahler composed the symphony at an exceptionally happy time in his life, as he had married Alma Schindler in 1902, and during the course of the work&#x27;s composition his second daughter was born. This contrasts with the tragic, even nihilistic, ending of No. 6. Both Alban Berg and Anton Webern praised the work when they first heard it. Berg expressed his opinion of the stature of this symphony in a 1908 letter to Webern:

== Nickname of &quot;Tragische&quot; ==
The status of the symphony&#x27;s nickname is problematic. Mahler did not title the symphony when he composed it, or at its first performance or first publication. When he allowed Richard Specht to analyse the work and Alexander von Zemlinsky to arrange the symphony, he did not authorize any sort of nickname for the symphony. He had, as well, decisively rejected and disavowed the titles (and programmes) of his earlier symphonies by 1900. Only the words &quot;&#x27;&quot; appeared on the programme for the performance in Munich on November 8, 1906. Nor does the word &#x27; appear on any of the scores that published (first edition, 1906; revised edition, 1906), in Specht&#x27;s officially approved &quot;&quot; (&#x27;thematic guide&#x27;) or on Zemlinsky&#x27;s piano duet transcription (1906). By contrast, in his &quot;Gustav Mahler&quot; memoir, Bruno Walter claimed that &quot;Mahler called [the work] his &quot;Tragic Symphony&quot;. Additionally, the programme for the first Vienna performance (January 4, 1907) refers to the work as &quot;.

Although not using the title, Alma Mahler&#x27;s famous statement has influenced the association of the symphony with tragedy: “in the last movement, Mahler described himself and his downfall, or as he later said, that of his hero. ‘It is the hero on whom fall three blows of fate, the last of which fells him, as a tree is felled.’ Those were his words.”

== Instrumentation ==
The symphony is scored for large orchestra, consisting of the following:

;Woodwinds
: piccolo (used only in movement 4)
: 4 flutes (3rd and 4th doubling 2nd and 3rd piccolos)
: 4 oboes (3rd and 4th doubling 2nd and 3rd cor anglais; 2nd cor anglais used only in Scherzo)
: cor anglais (used only in movement 4)
: E clarinet (doubling 4th clarinet)
: 3 B and A clarinets
: bass clarinet
: 4 bassoons (4th used only in movement 4)
: contrabassoon

;Brass
: 8 horns
: 6 trumpets (5th and 6th used only in movement 4)
: 4 trombones (4th used only in movement 4)
: tuba

;Keyboards
: celesta

;Percussion
: 6 timpani (two players)
: bass drum
: snare drum (used in movements 1 and 4)
: cymbals
: triangle
: cowbells (offstage in movements 1 and 4, onstage in Andante)
: hammer (see description below)
: tam-tam
: rute
: deep, untuned bells (used only in movement 4, offstage)
: glockenspiel
: xylophone

; Strings
: 2 harps
: 1st violins
: 2nd violins
: violas
: cellos
: double basses

Mahler requested that the celesta part should be doubled or tripled if possible. The number of harps specified is ambiguous, with Mahler calling for two in his list of instruments, but at one point calling for four harps in the score.

In addition to very large woodwind and brass sections, Mahler augmented the percussion section with several unusual instruments, including the famous &quot;Mahler hammer&quot;. The sound of the hammer, which features in the last movement, was stipulated by Mahler to be &quot;brief and mighty, but dull in resonance and with a non-metallic character (like the fall of an axe).&quot; The sound achieved in the premiere did not quite carry far enough from the stage, and indeed the problem of achieving the proper volume while still remaining dull in resonance remains a challenge to the modern orchestra. Various methods of producing the sound have involved a wooden mallet striking a wooden surface, a sledgehammer striking a wooden box, or a particularly large bass drum, or sometimes simultaneous use of more than one of these methods. Contemporaries mocked the use of the hammer, as shown by a caricature from the satirical magazine &quot;&quot;.

== Structure ==
The work is in four movements and has a duration of around 80 minutes. The order of the inner movements has been a matter of controversy. The first published edition of the score (C. F. Kahnt, 1906) featured the movements in the following order:

Mahler later placed the &quot;Andante&quot; as the second movement, and this new order of the inner movements was reflected in the second and third published editions of the score, as well as the Essen premiere.
The first three movements are relatively traditional in structure and character, with a standard sonata form first movement (even including an exact repeat of the exposition, unusual in Mahler) leading to the middle movements – one a scherzo-with-trios, the other slow. However, attempts to analyze the vast finale in terms of the sonata archetype have encountered serious difficulties. As Dika Newlin has pointed out:
===I. &quot;Allegro energico, ma non troppo. Heftig, aber markig.&quot;===
The first movement, which for the most part has the character of a march, features a motif consisting of an A major triad turning to A minor over a distinctive timpani rhythm. The chords are played by trumpets and oboes when first heard, with the trumpets sounding the loudest in the first chord and the oboes in the second.
This motif reappears in subsequent movements. The first movement also features a soaring melody which the composer&#x27;s wife, Alma Mahler, claimed represented her. This melody is often called the &quot;Alma theme&quot;. A restatement of that theme at the movement&#x27;s end marks the happiest point of the symphony.

&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&quot; { \clef treble \key f \major \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 \partial 8*3 a&#x27;8(\f\&lt; bes c)\! | \slashedGrace { a,( } d&#x27;4.)(\ff^&quot;Schwungvoll&quot; c8) \slashedGrace { bes,( } bes&#x27;\sf)([ g\sf) e8. d16] | d4\sf( c) } &lt;/score&gt;

===II. &quot;Scherzo: Wuchtig&quot;===
The scherzo marks a return to the unrelenting march rhythms of the first movement, though in a &#x27;triple-time&#x27; metrical context.

&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; { \new PianoStaff « \new Staff \relative c&#x27; { \clef treble \time 3/8 \key a \minor \tempo &quot;Wuchtig&quot; \partial 8*1 s8 | s4. | r8 r8 \grace { b16([ d] } a&#x27;\ff)[ r32 gis] | a16[ r32 gis a16 r32 gis a16 r32 gis] | a16[ r32 gis a16 r32 gis a16 r32 gis] | \grace { a16([ b] } c8\sf)([ a16)] r } \new Staff \relative c { \clef bass \time 3/8 \key a \minor a8[\sf | a a] a[\sf | a a] a[\sf | a a] a[\sf | a a] a[\sf | a a] } » } &lt;/score&gt;
Its trio (the middle section), marked &quot;Altväterisch&quot; (&#x27;old-fashioned&#x27;), is rhythmically irregular ( switching to and ) and of a somewhat gentler character.

&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&quot; { \clef treble \key f \major \time 3/8 \partial 8*1 c8\f-. | c\&gt;-. c-. c-.\! | \time 4/8 a(\p c16 a f8-&gt;)\breathe c&#x27; | \time 3/8 c-.\&lt; c-. c-.\! | \time 4/8 bes16( c a bes g8)-.\breathe } &lt;/score&gt;

According to Alma Mahler, in this movement Mahler &quot;represented the unrhythmical games of the two little children, tottering in zigzags over the sand&quot;. The chronology of its composition suggests otherwise. The movement was composed in the summer of 1903, when Maria Anna (born November 1902) was less than a year old. Anna Justine was born a year later in June 1904.

===III. &quot;Andante moderato&quot;===
The andante provides a respite from the intensity of the rest of the work. Its main theme is an introspective ten-bar phrase in E major, though it frequently touches on the minor mode as well. The orchestration is more delicate and reserved in this movement, making it all the more poignant when compared to the other three.

&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&#x27; { \clef treble \key ees \major \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 \tempo &quot;Andante moderato&quot; \partial 4*1 ees8\pp( f) | g4( ees&#x27;8 g,) aes( fes) ees-- d-- | ees2( bes4) d!8( ees) | f!4.--( f8--) f([ ges16 f ees8 f)] | ges2. } &lt;/score&gt;

===IV. &quot;Finale: Sostenuto – Allegro moderato – Allegro energico&quot;===

The last movement is an extended sonata form with an introduction and coda, characterized by drastic changes in mood and tempo, the sudden change of glorious soaring melody to deep agony.

&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&quot; { \clef treble \time 2/2 \key c \minor c2\f c&#x27;~\&gt; | c4 b\!-- c-- d-- | ees4.\&lt; f8 aes2~\! | aes4( ges) ees-- c-- | bes( aes) f&#x27;-- ees-- | c--_\markup{\italic &quot;dim.&quot;} aes-- ees-- c-- } &lt;/score&gt;

The movement is punctuated by two hammer blows. The original score had five hammer blows, which Mahler subsequently reduced to three, and eventually to two.

&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; « \new Staff \relative c&#x27; { \clef bass \time 2/2 \key bes \major bes1\ff-&gt; | bes,2.-&gt; aes4-&gt; | g1-&gt; } \new RhythmicStaff { \clef bass b4_&quot;Hammer&quot;\ff r4 r2 | r1 | r1 } » &lt;/score&gt;

Alma quoted her husband as saying that these were three mighty blows of fate befallen by the hero, &quot;the third of which fells him like a tree&quot;. She identified these blows with three later events in Gustav Mahler&#x27;s own life: the death of his eldest daughter Maria Anna Mahler, the diagnosis of an eventually fatal heart condition, and his forced resignation from the Vienna Opera and departure from Vienna. When he revised the work, Mahler removed the last of these three hammer strokes so that the music built to a sudden moment of stillness in place of the third blow. Some recordings and performances, notably those of Leonard Bernstein, have restored the third hammer blow. The piece ends with the same rhythmic motif that appeared in the first movement, but the chord above it is a simple A minor triad, rather than A major turning into A minor. After the third &#x27;hammer-blow&#x27; passage, the music gropes in darkness and then the trombones and horns begin to offer consolation. However, after they turn briefly to major they fade away and the final bars erupt in the minor.

== Order of the inner movements and performance history issue ==
===Initial history===
Controversy exists over the order of the two middle movements. Mahler conceived the work as having the scherzo second and the slow movement third, a somewhat unclassical arrangement adumbrated in such earlier large-scale symphonies as Beethoven&#x27;s No. 9, Bruckner&#x27;s No. 8 and (unfinished) No. 9, and Mahler&#x27;s own four-movement No. 1 and No. 4. It was in this arrangement that the symphony was completed (in 1904) and published (in March 1906); and it was with a conducting score in which the scherzo preceded the slow movement that Mahler began rehearsals for the work&#x27;s first performance, as noted by Mahler biographer Henry-Louis de La Grange:

&quot;Scherzo 2&quot; was undeniably the original order, the one in which Mahler first conceived, composed, and published the Sixth Symphony, and also the one in which he rehearsed the work with two different orchestras before changing his mind at the last minute before the premiere.

Alfred Roller, a close collaborator and colleague of Mahler&#x27;s in Vienna, communicated in a 2 May 1906 letter to his fiancée Mileva Stojsavljevic, on the Mahlers&#x27; reaction to the 1 May 1906 orchestral rehearsal of the work in Vienna, in its original movement order:

Today I was there at noon, but I could not talk much with Alma, since M[ahler] was almost always there, I saw only that the two of them were very happy and satisfied...

During those later May 1906 rehearsals in Essen, however, Mahler decided that the slow movement should precede the scherzo. Klaus Pringsheim, another colleague of Mahler&#x27;s at the Hofoper, reminisced in a 1920 article on the situation at the Essen rehearsals, on Mahler&#x27;s state of mind at the time:

Mahler instructed his publishers to prepare a &quot;second edition&quot; of the work with the movements in that order, and meanwhile to insert errata slips indicating the change of order into all unsold copies of the existing edition. Mahler conducted the 27 May 1906 public premiere, and his other two subsequent performances of the Sixth Symphony, in November 1906 (Munich) and 4 January 1907 (Vienna) with his revised order of the inner movements. In the period immediately after Mahler&#x27;s death, scholars such as Paul Bekker, Ernst Decsey, Richard Specht, and Paul Stefan published studies with reference to the Sixth Symphony in Mahler&#x27;s second edition with the Andante/Scherzo order.

===History from 1911 to 1960===
One of the first occasions after Mahler&#x27;s death where the conductor reverted to the original movement order is in 1919/1920, after an inquiry in the autumn of 1919 from Willem Mengelberg to Alma Mahler in preparation for the May 1920 Mahler Festival in Amsterdam of the complete symphonies, regarding the order of the inner movements of the Sixth Symphony. In a telegram dated 1 October 1919, Alma responded to Mengelberg:

Mengelberg, who had been in close touch with Mahler until the latter&#x27;s death, and had conducted the symphony in the &quot;Andante/Scherzo&quot; arrangement up to 1916, then switched to the &quot;Scherzo/Andante&quot; order. In his own copy of the score, he wrote on the first page:

Other conductors, such as Oskar Fried, continued to perform (and eventually record) the work as &#x27;Andante/Scherzo&#x27;, per the second edition, right up to the early 1960s. Exceptions included two performances in Vienna on 14 December 1930 and 23 May 1933, conducted by Anton Webern, who utilised the Scherzo/Andante order of the inner movements. Anna Mahler, Mahler&#x27;s daughter, attended both of these performances. De La Grange commented on Webern&#x27;s choice of the Scherzo/Andante order:

===Erwin Ratz edition (1963-2000&#x27;s)===
In 1963, a new critical edition of the Sixth Symphony appeared, under the auspices of the &quot;Internationale Gustav Mahler Gesellschaft&quot; (IGMG) and its president, Erwin Ratz, a pupil of Webern, an edition which restored Mahler&#x27;s original order of the inner movements. Ratz, however, did not offer documented support, such as Alma Mahler&#x27;s 1919 telegram, for his assertion that Mahler &quot;changed his mind a second time&quot; at some point before his death. In his analysis of the Sixth Symphony, Norman Del Mar argued for the &quot;Andante&quot;/&quot;Scherzo&quot; order of the inner movements, and criticised the Ratz edition for its lack of documentary evidence to justify the &quot;Scherzo&quot;/&quot;Andante&quot; order. In contrast, scholars such as Theodor W. Adorno, Henry-Louis de La Grange, Hans-Peter Jülg and Karl Heinz Füssl have argued for the original order as more appropriate, expostulating on the overall tonal scheme and the various relationships between the keys in the final three movements. Füssl, in particular, noted that Ratz made his decision under historical circumstances where the history of the different autographs and versions was not completely known at the time. Füssl has also noted the following features of the &quot;Scherzo&quot;/&quot;Andante&quot; order:
* The Scherzo is an example of &#x27;developing variation&#x27; in its treatment of material from the first movement, where separation of the Scherzo from the first movement by the Andante disrupts that linkage.
* The Scherzo and the first movement use identical keys, A minor at the beginning and F major in the trio.
* The Andante&#x27;s key, E major, is farthest removed from the key at the close of the first movement (A major), whilst the C minor key at the beginning of the finale acts as transition from E major to A minor, the principal key of the finale.

The 1968 Eulenberg Edition of the Sixth Symphony, edited by Hans Redlich, restores most of Mahler&#x27;s original orchestration and utilises the original order of Scherzo/Andante for the order of the middle movements.

===Kubik edition (2010-present)===
The most recent IGMG critical edition of the Sixth Symphony was published in 2010, under the general editorship of Reinhold Kubik, and uses the Andante/Scherzo order for the middle movements. Kubik had previously declared in 2004:

: &quot;As the current Chief Editor of the Complete Critical Edition, I declare the official position of the institution I represent is that the correct order of the middle movements of Mahler&#x27;s Sixth Symphony is Andante-Scherzo.&quot;

This statement has been criticised, in the manner of earlier criticism of Ratz, on several levels:
* for itself lacking documentary support and for expressing a personal preference based on subjective animus related to the Alma Problem, rather than any actual documentary evidence
* for its blanket dismissal of the evidence of the original score with the Scherzo/Andante order
* for imposing an advance bias rather than allowing musicians to arrive at their own choice independently.

===Discussion on availability of both options===
British composer David Matthews was a former adherent of the &quot;Andante&quot;/&quot;Scherzo&quot; order, but has since changed his mind and now argues for &quot;Scherzo&quot;/&quot;Andante&quot; as the preferred order, again citing the overall tonal scheme of the symphony. In keeping with Mahler&#x27;s original order, British conductor John Carewe has noted parallels between the tonal plan of Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 7 and Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 6, with the &quot;Scherzo&quot;/&quot;Andante&quot; order of movements in the latter. David Matthews has noted the interconnectivity of the first movement with the &quot;Scherzo&quot; as similar to Mahler&#x27;s interconnectivity of the first two movements of the Fifth Symphony, and that performing the Mahler with the &quot;Andante&quot;/&quot;Scherzo&quot; order would damage the structure of the tonal key relationships and remove this parallel, a structural disruption of what de La Grange has described as follows:

&quot;...that very idea which many listeners today consider one of the most audacious and brilliant ever conceived by Mahler –: the linking of two movements – one in quadruple, the other in triple time – with more or less the same thematic material&quot;

Moreover, de La Grange, referring to the 1919 Mengelberg telegram, has questioned the notion of Alma simply expressing a personal view of the movement order, and reiterates the historical fact of the original movement order:

&lt;poem&gt;&quot;The fact that the initial order had the composer&#x27;s stamp of approval for two whole years prior to the premiere argues for further performances in that form...

&quot;It is far more likely ten years after Mahler&#x27;s death and with a much clearer perspective on his life and career, Alma would have sought to be faithful to his artistic intentions. Thus, her telegram of 1919 still remains a strong argument today in favour of Mahler&#x27;s original order...it is stretching the bounds of both language and reason to describe [Andante-Scherzo] as the &quot;only correct&quot; one. Mahler&#x27;s Sixth Symphony, like many other compositions in the repertory, will always remain a &quot;dual-version&quot; work, but few of the others have attracted quite as much controversy.&quot; &lt;/poem&gt;

De La Grange has noted the justification of having both options available for conductors to choose:

&quot;...given that Mahler changed his mind so many times, it is understandable that a conductor might nowadays wish to stand by the order in the second version, if he is deeply convinced that he can serve the work better by doing this.&quot; 

Mahler scholar Donald Mitchell echoed the dual-version scenario and the need for the availability of both options:

&quot;I believe that all serious students of his music should make up their own minds about which order in their view represents Mahler&#x27;s genius. He was after all in two minds about it himself. We should let the music – how we hear it – decide! For me there is no right or wrong in this matter. We should continue to hear, quite legitimately, both versions of the symphony, according to the convictions of the interpreters involved. After all the first version has a fascinating history and legitimacy endowed by none other than the composer himself! Of course we must respect the fact of his final change of mind but to imagine that we should accept this without debate or comment beggars belief.&quot;

Matthews, Paul Banks and scholar Warren Darcy (the last an advocate for the &quot;Andante&quot;/&quot;Scherzo&quot; order) have independently proposed the idea of two separate editions of the symphony, one to accommodate each version of the order of the inner movements. Music commentator David Hurwitz has likewise remarked:

&quot;So as far as the facts go, then, we have on the one hand what Mahler actually did when he last performed the symphony, and on the other hand, what he originally composed and what his wife reported that he ultimately wanted. Any objective observer would be compelled to admit that this constitutes strong evidence for both perspectives. This being the case, the responsible thing to do in revisiting the need for a new Critical Edition would be to set out all of the arguments on each side, and then &quot;take no position&quot;. Let the performers decide, and admit frankly that if the criterion for making a decision regarding the correct order of the inner movements must be what Mahler himself ultimately wanted, then no final answer is possible.&quot;

An additional question is whether to restore the third hammer blow. Both the Ratz edition and the Kubik edition delete the third hammer blow. However, advocates on opposite sides of the inner movement debate, such as Del Mar and Matthews, have separately argued for restoration of the third hammer blow.

<text>The Royal Hospital Kilmainham () in Kilmainham, Dublin, is a 17th-century former hospital and retirement home which is now mainly used to house the Irish Museum of Modern Art and as a concert and events venue.

It is notable as being the first large secular building in Ireland as well as being the first large classical building in Ireland. It remains one of the few 17th-century buildings in Dublin that are still extant.

==History==

===Prior of St John and Kilmainham Castle===
A priory, founded in 1174 by Strongbow, existed on the site until the Crown closed it down in the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 1530s. It was the main centre of the Knights Hospitaller in Ireland and formed part of the Manor of Kilmainham.

===Commissioning, design and construction===

The hospital was built as a home for retired soldiers of the Irish Army by Sir William Robinson, Surveyor General for James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormond, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, between 1679 and 1687 on what was then a portion of the Phoenix Park.

Colonel John Jeffreys of Brecon, an old Welsh soldier who had served the Crown loyally during the English Civil War, was appointed the first Master, at a salary of £300 per annum. The hospital got off to a bad start financially: from a petition presented by Jeffreys to King James II in 1686, it seems that most of the original sources of funding had dried up.

The building was inspired by Les Invalides in Paris which also has a formal facade and a large enclosed courtyard. Along with Les Invalides, it served as the model for the Royal Hospital, Chelsea, begun the next year under the guidance of Christopher Wren.

The Richmond Tower at the end of the formal avenue leading to the Royal Hospital was designed by Francis Johnston. This gateway originally stood beside the river Liffey at Bloody Bridge (now Rory O&#x27;More Bridge), but had to be moved after the arrival of the railway in 1844 increased traffic congestion. He had placed his personal coat of arms above the arch, concealed by a piece of wood painted to match the stone, his idea being that his arms would be revealed to future generations after the wood became rotten. However, his little trick was uncovered when the gateway was taken down for removal. The coat of arms at present on the gateway is that of the Royal Hospital.

The Royal Hospital Kilmainham graveyards, including Bully&#x27;s Acre, are 400 metres to the west. A cross-shaft in the former cemetery may be the remains of a boundary cross associated with a ninth-century monastery located at this site.

===Hospital closure and repurposing===
Following the creation of the Irish Free State the Royal Hospital was considered as a potential home for Oireachtas Éireann, the new Irish national parliament. Eventually, it was decided to keep parliament in its temporary home in Leinster House. The Hospital remained the home of a dwindling number of soldiers until it closed in 1927. It was then variously used by the Garda Síochána and as a storage location for property belonging to the National Museum of Ireland. The large statue &quot;Queen Victoria&quot; which used to stand in the forecourt of Leinster House, before its removal in 1947, was stored in the main courtyard of the Hospital, as were various state carriages, including the state coach of the Lord Chancellor of Ireland. The Royal Hospital in Kilmainham was finally restored by the Irish Government in 1984 and opened as the Irish Museum of Modern Art (IMMA).

Every year on the National Day of Commemoration—the anniversary of the Truce that ended the Irish War of Independence, celebrated on the Sunday nearest 11 July–the President of Ireland lays a wreath in the courtyard in memory of all Irishmen and Irishwomen who have died in wars and on service with the United Nations. The ceremony includes members of the Government of Ireland, members of Dáil Éireann and of Seanad Éireann, the Council of State, the Defence Forces, the Judiciary and the Diplomatic Corps.

==Concert and events venue==
Since the beginning of the 21st century, the grounds have become a popular location for concerts and events. Festival such as Forbidden Fruit and acts such as Blur, Damien Rice, Tame Impala, Kodaline and Patti Smith have played there. The Frames played their 30th-anniversary show on 28 May 2022 for an audience of about 10,000.

<doc id="194926" wikidata="Q835614" url="?curid=194926" title="Petersen graph">
<text>In the mathematical field of graph theory, the Petersen graph is an undirected graph with 10 vertices and 15 edges. It is a small graph that serves as a useful example and counterexample for many problems in graph theory. The Petersen graph is named after Julius Petersen, who in 1898 constructed it to be the smallest bridgeless cubic graph with no three-edge-coloring.

Although the graph is generally credited to Petersen, it had in fact first appeared 12 years earlier, in a paper by . Kempe observed that its vertices can represent the ten lines of the Desargues configuration, and its edges represent pairs of lines that do not meet at one of the ten points of the configuration.

Donald Knuth states that the Petersen graph is &quot;a remarkable configuration that serves as a counterexample to many optimistic predictions about what might be true for graphs in general.&quot;

The Petersen graph also makes an appearance in tropical geometry. The cone over the Petersen graph is naturally identified with the moduli space of five-pointed rational tropical curves.

== Constructions ==

The Petersen graph is the complement of the line graph of formula_1. It is also the Kneser graph formula_2; this means that it has one vertex for each 2-element subset of a 5-element set, and two vertices are connected by an edge if and only if the corresponding 2-element subsets are disjoint from each other. As a Kneser graph of the form formula_3 it is an example of an odd graph.

Geometrically, the Petersen graph is the graph formed by the vertices and edges of the hemi-dodecahedron, that is, a dodecahedron with opposite points, lines and faces identified together.

== Embeddings ==
The Petersen graph is nonplanar. Any nonplanar graph has as minors either the complete graph formula_1, or the complete bipartite graph formula_5, but the Petersen graph has both as minors. The formula_1 minor can be formed by contracting the edges of a perfect matching, for instance the five short edges in the first picture. The formula_5 minor can be formed by deleting one vertex (for instance the central vertex of the 3-symmetric drawing) and contracting an edge incident to each neighbor of the deleted vertex.

The most common and symmetric plane drawing of the Petersen graph, as a pentagram within a pentagon, has five crossings. However, this is not the best drawing for minimizing crossings; there exists another drawing (shown in the figure) with only two crossings. Because it is nonplanar, it has at least one crossing in any drawing, and if a crossing edge is removed from any drawing it remains nonplanar and has another crossing; therefore, its crossing number is exactly 2. Each edge in this drawing is crossed at most once, so the Petersen graph is 1-planar. On a torus the Petersen graph can be drawn without edge crossings; it therefore has orientable genus 1.

The Petersen graph can also be drawn (with crossings) in the plane in such a way that all the edges have equal length. That is, it is a unit distance graph.

The simplest non-orientable surface on which the Petersen graph can be embedded without crossings is the projective plane. This is the embedding given by the hemi-dodecahedron construction of the Petersen graph (shown in the figure). The projective plane embedding can also be formed from the standard pentagonal drawing of the Petersen graph by placing a cross-cap within the five-point star at the center of the drawing, and routing the star edges through this cross-cap; the resulting drawing has six pentagonal faces. This construction forms a regular map and shows that the Petersen graph has non-orientable genus 1.

== Symmetries ==
The Petersen graph is strongly regular (with signature srg(10,3,0,1)). It is also symmetric, meaning that it is edge transitive and vertex transitive. More strongly, it is 3-arc-transitive: every directed three-edge path in the Petersen graph can be transformed into every other such path by a symmetry of the graph.
It is one of only 13 cubic distance-regular graphs.

The automorphism group of the Petersen graph is the symmetric group formula_8; the action of formula_8 on the Petersen graph follows from its construction as a Kneser graph. The Petersen graph is a core: every homomorphism of the Petersen graph to itself is an automorphism. As shown in the figures, the drawings of the Petersen graph may exhibit five-way or three-way symmetry, but it is not possible to draw the Petersen graph in the plane in such a way that the drawing exhibits the full symmetry group of the graph.

Despite its high degree of symmetry, the Petersen graph is not a Cayley graph. It is the smallest vertex-transitive graph that is not a Cayley graph.

== Hamiltonian paths and cycles ==
The Petersen graph has a Hamiltonian path but no Hamiltonian cycle. It is the smallest bridgeless cubic graph with no Hamiltonian cycle. It is hypohamiltonian, meaning that although it has no Hamiltonian cycle, deleting any vertex makes it Hamiltonian, and is the smallest hypohamiltonian graph.

As a finite connected vertex-transitive graph that does not have a Hamiltonian cycle, the Petersen graph is a counterexample to a variant of the Lovász conjecture, but the canonical formulation of the conjecture asks for a Hamiltonian path and is verified by the Petersen graph.

Only five connected vertex-transitive graphs with no Hamiltonian cycles are known: the complete graph &quot;K&quot;2, the Petersen graph, the Coxeter graph and two graphs derived from the Petersen and Coxeter graphs by replacing each vertex with a triangle. If &quot;G&quot; is a 2-connected, &quot;r&quot;-regular graph with at most 3&quot;r&quot; + 1 vertices, then &quot;G&quot; is Hamiltonian or &quot;G&quot; is the Petersen graph.

To see that the Petersen graph has no Hamiltonian cycle, consider the edges in the cut disconnecting the inner 5-cycle from the outer one. If there is a Hamiltonian cycle &quot;C&quot;, it must contain an even number of these edges. If it contains only two of them, their end-vertices must be adjacent in the two 5-cycles, which is not possible. Hence, it contains exactly four of them. Assume that the top edge of the cut is not contained in &quot;C&quot; (all the other cases are the same by symmetry). Of the five edges in the outer cycle, the two top edges must be in &quot;C&quot;, the two side edges must not be in &quot;C&quot;, and hence the bottom edge must be in &quot;C&quot;. The top two edges in the inner cycle must be in &quot;C&quot;, but this completes a non-spanning cycle, which cannot be part of a Hamiltonian cycle. Alternatively, we can also describe the ten-vertex 3-regular graphs that do have a Hamiltonian cycle and show that none of them is the Petersen graph, by finding a cycle in each of them that is shorter than any cycle in the Petersen graph. Any ten-vertex Hamiltonian 3-regular graph consists of a ten-vertex cycle &quot;C&quot; plus five chords. If any chord connects two vertices at distance two or three along &quot;C&quot; from each other, the graph has a 3-cycle or 4-cycle, and therefore cannot be the Petersen graph. If two chords connect opposite vertices of &quot;C&quot; to vertices at distance four along &quot;C&quot;, there is again a 4-cycle. The only remaining case is a Möbius ladder formed by connecting each pair of opposite vertices by a chord, which again has a 4-cycle. Since the Petersen graph has girth five, it cannot be formed in this way and has no Hamiltonian cycle.

== Coloring ==

The Petersen graph has chromatic number 3, meaning that its vertices can be colored with three colors — but not with two — such that no edge connects vertices of the same color. It has a list coloring with 3 colors, by Brooks&#x27; theorem for list colorings.

The Petersen graph has chromatic index 4; coloring the edges requires four colors. As a connected bridgeless cubic graph with chromatic index four, the Petersen graph is a snark. It is the smallest possible snark, and was the only known snark from 1898 until 1946. The snark theorem, a result conjectured by W. T. Tutte and announced in 2001 by Robertson, Sanders, Seymour, and Thomas, states that every snark has the Petersen graph as a minor.

Additionally, the graph has fractional chromatic index 3, proving that the difference between the chromatic index and fractional chromatic index can be as large as 1. The long-standing Goldberg-Seymour Conjecture proposes that this is the largest gap possible.

The Thue number (a variant of the chromatic index) of the Petersen graph is 5.

The Petersen graph requires at least three colors in any (possibly improper) coloring that breaks all of its symmetries; that is, its distinguishing number is three. Except for the complete graphs, it is the only Kneser graph whose distinguishing number is not two.

== Other properties ==
The Petersen graph:
* is 3-connected and hence 3-edge-connected and bridgeless. See the glossary.
* has independence number 4 and is 3-partite. See the glossary.
* is cubic, has domination number 3, and has a perfect matching and a 2-factor.
* has 6 distinct perfect matchings.
* is the smallest cubic graph of girth 5. (It is the unique formula_10-cage. In fact, since it has only 10 vertices, it is the unique formula_10-Moore graph.)
* every cubic bridgeless graph without Petersen minor has a cycle double cover.
* is the smallest cubic graph with Colin de Verdière graph invariant μ = 5.
* is the smallest graph of cop number 3.
*has radius 2 and diameter 2. It is the largest cubic graph with diameter 2.
* has 2000 spanning trees, the most of any 10-vertex cubic graph.
* has chromatic polynomial formula_12.
* has characteristic polynomial formula_13, making it an integral graph—a graph whose spectrum consists entirely of integers.

== Petersen coloring conjecture ==
An &quot;Eulerian subgraph&quot; of a graph formula_14 is a subgraph consisting of a subset of the edges of formula_14, touching every vertex of formula_14 an even number of times. These subgraphs are the elements of the cycle space of formula_14 and are sometimes called cycles. If formula_14 and formula_19 are any two graphs, a function from the edges of formula_14 to the edges of formula_19 is defined to be &quot;cycle-continuous&quot; if the pre-image of every cycle of formula_19 is a cycle of formula_14. A conjecture of Jaeger asserts that every bridgeless graph has a cycle-continuous mapping to the Petersen graph. Jaeger showed this conjecture implies the 5-cycle-double-cover conjecture and the Berge-Fulkerson conjecture.&quot;

==Related graphs==

The generalized Petersen graph formula_24 is formed by connecting the vertices of a regular &quot;n&quot;-gon to the corresponding vertices of a star polygon with Schläfli symbol {&quot;n&quot;/&quot;k&quot;}. For instance, in this notation, the Petersen graph is formula_25: it can be formed by connecting corresponding vertices of a pentagon and five-point star, and the edges in the star connect every second vertex. The generalized Petersen graphs also include the &quot;n&quot;-prism formula_26 the Dürer graph formula_27, the Möbius-Kantor graph formula_28, the dodecahedron formula_29, the Desargues graph formula_30 and the Nauru graph formula_31.

The Petersen family consists of the seven graphs that can be formed from the Petersen graph by zero or more applications of Δ-Y or Y-Δ transforms. The complete graph &quot;K&quot;6 is also in the Petersen family. These graphs form the forbidden minors for linklessly embeddable graphs, graphs that can be embedded into three-dimensional space in such a way that no two cycles in the graph are linked.

The Clebsch graph contains many copies of the Petersen graph as induced subgraphs: for each vertex &quot;v&quot; of the Clebsch graph, the ten non-neighbors of &quot;v&quot; induce a copy of the Petersen graph.

<doc id="194927" wikidata="Q448241" url="?curid=194927" title="Sarah Zettel">
<text>Sarah Zettel (born December 14, 1966) is an American author, primarily of science fiction. Her first short story was published in &quot;Analog Science Fiction and Fact&quot; in 1991. Zettel&#x27;s novels have won multiple awards, including the Philip K. Dick Award and the Locus Award for Best First Novel, and positive reviews from critics. Her first novel &quot;Reclamation&quot; was published in 1996 and her second novel &quot;Fool&#x27;s War&quot; in 1997. She has written romance novels and mysteries under the pseudonym Darcie Wilde, and the novel &quot;Bitter Angels&quot; as C. L. Anderson.

==Career==
Zettel&#x27;s first short story &quot;Driven by Moonlight&quot; was written in 1986, and was published in &quot;Analog Science Fiction and Fact&quot; in 1991. Her first novel &quot;Reclamation&quot; was published in 1996; this was followed by &quot;Fool&#x27;s War&quot; in 1997. Zettel wrote many science-fiction short stories for &quot;Analog&quot; and other publications. Stanley Schmidt, the editor of &quot;Analog&quot;, sent her work back multiple times to fix problems; in 1998, Zettel said she regarded Schmidt &quot;as a really great teacher, and I think that experience is what led me directly to be able to write &quot;Reclamation&quot;&quot;.

, Zettel has written 35 novels in genres that include horror, fantasy, romance, thriller/suspense, and young adult. She said &quot;every genre gives you a different view into the art of storytelling&quot;. Of all of her novels, &quot;A Mother&#x27;s Lie&quot; &quot;holds a special place in her heart&quot; because &quot;I wanted a chance to write a suspense book in which the mother gets to be the hero, and the strength of the relationship between mother and daughter gets to be at the center of the story in a positive way&quot;. Zettel writes regency mysteries and romances under the pseudonym Darcie Wilde. Among Zettel&#x27;s favorite science-fiction authors are Ursula Le Guin – who inspired her to become an author – and Octavia Butler, Mary Doria Russell, and Terry Prachett. Zettel said her ideas come from current events, her earlier reading material, and memoirs based around science.

==Reception==
Sarah Zettel&#x27;s first novel &quot;Reclamation&quot; was nominated for the Philip K. Dick Award in 1997 and won the Locus Award for Best First Novel the same year. Writing as C. L. Anderson, her novel &quot;Bitter Angels&quot; won the 2010 Philip K. Dick award for best science-fiction paperback. Her novel &quot;Fool&#x27;s War&quot; became a &quot;New York Times&quot; Notable Book in 1997. The American Library Association said &quot;Playing God&quot; is &quot;one of the Best Books for Young Adults of 1999&quot;. &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; and the American Library Association said her novel &quot;Dust Girl&quot; is one of that year&#x27;s &quot;best young adult books&quot;.

Professor and media scholar Henry Jenkins wrote; &quot;Sarah Zettel&#x27;s 1997 novel, &quot;Fool&#x27;s War&quot; makes an important contribution to the growing body of feminist literature about artificial intelligence, taking the relationship between bodies and information as one of its core themes&quot;. John R. Alden of &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; reviewed &quot;Fool&#x27;s War&quot;, stating; &quot;Sarah Zettel&#x27;s thought-provoking tale offers an energetic plot and a cast full of appealing characters&quot;. A &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; review of &quot;Playing God&quot; says; &quot;Readers will embrace this complex, multidimensional saga (Zettel&#x27;s hardcover debut, and the best of her three novels) not only for its depiction of exotic alien civilization and its action-packed plot but also for its pertinent themes of tribalism, intolerance and ecological disaster&quot;.

&quot;Fool&#x27;s War&quot; was included in Book Riot&#x27;s list titled &quot;10 Chillingly Possible Sci-Fi Books About AIs Taking Over&quot; and says, &quot;This book does a fantastic job of capturing the tipping point that exists right before an AI wakes up and starts taking some sweet revenge for all those years of servitude&quot;. &quot;Dust Girl&quot;, in which the main character is of mixed race and is half-fairy, was included in a &quot;Bustle&#x27;s&quot; list titled &quot;12 Awesome YA Novels Featuring POC Protagonists&quot;.

===Awards and nominations===
Major awards and nominations in the science fiction and fantasy field:

* Sidewise Awards, works of alternate history, for &quot;The Persistence of Souls&quot; (The Shadow Conspiracy), nomination, 2010
* James Tiptree Jr. Memorial Award, for &quot;Playing God&quot;, shortlist, 1999

==Personal life==
Sarah Zettel was born in Sacramento, California, on December 14, 1966. Her mother Gail Beavers is a retired teacher and social worker; her father Leonard Francis Zettel Jr. is a retired engineer and programmer. When she was 13, Zettel decided she wanted to write in multiple genres. While Zettel was at university, she created &quot;shared worlds&quot; in notebooks with her friends. Zettel obtained a B.A. in Communication from the University of Michigan. She is married to a rocket scientist and currently lives in Michigan. She named her cat Buffy the Vermin Slayer.

<text>Jim Mitchell (19 October 1946 – 2 December 2002) was an Irish Fine Gael politician who served as deputy leader of Fine Gael from 2001 to 2002, Minister for Communications from 1984 to 1987, Minister for Transport and Minister for Posts and Telegraphs from 1982 to 1984, Minister for Justice from 1981 to 1982 and Lord Mayor of Dublin from 1976 to 1977. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1977 to 2002.

==Early life==
He was born in Inchicore, Dublin, the seventh child among five sons and five daughters of Peter Mitchell, a machinist, and Eileen Mitchell (née Whelan). He was educated at James&#x27;s St. CBS, Inchicore vocational school, and the College of Commerce, Rathmines. At age 14 he entered the Guinness Brewery as a shop-floor worker. While working he completed his Leaving Certificate, and did computer studies at night at Trinity College Dublin. After qualifying as a computer analyst, he joined the Guinness computer staff in the early 1970s.

Mitchell began his political involvement when he joined Fine Gael in 1967, becoming that party&#x27;s unsuccessful candidate in a by-election in 1970. He was an unsuccessful candidate for Dáil Éireann at the 1973 general election in Dublin South-West and lost again in the 1976 by-election in the same constituency, to Labour Party&#x27;s Brendan Halligan. Mitchell was elected to Dublin Corporation in 1974. In 1976, aged 29, he became the youngest ever Lord Mayor of Dublin.

==Political career==
At the 1977 general election he was elected to Dáil Éireann as a Fine Gael TD for the Dublin Ballyfermot constituency. With the party&#x27;s loss of power in 1977, the new leader, Garret FitzGerald appointed Mitchell to the Party&#x27;s Front Bench as Spokesperson for Labour. At the 1981 general election, Mitchell was elected for the Dublin West constituency as Fine Gael dramatically increased its number of seats before forming a coalition government with the Labour Party. On his appointment as Taoiseach, Garret FitzGerald caused some surprise by excluding some of the older conservative former ministers from his cabinet. Instead young liberals were appointed, with Mitchell receiving the post of Minister for Justice. The Fine Gael–Labour government collapsed in January 1982, but regained power in December of that year. Mitchell again was included in the FitzGerald cabinet, as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and Minister for Transport. These positions were combined into the position of Minister of Communications in January 1984.

Mitchell granted the aviation licence to the fledgling airline Ryanair on 29 November 1985. This was granted despite strong opposition by Ireland&#x27;s national carrier Aer Lingus, and from Fianna Fáil and other left-wing parties. The issue of the licence broke Aer Lingus&#x27; stranglehold on flights to London from the Republic of Ireland.

Mitchell, who was seen as being on the liberal wing of Fine Gael and was, however, out of favour with John Bruton when he became Fine Gael leader in 1990. When Bruton formed the Rainbow Coalition in December 1994, Mitchell was not appointed to any cabinet post.

Mitchell contested and won Dáil elections in 1977, 1981, February 1982, November 1982, 1987, 1989, 1992 and 1997. He also ran unsuccessfully for the European Parliament in the 1994 and 1999 elections. He also was director of elections for Austin Currie, the Fine Gael candidate, in the 1990 presidential election. In 2001, Bruton was deposed as Fine Gael leader, and replaced by Michael Noonan. Mitchell served as his deputy from 2001 to 2002.

==Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee==
Mitchell also chaired the Oireachtas &quot;Public Accounts Committee&quot;. Under Mitchell&#x27;s chairmanship, the committee began to look at allegations of corruption and wide-scale tax evasion in the banking sector, particularly regarding Deposit interest retention tax (DIRT). It was established that there was a culture of encouraging tax evasion within Irish banks, which had allowed wealthy customers to set up non-resident (off-shore, international) bank accounts into which money was transferred, enabling the account holder to avoid paying DIRT. The scandal resulted Allied Irish Banks being forced to reach a settlement of €90 million with the Revenue Commissioners in respect of DIRT evasion in 2000 in addition to thousands of tax-evaders being prosecuted including the former Minister for Justice Pádraig Flynn. The Mitchell inquiry was &quot;shocked and horrified&quot; at the &quot;careless and reckless&quot; manner in which the Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland had quoted false statistics to the Public Accounts subcommittee. Mitchell received much praise for his role in exposing the scandal.

==Loss of seat and death==
Though regarded in politics as one of Fine Gael&#x27;s &quot;survivors&quot;, who held onto his seat amid major boundary changes, constituency changes and by attracting working class votes in a party whose appeal was primarily middle class, Mitchell lost his Dublin Central seat at the 2002 general election. That election witnessed a large-scale collapse in the Fine Gael vote, with the party dropping from 54 to 31 seats in Dáil Éireann. Although Mitchell suffered from the swing against Fine Gael in Dublin, he was not aided by the fact that Inchicore, which was considered his base in the constituency had been moved to Dublin South-Central. Jim had chosen not to run in that constituency as his brother Gay was a sitting TD running for re-election for that constituency.

Mitchell had earlier had a liver transplant in an attempt to beat a rare form of cancer which had cost the lives of a number of his siblings. Though the operation was successful, the cancer returned, and Mitchell ultimately died of the disease in December 2002.

His former constituency colleague and rival, Bertie Ahern, described Jim Mitchell as having made an &quot;outstanding contribution to Irish politics.&quot;

<doc id="194935" wikidata="Q7358716" url="?curid=194935" title="Roger Newdigate">
<text>Sir Roger Newdigate, 5th Baronet (30 May 1719 – 23 November 1806) was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1742 and 1780. He was a collector of antiquities.

==Early life==
Newdigate was born in Arbury, Warwickshire, the son of Sir Richard Newdigate, 3rd Baronet (who died in 1727) and inherited the title 5th Baronet and the estates of Arbury and of Harefield in Middlesex on the early death of his brother in 1734. He was educated at Westminster School and University College, Oxford, where he matriculated in 1736, and graduated M.A. in 1738; he contributed greatly to the university throughout the remainder of his life. He is best remembered as the founder of the Newdigate Prize on his death and as a collector of antiques, a number of which he donated to the university. The prize for poetry helped make the names of many illustrious writers.

==Political career==
From 1742 until 1747, he served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Middlesex, and in 1751, he began a 30-year tenure as an MP for Oxford University.
He lavished attention on the Elizabethan Arbury Hall which he rebuilt over a period of thirty years in splendid Gothic Renaissance style, engaging the services of the architect Henry Couchman.

==Private life==
He married, firstly Sophia Conyers in 1743, and secondly Hesther Margaret Munday in 1776. Both marriages were childless and on his death in 1806 the baronetcy became extinct. Arbury Hall and Harefield passed to Francis Parker (1774–1862) of Kirk Hallam, Derbyshire, a distant cousin of the 5th Baronet, who then adopted the additional name of Newdigate. Francis Parker moved into Arbury Hall and married Lady Barbara Maria Legge, daughter of George Legge, 3rd Earl of Dartmouth, in 1820.

==Legacy==
Sir Roger was immortalised in fiction in George Eliot&#x27;s &quot;Scenes of Clerical Life&quot;, where he appears as Sir Christopher Cheverel in &quot;Mr Gilfil&#x27;s Love Story&quot;.

<doc id="194937" wikidata="Q2895" url="?curid=194937" title="Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic">
<text>The Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (BSSR or Byelorussian SSR; ; ), also known as Soviet Byelorussia or simply Byelorussia, was a republic of the Soviet Union (USSR). It existed between 1920 and 1922 as an independent state, and afterwards as one of fifteen constituent republics of the USSR from 1922 to 1991, with its own legislation from 1990 to 1991. The republic was ruled by the Communist Party of Byelorussia. It was also known as the &quot;White Russian Soviet Socialist Republic&quot;.

Following the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in March 1918, which ended Russia&#x27;s involvement in World War I, the Belarusian Democratic Republic (BDR) was proclaimed under German occupation; however, as German troops left, the Socialist Soviet Republic of Byelorussia was established in its place by the Bolsheviks in December, and it was later merged with the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1919 to form the Socialist Soviet Republic of Lithuania and Belorussia, which ceased to exist as a result of the Polish occupation during the Polish–Soviet War. Following a peace treaty with Lithuania, the Socialist Soviet Republic of Byelorussia was re-founded on 31 July 1920 and later became known as the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic.

The BSSR became one of the four founding members of the Soviet Union in December 1922, together with the republics of Russia, Transcaucasia, and Ukraine. Byelorussia was one of several Soviet republics occupied by Nazi Germany during World War II. Towards the final years of the Soviet Union&#x27;s existence, the Supreme Soviet of the Byelorussian SSR adopted the Declaration of State Sovereignty in 1990. On 25 August 1991, the Byelorussian SSR declared independence, and on 19 September it was renamed the Republic of Belarus. The Soviet Union was formally dissolved on 26 December 1991.
==Terminology==
The term &quot;Byelorussia&quot; (), derives from the term &quot;Belaya Rus&#x27; &quot;, i.e., &quot;White Rus&#x27;&quot;. There are several claims to the origin of the name &quot;White Rus&#x27;.&quot; An ethno-religious theory suggests that the name used to describe the part of old Ruthenian lands within the Grand Duchy of Lithuania that had been populated mostly by early Christianized Slavs, as opposed to Black Ruthenia, which was predominantly inhabited by pagan Balts.

The latter part similar but spelled and stressed differently from Росси́я (&quot;Russia&quot;), first rose in the days of the Russian Empire, and the Russian Tsar was usually styled &quot;the Tsar of All the Russias&quot;, as &quot;Russia&quot; or the &quot;Russian Empire&quot; was formed by three parts of Russia—the Great, Little, and White. This asserted that the territories are all Russian and all the peoples are also Russian; in the case of the Belarusians, that they were variants of the Russian people.

Following the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, the term &quot;White Russia&quot; caused some confusion as it became the name of the so-called White military force that opposed the Red Bolsheviks. During the period of the Byelorussian SSR, the term &quot;Byelorussia&quot; was embraced as part of a national consciousness. In western Belarus, under Polish control until World War II, &quot;Byelorussia&quot; became commonly used in the regions of Białystok and Grodno. Upon the establishment of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1920, the term &quot;Byelorussia&quot; (its names in other languages such as English being based on the Russian form) was only used officially. In 1936, with the proclamation of the 1936 Soviet Constitution, the republic was renamed to the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. In English, it was also known as the &quot;White Russian Soviet Socialist Republic&quot;.

On 19 September 1991 the Supreme Soviet of the Byelorussian SSR renamed the Soviet republic to the Republic of Belarus, with the short form &quot;Belarus&quot;. Conservative forces in the newly independent Belarus did not support the name change and opposed its inclusion in the 1991 draft of the Constitution of Belarus.

==History==

===Beginning===

Prior to the First World War, the territories of modern-day Belarus were part of the Russian Empire, which it gained from the Partitions of Poland more than a century earlier. During the war, the Great Retreat in the Western Front in August–September 1915 ended with the lands of Grodno Governorate and most of Vilna Governorate being occupied by Germany. The resulting front, passing at 100 kilometres to the west of Minsk, remained static towards the end of the conflict, despite Russian attempts to break it at the Lake Naroch offensive in late spring 1916, and General Alexei Evert&#x27;s inconclusive thrust around the city of Baranovichi in the summer of that year, during the Brusilov offensive further south, in western Ukraine.

The abdication of Nicholas II in light of the February Revolution in Russia in February 1917, activated a rather dormant political life in Belarus. As central authority waned, different political and ethnic groups strived for greater self-determination and even secession from the increasingly ineffective Russian Provisional Government. The momentum picked up after the incompetent actions of the 10th Army during the ill-fated Kerensky offensive during the summer. Representatives of Belarusian regions and of different (mostly left-wing) newly established political powers, including the Belarusian Socialist Assembly, the Christian democratic movement and the General Jewish Labour Bund, formed a Belarusian Central Council. However, the national parties in Belarus were unable to secure mass support, and the nationalist movement was confined to a small, divided and ineffective intelligentsia.

Towards the autumn, political stability continued to shake, and countering the rising nationalist tendencies, were the soviets led by Bolsheviks when the October Revolution hit Russia; that same day, on 25 October (7 November) 1917, the Minsk Soviet of Workers&#x27; and Soldiers&#x27; Deputies took over the administration of the city. The Bolshevik All-Russian Council of Soviets declared the creation of the Western Oblast, which unified the Vilna, Vitebsk, Mogilev and Minsk governorates that were not occupied by the German army, to administer the Belarusian lands in the frontal zone. On 26 November (6 December), the Executive Committee of Workers&#x27;, Peasants&#x27; and Soldiers&#x27; Deputies for the Western Oblast was merged with the Western front&#x27;s executive committee, creating a single &quot;Obliskomzap&quot;. During the autumn of 1917 and winter of 1918, the Western Oblast was headed by Aleksandr Myasnikyan as the head of the Western Oblast&#x27;s Military Revolutionary Committee, who passed this duty on to Kārlis Landers. Myasnikyan took over as chair of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party&#x27;s (RSDRP(b)) committee for the Western Oblast and as the chair of the &quot;Obliskomzap&quot;.

Countering this, the Belarusian Central Council reorganised itself as the Belarusian National Council (&quot;Rada&quot;), and started working on establishing governmental institutions, and discarded the &quot;Obliskomzap&quot; as a military formation, rather than governmental. As a result, on 7 (20) December, when the first All-Belarusian Congress convened, the Minsk Bolsheviks commanded the pro-Soviet troops to disbanded it. Following this, they proclaimed the rule of soviets dominated by the Bolsheviks. The first Soviet government in Belarus was established at the end of December by communist organs in Minsk with the support of Russian troops of the Western Front. However, its authority only extended to the regions occupied by pro-communist forces and the major cities, where the local soviets followed Bolshevik leadership.

===German involvement===
The Russo-German front in Belarus remained static since 1915 and formal negotiations began only on 19 November (2 December N.S.), when the Soviet delegation traveled to the German-occupied city of Brest-Litovsk. A cease-fire was quickly agreed and proper peace negotiations began in December.

However, the German party soon went back on its word and took full advantage of the situation, and the Bolsheviks&#x27; demand of a treaty &quot;without annexations or indemnities&quot; was unacceptable to the Central Powers, and on 18 February, hostilities resumed. The German Operation Faustschlag was of immediate success, and within 11 days, they were able to make a serious advance eastward, taking over Ukraine, the Baltic region, and occupying eastern Belarus. This forced the &quot;Obliskomzap&quot; to evacuate to Smolensk. The Smolensk Governorate was passed to the Western Oblast. At the end of February, the Germans entered Minsk, which the Soviet authorities had already cleared a few days prior.

Faced with the German demands, the Bolsheviks accepted their terms at the final Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which was signed on 3 March 1918. For the German Empire, Operation Faustschlag achieved one of their strategic plans for World War I, to create a German-centered hegemony of buffer states, called &quot;Mitteleuropa&quot;. On the eve of Germany&#x27;s occupation of Minsk, some members of the disbanded Belarusian National Council emerged from hiding and formed a provisional government, hoping to achieve German recognition. However, the Germans did not recognise it as another assembly in Vilna was created under their auspices. The Minsk and Vilna organisations issued a joint proclamation on 25 March establishing the Belarusian Democratic Republic (BDR) with German approval. The new government also sought material aid from Germany. The more radical nationalists who disapproved of collaboration with the Germans went to the communists and fled to Russia. The communists who did not escape to the east during the German occupation were driven underground.

In the spring of 1918, the Germans disapproved of the socialist inclinations of the nationalists in the Belarusian government and forced a change in leadership of the puppet government; however, the Germans were also displeased with him and removed him. As a result, the Germans permitted the government less jurisdiction compared to the one in Ukraine. An increase in repression by the Germans also led to an agrarian revolt, although not as violent as the one in Ukraine, which benefitted the communists. The communist underground were directed by the party&#x27;s Northwestern Regional Committee in Smolensk, which aimed for an alliance with the peasantry.

===Creation===

On 11 September 1918, the Revolutionary Military Council ordered the creation of the Western Defence region in the Western Oblast out of Curtain forces which were stationed there. Simultaneously the Council reorganised the Western Oblast as a &quot;Western Commune&quot;. After Germany was defeated in the First World War, it announced its evacuation from the occupied territories. The Germans began to depart in November 1918; however, there was no nationalist organisation in Belarus that was capable of assuming political authority, unlike in Ukraine. On 13 November, Moscow annulled the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. Two days later, it transformed the Defence region into a Western army. It began an initial advance westward on 17 November. The Belarusian National Republic barely resisted, evacuating Minsk on 3 December. The Soviets maintained a distance of about between the two armies, and took Minsk on 10 December. As the Red Army re-occupied Belarus, the soviets in the country were dominated by Russian and Jewish parties sympathetic to the communists.

Encouraged by their success, in Smolensk on 30–31 December 1918, the Sixth Western Oblast Party conference met and announced its split from the Russian Communist Party, proclaiming itself as the first congress of the Communist Party of Byelorussia (KP(b)B). The next day, the Soviet Socialist Republic of Byelorussia was proclaimed in Smolensk, terminating the Western Commune, and on 7 January, it was moved to Minsk. Aleksandr Myasnikyan emerged as head of the All-Byelorussian Central Executive Committee and Zmicier Zhylunovich as head of the provisional government.

The new Soviet republic initially consisted of seven districts: Baranovichi, Vitebsk, Gomel, Grodno, Mogilev and Smolensk. On 30 January, the republic announced its separation from the Russian SFSR and renaming as the &quot;Soviet Socialist&quot; Republic of Byelorussia (SSRB). This was conferred by the First Congress of deputies, composed of workers, soldiers and Red Army soldiers, which met on 2–3 February 1919, to adopt a new socialist constitution. The Red Army continued its westward advance, capturing the city of Grodno on New Year&#x27;s Day 1919, Pinsk on 21 January, and Baranovichi on 6 February 1919, thereby enlarging the SSRB.

===Litbel===
The western winter offensive was not limited to Byelorussia; Soviet forces similarly moved to the north into Lithuania, as the newly created Soviet republic had hoped to include Lithuania. On 16 December, the Lithuanian Socialist Soviet Republic (LSSR) was proclaimed in Vilnius.

The Lithuanian operation and continuing conquest of Byelorussia were threatened by the rise of the Second Polish Republic after the withdrawal of German forces. However, the conflict with Poland did not break out and the Soviet High Command&#x27;s 12 January directive was to cease advance on the Neman-Bug rivers. However, the region to the east of those lines was historically mixed among a population of Belarusians, Poles and Lithuanians, with a sizeable Jewish minority. The local communities of each respective group wanted to be part of the respective states that were establishing themselves.
In the &quot;Kresy&quot; (&quot;borderland&quot;) areas of Lithuania, Belarus and western Ukraine, self-organized militias, the &quot;Samoobrona Litwy i Białorusi&quot; numbering approximately 2,000 soldiers under General Wejtko, began to fight against the local communist and advancing Bolshevik forces. Each side was trying to secure the territories for its own government. The newly formed Polish Army began sending its organised units to reinforce the militias. On 14 February, the first clash between regular armies took place and a front emerged. The operations in Lithuania brought the front close to East Prussia, and the German units that had withdrawn there began to assist the Lithuanian forces to defeat the Soviets; they repelled the Red offensive against Kaunas in February 1919.

Eager to win support, the Bolshevik government decided to merge the Lithuanian and Byelorussian republics into the Lithuanian–Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (&quot;Litbel&quot;) on 28 February 1919. Its capital was proclaimed as Vilna, with five governorates: Vilna, Grodno, Kovno, Suwalki and Minsk. The Vitebsk and Mogilev governorates were transferred to the Russian SFSR, and were soon joined by the Gomel Governorate, which was created on 26 April. The two parties of the republics were also combined. The republic was headed by Vincas Mickevičius-Kapsukas and the combined party was headed by nationalist Zmicier Zhylunovich. However, the Belarusian nationalists disapproved that the republic was being expanded, and Zhylunovich resigned shortly after, followed by other nationalists.

In March 1919, Polish units opened an offensive: forces under General Stanisław Szeptycki captured the city of Slonim (2 March) and crossed the Neman, whilst Lithuanian advances forced the Soviets out of Panevėžys. A final Soviet counter-offensive retook Panevėžys and Grodno in early April, but the Western Army was too thinly spread to fight both the Polish and Lithuanian troops, and the German units assisting them. The Polish offensive quickly gained momentum, and Vilna offensive in April 1919, forced Litbel to evacuate the capital first to Dvinsk (28 April), then to Minsk (28 April), then to Bobruysk (19 May). As the Litbel lost territory, its powers were quickly stripped by Moscow. For example, on 1 June, Vtsik&#x27;s decree put all of Litbel&#x27;s armed forces under the command of the Red Army. On 17 July, the Defence Soviet was liquidated, and its function was passed to Minsk&#x27;s Milrevcom. When on 8 August Polish forces captured Minsk, that same day the capital was evacuated to Smolensk. On 28 August, Lithuanian forces took Zarasai (the last Lithuanian town held by Litbel) and the same day Bobruysk fell to the Poles.

By late summer of 1919, the Polish advance was also exhausted. The defeat of the Red Army allowed the outbreak of another historic disagreement over territory between Poland and Lithuania; their competition to control the city of Vilna soon erupted into a military conflict, with Poland winning. Facing Denikin and Kolchak, Soviet Russia could not spare men for the western front. A stalemate with localised skirmishes developed between Poland and Lithuania.

The Polish Sejm had also declared that the territories of Belarus were an inalienable part of the Polish Commonwealth. As the Sejm was voting for annexation, Józef Piłsudski offered the Belarusians federal ties instead; however, the Polish occupation authorities disregarded the social radicalism of the masses and nationalist sentiments among parts of the Belarusian intelligentsia, with the Poles ordering for the lands confiscated by the communists to be returned to the landowners, and Polish being introduced as an official language.

===Pawn on a chessboard===
The stalemate and the occasional, though fruitless, negotiations gave Russia a much needed pause to concentrate on other regions. During the latter half of 1919, the Red Army successfully defeated Denikin in the south, taking over the Don, North Caucasus and eastern Ukraine, and pushed Kolchak from the Volga, beyond the Ural mountains into Siberia. In the autumn of 1919, Nikolai Yudenich&#x27;s advance on Petrograd was checked, whilst in the far north the Evgeny Miller&#x27;s army was pushed into the Arctic. On the diplomatic front, on 11 September 1919, the People&#x27;s Commissar of Foreign Affairs of Soviet Russia, Georgy Chicherin, sent a note to Lithuania with a proposal for a peace treaty. It was a &quot;de facto&quot; recognition of the Lithuanian state. Similar negotiations with Estonia and Latvia, gave way for a peace treaty with the former on 2 February 1920 and a cease-fire agreement with the latter a day earlier.

Lenin feared that a Polish offensive was incoming, and offered to accept the current frontline as a permanent border between Poland and Russia, which would include nearly all of Belarus going to Poland. However, Piłsudski had greater ambitions, and he also made an agreement with Symon Petliura in Ukraine to exchange Galicia in return for a promise to force out communists in right-bank Ukraine.

===War continues===
In April 1920, Poland initiated its major offensive on Kiev, which although was initially successful, ended in a Polish defeat. The Soviet Red Army was much more organised than it was a year earlier, and though Polish troops managed to make several gains in Ukraine, notably the capture of Kiev, in Byelorussia, both of its offensives towards Zhlobin and Orsha were thrown back in May.

In June, the RSFSR was finally ready to open its major Western advance. To preserve the neutrality of Lithuania (though the peace treaty was still being negotiated), on 6 June the exiled government of Litbel was disbanded. Within a few days, the 3rd Cavalry Corps under command of Hayk Bzhishkyan broke the Polish front, causing a collapse and a retreat. On 11 July Minsk was re-taken, and on 31 July 1920 once again the Soviet Socialist Republic of Belorussia was re-established in Minsk.

As the front moved west, and more Belarusian lands were adjoined to the new republic, the first administrative decrees were issued. The entity was divided into seven uyezds: Bobruysk, Borisov, Igumen, Minsk, Mozyr and Slutsk. (Vitebsk, Gomel and Mogilev remained part of the RSFSR.) This time the leaders were Aleksandr Chervyakov (head of Minsk&#x27;s milrevcom) and Wilhelm Knorin (as chairmen of the Central Committee of the Belarusian Communist Party). The SSRB sought to join further territories, as the Red Army crossed into Poland, but the decisive Polish victory at the Battle of Warsaw in August ended these ambitions. Once again, the Red Army found itself on the defensive in Belorussia. The Poles were able to successfully break the Russian lines at the Battle of the Niemen River in September 1920. As a result, the Soviets were not only forced to abandon their World Revolution targets, but Western Belarus too. However early autumn rains halted the Polish advance, which exhausted itself by October. A cease-fire agreed on 12 October, came into effect on 18 October.

===Slutsk uprising===
As the negotiations between the Polish Republic and the Russian Bolshevik government took place in Riga, the Soviet side saw the armistice as only a temporary setback in its western advance. Seeing the failure of overcoming the Polish nationalist rhetoric with Communist propaganda, the Soviet government chose a different tactic, by appealing to the minorities of the Polish state, creating a fifth column element out of Belarusians and Ukrainians. During the negotiations, RSFSR offered all of BSSR to Poland in return for concessions in Ukraine, which were rejected by the Polish side. Eventually a compromising armistice line was agreed, which would see the Belarusian city of Slutsk handed over to the Bolsheviks.

News of Belarus&#x27; upcoming permanent division angered the population, and using the town&#x27;s Polish occupation, the local population began self-organising into a militia and associating itself with the Belarusian Democratic Republic. On 24 November the Polish units left the town, and for nearly a month the Slutsk partisans resisted Soviet attempts to re-gain control of the area. Eventually the Red Army had to mobilise two divisions to overcome the resistance, when the last units of Slutsk militia crossed the Moroch River and interned by the Polish border guards.

===Early Soviet years===

In February 1921, the delegations of the Second Polish Republic and the Russian SFSR finally signed the Treaty of Riga putting an end of hostilities in Europe, and Belarus in particular. Six years of war had left the land neglected and looted, and the endless change of occupying regimes, each worse than the previous, left their mark on the Belarusian people, who were now divided. Almost half (Western Belarus) now belonged to Poland. Eastern Belarus (Gomel, Vitebsk and parts of Smolensk guberniyas) were administered by the RSFSR. The rest was the SSRB, a republic with 52,400 square kilometres and a population of a mere 1.544 million people.

An interesting paradox arose in the status of SSRB within the future Bolshevik state. On one hand its small geographic, population and almost negligent economic indicators did not warrant it much political weight on Soviet affairs. In fact the leader of the Communist Party of Byelorussia (Bolshevik), Alexander Chervyakov would represent Byelorussian communists at seven party congresses in Moscow, but not once be elected into the party&#x27;s Central Committee. Moreover, the weak national sentiment of the Belarusian people would easily have allowed SSRB to be disbanded and annexed to the RSFSR, unlike for example Ukraine.

On the other hand, the region&#x27;s strategic role decided its fate, as a full Union republic within the negotiations upon forming the future state. For one Leon Trotsky and his supporters within the Soviet leadership still supported its World Revolution concept, and as said above, viewed the Treaty of Riga as only a temporary setback to the process, and a future advance would require a prepared bridgehead. This justified giving the SSRB the status of a full union republic within the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR that was signed on 30 December 1922. SSR Byelorussia became a founding member of the Soviet Union in 1922 and became known as BSSR.

However the politics in Moscow took a different course of events, and eventually the accession of Joseph Stalin saw a new policy adopted: Socialism in One Country. In accordance with which, expansionist and irredentist claims were removed from Soviet ideology, which instead would focus on making regions economically viable. Thus in March 1924, by decree of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee, Russia returned most of territories that made up the Vitebsk and Mogilev Governorates, as well as parts of Smolensk. The passing of land that largely survived the destruction of war not only doubled the SSRB&#x27;s area to 110,600 square kilometres, but also raised the population to 4.2 million people.

===SSRB in the mid-1920s===

According to its entry in the Great Soviet Encyclopedia, in 1925 SSRB was a largely rural country. Out of the 4,342,800 people that inhabited it, only 14.5% lived in urban areas. Administratively it was split into ten okrugs: Bobruysk, Borisov, Vitebsk, Kalinin, Minsk, Mogilev, Mozyr, Orsha, Polotsk and Slutsk; all of which contained a total of 100 raions and 1,229 selsoviets. Only 25 towns and cities and an additional 49 urban settlements.

Trotsky&#x27;s plan for the SSRB to act as a future magnet for the minorities in the Second Polish Republic is clearly evidenced in the national policies. The republic initially had four official languages: Belarusian, Russian, Yiddish, and Polish, despite the fact that the Russians and the Poles made up only around 2% of the total population (most of the latter lived next to the state border in the Minsk and Borisov districts). The most important minority was the Jewish population of Belarus, which had a long history of targeted oppression under the Tsars, and in 1925 made up almost 44% of the urban population and began to be aided by affirmative action programmes. In 1924 the government created a committee – &quot;Belkomzet&quot; – to allocate land to Jewish families, in 1926 a total of 32,700 hectares were given for 6,860 Jewish families. Jews would continue to play a major role in Byelorussian politics, society and economy right up to the Second World War; in fact, between 1928 and 1930, the first secretary of the Communist Party of Byelorussia, Yakov Gamarnik, was a Jew.

Yet, the titular nation of the SSRB were the Belarusians, which made up 82% of the rural population, but less than half of the urban one (40.1%). The Belarusian national sentiment was a lot weaker than that of neighbouring Ukraine, this was greatly exploited by the Bolshevik-Polish power struggle in the Polish–Soviet War. (In fact to avoid being annexed to Poland, at the census of 1920, many chose to be label themselves as Russians.). To appeal to the Belarusians of Western Belarus and also to prevent the nationalist element of the exiled Belarusian Democratic Republic from having any influence on the population (i.e. to avoid another Slutsk uprising), a policy of Korenizatsiya was widely implemented. Belarusian language, folklore and culture was put at front of everything else. This went on par with the Soviet policy of liquidation of illiteracy (likbez).

Economically the republic remained largely self-centred, and most of the effort was put into restoring and repairing the war-damaged industry (if in 1923 there was only 226 different fabrics and factories, then by 1926 the number climbed to 246. However, the employed manpower jumped from 14 thousand to 21.3 thousand workers). The majority was food industry followed by metal and wood working combines. A lot more was centred in local and private sector, as allowed by the New Economic Policy of the USSR, in 1925 these number 38.5 thousand who employed almost 50 thousand people. Most being textile workshops and lumber yards and blacksmiths.

On 6 December 1926, the SSRB was once again enlarged, in order to make the republic prosperous and continue the creating of well-defined national territorial units. This time, parts of RSFSR&#x27;s Gomel Governorate were added, including the cities of Gomel and Rechytsa. This increased the area to 126,300 square kilometres and the 1926 Soviet census that was held at the same time reported a population of 4,982,623. Of the latter 83% was rural, and Belarusians made up 80.6% (though only 39.2% of urban, yet 89% of rural).

On 11 April 1927, the republic adopted its new Constitution, bringing its laws in tie with those of the USSR and changing the name from the &quot;Soviet Socialist Republic of Byelorussia&quot; to the &quot;Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic.&quot; The head of government (chairman of the Soviet of People&#x27;s Commissars) was by now then newly appointed Nikolay Goloded, whilst Vilhelm Knorin remained the first secretary of the Communist Party.

===Stalinist years===
The 1930s marked the peak of Soviet repressions in Belarus. According to incomplete calculations, about 600,000 people fell victim to Soviet repressions in Belarus between 1917 and 1953. Other estimates put the number at higher than 1.4 million persons., of which 250,000 were sentenced by judicial or executed by extrajudicial bodies (&quot;dvoikas&quot;, &quot;troikas&quot;, special commissions of the OGPU, NKVD, MGB). Excluding those sentenced in the 1920s–1930s, over 250,000 Belarusians were deported as kulaks or kulak family members to regions outside the Belarusian Soviet Republic. The scale of Soviet terror in Belarus was higher than in Russia or Ukraine which resulted in a much stronger extent of Russification in the republic.

A Polish Autonomous District was founded in 1932 and disbanded in 1935.

In September 1939, the Soviet Union, following the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact with Nazi Germany, occupied eastern Poland after the 1939 invasion of Poland. The former Polish territories referred to as West Belarus were incorporated into the Belarusian SSR, with an exception of the city of Vilnius and its surroundings that were transferred to Lithuania. The annexation was internationally recognized after the end of World War II.

===Nazi German occupation===
In the summer of 1941, Belarus was occupied by Nazi Germany. A large part of the territory of Belarus became the &quot;General District Belarus&quot; within the Reichskommissariat Ostland.

Nazi Germany imposed a brutal regime, deporting some 380,000 people for slave labour, and killing hundreds of thousands of civilians more. 800,000 Belarusian Jews (about 90 percent of the Jewish population) were killed during the Holocaust. At least 5,295 Belarusian settlements were destroyed by the Germans and some or all their inhabitants killed (out of 9,200 settlements that were burned or otherwise destroyed in Belarus during World War II). More than 600 villages like Khatyn were totally annihilated. Altogether, over 2,000,000 people were killed in Belarus during the three years of German occupation, almost a quarter of the region&#x27;s population.

After World War II, the Byelorussian SSR was given a seat in the United Nations General Assembly together with the Soviet Union and Ukrainian SSR, becoming one of the founding members of the UN. This was part of a deal with the United States to ensure a degree of balance in the General Assembly, which, the USSR opined, was unbalanced in favor of the Western Bloc. A Byelorussian, G.G. Chernushchenko, served as President of the United Nations Security Council from January–February 1975.

===Dissolution===
In its last years during &quot;perestroika&quot; under Mikhail Gorbachev, the Supreme Soviet of Byelorussian SSR declared sovereignty on 27 July 1990 over Soviet laws.

On 25 August 1991, after the failure of the coup in Moscow, the republic proclaimed its political and economic independence from the Soviet Union, however, continued to consider herself part of the USSR. On 19 September the republic was renamed the Republic of Belarus. On 8 December 1991 it was a signatory, along with Russia and Ukraine, of the Belovezha Accords, which replaced the Soviet Union with the Commonwealth of Independent States. Belarus received independence on 25 December 1991. A day later the Soviet Union ceased to exist. However, the Constitution (Fundamental Law) of the Republic of Belarus of 1978, was retained after independence.

==Politics and government==

Until 1990, Byelorussia was a one-party socialist republic, governed by the Communist Party of Byelorussia, a branch within the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU/KPSS). Like all other Soviet republics, it was one of the 15 constituent republics composing the Soviet Union from its entry into the union in 1922 until its dissolution in 1991. Executive power was exercised by the Byelorussian Communist Party authorities, at its top sits the Chairman of the Council of Ministers. Legislative power was vested in the unicameral parliament, the Supreme Soviet of the Byelorussian SSR, also dominated by the Communist Party.

Belarus is the legal successor of the Byelorussian SSR and in its Constitution it states, &quot;Laws, decrees and other acts which were applied in the territory of the Republic of Belarus prior to the entry into force of the present Constitution shall apply in the particular parts thereof that are not contrary to the Constitution of the Republic of Belarus.&quot;

===Foreign relations===

On the international stage, Byelorussia (along with Ukraine) was one of only two republics of the Soviet Union to be separate members of the United Nations. Both republics and the Soviet Union joined the UN when the organization was founded with the other 50 states on 24 October 1945. In effect, this provided the Soviet Union (a permanent Security Council member with veto powers) with another 2 votes in the General Assembly.

Apart from the UN, the Byelorussian SSR was a member of the UN Economic and Social Council, UNICEF, International Labour Organization, Universal Postal Union, World Health Organization, UNESCO, International Telecommunication Union, United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, World Intellectual Property Organization and the International Atomic Energy Agency. Byelorussia was excluded separately from the Warsaw Pact, Comecon, the World Federation of Trade Unions and the World Federation of Democratic Youth. In 1949, it joined the International Olympic Committee as a Union Republic.

==Demographics==
According to the 1959 Soviet Census, the population of the republic were made up as follows:

Ethnicities (1959):
*Belarusians – 81%
*Poles – 16%
*Lithuanians – 5%
*Ukrainians – about 1%
*Jews – about 1%
*Russians – &lt;1%

The largest cities were:
*Minsk
*Brest
*Gomel
*Grodno
*Mogilev
*Vitebsk
*Bobruisk

==Culture==
===Cuisine===

Whilst part of the Union, the cuisine of Byelorussia consisted mainly of vegetables, meat (particularly pork), and bread. Foods are usually either slowly cooked or stewed. Typically, Byelorussians eat a light breakfast and two hearty meals, with dinner being the largest meal of the day. Wheat and rye breads are consumed in Belarus, but rye is more plentiful because conditions are too harsh for growing wheat. Many of the cuisines within Byelorussia also shared its cuisine with Russia and Poland.

<text>The Vogtlandkreis () is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (rural district) in the southwest of Saxony, Germany, at the borders of Thuringia, Bavaria, and the Czech Republic. Neighbouring districts are (from south clockwise) Hof, Saale-Orla, Greiz, Zwickau, and Erzgebirgskreis. It is the southernmost district in the state.

Plauen is the administrative centre and largest city of the district. Other major cities &quot;(Große Kreisstädte)&quot; are Reichenbach im Vogtland, Auerbach, and Oelsnitz im Vogtland.

==History==
The Vogtland became part of the Holy Roman Empire under king Conrad III in the 12th century. In 1209, the minister dynasty administrating the area was split into three areas, Weida, Greiz and Gera-Plauen. When centralized power over the area decreased, county leaders, local administrators, called in Latin &quot;advocatus&quot; or in German &quot;Vögte&quot;, were appointed, giving the area its current name. The Vogtland war (1354-1357) ended this administration and the area changed ownership to Bohemia.

In 1546 Henry IV, Burgrave of Plauen got the area from the Bohemian king and later emperor Ferdinand I. His children inherited not only the land, but also crippling debts, so to pay these 1563 the area was bought by Saxony from Henry VI, and when in 1569 Henry VI finally ceased to claim ownership the new leadership created the first Vogtland district (&quot;Voigtländischen Creiß&quot;).

1657-1718 Saxony was split into parts, the Vogtland belonged to Saxe-Zeitz. In 1835 the new constitutional monarchy changed the administration and abolished the old district, and instead the &quot;Amtshauptmannschaft&quot; Plauen was created, and in 1867 those of Auerbach and Oelsnitz. 1907 the city of Plauen left the district and became district-free city.

1952 the East German government with the big administrative reform renamed them to &quot;Kreise&quot; (districts), and created the new districts Klingenthal and Reichenbach by decreasing the size of the previous ones. After the German Reunification the changes of the 1952 reform were mostly undone, and in 1996 the 5 districts were merged to form the Vogtlandkreis.

In the district reform of August 1, 2008 the city of Plauen was included into the district.

==Geography==
The Vogtlandkreis is named after the geographic area it covers, the &quot;Vogtland&quot;, which was so called because it was governed by Vogts. Located in the Ore Mountains it contains a lot of forests. The main river is the White Elster. The mountain of Bezelberg (638 m) lies within the district.

==Governance==
===County council===
The district council of the Vogtland district was elected in the local elections on 9 June 2024. The 86 seats in the district council are distributed among the individual parties as follows:

==People==
The first German cosmonaut, Sigmund Jähn was born in the Vogtland. His hometown, the small town of &quot;Morgenröthe-Rautenkranz&quot;, in the municipality Muldenhammer, houses a small &quot;Space Exploration&quot; exhibition.

==Coat of arms==
The lion on the left side of the coat of arms is traditional symbol of the Vögte of Weida, Gera and Plauen, which was confirmed in 1294. The eagle on the right side stands for the Holy Roman Empire, as the Vogtland belonged to the Empire directly.

<text>Fornebu (local form &quot;Fornebo&quot;) is a peninsular area in the suburban municipality of Bærum in Norway, bordering western parts of Oslo.

Oslo Airport, Fornebu (FBU) served as the main airport for Oslo and the country since before World War II and until the evening of October 7, 1998, when it was closed down. Overnight, a grand moving operation was performed, so that the following morning, the new main airport, located inland at Gardermoen (OSL), opened for operations as the main airport, as opposed to previously having been a minor airport.

As of 2001, the Fornebu area is being developed as a centre for information technology and telecom industry, as well as there being some housing project developments nearby. The new headquarters of Norway&#x27;s telecom giant Telenor are located in the area.

The peninsula is connected to Langodden and Snarøya, which are more established areas of private residences.

==Etymology==
The name (Norse &quot;Fornabú(ð)&quot;) originally belonged to an old farm on the peninsula. The first element is the genitive form of an old male name &quot;Forni&quot;, the last element is &quot;bú&quot; n &#x27;farm&#x27; (or maybe &quot;búð&quot; f &#x27;shed, simple house&#x27;).

==Economy==

Scandinavian Airlines System&#x27;s Norway offices are in Fornebu. Norwegian Air Shuttle, Telenor, Aker Kværner, Canal Digital, Equinor, Norgesgruppen and EVRY are also based at Fornebu.

Partnair, a charter airline, was headquartered at Fornebu Airport up to 1989. When the airline Busy Bee of Norway existed, its head office was on the grounds of Fornebu Airport. Braathens and SAS Braathens had their head office facilities in a building on the grounds of Fornebu Airport. In 2010 Norwegian Air Shuttle bought the former Braathens head office.

<text>Ansbach () is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in Bavaria, Germany. It surrounds – but does not include – the town of Ansbach; nonetheless the administrative seat of the district is located in Ansbach. It is the district with the largest area in Bavaria. At the end of December 2022, the district population was 188,623.

== History ==
Some of the local towns already existed during the lifetime of Charlemagne, who visited Feuchtwangen about 800. In the 13th century, the towns of Rothenburg, Dinkelsbühl and Feuchtwangen were elevated to Free Imperial cities; so they were directly subordinate to the Holy Roman Emperor. The town of Ansbach became subject to the Hohenzollern family, who established the state of Ansbach (later Brandenburg-Ansbach) in the region.

The district of Ansbach was established in 1972, when the former districts of Ansbach, Dinkelsbühl, Feuchtwangen and Rothenburg were merged. The historic town of Rothenburg lost its status as an urban district and was incorporated into the district.

== Geography ==
Ansbach is the largest district of Bavaria. Its northern half is occupied by the Franconian Heights, a gentle hilly countryside. The southern parts are covered with heaths and forests. The source of the Altmühl river is located in the district.

The district is bounded by (from the west and clockwise) the districts Ostalbkreis, Schwäbisch Hall and Main-Tauber (all in the state of Baden-Württemberg), and the districts of Neustadt (Aisch)-Bad Windsheim, Fürth, Roth, Weißenburg-Gunzenhausen and Donau-Ries.

== Coat of arms ==
The coat of arms displays:
* top left: the black and white arms of the Hohenzollern dynasty, who ruled the former state of Brandenburg-Ansbach
* top right: the red and white arms of Franconia
* bottom: the heraldic eagle of the Holy Roman Empire, which stands for the former Free Imperial cities of Rothenburg, Dinkelsbühl and Feuchtwangen

<doc id="194950" wikidata="Q944758" url="?curid=194950" title="Tetraplegia">
<text>Tetraplegia, also known as quadriplegia, is defined as the dysfunction or loss of motor and/or sensory function in the cervical area of the spinal cord. A loss of motor function can present as either weakness or paralysis leading to partial or total loss of function in the arms, legs, trunk, and pelvis. (Paraplegia is similar but affects the thoracic, lumbar, and sacral segments of the spinal cord and arm function is retained.) The paralysis may be flaccid or spastic. A loss of sensory function can present as an impairment or complete inability to sense light touch, pressure, heat, pinprick/pain, and proprioception. In these types of spinal cord injury, it is common to have a loss of both sensation and motor control.

==Signs and symptoms==

Although the most obvious symptom is impairment of the limbs, functioning is also impaired in the trunk and pelvic organs. This can lead to loss or impairment of controlling bowel and bladder, sexual function, digestion, breathing and other autonomic functions. Furthermore, sensation is usually impaired in affected areas. This may manifest as numbness, reduced sensation or neuropathic pain. Secondarily, because of their depressed functioning and immobility, tetraplegics are often more vulnerable to pressure sores, osteoporosis and fractures, frozen joints, spasticity, respiratory complications, infections, autonomic dysreflexia, deep vein thrombosis, and cardiovascular disease.

The severity of the condition depends on both the level at which the spinal cord is injured and the extent of the injury. An individual with an injury at C1 (the highest cervical vertebra, at the base of the skull) will probably lose function from the neck down and be ventilator-dependent. An individual with a C7 injury may lose function from the chest down but still retain use of the arms and much of the hands. An individual in between, with a C5 injury may lose some function from the chest down and fine motor skills in his/her hands but still have flexion and extension abilities of certain muscles around the back or arm area.

The extent of the injury is also important. A complete severing of the spinal cord will result in complete loss of function from that vertebra down. A partial severing or even bruising of the spinal cord results in varying degrees of mixed function and paralysis. A common misconception with tetraplegia is that the victim cannot move legs, arms, or any other major body regions; this is often not the case. Some tetraplegics can walk and use their hands, as though they did not have a spinal cord injury, while others may use wheelchairs and retain some functions in their arms and fingers; again, this varies based on the degree of damage to the spinal cord and is mostly seen with incomplete tetraplegia.

It is common to have partial movement in limbs, such as the ability to move the arms but not the hands, or to be able to use the fingers but not to the same extent as before the injury. Furthermore, the deficit in the limbs may not be the same on both sides of the body; either side may be more affected, depending on the location of the lesion on the spinal cord.

Another important factor is the possibility that the patient may exhibit sporadic movement in the affected areas. One of the main causes for this would be myoclonus, or muscle spasms. &quot;After a spinal cord injury, the normal flow of signals is disrupted, and the message does not reach the brain. Instead, the signals are sent back to the motor cells in the spinal cord and cause a reflex muscle spasm. This can result in a twitch, jerk or stiffening of the muscle.&quot;

==Causes==

Tetraplegia is caused by damage to the brain or the spinal cord at a high level. The injury, which is known as a lesion, causes the loss of partial or total function of all four limbs, meaning the arms and the legs. Typical causes of this damage are trauma (such as a traffic collision, diving into shallow water, a fall, a sports injury), disease (such as transverse myelitis, Guillain–Barré syndrome, multiple sclerosis, or polio), or congenital disorders (such as muscular dystrophy).

Tetraplegia is defined in many ways; C1–C4 usually affects arm movement more so than a C5–C7 injury; however, all tetraplegics have or have had some kind of finger dysfunction. So, it is not uncommon to have a tetraplegic with fully functional arms but no nervous control of their fingers and thumbs. It is possible to have a broken neck without becoming tetraplegic if the vertebrae are fractured or dislocated but the spinal cord is not damaged. Conversely, it is possible to injure the spinal cord without breaking the spine, for example when a ruptured disc or bone spur on the vertebra protrudes into the spinal column.

== Anatomy and function ==
Since tetraplegia is defined as dysfunction in the cervical spinal cord, this section will focus on the anatomy of the cervical spinal cord. To understand how tetraplegia presents after injury, it is imperative to have a broad knowledge of the cervical spinal roots and its many functions. In the cervical spine, nerve roots exit the spine above the associated vertebra (i.e. the C6 nerve root exits above the C6 vertebra). By evaluating what nerve root of the cervical spine is injured, the affected muscle groups and dermatomes can be determined. This informs the evaluator as to what activities may be limited as a result of the injury. This is typically done at 72 hours post-injury; exams done prior to this time have been found to be inaccurate due to the presence of swelling and other confounding factors. For example, an injury at the C6 nerve root level will affect the function of the triceps (elbow extension) but the biceps (elbow flexion) will be spared; in this case, an injury at the C6 root level affects all function at that level and below whereas the C5 nerve root, which controls the biceps, is spared since it is above the C6 level in the spinal column. When classifying an individual&#x27;s level of function, there are numerous functional assessment tools that may be used in a clinical setting and it is often up to the clinician&#x27;s discretion as to which tools are used. A comprehensive list of these tools may be found on the ShirleyRyan AbilityLab website. 
 

==Diagnosis==
===Classification===
Spinal cord injuries are classified as complete or incomplete by the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) classification. The ASIA scale grades patients based on their functional impairment as a result of the injury, grading a patient from A to D. This has considerable consequences for surgical planning and therapy. After a comprehensive neurologic exam testing segments of the body corresponding to spinal nerve roots, the examiner will determine the patient&#x27;s motor level and sensory level (e.g. motor level C6, sensory level C7). These levels are unique for the patient&#x27;s left and right side. This level is assigned based on the lowest (closest to the patient&#x27;s feet) intact motor and sensory level. After this assignment, a neurological level of injury (NLI) is determined. The NLI is the lowest segment with intact sensory and motor function provided there is normal sensory and motor function above this segment.

====Complete spinal-cord lesions====
As in the above ASIA chart, a complete spinal cord injury is any injury which has absent motor and sensory function in the sacral segments S4 and S5. This is verified during the physical exam by the absence of all three of: voluntary anal contraction, deep anal pressure, and pinprick+light touch sensation in the perineal area. S4 and S5 are both sacral nerve roots found at the lowest portion of the spinal cord. In simpler terms, &quot;complete&quot; is meant as a way to express that the spinal cord is injured such that no signal, motor or sensory, is carried to or from the level of injury to these lower levels of the spinal cord.

====Incomplete spinal-cord lesions====
Incomplete spinal cord injuries result in varied post injury presentations. There are three main syndromes described, depending on the exact site and extent of the lesion.
# Central cord syndrome: an injury to the central area of the spinal cord, most often seen as a result of a fall with subsequent hyperextension injury. This typically presents with weakness greater in the upper limbs than in the lower limbs.
# Brown-Séquard syndrome: hemisection of the spinal cord with resultant loss in: a.) ipsilateral proprioception, vibration, and motor control below the level of injury b.) complete sensory loss at the level of injury c.) contralateral pain and temperature loss.
# Anterior cord syndrome: a lesion of the anterior two-thirds of the spinal cord, most commonly due to ischemia. This typically presents with loss of pain, temperature, and motor function at and below the level of injury.
# Cauda equina syndrome: a lesion of the lumbosacral nerve roots that may spare the spinal cord. As these nerve roots are lower motor neurons, a flaccid lower limb paralysis is typically seen along with loss of bowel and bladder reflexes, varying degrees of impairment of sensation, and loss of sacral reflexes (bulbocavernosus reflex, anal wink).
# Conus medullaris syndrome: a lesion similar to cauda equina syndrome however this lesion is typically found higher in the cord. This presents clinically similarly to cauda equina syndrome however there may be intact sacral reflexes. Unlike cauda equina, the unique location of this syndrome leads it to present with mixed upper and lower motor neuron signs.

For most patients with ASIA A (complete) tetraplegia, ASIA B (incomplete) tetraplegia and ASIA C (incomplete) tetraplegia, the International Classification level of the patient can be established without great difficulty. The surgical procedures according to the International Classification level can be performed. In contrast, for patients with ASIA D (incomplete) tetraplegia it is difficult to assign an International Classification other than International Classification level X (others). Therefore, it is more difficult to decide which surgical procedures should be performed. A far more personalized approach is needed for these patients. Decisions must be based more on experience than on texts or journals.

The results of tendon transfers for patients with complete injuries are predictable. On the other hand, it is well known that muscles lacking normal excitation perform unreliably after surgical tendon transfers. Despite the unpredictable aspect in incomplete lesions, tendon transfers may be useful. The surgeon should be confident that the muscle to be transferred has enough power and is under good voluntary control. Pre-operative assessment is more difficult to assess in incomplete lesions.

Patients with an incomplete lesion also often need therapy or surgery before the procedure to restore function to correct the consequences of the injury. These consequences are hypertonicity/spasticity, contractures, painful hyperesthesias and paralyzed proximal upper limb muscles with distal muscle sparing.

Spasticity is a frequent consequence of incomplete injuries. Spasticity often decreases function, but sometimes a patient can control the spasticity in a way that it is useful to their function. The location and the effect of the spasticity should be analyzed carefully before treatment is planned. An injection of botulinum toxin (Botox) into spastic muscles is a treatment to reduce spasticity. This can be used to prevent muscle shortening and early contractures.

Over the last ten years, an increase in traumatic incomplete lesions is seen, due to the better protection in traffic.

==Treatment==

Upper limb paralysis refers to the loss of function of the elbow and hand. When upper limb function is absent as a result of a spinal cord injury it is a major barrier to regain autonomy. People with tetraplegia should be examined and informed concerning the options for reconstructive surgery of the tetraplegic arms and hands.

==Prognosis==

Delayed diagnosis of cervical spine injury has grave consequences for the victim. About one in 20 cervical fractures are missed and about two-thirds of these patients have further spinal-cord damage as a result. About 30% of cases of delayed diagnosis of cervical spine injury develop permanent neurological deficits. In high-level cervical injuries, total paralysis from the neck can result. High-level tetraplegics (C4 and higher) will likely need constant care and assistance in activities of daily living (ADLs), such as getting dressed, eating, and bowel/bladder care. Individuals with C5 injuries retain some function in their biceps, deltoids, and other muscles; they typically can perform many ADLs including feeding, bathing, and grooming but require total assistance with bowel/bladder care. The C6 level adds function in the extensor carpi radialis, longus, and other muscles allowing for wrist extension, scapular abduction, and wrist flexion; typically, these patients have modified independent feeding and grooming with adaptive equipment, independent with dressing, can use both a manual and power wheelchair but require assistance with some activities of daily living. The C7 level is where function is retained in the triceps allowing for arm extension; C7 is considered the key level at which most activities can be performed independently with a wheelchair and assistive devices; activities include feeding, grooming, dressing, light meal preparation, and transfers on level surfaces. Even in complete spinal cord injury, it is common for individuals to recover up to 1 level of motor function.

Even with &quot;complete&quot; injuries, in some rare cases, through intensive rehabilitation, function can be regained through &quot;rewiring&quot; neural connections, as in the case of actor Christopher Reeve.

In the case of cerebral palsy, which is caused by damage to the motor cortex either before, during (10%), or after birth, some people with incomplete tetraplegia are gradually able to learn to stand or walk through physical therapy.

Tetraplegics can improve muscle strength by performing resistance training at least three times per week. Combining resistance training with proper nutrition intake can greatly reduce co-morbidities such as obesity and type 2 diabetes.

==Epidemiology==

There are an estimated 17,700 spinal cord injuries each year in the United States; the total number of people affected by spinal cord injuries is estimated to be approximately 290,000 people.

In the US, spinal cord injuries alone cost approximately $40.5 billion each year, which is a 317 percent increase from costs estimated in 1998 ($9.7 billion).

The estimated lifetime costs for a 25-year-old in 2018 is $3.6 million when affected by low tetraplegia and $4.9 million when affected by high tetraplegia. In 2009, it was estimated that the lifetime care of a 25-year-old rendered with low tetraplegia was about $1.7 million, and $3.1 million with high tetraplegia.

About 1,000 people are affected each year in the UK (~1 in 60,000—assuming a population of 60 million).

==Terminology==
The condition of paralysis affecting four limbs is alternately termed &quot;tetraplegia&quot; or &quot;quadriplegia&quot;. Quadriplegia combines the Latin root &quot;quadra&quot;, for &quot;four&quot;, with the Greek root πληγία &quot;plegia&quot;, for &quot;paralysis&quot;. Tetraplegia uses the Greek root τετρα &quot;tetra&quot; for &quot;four&quot;. In the past, &quot;tetraplegia&quot; and &quot;quadriplegia&quot; were used interchangeably in the medical literature. Medical literature favors using &quot;tetraplegia&quot; as the standardized term, as it is frowned upon to mix Greek and Latin roots, although &quot;quadriplegia&quot; remains in use.

&quot;Tetraplegia&quot;, meaning the paralysis of four limbs, may be confused with &quot;tetraparesis&quot;, meaning the weakness of four limbs. In medicine, it is important to not use these terms when making a diagnosis. When diagnosing and classifying spinal cord injuries, the ASIA classification is used to distinguish between weakness vs. no weakness, and to classify neurologically complete vs. incomplete lesions. Use of &quot;tetraparesis&quot; is discouraged as it inaccurately describes an incomplete lesion and incorrectly implies tetraplegia applies only to cases of complete lesions.

<text>William Henry Marcus Miller Jr. (born June 14, 1959) is an American musician, songwriter, and record producer. He has worked with trumpeter Miles Davis, pianist Herbie Hancock, singer Luther Vandross, and saxophonists Wayne Shorter and David Sanborn, among others. He was the main songwriter and producer on three of Davis&#x27; albums: &quot;Tutu&quot; (1986), &quot;Music from Siesta&quot; (1987), and &quot;Amandla&quot; (1989). His collaboration with Vandross was especially close; he co-produced and served as the arranger for most of Vandross&#x27; albums, and he and Vandross co-wrote many of Vandross&#x27; songs, including the hits &quot;I Really Didn&#x27;t Mean It&quot;, &quot;Any Love&quot;, &quot;Power of Love/Love Power&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Want to Be a Fool&quot;. He also co-wrote the 1988 single &quot;Da Butt&quot; for Experience Unlimited.

== Early life ==
William Henry Marcus Miller Jr. was born in the Brooklyn borough of New York City on June 14, 1959. He grew up in a musical family; his father, William Miller, was a church organist and choir director. Through his father, he is the cousin of jazz pianist Wynton Kelly. He became classically trained as a clarinetist and later learned to play keyboards, saxophone, and guitar.

== Career ==

Miller began to work regularly in New York City, eventually playing bass and writing music for jazz flautist Bobbi Humphrey and keyboardist Lonnie Liston Smith. Miller&#x27;s earliest influences include James Jamerson and Larry Graham. He spent approximately 15 years performing as a session musician. During that time he also arranged and produced frequently. He was a member of the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; band between 1979 and 1981. He co-wrote Aretha Franklin&#x27;s &quot;Jump To It&quot; along with Luther Vandross, and sang alongside Vandross on the 1986 David Bowie single &quot;Underground&quot; from the movie &quot;Labyrinth&quot;. He has played bass on over 500 recordings, appearing on albums by such artists as Michael Jackson, Beyoncé, Herbie Hancock, Mariah Carey, Eric Clapton, The Crusaders, Wayne Shorter, McCoy Tyner, Frank Sinatra, George Benson, Dr. John, Aretha Franklin, Elton John, Joe Walsh, Jean-Michel Jarre, Grover Washington Jr., Donald Fagen, Bill Withers, Bernard Wright, Kazumi Watanabe, Chaka Khan, LL Cool J and Flavio Sala. He won the &quot;Most Valuable Player&quot; award (given by NARAS to recognize studio musicians) three years in a row and was subsequently awarded &quot;player emeritus&quot; status and retired from eligibility.

In the mid-1980s, Miller began a solo career as a funk/R&amp;B singer, with the albums &quot;Suddenly&quot; (1983) and &quot;Marcus Miller&quot; (1984). He was the main songwriter, producer and instrumentalist on these albums. He has since then released ten more solo albums, although he has only occasionally sung on these subsequent albums.

Between 1988 and 1990, Miller was the musical director and house band bass player (in the &quot;Sunday Night Band&quot;) during two seasons of the late-night TV show &quot;Sunday Night&quot; (also known as &quot;Night Music&quot;) on NBC, hosted by David Sanborn and Jools Holland.

As a composer, Miller co-wrote and produced several songs on the Miles Davis album &quot;Tutu&quot;, including the title track. He also composed &quot;Chicago Song&quot; for David Sanborn and co-wrote &quot;&#x27;Til My Baby Comes Home&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Over Now&quot;, &quot;For You to Love&quot;, and &quot;Power of Love&quot; for Luther Vandross. Miller also wrote &quot;Da Butt&quot;, which was featured in Spike Lee&#x27;s &quot;School Daze&quot;. In addition, he composed and provided spoken vocals on &quot;Burn it Up&quot;, which was featured on Najee&#x27;s 1992 album &quot;Just An Illusion&quot;.

In 1997, he played bass guitar and bass clarinet in the supergroup Legends, featuring Eric Clapton (guitars and vocals), Joe Sample (piano), David Sanborn (alto sax) and Steve Gadd (drums). It was an 11-date tour of major jazz festivals in Europe. In 2008 Miller formed another supergroup, SMV, with fellow bassists Stanley Clarke and Victor Wooten, for a world tour lasting 18 months. He produced SMV&#x27;s first release, Thunder. In the summer of 2011, Miller toured alongside Herbie Hancock and Wayne Shorter celebrating Miles Davis on the 20th anniversary of his death.

In 2017, Miller, along with Common, headlined the Playboy Jazz Festival.

Miller hosts a jazz history and influences show called &quot;Miller Time with Marcus Miller&quot; on the Real Jazz channel of Sirius XM Holdings satellite radio system. In addition to his recording and performance career, Miller has established a parallel career as a film score composer. He has written numerous scores for films, including films directed by Reginald Hudlin and Chris Rock.

== Awards and honors ==
Miller has been nominated for numerous Grammy Awards as a producer for Miles Davis, Luther Vandross, David Sanborn, Bob James, Chaka Khan and Wayne Shorter, and has won two Grammys. He won a Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Song in 1992, for Luther Vandross&#x27; &quot;Power of Love&quot; and in 2001 he won for Best Contemporary Jazz Album for his seventh solo instrumental album, &quot;M²&quot;. His 2015 album &quot;Afrodeezia&quot; earned a Grammy Award nomination for Best Contemporary Instrumental Album.
In 2012 Miller was appointed a UNESCO Artist for Peace, supporting and promoting the UNESCO Slave Route Project.

In December 2021, Bass Player magazine awarded Miller a Lifetime Achievement Award.

== Instruments ==
Miller plays a transparent blonde finish 1977 Fender Jazz Bass that was modified by luthier Roger Sadowsky with the addition of a Stars Guitar and later a Bartolini TCT preamp so he could control his sound in the studio. Fender started to produce a Marcus Miller signature Fender Jazz Bass in four-string (made in Japan) and five-string (made in U.S) versions. Later, Fender moved the production of the four-string to their Mexico factory and discontinued both four- and five-string models in 2015. DR Strings also produced a series of Marcus Miller signature stainless steel strings known as &quot;Fat Beams&quot;, which come in a variety of sizes.
In 2015, Dunlop began producing Marcus Miller Super Bright bass strings which Miller switched to.

<text>Kjeller Airfield (; ) is a military and general aviation aerodrome located in Kjeller in Lillestrøm in Akershus county, Norway. Situated on the outskirts of Lillestrøm, it is east northeast of Oslo, making it the aerodrome closest to the capital. The field has a single asphalt runway numbered 12–30, with a declared distance of . The airport is owned by the Norwegian Defence Logistics Organization, while civilian operations are carried out by Kjeller Aero Senter. The main military activity is the Aerospace Industrial Maintenance Norway, the main maintenance facility for the Royal Norwegian Air Force (RNoAF).

The aerodrome became the first in Norway when it was established in September 1912 to serve the Norwegian Army Air Service. The break-out of World War I resulted in a major expansion of the airfield, followed by military aircraft factory Kjeller Flyfabrikk moving to Kjeller in 1916. Gradual expansions took place in the following decades. The airfield was occupied by the Luftwaffe on 10 April 1940, resulting in Junkers, Daimler-Benz, BMW and Brinker Eisenwerk establishing various maintenance facilities. After liberation in 1945, the RNoAF converted Kjeller to a maintenance base and placed the Air Force Logistics Command there from 1952. Runway expansions took place in 1951, 1959 and 1975.

==History==
===Establishment===
Kjeller Airfield was the first aerodrome established in Norway. The need for an aerodrome for the Norwegian Army Air Service arose in September 1912, after the first four pilots had been trained and the two first aircraft, Maurice Farman Longhorns, were obtained. Two of the pilots went scouting around Lillestrøm on 8 September to find a suitable location for an airfield, and settled on Kjeller after two days of reconnaissance. The area was selected because of its vicinity to the capital and its flat geography. The first aircraft, &quot;Ganger Rolf&quot;, was hauled to Kjeller by horse on 14 September, where it was assembled and flew for the first time on 21 September. Construction of a hangar was subcontracted to Strømmens Trævarefabrik on 13 September, and the structure was completed on 27 September. The first flight to another aerodrome took place on 3 October, when a plane flew to Trondheim, piloted by Einar Sem-Jacobsen, the commander at Kjeller.

At first the airfield was no more than a plot . The army rented space at Kjeller Farm, which was owned by M. H. Brøther and Minister of Foreign Affairs Nils Claus Ihlen. The farm had a telephone and provided office space and living spaces for the airfield staff. The army thus hired a cook for the establishment. Aircraft would often land at various fields in Skedsmo as part of the training. The airport was gradually expanded and within a year of the opening measured . Polar explorer Roald Amundsen started his flight training in 1913 and took Norway&#x27;s first civilian pilot&#x27;s license on 11 June 1914. On 18 August 1913 two departments were established at Kjeller: a technical and a tactical. The former had the responsibility for introductory training and maintenance, while the latter had advanced training and flight operations. These two divisions remained until they were merged in 1917.

With the break-out of World War I in 1914 the airfield became subject to a major expansion. In two years the field was expanded from rented land to owned land, of which the airport itself. This took place by the state buying a lot on the other side of the creek of Sogna. Hence there were two areas of the aerodrome, which both served as runways. The original was known as Skoleplassen, the newer as Granasletta, later as the &quot;outer airport&quot;. At the time the border between the then independent municipalities of Skedsmo and Lillestrøm ran through the airport. The airport was organized such that it was supposed to cultivate spare areas on its land. The army expected that this was done such that it gave earnings, while keeping it suitable for flights.

The army established a pilot school on 1 July 1914, which initially accepted four regular students and one mechanic. By September both Longhorns had been wrecked and written off, stopping further training. By then only one pupil had completed the course. Training resumed after new aircraft were delivered in mid-1915. Hærens Flyvemaskinfabrikk, which had been established in 1914 in Sagene in Oslo, moved to Kjeller in May 1916, at the same time the airport was flooded. Four sheds were constructed for the factory. By 1917 a long hangar had been completed.

===Early years===
From 1 July 1916 a one-year military pilot training school was established and one of the hangars was converted to a barracks. Four hundred people applied and twenty were selected for the first class. The first seventeen were certified in June 1917, using Maurice Farman Shorthorns, and organized as its own department. From 1919 the Kjeller-built FF 5 were taken into use. In addition to pilots, the school was responsible for training mechanics. Most years the school would carry out a major four-week exercise in February–March at a different location than the airport.

The Søndenfjeldske Air Wing was formally established in 1917, but did not become operative until 1919, when it had accumulated a combined twenty Farman F.40 and Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2. A new barracks was completed in early 1918. On 31 May 1919 the a fire struck two of the hangars, burning them to the ground. The insurance money was used to build two new hangars, which were completed in 1923. The school started using the Kjeller-built FF 9 trainer planes from 1922. By 1921 the army concluded that the quality of the aircraft being manufactured at Kjeller did not meet that of internationally produced machines. Hærens Flyvemaskinfabrikk therefore started license-production of aircraft from 1924.

The air wing carried out trial scheduled flights to Hamar and Fredrikstad during the summer of 1920, using the two-seat BE-2s. Eighty-four trips were flown, carrying thirty-five passengers and with five accidents. The air wings main exercise took place in July and August every year. It received Bristol F.2B Fighters in 1921, Hannover Cl.V in 1924 and Fokker C.V in 1928. The barracks was expanded in 1926 and again in 1930. Funding for a garrison at Kjeller was secured from 1933, allowing a permanent staff and the establishment of a full-time workshop.
The airfield was struck by heavy flooding in 1916, 1927, 1931 and 1934. Because of the recurring floods, the army decided to conduct drainage of the field. Because the creek Sogna flowed between the two sections of the airport, it was desired to build a connection between the two. Sogna was placed in a pipeline, allowing it to bypass the aerodrome on its way to Nitelva. Construction started in 1929, but lack of funding delayed completion until 1934. From 1932 the school introduced license-built variants of the De Havilland Moth and Tiger Moth.

In 1933 there were various proposals to start commercial flights to Oslo. KLM investigated Kjeller as a possible site for the extension of their service to Copenhagen, but found that Kjeller did not meet their standards. Thus by 1935 the runway had been expanded to . Although sown with grass, the runway often could not withstand the landing forces of the aircraft. The airfield owner was also concerned with floods and decided to elevate the runway by by filling it up with garbage from Oslo. A trial was run with 5,000 tonnes and described as a success by the army, proposing that a spur from the Trunk Line be built to Kjeller for all of Oslo&#x27;s of garbage be disposed at the airfield. However local residents complained about the stench and effectively halted the project.

Lufthansa started a service to Kjeller during the summer of 1936 as a tentative solution while their seaplane was being overhauled. They put a seventeen-passenger Junkers Ju 52 into the service to London, Copenhagen, Hamburg and Amsterdam. The service was especially popular with travelers to London, as they did not have to transfer at Copenhagen, and the route saw a typical ten to twelve passengers for each of the daily departures. Ground transport was carried out by motor coach, which took twenty-five minutes from Oslo. This was about the same as the ferry used to Gressholmen Airport. Regular services started on 1 June 1938 and lasted until 10 October. The following year the route was transferred to the newly opened Oslo Airport, Fornebu. Lufthansa also carried out a trial flight with a Focke-Wulf Fw 200 on 13 August 1938.

===World War II===
On the day before Operation Weserübung, which started the German occupation of Norway on 8 April 1940, warning was received by the air base commander, Harald Normann. The aircraft were evacuated and camouflaged. At the time the airfield was covered in snow, forcing the aircraft to use skis. A large shipment of technical equipment had just been shipped to Sola Air Station, which was unsuccessfully attempted recalled. At two o&#x27;clock in the morning of 9 April the aircraft were commanded to fly to Steinsfjorden at sunrise. The first departed at 05:15.

By the time the Luftwaffe attack had set in at 7:55, seven aircraft had been evacuated and were used throughout the Norwegian Campaign. One person was killed when the Heinkel He 111 aircraft from Kampfgeschwader 4 bombed the aerodrome to shatters. Because the battalion was the initial target, people at the aircraft factory had time to evacuate. The bombers came in at altitudes below , occasionally as low as . The anti-aircraft guns fired 97 shots, but were unable to shoot down any aircraft, although unconfirmed hits were reported. After three hours of attack the airfield lay in ruins. Minister of Defense Birger Ljungberg announced at 14:07 that Oslo, including Kjeller Airfield, was regarded as lost and all units were ordered to cease fire. However, machine gun fire hit a German Ju 52 transport aircraft at 15:15.

To support the scrambling of men at Gardermoen Air Station and Trandum, it was important to delay a German offensive across Nitelva. Thus one hundred men from the airport were, against the orders of the minister, commanded to put up a defense along the river. The assignment was difficult as there was a large amount of private vehicles evacuating individuals from the capital. The official surrender of the airport and factory took place on 10 April at 08:30. Civilian employees were given a few weeks off before they were ordered to clean up the facilities. Military employees were eventually sent to their hometowns. The first German aircraft, a Ju 52, landed at Kjeller on 10 April at 12:30. After mounting skis it was able to depart three and a half hours later.

During the occupation the aerodrome was under various military administration within the Luftwaffe. Initially the field was covered in snow and thus not suitable for aviation. However, it was often used for accommodation for pilots, as the quarters at Fornebu was packed. The only aircraft stationed were a group of communication aircraft, at first designated Verbindungsstaffel 4, later Verbindungsstaffel Norwegen. This consisted of various aircraft, such as the Ju 52, the Fieseler Fi 156 Storch and Siebel Si 204D and were stationed from 10 May. After the snow disappeared the German forces started construction of a wooden runway. First the ground was leveled, then a thick layer of gravel was placed and then a wooden cover. The work also included a dam to protect the airport from flooding.

The main Axis used the aerodrome was to serve as a forward mechanical center for Norway. The decision was largely based on the presence of the aircraft factory. A new hall was built, which along with upgrades to the existing gave four halls. In addition a paint shop and large warehouse were built. New workshops had to be built for instruments, radio and electrical equipment. From the summer of 1940 the factory became a division of Junkers Flugzeug- und Motorenwerke. It relied largely on the existing Norwegian workforce, but was forced to extensive retraining because of the advanced construction of the German aircraft. Junkers eventually withdrew and was replaced by Brinker Eisenwerk. The operation kept going until 1944. There was also established two separate motor repair shops, one operated by Daimler-Benz and one operated by Bayerische Motorenwerke (BMW). Both received new concrete halls. The work at the various companies was often met with passive resistance, such as through slow work, demands for work to be redone and occasionally sabotage.
The first bombing of Kjeller by the Allies was planned for 16 November 1943, but canceled because of the cloudy weather. Two days later the Eighth Air Force of the United States Air Force carried out an attack on Kjeller, using 102 B-24 Liberators to deliver 838 high-explosive bombs. The civilian workforce was away from work as there was a German military exercise being carried out, under supervision of General Nikolaus von Falkenhorst. This caused the anti-aircraft guns to be loaded with blanks and that no-one suspected that it was a real attack until the bombs started raining. Russian prisoners of war were used to clear the undetonated shells. Both Daimler-Benz&#x27;s workshop and one of the halls were destroyed, as were an estimated twelve aircraft and the rest of the buildings suffered significant damages. German reports concluded with few casualties, while Swedish reports estimate ca. 200.

In the Luftwaffe retaliation, six Liberators were shot down over Skagerrak and four escaped to Sweden. The raid crippled the maintenance: Daimler-Benz moved to Sandefjord, while BMW moved to Alnabru in Oslo. Brinker Eisenwerk remained and soon resumed operations. A new raid was therefore carried out on 20 April 1944 by No. 5 Group of the Royal Air Force, using 51 Avro Lancaster bombers. Twelve Norwegian were killed and the raid effectively stopped all maintenance activity at Kjeller until the end of the war. The aerodrome was surrendered to Norway on 9 May 1945, after the end of the war.

===Reconstruction===

The air base had a capacity for 2,500 men at the end of the war, although the bombing and lack of subsequent repair had left the field in a dilapidated state. The aircraft factory had been dismantled for most of its equipment. It was therefore converted to a pure maintenance facility which was to serve as the main workshop for the newly established Royal Norwegian Air Force (RNoAF). It was hence only to be kept airworthy to such a degree that aircraft could land for maintenance. The workshop&#x27;s first major task was the renovation of seventeen Fieseler Storchs. The air force established its mechanical school at Kjeller in October 1945 as did the Air Force Communications and Radar School. As the space was limited the technical school was moved to Kjevik Air Station and the latter to Lutvann in February 1946.

The wooden runway caused massive maintenance costs and required the entire strip to be inspected daily for loose planks. By 1948 it was in so poor condition that the air force decided to replace it with a permanent surface. The ground consisted of clay and sand which frost heaving, requiring the upper layer of earthwork to be replaced. Because the German runway had required planes to approach close to Nittebergåsen, the runway was moved eight decrees counterclockwise to meet civilian aviation requirements from the International Civil Aviation Organization. Removal of the wooden runway started on 23 April 1949, and during this work it was discovered that the runway had been mined with dynamite. Drainage started on 10 May and leveling on 8 June. A thick layer of concrete was poured starting on 12 July. When it was completed on 9 October, the new runway was . The strip was officially opened on 15 October.

This allowed a De Havilland Vampire to land and the maintenance division could start servicing jet aircraft. For a semester in 1950, Kjeller was used as a recruit and early pilot school for the air force. More than one hundred people were admitted and the training was the basis for sending them for full education in the United States. Kjeller Flyklubb was established as a civilian aero club in 1950, bought a plane and started pilot training at Kjeller. However, there was little cooperation from the military, who preferred that Kjeller not be used for civilian activities, limiting their activities.

With the order of new F-84 Thunderjets and F-86 Sabres, Kjeller Air Base would need significantly longer runway to take down the fighter jets. In 1951 a runway extension to was proposed, which was NATO standard. The proposal received massive local protests, as it would force the runway to cut through Storgaten, the main road to Lillestrøm, and the Trunk Line, as well as significant areas around Åråsen, reaching all the way to Leira. The military rejected extending westwards, as a crossing of Nitelva would be prohibitively expensive. The debate would continue for several years, including proposals to close the aerodrome.

As part of the establishment of the air force, a material division was established in 1952. Initially known as Kjeller Depot, it became the Air Force Logistics Command from 1 October. At the same time the aircraft factory officially ceased to exist and was merged to the Maintenance Group. However, without a longer runway, the Logistics Command was considered moved to Flesland Air Station or Værnes Air Station. The military accepted gradual decreases to the runway length, first to and then . Lillestrøm Municipal Council approved plans for a runway on 2 May 1958. Although this would spare the main road, it would still have to be closed during take-off and landing of jets.

Construction started on 25 August and saw an upgrade to the existing runway through a layer of crushed stone being laid on top of the concrete. The runway was extended by ca. in each direction, and received a layer of construction aggregate. The entire runway was asphalted, creating a surface. The work was completed on 1 June 1959. During construction the airfield has been used for 115 aircraft movements.

===Joint operations===
The aero club, which changed its name to Nedre Romerike Flyklubb in 1959, was allowed to operate out of Kjeller from 1964. The air force organized its maintenance such that service on seaplanes and helicopters was carried out at Karljohansvern in Horten. This changed in 1965, when also maintenance of helicopters was carried out at Kjeller. During the 1960s the Norwegian Army&#x27;s direct support division for Project Nike was placed at Kjeller Air Base.

The runway was further extended all the way to Storgaten between 2 and 29 April 1975, to create a overrun. By 1981 the new F-16 Fighting Falcons needed their first overhaul at Kjeller. The runway was by then found unsuitable, as it has cracks and loose parts which could easily be sucked into the engines. During the summer two layers of asphalt were laid and the runway was extended westwards all the way to Nitelva. The runway&#x27;s total length was then , but the declared distance was reduced to . The work was completed in time for the first F-16 to land on 1 September.

==Accidents and incidents==
The first lethal accident took place on 1 May 1917, when a Farman F.40 crashed during an attempt to reach the Scandinavian elevation record of . The accident was caused by a weak steel tube in the tailplane. The next accident occurred on 23 August near Tangen. The first passenger to be killed was a 17-year-old woman on 1 April 1919, when an Avro 504 spiraled down in an accident where the pilot was able to walk away nearly unhurt. Lethal accidents were frequent and by the break-out of the Second World War nineteen military pilots had been killed in accidents at or around the airport.

He is widely considered to be one of the most influential songwriters in the history of British rock music, cited by numerous major subsequent artists as an influence.

Gallagher began playing the guitar at the age of twelve, and became a roadie and technician for Inspiral Carpets when he was 21. He learnt that his younger brother Liam had joined a band called the Rain, which eventually became Oasis; Liam invited him to join the group as manager. After rejecting the offer, Gallagher agreed to join the band, on the condition that he would take creative control of the group and become its sole songwriter and lead guitarist.

The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot; (1994), was a widespread critical and commercial success. Their second album, &quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot; (1995), reached the top of the album charts in many countries, and their third studio album, &quot;Be Here Now&quot; (1997), became the fastest-selling album in UK chart history. Britpop eventually declined in popularity, and Oasis failed to revive it, though their final two albums, &quot;Don&#x27;t Believe the Truth&quot; (2005) and &quot;Dig Out Your Soul&quot; (2008), were hailed as their best efforts in over a decade. In August 2009, following an altercation with his brother, Gallagher announced his departure from Oasis. He went on to form Noel Gallagher&#x27;s High Flying Birds, with whom he has released four studio albums.

Oasis&#x27;s time was marked by turbulence, especially during the peak of Britpop, during which Gallagher was involved in several disputes with Liam. Their conflicts and wild lifestyles regularly made tabloid headlines. The band had a rivalry with fellow Britpop band Blur. Gallagher himself was often regarded as a pioneer and spearhead of the Britpop movement. Many have praised his songwriting, with Beatles producer George Martin calling him &quot;the finest songwriter of his generation&quot;. Conversely, he was voted the most overrated guitarist of the last millennium in a 1999 poll, which he named as the accolade he most enjoyed receiving, and the ninth-most-overrated ever in a 2002 listener survey.

==Early life==

Noel Thomas David Gallagher was born on 29 May 1967 in the Longsight area of Manchester, to Irish Catholic parents Peggy (née Sweeney) and Thomas Gallagher. Aside from Liam, he also has an older brother named Paul. Shortly after Liam&#x27;s birth in 1972, the family moved to Ashby Avenue and then Cranwell Drive in the Manchester suburb of Burnage. As the eldest child, Paul was given his own bedroom while Noel had to share his bedroom with Liam.

Described as &quot;the weirdo in the family&quot; by Liam, he was known to be a daydreamer and a loner who was often reclusive due to his unhappy childhood. Both he and Paul were beaten regularly by their father, who was an alcoholic. In the documentary &quot;&quot;, Noel quipped that his father &quot;beat the talent into him&quot;, and that he had never acknowledged or discussed the abuse with a mental health doctor or in a therapeutic setting. Both he and Paul struggled with stammers which were made worse by their father&#x27;s abuse and were resolved with weekly sessions in four years of speech therapy.

In 1976, Peggy acquired legal separation from Thomas, and in 1982 she left him, taking her three sons with her and continuing to raise them alone as a single mother.

As teenagers, the Gallagher brothers were regular truants, often getting into trouble with the police. When his mother took a job in the school canteen, Gallagher ensured that he stopped by to visit her during lunch before skipping the rest of the day. He was expelled from school at the age of 15 for allegedly throwing a flour bomb at a teacher, though he has since said that he did not do it and that he was merely present in the classroom when it happened. He used to hang around with the Manchester City hooligan firms Maine Line Crew, Under-5s, and Young Guvnors in the 1980s, and received six months&#x27; probation at the age of 14 for robbing a corner shop. It was during this period of probation, with little else to do, that he first began to teach himself to play guitar, a gift from his mother. He would play his favourite songs from the radio, and was particularly inspired by the debut of the Smiths on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in 1983, performing their single &quot;This Charming Man&quot;. He later said that, from that day on, he &quot;wanted to be Johnny Marr&quot;. He also appeared (and scored) for Manchester Gaelic football team CLG Oisín at Croke Park in Dublin in 1983.

As teenagers, the Gallagher brothers maintained limited contact with their father and secured jobs in construction, but the relationship between father and sons continued to be tempestuous; Gallagher said, &quot;Because we were always arguing, we&#x27;d still be working at nine o&#x27;clock every night.&quot; Having left his father&#x27;s building company, he took a job at another building firm sub-contracted to British Gas. He sustained an injury when a heavy cap from a steel gas pipe landed on his right foot. Following a period of recuperation, he was offered a less physically demanding role in the company&#x27;s storehouse, freeing up time for him to practise the guitar and write songs. He said he had written at least three of the songs on &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot; in this storehouse, including &quot;Live Forever&quot;. He later called the storehouse &quot;The Hit Hut&quot; and claimed the walls were painted gold. Much of the late 1980s found Gallagher unemployed and living in a bedsit, occupying his time by using recreational drugs, writing songs, and playing the guitar.

In May 1988, Gallagher met guitarist Graham Lambert of Inspiral Carpets during a Stone Roses show. The two became acquainted and Gallagher became a regular at Inspiral Carpets shows. When he heard singer Steve Holt was leaving the band, he auditioned to be the new vocalist. He was unsuccessful, but became part of the band&#x27;s road crew for the next two years. He struck up a friendship with monitor engineer Mark Coyle over their love of the Beatles, and the pair spent soundchecks dissecting the group&#x27;s songs.

Around the time of his work with the Inspiral Carpets, Gallagher – who had already begun writing his own songs – answered an advert in a local newspaper asking for a collaborator and to record some demos. These recordings, featuring tracks such as &#x27;Baj&#x27;, &#x27;What&#x27;s It Got To Do With You?&#x27; and &#x27;Womb To Tomb&#x27; were Gallagher&#x27;s first steps into recording his own music.

==Career==
===Oasis===
In 1991, Gallagher returned from an American tour with the Inspiral Carpets to find that his brother Liam had become a singer with a local band called the Rain. He attended one of their concerts at Manchester&#x27;s Boardwalk but was unimpressed by the group&#x27;s act. After rejecting an offer from Liam to be the band&#x27;s manager, Gallagher agreed to join the band, on the condition that he would take creative control of the group and become its sole songwriter. According to another source, Noel told Liam and the rest of the group after having heard them play for the first time: &quot;Let me write your songs and I&#x27;ll take you to superstardom, or else you&#x27;ll rot here in Manchester&quot;. His control over the band in its early years earned him the nickname &quot;The Chief&quot;.

In May 1993, the band heard that a record executive from Creation Records would be scouting for talent at King Tut&#x27;s in Glasgow. Together, they found the money to hire a van and make the six-hour journey. When they arrived, they were refused entry to the club because no one notified the venue that Oasis had been added to the bill. The band eventually secured the opening slot and played a four-song set that impressed Creation founder Alan McGee.

McGee then took the &quot;Live Demonstration&quot; tape to Sony America and invited Oasis to meet with him a week later in London, at which point they were signed to a six-album contract. Gallagher has since claimed that he only had six songs written at the time, and has put his success in the interview down to &quot;bullshitting&quot;. McGee believes that when they met, Gallagher had fifty or so songs written, and merely lied about how prolific he had been following the contract. Richard Ashcroft was so impressed with Oasis during the time that he invited them to tour with his band the Verve as an opening act.

Gallagher said he wrote Oasis&#x27; first single, &quot;Supersonic&quot;, in &quot;the time it takes to play the song&quot;. &quot;Supersonic&quot; was released in early 1994 and peaked at No. 31 on the official UK charts. The single was later followed by Oasis&#x27; debut album &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot;, which was released in August 1994 and was a critical and commercial success. It became the fastest-selling debut album in British history at the time and entered the UK charts at number one. Despite their rapidly growing popularity, Gallagher briefly left Oasis in 1994 during their first American tour. The conditions were poor, and he felt the American audience—still preoccupied with grunge and metal—did not understand the band. Gallagher stated that his early songs, especially &quot;Live Forever&quot;, were written to refute grunge&#x27;s pessimism. Tensions mounted between him and Liam, culminating in a fight after a disastrous gig in Los Angeles. Having effectively decided to quit the music industry, he flew to San Francisco without telling the band, management or the crew. It was during this time that Gallagher wrote &quot;Talk Tonight&quot; as a &quot;thank you&quot; for the girl he stayed with, who &quot;talked him from off the ledge&quot;. He was tracked down by Creation&#x27;s Tim Abbot, and during a trip by the pair to Las Vegas, Gallagher decided to continue with the band. He reconciled with his brother and the tour resumed in Minneapolis.
Gallagher followed up the debut in 1995 with Oasis&#x27; first UK number-one single in &quot;Some Might Say&quot;. This preceded their second album, &quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot;, released later that year. Though it suffered initial critical apathy, the album became the second fastest-selling album ever in the UK, entering the UK album charts at number one and peaking at number four on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart.

The success of Oasis and his newfound fame and fortune were not lost on Gallagher, and both he and his brother became famous for their &quot;rock and roll lifestyle&quot;. They drank heavily, abused drugs, fought fans, critics, peers, and each other, and made celebrity friends such as Ian Brown, Paul Weller, Mani, Mick Jagger, Craig Cash, Kate Moss and Johnny Depp. Gallagher spent extravagantly, buying various cars and a swimming pool despite the fact he can neither drive nor swim. He named his house in Belsize Park in London Supernova Heights (after the song &quot;Champagne Supernova&quot;), and his two cats &quot;Benson&quot; and &quot;Hedges&quot; after his favourite brand of cigarettes.

Oasis went on to have greater success with their next two singles, &quot;Wonderwall&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back in Anger&quot;, charting at number two and number one, respectively, the former becoming their sole top 10 hit in the US. Originally, Noel had wanted to take lead vocals on &quot;Wonderwall&quot;, but Liam insisted on singing it. As compensation, Noel decided he would sing lead vocals on &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back in Anger&quot;. 1995 also saw Gallagher play two songs for the charity album &quot;Help!&quot;: &quot;Fade Away&quot;, accompanied by friend and Oasis fan Johnny Depp and Depp&#x27;s then-girlfriend Kate Moss; and the Beatles&#x27; 1969 hit &quot;Come Together&quot;, along with Paul Weller, Paul McCartney and others in a supergroup called Smokin&#x27; Mojo Filters. He began collaborating with the Chemical Brothers, Ian Brown, the Stands, the Prodigy and Weller, amongst others. Gallagher became so influential that a June 1996 &quot;NME&quot; article argued that &quot;if Noel Gallagher, the most successful songwriter of his generation, champions a group, then said group are guaranteed more mainstream kudos and, quite possibly, more sales. And since Noel has taken to championing only five or six groups, then it&#x27;s a powerful cabal he&#x27;s promoting.&quot; The &quot;NME&quot; article grouped the bands Gallagher praised, including the Boo Radleys, Ocean Colour Scene, and Cast, under the banner of &quot;Noelrock&quot;. John Harris typified these bands, and Gallagher, of &quot;sharing a dewy-eyed love of the 1960s, a spurning of much beyond rock&#x27;s most basic ingredients, and a belief in the supremacy of &#x27;real music&#x27;&quot;.

In March 1996, Gallagher and his brother Liam met their father again when the &quot;News of the World&quot; paid him to go to their hotel during a tour. He left for his room, later commenting &quot;as far as I&#x27;m concerned, I haven&#x27;t got a father. He&#x27;s not a father to me, y&#x27;know? I don&#x27;t respect him in any way whatsoever&quot;. In August 1996, Oasis sold out two nights at Knebworth, playing to over 250,000 fans. Following the worldwide success of &quot;Morning Glory?&quot;, &quot;Be Here Now&quot; (1997) became Oasis&#x27; most eagerly anticipated album to date. As with the previous two albums, all the tracks were written by Gallagher. After an initial blaze of publicity, positive critical reviews, and commercial success, the album failed to live up to long-term expectations, and public goodwill towards &quot;Be Here Now&quot; was short-lived. The album was ultimately regarded by many as a bloated, over-indulgent version of Oasis, which Gallagher has since blamed on the drug-addicted state and indifference of the band at the time. While the album was a recordbreaker, selling 813,000 copies in seven days, Gallagher has been critical of the album&#x27;s popularity, saying: &quot;Just because you sell lots of records, it doesn&#x27;t mean to say you&#x27;re any good. Look at Phil Collins.&quot;

Gallagher began to have drug-induced panic attacks during this period. His depression and paranoia inspired the song &quot;Gas Panic!&quot;, subsequently included on the 2000 album &quot;Standing on the Shoulder of Giants&quot;. He said he stopped using illicit drugs on 5 June 1998. Gallagher stated in 2001, &quot;I liked drugs, I was good at them. But I&#x27;d had panic attacks for about a year and I stopped because I wanted to. After you make the decision, it is quite easy.&quot; Of the period between 1993 and 1998, Gallagher said, &quot;I can hardly remember a thing.&quot; In a 2020 interview Gallagher said that once, during that period, he ended up in a hospital in Detroit for an overdose, and that the doctors didn&#x27;t understand the situation because of their misunderstanding for Gallagher&#x27;s accent. He told about the experience: &quot;You know, imagine having the psychosis and going to a hospital and having to go through a metal detector and someone asking you what&#x27;s wrong with you? And they don&#x27;t understand the words you&#x27;re saying because of your accent. They&#x27;re just like, &#x27;Okay, I&#x27;m gonna go get someone else. Hang on a minute&#x27;&quot;.
After the hype surrounding the release of &quot;Be Here Now&quot; had started to wane, critical response to the band became calmer and more considered, leading to a media backlash. In 1997, Gallagher was criticised for attending a high-profile and well-publicised media party at 10 Downing Street, hosted by the new Prime Minister, Tony Blair, along with other celebrities and industry figures who had supported New Labour in the run-up to the general election. Liam and Blur&#x27;s Damon Albarn declined their invitations, with Albarn commenting &quot;Enjoy the schmooze, comrade&quot;. The perception of Gallagher as someone now mixing with politicians and a famous photograph of him sipping champagne with Blair conflicted with the &quot;working class hero&quot; status championed through songs such as &quot;Up in the Sky&quot;.

In 1999, rhythm guitarist Paul &quot;Bonehead&quot; Arthurs quit the band, with bassist Paul McGuigan following soon afterwards. As a result, the fourth studio album, &quot;Standing on the Shoulder of Giants&quot;, was recorded by just the Gallaghers and drummer Alan White, with Noel playing all guitar parts. He later commented on Bonehead&#x27;s departure, &quot;It&#x27;s hardly Paul McCartney leaving the Beatles, is it?&quot;. After the recording sessions were completed, Gallagher selected Gem Archer to join in place of Bonehead.

Later that year Alan McGee decided to leave Creation and sold the rest of his 51% stake in the label to Sony. Gallagher took this opportunity to set up Big Brother Recordings, which took over Oasis&#x27; distribution in the UK, but Sony imprint Epic Records continued to handle the band&#x27;s international distribution. Around the time of the album&#x27;s release, Andy Bell, formerly of Ride, joined the band as bassist. In 2001, Gallagher formed his label, Sour Mash Records, which released records by the likes of Shack and Proud Mary. The incorporation of the label followed Gallagher&#x27;s debut as a producer, working with Proud Mary on their debut, &quot;The Same Old Blues&quot;. In 2003, Gallagher received songwriting credits from Girls Aloud&#x27;s single &quot;Life Got Cold&quot; due to the song&#x27;s guitar riff being similar to &quot;Wonderwall&quot;.

In late 2006, Gallagher toured the UK, Europe, Japan, America and Australia in a series of acclaimed intimate semi-acoustic gigs accompanied by Gem Archer and Terry Kirkbride on percussion. The show proved successful and a further series of sets took place in 2007. March 2007 saw Gallagher perform in Moscow—the first time an Oasis member has performed in Russia. Gallagher dismissed claims that he was planning to embark on a solo career. In early 2007, Gallagher joined the rest of Oasis to collect the &quot;Outstanding Contribution to Music&quot; Award at the Brit Awards 2007.

Gallagher, along with the band recorded their seventh studio album between 2007 and the next year at Abbey Road Studios and in Los Angeles. At the end of the summer of 2008 the band began a tour that lasted 12 months. In March 2009, &quot;The Times&quot; in conjunction with iTunes released a selection of live recordings by Noel Gallagher taken from his semi-acoustic performance at the Royal Albert Hall on 27 March 2007 in aid of Teenage Cancer Trust. &quot;The Dreams We Have as Children&quot; features classic and rare tracks from the Oasis canon along with several cover versions of some of Gallagher&#x27;s favourite artists.

On 28 August 2009, Gallagher quit Oasis after a fight with his brother, Liam. Shortly before midnight on Friday, Gallagher posted a statement on his message board called &quot;Tales from the Middle of Nowhere&quot; on the band&#x27;s website announcing his departure.

The band announced a 2025 reunion world tour in August 2024.

===Solo career and High Flying Birds===

Gallagher&#x27;s first concerts without Oasis were announced on 1 February 2010 to be at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall on 25 and 26 March 2010 for Teenage Cancer Trust. He was supported by the Courteeners and Plan B, respectively. Terry Kirkbride and Gem Archer joined him on-stage, as did Jay Darlington, all of whom Gallagher had previously worked with while he was still a member of Oasis. He played a mostly acoustic set, and played a variety of Oasis album tracks and B-sides. It was almost the same set he played at the Royal Albert Hall in 2007. Gallagher also joined friend Paul Weller onstage in London on 21 April 2010, and played the Oasis song &quot;Mucky Fingers&quot; and a song he co-wrote with Weller, &quot;Echoes Round the Sun&quot;.

Gallagher confirmed that he would be returning to the studio in August 2010 to record drums for an unnamed artist, later confirmed to be Paul Weller. He also denied rumours that he would be the Best Man for Russell Brand&#x27;s marriage to Katy Perry. In August, it was mentioned on a UK Music blog, Sourmash Music, that Gallagher had been working with Liverpool group the Sand Band. Lead singer David McDonnell has been co-writing with Gallagher and are looking to collaborate on future solo projects together.

On 24 November 2010, Miles Kane revealed that Gallagher sang on a track from his debut solo album titled &quot;My Fantasy&quot;. Kane also revealed that he will appear on Gallagher&#x27;s forthcoming album, playing guitar.

On 10 February 2011, Gallagher stated he had &quot;not even started&quot; his first solo record, despite Liam rumouring that he &#x27;swiped&#x27; material from the &quot;Dig Out Your Soul&quot; sessions. &quot;I am not recording new stuff, not just yet,&quot; he said to Talksport. &quot;It&#x27;ll be out when it&#x27;s finished I guess. Well I&#x27;ve not even started it, so I don&#x27;t know.&quot;
Noel Gallagher&#x27;s High Flying Birds released a self-titled album on 17 October 2011; a collaboration album with Amorphous Androgynous was to be released in 2012 but has now been shelved indefinitely. He began touring in Dublin on 23 October 2011. The touring band announced for Noel Gallagher&#x27;s High Flying Birds comprised David McDonnell (guitar), Russell Pritchard (bass), Mikey Rowe (keyboards) and Jeremy Stacey (drums); McDonnell left during rehearsals and was replaced before the tour with Tim Smith who had played with Rowe and Stacey previously. On 20 July 2011, Gallagher released a 47-second trailer of his first single &quot;The Death of You and Me&quot;. The video for the debut single was released on 25 July at 8:21 am (GMT).

Following the self-titled debut, Noel Gallagher&#x27;s High Flying Birds released their second album &quot;Chasing Yesterday&quot; 2 March 2015. In 2016 Gallagher co-wrote &quot;Birth of an Accidental Hipster&quot; with Paul Weller for the Monkees. In June 2015, Gallagher confirmed he was working on a third High Flying Birds album, later announced to be titled &quot;Who Built the Moon?&quot; and released on 27 November 2017. On 9 September 2017, Gallagher along with his band served as the headline act of &quot;We Are Manchester&quot;, a benefit concert to mark the reopening of Manchester Arena (following a terrorist attack there in May).

On 2 May 2019, the band released &quot;Black Star Dancing&quot;, the title track of their EP, which was released on 14 June 2019. On 5 August 2019, Gallagher&#x27;s band released the title track &quot;This Is The Place&quot; for a second EP which was released on 27 September 2019. The same month, Gallagher toured the United States with the Smashing Pumpkins. Gallagher appeared on First We Feast&#x27;s &quot;Hot Ones&quot; in October 2019.
On 14 November 2019, Noel released a new single &#x27;Wandering Star&#x27;. The single was released in promotion of his studio EP &#x27;Blue Moon Rising&#x27;. The EP also featured reflex and 7&quot; mixes of the title track, released on 6 March 2020.

On 29 April 2021, Gallagher announced the release of the band&#x27;s first greatest hits album, titled &quot;Back the Way We Came: Vol. 1 (2011–2021)&quot;. The album is a double release, which along with 16 previously released tracks, features two new songs; &quot;We&#x27;re On Our Way Now&quot; and &quot;Flying On the Ground&quot;, the former of which was released as a single the same day as its announcement. It was released on 11 June 2021. In an interview with Apple Music, Gallagher said that &quot;Best of Bee Gees&quot; is one of his favourite albums and that it inspired the cover of &quot;Back The Way We Came&quot;. Seven days after its release, &quot;Back the Way We Came&quot; became Gallagher&#x27;s 12th UK No. 1 album.

In January 2023, Noel Gallagher announced that his fourth studio album with the High Flying Birds, titled &quot;Council Skies&quot;, would be released on 2 June. The album was previewed with the single &quot;Easy Now&quot;, which is accompanied by a video starring Milly Alcock of &quot;House of the Dragon&quot; fame. The album sees Gallagher pay homage to his formative years and Mancunian roots. He acknowledges that the title &quot;Council Skies&quot; was inspired from the title of a book by Sheffield artist Pete Mckee.

February 2023 saw the announcement of a North American co-headline tour by the High Flying Birds and Garbage. The 24 date tour begins on 2 June in Auburn, WA and ends on 15 July in Boston. An autumn UK arena tour was announced in March 2023, playing venues in Hull, London, Birmingham, Cardiff, Leeds, Glasgow and Liverpool.

In an interview with &quot;NME&quot; in 2014 whilst promoting his solo debut album &quot;Everyday Robots&quot;, Damon Albarn hinted at a collaborative project with Gallagher. Despite the years of animosity during Blur and Oasis&#x27; respective heyday, Albarn said: &quot;We&#x27;re talking. It&#x27;s not anything to get excited about yet. I mean, he&#x27;s doing his thing. He&#x27;s finishing a new record. I&#x27;ve got my record coming out, but the principle of us making music together is something, you know. It would be fair to say, we have discussed it at least once.&quot;

In March 2015, Gallagher revealed that he was considering retirement from live shows within the following 10 years. He stated: &quot;It&#x27;s not fun being on a bus for six weeks in America. It&#x27;s fine when you&#x27;re young, but I&#x27;m almost 50.&quot;

In February 2016, Gallagher and Morgan hosted a one-off show for Absolute Radio.

==Personal life==
===Relationships===
Gallagher became engaged to his girlfriend Diane at the age of 18, but they never married and eventually separated. In 1988, he moved out of his family home to live with Louise Jones in India House, central Manchester. He described her as his &quot;soulmate&quot; and wrote &quot;Slide Away&quot; for her. They had an on-off relationship before separating in June 1994, with Gallagher stating: &quot;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever get over it.&quot;

In June 1997, Gallagher married Meg Mathews in Las Vegas. He had met her in 1994 through her roommate, MTV presenter Rebecca de Ruvo, whom he was dating at the time and whom he left for Mathews. Mathews gave birth to a daughter, Anaïs Gallagher, on 27 January 2000. Gallagher and Mathews divorced in January 2001 on the grounds of his adultery with Scottish publicist Sara MacDonald, whom he met at Ibiza nightclub Space in June 2000. After the divorce was finalised, Gallagher said that he had never actually been unfaithful and had only said he had cheated on Mathews to speed up the divorce process.

Gallagher then began a relationship with MacDonald, and wrote &quot;Waiting for the Rapture&quot; about their meeting. They have two sons: Donovan Rory MacDonald Gallagher (born 22 September 2007) and Sonny Patrick MacDonald Gallagher (born 1 October 2010). They were married on 18 June 2011 in a private ceremony at the Lime Wood Hotel in New Forest National Park. His close friend Russell Brand was the best man. They lived in Hampshire. In January 2023, the couple announced that they would be divorcing after 11 years of marriage, stating: &quot;When you get to your mid 50s you do come to some kind of crossroads in your life. It&#x27;s not uncommon for people who have been in long-term relationships to go their separate ways in their 50s.&quot;

Gallagher is friends with Gary Mounfield, Richard Ashcroft (to whom he dedicated the Oasis song &quot;Cast No Shadow&quot;), the Chemical Brothers, John Lydon, Steve Jones, Kasabian, Andy Nicholson, Ricky Hatton, Paul McCartney, Jamie Carragher, Chris Martin, Jonny Buckland, Johnny Marr, Damon Albarn, Morrissey, Bono, Paul Weller, Johnny Depp (who played slide guitar on the Oasis song &quot;Fade In-Out&quot;), and Kate Moss (who used to stay with him when she was visiting London). Around the time that actor Ewan McGregor found out he had been cast as Obi-Wan Kenobi, Gallagher (his next-door neighbour) challenged him to a battle with toy lightsabers in his garden the morning after a party.

===Other===
In 1998, Gallagher made a cameo appearance as himself in an episode of &quot;The Young Person&#x27;s Guide to Becoming a Rock Star&quot;. He is also a regular on the digital radio sports show &quot;Talksport&quot;.

In 2001, Gallagher was reported to have an estimated personal fortune of £25 million. In 2009, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; Rich List estimated his and Liam&#x27;s combined personal fortune at £52 million.

Gallagher is a lifelong Manchester City F.C. supporter, admitting he &quot;cried like a baby&quot; when they won the 2011–12 Premier League. He is a friend of the team&#x27;s former midfielder Joey Barton, as well as Italian striker Alessandro Del Piero, who described Gallagher as Italy&#x27;s &quot;lucky mascot&quot; during the 2006 FIFA World Cup and appeared in the video for Oasis&#x27; &quot;Lord Don&#x27;t Slow Me Down&quot;. Gallagher and Kasabian lead guitarist Sergio Pizzorno took part in drawing teams for the FA Cup third round in 2011. Coincidentally, Pizzorno drew his hometown team Leicester City with Gallagher&#x27;s Manchester City for the third round tie, in which both teams drew 2–2 and Manchester City proceeded to win 4–2 in the replay. He participated in the unveiling of Umbro-sponsored football kits with captain Vincent Kompany. In the advertising campaign, the two men are pictured wearing the new Manchester City home and away shirts for the 2012–13 season. Formerly, Kompany had introduced Gallagher to 80,000 fans during the Rock Werchter music festival in Belgium. After home matches, Manchester City regularly plays the Oasis song &quot;Wonderwall&quot;, which was written by Gallagher. Gallagher also supports Scottish football team Celtic F.C..

The son of Irish immigrants, Gallagher has described himself as Irish. In an interview with the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; in 1994, Gallagher said, &quot;I hope we&#x27;re not seen as snotty English upstarts. We&#x27;re really snotty Irish upstarts&quot;. Gallagher supports the Irish national football team and has said that he does not consider himself &quot;to be English at all&quot;, but he did serve as an official ambassador for England&#x27;s bid to host the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Gallagher is also a fan of the National Football League, noting in an ESPN interview, &quot;I love the NFL. I don&#x27;t have a team &quot;per se&quot;, but I&#x27;m into it. NFL comes on late night in the UK when I&#x27;m up. I love the colour and energy of it all. There&#x27;s so many things going on in American football. It took me a while to get it, but I like it a lot.&quot;

Gallagher stated in a 2006 radio interview with Russell Brand that he does not believe in &quot;God or an all-guiding force&quot;. Despite this, many of his songs have mentioned God (such as &quot;The Hindu Times&quot; and &quot;Little by Little&quot;), and all the tracks he had contributed to &quot;Dig Out Your Soul&quot; (as well as the other bandmates&#x27; songs) have lyrics and references to God and other biblical terms. &quot;Dig Out Your Soul&quot; has been described by Gallagher as a &quot;religious Armageddon&quot;. In 2009, he stated, &quot;See, I don&#x27;t know what I am. If I was an atheist I&#x27;d just write songs about not believing in God – but I don&#x27;t know what I am.&quot; In 2017, he reaffirmed his lack of belief in God in an &quot;Actually Me&quot; segment for &quot;GQ&quot;.

In 1999, Gallagher bought a home in Ibiza from Mike Oldfield for £2.5 million, but in 2008 Gallagher sold it, reportedly because James Blunt was a neighbour and he could not &quot;stand living there in the knowledge that Blunt is nearby making terrible music&quot;.

Gallagher was reportedly asked by Simon Cowell to be a judge on &quot;The X Factor&quot; after Dannii Minogue, Cheryl Cole, and Cowell himself declined to participate in series 8, but he declined.

In 2012, Gallagher was among the British cultural icons selected by Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork, the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; album cover, to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life.

==Songwriting and musicianship==
===Style and abilities===

Gallagher was the primary songwriter in Oasis, and the sole songwriting contributor on the group&#x27;s first three albums. He is often criticised for the praise he gives to his own songs, to which he quipped, &quot;If you&#x27;d written &#x27;Live Forever&#x27;, you&#x27;d be walking to a different tune the next day too.&quot; He has often been accused by critics of plagiarising the music of his heroes, but he has maintained that outright homages in his music are intentional. In a 1996 &quot;Guitar World&quot; interview, he described himself as &quot;a fan who writes songs&quot; and stated, &quot;I&#x27;m not saying, &#x27;I&#x27;m the greatest songwriter in the world. Listen to me.&#x27; Usually, I&#x27;m saying, &#x27;&quot;These&quot; are the greatest songwriters in the world. And I&#x27;m gonna put them all in this song.&#x27;&quot; His response to critics on the topic of &quot;blatantly&quot; stealing riffs was, &quot;No, I don&#x27;t feel guilty. But you feel pissed off because you didn&#x27;t do it first.&quot; He added, &quot;When I&#x27;m making a record, I&#x27;ve always been of the notion that if a song sounds like T. Rex, well, fuck it, let&#x27;s make it sound more like T. Rex! I know there&#x27;s bands that might write something that sounds like the Smiths, and they&#x27;ll go, &#x27;Oh, it sounds like the Smiths, we&#x27;ve got to make it sound not like the Smiths.&#x27; If I&#x27;m writing a song and I say to myself, &#x27;Oh, hey, it sounds like the Kinks,&#x27; then I&#x27;m going to turn it into a Kinks track.&quot;

Gallagher has commented on his musical ability:

Comparing himself to other guitarists, Gallagher stated, &quot;I can barely play like Peter Green, let alone fucking Jeff Beck.&quot; He also said, &quot;I&#x27;m unfortunate enough that two of my best mates are Johnny Marr and Paul Weller. Those two are virtuosos to me although neither of them would admit it. On the electric guitar they&#x27;re it. So if you&#x27;re asking me how do I compare to those two—and I like to compare myself to the greats—I&#x27;m average at fucking best.&quot; Weller described Gallagher&#x27;s ability as a guitarist as &quot;rudimentary&quot;, saying, &quot;Noel doesn&#x27;t pretend to be a guitar god. He&#x27;s very good at putting chords together and he&#x27;s got a distinctive style in terms of his chord sequences and his rhythm playing. It&#x27;s recognisable.&quot; Though naturally left-handed, Gallagher plays guitar right-handed, which he said is the only thing he can do with his non-dominant hand.

Gallagher has said he sometimes does not understand his own lyrics, commenting in 2005, &quot;When I&#x27;m halfway through &#x27;Don&#x27;t Look Back in Anger&#x27; I say to myself, &#x27;I still don&#x27;t know what these words mean!&#x27;&quot; By 2017, he had reflected, &quot;There is a bit of truth in that statement. Like the bit in &#x27;Champagne Supernova&#x27; about &#x27;slowly walking down the hall faster than a cannonball&#x27;. What does that mean? And the answer is, I don&#x27;t know what it means. I don&#x27;t care what it means. It must mean something, though, because I play it to a sea of people every night and they seem to understand it. That&#x27;s all that matters, I guess.&quot; He has stated that he is dyslexic, which slows down the process of his songwriting, and that he can neither read nor write music notation.

===Changing band dynamic===
Gallagher&#x27;s role as a chief songwriter for Oasis changed over time as he allowed a greater level of lyrical input from the other band members. &quot;Standing on the Shoulder of Giants&quot; included Oasis&#x27; first-ever album track written by his brother Liam. &quot;Heathen Chemistry&quot; included a further three tracks by Liam (including &quot;Songbird&quot;), one by Gem Archer, and one by Andy Bell. The album &quot;Don&#x27;t Believe the Truth&quot; featured another three tracks by Liam (one of them, &quot;Love Like a Bomb&quot;, co-written with Archer), one from Archer, and two from Bell. The latter two albums have been greeted with increasing critical and commercial success in the UK, particularly &quot;Don&#x27;t Believe the Truth&quot;. The second single from &quot;Don&#x27;t Believe the Truth&quot;, &quot;The Importance of Being Idle&quot;, became the second Oasis track sung by Noel to top the UK charts and was named 2005&#x27;s finest track by &quot;Q&quot; magazine, as well as being nominated for the &quot;NME&quot; &quot;Best Song of 2005&quot; award. On the final Oasis albums, Noel&#x27;s increasing role as lead singer, apparently to compensate for his diminished role as songwriter, caused some tension with Liam.

Zak Starkey, son of Beatles drummer Ringo Starr and previous drummer for the Who and Johnny Marr, replaced long-time drummer Alan White during the recording sessions for &quot;Don&#x27;t Believe the Truth&quot;. The loss of White prompted Gallagher to comment in a 2005 interview that he credits Oasis&#x27; trouble with drummers, in part, to the fact that he is himself a talented drummer: &quot;I get a lot of stick for it, but I&#x27;m the best drummer in the group.&quot;

==Controversies==
Gallagher is well known for his controversial and outspoken statements in the press; he acknowledged his tendency for &quot;faux pas&quot; in the song &quot;My Big Mouth&quot; on the album &quot;Be Here Now&quot;. He has defended himself, saying, &quot;People think [I&#x27;m] controversial for the answers [I] give to silly questions in interviews, but ... I&#x27;m not thinking about insulting people; I say what I genuinely feel is in my heart. My conscience is clean, d&#x27;you know what I mean? Y&#x27;know, I&#x27;m true to myself—fuck everybody else.&quot; On-stage at the 1996 Brit Awards, where INXS singer Michael Hutchence presented Oasis&#x27; &quot;Best Video&quot; award for &quot;Wonderwall&quot;, after receiving the award from Hutchence, Gallagher pointed his award to Hutchence and said, &quot;Has-beens should not be presenting awards to gonna-be&#x27;s.&quot; referring to INXS&#x27; popularity declining. Those words devastated Michael Hutchence.

===Damon Albarn and Blur===
In a 1995 interview with &quot;The Observer&quot;, he expressed a wish for Damon Albarn and Alex James of rivals Blur to &quot;catch AIDS and die&quot;. He quickly apologised for the comment and stated that &quot;AIDS is no laughing matter&quot;. This statement was preceded by the success of &quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot;, which led to a well-documented feud with Blur. The differing styles of the bands, coupled with their prominence within the Britpop movement, led the British media to seize upon the rivalry between the bands. Both groups played along, with the Gallaghers taunting Blur at the 1996 BRIT Awards by singing a rendition of &quot;Parklife&quot; when they collected their &quot;Best British Band&quot; award, with Liam changing the lyrics to &quot;shite-life&quot;.

Gallagher maintains that the rivalry was conceived by the magazine &quot;NME&quot; and members of Blur&#x27;s entourage as a ploy to raise their respective profiles, and that he has had no respect for either party ever since. Albarn has suggested the roots of the feud were much more personal. Tension between the two had largely cooled by 2007, and Gallagher said in an &quot;NME&quot; interview, &quot;I&#x27;ve got a lot of respect for Damon, I really do mean it. Because I&#x27;m indifferent to Damon he thinks that I think he&#x27;s a cunt. Our Liam will talk to him, I won&#x27;t because he&#x27;s just another singer in a band to me, but I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s a cunt.&quot; On 23 March 2013, Gallagher, Albarn, Graham Coxon, and Paul Weller performed the Blur hit &quot;Tender&quot; at the Teenage Cancer Trust. Gallagher and Coxon later provided backing vocals on the song &quot;We Got the Power&quot; on Albarn&#x27;s Gorillaz album &quot;Humanz&quot;. In 2019, he confirmed in an interview with Dermot O&#x27;Leary on BBC Two that he and Albarn had become friends.

===Liam Gallagher===

The Gallagher brothers have a tumultuous relationship, and one of their arguments was even released on the 1995 bootleg single &quot;Wibbling Rivalry&quot;. Although their relationship had stabilised in later years, there were a handful of incidents during the band&#x27;s early career where the two physically attacked each other. At a Los Angeles show during their first American tour in 1994, Liam took to changing the words of the songs so that they were offensive to both Americans and Noel. An argument after the show which led to a chair being thrown and a fight breaking out caused Noel to leave the tour and head for Las Vegas, and he later said he had &quot;visions of &quot;Fear and Loathing&quot; flashing in [his] eyes&quot;. During recording sessions for &quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot;, the brothers had a violent fight involving a cricket bat when Liam invited everyone from a local pub into the studio while Noel was trying to work. In 1995, Noel sang &quot;Wonderwall&quot; on &quot;Later... with Jools Holland&quot; when Liam failed to turn up.

In 1996, Noel provided lead vocals at a performance for &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; when Liam backed out minutes before the set was due to start. Liam claimed to have been struck down with a &quot;sore throat&quot;, but the band later found out that Liam did not like performing acoustically. Noel was further annoyed when Liam proceeded to heckle him from the balcony and &quot;nurse his sore throat&quot; with beer and cigarettes while the band performed. Just before the band were about to board a plane to the United States for a big tour, Liam left the airport, claiming he had to find a house for his then-wife Patsy Kensit. He later joined the band for their last few gigs and the infamous MTV Awards performance, while the remaining dates were scrapped.

While on tour in Barcelona in 2000, Oasis were forced to cancel a gig when Alan White&#x27;s arm seized up, and the band spent the evening drinking instead. Liam made a crude remark about Gallagher&#x27;s then-wife Meg Mathews and attempted to cast doubt over the legitimacy of his daughter Anaïs, causing Noel to headbutt him. Following this, he declared he was quitting overseas touring, but returned for an Oasis gig in Dublin on 8 July 2000. During the performance, the two brothers shook hands at the end of &quot;Acquiesce&quot;.

Liam once stated that he did not speak much with Noel and that they &quot;don&#x27;t really have a relationship&quot;. During the final tour, the only time that they ever spoke directly was when onstage. Noel would later reveal that while they were in Oasis, the two &quot;never hung out together outside of the band, ever&quot;.

The relationship between the two brothers again became strained throughout 2009, eventually leading to a last-minute cancellation of an Oasis concert scheduled to take place on 28 August in Paris due to an &quot;altercation within the group&quot;. Later that evening, Gallagher confirmed he had left Oasis as he &quot;simply could not go on working with Liam a day longer&quot;. Through the Oasis website, he said, &quot;It&#x27;s with some sadness and great relief to tell you that I quit Oasis tonight.&quot; On 29 August, he expanded further on his blog: &quot;The level of verbal and violent intimidation towards me, my family, friends and comrades has become intolerable. And the lack of support and understanding from my management and band mates has left me with no other option than to get me cape and seek pastures new.&quot;

When asked in 2012 about his brother and an Oasis reunion, Noel said, &quot;I last texted Liam at Christmas after the City match. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s gonna happen. It would be great for everyone else except me. It&#x27;d be mega for the millions and millions and for everybody else it would be brilliant, but I wouldn&#x27;t be very happy about it. I guess you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re gonna feel like in 20-odd years but right now, I mean I was in Oasis for nearly 20 years. I&#x27;ve been doing what I&#x27;m doing now for one year and I&#x27;d like to see what it&#x27;s like to do it for longer. I don&#x27;t think anyone is pushing for a reunion either. Nobody ever brings it up in any seriousness; I mean Liam does publicly but he says a lot of things publicly. I wouldn&#x27;t take anything he says seriously.&quot; After their performance of &quot;Wonderwall&quot; at the London Olympics Closing Ceremony, which Noel had originally turned down, he referred to Liam&#x27;s band Beady Eye as &quot;Stratford&#x27;s finest Oasis tribute band&quot;.

In December 2017, during an interview with an Australian newspaper, Liam claimed that he and Noel had declared a &quot;truce&quot;. In February 2018, Liam revealed that the truce did not happen and that it was just &quot;in his head&quot; after &quot;a couple of drinks&quot;. In a 2019 interview in Norwegian-Swedish talk show &quot;Skavlan&quot;, Noel said that Liam was spreading a false rumour online that Oasis would get back together if Noel&#x27;s wife would let him, and that she was receiving lots of abuse because of it. In 2024, the brothers announced that they will reform Oasis for a tour starting the following year. The brothers later both separately confirmed that there is no animosity between them anymore.

===Jay-Z===
Gallagher criticised the organisers of the 2008 Glastonbury Festival for scheduling U.S. hip-hop artist Jay-Z as a headliner for the traditionally rock-focused festival: &quot;If it ain&#x27;t broke don&#x27;t fix it. If you start to break it then people aren&#x27;t going to go. I&#x27;m sorry, but Jay-Z? No chance. Glastonbury has a tradition of guitar music and even when they throw the odd curveball in on a Sunday night you go, &#x27;Kylie Minogue?&#x27; I don&#x27;t know about it. But I&#x27;m not having hip-hop at Glastonbury. It&#x27;s wrong.&quot; Emily Eavis, the organiser of the festival, said she was honoured Jay-Z was headlining the event: &quot;He&#x27;s absolutely the right act for our festival. There&#x27;s no reason why we should not have the greatest living hip-hop artist on at Glastonbury.&quot; Eavis also reminded Gallagher that the Roots, Cypress Hill, and De La Soul had all previously performed at Glastonbury. Jay-Z said, &quot;We don&#x27;t play guitars, Noel, but hip-hop has put in its work like any other form of music. This headline show is just a natural progression. ... We have to respect each other&#x27;s genre of music and move forward.&quot;

Jay-Z opened his Glastonbury set with a cover of Oasis&#x27; song &quot;Wonderwall&quot;. When Gallagher was asked about the incident, he replied:

When Jay-Z was asked about Gallagher&#x27;s comments, he said, &quot;I haven&#x27;t spoken to [Gallagher], I heard he was reaching out. I don&#x27;t bear any grudge, it&#x27;s all good. I just believe in good music and bad music, I&#x27;ve always said that. You look at any interview from the beginning of time, I&#x27;ve always stated that I don&#x27;t believe in the lines and classifications that people put music in so they can easily define it.&quot; When asked who he would be interested in collaborating with, he said, &quot;Anyone. Oasis as well. It doesn&#x27;t matter to me.&quot;

===Phil Collins===
Gallagher has frequently criticised Phil Collins, saying his music is bland and the opposite of what he stands for. He was quoted as saying, &quot;People hate fucking cunts like Phil Collins, and if they don&#x27;t, they fucking should!&quot; He also called Collins the &quot;antichrist&quot;. Prior to the 2005 UK election, he stated that he was still supporting the Labour government partly because of his concern that &quot;Phil Collins is threatening to come back and live here [if the Conservatives win] and let&#x27;s face it, none of us want that&quot;. Collins responded by saying that Gallagher &quot;loves slagging me off&quot;. He also denied that he was a Conservative Party supporter in an interview in &quot;The Guardian&quot;. He appeared on the BBC television series &quot;Room 101&quot; and nominated to banish the Gallagher brothers, describing them as &quot;rude and not as talented as they think they are&quot;. In his 2016 autobiography, &quot;Not Dead Yet&quot;, Collins recalled meeting Gallagher in 1996 at a bar in Mustique. Gallagher declined Collins&#x27; request to jam with him.

==Political views==
Gallagher has spoken about his political views on several occasions. He was quoted: &quot;Politics is like football for me. Labour is my team and even if you don&#x27;t like a striker you don&#x27;t give up supporting the whole team. Labour is the lesser of two evils. What else should we have? Anarchy? Someone has to be responsible.&quot; In 1997, he visited the recently appointed Prime Minister Tony Blair at 10 Downing Street. In an interview that year, when he was asked about why he visited Blair, he replied:

In an interview in 2007, when asked about politics, he said:

In 1997, he played a 5-song set at the Tibetan Freedom Concert in New York City. As a result, Oasis were deemed &quot;unsuitable&quot; by the Chinese government, forcing a planned tour of the country in 2009 to be cancelled. Gallagher was passionate in his support for Barack Obama&#x27;s successful bid for President of the United States, calling his acceptance speech to the 2008 Democratic National Convention &quot;spellbinding&quot;.

Gallagher has been very vocal about knife crime. In 2008 he was quoted: &quot;The scumbags are taking over the streets. I don&#x27;t know what David Cameron and Gordon Brown are going to do about it. It all goes back to the Thatcher years. It sounds like a cliché but that&#x27;s when the rot set in.&quot; When the interviewer suggested it was for status he replied, &quot;In my day status was about trying to be somebody, not trying to kill somebody, so how&#x27;s that all changed?&quot;

In the 2010 UK general election, Gallagher said he voted for a candidate dressed as a pirate as a protest vote. Speaking out about the August 2011 riots that took place in England, Gallagher stated, &quot;Last August I was on tour in Europe and people were asking me about the riots. All over the world, Syria and Egypt, people were rioting for freedom. And these kids in England are rioting for tracksuits. It&#x27;s embarrassing.&quot; Gallagher said that violent video games and violent television shows which children were being exposed to were partially to blame for social problems.

In February 2012, Gallagher implied that the UK under the premiership of Thatcher was a more fertile ground for dissent in the arts. He said: &quot;Under Thatcher, who ruled us with an iron rod, great art was made. Amazing designers and musicians. Acid house was born. Very colourful and progressive. Now, no one&#x27;s got anything to say. &#x27;Write a song? No thanks, I&#x27;ll say it on Twitter.&#x27; It&#x27;s a sad state when more people retweet than buy records.&quot;

In a February 2015 interview with &quot;The Quietus&quot;, Gallagher elaborated on his disillusion with current politicians and how they&#x27;ll do anything to say they&#x27;re just regular people: &quot;And now the Conservatives are just ... David Cameron, he&#x27;s trying to be your mate. &#x27;Oh, I really like the Jam.&#x27;&quot; Gallagher then went on to say that Thatcher was brutal but more direct, and &quot;you can kind of respect that&quot;.

In an interview with &quot;HuffPost&quot; shortly before the 2015 UK general election, he summed up his views of contemporary political leaders: &quot;David Cameron a bell-end, Ed Miliband a communist, the rest of them don&#x27;t really count.&quot; In 2016, Gallagher stated that, while he remained left-wing, he opposed Labour&#x27;s new leader Jeremy Corbyn, quipping &quot;Meet the new boss, same as the old boss&quot;, and saying &quot;the Tories don&#x27;t care about the vulnerable, and the communists don&#x27;t care about the aspirational.&quot;

Gallagher did not vote in the 2016 Brexit referendum, saying that he &quot;didn&#x27;t think we should have been given the vote in the first place because as ordinary members of the public how are the fuck are you qualified to talk about the break-up of the oldest continent in the fucking world.&quot; He also said that he felt Britain should have remained part of the European Union saying, &quot;I feel right at the time of it happening, we turned our back on the French, who were going through some dark terror shit.&quot; He concluded, &quot;But it&#x27;s happened now. It was a legal vote. Fucking get it done and let&#x27;s move on.&quot;

During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Gallagher garnered attention for refusing to wear a face covering while shopping. He explained during Matt Morgan&#x27;s podcast, &quot;I choose not to wear one and if I get the virus it&#x27;s on me, it&#x27;s not on anyone else.&quot;

In 2021, after being asked what he thought of the recent controversies surrounding the Royal Family, Gallagher expressed sympathy and support for Prince William and criticised Prince Harry and Meghan Markle over allegations they had made against other Royals by drawing a parallel between the situation and his brother Liam&#x27;s public statements, stating: &quot;He&#x27;s got a fucking younger brother shooting his fucking mouth off with shit that is just so unnecessary. I&#x27;d like to think I was always the William.&quot; Gallagher furthermore accused Meghan of negatively influencing Harry&#x27;s personality and describing Harry as &quot;coming across like a typical fucking woke snowflake&quot;, adding that &quot;this is what happens when you get involved with Americans&quot;.

In 2024, in response to political statements made by artists at the Glastonbury Festival, including pro-Palestinian comments from Blur&#x27;s Damon Albarn and Kneecap, Gallagher characterised the festival as &quot;a bit woke now&quot; and &quot;kind of preachy and a bit virtue signaling&quot;. He further criticised the trend, stating: &quot;I don&#x27;t like it in music — little f–king idiots waving flags around and making political statements and bands taking the stage and saying, &#x27;Hey guys, isn&#x27;t war terrible, yeah? Let&#x27;s all boo war. F–k the Tories man,&#x27; and all that.&quot;

==Musical equipment==

Throughout his career, Gallagher has used a wide range of different guitars, effect pedals and amplifiers from his large collection. Most of it emerged from the &quot;Standing on the Shoulder of Giants&quot; sessions, where he decided to drop the equipment used in the three previous albums and instead buy &quot;loads of really weird pedals, old guitars, and small amps&quot;, as the lack of deadline to deliver the album allowed Gallagher to &quot;take quite a few days just messing around&quot;.

===Guitars===
;Electric guitars
* Epiphone Les Paul – Gallagher played a cherry sunburst model in the early years of Oasis.
* Gibson Les Paul – A sunburst Les Paul was given to Gallagher by Johnny Marr, formerly of the Smiths, in the early days of Oasis. He used this guitar to compose &quot;Cigarettes &amp; Alcohol&quot; and &quot;Slide Away&quot;. Before Johnny Marr owned it, it belonged to Pete Townshend. When this Les Paul was severely damaged, Marr gave him another Les Paul, used prominently on the Smiths&#x27; album &quot;The Queen Is Dead&quot;.
* Fender Telecaster – Gallagher uses several, one of which, a 1960s model, was given to Noel by Johnny Depp as a birthday present.
* Epiphone Casino
* Gibson ES-355 Vintage Model – Since 2001, this has become Gallagher&#x27;s main stage guitar.
* Epiphone Sheraton – Gallagher used two Epiphone Sheratons, a sunburst one and one with a Union Jack painted on the front which Epiphone sold as a signature model named &#x27;Supernova&#x27;.
* Epiphone Riviera – Gallagher used a dark wine red Riviera throughout 1995.

===Effect pedals===
In the early days of Oasis, Gallagher did not use pedals: &quot;I used to just turn up the amps as full as I could get them.&quot; Since then, he has begun using a large number of effects, but singled out the Ibanez Tube Screamer.

===Amplification===
Gallagher has said that he used only 100-watt Marshalls early in his career. After &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot;, he began using smaller amps, singling out Fenders (Princeton and Bandmaster), and also a combo made by Clark Amplification, which builds amplifiers based on vintage Fender and Marshall amps. While recording &quot;What&#x27;s the Story Morning Glory?&quot;, Gallagher also used Orange and Vox amps. Orange later made Gallagher a custom amplifier, which was later sold online for £6,800.

<text>In linear algebra, the main diagonal (sometimes principal diagonal, primary diagonal, leading diagonal, major diagonal, or good diagonal) of a matrix formula_1 is the list of entries formula_2 where formula_3. All off-diagonal elements are zero in a diagonal matrix. The following four matrices have their main diagonals indicated by red ones: 

formula_4

==Square matrices==
For a square matrix, the &quot;diagonal&quot; (or &quot;main diagonal&quot; or &quot;principal diagonal&quot;) is the diagonal line of entries running from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner. For a matrix formula_5 with row index specified by formula_6 and column index specified by formula_7, these would be entries formula_8 with formula_3. For example, the identity matrix can be defined as having entries of 1 on the main diagonal and zeroes elsewhere:
:formula_10
The trace of a matrix is the sum of the diagonal elements. 

The top-right to bottom-left diagonal is sometimes described as the &quot;minor&quot; diagonal or &quot;antidiagonal&quot;.

The &quot;off-diagonal&quot; entries are those not on the main diagonal. A &quot;diagonal matrix&quot; is one whose off-diagonal entries are all zero.

A &quot;superdiagonal&quot; entry is one that is directly above and to the right of the main diagonal. Just as diagonal entries are those formula_8 with formula_12, the superdiagonal entries are those with formula_13. For example, the non-zero entries of the following matrix all lie in the superdiagonal:
:formula_14
Likewise, a &quot;subdiagonal&quot; entry is one that is directly below and to the left of the main diagonal, that is, an entry formula_8 with formula_16. General matrix diagonals can be specified by an index formula_17 measured relative to the main diagonal: the main diagonal has formula_18; the superdiagonal has formula_19; the subdiagonal has formula_20; and in general, the formula_17-diagonal consists of the entries formula_8 with formula_23.

A banded matrix is one for which its non-zero elements are restricted to a diagonal band. A tridiagonal matrix has only the main diagonal, superdiagonal, and subdiagonal entries as non-zero.
==Antidiagonal==

The antidiagonal (sometimes counter diagonal, secondary diagonal (*), trailing diagonal, minor diagonal, off diagonal, or bad diagonal) of an order formula_24 square matrix formula_25 is the collection of entries formula_26 such that formula_27 for all formula_28. That is, it runs from the top right corner to the bottom left corner.
:formula_29

(*) Secondary (as well as &quot;trailing&quot;, &quot;minor&quot; and &quot;off&quot;) diagonals very often also mean the (a.k.a. &quot;k&quot;-th) diagonals parallel to the main or principal diagonals, &quot;i.e.&quot;, formula_30 for some nonzero k =1, 2, 3, ... More generally and universally, the off diagonal elements of a matrix are all elements &quot;not&quot; on the main diagonal, &quot;i.e.&quot;, with distinct indices &quot;i ≠ j&quot;.

<text>General Comprehensive Operating System (GCOS, ; originally GECOS, General Electric Comprehensive Operating Supervisor) is a family of operating systems oriented toward the 36-bit GE-600 series and Honeywell 6000 series mainframe computers.

The original version of GCOS was developed by General Electric beginning in 1962. The operating system is still used today in its most recent versions (GCOS 7 and GCOS 8) on servers and mainframes produced by Groupe Bull, primarily through emulation, to provide continuity with legacy mainframe environments. GCOS 7 and GCOS 8 are separate branches of the operating system and continue to be developed alongside each other.

==History==
===GECOS/Honeywell GCOS 3===
The GECOS operating system was developed by General Electric for the 36-bit GE-600 series in 1962–1964; GE released GECOS I (with a prototype 635) in April 1965, GECOS II in November 1965 and GECOS III (with time-sharing) in 1967. It bore a close resemblance architecturally to IBSYS on the IBM 7094 and less to DOS/360 on the IBM System/360. However, the GE 600 Series four processor architecture was very different from the System/360 and GECOS was more ambitious than DOS/360. GECOS-III supported both time-sharing (TSS) and batch processing, with dynamic allocation of memory (IBM had fixed partitions, at that time), making it a true second-generation operating system.

After Honeywell acquired GE&#x27;s computer division, GECOS-III was renamed GCOS 3, and the hardware line was renamed to the Honeywell 6000 series, adding the EIS (enhanced instruction set, character oriented instead of word oriented).

===Other operating systems given the GCOS name===
The name &quot;GCOS&quot; was extended to the operating systems for all Honeywell-marketed product lines.

GCOS-64, a completely different 32-bit operating system for the Level 64 series, similar to Multics, was designed by Honeywell and Honeywell Bull developers in France and Boston.

GCOS-62, the operating system for another 32-bit low-end line of machines, the Level 62 series, was designed in Italy.

GCOS-61 was the operating system for a new version of a small system made in France (Model 58, later Level 61/58).

The operating system for a new 16-bit minicomputer line from Massachusetts (Billerica), the Level 6, got the name GCOS 6.

===GCOS 7 and GCOS 8===
Another renaming of the hardware product lines occurred in 1979, with the Level 6 becoming the DPS 6, the Level 62 becoming the DPS 4, the Level 64 becoming DPS 7, and Level 66 becoming DPS 8. Operating Systems retained the GCOS brand-name, with GCOS 6, GCOS 4, GCOS 7, and GCOS 8 being introduced. GCOS 8 was an extensive rewrite of GCOS 3, with changes made to support true virtual memory management and demand paging (these changes also required new hardware). GCOS 3 was supported in maintenance for several years after this announcement and renaming. Honeywell Bull published &quot;Large Systems: GCOS 8 OS Time Sharing System User&#x27;s Guide&quot; in 1986.

===Legacy===
DPS 6 and DPS 4 (ex-Level 62) were superseded by Motorola 68000 and later on PowerPC minicomputers running Unix and the product lines were discontinued, though GCOS 6 ran in an emulator on top of AIX. The DPS 7 line, along with GCOS 7, continued to evolve into the DPS 7000 hardware base.

In the late 1980s Honeywell sold its computer business to a joint venture that initially included NEC and Bull, with Honeywell still holding a stake for a time. Over a couple of years, Bull took over the company. NEC supplied several generations of mainframe hardware at the high end, which would run both GCOS 8 and their own ACOS-4 Operating System. Bull used the nomenclature DPS-9000 for its entire GCOS 8-based mainframe line, which included models designed by both Bull and NEC.

By the late 1990s and early 2000s, Bull&#x27;s desire was to center its development on a single hardware base, running commodity Intel chips but with Bull value-adds. This platform, called Novascale and based on Itanium 2 processors, ran both Windows and Linux natively. However, instruction set simulators for both the DPS 7000 and DPS 9000 allowed GCOS 7 and GCOS 8 to run on this platform. The demise of the Itanium family required a change of hardware, and as of 2022, GCOS 7 and GCOS 8 are simulated on Bull Sequana M7200 and M9600 Xeon-based hardware respectively.

Support for GCOS 7 and GCOS 8 from Bull is planned through at least 2025 including regular hardware and software upgrades.

A trace of GCOS influence remains today in modern UNIX systems. Some early Unix systems at Bell Labs used GCOS machines for print spooling and various other services. The field added to &quot;/etc/passwd&quot; to carry GCOS ID information was called the &quot;GECOS field&quot; and survives today as the &quot;pw_gecos&quot; member used for the user&#x27;s full name and other human-ID information.

Multics today, under the DPS8M simulator, retains the capability of running GCOS jobs, both batch and timesharing, via the &quot;Multics GCOS Environment Simulator.&quot;

==Applications==
GCOS 3 (and later GCOS 7 and GCOS 8) featured a CODASYL network database called Integrated Data Store (IDS) that was the model for the more successful IDMS.

Several transaction processing monitors were designed for GCOS 3 and GCOS 8. An early attempt at Transaction processing (TP) for GCOS 3, the Transaction Processing Executive, assumed that, as in Unix, a new process should be started to handle each transaction, and enjoyed only very limited success. Another TP system, the Transaction Driven System (TDS), was soon developed for GCOS 3, using a single process (potentially with multiple threads) to service all transactions. TDS was essentially a Honeywell development. It was later replaced by the backward-compatible Transaction Processing 8 (TP8) on GCOS 8, which profited from the overhaul in GCOS system architecture that came with GCOS 8 to make full use of virtual memory concepts. TP8 used multiple static processes in a way similar to UNIX daemons to handle incoming transactions in a multiplexed way. TDS and its TP8 successor were commercially successful, and TDS predated IBM CICS, which had a very similar architecture. A similar product also called TDS was developed for GCOS-7, but the internal architecture was completely different.

==System architecture and concepts==
GCOS is a multithreading, multiprogramming operating system originally oriented towards batch processing, although later versions incorporated enhancements for timesharing and online transaction processing environments. Systems running GCOS today use it mainly for batch and OLTP, or as a backend enterprise server.

GCOS has a basic architecture similar to that of operating systems for the IBM 360 and earlier IBM 7090 Series, and subsequent operating systems with which it competed. It was also heavily influenced by projects such as MEDINET, Multics, and WWMCCS, and has inherited a strong security structure in consequence. Hardware and software features combine to render the operating system unusually secure for an operating system of its generation and class. Multics influenced the design of the hardware, with gate-oriented secure transfer-of-control instructions and a hardware-enforced system of security levels very similar to that of the famous Multics rings. Operational environments such as WWMCCS drove development of special security features to allow secure hosting of classified information and compartmentalization. For a time separate versions of the GCOS system with special security features turned on were maintained specifically for government customers.

Early versions of GCOS and the hardware it ran on did not support paged virtual memory but did support a single memory segment per process. This made it inferior for time-sharing, especially compared with hardware designed to support Multics and the contemporaneous DEC PDP-10 hardware.

GCOS is a process-oriented OS, in which each process hosts one or more execution threads and executes in its own virtual memory space. Virtual memory is divided into segments of arbitrary size reminiscent of Multics segments, and a second level of address translation converts pure virtual addresses to pageable addresses, which are then converted to real addresses in main memory or backing store. Segments and pages and other constructs include hardware-enforced security parameters. The top-level virtual memory architecture also simplifies sharing of code and data in a secure fashion, again in a way reminiscent of Multics.

Each GCOS version was designed for specific hardware. The most recent machines capable of running the OS do so through emulation of that hardware. The hardware originally had much in common with Multics hardware, so much so that some mainframe equipment could be switched from &quot;GCOS mode&quot; to &quot;Multics mode&quot; with the turn of a dial. Much of the peripheral equipment used with GCOS could also be used with Multics, although front-end network processors were very different between the two systems.

Program languages available for GCOS included GCOS Algol, Algol-68, COBOL, SNOBOL, JOVIAL, APL, GPL, FORTRAN 68, CORAL 66, FORTRAN 77 and B.

== Documentation ==
Documentation was printed pages, available on-premise to users (staff, students...), organized into steel binders, locked together in one monolithic steel reading rack, bolted to a table or counter, with pages organized for modular information updates, replacement, errata, and addenda. 

==GCOS8 Storage Units==
Modern terminology for units of storage applies across various operating systems and computer vendors, and is part of everyday conversation. Terms like megabyte and gigabyte mean much the same to everyone, and terms like mebibyte and gibibyte have been formally standardised.

However, the GCOS8 system pre-dates this mono-culture with some units of its own, as follows:

Note that in this system a byte contains 9 bits with values ranging from (000)8 to (777)8 or 0–511, unlike the usual 8-bit-bytes with values ranging from (000)8 to (377)8 or 0-255. This is due to the 36-bit CPU architecture.

Permanent file sizes were specified in Llinks (1280 bytes). Temporary file sizes were specified in Links (15,360 bytes). Since the early 1970s, all GCOS 3 and GCOS 8 disk drives used Logical Block Addressing (LBA).

<doc id="195007" wikidata="Q2944360" url="?curid=195007" title="Centenarian">
<text>A centenarian is a person who has reached the age of 100. Because life expectancies at birth worldwide are well below 100, the term is invariably associated with longevity. The United Nations estimated that there were 316,600 living centenarians worldwide in 2012, and 573,000 in 2020, almost quadruple the 2000 estimate of 151,000.

As world population and life expectancy continue to increase, the number of centenarians is expected to increase substantially in the 21st century. According to the Office of National Statistics in the United Kingdom, one-third of babies born in the country in 2013 are expected to live to 100.

According to a 1998 United Nations demographic survey, Japan is expected to have 272,000 centenarians by 2050; other sources suggest that the number could be closer to 1 million. The incidence of centenarians in Japan was one per 3,522 people in 2008.

In Japan, the population of centenarians is highly skewed towards females. Japan in fiscal year 2016 had 57,525 female centenarians, while there were 8,167 males, a ratio of 7:1. The increase of centenarians was even more skewed, at 11.6:1.

== Worldwide incidence by country ==
The total number of centenarians in the world is uncertain. The Population Division of the United Nations estimated that there were 23,000 in 1950, 110,000 in 1990, 150,000 in 1995, 209,000 in 2000, 324,000 in 2005, 455,000 in 2009, and 935,000 in 2024. 

These older estimates, however, did not take into account downward adjustments of national estimates made by several countries such as the United States. The UN estimated in 2012, as a result of these adjustments, that there were only 316,600 centenarians worldwide. The following table gives estimated centenarian populations by country, including both the latest and the earliest known estimates, where available.

A study which received a 2024 Ig Nobel Prize found these numbers are inflated by welfare and pension fraud and poor record-keeping, neither of which are uniform across jurisdictions.


==Supercentenarians==
A supercentenarian, sometimes hyphenated as super-centenarian, is a person who has reached the age of 110 years. This age milestone is only achieved by about one in a thousand centenarians.

Even rarer is a person who has lived to 115. There are 76 people in recorded history who have indisputably reached 115. Only three of the people who have reached 115 are men. Inah Canabarro Lucas, Ethel Caterham and Okagi Hayashi are the only verified people currently alive who have reached the 115 years milestone.

Jeanne Calment from France is the only age-verified person in human history to have reached the age of 120 years.

== Recognition and congratulations ==
===History, blessings and traditions===
An aspect of blessing in many cultures is to offer a wish that the recipient lives to 100 years old. Among Hindus in India, where touching feet of elders and respected is a tradition, people who touch the feet of elders are often blessed with &quot;May you live a hundred years&quot;. In Sweden, the traditional birthday song states, &quot;May he/she live for one hundred years&quot;. In Judaism, &quot;May you live to be 120 years old&quot; is a common blessing. In Poland, &quot;Sto lat&quot;, a wish to live a hundred years, is a traditional form of praise and good wishes, and the song &quot;sto lat, sto lat&quot; is sung on the occasion of the birthday celebrations—arguably, it is the most popular song in Poland and among Poles around the globe.

According to legends, Sages from ancient India lived and meditated for tens of thousands of years while Great Kings ruled their kingdoms for thousands of years.

Chinese emperors were hailed to live ten thousand years, while empresses were hailed to live a thousand years.

In Italy, &quot;A hundred of these days!&quot; (&quot;cento di questi giorni&quot;) is an augury for birthdays, to live to celebrate 100 more birthdays. Some Italians say &quot;A cent&#x27;anni!&quot;, which means &quot;(up) To a hundred years&quot;, in that they wish that they could all live happily for a hundred years. In Greece, wishing someone Happy Birthday ends with the expression (), which can be loosely translated as &quot;may you make it one hundred birthdays&quot;. In Sri Lanka, it is a custom to bless as &quot;you may live 220 instead of 120&quot;.

In many countries, people receive a gift or congratulations from federal/state institutions on their 100th birthday.

==United States==

As of 2019, there were an estimated 72,000 centenarians living in the U.S.; the 2020 census officially counted 80,139, and the 2010 census had 53,364. However, the U.S. Census Bureau claimed in 1999 that as many as a third of people stating their age as over 100 might be exaggerating.

In the United States, centenarians may request a letter of congratulation from the president of the United States to mark their longevity. Jimmy Carter became the first (and currently only) president to reach the age of 100 on 1 October 2024.

&quot;Today&quot; also presents a segment honoring centenarians and older, sponsored by Smuckers. The tradition was created in 1983 by weather presenter Willard Scott, and is now presented by his successor Al Roker.

In the state of New Mexico, centenarians have been exempt from state income tax since tax year 2002, if they are not dependents of another taxpayer.

==Asia==
Japanese centenarians receive a silver cup and a certificate from the prime minister of Japan upon the Respect for the Aged Day following their 100th birthday, honouring them for their longevity and prosperity in their lives.

In Madhya Pradesh, India, the award known as Shatayu Samman is given out to people who live at least 100 years to promote awareness of good health.

North Korean centenarians receive a birthday congratulatory letter from the Supreme Leader of the DPRK. On 6 July 2022, Pak Hak Sil, a centenarian living in Koup-ri of Kangnam County, Pyongyang, received a birthday letter sent by Kim Jong Un.

In the Philippines, Republic Act No. 10868 better known as the Centenarians Act of 2016 mandates that all living Filipinos residing in the Philippines or overseas receive a birthday congratulatory letter from the President of the Philippines and a ₱100,000 &quot;Centenarian Gift&quot; from the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD).

In Taiwan, people aged 100 or above receive a golden pendant necklace on Chong Yang Festival each year from the president and Ministry of Health and Welfare.

==Europe ==
German centenarians receive a letter of congratulations from the president of Germany.

In Ireland, centenarians can receive a €2,540 &quot;Centenarians&#x27; Bounty&quot; and a letter from the president of Ireland, even if they are resident abroad. Irish people celebrating their 101st birthday may also receive a special silver minted coin with a quote by a famous Irish writer or poet.

Centenarians born in Italy receive a letter of congratulations from the president of Italy.

In the Netherlands, the monarch and their commissioner sends a letter on the 100th birthday and on every birthday beginning with the 105th.

Swedish centenarians receive a telegram from the king and queen of Sweden.

==British and Commonwealth realms==
In Commonwealth realms including the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand centenarians can receive congratulations card greetings from the monarch King Charles III on their 100th birthday. In the UK, greeting cards are also sent by the monarch on every birthday beginning with the 105th.

In Commonwealth realms in which the monarch does not ordinarily reside, honorees can also receive congratulations from the governor-general. In Canada, application must be made through the GGS official website. Similarly, in New Zealand, honorees must apply for greetings through the official government website.

=== British traditions ===

The traditions of British centenarians receiving greetings and congratulations was established by King Edward VII in 1908.

The famous acrobat and tightrope walker Henry Johnson received a congratulatory letter from Edward VII via his royal courtier Viscount Knollys in 1906. The tradition of royal congratulations continued in 1908, when the secretary for King Edward VII sent a congratulatory letter to Reverend Thomas Lord of Horncastle, Lincolnshire, in a newspaper clipping, declaring, &quot;I am commanded by the King to congratulate you on the attainment of your hundredth year, after a most useful life&quot;.
The practice was formalised from 1917, under the reign of King George V, who also sent congratulations then sent by a telegram on the attainment of a diamond wedding anniversary (or jubilee) marking 60 years of marriage.

During the reign of King George V, only 24 telegrams were sent; however, with the aging population, this increased to 273 during 1952, when the longest-reigning monarch Queen Elizabeth II ascended the throne. The Queen also sent a telegram, and later a portrait-style greeting card with the notation, &quot;I am so pleased to know that you are celebrating your one hundredth birthday. I send my congratulations and best wishes to you on such a special occasion.&quot; Each few years the card was updated with a current updated picture of the Queen to ensure people did not receive the same card more than once. The Queen further sent her congratulations on one&#x27;s 105th birthday and every year thereafter as well as on special wedding anniversaries.

==Centenarians in antiquity==
While the number of centenarians per capita was much lower in ancient times than today, the data suggest that they were not unheard of.

Estimates of life expectancy in antiquity are far lower than modern values largely due to the far greater incidence of deaths in infancy or childhood, though adult mortality was also considerably greater than today. The assumption of what constitutes &quot;old age&quot;, or being &quot;elderly&quot;, at least, seems to have remained unchanged since antiquity, the line being generally drawn at either sixty or sixty-five years; Psalm 90:10 in the Hebrew Bible appears to give seventy to eighty years as the natural life expectancy of a person surviving into old age, &quot;The years of our life are seventy, or even by reason of strength eighty&quot;.

A survey of the lifespans of male individuals with entries in the &quot;Oxford Classical Dictionary&quot; (i.e., a sample pre-selected to include those who lived long enough to attain historical notability) found a median lifespan of 72 years, and a range of 32 to 107 years, for 128 individuals born before 100 BC (though the same study found a median lifespan of 66 years for 100 individuals born after 100 BC but no later than 602 AD); by comparison, male individuals listed in &quot;Chambers Biographical Dictionary&quot; who died between 1900 and 1949 had a median lifespan of 71.5 years, with a range between 29 and 105 years. But as indicated above, far fewer in antiquity survived even from early adulthood to such advanced age – probably under a fifth, compared to a global average of two-thirds today. 

The author of a 1994 study concluded that it was only in the second half of the 20th century that medical advances have extended the life expectancy of those who live into adulthood. though this is flatly contradicted by 19th- and early 20th-century census and registration data and by estimates for medieval and ancient populations: US and English expectation of remaining years at age 15 for example rose from about 44 in the mid-19th century to 56 by 1950, and has since increased to 65–67; for English landholders (a relatively privileged group) it was 33 years c.1300, while Ulpian&#x27;s life table for ancient Rome indicates only 30 years. 

Reliable references to individuals in antiquity who lived past 100 years are quite rare, but they do exist. For instance, Cicero&#x27;s wife Terentia was reported by Pliny the Elder to have lived from 98 BC to 6 AD, 103 years. Regnal dates of Bronze Age monarchs are notoriously unreliable; the sixth dynasty Egyptian ruler Pepi II is sometimes listed as having lived , as he is said to have reigned for 94 years, but alternative readings cite a reign of just 64 years. Adad-guppi, mother of the last king of the Neo-Babylonian Empire Nabonidus apparently lived from -544 BC (c. 104 years) according to inscriptions on funeral steles.

Diogenes Laërtius () gives one of the earliest references regarding the plausible centenarian longevity given by a scientist, the astronomer Hipparchus of Nicaea (), who, according to the doxographer, said that the philosopher Democritus of Abdera () lived 109 years. Other ancient accounts of Democritus agree that the philosopher lived at least 90 years. The case of Democritus differs from those of, for example, Epimenides of Crete (7th and 6th centuries BC), who is said to have lived an implausible 154, 157, or 290 years, depending on the source.

Other ancient Greek philosophers thought to have lived beyond the age of 90 include Xenophanes of Colophon (), Pyrrho of Ellis (), and Eratosthenes of Cirene (). Also, the Greek rhetorician Isocrates of Athens (436–338 BC) lived 97/98 years and the famous Greek tragedian Sophocles (497/496-406/405 BC) lived at least 90 years.

Hosius of Córdoba, the man who convinced Constantine the Great to call the First Council of Nicaea, reportedly lived to age 102.
A rare record of an ordinary person who lived to be a centenarian is the tombstone of Roman British legionary veteran Julius Valens, inscribed &quot;VIXIT ANNIS C&quot;.

In the medieval period, Albert Azzo II, Margrave of Milan (d. 1097) is said by Bernold of Constance to have lived past 100 years (&quot;iam maior centenario&quot;).

==Research==

Research in Italy suggests that healthy centenarians have high levels of both vitamin A and vitamin E and that this seems to be important in causing their extreme longevity. Other research contradicts this, however, and has found that this theory does not apply to centenarians from Sardinia, for whom other factors probably play a more important role. A preliminary study carried out in Poland showed that, in comparison with young healthy female adults, centenarians living in Upper Silesia had significantly higher red blood cell glutathione reductase and catalase activities, although serum levels of vitamin E were not significantly higher. Researchers in Denmark have also found that centenarians exhibit a high activity of glutathione reductase in red blood cells. In this study, the centenarians having the best cognitive and physical functional capacity tended to have the highest activity of this enzyme.

Other research has found that people whose parents became centenarians have an increased number of naïve B cells. It is well known that the children of parents who have a long life are also likely to reach a healthy age, but it is not known why, although the inherited genes are probably important. A variation in the gene FOXO3A is known to have a positive effect on the life expectancy of humans, and is found much more often in people living to 100 and beyond – moreover, this appears to be true worldwide.

Men and women who are 100 or older tend to have extroverted personalities, according to Thomas T. Perls, the director of the New England Centenarian Study at Boston University. Centenarians will often have many friends, strong ties to relatives and high self-esteem. In addition, some research suggests that the offspring of centenarians are more likely to age in better cardiovascular health than their peers.

===DNA repair===
Lymphoblastoid cell lines established from blood samples of centenarians have significantly higher activity of the DNA repair protein PARP (Poly ADP ribose polymerase) than cell lines from younger (20 to 70 years old) individuals. The lymphocytic cells of centenarians have characteristics typical of cells from young people, both in their capability of priming the mechanism of repair after H2O2 sublethal oxidative DNA damage and in their PARP capacity. PARP activity measured in the permeabilized mononuclear leukocyte blood cells of thirteen mammalian species correlated with maximum lifespan of the species. These findings suggest that PARP mediated DNA repair activity contributes to the longevity of centenarians, consistent with the DNA damage theory of aging.

===Japanese bio-study===
Many experts attribute Japan&#x27;s high life expectancy to the typical Japanese diet, which is particularly low in refined simple carbohydrates, and to hygienic practices. The number of centenarians in relation to the total population was, in September 2010, 114% higher in Shimane Prefecture than the national average. This ratio was also 92% higher in Okinawa Prefecture. In Okinawa, studies have shown five factors that have contributed to the large number of centenarians in that region:
# A diet that is heavy on grains, fish, and vegetables and light on meat, eggs, and dairy products.
# Low-stress lifestyles, which are proven significantly less stressful than that of the mainland inhabitants of Japan.
# A caring community, where older adults are not isolated and are taken better care of.
# High levels of activity, where locals work until an older age than the average age in other countries, and more emphasis on activities like walking and gardening to keep active.
# Spirituality, where a sense of purpose comes from involvement in spiritual matters and prayer eases the mind of stress and problems.

Although these factors vary from those mentioned in the previous study, the culture of Okinawa has proven these factors to be important in its large population of centenarians.

A historical study from Korea found that male eunuchs in the royal court had a centenarian rate of over 3%, and that eunuchs lived on average 14 to 19 years longer than uncastrated men.

===Epigenetic studies===
By measuring the biological age of various tissues from centenarians, researchers may be able to identify tissues that are protected from aging effects. According to a study of 30 different body parts from centenarians and younger controls, the cerebellum is the youngest brain region (and probably body part) in centenarians (about 15 years younger than expected) according to an epigenetic biomarker of tissue age known as epigenetic clock.

These findings could explain why the cerebellum exhibits fewer neuropathological hallmarks of age related dementias compared to other brain regions. Further, the offspring of semi-supercentenarians (subjects who reached an age of 105–109 years) have a lower epigenetic age than age-matched controls (age difference=5.1 years in peripheral blood mononuclear cells) and centenarians are younger (8.6 years) than expected based on their chronological age.

<doc id="195009" wikidata="Q313864" url="?curid=195009" title="Emperor Momozono">
<text>, posthumously honored as , was the 116th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Momozono&#x27;s reign spanned the years from 1747 until his death in 1762. Momozono&#x27;s reign was mostly quiet, with only one incident occurring that involved a small number of Kuge who advocated for the restoration of direct Imperial rule. These Kuge were punished by the shōgun, who held de facto power in the country. 

Momozono fathered two sons with his one and only lady in waiting, but he died at a young age in 1762. The line of succession fell to Momozono&#x27;s sister, Princess Toshiko, who became Empress Go-Sakuramachi. Due to the young age of Momozono&#x27;s sons, she also became empress regent to the future Emperor Go-Momozono until he became of age to rule.

==Events of Momozono&#x27;s life==
===Early life===
Before Momozono&#x27;s ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (&quot;imina&quot;) was . Tōhito was the firstborn son of Emperor Sakuramachi, while his mother was a concubine named Sadako (定子) (Empress Dowager Kaimei, 開明門院). His Imperial family lived with him in the Dairi of the Heian Palace. Tōhito&#x27;s pre-accession title was initially &quot;Yaho-no-miya&quot; (八穂宮) and later &quot;Sachi-no-miya&quot; (茶地宮). While Prince Tōhito was invested as Crown Prince on 25 April 1747 it is unknown what other events took place in his early life other than the information provided here.

===Reign===
Prince Tōhito acceded to the throne on 9 June 1747 as Emperor when his father abdicated in his favor. The era name was then changed from Enkyō to &quot;Kan&#x27;en&quot; (meaning &quot;Prolonging Lenience&quot;) to mark the occasion. Momozono fathered at least two sons with a court lady named Ichijō Tomiko during his reign. While he held the political title of &quot;Emperor&quot;, it was in name only as the shōguns of the Tokugawa family controlled Japan. During the first year or so of Momozono&#x27;s reign the first performance of the popular eleven-act puppet play &quot;Kanadehon Chūshingura&quot; was performed. The fictionalized story of the play is about samurai revenge, and the 1702 vendetta of the 47 &quot;rōnin&quot;. Also of note was a Ryukyuan diplomatic mission from Shō Kei of the Ryūkyū Kingdom which was received by the shogunate. On 7 October 1749 a powerful storm struck Kyoto, and the keep of Nijō Castle burned after it was struck by lightning. The era name was changed to Hōreki in 1751 to mark the death of the retired Emperor Sakuramachi, and the death of the former &quot;shōgun&quot; Tokugawa Yoshimune. In the year that followed a second &quot;Ryukyuan diplomatic mission&quot; from Shō Boku of the Ryūkyū Kingdom arrived in Edo. Momozono had no role in these missions as they were expected to pay tribute to the shogunate.

The 1754 Hōreki River incident caused the deaths of eighty-eight people due to a harsh project ordered by the shōgun, but again the Emperor was not involved. Another incident though occurred in 1758, when a small number of Kuge were punished by the shogunate for advocating the restoration of direct Imperial rule. Two years later Shōgun Ieshige resigned, and his son became the 10th shōgun of the Tokugawa shogunate. In 1762, Emperor Momozono abdicated the throne in favor of his sister Imperial Princess Toshiko, who became Empress Go-Sakuramachi. His retirement did not last long as he died that same year on 31 August 1762 at the age of 20. Momozono&#x27;s &quot;kami&quot; is enshrined in an Imperial mausoleum (&quot;misasagi&quot;), &quot;Tsuki no wa no misasagi,&quot; at Sennyū-ji in Higashiyama-ku, Kyoto. Also enshrined here are Momozono&#x27;s immediate Imperial predecessors since Emperor Go-Mizunoo – Meishō, Go-Kōmyō, Go-Sai, Reigen, Higashiyama, Nakamikado and Sakuramachi, along with five of his immediate Imperial successors – Go-Sakuramachi, Go-Momozono, Kōkaku, Ninkō, and Kōmei.

==Eras and Kugyō==
The years of Momozono&#x27;s reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or &quot;nengō&quot;. While is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court&#x27;s actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted. In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career.

<doc id="195010" wikidata="Q313870" url="?curid=195010" title="Emperor Sakuramachi">
<text>, posthumously honored as was the 115th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. He was enthroned as Emperor in 1735, a reign that would last until 1747 with his abdication. As with previous Emperors during the Edo period, the Tokugawa shogunate had control over Japan. 

The Emperor&#x27;s role was a religious figure who performed limited duties. This changed when Sakuramachi was granted permission from the &quot;Shōgun&quot; to restore some Imperial rites. Ceremonies such as the Harvest Festival that had previously been absent for over 250 years were now allowed. Sakuramachi had one wife and a concubine with whom he fathered 4 children. His first son would go on to become Emperor Momozono, while his second daughter would later be Empress Go-Sakuramachi. Sakuramachi died on 28 May 1750, which was almost three years after his abdication.

==Events of Sakuramachi&#x27;s life==
===Early life===
Before Sakuramachi&#x27;s ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (&quot;imina&quot;) was . Teruhito was born on 8 February 1720 and was the firstborn son of Emperor Nakamikado, he was also said to be the reincarnation of Prince Shōtoku. Teruhito&#x27;s Imperial family lived with him in the Dairi of the Heian Palace. Events during Teruhito&#x27;s early life included Edo becoming the world&#x27;s largest city in 1721, with a population of 1.1 million people. On 17 July 1728, Teruhito was named crown prince and held the pre-accession title of &quot;Waka-no-miya&quot; (若宮). The only other major event to occur afterwards was a disaster in 1732–33 called the &quot;Kyōhō famine&quot;. This event was caused by swarms of locusts that devastated crops in agricultural communities around the inland sea.

===Reign===
Prince Teruhito acceded to the throne on 13 April 1735 as Emperor when his father abdicated in his favor, the era&#x27;s name was changed from &quot;Kyōhō&quot; to &quot;Genbun&quot; to mark this event. While he held the political title of &quot;Emperor&quot;, it was in name only as the shoguns of the Tokugawa family controlled Japan. With the support of Tokugawa Yoshimune though, Sakuramachi worked for the restoration of some Imperial rites. Two of the first reinstated ceremonies were brought back in the form of rice offerings. is a rice-offering by a newly enthroned Emperor, while is a rice-offering by the Emperor. In 1738, the Emperor performed Esoteric Shinto rituals known as . A major event occurred on 11 January 1741 where a ceremony was performed to mark &quot;Niiname-no-Matsuri&quot; (Harvest Festival). This specific ceremony had otherwise been held in abeyance for the previous 280 years. The &quot;Toyonoakari-no-sechiye&quot; ceremonies were also performed the following day.

The era&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Kanpō&quot; in February 1741 due to the belief in Chinese astrology that the 58th year of the sexagenary cycle brings changes. The provinces of Musashi, Kōzuke, Shimotsuke, and Shinano all had noteworthy devastation from a major flood that occurred in 1742. In Heian-kyō, the Sanjo Bridge was also washed away in this destructive storm cycle. During the close of the Kanpō era, a comet was seen and recorded in the &quot;Nihon Ōdai Ichiran&quot;, a consensus by later researches state that the comet was likely C/1743 X1 (De Cheseaux). The fourth and final era during Sakuramachi&#x27;s reign began in 1744, and was called &quot;Enkyō&quot; (meaning &quot;Becoming Prolonged&quot;). This new era was created to mark the start of a new 60-year cycle of the Chinese zodiac. The last two major events during Sakuramachi&#x27;s reign occurred in 1745, when Tokugawa Ieshige became the new shogun. The first establishment of a market fair in the capital was to be found at Hirano Shrine in Ōmi Province, while in Edo a great fire swept through the city.

===Daijō Tennō===
Emperor Sakuramachi abdicated on 9 June 1747 in favor of his son Prince Toohito, who became Emperor Momozono. Sakuramachi took on the title of Daijō Tennō (Retired Emperor), and the era&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Kan&#x27;en&quot; (meaning &quot;Prolonging Lenience&quot;) to mark the occasion. Events that took place during his time as a Jōkō include a powerful storm that struck Kyoto on 7 October 1749. The damage done included the burning of the keep of Nijō Castle after it was struck by lightning. Sakuramachi died on 28 May 1750 which was almost three years after his abdication. Sakuramachi&#x27;s &quot;kami&quot; is enshrined in an Imperial mausoleum (&quot;misasagi&quot;), &quot;Tsuki no wa no misasagi,&quot; at Sennyū-ji in Higashiyama-ku, Kyoto. Sakuramachi&#x27;s immediate Imperial predecessors since Emperor Go-Mizunoo – Meishō, Go-Kōmyō, Go-Sai, Reigen, Higashiyama and Nakamikado, are also enshrined along with his immediate Imperial successors, including Momozono, Go-Sakuramachi and Go-Momozono.

===Other events===
While the Emperor had no say, a major milestone occurred in Japanese monetary history when the shogunate published an edict in 1736 regarding coinage. This edict declared that henceforth, authorized coinage in the empire would be those copper coins which were marked on the obverse with the character 文 (&quot;Genbun&quot;, also pronounced &quot;bun&quot; in Japanese). The practice of placing the name of the era on coinage continues to present day with .

==Eras and Kugyō==
The years of Sakuramachi&#x27;s reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or &quot;nengō&quot;. While &quot;Kugyō&quot; (公卿) is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court&#x27;s actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted. In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career.

The following eras occurred during Sakuramachi&#x27;s reign: 
* &quot;Kyōhō&quot; (1716–1736)
* &quot;Gembun&quot; (1736–1741)
* &quot;Kanpō&quot; (1741–1744)
* &quot;Enkyō&quot; (1744–1748)

During Sakuramachi&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included: 
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;
* &quot;Naidaijin&quot;
* &quot;Dainagon&quot;

==Genealogy== 

Emperor Sakuramachi&#x27;s family included at least 3 children who were born to 2 consorts:

===Spouse===
===Concubine===
===Issue===
Emperor Sakuramachi fathered a total of 3 children with a wife and a concubine.

<doc id="195011" wikidata="Q120564" url="?curid=195011" title="Empress Meishō">
<text>, posthumously honored as , was the 109th monarch of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Her reign lasted from 1629 to 1643.

In the history of Japan, Meishō was the seventh of eight women to become empress regnant. The six who reigned before her were Suiko, Kōgyoku/Saimei, Jitō, Genmei, Genshō, and Kōken/Shōtoku. Her sole female successor was Go-Sakuramachi.

==Genealogy==
Before Meishō&#x27;s accession to the Chrysanthemum Throne, her personal name (her &quot;imina&quot;) was ; and her pre-accession title was . She was the second daughter of Emperor Go-Mizunoo. Her mother was Tokugawa Masako, daughter of the second Tokugawa &quot;shōgun&quot;, Tokugawa Hidetada and his wife Oeyo. Hidetada was the son of Tokugawa Ieyasu and his consort, Oai.

Meishō lived within the Inner Apartments of the Heian Palace, as opposed to the section reserved for the women of the Imperial Court. She had no children of her own, and was succeeded by her younger paternal half-brother, Go-Kōmyō. Her name was derived by combining the names of two previous empresses, Empress Genmei (707–715) and her daughter Empress Genshō (715–724).

==Events of Meishō&#x27;s life==
Okiko&quot;-naishinnō&quot; became empress following the abdication of her father. The succession (&quot;senso&quot;) was considered to have been received by the new monarch; and shortly thereafter, Empress Meishō is said to have acceded (&quot;sokui&quot;). The events during her lifetime shed some light on her reign. The years of Meishō&#x27;s reign correspond with the development and growth of the Tokugawa shogunate under the leadership of Tokugawa Iemitsu.

* January 9, 1624: The birth of an Imperial princess who will become known by the posthumous name of Empress Meishō.
* 1627 (&quot;Kan&#x27;ei 6&quot;): The : Emperor Go-Mizunoo was accused of having bestowed honorific purple garments to more than ten priests despite the &quot;shogun&quot;″s edict which banned them for two years (probably in order to break the bond between the Emperor and religious circles). The shogunate intervened and invalidated the bestowal of the garments.
* December 22, 1629 (&quot;Kan&#x27;ei 6, 8th day of the 11th month&quot;): The emperor renounced the throne in favor of his daughter. The reign of the new empress was understood to have begun. She was aged 5; and she would grow to become the first woman to occupy the throne since Empress Shōtoku, the 48th sovereign who died in 770.
* 1632 (&quot;Kan&#x27;ei 9, 24th day of the 1st month&quot;): Former &quot;shōgun&quot; Tokugawa Hidetada died.
* 1633 (&quot;Kan&#x27;ei 10, 20th day of the 1st month&quot;): Earthquake in Odawara in Sagami Province.
* 1634 (&quot;Kanei 11&quot;): Shogun Tokugawa Iemitsu visited Miyako; and it is believed that Meishō&#x27;s father actually ruled in her name until she abdicated in favor of her younger half-brother.
* 1635 (&quot;Kanei 12&quot;): An ambassador from King Injo of Korea is received in Miyako.
* 1637 (&quot;Kanei 14&quot;): A major rebellion occurs in the Arima and Shimabara with many Christians involved; shogunal forces are sent to quell the disturbance.
* 1638 (&quot;Kanei 15&quot;): The Arima and Shimabara revolt is crushed; and 37,000 of the rebels are killed. The Christian religion is banned in Japan under pain of death.
* 1640 (&quot;Kanei 17&quot;): A Spanish ship from Macau brought a delegation of 61 people to Nagasaki. They arrived on July 6, 1640; and on August 9, all of them were decapitated and their heads were stuck on poles.
* 1641 (&quot;Kanei 18&quot;): Meishō&#x27;s half brother, Prince Tsuguhito, was named Crown Prince.
* 1643 (&quot;Kanei 20&quot;): An ambassador from the King of Korea arrived in Japan.
* November 14, 1643 (&quot;Kanei 20&#x27;, 29th day of the 9th month&quot;): In the , the empress abdicated; and the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) was received by her brother.
* 1643 (&quot;Kanei 20, 23rd day of the 4th month&quot;): Emperor Go-Kōmyō is said to have acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;).

Empress Meishō reigned for fifteen years. Although there were seven other reigning empresses, their successors were most often selected from amongst the males of the paternal Imperial bloodline, which is why some conservative scholars argue that the women&#x27;s reigns were temporary and that male-only succession tradition must be maintained in the 21st century. Empress Gemmei, who was followed on the throne by her daughter, Empress Gensho, remains the sole exception to this conventional argument.

* December 4, 1696: The former empress died at age 72.
The &quot;kami&quot; of this empress is venerated in the imperial mausoleum at &quot;Tsuki no wa no misasagi&quot;, which is located at Sennyū-ji in Higashiyama-ku, Kyoto. Also enshrined is her father, Emperor Go-Mizunoo and her immediate Imperial successors – Go-Kōmyō, Go-Sai, Reigen, Higashiyama, Nakamikado, Sakuramachi, Momozono, Go-Sakuramachi and Go-Momozono.

===Kugyō===
 is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court&#x27;s actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Meishō&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included:
* &quot;Sesshō&quot;, Ichijō Akiyoshi, 1629–1635
* &quot;Sesshō&quot;, Nijō Yasumichi, 1635–1647
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;
* &quot;Naidaijin&quot;
* &quot;Dainagon&quot;

==Era of Meishō&#x27;s reign==
The years of Meishō&#x27;s reign are encompassed within one era name or &quot;nengō&quot;.

== Events ==
Prince Masahito became emperor following the abdication of his emperor-father. The succession (the &quot;senso&quot;) was considered to have been received by the new monarch; and shortly thereafter, Emperor Go-Mizunoo is said to have acceded (the &quot;sokui&quot;). A distinct act of &quot;senso&quot; is unrecognized prior to Emperor Tenji; and all sovereigns except Jitō, Yōzei, Go-Toba, and Fushimi have &quot;senso&quot; and &quot;sokui&quot; in the same year until the reign of Emperor Go-Murakami. The events during Go-Mizunoo&#x27;s lifetime shed some light on his reign. The years correspond with a period in which Tokugawa Hidetada and Tokugawa Iemitsu were leaders at the pinnacle of the Tokugawa shogunate.

On 29 June 1596, Masahito, who would be known posthumously as Go-Minzunoo, was born. Toyotomi Hideyori came to Miyako to visit the former-Shōgun Tokugawa Ieyasu on 20 May 1610 (&quot;Keichō 15, 27th day of the 3rd month&quot;); the same day, Go-Yōzei announced his intention to renounce the throne. Following the abdication during the on 9 May 1611 (&quot;Keichō 16&quot;), 16-year-old Go-Mizunoo became Emperor. The Siege of Osaka, during which Shōgun Tokugawa Hidetada vanquished Toyotomi Hideyori and set fire to Osaka Castle, occurred in 1614 (&quot;Keichō 19&quot;). He returned to Edo for the winter.

A strong earthquake struck on 26 November 1614 (&quot;Keichō 19, 25th day of the 10th month&quot;). A great bell for Daibutsu Temple in Kyoto was cast, also in that year. The Osaka Summer Battle began in 1615 (&quot;Keichō 20&quot;). Tokugawa Ieyasu and his son, Shōgun Hidetada, marched again to Osaka Castle(&quot;Genna 1&quot;), which was captured and burned. Hideyori was thought to have died by suicide but his body was never found. It was rumored he had fled to Satsuma, where a refuge had been prepared for him in advance. Ieyasu died at Suruga the following year (&quot;Genna 2, 17th day of the 4th month&quot;) and Former-Emperor Go-Yōzei died in 1617 (&quot;Genna 3, 26th day of the 8th month&quot;). Go-Yōzei was buried at the . Tokugawa Masako, daughter of Shōgun Hidetada, entered the palace as a consort of the emperor and the two married (&quot;Genna 6&quot;). A number of severe fires broke out in Kyoto during April 1620 (&quot;Genna 6&quot;).

In 1623, the Emperor made Tokugawa Iemitsu, son of Hidetada, a Shōgun (&quot;Genna 9&quot;) and later visited Nijō Castle (&quot;Kan&#x27;ei 3, 6th day of the 9th month&quot;). The occurred in 1627 (&quot;Kan&#x27;ei 6&quot;) when the Emperor was accused of having bestowed honorific purple garments to more than ten priests despite the shōgun&#x27;s edict which banned them for two years, a practice probably set in place to break the bond between the Emperor and religious circles. The shogunate intervened and made the bestowing of the garments invalid. The priests which had been honored by the emperor were sent into exile by the bakufu. Go-Mizunoo abdicated on 22 December 1629 (&quot;Kan&#x27;ei 6, 8th day of the 11th month&quot;), renouncing the throne to his daughter, Okiko, on the same day that the priests of the &quot;Purple Robe Incident&quot; went into exile. Okiko became the Empress Meishō. For the rest of his long life, Go-Mizuno&quot;-in&quot; concentrated on various aesthetic projects and interests, of which perhaps the best-known are the magnificent Japanese gardens of the Shugakuin Imperial Villa.
Former Emperor Go-Mizunoo died on 11 September 1680 (&quot;Enpō 8, 19th day of the 8th month&quot;). Go-Mizunoo&#x27;s memory is honored at Sennyū-ji in Higashiyama-ku, Kyoto where a designated Imperial mausoleum (&quot;misasagi&quot;) is located. It is named &quot;Tsuki no wa no misasagi&quot;. Also enshrined are this emperor&#x27;s immediate Imperial successors – Meishō, Go-Kōmyō, Go-Sai, Reigen, Higashiyama, Nakamikado, Sakuramachi, Momozono, Go-Sakuramachi and Go-Momozono.

===Kugyō===
 is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court&#x27;s actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Go-Mizunoo&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included: &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Kujō Yukiie (1608–1612), &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Takatsukasa Nobuhisa (1612–1615), &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Nijō Akizane (1615–1619), &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Kujō Yukiie (1619–1623), &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Konoe Nobuhiro, (1623–1629), &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Ichijō Akiyoshi (1629), &quot;Sadaijin&quot;, &quot;Udaijin&quot;, Konoe Nobuhiro (1619), &quot;Naidaijin&quot;, and &quot;Dainagon&quot;

== Eras ==
The years of Go-Mizunoo&#x27;s reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or &quot;nengō&quot;: &quot;Keichō&quot; (1596–1615), &quot;Genna&quot; (1615–1624), and &quot;Kan&#x27;ei&quot; (1624–1644).

==Events of Go-Yōzei&#x27;s life==
Prince Katahito became emperor when his grandfather abdicated. The succession (&quot;senso&quot;) was considered to have been received by the new monarch; and shortly thereafter, Emperor Go-Yōzei is said to have acceded (&quot;sokui&quot;). A distinct act of &quot;senso&quot; was unrecognized prior to Emperor Tenji and all sovereigns except Jitō, Yōzei, Go-Toba, and Fushimi have &quot;senso&quot; and &quot;sokui&quot; in the same year until the reign of Emperor Go-Murakami. The events during his lifetime shed some light on his reign. The years of Go-Yōzei&#x27;s reign correspond with the start of the Tokugawa shogunate under the leadership of Tokugawa Ieyasu and Tokugawa Hidetada.

On 31 December 1571, the Imperial prince who became known by the posthumous name of Go-Yōzei&quot;-tennō&quot; was born. On 5 November 1586, Prince Katahito was given the title Crown Prince and heir and within a month (&quot;Tenshō 14, on the 7th day of the 11th month&quot;), Ogimachi gave the reins of government to his grandson, who would become Emperor Go-Yōzei. There had been no such Imperial transition since Emperor Go-Hanazono abdicated in 1464 (&quot;Kanshō&quot; 5). The dearth of abdications is attributable to the disturbed state of the country and because there was neither any dwelling for an ex-emperor nor excess funds in the treasury to support him. In 1586 (&quot;Tenshō 14, in the 12th month&quot;), a marriage with Lady Asahi, the youngest sister of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and Tokugawa Ieyasu, was arranged and the &quot;kampaku&quot;, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, was nominated to be &quot;Daijō-daijin&quot; (Chancellor of the Realm). In 1588 (&quot;Tenshō 16, 7th month&quot;), Emperor Go-Yōzei and his father visit Toyotomi Hideyoshi&#x27;s mansion in Kyoto. This was the first time that an emperor appeared in public since 1521.
Hideyoshi led an army to the Kantō where he lay siege to Odawara Castle in 1588 (&quot;Tenshō 18, 7th month&quot;). When the fortress fell, Hōjō Ujimasa died and his brother, Hōjō Ujinao submitted to Hideyoshi&#x27;s power, thus ending a period of serial internal warfare which had continued uninterrupted since the Ōnin War (1467–1477).

The &quot;Keichō&quot; expedition to Korea was en route to invade China in 1592 (&quot;Keichō 1&quot;). Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the &quot;Taikō&quot; died in his Fushimi Castle at the age of 63 on 18 September 1598 (&quot;Keichō 3, on the 18th day of the 8th month&quot;). The Battle of Sekigahara took place in 1600. On 21 October (&quot;Keichō 5, 15th day of the 9th month&quot;), the Tokugawa clan and its allies decisively vanquished all opposition. Two years later (&quot;Keichō 8&quot;), the Kyōto Daibutsu was destroyed by fire. Tokugawa Ieyasu became &quot;shōgun&quot; on 24 March 1603 (&quot;Keichō 8&quot;), which effectively began what was later known as the Edo &quot;bakufu&quot;. Toyotomi Hideyori was elevated to Naidaijin in the Imperial court. In 1605 (&quot;Keichō 10, 15th day of the 12th month&quot;), a new volcanic island, Hachijōko-jima, arose from the sea at the side of Hachijō Island (八丈島 Hachijō-jima) in the Izu Islands (伊豆諸島, Izu-shotō) which stretch south and east from the Izu Peninsula. In 1606 (&quot;Keichō 11&quot;), construction began on Edo Castle and on Sunpu Castle the following year (&quot;Keichō 12&quot;). 1609 (&quot;Keichō 14&quot;) saw the Invasion of Ryukyu by Shimazu &quot;daimyō&quot; of Satsuma. During the following year (&quot;Keichō 15&quot;), reconstruction of the Daibutsu hall in Kyōto began and Toyotomi Hideyori came to Kyoto to visit the former-Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu. On 20 May 1610 (&quot;Keichō 15, the 27th day of the 3rd month&quot;), the emperor announces his intention to resign in favor of his son Masahito. Go-Yōzei abdicated on 9 May 1611 and his son Prince Masahito received the succession (the &quot;senso&quot;). Shortly thereafter, Go-Mizunoo formally ascended to the throne (the &quot;sokui&quot;).

===Legacy===
Go-Yōzei&#x27;s reign corresponds to the rule of Toyotomi Hideyoshi and the beginning of the Edo &quot;Bakufu&quot;. He was the sovereign who confirmed the legitimacy of their accession to power; and this period allowed the Imperial Family to recover a small portion of its diminished powers. This Emperor gave Toyotomi Hideyoshi the rank of &quot;Taikō&quot;, originally a title given to the father of the emperor&#x27;s chief advisor (&quot;Kampaku&quot;), or a retired &quot;Kampaku&quot;, which was essential to increase his status and effectively stabilize his power.

When Tokugawa Ieyasu was given the title of &quot;Sei-i Taishōgun&quot;, the future of any anticipated Tokugawa shogunate was by no means assured, nor was his relationship to the emperor at all settled. He gradually began to interfere in the affairs of the Imperial Court. The right to grant ranks of court nobility and change the era became a concern of the &quot;bakufu&quot;. However, the Imperial Court&#x27;s poverty during the Warring States Era seemed likely to become a thing of the past, as the &quot;bakufu&quot; provided steadily for its financial needs.

Go-Yōzei did abdicate in favor of his third son; but he wanted to be succeeded by his younger brother, Imperial Prince Hachijō-no-miya Toshihito (八条宮智仁親王) (first of the Hachijō-no-miya line, later called Katsura-no-miya), who built the Katsura Imperial Villa.

Go-Yōzei loved literature and art. He published the &quot;Kobun Kokyo&quot; and part of &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; with movable type dedicated to the emperor by Toyotomi Hideyoshi.

After abdication, Go-Yōzei lived for six years in the Sentō Imperial Palace; and thereafter, it became the usual place to which abdicated emperors would retire. The name of this palace and its gardens was &quot;Sentō-goshō&quot;; and emperors who had abdicated were sometimes called &quot;Sentō-goshō&quot;. Go-Yōzei died on 25 September 1617. The &quot;kami&quot; of Emperor Go-Yōzei is enshrined with other emperors at the imperial mausoleum (&quot;misasagi&quot;) called &quot;Fukakusa no kita no misasagi&quot; (深草北陵) in Fushimi-ku, Kyoto.

===Kugyō===
&quot;Kugyō&quot; (公卿) is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court&#x27;s actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Go-Hanazono&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included:

* &quot;Kampaku&quot; (Regent for an adult Emperor):
** Hashiba (Toyotomi) Hideyoshi (1585–1592)
** Hashiba (Toyotomi) Hidetsugu (1592–1595)
** Kujō (Fujiwara) Kanetaka (1601–1604)
** Konoe (Fujiwara) Nobutada (1605–1606)
** Takatsukasa (Fujiwara) Nobufusa (1606–1609)
** Kujō (Fujiwara) Tadahide (1609–1612)
* &quot;Daijō-daijin&quot; (Chancellor):
** Hashiba (Toyotomi) Hideyoshi (1586–1598)
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot; (Minister of the Left):
** Konoe (Fujiwara) Nobusuke (1585–1592)
** Hashiba (Toyotomi) Hidetsugu (1592–1595)
** Kujō (Fujiwara) Kanetaka (1601)
** Konoe Nobutada (formerly Nobusuke, second time, 1601–1605)
** Takatsukasa (Fujiwara) Nobufusa (1606–1609)
* &quot;Udaijin&quot; (Minister of the Right):
** Imadegawa (Fujiwara) Harusue (1585–1595, 1599–1603)
** Shōgun Tokugawa (Minamoto) Ieyasu (1603)
** Hashiba (Toyotomi) Hideyori (1605–1607)
** Kujō (Fujiwara) Tadahide (1607–1612)
* &quot;Naidaijin&quot; (Minister of the center):
** Hashiba (Toyotomi) Hideyoshi (1585–1587)
** Oda (Taira) Nobukatsu (1587–1590)
** Sanjōnishi Kinkuni (one day in 1588)
** Hashiba (Toyotomi) Hidetsugu (1592)
** Tokugawa (Minamoto) Ieyasu (1596–1603)
** Hashiba (Toyotomi) Hideyori (1603–1605)
** Shōgun Tokugawa (Minamoto) Hidetada (1605–1606)
** Takatsukasa (Fujiwara) Nobufusa (1606)
** Takatsukasa (Fujiwara) Nobuhisa (1611–1612)

==Eras of Go-Yōzei&#x27;s reign==
The years of Go-Yōzei&#x27;s reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or &quot;nengō&quot;: &quot;Tenshō&quot; (1573–1592), &quot;Bunroku&quot; (1592–1596), and &quot;Keichō&quot; (1596–1615).

==Events of Go-Nara&#x27;s life==
* Daiei 6, in the 4th month (June 9, 1526): Go-Nara was proclaimed emperor upon the death of his father, Emperor Go-Kashiwabara. He began his reign at age 31.
* Daiei 6, 7th month (1526): An army from Awa Province marched towards Miyako. Hosokawa Takakuni attacked these forces at the Katsura River, but his forces were unsuccessful. Hosokawa Takakage came to the aid of Takakuni, and their combined forces were successful in stopping the advancing army.
* Daiei 6, 12th month (1526): &quot;Shōgun&quot; Ashikaga Yoshiharu invited archers from neighboring provinces to come to the capital for an archery contest.
* Kyōroku gannen or Kyōroku 1 (1528): Former &quot;Kampuku&quot; Konoe Tanye became &quot;Sadaijin.&quot; The former &quot;Nadaijin&quot; Minamoto-no Mitsukoto became &quot;Udaijin.&quot; Former &quot;Dainagon&quot; Kiusho Tanemitsu became &quot;Nadaijin&quot;.
* Tenbun 4, 26th day of 2nd month (March 29, 1535): Go-Nara was formally installed as emperor. The Imperial Court was so impoverished, that a nationwide appeal for contributions went out. Contributions from the Hōjō clan, the Ōuchi clan, the Imagawa clan, and other great &quot;daimyō&quot; clans of the &quot;Sengoku&quot; period allowed the Emperor to carry out the formal coronation ceremonies ten years later. The Imperial Court&#x27;s poverty was so extreme that the Emperor was forced to sell his calligraphy.
* Tenbun 11, 25th day of the 8th month (1543): Portuguese ship drifts ashore at Tanegashima, and European guns are introduced into Japan.
* Tenbun 20, 8th to 9th month (1551): Courtiers in preparation to move the emperor from war-torn Kyoto to the Ōuchi city of Yamaguchi were caught in the Tainei-ji incident, a coup within the Ōuchi clan. The massacre of the courtiers in Yamaguchi resulted in a widespread loss of court records along with knowledge of court rituals and imperial calendar-making. The emperor remained in Kyoto.
* Kōji 3, 5th day of 9th month (1557): Emperor Go-Nara died at age 62. He was unburied for 70 days.

Go-Nara is enshrined with other emperors at the imperial tomb called &quot;Fukakusa no kita no misasagi&quot; (深草北陵) in Fushimi-ku, Kyoto.

===Kugyō===
&quot;Kugyō&quot; (公卿) is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court&#x27;s actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Go-Nara&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included:
* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Konoe Sakihisa, 1536–1612.
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;
* &quot;Nadaijin&quot;
* &quot;Dainagon&quot;

==Eras of Go-Nara&#x27;s reign==
The years of Go-Nara&#x27;s reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or &quot;nengō&quot;.
* &quot;Daiei&quot; (1521–1528)
* &quot;Kyōroku&quot; (1528–1532)
* &quot;Tenbun&quot; (1532–1555)
* &quot;Kōji&quot; (1555–1558)

== Events of Go-Kashiwabara&#x27;s life ==
In 1500, he became Emperor upon the death of his father, the Emperor Go-Tsuchimikado. However, because of the after-effects of the Ōnin War, the Imperial Family was left so impoverished that he was unable to perform the formal coronation ceremony. On the 3rd month, 22nd day of 1521, thanks to contributions from Honganji Jitsunyo (本願寺実如, Rennyo&#x27;s son) and the Muromachi Bakufu, the Emperor was finally able to carry out this ceremony.

Because of the Ōnin War, the scattering of the Court Nobility, and the poverty of the Imperial Court, the Emperor&#x27;s authority fell to a low point.

* Bunki 1 (1501): The former Shōgun Ashikaga Yoshimura was exiled; and he retired to Suō Province. The former shōgun lived in exile in the home of the daimyō of that han. He changed his name to Ashikaga Yoshitane. He had many supporters, and he summoned the military forces of western Japan to come to his aid. Hosokawa Masamoto was made master of all the provinces which encircled the Kinai.
* Bunki 2, in the 7th month (1502): Minamoto Yoshitane was elevated to the 2nd tier of the 4th class of &quot;kuge&quot; officials; and he expressed thanks to the emperor for that honor. In the same month, the name of Ashikaga Yoshitaka was changed to that of Yoshizumi.
* Bunki 3 (1503): There was a great drought in the summer of this year.
* Eishō 1 (1504): A great famine.
* Eishō 5, in the 1st month (1508): A new revolt in Miyako and the assassination of Hosokawa Masamoto encouraged former-Shōgun Ashikaga Yoshitane in believing that this would be a good opportunity to re-take Miyako. He assembled his troops and marched at their head towards the capital; and by the 6th month of &quot;Eishō&quot; 5, he was once more in command of the streets of Miyako. Starting in 1508, Yoshitane is known as the Muromachi period&#x27;s 10th shōgun
* Eishō 9, following the Three Ports Riots of 1510 in Joseon Korea, the Emperor made concessions that led to the Agreement of 1512 and reconciliation with the Korean government.
* Daiei 5, on the 1st day of the 1st month (1525): All ceremonies in the court were suspended because of the lack of funds to support them.
* Daiei 6, on the 7th day of the 4th month (1525): Go-Kashiwabara died at the age of 63 years. He had reigned 26 years; that is, his reign lasted 3 years in the nengō &quot;Bunki,&quot; 17 years in the nengō &quot;Eishō,&quot; and 6 years in the nengō &quot;Daiei.&quot; The emperor was found dead in his archives.

Emperor Go-Kashiwabara is enshrined with other emperors at the imperial tomb called &quot;Fukakusa no kita no misasagi&quot; (深草北陵) in Fushimi-ku, Kyoto.

<doc id="195017" wikidata="Q380623" url="?curid=195017" title="Emperor Go-Tsuchimikado">
<text>was the 103rd emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. His reign spanned the years from 1464 through 1500.

This 15th-century sovereign was named after the 12th-century Emperor Tsuchimikado and , translates literally as &quot;later&quot;; and thus, he could be called the &quot;Later Emperor Tsuchimikado&quot;, or, in some older sources, may be identified as &quot;Emperor Tsuchimikado, the second,&quot; or as &quot;Emperor Tsuchimikado II.&quot;

==Genealogy==
Before his ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (his &quot;imina&quot;) was .

He was the eldest son of Emperor Go-Hanazono. His mother was Ōinomikado (Fujiwara) Nobuko (大炊御門（藤原）信子), daughter of Fujiwara Takanaga (藤原高長)

==Events of Go-Tsuchimikado&#x27;s life==
* August 21, 1464 (&quot;Kanshō 5, 7th month&quot;): In the 36th year of Go-Hanazono&quot;-tennō&quot;″s reign (後花園天皇三十六年), the emperor abdicated; and the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) was received by his son. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Go-Tsuchimikado is said to have acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;).

Shortly after his enthronement, the &quot;Ōnin&quot; War took place. Temples, shrines, and mansions of court nobles, among others, were burned to the ground. The Imperial Court&#x27;s finances dried up, and the Court declined. The Emperor supported the Yoshida family&#x27;s policy of establishing a new kind of State Shinto which could add social and political cohesion in the country devastated by civil war.

Until former-emperor Go-Komatsu died in 1433, Go-Hanazono held the title of formal head of the Daïri, the real power in the court was wielded by his uncle, who continued a practice known as cloistered rule. After this, Go-Hanazono enjoyed 30 years of direct imperial rule, until his abdication; and then the conventional pattern of indirect government by cloistered emperors was again resumed. The extended duration of Go-Tsuchimikado&#x27;s reign—lasting thirty-six years, two months—is the longest of any sovereign in the historical period prior to Emperor Kōkaku.

After the end of the War, there was little enthusiasm for reviving the Imperial Court&#x27;s ancient ceremonies. On October 21, 1500, the Emperor died. His successor Go-Kashiwabara lacked the funds to pay for the funeral ceremony, and the deceased emperor&#x27;s body lay in a palace storeroom for over a month before a donation was made to the court, and the funeral could be observed.

Go-Tuschimikado is enshrined with other emperors at the imperial tomb called &quot;Fukakusa no kita no misasagi&quot; (深草北陵) in Fushimi-ku, Kyoto.

===Kugyō===
&quot;Kugyō&quot; (公卿) is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court&#x27;s actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Go-Tsuchimikado&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included:
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;
* &quot;Naidaijin&quot;
* &quot;Dainagon&quot;

==Eras of Go-Tsuchimikado&#x27;s reign==
The years of Go-Tsuchimikado&#x27;s reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or &quot;nengō&quot;.
* &quot;Kanshō&quot; (1460–1466)
* &quot;Bunshō&quot; (1466–1467)
* &quot;Ōnin&quot; (1467–1469)
* &quot;Bunmei&quot; (1469–1487)
* &quot;Chōkyō&quot; (1487–1489)
* &quot;Entoku&quot; (1489–1492)
* &quot;Meiō&quot; (1492–1501)

<doc id="195018" wikidata="Q451926" url="?curid=195018" title="Emperor Go-Hanazono">
<text>(July 10, 1419 – January 18, 1471) was the 102nd emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. His reign spanned the years from 1428 through 1464.

This 15th-century sovereign was named after the 14th-century Emperor Hanazono and &quot;go-&quot; (後) translates as &quot;later&quot;, and thus, he could be called the &quot;Later Emperor Hanazono&quot;, or in some older sources, may be identified as &quot;Hanazono, the second&quot; or as &quot;Hanazono II&quot;.

==Genealogy==
Before his ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (&quot;imina&quot;) was simply .

He was the eldest son of Imperial Prince Fushimi-no-miya Sadafusa (伏見宮貞成親王) (1372–1456). His mother was Sachiko (幸子) (1390–1448), daughter of Niwata Tsuneari (庭田経有).

His father was the 3rd of the Fushimi-no-miya line and grandson of the Northern Pretender Emperor Sukō, making Go-Hanazono the great-grandson of Sukō and 3rd cousin to his predecessor, Emperor Shōkō. He was also the great-great-great grandson of Emperor Go-Fushimi. This is the second most remote relationship between an emperor and his successor after that between Emperor Go-Komatsu (both the sixth Northern Pretender and the 100th in the main line) and his predecessor in the official line, Emperor Go-Kameyama, who was his fourth cousin twice removed.

**Daughter: Princess Shogon (d.1464)

==Events of Go-Hanazono&#x27;s life==
Because the previous emperor, Emperor Shōkō had no son, retired Emperor Go-Komatsu needed to secure the Jimyōin inheritance against the Daikakuji line, before Emperor Shōkō died, he adopted a son out of the Fushimi-no-miya house, who became Emperor Go-Hanazono after Shōkō&#x27;s death.

* 1428 (&quot;Shōchō 1, 20th day of the 7th month&quot;): In the 17th year of Shōkō&quot;-tennō&quot;″s reign (称光天皇十七年), the emperor died at age 27; and the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) was received by his adopted son.
* Shōchō 1, on the 29th day of the 7th month (1428): Emperor Go-Hanazono is said to have acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;). The new emperor is age 10.
* 1429 (&quot;Eikyō 1, 9th day of the 3rd month&quot;): Minamoto-no Yoshinobu is honored in court; and thereafter, he is known as Shōgun Ashikaga Yoshinori.
* 1433 (&quot;Eikyō 5, 6th month&quot;): The Emperor of China, at that time the Xuande Emperor, addressed a letter to Yoshinori in which he gave the Shōgun the title, &quot;King of Japan.&quot;
* 1441 (&quot;Kakitsu 1, 24th day of the 6th month&quot;): Shōgun Yoshinori is murdered at age 48 by Akamatsu Mitsusuke; and shortly thereafter, his 8-year-old son, Ashikaga Yoshikatsu, is proclaimed as the new Shogun.
* 1441 (&quot;Kakitsu 1, 9th month&quot;): The assassins of Yoshinori kill themselves.
* 1442 (&quot;Kakitsu 3, 21 day of the 7th month&quot;): Shōgun Yoshikatsu died at the age of 10. He enjoyed riding horses; but he was gravely injured in a fall from a horse, and died as a result. He was shōgun for only three years. His 8-year-old brother, Yoshinari, was then named shogun.
* 1443 (&quot;Kakitsu 3, 23rd day of the 9th month&quot;).: An armed group of rebels penetrated the palace defenses. A fire was started and one of the men sought to kill Go-Hanazono, but the emperor escaped. However, the intruders managed to steal the Three Sacred Treasures: the mirror, the sword and the jewel. Later, a guard found the mirror and a priest found the sword, but the location of the jewel was not known until the 8th month of the starting year of the &quot;Bun&#x27;an-era&quot; (1444).
* 1451 (&quot;Hōtoku 3, 7th month &quot;): A delegation from the Ryukyu Islands arrives for the first time in Heian-kyō (Kyoto).
* 1451 (&quot;Hōtoku 3, 8th month &quot;): Shōgun Yoshinari sent a letter to the Emperor of China, at that time, the Jingtai Emperor.
* 1453 (&quot;Kyōtoku 2, 6th month&quot;): The name of Shōgun Minamoto-no Yoshinari was changed to Ashikaga Yoshimasa.
* 1458 (&quot;Chōroku 2, 8th month&quot;): The Sacred Jewel is retrieved from the former Southern Court. It is returned to Miyako to join the other Sacred Treasures.
* 1464 (&quot;Kanshō 5, 7th month&quot;): Go-Hanazono resigned his throne in favor of his son, who would be known as Emperor Go-Tsuchimikado.

Until former-Emperor Go-Komatsu died in 1433, Emperor Go-Hanazono held the title of formal head of the &quot;Dairi&quot;, the real power in the court was wielded by his uncle, who continued a practice known as cloistered rule. After this, Go-Hanazono enjoyed 30 years of direct imperial rule, until his abdication on August 21, 1464, when the conventional pattern of indirect government by cloistered emperors was again resumed.

* January 18, 1471 (&quot;Bunmei 3, 12th month&quot;): Former Emperor Go-Hanazono died at age 52.

<doc id="195020" wikidata="Q123052" url="?curid=195020" title="Emperor Go-Komatsu">
<text>was the 100th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession, and the sixth and final Emperor of the Northern Court.

He is officially considered to have been the Northern pretender from 24 May 1382 to 21 October 1392, when upon Emperor Go-Kameyama&#x27;s abdication, Go-Komatsu is understood to have been a legitimate emperor (the 100th sovereign) from that date. In 1392, following the post&quot;-Nanboku-chō&quot; unification of the two formerly contending courts, the Southern Emperor Emperor Go-Kameyama reached an agreement with Go-Komatsu to alternate control of the throne between the Northern and Southern courts on a ten-year plan which effectively signaled the end of the southern court&#x27;s claims to sovereignty. However, Go-Komatsu reneged, not only ruling for 20 years until his own abdication on 5 October 1412, but was succeeded by his own son, rather than by one from the former Southern Court. According to pre-Meiji scholars, Go-Komatsu&#x27;s reign as a legitimate emperor spanned the years from 1392 through 1412. The present Japanese Imperial Family is descended from the 
three Northern Court emperors.

This Nanboku-chō &quot;sovereign&quot; was named after the 9th-century Emperor Kōkō, and &quot;go-&quot; (後), translates literally as &quot;later.&quot; Jien&#x27;s &quot;Gukanshō&quot; explains that Kōkō was called &quot;the Emperor of Komatsu&quot;. The 14th-century pretender and emperor may be called the &quot;later Emperor Kōkō&quot; or the &quot;later Emperor Komatsu&quot;. The Japanese word &quot;go&quot; has also been translated to mean the &quot;second one;&quot; and in some older sources, this would-be emperor may be identified as &quot;Komatsu, the second&quot;, or as &quot;Komatsu II.&quot;

==Genealogy==
Before his accession to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (his &quot;imina&quot;) was .

Go-Komatsu was the first son of Emperor Go-En&#x27;yū. His mother was Tsūyōmonin no Itsuko (通陽門院厳子), daughter of the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Sanjō Kimitada (三条公忠).

* Consort: Hinonishi Motoko (日野西資子, 1384–1440) later Kohan’mon-in (光範門院), Hinonishi Sukekuni&#x27;s daughter
** First son: Imperial Prince Mihito (1401–1428実仁親王) later Emperor Shōkō
** Second son: Prince Ogawa (1404–1425; 小川宮), Emperor Shōkō&#x27;s crown prince
** First daughter: Princess Riei (理永女王; 1406–1447)
*Lady-in-waiting: Kanrouji Tsuneko (甘露寺経子), Kanrouji Kanenaga&#x27;s daughter
*Naishi: Hinonishi Sukekuni&#x27;s daughter
*Naishi: Shirakawa Suketada&#x27;s daughter

He was named after Emperor Kōkō, who had the alternate name Komatsu, because they both returned the throne to their families, in the case of Emperor Go-Komatsu, by defeating his Southern Court rivals, and in the case of Emperor Kōkō, by succeeding his elder brother&#x27;s grandson, Emperor Yōzei.

==Events of Go-Komatsu&#x27;s life==
In his own lifetime, Go-Komatsu and those around him believed that he occupied the Chrysanthemum Throne from 24 May 1382 until 1412.

He was raised in the turbulent &quot;Nanboku-chō&quot; period of rival northern and southern courts in the mansion of Hino Sukenori (日野西資教). He succeeded as Northern Emperor upon the abdication of his father, the Northern Pretender Emperor Go-En&#x27;yū. With the help of Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, his father ruled as Cloistered Emperor.

In 1392, an envoy from the Ashikaga Shogunate managed to persuade Emperor Go-Kameyama to convey the Imperial Regalia to Go-Komatsu, which meant that he ceded the Chrysanthemum throne to his former rival. Go-Komatsu received the succession (&quot;senso&quot;); and he is understood to have formally acceded to the legitimate Imperial power and position (&quot;sokui&quot;). In the peace at that time, it was agreed that the northern and southern courts would alternate. However, in 1412, when Emperor Go-Komatsu abdicated, the agreement was thrown away, and, instead, he was succeeded by his son, Emperor Shōkō, and all subsequent Emperors were descended from the Northern Court. Until 1911, the Northern Court Emperors were considered the legitimate ones, and the Southern Court to be illegitimate. However, now the Southern Court is considered to have been legitimate, primarily because they retained the three sacred treasures, and thus, Emperor Go-Komatsu is not considered to have been legitimate for the first 10 years of his reign.

He is enshrined with other emperors at the imperial tomb called &quot;Fukakusa no kita no misasagi&quot; (深草北陵) in Fushimi-ku, Kyoto.

===Kugyō===
&quot;Kugyō&quot; (公卿) is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court&#x27;s actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Go-Komatsu&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included: 
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;
* &quot;Nadaijin&quot;
* &quot;Dainagon&quot;

==Eras of Go-Komatsu&#x27;s reign==
The years of Go-Komatsu&#x27;s &quot;Nanboku-chō&quot; and post&quot;-Nanboku-chō&quot; reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or &quot;nengō&quot;.

<doc id="195023" wikidata="Q440447" url="?curid=195023" title="Emperor Go-Murakami">
<text>(1328 – March 29, 1368) was the 97th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession, and a member of the Southern Court during the Nanboku-chō period of rival courts. He reigned from September 18, 1339, until March 29, 1368 (&quot;Shōhei 23, 11th day of the 3rd month&quot;). His personal name was . He reigned from Sumiyoshi, Ōsaka, Yoshino, Nara, and other temporary locations.

This 14th-century sovereign was named after the 10th-century Emperor Murakami and &quot;go-&quot; (後), translates as &quot;later&quot;; and thus, he is sometimes called the &quot;Later Emperor Murakami&quot;. The Japanese word &quot;go&quot; has also been translated to mean the &quot;second one&quot;; and in some older sources, this emperor may be identified as &quot;Murakami, the second&quot;, or as &quot;Murakami II&quot;.

==Events of Go-Murakami&#x27;s life==
&quot;Prince Norinaga&quot; was Go-Daigo&#x27;s son from his &quot;favorite consort of his later years&quot;. This was Lady Renshi.

He lived during the turbulent years of conflict between rival claimants to the Chrysanthemum Throne. The contested succession pitted what were known as the Northern and Southern Courts against each other. These years are also known as the Nanboku-chō period. When Emperor Go-Daigo began his Kenmu Restoration, the still very young prince, along with Kitabatake Akiie, in 1333 went to Tagajō in what is now Miyagi Prefecture, at the time Mutsu Province, to return the eastern samurai to their allegiance and destroy the remnants of the Hōjō clan. However, in 1336, because Ashikaga Takauji had raised a rebellion, the Emperor returned to Sakamoto with a strong force to confront him.

He was accompanied by Kitabatake Akiie, in order to confront Takauji. When Takauji defeated them in Kyōto in 1336, they again returned to Mutsu Province. In 1337, because Tagajō was attacked, they returned yet again to the west, returning to Yoshino while constantly fighting battles.

In 1338, he headed to Tagajō, but returned to Yoshino because of a storm. In Oct. 1338, he was named Crown Prince. On 19 Sept. 1339, he became emperor upon the death of Emperor Go-Daigo. Kitabatake Chikafusa became his advisor.

In 1348, Kō no Moronao attacked Yoshino, and the Emperor left for modern-day Nishiyoshino Village in Yoshino District, Nara Prefecture, which was then Yamato Province. In 1352, he entered Otokoyama in Yamashiro Province. As a result of the Battle of Shichijō Ōmiya, Kusunoki Masanori recovered Kyōto from Ashikaga Yoshiakira.

At this time, April 1352, the Retired Northern Emperors Kōgon, Kōmyō, and Sukō were taken to Anau, the location of the Southern Court. However, within twenty days, Ashikaga Yoshiakira had recaptured Kyōto.

The Emperor and his retinue were confined to Otokoyama, but escaped to Kawachi Province during an attack by Yoshiakira, and a few months later returned to Yoshino.

In 1361, Hosokawa Kiyōji and Kusunoki Masanori, who had returned to the Southern Court&#x27;s allegiance, attacked Kyōto, and temporarily recovered it. But, Yoshiakira quickly responded, and they evacuated Kyōto in less than twenty days.

They continued trying to recover Kyōto, but the Southern Court&#x27;s power was already weakening, and by the Emperor&#x27;s death in 1368, Ashikaga Yoshimitsu was in power and the throne had been moved to Sumiyoshi.
Go-Murakami&#x27;s tomb is known as &quot;Hinoo no misasagi&quot; (檜尾陵); it is located in the precincts of Kanshin-ji temple (観心寺) in Kawachinagano, Osaka.

=== Kugyō ===
&quot;Kugyō&quot; (公卿) is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court&#x27;s actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Go-Murakami&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included:
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;
* &quot;Naidaijin&quot;
* &quot;Dainagon&quot;

==Eras of Go-Murakami&#x27;s reign==

==Biography==
Hirohito&quot;-shinnō&quot; was named Crown Prince and heir to his first cousin, the Daikakuji-tō Emperor Go-Uda. Political maneuvering by Fushimi&#x27;s father, the Jimyōin-tō Emperor Go-Fukakusa, was a crucial factor in this choice.

In the year 1287 (&quot;Kōan 10, 10th month&quot;), in the 13th year of Go-Uda&quot;-tennō&quot;″s reign (後宇多天皇十三年), the emperor abdicated; and the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) was received by his cousin. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Fushimi is said to have acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;).

After this, there was a short period of time in which the two lines alternated power. Two years later, the retired Emperor Go-Fukakusa ended his reign as Cloistered Emperor, and Fushimi took direct control.

In 1289, by making his own son (the future Emperor Go-Fushimi) Crown Prince, he increased the antagonism of the Daikakuji line. In 1290, the family of Asawara Tameyori made an assassination attempt on the Emperor.

During his reign, efforts were made by the noble families to defeat the government, but the power of the Bakufu increased. In 1298, Fushimi abdicated and began his reign as cloistered emperor. Three years later, in 1301, the Daikakuji Line rallied and forced Emperor Go-Fushimi to abdicate.

In 1308, his co-operation with the Bakufu succeeding, his fourth son&#x27;s enthronement as Emperor Hanazono took place, and he again became cloistered Emperor.

During Fushimi&#x27;s reign, the alternating plan for the Daikakuji and Jimyōin lines had not yet come into being, and the two lines fought each other for the throne.

* 1313 (&quot;Shōwa 2, 10th month&quot;): Retired Emperor Fushimi shaved his head and became a Buddhist monk; and the power to administer the court of reigning Emperor Hanazono shifted to his adopted son, former-Emperor Go-Fushimi.

In 1317, former-Emperor Fushimi died; but his son, Emperor Hanazono, did not participate in formal mourning rites for him. This was unprecedented; but this was rationalized with the explanation that Hanozono had become the adopted &quot;son&quot; of his older brother, former-Emperor Go-Fushimi. Fushimi is enshrined with other emperors at the imperial tomb called &quot;Fukakusa no kita no misasagi&quot; (深草北陵) in Fushimi-ku, Kyoto.

===Kugyō===
 is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court&#x27;s actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Fushimi&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included: 
* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Nijō Morotada, 1287–1289
* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Konoe Iemoto, 1289–1291
* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Kujō Tadanori, 1291–1293
* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Konoe Iemoto, 1293–1296 
* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Takatsukasa Kanetada, 1296–1298
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;
* &quot;Nadaijin&quot;
* &quot;Dainagon&quot;

==Eras of Fushimi&#x27;s reign==
The years of Fushimi&#x27;s reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or &quot;nengō&quot;.
* &quot;Kōan&quot; (1278–1288)
* &quot;Shōō&quot; (1288–1293)
* &quot;Einin&quot; (1293–1299)

<doc id="195033" wikidata="Q962092" url="?curid=195033" title="The Process of Belief">
<text>The Process of Belief is the twelfth studio album by the American punk rock band Bad Religion. It was produced by its leaders Greg Graffin and Brett Gurewitz, and was released on January 22, 2002, through Epitaph Records. After touring in support of its previous studio album, &quot;The New America&quot; (2000), Gurewitz re-joined Bad Religion in 2001 after a seven-year hiatus. The band re-signed with Epitaph, and then began work on its first album for the label in over eight years. The album also marked the first album to feature Brooks Wackerman, who replaced former drummer Bobby Schayer.

&quot;The Process of Belief&quot; was another huge success (debuting at number 49 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart) and it was well received by both critics and fans. The album has sold more than 220,000 units worldwide. &quot;The Process of Belief&quot; features one of Bad Religion&#x27;s well-known songs &quot;Sorrow&quot;, the band&#x27;s first to chart in the US in six years, since &quot;A Walk&quot; (from 1996&#x27;s &quot;The Gray Race&quot;). &quot;Broken&quot;, &quot;The Defense&quot; and &quot;Supersonic&quot; also received radio airplay, but all failed to make any national chart (although &quot;Broken&quot; reached number 125 on the UK Singles Chart).

The album marked the return to the faster and more energetic songwriting style of Bad Religion&#x27;s earlier albums, and many have compared it favorably to their past releases. Multiple songs of the album have become live staples of the band&#x27;s shows, most notably &quot;Sorrow&quot;.

==Background and recording==
Bad Religion released their eleventh studio album &quot;The New America&quot; in May 2000, through Atlantic Records. Bassist Jay Bentley said there was one day where the label was dropping acts that had sold under 50,000 copies; he said that Bad Religion had sold around 61,000 but had told them: &quot;Please throw us off too. I don&#x27;t want to be a part of this anymore.&quot; Bentley said no one in the band was happy while making &quot;The New America&quot;, and had expected it to be their last album. In January 2001, it was reported that Epitaph Records and Bad Religion founder Brett Gurewitz had re-joined the band. He had left the band in 1994 to focus his efforts on Epitaph; he previously wrote &quot;Believe It&quot; for &quot;The New America&quot;. Alongside this, it was announced that the band had re-signed to Epitaph, who they left for Atlantic in 1993. In May 2001, it was announced that drummer Bobby Schayer had sustained an inoperable rotator cuff problem, and had left the band as a result.

Throughout June 2001, the band toured across Europe; in the same month, Brooks Wackerman, formerly of Suicidal Tendencies and the Vandals, joined the band as their next drummer. In July 2001, the band said their next album would be titled &quot;The Process of Belief&quot;, and was planned for release in a few months&#x27; time. Later in the month, the band recorded at Sound City Studios and Westbeach Recorders, both in Los Angeles, California, with Gurewitz and Graffin as producers. Gurewitz was critical of the previous producers the band worked with, stating that he understood them better than anyone. Billy Joe Bowers handled recording, while Jeff Mosis and Philip Brousard acted as assistant engineers. In September 2001, Gurewitz mixed almost every track at Larrabee East except for &quot;Epiphany&quot;, which was done by Jerry Finn. Bob Ludwig mastered the album at Gateway.

==Composition==
&quot;The Process of Belief&quot; is a punk rock album, which was compared to Bad Religion&#x27;s sixth and seventh studio albums, &quot;Generator&quot; (1992) and &quot;Recipe for Hate&quot; (1993). The album&#x27;s title was taken from a lyric in &quot;Materialist&quot;, which Gurewitz felt summarizes the band&#x27;s name fittingly. The opening track, &quot;Supersonic&quot;, discusses the speed at which life changes. &quot;Broken&quot; is a mid-tempo rock song, and is followed by &quot;Destined for Nothing&quot;, which evokes parts of &quot;Recipe for Hate&quot;. &quot;Materialist&quot; is an anti-religious track; Gurewitz said it referred to &quot;belief in God and the biological process that causes the belief in God.&quot; &quot;Kyoto Now!&quot; is about the Kyoto Protocol to reduce Greenhouse gases and pollution.

&quot;Sorrow&quot; was inspired by the biblical figure Job, with Gurewitz saying it was &quot;very difficult to account for suffering in the world from a theological perspective&quot;. The song opens with a Police-esque ska beat, before switching to the band&#x27;s typical melodic hardcore sound. &quot;Epiphany&quot; is a mid-tempo song that talks about the negatives of self-examination, and is similar in form to &quot;Stickin in My Eye&quot; (1992) by NOFX. The mid-tempo rock song &quot;The Defense&quot; is an attack on the Patriot Act, and features sitar playing from Mikaleno. The opening guitar riff in &quot;The Lie&quot; recalled on the one heard in &quot;I Want to Conquer the World&quot;, a track from the band&#x27;s fourth studio album &quot;No Control&quot; (1989). &quot;You Don&#x27;t Belong&quot; deals with the positives and negatives of nostalgia. The closing track, &quot;Bored and Extremely Dangerous&quot;, is about the issues facing pre-Columbine kids.

==Release==
In August 2001, &quot;The Process of Belief&quot; was delayed from October 2001 to early 2002, which Bentley said was due to the Epitaph&#x27;s aversion to releasing albums during the holiday season. On October 5, 2001, the album&#x27;s artwork was posted on the label&#x27;s website. On October 31, &quot;Sorrow&quot; was made available for free download through the label&#x27;s website, followed by &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop It&quot; on November 15, through eMusic. On January 11, 2002, &quot;Supersonic&quot; was made available for free download through a microsite for the album. &quot;The Process of Belief&quot; was made available for streaming between January 18 and 22, before it was eventually released on January 22, 2002. To promote its release, the band held four releases shows across San Francisco and Los Angeles, California, and appeared on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;.

The music video for &quot;Sorrow&quot; was posted online on January 29, 2002. On February 8, the band performed &quot;Sorrow&quot; on &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn&quot;. Following this, the band embarked on tour of Europe in February 2002, and a tour of the US in March, with support from Hot Water Music and Less Than Jake. In April 2002, the band performed at the Groezrock festival in Europe. &quot;Broken&quot; was released as a single on April 22, 2002; the CD version featured the non-album track &quot;Shattered Faith&quot;, &quot;Supersonic&quot;, and the music video for &quot;Sorrow&quot;. Three days later, the music video for &quot;Broken&quot; was posted on the band&#x27;s website. Between late June and mid-August, the group went on the 2002 edition of Warped Tour. In September, the band performed at the Inland Invasion festival. They were due to tour Australia and New Zealand in October; however, the trek was cancelled for unknown reasons. In April and May 2003, the band embarked on a US west coast tour, with support from Sparta and Snapcase, and headlined the Slam City Jam. In September, the band went on another west coast tour, which included several multi-day shows in different cities. Some of the shows were supported by the Living End, Maxeen, and Throw Rag.

==Reception==

&quot;The Process of Belief&quot; was met with generally favourable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 74, based on 13 reviews.

The staff at &quot;E! Online&quot; said Gurewitz&#x27;s return to Bad Religion &quot;prove[d] rejuvenating for all. With the combustible reunited dynamic&quot; between Graffin and Gurewitz, &quot;the band has energy and urgency anew&quot;. RTÉ reviewer Harry Guerin said that despite the band members being double the age of modern acts, the album &quot;finds them growing old gracefully and highlights how much a new generation needs their open-your-eyes anthems.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; write Jim Farber said the album had &quot;catchier melodies and more breathlessly clever wordplay&quot; than the band&#x27;s previous releases. Joachim Hiller of &quot;Ox-Fanzine&quot; wrote that the band had &quot;created the[ir] best album in years&quot;, having sidestepped the &quot;mediocrity and insignificance&quot; of their previous two &quot;not really bad, but irrelevant albums&quot;. Yahoo! Launch&#x27;s Rob O&#x27;Connor called it &quot;a MY-T-FINE punk rock album, chock full of swirling harmonies&quot;, though there was &quot;no real surprises here&quot;.

Phil Udell of &quot;Hot Press&quot; wrote that the band come across as &quot;sounding as fresh and inspired as in their early days ... [with] sweet harmonies and a passionate belief in the power of music.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writer Tom Moon said the album had &quot;fourteen throttling songs designed to remind Sum 41&#x27;s worshippers about the oft-neglected cerebral side of punk.&quot; &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; contributor Aaron Scott found the album to be &quot;supercharged with Gurewitz’s solid production and enough old school Bad Religion hooks to begin healing years of perceived misdirection,&quot; however, it was &quot;not a big enough band-aid to cover all the cuts of time.&quot; AllMusic reviewer Jack Rabid wrote that repeated listens of the album awards the listener with &quot;brute, lashing power and wild honey melodies&quot; that disarm &quot;such critical impulses as efficiently as a martial arts master.&quot; &quot;Pitchfork&quot; Rob Mitchum found that on occasion, Graffin and Gurewitz display a &quot;strong hook-writing ability&quot;; however, the majority of the album was &quot;indistinguishable from anything post-&quot;No Control&quot;&quot;.

&quot;The Process of Belief&quot; peaked at number 49 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart, and also number one on Top Independent Albums. It became the first Bad Religion album to chart on the Irish Charts. &quot;Alternative Press&quot; ranked &quot;Sorrow&quot; at number 56 on their list of the best 100 singles from the 2000s.

<text>(30 October 1218 – 18 June 1234) was the 85th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. His reign spanned only two months in 1221, and he was not officially listed amongst the emperors until 1870 because of doubts caused by the length of his reign. The Imperial Household Agency recognizes &quot;Kujō no misasagi&quot; (九條陵) near Tōfuku-ji in Fushimi-ku, Kyoto as his tomb.

==Genealogy==
Before his ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (his &quot;imina&quot;) was .

He was the first son of Emperor Juntoku. His mother was Ritsushi (?) (立子), daughter of Kujō Yoshitsune (九条良経).

* Consort: Ukyonodaibu-no-Tsubone (右京大夫局), Priest&#x27;s daughter
** First Daughter: Imperial Princess Yoshiko (義子内親王) later Wademon’in (和徳門院, 1234 - 1289)

==Events of Chūkyō&#x27;s life==
Chūkyō was enthroned at the age of two following the deposition of his father, the Emperor Juntoku in preparation for the Jōkyū Incident, an unsuccessful attempt by Juntoku&#x27;s father, the Retired Emperor Go-Toba, to overthrow the Kamakura Bakufu.

* 13 May 1221 (&quot;Jōkyū 3, 20th day of the 4th month&quot;): In the 11th year of Juntoku&quot;-tennō&quot;″s reign (順徳天皇十一年), the emperor abdicated; and the succession (‘‘senso’’) was received by his eldest son who was only two years old. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Chūkyō is said to have acceded to the throne (‘‘sokui’’).

That same year, after the Jōkyū Incident, he was dethroned and replaced by his first cousin once removed Emperor Go-Horikawa, the nephew of Emperor Go-Toba.

Because of his dethronement just 2 months after the Jōkyū Incident, his enthronement was not recognized. He was known as the Kujō Dethroned Emperor (Kujō Haitei, 九条廃帝), the Half-Emperor (半帝), and the Later Dethroned Emperor (Go-Haitei, 後廃帝, a reference to Emperor Junnin who was often called Haitei, 廃帝).

In 1870, he was recognized as an Emperor and given the posthumous name of Emperor Chūkyō.

==Events of Tsuchimikado&#x27;s life==
In 1198, he became emperor upon the abdication of Emperor Go-Toba, who continued to exercise Imperial powers as cloistered emperor.

* 18 February 1198 (&quot;Kenkyū 9, 11th day of the 1st month&quot;): In the 15th year of Go-Toba&quot;-tennō&quot;″s reign (後鳥羽天皇十五年), the emperor abdicated; and the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) was received by his eldest son.
* 1198 (&quot;Kenkyū 9, 3rd month&quot;): Emperor Tsuchimikado is said to have acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;).
* 1199: Shortly after Tsuchimikado&#x27;s reign began, Minamoto no Yoritomo died.
* 1203: Yoritomo&#x27;s successor as head of the Kamakura shogunate, Minamoto no Yoriie, was assassinated; and former emperor Go-Toba was responsible for good relations with the shogunate when it was headed by Minamoto no Sanetomo from 1203 through 1219.
* 1210: Go-Toba persuaded Tsuchimikado to abdicate in favor of his younger brother, who would become known as Emperor Juntoku.

In Kyōto, Minamoto no Michichika took power as steward, and in Kamakura, in 1199, upon the death of Minamoto no Yoritomo, Hōjō Tokimasa began to rule as Gokenin.

Tsuchimikado removed himself from Kyoto, traveling first to Tosa Province (now known as Kōchi Prefecture); and later, he moved to Awa province (now known as Tokushima Prefecture), where he died in exile.

* 1231: The former emperor died at age 35.

Tsuchimikado&#x27;s official Imperial tomb is in Kyoto. The emperor is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (&quot;misasagi&quot;). This mausoleum shrine is formally named &quot;Kanegahara no misasagi&quot;.

===&quot;Kugyō&quot;===
&quot;Kugyō&quot; (公卿) is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Tsuchimikado&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included:
* &quot;Sesshō&quot;, Konoe Motomichi, 1160–1233.
* &quot;Sesshō&quot;, Kujō Yoshitsune, 1169–1206.
* &quot;Daijō-daijin&quot;, Kujō Yoshitsune.
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;
* &quot;Naidaijin&quot;
* &quot;Dainagon&quot;

==Eras of Tsuchimikado&#x27;s reign==
The years of Tschuimikado&#x27;s reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or &quot;nengō&quot;.
* &quot;Kenkyū&quot; (1190–1199)
* &quot;Shōji&quot; (1199–1201)
* &quot;Kennin&quot; (1201–1204)

==Events of Go-Toba&#x27;s life==
Go-Toba took the throne at the age of three.
* 8 September 1183 (&quot;Juei 2, 20th day of the 8th month&quot;): In the 3rd year of Antoku&quot;-tennō&quot;″s reign (安徳天皇三年), the emperor fled the capital rather than give in to pressures for his abdication. In Antoku&#x27;s absence, the cloistered former-Emperor Go-Shirakawa then elevated Antoku&#x27;s younger brother by decree; and the young child was given the acceptance of abdication (&quot;juzen&quot;) rites. The anti-Taira faction intended that the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) was received; and shortly thereafter, Emperor Go-Toba is said to have acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;).

Although these formal rites and ceremonies were taking place in Heian-kyō, the imperial regalia were still held by Antoku. Thus, the &quot;senso&quot; and &quot;sokui&quot; of Go-Toba became the first in history to omit the ritual transmission of the sacred treasures from a sovereign to his successor.

In 1192 Go-Shirakawa died and the first shogunate was established by Minamoto no Yoritomo, and the emperor became a figurehead.

In 1198, Go-Toba abdicated in favor of his son, Emperor Tsuchimikado.

Go-Toba reigned as cloistered Emperor from 1198 till 1221 during reigns of three emperors, but his power was more limited than former cloistered Emperors in the Heian period.

It was during this time that Go-Toba decreed that the followers of the Pure Land sect in Kyōto, led by Hōnen, be banished or in some cases executed. Originally this was prompted by complaints of clergy in Kyoto who were concerned about the rise in popularity of the new sect, but Go-Toba personally ordered the decree after two of his ladies in waiting converted to the sect without his knowledge.

In 1221, the shōgun installed Go-Toba&#x27;s three-year-old grandson, Emperor Chūkyō, as emperor, but Go-Toba chose to stage a rebellion in an attempt to reclaim the throne and overthrow the Kamakura shogunate. This conflict is known as the Jōkyū War, named after the era in which it occurred. Samurai around Kyōto who were against the Shogunate supported him but most samurai, particularly in Kantō, supported the Shogunate with encouragement of Hōjō Masako, the widow of Yoritomo. She persuaded samurai gathering in Kamakura that if they would not support the Shōgunate, then the contemporary status and privileges that samurai had attained would be lost, and the court and kuge would regain their power and influence. Go-Toba&#x27;s rebellion was defeated and Chūkyō was replaced as emperor by Go-Horikawa, a nephew of Go-Toba.

After the rebellion Go-Toba was exiled to the Oki Islands. He died and was buried there.

===Non-political activities===
Despite the limits on his political powers, he developed skills as a calligrapher, painter, musician, poet, critic, and editor, although the majority of his activities took place after his abdication aged 18 (as the abdication freed him from &#x27;the ceremonial prison of the imperial palace&#x27;).

Besides his enthusiasm for archery, equestrianism, and swordsmanship, Go-Toba was a great lover of swords themselves, and over the course of several years summoned the most talented swordsmiths in the land to his court where they were given honorary titles and invited to teach the emperor their craft. He became a respectable swordsmith himself, and it was his patronage and encouragement of this art that gave birth to Japan&#x27;s &#x27;Golden Age&#x27; of bladesmithing. His contribution to the art is still held in such high esteem, that even today a tradition is maintained in sword literature that he is the first swordsmith to be discussed.

His greatest contribution to literature is the Shin Kokinshū (The New Anthology of Ancient and Modern Waka), which Japanese has considered one of three major influential waka anthologies along Man&#x27;yōshū and Kokin Wakashū. He ordered its creation and took part in the working group as an editor. He revived the Office of Waka (和歌所) and made it the headquarters of this edition. He held many &quot;utakai&quot; (waka parties) and utaawase (waka competitions). Not only the creator and organizer, he acted as a critic, and wrote the style of waka in general and criticism of his contemporary poets.
During his exile, he continued to compose hundreds of waka and to edit both anthologies from his creation in Oki Islands and a private edition of &quot;Shin Kokinshū&quot; for 18 years, getting rid of around 400 wakas from the former edition, while its edition had been officially declared to be completed in 1204, and further elaborations finished even in 1216. While he declared his private edition should be authentic, today the 1216 version is considered as the authentic and others as variants. His edition is today called &quot;Oki-bon Shin Kokinshū&quot; (Oki edition). It is probable that during his exile, he also wrote his &quot;Go-Toba no in gokuden&quot; (&quot;Secret Teachings&quot;), a short work on aesthetic criticism; the &quot;Secret Teachings&quot; are particularly valuable as a major source on Go-Toba&#x27;s complicated relationships with his former client, the greatest poet of the age – Fujiwara no Teika.

One of his 31-syllable poems was chosen by Fujiwara no Teika as Number 99 in the popular anthology &quot;Hyakunin Isshu&quot;.

====&quot;Kugyō&quot;====
&quot;Kugyō&quot; (公卿) is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Go-Toba&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included:

<doc id="195041" wikidata="Q316651" url="?curid=195041" title="Emperor Antoku">
<text>was the 81st emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. His reign spanned the years from 1180 through 1185. His death marked the end of the Heian period and the beginning of the Kamakura period.

During this time, the Imperial family was involved in a bitter struggle between warring clans. Minamoto no Yoritomo with his cousin Minamoto no Yoshinaka, led a force from the Minamoto clan against the Taira, who controlled the emperor. During the climactic sea Battle of Dan-no-ura in April 1185, Antoku&#x27;s grandmother Taira no Tokiko took him and plunged with him into the water in the Shimonoseki Straits, drowning the child emperor rather than allowing him to be captured by the opposing forces.

This clash of clans led to numerous legends and tales. The story of Emperor Antoku and his mother&#x27;s family became the subject of the Kamakura period epic poem &quot;The Tale of the Heike&quot; (Heike is an alternative reading of the Japanese characters for &quot;House of the Taira&quot;). Antoku&#x27;s tomb is said to be located in a number of places around western Japan, including the island of Iwo Jima, a result of the spreading of legends about the emperor and the battle.

==Genealogy==
Before his ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (his &quot;imina&quot;) was Tokihito&quot;-shinnō&quot; (言仁親王). He was also known as Kotohito&quot;-shinnō&quot;.

His father was Emperor Takakura, and thus a grandson of retired Emperor Go-Shirakawa. His mother, Taira no Tokuko (平徳子), second daughter of Taira no Kiyomori (平清盛), was later referred to as Empress Dowager Kenrei (建礼門院, &quot;Kenrei-mon In&quot;).

== Events of Antoku&#x27;s life ==
Antoku was named crown prince at around one month of age. He ascended the throne at the age of two. Naturally, he held no actual power, but rather his grandfather Taira no Kiyomori ruled in his name, though not officially, as &quot;sesshō&quot; (regent).

* 18 May 1180 (&quot;Jishō 4, 22nd day of the 4th month&quot;): In the 12th year of Takakura&quot;-tennō&quot;″s reign (高倉天皇十二年), the emperor was forced to abdicate; and the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) was received by his infant son, the grandson of Taira Kiyomori. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Antoku is said to have acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;).

In the year of his enthronement, the capital was moved to modern-day Kōbe, Hyōgo, but it was soon moved back to Heian-kyō.

* 8 September 1183 (&quot;Juei 2, 20th day of the 8th month&quot;): Go-Toba is proclaimed emperor by the Minamoto; and consequently, there were two proclaimed emperors, one living in Heian-kyō and another in flight towards the south.

In 1183, when Minamoto no Yoshinaka entered the capital, the Taira clan fled with the young emperor and the sacred treasures to Yashima (the name of a place inside modern-day Takamatsu, Kagawa). Being defeated in ensuing battle, they fled westward.

* 25 April 1185 (&quot;Genryaku 2, 24th day of the 3rd month&quot;): The Taira and the Minamoto clashed in the Battle of Dan-no-ura.

The Taira were defeated. Antoku&#x27;s grandmother, Taira no Tokiko, Kiyomori&#x27;s widow, drowned herself along with the young emperor. His mother also drowned herself, but apparently, according to The Tale of the Heike (&quot;Heike Monogatari&quot;), she was pulled out with a rake by her long hair.

According to Yoshitsune&#x27;s dispatch, the sacred seal was found, but the sacred sword was lost. The sword was one of the three sacred treasures.

===&quot;Kugyō&quot;===
&quot;Kugyō&quot; (公卿) is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Antoku&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included:
* &quot;Sesshō&quot;, Konoe Motomichi, 1160–1233.
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;
* &quot;Nadaijin&quot;, Taira Munemori, 1147–1185.
* &quot;Dainagon&quot;

===Memorial site===
After his drowning, in order to mourn the body and placate any restless spirits, the Amidaji Goeidō was built. Later, Antoku was enshrined at the Kurume-Suitengū in Kurume, Fukuoka, and he came to be worshipped as Mizu-no-kami (水の神, lit. &quot;water-god&quot; or &quot;god of water&quot;), the god of easy delivery at &quot;Suitengū&quot; (水天宮, lit. &quot;water-heaven/emperor-shrine&quot;) everywhere.

With the establishment of Shintō as the state religion of Japan, the Amidaji Temple was abandoned and the Akama Shrine was established in Shimonoseki in Yamaguchi prefecture to celebrate Antoku.

The Imperial Household Agency designates &quot;Amida-ji no misasagi&quot; (阿彌陀寺陵) near Akama Shrine in Shimonoseki as Antoku&#x27;s tomb.

<doc id="195043" wikidata="Q357046" url="?curid=195043" title="Emperor Rokujō">
<text>was the 79th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. His reign spanned the years from 1165 through 1168.

==Genealogy==
Before his ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (his &quot;imina&quot;) was Nobuhito&quot;-shinnō&quot; (順仁). He was as Yoshihito- or Toshihito&quot;-shinnō&quot;.

He was the son of Emperor Nijō. He left no children.

==Events of Rokujō&#x27;s life==
He was made Crown Prince before his first birthday, and was enthroned at the age of 8 months.

* 1165 (&quot;Eiman 1&quot;): The infant son of Emperor Nijō was named heir apparent (and this Crown Prince will soon become Emperor Rokujō.
* 1165 (&quot;Eiman 1, 25th day of the 6th month&quot;): In the 7th year of Nijō&quot;-tennō&quot;″s reign (二条天皇七年), the emperor fell so very ill that he abdicated; and the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) was received by his son. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Rokujō is said to have acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;).
* 1165 (&quot;Eiman 1, 27th–28th day of the 7th month&quot;): The former- Emperor Nijō died at age 22.

He was pressured by the Taira clan to abdicate in favor of his uncle, who became Emperor Takakura.

* 1168 (&quot;Nin&#x27;an 3, 19th day of the 2nd month&quot;): In the 3rd year of Rokujō&quot;-tennō&quot;″s reign (六条天皇三年), the emperor was deposed by his grandfather, and the succession (‘‘senso’’) was received by his uncle, the seventh son of the retired-Emperor Go-Shirakawa.
* 1168 (&quot;Nin&#x27;an 3, 19th day of the 2nd month&quot;): Emperor Takakura is said to have acceded to the throne (‘‘sokui’’), and he is proclaimed emperor.
* 1168 (&quot;Nin&#x27;an 3, 20th day of the 3rd month&quot;): Takakura succeeds Rokujo on the Chrysanthemum Throne.

Rokujō died at the age of eleven. Because of his youth, he had neither consorts nor children. Government affairs were run by his grandfather, Retired Emperor Go-Shirakawa as cloistered emperor. His imperial mausoleum is designated as &quot;Seikanji no misasagi&quot; (清閑寺陵), located in Higashiyama-ku, Kyoto.

===&quot;Kugyō&quot;===
&quot;Kugyō&quot; (公卿) is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Rokujō&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included:
* &quot;Sesshō&quot;, Konoe Motozane, 1143–1166.
* &quot;Sesshō&quot;, Matsu Motofusa, 1144–1230.
* &quot;Daijō-daijin&quot;, Fujiwara Koremichi 1093–1165.

* &quot;Udaijin&quot;, Kujō Kanezane, 1149–1207.
* &quot;Nadaijin&quot;, Fujiwara Tadamasa.
* &quot;Dainagon&quot;

==Eras of Emperor Rokujō&#x27;s reign==

<doc id="195045" wikidata="Q317984" url="?curid=195045" title="Emperor Go-Shirakawa">
<text>was the 77th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. His de jure reign spanned the years from 1155 through 1158, though arguably he effectively maintained imperial power for almost thirty-seven years through the &quot;insei&quot; system – scholars differ as to whether his rule can be truly considered part of the &quot;insei&quot; system, given that the Hōgen Rebellion undermined the imperial position. However, it is broadly acknowledged that by politically outmaneuvering his opponents, he attained greater influence and power than the diminished authority of the emperor&#x27;s position during this period would otherwise allow.

Posthumously, this 12th-century sovereign was named after the 11th-century Emperor Shirakawa. &quot;Go-&quot; (後), translates literally as &quot;later&quot;; and thus, he is sometimes called the &quot;Later Emperor Shirakawa&quot;, or in some older sources, may be identified as &quot;Shirakawa, the second&quot; or as &quot;Shirakawa II&quot;.

Unusually, the years of Go-Shirakawa&#x27;s reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or &quot;nengō&quot;; &quot;Kyūju&quot; (1154–1156) and &quot;Hōgen&quot; (1156–1159).

He was &quot;de facto&quot; the last true emperor, before the shogun became the actual head of the country after Go-Shirakawa&#x27;s death in 1192 until the Meiji Restoration in 1868.

== Political career ==
=== Accession ===
On August 22, 1155 (&quot;Kyūju 2, 23rd day of the 7th month&quot;), Emperor Konoe died at the age of 17 years without leaving any heirs. There was an ensuing succession dispute: The main candidates were Prince Shigehito, son of retired Emperor Sutoku, and Prince Morihito, son of Go-Shirakawa (then named Prince Masahito). Though, according to Gukansho, Bifukumon-in also suggested her daughter Imperial Princess Akiko, Heian society was fundamentally opposed to the idea of a female ruler. Shigehito was expected to succeed and was supported by Fujiwara no Yorinaga, but court nobles centering around Bifukumon-in and Fujiwara no Tadamichi opposed this, fearing Sutoku gaining power as Cloistered Emperor. Securing the support of Cloistered Emperor Toba, a plan was put into place where 29 year old Prince Masahito, Morihito&#x27;s father, would take the throne as Emperor to secure his son&#x27;s position until he came of age, skipping the usual status of Crown Prince. The new Emperor, who would be posthumously named Go-Shirakawa, was enthroned late that year.

The resulting effect of disinheriting Sutoku&#x27;s line, after Sutoku had already previously been made to abdicate in favour of Konoe, infuriated the retired Emperor.

=== Cementing Power ===
On July 20, 1156 (&quot;Hōgen 1, 2nd day of the 7th month&quot;), the ex-Emperor Toba died at the age of 54. Soon afterwards, the Hōgen Rebellion broke out – Yorinaga had mustered several hundred warriors to try to press Sutoku&#x27;s claim and usurp Go-Shirakawa&#x27;s title. However, Go-Shirakawa gained the support of the two most powerful warrior clans, the Taira and the Minamoto, through their leaders, Minamoto no Yoshitomo and Taira no Kiyomori. Together, they easily defeated the armies of Sutoku leaving Go-Shirakawa as the sole imperial ruler. Historian George Sansom argues that because the course of the insurrection was dictated by the military clans, this moment represents a turning point in the nature of Japanese politics; the imperial clan had lost all authority and the military clans now controlled the political landscape. Sansom develops this point to assert that an intrinsic part of the &quot;insei&quot; system was the security it granted the emperors, as they often entered religion; the sacrosanctity of monks and priests was an intrinsic part of Japanese culture. Given that Sutoku was overthrown by the military clans and Go-Shirakawa, his position cannot truly be considered to have been secure, Sansom argues, and so the Hōgen Rebellion represents the end of the &quot;insei&quot; system.
In 1158 Go-Shirakawa abdicated to his son Nijō and became the cloistered emperor (the term used here out of practicality rather than as a validation of one point of view on the aforementioned issue), maintaining this position through the reigns of five emperors (Nijō, Rokujō, Takakura, Antoku, and Go-Toba) until his death in 1192.

=== Rule of Kiyomori ===
Go-Shirakawa was initially an ally of Kiyomori – the latter began trade with China and supported Go-Shirakawa, not just militarily but also financially. The tension between the aforementioned foremost military clans, the Taira and Minamoto, led to the Heiji Rebellion of 1160. The Minamoto lost and the Taira attained ascendancy. As Kiyomori&#x27;s power reached its zenith, the good relations between him and Go-Shirakawa ended – Kiyomori&#x27;s reign became hubristic and indeed despotic, with the Taira showing unequivocal disrespect not only towards the imperial clan, but towards the other high-ranking families as well. For example, in 1170 Taira men humiliated the reigning Fujiwara Regent, Fujiwara no Motofusa, after his retinue and that of Kiyomori&#x27;s son, Shigemori, collided.

This meant that in 1169 (&quot;Kaō 1, 6th month&quot;) Emperor Go-Shirakawa entered the Buddhist priesthood at the age of 42 – he felt he could no longer control Kiyomori. He took the Buddhist name of Gyōshin. Furthermore, Kiyomori&#x27;s behaviour caused Go-Shirakawa to support a planned &quot;coup d&#x27;etat&quot;, known as the Shishigatani incident. The conspiracy was betrayed and all involved were punished; Go-Shirakawa was confined to Toba-in, the eponymous palace of Toba.

It could be argued that Go-Shirakawa himself further increased Kiyomori&#x27;s power even after their relationship fell apart. He deposed his son Rokujō in 1168 and elevated Takakura to the imperial throne. Takakura was the son of Kiyomori&#x27;s sister-in-law, and so he attained a familial link to the imperial clan in a manner not dissimilar to that of the Fujiwara. Indeed, Kiyomori could have seized the power of Regent and Go-Shirakawa would have been powerless to stop him, due to this marital link.

=== Genpei War ===

Go-Shirakawa planned to regain power through the Taira&#x27;s old rivals, the Minamoto. They had been steadily recovering their strength in the provinces following their defeat in 1160. In May 1180, Minamoto no Yorimasa sent a call to arms to his clan in the eastern and northern provinces. The call to arms was issued in the name of Prince Mochihito, Yorimasa&#x27;s candidate for the imperial throne. Kiyomori became aware of this and subsequently confined Go-Shirakawa even more closely and called for the arrest of his son, Mochihito. Although the rebellion was defeated, it was the first of many and would eventually lead to the Taira&#x27;s downfall.

In short, the Minamoto won after a hard-fought war and with the continual support of Go-Shirakawa, who had been in contact with Minamoto no Yoritomo since Kiyomori&#x27;s death in 1181. In 1183 the army of Minamoto no Yoshinaka entered the capital, allowing for Go-Shirakawa&#x27;s re-entry into the city – he had made a pilgrimage to various shrines, accompanied by armed monks, in order to avoid capture by the Taira. Go-Shirakawa then issued a mandate for Yoshinaka to join with Minamoto no Yukiie in &quot;destroying Munemori and his army&quot;, as well as the entire Taira clan. The emperor bestowed upon Yoshinaka the title of &quot;Asahi Shōgun&quot; (旭 将軍).

Go-Shirakawa also contributed to the Taira&#x27;s defeat by attempting to persuade them to lower their guard; in 1184 he promised that if the Taira returned the Imperial Regalia and the emperor he would facilitate a truce with the Minamoto. This meant that they were unprepared for the rapid attack of Minamoto no Noriyori and Minamoto no Yoshitsune at the Battle of Ichi-no-Tani, a decisive battle in the war.

Throughout the entire war there were disagreements and struggles for power within the Minamoto clan, which was barely held together by Minamoto no Yoritomo. When Yoritomo secured the support of Go-Shirakawa in this power struggle, Yoshinaka seized the cloistered emperor and burned his palace.

After continued internal struggles within the Minamoto clan and fighting with the Taira, Yoshitsune finally destroyed the Taira clan entirely in 1185 at the naval Battle of Dan-no-ura.

=== Later life and death ===
Although Yoritomo and Go-Shirakawa disagreed in the late 1180s, again related to internal Minamoto issues, after the death of Yoshitsune, Go-Shirakawa and Yoritomo reconciled. Go-Shirakawa allowed Yoritomo to form a shogunate – the imperial authority and validation was required to attain the position of Shogun.
In 1192 (&quot;Kenkyū 3, 13th day of the 3rd month&quot;) Go-Shirakawa died at the age of 66. He had been father to two emperors – Nijō, the 78th emperor; Takakura, the 80th emperor and grandfather to three emperors – Rokujō, the 79th emperor; Antoku, the 81st emperor; and Go-Toba, the 82nd emperor.

The Imperial Household has designated Hōjū-ji no &quot;Misasagi&quot; at Kyoto as the emperor&#x27;s official mausoleum.

== Personality ==
Go-Shirakawa is usually characterised as manipulative and deceptive, as well as being inconstant and following whatever was the fashion of the day, whether politically or otherwise. Yoritomo called him &quot;the biggest &quot;tengu&quot; of Japan&quot;. Furthermore, he was also criticized for excessively patronizing literature and religion, being an avid collector of &quot;imayo&quot; poetry since his youth, with these poems often being focused on Buddhist themes. He spent lavishly on restoring and expanding temples and shrines, such as his restoration of the Todai-ji after the Taira burned it down in 1180. He was also accused of encouraging the warrior monks of the great temples to attempt to wield even greater influence than they already possessed.

Konoe&#x27;s reign spanned the years from 1142 through 1155.

==Genealogy==

*&quot;Kōgō&quot;: Fujiwara no Tashi (藤原多子), Tokudaiji Kin&#x27;yoshi‘s daughter and Fujiwara no Yorinaga’s adopted daughter. Later married Emperor Nijo and become Emperor Rokujo’s foster mother.

*&quot;Chūgū&quot;: Fujiwara no Shimeko (藤原呈子) later Kujō-in (九条院), Fujiwara no Koremichi’s daughter and Fujiwara no Tadamichi’s adopted daughter.

Konoe was named heir shortly after he was born in 1139; and he was proclaimed emperor at the age of 3.

* Eiji 1, in the 3rd month (1141): The former emperor Toba accepted the tonsure and became a Buddhist monk at the age of 39 years.
* Eiji 1, on the 7th day of the 12th month (永治元年; 1141): In the 18th year of Sutoku&quot;-tennō&quot;&#x27;s reign (崇徳天皇十八年), the emperor abdicated; and the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) was received by a younger brother, the 8th son of former Emperor Toba. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Konoe is said to have acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;).

At that time, the &quot;Kampaku&quot; Fujiwara-no Tadamichi became &quot;Sesshō&quot; or regent. The Cloistered Emperor Toba continued to direct all the affairs of government, while the retired Emperor Sutoku had no powers. This conflict resulted in many controversies during Konoe&#x27;s reign.

* Kōji 2, in the 1st month (1143): Cloistered Emperor Toba-in, now known by the title &quot;Daijō Hōō&quot; or &quot;Hōō&quot; (太上法皇), visited his mother.
* Kōji 2, in the 5th month (1143): Konoe passed his days praying at Tōdai-ji and also at the temples on Mount Hiei.
* Ten&#x27;yō gannen or Ten&#x27;yō 1, in the 7th month (1145): A comet was sighted in the sky; and for this reason, the name of the &quot;nengō&quot; was changed to &quot;Kyūan&quot;.
* Kyūan 1, in the 8th month (1145): The mother of former Emperor Sutoku (also known as &quot;Taikenmon-In&quot;) died.
* Kyūan 2, in the 2nd month (1146), Konoe visited Toba-no&quot;-Hōō&quot;.
* Kyūan 2, in the 12th month (1146), Konoe joined in a celebration honoring &quot;Sesshō&quot; Fujiwara no Tadamichi (the regent) on his 58th birthday. This event was important because, in each sexagenary cycle, the first and the fifty-eighth years were considered to be auspicious according to Chinese astrological principles.
* Kyūan 4, in the 6th month (1148): The imperial palace was consumed by flames.
* Kyūan 6, in the 1st month (1150): Konoe assumed the role of a mature adult; and he married Fujiwara-no Tokoku, who had been raised by &quot;Sadaijin&quot; Yorinaga. This bride became &quot;Kōkōgō&quot; (皇皇后) or first empress.
* Kyūan 6, in the 3rd month (1150): Konoe married again, this time to &quot;Feï-si,&quot; who had been raised by &quot;Sesshō&quot; Fujiwara-no Tadamichi. She was the daughter of &quot;Dainagon&quot; Fujiwara-no Koremichi. This bride became &quot;Chūgū&quot; (中宮) or second empress. Konoe was so very much enamoured of this second wife that he neglected his first wife, which caused discord in the &quot;kugyō,&quot; especially between Tadamichi and Yorinaga.
* Kyūan 6, in the 12th month (1150): &quot;Sesshō&quot; Minamoto-no Tadamichi, resigns his position and is named &quot;Daijō Daijin&quot;. In this same month, Minamoto-no Yoshikane became head of the Ashikaga clan in Shimotsuke Province.
* Ninpei 1, in the 1st month (1151): &quot;Sadaijin&quot; Yorinaga was given additional power as &quot;Naï-ken,&quot; which gave him the duty and opportunity of reading formal written requests before they should be presented to the emperor. This had been amongst the powers of the &quot;Sesshō&quot; or the &quot;Kampaku.&quot; Factions in the court who favored Yorinaga tended to dislike Tadamichi, and they employed any means possible to help elevate Yorinaga&#x27;s position. However, Yorinaga himself was generally disliked because of his capricious character. His tactics and strategy for enhancing his own prestige were focused primarily on diminishing Tadamichi&#x27;s role in the court.
* Ninpei 2, on the 7th day of the 3rd month (1152): Konoe visited the home of Toba-no&quot;-Hōō&quot; to celebrate his father&#x27;s 50th birthday; and the emperor stayed until the next day, amusing himself with dances and with listening to musical performances.
* Ninpei 3, on the 2nd day of the 1st month (1153): Konoe visited his father&#x27;s home; and in the same month Taira-no Tadamori, the head of the criminal tribunal, died; and this position was soon filed by his son, Taira-no Kiyomori.
* Kyūju gannen or Kyūju 1, in the 5th month (1154): &quot;Udaijin&quot; Minamoto-no Masasada retired from public life to become a priest at age 61. He died several years later.
* Kyūju gannen or Kyūju 1, in the 8th month (1154): Fujiwara-no Saneyoshi, Grand General of the Right, was elevated to the role of Grand General of the Left; and the former &quot;Dainagon&quot; Fujiwara-no Kanenaga (aged 17) was elevated to take on the newly vacated role of Grand General of the Right.
* Kyūju 2, on the 23rd day of the 7th month (1155): Emperor Konoe died at the age of 17 years without leaving any heirs.
* Kyūju 2, on the 24th day of the 7th month (大同元年; 1155): In the 14th year of Konoe&quot;-tennō&quot;&#x27;s reign (近衛天皇14年), the emperor died; and despite an ensuring dispute over who should follow him as sovereign, contemporary scholars then construed that the succession (&quot;enso&quot;) was received by a younger brother, the 14th son of former-Emperor Toba. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Go-Shirakawa is said to have acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;).

During Konoe&#x27;s reign, the Enshō (Superiority of Duration) Temple. After this, successive emperors no longer build Imperial-prayer temples.

Emperor Konoe&#x27;s reign lasted for 13 years: 2 years in the &quot;nengō&quot; &quot;Kōji,&quot; 1 year in &quot;Ten&#x27;yō,&quot; 6 years in &quot;Kyūan, &quot; 3 years in &quot;Ninpei,&quot; and 2 years in &quot;Kyūju&quot;.

===&quot;Kugyō&quot;===
&quot;Kugyō&quot; (公卿) is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Konoe&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included:
* &quot;Sesshō&quot;, Fujiwara Tadamichi, 1099–1164.
* &quot;Daijō-daijin&quot;, Sanjō Saneyuki, 1079–1162.
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;, Fujiwara Yorinaga, 1120–1156.
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;, Minamoto Arihito, 1103–1147.
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;, Sanjō Saneyuki, 1079–1162.
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;, Minamoto Arihito, 1103–1147.
* &quot;Nadaijin&quot;, Minamoto Arihito, 1103–1147.

==Eras of Konoe&#x27;s reign ==
The years of Konoe&#x27;s reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or &quot;nengō&quot;.
* &quot;Kōji&quot; (1142–1144)
* &quot;Ten&#x27;yō&quot; (1144–1145)
* &quot;Kyūan&quot; (1145–1151)

<doc id="195057" wikidata="Q1768706" url="?curid=195057" title="Nightline">
<text>Nightline (or ABC News Nightline) is ABC News&#x27; late-night television news program broadcast on ABC in the United States with a franchised formula to other networks and stations elsewhere in the world. Created by Roone Arledge, the program featured Ted Koppel as its main anchor from March 1980 until his retirement in November 2005. Its ongoing rotating anchors are Byron Pitts and Juju Chang. &quot;Nightline&quot; airs weeknights from 12:37 to 1:07 a.m., Eastern Time, after &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, which had served as the program&#x27;s lead-out from 2003 to 2012.

In 2002, &quot;Nightline&quot; was ranked 23rd on TV Guide&#x27;s 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time. The program has won four Peabody Awards, one in 2001, two in 2002 for the reports &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; and &quot;The Survivors,&quot; and one in 2022 for &quot;The Appointment&quot;.

Through a video-sharing agreement with the BBC, &quot;Nightline&quot; repackages some of the BBC&#x27;s output for an American audience. Segments from &quot;Nightline&quot; are shown in a condensed form on ABC&#x27;s overnight news program &quot;World News Now&quot;. There was also a version of &quot;Nightline&quot; for sister cable channel Fusion.

==&quot;The Iran Crisis–America Held Hostage&quot; (1979)==
The program began on November 8, 1979, four days after the start of the Iran hostage crisis. ABC News president Roone Arledge figured that the best way to compete against NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; was to update Americans on the latest news from Iran. At that time, the show was called &quot;The Iran Crisis–America Held Hostage: Day &quot;xxx&quot;&quot;, where &quot;xxx&quot; represented the number of days that Iranians held the occupants of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, Iran as hostages. At first, &quot;World News Tonight&quot; lead anchor Frank Reynolds hosted the 20-minute special reports.

Shortly after its creation, Reynolds stopped hosting the program. Ted Koppel, then ABC News&#x27;s State Department Correspondent, took on the hosting duties. A few days later a producer had the idea of displaying the number of days on &quot;America Held Hostage&quot; (e.g., Day 15, Day 50, Day 150, etc.).

==Ted Koppel&#x27;s &quot;Nightline&quot; (1980–2005)==
By the end of the hostage crisis in 1981 (after 444 days), the program – which had been retitled the previous year as &quot;Nightline&quot; – had entrenched itself on ABC&#x27;s programming schedule, and made Koppel a national figure. ABC had previously used the title &quot;Night Line&quot; for a short-lived 1 a.m. talk show starring Les Crane that was broadcast over the network&#x27;s New York City flagship station, WABC-TV, starting in 1963.

The program originally aired four nights a week (on Monday through Thursdays) until 1982, when the sketch comedy program &quot;Fridays&quot; was shifted to air after &quot;Nightline&quot;. By this time, the news program had expanded to 30 minutes. For much of its history, the program prided itself on providing a mix of investigative journalism and extended interviews (something that continues to be featured to this day, albeit at a reduced extent), which would look out of place on &quot;World News Tonight&quot;.
The format of the show featured an introduction by the host, then a taped piece on the specific topic of the night; then after a commercial break, there was a live interview related to the topic of the piece. In 1983, ABC attempted to change the program&#x27;s format to feature multiple topics and expand it to one hour, as opposed to focusing on a single topic in a half-hour. This switch proved to be unsuccessful, and after a few months, the original format of the program was restored. Once the original format returned, reverting to a 31-minute structure, it remained unchanged through the end of Koppel&#x27;s tenure; it was changed following his retirement.

The program remains unique in American media, considering its nightly broadcasts. Most other similar shows only air once a week, though usually in a prime time slot for a full hour. &quot;Nightline&quot; is usually less sensationalistic than the weekly news magazines (which often emphasize soft news programming, stories of such type – such as pop culture-related stories – &quot;Nightline&quot; has incorporated to a moderate degree following Koppel&#x27;s departure), though the program has caused controversy on occasion.

In 1982, Koppel interviewed Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) chief Yasser Arafat on the program, in which he had indicated that he would not accept conditions from the U.S. to recognize the PLO. In 1984, the program featured an interview with Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren Burger, marking his first live television appearance. In honor of the 40th Anniversary of D-Day in 1984, &quot;Nightline&quot; aired a special edition which &quot;covered&quot; the landings on Normandy as though modern television news, along with satellite reports, had existed at the time. The following year in 1985, the program conducted its first on-remote broadcast from South Africa.

In 1986, the program featured interviews with the Philippines&#x27; first female president, Corazon Aquino, and outgoing president Ferdinand Marcos, the latter of which tried to defend the extravagant lifestyle (including the extensive shoe collection) of his wife Imelda during the country&#x27;s economic hardship. In an interview with &quot;Nightline&quot; in 1987, Colorado Democratic senator and 1988 presidential candidate Gary Hart admitted to having cheated on his wife, Lee Ludwig, with Donna Rice, in the aftermath of an exposé in the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; that revealed the affair, leading to his withdrawal from the presidential election. That year, &quot;Nightline&quot; broadcast for the first time in the Soviet Union. In 1988, &quot;Nightline&quot; conducted a special report on-location from Jerusalem.
In 1996, Times Books published &quot;Nightline: History in the Making and the Making of Television&quot;, about the program&#x27;s history up to that point, with author credits attributed to Koppel and &quot;Nightline&quot; producer Kyle Gibson. The book received numerous lackluster reviews. In Walter Goodman&#x27;s review of the book for the &quot;New York Times&quot;, he observed &quot;Ted Koppel announces in his introduction to &quot;Nightline&quot; that he did none of the interviews that went into the book and that although he &#x27;influenced&#x27; and &#x27;contributed&#x27; to it, &#x27;in the final analysis Kyle wrote it.&#x27;&quot; Ken Tucker in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; pointed in an unfavorable manner to the book&#x27;s use of the third person: &quot;Throughout &quot;Nightline&quot; the book, the star is referred to in the third person: &#x27;Koppel said&#x27; this or that; &#x27;Koppel hadn’t been asleep an hour when the phone rang.&#x27;.&quot; Frederic M. Biddle of the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; wrote &quot;This book reminds us not only that good television doesn&#x27;t necessarily translate into scintillating prose, but that behind every successful journalist lurks a good editor – who in this case didn&#x27;t show up.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Trib/Globe Biddle&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memorable subjects===
During Ted Koppel&#x27;s tenure as anchor (and on rare occasions since his departure), &quot;Nightline&quot; devoted each episode to a unique subject. Since its inception, the program has covered many subjects (science, education, politics, economics, society, and breaking news). Many candidates for government offices, such as David Duke (in November 1991) have appeared on &quot;Nightline&quot; to try to promote themselves. Seeing that there are a large number of prisons in the United States, it created an ongoing series in 1994 called &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;. The program also aired a series of episodes called &quot;America: In Black and White&quot; dealing with individual aspects of American race relations, and another on homosexuality titled &quot;A Matter of Choice?&quot;.

Over the years, &quot;Nightline&quot; had a number of technological firsts. The program did the first live report from the base of Mount Everest. In November 1992, science reporter Michael Guillen did the first live broadcast from Antarctica. There were times when a major breaking news story occurred as late as 11:00 p.m. Eastern Time, resulting in the subject of that night&#x27;s edition being changed in order to cover the story in some form of detail, depending on the depth of information available at the time of broadcast. Examples of this were the deaths of John Lennon (1980) and Yasser Arafat (2004).

&quot;Nightline&quot; also held a series of town hall meetings; these included the Israeli-Palestinian Town Meeting in 1987, one with Nelson Mandela on June 21, 1990, and one discussing the War in Iraq in 2003. The first such &quot;Town Meeting&quot;, in 1987, was an extended edition (running for four hours and 12 minutes, until 3:47 a.m. Eastern Time, on the night of its broadcast) discussing the AIDS epidemic of that period in the U.S. A major portion of the episode was devoted to interviews where important people were asked tough questions on the spot. Another series of town hall meetings featured public discussions and appearances by Japanese officials on the poor performance of American business during the 1980s, contrasted with the success of Japanese businesses. These town hall meetings coincided with the corporate takeovers of U.S. companies by Japanese corporations during the early 1990s (such as MCA by Matsushita, and CBS Records and Columbia Pictures by Sony Corporation).

What had been intended to be a benign episode dedicated to the 40th anniversary of Jackie Robinson breaking Major League Baseball&#x27;s color barrier ended up being remembered for one of the show&#x27;s controversial moments. The April 6, 1987 broadcast included longtime Los Angeles Dodgers executive Al Campanis, who had been with the franchise since before Robinson&#x27;s debut. When Ted Koppel asked Campanis about why there were so few black field managers or general managers in the sport, Campanis responded awkwardly, saying that blacks may lack the &quot;necessities&quot; to succeed in those positions. Despite Koppel offering Campanis numerous chances to clarify or retract his remark (asking Campanis several times &quot;Do you really believe that?&quot;), Campanis&#x27; subsequent responses only worsened his position. Koppel ultimately scolded Campanis on-air for proposing the &quot;same kind of garbage&quot; that Robinson&#x27;s critics and skeptics had peddled in 1947. Shortly after the interview, the Dodgers fired Campanis.

Later in 1987, the program broadcast an exclusive interview with televangelists Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker, following the former&#x27;s sex scandal that brought down their PTL ministry. On December 3, 1990, &quot;Nightline&quot; played Madonna&#x27;s controversial music video &quot;Justify My Love&quot; in its entirety, then interviewed Madonna live about the video&#x27;s sexual content and censorship. The video contained imagery of sadomasochism, voyeurism and bisexuality. When asked whether she stood to make more money selling the video than airing it on MTV, she shrugged and answered, &quot;Yeah, so? Lucky me.&quot; She also mentioned that the banning was hypocritical, as male artists were able to show music videos on the channel which contained sexist and violent imagery. She also mentioned that in her &quot;Vogue&quot; music video she had worn a see-through lace top which exposed her breasts, but this was passed by the channel.

In 1997, &quot;Nightline&quot; aired &quot;ABC Exclusive&quot; footage of the trial of former Cambodian dictator Pol Pot, in violation of a verbal agreement between ABC News and freelance journalist Nate Thayer to use the footage of Pot&#x27;s trial. Thayer later sued Koppel and ABC News for $30 million in punitive damages and unspecified compensatory damages.

===Reading of the names===

On April 30, 2004, Koppel read the names of members of the United States Armed Forces who were killed in the Iraq War since it began in March 2003. This prompted controversy from conservatives who believed that Koppel was making a political statement and from management at Hunt Valley, Maryland-based television station owner Sinclair Broadcast Group, which felt that ABC was undermining the war effort in Iraq; in protest, Sinclair forced its ABC-affiliated stations not to air that night&#x27;s edition. Others, most notably the television columnist for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, thought it was a ratings stunt for sweeps; indeed &quot;Nightline&quot; was the highest-rated program during that time period, and had about 30% more viewers than other editions of the program which aired that week. ABC responded to the controversy, saying that the program was meant to be &quot;an expression of respect which seeks to honor those who have laid down their lives for this country.&quot;

Koppel repeated the format on May 28, 2004, reading the names of service members killed in the war in Afghanistan, and on May 30, 2005, reading the names of all service members killed in Afghanistan or Iraq between the last program and the preparation of the program. This time, all of Sinclair&#x27;s ABC stations aired the program as scheduled.

===Ratings and threats of cancellation===
For many years, rumors had been spread about the show&#x27;s possible cancellation. However, during the so-called &quot;late night wars&quot; of 1993, when the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; began competing with &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, some in the industry believed that &quot;Nightline&quot; would wind up in first place. On occasion, when a significant news story occurred, &quot;Nightline&quot; would top its entertainment rivals in the ratings.

In 2002, ABC attempted to hire David Letterman away from CBS, a move that would likely have forced the network to cancel &quot;Nightline&quot;. However, Letterman opted to sign a renewed contract with CBS to remain host of the &quot;Late Show&quot;. An unverified story suggested that Letterman would have made the move had a Letterman talk show on ABC started at 12:05 a.m. Eastern Time in order to preserve &quot;Nightline&quot;. When ABC debuted &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; as a late-night talk competitor to &quot;Tonight&quot; and the &quot;Late Show&quot; in January 2003, it was placed at the 12:06 a.m. Eastern timeslot instead of the 11:35 p.m. slot occupied at the time by &quot;Nightline&quot;, again preventing its cancellation.

===Koppel&#x27;s final broadcast and &quot;Closing Thought&quot;===
In March 2005, Ted Koppel announced that he would be leaving the show at the end of his contract. On November 22, 2005, Koppel retired from &quot;Nightline&quot; after 25 years as anchor of the program, and left ABC News after 42 years with the network, although it was an early departure from both as his contract was not set to expire until December.

Koppel&#x27;s final broadcast of &quot;Nightline&quot; did not feature clips, memorable interviews or famous moments from his tenure as host, as would be typical when an anchor retires. Instead, it featured Koppel&#x27;s 1995 interview with college professor Morrie Schwartz, who was suffering with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. For this broadcast, Koppel interviewed sports journalist Mitch Albom, who had been a student of Schwartz. Albom talked about how the &quot;Nightline&quot; interviews led and inspired him into contacting Schwartz personally, and then visiting him weekly. These visits became the basis of the book &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&quot;, chronicling lessons about life learned from Schwartz. The interview was significant because Morrie was actually interviewed 3 times including the 1995 interview which took place a couple weeks before Morrie&#x27;s death.

Every so often, Koppel ended the program with a &quot;Closing Thought&quot;, in which Koppel usually expressed his opinion on the subject of the night&#x27;s broadcast. On his final night, urging viewers to continue watching the program, Koppel concluded his final &quot;Nightline&quot; broadcast with the following &quot;Closing Thought&quot;:
==Post-Koppel &quot;Nightline&quot; (2005–present)==
British journalist and producer James Goldston was appointed as the programme&#x27;s executive producer in 2005. He opted to scrap the format of the existing broadcast, and on November 28, 2005, replaced Koppel with a three-anchor team of Martin Bashir (Goldston&#x27;s compatriot and colleague on ITV&#x27;s &quot;Living with Michael Jackson&quot;) and Cynthia McFadden at Times Square Studios in New York City and Terry Moran in Washington, D.C.

Along with the new anchors, &quot;Nightline&quot; began airing live each night (outside of pre-taped story packages) and switched to a multi-topic format (similar to the format attempted during the short-lived 1983 expansion to an hour-long broadcast, although condensed to fit a half-hour timeslot) – that covers multiple stories in each broadcast. The conversion to a multi-topic format has received some criticism due to the fact that it is more difficult to focus on a story subject in depth when there is much less time devoted to it, and that more stories seen on the program seem to focus more on popular culture, rather than news events. However, ratings increased after the new format was implemented, even beating the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; for three consecutive weeks in August 2006 and again in 2008.

On July 11, 2006, in his first appearance on the program since leaving &quot;Nightline&quot; in November 2005, Ted Koppel made a surprise appearance on that night&#x27;s broadcast to discuss the prisoner situation at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp with co-anchor Terry Moran, and to discuss his then upcoming series for the Discovery Channel.

On August 7, 2006, ABC shut down full-time &quot;Nightline&quot; production from Times Square and moved the program to the ABC News Headquarters in Lincoln Square, citing high production costs and logistical problems, though some special editions still do originate from Times Square Studios. In 2009, &quot;Nightline&quot; announced that an online program was in development that would be hosted by the show&#x27;s anchors through Twitter, encouraging viewer discussion on the website.

In a 2008 interview with correspondent Bob Woodruff featured on the program, former United States Senator and 2004 Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards admitted to having had an adulterous affair unbeknownst his wife, Elizabeth, with a campaign staffer (later identified as Rielle Hunter) who worked on his campaign for the then-forthcoming 2008 presidential election, which he would drop out of. In the 2009-2010 television season, the series narrowly beat &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; as the highest-rated late-night program in the U.S. in terms of total viewers, assisted by the &quot;Tonight Show&quot; conflict and notable interviews with Bill Clinton, Terry Jones, and Sarah Palin.

===2010s===
In August 2010, Martin Bashir left &quot;Nightline&quot; to serve as a correspondent with NBC News and host a daytime news/interview program on MSNBC; he was subsequently replaced by Bill Weir.

On January 20, 2011, ABC News president Ben Sherwood announced that &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; (for which &quot;Nightline&quot; had been serving as its lead-in since that program premiered in January 2003) would have its start time moved five minutes earlier to 12:00 a.m. Eastern Time, reducing &quot;Nightline&quot;″s running time from 31 to 25 minutes. It was also announced that ABC would produce up to 13 hours of prime-time news content under the &quot;Nightline&quot; brand. For the 2011–2012 television season, &quot;Nightline&quot; again placed as the most-watched late-night television program among the major networks.

In 2011 Goldston departed as executive producer to move to &quot;Good Morning America.&quot;

On August 21, 2012, ABC announced that the program would switch timeslots with &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; beginning January 8, 2013: &quot;Nightline&quot; was moved one hour later to 12:35 a.m. Eastern Time, while &quot;Kimmel&quot; moved to the program&#x27;s former 11:35 p.m. timeslot, in order to compete with fellow late night talk shows &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; and the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. Upon the move, &quot;Nightline&quot; was also expanded to 30 minutes.

As part of this move, ABC also announced that it would launch a prime time news magazine extension of &quot;Nightline&quot;, which was originally scheduled to premiere on March 1, 2013; the premiere of this program – later retitled &quot;The Lookout&quot;, which focuses mainly on consumer reports and is produced by the &quot;Nightline&quot; staff – was subsequently pushed back to May 29, 2013, airing in a Wednesday 10:00 p.m. Eastern timeslot. Another prime time version of &quot;Nightline&quot;, &quot;Nightline Prime&quot;, premiered on March 15, 2014, in a Saturday 9:00 p.m. Eastern timeslot; this series featured reporters using small cameras to cover stories from within.

In October 2013, &quot;Good Morning America&quot; weekend co-anchor Dan Harris was named as a co-anchor of &quot;Nightline&quot;, replacing Bill Weir (who had recently left ABC News to become a correspondent for CNN). In August 2014, Cynthia McFadden left &quot;Nightline&quot; and ABC News to become a correspondent for NBC News, and was replaced as co-anchor by existing ABC News correspondent (and frequent contributor to the program) Juju Chang. On December 18, 2014, it was announced that Dan Abrams would step down as an anchor of the program after that night&#x27;s broadcast (although he would remain with ABC News as a correspondent and legal analyst), and would be replaced by Byron Pitts effective the following day (December 19).

=== 2020s ===
From March 16, 2020, &quot;Nightline&quot; presented extended coverage of the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States; co-anchor Pitts explained that the show was &quot;leaning more heavily into [its] roots&quot;, and was consistent with the show itself having been &quot;born in response to a crisis, giving facts, context and, when possible, comfort as our nation dealt with the Iran hostages&quot;. It was also announced that the program would temporarily return to its former 11:35 p.m. time slot from March 17 to April 10, replacing J&quot;immy Kimmel Live!&quot; (which went on hiatus with reruns until March 30, when the program returned with original episodes produced from Kimmel&#x27;s home). &quot;Nightline&quot; was the highest-rated late-night program that week in total and key demographic viewership.

On March 24, 2020, &quot;Nightline&quot; marked its 40th anniversary; Ted Koppel made a guest appearance, where he discussed his wife&#x27;s vulnerability to COVID-19 due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and opined that &quot;it&#x27;s time more than ever in this country to come to the realization that what we need more than anything else, is reliable, credible journalists.&quot;

In 2022, ABC News launched a sister newsmagazine, &quot;IMPACT x Nightline&quot;, that streams on Hulu.

==International broadcasts==
==&quot;Nightline on Fusion&quot;==
On February 12, 2015, it was announced that ABC and Univision would launch a new version of &quot;Nightline&quot; on Fusion called Nightline on Fusion. It was hosted by Gio Benitez and Kimberly Brooks and aired on Tuesdays at 9 pm eastern with repeats at other times. The show was similar to the ABC version and shares resources and correspondents. However, the Fusion version put more emphasis on stories from the flagship program which resonate with Fusion&#x27;s younger, more culturally diverse target audience. It also featured original content produced for Fusion.

<doc id="195060" wikidata="Q2958852" url="?curid=195060" title="Charles Daudelin">
<text>Charles Daudelin, (October 1, 1920 – April 2, 2001) was a French Canadian pioneer in modern sculpture and painting. He worked in a wide variety of media, including painting, metal and ceramic sculpture, jewelry, and marionettes which he made with his wife, Louise.

==Life and work==
Charles Daudelin was born on October 1, 1920, in Granby, Quebec.
In 1939 he moved to Montreal, where he worked for the silversmith Gilles Beaugrand, a childhood friend of Paul-Émile Borduas. While still working for Beaugrand, he enrolled in evening classes at the École du meuble in Montreal, then attended full-time in 1941. He joined the Contemporary Arts Society in 1941. In May 1943, he and 22 other artists under the age of thirty, including several students of Borduas at the École du Meuble, took part in the Sagittarius exhibition at the Dominion Gallery, organized by Maurice Gagnon, professor at the École du Meuble, and which would constitute a milestone in the history of the Automatistes. Daudelin exhibited several works there, including sculptures. In September 1943 in Granby, Daudelin`s first solo exhibition took place, also organized by Maurice Gagnon.

Between 1944 and 1945, Daudelin made two visits to New York City, where he visited the atelier of Fernand Léger. Between 1946 and 1948, he spent time in Paris, where he regularly saw Léger and met the sculptor Henri Laurens, who he would meet a number of times, and was afterwards influenced by Laurens` organic form.

He married Louise Bissonette in 1946, who worked with him.

He taught at the École des beaux-arts in Montréal until 1967. He became a pioneer in integrating art into public space. He created many public artworks, including:
* &quot;Polypède&quot; (1967), McGill University, Montreal
* &quot;Allegrocube&quot; (1973), Palais de justice de Montréal;
* the altar screen for the Sacré-Coeur chapel for Notre-Dame Basilica, Montreal;
* &quot;Agora&quot; (1981), Viger Square, Montreal 
* &quot;Embâcle&quot; (1984), Place du Québec, Paris;
* aluminum joints at Mont-Royal station and large sculptural grilles at Langelier station in the Montreal metro.

The Musée d&#x27;art contemporain de Montréal and the Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec mounted a major retrospective of Daudelin’s work in 1974. In 1997, the Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec presented Daudelin, a retrospective of his career shown through over 180 of his works. His work is in the Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec (117 works), the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts the Robert McLaughlin Gallery, Oshawa and the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa.

Daudelin lived in Kirkland, Quebec, and died in nearby Pointe-Claire, Quebec. His last work, &quot;Le Passage du 2 avril&quot;, is named for the date of his death and installed in front of Kirkland City Hall. 

A postage stamp depicting Daudelin&#x27;s work &quot;Embâcle&quot; was issued by Canada Post on June 10, 2002.

Daudelin&#x27;s Kirkland home, which had been designated a protected heritage site by Quebec&#x27;s Ministry of Culture and Communications in 2023, burned down on December 29, 2024.

==Honours==
* Second prize, Concours artistiques du Québec for painting (1946) and sculpture (1964, 1969)
* Victor Martyn Lynch-Staunton Award from the Canada Council for the Arts (1971)

* Prix Philippe-Hébert from the St-Jean-Baptiste Society of Montréal (1981) 
* Prix Paul-Émile-Borduas, Government of Quebec (1985)
* Royal Canadian Academy of Arts (1985)
* Academy of Great Montrealers in the Cultural category (1994)
* Grand Officier, Ordre national du Québec (1998)
* Commander of the Ordre de Montréal (2016)

==Controversy==
In 2015, it was announced that Daudelin&#x27;s public art piece, &quot;Agora&quot; in Viger Square, which had been meant to mimic the gardens of Greek antiquity, would be replaced with a minimalist park. However, in 2016, the makeover stalled since the Square sits on top of Ville-Marie Expressway, which is provincial jurisdiction. Work began on the area of the square referred to as the îlot Daudelin, and many of the concrete structures there, created by Charles Daudelin, were demolished. Others were restored and there were plans for better lighting and new drainage and sewer systems. As of 2019, the redevelopment was due to be completed in 2021 with a cost of 63.2 million, almost double the initial amount.

<doc id="195061" wikidata="Q434902" url="?curid=195061" title="Ed Rendell">
<text>Edward Gene Rendell (; born January 5, 1944) is an American politician, author, and former prosecutor who served as the 45th governor of Pennsylvania from 2003 to 2011. He previously served as chair of the national Democratic Party from 1999 to 2001, as mayor of Philadelphia from 1992 to 2000, and as district attorney of Philadelphia from 1978 to 1986.

Born in New York City to a Jewish family from Russia, Rendell moved to Philadelphia for college, completing his B.A. from the University of Pennsylvania and J.D. from Villanova University School of Law. He was elected District Attorney of Philadelphia for two terms from 1978 to 1986. He developed a reputation for being tough on crime, fueling a run for governor of Pennsylvania in 1986, which Rendell lost in the primary.

Elected mayor of Philadelphia in 1991, he inherited a $250 million deficit and the lowest credit rating of any major city in the country. As mayor, he balanced Philadelphia&#x27;s budget and generated a budget surplus while cutting business and wage taxes and dramatically improving services to Philadelphia neighborhoods. &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that Philadelphia under Rendell &quot;has made one of the most stunning turnarounds in recent urban history.&quot; Nicknamed &quot;America&#x27;s Mayor&quot; by Al Gore, Rendell served as chairman of the Democratic National Committee during the 2000 presidential election.

In 2002, Rendell was elected governor of Pennsylvania. He was a member of the Democratic Governors Association Executive Committee and served as the chairman of the National Governors Association. He was reelected in a landslide in 2006. He left office in 2011 due to term limits, and released a book, &quot;A Nation of Wusses: How America&#x27;s Leaders Lost the Guts to Make Us Great&quot;, the following year. A Philadelphia Eagles fan, Rendell is also a football analyst on NBC Sports Philadelphia&#x27;s Eagles Postgame Live, hosted by Michael Barkann.

==Early life==
Ed Rendell was born on January 5, 1944, in New York City, the son of Emma (&quot;née&quot; Sloat) and Jesse T. Rendell. His parents were Jewish, and all four of his grandparents were immigrants from Russia. He attended Riverdale Country School before the University of Pennsylvania, where he joined the Pi Lambda Phi fraternity in 1962 and earned a BA degree in 1965. In 1968, he earned a JD at Villanova University School of Law. He served as a 2nd Lieutenant in the U.S. Army Reserve from 1968 to 1974.

==District attorney==
Rendell was elected district attorney of Philadelphia in 1977, becoming the youngest DA in history, after he defeated the incumbent Democratic district attorney, Emmett Fitzpatrick, in the primary election. Rendell ran a campaign that emphasized that he was new to politics and so was not tainted by its corruption.

As district attorney, Rendell reportedly had a mean temper while doing his job. Once, he yelled in the governor&#x27;s face for releasing a certain prisoner. It has been said that Rendell would even punch walls or throw furniture when he became upset. In 1980, Rendell received 28 delegate votes for vice president at the Democratic National Convention, although he was not a candidate. He served two terms as DA before leaving in 1986 to run for governor of Pennsylvania. He was defeated in the Democratic gubernatorial primary by Bob Casey, Sr.

In 1982, during his second term, Rendell presided over the controversial prosecution of Mumia Abu-Jamal, resulting in a death sentence that was overturned in 2011. The 1985 bombing of the Black religious community MOVE by the Philadelphia police also occurred during Rendell&#x27;s tenure and killed 6 adults plus 5 children and caused a fire that left hundreds of neighbors homeless.

==Mayor of Philadelphia==

In 1987, Rendell ran for the Democratic nomination against the incumbent mayor, Wilson Goode and lost. Rendell ran successfully four years later, in 1991. His opponent was to be Democrat-turned-Republican former Philadelphia Mayor, Frank Rizzo. Rizzo, however, died in the summer of 1991; in November 1991, Rendell won by more than a 2–1 margin against Joseph M. Egan, Jr., Rizzo&#x27;s replacement on the Republican ticket.

As mayor, Rendell inherited massive fiscal problems. The state legislature established a fiscal oversight board to monitor the City of Philadelphia&#x27;s fiscal issues. During his career as mayor, Rendell cut a $250 million deficit, balanced Philadelphia&#x27;s budget and oversaw five consecutive years of budget surpluses, reduced business and wage taxes for four consecutive years, implemented new revenue-generating initiatives, and dramatically improved services to Philadelphia neighborhoods. He was given the nickname &quot;Philadelphia&#x27;s Renaissance or Revival&quot; because of how well he did with the budget. He also appointed Philadelphia&#x27;s first ever Latino deputy mayors, Benjamin Ramos and Manuel Ortiz. Rendell&#x27;s cost-cutting policies brought him strong opposition from labor unions; however, he was re-elected in 1995, defeating Republican Joe Rocks with 80% of the vote.

Rendell&#x27;s first term as mayor was chronicled in a best-selling book &quot;A Prayer for the City&quot; by journalist Buzz Bissinger. The author was given practically unlimited access to the mayor during that term. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called Rendell&#x27;s job as mayor &quot;the most stunning turnaround in recent urban history&quot; due to his determination, inspiration, ambition, and his energy.

In 1996, Rendell signed an executive order, 2-96, which allowed same-sex couples of Philadelphia health benefits.

To date, Rendell is the last Philadelphia Mayor to not have previously served as member of Philadelphia City Council.

==2002 gubernatorial campaign==

When he announced his intent to seek the Democratic nomination for governor of Pennsylvania, he did so without the backing of the state party. The Pennsylvania Democratic Party threw their support behind Bob Casey Jr., son of recently deceased former Governor Bob Casey Sr., whom the party saw as a more electable candidate against the liberal Rendell. In a bitter primary, Rendell won the nomination by winning only 10 out of 67 counties: Philadelphia; its suburbs: Bucks, Chester, Montgomery, and Delaware; its exurbs: Berks, Lancaster, Lehigh, and Northampton; and Centre County, the home of Penn State University.
In the November 2002 gubernatorial election, he defeated Republican State Attorney General Mike Fisher, garnering 53 percent of the vote to Fisher&#x27;s 44 percent. Rendell won not only Philadelphia County, which is heavily Democratic, but also traditionally Republican suburbs of Philadelphia, largely due to his popularity as mayor of Philadelphia. These traditionally Republican voters who backed Rendell were called &quot;Rendellicans&quot; in other parts of the state and were a key part of the success of his campaign.

In a 2002 PoliticsPA feature story designating politicians with yearbook superlatives, he was named the &quot;Most Likely to Succeed.&quot; His campaign website was described as having &quot;cutting edge in design for a political site.&quot;

==Governor of Pennsylvania (2003–2011)==
===First term===
The first piece of legislation Rendell initiated was &quot;The Plan for a New Pennsylvania&quot;. The plan proposed using slot machine revenue to reduce taxes by $1 billion and included $687 million in increased education funding. The plan was to be paid for with a proposed income tax increase from 2.80 percent to 3.75 percent plus increased taxes on utilities and beer. The governor&#x27;s plan passed but with a smaller tax increase to only 3.07 percent and increased education funding of $224 million. The final budget deal included additional taxes on cigarettes and utilities.
Later that year, the Rendell administration passed a prescription drug plan that covered older Pennsylvanians. In his first year, Rendell created the Office of Management and Productivity with the goal of cutting $1 billion in administrative expenses by the end of his first term. One of the most widely touted successes from Rendell&#x27;s productivity initiative was strategic sourcing in which he overhauled the Commonwealth&#x27;s antiquated procurement system, leading to $180 million in annual savings and a quadrupling of Pennsylvania&#x27;s minority- and women- owned business participation rate.

Rendell proposed that the 8 cents per gallon tax on beer be raised to 25 cents per gallon. Brewery D.G. Yuengling &amp; Son spokesman, David Casinelli, was a critic of the tax. Casinelli expressed his view on the tax increase proposal by saying, &quot;it seems like every time the state needs money, they come to alcohol or tobacco, and, frankly, it&#x27;s not fair.&quot;

In 2004, Rendell persuaded the Pennsylvania General Assembly to pass measures to legalize and tax slot machine parlors, with the revenues from these measures to be used to reduce property taxes. Prior to this legislation, the only legal forms of gambling in Pennsylvania were horse racing and the state-run lottery. Rendell has been criticized by many opponents of legalized gambling.

In a compromise with the legislature, Rendell accepted a provision requiring that tax reductions only occur in areas where local school boards voted to accept the funding. Act 72 funding, as it came to be known, was accepted by only one fifth of Pennsylvania&#x27;s school districts.

Following Act 72, Rendell and the Pennsylvania legislature looked at other proposals to reduce property taxes, a key component of his 2002 campaign. The governor said he was willing to consider legislation that changes Act 72, and legislative proposals were made to force school districts to accept the money. Other proposed legislation would have required the issue to be voted on in each district as a ballot question, rather than decided by school boards. Property tax relief and Act 72 were issues of great controversy and have been subject to political gridlock, and it was unclear when changes would be made.

In April 2004, Rendell confirmed reports that his state trooper chauffeurs regularly exceeded posted speed limits, and he claimed to be surprised to learn that they sometimes drove him at speeds in excess of 100 mph. He said that he initiated an investigation into the matter. Subsequently, in August 2004, the State Police announced a new policy that state troopers would no longer be allowed to exceed the speed limit, except in emergencies. However, in 2007, following news that Governor Corzine of New Jersey was in an accident in a state trooper-driven vehicle that was traveling in excess of 90 mph, Rendell was quoted as saying &quot;I&#x27;ve told my troopers that I don&#x27;t want them exceeding 80 unless they need to pass or unless there&#x27;s some real exigent circumstance.&quot; At the time, the highest speed limit in Pennsylvania was 65 mph, and the current 70 mph limit was instituted in 2014 through legislation signed by Rendell&#x27;s successor.

In early 2005, Rendell made statements that seemed to support President George W. Bush&#x27;s Social Security privatization proposal. Rendell addressed this issue in later speeches, saying that he opposes social security privatization, and that his previous comments were meant to show admiration for President Bush for taking on a politically risky subject. Nevertheless, Rendell&#x27;s initial statements cost him support among Democrats who are against Social Security privatization.

In the early morning hours of July 7, 2005, Ed Rendell signed a bill into law that increased pay for state lawmakers, judges, and top executive-branch officials. The vote took place at 2 am without public review or commentary. On November 16, 2005, Rendell signed a repeal of the pay raise after a near unanimous vote for repeal.

===2006 reelection campaign===

Rendell won re-election on November 7, 2006, defeating Lynn Swann, a former professional football player for the Pittsburgh Steelers. by a vote of 2,470,517 (60%) to 1,622,135 (40%).

During his re-election campaign, Rendell was instrumental in the successful Senate candidacy of Bob Casey, Jr. who had run against him for the Democratic nomination for governor in 2002.

===Second term===
Rendell was sworn into his second term as governor of Pennsylvania on January 16, 2007. In 2007, as a residual effect of the potent political power the pay raise issue had in central and western Pennsylvania, Rendell stepped up criticism of the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency (PHEAA) and its executive salaries and expenses, following published newspaper reports, in an effort to leverage PHEAA&#x27;s profits from federal student loan revenues to help finance the Commonwealth&#x27;s need-based state grant program for undergraduate post-secondary education (both for grants and for the administration of the program). PHEAA, however, was not directly under the control of the governor. The agency was created as an independent state agency in the 1960s by the Pennsylvania General Assembly to provide state funded scholarships. It eventually took on student loan servicing arrangements which generated non-public revenues which then were used, in part, to dramatically increase executive salaries. The PHEAA board is composed primarily of members of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives and Senate.
In July 2007, Rendell ordered a state government shutdown following a dispute with the state legislature over legislative initiatives related to the state budget. Approximately 25,000 state workers were furloughed. The shutdown was resolved within eight days.

A capital punishment supporter, Rendell signed 78 execution warrants during his term, but none of them were enforced due to stays.

In 2008, Rendell backed the effort to proceed with the Delaware River Deepening Project. The project was planned to have been carried out by the Delaware River Port Authority. The Delaware River Port Authority board from New Jersey decided that they no longer wanted to be associated with the project. Rendell then attempted to force New Jersey to back the project by exercising his Delaware River Port Authority board chairman power.

In December 2008, Rendell received criticism for stating that Arizona Governor Janet Napolitano was &quot;perfect&quot; for the role of Secretary of Homeland Security because, &quot;...for that job, you have to have no life. Janet has no family. Perfect. She can devote, literally, 19, 20 hours a day to it.&quot;

Rendell drew some criticism following a late January 2009 preview of his budget proposal that would eliminate 100 budget line items, including programs such as the Pennsylvania Governor&#x27;s Schools of Excellence and Drug Abuse Resistance Education (&quot;D.A.R.E.&quot;). These program cuts are part of Rendell&#x27;s proposal to cut state expenditures to a level 1 percent below the 2002-2003 budget in response to an expected 2.3 billion dollar budget shortfall. As a result of stress caused by the budget crisis, Rendell spokesman Chuck Ardo resigned.

Rendell called for reinstating the Federal Assault Weapons Ban in the wake of a shootout in Pittsburgh.

Although adding tolls to Interstate highways was not an element of his 2006 re-election campaign, Rendell introduced a plan in 2007, following his re-election, to add tolls to Route 80, which crosses the entire state from New Jersey to Ohio. This resulted in a complicated, multi-year battle fought at both the state and Federal level. The Federal Highway Administration rejected the plan for tolls on Route 80 in 2007, again in 2008, and again for the final time in 2010. Although the decision was made by an agency of the Executive branch, a bi-partisan group of Pennsylvania&#x27;s members of the U.S. House of Representatives were on the record against tolling Route 80.

===Involvement in presidential elections===

Rendell was a potential candidate to serve as Senator John Kerry&#x27;s running mate in the 2004 presidential campaign.

Rendell&#x27;s popularity, particularly in the suburban ring of counties around Philadelphia, was a key to Kerry&#x27;s victory in Pennsylvania, one of the most hotly contested swing states in the 2004 presidential election.

On January 24, 2008, Rendell announced his endorsement of Hillary Clinton in her race for the Democratic presidential nomination. He stated that &quot;[Hillary] really cares about moving this country forward. She also has the best health-care plan for America.&quot;

As one of Hillary Clinton&#x27;s staunchest supporters, Rendell argued that many media outlets&#x27; coverage of her campaign were biased. On March 31, 2008, he congratulated Fox News on what he considered to be the best campaign coverage. Addressing &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot; host Steve Doocy, Rendell said, &quot;I think during this entire primary coverage, starting in Iowa and up to the present, Fox has done the fairest job, has remained the most objective of all the cable networks ... You actually have done a very balanced job of reporting the news, and some of the other stations are just caught up with Senator Obama, who is a great guy, but Senator Obama can do no wrong, and Senator Clinton can do no right.&quot;

Rendell reached out to various Pennsylvania mayors in order to get them to speak out in support of Clinton. He assisted her with establishing her messages. Some superdelegates maintained a neutral stance prior to the Pennsylvania primary as a result of Rendell talking them into remaining neutral until the Pennsylvania primary was over. Clinton also benefited from televised endorsement ads Rendell made on her behalf.

After Clinton dropped out of the race, Rendell endorsed Senator Barack Obama in June 2008 and made several campaign appearances on his behalf.

As state governor, Rendell was one of the 768 superdelegates to the Democratic National Convention.

==Post-gubernatorial career==

Rendell was term-limited for the election of 2010. He was succeeded by Republican Tom Corbett on January 18, 2011. Following the end of his career as governor of Pennsylvania, Rendell returned to his former law firm, the Philadelphia-based Ballard Spahr.

In January 2011, he accepted a position as an on-air political analyst for NBC News and MSNBC, and the following month took a position as senior advisor at boutique investment bank Greenhill &amp; Co.

In April 2011, Rendell joined Element Partners, a Philadelphia-based cleantech investment firm, as an Operating Partner.

Also in 2011, Rendell reportedly acted as a go-between for Range Resources Corp, an oil and gas exploration and production company, and then United States EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson, regarding a Texas water contamination case; and has been a vocal proponent of shale gas extraction as part of a United States energy strategy. Rendell is a faculty member of the Fels Institute of Government at the University of Pennsylvania, and chair of Team Pennsylvania Foundation.

In 2016, Rendell admitted that during his term as Governor of Pennsylvania, he underperformed when he dealt with the growing popularity of shale gas in Pennsylvania. Rendell stated, &quot;I made a mistake in the rush to get the economic part of fracking delivered to Pennsylvania&quot; saying that he should have been more concerned with the effect shale gas has on Pennsylvania&#x27;s environment and not with how Pennsylvania could benefit financially from shale gas.

==Personal life==
His wife, Marjorie Rendell, is a Federal judge for the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit who was appointed by President Bill Clinton. They married on July 10, 1971, and have one son, Jesse.

Ed and Marjorie Rendell announced their separation shortly after he left office in 2011. They filed for divorce in September 2016.

Rendell acknowledged that he has dealt with Parkinson&#x27;s disease for over three years in a press conference at the University of Pennsylvania hospital in June 2018.

He also has had a few movie cameos. During his tenure as Mayor of Philadelphia, he appeared in the 1993 film Philadelphia as himself. He also played the Philadelphia Mayor in the 2015 film &quot;The Benefactor&quot; and the 2019 film &quot;In the Shadow of the Moon&quot; (Although out of office in real life this time for both of these movies).

===Sports fan===
Rendell is a Philadelphia Eagles fan and part of the panel on the NBC Sports Philadelphia show Eagles Postgame Live, which airs after every Eagles regular and post-season game. Rendell was among the crowd in attendance for Bounty Bowl II in 1989, in which the unruly fans threw snow and ice at the field; Rendell wagered (and lost) $20 expecting that a fellow fan could not throw a snowball from the stands of the stadium to the field. He even made a friendly wager on the outcome of Super Bowl XXXIX, promising to wear a New England Patriots jersey and sing the national anthem at a Philadelphia 76ers/Boston Celtics game if the Eagles lost, which they did.

He would lose similar friendly wagers with the Governor of New York, David Paterson, in supporting the Philadelphia Phillies on their quest to defend their championship against the New York Yankees in and again with Governor of Illinois, Pat Quinn, in supporting the Philadelphia Flyers in the quest to win the 2010 Stanley Cup Finals against the Chicago Blackhawks. In 2006, he won a bet with the Governor of Washington, Christine Gregoire in supporting the Pittsburgh Steelers in their quest to win Super Bowl XL over the Seattle Seahawks 21–10.

As a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, Rendell frequently supports the Penn basketball team and can be seen at games at the Palestra. He has also assisted in finding new corporate sponsorship for Philadelphia International Championship, a 21-year-old Philadelphia bicycle race.

Also a Philadelphia Phillies fan, he spoke at a memorial service for Hall of Fame announcer Harry Kalas at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia on April 18, 2009.

On December 26, 2010, the Philadelphia Eagles home game against the visiting Minnesota Vikings was postponed before any snow had fallen due to an impending blizzard in Philadelphia. Rendell said of the postponement, &quot;My biggest beef is that this is part of what&#x27;s happened in this country. We&#x27;ve become a nation of wusses. The Chinese are kicking our butt in everything. If this was in China do you think the Chinese would have called off the game? People would have been marching down to the stadium, they would have walked and they would have been doing calculus on the way down.&quot; As a result, the grounds crew piled snow on his reserved seat the following game, and topped it with a sign that said &quot;This seat reserved for non-wussies&quot;.

<doc id="195063" wikidata="Q2365325" url="?curid=195063" title="Orthonormal basis">
<text>In mathematics, particularly linear algebra, an orthonormal basis for an inner product space formula_1 with finite dimension is a basis for formula_1 whose vectors are orthonormal, that is, they are all unit vectors and orthogonal to each other. For example, the standard basis for a Euclidean space formula_3 is an orthonormal basis, where the relevant inner product is the dot product of vectors. The image of the standard basis under a rotation or reflection (or any orthogonal transformation) is also orthonormal, and every orthonormal basis for formula_3 arises in this fashion.
An orthonormal basis can be derived from an orthogonal basis via normalization.
The choice of an origin and an orthonormal basis forms a coordinate frame known as an orthonormal frame.

For a general inner product space formula_5 an orthonormal basis can be used to define normalized orthogonal coordinates on formula_6 Under these coordinates, the inner product becomes a dot product of vectors. Thus the presence of an orthonormal basis reduces the study of a finite-dimensional inner product space to the study of formula_3 under the dot product. Every finite-dimensional inner product space has an orthonormal basis, which may be obtained from an arbitrary basis using the Gram–Schmidt process.

In functional analysis, the concept of an orthonormal basis can be generalized to arbitrary (infinite-dimensional) inner product spaces. Given a pre-Hilbert space formula_8 an &quot;orthonormal basis&quot; for formula_9 is an orthonormal set of vectors with the property that every vector in formula_9 can be written as an infinite linear combination of the vectors in the basis. In this case, the orthonormal basis is sometimes called a Hilbert basis for formula_11 Note that an orthonormal basis in this sense is not generally a Hamel basis, since infinite linear combinations are required. Specifically, the linear span of the basis must be dense in formula_8 although not necessarily the entire space.

If we go on to Hilbert spaces, a non-orthonormal set of vectors having the same linear span as an orthonormal basis may not be a basis at all. For instance, any square-integrable function on the interval formula_13 can be expressed (almost everywhere) as an infinite sum of Legendre polynomials (an orthonormal basis), but not necessarily as an infinite sum of the monomials formula_14

A different generalisation is to pseudo-inner product spaces, finite-dimensional vector spaces formula_15 equipped with a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form known as the metric tensor. In such a basis, the metric takes the form formula_16 with formula_17 positive ones and formula_18 negative ones.

==Examples==

* For formula_19, the set of vectors formula_20 is called the standard basis and forms an orthonormal basis of formula_19 with respect to the standard dot product. Note that both the standard basis and standard dot product rely on viewing formula_19 as the Cartesian product formula_23
*:Proof: A straightforward computation shows that the inner products of these vectors equals zero, formula_24 and that each of their magnitudes equals one, formula_25 This means that formula_26 is an orthonormal set. All vectors formula_27 can be expressed as a sum of the basis vectors scaled formula_28 so formula_26 spans formula_30 and hence must be a basis. It may also be shown that the standard basis rotated about an axis through the origin or reflected in a plane through the origin also forms an orthonormal basis of formula_30.
* For formula_32, the standard basis and inner product are similarly defined. Any other orthonormal basis is related to the standard basis by an orthogonal transformation in the group O(n).
* For pseudo-Euclidean space formula_33, an orthogonal basis formula_34 with metric formula_35 instead satisfies formula_36 if formula_37, formula_38 if formula_39, and formula_40 if formula_41. Any two orthonormal bases are related by a pseudo-orthogonal transformation. In the case formula_42, these are Lorentz transformations.
* The set formula_43 with formula_44 where formula_45 denotes the exponential function, forms an orthonormal basis of the space of functions with finite Lebesgue integrals, formula_46 with respect to the 2-norm. This is fundamental to the study of Fourier series.
* The set formula_47 with formula_48 if formula_49 and formula_50 otherwise forms an orthonormal basis of formula_51
* Eigenfunctions of a Sturm–Liouville eigenproblem.
* The column vectors of an orthogonal matrix form an orthonormal set.

==Basic formula==

If formula_52 is an orthogonal basis of formula_8 then every element formula_54 may be written as
formula_55

When formula_52 is orthonormal, this simplifies to
formula_57
and the square of the norm of formula_58 can be given by
formula_59

Even if formula_52 is uncountable, only countably many terms in this sum will be non-zero, and the expression is therefore well-defined. This sum is also called the &quot;Fourier expansion&quot; of formula_61 and the formula is usually known as Parseval&#x27;s identity.

If formula_52 is an orthonormal basis of formula_8 then formula_9 is &quot;isomorphic&quot; to formula_65 in the following sense: there exists a bijective linear map formula_66 such that
formula_67

==Orthonormal system==

A set formula_68 of mutually orthonormal vectors in a Hilbert space formula_9 is called an orthonormal system. An orthonormal basis is an orthonormal system with the additional property that the linear span of formula_68 is dense in formula_9. Alternatively, the set formula_68 can be regarded as either &quot;complete&quot; or &quot;incomplete&quot; with respect to formula_9. That is, we can take the smallest closed linear subspace formula_74 containing formula_75 Then formula_68 will be an orthonormal basis of formula_77 which may of course be smaller than formula_9 itself, being an &quot;incomplete&quot; orthonormal set, or be formula_8 when it is a &quot;complete&quot; orthonormal set.

==Existence==

Using Zorn&#x27;s lemma and the Gram–Schmidt process (or more simply well-ordering and transfinite recursion), one can show that &quot;every&quot; Hilbert space admits an orthonormal basis; furthermore, any two orthonormal bases of the same space have the same cardinality (this can be proven in a manner akin to that of the proof of the usual dimension theorem for vector spaces, with separate cases depending on whether the larger basis candidate is countable or not). A Hilbert space is separable if and only if it admits a countable orthonormal basis. (One can prove this last statement without using the axiom of choice. However, one would have to use the axiom of countable choice.)

==Choice of basis as a choice of isomorphism==

For concreteness we discuss orthonormal bases for a real, formula_80-dimensional vector space formula_1 with a positive definite symmetric bilinear form formula_82. 

One way to view an orthonormal basis with respect to formula_83 is as a set of vectors formula_84, which allow us to write formula_85 , and formula_86 or formula_87. With respect to this basis, the components of formula_83 are particularly simple: formula_89 (where formula_90 is the Kronecker delta).

We can now view the basis as a map formula_91 which is an isomorphism of inner product spaces: to make this more explicit we can write
:formula_92
Explicitly we can write formula_93 where formula_94 is the dual basis element to formula_95.

The inverse is a component map
:formula_96
These definitions make it manifest that there is a bijection
:formula_97

The space of isomorphisms admits actions of orthogonal groups at either the formula_1 side or the formula_32 side. For concreteness we fix the isomorphisms to point in the direction formula_100, and consider the space of such maps, formula_101. 

This space admits a left action by the group of isometries of formula_1, that is, formula_103 such that formula_104, with the action given by composition: formula_105

This space also admits a right action by the group of isometries of formula_32, that is, formula_107, with the action again given by composition: formula_108.

==As a principal homogeneous space==
The set of orthonormal bases for formula_32 with the standard inner product is a principal homogeneous space or G-torsor for the orthogonal group formula_110 and is called the Stiefel manifold formula_111 of orthonormal formula_80-frames.

In other words, the space of orthonormal bases is like the orthogonal group, but without a choice of base point: given the space of orthonormal bases, there is no natural choice of orthonormal basis, but once one is given one, there is a one-to-one correspondence between bases and the orthogonal group.
Concretely, a linear map is determined by where it sends a given basis: just as an invertible map can take any basis to any other basis, an orthogonal map can take any &quot;orthogonal&quot; basis to any other &quot;orthogonal&quot; basis.

The other Stiefel manifolds formula_113 for formula_114 of &quot;incomplete&quot; orthonormal bases (orthonormal formula_115-frames) are still homogeneous spaces for the orthogonal group, but not &quot;principal&quot; homogeneous spaces: any formula_115-frame can be taken to any other formula_115-frame by an orthogonal map, but this map is not uniquely determined.

* The set of orthonormal bases for formula_118 is a G-torsor for formula_119.
* The set of orthonormal bases for formula_120 is a G-torsor for formula_121.
* The set of orthonormal bases for formula_122 is a G-torsor for formula_123.
* The set of right-handed orthonormal bases for formula_32 is a G-torsor for formula_125
