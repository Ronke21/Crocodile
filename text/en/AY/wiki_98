<text>Ngũgĩ wa Thiong&#x27;o (; born James Ngugi; 5 January 1938) is a Kenyan author and academic, who has been described as &quot;East Africa&#x27;s leading novelist&quot;. He began writing in English, switching to write primarily in Gikuyu. His work includes novels, plays, short stories, and essays, ranging from literary and social criticism to children&#x27;s literature. He is the founder and editor of the Gikuyu-language journal &quot;Mũtĩiri&quot;. His short story &quot;The Upright Revolution: Or Why Humans Walk Upright&quot; has been translated into 100 languages.

In 1977, Ngũgĩ embarked upon a novel form of theatre in Kenya that sought to liberate the theatrical process from what he held to be &quot;the general bourgeois education system&quot;, by encouraging spontaneity and audience participation in the performances. His project sought to &quot;demystify&quot; the theatrical process, and to avoid the &quot;process of alienation [that] produces a gallery of active stars and an undifferentiated mass of grateful admirers&quot; which, according to Ngũgĩ, encourages passivity in &quot;ordinary people&quot;. Although his landmark play &quot;Ngaahika Ndeenda&quot;, co-written with Ngũgĩ wa Mirii, was a commercial success, it was shut down by the authoritarian Kenyan regime six weeks after its opening.

Ngũgĩ was subsequently imprisoned for over a year. Adopted as an Amnesty International prisoner of conscience, the artist was released from prison, and fled Kenya. He was appointed Distinguished Professor of Comparative Literature and English at the University of California, Irvine. He previously taught at Northwestern University, Yale University, and New York University. Ngũgĩ has frequently been regarded as a likely candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature. He won the 2001 International Nonino Prize in Italy, and the 2016 Park Kyong-ni Prize. Among his children are authors Mũkoma wa Ngũgĩ and Wanjiku wa Ngũgĩ.

== Biography ==

===Early years and education===
Ngũgĩ was born in Kamiriithu, near Limuru in Kiambu district, Kenya, of Kikuyu descent, and baptised James Ngugi. His family was caught up in the Mau Mau Uprising; his half-brother Mwangi was actively involved in the Kenya Land and Freedom Army (in which he was killed), another brother was shot during the State of Emergency, and his mother was tortured at Kamiriithu home guard post.

He went to the Alliance High School, and went on to study at Makerere University College in Kampala, Uganda. As a student he attended the African Writers Conference held at Makerere in June 1962, and his play &quot;The Black Hermit&quot; premiered as part of the event at The National Theatre. At the conference Ngũgĩ asked Chinua Achebe to read the manuscripts of his novels &quot;The River Between&quot; and &quot;Weep Not, Child&quot;, which would subsequently be published in Heinemann&#x27;s African Writers Series, launched in London that year, with Achebe as its first advisory editor. Ngũgĩ received his B.A. in English from Makerere University College, Uganda, in 1963.

===First publications and studies in England===
His debut novel, &quot;Weep Not, Child&quot;, was published in May 1964, becoming the first novel in English to be published by a writer from East Africa.

Later that year, having won a scholarship to the University of Leeds to study for an MA, Ngũgĩ travelled to England, where he was when his second novel, &quot;The River Between&quot;, came out in 1965. &quot;The River Between&quot;, which has as its background the Mau Mau Uprising, and describes an unhappy romance between Christians and non-Christians, was previously on Kenya&#x27;s national secondary school syllabus. He left Leeds without completing his thesis on Caribbean literature, for which his studies had focused on George Lamming, about whom Ngũgĩ said in his 1972 collection of essays &quot;Homecoming&quot;: &quot;He evoked for me, an unforgettable picture of a peasant revolt in a white-dominated world. And suddenly I knew that a novel could be made to speak to me, could, with a compelling urgency, touch cords [sic] deep down in me. His world was not as strange to me as that of Fielding, Defoe, Smollett, Jane Austen, George Eliot, Dickens, D. H. Lawrence.&quot;

===Change of name, ideology and teaching===
Ngũgĩ&#x27;s 1967 novel &quot;A Grain of Wheat&quot; marked his embrace of Fanonist Marxism. He subsequently renounced writing in English, and the name James Ngugi as colonialist; by 1970 he had changed his name to Ngũgĩ wa Thiong&#x27;o, and began to write in his native Gikuyu. In 1967, Ngũgĩ also began teaching at the University of Nairobi as a professor of English literature. He continued to teach at the university for ten years while serving as a Fellow in Creative Writing at Makerere. During this time, he also guest lectured at Northwestern University in the department of English and African Studies for a year.

While a professor at the University of Nairobi, Ngũgĩ was the catalyst of the discussion to abolish the English department. He argued that after the end of colonialism, it was imperative that a university in Africa teach African literature, including oral literature, and that such should be done with the realization of the richness of African languages. In the late 60s, these efforts resulted in the university dropping English Literature as a course of study, and replacing it with one that positioned African Literature, oral and written, at the centre.

=== Imprisonment ===
In 1976, Thiong&#x27;o helped to establish The Kamiriithu Community Education and Cultural Centre which, among other things, organised African Theatre in the area. The following year saw the publication of &quot;Petals of Blood&quot;. Its strong political message, and that of his play &quot;Ngaahika Ndeenda&quot; (&quot;I Will Marry When I Want&quot;), co-written with Ngũgĩ wa Mirii and also published in 1977, provoked the then Kenyan Vice-President Daniel arap Moi to order his arrest. Along with copies of his play, books by Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, and Vladimir Lenin were confiscated. He was sent to Kamiti Maximum Security Prison, and kept there without a trial for nearly a year.

He was imprisoned in a cell with other political prisoners. During part of their imprisonment, they were allowed one hour of sunlight a day. Ngũgĩ writes &quot;The compound used to be for the mentally deranged convicts before it was put to better use as a cage for &#x27;the politically deranged.&quot; He found solace in writing and wrote the first modern novel in Gikuyu, &quot;Devil on the Cross&quot; (&quot;Caitaani mũtharaba-Inĩ&quot;), on prison-issued toilet paper.

After his release in December 1978, he was not reinstated to his job as professor at Nairobi University, and his family was harassed. Due to his writing about the injustices of the dictatorial government at the time, Ngũgĩ and his family were forced to live in exile. Only after Arap Moi, the longest-serving Kenyan president, retired in 2002, was it safe for them to return.

During his time in prison, Ngũgĩ decided to cease writing his plays and other works in English and began writing all his creative works in his native tongue, Gikuyu.

His time in prison also inspired the play &quot;The Trial of Dedan Kimathi&quot; (1976). He wrote this in collaboration with Micere Githae Mugo.

===Exile===
While in exile, Ngũgĩ worked with the London-based Committee for the Release of Political Prisoners in Kenya (1982–98). &quot;Matigari ma Njiruungi&quot; (translated by Wangui wa Goro into English as &quot;Matigari&quot;) was published at this time. In 1984, he was Visiting Professor at Bayreuth University, and the following year was Writer-in-Residence for the Borough of Islington in London. He also studied film at Dramatiska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden (1986).

His later works include &quot;Detained&quot;, his prison diary (1981), &quot;Decolonising the Mind: The Politics of Language in African Literature&quot; (1986), an essay arguing for African writers&#x27; expression in their native languages rather than European languages, in order to renounce lingering colonial ties and to build authentic African literature, and &quot;Matigari&quot; (translated by Wangui wa Goro), (1987), one of his most famous works, a satire based on a Gikuyu folk tale.

Ngũgĩ was Visiting Professor of English and Comparative Literature at Yale University between 1989 and 1992. In 1992, he was a guest at the Congress of South African Writers and spent time in Zwide Township with Mzi Mahola, the year he became a professor of Comparative Literature and Performance Studies at New York University, where he held the Erich Maria Remarque Chair. He is currently a Distinguished Professor of English and Comparative Literature as well as having been the first director of the International Center for Writing and Translation at the University of California, Irvine.

===21st century===

On 8 August 2004, Ngũgĩ returned to Kenya as part of a month-long tour of East Africa. On 11 August, robbers broke into his high-security apartment: they assaulted Ngũgĩ, sexually assaulted his wife and stole various items of value. When Ngũgĩ returned to America at the end of his month trip, five men were arrested on suspicion of the crime, including a nephew of Ngũgĩ. In the northern hemisphere summer of 2006 the American publishing firm Random House published his first new novel in nearly two decades, &quot;Wizard of the Crow&quot;, translated to English from Gikuyu by the author.

On 10 November 2006, while in San Francisco at Hotel Vitale at the Embarcadero, Ngũgĩ was harassed and ordered to leave the hotel by an employee. The event led to a public outcry and angered both African-Americans and members of the African diaspora living in America, which led to an apology by the hotel.

His later books include &quot;Globalectics: Theory and the Politics of Knowing&quot; (2012), and &quot;Something Torn and New: An African Renaissance&quot;, a collection of essays published in 2009 making the argument for the crucial role of African languages in &quot;the resurrection of African memory&quot;, about which &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; said: &quot;Ngugi&#x27;s language is fresh; the questions he raises are profound, the argument he makes is clear: &#x27;To starve or kill a language is to starve and kill a people&#x27;s memory bank. This was followed by two well-received autobiographical works: &quot;Dreams in a Time of War: a Childhood Memoir&quot; (2010) and &quot;In the House of the Interpreter: A Memoir&quot; (2012), which was described as &quot;brilliant and essential&quot; by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, among other positive reviews.

His book &quot;The Perfect Nine&quot;, originally written and published in Gikuyu as&quot; Kenda Muiyuru: Rugano Rwa Gikuyu na Mumbi&quot; (2019), was translated into English by Ngũgĩ for its 2020 publication, and is a reimagining in epic poetry of his people&#x27;s origin story. It was described by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; as &quot;a quest novel-in-verse that explores folklore, myth and allegory through a decidedly feminist and pan-African lens.&quot; The review in &quot;World Literature Today&quot; said: &quot;Ngũgĩ crafts a beautiful retelling of the Gĩkũyũ myth that emphasizes the noble pursuit of beauty, the necessity of personal courage, the importance of filial piety, and a sense of the Giver Supreme—a being who represents divinity, and unity, across world religions. All these things coalesce into dynamic verse to make &quot;The Perfect Nine&quot; a story of miracles and perseverance; a chronicle of modernity and myth; a meditation on beginnings and endings; and a palimpsest of ancient and contemporary memory, as Ngũgĩ overlays the Perfect Nine&#x27;s feminine power onto the origin myth of the Gĩkũyũ people of Kenya in a moving rendition of the epic form.&quot; Fiona Sampson writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot; concluded that it is &quot;a beautiful work of integration that not only refuses distinctions between &#x27;high art&#x27; and traditional storytelling, but supplies that all-too rare human necessity: the sense that life has meaning.&quot;

In March 2021, &quot;The Perfect Nine&quot; became the first work written in an indigenous African language to be longlisted for the International Booker Prize, with Ngũgĩ becoming the first nominee as both the author and translator of the book.

When asked in 2023 whether Kenyan English or Nigerian English were now local languages, Ngũgĩ wa Thiong&#x27;o responded: &quot;It&#x27;s like the enslaved being happy that theirs is a local version of enslavement. English is not an African language. French is not. Spanish is not. Kenyan or Nigerian English is nonsense. That&#x27;s an example of normalised abnormality. The colonised trying to claim the coloniser&#x27;s language is a sign of the success of enslavement.&quot;

== Family ==

Four of his children are also published authors: Tee Ngũgĩ, Mũkoma wa Ngũgĩ, Nducu wa Ngũgĩ, and Wanjiku wa Ngũgĩ.
In March 2024, Mũkoma posted on Twitter that his father had physically abused his mother, now deceased.

<doc id="198405" wikidata="Q7250797" url="?curid=198405" title="Prospect Park (Troy, New York)">
<text>Prospect Park is an city park in Troy, New York. The park is situated between Congress and Hill Street on top of Mount Ida. Prospect Park was originally designed in 1903 by local landscape engineer Garnet Douglass Baltimore, the first African-American graduate of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). He had also designed the 200-acre Forest Park Cemetery on Pinewood Avenue in Brunswick in 1897, which is now neglected and far from its picturesque days. The park started to fall into disrepair in the 1950s, and relatively little of Baltimore&#x27;s work is still evident in the park today.

The park today includes the following recreational areas: 14 tennis courts, four handball courts, two basketball courts, playground, picnic areas, soccer field, comfort station, spray pool, nature trail, a roadway which surrounds the park with eight parking areas, and finally Uncle Sam memorial pavilion which overlooks the city of Troy below. 

The Uncle Sam Memorial commemorates Samuel Wilson, who owned this land. It was an open gazebo overlooking the city and the Hudson River. Inside the gazebo were panels with patriotic words inscribed ~ Honesty, Justice, Republic, Independence, Freedom, and Faith. There are three empty places where panels had been. They either fell down or were stolen. It’s likely that Honor was one of them and maybe Patriotism and Loyalty was the other two.

== History ==
Troy&#x27;s Mount Ida is 285 feet above sea level with visibility up to 20 miles. The land for the park was originally under private ownership. The site, known originally as Warren Hill, was an estate owned by the heirs of the Warren family. The Warren family was a wealthy family known locally for financing the Church of the Holy Cross and the Warren Free Institute. The city of Troy purchased the Warren Hill site for $110,000 in March 1901 and established it as Warren Park. However, the local press and the Troy Common Council liked the name of Prospect Park, in inspiration of the Prospect Park in Brooklyn, New York.

Over the next few years, Garnet Baltimore implemented his designs, adding winding roads and four entrances to the park, fences, a man-made lake, a band shell, observation tower, tennis courts, and playgrounds. There were two mansions on the park dating back when the site was privately owned, called the Warren Mansion and the Vail House. The Warren Mansion was turned into a museum for military relics, and the Vail House turned into a refreshment stand called the “Casino”. In 1926, an above ground swimming pool designed by Wesley Bintz was added to the park. Today the pool is one of the few remaining “Bintz” swimming pools still standing.

Prospect Park remained a popular and well utilized park until the 1950s. In the 1950s Troy was facing the effects of population and employment decline from suburbanization and deindustrialization. In 1933, the Warren mansion was demolished under the Civil Works Administration. In 1943, the Casino was destroyed by fire. In 1994 the Bintz pool was closed due to needing costly repairs.

There are a multitude of rare species of trees to be seen throughout the park, including Catalpa, European Beech, Hawthorn, and Magnolias, adding to the overwhelming beauty of the 20 - mile radius view seen from the top of the park. The city of Troy originally planned for the park to be like that of the park in Brooklyn sharing its namesake, to bring a bit of city life from downstate to Troy. Newspapers wrote of the park, “Prospect Park is admirable alliterative and beautifully Brooklynish”, with Brooklyn even admiring and giving support to the park. Because of the great success from the press, the park was opened before fully completed, and then hired Baltimore to complete the project, seeing that he was the best man available for the job as a local graduate of Rensselaer and a Troy native.

In 1998, Friends of Prospect Park was organized by a group of Troy citizens to maintain and promote the public park. It is a nonprofit group responsible for improvements to the children&#x27;s playground, the sign welcoming patrons as they enter the park, renovations of bathrooms and comfort stations housed beneath the swimming pool, yearly bulb plantings, and many more. However, since then, Prospect Park has lost its popularity among the Troy community and has begun to deteriorate over the years. Today, the group organizes various environmental efforts to do park clean ups and clean ups of surrounding trails to revitalize the park to serve the purpose it was made for in the early 1900s when established. Working alongside the Troy Rehabilitation and Improvement Program, community outreach programs such as the Troy Hidden Garden Tour to bring low - and moderate – income families in Troy to community – building and promoting these communities to home ownership.

<doc id="198419" wikidata="Q6487495" url="?curid=198419" title="Lansingburgh Academy">
<text>The Lansingburgh Academy was a seminary in Lansingburgh, New York. The seminary was in existence from the late 18th century to 1900, when the building that housed it was leased to the Lansingburgh School District. The building was sold to the school district in 1911. Initially used as a high school, the Lansingburgh Academy was eventually sold to the local library system; , it served as the Lansingburgh Branch of the Troy Public Library. The Lansingburgh Academy was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.

==History==
On December 24, 1795, a group of prominent Lansingburgh residents petitioned the Regents of the State of New York for a charter, for the purpose of establishing a seminary of learning to be called The Lansingburgh Academy. They had erected a wooden building on the west side of the village green. This petition was signed by 27 persons. The charter was granted on February 20, 1796, and signed by John Jay. It contained the names of the first sixteen trustees.

The trustees selected as the first principal Rev. Chauncey Lee, a noted educator and the author of The American Accomptant. He invented the dollar sign and first used it in a textbook he had published in Lansingburgh.

By 1820, it was apparent that the first building was not large enough to serve the growing student body, so a second building of brick was built on the northwest corner of what is now known as Fourth Avenue and 114th Street (then called North Street). It remains almost unchanged in appearance today. The building was constructed on two lots transferred to the trustees of the Academy by a deed dated May 2, 1820.

In the new building with its expanded facilities, The Lansingburgh Academy flourished for the next eighty years. The Academy offered such an advanced program of study that students were able to enter college as sophomores after graduating.

Many famous people were connected to the Academy. Rev. Dr. Samuel Blatchford, an early president, was later the president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. He was the author of a noted Greek grammar, used at the Academy and in many colleges. Ebenezer D. Maltbie was in charge of the Academy when author Herman Melville graduated with a degree in surveying and engineering. Maltbie was the author of a popular book on zoology. Chester A. Arthur, future President of the United States, taught a course in &#x27;Elements of Law&#x27; when he resided in Lansingburgh.

In 1900 (the year Lansingburgh was annexed by the city of Troy), the trustees of the Academy leased the building with its equipment and a fine library for a period of ten years to the Lansingburgh Free School District No. 1, to be used as a high school. During this time, a 2,500 square foot (230 m2) addition was built on the back of the building. On May 27, 1911, the lease expired and the trustees sold the Academy building to the Lansingburgh School District. The district used it as a high school and later as a vocational school. It was used for elementary classes until 1975.

In 1975, the Lansingburgh Citizen&#x27;s Council was given full access to the building by the school district. The Council soon put together a proposal for the rehabilitation and restoration of the old Lansingburgh Academy so it could be used as an expanded branch of the Troy Public Library, and as a neighborhood arts center. In 1976, the building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Also in 1976, the council, under the auspices of the City of Troy, was awarded a $350,000 grant for this project. Work included a new roof, complete interior and exterior painting, new doors, a handicapped access ramp, new heating and air conditioning systems and extensive interior construction work. The project was completed in 1980 and, after a brief stay at the Methodist Church, the library reopened in its new quarters.

==Lansingburgh Branch of the Troy Public Library==
In 1938, the Lansingburgh Board of Education voted to give use of a small room in the former Lansingburgh Academy for a branch of the Troy Public Library, and to furnish the necessary heat, light and custodial service. The branch library opened on June 15, 1939, in a room on the second floor. After only five months, the collection had doubled in size and the library had to expand, so it moved from the second floor of the school to the first. In 1952, the library was moved from the two front rooms to the rear of the building with the entrance on Fourth Avenue. In 1999, the Troy Public Library purchased the Lansingburgh Academy building from the Lansingburgh School District. In 2002, renovations were completed that nearly doubled the size of the branch.

<doc id="198420" wikidata="Q496803" url="?curid=198420" title="USS Gato (SSN-615)">
<text> was a &quot;Thresher/Permit&quot;-class nuclear submarine known as the &quot;Goal Keeper&quot; or the &quot;Black Cat.&quot; She was the second United States Navy ship named after the gato, a species of small catshark found in waters along the west coast of Mexico.

The contract to build her was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation on 9 July 1960 and her keel was laid down on 15 December 1961 at Groton, Connecticut. She was launched 14 May 1964 sponsored by Mrs. Lawson P. Ramage, and was commissioned 25 January 1968 under the command of CDR Albert Baciocco.
On 15 November 1969, &quot;Gato&quot; collided with the Soviet submarine &quot;K-19&quot; in the Barents Sea at a depth of some . The impact completely destroyed the &quot;K-19&quot;″s bow sonar systems and mangled the covers of its forward torpedo tubes. &quot;K-19&quot; returned to port for repair but the &quot;Gato&quot; was relatively undamaged and continued her patrol.
She was the first nuclear-powered submarine to completely circumnavigate South America, and the first nuclear-powered submarine to navigate the Strait of Magellan during its 1976 Unitas run under the command of CDR Robert Partlow. It was on this voyage that it became the first nuclear submarine to travel through the Panama Canal.

&quot;Gato&quot; was decommissioned and stricken on 25 April 1996 and disposed of by submarine recycling.

<text>USS &quot;Gato&quot; (SS-212) was the lead ship of her class of submarine in the United States Navy. She was the first Navy ship named for the common name used for a number of species of catshark. She was commissioned only days after the declaration of war and made thirteen combat patrols during World War II. She survived the war and spent the post-war period as a training ship before being sold for scrapping in 1960.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Gato&quot;′s keel was laid down 5 October 1940 by the Electric Boat Company of Groton, Connecticut. She was launched 21 August 1941, sponsored by Mrs. Louise Ingersoll, wife of Admiral Royal E. Ingersoll, and commissioned 31 December 1941.

== January – April 1942 ==

After shakedown at New London, Connecticut, &quot;Gato&quot; departed 16 February 1942 via the Panama Canal for San Francisco, California, where she underwent additional training. She was at periscope depth while conducting a trim dive in the Pacific Ocean off the entrance to San Francisco Bay on 23 March 1942 when the U.S. Navy TC-class blimp &quot;TC-13&quot; mistook her for a Japanese submarine and attacked her with four depth charges. The first two depth charges landed within of her periscope and the second pair exploded as she dived to a depth of . She suffered extensive damage but no casualties. It was the only friendly fire incident between a U.S. Navy blimp and a submarine during World War II.

After repairs at Mare Island Navy Yard in California, &quot;Gato&quot; was ready for sea again on 27 March 1942. She subsequently proceeded to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.

== First war patrol, April – June 1942 ==
On her first war patrol from Pearl Harbor (20 April – 10 June 1942), &quot;Gato&quot; unsuccessfully attacked a converted aircraft carrier 3 May before being driven away by the fierce depth charging of four destroyers off the Marshall Islands. On 24 May 1942 she was ordered to patrol the western approaches to Midway Atoll in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, taking station westward during the Battle of Midway of 3–7 June 1942.

== Second and third war patrols, July – December 1942 ==

On her second war patrol (2 July – 29 August 1942), she patrolled east of the Kurile Islands toward the Aleutian chain. She obtained four torpedo hits with unconfirmed damage to a ship 15 August 1942, and terminated her patrol at Dutch Harbor, Alaska. Her third patrol (4 September – 23 December 1942) included operations off Kiska; then she steamed &quot;via&quot; Midway and Pearl Harbor to Truk atoll, where her attack 6 December on a convoy was broken off by aerial bombs and a severe depth charge attack by three destroyers. This patrol terminated at Brisbane, Australia, 23 December 1942.

== Fourth and fifth war patrols, January – June 1943 ==

During her fourth war patrol (13 January 1943 – 26 February 1943), &quot;Gato&quot; torpedoed and sank transport &quot;Kenkon Maru&quot; 21 January; cargo ship &quot;Nichiun Maru&quot; on 29 January; and cargo ship &quot;Suruya Maru&quot; on 15 February—all off New Georgia, Solomon Islands. On her fifth war patrol (19 March – 6 June 1943), she landed an Australian intelligence party at Toep, Bougainville, 29 March 1943, and evacuated 27 children, nine mothers, and three nuns, transferring them on 31 March to the submarine chaser &quot;SC-531&quot; off Ramos, Florida Island. During a submerged radar attack approach 4 April 1943, between Tanga and Lihir Islands, she was shaken so violently by three exploding depth charges that she returned to Brisbane for temporary repairs 11 to 20 April. &quot;Gato&quot; landed more Australian commandos at Toep Harbor 29 May, transported more evacuees to Ramos Island, and then reconnoitered off Tarawa in the Gilbert Islands before putting in at Pearl Harbor 6 June 1943.

== Sixth and seventh war patrols, August 1943 – January 1944 ==

&quot;Gato&quot; was overhauled at Mare Island; returned to Pearl Harbor 22 August 1943; and conducted her sixth war patrol (6 September – 28 October) via Truk and Bougainville in the Solomons to Brisbane. &quot;En route&quot; on 19 October she attacked a convoy, scoring hits for unknown damage to two large cargo ships. Her seventh war patrol (18 November 1943 – 10 January 1944) took her north of the Bismarck Archipelago. On 30 November she made a coordinated attack with , sinking the cargo ship &quot;Columbia Maru&quot;. She rescued a Japanese soldier from a life raft on 16 December, then attacked a convoy in the Saipan-Massau traffic lanes four days later to sink cargo ship &quot;Tsuneshima Maru&quot; and scored damaging hits on another freighter. After two hours of dodging depth charges, she finally evaded her attackers, surfaced, and headed for Tingmon, the most likely port for the damaged cargo ship. &quot;Gato&quot; discovered a live depth charge on her deck at the same time two enemy escorts were sighted headed in her direction. She outran them while disposing of the depth charge by setting it adrift on a rubber raft. Although she did not overtake the cargo ship, she did sight a convoy. On 2 December her chase was foiled by a float plane, which was driven off by &quot;Gato&quot;&#x27;s gunners. She concluded the patrol at Milne Bay, New Guinea, 10 January 1944.

== Eighth, ninth and tenth war patrols, February – September 1944 ==

&quot;Gato&quot; departed Milne Bay 2 February 1944 for her eighth war patrol, in the Bismarck-New Guinea-Truk area. She rescued Fred Hargesheimer and two other downed airmen on 5 February. She sank a trawler off Truk on 15 February, transport &quot;Daigen Maru No.3&quot; on 26 February, and cargo ship &quot;Okinoyama Maru No.3&quot; on 12 March. Two other trawlers were destroyed by her guns before she returned to Pearl Harbor on 1 April 1944.

On her ninth war patrol (30 May 1944 – 2 June 1944) &quot;Gato&quot; took Vice Admiral Charles A. Lockwood to Midway; completed photographic reconnaissance of Woleai Island, served on lifeguard station for air strikes on Truk 11 to 18 June, and terminated her patrol at Majuro atoll. Her 10th war patrol saw her on lifeguard 15 July 1944 for the carrier air strike on Chichi Jima, during which she rescued two aviators. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 2 September 1944, proceeded to Mare Island for overhaul and then returned to Pearl Harbor.

== Eleventh and twelfth war patrols, January – June 1945 ==

On her 11th war patrol (28 January – 13 March 1945), &quot;Gato&quot; patrolled the Yellow Sea as a unit of a coordinated attack group (called a &quot;wolf pack&quot;), with and . She sank a coast defense ship on 14 February and cargo ship &quot;Tairiku Maru&quot; on 21 February, then returned to Guam. She departed on her 12th war patrol 12 April 1945, taking lifeguard station in support of the invasion of Okinawa. On the night of 22 – 23 April she had a brief contest with two Japanese submarines and narrowly missed destruction as well-aimed torpedoes came close. Between 27 and 30 April she rescued 10 Army aviators from shallow water near the beaches of Cape Toi Misaki, Kyūshū. She returned to Pearl Harbor 3 June 1945.

== Thirteenth war patrol and end of war==

&quot;Gato&quot; departed on her 13th and last war patrol on 8 July for lifeguard station duty, then to support air strikes on Wake Island, and then patrolled off the eastern coast of Honshū. She received word of the &quot;Cease Fire&quot; on 15 August while making an attack approach on a sea truck. She steamed into Tokyo Bay 31 August and remained for the signing of surrender documents on board on 2 September.

==Post-World War II==
&quot;Gato&quot; departed Tokyo Bay on 3 September 1945 and proceeded via Pearl Harbor and the Panama Canal to the New York Naval Shipyard in Brooklyn, New York, where she was decommissioned on 16 March 1946. She served for a number of years as a United States Naval Reserve training vessel at New York City and later at Baltimore, Maryland, until she was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 March 1960. She was sold to the Northern Metals Company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 25 July 1960 for scrapping.

<text>Yosemite Sam ( ) is a cartoon character in the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series of short films produced by Warner Bros. His name is taken from Yosemite National Park in California. His real name is &quot;Aloysius Bartholamew Sam&quot;. He is an adversary of Bugs Bunny and his archenemy alongside Elmer Fudd. He is commonly depicted as a mean-spirited and extremely aggressive, gunslinging outlaw or cowboy with a hair-trigger temper and an intense hatred of rabbits, Bugs in particular. In cartoons with non-Western themes, he uses various aliases, including &quot;Chilkoot Sam&quot; (named for the Chilkoot Trail; Sam pronounces it &quot;Chilli-koot&quot;) and &quot;Square-deal Sam&quot; in &quot;14 Carrot Rabbit&quot;, &quot;Riff Raff Sam&quot; in &quot;Sahara Hare&quot;, &quot;Sam Schultz&quot; in &quot;Big House Bunny&quot;, &quot;Seagoin&#x27; Sam&quot; in &quot;Buccaneer Bunny&quot;, &quot;Shanghai Sam&quot; in &quot;Mutiny on the Bunny&quot;, &quot;Von Schamm the Hessian&quot; in &quot;Bunker Hill Bunny&quot;, &quot;Baron Sam von Schpamm&quot; in &quot;Dumb Patrol&quot;,&quot;Pancho Vanilla&quot; in &quot;Pancho&#x27;s Hideaway&quot; and many others. During the golden age of American animation, Yosemite Sam appeared as antagonist in 33 animated shorts made between 1945 and 1964.

== History ==

Animator Friz Freleng introduced the villain character in the 1945 cartoon &quot;Hare Trigger&quot;. With his grumpy demeanor, fiery temper, strident voice, and short stature (in two early gags in &quot;Hare Trigger&quot;, a train he is attempting to rob passes right over top of him and he has to use a set of portable stairs to get on his horse; in &quot;Bugs Bunny Rides Again&quot;, he rides a miniature horse), along with his fiery red hair, Sam was in some ways a caricature of Freleng. While he often denied any intentional resemblance, in the &quot;Looney Tunes Golden Collection&quot;, surviving members of his production crew assert, and the director&#x27;s daughter acknowledges, that Sam definitely was inspired by Freleng. Freleng himself even said in an interview with the Associated Press that &quot;I have the same temperament, I&#x27;m small, and I used to have a red mustache.&quot; Other influences were the Red Skelton character Sheriff Deadeye and the Tex Avery cartoon &quot;Dangerous Dan McFoo&quot;. When he does a &quot;slow burn&quot; and cries &quot;Oooooh!&quot; he borrows a bit from such comedic character actors as Jimmy Finlayson (a frequent foil to Laurel and Hardy) and Frank Nelson (one of Mel Blanc&#x27;s costars on &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot;). Freleng also cited the Terrible-Tempered Mr. Bang, a character in the &quot;Toonerville Trolley&quot; comic strip, as an influence. In his memoir &quot;Chuck Amuck: The Life and Times of an Animated Cartoonist&quot;, Chuck Jones says that a great-uncle who occasionally visited his family was a retired Texas Ranger who was short, had red hair, a large mustache, and a hair-trigger temper (but no beard, unlike Sam). Michael Maltese originally considered calling the character Texas Tiny, Wyoming Willie, or Denver Dan, but then settled on the final name.
Other characters with Sam-like features appear in several &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; shorts. The Bugs Bunny entry &quot;Super-Rabbit&quot; (1943) features the cowboy character &quot;Cottontail Smith&quot;, whose voice is similar to Sam&#x27;s. &quot;Stage Door Cartoon&quot; (1944), however, features a southern sheriff character that looks and sounds similar to Sam, except for a more defined Southern stereotype to his voice. In a Daffy Duck cartoon called &quot;Along Came Daffy&quot; (1947), Daffy has to contend with &quot;two&quot; Yosemite Sams, one with Sam&#x27;s red hair and one with black hair. Finally, &quot;Pancho&#x27;s Hideaway&quot; (1964) features a Mexican villain who is designed much like Sam but has a different accent. In addition, in the 1949 Chuck Jones-directed cartoon &quot;Mississippi Hare&quot;, Bugs Bunny battles with an old, pistol-toting gambler called Colonel Shuffle, one whose role could have easily been portrayed by Sam.

Freleng created Yosemite Sam to be a more formidable adversary for Bugs Bunny. Until then, Bugs&#x27; major foe had been Elmer Fudd, a man so mild-mannered and good-natured that Freleng thought Bugs actually came off as a bully by duping him. Sam, on the other hand, was extremely violent and belligerent, not at all a pushover like Fudd. Freleng compacted into a tiny body and 11-gallon hat the largest voice and the largest ego &quot;north, south, east, aaaaand west of the Pecos&quot;.

For over 19 years, except for one cartoon (&quot;Hare-Abian Nights&quot; in 1959) Freleng&#x27;s unit had exclusive usage of Sam at the Warner studio. Though officially a cowboy, Freleng put Sam in a different costume in almost every film: a knight, a Roman legionary, a pirate, a royal cook, a prison guard, a duke (Duke of Yosemite, no less), a Hessian mercenary, a Confederate soldier, a mountain climber (climbing the &#x27;Shmadderhorn&#x27; mountain in Switzerland), a hen-pecked house husband and even a space alien. The humor of the cartoons inevitably springs from the odd miscasting of the hot-tempered cowboy. However, some countries seem to prefer his pirate incarnation, as &quot;Sam the Pirate&quot; is his official name in France and a frequent alternative name in Italy.

While Sam&#x27;s basic character is that of a cowboy, he usually wears a black Domino mask (or just a wide black outline on the outer sides of his eyes) to show that he is an outlaw. This is so associated with his persona that he wears the mask even when dressed as a duke, a riff, a pirate, or a Viking.

Sam is significantly tougher and more aggressive than Elmer Fudd when challenging Bugs Bunny. He is also quicker to learn from his mistakes and rarely falls for the same ploy twice. But despite Sam&#x27;s bluster, he does not prove much brighter than Elmer in his encounters with Bugs. His noise contrasts to the calmly cocky rabbit. Sam&#x27;s own cockiness always gets the best of him; Bugs can see he is incapable of turning down a challenge. Every time Bugs dares Sam to &quot;step across that line&quot;, he cannot help but do so, even if he steps off into empty space or down a mine shaft.

Yosemite Sam was depicted without six-gun pistols in &quot;Looney Tunes Cartoons&quot; on the streaming service, HBO Max. The series&#x27; executive producer and showrunner, Peter Browngardt, said the character could still continue to use cartoon violence, such as dynamite and Acme-related paraphernalia.
However, this change appears to have been reversed, as he is once again depicted using his pistols in &quot;Space Jam: A New Legacy&quot; (2021).

=== Personality ===
Sam is one of Bugs&#x27; toughest antagonists, proudly calling himself the meanest, toughest hombre in the West. Sam is a character more aggressive than Bugs&#x27; other regular antagonist, Elmer Fudd, given that Sam has a tougher accent; a higher, fiercer voice; and a more violent spirit, although he is portrayed as a bumbling fool in most of his appearances. Sam has had several occupations in his life that Bugs has gotten in the way of. Among his occupations are:

* Confederate Army soldier: In &quot;Southern Fried Rabbit&quot;, Sam is a Confederate soldier who attempts to prevent Bugs from crossing the Mason–Dixon line, although the cartoon takes place long after the American Civil War. Bugs tells Sam the war ended almost 90 years ago, but Sam insists, &quot;I&#x27;m no clock-watcher!&quot; and refuses to leave his post unless he receives orders from Robert E. Lee. This gag may have been inspired by the actual discovery of Japanese soldiers still manning their posts, long after World War II had ended.
* Prison guard: In &quot;Big House Bunny&quot;, Sam (known here as Sam Schulz) arrests and imprisons Bugs for a false accusation (escaping prison) and gives him 99 years in jail. However, he gets infuriated and lets Bugs out of prison after Bugs annoys him including briefly getting Sam beaten up and locked up in jail himself. However, when letting Bugs out, he is jailed by the Warden (who gets infuriated with the antics that cause Bugs to get Sam in trouble with him) for Bugs&#x27; doings and for letting a prisoner (Bugs) escape. Sam then vows to get even with the stool pigeon who squealed on him. It then cuts to Bugs on a stool making the sounds of a pigeon.
* Pirate: In &quot;Buccaneer Bunny&quot;, Sam is known as &quot;Sea-Goin&#x27; Sam&quot;, who is trying to bury his treasure, only for Bugs to foil his attempt. In &quot;Captain Hareblower&quot;, Sam is a pirate captain who is able to intimidate and scare sailors and other pirates. Sam encounters a trading ship led by Bugs and decides to take it for himself. With all of Bugs&#x27; fellow sailors too cowardly to face Sam or have drowned in the ocean, Bugs challenges Sam to a fight. Sam and Bugs battle each other&#x27;s ships with Bugs on the verge of winning. The battle ends up with Sam being forced to abandon ship to escape an inevitable explosion on his own pirate ship. Sam then unknowingly triumphs over Bugs by lighting Bugs&#x27; &quot;powder room&quot; (filled with make-up, not gunpowder) into exploding and escaping by himself, but not before giving a warning for Bugs to get the match (an order Bugs does not follow, believing that &quot;Talcum powder doesn&#x27;t explode.&quot;). And in &quot;From Hare to Eternity&quot;, Sam, a.k.a. &quot;Buccaneer Sam&quot;, tries to find treasure, only to find Bugs protecting it.
* Riff-Raffer/Cowboy: In &quot;Sahara Hare&quot;, Sam is a proud intimidating North African version of a cowboy: a Riff-Raffer who owns the Sahara Desert. When Bugs ends up in the desert when trying to find Miami Beach, he sees the rabbit trespassing and chases him into a deserted castle. Sam sees Bugs using the castle for protection and tries several unsuccessful attempts at breaking into the castle, eventually ending with Bugs escaping after causing a booby trap that Sam falls for: an armed bomb-coated door that will explode if Sam opens the door to the castle.
* Guard Captain: In &quot;Roman Legion-Hare&quot;, Sam is the captain of the Roman Imperial Guard, and he is ordered by Grand Emperor Nero to find a victim for the lions at once, or else he will be their prey. He then heads out to look for a victim with a small band of imperial guards when Bugs shows up. When asked if it was a convention of the legion, Sam replies he&#x27;s looking for victims to feed the lions and is shocked to learn that no other victimssave Bugsare present. He then chases the crafty cottontail into the Colosseum, where the lions await. Try as he might to keep the big cats quiet, they always tear his golden armor to shreds or ruffle the fuzz on his helmet. And when he does present Bugs to Nero, the lions surge directly toward them, leaving Bugs unscathed.
* Viking: In &quot;Prince Violent&quot;, Sam is a Viking grunt who attempts to raid the archduchy castle, which happens to be under Bugs&#x27;s protection. Bugs teasingly tells him that it&#x27;s too early for Halloween and then kicks Sam out of the castle. He even hires an Asian elephant to first ram what Sam thinks to be a door, but it is really a painting imitating a door, so the elephant is reduced to the shape of an accordion - before smashing his master into the same shape. Next, the elephant tries to demolish the castle walls with large boulders, but Bugs still remains persistent in defending the castle by sprinkling pepper over the elephant&#x27;s trunk, which causes the pachyderm to sneeze and launch a bolder into Sam. Next, Bugs signals for the bridge to lower, at which point, the elephant charges onto it with Sam riding, but the elephant&#x27;s weight proves to be too much for the bridge. Next, he suggests attacking the castle from the rear, but Bugs (defensive as always) cleverly places a champagne cork in the elephant&#x27;s trunk, causing him to swim back to land in his struggle to breathe, leaving Sam in the water. This drives Sam to permanently evict the elephant, chasing him away: &quot;AND DON&#x27;T COME BACK!!!!! I&#x27;ll handle that Prince Varmint myself!&quot;. His attempts to raid the castle are cut short when the same elephant joins Bugs in kicking him out of the kingdom for good.
* Indian Chief: In &quot;Horse Hare&quot;, Sam is the chief of an Indian tribe during the Indian-American wars in 1886. One day, Sam sees a USA fort and decides to steal it for his tribe. He sees that Sergeant Bugs Bunny is guarding the fort and challenges him to war. Chief Sam has his men attack through various means such as launching himself into the fort, firing guns, etcetera, but Sam is put on probation when he is accused of firing at one of his soldiers (it was actually Bugs). Eventually, the USA cavalry returns, and it helps Bugs defeat Sam and his army of Indians.
* Hessian soldier in the American Revolutionary War: In &quot;Bunker Hill Bunny&quot;, Sam is Sam von Schamm, a German soldier defending a fort who attacks Bugs&#x27;s fort. After being defeated, he concedes &quot;I&#x27;m a Hessian without no aggression.&quot;
* German pilot: In &quot;Dumb Patrol&quot;, Sam is Baron Sam Von Schpamm, a World War I German Air Force pilot who tries to shoot down Bugs, but who fails and ends up as a Hell&#x27;s Angel.
* Duke: In &quot;From Hare to Heir&quot;, Sam is the Duke of Yosemite. Bugs arrives at Sam&#x27;s door with the promise to give him a million pounds if Sam keeps his temper. Bugs makes requests, annoys Sam at night, and stays in the bathroom in the morning, prompting Sam to lose his temper and shout unintelligible gibberish, cutting pounds off the offer in the process. When Sam comes up to Bugs saying that he does not get mad anymore, and has his assistants kick him in the rear end, throw a pie in his face and hit him on the head with a rolling pin to prove this, Bugs says &quot;I haven&#x27;t got the heart to tell him he&#x27;s used up all the money.&quot;
* Legendary Mountain climber: A legendary mountain climber in &quot;Piker&#x27;s Peak&quot;, Sam hears of a contest where whoever hikes up and reaches the deadly highest mountain in the world, will receive money equaled to trillions of dollars in today&#x27;s money; 50,000 Cronkites (named after television host Walter Cronkite). (&quot;Cronkite&quot; is also a jest on &quot;Klondike&quot;, the location of a great Gold Rush.) Sam takes up the contest, and he decides to climb up the mountain which is based on Pike&#x27;s Peak. However, when he reaches the basecamp at thousands of feet, he encounters Bugs, who also hears about the contest. With both of them wanting the prize, Sam then must race and defeat Bugs along the way up to Piker&#x27;s Peak to get the money.
* Cowboy: In &quot;Wild and Woolly Hare&quot;, Sam is a legendary cowboy gangster who dominates much of the wild west through intimidation. One day, he comes to take over a cafe in an Old Western town and is insulted by Bugs. Angered by the insult, Sam challenges Bugs to a fight to the death. With Bugs on the verge of winning through trickery and deception, Sam decides to try one last time to intimidate the town; to rob a train. But Bugs hijacks the train to save it. Sam tries to follow it by horse and orders Bugs to get off by the time he counts to a specific number. However, just before he reaches his final number, he always runs into some form of large obstacle, like a telephone pole or a tunnel wall and then falls off a bridge. A frustrated Sam tries to get on another train and force Bugs to surrender by preparing to ram head-on into Bugs&#x27; train. However, Bugs foils him by switching the railroad tracks causing Sam&#x27;s train engine to crash hundreds of feet into a gorge&#x27;s river.
* Alien: In &quot;Lighter Than Hare&quot;, Sam of Outer Space is an alien from a foreign planet. Inside a flying saucer spaceship, Sam reveals his mission to find an earth creature to take back to his planet for uses such as slaves, producing on their planet Etcetera. Sam detects Bugs and sends his army of robots to attack Bugs&#x27; hideout. After a long struggle, Sam&#x27;s robots are blown to pieces. Finally, an exasperated Sam uses an incinerating laser cannon to threaten Bugs into surrendering and boarding his space ship. Sam then flies out of earth to his planet, unaware that he has actually captured a decoy of Bugs filled with bombs. When Sam presents the dummy to his leader, the bombs explode.
* Sailor: In &quot;Rabbitson Crusoe&quot;, Sam is a sailor whose boat is irreparably damaged, and lives as a castaway. (&quot;A low tide and a high rock caused my predicament.&quot;) Sam jumps across rocks to a deserted island and spends many years there being targeted as a meal by a shark named Dopey Dick. After some time, Sam grows tired of eating coconuts and finds Bugs. He decides to cook up Bugs for dinner. After a long battle, eventually, the island is reclaimed by the seas and Sam ends up being chased by Dopey Dick. Sam is then forced to make a deal with Bugs where Bugs will not let Dopey Dick eat Sam and take Sam in his boat (the cooking pot) back to civilization ... but only if Sam is the one that does all the work in paddling 2,736 miles to San Francisco, California.
* Chef: In &quot;Shishkabugs&quot;, Sam has one of his rare performances where his goal is not for evil purposes and where he is not the aggressor. In this episode, Sam is a very kind, generous chef for a very rude, spoiled king who has Sam enslaved through blackmail. One day, Sam makes the king a usual buffet only for the King to rudely kick it away and demand something new. &quot;Every day, it&#x27;s the same thing: &quot;variety&quot;!&quot; he complains. &quot;I want something different!&quot; That something new is Hasenpfeffer whose base is cooked rabbit. Sam captures Bugs and puts Bugs in the meal, but Bugs outsmarts Sam twice and the King blames it all on Sam. Eventually, the King loses his patience and has guards arrest Sam and installs Bugs as his new chef. The King claims to have set up Sam&#x27;s death. But since Sam is seen alive in more episodes, it is presumed that either he was found not guilty by the kingdom court, the citizens demanded Sam&#x27;s release, or Sam escaped.
* Knight: In &quot;Knighty Knight Bugs&quot;, Sam is the Black Knight and has stolen the Singing Sword. King Arthur hires court jester Bugs to retrieve the sword. After retrieving it, Bugs escapes Sam and manages to lock Sam out of his castle. Sam attempts to break back in, but each attempt backfires. Eventually, Bugs leads Sam and his fire-breathing dragon into the dynamite storage facility. The dragon sneezes, blowing the two of them to the moon.
* Trolley conductor: In &quot;Tweety&#x27;s High-Flying Adventure&quot;, Sam drives a trolley in San Francisco. The trolley is hijacked by Sylvester, who is hoping to use it to chase Tweety. Instead, he breaks the throttle which is used as a brake, rendering the trolley out of control. It speeds all over San Francisco, ending up on Alcatraz. During this, Sam attests to Sylvester&#x27;s idiocy, eventually chasing Sylvester all over Alcatraz with his hat. He also chases Sylvester on a train to Las Vegas, only to be locked on another train heading out of the city.

== Later years ==
Yosemite Sam made appearances in several television specials in the 1970s and 1980s, and in three of the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; feature-film compilations. Sam was the star of his own comic book series from 1970 to 1984, for a total of 81 issues. Published by Gold Key / Whitman Comics, the official title of the series was &quot;Yosemite Sam and Bugs Bunny&quot;. Yosemite Sam was the main basis for the character of The Grump from DePatie-Freleng Enterprises&#x27;s TV series &quot;Here Comes the Grump&quot;. The Grump&#x27;s dragon was similar to Sam&#x27;s in &quot;Knighty Knight Bugs&quot;, right down to the fiery nasal explosions upon its master. He also made a cameo appearance in Disney/Amblin&#x27;s &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, where he is blasted out of Toontown. In the film, he is the only Looney Tunes character to not be voiced by Mel Blanc, with Joe Alaskey taking the role.

Yosemite Sam was one of the classic Looney Tunes characters who appeared as faculty members of Acme Looniversity in the 1990s animated series &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot;. Sam was shown teaching classes in Firearms and Anvilology (the study of falling anvils, a staple joke in the Looney Tunes genre), and was sometimes portrayed as the school principal (though at least one episode identified Bugs Bunny as the principal, and Wile E. Coyote was Dean of Acme Loo). As with all the main Looney Tunes characters, Sam had a student counterpart at Acme Loo in Montana Max. In &quot;K-Acme TV&quot;, Yosemite Sam was seen as the judge of &quot;Toon Court&quot; (a parody of &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot;) where he proceeded over a trial where Calamity Coyote issues a complaint against the ACME Corporation for negligence and faulty workmanship. The ACME Corporation&#x27;s representative Bobbo ACME claims that the devices made by the ACME Corporation work if they are used right as he demonstrates the catapult on Calamity Coyote. Judge Yosemite Sam finds in favor of the ACME Corporation. In the same episode, Yosemite Sam appeared as a prospector in a documentary detailing about the sightings of a furry creature called Bigbutt (a spoof of Bigfoot).

Yosemite Sam also appeared along with Bugs Bunny in a number of Mirinda commercials in the early 90s, due to direct competition to Fanta, being advertised with Disney characters at that time.

He also appears in the movie &quot;Space Jam&quot; as a player for the Tune Squad. In a memorable scene, he and Elmer Fudd shoot off the teeth of one of the Monstars while clad in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;-esque attire, complete with Dick Dale&#x27;s &quot;Misirlou&quot; playing. In an earlier scene, when the Nerdlucks hold all the toons hostage, he confronts the Nerdlucks, pointing his pistols at them, and orders them to release all the toons ... only to have the lead Nerdluck fire a laser pistol back at him, which leaves Sam smoldering naked and beardless as the phasers burned off his mustache.

Sam also appeared in &quot;The Warners 65th Anniversary Special&quot; and two episodes of 1995&#x27;s &quot;The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries&quot;.

In the 2003 movie &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot;, Yosemite Sam is a bounty hunter employed by the Acme Corporation who was hired to finish off DJ Drake and Daffy Duck. In this film, he owns a casino in Las Vegas, which he calls Yosemite Sam&#x27;s Wooden Nickel, and is accompanied by Nasty Canasta and Cottontail Smith from &quot;Super-Rabbit&quot; (who may be originally employed as his security guards). He goes as far as betting a large sack of money to get the card, stealing Jeff Gordon&#x27;s car, and even using a stick of Dynamite to beat DJ and Daffy.

In 2004, a possible numbers station in Albuquerque using the character&#x27;s voice began transmitting, taking a piece of audio from the 1950 &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoon &quot;Bunker Hill Bunny&quot;, days after it was discovered and its location was tracked, the station ceased broadcasting but returned for a short time again in 2005, but hasn&#x27;t been heard since. This was referred to as the &quot;Yosemite Sam transmission.&quot; This was also believed to have a reference to the &quot;Bugs Bunny&quot; quote &quot;I knew I should have taken that left turn at Albuquerque.&quot;

Sam also plays the role of minor villain K&#x27;Chutha Sa&#x27;am (a parody of the Klingon) in the &quot;Duck Dodgers&quot; animated TV series.

His descendant appears in &quot;Loonatics Unleashed&quot;, where he allied with Duece to trick Ace into giving him his sword.

He also appears in the video games &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle&quot;, &quot;The Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle 2&quot;, &quot;Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle 3&quot;, &quot;The Bugs Bunny Birthday Blowout&quot;, &quot;Bugs Bunny: Rabbit Rampage&quot;, &quot;Bugs Bunny in Double Trouble&quot;, &quot;Bugs Bunny: Lost in Time&quot;, &quot;Bugs Bunny and Taz: Time Busters&quot;, &quot;Sheep, Dog, &#x27;n&#x27; Wolf&quot;, &quot;Looney Tunes B-Ball&quot;, &quot;Daffy Duck in Hollywood&quot; and the &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot; video game. In &quot;Looney Tunes: Acme Arsenal&quot;, Yosemite Sam makes an appearance riding a railway cart on the Wild West level. He also makes a small cameo in &quot;Multiversus&quot; as a custom ring out animation.

Yosemite Sam appears in multiple episodes of &quot;The Looney Tunes Show&quot;, voiced by Maurice LaMarche. Sam is depicted as being well meaning, but suffering anger problems. He first appeared in the show in three &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; segments called &quot;Blow My Stack&quot;, &quot;Moostache&quot; and &quot;Stick to My Guns&quot;. Yosemite Sam is one of Bugs and Daffy&#x27;s neighbors. In the episode &quot;Daffy Duck, Esq.&quot;, it is revealed that his full name is Samuel Rosenbaum and thus established him as being Jewish (both his creator Friz Freleng and original voice actor Mel Blanc were also Jewish, though there is no evidence that Freleng had ever explicitly intended Sam to have been a Jew). In &quot;Ridiculous Journey&quot;, it is revealed that Yosemite Sam has a cousin in Blacque Jacque Shellacque who Yosemite Sam enlisted to recover Sylvester, Tweety, and Tasmanian Devil after they were accidentally shipped to Alaska. It was through Yosemite Sam that Bugs Bunny and Granny enlisted Blacque Jacque Shellacque&#x27;s help. In &quot;You&#x27;ve Got Hate Mail&quot; after accidentally being sent an angry email by Daffy, Sam decides to change his ways and proceeds to shave, sell his cowboy clothes, and become a normal suburbanite. However, after a particularly annoying book club meeting, he reverts to his old ways.

Yosemite Sam appears in the 2015 DTV movie &quot;Looney Tunes: Rabbits Run&quot; voiced by Maurice LaMarche. He appears in &quot;New Looney Tunes&quot; (originally Wabbit) voiced by Maurice LaMarche in season one and by Fred Tatasciore in season two and three. His appearance has him depicted to having a larger moustache, a stout body and a different hat. Yosemite Sam is often shown trying to commit crimes or obtain items where Bugs Bunny always thwarts him. He is also shown to own a lot of cats at his house.

He later appears as a recurring character in &quot;Looney Tunes Cartoons&quot;, voiced again by Fred Tatasciore, returning to a rivalry with Bugs Bunny in a similar way to their cartoons from the golden age of American animation.

In &quot;Tiny Toons Looniversity&quot;, he is usually seen accompanying Granny and is a security guard at Acme Looniversity.

* Yosemite Sam appears in the &quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot; episode, &quot;Warner Bros. 100th Anniversary&quot;. He is among the Looney Tunes characters guests for the Warner Bros. centennial celebration, voiced once again by Fred Tatasciore.

== Voice actors ==
=== Mel Blanc ===
The role of Yosemite Sam was originated by Warners Bros&#x27; principal voice man, Mel Blanc. In his autobiography, Blanc said he had a difficult time coming up with the voice when he played a similar character called Tex on Judy Canova&#x27;s radio show. He tried giving Sam a small voice but did not feel that it worked. One day, he decided to simply yell at the top of his voice, which was inspired by a fit of road rage he had that day. It fit perfectly with the blustery character but was also a strain on Blanc&#x27;s throat, thus he always did Yosemite Sam&#x27;s lines at the end of a recording session so he could rest himself overnight. As he got into his 70s, the voice became too rough on his throat; the role of Sam was taken over by future Looney Tunes voice actor Joe Alaskey in &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; while Blanc played all his other Looney Tunes roles in the film. This makes Sam one of the few voices created by Blanc to be voiced by someone else during his lifetime. Blanc used the same voice to depict Bob and Doug McKenzie&#x27;s father (portrayed by Dave Thomas, but dubbed with Blanc&#x27;s voice) in the film &quot;Strange Brew&quot; (1983). Blanc voiced the character for the last time in his lifetime in the 1989 TV special &quot;Bugs Bunny&#x27;s Wild World of Sports&quot;. Archive recordings of Blanc as Yosemite Sam were used in the 1999 PlayStation video game, &quot;Bugs Bunny: Lost in Time&quot; (a decade after Blanc&#x27;s death). Blanc used a voice similar to Yosemite Sam&#x27;s for Mr. Spacely on &quot;The Jetsons&quot;.

<doc id="198432" wikidata="Q188689" url="?curid=198432" title="Ultimatum">
<text>An ; ; : ultimata or ultimatums) is a demand whose fulfillment is requested in a specified period of time and which is backed up by a threat to be followed through in case of noncompliance (open loop). An ultimatum is generally the final demand in a series of requests. As such, the time allotted is usually short, and the request is understood not to be open to further negotiation. The threat which backs up the ultimatum can vary depending on the demand in question and on the other circumstances.

The word is used in diplomacy to signify the final terms submitted by one of the parties in negotiation for settlement of any subject of disagreement. It is accompanied by an intimation as to how refusal will be regarded. English diplomacy has devised the adroit reservation that refusal will be regarded as an &quot;unfriendly act&quot;, a phrase which serves as a warning that the consequences of the rupture of negotiations will be considered from the point of view of forcing a settlement. This opens up a variety of possibilities, such as good offices, mediation, the appointment of a commission of inquiry, arbitration, reprisals, pacific blockade and war.

==Deterrence ==
Unlike the circumstances of an ultimatum, the scenario of deterrence is not bound by specific constraints of time, place, or action, and though a threat may be present, there is no formal guarantee of it being acted out. The scenario of nuclear deterrence (particularly the United States and the Soviet Union in the Cold War) is a good example of this concept: while both nations maintained a sizeable stockpile of nuclear weapons aimed at each other, the intent was to prevent open conflict (closed loop), and that no formal condition for initiating conflict was ever established, except in retaliation for the other side initiating an attack. In an ultimatum situation, such as during the Cuban Missile Crisis, either nation would threaten the use of nuclear weapons if certain demands/constraints were not met independent of that retaliatory capability that would have a fixed point of no return—compliance or warfare.

==Requirement for military action== 
An ultimatum may also serve to provide legitimacy for military action. During the July Crisis, Austria-Hungary sent a Ten point ultimatum to Serbia in response to the Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, with the most contentious point being for Serbia to &quot;Accept representatives of the Austro-Hungarian government for the suppression of subversive movements&quot;. The Ultimatum was controversial among other European powers, with the Russian foreign minister saying that no state could accept such demands without &quot;committing suicide.&quot; Serbia refused to accept all ten demands, and on July 28, 1914, Austria-Hungary would declare war on Serbia, beginning the First World War.

==International law==
The Hague Convention relevant to the Opening of Hostilities of 18 October 1907, provides as follows: 

As reasons for a declaration of war are necessarily in the nature of an ultimatum, the ultimatum may now be regarded as an indispensable formality precedent to the outbreak of hostilities.

Another Hague convention of the same date respecting the limitation of the employment of force for the recovery of contract debts provides as follows:

This undertaking, however, is not applicable when the debtor state refuses or neglects to reply to an offer of arbitration or, &quot;after accepting the offer, renders the settlement of the compromise impossible, or, after the arbitration, fails to comply with the award.&quot;

Under this convention, in the cases that it relates, the alternative of the ultimatum is ipso facto arbitration, and it is only when the conditions of the convention have been set at naught that other measures may be employed.

===Subsequent to the United Nations Charter===
The United Nations Charter prohibits not only the use of force but also the threat of such use of force, but there is discussion on whether this prohibition applies only to (militarily) credible threats, whether (or when) the threat of the use of force in self-defence is permitted, and what actions (not necessarily accompanied by a verbal threat) can be considered a threat. 
The International Court of Justice has provided guidance on the legality of the use of threats: generally, if the use of force would be lawful, the threat of such use of force is also legal, and if the actual use of force is later found lawful, then the prior threat is also deemed lawful.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
The actor that presents the other side with an ultimatum should be prepared to make good on the threat, for instance, initiate military action, if the other side does not comply with its demands. 
There are dangers if the threatened actor decides not to comply. On the one hand, if the actor presenting the ultimatum is not willing to go through with the threatened action, the other actor may &quot;call their bluff&quot; presenting a choice between a humiliating climb-down and an unwanted result (such as war). 
On the other hand, the opponent may take the ultimatum seriously and take pre-emptive action.
The ultimatum may encourage the opponent to remain firm so as not to be seen as weak.

One danger here is that the opponent may profess to accept the ultimatum, possibly with conditions, thus weakening the credibility of the issuer of the ultimatum.

Another danger is that the issuer may keep negotiating with the opponent when the requested period of time ends, further weakening the issuer&#x27;s position.

==Theory and strategy behind coercive diplomacy==
The strategy behind an ultimatum and coercive diplomacy is that, when faced with significant pressure and a looming threat, the opposing actor will be compelled to make concessions due to the sense of urgency.

<doc id="198433" wikidata="Q369086" url="?curid=198433" title="GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)">
<text>GoldenEye 007 is a 1997 first-person shooter video game developed by Rare and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64. It is based on the 1995 &quot;James Bond&quot; film &quot;GoldenEye&quot;, with the player controlling the secret agent James Bond to prevent a criminal syndicate from using a satellite weapon. They navigate a series of levels to complete objectives, such as recovering or destroying objects, while shooting enemies. In a multiplayer mode, up to four players compete in several deathmatch scenarios via split-screen. 

Development began in January 1995. An inexperienced team led by Martin Hollis developed &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; over two and a half years. The game was conceived initially as a rail shooter in the style of SEGA&#x27;s &quot;Virtua Cop&quot; (1994), later developing into a first-person shooter. Rare visited the &quot;GoldenEye&quot; set for reference, and Eon Productions and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) allowed them to expand the game with sequences and characters not featured in the film.

&quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; was released in August 1997, almost two years after the release of the film but shortly before the release of its sequel &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;. It faced low expectations from the gaming media during development. However, it received critical acclaim and sold over eight million copies, making it the third-best-selling Nintendo 64 game. The game was praised for its visuals, gameplay depth and variety, and multiplayer mode. In 1998, it received the BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Award, as well as four awards from the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences.

&quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; demonstrated the viability of home consoles as platforms for first-person shooters and signalled a transition from &quot;Doom&quot;-like shooters to a more realistic style. It pioneered features such as atmospheric single-player missions, Rare&#x27;s new Widescreen feature, stealth elements, and multiplayer console deathmatch. The game is considered to be one of the most influential and greatest video games ever made, with many of its elements, such as the Klobb gun, leaving an enduring impression in video game culture. A spiritual successor, &quot;Perfect Dark&quot;, was released in 2000, while a remake developed by Eurocom, also titled &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot;, was released in 2010. The original game was rereleased in January 2023 on Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S via Xbox Game Pass and Nintendo Switch via the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack.

==Gameplay==
&quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; is a first-person shooter in which the player takes the role of Secret Intelligence Service agent James Bond through a series of levels. In each level, the player must complete a set of objectives while computer-controlled opponents try to hinder the player&#x27;s progress. Objectives range from recovering items to destroying objects, defeating enemies, or rescuing hostages. Some objectives may also require the player to use high-tech gadgets. For example, in one level, the player must use Bond&#x27;s electromagnetic watch to acquire a jail cell key. Although the player begins each level with a limited amount of supplies, additional weapons and ammunition can be acquired from defeated enemies. There are no health-recovery items, but body armour can be acquired to provide a secondary health bar.

The game features more than 20 weapons, including pistols, submachine guns, assault rifles, a sniper rifle, grenades, and throwing knives. Most weapons have a finite magazine and must be reloaded after a certain number of shots. Although each weapon has its own characteristics, ammunition is interchangeable between some weapon types. For example, pistols and submachine guns share the same ammunition. Weapons inflict different levels of damage depending on which body part they hit. Head shots cause the most damage, while arm and leg shots inflict the least damage. The Klobb, a submachine gun with a folding stock, possesses a high rate of fire and a wide bullet spread compared to other weapons, but is severely underpowered with a heavy recoil. The Klobb can be dual-wielded for additional firepower. Stealth is often encouraged, as frequent gunfire can alert distant guards, and alarms can spawn enemies. Certain weapons incorporate a suppressor or a telescopic sight to aid the player in killing enemies discreetly.

Each level can be played on three difficulty settings: Agent, Secret Agent, and 00 Agent. These affect aspects such as the damage enemies can withstand and inflict, the amount of ammunition available, and the number of objectives that must be completed. Two bonus levels can be unlocked by completing the game on Special Agent and then on 00 Agent. The player may also replay previously completed levels within target times to unlock bonus cheat options such as infinite ammunition or invincibility. Upon completing the game on the three difficulty settings, an additional mode is unlocked, allowing the player to customise the difficulty of a level by manually adjusting enemies&#x27; health, reaction times, aiming accuracy, and the damage they inflict.

===Multiplayer===
&quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; features a multiplayer mode where up to four players can compete in several deathmatch scenarios via split-screen. These include Normal, You Only Live Twice, The Living Daylights, The Man With the Golden Gun, and Licence to Kill. Normal is a standard mode where players score points by killing opponents. Players can be grouped in teams or compete individually. You Only Live Twice gives players two lives before they are eliminated from the game, resulting in the last surviving player winning the match. In Licence to Kill, players die from a single hit with any weapon. Due to its high rate of fire and wide bullet spread, the Klobb is highly advantageous in this scenario.

In The Man With the Golden Gun, a single Golden Gun, which is capable of killing opponents with one shot, is placed in a fixed location in the level. Once the Golden Gun is picked up, the only way to re-acquire it is by killing the player holding it. In The Living Daylights, a flag is placed in a fixed location in the level, and the player who holds it the longest wins. The flag carrier cannot use weapons but can collect them to keep opponents from stocking ammunition. Options such as the chosen level, characters to play as, weapons available, and game length can be customised for each scenario. Additional levels and characters can be unlocked as the player progresses through the single-player game.

==Plot==

In 1986 Arkhangelsk, Soviet Union, MI6 has uncovered a secret chemical weapons facility at the Byelomorye Dam. James Bond and fellow 00-agent Alec Trevelyan are sent to infiltrate the facility and plant explosive charges. During the mission, Trevelyan is shot by General Arkady Ourumov, while Bond escapes by commandeering an aeroplane.

Five years later in 1991, Bond is sent to investigate a satellite control station in Severnaya, Russia, where programmer Boris Grishenko works. In 1993, Bond investigates an unscheduled test firing of a missile in Kyrgyzstan, believed to be a cover for the launch of a satellite known as GoldenEye. This space-based weapon works by firing a concentrated electromagnetic pulse (EMP) at any Earth target to disable any electrical circuit within range. As Bond leaves the silo, he is ambushed by Ourumov and a squad of Russian troops. Ourumov manages to escape during the encounter.

In 1995, Bond visits Monte Carlo to investigate the frigate &quot;La Fayette&quot;, where he rescues several hostages and plants a tracker bug on the &quot;Pirate&quot; helicopter before it is stolen by the Janus crime syndicate. Bond is then sent a second time to Severnaya, but during the mission, he is captured and locked up in the bunker&#x27;s cells along with Natalya Simonova, a captive computer programmer unwilling to work with Janus. They both escape the complex seconds before it is destroyed—on the orders of Ourumov—by the GoldenEye satellite&#x27;s EMP. Bond next travels to Saint Petersburg, where he arranges with ex-KGB agent Valentin Zukovsky to meet the chief of the Janus organisation. This is revealed to be Alec Trevelyan—his execution by Ourumov in the Arkhangelsk facility was faked.

Bond and Natalya escape from Trevelyan, but are arrested by the Russian police and taken to the military archives for interrogation. Eventually, Bond escapes the interrogation room, rescues Natalya, and communicates with Defence Minister Dimitri Mishkin, who has verified Bond&#x27;s claim of Ourumov&#x27;s treachery. Natalya is recaptured by General Ourumov, and Bond gives chase through the streets of St. Petersburg, eventually reaching an arms depot used by Janus. There, Bond destroys its weaponry stores and then hitches a ride on Trevelyan&#x27;s ex-Soviet missile train, where he kills Ourumov and rescues Natalya. However, Alec Trevelyan and his ally Xenia Onatopp escape to their secret base in Cuba.

Natalya accompanies Bond to the Caribbean. Surveying the Cuban jungle aerially, their light aircraft is shot down. Unscathed, Bond and Natalya perform a ground search of the area&#x27;s heavily guarded jungle terrain but are ambushed by Xenia, who is quickly killed by Bond. Bond sneaks Natalya into the control centre to disrupt transmissions to the GoldenEye satellite and force it to burn up in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. He then follows the fleeing Trevelyan through a series of flooded caverns, eventually arriving at the antenna of the control centre&#x27;s radio telescope. Trevelyan attempts to re-align it in a final attempt to restore contact with the GoldenEye, but Bond destroys machinery vital to controlling the antenna and defeats Trevelyan in a gunfight on a platform above the dish.

==Development==
===Design===
&quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; was developed by the British studio Rare and directed by Martin Hollis, who had previously worked as a second programmer on the coin-op version of &quot;Killer Instinct&quot;. In November 1994, after Nintendo and Rare discussed the possibility of developing a game based on the upcoming &quot;James Bond&quot; film &quot;GoldenEye&quot;, Hollis told Tim Stamper, Rare&#x27;s managing director, that he was interested in the project. Due to the success of Rare&#x27;s 1994 game &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot;, &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; was originally suggested as a 2D platformer for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. However, Hollis proposed a 3D shooting game for the upcoming Nintendo 64 console. He created a document with design ideas, including gadgets, weapons, characters, story digression from the film, and artificial intelligence (AI) that would react to the player.

Rare named Sega&#x27;s 1994 light gun shooter &quot;Virtua Cop&quot;, id Software&#x27;s seminal 1993 first-person shooter &quot;Doom&quot; and the Nintendo 64 launch game &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; as influences. Features such as gun reloading, position-dependent hit reaction animations, penalties for killing innocent characters, and the aiming system that is activated with the R button of the Nintendo 64 controller were adopted from &quot;Virtua Cop&quot;. The developers considered having players reload weapons by unplugging and re-inserting the Rumble Pak on the controller, but Nintendo opposed the idea. The concept of several varied objectives within each mission was inspired by the multiple tasks in each stage of &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;.

The team visited the studios of the &quot;GoldenEye&quot; film several times to collect photographs and blueprints of the sets. Eon Productions and MGM, the companies that control the &quot;James Bond&quot; films, granted the team a broad licence, and many levels were extended or modified to allow the player to participate in sequences not seen in the film. Although the reference material was used for authenticity, the team was not afraid to add to it to help the game design. John Woo films such as &quot;Hard Boiled&quot; influenced the visual effects and kinetic moments. Details such as bullet marks on walls, cartridge cases being ejected from guns, and objects exploding were part of the design. Hollis wanted players to receive a lot of feedback from the environment when they shot.

The team considered implementing both on-rails and free-roaming modes because they did not know how the Nintendo 64 controller would work, and the game&#x27;s gas plant location was modelled with a predetermined path in mind. A modified Sega Saturn controller was used for some early playtesting. The designers&#x27; initial priority was purely on the creation of interesting spaces; level design and balance considerations such as the placement of start and exit points, characters and objectives did not begin until this process was complete. According to Hollis, this unplanned approach gave many levels a realistic and non-linear feel, with several rooms having no direct relevance to a level. After completing the levels, the developers modelled around 40 James Bond gadgets that had been depicted in the films and attempted to find uses for them in each level.

===Production===

Work on &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; began in January 1995 with a team hired by Hollis: programmer Mark Edmonds, background artist Karl Hilton, and character artist B. Jones. Edmonds focused on creating a game engine that could render 3D graphics from art packages into Nintendo 64 data structures. Hilton modelled levels based on the film material, while Jones constructed characters based on photos and costumes they had. Since final Nintendo 64 specifications and development kits were not initially available to Rare, the team had to estimate the finalised console&#x27;s capabilities using an SGI Onyx workstation and Nintendo&#x27;s custom NINGEN development software. In the following months, designer Duncan Botwood joined the team to construct the levels. The first year was spent producing art assets and developing the engine, which originally only allowed the player and enemies to move around a virtual environment.

After the first year of development, Rare added more staff to the project. The first addition was designer David Doak, who helped with the level designs and worked on the AI scripting. He explained how the stealth elements were implemented: &quot;Whenever you fired a gun, it had a radius test and alerted the non-player characters within that radius. If you fired the same gun again within a certain amount of time, it did a larger radius test and I think there was a third even larger radius after that. It meant if you found one guy and shot him in the head and then didn&#x27;t fire again, the timer would reset.&quot; Windows throughout the game were programmed so that enemies cannot see through them. Though unrealistic, this encouraged the player to use windows to spy on enemies.

Hollis hired a second programmer, Steve Ellis, six months later. Although Ellis assisted the development team in many areas and programmed the cheat options, he was mostly responsible for implementing the multiplayer mode, which was added roughly six months before release. According to Doak, Ellis &quot;sat in a room with all the code written for a single-player game and turned &quot;GoldenEye&quot; into a multiplayer game.&quot; The team spent numerous late evenings playtesting it. The multiplayer levels are based on single-player missions and some of them do not support four players because they were initially not designed to handle multiplayer action. A firing range was modelled as an environment, but was not added.
Because the team assumed they could use anything from the &quot;James Bond&quot; universe, the multiplayer mode features characters that appear in previous &quot;Bond&quot; films. Actors who portrayed Bond in previous films were playable during development, but were removed because Rare was unable to get Sean Connery&#x27;s permission to use his likeness. Despite their fictional names, most weapons were modelled after real-world firearms such as the Walther PPK, the AK-74, and the FN P90. The Klobb was inspired by the Škorpion, a Czechoslovak submachine gun with a folding stock. Its name was chosen to honor Ken Lobb, who was Rare&#x27;s Nintendo-side producer and contact at the time. Another weapon, the DD44 Dostovei (modeled after Tokarev pistol), was named after Doak&#x27;s initials. Adrian Smith, the game&#x27;s third and last artist, who had already worked on some games at Rare, was in charge of producing visual effects such as muzzle flashes and explosions. He mentioned the 1995 film &quot;Heat&quot; as an influence.

The final Nintendo 64 hardware could render polygons faster than the SGI Onyx workstation the development team had been using. This helped the developers significantly, as some backgrounds rendered at 2 frames per second on the Onyx without even drawing enemies, objects, or Bond&#x27;s gun. However, the textures had to be cut down by half. Hilton explained one method of improving performance: &quot;A lot of &quot;GoldenEye&quot; is in black and white. RGB colour textures cost a lot more in terms of processing power. You could do double the resolution if you used greyscale, so a lot was done like that. If I needed a bit of colour, I&#x27;d add it in the vertex.&quot; When &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; was released in 1996, the 3D collision detection system was influential for Hollis because &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; was originally using a 2D method.

The music was primarily composed by Graeme Norgate and Grant Kirkhope. Norgate previously penned the music of &quot;Blast Corps&quot;, while Kirkhope composed the music of &quot;Donkey Kong Land 2&quot;. Robin Beanland, the game&#x27;s third composer, only wrote the elevator music that can be heard in certain levels. All the sound effects were created by Norgate and a lot of effort was put into combining and permuting sounds in different ways to create a satisfying feel. According to Hollis, whenever the player shoots a gun, up to nine different sound effects will randomly trigger. When the game was reviewed by Nintendo shortly before it was released, the company was slightly concerned about the amount of violence and gunplay. As a result, the team toned down the killing and added an end credits sequence that introduces all the non-player characters, giving the game a filmic sense. The game received a Teen rating from the Entertainment Software Rating Board.

&quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; was released on a 96-megabit cartridge on 25 August 1997. Although this was over a year and a half after the release of the &quot;GoldenEye&quot; film, the game benefited from publicity for the upcoming &quot;James Bond&quot; film &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;. Every cartridge of the game contains a ZX Spectrum emulator with ten Rare developed games. This function was originally made as an experimental side project by Rare and was deactivated in the final version, but has since been unlocked through fan-made patches. The development of &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; took more than two and a half years to complete and had a budget of US$2 million.

== Reception ==
Despite low expectations among the gaming media and an unsuccessful showing at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Atlanta in 1997, &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; received widespread acclaim from critics and was a commercial success. In 1998, it sold approximately 2.1 million copies. By 2001, it had sold over seven million copies worldwide. Overall, &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; sold more than eight million units worldwide, making it the third-best-selling Nintendo 64 game, behind &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; and &quot;Mario Kart 64&quot;. According to a paper published on the website of the Entertainment Software Association, the game grossed $250 million worldwide, more than 70% of the movie&#x27;s box office despite having only 3.3% of the movie&#x27;s budget.

Graphically, &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; was praised for its varied and detailed environments, realistic animations, and special effects such as glass transparencies and lingering smoke. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; said the frame rate in multiplayer games was high, while &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; described it as somewhat choppy and sluggish. The zoomable sniper rifle was praised as one of the most impressive and entertaining features, with &quot;Edge&quot; describing it as a &quot;novel twist&quot; and Jeff Gerstmann of &quot;GameSpot&quot; noting its ability to alleviate the distance fog. The music was praised for its inclusion of the &quot;James Bond Theme&quot; and for adding ambience. Some levels begin in lifts and feature transitions from elevator music to full soundtracks, which Gerstmann cited as an illustration of the attention to detail.

The gameplay was highlighted for its depth and requiring more stealth and intelligence than earlier first-person shooters. IGN&#x27;s Doug Perry called &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; an immersive game which &quot;blends smart strategy gameplay with fast-action gunmanship&quot;. Similarly, Greg Sewart of Gaming Age remarked that players have &quot;a bit of freedom as to what they want to do in any given situation, and what order the directives are completed in&quot;. Reviewers also enjoyed the wide variety of weapons and the multi-objective-based missions, stating that they kept the game fresh. The controls were praised for being more intuitive than Acclaim&#x27;s earlier well-received Nintendo 64 first-person shooter &quot;&quot;, though some found the cursor targeting difficult to master. &quot;GameRevolution&quot; credited the gameplay for being realistic and different from other shooters, but also criticised the campaign for being badly paced. The publication noted that &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; &quot;takes it for granted that you have already seen the movie&quot; and that players may get stuck due to the game&#x27;s lack of orientation.

At the time, &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; was considered the best multiplayer game on the system, &quot;edging &quot;Mario Kart 64&quot; by a hair&quot; according to IGN. &quot;Edge&quot; called it addictive and praised the originality of some of the scenarios such as You Only Live Twice. &quot;GamePro&quot; said the multiplayer modes &quot;will have you shooting your friends for the rest of the year&quot;, while &quot;Next Generation&quot; highlighted the number of multiplayer options, calling &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; &quot;a surprising killer app, if only for the smashing multiplayer options. The excellent single-player game backing it up makes it well worth buying indeed.&quot; The game was also hailed for its accurate and detailed adaptation of the film, with &quot;GamePro&quot; going so far as to call it &quot;one of the best movie-to-game translations ever&quot;. The ability to use numerous signature Bond gadgets and weapons was considered a particularly strong element in this regard. Crispin Boyer of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; stated that Rare &quot;has packed everything that&#x27;s cool about 007 into this game.&quot;

&quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; received multiple year-end awards, including the BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Award in 1998, and four awards from the inaugural AIAS Interactive Achievement Awards: &quot;Interactive Title of the Year&quot;, &quot;Console Game of the Year&quot;, &quot;Console Action Game of the Year&quot;, and &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Software Engineering&quot;; it also received nominations for &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Art/Graphics&quot; and &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Interactive Design&quot;. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; named it both Most Addictive Game and Best Movie to Game in their 1998 Video Game Buyer&#x27;s Guide, and Game of the Year in their Editor&#x27;s Choice Awards. Rare won the BAFTA award for Best UK Developer.

==Legacy==
===Retrospective appraisal===
&quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; has been credited for proving that it is possible to create a &quot;fun&quot; first-person shooter experience on a home console in both single-player and multiplayer modes—when the game was released, the first-person shooter genre was primarily for PC games. The game opened the genre to the console market, and it has been credited for paving the way for the popularity of &quot;Halo&quot; and &quot;Call of Duty&quot;. The game&#x27;s introduction of a multiplayer deathmatch mode on a console is often credited for having revolutionised the genre, with &quot;Edge&quot; stating that it set the standard for multiplayer console combat until it was surpassed by &quot;&quot; in 2001. &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; also introduced stealth elements that were unprecedented in first-person shooters. The game&#x27;s use of realistic gameplay, which contrasted with the approaches taken by &quot;Doom&quot; clones, and its context-sensitive hit locations on enemies added a realism that was previously unseen in video games, although the 1996 &quot;Team Fortress&quot; computer mod for &quot;Quake&quot; had previously introduced headshots. Alongside Shiny Entertainment&#x27;s 1997 third-person shooter &quot;MDK&quot;, &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; has been credited with pioneering and popularising the now-standard inclusion of scoped sniper rifles in video games. The game&#x27;s mission design, enemy AI, and stealth gameplay influenced contemporary titles such as &quot;Half-Life&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Syphon Filter&quot;, and &quot;Deus Ex&quot;.

&quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; is frequently cited as one of the greatest video games of all time. Shortly after its release in 1997, &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; ranked &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; the 25th best console video game of all time, calling it &quot;easily the best movie game, and, more importantly, the best first-person game ever.&quot; In 1999, &quot;Next Generation&quot; editors placed &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; at No. 10 on their list of Top 50 Games of All Time, commenting, &quot;Marrying &quot;Doom&quot;-style shooting with trademark &quot;Bond&quot; missions, &quot;GoldenEye&quot; is the perfect thinking-man&#x27;s shooter.&quot; In 2000, &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; readers ranked &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; first place in the magazine&#x27;s poll of 100 Greatest Games of All Time, and fifth in a similar poll the following year. In 2001, &quot;Game Informer&quot; ranked the game 16th on its list of Top 100 Games of All Time. In 2004, &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; readers voted &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; as the 33rd greatest retro game, with editors calling it &quot;easily the best &quot;Bond&quot; game to date.&quot; In 2005, &quot;IGN&quot; editors ranked the game 29th on their list of Top 100 Games of All Time, while readers placed it at seventh on a separate list. In 2009, &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; ranked the game 55th on a list of greatest Nintendo games.

&quot;Edge&quot; has featured &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; prominently in several &quot;greatest game&quot; lists. The game was ranked third in a staff-voted poll in 2000, was included as one of the publication&#x27;s top ten shooters in 2003, and was placed at No. 17 in a staff, reader, and gaming industry-voted poll in 2007. Although &quot;Edge&quot; awarded &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; a score of 9 out of 10 upon its release, the publication acknowledged in 2013 that the game should have received the highest score. With its eight million copies sold, &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; was a significant contributor in helping the Nintendo 64 remain competitive against the PlayStation, although Nintendo ultimately lost much of the market share. &quot;GamePro&quot; called &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; the console killer app of the 1990s and the greatest licensed game from a film of all time, while &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; considered the multiplayer mode one of the greatest multiplayer experiences in Nintendo history. 

In a retrospective analysis, &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; editor Mark Reece gave &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; eight out of ten, stating that although the multiplayer mode stands up well, its graphics, audio and &quot;fiddly&quot; aiming system are dated. He noted that &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot;″s approach to difficulty settings provides considerable replay value, but is a system rarely used in modern first-person shooters. Writing for &quot;NME&quot; on the game&#x27;s 20th anniversary, journalist Mark Beaumont highlighted the immersive graphics, aesthetic, location-based damage on enemies, and revolutionary multiplayer mode, stating that it &quot;helped to introduce gaming as a group event&quot;.

In its 2023 ranking of every North American N64 game, Hard Drive called &quot;GoldenEye&quot; the best title on the console, saying it was &quot;an inarguably era-defining game that not only established the gold standard of the day for the burgeoning FPS genre, but also opened the floodgates for nearly a decade of z-grade shooters adapted from blockbuster IPs, all made in a limp, flagrant attempt to replicate its success.&quot; The site said that &quot;the most enduring testament to [the game&#x27;s] legacy is how it’s grown to overshadow the movie it’s based on.&quot;

In 2011, the game was selected as one of 80 games from the past 40 years to be placed in the Art of Video Games exhibit in the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, D.C.

===The Klobb===
The Klobb has been retrospectively described by critics as a memorable aspect of the gameplay of &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot;, albeit for its negative traits; despite its high rate of fire, it deals a low amount of damage and is extremely inaccurate. In a contemporaneous review, &quot;Edge&quot; remarked that the ability to dual-wield the Klobb is one of the most satisfying moments, and argued that it is likely to be remembered by players unlike the vast majority of video game weapons. In their view, imperfection adds both realism and unpredictability to a game, and that the moments created by this were something that designers were beginning to realize were just as valuable as creating a &quot;perfect&quot; weapon. Simon Parkin of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; noted the naming of the Klobb as one of the first times that issues arose over using real-life gun names for in-game weapons, as &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; was one of the first console games to feature 3D firearms. Parkin noted that while the invented gun names were &quot;acceptable in the fictional universe of &quot;James Bond&quot;&quot;, he emphasized that &quot;for those games based around real armed forces, the inclusion of brand names was necessary to remain faithful to the source material.&quot; The gun was included in the video game &quot;Too Human&quot; as &quot;KLOBB&quot;, due to Ken Lobb&#x27;s association with the game&#x27;s developers, Silicon Knights. During development this weapon was called the Skorpion VZ/61 after its real-world counterpart but was changed due to legal reasons.

===Rerelease===
An Xbox Live Arcade (XBLA) remaster was in development at Rare and 4J Studios for several months in 2008. The remaster was set to add several new features, including online multiplayer and the ability to toggle between the original and updated graphics. Though it reportedly needed only two more months of development before it was finished, the remaster was cancelled because Nintendo, MGM, and Microsoft, which acquired Rare in 2002, were unable to come to a licensing agreement. According to Rare&#x27;s Ross Bury, Mark Edmonds, and Chris Tilston, Rare began developing the remaster in late 2006, shortly after the Stamper brothers had left Rare and after the company had completed &quot;Perfect Dark Zero&quot; and &quot;Kameo&quot;. Microsoft had suggested that &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; would be appropriate for XBLA, leading Rare to start on the remaster prior to getting Nintendo&#x27;s permission, believing it would not have been a problem because &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; was one of the most popular Nintendo 64 games. Rare had completed the conversion and removed most of the bugs before they learned that Nintendo had not cleared it. This halted development until negotiation on rights could be discussed, which ultimately fell through. In January 2021, a full playthrough of a prototype of the XBLA version was streamed to YouTube, showcasing improved graphics running at 60 frames per second. Later, a near-final playable ROM image of the XBLA game was leaked online from an unknown source.

In January 2022, achievements for an Xbox One version of &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; were leaked. In June 2022, the same leaked achievements were seen on Xbox servers. &quot;VGC&quot; and &quot;Eurogamer&quot; reported that the leaked achievements suggested an official release was imminent. In September 2022, Microsoft, Nintendo and Rare announced the Nintendo 64 version would be rereleased on Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S through Xbox Game Pass, and on Nintendo Switch through the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription service. The Xbox version was remastered by Code Mystics and supports 4K resolution displays, but does not include any of the enhancements from the canceled XBLA remaster. The Switch release is playable in both the original 4:3 aspect ratio as well as widescreen (the same goes with the Xbox version), and is the only one to feature online multiplayer, via the Nintendo Switch Online emulator&#x27;s built-in online multiplayer functionality. The Xbox version was published by Xbox Game Studios and both versions were released on 27 January 2023. Players who digitally purchased Rare&#x27;s 2015 Xbox One compilation &quot;Rare Replay&quot; received the game for free.

===Related games===
After &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; was released, Rare began development of a spiritual successor, &quot;Perfect Dark&quot;. Using an upgraded version of the &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; game engine, &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; was released for the Nintendo 64 in 2000. Although the game features a setting and storyline unrelated to &quot;James Bond&quot;, it shares many gameplay features, including a similar control scheme, mission objectives that vary with difficulty settings, and cheat options unlockable through quick level completions. While &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; was still in development, Martin Hollis left Rare to work as a consultant on the development of the GameCube at Nintendo of America. Other members of the &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; team also left the studio to form Free Radical Design. The company developed the &quot;TimeSplitters&quot; series of first-person shooters. These games contain several references to &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot;, including the design of the health-HUD, the nature of the aiming system, and the Russian dam setting of the opening level of &quot;TimeSplitters 2&quot;.

After forming a partnership with MGM in late 1998, Electronic Arts published games based on then-recent &quot;James Bond&quot; films, &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; and &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;, as well as entirely original ones, including &quot;Agent Under Fire&quot;, &quot;Nightfire&quot;, &quot;Everything or Nothing&quot; and &quot;&quot;. Although Nintendo considered the possibility of bringing &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; to the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console in 2006, the game was never released for the platform due to legal issues involving the numerous licence holders with rights to the game and to the &quot;James Bond&quot; intellectual property. In 2006, the &quot;James Bond&quot; game licence was acquired by Activision. Activision published more games, including &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot;, &quot;Blood Stone&quot; and a 2010 remake of &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot;&quot;.&quot; The remake features Daniel Craig as the playable character, contemporary first-person shooter conventions, new level layouts, and online multiplayer. Activision lost the &quot;James Bond&quot; game licence in 2014.

In 2010, an independent development team released &quot;&quot;, a multiplayer-only total conversion mod that runs on the Source engine. &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; had initially been intended for inclusion in &quot;Rare Replay&quot;; a behind-the-scenes featurette for the compilation was produced, but was not released until being leaked in 2019. A fan remake powered by Unreal Engine 4, &quot;GoldenEye 25&quot;, was in development and originally scheduled for a 2022 release in honour of the game&#x27;s 25th anniversary, but it was retooled into an original property called &quot;S.P.I.E.S.&quot; (the title was later changed to Deceive Inc.) after MGM sent a cease and desist letter to the developers.

===Speedrunning===
The game has had a speedrunning presence. As of 2024, the game continues to have a strong speedrunning presence, a following it has maintained since at least as far back as 1999, which was when &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; and &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; speedrunner and gaming documentarian Karl Jobst first discovered the community.

=== &quot;GoldenEra&quot; ===
In 2022, to celebrate the game&#x27;s 25th anniversary, a full-length documentary film about the game was released called &quot;GoldenEra&quot;, which details the legacy of the game as well as the chaotic and intense development process and effect the game has had on popular culture and modern first-person shooters.

<text>Perfect Dark is a 2000 first-person shooter developed and published by Rare for the Nintendo 64. The first game of the &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; series, it follows Joanna Dark, an agent of the Carrington Institute research centre, as she attempts to stop an extraterrestrial conspiracy by rival corporation dataDyne. The game features a campaign mode where the player must complete a series of levels to progress through the story, as well as a range of multiplayer options, including a co-operative mode and traditional deathmatch settings with computer-controlled bots.

As a spiritual successor to Rare&#x27;s 1997 first-person shooter &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot;, &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; shares many features with its predecessor and runs on an upgraded version of its game engine. &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; director Martin Hollis led the game&#x27;s production for the first fourteen months of its near three-year development cycle before he left Rare to pursue other interests. The game is one of the most technically-advanced titles for the Nintendo 64, and requires an Expansion Pak to access the campaign mode and most of the multiplayer features. Shortly before the game&#x27;s release, a feature that would have allowed players to place a photograph of their choice onto the face of their multiplayer character was cut due to sensitive issues surrounding the ability for players to attack images of real people.

Upon release, &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; received critical acclaim and sold relatively well, eventually joining Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Player&#x27;s Choice&quot; game selection. Critics widely praised its graphics, artificial intelligence, and number of multiplayer options, but some criticised its inconsistent frame rate. The game received the BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Moving Images Award for 2000 and the Golden Satellite Award for Best Interactive Product in 2001. The game is occasionally cited as one of the greatest games of all time. It was supplemented by a Game Boy Color counterpart, which allows some gameplay options to alternatively be unlocked via a Transfer Pak. A remaster, also titled &quot;Perfect Dark&quot;, which was developed by 4J Studios and published by Microsoft Game Studios, as well as featuring enhanced graphics and online multiplayer, was released in 2010 for the Xbox 360 via it&#x27;s Xbox Live Arcade download service. The game was re-released on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack via the Mature 17+ app in June 2024.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Perfect Dark&quot; is a first-person shooter where players complete levels to unlock content and progress through the game&#x27;s storyline. Players manoeuvre their character from a first-person perspective and have the ability to lean left or right, look up or down, crouch, crawl, and drop from most ledges; there is no jump ability. Interaction with the environment is via a single context-sensitive button, which can activate computers, operate lifts, and open doors. Players can carry an unlimited number of weapons, ranging from handguns to assault rifles, rocket launchers, a shotgun, a sniper rifle, and combat knives. Besides their primary mode of fire, weapons have a secondary function that enables an alternate fire mode or grants players special abilities. For example, the secondary function of the K7 Avenger assault rifle detects threats like explosive devices. Most weapons have a finite magazine and must be reloaded after a certain number of shots. Some can be used in duplicate, one in each hand.

Players have a certain amount of health which decreases when attacked by opponents. Although the game does not feature health recovery items, players can pick up shields that protect them with a secondary health bar. Players and opponents can disarm each other at close range, and players may use this feature to steal weapons or knock foes unconscious. Damage taken during combat is location-based, with a shot to the torso causing more damage than a shot to a limb. A number of tutorials and training activities can be taken in the game&#x27;s home level. The most notable of these is the shooting range, where players can test their proficiency with the game&#x27;s weapons in individual challenges. In addition to training activities, players can find information about the game&#x27;s locations and characters, which are gradually unlocked as they complete levels.

===Campaign===
&quot;Perfect Dark&quot; features a campaign mode where a single player controls the game&#x27;s protagonist, Joanna Dark, through a series of levels collected together into missions. In each level, the player must complete a set of objectives while opponents controlled by the game&#x27;s artificial intelligence try to hinder the player&#x27;s progress. Objectives generally require the recovery and use of high-tech gadgets like night-vision goggles or door decoders. The player has freedom as to how to approach encounters and many objectives can be completed in a nonlinear order. Stealth is an important element of the gameplay because the player can kill opponents without being seen or remain undetected by using disguises. If Joanna fails an objective or her health is fully depleted, the player must start the level again from the beginning.

Each level can be played on three distinct difficulty settings. These affect aspects such as the number of objectives that must be completed, damage taken from opponents, the effectiveness of the game&#x27;s optional aiming assistance, and the availability of ammunition and protective shields. Four bonus levels may be unlocked by completing the campaign on each difficulty setting and all the challenges in the firing range. Some of these bonus levels allow the player to assume the role of a different character. If all the levels have been completed on the highest difficulty, an additional setting becomes available, allowing the player to customise various aspects of the game&#x27;s opponents, such as their health, aiming accuracy, and the damage they inflict. The player may unlock cheats by completing levels within a certain time limit.

The campaign includes a co-operative mode, allowing either two players, or one player and up to four computer-controlled bots, to tackle a level together. If two players play, the game splits the screen horizontally or vertically. Options such as friendly fire can be disabled and only one player is required to survive a level. A &quot;Counter-Operative&quot; mode is included, allowing one player to play a level as Joanna while another takes the role of an opponent while attempting to stop her. The player-controlled opponent has less health than Joanna but will reappear as another opponent when defeated. The opposing player may choose to take control of another opponent at any time by swallowing a suicide pill.

===Multiplayer===
&quot;Perfect Dark&quot; features a multiplayer mode where up to four players and eight computer-controlled bots can compete against each other in different arenas. A split-screen is used for multiple players. Players start a game unarmed and with a certain amount of health. Weapons and ammunition are placed around the arena in preset positions. Once a player is killed, they are regenerated unarmed elsewhere in the arena. The objective of each game is determined by the scenario being played. Scenarios range from the traditional deathmatch mode, where players score points by killing opponents, to objective-based modes such as Capture the Flag and King of the Hill. Other scenarios include Hold the Briefcase, where players must take a briefcase and survive with it for as long as possible, and Hacker Central, a game type where players score points by hacking a computer system using a data uplink device.

Aspects of a multiplayer game can be highly customised, including the chosen arena, the winning conditions, and the ability to choose what weapons and items appear where in the arena. Players can be grouped into teams or compete individually, and they can optionally be shown coloured according to their team. The appearance, team affiliation, skill level and pre-set behaviours of each computer-controlled bot can be customised. Pre-set behaviours range from them pursuing the highest-scoring player to exclusively chasing the player who killed them last. Other behaviours restrict bots to only attack players using fists and disarming moves. On higher skill levels, bots perform actions at a superhuman level. Players may issue commands to bots of their team to perform certain tasks. For example, a player can order an allied bot to defend an area or attack a designated opponent.

The multiplayer mode includes 30 pre-set challenges against bots that may be tackled by one or more players. These challenges cover a variety of game types, weapon arrangements, and level setups. By completing challenges, additional features such as new weapons, player models, and bot behaviours are unlocked. At the end of a match, the overall results are shown, alongside information about the individual players&#x27; performance. The game keeps track of player statistics such as damage dealt and distance travelled, and awards players with medals based on how well they performed. Players are ranked according to their performance; the better the performance, the higher the grade. The player&#x27;s overall progress, multiplayer setups, and character profiles can be saved to the Nintendo 64 game cartridge or a Controller Pak. The game also supports the Rumble Pak.

==Plot==
&quot;Perfect Dark&quot; is set in an alternate 2023 against the backdrop of an interstellar war between two alien races: the Maians, who resemble the archetypal Grey alien, and the Skedar, reptile-like creatures who use a cloaking device to appear human. On Earth, there is an ongoing rivalry between two companies: The Carrington Institute, a research centre founded by Daniel Carrington that secretly operates an espionage group in league with the Maians; and dataDyne, a defence contractor corporation headed by Cassandra de Vries. In exchange for creating an AI with code-breaking abilities to access an ancient alien spacecraft at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, the Skedar agree to supply dataDyne with enough alien technology to become the biggest corporation on Earth.

The player is cast as Joanna Dark, an agent of the Carrington Institute whose excellent scores in training have earned her the codename &quot;Perfect Dark&quot;. On her first mission, she is sent to extract a defector known as Dr. Caroll from a dataDyne laboratory. Dr. Caroll is revealed to be the AI created by dataDyne, and is worried about the mission for which it had been designed. After the extraction, Carrington is held captive at his private villa by dataDyne soldiers. When Joanna rescues him, she is informed that Dr. Caroll has been taken to a dataDyne front in Chicago. There, Joanna learns that Cassandra, NSA director Trent Easton, and a mysterious man known as Mr. Blonde plan to kidnap the President of the United States to get access to a deep sea research vessel called the &quot;Pelagic II&quot;. Although the President is in danger, Carrington alerts Joanna that a Maian craft was shot down near Area 51 and sends her to rescue a Maian protector named Elvis.

Because the President of the United States refuses to loan dataDyne the &quot;Pelagic II&quot;, the NSA sends a strike team to kill and replace him with a dataDyne-grown clone. The strike team invades the air base from which the Air Force One will depart. When Joanna foils this strike, the NSA and a group of cloaked Skedar take over the plane itself, which crashes after Joanna attempts to detach a craft attached to it. Having survived the crash, Joanna eliminates the President&#x27;s clone and rescues the real President. Trent&#x27;s incompetence angers Mr. Blonde, who kills him after disabling his cloaking device. With no other options, dataDyne hijacks the &quot;Pelagic II&quot; to reach the ancient spacecraft. However, unbeknownst to dataDyne, the spacecraft contains a powerful weapon capable of destroying a planet and the Skedar intend to test it on Earth before using it against the Maian homeworld.

Joanna and Elvis follow dataDyne to the ancient spacecraft, where they find a reprogrammed Dr. Caroll cracking the weapon. Joanna replaces its current personality with a backup of the original, and the restored Dr. Carroll sets the weapon to self-destruct. As Carrington and Joanna prepare for a Presidential reception, the Skedar assault the Carrington Institute and capture Joanna. In space, aboard an alien spaceship on course to the Skedar homeworld, Joanna finds herself in a holding cell with Cassandra. Feeling that she has been used, Cassandra redeems herself by making a distraction and sacrificing herself, freeing Joanna and therefore giving herself a chance for revenge. With the help of Elvis, Joanna takes control of the spaceship and lands on the Skedar homeworld, where she ultimately defeats the Skedar leader, leaving the Skedar in disarray. The game ends with Elvis and Joanna leaving the planet just prior to an orbital bombardment from the Maian navy.

==Development==
===Concept and design===
&quot;Perfect Dark&quot; was developed by Rare and originally directed by Martin Hollis as a spiritual successor to the company&#x27;s 1997 first-person shooter &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot;. Shortly after &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; was released, Rare was planning to work on a game based on the &quot;GoldenEye&quot; sequel &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;, but the company was outbid by Electronic Arts, which would release their video game adaptation in 1999. The result did not upset the developers, who felt they had already spent too much time immersed in the &quot;James Bond&quot; universe. Working titles for the new project included &quot;Covert Ops&quot; and &quot;Alien Intelligence&quot; before the words &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; were decided on. The word &quot;Dark&quot; was chosen for its association with the game&#x27;s bleak focus on killing. Hollis noted naming similarities to the 2006 first-person shooter &quot;Black&quot; by Criterion Games: &quot;Game developers just like black, nihilism, dystopian futures, the number zero, infinity, spheres, perfection—all that kind of stuff&quot;. The double slash symbol in the game&#x27;s logo was inspired by the Japanese writing system, while the bad grammar of the phrase &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; partially alludes to Hollis&#x27; affection for the way Japanese developers use English words in their own games and products.

The game&#x27;s science fiction setting was chosen due to the developers&#x27; interest in the genre. &quot;The X-Files&quot; television series inspired the incorporation of a gray alien character and the premise of aliens being investigated. Other influences on the setting, theme and plot included conspiracy theories and works such as the &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; manga, &quot;Elektra&quot; comic books, the films &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and &quot;Judge Dredd&quot;, and the writing of author Philip K. Dick. Hollis and designer David Doak picked architectural and impressive sci-fi dystopian settings; the plot was then constructed around these locations. For example, the first level takes place in a skyscraper that lead artist Karl Hilton had always wanted to build, and features realistic environments like service stairs and an exterior area that can be explored. Although the game features a new fictional universe, it was still envisioned as a spy shooter like &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot;. The developers&#x27; desires to expand upon its stealth mechanics, along with their admiration for the 1998 stealth game &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;, led to the creation of gadgets such as the CamSpy and the data uplink device.

The decision to make the central character a woman was part of Hollis&#x27; belief that there should be more games starring women, considering the fact that &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; already starred a man. To this end, the team created Joanna Dark, influenced by a number of fictional heroines: Kim Kimberly from the 1983 interactive fiction game &quot;Snowball&quot;, the seductive spy Agent X-27 in the 1931 film &quot;Dishonored&quot;, the eponymous femme fatale of the 1990 film &quot;La Femme Nikita&quot;, and FBI agent Dana Scully from &quot;The X-Files&quot;. The name of the in-game company dataDyne was inspired by Yoyodyne from the 1965 novella &quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot; by Thomas Pynchon. The layout of the Air Force One level was inspired by the 1997 film of the same name because it was the only reference material the team had. In the game&#x27;s Counter-Operative mode, the idea that the opposing player can take control of another opponent at any time was inspired by the 1999 film &quot;The Matrix&quot;, where agents can reappear as another person in the film&#x27;s simulated reality.

===Production===
When production of the game started, the developers upgraded the &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; game engine with new features and enhancements such as real-time lighting and support for bigger environments and more textures. According to Rare, only 30% of the original engine remained, providing a basic framework to construct levels and animate characters. A new movement system was constructed, allowing players to fall off edges. Other incremental improvements included better shattering glass effects, which would allow players to shoot out objects such as bottles of wine, and the inclusion of computer-controlled bots in multiplayer matches. The artificial intelligence was improved so that opponents could work as a team and draw a secondary weapon when disarmed. Death cries and more elaborate gore effects, which allow gunshots to disperse and stain enemies&#x27; blood onto nearby walls and objects, were also added.

Originally, Hollis hoped that the difference between light and dark would be a significant feature of the gameplay, and the title was intended to reflect this focus. A flashlight was implemented by software engineer Steve Ellis, who had been responsible for much of the multiplayer mode of &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot;, but was ultimately not included in the game due to limitations of the Nintendo 64 hardware. In 2006, Hollis remarked that such aims were overambitious, stating that &quot;even today, you can see game developers struggle to make light and dark foundational from a gameplay perspective&quot;. Nevertheless, the game features more advanced lighting than its predecessor. For example, lights can be shot out to create darkened areas, gunfire and explosions illuminate rooms dynamically, and the player can use infrared or night-vision goggles.

Hollis was involved with &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; for the first 14 months of its near three-year development cycle, during which progress was unsatisfactory. As he explained, &quot;each of us was asking for more than the other could give. This situation ended with my departure, and with very deep regret I was unable to see &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; to completion&quot;. Hollis&#x27; decision came after his four-year contract with Rare was about to expire, which he chose not to renew as he wanted to pursue other interests. Shortly after his exit in September 1998, four additional members—Doak, Hilton, Ellis and composer Graeme Norgate—left Rare to form Free Radical Design, partially because they were unsatisfied with the working environment. This resulted in a loss of half of the workforce and led Rare to assign more people to the team remaining on the project, which eventually became three times bigger than &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot;″s. Programmer Mark Edmonds was promoted to team leader because of his knowledge of the game engine. Although the story and ideas for the game were kept intact, the new team contributed so much to development that it was seen as a fresh start. The team worked in a very isolated and free environment and did not have a production manager, a schedule, meetings, commercial pressure, or any sort of deadlines. According to artist Brett Jones: &quot;People would just do things they thought were cool and would work&quot;.

In spring 1999, Rare moved its headquarters from a country farmhouse in Twycross, Leicestershire to its current multi-million office complex. Although the locations are a few minutes away from each other, the move caused minor disruptions for some. Rare installed an in-house motion capture studio, which was used to capture hit animations and full walk cycles. Game designer Duncan Botwood wore a pair of heels to portray Joanna Dark in some sessions, but motion capture artist Laurie Sage performed most of her moves. Many of the game opponents were based on members of the development team, who also performed the motion capture required for their animation. Numerous secrets were added to the game to fuel the exploration efforts of players, including a piece of cheese hidden in every level. These were deliberately placed by one of the level editors as a graphical oddity for the player&#x27;s confusion. The game has two hidden passwords: one found by picking up a necklace in one level and another by reaching the highest rank in the multiplayer mode. Rare had originally intended these details to access password-protected sections of promotional websites and use them for an alternate reality game.

As developers kept adding features, the game ended up using all the extra memory on their debug consoles and became too big to fit into the Nintendo 64&#x27;s standard 4 MB of random-access memory (RAM). Because the developers were unable to optimise it, they made use of the Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak, which increases the Nintendo 64&#x27;s RAM from 4 MB to 8 MB. Although the Expansion Pak is required to access the game&#x27;s campaign and most of the multiplayer features, a limited subset of deathmatch options are available without the device—around 35% of the game is playable without an Expansion Pak, as estimated on the game&#x27;s instruction booklet. The Expansion Pak allows the game to optionally be played in a 480i &quot;high-resolution&quot; mode. The Counter-Operative mode proved to be difficult to implement and led the game to be delayed. The iterative nature of the game&#x27;s development led Hollis to describe the ultimate number of multiplayer options as &quot;a vast array of features I [had] never planned&quot;.

Cut from the game was a feature that allowed players to place a photograph of their choice onto the face of their multiplayer character. The photos would have been taken by the Game Boy Camera accessory and directly transferred to the game via a Nintendo 64 Transfer Pak. They could then be cropped or manipulated with an in-game editor and mapped onto the polygonal head of a multiplayer character. The photos could also be saved to the game cartridge or a Controller Pak for cross-game sharing. Although Rare&#x27;s Nintendo-side producer Ken Lobb originally stated that the feature was removed due to technical difficulties, the actual reason was revealed to be sensitive issues surrounding the ability for players to attack images of real people. Rare&#x27;s decision came after then-recent attacks such as the Columbine High School massacre, when new censorship laws were being introduced in the United States.

The soundtrack was primarily composed by Grant Kirkhope, who replaced Norgate after his departure. Writing sci-fi music was a new and enjoyable experience for Kirkhope, as he had mainly worked on &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; at the time. While he took inspiration from &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and the whistling sound of &quot;The X-Files&quot; theme song, he reused much of Norgate&#x27;s sample set, especially peculiar sci-fi noises he had created. One of Norgate&#x27;s few contributions to the final &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; score was the theme of the first level. A third composer, David Clynick, composed the game&#x27;s cinematic sequence while Kirkhope was working on &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; and &quot;Banjo-Tooie&quot;. The game supports 16x9 widescreen and Dolby surround sound, and features voice acting for all in-game and cutscene dialogue. Nintendo wanted an American actress to voice Joanna Dark, but the role ultimately went to composer Eveline Fischer. Because &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; features more than 45 minutes of voiced cutscenes, the game was shipped in a 32 MB cartridge.

==Marketing and release==
Although a follow-up to &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; was confirmed to be in development in early 1998, &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; was formally presented as Nintendo&#x27;s lead game at E3 1998 in Atlanta, Georgia. Originally scheduled for a release in summer 1999 and later in December 1999, &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; was heavily trailed in video game magazines, with &quot;Nintendo Official Magazine&quot; predicting that it would be &quot;the best shooting game this century&quot;. A working version of the game appeared at the European Computer Trade Show in September 1998; &quot;N64 Magazine&quot; described the preview as having &quot;the kind of attention to detail that had everyone who saw [it] drooling&quot;. A more complete version was presented at E3 in May 1999, where the game&#x27;s compatibility with the Game Boy Camera was announced, and at Nintendo Space World in August 1999, alongside Rare&#x27;s &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; and &quot;Jet Force Gemini&quot;. Shortly before release, Rare unveiled a website for the in-game company dataDyne to promote interest in the game&#x27;s storyline. The game had a marketing budget of $10 million.

&quot;Perfect Dark&quot; was first released in North America on 22 May 2000. Nintendo arranged a number of publicity stunts, including hiring model Michele Merkin, who appeared as Joanna Dark in commercials and in-store promotions for the game. The game received a Mature rating from the Entertainment Software Rating Board, particularly for its graphic content and adult language. This generated some controversy because Nintendo has a reputation for family-friendly games. The European release followed on 30 June 2000. To supplement the game, Rare released a Game Boy Color counterpart, also titled &quot;Perfect Dark&quot;, shortly afterwards. The Game Boy Color game features a compatibility mode that allows certain cheats within the Nintendo 64 game to alternatively be unlocked via the Transfer Pak. In Japan, &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; was released on 21 October 2000.

&quot;Perfect Dark&quot; features a different box art for each regional release. Rare&#x27;s art director Kev Bayliss, who created the North American and European artworks, designed the North American version in one day because Rare needed it very quickly. He then created a more suitable Joanna Dark model for the European version and all the promotional material at the time. For the Japanese release, a completely different image was requested by Nintendo, who originally considered releasing the game in Japan under the title . &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; does not translate well into Japanese, and the title &quot;Aka to Kuro&quot; was considered sufficiently edgy. The game was ultimately released as , a transliteration of the Western title.

According to NPD&#x27;s Toy Retail Survey Tracking system, &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; was the second best-selling game of May 2000 in North America, behind &quot;Pokémon Trading Card Game&quot;. The Japanese launch saw sales totalling 35,000 units in its first week. As a bestseller, &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; joined Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Player&#x27;s Choice&quot; game selection on 21 December 2000. The game sold relatively well through the year&#x27;s holiday season, reaching No. 23 on the all formats chart for the week of 24 December 2000. As of March 2003, &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; had sold almost 1.3 million copies in the United States and 77,000 copies in Japan. Total sales in the United States reached 1.5 million by December 2007. In a 2011 interview with &quot;Eurogamer&quot;, game designer Chris Tilston revealed that lifetime sales for the game reached 3.2 million, but did not clarify if the figure accounted for units shipped to retailers.

==Reception==
&quot;Perfect Dark&quot; received critical acclaim from video game publications. The most praised aspects of the game were its graphics, artificial intelligence, and number of multiplayer options. &quot;GameSpot&quot; claimed that, as a console first-person shooter, &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; is &quot;unparalleled&quot;, while &quot;IGN&quot; journalist Matt Casamassina remarked that its extensive features set the game apart from its peers. Similarly, &quot;N64 Magazine&quot; described &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; as &quot;dauntingly huge&quot;, stating that it &quot;takes everything that made its predecessor such an enduring favourite and does it bigger, better and more often&quot;. &quot;Edge&quot; concluded that, although the game fails to be as revolutionary as its predecessor, it refines its &quot;phenomenal gameplay while massively developing its multiplayer components&quot;. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; editors called the game &quot;undeniably a work of art&quot;, suspenseful, &quot;more compelling than most action movies and much deeper than any video game of its type&quot;.

The graphics were praised for their dynamic lighting, complex geometry, varied textures, and smooth animations. &quot;IGN&quot; remarked that levels were more detailed than in &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot;, and that character models and weapons were well-animated. &quot;GameRevolution&quot; highlighted the game&#x27;s semi-realistic look, saying that it &quot;adds to the depth and addiction of the game&quot;. The game&#x27;s voiced cutscenes, surround sound effects, and atmospheric score, which was described as a mixture between the &quot;Blade Runner&quot; soundtrack by Vangelis and &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot;″s, were said to effectively bring the game to life. &quot;The Electric Playground&quot; credited Rare for being able to fit such a clear-sounding experience into the limited space of a Nintendo 64 cartridge. The four reviewers in Japanese magazine &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave the game each a seven out of ten rating, with criticism being that visuals enduced motion sickness and were inferior to graphics from the next generation of video game consoles, with the ultimate consensus was the game was only recommended for fans of the genre.

The gameplay was praised for the challenging artificial intelligence of enemies and varied level design. The enemies were admired for their use of squad tactics, ability to wait for players to come back instead of obediently chasing after them, and for ducking around a corner for cover. As with &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot;, the game&#x27;s nonlinear approach to completing mission objectives was highlighted positively, giving players freedom to deal with situations as they see fit. The multiplayer mode was seen as the strongest aspect of the game. Reviewers noted that the flexibility of options, number of gameplay modes, &quot;clever&quot; weapons, number of unlockable features, and customisable computer-controlled bots give the game an unprecedented amount of replay value. &quot;GamePro&quot; called the game&#x27;s Counter-Operative mode one of the &quot;coolest multiplayer modes ever&quot;, stating that the player playing as Joanna never knows which enemy the opposing player controls.

The game&#x27;s inconsistent frame rate was frequently criticised. According to &quot;Trigger Happy&quot; author Steven Poole, the game&#x27;s &quot;inadequate temporal resolution—owing to a wrongheaded choice to privilege visual detail over frame-rate—made it unplayable at higher difficulty levels&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; editors observed that the frame rate can be choppy in large areas or environments with many characters on screen, but felt they were too frequently caught up in the game to notice it, or else were willing to forgive it. Poole described the &quot;lazy sci-fi fetishism&quot; of Joanna Dark&#x27;s character design as &quot;a blatant and doomed attempt to steal the thunder of Lara Croft&quot;, and argued that she illustrated the challenges of characterising the protagonists of first-person shooters, a problem that &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; had avoided by using the already well-known character James Bond.

At their Best and Worst of 2000 awards, &quot;GameSpot&quot; editors awarded &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; Best Nintendo 64 Game and Best Shooting Game, and nominated it in the Best Multiplayer Game category. Rare was recognised for its work on the game and received the BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Moving Images Award for 2000, and the Golden Satellite Award for Best Interactive Product in 2001.

==Legacy==
Shortly after &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; was released, Rare planned to develop a &quot;sister&quot; title, called &quot;Velvet Dark&quot;, for either the Nintendo 64 or its successor, the GameCube, but the project never moved beyond pre-production and was ultimately abandoned. The name &quot;Velvet Dark&quot; references Joanna Dark&#x27;s alleged sister in the co-operative mode, who would have been the game&#x27;s protagonist. Meanwhile, Free Radical Design released &quot;TimeSplitters&quot; for the PlayStation 2 in October 2000, a first-person shooter based around a completely new engine. &quot;TimeSplitters&quot; bears several gameplay and presentational similarities to &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; and &quot;Perfect Dark&quot;, including a similar aiming system and unlockable options through quick level completions. After Rare was purchased by Microsoft in 2002, the company released a prequel, &quot;Perfect Dark Zero&quot;, as a launch title for the Xbox 360 in 2005. Although the game received generally positive reviews from critics, some publications felt it did not meet their expectations.

In a retrospective analysis, &quot;Edge&quot; acknowledged that the game&#x27;s frame rate and other dated elements of its design rendered it &quot;nigh-on unplayable&quot;. The magazine found the ambitious mentality which resulted in weapons and computer-controlled players being &quot;designed for possibilities rather than balance&quot;, both one of &quot;Perfect Dark&quot;″s most interesting aspects and the cause of its biggest problem: &quot;Restraint [...] would have made &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; a tighter, more focused experience, helped with those framerate issues, and removed almost all of the fun&quot;. The magazine concluded that despite &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; not standing up as a good game to play in 2009, &quot;its currency of ideas and provocation [...] remains sound&quot;. In 2015, &quot;Den of Geek&quot; considered &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; &quot;a game that&#x27;s done more for the shooter genre than often credited for&quot;, and said that the game was still ahead of its time because no game had revitalised its ideas.

Since its release, the game has attracted a following of elite players who constantly try to speedrun its levels and break world records. These records are managed by their website and involve highly skilled players exploiting tiny gameplay inconsistencies. The game is occasionally cited as one of the greatest video games of all time. In 2001, &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; editors ranked &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; 65th on their list of Top 100 Games of All Time, while &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; included it in their 2006 list of Top 200 Nintendo games. In 2007, &quot;IGN&quot; editors placed the game at No. 86 on their list of Top 100 Games of All Time, noting that &quot;Everything that &quot;GoldenEye&quot; made great, &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; did too, and then some.&quot; Similarly, &quot;Edge&quot; placed the title at No. 28 on their 2007 list of 100 Best Videogames (a list voted for by readers, &quot;Edge&quot; staff and gaming industry professionals), claiming that the game brought the Nintendo 64 era to a satisfying close. In 2009, &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; ranked it 37th on a list of 100 Best Nintendo Games.

In 2022, a fan by the name of Ryan Dwyer fully decompiled the original ROM image into C source code, allowing the game to be ported unofficially to various platforms. An unofficial PC port was released in 2023. A reboot, also titled &quot;Perfect Dark&quot;, is being developed by The Initiative.
==Remake==
A remake is in development.

==Remaster==

A remaster of the game, also titled &quot;Perfect Dark&quot;, was released in 2010 for the Xbox 360 through its Xbox Live Arcade download service, featuring an improved frame rate, enhanced graphics and online multiplayer. The remaster was developed by 4J Studios, the same studio that previously handled the Xbox 360 ports of Rare&#x27;s platform games &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; and &quot;Banjo-Tooie&quot;. The game received generally favorable reviews from gaming publications. Some critics considered the relatively unchanged game to be outdated, but most agreed that the title was a solid revival of a classic. In 2015, the remaster was included in the &quot;Rare Replay&quot; video game compilation for Xbox One.

In 2002, the CSE designed its tea party movement website, though the movement did not take off until 2009. In 2003, Dick Armey became the chairman of CSE after retiring from Congress. In 2004, Citizens for a Sound Economy split into two new organizations, with Citizens for a Sound Economy being renamed as FreedomWorks, and Citizens for a Sound Economy Foundation becoming Americans for Prosperity. Both organizations played key roles in the Tea party movement beginning in 2009.

==History==

Between 1986 and 1990, the Koch family foundations the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation, the David H. Koch Charitable Foundation, and the Claude R. Lambe Charitable Foundation granted a combined $4.8 million to the CSE.

The CSE was one of several organizations that was connected with non-profit organizations that the tobacco industry and other corporate interests worked with and provided funding for after the 1971 Powell Memorandum. The CSE was mainly funded by the tobacco, oil, energy and sugar industries, including Phillip Morris, General Electric, and Exxon. Other contributors included Microsoft and Hertz. The CSE &quot;received almost $5 million from various Koch foundations between 1986 and 1990, and David Koch and several Koch Industries employees serve[d] as directors of CSE and the CSE Foundation.&quot;

CSE briefly assumed control of the financially troubled Tax Foundation and operated it as a subsidiary from CSE&#x27;s offices until the split in 2000. Beginning in 1990, the Tax Foundation &quot;operate[d] as a separate unit&quot; of Citizens for a Sound Economy. By July 1991, the Tax Foundation was again operating as &quot;an independent 501(c)(3) organization&quot;.
OpenSecrets has no contributions listed to CSE after 2000, when it received a total of about $35,000, and zero contributions in 1998.

In 2002, CSE designed and made public a &quot;tea party&quot; website. The website stated &quot;our US Tea Party is a national event, hosted continuously online and open to all Americans who feel our taxes are too high and the tax code is too complicated&quot;. In 2003, Dick Armey became the chairman of CSE after retiring from Congress.

In 2004, Citizens for a Sound Economy split into FreedomWorks and Americans for Prosperity, according to the British newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot;. Dick Armey stayed as chairman of FreedomWorks, while David Koch stayed as chairman of Americans for Prosperity.

On July 23, 2006, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported on the organization&#x27;s tactics in signing up as members people who did not know about the organization, by enrolling them as members during unrelated insurance transactions in order to boost membership numbers. The group obtained about $638,000 and 16,000 members through the sale of insurance policies in this way, according to the report. When someone signed up for insurance through &quot;Medical Savings Insurance Company&quot;, they were also automatically signed up for Citizens for a Sound Economy without their knowledge, the report asserted. Their information is subject to be rented out as the Medical Savings Insurance Company deemed fit, which is not uncommon for many groups who obtain client contact information. Critics suggested the effort as a way for this group to inflate their membership rosters, and more exactly, by taking dues from people with no interest in the groups&#x27; politics.

==Activity==
The group produced more than 100 policy papers each year in its run, delivering them to many congressional offices, sending out thousands of pieces of mail, and getting coverage of its viewpoints in thousands of news articles around the United States. The group&#x27;s representatives appeared on hundreds of radio and television shows and published hundreds op-ed articles arguing that &quot;environmental conservation requires a commonsense approach that limits the scope of government,&quot; acid rain is a &quot;so-called threat [that] is largely nonexistent,&quot; and global warming is &quot;a verdict in search of evidence.&quot;

According to the conservative magazine Weekly Standard, CSE&#x27;s greatest political success came in 1993 when it opposed Bill Clinton&#x27;s proposal for a BTU energy tax. In addition to fighting tobacco taxes and healthcare reform, the CSE was a member organization of the Cooler Heads Coalition.

During the 2004 presidential election campaign, CNN reported that Oregon Citizens for a Sound Economy were urging George W. Bush supporters to help get Ralph Nader on the ballot in Oregon.

<doc id="198447" wikidata="Q671836" url="?curid=198447" title="Arrow (missile family)">
<text>The Arrow or Hetz (, or ) is a family of anti-ballistic missiles designed to fulfill an Israeli requirement for a missile defense system that would be more effective against ballistic missiles than the MIM-104 Patriot surface-to-air missile. Jointly funded and produced by Israel and the United States, development of the system began in 1986 and has continued since, drawing some contested criticism. Undertaken by the MALAM division of the Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) and Boeing, it is overseen by the Israeli Ministry of Defense&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Homa&quot; (, , &quot;rampart&quot;) administration and the U.S. Missile Defense Agency. It forms the long-range layer of Israel&#x27;s multi-tiered missile defence system, along with David&#x27;s Sling (at medium-to-long range) and Iron Dome and Iron Beam [experimental] (at short ranges).

The Arrow system consists of the joint production supersonic Arrow anti-missile interceptors, Arrow 2 and Arrow 3, the Elta EL/M-2080 &quot;Green Pine&quot; and &quot;Great Pine&quot; early-warning AESA radars, the Elisra &quot;Golden Citron&quot; (&quot;Citron Tree&quot;) C3I center, and the Israel Aerospace Industries &quot;Brown Hazelnut&quot; (&quot;Hazelnut Tree&quot;) launch control center. The system is mobile and can be moved to other prepared sites.

Following the construction and testing of the Arrow 1 technology demonstrator, production and deployment began with the Arrow 2 version of the missile. The Arrow is considered one of the most advanced missile defense programs in existence. It is the first operational missile defense system specifically designed and built to intercept and destroy ballistic missiles. The first Arrow battery was declared fully operational in October 2000 and is operated by the Protective Sword unit under the Air Defense Command of the Israeli Air Force (IAF). Although several of its components have been exported, the Air Defense Command is the sole user of the complete Arrow system.

The spaceflight upper-tier portion of Israel&#x27;s missile defense, Arrow 3, was declared operational on January 18, 2017. Arrow 3 operates at greater speeds, greater range and at greater altitudes than Arrow 2, intercepting ballistic missiles during the space-flight portion of their trajectory. According to the chairman of the Israeli Space Agency, Arrow 3 may serve as an anti-satellite weapon, which would make Israel one of the world&#x27;s few countries capable of shooting down satellites.

==Background==

The Arrow program was launched in light of the acquisition by Arab states of long ranged surface-to-surface missiles. It was chosen over RAFAEL Armament Development Authority&#x27;s AB-10 missile defense system since the Arrow was judged to be a more complete concept and have greater range. The AB-10 system was criticized as being merely an improved MIM-23 Hawk, rather than a system designed from the outset for missile interception.

The United States and Israel signed a memorandum of understanding to co-fund the Arrow program on May 6, 1986, and in 1988 the United States Department of Defense Strategic Defense Initiative Organization (SDIO) placed an order with Israel Aircraft Industries for the Arrow 1 technology demonstrator. The Gulf War, which exposed the controversial performance of the Patriot missile against Iraqi &quot;Al Hussein&quot; missiles, gave further impetus to the development of the Arrow. It was initially designed to intercept missiles such as the SS-1 &quot;Scud&quot;, its &quot;Al Hussein&quot; derivative, the SS-21 &quot;Scarab&quot; operated by Syria, and the CSS-2 operated by Saudi Arabia. The Arrow evolved also with an eye on the advanced missile programs of Iran. Yitzhak Rabin, then Defense Minister of Israel, viewed the emerging missile threat as one of the most dangerous future threats on Israel&#x27;s security. He said of the program that:

The Israeli Administration for the Development of Weapons and Technological Infrastructure, part of the Israeli Ministry of Defense, runs the Arrow development project under the &quot;Homa&quot; administration. The &quot;Homa&quot; administration, which is also commonly referred to as the IMDO – Israel Missile Defense Organization, is responsible for coordinating industrial activities of Israel&#x27;s different defense companies involved in the development of the Arrow system.

===Funding===

The multibillion-dollar development program of the Arrow is undertaken in Israel with the financial support of the United States. When the development program began, the projection for the total cost of its development and manufacture – including the initial production of missiles – was an estimated $1.6 billion. The price of a single Arrow missile was estimated at $3 million. Between 1989 and 2007 some $2.4 billion had been reportedly invested in the Arrow program, 50–80 percent of which was funded by the United States. Israel contributes approximately $65 million annually.

===Criticism and opposition===
The Arrow program encountered opposition from the Israeli Air Force, whose traditional doctrine of deterrence and use of preemptive strikes stand in sharp contrast with the nature of the missile. In addition, the IAF feared that the procurement of the costly missiles would diminish the resources allocated towards offensive projects such as fighter aircraft.

A criticism of the concept of missile defense for Israel was aired by Reuven Pedatzur in a comprehensive study published in 1993 by the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies. The arguments made in the study conformed to the opinions of numerous defense officials and analysts, and echoed many of the arguments made by the Strategic Defense Initiative critics in the United States.

Pedatzur argued that it was exceedingly simple to fool an Arrow-type defensive system with simple, cheap, and easily installed countermeasures, which would render the Arrow system ineffective. He doubted Israel&#x27;s defense industries could rise to the challenge of such a complex system, citing anonymous experts in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) who predicted that the system would not be available before 2010. He envisaged enormous costs, around $10 billion, that would distort budgeting priorities and divert funds from the vital enhancement of the IDF&#x27;s warfighting capability, thus forcing a profound revision of Israel&#x27;s national security doctrine. He further argued that even if effective against missiles with conventional, chemical or biological warheads, the Arrow would not be relevant against future threats of missiles with nuclear warheads, since it would never be able to supply hermetic defense and the impact of even a single nuclear warhead in Israel&#x27;s densely populated urban area would be an existential threat to Israel.

At the same time, John E. Pike, who worked then with the Federation of American Scientists, stated that &quot;given technical problems with the systems radar and command system, coupled with its high development cost, the Arrow program may soon fall by the wayside&quot;. Victoria Samson, a research associate of the Center for Defense Information, also stated in October 2002 that the Arrow system cannot track an incoming missile that has split its warhead into submunitions.

In June 2003 a group of Israeli chief engineers, co-inventors, and project managers of IAI and subcontractors were awarded the Israel Defense Prize for the development and production of the Arrow system.

According to Uzi Rubin, first Director of IMDO, with the passage of time most of the pessimistic predictions have proven to be unfounded. Israel&#x27;s defense industries overcame the technical challenge, the system&#x27;s development was completed a full decade ahead of what was predicted, and there are no indications that the expenditures for the Arrow harmed other IDF procurement plans to any degree whatsoever. Rubin insists that Israel&#x27;s missile defense is now an established fact and that most of the warnings issued by critics have failed to materialize. Pedatzur, however, remained unconvinced.

==Development==
===Arrow 1===
The first launch of the Arrow interceptor took place on August 9, 1990, designed to test the missile&#x27;s control and guidance systems. The test came to a halt seconds after takeoff and the missile was intentionally destroyed due to fears it might go off track and hit a settled location. This was caused by the failure of the ground tracking radars to track the missile&#x27;s trajectory. Test number two took place on March 25, 1991. Designed to check missile components during launch, it was conducted from a ship at sea. Once again a missile malfunction resulted in the abortion of the experiment. A third test, designed to examine the Arrow&#x27;s interception capabilities, was conducted on October 31, 1991. The missile was once again launched from a ship at sea, and was once more aborted because of a repeat of previous malfunctions.

On September 23, 1992, in another test of the missile components during launch, the systems finally operated as planned and the Arrow reached its designated point in the sky, 45 seconds after launch. As planned, the missile was then destroyed. This successful experiment ended the system&#x27;s preliminary testing phase. The fifth, sixth, and seventh tests took place on February 28, July 14, and October 14, 1993, respectively. During these, the Arrow managed to pass in close proximity to the target missiles, thereby proving its ability to intercept surface-to-surface missiles. During test number eight on March 1, 1994, the missile was not launched due to a ground computer failure. The ninth test launch on June 12, 1994, also known as ATD#1 (Arrow Demonstration Test 1), saw an Arrow 1 successfully intercepting a target missile launched from a ship anchored in the middle of the Mediterranean.

The Arrow 1 was reportedly a two-stage solid propellant missile, with an overall length of , a body diameter of , and a launch weight of around . It was estimated that the second stage had a length of , and that it had inertial and command update mid-course guidance, with a terminal infrared focal plane array. The missile was described as being relatively high-speed and maneuverable, with thrust vectoring in both stages. The range capability has been described as around . On the other hand, the Arrow 1 could be a single stage missile. Development of the &quot;big and cumbersome&quot; Arrow 1 then ceased and further research continued with the &quot;smaller, faster and more lethal&quot; Arrow 2.

===Arrow 2===

Two successful tests (designated IIT#21 and IIT#22) of the steering, control and cruising systems were conducted without target missiles on July 30, 1995, and February 20, 1996. Two successful interceptions took place on August 20, 1996, and March 11, 1997, and were designated AIT#21 and AIT#22.
Another interception test (AIT#23) was conducted on August 20, 1997, but the missile was destroyed when its steering system malfunctioned. The fault was corrected in time to ensure the success of AST#3, the first comprehensive test of the entire system. On September 14, 1998, all system components successfully countered a computer-simulated threat. On November 29, 1998, Israel Aerospace Industries delivered the first operational Arrow 2 interceptor to the Israeli Ministry of Defense.

A full system interception test (AST#4) was held on November 1, 1999. During this test the Arrow system located, tracked and intercepted a TM-91C target missile simulating a &quot;Scud&quot; missile, launched on a very steep trajectory from a ship located offshore. The IAI TM-91C target missile was itself based on the Arrow 1 interceptor. On March 14, 2000, the first complete Arrow 2 battery was rolled out in a ceremony at Palmachim Airbase. In his speech, then IAF commander Aluf Eitan Ben Eliyahu said:
Another Arrow 2 test (AST#5) took place on September 14, 2000, this time with a new target missile, the Rafael Advanced Defense Systems &quot;Black Sparrow&quot;. This airborne ballistic target missile, launched by an IAF F-15 towards Israel&#x27;s coastline at a ballistic trajectory simulating an aggressor &quot;Scud&quot;, was intercepted and destroyed. Consequently, the following month saw the Palmachim Arrow battery declared operational by the Israeli Air Defense Command. The &quot;Black Sparrow&quot; has since been used as the aggressor target in the AST#6, AST#9, and AST#10 tests. Reportedly, in June 2001 Arrow missiles were test-fired in the course of a joint American-Israeli-Turkish exercise code-named Anatolian Eagle, in the southeast of Turkey. On August 27, 2001 (AST#6), the Arrow system successfully intercepted its target at some from shore, the highest and farthest that the Arrow 2 had been tested to date. In October 2002 the second battery was declared operational.

====Block-2====

A successful test of the Arrow 2 block-2 took place on January 5, 2003 (AST#8). Four missiles were launched towards four simulated targets in order to examine the interceptor&#x27;s performance during special flight conditions as well as system performance during a sequence of launches. The test did not include actual interceptions. Another successful test held on December 16, 2003 (AST#9), examined the system&#x27;s ability to intercept and destroy incoming missiles at significantly high altitudes, around . Reportedly, AST#8 and AST#9 also tested integration of the Arrow with Patriot batteries.

On July 29, 2004, Israel and the United States carried out a joint test at the Naval Air Station Point Mugu (NAS Point Mugu) Missile Test Center in California, in which the Arrow interceptor was launched against a real &quot;Scud-B&quot; missile. The test represented a realistic scenario that could not have been tested in Israel due to test-field safety restrictions. To enable the test a full battery was shipped to Point Mugu. The &quot;Green Pine&quot; radar and command-and-control systems were deployed at the base, while the Arrow launcher was installed offshore on an island that forms part of the test range. The test was a success, with the interceptor destroying the &quot;Scud&quot; that flew a trajectory at an altitude of , west of San Nicolas Island. This was the twelfth Arrow interceptor test and the seventh test of the complete system, the first interception of a real &quot;Scud&quot;. This significant test became known as the AST USFT#1. Following this test, then Defense Minister of Israel, Shaul Mofaz, said:
AST USFT#2 was conducted at NAS Point Mugu a month later, on August 26. This test was aimed at examining the Arrow&#x27;s ability to detect a splitting warhead of a separating ballistic missile. It detected the true target, but a technical malfunction reportedly prevented it from maneuvering to strike it, leading to a suspension of testing. In March–April 2005 the ability of &quot;Green Pine&quot; and &quot;Golden Citron&quot; to work with Patriot system elements operated by U.S. Army was successfully tested against simulated &quot;Scud&quot;-type targets during regular series of U.S.–Israeli biennial exercises code-named &quot;Juniper Cobra&quot;. Actual testing of the complete Arrow system was resumed in December 2005, when the system successfully intercepted a target at an unspecified but reported record low altitude. This test (AST#10) was the fourteenth test of the Arrow missile and the ninth test of the complete system.

====Block-3====

On February 11, 2007, an Arrow 2 block-3 successfully intercepted and destroyed a &quot;Black Sparrow&quot; target missile simulating a ballistic missile at high altitude. It was the first so-called distributed weapon system test conducted in Israel, which required two Arrow units deployed some apart to share data on incoming threats and coordinate launching assignments. It was also the first time the Link 16 data distribution system was used to connect two Arrow units, although the system had been used in previous tests to connect Arrow and Patriot batteries. Furthermore, an improved launcher was used. Another &quot;Juniper Cobra&quot; exercises ran from March 10 to 20, 2007. The computer simulation used for &quot;Juniper Cobra 2007&quot; was similar to the computer simulation used in &quot;Juniper Cobra 2005&quot;.

A precursor of the next block was launched without a target on March 26, 2007, in order to gather information on its flight and performance, introducing unspecified modifications to its hardware and electronics and reduced manufacturing costs by some 20 percent. Arieh Herzog, then Director of IMDO, has said: &quot;Our Arrow operational system can without a doubt deal with all of the operational threats in the Middle East, particularly in Iran and Syria.&quot;

====Block-4====
On April 15, 2008, the Arrow weapon system successfully detected and made a simulated intercept of a new target missile, the &quot;Blue Sparrow&quot;, a successor of the &quot;Black Sparrow&quot; capable of simulating &quot;Scud-C/D&quot; missiles and reportedly the Iranian Shahab-3 as well. During the test, a target missile was launched from an IAF F-15 at a height of 90,000 feet (27.5 km). The missile split into multiple warheads, making it harder to intercept it. Nevertheless, &quot;Green Pine&quot; tracked the warhead, simulating an intercept. In September 2008 the IDF attempted a test of actual Arrow 2 block-4 missile against the &quot;Blue Sparrow&quot;. The drill had to be aborted, however, when the target missile malfunctioned shortly after launch. Eventually the Arrow 2 block-4 was successfully tested against the &quot;Blue Sparrow&quot; on April 7, 2009.
A July 22, 2009, joint test of the Arrow 2 block-4 against an airborne target missile with a range of over once again at the NAS Point Mugu, was reportedly aborted in the final second before launch after the missile failed to establish a communications link. A target had been released from a C-17 Globemaster III aircraft, the radar detected the target and transferred its tracks, but the interceptor was not launched. &quot;Tracking of the target worked well, but tracking trajectory information that the radar transferred to the battle management center erroneously showed we would be out of the prescribed safety range, so the mission was aborted,&quot; a program source said. The aborted interception came after two earlier setbacks in the planned test, initially scheduled for July 17. The first try was scuttled due to a technical glitch in the C-17 aircraft, and a planned July 20 attempt was scrubbed due to a malfunctioning electric battery that was not providing enough power to a key element of the Arrow system. The test was widely referred to as a failure, however objectives of interoperability with other ballistic missile defense systems were achieved.

On February 22, 2011, the Arrow system successfully intercepted a long-range ballistic target missile during a flight test conducted at NAS Point Mugu. The target missile was launched from a mobile launch platform off the coast of California, within the Point Mugu test range. The test validated new block-4 versions designed to improve discriminating capabilities of the Arrow 2 interceptor. It was a body-to-body impact that completely destroyed the target.

On February 10, 2012, developers successfully conducted the final target-tracking test prior to delivery of block-4 Arrow system. The Blue Sparrow target missile was detected and tracked by the radar, the intercept solutions were plotted by the battle management controller and transferred to the launch units.

According to Arieh Herzog, block-4 upgrades &quot;improve the process of discrimination of what happens in the sky and the transmission of target data for much better situational control.&quot; Block-4 upgrades also refine midcourse guidance which, when coupled with improved target identification and discrimination capabilities, improves lethality.

Block-4.1 is expected to include a new Battle Management Center, armored launchers with high shooting availability, better communication with other missile systems and wider ranges of interceptions. On September 9, 2014, an intercept test was conducted over the Mediterranean Sea with block-4.1 versions of the operational system. The outcome was inconclusive and remained so until data was fully analyzed. In February 2015, an official at the IMDO acknowledged that a test successfully acquired, but narrowly missed its target. The exact reason behind the failure was not provided, but officials initially attributed the glitch to easily correctable software issues.

====Block-5====

By April 2011 IMDO launched initial definition of a new block-5 upgrade to the complete Arrow system that will merge the lower-tier Arrow 2 and exoatmospheric Arrow 3 into a single national missile defense system. According to Arieh Herzog, the planned block-5 will include new ground- and airborne sensors, a command and control system, and a new target missile – the Silver Sparrow – to simulate potentially nuclear-capable delivery vehicles developed by Iran. According to the U.S. Missile Defense Agency, block-5 is expected to be able to deal with &quot;more stressing regional threats&quot; by increasing total defended area by some 50 percent.

The planned block-5 will optimize the existing Super Green Pine radar to operate with the AN/TPY-2 radar as well as with radars commanding anti-ballistic missiles aboard United States Navy destroyers. U.S. radars will be used to support closed-loop operations if Israel and U.S. targets in the region come under attack.

Another successful Arrow 2 test (AST#18a) took place on August 12, 2020, over the Mediterranean Sea.

===Arrow 3===
By August 2008 the United States and Israeli governments have initiated development of an upper-tier component to the Israeli Air Defense Command, known as Arrow 3. The development is based on an architecture definition study conducted in 2006–2007, determining the need for the upper-tier component to be integrated into Israel&#x27;s ballistic missile defense system. According to Arieh Herzog, the main element of this upper tier will be an exoatmospheric interceptor, to be jointly developed by IAI and Boeing. Arrow 3 was declared operational on January 18, 2017.

Arrow 3 operates at greater speeds, greater range and at greater altitudes than Arrow 2, intercepting ballistic missiles during the space-flight portion of their trajectory. According to the chairman of the Israeli Space Agency, Arrow 3 may serve as an anti-satellite weapon, which would make Israel one of the world&#x27;s few countries capable of shooting down satellites.

===Arrow 4===
Israel&#x27;s Defense Ministry and industry developers have begun early work on what could evolve into the Arrow 4, a new missile-intercepting system to defend against much more sophisticated future threats. In 2017 Boaz Levy, IAI executive vice president, said it was probably too early to call the effort Arrow 4. Nevertheless, he acknowledged that ongoing design studies are aimed at a future interceptor that will extend capabilities beyond Arrow 2 and Arrow 3.

In early 2021 Israel revealed that the development of the Arrow 4 interceptor was ongoing and that the system was targeting the interception of hypersonic threats such as hypersonic cruise missiles and hypersonic glide vehicles. Efforts to counter hypersonic threats took on new urgency following a November 2022 announcement by Iran that they had tested a hypersonic missile, although its authenticity is disputed; such a missile launched from Iran could hit Israel in as little as four minutes.

=== Arrow 5 ===
According to Boaz Levy CEO of the company, Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) is working on the Arrow 5.

==Specifications==

The Arrow system was originally designed and optimized to intercept short and medium-range ballistic missiles with ranges above . It is not intended to intercept either military aircraft or artillery rockets, the second of which are relatively small and short ranged. In contrast to THAAD, RIM-161 Standard Missile 3, and MIM-104 Patriot PAC-3, that use kinetic, direct impact to destroy the target (&quot;hit-to-kill&quot;) the Arrow 2 relies on explosive detonation. Arrow 2 is able to intercept its targets above the stratosphere, high enough so that any nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons do not scatter over Israel. The developers&#x27; intention was to perform the destruction sequence away from populated locations. According to Dr. Uzi Rubin, the missile was tested to determine whether chemical warfare agents would reach the ground should such a warhead be intercepted. The conclusion was that nothing would reach the ground if the warhead is destroyed above the jet stream, which flows from west to east and would therefore blow any chemical residue. Nevertheless, Arrow is also capable of low altitude interception, as well as multi-tactical ballistic missiles interception.

The two-stage missile is equipped with solid propellant booster and sustainer rocket motors. The missile uses an initial burn to carry out a vertical hot launch from the container and a secondary burn to sustain the missile&#x27;s trajectory towards the target at a speed of Mach 9, or . Thrust vector control is used in the boost and sustainer phases of flight. At the ignition of the second stage sustainer motor, the first stage assembly separates. The Arrow missile is launched before the threat missile&#x27;s trajectory and intercept point are accurately known. As more trajectory data becomes available, the optimum intercept point is more precisely defined, towards which the missiles is then guided. The kill vehicle section of the missile, containing the warhead, fusing and the terminal seeker, is equipped with four moving delta aerodynamic control fins to give low altitude interception capability. The dual mode missile seeker has a passive infrared seeker for the acquisition and tracking of tactical ballistic missiles and an active radar seeker used to home on air-breathing targets at low altitudes. The infrared seeker is an indium antimonide focal plane array. The kill vehicle is designed to achieve a hit-to-kill interception, but if this is not achieved, the proximity fuze will direct the warhead fragments at the target shortly before reaching the closest point to the target. The high explosive directed blast fragmentation warhead is capable of destroying a target within a radius. In this manner, Arrow also differs from Patriot PAC-3, THAAD, and Standard Missile 3, which rely purely on hit-to-kill technology in which the kinetic force of a precise impact causes the destruction of the threat.

According to Dov Raviv, a senior developer dubbed &quot;the father of the Arrow anti-ballistic missile&quot;, a single Arrow interceptor has a 90 percent probability of destroying a target missile at the highest altitude possible. In case of failure two more interceptors can be launched towards the target at short time intervals. If the first of these destroys the target, the second can be directed to another target. Using this technique, three independent interception possibilities are provided which raise the interception probability from 90 percent to 99.9 percent, thus satisfying the leakage rate requirement. The Arrow also has the capability to simultaneously intercept a salvo of more than five incoming missiles, with the target missiles arriving within a 30-second span. Such capability is currently possessed only by the United States and Russia. According to Raviv, the Arrow can discriminate between a warhead and a decoy.

Each Arrow battery is equipped with typically four to eight erectors–launchers, its manning requires about 100 personnel. Each trailer-mounted erector–launcher weighs when loaded with six launch tubes with ready-to-fire missiles. After firing the launchers can be reloaded in an hour. The system is transportable rather than mobile, as it can be moved to other prepared sites, but cannot be set up just anywhere.

===Green Pine===

The &quot;Green Pine&quot; is an active electronically scanned array (AESA) solid state radar operating at L band in the range 500 MHz to 1,000 MHz, or 1,000 MHz to 2,000 MHz. It operates in search, detection, tracking, and missile guidance modes simultaneously. It is capable of detecting targets at ranges of up to about and is able to track more than 30 targets at speeds over . The radar illuminates the target and guides the Arrow missile to within of the target.

;Super Green Pine
An advanced version of the radar, called &quot;Super Green Pine&quot;, &quot;Green Pine&quot; Block-B, or &quot;Great Pine&quot; (, ), is to take the place of the original &quot;Green Pine. As of 2008 both versions were active. The &quot;Super Green Pine&quot; extends detection range to about . An even more advanced upgrade of the Super Green Pine is under development.

===Golden Citron===
The &quot;Golden Citron&quot; (, ) truck-mounted net-centric open systems architecture Battle Management Command, Control, Communication &amp; Intelligence Center can control up to 14 intercepts simultaneously. As of 2007 it was one of the world&#x27;s most advanced net-centric systems. The system provides fully automatic as well as Human-in-the-Loop options at every stage of battle operation management. It is also capable of interoperability with other theater missile defense systems and C3I systems. Notably Link 16, TADIL-J, communications were being altered to allow interoperability with Patriot fire control units. Assigned targets can be handed over to the Patriot&#x27;s AN/MPQ-53 fire control radar. Tests carried out by the U.S and Israel have successfully linked the Arrow with both U.S and Israeli versions of the Patriot.

The &quot;Citron Tree&quot; has three banks of operator consoles laid out in a U shape. In the center sits the officer in command who oversees the engagement, but also has links to the other parts of the battery as well as to IAF headquarters. On the commander&#x27;s right sits the engagement officer, who ensures that targets are assigned to other engagement officers sitting on the right-hand leg of the U. Each is assigned a geographical area to defend and two of the officers are more senior as they have an overview of Patriot batteries. To the left of the commander is the resource officer, who monitors the status and readiness of the missiles. On the left of the U sits the sky picture officer, who is in contact with the Home Front Command and uses the center&#x27;s ability to predict impact point to alert the civil authorities. Also at these consoles are an intelligence officer and an after-action/debrief officer, who uses recordings as it is impossible to absorb all the information during engagements. All in all, the &quot;Golden Citron&quot; is manned by 7–10 operators.

===Brown Hazelnut===
The &quot;Brown Hazelnut&quot; (, ) launch control center is located at the launch site, up to from the &quot;Golden Citron&quot; fire control center. It employs microwave and radio data and voice communications links to the &quot;Green Pine&quot; and &quot;Golden Citron&quot;. The launch method is a vertical hot launch from a sealed canister, providing all-azimuth coverage. &quot;Brown Hazelnut&quot; also has missile maintenance and diagnostic capabilities.

==Production==

Israel initially produced the Arrow system domestically, but on February 11, 2003, IAI and Boeing signed an agreement, valued at over $25 million for fiscal years 2003–2004, to establish production facilities for the manufacture of components for the Arrow missile in the United States. In March 2004, IAI awarded a $78 million production contract to Boeing; the total contract value could exceed $225 million through second quarter 2008. As a result of successful implementation of this contract Boeing is responsible for production of about 35 percent of Arrow missile components, including the electronics section, booster motor case and missile canister, at its Huntsville, Alabama, facilities. IAI, the prime contractor of the Arrow system, is responsible for integration and the final assembly of the Arrow missile in Israel. Boeing also coordinates the production of Arrow missile components manufactured by more than 150 American companies located in over 25 states. Boeing delivered its first Arrow 2 interceptor to Israel in 2005. Co-produced interceptors has been tested since February 12, 2007. Final deliveries to the Israel Air Force were planned by the end of 2010.

Other major contractors are:
* Elta – produces the &quot;Green Pine&quot; / &quot;Super Green Pine&quot; radar;
* Elisra – produces the &quot;Golden Citron&quot; C3I Center;
* Rafael Advanced Defense Systems – produces the sustainer motor and the warhead;
* Israel Military Industries – produces the booster motor;
* Alliant Techsystems – produces the motor cases and the first stage nozzle;
* Lockheed Martin – produces the active radar seeker;
* Raytheon – produces the infrared seeker;
* Ceradyne – produces the ceramic radome.

==Deployment==
According to its original 1986 schedule, the Arrow system was supposed to enter operational service in 1995. The first operational Arrow battery was deployed, however, in March 2000 in Palmachim Airbase, near the city of Rishon LeZion, south of the Tel Aviv metropolitan area. It was declared operational in October 2000, and reached its full capacity in March 2001. Deployment of the second battery at Ein Shemer Airfield, near the city of Hadera, Haifa District, northern Israel, was delayed by strong opposition from local residents who feared its radar would be hazardous to their health. The situation was eventually resolved and Israel&#x27;s second battery completed its deployment, turned operational and linked up with first battery in October 2002. In 2007 the IDF has reportedly decided to modify its missile defense doctrine and in order to counter possible Syrian and Iranian missile barrages and has quietly modified its deployment of the Arrow in northern Israel.

The IDF planned to procure 50–100 interceptors for each battery. As of 1998, a battery was estimated to cost about $170 million. As of 2012, reportedly one &quot;Great Pine&quot; radar is deployed alongside two &quot;Green Pine&quot; radars.

Israel had originally planned to deploy two Arrow 2 batteries but has since sought and won promises of funding for a third battery. Some reports stated that a third battery was already deployed, or in development in the south, while others claimed that a decision on deployment of a third battery has not yet been made, although it was under discussion for service entry in 2012. Another report stated that Israel planned to deploy not one, but two additional Arrow 2 batteries to defend the country&#x27;s southern region, also covering sensitive sites such as the Negev Nuclear Research Center. However the decision about the third battery was taken in October 2010. The new battery was expected to be put into operational use in 2012 in the center of the country. According to &quot;Jane&#x27;s Defence Weekly&quot;, some sources indicate that the new Arrow 2 battery became operational in 2012 in an Israeli Air Force facility at Tal Shahar, roughly halfway between Jerusalem and Ashdod, near Beit Shemesh.

===Export===
Apart from Israel, no country has purchased a full Arrow system, although India had acquired and deployed three &quot;Green Pine&quot; radars by August 2005. The Indian government has sought to purchase the Arrow system since 1999, however in early 2002 the U.S. vetoed Israel&#x27;s request to sell the Arrow 2 missiles to India, exercising its right as a major funding contributor. U.S. officials argued that the sale would violate the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR). Although the Arrow 2 could possibly achieve a range of , it is designed for intercepts at shorter ranges, and it is unclear whether it could carry a payload to this range specified in the MTCR. In 2011 once again an Indian Army official said that the Arrow 2 might become part of India&#x27;s missile defense solution.

Turkey also planned to buy anti-missile air defense systems worth more than $1 billion. The Arrow was considered a potential contender, but was rejected on political grounds. In the past, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Singapore were mentioned as then potential foreign customers of the Arrow system. Netherlands reportedly expressed interest in the &quot;Golden Citron&quot; C3I center in November 1999.

In the late 1990s officials of Jordan expressed concern that any conflagration between Israel and Iraq or Iran would impact its territory. The problem becomes more difficult for Jordan when the warheads are not conventional. Therefore, Benjamin Netanyahu, during his first term of office as Prime Minister of Israel, reportedly offered Jordan &quot;a defensive umbrella of Arrow 2&quot;. Without allowing Israel to forward deploy the Arrow launchers close to the Iraqi border, the other option is for Israel to sell Jordan the Arrow system. This is most likely what Prime Minister Netanyahu meant above. In May 1999 Israel reportedly requested U.S. approval for selling Arrow batteries to Jordan, but apparently no such approval has been given.

Armed with marketing approval by their respective governments, a U.S.–Israeli industrial team plans to offer the Arrow system to South Korea. The potential deal, estimated to exceed $1 billion.

For the United States, the Arrow has provided important technical and operational data. It remains a key element in the Missile Defense Agency&#x27;s plan for a layered missile defense architecture, and an example of a successful, affordable program. At the moment, however, the United States does not have any plans to procure and deploy the Arrow. Nevertheless, in September 2009 the Arrow system was mentioned by then U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and then Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General James Cartwright among the alternative to the proposed U.S. missile defense assets in Europe. The Arrow system is being incorporated into U.S. anti-ballistic capability in Europe, they said.

In a June 2011 interview Lieutenant General Patrick J. O&#x27;Reilly said that Arrow 2 will be integrated into a regional defense array planned by the U.S. in the Middle East. According to the interview, it may also protect Arab countries who are allies of the U.S. but with which Israel has no diplomatic ties. By October 2015, the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) had become interested in procuring the Arrow system for themselves.

In the face of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which began in February 2022, the German government is considering the purchase of the Arrow-3 system for the Bundeswehr. Since it is available on the market, it could be operational in Germany as early as 2025. For the missile protection shield, &quot;Super Green Pine&quot; missile radar systems would be installed at three locations in Germany, which would send their data to the Combined Air Operations Centre in Uedem. The German Arrow batteries could also cover Poland, Romania and/or the Baltic States. Neighbouring countries would then have to buy additional Arrow-3 missiles, whereas the radar image would be supplied by the German forces. According to a report in the newspaper &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; dated April 5, 2022, Israel and the United States have agreed in principle to sell the Arrow-3 system to Germany.

In June 2023 the German Bundestag approved the purchase of the Arrow 3 system for the German Air Force. Deliveries are expected for late 2025.

==Operational history==

On March 17, 2017, the Arrow missile scored its first operational intercept when it shot down a Syrian S-200 missile fired at an Israeli aircraft. A senior IAF officer provided operational context to the unusual intercept of a surface-to-air missile. The officer said the S-200 missile &quot;behaved like a ballistic threat&quot; with &quot;an altitude, range and ballistic trajectory&quot; that mimicked the Scud-class targets the Arrow 2 interceptor was designed to kill.

On October 31, 2023, an Arrow 2 missile intercepted a long-range ballistic missile launched at Israel from Houthis in Yemen. This was Arrow 2’s first operational use during a war, and its first successful interception.
On November 9, 2023, an Arrow 3 missile made its first successful interception, of a Ghadr-110 missile heading for the country’s southernmost city of Eilat.

On April 13, 2024, the Arrow missile defense system intercepted long-range ballistic missiles during Iran&#x27;s Operation True Promise. Iran&#x27;s attack included 120 ballistic missiles, 170 attack drones and 30 cruise missiles aimed at Israel. The successful interception of missiles by the Arrow system was part of a coordinated defense effort involving multiple other missile defense systems and international support from the U.S., Britain, and France which effectively prevented serious damage or casualties in Israel.

On October 1, 2024, the Arrow missile defense system intercepted long-range ballistic missiles during the October 2024 Iranian strikes against Israel. Iran&#x27;s attack included 181 ballistic missiles deployed over two waves aimed at Israel.

<text>The Eight Banners (in Manchu: &quot;jakūn gūsa&quot;, , ) were administrative and military divisions under the Later Jin and Qing dynasties of China into which all Manchu households were placed. In war, the Eight Banners functioned as armies, but the banner system was also the basic organizational framework of all of Manchu society. Created in the early 17th century by Nurhaci, the banner armies played an instrumental role in his unification of the fragmented Jurchen people (who would later be renamed the &quot;Manchu&quot; under Nurhaci&#x27;s son Hong Taiji) and in the Qing dynasty&#x27;s conquest of the Ming dynasty.

As Mongol and Han forces were incorporated into the growing Qing military establishment, the Mongol Eight Banners and Han Eight Banners were created alongside the original Manchu banners. The banner armies were considered the elite forces of the Qing military, while the remainder of imperial troops were incorporated into the vast Green Standard Army. Membership in the banners became hereditary, and bannermen were granted land and income. After the defeat of the Ming dynasty, Qing emperors continued to rely on the Eight Banners in their subsequent military campaigns. After the Ten Great Campaigns of the mid-18th century the quality of the banner armies declined. Their failure to suppress the Taiping Rebellion of the mid-19th century ruined their reputation. By the late 19th century the task of defending the empire had largely fallen upon regional armies such as the Xiang Army. Over time, the Eight Banners became synonymous with Manchu identity even as their military strength vanished.

==History==

===Establishment===
Initially, Nurhaci&#x27;s forces were organized into small hunting parties of about a dozen men related by blood, marriage, clan, or place of residence, as was the typical Jurchen custom. In 1601, with the number of men under his command growing, Nurhaci reorganized his troops into companies of 300 households. Five companies made up a battalion, and ten battalions a banner. Four banners were originally created: Yellow, White, Red, and Blue, each named after the color of its flag. By 1614, the number of companies had grown to around 400. In 1615, the number of banners was doubled through the creation of &quot;bordered&quot; banners. The troops of each of the original four banners would be split between a plain and a bordered banner. The bordered variant of each flag was to have a red border, except for the Bordered Red Banner, which had a white border instead.

The banner armies expanded rapidly after a string of military victories under Nurhaci and his successors. Beginning in the late 1620s, the Jurchens incorporated allied and conquered Mongol tribes into the Eight Banner system. In 1635, Hong Taiji, son of Nurhaci, renamed his people from Jurchen to Manchu. That same year the Mongols were separated into the Mongol Eight Banners (Manchu: , &quot;monggo gūsa&quot;; ; ).

===Invasions of Korea===

Under Hong Taiji, the banner armies participated in two invasions of Joseon in the Korean Peninsula first in 1627 and again in 1636. As a consequence, Joseon was forced to end its relationship with the Ming and become a Qing tributary instead.

===Conquest of the Ming dynasty===

Initially, Han troops were incorporated into the existing Manchu Banners. When Hong Taiji captured Yongping in 1629, a contingent of artillerymen surrendered to him. In 1631, these troops were organized into the so-called Old Han Army under the Han commander Tong Yangxing. These artillery units were used decisively to defeat Ming general Zu Dashou&#x27;s forces at the siege of Dalinghe that same year. In 1636, Hong Taiji proclaimed the creation of the Qing dynasty.

Between 1637 and 1642, the Old Han Army, mostly made up of Liaodong natives who had surrendered at Yongping, Fushun, Dalinghe, etc., were organized into the Han Eight Banners (Manchu: &quot;nikan cooha&quot; or &quot;ujen cooha&quot;; ; ). The original Eight Banners were thereafter referred to as the Manchu Eight Banners (Manchu: , &quot;manju gūsa&quot;; ; ). Although still called the &quot;Eight Banners&quot; in name, there were now effectively twenty-four banner armies, eight for each of the three main ethnic groups (Manchu, Mongol, and Han).

Among the Banners gunpowder weapons, such as muskets and artillery, were specifically wielded by the Han Banners.

After Hong Taiji&#x27;s death, Dorgon, commander of the Solid White Banner, became regent. He quickly purged his rivals and took control over Hong Taiji&#x27;s Solid Blue Banner. By 1644, an estimated two million people were living in the Eight Banners system. That year, rebels led by Li Zicheng captured Beijing, and the last emperor of the Ming dynasty, Chongzhen, committed suicide. Dorgon and his bannermen joined forces with Ming defector Wu Sangui to defeat Li at the Battle of Shanhai Pass and secure Beijing for the Qing. The young Shunzhi Emperor was then enthroned in the Forbidden City.

Ming defectors played a major role in the Qing conquest of the Central Plain. Ethnic Han generals who defected to the Qing were often given women from the imperial Aisin Gioro family in marriage while the ordinary soldiers who defected were given non-royal Manchu women as wives. The Qing differentiated between Han bannermen and ordinary Han civilians. Han bannermen were made out of ethnic Han who defected to the Qing up to 1644 and joined the Eight Banners, giving them social and legal privileges in addition to being acculturated to Manchu culture. So many Han defected to the Qing and swelled up the ranks of the Eight Banners that ethnic Manchus became a minority within the Banners, making up only 16% in 1648, with Han bannermen dominating with 75% and Mongol bannermen making up the rest. It was this multi-ethnic force, in which Manchus were only a minority, which conquered the Central Plain for the Qing. Hong Taiji recognized that Han defectors were needed by the Qing in order to assist in the conquest of the Ming, explaining to other Manchus why he needed to treat the Ming defector General Hung Ch&#x27;eng-ch&#x27;ou leniently.

The Qing showed in propaganda targeted towards the Ming military that the Qing valued military skills to get them to defect to the Qing, since the Ming civilian political system discriminated against the military. The three Liaodong Han Bannermen officers who played a massive role in the conquest of southern China from the Ming were Shang Kexi, Geng Zhongming, and Kong Youde and they governed southern China autonomously as viceroys for the Qing after their conquests. Normally the Manchu Bannermen acted as reserve forces while the Qing foremost used defected Han troops to fight as the vanguard during their conquest of the Central Plain.

The Liaodong Han military frontiersmen were prone to mixing and acculturating with (non-Han) tribesmen. The Mongol officer Mangui served in the Ming military and fought the Manchus, dying in battle against a Manchu raid. The Manchus accepted and assimilated Han soldiers who defected. Liaodong Han transfrontiersmen soldiers acculturated to Manchu culture and used Manchu names. Manchus lived in cities with walls surrounded by villages and adopted Han-style agriculture before the Qing conquest of the Ming. The Han transfrontismen abandoned their Han names and identities and Nurhaci&#x27;s secretary Dahai might have been one of them.

There were not enough ethnic Manchus to conquer the Central Plain, so they relied on defeating and absorbing Mongols, and more importantly, adding Han to the Eight Banners. The Qing had to create an entire &quot;Jiu Han jun&quot; (Old Han Army) due to the massive number of Han soldiers who were absorbed into the Eight Banners by both capture and defection, Ming artillery was responsible for many victories against the Qing, so the Qing established an artillery corps made out of Han soldiers in 1641 and the swelling of Han numbers in the Eight Banners led in 1642 of all Eight Han Banners being created. It was defected Han armies which conquered southern China for the Qing.

When Dorgon ordered Han civilians to vacate Beijing&#x27;s inner city and move to the outskirts, he resettled the inner city with the Bannermen, including Han bannermen, later, some exceptions were made to allowing to reside in the inner city Han civilians who held government or commercial jobs.

The Qing relied on the Green Standard soldiers, made out of defected Ming military forces who joined the Qing, in order to help rule northern China. It was Green Standard Han troops who actively military governed China locally while Han Bannermen, Mongol Bannermen, and Manchu Bannermen who were only brought into emergency situations where there was sustained military resistance.

Manchu Aisin Gioro princesses were also married to Han official&#x27;s sons.

The Manchu Prince Regent Dorgon gave a Manchu woman as a wife to the Han official Feng Quan, who had defected from the Ming to the Qing. The Manchu queue hairstyle was willingly adopted by Feng Quan before it was enforced on the Han population and Feng learned the Manchu language.

To promote ethnic harmony, a 1648 decree from the Shunzhi Emperor allowed Han civilian men to marry Manchu women from the Banners with the permission of the Board of Revenue if they were registered daughters of officials or commoners or the permission of their banner company captain if they were unregistered commoners. It was only later in the dynasty that these policies allowing intermarriage were done away with. The decree was formulated by Dorgon.

The Guangzhou massacre of Ming loyalist Han forces and civilians in 1650 by Qing forces, was entirely carried out by Han Bannermen led by Han generals Shang Kexi and Geng Jimao.

The Qing sent Han Bannermen to fight against Koxinga&#x27;s Ming loyalists in Fujian. The Qing carried out massive depopulation policy clearances forcing people to evacuated the coast in order to deprive Koxinga&#x27;s Ming loyalists of resources, this has led to a myth that it was because Manchus were &quot;afraid of water&quot;. In Fujian, it was Han Bannermen who were the ones carrying out the fighting and killing for the Qing and this disproved the entirely irrelevant claim that alleged fear of the water on part of the Manchus had to do with the coastal evacuation and clearances. Even though a poem refers to the soldiers carrying out massacres in Fujian as &quot;barbarian&quot;, both Han Green Standard Army and Han Bannermen were involved in the fighting for the Qing side and carried out the worst slaughter. 400,000 Green Standard Army soldiers were used against the Three Feudatories besides 200,000 Bannermen.

===Revolt of the Three Feudatories===

In the Revolt of the Three Feudatories Manchu Generals and Bannermen were initially put to shame by the better performance of the Han Green Standard Army, who fought better than them against the rebels and this was noted by the Kangxi Emperor, leading him to task Generals Sun Sike, Wang Jinbao, and Zhao Liangdong to lead Green Standard soldiers to crush the rebels. The Qing thought that Han were superior at battling other Han people and so used the Green Standard Army as the dominant and majority army in crushing the rebels instead of Bannermen. In northwestern China against Wang Fuchen, the Qing put Bannermen in the rear as reserves while they used Han Green Standard Army soldiers and Han Generals like Zhang Liangdong, Wang Jinbao, and Zhang Yong as the primary military forces, considering Han troops as better at fighting other Han people, and these Han generals achieved victory over the rebels. Sichuan and southern Shaanxi were retaken by the Han Green Standard Army under Wang Jinbao and Zhao Liangdong in 1680, with Manchus only participating in dealing with logistics and provisions. 400,000 Green Standard Army soldiers and 150,000 Bannermen served on the Qing side during the war. 213 Han Banner companies, and 527 companies of Mongol and Manchu Banners were mobilized by the Qing during the revolt.

The Qing forces were crushed by Wu from 1673 to 1674. The Qing had the support of the majority of Han soldiers and Han elite against the Three Feudatories, since they refused to join Wu Sangui in the revolt, while the Eight Banners and Manchu officers fared poorly against Wu Sangui, so the Qing responded with using a massive army of more than 900,000 Han (non-Banner) instead of the Eight Banners, to fight and crush the Three Feudatories. Wu Sangui&#x27;s forces were crushed by the Green Standard Army, made out of defected Ming soldiers.

===Territorial expansion===
Koxinga&#x27;s rattan shield troops became famous for fighting and defeating the Dutch in Taiwan. After the surrender of Koxinga&#x27;s former followers on Taiwan, Koxinga&#x27;s grandson Zheng Keshuang and his troops were incorporated into the Eight Banners. His rattan shield soldiers (Tengpaiying) 藤牌营 were used against the Russian Cossacks at Albazin.

Under the Kangxi and Qianlong emperors, the Eight Banners participated in a series of military campaigns to subdue Ming loyalists and neighboring states. In the Qianlong Emperor&#x27;s celebrated Ten Great Campaigns, the banner armies fought alongside troops of the Green Standard Army, expanding the Qing empire to its greatest territorial extent. Though partly successful, the campaigns were a heavy financial burden on the Qing treasury, and exposed weaknesses in the Qing military. Many bannermen lost their lives in the Burma campaign, often as the result of tropical diseases, to which they had little resistance. In combat, the bannermen troops while could match Burmese and Vietnamese forces in open field, they often outflanked and ambushed by the local forces. Furthermore, Burmese and Vietnamese war elephants terrifed the horses of bannermen cavalry.

===Later history===
Although the banners were instrumental in the transition from Ming to Qing in the 17th century, they began to fall behind rising Western powers in the 18th century. By the 1730s, the traditional martial spirit had been lost, as the well-paid Bannerman spent their time gambling and theatergoing. Subsidizing the 1.5 million men, women and children in the system was an expensive proposition, compounded by embezzlement and corruption. Destitution in the northeastern garrisons led many Manchu Bannermen to abandon their posts and in response the Qing government either sentenced them with penal slavery or death.

In the 19th century, the Eight Banners and Green Standard troops proved unable to put down the Taiping Rebellion and Nian Rebellion on their own. Regional officials like Zeng Guofan were instructed to raise their own forces from the civilian population, leading to the creation of the Xiang Army and the Huai Army, among others. Along with the Ever Victorious Army of Frederick Townsend Ward, it was these warlord armies (known as &quot;yongying&quot;) who finally succeeded in restoring Qing control in this turbulent period.

John Ross, a Scots missionary who served in Manchuria in the 19th century, wrote of the bannermen, &quot;Their claim to be military men is based on their descent rather than on their skill in arms; and their pay is given them because of their fathers&#x27; prowess, and not at all from any hopes of their efficiency as soldiers. Their soldierly qualities are included in the accomplishments of idleness, riding, and the use of the bow and arrow, at which they practice on a few rare occasions each year.&quot;

During the Boxer Rebellion, 1899–1901, the European powers recruited 10,000 Bannermen from the Metropolitan Banners into Wuwei Corps and gave them modernized training and weapons. One of these was the Hushenying. However, many Manchu Bannermen in Beijing supported the Boxers and shared their anti-foreign sentiment. The pro-Boxer Bannermen sustained heavy casualties and subsequently were driven into desperate poverty.

Zhao Erfeng and Zhao Erxun were two important Han Bannermen in the late Qing.

By the late 19th century, the Qing Dynasty began training and creating New Army units based on Western training, equipment and organization. Nevertheless, the banner system remained in existence until the fall of the Qing in 1912, and even beyond, with a rump organization continuing to function until 1924.

At the end of the Qing dynasty, all members of the Eight Banners, regardless of their original ethnicity, were considered by the Republic of China to be Manchu.

Han Bannermen became an elite political class in Fengtian province in the late Qing period and into the Republican era.

In addition to sending Han exiles convicted of crimes to Xinjiang to be slaves of Banner garrisons there, the Qing also practiced reverse exile, exiling Inner Asian (Mongol, Russian and Muslim criminals from Mongolia and Inner Asia) to China proper where they would serve as slaves in Han Banner garrisons in Guangzhou. Russians, Oirats and Muslims (Oros. Ulet. Hoise jergi weilengge niyalma) such as Yakov and Dmitri were exiled to the Han banner garrison in Guangzhou. In the 1780s, after the Jahriyya revolt in Gansu started by Zhang Wenqing (張文慶) was defeated, Muslims like Ma Jinlu (馬進祿) were exiled to the Han Banner garrison in Guangzhou to become slaves to Han Banner officers. The Qing code regulating Mongols in Mongolia sentenced Mongol criminals to exile and to become slaves to Han bannermen in Han Banner garrisons in China proper.

==Organization==
At the highest level, the eight banners were categorized according to two groupings. The three &quot;upper&quot; banners (both Yellow Banners and the Plain White Banner) were under the nominal command of the emperor himself, whereas the five &quot;lower&quot; banners were commanded by others. The banners were also split into a &quot;left wing&quot; and a &quot;right wing&quot; according to how they would be arrayed in battle. In Beijing, the left wing occupied the eastern banner neighborhoods and the right wing occupied the western ones.


The smallest unit in a banner army was the company, or &quot;niru&quot; (, ), composed nominally of 300 soldiers and their families. The term &quot;niru&quot; means &quot;arrow&quot; in the Manchu language, and was originally the Manchu name for a hunting party, which would be armed with bows and arrows. 15 companies (4,500 men) made up one &quot;jalan&quot; (; ). 4 &quot;jalan&quot; constituted a &quot;gūsa&quot; (banner, , ), with a total of 60 companies, or 18,000 men. The actual sizes often varied substantially from these standards.


===Ethnic composition===
Initially, the banner armies were primarily made up of individuals from the various Manchu tribes. As new populations were incorporated into the empire, the armies were expanded to accommodate troops of different ethnicities. The banner armies would eventually encompass three principal ethnic components: the Manchus, the Han, and the Mongols, and various smaller ethnic groups, such as the Xibe, the Daur, and the Evenks.

When the Jurchens were reorganized by Nurhaci into the Eight Banners, many Manchu clans were artificially created as a group of unrelated people founded a new Manchu clan (mukun) using a geographic origin name such as a toponym for their hala (clan name).

There were stories of Han migrating to the Jurchens and assimilating into Manchu Jurchen society and Nikan Wailan may have been an example of this. The Manchu Cuigiya 崔佳氏 clan claimed that a Han Chinese founded their clan. The Tohoro 托和啰 (Duanfang&#x27;s clan) claimed Han Chinese origin. The Han Chinese Banner Tong 佟 clan of Fushun in Liaoning falsely claimed to be related to the Jurchen Manchu Tunggiya 佟佳 clan of Jilin, using this false claim to get themselves transferred to a Manchu banner in the reign of the Kangxi emperor.

The transfer of families from Han Banners or Bondservant status (Booi Aha) to Manchu Banners, switching their ethnicity from Han to Manchu was called &quot;Taiqi&quot; () in Chinese. They would be transferred to the &quot;upper three&quot; Manchu Banners. It was a policy of the Qing to transfer to immediate families (the brothers, father) of the mother of an Emperor into the upper three Manchu Banners and having &quot;giya&quot; 佳 appended to the end of their surname to Manchufy it. It typically occurred in cases of intermarriage with the Qing Aisin Gioro Imperial family, and the close relatives (fathers and brothers) of the concubine or Empress would get promoted from the Han Banner to the Manchu Banner and become Manchu. The Han Bannerwoman Empress Xiaoyichun and her entire family were transferred to the Manchu Banners due to her status as the mother of an Emperor and their surname was change from Wei 魏 to Weigiya 魏佳.

The Qing said that &quot;Manchu and Han are one house&quot; 滿漢一家 and said that the difference was &quot;not between Manchu and Han, but instead between Bannerman and civilian&quot; 不分滿漢，但問旗民 or 但問旗民，不問滿漢.

Select groups of Han Chinese bannermen were mass transferred into Manchu Banners by the Qing, changing their ethnicity from Han Chinese to Manchu. Han Chinese bannermen of Tai Nikan 台尼堪 (watchpost Chinese) and Fusi Nikan 撫順尼堪 (Fushun Chinese) backgrounds into the Manchu banners in 1740 by order of the Qing Qianlong emperor. It was between 1618-1629 when the Han Chinese from Liaodong who later became the Fushun Nikan and Tai Nikan defected to the Jurchens (Manchus). These Han Chinese origin Manchu clans continue to use their original Han surnames and are marked as of Han origin on Qing lists of Manchu clans.

Manchu families adopted Han Chinese sons from families of bondservant Booi Aha (baoyi) origin and they served in Manchu company registers as detached household Manchus and the Qing imperial court found this out in 1729. Manchu Bannermen who needed money helped falsify registration for Han Chinese servants being adopted into the Manchu banners and Manchu families who lacked sons were allowed to adopt their servant&#x27;s sons or servants themselves. The Manchu families were paid to adopt Han Chinese sons from bondservant families by those families. The Qing Imperial Guard captain Batu was furious at the Manchus who adopted Han Chinese as their sons from slave and bondservant families in exchange for money and expressed his displeasure at them adopting Han Chinese instead of other Manchus. These Han Chinese who infiltrated the Manchu Banners by adoption were known as &quot;secondary-status bannermen&quot; and &quot;false Manchus&quot; or &quot;separate-register Manchus&quot;, and there were eventually so many of these Han Chinese that they took over military positions in the Banners which previously were reserved for Jurchen Manchus. Han Chinese foster-son and separate register bannermen made up 800 out of 1,600 soldiers of the Mongol Banners and Manchu Banners of Hangzhou in 1740 which was nearly 50%. Han Chinese foster-son made up 220 out of 1,600 unsalaried troops at Jingzhou in 1747 and an assortment of Han Chinese separate-register, Mongol, and Manchu bannermen were the remainder. Han Chinese secondary status bannermen made up 180 of 3,600 troop households in Ningxia while Han Chinese separate registers made up 380 out of 2,700 Manchu soldiers in Liangzhou. The result of these Han Manchus taking up military positions resulted in many Jurchen Manchus being deprived of their traditional positions as soldiers in the Banner armies, resulting in the Han Manchus supplanting Jurchen Manchus economic and social status.These Han Manchus were said to be good military troops and their skills at marching and archery were up to par so that the Zhapu lieutenant general couldn&#x27;t differentiate them from Jurchen Manchus in terms of military skills. Manchu Banners contained a lot of &quot;false Manchus&quot; who were from Han Chinese civilian families but were adopted by Manchu bannermen after the Yongzheng reign. The Jingkou and Jiangning Mongol banners and Manchu Banners had 1,795 adopted Han Chinese and the Beijing Mongol Banners and Manchu Banners had 2,400 adopted Han Chinese in statistics taken from the 1821 census. Despite Qing attempts to differentiate adopted Han Chinese from normal Manchu bannermen the differences between them became hazy. These adopted Han Chinese bondservants who managed to get themselves onto Manchu banner roles were called kaihu ren (開戶人) in Chinese and dangse faksalaha urse in Manchu. Normal Manchus were called jingkini Manjusa.

Commoner Manchu bannermen who were not nobility were called irgen which meant common, in contrast to the Manchu nobility o the &quot;Eight Great Houses&quot; who held noble titles.

Jiang Xingzhou 姜興舟, a Han bannerman lieutenant from the Bordered Yellow Banner married a Muslim woman in Mukden during Qianlong&#x27;s late reign. He fled his position due to fear of being punished for being a bannerman marrying a commoner woman. He was sentenced to death for leaving his official post but the sentence was commuted and he was not executed.

In the late 19th century and early 1900s, intermarriage between Manchus and Han bannermen in the northeast increased as Manchu families were more willing to marry their daughters to sons from well off Han families to trade their ethnic status for higher financial status.

==Banner soldiers==

From the time China was brought under the rule of the Qing dynasty, the banner soldiers became more professional and bureaucratized. Once the Manchus took over governing, they could no longer satisfy the material needs of soldiers by garnishing and distributing booty; instead, a salary system was instituted, ranks standardized, and the Eight Banners became a sort of hereditary military caste, though with a strong ethnic inflection. Banner soldiers took up permanent positions, either as defenders of the capital, Beijing, where roughly half of them lived with their families, or in the provinces, where some eighteen garrisons were established. The largest banner garrisons throughout most of the Qing dynasty were at Beijing, followed by Xi&#x27;an and Hangzhou. Sizable banner populations were also placed in Manchuria and at strategic points along the Great Wall, the Yangtze River and Grand Canal.

<doc id="198463" wikidata="Q1371867" url="?curid=198463" title="Kleenex">
<text>Kleenex is a brand name primarily known for their line of facial tissues. Often used informally as a genericized trademark for facial tissue, &quot;Kleenex&quot; is a registered trademark of Kimberly-Clark applied to products made in 78 countries. The brand has other paper products like napkins and toilet roll.

==History==
Kleenex began during the First World War when the Cellucotton company developed a crepe paper gas mask filter. In the 1920s, the product was modified into the menstrual pad Kotex. A further modification of the original crepe paper made it thinner and softer, and the resultant 1924 product was called &quot;Kleenex&quot; and marketed as a cold cream remover. In line with the company&#x27;s requirements for their brand names to be short, easy to say, and easy to explain, the name Kleenex was selected as the &quot;Kleen&quot; portion of the name denotes its cleansing purpose with a sensational spelling of the word &quot;clean&quot;. The &quot;ex&quot; was added to show that Kleenex was of the family of products that included Kotex. This was the first marketing of a disposable, paper-based, facial tissue in the Western world, and was sold as a substitute for face towels or cotton wool.

In 1925, the first Kleenex tissue ad was used in magazines showing &quot;the new secret of keeping a pretty skin as used by famous movie stars&quot;. A few years after the introduction of Kleenex, the Cellucotton&#x27;s head researcher tried to persuade the head of advertising to try to market the tissue for colds and hay fever. The administrator declined the idea but then committed a small amount of ad space to mention of using Kleenex tissue as a handkerchief. By the 1930s, Kleenex was being marketed with the slogan &quot;Don&#x27;t Carry a Cold in Your Pocket&quot;, and its use as a disposable handkerchief replacement became predominant. In 1943, Kleenex began licensing the Little Lulu cartoon character to popularize the brand.

==Trademark==
The original Kleenex trademark application at the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) was filed in the class of Medical, Beauty, &amp; Agricultural Services by Cellucotton Products Company of Neenah, Wisconsin, on July 12, 1924. The description provided to the USPTO was &quot;absorbent pads or sheets for removing cold cream&quot;.

In the application, Cellucotton claimed that it had used the drawing and stylized word mark in commerce since June 12, 1924. USPTO granted trademark registration on November 25, 1924. International Cellucotton Products Company officially assigned trademark interest and good will of the business to Kimberly-Clark Corporation on September 30, 1955. Kimberly-Clark Corporation of Neenah, Wisconsin, is the current registered owner of the Kleenex trademark.

Nationwide marketing in the United states of Kleenex (as a means of removing cold cream rather than as a tissue for sneezes) was rolled out in the first week of September 1924 in Chicago with an ad for the Walgreen drug store chain on September 2 and with an offer on September 4 for a free sample in New York City 

In the U.S., the Kleenex name has become—in common usage but &quot;not&quot; in law—genericized. The popularity of the product has led to the use of its name to refer to any facial tissue, regardless of the brand. Many dictionaries, including Merriam-Webster and Oxford, now include definitions in their publications defining it as such.

In 2023 Kimberly-Clark announced that it would no longer be selling the brand in Canada, citing transportation costs. It had a 16 percent market share at the time, but the cost of shipping meant profitability was low.

== Diapers ==
In 1978, Kimberly-Clark introduced Kleenex Super Dry diapers with wetness indicators in the form of a design that fades and lightens as the inside of the diaper becomes wetter. The Huggies brand, introduced in 1977, is the current brand of diaper products for Kimberly-Clark.

<doc id="198466" wikidata="Q209464" url="?curid=198466" title="Waldorf salad">
<text>A Waldorf salad is a fruit and nut salad generally made of celery, fresh apples, walnuts, and grapes, dressed in mayonnaise, and traditionally served on a bed of lettuce as an appetizer or a light meal. The apples, celery, and grapes can all be green, which harmonizes the color palette of the dish.

== History ==
Waldorf salad is named for the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in New York City, where it was first created for a charity ball given in honor of the St. Mary&#x27;s Hospital for Children on March 13, 1896. The Waldorf-Astoria&#x27;s maître d&#x27;hôtel, Oscar Tschirky, developed or inspired many of the hotel&#x27;s signature dishes and is widely credited with creating the salad recipe. In 1896, the salad appeared in &quot;The Cook Book&quot; by &quot;Oscar of the Waldorf&quot;.

The original recipe was just apples, celery, and mayonnaise. It did not contain nuts, but they had been added by the time the recipe appeared in &quot;The Rector Cook Book&quot; in 1928.

An American guest demanding a Waldorf salad featured prominently in a 1979 episode of the British sitcom &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot;. The salad is mentioned in the Cole Porter song &quot;You&#x27;re the Top&quot;.

== Modern versions ==
Other ingredients such as chicken, turkey, and dried fruit (e.g., dates or raisins) are sometimes added. Updated versions of the salad sometimes change the dressing to a seasoned mayonnaise or a yogurt dressing. Modern Waldorf salad may also include the zest of oranges and/or lemons. Variations include a peanut butter and yogurt base, and one that replaces celery with cauliflower.

<text>HNLMS &quot;Abraham Crijnssen&quot; is a of the Royal Netherlands Navy (RNN).

Built during the 1930s, she was based in the Dutch East Indies when Japan attacked at the end of 1941. Ordered to retreat to Australia, the ship was disguised as a tropical island to avoid detection, and was the last Dutch ship to escape from the region. On arriving in Australia in 1942, she was commissioned into the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) as HMAS &quot;Abraham Crijnssen&quot; and operated as an anti-submarine escort. Although returned to RNN control in 1943, the ship remained in Australian waters for most of World War II. After the war, &quot;Abraham Crijnssen&quot; operated on anti-revolution patrols in the East Indies, before returning to the Netherlands and being converted into a boom defence ship in 1956.

Removed from service in 1960, the vessel was donated to the Netherlands Sea Cadet Corps for training purposes. In 1995, &quot;Abraham Crijnssen&quot; was acquired by the Dutch Navy Museum for preservation as a museum ship.

==Design and construction==
&quot;Abraham Crijnssen&quot; was the third of eight s constructed for the RNN during the late 1930s. Built by Werf Gusto at their yard in Schiedam, South Holland, the minesweeper was launched on 22 September 1936, and commissioned into the RNN on 26 May 1937. She was named after 17th century naval commander Abraham Crijnssen.

&quot;Abraham Crijnssen&quot; and her sister ships were long, with a beam of , a draught of , and a displacement of 525 tons. The minesweepers were fitted with two Yarrow 3-drum boilers and two Stork triple expansion engines, which provided to two propeller shafts, allowing the ship to reach . &quot;Abraham Crijnssen&quot; was armed with a single 3-inch gun, and two Oerlikon 20 mm cannon, plus a payload of depth charges. The standard ship&#x27;s company was 45.

==Operational history==
===Early service===
The ship was based at Surabaya in the Netherlands East Indies when Japan invaded in 1941. Following the Allied defeats at the Battles of the Java Sea and Sunda Strait in late February 1942, all Allied ships were ordered to withdraw to Australia. &quot;Abraham Crijnssen&quot; was meant to sail with three other warships, but found herself proceeding alone.

To escape detection by Japanese aircraft (which the minesweeper did not have the armament to defend effectively against), the ship was heavily camouflaged with jungle foliage, giving the impression of a small island. Personnel cut down trees and branches from nearby islands, and arranged the cuttings to form a jungle canopy covering as much of the ship as possible. Any hull still exposed was painted to resemble rocks and cliffs. To further the illusion, the ship would remain close to shore, anchored and immobile during daylight, and only sail at night. She headed for Fremantle, Western Australia, where she arrived on 20 March 1942; &quot;Abraham Crijnssen&quot; was the last vessel to successfully escape Java, and the only ship of her class in the region to survive.

===RAN service===
After arriving in Australian waters, the minesweeper underwent a refit, which included the installation of new ASDIC equipment. On 28 September, the minesweeper was commissioned into the RAN as HMAS &quot;Abraham Crijnssen&quot;. She was reclassified as an anti-submarine convoy escort, and was also used as a submarine tender for the Dutch submarines that relocated to Australia following the Japanese conquest. The ship&#x27;s Dutch sailors were supplemented with survivors from the British destroyer and Australian personnel, all under the command of an Australian lieutenant. The wardroom tradition of hanging a portrait of the commissioned ship&#x27;s reigning monarch led to some tension before it was decided to leave Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands on the bulkhead instead of replacing her with King George VI of the United Kingdom, which was installed in the lieutenant&#x27;s cabin.

While escorting a convoy to Sydney through Bass Strait on 26 January 1943, &quot;Abraham Crijnssen&quot; detected a submarine on ASDIC. The convoy was ordered to scatter, while &quot;Abraham Crijnssen&quot; and depth charged the submarine contact. No wreckage of the suspected submarine was found. A pair of hastily released depth charges at the start of the engagement damaged the minesweeper; several fittings and pipes were damaged, and all of her centerline rivets had to be replaced during a week-long dry-docking.
===Return to RNN===
&quot;Abraham Crijnssen&quot; was returned to RNN service on 5 May 1943, but remained in Australian waters for most of World War II. On 7 June 1945, the minesweeper left Sydney for Darwin, with the oil lighter (and former submarine) &quot;K9&quot; in tow. On 8 June, the tow cable snapped, and &quot;K9&quot; washed ashore at Seal Rocks, New South Wales.

&quot;Abraham Crijnssen&quot; was used for mine-clearing sweeps of Kupang Harbour prior to the arrival of a RAN force to accept the Japanese surrender of Timor.

===Post-war===
After World War II, the minesweeper was used on anti-revolution patrols of the Netherlands East Indies. She left for the Netherlands in August 1951, and was converted into a boom defence vessel in March 1956.

==Decommissioning and preservation==

The ship was removed from the Navy List in 1960. After leaving service, &quot;Abraham Crijnssen&quot; was donated to the Sea Cadet Corps (&quot;Zeekadetkorps Nederland&quot;) for training purposes. She was docked at The Hague from 1962 to 1972, after which she was moved to Rotterdam. The ship was also used as a storage hulk during this time.

In 1995, &quot;Abraham Crijnssen&quot; was marked for preservation by the Dutch Navy Museum at Den Helder. She was retrofitted to her wartime configuration.

<doc id="198474" wikidata="Q1536639" url="?curid=198474" title="Pinkerton (album)">
<text>Pinkerton is the second studio album by the American rock band Weezer, released on September 24, 1996, by DGC Records. The guitarist and vocalist Rivers Cuomo wrote most of &quot;Pinkerton&quot; while studying at Harvard University, after abandoning plans for a rock opera, &quot;Songs from the Black Hole&quot;. It was the last Weezer album to feature the bassist Matt Sharp, who left in 1998. 
To better capture their live sound, Weezer self-produced &quot;Pinkerton&quot;, creating a darker, more abrasive album than their self-titled 1994 debut. Cuomo&#x27;s lyrics express loneliness and disillusionment with the rock lifestyle. The title comes from the character BF Pinkerton from Giacomo Puccini&#x27;s 1904 opera &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;, whom Cuomo described as an &quot;asshole American sailor similar to a touring rock star&quot;. Like &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;, &quot;Pinkerton&quot; views Japanese culture from the perspective of an outsider who considers Japan fragile and sensual.

&quot;Pinkerton&quot; produced the singles &quot;El Scorcho&quot; and &quot;The Good Life&quot;. It debuted at number 19 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, failing to meet sales expectations. It received mixed reviews; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; readers voted it the third-worst album of 1996. For subsequent albums, Cuomo returned to more traditional pop songwriting and less personal lyrics.

In subsequent years, &quot;Pinkerton&quot; was reassessed and achieved acclaim. Several publications named it one of the best albums of the 1990s, and it was certified platinum in the US in 2016. Several emo bands have credited it as an influence.

==Background==
In 1994, after the multi-platinum success of Weezer&#x27;s self-titled debut album (also known as the &quot;Blue Album&quot;), Weezer took a break from touring for Christmas. The singer and songwriter, Rivers Cuomo, felt limited by rock music. Every night, after performing with Weezer, he listened to Giacomo Puccini&#x27;s 1904 opera &quot;Madama Butterfly; &quot;the &quot;depth of emotion and sadness and tragedy&quot; inspired him to go further with his music.

In his home state of Connecticut, Cuomo began preparing material for Weezer&#x27;s next album using an 8-track recorder. His original concept was a rock opera, &quot;Songs from the Black Hole&quot;, that would express his mixed feelings about success. Weezer developed &quot;Songs from the Black Hole&quot; through intermittent recording sessions throughout 1995.

On April 14, 1995, Cuomo, who was born with one leg shorter than the other, had extensive leg surgery to lengthen his right leg, followed by weeks of painful physical therapy. This affected his songwriting, as he would spend long periods hospitalized, unable to walk without the use of a cane, and under the influence of painkillers.

In the same period, Cuomo applied to study classical composition at Harvard University with a letter describing his disillusionment with the rock lifestyle: &quot;You will meet two hundred people every night, but each conversation will generally last approximately thirty seconds ... Then you will be alone again, in your motel room. Or you will be on your bus, in your little space, trying to kill the nine hours it takes to get to the next city, whichever city it is.&quot;

By May 1996, Cuomo&#x27;s songwriting had become &quot;darker, more visceral and exposed, less playful&quot;, and the &quot;Songs from the Black Hole&quot; concept was abandoned. Weezer&#x27;s second album would instead feature songs written while Cuomo was at Harvard, chronicling his loneliness and frustration, or what Cuomo referred to as his &quot;dark side&quot;.

==Recording==
In 1995, shortly before Cuomo left to study at Harvard, Weezer spent two weeks at New York City&#x27;s Electric Lady Studios, where they had recorded their debut, and tracked the songs &quot;Why Bother?&quot;, &quot;Getchoo&quot;, &quot;No Other One&quot; and &quot;Tired of Sex&quot;. Weezer hoped to explore &quot;deeper, darker, more experimental stuff&quot; and better capture their live sound. They decided against hiring a producer, feeling that &quot;the best way for us to sound like ourselves is to record on our own&quot;. To give the album a live, &quot;raw&quot; feel, Cuomo, the guitarist Brian Bell and the bassist, Matt Sharp, recorded their vocals in tandem around three microphones rather than overdubbing them separately.

While Cuomo was at Harvard, other Weezer members worked on side projects. Sharp promoted &quot;Return of the Rentals&quot;, the debut album by his band the Rentals, and Bell and the drummer, Patrick Wilson, worked on material for their bands the Space Twins and the Special Goodness. In January 1996, during Cuomo&#x27;s winter break, Weezer regrouped for a two-week session at Sound City Studios in Van Nuys, Los Angeles, to complete the songs they had worked on in August. The Weezer collaborator Karl Koch said Sound City was &quot;a significant part of the sound&quot;.

After recording &quot;El Scorcho&quot; and &quot;Pink Triangle&quot;, they separated while Cuomo returned to Harvard. During Cuomo&#x27;s 1996 spring break, Weezer regrouped at Sound City Studios and recorded &quot;The Good Life&quot;, &quot;Across the Sea&quot; and &quot;Falling for You&quot; before Cuomo returned to Harvard for his finals. They completed &quot;Pinkerton&quot; in mid-1996 in Los Angeles. Two additional tracks, &quot;I Swear It&#x27;s True&quot; and &quot;Getting Up and Leaving&quot;, were abandoned prior to mixing.

==Music and lyrics==

&quot;Pinkerton&quot; features a darker, more abrasive sound than Weezer&#x27;s debut. Critics described it as alternative rock, emo, power pop, pop-punk, indie rock, and lo-fi. Writing from a more direct and personal perspective, Cuomo wrote of his dysfunctional relationships, sexual frustration, and struggles with identity. The album charts his &quot;cycle between &#x27;lame-o and partier.

At just under 35 minutes, &quot;Pinkerton&quot; is, according to Cuomo, &quot;short by design&quot;. The first song, &quot;Tired of Sex&quot;, written before the release of the &quot;Blue Album&quot;, has Cuomo describing meaningless sex with groupies and wondering why true love eludes him. &quot;Across the Sea&quot; was inspired by a letter Cuomo received from a Japanese fan: &quot;When I got the letter, I fell in love with her ... I was very lonely at the time, but at the same time I was very depressed that I would never meet her.&quot;

&quot;The Good Life&quot; chronicles the rebirth of Cuomo after an identity crisis as an Ivy League loner. Cuomo, who felt isolated at Harvard, wrote it after &quot;becoming frustrated with that hermit&#x27;s life I was leading, the ascetic life. And I think I was starting to become frustrated with my whole dream about purifying myself and trying to live like a monk or an intellectual and going to school and holding out for this perfect, ideal woman. And so I wrote the song. And I started to turn around and come back the other way.&quot;

&quot;El Scorcho&quot; addresses Cuomo&#x27;s shyness and inability to approach a woman while at Harvard; he explained that the song &quot;is more about me, because at that point I hadn&#x27;t even talked to the girl, I didn&#x27;t really know much about her.&quot; &quot;Pink Triangle&quot; describes a man who falls in love, but discovers the object of his devotion is a lesbian.

&quot;Pinkerton&quot; is named after the character BF Pinkerton from &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;, who marries and then abandons a Japanese woman named Butterfly. Calling him an &quot;asshole American sailor similar to a touring rock star&quot;, Cuomo felt the character was &quot;the perfect symbol for the part of myself that I am trying to come to terms with on this album&quot;. Other titles considered included &quot;Playboy&quot; and &quot;Diving into the Wreck&quot; (after the poem by Adrienne Rich).

Like &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;, &quot;Pinkerton&quot; views Japanese culture from the perspective of an outsider who considers Japan fragile and sensual; the Japanese allusions are infused with the narrator&#x27;s romantic disappointments and sexual frustration. Cuomo wrote that &quot;Pinkerton&quot; &quot;is really the clash of East vs West. My hindu, zen, kyokushin [karate], self-denial, self-abnegation, no-emotion, cool-faced side versus my Italian-American heavy metal side.&quot; The songs are mostly sequenced in the order in which he wrote them, and so &quot;the album kind of tells the story of my struggle with my inner Pinkerton&quot;.

==Artwork==
The cover artwork is derived from (&quot;Night snow at Kambara&quot;) from the Japanese ukiyo-e artist Hiroshige&#x27;s 1830s series &quot;53 Stations of the Tōkaidō&quot;. Lyrics from &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; are printed on the &quot;Pinkerton&quot; CD in their original Italian: &quot;Everywhere in the world, the roving Yankee takes his pleasure and his profit, indifferent to all risks. He drops anchor at random...&quot;

Behind the CD tray is a map with the title (Italian for &quot;Island of the Butterfly and Peninsula of Dog&quot;). On the map are a ship named USS &quot;Pinkerton&quot; and &quot;Mykel and Carli Island&quot;, alluding to Weezer&#x27;s fan club founders, and the names of some of Cuomo&#x27;s influences, including Howard Stern, Yngwie Malmsteen, Brian Wilson, Lou Barlow, Joe Matt, Camille Paglia and Ace Frehley.

==Release and promotion==
Todd Sullivan, an A&amp;R representative from Weezer&#x27;s record label, Geffen, described &quot;Pinkerton&quot; as a &quot;very brave record&quot;, but worried: &quot;What sort of light does this put the band in? It could have been interpreted as them being a disposable pop band.&quot; Geffen was pleased with the record and felt that fans would not be disappointed.

Weezer turned down a video treatment for the lead single, &quot;El Scorcho&quot;, proposed by Spike Jonze, who had helped raise Weezer&#x27;s status with his videos for &quot;Undone – The Sweater Song&quot; and &quot;Buddy Holly&quot;. Cuomo said: &quot;I really want the songs to come across untainted this time around… I really want to communicate my feelings directly and because I was so careful in writing that way. I&#x27;d hate for the video to kinda misrepresent the song, or exaggerate certain aspects.&quot; The &quot;El Scorcho&quot; video features Weezer playing in an assembly hall in Los Angeles, surrounded by light fixtures flashing in time to the music. The director, Mark Romanek, quit after arguments with Cuomo, leaving Cuomo to edit the video himself. The video debuted on MTV&#x27;s &quot;120 Minutes&quot; and received moderate airplay.

&quot;Pinkerton&quot; debuted at number 19 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, its highest position. It sold 47,000 copies its first week, falling far short of the sales of Weezer&#x27;s first album. The singles also fared poorly; &quot;El Scorcho&quot; reached number 19, &quot;The Good Life&quot; reached number 32, and &quot;Pink Triangle&quot; did not chart. As &quot;Pinkerton&quot; was not meeting sales expectations, Weezer felt pressure to make another music video more to the liking of MTV. The video for &quot;The Good Life&quot;, directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, stars Mary Lynn Rajskub as a pizza delivery girl, and uses simultaneous camera angles appearing on screen as a fractured full image. Geffen rush-released the video to try to save the album, but was not successful.

=== Tour ===
In October 1996, Weezer toured Australia, New Zealand and Japan. Afterwards, they flew home to Los Angeles, where Wilson and Sharp made a promotional appearance on the nationally syndicated radio show &quot;Modern Rock Live&quot;. On November 1, Weezer began a tour of North America at the Ventura Theatre in Ventura, California. On November 6, they performed an acoustic set at Shorecrest High School in Seattle due to a contest won by a student.

Weezer continued to tour until mid-1997. The tour was postponed when the sisters Mykel, Carli and Trysta Allan died in a car accident while driving home from a Weezer show in Denver, Colorado. Mykel and Carli ran Weezer&#x27;s fan club and helped manage publicity for several other Los Angeles bands, and had inspired the Weezer song &quot;Mykel and Carli&quot;. Weezer canceled a show to attend their funeral. In August, Weezer and other bands held a benefit concert for their family in Los Angeles.

=== Pinkerton&#x27;s Inc. lawsuit ===
A day before &quot;Pinkerton&quot; was to be released on September 24, 1996, a restraining order was obtained by Californian security firm Pinkerton&#x27;s Inc. Pinkerton sued Weezer and Geffen for federal trademark infringement, claiming they were trying to capitalize on their reputation. Under the terms of the restraining order, which had Pinkerton&#x27;s Inc seeking two million dollars in damages, Weezer would be kept from &quot;selling, distributing, or advertising&quot; an album under the name &quot;Pinkerton&quot;. The Geffen spokesman Dennis Dennehy defended the title, arguing that it was a reference to &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; and not aimed at &quot;any sort of corporate entity&quot;. Cuomo wrote a six-page paper explaining why he chose the title and why he felt it was essential. The case was thrown out of court after the judge determined that &quot;the hardship of not issuing the &quot;Pinkerton&quot; disc would be greater for Geffen than any hardship Pinkerton&#x27;s Inc or its shareholders might incur from consumers who mistakenly presume the company has anything to do with the album&quot;.

==Critical reception==
Initial reviews of &quot;Pinkerton&quot; were mixed. Jeff Gordinier of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; deemed it &quot;a collection of get-down party anthems for agoraphobics&quot; and criticized Weezer&#x27;s choice to self-produce, which he felt resulted in a &quot;sloppy and raw&quot; aesthetic inferior to the pop sound of their debut. In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Rob O&#x27;Connor called Cuomo&#x27;s songwriting &quot;juvenile&quot;, and singled out &quot;Tired of Sex&quot; as &quot;aimless&quot;. However, he praised &quot;Butterfly&quot; as &quot;a real treat, a gentle acoustic number that recalls the vintage, heartbreaking beauty of Big Star … suggesting that underneath the geeky teenager pose is an artist well on his way to maturity&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; readers voted the album the third-worst of 1996. Some listeners were perturbed by the sexual nature of the lyrics; &quot;Melody Maker&quot;″s Jennifer Nine praised the music, but advised listeners &quot;to ignore the lyrics entirely&quot;.

Steve Appleford of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that the songs were &quot;are sloppy and awkward, but express a seemingly genuine, desperate search for sex and love&quot;. Mark Beaumont of &quot;NME&quot; praised &quot;Pinkerton&quot;, writing that &quot;by the time the affecting acoustic lament &#x27;Butterfly&#x27; wafts in ... &quot;Pinkerton&quot; starts feeling like a truly moving album&quot;. Ryan Schreiber of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; wrote that &quot;&quot;Pinkerton&quot; might actually be a bit much for fans who were wooed with the clean production and immediately accessible sound of these guys&#x27; debut, but if given a chance, it might surprise even some anti-Weezer folk&quot;. The&quot;Guardian&quot; critic Kathy Sweeney found &quot;Pinkerton&quot; &quot;noisier and messier than their last album, and all the better for it&quot;. In another positive review, Dave Henderson of &quot;Q&quot; said that &quot;on every tale of romance, delivered in perfect verse/chorus formula, you can see Jennifer Aniston giving it some attitude in the kitchen&quot;.

==Legacy==

Cuomo was embarrassed by &quot;Pinkerton&quot; reception and the personal nature of its songs. According to the &quot;Guardian&quot;, &quot;For a long time, Cuomo talked about &quot;Pinkerton&quot; like it was his high school diary, a humiliating reminder of a time when he was unapologetically emotional and corny.&quot; In August 1997, Cuomo wrote in his diaries: &quot;This has been a tough year. It&#x27;s not just that the world has said &quot;Pinkerton&quot; isn&#x27;t worth a shit, but that the &quot;Blue&quot; album wasn&#x27;t either. It was a fluke ... I&#x27;m a shitty songwriter.&quot;

After the &quot;Pinkerton&quot; tour, Sharp left the band and Weezer went on a hiatus. In the following years, &quot;Pinkerton&quot; amassed a cult following through internet word of mouth. A wave of mainstream emo bands including Jimmy Eat World, Saves the Day, Dashboard Confessional and Motion City Soundtrack began citing it as an influence. Cuomo was initially uncomfortable with the development, and told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 2001: &quot;The most painful thing in my life these days is the cult around &quot;Pinkerton&quot;. It&#x27;s just a sick album, sick in a diseased sort of way.&quot; He told &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;:

Also in 2001, Cuomo mentioned to David Geffen, the head of Geffen Records, that &quot;Pinkerton&quot; had &quot;turned into a real phenomenon&quot;. Geffen responded that &quot;cult phenomenon&quot; was euphemism for failure. For Weezer&#x27;s subsequent albums, Cuomo moved to simpler songwriting with less personal lyrics. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described Weezer&#x27;s followup, the &quot;Green Album&quot; (2001), as the &quot;anti-&quot;Pinkerton&quot;&quot;, with &quot;squeaky-clean&quot; production and album art that recalled Weezer&#x27;s debut. Sharp sued Weezer in 2001 for songwriting royalties including songs from &quot;Pinkerton&quot;.

&quot;Pinkerton&quot;″s critical standing continued to rise, and it came to be considered among Weezer&#x27;s best work by fans and critics. In 2002, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; readers voted it the 16th-greatest album of all time. In 2003, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; gave &quot;Pinkerton&quot; a perfect score and named it the 53rd-greatest album of the 1990s. In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave it a new review, awarding it five out of five and adding it to the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Hall of Fame. Over the following years, it appeared in best-of lists by publications including &quot;Spin&quot; and &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot;. By August 2009, &quot;Pinkerton&quot; had sold 852,000 copies in the US and was certified gold. In 2016, almost 20 years after its release, &quot;Pinkerton&quot; was certified platinum for sales of over one million copies in the US. That year, Alana Levinson of the &quot;Guardian&quot; wrote that &quot;Pinkerton&quot; &quot;conversational, confessional&quot; lyrics were appropriate in the age of social media.

By 2008, Cuomo had reconsidered the album, saying: &quot;&quot;Pinkerton&quot;″s great. It&#x27;s super-deep, brave, and authentic. Listening to it, I can tell that I was really going for it when I wrote and recorded a lot of those songs.&quot; In 2010, Bell told &quot;The Aquarian Weekly&quot;: &quot;&quot;Pinkerton&quot; has definitely taken on a life of its own and became more successful and more accepted … As an artist, you just have to do what you believe in at the time, whether it&#x27;s accepted or not. You just have to keep going with it.&quot; That year, Weezer embarked on the Memories Tour, playing &quot;Blue&quot; and &quot;Pinkerton&quot; in their entirety. Cuomo said of the tour: &quot;The last time we played all of those [&quot;Pinkerton&quot;] songs, they went over like a lead balloon. And I just remember that feeling of just total rejection. And then to see 5,500 people singing along to every last word through every song on the album, even the really difficult ones, was incredibly validating for me.&quot;

===Accolades===
==Further releases==
On November 2, 2010, DGC reissued &quot;Pinkerton&quot; with live performances, B-sides, and previously unreleased songs. The reissue debuted at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Catalog Albums chart and achieved a perfect score on the aggregate review website Metacritic.

In 2011, Cuomo published a book, &quot;The Pinkerton Diaries&quot;, which collects his writings from the era, including lyrics, studio notes, journals, emails, letters, and essays. It was sold with the compilation album &quot;Alone III: The Pinkerton Years&quot;, compiling demos recorded between 1993 and 1996, when Cuomo was writing material for &quot;Pinkerton&quot; and &quot;Songs from the Black Hole&quot;.

In May 2016, &quot;Pinkerton&quot; was reissued on vinyl by the record subscription service Vinyl Me, Please. The album was pressed on &quot;dark blue translucent vinyl with black marbling&quot; and was packaged in a custom sleeve with pop-out art, a custom lyric sheet, artwork by the Japanese painter Fuco Ueda, and a sake cocktail recipe.

<doc id="198476" wikidata="Q13724" url="?curid=198476" title="Triangulum Galaxy">
<text>The Triangulum Galaxy is a spiral galaxy 2.73 million light-years (ly) from Earth in the constellation Triangulum. It is catalogued as Messier 33 or NGC 598. With the D25 isophotal diameter of , the Triangulum Galaxy is the third-largest member of the Local Group of galaxies, behind the Andromeda Galaxy and the Milky Way.

The galaxy is the second-smallest spiral galaxy in the Local Group after the Large Magellanic Cloud, which is a Magellanic-type spiral galaxy. It is believed to be a satellite of the Andromeda Galaxy or on its rebound into the latter due to their interactions, velocities, and proximity to one another in the night sky. It also has an H II nucleus.

==Etymology==
The galaxy gets its name from the constellation Triangulum, where it can be spotted. 

It is sometimes informally referred to as the &quot;Pinwheel Galaxy&quot; by some astronomy references, in some computerized telescope software, and in some public outreach websites. However, the SIMBAD Astronomical Database, a professional database, collates formal designations for astronomical objects and indicates that Pinwheel Galaxy refers to Messier 101, which several amateur astronomy resources including public outreach websites identify by that name, and that is within the bounds of Ursa Major.

==Visibility==
Under exceptionally good viewing conditions with no light pollution, the Triangulum Galaxy can be seen by some people with the fully dark-adapted naked eye; to those viewers, it is the farthest permanent entity visible without magnification, being about half again as distant as Messier 31, the Andromeda Galaxy. It is a diffuse, or extended, object rather than a starlike point, even without magnification, because of its physical extent.

Its observability without optical aid ranges from being relatively easily seen by people using direct vision in deep rural locations under a dark, clear, transparent sky, to requiring use of averted vision by observers in locations beyond the suburbs in shallow rural areas under good viewing conditions. It is one of the reference objects of the Bortle Dark-Sky Scale.

Crumey has shown that although the total apparent V-magnitude of M33 is 5.72, it has an effective visual magnitude of approximately 6.6, meaning that a precondition for visibility is that the observer can see stars at least as faint as that latter figure. This is fainter than many people are able to see, even at a very dark site.

==Observation history==
The Triangulum Galaxy was probably discovered by the Italian astronomer Giovanni Battista Hodierna before 1654. In his work &quot;De systemate orbis cometici; deque admirandis coeli caracteribus&quot; (&quot;About the systematics of the cometary orbit, and about the admirable objects of the sky&quot;), he listed it as a cloud-like nebulosity or obscuration and gave the cryptic description, &quot;near the Triangle &quot;hinc inde&quot;&quot;. This is in reference to the constellation Triangulum as a pair of triangles. The magnitude of the object matches M33, so it is most likely a reference to the Triangulum Galaxy.

The galaxy was independently discovered by Charles Messier on the night of August 25–26, 1764. It was published in his &quot;Catalog of Nebulae and Star Clusters&quot; (1771) as object number 33; hence the name M33. When William Herschel compiled his extensive catalog of nebulae, he was careful not to include most of the objects identified by Messier. However, M33 was an exception, and he cataloged this object on September 11, 1784, as H V-17.

Herschel also cataloged the Triangulum Galaxy&#x27;s brightest and largest H II region (diffuse emission nebula containing ionized hydrogen) as H III.150 separately from the galaxy itself; the nebula eventually obtained NGC number 604. As seen from Earth, NGC 604 is located northeast of the galaxy&#x27;s central core. It is one of the largest H II regions known, with a diameter of nearly 1500 light-years and a spectrum similar to that of the Orion Nebula. Herschel also noted three other smaller H II regions (NGC 588, 592, and 595).

It was among the first &quot;spiral nebulae&quot; identified as such by Lord Rosse in 1850. In 1922–23, John Charles Duncan and Max Wolf discovered variable stars in the nebulae. Edwin Hubble showed in 1926 that 35 of these stars were classical Cepheids, thereby allowing him to estimate their distances. The results were consistent with the concept of spiral nebulae being independent galactic systems of gas and dust, rather than just nebulae in the Milky Way.

==Properties==
The Triangulum Galaxy is the third largest member of the Local Group of galaxies. It has a diameter measured through the D25 standard - the isophote where the surface brightness of the galaxy reaches 25 mag/arcsec2, to be about , making it roughly 70% the size of the Milky Way. It may be a gravitationally bound companion of the Andromeda Galaxy. Triangulum may be home to 40 billion stars, compared to 400 billion for the Milky Way and 1 trillion for Andromeda.

The disk of Triangulum has an estimated mass of solar masses, while the gas component is about solar masses. Thus, the combined mass of all baryonic matter in the galaxy may be 1010 solar masses. The contribution of the dark matter component out to a radius of is equivalent to about solar masses.

=== Location – distance – motion ===

Estimates of the distance from the Milky Way to the Triangulum Galaxy range from (or 2.38 to 3.07 Mly), with most estimates since the year 2000 lying in the middle portion of this range, making it slightly more distant than the Andromeda Galaxy (at 2,540,000 light-years). At least three techniques have been used to measure distances to M 33. Using the Cepheid variable method, an estimate of was achieved in 2004. In the same year, the tip of the red-giant branch (TRGB) method was used to derive a distance estimate of . The Triangulum Galaxy is around 750,000 light years from the Andromeda Galaxy.

In 2006, a group of astronomers announced the discovery of an eclipsing binary star in the Triangulum Galaxy. By studying the eclipses of the stars, astronomers were able to measure their sizes. Knowing the sizes and temperatures of the stars, they were able to measure the absolute magnitude of the stars. When the visual and absolute magnitudes are known, the distance to the star can be measured. The stars lie at the distance of . The average of 102 distance estimates published since 1987 gives a distance modulus of 24.69, or .883 Mpc (2,878,000 light-years).

The Triangulum Galaxy is a source of H2O maser emission. In 2005, using observations of two water masers on opposite sides of Triangulum via the VLBA, researchers were for the first time able to estimate the angular rotation and proper motion of Triangulum. A velocity of relative to the Milky Way was computed, which means Triangulum is moving towards Andromeda Galaxy and suggesting it may be a satellite of the larger galaxy (depending on their relative distances and margins of error). 

In 2004, evidence was announced of a clumpy stream of hydrogen gas linking the Andromeda Galaxy with Triangulum, suggesting that the two may have tidally interacted in the past. This discovery was confirmed in 2011. A distance of less than 300 kiloparsecs between the two supports this hypothesis.

The Pisces Dwarf (LGS 3), one of the small Local Group member galaxies, is located from the Sun. It is 20° from the Andromeda Galaxy and 11° from Triangulum. As LGS 3 lies at a distance of from both galaxies, it could be a satellite galaxy of either Andromeda or Triangulum. LGS 3 has a core radius of and solar masses.

Pisces VII/Triangulum (Tri) III may be another satellite of Triangulum.

===Structure===
In the French astronomer Gérard de Vaucouleurs&#x27; revised Hubble Sandage (VRHS) system of galaxy morphological classification, the Triangulum Galaxy is classified as type SA(s)cd. The &quot;S&quot; prefix indicates that it is a disk-shaped galaxy with prominent arms of gas and dust that spiral out from the nucleus—what is commonly known as a spiral galaxy. The &quot;A&quot; is assigned when the galactic nucleus lacks a bar-shaped structure, in contrast to &quot;SB&quot; class barred spiral galaxies. American astronomer Allan Sandage&#x27;s &quot;(s)&quot; notation is used when the spiral arms emerge directly from the nucleus or central bar, rather than from an inner ring as with an (r)-type galaxy. Finally, the &quot;cd&quot; suffix represents a stage along the spiral sequence that describes the openness of the arms. A rating of &quot;cd&quot; indicates relatively loosely wound arms.

This galaxy has an inclination of 54° to the line of sight from Earth, allowing the structure to be examined without significant obstruction by gas and dust. The disk of the Triangulum Galaxy appears warped out to a radius of about 8 kpc. There may be a halo surrounding the galaxy, but there is no bulge at the nucleus. This is an isolated galaxy and there are no indications of recent mergers or interactions with other galaxies, and it lacks the dwarf spheroidals or tidal tails associated with the Milky Way.

Triangulum is classified as unbarred, but an analysis of the galaxy&#x27;s shape shows what may be a weak bar-like structure about the galactic nucleus. The radial extent of this structure is about 0.8 kpc. 

The nucleus of this galaxy is an H II region, and it contains an ultraluminous X-ray source with an emission of , which is the most luminous source of X-rays in the Local Group of galaxies. This source is modulated by 20% over a 106-day cycle. However, the nucleus does not appear to contain a supermassive black hole, as a best-fit value of zero mass and an upper limit of is placed on the mass of a central black hole based on models and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data. This is significantly lower than the mass expected from the velocity dispersion of the nucleus and far below any mass predicted from the disk kinematics. This may suggest that supermassive black holes are associated only with galaxy bulges instead of with their disks. Assuming that the upper limit of the central black hole is correct, it would be rather an intermediate-mass black hole.

The inner part of the galaxy has two luminous spiral arms, along with multiple spurs that connect the inner to the outer spiral features. The main arms are designated IN (north) and IS (south).

===Star formation===
In the central 4′ region of this galaxy, atomic gas is being efficiently converted to molecular gas, resulting in a strong spectral emission of CO. This effect occurs as giant molecular clouds condense out of the surrounding interstellar medium. A similar process is taking place outside the central 4′, but at a less efficient pace. About 10% of the gas content in this galaxy is in the molecular form.

Star formation is taking place at a rate that is strongly correlated with local gas density, and the rate per unit area is higher than in the neighboring Andromeda Galaxy. (The rate of star formation is about 3.4 solar masses Gyr−1 pc−2 in the Triangulum Galaxy, compared to 0.74 in Andromeda.) The total integrated rate of star formation in the Triangulum Galaxy is about . It is uncertain whether this net rate is currently decreasing or remaining constant.

Based on analysis of the chemical composition of this galaxy, it appears to be divided into two distinct components with differing histories. The inner disk within a radius of has a typical composition gradient that decreases linearly from the core. Beyond this radius, out to about , the gradient is much flatter. This suggests a different star formation history between the inner disk and the outer disk and halo, and may be explained by a scenario of &quot;inside-out&quot; galaxy formation. This occurs when gas is accumulated at large radii later in a galaxy&#x27;s life space, while the gas at the core becomes exhausted. The result is a decrease in the average age of stars with increasing radius from the galaxy core.

===Discrete features===
Using infrared observations from the Spitzer Space Telescope, a total of 515 discrete candidate sources of 24 μm emission within the Triangulum Galaxy have been catalogued as of 2007. The brightest sources lie within the central region of the galaxy and along the spiral arms.

Many of the emission sources are associated with H II regions of star formation. The four brightest HII regions are designated NGC 588, NGC 592, NGC 595, and NGC 604. These regions are associated with molecular clouds containing solar masses. The brightest of these regions, NGC 604, may have undergone a discrete outburst of star formation about three million years ago. This nebula is the second most luminous HII region within the Local Group of galaxies, at times the luminosity of the Sun. Other prominent HII regions in Triangulum include IC 132, IC 133, and IK 53.

The northern main spiral arm contains four large HII regions, while the southern arm has greater concentrations of young, hot stars. The estimated rate of supernova explosions in the Triangulum Galaxy is 0.06 Type Ia and 0.62 Type Ib/Type II per century. This is equivalent to a supernova explosion every 147 years, on average. As of 2008, a total of 100 supernova remnants have been identified in the Triangulum Galaxy, the majority of which lie in the southern half of the spiral galaxy. Similar asymmetries exist for H I and H II regions, plus highly luminous concentrations of massive, O type stars. The center of the distribution of these features is offset about two arc minutes to the southwest. M33 being a local galaxy, the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams (CBAT) tracks novae in it along with M31 and M81.

About 54 globular clusters have been identified in this galaxy, but the actual number may be 122 or more. The confirmed clusters may be several billion years younger than globular clusters in the Milky Way, and cluster formation appears to have increased during the past 100 million years. This increase is correlated with an inflow of gas into the center of the galaxy. The ultraviolet emission of massive stars in this galaxy matches the level of similar stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud.

In 2007, a black hole about 15.7 times the mass of the Sun was detected in this galaxy using data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory. The black hole, named M33 X-7, orbits a companion star which it eclipses every 3.5 days. It is the largest stellar mass black hole known.

Unlike the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies, the Triangulum Galaxy does not appear to have a supermassive black hole at its center. This may be because the mass of a galaxy&#x27;s central supermassive black hole correlates with the size of the galaxy&#x27;s central bulge, and unlike the Milky Way and Andromeda, the Triangulum Galaxy is a pure disk galaxy with no bulge.

===Relationship with the Andromeda Galaxy===
As mentioned above, M33 is linked to M31 by several streams of neutral hydrogen and stars, which suggests that a past interaction between these two galaxies took place from 2 to 8 billion years ago, and a more violent encounter will occur 2.5 billion years in the future.

The fate of M33 was uncertain in 2009 beyond seeming to be linked to its larger neighbor M31. Suggested scenarios include being torn apart and absorbed by the greater companion, fueling the latter with hydrogen to form new stars; eventually exhausting all of its gas, and thus the ability to form new stars; or participating in the collision between the Milky Way and M31, likely ending up orbiting the merger product and fusing with it much later. Two other possibilities are a collision with the Milky Way before the Andromeda Galaxy arrives or an ejection out of the Local Group. Astrometric data from Gaia appears in 2019 to rule out the possibility that M33 and M31 are in orbit. If correct, M33 is on its first infall proper into the Andromeda Galaxy (M31).

<text>The Rentals is an American rock band fronted by vocalist Matt Sharp. Sharp has been the only consistent member since the group&#x27;s inception. The band&#x27;s best selling single is &quot;Friends of P.&quot; (1995). The Rentals released two albums, &quot;Return of the Rentals&quot; (1995) and &quot;Seven More Minutes&quot; (1999) on Maverick Records before quietly splitting in 1999 following a world tour. The group reformed in 2005 and have since released several EPs and two more full-length albums, &quot;Lost in Alphaville&quot; and &quot;Q36&quot;. &quot;Lost in Alphaville&quot; released August 26, 2014, on Polyvinyl Records. &quot;Q36&quot; was released June 26, 2020. Numerous musicians have appeared with the group on recordings and in live shows. The group&#x27;s most recent iteration consists of Sharp, Nick Zinner, and Ronnie Vannucci Jr.

== History ==
Matt Sharp founded the Rentals in early 1994. They released their debut album &quot;Return of the Rentals&quot; the following year, which featured the radio hit &quot;Friends of P.&quot;. The accompanying music video was shot with antiquated equipment, on black and white film stock, with a total budget of less than $1,000. Upon its release, the video was added to MTV&#x27;s playlist in early November 1995.

Band members on &quot;Return of the Rentals&quot; included Patrick Wilson (also of Weezer) on drums, Rod Cervera (guitar), Tom Grimley (keyboards), Petra Haden (violin, vocals), and Cherielynn Westrich (vocals, Moog). Petra&#x27;s triplet sister Rachel Haden appears as an additional vocalist. After Sharp left Weezer, Wilson&#x27;s studio replacement on the drums was Kevin March, and Mike Fletcher was the band&#x27;s most frequent touring drummer. Maya Rudolph, of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; fame, also handled keyboard and backing vocals for the group&#x27;s first tours in support of its debut album. The group headlined its own club shows, and also hit larger venues, as the opening act for such well-established acts as Alanis Morissette, Garbage, Blur, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
===Return===

On October 24, 2005, the tenth anniversary of the band&#x27;s first album&#x27;s release, Sharp announced he was bringing back the Rentals after a six-year absence. 

The Last Little Life EP

On August 14, 2007 the Rentals released their first new music in more than 8 years, The Last Little Life EP. Recorded and Co-Produced by drummer Dan Joeright, The Last Little Life EP consisted of three brand new tracks, as well as a new reworking of &quot;Sweetness and Tenderness&quot; originally from the group&#x27;s 1995 debut &quot;Return of the Rentals&quot;. 

In June 2008, Sara Radle announced her departure from the group to focus on her band Calamity Magnet. On September 27, 2008, the Rentals released a new song titled &quot;Colorado&quot; on the band&#x27;s official website.

===&quot;Songs About Time&quot;===
On January 1, 2009, the Rentals announced their new yearlong multimedia project, &quot;Songs About Time.&quot;

===&quot;Resilience&quot;===
On April 12, 2011, the Rentals released an album titled &quot;Resilience&quot;. This was (as their official website states) originally recorded as part of the Songs About Time project, as accompanying music to the &#x27;Films About Weeks&#x27; videos. The album was originally titled &quot;Tokyo Blues&quot; but renamed &quot;Resilience&quot; as a commentary on the band&#x27;s perception of the character and resilience of the Japanese people after the Japanese tsunami and earthquake disaster. The band played both dates of the 2011 Nano Mugen festival in Japan.

===&quot;Q36&quot;===
On October 4, 2017, Sharp announced that he had started work on the Rentals&#x27; fourth studio album with a potential release date in the first half of 2018. &quot;The new record is a collaboration between myself, Nick Zinner and Dave Fridmann with a little help from a makeshift choir of incredible singers that I affectionately like to refer to as The Gentle Assassins.&quot; In the same announcement he revealed the new song &quot;Elon Musk Is Making Me Sad&quot; which was shared with the help of Wired. The album was released on June 26, 2020 and physically in December 2020 due to manufacturing and shipping issues.

<text>The Royal Netherlands Navy (, ) is the maritime service branch of the Netherlands Armed Forces. It was founded on 8 January 1488, making it the third-oldest naval force in the world.

During the 17th century, the navy of the Dutch Republic (1581–1795) was one of the most powerful naval forces in the world and played an active role in the Anglo-Dutch Wars, the Franco-Dutch War, and wars against Spain and several other European powers. The Batavian Navy of the later Batavian Republic (1795–1806) and Kingdom of Holland (1806–1810) played an active role in the Napoleonic Wars, though mostly dominated by French interests.

After the establishment of the modern Kingdom of the Netherlands, it served an important role in protecting Dutch colonial rule, especially in Southeast Asia, and would play a minor role in World War II, especially against the Imperial Japanese Navy. Since World War II, the Royal Netherlands Navy has taken part in expeditionary peacekeeping operations. It often participates in European Union and NATO operations.

==Ship prefixes==

An international prefix for ships of the Royal Netherlands Navy is HNLMS (&quot;His/Her Netherlands Majesty&#x27;s Ship&quot;). The Netherlands navy itself uses the prefixes Zr.Ms. () when a King is on the throne, and Hr.Ms. () when there is a Queen. This happens automatically at end of the monarch&#x27;s reign.

==History==

The modern Netherlands Navy dates its founding to a &quot;statute of admiralty&quot; issued by Maximilian, King of the Romans (future Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I), and his son Philip the Fair, the ruler of Burgundian lands (a minor at that time) on 8 January 1488.

===Netherlands Golden Age===

The Netherlands navy was involved in several wars against other European powers from the late 16th century, initially for independence against Spain in European waters, later for shipping lanes, trade and colonies in many parts of the world, notably during the Anglo-Dutch Wars. During the 17th century the Dutch States Navy was one of the most powerful navies in the world. As an organization, the Dutch navy consisted of five separate admiralties (three of them in Holland, and one each in Friesland and Zeeland), each with its own ships, personnel, shipyards, command structures and revenues.

===World War II===


At the start of WW2 the Dutch had five cruisers, eight destroyers, 24 submarines, and smaller vessels, along with 50 aircraft. The Netherlands was conquered in 1940 by Nazi Germany in a matter of days, and two Dutch light cruisers and one destroyer leader and three destroyers that were under construction were captured in their shipyard.

For the rest of the war, the Dutch navy was based in Allied countries: the Dutch navy had its headquarters in London, and smaller units in Ceylon (modern day Sri Lanka) and Western Australia. Around the world Dutch naval units were responsible for transporting troops, for example during Operation Dynamo at Dunkirk and on D-Day, they escorted convoys and attacked enemy targets. Dutch submarines scored some victories, including one on a &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; U-boat in the Mediterranean Sea, which was sunk by , but during the war the Dutch Navy suffered heavy losses, particularly in the Pacific Theatre.

A small force of submarines based in Western Australia sank more Japanese ships in the first weeks after Japan joined the war than the entire British and American navies together during the same period, an exploit which earned Admiral Helfrich the nickname &quot;Ship-a-day Helfrich&quot;. The aggressive pace of operations against the Japanese was a contributing factor to both the heavy losses sustained and the greater number of successes scored as compared to the British and Americans in the region.

But during the relentless Japanese offensive of February through April 1942 in the Dutch East Indies, the Dutch navy in Asia was virtually annihilated, particularly in the Battle of the Java Sea (27 February 1942) in which the commander, Karel Doorman, went down with his fleet along with 1,000 sailors. The Navy sustained losses of a total of 20 ships (including two of its three light cruisers) and 2,500 sailors killed in the course of the campaign. The Dutch navy had suffered from years of underfunding and came ill-prepared to face an enemy with more and heavier ships with better weapons, including the Long Lance-torpedo, with which the cruiser sank the light cruiser .

===Netherlands New Guinea===

After the war, the relations between the Netherlands and its colonies changed dramatically. The establishment of the Republic of Indonesia, two days after the Japanese surrender, thwarted the Dutch plans for restoring colonial authority. After four years of conflict the Netherlands acknowledged the independence of Indonesia.

Part of the Dutch Navy was next stationed in Netherlands New Guinea until that, too, was turned over to the Indonesian government in 1962. This followed a campaign of infiltrations by the Indonesian National Armed Forces, supported by modern equipment from the Soviet Union, that was nevertheless successfully repulsed by the Dutch navy. These infiltrations took place after the order of President Sukarno to integrate the territory as an Indonesian province.

=== European Union cooperation ===
The Navy has participated in joint European Union naval operations and exercises. Ten separate Dutch vessels have contributed to the EU Naval Force Operation Atalanta, combating Somali piracy forces in the Gulf of Aden, Arabian Sea, and Indian Ocean since 2009. The last vessel was sent in 2018; since then the Navy has only contributed staff and advisors to the mission.

===NATO cooperation===

With the creation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the military focus was on the army and air force; it was not until the Korean War (1950–53) that the navy got more recognition. The government allowed the creation of a balanced fleet consisting of two naval squadrons. Apart from the aircraft carrier the Dutch navy consisted of two light cruisers (two ), 12 destroyers (four , eight ), eight submarines, six frigates (s), and a considerable number of minesweepers.

As a member of NATO, the Netherlands developed its security policy in close cooperation with other members. The establishment of the Warsaw pact in 1955 intensified the arms race between West and East. Technical innovations rapidly emerged, the introduction of radar and sonar were followed by nuclear weapon systems and long-range missiles. The geopolitical situation allowed for a fixed military strategy. Beginning in 1965, the Dutch Navy joined certain permanent NATO squadrons like the Standing Naval Force Atlantic.

== Structure ==
The constituent parts of the Royal Netherlands Navy are:

===Naval squadron===
Contains all surface combatants, replenishment ships, and amphibious support ships.

=== Submarine service ===

Houses the submarines and a support vessel.

=== Mine Detection and Clearing Service ===

Contains various minehunters.

=== Hydrographic Service ===
The Hydrographic Service is responsible for relevant hydrographic surveys.

===Social Medical Service===
Provides healthcare to personnel of the Royal Netherlands Navy.

===Directorate of Materiel Sustainment===
The Directorate of Materiel Sustainment is responsible for the maintenance of ships, submarines and systems.

=== Naval aviation ===

Two squadrons equipped with NH90 NFH helicopter based at De Kooy Airfield.

=== Netherlands Marine Corps ===

* Two Marine Combat Groups (1 MCG and 2 MCG)
* One Maritime Special Operations Force (NLMARSOF)
* One Surface Assault and Training Group (SATG)
* One Seabased Support Group (SSG)
* 32 Raiding Squadron (permanently stationed at Aruba)
* Rotterdam Marine Band of the Royal Netherlands Navy

===Dutch Caribbean Naval Command===
Command of the Royal Netherlands Navy that is responsible for national defense and international law enforcement in the Dutch Caribbean.

=== Netherlands &amp; Dutch Caribbean Coastguard ===
Although the Netherlands Coastguard is not an official part of the Navy, it is under its operational control. Also the Dutch Caribbean Coast Guard is under the operational control of the Navy and is commanded by the commander of the Navy in the Caribbean.

==Bases==
The main naval base, Nieuwe Haven Naval Base is situated in Den Helder, North Holland. Secondary bases are situated around Den Helder, as well as in Amsterdam, and Willemstad on the Caribbean island of (Curaçao), Usage rights are also in place for port facilities in Rotterdam, Vlissingen and Eemshaven. The Netherlands Marine Corps has barracks in Rotterdam, Doorn, Texel and Den Helder, as well as in the Caribbean at Suffisant on Curaçao, and Savaneta on Aruba. There is also Pointe Blanche Naval Support Point in Sint Maarten.

==Officer training==
Officers of the Nederland Navy are trained at the Royal Naval Institute (), which is part of the Netherlands defence academy () in Den Helder.
Around 100-120 people start training every year.

== Ships of the Royal Netherlands Navy ==
=== Ships ===
The Royal Netherlands Navy currently operates 7 main classes of vessels:
Note: in the Royal Netherlands Navy frigates are interchangeable with destroyers as there is no separate class
The Royal Netherlands Navy classifies the &quot;De Zeven Provinciën&quot;-class as frigates, but internationally they are most comparable to destroyers (due to their size and weapon capability) platform for Sea Based Anti-Ballistic Missile defence

=== Inventory ===
The total tonnage will be approx. 140,000 tonnes. Next to these ships a lot of other smaller vessels remain in the navy.

With these changes the Royal Netherlands Navy will have 10 large oceangoing vessels ranging from medium/low to high combat action ships. The renewed Dutch Navy will be a green-water navy, having enough frigates and auxiliaries to operate far out at sea, while depending on land-based air support, and, with the large amphibious squadron, they will have significant brown-water navy capabilities.

== Other equipment of the Royal Netherlands Navy ==

=== Naval aviation - Maritime helicopters ===

* 19 NH90, 11 NATO Frigate Helicopter (NFH) and eight transport version of the NATO Frigate Helicopter (TNFH) for Marine Corps Air Lift Helicopter Squadron. One NFH was lost on 19 July 2020 as result of a crash in the Caribbean Sea near the island of Aruba, killing two of the four crew on board.

Since the retirement of the Westland Lynx, the Royal Netherlands Air Force fills the gap of the Lynx&#x27;s amphibious task with Airbus AS-532U2 Cougar helicopters. The Cougar&#x27;s main task is to support the Royal Netherlands Marine Corps on board of the LPD&#x27;s and JSS. Other tasks are to provide Medical air transport to and from these ships, but also support SOF units in amphibious missions and trainings.

In 2012 an AH-64D Apache attack helicopter from the Royal Netherlands Air Force made a deck landing on board for the first time as part of an initial study into the possibilities for wider use of the helicopters as these will be upgraded to the AH-64E standard which has specific features for maritime operations.

The Dutch amphibious support ship and the JSS HNLMS &quot;Karel Doorman&quot; are designed to handle Royal Netherlands Air Force CH-47F Chinook helicopters but still require additional anti corrosion measures (part of the ongoing upgrade of the CH-47F).

== Future changes ==
In April 2018, the Dutch Government approved a multi-year investment program and allocated funds for the 2018–2030 period, including:

* The s replacement with new boats planned for initial service entry in 2034. The subs are currently undergoing a Service-life Extension Program (SLEP), including new sonar, new optronic periscope and weapon upgrades for near shore operations. The Royal Dutch Navy is evaluating Saab/Damen (A-26), TKMS (Upgraded 212), Navantia S-80 and a Naval Group (SSK version of Barracuda) proposal. In 2019 the S-80 option was dropped, originally with plans to place an order for the winning design in 2022 and having the first boat in service in 2028 and the first two by 2031. However, in October 2021 it was reported that this timeline was no longer feasible. Instead, the Dutch Ministry of Defence signalled that the envisaged dates would have to be &quot;substantially adjusted&quot;. In April 2022 it was announced that the revised schedule for the construction of the new replacement boats would likely see the first two replacement vessels entering service in the 2034 to 2037 timeframe. On 15 March 2024 State Secretary for Defence Christophe van der Maat officially announced that Naval Group has been selected as the winning bid.
* Upgrading the &quot;De Zeven Provinciën&quot;-class LCF frigates Theatre Ballistic Missile Defense, acquisition of RIM-161 Standard Missile 3 (SM-3), a new OtoMelara 127/64 LW canon, ESSM-2 and SLCM BGM-109 Tomahawk and expanding the Mk41 VLS with an additional 8 cell unit.
* Acquisition of initially two Multifunctional Support Ships to supplement existing LCF Frigates with extra container based AAW Barak-ER missiles and IAI Harop loitering munition in support of amphibious forces.
* Replacement of the &quot;Karel Doorman&quot;-class M frigates in the 2028/2030 period by 4 ships(plus another 2 for the Belgian Navy), designed &amp; built by Damen Shipyards. See Future Surface Combatant for more information.
* Replacement of the 6 &quot;Alkmaar&quot;-class MCM ships from 2025 including MCM Drones. 6 units each will be built for both the Belgian and Dutch navies for a total of 12 ships. The contract was won by Naval Group on 15 March 2019 for the construction of 12 City-class mine countermeasures vessels.
* Increasing the size of the Royal Netherlands Marine Corps to remain highly integrated with the British Royal Marines. In 2017 the Ministry of Defence announced the formation of a Fleet Marine Squadron for the protection of merchant ships.
* In June 2023, the British and Dutch governments announced that the two countries would &quot;explore opportunities&quot; to jointly develop new specialist amphibious warships which for the Royal Netherlands Navy would likely replace the &quot;Rotterdam&quot;-class landing platform docks.
* The German Navy Seebatallion (Marines) will be integrated into the Royal Netherlands Marine Corps.
* Cooperation with the German Navy regarding Submarine &amp; Amphibious Operations.
* Acquisition of a new Combat Support Ship to replace the former Zr.Ms. Amsterdam, designed &amp; build by Damen Shipyards. This ship will be based on the JSS Karel Doorman design to improve type commonality (architecture &amp; components) and is expected to be delivered in 2024. The ship will be named Zr.Ms. Den Helder after the city of Den Helder, with the pennant A834. First steel was cut in December 2020 and the ship was launched in October 2022.
* Replacement of Zr.Ms. Mercuur, Zr.Ms. Pelikaan, the four diving support vessels, the diving training vessel Zr.Ms. Soemba, the hydographic vessels Zr.Ms. Snellius en Zr.Ms. Luymes and the training vessel Van Kinsbergen from 2024 onwards.
* Acquisition of new landing craft from 2025 with additional capacity to support amphibious operations and the integration of the German Navy Marines (Seebatallion). In March 2023, a report to the Dutch Parliament outlined a plan for 12 Littoral Assault Craft (LAC) and 8 Littoral Craft Mobility (LCM) to replace the 12 existing light landing craft (Landing Craft Vehicles and Personnel - LCVP) and improve on their capability.
* Main Naval Ship Based Weapons will be replaced by acquiring ESSM-2, new 127mm canons, Harpoon ASuW replacement, SM-3, SM-2 IIIC SAM, Goalkeeper CIWS replacement, MK 46 &amp; MK 48 Torpedo replacement and SLCM.

=== Theater ballistic missile defence ===
Together with the United States and several other NATO members, the Dutch Navy is testing and updating its ships for Tactical ballistic missile defense capability. Although tests conducted concerning the capability of the APAR (Active Phased Array Radar) have been very successful, in 2018 the Dutch Government approved plans to acquire the SM-3 missiles for integration into the existing weapon suite of the LCF frigates. The four LCF ships will be fitted out with eight SM-3 missiles each (they are provisioned for this VLS extension) through Foreign Military Sales (under discussion between the US and The Netherlands).

<text>The Naval Vessel Register (NVR) is the official inventory of ships and service craft in custody of or titled by the United States Navy. It contains information on ships and service craft that make up the official inventory of the Navy from the time a vessel is authorized through its life cycle and disposal. It also includes ships that have been removed from the register (often termed &quot;&quot; or &quot;struck&quot;), but not disposed of by sale, transfer to another government, or other means. Ships and service craft disposed of prior to 1987 are not included, but are gradually being added along with other updates.

== History ==
The NVR traces its origin back to the 1880s, having evolved from several previous publications. In 1911, the Bureau of Construction and Repair published &quot;Ships Data US Naval Vessels&quot;, which subsequently became the &quot;Ships Data Book&quot; in 1952 under the Bureau of Ships. The Bureau of Ordnance&#x27;s &quot;Vessel Register&quot;, first published in 1942 and retitled &quot;Naval Vessel Register&quot;, was combined with the &quot;Ships Data Book&quot; under the Bureau of Ships in 1959.

Since 1962, the NVR has been maintained and published by the NAVSEA Shipbuilding Support Office (NAVSHIPSO) of the Naval Sea Systems Command. Referred to by Congress in the statutes of , the NVR is maintained as directed by U.S. Navy Regulations, Article 0406, of September 14, 1990.

The vessels are listed in the NVR when the classification and hull number(s) are assigned to ships and service craft authorized to be built by the President of the United States, or when the Chief of Naval Operations requests instatement or reinstatement of vessels as approved by the Secretary of the Navy. Once listed, the ship or service craft remains in the NVR throughout its life as a Navy asset. Afterwards, its final disposition is recorded. Many vessels struck from the NVR are transferred to the Navy Inactive Fleet or to the United States Maritime Administration (MARAD) to become part of the National Defense Reserve Fleet. Some continue limited operation in the Ready Reserve Fleet.

The NVR is updated weekly and as of the 2010s is only available in electronic form online. Over 6,500 separate record transactions are processed annually with each being supported by official documentation. The NVR includes a list of ships and service craft on hand, under construction, converted, loaned/leased, or to be loaned, and those assigned to the Military Sealift Command. Ship class, fleet assignment, name, age, home port, planning yard, custodian, hull and machinery characteristics, builder, key construction dates, battle forces, local defense and miscellaneous support forces, and status conditions are some of the data elements provided.

In March 2014, the Navy started counting self-deployable support ships for the fleet such as minesweepers, surveillance craft, and tugs as part of its &quot;battle fleet&quot; in order to reach a count of 272 as of October 2016.

<doc id="198480" wikidata="Q7317250" url="?curid=198480" title="Return of the Rentals">
<text>Return of the Rentals is the debut studio album by American alternative rock band The Rentals, released on October 31, 1995, through Maverick Records and Reprise Records. The album features Matt Sharp—Weezer&#x27;s bassist at the time—on vocals and bass, as well as Weezer drummer Patrick Wilson.

&quot;Return of the Rentals&quot; was well received by critics and produced the successful single &quot;Friends of P.&quot;, which peaked at number 7 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Modern Rock Tracks chart and received significant airplay on MTV&#x27;s &quot;120 Minutes&quot;. Despite this, the album only managed to reach number 19 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Heatseeker Albums chart, and by 1999 the album had sold 96,000 copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

In a 2019 Reddit AMA, Matt Sharp revealed that the artwork and the master tapes of &quot;Return of the Rentals&quot; have either been lost or destroyed by the record label, meaning a reissue of the album is unlikely.

==Background==
The &quot;P&quot; in the track &quot;Friends of P.&quot; has had multiple theories presented as to its meaning. The actual &quot;P&quot; in the song refers to Paulina Porizkova, the wife of The Cars guitarist Ric Ocasek, who produced the first Weezer album, known as &quot;The Blue Album&quot;. Porizkova made a claim that no one had ever written a song about her, and so Sharp took on the task. Ocasek noted that he found the subject matter of the song a bit odd. Fictitious theories suggest that &quot;P&quot; refers to the Psychic Friends Network or Patrick Wilson, who played drums for both The Rentals and Weezer.

&quot;Please Let That Be You&quot; was originally written by Sharp and Rivers Cuomo as a song called &quot;Mrs. Young&quot;, a spiritual counterpart to Weezer&#x27;s song &quot;Jamie&quot;. On one demo, Rivers Cuomo helps Sharp, doing extra instrumentation and backup vocals. At one point, Weezer considered recording both &quot;Jamie&quot; with &quot;Mrs. Young&quot; (later written as &quot;Please Let That Be You&quot; without Rivers Cuomo but instead with Rachel Haden) as its B-side for a single, but this never happened.

==Reception==
&quot;Return of the Rentals&quot; received generally favorable reviews from critics. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; claimed, &quot;Its winsome love songs make for good, clean, disposable fun.&quot; &quot;Q&quot; compared the Rentals&#x27; work to the early work of the Cars: &quot;The Rentals root themselves in the sound of late-’70s US new wave; the result is in many senses reminiscent of The Cars&#x27; earlier material.&quot; &quot;NME&quot; wrote that &quot;despite its pretensions to [be] meaningless electro-pop, it can&#x27;t help but have depth&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Ryan Schreiber enjoyed the band&#x27;s attempt to bring back Moog synthesizers.

In a retrospective review, Peter D&#x27;Angelo of AllMusic praised the album, saying, &quot;&quot;Return of the Rentals&quot; is a real benchmark of carefree pop from the &#x27;90s, and shouldn&#x27;t be forgotten anytime soon.&quot;

==Legacy==
&quot;Waiting&quot; appeared in the 1997 horror anthology film &quot;Campfire Tales&quot;. The song plays in a character&#x27;s bedroom during the film&#x27;s third segment, titled &quot;People Can Lick Too&quot;.

In 2006, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs covered &quot;The Love I&#x27;m Searching For&quot; on AOL&#x27;s &quot;The Interface&quot; podcast. In 2008, Ash covered &quot;Please Let That Be You&quot; for the album &quot;Friends of P. -- Tribute to The Rentals&quot;. &quot;Friends of P.&quot; was covered by Tokyo Police Club on their album &quot;Elephant Shell Remixes&quot; and sampled by Girl Talk on his 2006 album &quot;Night Ripper&quot;.

Tera Melos guitarist Nick Reinhart uploaded a cover of the track &quot;These Days&quot; to SoundCloud.

<text>Viking Olov Björk (3 December 1918, in Sunnansjö, Dalarna – 18 February 2009) was a Swedish cardiac surgeon.

==Early life and education==
Björk wrote his dissertation in 1948, titled &quot;Brain perfusion in dogs with artificially oxygenated blood&quot;.

==Björk–Shiley valve==

In 1968, he collaborated with American engineer Donald Shiley to develop the Björk–Shiley valve, a mechanical prosthetic heart valve. It was the first &quot;tilting disc valve&quot;, used to replace the aortic or mitral valve. Many modifications followed, including the convexo-concave valve. The convexo-concave valve had defects in form of strut fractures. Therefore, the monostrut valve was introduced to prevent outflow strut fractures.

The Bjork–Shiley valve was manufactured by Pfizer after they bought the Shiley company in 1979. In 1980 Björk wrote to Pfizer threatening to publish cases of valve failures—often fatal to the patients—unless corrective action was taken. This eventually led to long lawsuit that involved the recall of all existing valves and Pfizer allocating up to US$20 million to pay compensation.

==Death==
Björk died on 18 February 2009 in Stockholm.

<text>Kimberly-Clark Corporation is an American multinational consumer goods and personal care corporation that produces mostly paper-based consumer products. The company manufactures sanitary paper products and surgical &amp; medical instruments. Kimberly-Clark brand name products include Kleenex facial tissue, Kotex feminine hygiene products, Cottonelle, Scott and Andrex toilet paper, Wypall utility wipes, KimWipes scientific cleaning wipes and Huggies disposable diapers and baby wipes.

Founded in Neenah, Wisconsin, in 1872 and based in the Las Colinas section of Irving, Texas, since 1985, the company operated its own paper mills around the world for decades, but closed the last of those in 2012. With recent annual revenues topping $18 billion per year, Kimberly-Clark is regularly listed among the Fortune 500. As of March 2020, the company had approximately 40,000 employees.

==History==

Kimberly, Clark and Co. was founded in 1872 by John A. Kimberly, Havilah Babcock, Charles B. Clark and Franklyn C. Shattuck in Neenah, Wisconsin, with $42,000 () of capital. The group&#x27;s first business was operating paper mills, which the collective expanded throughout the following decades. In 1888, the fledgling company faced a significant setback when its groundwood &quot;Atlas&quot; paper mill burned. Through an extensive effort by labor and management, within five months the mill was rebuilt and in production at a greater capacity. In that same year the company began rapid expansion, purchasing land in a town then known as The Cedars for a new groundwood pulp plant designed by prominent paper mill architects D. H. &amp; A. B. Tower. In 1889, the town was renamed Kimberly after John A. Kimberly. The company would also contract the firm to expand its vast sulphite pulp complex in Appleton, Wisconsin, which allowed it to become the first firm west of Pennsylvania to adopt this improved manufacturing process. The company developed cellu-cotton in 1914, a cotton substitute used by the U.S. Army as surgical cotton during World War I. Army nurses used cellu-cotton pads as disposable sanitary napkins, and six years later the company introduced Kotex, the first disposable feminine hygiene product. Kleenex, a disposable handkerchief, followed in 1924. Kimberly &amp; Clark joined with The New York Times Company in 1926 to build a newsprint mill in Kapuskasing, Ontario, Canada. Two years later, the company went public as Kimberly-Clark.

The firm expanded internationally during the 1950s, opening plants in Mexico, West Germany and the United Kingdom. It began operations in 17 more foreign locations in the 1960s. The company formed Midwest Express Airlines from its corporate flight department in 1984. Kimberly-Clark&#x27;s headquarters moved from Neenah, Wisconsin to Irving, Texas the following year, although its products are still produced in Neenah. Alongside Cadbury, Kimberly-Clark withdrew advertising support for &quot;Lou Grant&quot; in 1982, due to pressure from various conservative caucuses campaigning against star Ed Asner. Under the leadership of Darwin Smith as CEO from 1971 to 1991, the company was transformed from a business paper company to a consumer paper products company.

In 1991, Kimberly-Clark and The New York Times Company sold their jointly owned paper mill in Kapuskasing, Ontario. Kimberly-Clark entered a joint venture with Buenos Aires-based Descartables Argentinos S.A. to produce personal care products in Argentina in 1994 and also bought the feminine hygiene unit of VP-Schickedanz (Germany) for $123 million and a 90% stake in Handan Comfort and Beauty Group (China).

Kimberly-Clark merged with Scott Paper in 1995 for $9.4 billion. In 1997, Kimberly-Clark sold its 50% stake in Canada&#x27;s Scott Paper to forest products company Kruger Inc. and bought diaper operations in Spain and Portugal and disposable surgical masks maker Tecnol Medical Products. Augmenting its presence in Germany, Switzerland and Austria, in 1999 the company paid $365 million for the tissue business of Swiss-based Attisholz Holding. Expanding its offerings of medical products, the company bought Ballard Medical Products in 1999 for $774 million and examination-glove maker Safeskin in 2000 for about $800 million.

Also in 2000, the company bought virtually all of Taiwan&#x27;s S-K Corporation; the move made Kimberly-Clark one of the largest manufacturers of packaged goods in Taiwan. The company later purchased Taiwan Scott Paper Corporation for about $40 million and merged the two companies, forming Kimberly-Clark Taiwan. In 2001, Kimberly-Clark bought Italian diaper maker Linostar and announced it was closing four Latin American manufacturing plants. 

In 2002, Kimberly-Clark purchased paper-packaging rival Amcor&#x27;s stake in an Australian joint venture. In 2003, Kimberly-Clark added to its global consumer tissue business by acquiring the Polish tissue maker Klucze.

In early 2004, chairman and chief executive officer Thomas Falk began implementation of a global business plan that the company has detailed in July 2003. The firm combined its North American and European groups for personal care and consumer tissue under North Atlantic groups. In 2019, CEO Thomas Falk resigned his position but continued on as the company&#x27;s chairman of the board. COO Michael D. Hsu became CEO following Falk&#x27;s retirement.

As of March 2020, the company had approximately 40,000 employees. In April 2020, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; reported that panic-buying during the COVID-19 pandemic led to a 13 percent increase in sales of Kimberley-Clark&#x27;s consumer tissues in the first quarter of 2020 compared with the previous year. In April 2020, Kimberly Clark reported an eight percent decline in organic sales, its worst sales performance in at least a decade, according to the Wall Street Journal.

In 2022, Kimberly Clark acquired majority stake in Thinx, a period underwear brand.

== Russia business operations ==
Following Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Kimberly-Clark maintained its operations in Russia. In March 2022, the company announced the suspension of capital investments and advertising in Russia but continued to produce and sell health and hygiene products. As of 2023, the Russian subsidiary employed approximately 2,259 people and reported revenues of $497 million in Russia.

==Ownership and subsidiaries==
Kimberly-Clark shares are mainly held by institutional investors (The Vanguard Group, BlackRock, State Street Corporation, and others). Its subsidiaries include Kimberly-Clark Professional.

=== Midwest Airlines ===
The origin of Midwest Airlines can be traced back to 1948, when Kimberly-Clark opened its corporate flight department and began providing air transportation for company executives and engineers between the company&#x27;s headquarters in Neenah and its paper mills.

In 1969, K-C Aviation was born from the company&#x27;s air operations, and was dedicated to the maintenance of corporate aircraft. In 1982, K-C Aviation initiated shuttle flights for Kimberly-Clark employees between Appleton, Memphis, and Atlanta. With this experience, and considering the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, Kimberly-Clark and K-C Aviation formed a regularly scheduled passenger airline, Midwest Express Airlines, which was started on June 11, 1984. The name of the airline was shortened to Midwest Airlines in 2003.

K-C Aviation divested itself from the airline in 1996. Two years later, Gulfstream Aerospace purchased K-C Aviation from Kimberly-Clark for $250 million, which included its operations at airports in Dallas, Appleton, and Westfield, Massachusetts.

In June 2019, the Australian Federal Court found in favour of Kimberly-Clark Australia in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission&#x27;s (ACCC) case against them for the claim that Kleenex Cottonelle Flushable Cleansing Cloths were advertised as &quot;flushable&quot; in Australia&#x27;s sewerage system, in contrast to other similar products which warned consumers against flushing them.
The court said that although they contributed to household sewerage system blockages in an unknown number of instances, even faecal matter and toilet paper contributed to those problems. ACCC argued unsuccessfully that Kimberly-Clark shouldn&#x27;t be able to take advantage of the difficulty to isolate individual causes in individual cases, and that it was a significant cause of systematic issues.
On October 13, 2020, the Cottonelle brand flushable wipes issued a recall because the products manufactured between February through September may contain &quot;Pluralibacter gergovaie&quot;.

<text>Leishmaniasis is a wide array of clinical manifestations caused by protozoal parasites of the Trypanosomatida genus &quot;Leishmania&quot;. It is generally spread through the bite of phlebotomine sandflies, &quot;Phlebotomus&quot; and &quot;Lutzomyia&quot;, and occurs most frequently in the tropics and sub-tropics of Africa, Asia, the Americas, and southern Europe. The disease can present in three main ways: cutaneous, mucocutaneous, or visceral. The cutaneous form presents with skin ulcers, while the mucocutaneous form presents with ulcers of the skin, mouth, and nose. The visceral form starts with skin ulcers and later presents with fever, low red blood cell count, and enlarged spleen and liver.
Infections in humans are caused by more than 20 species of &quot;Leishmania&quot;. Risk factors include poverty, malnutrition, deforestation, and urbanization. All three types can be diagnosed by seeing the parasites under microscopy. Additionally, visceral disease can be diagnosed by blood tests.
Leishmaniasis can be partly prevented by sleeping under nets treated with insecticide. Other measures include spraying insecticides to kill sandflies and treating people with the disease early to prevent further spread. The treatment needed is determined by where the disease is acquired, the species of &quot;Leishmania&quot;, and the type of infection. Some possible medications used for visceral disease include liposomal amphotericin B, a combination of pentavalent antimonials and paromomycin, and miltefosine. For cutaneous disease, paromomycin, fluconazole, or pentamidine may be effective.
About 4 to 12 million people are currently infected in some 98 countries. About 2 million new cases and between 20 and 50 thousand deaths occur each year. About 200 million people in Asia, Africa, South and Central America, and southern Europe live in areas where the disease is common. The World Health Organization has obtained discounts on some medications to treat the disease. It is classified as a neglected tropical disease. The disease may occur in a number of other animals, including dogs and rodents.

==Signs and symptoms==

The symptoms of leishmaniasis are skin sores which erupt weeks to months after the person is bitten by infected sandflies.

Leishmaniasis may be divided into the following types:
* Cutaneous leishmaniasis is the most common form, which causes an open sore at each bite site, which heals in a few months to a year and a half, leaving an unpleasant-looking scar.
** Diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis produces widespread skin lesions which resemble leprosy, and may not heal on their own.

* Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis causes both skin and mucosal ulcers with damage primarily of the nose and mouth.
* Visceral leishmaniasis or &quot;kala-azar&quot; (&#x27;black fever&#x27;) is the most serious form and is generally fatal if untreated. Other consequences, which can occur a few months to years after infection, include fever, damage to the spleen and liver, and anemia.

Leishmaniasis is considered one of the classic causes of a markedly enlarged (and therefore palpable) spleen; the organ, which is not normally felt during the examination of the abdomen, may even become larger than the liver in severe cases.

==Cause==

Leishmaniasis is transmitted by the bite of infected female phlebotomine sandflies which can transmit the protozoa &quot;Leishmania&quot;. The sandflies inject the infective stage, metacyclic promastigotes, during blood meals. Metacyclic promastigotes in the puncture wound are phagocytized by macrophages, and transform into amastigotes. Amastigotes multiply in infected cells and affect different tissues, depending in part on the host, and in part on which &quot;Leishmania&quot; species is involved. These differing tissue specificities cause the differing clinical manifestations of the various forms of leishmaniasis. Sandflies become infected during blood meals on infected hosts when they ingest macrophages infected with amastigotes. In the sandfly&#x27;s midgut, the parasites differentiate into promastigotes, which multiply, differentiate into metacyclic promastigotes, and migrate to the proboscis.

The genomes of three &quot;Leishmania&quot; species (&quot;L. major&quot;, &quot;L. infantum&quot;, and &quot;L. braziliensis&quot;) have been sequenced, and this has provided much information about the biology of the parasite. For example, in &quot;Leishmania&quot;, protein-coding genes are understood to be organized as large polycistronic units in a head-to-head or tail-to-tail manner; RNA polymerase II transcribes long polycistronic messages in the absence of defined RNA pol II promoters, and &quot;Leishmania&quot; has unique features concerning the regulation of gene expression in response to changes in the environment. The new knowledge from these studies may help identify new targets for urgently needed drugs and aid the development of vaccines.

===Vector===
Although most of the literature mentions only one genus transmitting &quot;Leishmania&quot; to humans (&quot;Lutzomyia&quot;) in the New World, a 2003 study by Galati suggested a new classification for New World sand flies, elevating several subgenera to the genus level. Elsewhere in the world, the genus &quot;Phlebotomus&quot; is considered the vector of leishmaniasis.

===Possible non-human reservoirs===
Some cases of infection of non-human animals of human-infecting species of Leishmania have been observed. In one study, &quot;L. major&quot; was identified in twelve out of ninety-one wild western lowland gorilla fecal samples and in a study of fifty-two captive non-human primates under zoo captivity in a leishmaniasis endemic area, eight (all three chimpanzees, three golden lion tamarins, a tufted capuchin, and an Angolan talapoin), were found to be infected with &quot;L. infantum&quot; and capable of infecting &quot;Lutzomyia longipalpis&quot; sand flies, although &quot;parasite loads in infected sand flies observed in this study were considered low&quot;.

===Organisms===
Visceral disease is usually caused by &quot;Leishmania donovani&quot;, &quot;L. infantum&quot;, or &quot;L. chagasi&quot;, but occasionally these species may cause other forms of disease. The cutaneous form of the disease is caused by more than 15 species of &quot;Leishmania&quot;.

===Risk factors===
Risk factors include malnutrition, deforestation, lack of sanitation, suppressed immune system, and urbanization.

==Diagnosis==

Leishmaniasis is diagnosed in the hematology laboratory by direct visualization of the amastigotes (Leishman–Donovan bodies). Buffy-coat preparations of peripheral blood or aspirates from marrow, spleen, lymph nodes, or skin lesions should be spread on a slide to make a thin smear and stained with Leishman stain or Giemsa stain (pH 7.2) for 20 minutes. Amastigotes are seen within blood and spleen monocytes or, less commonly, in circulating neutrophils and in aspirated tissue macrophages. They are small, round bodies 2–4 μm in diameter with indistinct cytoplasm, a nucleus, and a small, rod-shaped kinetoplast. Occasionally, amastigotes may be seen lying free between cells. However, the retrieval of tissue samples is often painful for the patient and identification of the infected cells can be difficult. So, other indirect immunological methods of diagnosis are developed, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, antigen-coated dipsticks, and direct agglutination test. Although these tests are readily available, they are not the standard diagnostic tests due to their insufficient sensitivity and specificity.

Several different polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests are available for the detection of &quot;Leishmania&quot; DNA. With this assay, a specific and sensitive diagnostic procedure is finally possible. The most sensitive PCR tests use minicircle kinetoplast DNA found in the parasite. Kinetoplast DNA contains sequences for mitochondrial proteins in its maxicircles(~25–50 per parasite), and guide RNA in its minicircles(~10&#x27;000 per parasite) of the kinetoplast. With this specific method, one can still detect Leishmania even with a very low parasite load. When needing to diagnose a specific species of Leishmania, as opposed to only detection, other PCR methods have been superior.

Most forms of the disease are transmitted only from nonhuman animals, but some can be spread between humans. Infections in humans are caused by about 21 of 30 species that infect mammals; the different species look the same, but they can be differentiated by isoenzyme analysis, DNA sequence analysis, or monoclonal antibodies.

==Prevention==
* Using insect repellent on exposed skin and under the ends of sleeves and pant legs. Follow the instructions on the label of the repellent. The most effective repellents generally are those that contain the chemical DEET (N,N-diethylmetatoluamide)
* Leishmaniasis can be partly prevented by using nets treated with insecticide or insect repellent while sleeping. To provide good protection against sandflies, fine mesh sizes of 0.6 mm or less are required, but a mosquito net with 1.2mm mesh will provide a limited reduction in the number of sandfly bites. Finer mesh sizes have the downside of higher cost and reduced air circulation which can cause overheating. Many Phlebotomine sandfly attacks occur at sunset rather than at night, so it may also be useful to put nets over doors and windows or to use insect repellents.
* Use of insecticide-impregnated dog collars and treatment or culling of infected dogs.
* Spraying houses and animal shelters with insecticides.

==Treatment==

The treatment is determined by where the disease is acquired, the species of &quot;Leishmania&quot;, and the type of infection.

For visceral leishmaniasis in India, South America, and the Mediterranean, liposomal amphotericin B is the recommended treatment and is often used as a single dose. Rates of cure with a single dose of amphotericin have been reported as 95%. In India, almost all infections are resistant to pentavalent antimonials. In Africa, a combination of pentavalent antimonials and paromomycin is recommended. These, however, can have significant side effects. Miltefosine, an oral medication, is effective against both visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis. Side effects are generally mild, though it can cause birth defects if taken within three months of getting pregnant. It does not appear to work for &quot;L. major&quot; or &quot;L. braziliensis&quot;. Trifluralin, a herbicide, is shown to be effective treatment as ointment, without hemolytic or cell-toxic side-effects.
The evidence around the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis is poor. Several topical treatments may be used for cutaneous leishmaniasis. Which treatments are effective depends on the strain, with topical paromomycin effective for &quot;L. major&quot;, &quot;L. tropica&quot;, &quot;L. mexicana&quot;, &quot;L. panamensis&quot;, and &quot;L. braziliensis&quot;. Pentamidine is effective for &quot;L. guyanensis&quot;. Oral fluconazole or itraconazole appears effective in &quot;L. major&quot; and &quot;L. tropica&quot;. There is limited evidence to support the use of heat therapy in cutaneous leishmaniasis as of 2015.

No studies have determined the effect of oral nutritional supplements on visceral leishmaniasis being treated with anti-leishmanial drug therapy.

==Epidemiology==

Out of 200 countries and territories reporting to WHO, 97 countries and territories are endemic for leishmaniasis. The settings in which leishmaniasis is found range from rainforests in Central and South America to deserts in western Asia and the Middle East. It affects as many as 12 million people worldwide, with 1.5–2.0 million new cases each year. The visceral form of leishmaniasis has an estimated incidence of 500,000 new
cases. In 2014, more than 90% of new cases reported to WHO occurred in six countries: Brazil, Ethiopia, India, Somalia, South Sudan and Sudan. it caused about 52,000 deaths, down from 87,000 in 1990. Different types of the disease occur in different regions of the world. Cutaneous disease is most common in Afghanistan, Algeria, Brazil, Colombia, and Iran, while mucocutaneous disease is most common in Bolivia, Brazil, and Peru, and visceral disease is most common in Bangladesh, Brazil, Ethiopia, India, and Sudan.

Leishmaniasis is found through much of the Americas from northern Argentina to South Texas, though not in Uruguay or Chile, and has recently been shown to be spreading to North Texas and Oklahoma, and further expansion to the north may be facilitated by climate change as more habitat becomes suitable for vector and reservoir species for leishmaniasis. Leishmaniasis is also known as &quot;papalomoyo&quot;, &quot;papa lo moyo,&quot; &quot;úlcera de los chicleros&quot;, and &quot;chiclera&quot; in Latin America.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://almanaqueept.net/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; During 2004, an estimated 3,400 troops from the Colombian army, operating in the jungles near the south of the country (in particular around the Meta and Guaviare departments), were infected with leishmaniasis. Allegedly, a contributing factor was that many of the affected soldiers did not use the officially provided insect repellent because of its disturbing odor. Nearly 13,000 cases of the disease were recorded in all of Colombia throughout 2004, and about 360 new instances of the disease among soldiers had been reported in February 2005.

The disease is found across much of Asia and in the Middle East. Within Afghanistan, leishmaniasis occurs commonly in Kabul, partly due to bad sanitation and waste left uncollected in streets, allowing parasite-spreading sand flies an environment they find favorable. In Kabul, the number of people infected was estimated to be at least 200,000, and in three other towns (Herat, Kandahar, and Mazar-i-Sharif) about 70,000 more occurred, according to WHO figures from 2002. Kabul is estimated as the largest center of cutaneous leishmaniasis in the world, with around 67,500 cases as of 2004. Africa, in particular, the East and North, is also home to cases of leishmaniasis. Leishmaniasis is considered endemic also in some parts of southern parts of western Europe and has spread towards the north in recent years. For example, an outbreak of cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis was reported from Madrid, Spain, between 2010 and 2012.

Leishmaniasis is mostly a disease of the developing world and is rarely known in the developed world outside a small number of cases, mostly in instances where troops are stationed away from their home countries. Leishmaniasis has been reported by U.S. troops stationed in Saudi Arabia and Iraq since the Gulf War of 1990, including visceral leishmaniasis.
In September 2005, the disease was contracted by at least four Dutch marines who were stationed in Mazar-i-Sharif, Afghanistan, and subsequently repatriated for treatment.

==History==
Descriptions of conspicuous lesions similar to cutaneous leishmaniasis appear on tablets from King Ashurbanipal from the seventh century BCE, some of which may have derived from even earlier texts from 1500 to 2500 BCE. Persian physicians, including Avicenna in the 10th century CE, gave detailed descriptions of what was called &quot;balkh&quot; sore. In 1756, Alexander Russell, after examining a Turkish patient, gave one of the most detailed clinical descriptions of the disease. Physicians in the Indian subcontinent would describe it as &quot;kala-azar&quot; (pronounced &quot;kālā āzār&quot;, the Urdu, Hindi, and Hindustani phrase for &quot;black fever&quot;, &quot;kālā&quot; meaning black and &quot;āzār&quot; meaning fever or disease). In the Americas, evidence of the cutaneous form of the disease in Ecuador and Peru appears in pre-Inca pottery depicting skin lesions and deformed faces dating back to the first century CE. Some 15th- and 16th-century texts from the Inca period and from Spanish colonials mention &quot;valley sickness&quot;, &quot;Andean sickness&quot;, or &quot;white leprosy&quot;, which are likely to be the cutaneous form.

It remains unclear who first discovered the organism. David Douglas Cunningham, Surgeon Major of the British Indian army, may have seen it in 1885 without being able to relate it to the disease. Peter Borovsky, a Russian military surgeon working in Tashkent, conducted research into the etiology of &quot;oriental sore&quot;, locally known as &quot;sart&quot; sore, and in 1898 published the first accurate description of the causative agent, correctly described the parasite&#x27;s relation to host tissues and correctly referred it to the protozoa. However, because his results were published in Russian in a journal with low circulation, his results were not internationally acknowledged during his lifetime. In 1901, William Boog Leishman identified certain organisms in smears taken from the spleen of a patient who had died from &quot;dum-dum fever&quot; (Dum Dum is an area close to Calcutta) and proposed them to be trypanosomes, found for the first time in India. A few months later, Captain Charles Donovan (1863–1951) confirmed the finding of what became known as Leishman-Donovan bodies in smears taken from people in Madras in southern India. But it was Ronald Ross who proposed that Leishman-Donovan bodies were the intracellular stages of a new parasite, which he named &quot;Leishmania donovani&quot;. The link with the disease &quot;kala-azar&quot; was first suggested by Charles Donovan, and was conclusively demonstrated by Charles Bentley&#x27;s discovery of &quot;L. donovani&quot; in patients with &quot;kala-azar&quot;. Transmission by the sandfly was hypothesized by Lionel Napier and Ernest Struthers at the School of Tropical Medicine at Calcutta and later proven by his colleagues. The disease became a major problem for Allied troops fighting in Sicily during the Second World War; research by Leonard Goodwin then showed pentostam was an effective treatment.

==Society and culture==
The Institute for OneWorld Health has reintroduced the drug paromomycin for the treatment of leishmaniasis, results which led to its approval as an orphan drug. The Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative is also actively facilitating the search for novel therapeutics. A treatment with paromomycin will cost about US$10. The drug had originally been identified in the 1950s but had been abandoned because it would not be profitable, as the disease mostly affects poor people. The Indian government approved paromomycin for sale in August 2006.

By 2012 the World Health Organization had successfully negotiated with the manufacturers to achieve a reduced cost for liposomal amphotericin B, to US$18 a vial, but several vials are needed for treatment and it must be kept at a stable, cool temperature.

==Research==

As of 2017, no leishmaniasis vaccine for humans was available. Research to produce a human vaccine is ongoing.

Currently some effective leishmaniasis vaccines for dogs exist. There is also the consideration that public health practices can control or eliminate leishmaniasis without a vaccine. Pyrimidine–based drugs are being explored as anti-leishmanial compounds.

<text>The buntings are a group of Old World passerine birds forming the genus Emberiza, the only genus in the family Emberizidae. The family contains 44 species. They are seed-eating birds with stubby, conical bills.

==Taxonomy==
The family Emberizidae was formerly much larger and included the species now placed in the Passerellidae (New World sparrows) and Calcariidae (longspurs and snow buntings). Molecular phylogenetic studies found that the large family consisted of distinct clades that were better treated as separate families.

The genus &quot;Emberiza&quot; is now the only genus placed in the family Emberizidae. The genus was introduced by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. The type species was subsequently designated as the yellowhammer (&quot;Emberiza citrinella&quot;). The genus name &quot;Emberiza&quot; is from Old German &quot;Embritz&quot;, a bunting. The origin of the English &quot;bunting&quot; is unknown.

A 2008 genetic study found that three emberizid species that were placed in their own monotypic genera clustered within the &quot;Emberiza&quot;. These were the crested bunting (&quot;Melophus lathami&quot;), the slaty bunting (&quot;Latouchiornis siemsseni&quot;), and the corn bunting (&quot;Miliaria calandra&quot;). All three species are now included in the genus &quot;Emberiza&quot;.

A large DNA-based study of the passerines published in 2019 found that the buntings are most closely related to the longspurs and snow buntings in the family Calcariidae.

Ornithologists Edward Dickinson and Leslie Christidis in the fourth edition of the &quot;Howard and Moore Complete Checklist of the Birds of the World&quot; chose to split up &quot;Emberiza&quot; and recognise the genera &quot;Fringillaria&quot;, &quot;Melophus&quot;, &quot;Granativora&quot;, &quot;Emberiza&quot;, and &quot;Schoeniclus&quot;. Their example has not been followed by the online version of the &quot;Handbook of the Birds of the World&quot; nor by Frank Gill and David Donsker in the list of world birds that they maintain on behalf of the International Ornithologists&#x27; Union. The British Ornithologists&#x27; Union has argued that splitting the genus provides little benefit and destabilizes the nomenclature.

Species in the New World genus &quot;Passerina&quot; include the word &quot;bunting&quot; in their common names, but are now classed in the family Cardinalidae.

The family is divided into four major clades. The species in Clade I are mainly African while those in Clades II to IV are Palearctic:

The above cladogram is based on a study published in 2021. The phylogenetic relationships of two African species, the brown-rumped bunting (&quot;Emberiza affinis&quot;) and Vincent&#x27;s bunting (&quot;Emberiza vincenti&quot;), were not determined.

==List of species==
The genus contains 44 species.

Extinct species have been described:
* † Long-legged bunting (&quot;Emberiza alcoveri&quot;) (Late Quaternary)
* † &quot;Emberiza shaamarica&quot; (Late Pliocene of Central Asia)
* † &quot;Emberiza polgardiensis&quot; (Upper Miocene of Hungary)
* † &quot;Emberiza media&quot; (Pliocene of Hungary)
* † &quot;Emberiza parva&quot; (Pliocene of Hungary)
* †&quot;Emberiza gaspariskii&quot; (Pliocene of Hungary)
* †&quot;Emberiza bartoki&quot; (Middle Miocene of Hungary) (Nomen dubium) 

&quot;Emberiza pannonica&quot; from the upper Miocene of Hungary is also referred to this genus, but was later found to be a member of Muscicapidae.

<text>The Gambler (; modern spelling ) is a short novel by Fyodor Dostoevsky about a young tutor in the employment of a formerly wealthy Russian general. Set in a hotel and casino in a German city, the theme of gambling reflects Dostoevsky&#x27;s own experience of addiction to roulette. Dostoevsky completed the novel in 1866 under a strict deadline to pay off gambling debts.

== Background ==

Dostoevsky gambled for the first time at the tables at Wiesbaden in 1863. From that time till 1871, when his passion for gambling subsided, he played at Baden-Baden, Homburg, and Saxon-les-Bains frequently, often beginning by winning a small amount of money and losing far more in the end. He first mentions his interest in gambling in a letter he sent to his first wife&#x27;s sister on 1 September 1863 describing his initial success:

Within a week he lost his winnings and was forced to beg his family for money. He wrote to his brother Mikhail on 8 September 1863:

Dostoevsky then agreed to a hazardous contract with F. T. Stellovsky that if he did not deliver a novel of 12 or more signatures by 1 November 1866, Stellovsky would acquire the right to publish Dostoevsky&#x27;s works for nine years, until 1 November 1875, without any compensation to the writer. He noted down parts of his story, then dictated them to one of the first stenographers in Russia, the 19 year old Anna Grigorevna Snitkina, who transcribed them and copied it neatly out for him. With her help, he was able to finish the book in time. Anna later became his wife.

==Plot summary==
The first-person narrative is told from the point of view of Alexei Ivanovich, a tutor working for a Russian family living in a suite at a German hotel. The patriarch of the family, The General, is indebted to the Frenchman de Grieux and has mortgaged his property in Russia to pay only a small amount of his debt. Upon learning of the illness of his wealthy aunt, &quot;Grandmother&quot;, he sends streams of telegrams to Moscow and awaits the news of her demise. His expected inheritance will pay his debts and gain Mademoiselle Blanche de Cominges&#x27;s hand in marriage.

Alexei is hopelessly in love with Polina, the General&#x27;s stepdaughter. She asks him to go to the town&#x27;s casino and place a bet for her. After hesitations, he succumbs and ends up winning at the roulette table. He returns to her with the winnings, but she will not tell him why she is in such need of money. She laughs at him (as she does when he professes his love) and treats him with apparent indifference. Alexei only learns the details of the General&#x27;s and Polina&#x27;s financial state later in the story through his long-time acquaintance, Mr. Astley. Astley is a shy Englishman who seems to share Alexei&#x27;s fondness for Polina. He comes from English nobility and is very wealthy.

One day, while Polina and Alexei are on a walk on the Schlangenberg (a mountain in the German town), he swears an oath of servitude to her. He tells her that all she has to do is give the word and he will gladly walk off the edge and plummet to his death. Polina dares him to insult the aristocratic couple Baron and Baroness Wurmerhelm, whom they have just seen, and he does so. This sets off a chain of events that explains Mademoiselle Blanche&#x27;s interest in the General and gets Alexei fired as tutor of the General&#x27;s children. Shortly after this, Grandmother shows up and surprises the whole party of debtors and indebted. She tells them all that she knows all about the General&#x27;s debt and why the Frenchman and woman are waiting around the suite day after day. She leaves the party of death-profiteers, telling them that none of them are getting any of her money. She asks Alexei to be her guide around the town, famous for its healing waters and infamous for its casino; she wants to gamble.

Grandmother plays at the roulette table and wins a large amount of money. She briefly returns to the hotel, but she has caught the gambling bug and soon returns to the casino. After three days, she has lost over a hundred thousand roubles.

After sending Grandmother off at the railway station, Alexei returns to his room where he is greeted by Polina. She shows him a letter where des Grieux says he has started legal proceedings to sell the General&#x27;s properties mortgaged to him, but he is returning properties worth fifty thousand roubles to the General for Polina&#x27;s benefit. Des Grieux says he feels he has fulfilled all his obligations. Polina tells Alexei that she is des Grieux&#x27;s mistress and she wishes she had fifty thousand roubles to fling in des Grieux&#x27;s face. Upon hearing this, Alexei runs out of the room and to the casino where, over a few hours, he wins two hundred thousand florins (100,000 francs) and becomes a rich man. When he gets back to his room and the waiting Polina, he empties the gold and bank notes from his pockets onto the bed. At first Polina accuses him of trying to buy her like des Grieux, but then she embraces him. They fall asleep on the couch. Next day, she asks for fifty thousand roubles (25,000 francs) and when he gives it to her, she flings the money in his face and runs off to Mr. Astley (Polina and Mr. Astley had been secretly meeting; she was supposed to meet Astley the night before, but had come by mistake to Alexei&#x27;s room). Alexei doesn&#x27;t see her again.

After learning that the General won&#x27;t be getting his inheritance, Mademoiselle Blanche leaves for Paris with her mother and seduces Alexei to follow her. They stay together for almost a month; he allows Mlle Blanche to spend his entire fortune on her own personal expenses, carriages and horses, dinner dances, and a wedding-party. After getting herself financially secured, Mlle Blanche, desiring an established social status, unexpectedly marries the General, who has followed her to Paris.

Alexei starts to gamble to survive. One day he passes Mr. Astley on a park bench in Bad Homburg and has a talk with him. He finds out from Astley that Polina is in Switzerland and actually does love Alexei. Astley tells him that Grandmother has died and left Polina and the children financially secured. The General has died in Paris. Astley gives him some money but shows little hope that he will not use it for gambling. Alexei goes home dreaming of going to Switzerland the next day and recollects what made him win at the roulette tables in the past.

==Adaptations==
The novel was the basis of a 1929 opera by Sergei Prokofiev, &quot;The Gambler&quot;.

Several films have been inspired by the book. &quot;The Great Sinner&quot;, a loose adaptation, starred Gregory Peck and Ava Gardner under the direction of Robert Siodmak in 1949. &quot;Le joueur&quot;, a 1958 French film adaptation by Claude Autant-Lara, starred by Gérard Philipe. A 1972 co-production of the USSR and Czechoslovakia by Lenfilm studio and Barrandov Studios, directed by Alexei Batalov, follows the book closely.

There are two movies based on Dostoevsky&#x27;s life during the time when he was writing the novel. The 1981 Soviet film, &quot;Twenty Six Days from the Life of Dostoyevsky&quot; and the Hungarian director Károly Makk&#x27;s 1997 film &quot;The Gambler&quot;.

A TV mini-series was broadcast on BBC in 1969, and rebroadcast by &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot; in the US.

A radio play version was aired by BBC Radio 4 in December 2010, written by Glyn Maxwell and directed by Guy Retallack.

A two-part modern-day adaptation, written by Dolya Gavanski (who also played &quot;Polina&quot;) and entitled &quot;The Russian Gambler&quot;, was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 as part of its &quot;Classic Serial&quot; series in November 2013 and re-broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Extra in March 2018. The cast also included Ed Stoppard as Alexei.

<text>Heinrich Wilhelm Herbert Wohlfarth (5 June 1915 – 13 August 1982) was a German naval officer and U-boat commander during World War II. He was also a recipient of the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross (). The Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership. He can be seen on Die Deutsche Wochenschau newsreel 574 of 3 September 1941 receiving this decoration from Doenitz. The film on return from the patrol made sometime before his later capture.

==Naval career==
Herbert Wohlfarth began his naval career in April 1933. After the usual training that he spent more than a year on the cruiser . In May 1937, he joined the U-boat force, and like many of the later successful commanders received a solid pre-war training under Karl Dönitz. After some months as aide-de-camp in the 3rd U-boat Flotilla, in September 1938, he became watch officer on .

On 19 October 1939 &quot;Oberleutnant zur See&quot; Wohlfarth took command of . On his first three patrols he sank nine mostly smaller ships in Scottish and Norwegian waters. The fourth patrol with &quot;U-14&quot; was for him, as for most other commanders during Operation Hartmut, supporting the invasion of Norway, without success.

On 15 June 1940 Wohlfarth commissioned , also a Type IID U-boat, referred to as &quot;Einbaum&quot; (dugout canoe). But these small boats were also very successful and other well-known commanders including Hardegen, Kretschmer and Lüth won their first successes in them.

Wohlfarth led &quot;U-137&quot; on three patrols during the autumn of 1940. He sank six ships for a total of , mostly in the area south of the Hebrides. Especially notable was his torpedo hit on the 10,552-ton armed merchant cruiser , damaging the ship so badly that she had to spend six months in the shipyard for repairs.

On 15 December 1940 &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; Wohlfarth left &quot;U-137&quot; and two months later commissioned the Type VIIC boat . On his first patrol in the Atlantic with this new boat he sank six ships for a total of and damaged another of .

On 15 May 1941 he received the Knight&#x27;s Cross while still on patrol. On 26 May, during the return voyage, and ten days before his 26th birthday, Wohlfahrt responded to a call for all &quot;U-boats&quot; in the Bay of Biscay to support the &#x27;s increasingly deteriorating position. The aircraft carrier , battlecruiser and battleship had a lucky escape during the night, unaware they had come within firing range of Wohlfarth&#x27;s &quot;U-556&quot;, which had already fired off all its torpedoes. This was particularly galling for Wohlfahrt, as &quot;U-556&quot; and &quot;Bismarck&quot; had exercised together in the Baltic, and as Wohlfarth had jokingly created a Certificate of Sponsorship, promising to protect the &quot;Bismarck&quot;. &quot;U-556&quot; continued to shadow the British forces, reporting their position and guiding other U-boats to the area. Wohlfarth witnessed the night battles between &quot;Bismarck&quot; and British destroyers.

==Prisoner of war==
On 19 June 1941 Wohlfarth started his second patrol on &quot;U-556&quot;, but just eight days later his boat was sunk in the North Atlantic southwest of Iceland by the British corvettes , and . He and most of his crew were captured; one officer and four men were killed.

Wohlfarth then spent more than six years in English and Canadian prisoner of war camps. His war record stood at 21 ships sunk, totalling , and three more damaged, totalling . He returned to Germany on 14 July 1947.

Wohlfarth died on 13 August 1982 in Villingen, Germany, at the age of 67 years.

<text>The Scott Paper Company was a manufacturer and marketer of sanitary tissue products with operations in 22 countries. Its products were sold under a variety of well-known brand names, including &quot;Scott Tissue&quot;, &quot;Cottonelle&quot;, &quot;Baby Fresh&quot;, &quot;Scottex&quot; and &quot;Viva&quot;. Consolidated sales of its consumer and commercial products totalled approximately $3.6 billion in 1994.

The company was acquired by the Kimberly-Clark Corporation in 1995.

==History==
Scott Paper was founded in 1879 in Philadelphia by brothers E. Irvin Scott and Clarence Scott, and is often credited as being the first to market toilet paper sold on a roll. They began marketing paper towels in 1907, and paper tissues in the 1930s.

In 1927, Scott purchased a Nova Scotian pulp mill, and thus began a long series of acquisitions. It joined with The Mead Corporation in 1936 to form Brunswick Pulp &amp; Paper Company, which used their pulp mill in Georgia to supply both Mead and Scott. The company then bought mills in New York and Wisconsin, and during the 1950s Scott merged with Soundview Pulp Company and Hollingsworth &amp; Whitney Company, which provided timberlands and mills in Washington, Alabama, and Maine.

Scott enjoyed success throughout the 20th century due to their advertising methods, which can be traced back to Arthur Scott, the son of E. Irvin Scott. Scott&#x27;s hard-sell magazine advertisements of the 1930s focused on warnings that using harsh toilet paper would lead to painful rectal trouble. Another famous example of 1936 asked &quot;Is your washroom breeding Bolsheviks?&quot;, suggesting that cheap toilet paper might turn employees to Communism.

In December 1994, Scott sold its printing and publishing papers business, consisting of its wholly owned subsidiary, S.D. Warren, for approximately $1.6 billion.

==Merger with Kimberly-Clark==
In 1995, Scott Paper merged with Kimberly-Clark, The new company used the name Kimberly-Clark and maintained the Scott Paper product names. Scott Paper Limited, its subsidiary in Canada, was sold and became Kruger Inc. As part of the sale of the company, the &quot;Baby Fresh&quot; baby wipes brand was sold to Procter &amp; Gamble and is now sold under the Pampers brand.
The &quot;Scotties&quot; facial tissue brand in the United States was sold to Irving Tissue. Other divested brands include &quot;Cut-Rite&quot;, a brand of waxed paper, which was sold to Reynolds Metals in 1986.

==Headquarters==

The headquarters of the company for many years was located at International Plaza (known then as Scott Plaza) in Tinicum Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania, in Greater Philadelphia. The complex at that time consisted of three buildings known as Plaza I, Plaza II, and Plaza III. Plaza I was completed in 1961. Plaza II was completed after 1961. Plaza III was completed in 1969. The complex was constructed for the purpose of serving as Scott&#x27;s headquarters.

<doc id="198506" wikidata="Q1304541" url="?curid=198506" title="The General (Forester novel)">
<text>The General is a 1936 novel authored by writer C. S. Forester. Known for his Horatio Hornblower novels and 1935&#x27;s &quot;The African Queen&quot;, Forester attempted in the work to portray the then recently finished conflict of World War I in a decidedly realistic though still narrative-based and compelling fashion. The book centres on the titular general and portrays, among other things, the British Army&#x27;s efforts to deal with trench warfare.

&quot;The General&quot; follows the career of a professional soldier, Herbert Curzon, from his service as a junior officer in the Second Boer War through his experiences as a senior commander in the First World War. While personally courageous and dedicated, Curzon is otherwise unexceptional: he serves as an officer like many others. The stalemate of the conflict irritates him as he receives greater and greater promotion and finds himself ordering great numbers of regular soldiers to their deaths. Though surviving when many do not and displaying an honorable sense of individual character, Curzon finally determines his willingness to sacrifice his life during the fateful offensive of the Central Powers enacted in 1918. While without truly great fault, it is Curzon&#x27;s lack of true psychological foresight and unimaginative nature that appears to define him given the inanity of the war.

Reviewers have lauded the work over multiple decades. Commentators have particular cited the ordinariness of Forester&#x27;s character, which as a story element serves to give the novel power. Examples of more recent praise includes the writings of historian Max Hastings.

==Plot==
===Overall story framework===
At the beginning of the Great War, upon mobilisation in August 1914, Curzon holds the rank of senior major in the not particularly fashionable 22nd Lancers. During the Boer War he won some distinction in an old-style cavalry charge but his character-forming career since has been a matter of rigid and unimaginative peacetime routine.

Curzon is given a temporary promotion to battalion command. At the Battle of Ypres, he manages to keep his head about him and following the death of his brigadier assumes command of the brigade. He returns to England while his unit is in Belgium and is rapidly promoted though chance and political intrigue. He makes an advantageous marriage to Lady Emily, the daughter of the Duke of Bude, which gives him a useful political connection to the opposition &quot;Bude House&quot; set.

Curzon is appointed in command of the 10,000-man (fictional) 91st Infantry Division, ordering attacks that condemn many of them to mutilation and death amongst the shells, gas and the machine guns. At the end, the 91st Division, which he has brought to a high degree of efficiency, is forced to retreat in the March 1918 German offensive. Faithful to his own traditional values, Curzon decides to &quot;go up the line&quot; among his troops on his horse with a sword rather than face defeat and professional failure. The novel implies that he seeks death in battle; he says &quot;We can still go down fighting&quot;. He is injured by a shell fragment, endures months of drugged agony and loses a leg. His war is over.

===Psyche of the main character===

Curzon – General Sir Herbert Curzon by this time – is not a brutal man or an uncaring one: simply a brave and honest but stubborn and unimaginative leader. For Forester, the tale of Herbert Curzon&#x27;s almost inevitable rise to high command, the senseless slaughters he directs and his eventual retirement to the life of an aged cripple in a wheelchair, is not about Curzon – it is about the attitudes and mores of the British Army and of British ruling society more generally: the limited and inflexible mindsets that (in Forester&#x27;s view) contributed to the appalling casualties and the horrors of the First World War.

He distrusts theorists, and is not part of the &quot;blood-brotherhood of Camberley&quot; (the staff college) Like his seniors he believes in &quot;Attrition&quot; and the &quot;Big Push&quot; with brute force; more men, more guns. Hence he is startled by the tank victory at Cambrai.

===War Office scene===

The novel has an episode in the War Office with a field-marshal, a general and a major-general agreeing to promote Curzon, which is not due to any scheming but because though there were a hundred possible officers &quot;an adventitious circumstance had singled him out for particular notice&quot;. Major-General Mackenzie laments, &quot;where am I to get three hundred good brigadiers from?&quot;. The field-marshal (who is constructing a &quot;modern army&quot; out of the remains of the Expeditionary Force that Curzon was in) has Curzon promoted to major-general so he outranks Webb, as Curzon is junior to Webb as brigadier-general. But later Curzon has to &quot;unstick&quot; (send home) Webb when he wants to &quot;adjust&quot; (withdraw) his line. Eventually Curzon has command of four divisions or a hundred thousand men: &quot;as many as Wellington or Marlborough ever commanded.&quot;

At the outbreak of war, &quot;someone in London had done his work extraordinarily well to &quot;put an Army” (the British Expeditionary Force) ashore lacking absolutely nothing. Curzon is promoted to (temporary) lieutenant-colonel as a &quot;vigorous younger man&quot; to replace his predecessor, who is near retirement and is given an (unwelcome) promotion to train a brigade of yeomanry. But with the Ninety-first division, one of the new armies, &quot;the War Office was found wanting … they were left unclothed, unhoused and unarmed (and) shivered in tents pitched in seas of mud&quot; So Curzon got Mackenzie to wangle allocations of duckboards etc to make life bearable by saying he was dining with influential people (he was dining with Emily).

Mackenzie is the Director-General of Tactical Services, and when the Liberal Government admitted some of the Opposition to government: &quot;while men in high position fell right and left, General Mackenzie remained Director-General of Tactical Services. Others greater than he – among them the greatest Minister of War that England ever had – were flung out of office, but Mackenzie remained despite his very unsound attitude in the Ulster crisis. Perhaps that is the most important contribution Curzon ever made to the history of England&quot; Curzon, one of whose traits is personal loyalty, has urged his father-in-law the Duke to keep Mackenzie.

The field marshal and Minister of War was Sirdar of the Egyptian Army when he was forty-one (Curzon&#x27;s age), so is similar to Kitchener. But in the novel he is forced from office, not drowned at sea. He is replaced by another cavalry-man, Scottish instead of Irish, named as Haig.

==Reception and effect of the novel==

&quot;The General&quot; has been widely praised as being an excellent and very realistic account of the mindset of the British Officer Corps in times of war and as such many veterans are surprised to learn that the author himself never actually served in the armed forces. In fact, a persistent yet unsubstantiated rumor states that Adolf Hitler was so impressed with the novel that he made it required reading for his top field commanders and general staff, in the hopes that it would allow prominent German officers to be able to understand how their British counterparts thought. This rumor is referred to as fact by Forester in a foreword to a later edition of the novel.

Historian Max Hastings, in his book &quot;Catastrophe 1914: Europe Goes to War&quot;, calls &quot;The General&quot; &quot;brilliantly contemptuous&quot;, and writes that &quot;[Forester] likened the commanders of World War I to savages, striving to extract a screw from a piece of timber by main force, assisted by ever more fulcrums and levers&quot; failing to grasp that simply &quot;twisting&quot; the screw would remove it &quot;with a fraction of the effort.&quot; Hastings remarks: This view of wartime generalship, which was essentially also that of Churchill and Lloyd George, has commanded widespread favour ever since. But what if, as most scholars of the conflict today believe, it was impossible to &#x27;turn the screw&#x27;, to identify any credible means for breaking the stalemate?

<text>A scientific theory is an explanation of an aspect of the natural world that can be or that has been repeatedly tested and has corroborating evidence in accordance with the scientific method, using accepted protocols of observation, measurement, and evaluation of results. Where possible, theories are tested under controlled conditions in an experiment. In circumstances not amenable to experimental testing, theories are evaluated through principles of abductive reasoning. Established scientific theories have withstood rigorous scrutiny and embody scientific knowledge.

A scientific theory differs from a scientific fact or scientific law in that a theory seeks to explain &quot;how&quot; or &quot;why&quot;, whereas a fact is a simple, basic observation and a law is an empirical description of a relationship between facts and/or other laws. For example, Newton&#x27;s Law of Gravity is a mathematical equation that can be used to predict the attraction between bodies, but it is not a theory to explain &quot;how&quot; gravity works. Stephen Jay Gould wrote that &quot;...facts and theories are different things, not rungs in a hierarchy of increasing certainty. Facts are the world&#x27;s data. Theories are structures of ideas that explain and interpret facts.&quot;

The meaning of the term &quot;scientific theory&quot; (often contracted to &quot;theory&quot; for brevity) as used in the disciplines of science is significantly different from the common vernacular usage of &quot;theory&quot;. In everyday speech, &quot;theory&quot; can imply an explanation that represents an unsubstantiated and speculative guess, whereas in a scientific context it most often refers to an explanation that has already been tested and is widely accepted as valid.

The strength of a scientific theory is related to the diversity of phenomena it can explain and its simplicity. As additional scientific evidence is gathered, a scientific theory may be modified and ultimately rejected if it cannot be made to fit the new findings; in such circumstances, a more accurate theory is then required. Some theories are so well-established that they are unlikely ever to be fundamentally changed (for example, scientific theories such as evolution, heliocentric theory, cell theory, theory of plate tectonics, germ theory of disease, etc.). In certain cases, a scientific theory or scientific law that fails to fit all data can still be useful (due to its simplicity) as an approximation under specific conditions. An example is Newton&#x27;s laws of motion, which are a highly accurate approximation to special relativity at velocities that are small relative to the speed of light.

Scientific theories are testable and make verifiable predictions. They describe the causes of a particular natural phenomenon and are used to explain and predict aspects of the physical universe or specific areas of inquiry (for example, electricity, chemistry, and astronomy). As with other forms of scientific knowledge, scientific theories are both deductive and inductive, aiming for predictive and explanatory power. Scientists use theories to further scientific knowledge, as well as to facilitate advances in technology or medicine. Scientific hypotheses can never be &quot;proven&quot; because scientists are not able to fully confirm that their hypothesis is true. Instead, scientists say that the study &quot;supports&quot; or is consistent with their hypothesis. 

==Types==
Albert Einstein described two different types of scientific theories: &quot;Constructive theories&quot; and &quot;principle theories&quot;. Constructive theories are constructive models for phenomena: for example, kinetic theory. Principle theories are empirical generalisations, one such example being Newton&#x27;s laws of motion.

==Characteristics==

===Essential criteria===

For any theory to be accepted within most academia there is usually one simple criterion. The essential criterion is that the theory must be observable and repeatable. The aforementioned criterion is essential to prevent fraud and perpetuate science itself. 

The defining characteristic of all scientific knowledge, including theories, is the ability to make falsifiable or testable predictions. The relevance and specificity of those predictions determine how potentially useful the theory is. A would-be theory that makes no observable predictions is not a scientific theory at all. Predictions not sufficiently specific to be tested are similarly not useful. In both cases, the term &quot;theory&quot; is not applicable.

A body of descriptions of knowledge can be called a theory if it fulfills the following criteria:
* It makes falsifiable predictions with consistent accuracy across a broad area of scientific inquiry (such as mechanics).
* It is well-supported by many independent strands of evidence, rather than a single foundation.
* It is consistent with preexisting experimental results and at least as accurate in its predictions as are any preexisting theories.

These qualities are certainly true of such established theories as special and general relativity, quantum mechanics, plate tectonics, the modern evolutionary synthesis, etc.

===Other criteria===

In addition, most scientists prefer to work with a theory that meets the following qualities:
* It can be subjected to minor adaptations to account for new data that do not fit it perfectly, as they are discovered, thus increasing its predictive capability over time.
* It is among the most parsimonious explanations, economical in the use of proposed entities or explanatory steps as per Occam&#x27;s razor. This is because for each accepted explanation of a phenomenon, there may be an extremely large, perhaps even incomprehensible, number of possible and more complex alternatives, because one can always burden failing explanations with &quot;ad hoc&quot; hypotheses to prevent them from being falsified; therefore, simpler theories are preferable to more complex ones because they are more testable.

===Definitions from scientific organizations===
The United States National Academy of Sciences defines scientific theories as follows:

The formal scientific definition of theory is quite different from the everyday meaning of the word. It refers to a comprehensive explanation of some aspect of nature that is supported by a vast body of evidence. Many scientific theories are so well established that no new evidence is likely to alter them substantially. For example, no new evidence will demonstrate that the Earth does not orbit around the Sun (heliocentric theory), or that living things are not made of cells (cell theory), that matter is not composed of atoms, or that the surface of the Earth is not divided into solid plates that have moved over geological timescales (the theory of plate tectonics)...One of the most useful properties of scientific theories is that they can be used to make predictions about natural events or phenomena that have not yet been observed.

From the American Association for the Advancement of Science:

A scientific theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been repeatedly confirmed through observation and experiment. Such fact-supported theories are not &quot;guesses&quot; but reliable accounts of the real world. The theory of biological evolution is more than &quot;just a theory&quot;. It is as factual an explanation of the universe as the atomic theory of matter or the germ theory of disease. Our understanding of gravity is still a work in progress. But the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is an accepted fact.

Note that the term &quot;theory&quot; would not be appropriate for describing untested but intricate hypotheses or even scientific models.

==Formation==

The scientific method involves the proposal and testing of hypotheses, by deriving predictions from the hypotheses about the results of future experiments, then performing those experiments to see whether the predictions are valid. This provides evidence either for or against the hypothesis. When enough experimental results have been gathered in a particular area of inquiry, scientists may propose an explanatory framework that accounts for as many of these as possible. This explanation is also tested, and if it fulfills the necessary criteria (see above), then the explanation becomes a theory. This can take many years, as it can be difficult or complicated to gather sufficient evidence.
Once all of the criteria have been met, it will be widely accepted by scientists (see scientific consensus) as the best available explanation of at least some phenomena. It will have made predictions of phenomena that previous theories could not explain or could not predict accurately, and it will have many repeated bouts of testing. The strength of the evidence is evaluated by the scientific community, and the most important experiments will have been replicated by multiple independent groups.

Theories do not have to be perfectly accurate to be scientifically useful. For example, the predictions made by classical mechanics are known to be inaccurate in the relativistic realm, but they are almost exactly correct at the comparatively low velocities of common human experience. In chemistry, there are many acid-base theories providing highly divergent explanations of the underlying nature of acidic and basic compounds, but they are very useful for predicting their chemical behavior. Like all knowledge in science, no theory can ever be completely certain, since it is possible that future experiments might conflict with the theory&#x27;s predictions. However, theories supported by the scientific consensus have the highest level of certainty of any scientific knowledge; for example, that all objects are subject to gravity or that life on Earth evolved from a common ancestor.

Acceptance of a theory does not require that all of its major predictions be tested, if it is already supported by sufficient evidence. For example, certain tests may be unfeasible or technically difficult. As a result, theories may make predictions that have not yet been confirmed or proven incorrect; in this case, the predicted results may be described informally with the term &quot;theoretical&quot;. These predictions can be tested at a later time, and if they are incorrect, this may lead to the revision or rejection of the theory. As Richard Feynman puts it:It doesn&#x27;t matter how beautiful your theory is, it doesn&#x27;t matter how smart you are. If it doesn&#x27;t agree with experiment, it&#x27;s wrong.

==Modification and improvement==
If experimental results contrary to a theory&#x27;s predictions are observed, scientists first evaluate whether the experimental design was sound, and if so they confirm the results by independent replication. A search for potential improvements to the theory then begins. Solutions may require minor or major changes to the theory, or none at all if a satisfactory explanation is found within the theory&#x27;s existing framework. Over time, as successive modifications build on top of each other, theories consistently improve and greater predictive accuracy is achieved. Since each new version of a theory (or a completely new theory) must have more predictive and explanatory power than the last, scientific knowledge consistently becomes more accurate over time.

If modifications to the theory or other explanations seem to be insufficient to account for the new results, then a new theory may be required. Since scientific knowledge is usually durable, this occurs much less commonly than modification. Furthermore, until such a theory is proposed and accepted, the previous theory will be retained. This is because it is still the best available explanation for many other phenomena, as verified by its predictive power in other contexts. For example, it has been known since 1859 that the observed perihelion precession of Mercury violates Newtonian mechanics, but the theory remained the best explanation available until relativity was supported by sufficient evidence. Also, while new theories may be proposed by a single person or by many, the cycle of modifications eventually incorporates contributions from many different scientists.

After the changes, the accepted theory will explain more phenomena and have greater predictive power (if it did not, the changes would not be adopted); this new explanation will then be open to further replacement or modification. If a theory does not require modification despite repeated tests, this implies that the theory is very accurate. This also means that accepted theories continue to accumulate evidence over time, and the length of time that a theory (or any of its principles) remains accepted often indicates the strength of its supporting evidence.

===Unification===
In some cases, two or more theories may be replaced by a single theory that explains the previous theories as approximations or special cases, analogous to the way a theory is a unifying explanation for many confirmed hypotheses; this is referred to as &quot;unification&quot; of theories. For example, electricity and magnetism are now known to be two aspects of the same phenomenon, referred to as electromagnetism.

When the predictions of different theories appear to contradict each other, this is also resolved by either further evidence or unification. For example, physical theories in the 19th century implied that the Sun could not have been burning long enough to allow certain geological changes as well as the evolution of life. This was resolved by the discovery of nuclear fusion, the main energy source of the Sun. Contradictions can also be explained as the result of theories approximating more fundamental (non-contradictory) phenomena. For example, atomic theory is an approximation of quantum mechanics. Current theories describe three separate fundamental phenomena of which all other theories are approximations; the potential unification of these is sometimes called the Theory of Everything.

===Example: Relativity===

In 1905, Albert Einstein published the principle of special relativity, which soon became a theory. Special relativity predicted the alignment of the Newtonian principle of Galilean invariance, also termed &quot;Galilean relativity&quot;, with the electromagnetic field. By omitting from special relativity the luminiferous aether, Einstein stated that time dilation and length contraction measured in an object in relative motion is inertial—that is, the object exhibits constant velocity, which is speed with direction, when measured by its observer. He thereby duplicated the Lorentz transformation and the Lorentz contraction that had been hypothesized to resolve experimental riddles and inserted into electrodynamic theory as dynamical consequences of the aether&#x27;s properties. An elegant theory, special relativity yielded its own consequences, such as the equivalence of mass and energy transforming into one another and the resolution of the paradox that an excitation of the electromagnetic field could be viewed in one reference frame as electricity, but in another as magnetism.

Einstein sought to generalize the invariance principle to all reference frames, whether inertial or accelerating. Rejecting Newtonian gravitation—a central force acting instantly at a distance—Einstein presumed a gravitational field. In 1907, Einstein&#x27;s equivalence principle implied that a free fall within a uniform gravitational field is equivalent to inertial motion. By extending special relativity&#x27;s effects into three dimensions, general relativity extended length contraction into space contraction, conceiving of 4D space-time as the gravitational field that alters geometrically and sets all local objects&#x27; pathways. Even massless energy exerts gravitational motion on local objects by &quot;curving&quot; the geometrical &quot;surface&quot; of 4D space-time. Yet unless the energy is vast, its relativistic effects of contracting space and slowing time are negligible when merely predicting motion. Although general relativity is embraced as the more explanatory theory via &quot;scientific realism&quot;, Newton&#x27;s theory remains successful as merely a predictive theory via &quot;instrumentalism&quot;. To calculate trajectories, engineers and NASA still uses Newton&#x27;s equations, which are simpler to operate.

==Theories and laws==

Both scientific laws and scientific theories are produced from the scientific method through the formation and testing of hypotheses, and can predict the behavior of the natural world. Both are also typically well-supported by observations and/or experimental evidence. However, scientific laws are descriptive accounts of how nature will behave under certain conditions. Scientific theories are broader in scope, and give overarching explanations of how nature works and why it exhibits certain characteristics. Theories are supported by evidence from many different sources, and may contain one or several laws.

A common misconception is that scientific theories are rudimentary ideas that will eventually graduate into scientific laws when enough data and evidence have been accumulated. A theory does not change into a scientific law with the accumulation of new or better evidence. A theory will always remain a theory; a law will always remain a law. Both theories and laws could potentially be falsified by countervailing evidence.

=== Theories and facts ===
A scientific theory does not turn into a fact. Scientific facts are observations that theories organize and explain. As new facts appear, a theory may be revised or new theories may emerge that encompass these additional facts. While American vernacular speech uses &quot;theory&quot; as similar to a &quot;guess&quot; in opposition to a &quot;fact&quot;, in science the word &quot;theory&quot; means a model that is expected to explain a wide range of facts.

==About theories==

===Theories as axioms===
The logical positivists thought of scientific theories as statements in a formal language. First-order logic is an example of a formal language. The logical positivists envisaged a similar scientific language. In addition to scientific theories, the language also included observation sentences (&quot;the sun rises in the east&quot;), definitions, and mathematical statements. The phenomena explained by the theories, if they could not be directly observed by the senses (for example, atoms and radio waves), were treated as theoretical concepts. In this view, theories function as axioms: predicted observations are derived from the theories much like theorems are derived in Euclidean geometry. However, the predictions are then tested against reality to verify the predictions, and the &quot;axioms&quot; can be revised as a direct result.

The phrase &quot;the received view of theories&quot; is used to describe this approach. Terms commonly associated with it are &quot;linguistic&quot; (because theories are components of a language) and &quot;syntactic&quot; (because a language has rules about how symbols can be strung together). Problems in defining this kind of language precisely, e.g., are objects seen in microscopes observed or are they theoretical objects, led to the effective demise of logical positivism in the 1970s.

===Theories as models===
The semantic view of theories, which identifies scientific theories with models rather than propositions, has replaced the received view as the dominant position in theory formulation in the philosophy of science. A model is a logical framework intended to represent reality (a &quot;model of reality&quot;), similar to the way that a map is a graphical model that represents the territory of a city or country.

In this approach, theories are a specific category of models that fulfill the necessary criteria (see above). One can use language to describe a model; however, the theory is the model (or a collection of similar models), and not the description of the model. A model of the solar system, for example, might consist of abstract objects that represent the sun and the planets. These objects have associated properties, e.g., positions, velocities, and masses. The model parameters, e.g., Newton&#x27;s Law of Gravitation, determine how the positions and velocities change with time. This model can then be tested to see whether it accurately predicts future observations; astronomers can verify that the positions of the model&#x27;s objects over time match the actual positions of the planets. For most planets, the Newtonian model&#x27;s predictions are accurate; for Mercury, it is slightly inaccurate and the model of general relativity must be used instead.

The word &quot;semantic&quot; refers to the way that a model represents the real world. The representation (literally, &quot;re-presentation&quot;) describes particular aspects of a phenomenon or the manner of interaction among a set of phenomena. For instance, a scale model of a house or of a solar system is clearly not an actual house or an actual solar system; the aspects of an actual house or an actual solar system represented in a scale model are, only in certain limited ways, representative of the actual entity. A scale model of a house is not a house; but to someone who wants to &quot;learn about&quot; houses, analogous to a scientist who wants to understand reality, a sufficiently detailed scale model may suffice.

====Differences between theory and model====

Several commentators have stated that the distinguishing characteristic of theories is that they are explanatory as well as descriptive, while models are only descriptive (although still predictive in a more limited sense). Philosopher Stephen Pepper also distinguished between theories and models, and said in 1948 that general models and theories are predicated on a &quot;root&quot; metaphor that constrains how scientists theorize and model a phenomenon and thus arrive at testable hypotheses.

Engineering practice makes a distinction between &quot;mathematical models&quot; and &quot;physical models&quot;; the cost of fabricating a physical model can be minimized by first creating a mathematical model using a computer software package, such as a computer aided design tool. The component parts are each themselves modelled, and the fabrication tolerances are specified. An exploded view drawing is used to lay out the fabrication sequence. Simulation packages for displaying each of the subassemblies allow the parts to be rotated, magnified, in realistic detail. Software packages for creating the bill of materials for construction allows subcontractors to specialize in assembly processes, which spreads the cost of manufacturing machinery among multiple customers.

===Assumptions in formulating theories===
An assumption (or axiom) is a statement that is accepted without evidence. For example, assumptions can be used as premises in a logical argument. Isaac Asimov described assumptions as follows:

...it is incorrect to speak of an assumption as either true or false, since there is no way of proving it to be either (If there were, it would no longer be an assumption). It is better to consider assumptions as either useful or useless, depending on whether deductions made from them corresponded to reality...Since we must start somewhere, we must have assumptions, but at least let us have as few assumptions as possible.

Certain assumptions are necessary for all empirical claims (e.g. the assumption that reality exists). However, theories do not generally make assumptions in the conventional sense (statements accepted without evidence). While assumptions are often incorporated during the formation of new theories, these are either supported by evidence (such as from previously existing theories) or the evidence is produced in the course of validating the theory. This may be as simple as observing that the theory makes accurate predictions, which is evidence that any assumptions made at the outset are correct or approximately correct under the conditions tested.

Conventional assumptions, without evidence, may be used if the theory is only intended to apply when the assumption is valid (or approximately valid). For example, the special theory of relativity assumes an inertial frame of reference. The theory makes accurate predictions when the assumption is valid, and does not make accurate predictions when the assumption is not valid. Such assumptions are often the point with which older theories are succeeded by new ones (the general theory of relativity works in non-inertial reference frames as well).

The term &quot;assumption&quot; is actually broader than its standard use, etymologically speaking. The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) and online Wiktionary indicate its Latin source as &quot;assumere&quot; (&quot;accept, to take to oneself, adopt, usurp&quot;), which is a conjunction of &quot;ad-&quot; (&quot;to, towards, at&quot;) and &quot;sumere&quot; (to take). The root survives, with shifted meanings, in the Italian &quot;assumere&quot; and Spanish &quot;sumir&quot;. The first sense of &quot;assume&quot; in the OED is &quot;to take unto (oneself), receive, accept, adopt&quot;. The term was originally employed in religious contexts as in &quot;to receive up into heaven&quot;, especially &quot;the reception of the Virgin Mary into heaven, with body preserved from corruption&quot;, (1297 CE) but it was also simply used to refer to &quot;receive into association&quot; or &quot;adopt into partnership&quot;. Moreover, other senses of assumere included (i) &quot;investing oneself with (an attribute)&quot;, (ii) &quot;to undertake&quot; (especially in Law), (iii) &quot;to take to oneself in appearance only, to pretend to possess&quot;, and (iv) &quot;to suppose a thing to be&quot; (all senses from OED entry on &quot;assume&quot;; the OED entry for &quot;assumption&quot; is almost perfectly symmetrical in senses). Thus, &quot;assumption&quot; connotes other associations than the contemporary standard sense of &quot;that which is assumed or taken for granted; a supposition, postulate&quot; (only the 11th of 12 senses of &quot;assumption&quot;, and the 10th of 11 senses of &quot;assume&quot;).

==Descriptions==

===From philosophers of science===
Karl Popper described the characteristics of a scientific theory as follows:
# It is easy to obtain confirmations, or verifications, for nearly every theory—if we look for confirmations.
# Confirmations should count only if they are the result of risky predictions; that is to say, if, unenlightened by the theory in question, we should have expected an event which was incompatible with the theory—an event which would have refuted the theory.
# Every &quot;good&quot; scientific theory is a prohibition: it forbids certain things to happen. The more a theory forbids, the better it is.
# A theory which is not refutable by any conceivable event is non-scientific. Irrefutability is not a virtue of a theory (as people often think) but a vice.
# Every genuine test of a theory is an attempt to falsify it, or to refute it. Testability is falsifiability; but there are degrees of testability: some theories are more testable, more exposed to refutation, than others; they take, as it were, greater risks.
# Confirming evidence should not count except when it is the result of a genuine test of the theory; and this means that it can be presented as a serious but unsuccessful attempt to falsify the theory. (I now speak in such cases of &quot;corroborating evidence&quot;.)
# Some genuinely testable theories, when found to be false, might still be upheld by their admirers—for example by introducing post hoc (after the fact) some auxiliary hypothesis or assumption, or by reinterpreting the theory post hoc in such a way that it escapes refutation. Such a procedure is always possible, but it rescues the theory from refutation only at the price of destroying, or at least lowering, its scientific status, by tampering with evidence. The temptation to tamper can be minimized by first taking the time to write down the testing protocol before embarking on the scientific work.

Popper summarized these statements by saying that the central criterion of the scientific status of a theory is its &quot;falsifiability, or refutability, or testability&quot;. Echoing this, Stephen Hawking states, &quot;A theory is a good theory if it satisfies two requirements: It must accurately describe a large class of observations on the basis of a model that contains only a few arbitrary elements, and it must make definite predictions about the results of future observations.&quot; He also discusses the &quot;unprovable but falsifiable&quot; nature of theories, which is a necessary consequence of inductive logic, and that &quot;you can disprove a theory by finding even a single observation that disagrees with the predictions of the theory&quot;.

Several philosophers and historians of science have, however, argued that Popper&#x27;s definition of theory as a set of falsifiable statements is wrong because, as Philip Kitcher has pointed out, if one took a strictly Popperian view of &quot;theory&quot;, observations of Uranus when first discovered in 1781 would have &quot;falsified&quot; Newton&#x27;s celestial mechanics. Rather, people suggested that another planet influenced Uranus&#x27; orbit—and this prediction was indeed eventually confirmed.

Kitcher agrees with Popper that &quot;There is surely something right in the idea that a science can succeed only if it can fail.&quot; He also says that scientific theories include statements that cannot be falsified, and that good theories must also be creative. He insists we view scientific theories as an &quot;elaborate collection of statements&quot;, some of which are not falsifiable, while others—those he calls &quot;auxiliary hypotheses&quot;, are.

According to Kitcher, good scientific theories must have three features:
# Unity: &quot;A science should be unified... Good theories consist of just one problem-solving strategy, or a small family of problem-solving strategies, that can be applied to a wide range of problems.&quot;
# Fecundity: &quot;A great scientific theory, like Newton&#x27;s, opens up new areas of research... Because a theory presents a new way of looking at the world, it can lead us to ask new questions, and so to embark on new and fruitful lines of inquiry... Typically, a flourishing science is incomplete. At any time, it raises more questions than it can currently answer. But incompleteness is not vice. On the contrary, incompleteness is the mother of fecundity... A good theory should be productive; it should raise new questions and presume those questions can be answered without giving up its problem-solving strategies.&quot;
# Auxiliary hypotheses that are independently testable: &quot;An auxiliary hypothesis ought to be testable independently of the particular problem it is introduced to solve, independently of the theory it is designed to save.&quot; (For example, the evidence for the existence of Neptune is independent of the anomalies in Uranus&#x27;s orbit.)

Like other definitions of theories, including Popper&#x27;s, Kitcher makes it clear that a theory must include statements that have observational consequences. But, like the observation of irregularities in the orbit of Uranus, falsification is only one possible consequence of observation. The production of new hypotheses is another possible and equally important result.

===Analogies and metaphors===
The concept of a scientific theory has also been described using analogies and metaphors. For example, the logical empiricist Carl Gustav Hempel likened the structure of a scientific theory to a &quot;complex spatial network:&quot;

 Its terms are represented by the knots, while the threads connecting the latter correspond, in part, to the definitions and, in part, to the fundamental and derivative hypotheses included in the theory. The whole system floats, as it were, above the plane of observation and is anchored to it by the rules of interpretation. These might be viewed as strings which are not part of the network but link certain points of the latter with specific places in the plane of observation. By virtue of these interpretive connections, the network can function as a scientific theory: From certain observational data, we may ascend, via an interpretive string, to some point in the theoretical network, thence proceed, via definitions and hypotheses, to other points, from which another interpretive string permits a descent to the plane of observation.

Michael Polanyi made an analogy between a theory and a map:

A theory is something other than myself. It may be set out on paper as a system of rules, and it is the more truly a theory the more completely it can be put down in such terms. Mathematical theory reaches the highest perfection in this respect. But even a geographical map fully embodies in itself a set of strict rules for finding one&#x27;s way through a region of otherwise uncharted experience. Indeed, all theory may be regarded as a kind of map extended over space and time.

A scientific theory can also be thought of as a book that captures the fundamental information about the world, a book that must be researched, written, and shared. In 1623, Galileo Galilei wrote:

Philosophy [i.e. physics] is written in this grand book—I mean the universe—which stands continually open to our gaze, but it cannot be understood unless one first learns to comprehend the language and interpret the characters in which it is written. It is written in the language of mathematics, and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometrical figures, without which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it; without these, one is wandering around in a dark labyrinth.

The book metaphor could also be applied in the following passage, by the contemporary philosopher of science Ian Hacking:

I myself prefer an Argentine fantasy. God did not write a Book of Nature of the sort that the old Europeans imagined. He wrote a Borgesian library, each book of which is as brief as possible, yet each book of which is inconsistent with every other. No book is redundant. For every book there is some humanly accessible bit of Nature such that that book, and no other, makes possible the comprehension, prediction and influencing of what is going on...Leibniz said that God chose a world which maximized the variety of phenomena while choosing the simplest laws. Exactly so: but the best way to maximize phenomena and have simplest laws is to have the laws inconsistent with each other, each applying to this or that but none applying to all.

==In physics==
In physics, the term &quot;theory&quot; is generally used for a mathematical framework—derived from a small set of basic postulates (usually symmetries—like equality of locations in space or in time, or identity of electrons, etc.)—that is capable of producing experimental predictions for a given category of physical systems. A good example is classical electromagnetism, which encompasses results derived from gauge symmetry (sometimes called gauge invariance) in a form of a few equations called Maxwell&#x27;s equations. The specific mathematical aspects of classical electromagnetic theory are termed &quot;laws of electromagnetism&quot;, reflecting the level of consistent and reproducible evidence that supports them. Within electromagnetic theory generally, there are numerous hypotheses about how electromagnetism applies to specific situations. Many of these hypotheses are already considered to be adequately tested, with new ones always in the making and perhaps untested. An example of the latter might be the radiation reaction force. As of 2009, its effects on the periodic motion of charges are detectable in synchrotrons, but only as &quot;averaged&quot; effects over time. Some researchers are now considering experiments that could observe these effects at the instantaneous level (i.e. not averaged over time).

==Examples==
Note that many fields of inquiry do not have specific named theories, e.g. developmental biology. Scientific knowledge outside a named theory can still have a high level of certainty, depending on the amount of evidence supporting it. Also note that since theories draw evidence from many fields, the categorization is not absolute.

<text>Oliver Patric Neuville (; born 1 May 1973) is a German former footballer who played as a striker.

During an 18-year professional career which began in Switzerland, he played mainly for German clubs Bayer Leverkusen (five seasons) and Borussia Mönchengladbach (six), amassing Bundesliga totals of 334 games and 91 goals.

Neuville appeared nearly 70 times for the Germany national team during one full decade, representing Germany in two World Cups and at Euro 2008.

==Club career==

Born in Locarno, Switzerland, to a German father from Aachen and Swiss mother of Italian descent, Neuville started his professional career with Servette FC. In only his second season in the Swiss Super League, he scored a career-best 16 goals to help the club win the national championship after a nine-year wait.

In 1996–97, Neuville played in Spain with CD Tenerife, where he was part of a well-balanced attacking line that also featured Juanele (eight goals), Meho Kodro (six), Antonio Pinilla (seven) and Aurelio Vidmar (one), netting five goals in 1,885 minutes as the Canary Islands team easily retained their La Liga status, and also playing a relatively important part in their semi-final run in the UEFA Cup. Subsequently, he moved to Germany and signed for F.C. Hansa Rostock, scoring eight times in only 17 contests in his debut campaign in the Bundesliga, as the side from the former East Germany finished sixth.

Neuville signed for Bayer 04 Leverkusen in the 1999 summer, quickly becoming an essential offensive figure for his new club. He scored 28 goals combined from 2000 to 2002 (including a hat-trick against Hamburger SV on 24 November 2001), while also adding five in 15 UEFA Champions League appearances in 2001–02, as Bayer finished second to Real Madrid (he scored one apiece in both legs of the semifinal clash against Manchester United); the club also finished second in the league during this timeframe.

After Klaus Augenthaler&#x27;s became Leverkusen coach, Neuville&#x27;s playing time was limited and he was not offered a contract extension. In summer 2004, aged 31, Neuville joined Borussia Mönchengladbach on a free transfer. On 17 October 2004 he scored an infamous goal with his hand against 1. FC Kaiserslautern in a 2–0 home win, which was widely reviled and landed him a two-match ban. He netted 22 goals in his first two seasons combined, but appeared scarcely as the &quot;Foals&quot; dropped down a level in 2007, mainly due to injury.

Neuville returned to form in 2007–08, scoring 15 goals to help Borussia return to the top flight the immediate campaign after, the competition&#x27;s sixth-best. He made his last Bundesliga appearance on the final matchday of the 2009–10 season, against former team Bayer Leverkusen.

It was planned that Neuville would start to work as a youth coach for Borussia Mönchengladbach. Instead, he decided to play one more year and signed for Arminia Bielefeld in the 2. Bundesliga. However, after only a couple of months, he left by mutual consent, retiring at the age of 37.

==International career==

After electing to represent Germany at international level, Neuville made his international debut on 2 September 1998 against Malta, in a friendly, replacing Mario Basler for the last fifteen minutes of the 2–1 away win. In his first months training with the national team he needed an interpreter to understand coach Erich Ribbeck&#x27;s message, while getting his across as well.

Subsequently, Neuville went on to collect 69 caps with ten goals. He was picked for the squad that finished second at the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Neuville made his first start of the tournament in the round-of-16 win against Paraguay, and scored his first World Cup goal late on, the only goal of the game. In the final against Brazil, Neuville hit the post with a free kick from 30 yards out with the scores at 0-0, before Germany eventually lost the match 2-0.

After missing selection for UEFA Euro 2004, in the second group stage match of the 2006 World Cup against Poland, Neuville, who had replaced Lukas Podolski, buried a desperate injury-time cross from fellow substitute David Odonkor, beating goalkeeper Artur Boruc on the way to a 1–0 victory. He did not score again for the national team until 31 May 2008, when he slid in a Marcell Jansen cross in a Euro 2008 warm-up against Serbia, appearing in the tournament&#x27;s final stages in the Group B match against Austria as a late substitute, and retiring from international play at the age of 35.

==Personal life==
Along with Bernd Schneider, Neuville was one of the two known smokers in the Germany national team. His name (properly pronounced in French – not German – fashion) stemmed from his Belgian grandfather.

In 1997, Neuville fathered son Lars-Oliver.

<text>The great blue heron (Ardea herodias) is a large wading bird in the heron family Ardeidae, common near the shores of open water and in wetlands over most of North and Central America, as well as far northwestern South America, the Caribbean and the Galápagos Islands. It is occasionally found in the Azores and is a rare vagrant to Europe. An all-white population found in south Florida and the Florida Keys is known as the great white heron. Debate exists about whether these white birds are a color morph of the great blue heron, a subspecies of it, or an entirely separate species.

==Taxonomy==
The great blue heron was one of the many species originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his 18th-century work, &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. The scientific name comes from Latin , and Ancient Greek (), both meaning &quot;heron&quot;.

The great blue heron&#x27;s niche in the Old World is filled by the congeneric grey heron (&quot;Ardea cinerea&quot;), which is somewhat smaller (), and sports a pale gray neck and legs, lacking the brown hues of the great blue heron. The great blue heron forms a superspecies with the grey heron which also includes the cocoi heron of South America, which differs in having more extensive black on the head and a white breast and neck.

The five subspecies are:

==Description==

The great blue heron is the largest heron native to North America. Among all extant herons, it is surpassed in size only by the goliath heron (&quot;Ardea goliath&quot;) and the white-bellied heron (&quot;Ardea insignis&quot;). It exhibits a minor degree of sexual dimorphism; males are slightly larger than females, but otherwise the sexes are not easily outwardly distinguishable. It has head-to-tail length of , a wingspan of , a height of , and a weight of . In British Columbia, adult males averaged and adult females . In Nova Scotia and New England, adult herons of both sexes averaged , while in Oregon, both sexes averaged Thus, great blue herons are roughly twice as heavy as great egrets (&quot;Ardea alba&quot;), although only slightly taller than them, but they weigh only about half as much as a large goliath heron.

Notable features of great blue herons include slaty (gray with a slight azure blue) flight feathers, red-brown thighs, and a paired red-brown and black stripe up the flanks; the neck is rusty-gray, with black and white streaking down the front; the head is paler, with a nearly white face, and a pair of black or slate plumes runs from just above the eye to the back of the head. The feathers on the lower neck are long and plume-like; it also has plumes on the lower back at the start of the breeding season. The bill is dull yellowish, becoming orange briefly at the start of the breeding season, and the lower legs are gray, also becoming orangey at the start of the breeding season. Immature birds are duller in color, with a dull blackish-gray crown, and the flank pattern is only weakly defined; they have no plumes, and the bill is dull gray-yellow. Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the tail is , the culmen is , and the tarsus is . The heron&#x27;s stride is around , almost in a straight line. Two of the three front toes are generally closer together. In a track, the front toes, as well as the back, often show the small talons.

The subspecies differ only slightly in size and plumage tone, with the exception of &quot;A. h. occidentalis&quot;, native to South Florida, which also has a distinct white morph, known as the great white heron (not to be confused with the great egret, for which &quot;great white heron&quot; was once a common name). The great white heron differs from other great blues in bill morphology, head plume length, and in having a total lack of pigment in its plumage. It averages somewhat larger than the sympatric race &quot;A. h. wardi&quot; and may be the largest race in the species. In a survey of &quot;A. h. occidentalis&quot; in Florida, males were found to average and females average , with a range for both sexes of . This is mainly found near salt water, and was long thought to be a separate species. Birds intermediate between the normal morph and the white morph are known as Würdemann&#x27;s heron; these birds resemble a &quot;normal&quot; great blue with a white head.

The theory that great white herons may be a separate species (&quot;A. occidentalis&quot;) from the great blue heron has again been given some support by David Sibley.

===Similar species===

The &quot;great white heron&quot; could be confused with the great egret (&quot;Ardea alba&quot;), but is larger, with yellow legs as opposed to the great egret&#x27;s black legs. The reddish egret (&quot;Egretta rufescens&quot;) and little blue heron (&quot;Egretta caerulea&quot;) could be mistaken for the great blue heron, but are much smaller, and lack white on the head and yellow in the bill. At the southernmost extent of its range (e.g., Colombia and Panama), the great blue heron sometimes overlaps in range with the closely related and similarly sized cocoi heron (&quot;A. cocoi&quot;). The cocoi is distinguished by a striking white neck and solid black crown, but the duller juveniles are more easily confused. More superficially similar is the slightly smaller grey heron, which may sometimes appear as vagrants on the northern coasts of North America. The grey heron (which occupies the same ecological niche in Eurasia as the great blue heron) has very similar plumage, but has a solidly soft-gray neck. Erroneously, the great blue heron is sometimes referred to as a &quot;crane&quot;. Herons and cranes are easiest to differentiate in flight; cranes hold their necks straight when flying, but herons bend theirs into an S shape.

==Distribution and habitat==

The great blue heron is found throughout most of North America, as far north as Alaska and the southern Canadian provinces in the summer. In winter, the range extends south through Florida, Mexico, and the Caribbean to far northwestern South America (regular in Colombia and Venezuela, accidental elsewhere in South America). Birds east of the Rocky Mountains in the northern part of their range are migratory and winter in the coastal areas of the Southern United States, Central America, or northern South America. From the Southern United States southwards, and on the lower Pacific coast, they are year-round residents. However, their hardiness is such that individuals often remain through cold northern winters, as well, so long as fish-bearing waters remain unfrozen (which may be the case only in flowing water such as streams, creeks, and rivers).

The great blue heron can adapt to almost any wetland habitat in its range. It may be found in numbers in fresh and saltwater marshes, mangrove swamps, flooded meadows, lake edges, or shorelines. It is quite adaptable and may be seen in heavily developed areas as long as they hold bodies of fish-bearing water.

Great blue herons rarely venture far from bodies of water, but are occasionally seen flying over upland areas. They usually nest in trees or bushes near water&#x27;s edge, often on islands (which minimizes the potential for predation) or partially isolated spots.

It has been recorded as a vagrant in England, Greenland, Hawaii, and the Azores.

The great white heron is unique to South Florida, including Great White Heron National Wildlife Refuge in the Florida Keys.

==Behavior==

===Diet===
The primary food for the great blue heron is fish. While they can prey on various sizes of fish from small fingerlings to large adult fish, measuring in length and weighing around , small to medium-sized fish around are usually preferred. Primary prey fish is variable based on availability and abundance. In Nova Scotia, 98% of the diet was flounder. In British Columbia, the primary prey species are sticklebacks, gunnels, sculpins, and perch. California herons were found to live mostly on sculpin, bass, perch, flounder, and top smelt.

Besides fish, it is also known to feed on a wide range of prey opportunistically. Amphibians such as leopard frogs, American bullfrogs, toads and salamanders are readily taken, as well as reptiles such as small turtles, snakes and lizards. They can take on sizeable snakes, including water snakes in length. Aquatic crustaceans (such as crayfish, shrimp and crabs), grasshoppers, dragonflies and aquatic insects are taken as supplementary prey. They also prey on small mammals including shrews, rats, ground squirrels, and moles. One study in Idaho showed that from 24 to 40% of the diet was made up of voles. Remains of muskrats (&quot;Ondatra zibethicus&quot;) and long-tailed weasels (&quot;Mustela frenata&quot;) was also found in pellets during the study. There are reports that great blue heron prey on both young and adults of eastern cottontails (&quot;Sylvilagus floridanus&quot;). Though not often, birds such as black rails (&quot;Laterallus jamaicensis&quot;), phalaropes, American dippers (&quot;Cinclus mexicanus&quot;), pied-billed grebes (&quot;Podilymbus podiceps&quot;) and chicks of marsh terns (&quot;Chlidonias&quot;) are also taken.

Herons locate their food by sight and usually swallow it whole. They have been known to choke on prey that is too large. They are generally feeders. Individuals usually forage while standing in water, but also feed in fields or drop from the air, or perch, into water. Mice are occasionally preyed on in upland areas far from the species&#x27; typical aquatic environments. Occasionally, loose flocks gather to feed, and may be beneficial since they are able to locate schools of fish more easily.
As large wading birds, great blue herons are capable of feeding in deeper waters, thus are able to harvest from niche areas not open to most other heron species. Typically, the great blue heron feeds in shallow waters, usually less than deep, or at the water&#x27;s edge during both the night and the day, but especially around dawn and dusk. The most commonly employed hunting technique of the species is wading slowly with its long legs through shallow water and quickly spearing fish or frogs with its long, sharp bill. Although usually ponderous in movements, the great blue heron is adaptable in its fishing methods. Feeding behaviors variably have consisted of standing in one place, probing, pecking, walking at slow speeds, moving quickly, flying short distances and alighting, hovering over the water and picking up prey, diving headfirst into the water, alighting on water feet-first, jumping from perches feet-first, and swimming or floating on the surface of the water.

===Breeding===
This species usually breeds in colonies, in trees close to lakes or other wetlands. Adults generally return to the colony site after winter from December (in warmer climes such as California and Florida) to March (in cooler areas such as Canada). Usually, colonies include only great blue herons, though sometimes they nest alongside other species of herons. These groups are called a heronry (a more specific term than &quot;rookery&quot;). The size of these colonies may be large, ranging between five and 500 nests per colony, with an average around 160 nests per colony. A heronry is usually relatively close, usually within , to ideal feeding spots. Heronry sites are usually difficult to reach on foot (e.g., islands, trees in swamps, high branches, etc.) to protect from potential mammalian predators. Trees of any type are used when available. When not, herons may nest on the ground, sagebrush, cacti, channel markers, artificial platforms, beaver mounds, and duck blinds. Other waterbirds (especially smaller herons) and, occasionally, even fish and mammal-eating raptors may nest amongst colonies.

Although nests are often reused for many years and herons are socially monogamous within a single breeding season, individuals usually choose new mates each year. Males arrive at colonies first and settle on nests, where they court females; most males choose a different nest each year. Great blue herons build a bulky stick nest. Nests are usually around across when first constructed, but can grow to more than in width and deep with repeated use and additional construction. If the nest is abandoned or destroyed, the female may lay a replacement clutch. Reproduction is negatively affected by human disturbance, particularly during the beginning of nesting. Repeated human intrusion into nesting areas often results in nest failure, with abandonment of eggs or chicks. However, Vancouver B.C. Canada&#x27;s Stanley Park has had a healthy colony for some years right near its main entrance and tennis courts adjacent to English Bay and not far from Lost Lagoon. The park&#x27;s colony has had as many as 183 nests.

The female lays three to six pale blue eggs, which can measure from in length and in width, though the smallest eggs in the above sample may have been considered &quot;runt eggs&quot; too small to produce viable young. Egg weights range from . One brood is raised each year. First broods are laid generally from March to April. Eggs are usually laid at two-day intervals, incubated around 27 days, and hatch asynchronously over a period of several days. Males incubate for about 10.5 hours of each day, while females usually incubate for the remainder of each day and the night, with eggs left without incubation for about 6 minutes of each hour.

The first chick to hatch usually becomes more experienced in food handling and aggressive interactions with siblings, so it often grows more quickly than the other chicks. Both parents feed the young at the nest by regurgitating food. Parent birds have been shown to consume up to four times as much food when they are feeding young chicks (about 4300 kJ/day) than when laying or incubating eggs (about 1200 kJ/day). By the time they are 45 days old, the young weigh 86% of the adult&#x27;s mass. After about 55 days at the northern edge of the range (Alberta) and 80 days at the southern edge of the range (California), young herons take their first flight. They return to the nest to be fed for about another three weeks, following adults back from foraging grounds, and are likely to gradually disperse away from their original nest over the course of the ensuing winter. Young herons are not as successful at fish capture as adults, as strike rates are similar, but capture rates are about half that of adults during the first two months after fledging.

===Predation===
Predators of eggs and nestlings include turkey vultures (&quot;Cathartes aura&quot;), common ravens (&quot;Corvus corax&quot;), and American crows (&quot;Corvus brachyrhynchos&quot;). Red-tailed hawks (&quot;Buteo jamaicensis&quot;), American black bears (&quot;Ursus americanus&quot;), and raccoons (&quot;Procyon lotor&quot;) are known to take larger nestlings or fledglings, and in the latter predator, many eggs. In exceptional case, a young Harris&#x27;s hawk (&quot;Parabuteo unicinctus&quot;) killed a subadult great blue heron. Adult herons have few natural predators and are rarely preyed upon due to their large size and sharp beak, but bald eagles (&quot;Haliaeetus leucocephalus&quot;) are known to attack great blue herons at every stage of their lifecycle from in the egg to adulthood. And less frequently, golden eagles (&quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot;) and great horned owls (&quot;Bubo virginianus&quot;) are known to take adults. There is a single report that a large bobcat (&quot;Lynx rufus&quot;) managed to subdue and kill an adult great blue heron. Using its considerable size and dagger-like bill, a full-grown heron can be a formidable foe to a predator. In one instance, during an act of attempted predation by a golden eagle, a heron was able to mortally wound the eagle, although it succumbed to injuries sustained in the fight. When predation on an adult or chick occurs at a breeding colony, the colony can sometimes be abandoned by the other birds. The primary source of disturbance and breeding failures at heronries is human activities, mostly through human recreation or habitat destruction, as well as by egg-collectors and hunters.

==In art==
John James Audubon illustrates the great blue heron in &quot;Birds of America&quot;, Second Edition (published, London 1827–1838) as Plate 161. The image was engraved and colored by Robert Havell&#x27;s London workshops. The original watercolor by Audubon is in the collection of the New-York Historical Society.

==Popular culture==
The great blue heron (with its color changed to orange) is the basis of logos for the Delmarva Shorebirds minor league baseball team from the team&#x27;s 1996 inception.

Great white herons feature prominently in the logo for the Major League Soccer club Inter Miami CF. They were chosen for their local connection, as well as their quickness when hunting.

<doc id="198511" wikidata="Q1069362" url="?curid=198511" title="James Mellaart">
<text>James Mellaart FBA (14 November 1925 – 29 July 2012) was a British and Dutch archaeologist and author who is noted for his discovery of the Neolithic settlement of Çatalhöyük in Turkey. He was expelled from Turkey when he was suspected of involvement with the antiquities black market. He was also involved in a string of controversies, including the so-called mother goddess controversy in Anatolia, which eventually led to his being banned from excavations in Turkey in the 1960s. After his death, it was discovered that Mellaart had forged many of his &quot;finds&quot;, including murals and inscriptions from the Çatalhöyük site.

==Biography==
Mellaart was born in 1925 in London. He held both British and Dutch citizenship, and his family originally came from Scotland; according to one colleague, he &quot;considered himself a Scot&quot;. He lectured at the University of Istanbul and was an assistant director of the British Institute of Archaeology at Ankara (BIAA). In 1951 Mellaart began to direct excavations on the sites in Turkey with the assistance of his Turkish-born wife Arlette, who was the secretary of BIAA. He helped to identify the &quot;champagne-glass&quot; pottery of western Anatolia in the Late Bronze Age, which in 1954 led to the discovery of Beycesultan. After that expedition&#x27;s completion in 1959, he helped to publish its results. In 1964 he began to lecture in Anatolian archaeology in Ankara.

===Çatalhöyük excavation===
When Mellaart excavated the Çatalhöyük site in 1958, his team found more than 150 rooms and buildings, some decorated with murals, plaster reliefs, and sculptures. The site has since been seen as important as it has helped in the study of the social and cultural dynamics of one of the earliest and largest permanently occupied farming settlements in the Near East.

According to one of Mellaart&#x27;s theories, Çatalhöyük was a prominent place of mother goddess worship. However, many other archaeologists did not agree with him, and the dispute created a controversy. Mellaart was even accused of making up at least some of the mythological stories he presented as genuine. The furor caused the Turkish government to close up the site. The site was unattended for the next 30 years until excavations were begun anew in the 1990s.

The city as a whole covers roughly 32.5 acres (130,000 m2), and housed between 5,000 and 8,000 people, whereas the norm for the time was around one tenth of this size. The site stirred great excitement when Mellaart announced it and has since caused much head scratching. In fact, more recent work has turned up comparable features at other early Neolithic sites in the Near East, and this has benefited many people in their understanding of the site so that many of its one-time mysteries are no longer real issues.

===Dorak affair===
In 1965 Mellaart gave a report of a new rich find from Dorak to Seton Lloyd of the British Institute. Mellaart said that he had seen the treasures in 1958 in the İzmir home of a young woman whom he met on a train. She sat in front of him in the train car, wearing a gold bracelet which drew his attention. She told him that she had more at home, so he came over and saw the collection. She did not allow him to take photographs, but did let him make drawings of them. He gave the story to &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot;, and then Turkish authorities demanded to know why they had not been informed. He said that the young woman, named Anna Papastrati, asked him to keep it secret.
He asked the Institution to sponsor publications of the story, but they refused with no real evidence. When looking for Papastrati&#x27;s home, it turned out that the street address did not exist in İzmir, and her name was not found. The only document that can be traced to her is a typed letter that after examination appears to have been done by Mellaart&#x27;s wife Arlette. In consequence, Turkish officials expelled Mellaart for suspected antiquities smuggling. He was later allowed to return but eventually banned completely.

===Retirement===
As of 2005, Mellaart had retired from teaching and lived in North London with his wife and grandson. He died on 29 July 2012.

==Theories about early Anatolia==
According to Mellaart, the earliest Indo-Europeans in northwest Anatolia were the horse-riders who came to this region from the north and founded Demircihöyük in Eskişehir Province, Turkey, in ancient Phrygia, c. 3000 BCE. They were ancestors of the Luwians who inhabited Troy II, and spread widely in the Anatolian peninsula. It was Mellaart who first introduced the term &quot;Luwian&quot; to archaeological discourse in the 1950s. According to Christoph Bachhuber, current surveys and excavations tend to support many of Mellaart’s observations on changes in material culture at a regional scale.

Mellaart cited the distribution of a new type of wheel-made pottery, Red Slip Wares, as some of the best evidence for his theory. According to Mellaart, the proto-Luwian migrations to Anatolia came in several distinct waves over many centuries. The current trend is to see such migrations as mostly peaceful, rather than military conquests. Mellaart focused on the archaeologically observable destruction events of Troy II (ca. 2600–2400 BCE). For him, they were associated with the arrival of Indo-Europeans from the eastern Balkans.

==Forgeries==
In 2018 Mellaart&#x27;s son Alan and the Swiss-German geoarchaeologist Eberhard Zangger published an investigation according to which Mellaart had fabricated extensive forgeries in support of his theses. After investigating the late Mellaart&#x27;s apartment, Zangger revealed that Mellaart &quot;faked several of the ancient murals and may have run a &#x27;forger&#x27;s workshop&#x27; of sorts.&quot; These forgeries included prototypes of murals and engravings that Mellaart had claimed to have discovered in Çatalhöyük.

===Beyköy 2 inscription===
Another of Mellaart&#x27;s texts was a Hieroglyphic Luwian inscription named Beyköy 2, which received global headlines when it was announced in 2017 because it purported to contain specific history of the groups known to the Egyptians as Sea Peoples and to the biblical authors as the Philistines. This text, however, may also be a forgery, and several scholars have since debated its authenticity. Zangger and Fred Woudhuizen, who published the text after discovering drawings of it (held to be copies of drawings made by Georges Perrot in 1878 of stone blocks that later disappeared) among Mellaart&#x27;s papers, have contended for its authenticity, but other scholars consider the inscription spurious, pointing out that it fits the pattern of Mellaart&#x27;s previous forgeries but does not fit what is otherwise known about the history of the period.

<doc id="198512" wikidata="Q180095" url="?curid=198512" title="Tyrant">
<text>A tyrant (), in the modern English usage of the word, is an absolute ruler who is unrestrained by law, or one who has usurped a legitimate ruler&#x27;s sovereignty. Often portrayed as cruel, tyrants may defend their positions by resorting to repressive means. The original Greek term meant an absolute sovereign who came to power without constitutional right, yet the word had a neutral connotation during the Archaic and early Classical periods. However, Greek philosopher Plato saw &quot;tyrannos&quot; as a negative form of government, and on account of the decisive influence of philosophy on politics, deemed tyranny the &quot;fourth and worst disorder of a state.&quot;

The philosophers Plato and Aristotle defined a tyrant as a person who rules without law, using extreme and cruel methods against both his own people and others. The &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; defined the term as a usurper of sovereign power who makes &quot;his subjects the victims of his passions and unjust desires, which he substitutes for laws&quot;.
In the late fifth and fourth centuries BC, a new kind of tyrant, one who had the support of the military, arose – specifically in Sicily.

One can apply accusations of tyranny to a variety of types of government:
* to government by one individual (in an autocracy)
* to government by a minority (in an oligarchy, tyranny of the minority)
* to government by a majority (in a democracy, tyranny of the majority)

==Etymology==
The English noun &quot;tyrant&quot; appears in Middle English use, via Old French, from the 1290s.
The word derives from Latin &quot;tyrannus&quot;, meaning &quot;illegitimate ruler&quot;, and this in turn from the Greek &quot;tyrannos&quot; &quot;monarch, ruler of a polis&quot;; &quot;tyrannos&quot; in its turn has a Pre-Greek origin, perhaps from Lydian. The final &quot;-t&quot; arises in Old French by association with the present participles in &quot;-ant&quot;.

==Definition==
&quot;The word &#x27;tyranny&#x27; is used with many meanings, not only by the Greeks but throughout the tradition of the great books.&quot; The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; offers alternative definitions: a ruler, an illegitimate ruler (a usurper), an absolute ruler (despot), or an oppressive, unjust, or cruel ruler. The term is usually applied to vicious autocrats who rule their subjects by brutal methods. Oppression, injustice, and cruelty do not have standardized measurements or thresholds.

==Greco-Roman culture==

Ancient Greek and Sicilian tyrants were influential opportunists that came to power by securing the support of different factions of a deme. The word &quot;tyrannos&quot;, possibly pre-Greek, Pelasgian or eastern in origin, then carried no ethical censure; it simply referred to anyone, good or bad, who obtained executive power in a polis by unconventional means. Support for the tyrants could come from fellow oligarchs, from the growing middle class or from the peasants who had no land or were in debt to the wealthy landowners.

The Greek tyrants stayed in power by using mercenary soldiers from outside of their respective city-state. To mock tyranny, Thales wrote that the strangest thing to see is &quot;an aged tyrant&quot;, meaning that tyrants do not have the public support to survive for long.

===Archaic tyrants===
One of the earliest known uses of the word &#x27;tyrant&#x27; (in Greek) was by the poet Archilochus in reference to king Gyges of Lydia. The king&#x27;s assumption of power was unconventional.

The heyday of the Archaic period tyrants came in the early 6th century BC, when Cleisthenes ruled Sicyon in the Peloponnesus and Polycrates ruled Samos. During this time, revolts overthrew many governments in the Aegean world. Chilon, the ambitious and capable ephor of Sparta, built a strong alliance amongst neighboring states by making common cause with these groups seeking to oppose unpopular tyrannical rule. By intervening against the tyrants of Sicyon, Corinth and Athens, Sparta thus came to assume Hellenic leadership prior to the Persian invasions. Simultaneously Persia first started making inroads into Greece, and many tyrants sought Persian help against popular forces seeking to remove them.

====Corinth====
Corinth hosted one of the earliest of Greek tyrants. In Corinth, growing wealth from colonial enterprises, and the wider horizons brought about by the export of wine and oil, together with the new experiences of the Eastern Mediterranean brought back by returning mercenary hoplites employed overseas created a new environment. Conditions were right for Cypselus to overthrow the aristocratic power of the dominant but unpopular clan of Bacchiadae. Clan members were killed, executed, driven out or exiled in 657 BC. Corinth prospered economically under his rule, and Cypselus managed to rule without a bodyguard. When he then bequeathed his position to his son, Periander, the tyranny proved less secure, and Periander required a retinue of mercenary soldiers personally loyal to him.

Nevertheless, under Cypselus and Periander, Corinth extended and tightened her control over her colonial enterprises, and exports of Corinthian pottery flourished. However, tyrants seldom succeeded in establishing an untroubled line of succession. Periander threw his pregnant wife downstairs (killing her), burnt his concubines alive, exiled his son, warred with his father-in-law and attempted to castrate 300 sons of his perceived enemies. He retained his position. Periander&#x27;s successor was less fortunate and was expelled. Afterward, Corinth was ruled by a lackluster oligarchy, and was eventually eclipsed by the rising fortunes of Athens and Sparta.

====Athens====

Athens hosted its tyrants late in the Archaic period. In Athens, the inhabitants first gave the title of tyrant to Peisistratos (a relative of Solon, the Athenian lawgiver) who succeeded in 546 BC, after two failed attempts, to install himself as tyrant. Supported by the prosperity of the peasantry and landowning interests of the plain, which was prospering from the rise of olive oil exports, as well as his clients from Marathon, he managed to achieve authoritarian power. Through an ambitious program of public works, which included fostering the state cult of Athena; encouraging the creation of festivals; supporting the Panathenaic Games in which prizes were jars of olive oil; and supporting the Dionysia (ultimately leading to the development of Athenian drama), Peisistratos managed to maintain his personal popularity.

He was followed by his sons, and with the subsequent growth of Athenian democracy, the title &quot;tyrant&quot; took on its familiar negative connotations. The murder of Peisistratos&#x27; son, the tyrant Hipparchus by Aristogeiton and Harmodios in Athens in 514 BC marked the beginning of the so-called &quot;cult of the tyrannicides&quot; (i.e., of killers of tyrants). Contempt for tyranny characterised this cult movement. Despite financial help from Persia, in 510 the Peisistratids were expelled by a combination of intrigue, exile and Spartan arms. The anti-tyrannical attitude became especially prevalent in Athens after 508 BC, when Cleisthenes reformed the political system so that it resembled . Hippias (Peisistratos&#x27; other son) offered to rule the Greeks on behalf of the Persians and provided military advice to the Persians against the Greeks.

The Thirty Tyrants whom the Spartans imposed on a defeated Attica in 404 BC would not be classified as tyrants in the usual sense and were in effect an oligarchy.

===Sicilian tyrants===
The best known Sicilian tyrants appeared long after the Archaic period. The tyrannies of Sicily came about due to similar causes, but here the threat of Carthaginian attack prolonged tyranny, facilitating the rise of military leaders with the people united behind them. Such Sicilian tyrants as Gelo, Hiero I, Dionysius the Elder, Dionysius the Younger, and Agathocles of Syracuse maintained lavish courts and became patrons of culture. The dangers threatening the lives of the Sicilian tyrants are highlighted in the moral tale of the Sword of Damocles.

===Later tyrants===

Under the Macedonian hegemony in the 4th and 3rd century BC a new generation of tyrants rose in Greece, especially under the rule of king Antigonus II Gonatas, who installed his puppets in many cities of the Peloponnese. Examples were Cleon of Sicyon, Aristodemus of Megalopolis, Aristomachus I of Argos, Abantidas of Sicyon, Aristippus of Argos, Lydiadas of Megalopolis, Aristomachus II of Argos, and Xenon of Hermione.

Against these rulers, in 280 BC the democratic cities started to join forces in the Achaean League which was able to expand its influence even into Corinthia, Megaris, Argolis and Arcadia. From 251 BC under the leadership of Aratus of Sicyon, the Achaeans liberated many cities, in several cases by convincing the tyrants to step down, and when Aratus died in 213 BC, Hellas had been free of tyrants for more than 15 years. The last tyrant on the Greek mainland, Nabis of Sparta, was assassinated in 192 BC and after his death the Peloponnese was united as a confederation of stable democracies in the Achaean League.

===Roman tyrants===
Roman historians like Suetonius, Tacitus, Plutarch, and Josephus often spoke of &quot;tyranny&quot; in opposition to &quot;liberty&quot;. Tyranny was associated with imperial rule and those rulers who usurped too much authority from the Roman Senate. Those who were advocates of &quot;liberty&quot; tended to be pro-Republic and pro-Senate. For instance, regarding Julius Caesar and his assassins, Suetonius wrote:

Citizens of the empire were circumspect in identifying tyrants. &quot;Cicero&#x27;s head and hands [were] cut off and nailed to the rostrum of the Senate to remind everyone of the perils of speaking out against tyranny.&quot; There has since been a tendency to discuss tyranny in the abstract while limiting examples of tyrants to ancient Greek rulers.

Josephus identified tyrants in Biblical history (in Antiquities of the Jews) including Nimrod, Moses, the Maccabees and Herod the Great. He also identified some later tyrants.

===Greek political thought===
The Greeks defined both usurpers and those inheriting rule from usurpers as tyrants. Polybius (c. 150 BC) indicated that eventually, any one-man rule (monarchy/executive) governing form would become corrupted into a tyranny.

The Greek philosophers stressed the quality of rule rather than legitimacy or absolutism. &quot;Both Plato and Aristotle speak of the king as a good monarch and the tyrant as a bad one. Both say that monarchy, or rule by a single man, is royal when it is for the welfare of the ruled and tyrannical when it serves only the interest of the ruler. Both make lawlessness – either a violation of existing laws or government by personal fiat without settled laws – a mark of tyranny.&quot;

==In the classics==
Tyranny is considered an important subject, one of the &quot;Great Ideas&quot; of Western thought. The classics contain many references to tyranny and its causes, effects, methods, practitioners, alternatives. They consider tyranny from historical, religious, ethical, political and fictional perspectives. &quot;If any point in political theory is indisputable, it would seem to be that tyranny is the worst corruption of government – a vicious misuse of power and a violent abuse of human beings who are subject to it.&quot; While this may represent a consensus position among the classics, it is not unanimous – Thomas Hobbes dissented, claiming no objective distinction, such as being vicious or virtuous, existed among monarchs. &quot;They that are discontented under monarchy, call it tyranny; and they that are displeased with aristocracy, call it oligarchy: so also, they which find themselves grieved under a democracy, call it anarchy...&quot;

The first part of Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot; describes tyrants (&quot;who laid hold on blood and plunder&quot;) in the seventh level of Hell, where they are submerged in boiling blood. These include Alexander the Great and Attila the Hun, and share the level with highway robbers.

Niccolò Machiavelli conflates all rule by a single person (whom he generally refers to as a &quot;prince&quot;) with &quot;tyranny&quot;, regardless of the legitimacy of that rule, in his &quot;Discourses on Livy&quot;. He also identifies liberty with republican regimes. Sometimes he calls leaders of republics &quot;princes&quot;. He never uses the word in &quot;The Prince&quot;. He also does not share in the traditional view of tyranny, and in his Discourses he sometimes explicitly acts as an advisor to tyrants.

Ancient Greeks, as well as the Roman Republicans, became generally quite wary of many people seeking to implement a popular coup. Shakespeare portrays the struggle of one such anti-tyrannical Roman, Marcus Junius Brutus, in his play &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;.

In Gibbon&#x27;s Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Volume I, Chapter III, Augustus was shown to assume the power of a tyrant while sharing power with the reformed senate. &quot;After a decent resistance, the crafty tyrant submitted to the orders of the senate; and consented to receive the government of the provinces, and the general command of the Roman armies...&quot; Emperors &quot;humbly professed themselves the accountable ministers of the senate, whose supreme decrees they dictated and obeyed.&quot; The Roman Empire &quot;may be defined as an absolute monarchy disguised by the forms of a commonwealth.&quot; Roman emperors were deified. Gibbons called emperors tyrants and their rule tyranny. His definitions in the chapter were related to the absolutism of power alone – not oppression, injustice or cruelty. He ignored the appearance of shared rule.

==Enlightenment==
During the Age of Enlightenment, Western thinkers applied the word tyranny to the system of governance that had developed around aristocracy and monarchy. Specifically, English philosopher John Locke, as part of his argument against the &quot;Divine Right of Kings&quot; in his 1689 book &quot;Two Treatises of Government&quot;, defined it as such: &quot;Tyranny is the exercise of power beyond right, which nobody can have a right to; and this is making use of the power any one has in his hands, not for the good of those who are under it, but for his own private, separate advantage.&quot; Locke&#x27;s concept of tyranny influenced the writers of subsequent generations who developed the concept of tyranny as counterpoint to ideas of human rights and democracy. American statesman Thomas Jefferson described the actions of King George III as &quot;tyrannical&quot; in the United States Declaration of Independence.

Enlightenment philosophers seemed to define tyranny by its associated characteristics.
* &quot;The sovereign is called a tyrant who knows no laws but his caprice.&quot; Voltaire in a &quot;Philosophical Dictionary&quot;
* &quot;Where Law ends Tyranny begins.&quot; Locke in &quot;Two Treatises of Government&quot;

Edward Sexby&#x27;s 1657 pamphlet, &quot;Killing, No Murder&quot; outlined 14 key traits of a tyrant, as the pamphlet was written to inspire the assassination of Oliver Cromwell, and show in what circumstances an assassination might be considered honorable. The full document mulls over and references points on the matter from early pre-Christian history, up into the 17th century when the pamphlet was writ. Of the most prevailing traits of tyranny outlined, &quot;Killing, No Murder&quot; emphasizes:

# Prior military leadership service – tyrants are often former captains or generals, which allows them to assume a degree of honor, loyalty, and reputability regarding matters of state
# Fraud over force – most tyrants are likely to manipulate their way into supreme power rather than force it militarily
# Defamation and/or disbanding of formerly respectable persons, intellectuals, or institutions, and the discouragement of refined thinking or public involvement in state affairs
# Absence or minimalization of collective input, bargaining, or debate (assemblies, conferences, etc.)
# Amplification of military activity for the purposes of public distraction, raising new levies, or opening future business pathways
# Tit-for-tat symbiosis in domestic relations: e.g. finding religious ideas permissible insofar as they are useful and flattering of the tyrant; finding aristocrats or the nobility laudable &amp; honorable insofar as they are compliant with the will of the tyrant or in service of the tyrant, etc.
# Pretenses toward inspiration from God
#Pretenses toward a love of God and religion
#Grow or maintain public impoverishment as a way of removing the efficacy of the people&#x27;s will

In Scotland, Samuel Rutherford&#x27;s Lex Rex and Alexander Shields&#x27; &quot;A Hind Let Loose&quot; were influential works of theology written in opposition to tyranny.

A modern tyrant might be defined by proven violation of international criminal law such as crimes against humanity.

==Lists of tyrants==

Various lists of tyrants include:
* 100 throughout history, including 40 from the 20th century
* 13 20th century tyrants
* 30 tyrants of the late 20th century
* 20 tyrants of the early 21st century

There are also numerous book titles which identify tyrants by name or circumstances.

Among English rulers, several have been identified as tyrants by book title: John, King of England (who signed the Magna Carta), Henry VIII of England and Oliver Cromwell.

==Methods of obtaining and retaining power==
The path of a tyrant can appear easy and pleasant (for all but the aristocracy). In 1939, Will Durant wrote: Hence the road to power in Greece commercial cities was simple: to attack the aristocracy, defend the poor, and come to an understanding with the middle classes. Arrived at power, the dictator abolished debts, or confiscated large estates, taxed the rich to finance public works, or otherwise redistributed the over-concentrated wealth; and while attaching the masses to himself through such measures, he secured the support of the business community by promoting trade with state coinage and commercial treaties, and by raising the social prestige of the bourgeoisie. Forced to depend upon popularity instead of hereditary power, the dictatorships for the most part kept out of war, supported religion, maintained order, promoted morality, favored the higher status of women, encouraged the arts, and lavished revenues upon the beautification of their cities. And they did all these things, in many cases, while preserving the forms of popular government, so that even under despotism the people learned the ways of liberty. When the dictatorship [of the tyrant] had served to destroy the aristocracy the people destroyed the dictatorship; and only a few changes were needed to make democracy of freemen a reality as well as a form.

Ancient Greek philosophers (who were aristocrats) were far more critical in reporting the methods of tyrants. The justification for ousting a tyrant was absent from the historian&#x27;s description but was central to the philosophers.

===Obtaining===
In the &quot;Republic&quot;, Plato stated: &quot;The people have always some champion whom they set over them and nurse into greatness. [...] This and no other is the root from which a tyrant springs; when he first appears he is a protector&quot;.

Tyrants either inherit the position from a previous ruler, rise up the ranks in the military/party or seize power as new men. Early texts called only the usurpers tyrants, distinguishing them from &quot;bad kings&quot;. Such tyrants may act as renters, rather than owners, of the state.

The political methods of obtaining power were occasionally supplemented by theater or force. Peisistratus of Athens blamed self-inflicted wounds on enemies to justify a bodyguard which he used to seize power. He later appeared with a woman dressed as a goddess to suggest divine sanction of his rule. The third time he used mercenaries to seize and retain power.

===Retaining===
Lengthy recommendations of methods were made to tyrants by Aristotle (in &quot;Politics&quot; for example) and Niccolò Machiavelli (in &quot;The Prince&quot;). These are, in general, force and fraud. They include hiring bodyguards, stirring up wars to keep the people busy and dependent, purges, assassinations, and unwarranted searches and seizures. Aristotle suggested an alternative means of retaining power – ruling justly.

The methods of tyrants to retain power include placating world opinion by staging rigged elections, using or threatening to use violence, seeking popular support by appeals to patriotism, and claiming that conditions have improved.

<text>[[Sugar Ray Leonard]] vs. [[Thomas Hearns]], billed as The Showdown, was a professional boxing match contested on September 16, 1981, for the undisputed welterweight championship.

==Background==
Sugar Ray Leonard won the WBC welterweight title with a fifteenth-round knockout of Wilfred Benítez in 1979. He lost it to Roberto Durán by a close decision in June 1980 and regained it five months later in the infamous No Más Fight, in which Duran quit in the eighth round. In June 1981, Leonard moved up to the light-middleweight division for one fight, knocking out Ayub Kalule in nine rounds to win the WBA light-middleweight title.

Hearns won the WBA welterweight title in 1980, scoring a second-round knockout of Jose &#x27;Pipino&#x27; Cuevas in Detroit, Michigan. He made three successful title defenses, stopping Luis Primera, Randy Shields, and Pablo Baez.

Promoted as &quot;The Showdown&quot; Leonard (30-1 with 21 KO) fought Hearns (32-0 with 30 KO) on September 16, 1981, at Caesar&#x27;s Palace in Las Vegas, NV to unify the world welterweight championship in a scheduled fifteen-rounder. They fought before a live crowd of 23,618 and a worldwide TV audience of some 300 million. It was one of the first major bouts to be promoted by Main Events.

==The fight==
The fight began as expected, Leonard boxing from a distance and Hearns stalking. Leonard had difficulty with Hearns&#x27; long reach and sharp jab. By the end of round five, Leonard had a growing swelling under his left eye, and Hearns had built a considerable lead on the scorecards. Leonard, becoming more aggressive, hurt Hearns in the sixth with a left hook to the chin. Leonard battered Hearns in rounds six and seven, but Hearns miraculously regrouped. Hearns started to stick and move, and he started to pile up points again. The roles reversed: Leonard became the stalker and Hearns became the boxer.

Hearns won rounds nine through twelve on all three scorecards. Between rounds twelve and thirteen, Leonard&#x27;s trainer, the legendary Angelo Dundee, said the now legendary words &quot;You&#x27;re blowing it now, son! You&#x27;re blowing it!&quot;

Leonard, with a badly swollen left eye, came out roaring for the thirteenth round. After hurting Hearns with a right, Leonard exploded with a combination of punches and sent Hearns through the ropes. Hearns managed to rise, but was dropped again near the end of the round.

In round fourteen, after staggering Hearns with an overhand right, Leonard pinned Hearns against the ropes, where he unleashed another furious combination, prompting referee Davey Pearl to stop the contest and award Sugar Ray Leonard the undisputed world welterweight championship. Hearns was leading by scores of 124–122, 125–122, and 125–121.

==Aftermath==
After the fight, there was controversy due to the scoring of rounds six and seven. Even though Leonard dominated, hurting Hearns and battering him, all three judges gave both rounds to Leonard by a 10-9 margin. Many felt that the ten-point must scoring system was not properly used and those rounds should have been scored 10–8. While the 10-point must system is now regarded as the international standard for scoring combat sports, at the time the Nevada Athletic Commission had only recently adopted it for all fights it sanctioned. As such, judges used to scoring with older methods—such as the 5-point must system or round scoring—had little guidance as to whether or not a round could be scored 10-8 if it did not contain a knockdown. There was some talk also of the fight being ended sooner and for less reason than was usual for the era.

===Rematch===

The rematch, billed as &quot;The War&quot;, would happen eight years later June 12, 1989. Although most at the fight including the television announcers scored it as Hearns winning, the judges called it a draw and were loudly booed by the ringside crowd. With one judge scoring the fight 113-112 for Leonard, another judge scoring it 113–112 in favor of Hearns and the third scoring it even at 112–112.

==Undercard==
Confirmed bouts:
*Marvis Frazier knocks out Guy Casale in Round 4.
*Tony Ayala knocks out Jose Baquedano in only 69 seconds of round 1.
*Edwin Rosario beat James Martinez by a 10-round Unanimous Decision.

<text>Paramyxoviridae (from Greek &quot;para-&quot; “by the side of” and &quot;myxa&quot; “mucus”) is a family of negative-strand RNA viruses in the order &quot;Mononegavirales&quot;. Vertebrates serve as natural hosts. Diseases associated with this family include measles, mumps, and respiratory tract infections. The family has four subfamilies, 17 genera, three of which are unassigned to a subfamily, and 78 species.

== Structure ==
Virions are enveloped and can be spherical or pleomorphic and capable of producing filamentous virions. The diameter is around 150 nm. Genomes are linear, around 15kb in length. Fusion proteins and attachment proteins appear as spikes on the virion surface. Matrix proteins inside the envelope stabilise virus structure. The nucleocapsid core is composed of the genomic RNA, nucleocapsid proteins, phosphoproteins and polymerase proteins.

== Genome ==

The genome is nonsegmented, negative-sense RNA, 15–19 kilobases in length, and contains six to 10 genes. Extracistronic (noncoding) regions include:
* A 3’ leader sequence, 50 nucleotides in length, which acts as a transcriptional promoter.
* A 5’ trailer sequence, 50–161 nucleotides long
* Intergenomic regions between each gene, which are three nucleotides long for morbilliviruses, respiroviruses, and henipaviruses, and variable length (one-56 nucleotides) for rubulaviruses.

Each gene contains transcription start/stop signals at the beginning and end, which are transcribed as part of the gene.

Gene sequence within the genome is conserved across the family due to a phenomenon known as transcriptional polarity (see &quot;Mononegavirales&quot;) in which genes closest to the 3’ end of the genome are transcribed in greater abundance than those towards the 5’ end. This is a result of structure of the genome. After each gene is transcribed, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase pauses to release the new mRNA when it encounters an intergenic sequence. When the RNA polymerase is paused, a chance exists that it will dissociate from the RNA genome. If it dissociates, it must re-enter the genome at the leader sequence, rather than continuing to transcribe the length of the genome. The result is that the further downstream genes are from the leader sequence, the less they will be transcribed by RNA polymerase.

Evidence for a single promoter model was verified when viruses were exposed to UV light. UV radiation can cause dimerization of RNA, which prevents transcription by RNA polymerase. If the viral genome follows a multiple promoter model, the level inhibition of transcription should correlate with the length of the RNA gene. However, the genome was best described by a single promoter model. When paramyxovirus genome was exposed to UV light, the level of inhibition of transcription was proportional to the distance from the leader sequence. That is, the further the gene is from the leader sequence, the greater the chance of RNA dimerization inhibiting RNA polymerase.

The virus takes advantage of the single promoter model by having its genes arranged in relative order of protein needed for successful infection. For example, nucleocapsid protein, N, is needed in greater amounts than RNA polymerase, L.

Viruses in the &quot;Paramyxoviridae&quot; family are also antigenically stable, meaning that the glycoproteins on the viruses are consistent between different strains of the same type. Two reasons for this phenomenon are posited: The first is that the genome is nonsegmented, thus cannot undergo genetic reassortment. For this process to occur, segments needed as reassortment happen when segments from different strains are mixed together to create a new strain. With no segments, nothing can be mixed with one another, so no antigenic shift occurs. The second reason relates to the idea of antigenic drift. Since RNA-dependent RNA polymerase does not have an error-checking function, many mutations are made when the RNA is processed. These mutations build up and eventually new strains are created. Due to this concept, one would expect that paramyxoviruses should not be antigenically stable; however, the opposite is seen to be true. The main hypothesis behind why the viruses are antigenically stable is that each protein and amino acid has an important function. Thus, any mutation would lead to a decrease or total loss of function, which would in turn cause the new virus to be less efficient. These viruses would not be able to survive as long compared to the more virulent strains, and so would die out.

Many paramyxovirus genomes follow the &quot;rule of six&quot;. The total length of the genome is almost always a multiple of six. This is probably due to the advantage of having all RNA bound by N protein (since N binds hexamers of RNA). If RNA is left exposed, the virus does not replicate efficiently. The gene sequence is:
* Nucleocapsid – phosphoprotein – matrix – fusion – attachment – large (polymerase)

== Proteins ==

* N – the nucleocapsid protein associates with genomic RNA (one molecule per hexamer) and protects the RNA from nuclease digestion
* P – the phosphoprotein binds to the N and L proteins and forms part of the RNA polymerase complex. P is the polymerase co-factor.
* M – the matrix protein assembles between the envelope and the nucleocapsid core, it organizes and maintains virion structure
* F – the fusion protein projects from the envelope surface as a trimer, and mediates cell entry by inducing fusion between the viral envelope and the cell membrane by class I fusion. One of the defining characteristics of members of the family Paramyxoviridae is the requirement for a neutral pH for fusogenic activity.
* H/HN/G – the cell attachment proteins span the viral envelope and project from the surface as spikes. They bind to proteins on the surface of target cells to facilitate cell entry. Proteins are designated H (hemagglutinin) for morbilliviruses as they possess haemagglutination activity, observed as an ability to cause red blood cells to clump in laboratory tests. HN (Hemagglutinin-neuraminidase) attachment proteins occur in respiroviruses, rubulaviruses and avulaviruses. These possess both haemagglutination and neuraminidase activity, which cleaves sialic acid on the cell surface, preventing viral particles from reattaching to previously infected cells. Attachment proteins with neither haemagglutination nor neuraminidase activity are designated G (glycoprotein). These occur in henipaviruses.
* L – the large protein is the catalytic subunit of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP)
* Accessory proteins – a mechanism known as RNA editing (see &quot;Mononegavirales&quot;) allows multiple proteins to be produced from the P gene. These are not essential for replication but may aid in survival in vitro or may be involved in regulating the switch from mRNA synthesis to antigenome synthesis.

== Life cycle ==

Viral replication is cytoplasmic. Entry into the host cell is achieved by viral attachment to host cell. Replication and transcription follow the negative-stranded RNA virus models. Translation takes place by leaky scanning, ribosomal shunting, and RNA termination-reinitiation. The virus exits the host cell by budding. Vertebrates, including humans and birds serve as the natural hosts. Transmission route is airborne particles.

The &quot;Paramyxoviridae&quot; are able to undergo mRNA editing, which produces different proteins from the same mRNA transcript by slipping back one base to read off in a different open reading frame (ORF) due to the presence of secondary structures such as pseudoknots. &quot;Paramyxoviridae&quot; also undergo transcriptional stuttering to produce the poly (A) tail at the end of mRNA transcripts by repeatedly moving back one nucleotide at a time at the end of the RNA template.

== Taxonomy ==

== Pathogenic paramyxoviruses ==
A number of important human diseases are caused by paramyxoviruses. These include mumps, as well as measles, which caused around 136,200 deaths in 2022.

The human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV) are the second most common causes of respiratory tract disease in infants and children. There are four types of HPIVs, known as HPIV-1, HPIV-2, HPIV-3 and HPIV-4. HPIV-1 and HPIV-2 may cause cold-like symptoms, along with croup in children. HPIV-3 is associated with bronchiolitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia. HPIV-4 is less common than the other types, and is known to cause mild to severe respiratory tract illnesses.

Paramyxoviruses are also responsible for a range of diseases in other animal species, for example canine distemper virus (dogs), phocine distemper virus (seals), cetacean morbillivirus (dolphins and porpoises), Newcastle disease virus (birds), and rinderpest virus (cattle). 

Some paramyxoviruses, such as the henipaviruses, are zoonotic pathogens, occurring naturally in an animal host, but also able to infect humans. Hendra virus and Nipah virus in the genus &quot;Henipavirus&quot; have emerged in humans and livestock in Australia and Southeast Asia. Both viruses are contagious, highly virulent, and capable of infecting a number of mammalian species and causing potentially fatal disease. Due to the lack of either a licensed human vaccine (a Hendra virus vaccine exists for horses) or antiviral therapies, Hendra virus and Nipah virus are designated as Biosafety level (BSL) 4 agents. The genomic structure of both viruses is that of a typical paramyxovirus.

Novel paramyxoviruses have been discovered from terrestrial, volant, and aquatic animals, demonstrating a vast host range and great viral genetic diversity. As molecular technology advances and viral surveillance programs are implemented, the discovery of new viruses in this group is increasing.

The evolution of paramyxoviruses is still debated. Using pneumoviruses (mononegaviral family &quot;Pneumoviridae&quot;) as an outgroup, paramyxoviruses can be divided into two clades: one consisting of avulaviruses and rubulaviruses and one consisting of respiroviruses, henipaviruses, and morbilliviruses. Within the second clade the respiroviruses appear to be the basal group. The respirovirus-henipavirus-morbillivirus clade may be basal to the avulavirus-rubulavirus clade.

<doc id="198524" wikidata="Q239909" url="?curid=198524" title="T-28 (medium tank)">
<text>The T-28 was a Soviet multi-turreted medium tank. The prototype was completed in 1931, and production began in late 1932. It was an infantry support tank intended to break through fortified defences. The T-28 was designed to complement the heavier T-35 (also multi-turreted), with which it shared turret designs. The type did not have great success in combat, but it played an important role as a development project for Soviet tank designers. A series of new ideas and solutions that were tried out on the T-28 were later incorporated in future models.

== Design history==
The T-28 was in many ways similar to the British Vickers A1E1 Independent tank, which greatly influenced tank design in the period between the wars, even though only a single prototype was manufactured in 1926. The Kirov Factory in Leningrad began manufacturing a tank that was based on the design of the British Independent in 1932. The T-28 tank was officially approved on 11 August 1933. The T-28 had one large turret with a 76.2 mm gun and two smaller turrets with 7.62 mm machine guns. A total of 503 T-28 tanks were manufactured over the eight-year period from 1933 to 1941.

== Combat history ==
The T-28 was deployed during the 1939 Soviet invasion of Poland, and the Winter War with Finland. During the initial stages of the Winter War, the tank was used in direct fire missions against Finnish pillboxes. In the course of these operations, it was found that the armour was inadequate and an upgrade was initiated. The frontal armour plates were upgraded from 30 mm to 80 mm and side and rear plates to 40 mm thickness. With this up-armoured version, the Red Army broke through the main Finnish defensive fortification, the Mannerheim Line.

According to Russian historian Maksim Kolomiets in his book &quot;T-28. Stalin&#x27;s Three-headed Monster&quot;, over 200 T-28s were knocked out during the Winter War, but only 20 of them were irrecoverable losses (including two captured by the Finnish Army). Due to the proximity of the Kirov Plant, all other knocked-out tanks were repaired, some of them more than five times.

The Finns nicknamed the T-28 &quot;Postivaunu&quot; (&quot;mail coach&quot; or &quot;postal wagon&quot;) after a lone Soviet T-28 tank commander was captured with his knocked out tank that carried the monthly salary of, and mail addressed to, the 91st Tank Battalion (this occurred 19–20 December 1939, during the battle of Summa). Another explanation was that the straight vertical surfaces alluded to the stagecoaches of the Wild West. The T-28 was also nicknamed &quot;Kivitalo&quot; (&quot;stone building&quot;, i.e., apartment house) by the Finns due to its large size.

The Finns captured two T-28s during the Winter War and five in the Continuation War, for a total of 7 vehicles. The Finnish Army did not have tractors that could tow away vehicles as heavy as the T-28, and so captured T-28s that could not move under their own power were stripped of anything useful (machine guns, radios etc.) and left where they were.

The Soviets had 411 T-28 tanks when the Germans invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941. A large majority of these were lost during the first two months of the invasion, many of them abandoned after mechanical breakdown. Some T-28s took part in the 1941 winter defense of Leningrad and Moscow, but after late 1941, they were rare in Red Army service; a few were operated by enemy forces.

Today, three T-28s remain, two in Finland and one in Moscow. One restored T-28 is on display in Finnish field camouflage in the Parola Tank Museum, Finland. A further wreck is stored at Parola, now awaiting restoration and a hull previously used as a bunker was discovered near St. Petersburg.

== Assessment ==
The T-28 had a number of advanced features for its time, including radio (in all tanks) and anti-aircraft machine gun mounts. Just before the Second World War, many received armour upgrades, bringing its protection on par with the early Panzer IV, although its suspension and layout were outdated.

== Variants ==
* T-28 Model 1934 (German designation: T-28A) – main production model with the same machine gun turrets, and similar main turret, with the KT-28 76.2 mm gun, as the T-35 heavy tank. During the production minor changes were introduced, such as the addition of a grille above the rear fan in 1935, two hatches replacing the larger one on the turret and the addition of a ball mount for the rear machine gun in 1936.
* T-28 Model 1938 (T-28B) – version with the improved L-10 76.2 mm gun (from 16.5 to 26 calibres). Some older tanks were also backfitted with spare L-10 guns. The rod antenna replaced the horseshoe in early 1939.
* T-28E (T-28C) – 1940 addition of appliqué armour in response to poor performance in Finland. Total front armour was increased to 50–60 mm, weight to 32 tonnes, and road speed dropped to 23 km/h. 111 tanks of all models (possibly including ones with conical turrets) were upgraded in late 1940.
*T-28-57-experimental version with ZiS-4 57mm high-velocity gun, contemporary of the T-34-57 and KV-1-57 experimental tanks.
* T-28-85— prototype with the improved F30 85 mm gun.
* T-28 Model 1940 – the final batch of about thirteen tanks with main conical turret similar to ones on the lateproduction T-35 tanks.

=== Experimental models ===
Several self-propelled guns, the IT-28 bridging tank, and an engineering vehicle with mine rollers were tested on the T-28 tank chassis, but none were accepted for production. The T-29 was a prototype medium tank, a modernized T-28 with Christie suspension - a later version of this vehicle was considered for the competition of prototypes, which led to the T-34, but by then it was outdated (not to be confused with a Grotte tank project also called T-29). The T-28 also served as a testbed for the KV tank suspension.

== Operators ==
**Museums and displays on the Russian federation: Central Armed Forces Museum. Moscow, model 1927/1932, a hull from T-28 in Museum &quot;Sestroretsk Boundary&quot; at industrial complex-1 &quot;Elephant&quot;, Beloostrov
* - captured seven Soviet T-28 tanks during the Winter War and the Second World War.
**Museums and displays in Finland: Register number Ps. 241-4 Parola Tank Museum, Ps. 241 wreck, Ps. 241 Mikkeli on the front yard of the former reserve noncommissioned officer school in Karkialampi near the landforce headquarters,
* Hungary - the Hungarian Army used one captured T-28 tank in the summer of 1941.
* Romania - As of 1 November 1942, Romanian forces captured 2 T-28 tanks.
* Nazi Germany - Germany captured and made operational at least one T-28 during Operation Barbarossa, designated Panzerkampfwagen T-28 746(r).
* - According to one source, two were sold to Turkey in 1935, along with 60 T-26, five T-27 tankettes, and about 60 BA-6 armoured cars to form the 1st Tank Regiment of the 2nd Cavalry Division at Luleburgaz.

<text>The Rhein-Neckar-Kreis is a district in the northwest of Baden-Württemberg, Germany. The administrative headquarters are based in the city Heidelberg, which is a district-free city. As of 2019, the district is the most populous in Baden-Württemberg.

==History==
The district was created in 1973 by merging the previous districts of Heidelberg, Mannheim and Sinsheim.

==Geography==
The district is named after the two main rivers which flow through the district, the Rhine and Neckar. The highest elevation is 580 m near the 584 m tall peak of the Odenwald mountain Stiefelhöhe, located near Heiligkreuzsteinach. The lowest elevation with 92 m is in Ilvesheim, located in the Neckar valley.

==Sights==
==Government==
The district is governed by a district assembly (&quot;Kreistag&quot;) and a district executive (&quot;Landrat&quot;). The eligible voters of the district elect the Kreistag every 5 years. This body in turn elects the Landrat every 8 years. The Landrat is the legal representative of the district as well as the speaker of the Kreistag and its committees. The Landrat manages the office of the Landrat (&quot;Landratsamt&quot;) and is the chief official of the district. The duties of the Landrat include the preparation of the district assembly meetings and its committees. The Landrat calls the meetings, acts as speaker, and carries out the decisions made. In the Kreistag, the Landrat has no vote. The Landrat has a second, called the first district official (&quot;Erste Landesbeamte&quot;).

<text>Widerøes Flyveselskap AS, trading as Widerøe, is a Norwegian airline, and is the largest regional airline operating in the Nordic countries. The airline&#x27;s fleet of 48 aircraft, includes 45 De Havilland Dash 8 turboprops as well as 3 Embraer E190-E2 aircraft, serving 49 domestic and international destinations. Widerøe has a turnover of ; carries 2.8 million annual passengers; has 3,500 employees and performs 450 take-offs and landings each day.

The airline was established in 1934 by Viggo Widerøe, a Norwegian aviator, and was engaged in various general aviation activities in its early days. In 1936, Widerøe started scheduled seaplane flights and, from 1940, also ambulance flights. During the 1940s and 1950s, the airline increased its seaplane routes and established a fleet based on de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter and Noorduyn Norseman aircraft. From 1968, Widerøe started flying to STOLports in northern and western Norway using DHC-6 Twin Otters, and later also with Dash 7 aircraft. In 1989, Widerøe bought Norsk Air and started services from Sandefjord.

During the 1990s, Widerøe replaced all its aircraft with Dash 8 aircraft; in the 2000s it was bought by the SAS Group and took over SAS Commuter&#x27;s operations in northern Norway. In 2010, Widerøe took over regional SAS services in western Norway. In 2013, SAS Group sold 80% of the shares to WF Holding, an investment company controlled by Torghatten ASA, and in June 2016 the remaining 20% of the shares were transferred to WF Holding, ending SAS ownership of Widerøe, albeit still as a close regional partner of SAS. In July 2023, Norwegian Air Shuttle announced a deal to acquire Widerøe for (), which was finalised in January 2024.

Public service obligation services to regional airports make up slightly less than half of Widerøe&#x27;s operations. The remaining services are to primary airports in northern Norway, and services from Sandefjord and Bergen to other primary airports, and some international services from Oslo, Sandefjord, Kristiansand, Stavanger, Bergen, and Trondheim. Widerøe&#x27;s operations are focused on point-to-point transit, although the airline essentially feeds medium-haul and international airlines. Widerøe has interlining agreements and participates in EuroBonus for international flights.

The company&#x27;s head offices are in Bodø, although it retains a large administrative center in Oslo and a smaller office in Mosjøen. The main bases are Sandefjord, Bodø, Tromsø, Bergen, and Oslo. Widerøe also has a technical base in Florø.

==History==


Widerøe was established on the foundations of two small aircraft operators. The first was the company Lotsberg &amp; Skappel. The other was Widerøe &amp; Bjørneby, which was founded by Viggo Widerøe and Halvor Bjørneby. During the winter, they stationed aircraft at mountain resorts and made revenue from flying skiers into the wilderness. Aerial advertising flights were introduced, in which a company or product name was painted on an aircraft&#x27;s fuselage, with a neon-light version underneath, and leaflets dropped mid-flight.

On 19 February 1934, Widerøe&#x27;s Flyveselskap A/S was founded by Viggo Widerøe, Einar Isdahl, and Arild Widerøe. In 1935, the company started in the cartography business. In 1937, the company made 44 flights along the coast of Antarctica, covering of coast at least inland. These flights were ordered by Lars Christensen for cartography. During 1938, the company&#x27;s Bogstad workshop and Birger Hønningstad started a joint venture in which Widerøe built Hønningstad Norge aircraft.

Following the outbreak of World War II, all pilots were conscripted into the military and there was a ban on civilian aviation. In 1940, the company started air ambulance flights for the military. Following the German invasion of Norway, many of Widerøe&#x27;s pilots and aircraft were flown to Mjøsa where they served as part of the defence. All civilian aircraft were grounded during the occupation, and German authorities demanded that magnetos and propellers be handed in. The workshop at Bogstad was kept busy with the production of ambulance sleds for the German military. In secret, the company also started building the Hønningstad C-5 Polar ambulance aircraft at Bogstad.

After the liberation of Norway in 1945, there was still a flight ban, and the employees at Bogstad were hired by the Royal Norwegian Air Force at Oslo Airport, Fornebu. The company received permission to fly from 2 February 1946. In 1947, Forenede Industrier bought the majority of the company. Viggo Widerøe was again hired as managing director.

In 1948, the company merged with Narvik-based Polarfly, and changed its name to Widerøe&#x27;s Flyveselskap &amp; Polarfly A/S. The following year, the company began an aerial photography operation. In 1953, the company chose to differentiate and started production of emergency rafts; refrigerated garages in aluminium; and thermoelements for industry. In 1954, the company received a subcontract from Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), the successor of DNL, to operate a seaplane route from Tromsø via Alta, Hammerfest, and Kirkenes to Vadsø. For this route, the company bought its first de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter. On 1 July 1958, the company changed its name back to Widerøe&#x27;s Flyveselskap A/S.

In 1969, Per Bergsland replaced Viggo Widerøe as CEO. In 1970, the company was split in two: the aerial photography division was sold to competitor Fjellanger, and the new company Fjellanger Widerøe was created. Scheduled services remained with Widerøe. The airline&#x27;s last seaplane was decommissioned in 1971. In April 1980, Widerøe started an international service on behalf of SAS.

==Destinations==
Widerøe has been awarded public service obligation contracts by the Ministry of Transport and Communications to connect regional airports to primary airports. Twenty-five such airports were served in a contract running from 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2012, with the company having lost the bid for services to three. The services connect smaller communities and towns to regional centers and to primary airports that provide onwards service with jet aircraft.

Eight airports in Finnmark county and one in Troms county are connected to Tromsø Airport, with a limited number of services also connecting to two of the three primary airports in Finnmark—Alta and Kirkenes. Between Tromsø and Bodø, Widerøe serves six airports, of which two connect to Tromsø and all to Bodø. South of Bodø, there are six airports in Helgeland and Namdalen, which are all connected to Bodø and Trondheim Airport, Værnes. In Sogn og Fjordane and Sunnmøre, Widerøe connects four airports to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen and Bergen Airport, Flesland.

Widerøe&#x27;s main domestic hauling between primary airports is from its base at Sandefjord Airport, Torp. Services are provided up to five times per day to Trondheim, Stavanger and Bergen, as well as seasonal services to Bodø and Tromsø. In Northern Norway, Widerøe operates some services connecting primary airports, including the links from Tromsø to Alta, Hammerfest, Kirkenes and Vadsø Airport, and connecting Harstad/Narvik Airport, Evenes to Tromsø, Bodø and Trondheim.

International services are provided to and from five Norwegian airports to seven foreign airports in Sweden, Denmark and the United Kingdom. From Sandefjord and Trondheim, Widerøe connects to Scandinavian Airlines&#x27; hub at Copenhagen Airport. From Oslo, Widerøe operates four daily services to Göteborg Landvetter Airport, as well as summer routes to Visby Airport and Bornholm Airport. From Bergen and Stavanger, Widerøe serves Aberdeen Airport. From Bergen Widerøe fly to Liverpool John Lennon Airport and London Heathrow and from Stavanger; Newcastle Airport.

In 2010, Widerøe took over the regional routes previously operated by SAS in Western Norway; these connect Kristiansand and Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget to Stavanger and Bergen, and Haugesund and Molde to Bergen. These routes will replace the SAS Fokker 50 aircraft with -300 and Q400 aircraft.

In 2016 the airline was awarded a five-year contract by the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications to operate 13 of Norway&#x27;s Public Service Obligation routes and started operating the routes in April 2017.

===Codeshare agreements===
Widerøe has codeshare agreements with the following airlines (as of February 2020):
* Air France
* Finnair

*Lufthansa

==Fleet==


===Current fleet===
, Widerøe operates the following aircraft:

===Fleet development===
Between 2000 and 2018, the airline operated exclusively de Havilland Canada/Bombardier Dash 8 aircraft. As of 2018, Widerøe was the world&#x27;s largest operator of the Dash series, after Piedmont Airlines retired their fleet. As of 2013, Widerøe is the first and only airline in the world to operate every single variant of the Dash 8 simultaneously, and is one of the few airlines to ever operate all variants of the Dash 8, as well as the older DHC-6 Twin Otter and Dash 7.

In January 2017, Widerøe announced it had signed a contract with Embraer for up to 15 new Embraer E190-E2 jets, with firm orders for three E190-E2 aircraft and purchase rights on 12 more jets from the Embraer E2 family. The airline is the first operator of the E190-E2 aircraft. The aircraft is Widerøe&#x27;s first jet aircraft, after previously operating an all-turboprop fleet.
In April 2018, Wideroe received its first Embraer E190-E2. The delivery was the first E2 aircraft to be delivered to an airline. It was handed over to Wideroe by Embraer in a large ceremony, with both Embraer and Wideroe staff as well as media present. Its first revenue flight occurred on 24 April 2018.

The Dash 8-100, Dash 8-200 and Dash 8-300 can operate on the many short runway airports in Norway, on which Widerøe is the main operator. Widerøe was the launch customer of Dash 8-100 extended service program. The program extends the economic life of the turboprop by 100% to 160,000 flight cycles. Widerøe plans to replace most of its Dash-8 aircraft by 2030.

==Incidents and accidents==
* On 5 March 1964, a Douglas DC-3 caught fire before takeoff at Oslo Airport, Fornebu. All 18 occupants survived, but the aircraft was written off.
* On 28 March 1968, an Otter seaplane crashed at Rossfjordstraumen. There were no fatalities, but the aircraft was written off.
* On 11 March 1982, Widerøe Flight 933, operated by a Twin Otter registered LN-BNK, crashed into the Barents Sea near Gamvik, en route from Berlevåg Airport to Mehamn Airport. All investigations have concluded that the crash resulted from the structural failure of the aircraft&#x27;s tail caused by severe clear-air turbulence. However, there has been significant controversy surrounding this, as claims have been made that the aircraft collided with a Harrier jump jet of the British Royal Air Force flying outside its designated operations area during a NATO exercise.
* On 6 May 1988, Widerøe Flight 710, operated by a Dash 7, crashed near Brønnøysund, killing all 36 passengers on board in the worst-ever Dash 7 accident. The accident occurred when the aircraft, on approach from Namsos Airport, descended from 1500 ft to 550 ft too early in the landing procedure, colliding with the mountain Torghatten.
* On 12 April 1990, Widerøe Flight 839, operated by a Twin Otter, crashed into the sea one minute after take-off from Værøy Airport, killing all five on board. The crash was caused by strong and unpredictable wind gusts during take-off, which had exceeded the aircraft&#x27;s structural limits and created a break-up of its rudder, rendering it uncontrollable. The airport was closed down after the accident and replaced by Værøy Heliport.
* On 27 October 1993, Widerøe Flight 744, operated by a Twin Otter, crashed while approaching Namsos Airport, Høknesøra en route from Trondheim Airport, Værnes, killing the crew and 4 passengers. Having descended from , the aircraft was supposed to stabilize at an altitude of but instead continued to descend, until it crashed into a ridge from the airport.
* On 14 June 2001, the starboard main undercarriage of a Dash 8-100 aircraft collapsed on landing at Båtsfjord Airport after a flight from Alta Airport, resulting in substantial damage to the aircraft. No injuries were reported to the three crew and 24 passengers on board. The aircraft, LN-WIS, was written off.
* On 1 May 2005, a Dash 8-100 registered LN-WIK made a hard landing at Hammerfest Airport. Just before landing the wind speed veered and increased, creating a tailwind. The increase in the descent rate was compensated but was insufficient, and the aircraft touched down on the right main landing gear, with the leg failing and the aircraft sliding on its belly. The aircraft was written off and Widerøe was criticized for permitting landings under high winds and gusts. The Norwegian Civil Aviation Authority imposed stricter wind regulations on the airport.
* On 15 September 2010, Dash 8-100 LN-WIF made an emergency landing at Sandnessjøen Airport, Stokka. Just before landing, the aircraft was hit by a strong gust of wind and the starboard landing gear collapsed upon landing. There were 3 passengers and 4 crew aboard, all were evacuated safely.
* On 7 December 2017, Dash 8-100 LN-WID crashed into a towing truck during a storm at Bodø Airport. Just after landing, the aircraft requested a towing truck to tow them to the gate due to heavy wind and slippery surface. The truck was taken by the wind and hit the propeller. There were no injuries amongst the passengers and crew.

<text>Norwegian Air Shuttle [[Aksjeselskap|ASA]], trading as Norwegian, is a Norwegian low-cost airline and Scandinavia&#x27;s second-largest airline, behind Scandinavian Airlines. It is the fourth largest low-cost carrier in Europe behind Wizz Air, easyJet and Ryanair, the largest airline in Norway, and the ninth-largest airline in Europe in terms of passenger numbers. It offers a high-frequency domestic flight schedule within Scandinavia and Finland, and to business destinations such as London, as well as to holiday destinations in the Mediterranean and the Canary Islands, transporting over 30 million people in 2016. The airline is known for its distinctive livery of white with a red nose, with portraits of high achievers on the tail fins of its aircraft.

Norwegian&#x27;s flights are operated by itself and Norwegian Air Sweden, a fully owned subsidiary. Each airline holds a unique air operator&#x27;s certificate (AOC) but shares branding, corporate identity, and commercial functions.

Until December 2019, Norwegian also owned and operated Norwegian Air Argentina, which operated domestic flights within the country.

Until January 2021, Norwegian&#x27;s former long-haul subsidiaries Norwegian Air UK and Norwegian Long Haul operated long-haul flights on behalf of the company, after which both subsidiaries were put into liquidation when long-haul operations were ended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Until April 2021, Norwegian utilised Ireland-based Norwegian Air International for European-based operations outside of Norway or Sweden.

On 18 December 2023, Norwegian Air Norway returned its sole aircraft to parent Norwegian Air Shuttle.

==History==
=== 1993–2001: Beginnings as a regional airline ===
Norwegian Air Shuttle (NAS) was founded on 22 January 1993 to take over the regional airline services produced by Busy Bee for Braathens in Western Norway. Busy Bee, founded in 1966, was a subsidiary of Braathens that operated a fleet of Fokker 50 aircraft on charter services. This included the network of regional services between cities on the west coast of Norway operated on wet lease for the mother company. Following Busy Bee&#x27;s bankruptcy in December 1992, NAS took over three leased Fokker 50 aircraft, and started operating from Bergen Airport, Flesland to Haugesund Airport, Karmøy, as well as from Bergen to Molde Airport, Årø or Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget, and onwards to Trondheim Airport, Værnes. The company was established and owned by former Busy Bee employees and initially had a workforce of fifty. It was based in Bergen, but later established a technical base in Stavanger.

From 1 April 1994, the airline also began service from Bergen to Ålesund Airport, Vigra. In 1995, the company received its fourth Fokker 50s, and had a revenue of NOK 86.6 million and a profit of NOK 2.9 million. It flew 50 daily services.

By 1999, the company had six Fokker 50s and flew 500,000 passengers on 20,000 flights. The company had a revenue of NOK 172 million and a profit of NOK 13 million. On 2 June 2000, NAS bought the helicopter operator Lufttransport from Helikopter Service. In 2000, the NAS fleet was expanded to seven Fokker 50s. From 2 January 2001, several Braathens routes were terminated, including the NAS-operated services from Kristiansund to Trondheim and Molde. The route from Bergen to Haugesund, and Bergen–Molde–Trondheim were reduced.

=== 2002–2009: Emergence as a low-cost carrier ===
On 7 January 2002, NAS took over the route from Stavanger to Newcastle, flying two round trips per day; this was the first route on which the airline did not wet lease the aircraft to Braathens, but operated the route in its own right. After Braathens was bought by Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) in November 2001, all contracts that Norwegian had with Braathens for the routes on the Norwegian west coast were cancelled by SAS, as it wanted its subsidiary SAS Commuter to take the routes over. NAS had an 18-month cancellation period in its contract with Braathens; however, this was not respected by SAS - the contracts were terminated without notice. Following the purchase of Braathens by SAS, and the subsequent termination of its contracts, NAS announced in April 2002 that it would start domestic scheduled services as a low-cost carrier on the busiest routes. From 1 September 2002, the airline re-branded as Norwegian.

The airline opened its second hub at Warsaw Frederic Chopin Airport in Poland, flying to Central European destinations. There were two Boeing 737 operating from Warsaw. (The base was closed in 2010.) Norwegian announced on 24 April 2007 that it had bought 100% of the Swedish low-cost airline FlyNordic from Finnair plc, becoming the largest low-cost airline in Scandinavia. As payment for the shares in FlyNordic, Finnair received a 5% share stake in Norwegian.

On 30 August 2007, Norwegian ordered 42 new Boeing 737-800 aircraft, with options for 42 more, an order worth US$3.1 billion. This order was later increased by six aircraft in November 2009. In July 2010 15 of the options were converted to orders, and in June 2011 15 more options were converted, bringing the total order of new, owned 737-800s to 78 aircraft with 12 remaining options. Additionally, Norwegian introduced leased Boeing 737-800 aircraft into the fleet. The first leased 737-800 arrived at Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, Norway, on 26 January 2008.

In April 2010, Norwegian started flights from Oslo-Gardermoen and Stockholm to Helsinki-Vantaa Airport. During early 2011, Norwegian had three aircraft stationed in Helsinki, and introduced domestic flights to Oulu Airport and Rovaniemi Airport on 31 March 2011. In May, flights to nine additional international destinations began.

=== 2010–2017: Rapid expansion, and long-haul operations ===
In October 2009, Norwegian had announced that it intended to start flights from Oslo to New York City and Bangkok, for which new intercontinental aircraft were required. In 2010, it said it was considering up to 15 intercontinental destinations from Scandinavia, and would also consider services to South America and Africa. On 8 November 2010, Norwegian announced that it had contracted to lease two new Boeing 787 Dreamliners with delivery in 2012; and that it was negotiating the leasing of additional aircraft.

On 25 January 2012, Norwegian announced the largest orders of aircraft in European history. The orders consisted of 22 Boeing 737-800 and 100 Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft with options for another 100 of the latter; and for 100 Airbus A320neos with options for another 50. In late October 2012, the airline announced a new base at London Gatwick from spring 2013 with three Boeing 737-800s to be used on new international routes from London to leisure destinations in Spain, Portugal, France, Italy and Croatia. All announced routes were to be flown in competition with airlines such as British Airways, easyJet and Thomson Airways.

In 2016, Norwegian won its first charter contract in the United States, flying three Boeing 737-800s out of Chicago/Rockford International Airport and General Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee to Mexico and the Caribbean from December 2016 to April 2017 for Apple Vacations and Funjet Vacations.

By February 2017, Norwegian had expanded to the point that it became Scandinavia&#x27;s largest airline. On 20 April 2017, Norwegian announced its second long-haul destination in Asia, with flights between London&#x27;s Gatwick Airport and Singapore Changi Airport, using Boeing 787s operated by Norwegian Air UK. (These flights ended on 11 January 2019.) On 29 June 2017, Norwegian took delivery of its first Boeing 737 MAX, which featured Freddie Laker on its tailfin and was registered to Norwegian Air International. The parent company, Norwegian Air Shuttle, would later accept its first Boeing 737 MAX on 13 August 2018, the aircraft featuring Oscar Wilde on its tailfin.

=== 2018–2021: Restructuring and changes in strategy ===
To finance its aggressive growth involving the inauguration of many new routes, the hiring and training of new employees, and the accepting of aircraft deliveries, Norwegian sold some of its shares in Bank Norwegian in June and December 2017, and participated in the sale and leaseback of its owned aircraft.

Norwegian changed its strategy from growth to profitability in 2018, and in January 2019, the airline announced restructuring measures consisting of the closure of several crew bases mostly for its Boeing 737 operations outside Norway, as well as a possible revision of its aircraft order books, including the cancellation of nearly its entire Airbus A320neo family order. On 12 March 2019, the group grounded all of its Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, on the advice of the EASA, after the Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air crashes. On 11 July 2019, the company&#x27;s founder and CEO Bjørn Kjos stepped down as CEO. Kjos explained his decision by citing his age and the company&#x27;s growing need for fresh leadership. Chief Financial Officer Geir Karlsen stepped in as interim CEO. In the past year of restructuring, Norwegian&#x27;s stock price dropped more than 85% from the previous year, largely blamed on the Boeing 737 MAX groundings. In an effort to delay its bond repayment of $380 million by two years, Norwegian offered its slots at Gatwick for collateral. Jacob Schram, a former gas executive, was named Kjos&#x27; replacement as CEO on 20 November 2019 and joined the company in January 2020.

==== 2020: COVID-19 pandemic and seeking of government aid ====
In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted Norwegian&#x27;s finances and operations, and its value on the open market dropped nearly 80% in the weeks leading up to Black Thursday. On 16 March 2020, the airline announced it was cancelling 85% of its flights and laying off 7,300 workers. On 20 April 2020, the airline reported the bankruptcy of various staffing subsidiaries and the termination of agreements with OSM Aviation, each of which were responsible for staffing the airline&#x27;s flights from its crew bases outside of Norway, France, and Italy, affecting 4,700 workers.

On 27 April 2020, Norwegian outlined its plans to qualify for a governmental loan from the Norwegian state, including the conversion of its debt and leasing commitments to equity, its intention to reduce its active fleet to seven Boeing 737-800 aircraft operating solely on domestic routes within Norway, and to postpone operations outside of Norway (including to the rest of Europe and intercontinental long-haul flights) until March 2021. The airline presented these plans as creating a &quot;New Norwegian&quot;, further planning to reinstate additional aircraft and operations as demand would allow, and to ultimately operate between 110 and 120 aircraft, down from the 160+ aircraft it operated before the crisis. Shares in the airline continued to decrease in value in anticipation of the airline converting its debt to equity, which occurred on 20 May 2020, resulting in companies leasing aircraft to the airline (including AerCap and BOC Aviation) becoming the airline&#x27;s largest shareholders.

On 17 June 2020, Norwegian began adding additional flights for the month of July from Norway to Denmark and Sweden, as well as from Scandinavia to other European countries including Italy, Portugal, Spain, and the UK among others as demand recovered and countries reopened. On 29 June 2020, the airline announced it had cancelled all of its remaining orders from Boeing, consisting of 92 Boeing 737 MAXs, five Boeing 787s, and service agreements related to both aircraft types.

After receiving aid from the Norwegian government, Norwegian had also sought a credit guarantee for a loan through the Swedish government, which the government described as being eligible for airlines with a Swedish operating permit and its main operations or headquarters in Sweden through the start of 2020. The Swedish government had allocated a total of 5 billion SEK in credit guarantees for potential candidate airlines, intending the candidates to be financially viable and essential to the Swedish aviation infrastructure, and noted that it had allocated 1.5 billion SEK to Scandinavian Airlines, which is headquartered in Sweden. While Norwegian through itself and its subsidiary Norwegian Air Sweden collectively had a Swedish air operator&#x27;s certificate (and through it, aircraft registered on the Swedish registry), as well as operations based in Sweden, the airline&#x27;s application for a credit guarantee was denied by the Swedish government in August 2020; the government claiming that the airline had not been financially viable as of 31 December 2019, before the pandemic. Also in August 2020, Norwegian warned that the company would run out of cash by the first quarter of 2021 if it had not received further funding. In November 2020, the Norwegian government stated it would not extend further government aid to the airline, amidst fears the airline would use the funding to grow its operations that were based outside of Norway. On 18 November 2020, Norwegian sought for bankruptcy protection in Ireland, where most of its remaining fleet was held, in an attempt to restructure the organization which was expected to last five months. During part of this period, Norwegian once again reduced its network to mostly domestic operations within Norway with an active fleet of eight Boeing 737-800s.

==== 2021: Reduction of fleet and closure of long-haul operations ====
In 2021, restructuring continued in order to formulate a sustainable business plan that would allow the airline to both receive further governmental aid and investment from private enterprise. In January 2021, Norwegian and its subsidiaries began to reduce their fleets by returning several aircraft, including long-haul Boeing 787s, to their respective lessors. On 14 January 2021, Norwegian announced the end of all long-haul services to focus on a reduced European route network. On 24 February 2021, Norwegian announced that it had cancelled orders for 53 Airbus A320neos and 30 Airbus A321LRs. On 4 March 2021, CFO Geir Karlsen confirmed that the airline&#x27;s Boeing 737 MAX operations would not resume and that the airline had sought to sell its 737 MAX fleet. On 11 March 2021, the Irish high court approved Norwegian&#x27;s termination of a further 25 aircraft leases, and on 26 March 2021, approved its restructuring plan as part of its bankruptcy protection procedures. This was followed by the high court in Norway approving the restructuring plan on 10 April 2021.

To further simplify and streamline its operations, Norwegian retired its Irish AOC held by Norwegian Air International, and began the process of reregistering NAI&#x27;s remaining Irish-registered fleet to Norway and the transferral of its EU-based flight and base operations to Norwegian Air Sweden in mid April 2021. Norwegian&#x27;s plans also included the operation of 50 Boeing 737-800s during 2021 in order to operate a single fleet type, to later increase to 68 aircraft in 2022, consisting of 40 based in Norway and the remaining 28 to be based elsewhere in Europe. Despite previously stating that its Boeing 737 MAX operations would not resume and that its Airbus A320neo family orders were cancelled, its plans acknowledged the possible returns of the 737 MAX and A320neo.

In April 2021, Norwegian announced plans to lay off 85 percent of its staff based in Spain due to the closure of all Spanish bases formerly operated by the defunct Norwegian Air International, except Alicante and Málaga which would be kept by Norwegian Air Sweden. In May 2021, Norwegian exited bankruptcy protection and its Irish examinership with the completion of its restructuring, following no objections from either of the high courts based in Ireland and Norway. 

===2021–present: Post-restructuring===
Following Norwegian&#x27;s emergence from bankruptcy protection and restructuring, the airline&#x27;s board of directors fired CEO Jacob Schram, promoting CFO Geir Karlsen to CEO. During restructuring, two new operating subsidiaries, each with its own AOC, had been established: Norwegian Air Shuttle AOC AS and Norwegian Air Sweden AOC AB. This was followed by the transfer of the fleet to the new certificates. The operation of flights under the two AOCs began on 31 October 2021, using their respective ICAO airline designator codes (NOZ and NSZ) and callsigns (NORSEMAN and NORLIGHT), retiring the previous NAX/NSW codes and NOR SHUTTLE/NORDIC callsigns. Also by the end of the month, the airline agreed to lease an additional 13 Boeing 737-800s to be delivered in time for the 2022 summer season. On 1 December 2021, the airline announced it would resume the operation of the Boeing 737 MAX 8, with two aircraft starting in 2022, after previously retiring all of its aircraft of the type during restructuring. The airline ordered a further ten Boeing 737 MAX 8s in February 2022. In March 2022, Norwegian Air Shuttle changed its operating callsign from NORSEMAN to NORDIC (previously FlyNordic&#x27;s and later Norwegian Air Sweden&#x27;s original callsign), and Norwegian Air Sweden changed its callsign from NORLIGHT to REDNOSE (previously Norwegian Air UK&#x27;s callsign). In May 2022 the airline announced plans to purchase 50 Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft.

In 2023, Norwegian announced its intent to acquire Widerøe, the largest regional carrier in Norway, for (roughly ). In December, the NCA greenlighted the purchase. The acquisition was completed in January 2024.

==Corporate affairs==
===Ownership and structure===
Shares of the parent company, Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA, are listed on &quot;Oslo Børs&quot; (Oslo Stock Exchange) with the ticker symbol and are included in the benchmark index OBX, composed of the 25 most liquid shares on the &quot;Børs&quot;. Before the May 2020 recapitalization, the largest shareholder was HBK Holding AS (4.64% of shares as of 3 April 2020), whose majority owner is Bjørn Kjos, founder of the company. After the emission of new shares to its previous creditors, its largest owners were AerCap (15.9% of the capital) and BOC Aviation (12.7%).

The Norwegian Group consists of the parent company and its directly or indirectly owned subsidiaries in Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The parent company also owns 100% of the telephone company Call Norwegian AS, and 99.9% of NAS Asset Management, which owns the 737-800 aircraft purchased from Boeing. Norwegian is also a member of Airlines for Europe.

===Business trends===
The key trends for the Norwegian Group over recent years are shown below (as at year ending 31 December):

===Management===
The company is headed by CEO Geir Karlsen, Marty St. George as COO, and the board of directors is chaired by Niels Smedegaard. Bjørn Kjos, the company&#x27;s founder and previously its largest shareholder, stepped down as CEO on 11 July 2019, but continued to act as an adviser. Kjos was subsequently replaced by Karlsen as acting CEO for six months, before the company appointed Jacob Schram as its CEO, who served from January 2020 until June 2021.

===Air operator&#x27;s certificates===
Norwegian Air Shuttle and its integrated subsidiaries, which together form Norwegian Group, each hold their own air operator&#x27;s certificate (AOC). Over the airline group&#x27;s history, it has collectively held multiple AOCs in various countries for the operation of its flights, beginning with the acquisition of Swedish airline FlyNordic in 2008, and later setting up subsidiary airlines in Ireland, the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Argentina in order to access traffic rights and freedoms in countries beyond Norway. By 2021, the airline group had since reduced its AOCs to certificates registered in Norway and Sweden, held by Norwegian Air Shuttle and Norwegian Air Sweden respectively.

===Head office===

The company&#x27;s head office is in Diamanten, an office building at Fornebu, Bærum outside Oslo. Previously, the airline had its head office functions inside other buildings in Fornebu, but in 2010 moved to Diamanten, which had been the former Braathens, and later SAS Norway, head office.

===Philanthropy===
Since 2007, Norwegian has been a signature partner with UNICEF Norway and has operated four aid flights to various war-torn countries in the world. These are flights for which the company, its employees and passengers contribute money to fill an aircraft with aid and deliver the aid to the country in need. Passengers can contribute when they purchase tickets, food and drinks, or through the entertainment system on board. Initially, the airline used one of its Boeing 737-300 or Boeing 737-800 aircraft in a special UNICEF livery, but in 2017, for the first time the airline used a Boeing 787-9, in its mission to Yemen. In 2018, the airline cooperated with MegaDo and Insideflyer, auctioning off seats for these special flights with all proceeds donated to UNICEF.

Norwegian and UNICEF have conducted five humanitarian aid missions since 2014 to the Central African Republic, to Syrian refugees in Jordan, to Mali, Yemen and Chad. The partners claim that together they have delivered emergency aid that has saved more than 100,000 children&#x27;s lives.

==Destinations==
Norwegian Air Shuttle serves destinations throughout Europe and North Africa for both business and leisure markets. Combined with its integrated subsidiaries that operate additional short-haul flights, the airline flies to 104 destinations as of January 2021.

Domestic, intra-Nordic and typical European business and leisure destinations have the most flights. The busiest routes in Norwegian&#x27;s network are the Oslo to Bergen and the Oslo to Trondheim routes with 15 daily round-trips. Norwegian&#x27;s largest non-Scandinavian operation is to London Gatwick with up to 24 daily round-trips. Intra-Scandinavian routes, and in particular on &quot;the capital triangle&quot; between Oslo, Stockholm and Copenhagen, are attractive due to extensive traffic for both business and leisure travellers. Other modes of transportation between these cities are generally slow.

=== Long-haul operations ===

Following Norwegian&#x27;s announcement in 2009 that it would enter the long-haul market, Norwegian subsequently launched long-haul flights on 30 May 2013, which initially consisted of flights from Oslo and Stockholm to Bangkok and New York City. The flights, which were operated by a new subsidiary Norwegian Long Haul, originally launched with wet-leased Airbus A340-300 aircraft while the deliveries of the airline&#x27;s Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft were delayed. Over the next several years, Norwegian&#x27;s long-haul operations with its Boeing 787s expanded to other European countries in addition to Scandinavia, with its route network eventually consisting of flights to Asia and the Americas from Europe. A new subsidiary, Norwegian Air UK, was also established to operate long-haul flights at Norwegian&#x27;s London Gatwick base.

Norwegian also launched long-haul flights using Boeing 737s between Europe and North America in 2017, initially with Boeing 737-800 aircraft before it received its first of several Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. These flights were operated by Norwegian&#x27;s Irish subsidiary airline, Norwegian Air International. Long-haul operations with the Boeing 737s were ended in September 2019 following the Boeing 737 MAX groundings since March of that year, while long-haul flights with the Boeing 787s were discontinued in January 2021, following their initial suspension as an impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

== On-Time Performance ==
Norwegian Air Shuttle was Europe&#x27;s most on-time airline in October 2023. Cirium identified its on-time performance rate at 86.10%.

== Fleet ==

===Current fleet===
, Norwegian Air Shuttle, including integrated subsidiaries, operates an all-Boeing 737 fleet composed of the following aircraft:

===Historical fleet===
Norwegian and its integrated subsidiaries have previously operated the following aircraft:

=== Fleet development ===
From 1993 to 2002, the company solely operated Fokker 50 turbo-prop aircraft primarily as a commuter airline, having a total fleet of six by 2002. The company ceased all Fokker 50 operations at the end of 2003 to focus on Boeing 737-300 jet operations. For a limited period in the early years of the 737 operations, Norwegian operated a Boeing 737-500 as an interim solution while waiting for 737-300 deliveries. Following the acquisition of Swedish low-cost airline FlyNordic in 2007, Norwegian inherited eight McDonnell Douglas MD-80 series aircraft. The last of the MD-80 aircraft was phased out two years later.

=== Livery ===
Norwegian&#x27;s aircraft livery is white with a signal red nose and a dark blue stripe, the same colours as the flag of Norway. The vertical stabilizer or tailfin is painted with a red tip and a dark blue stripe underneath containing the airline&#x27;s website, with the rest of the talfin either blank white, or featuring depictions of historically significant individuals from across Europe and the Americas. Special liveries featured on Norwegian&#x27;s aircraft include or previously included promotional liveries for the insurance company Silver, Norwegian&#x27;s partnership with UNICEF, Network Norway, and the airline&#x27;s frequent-flyer program Norwegian Reward.

==Services==

Norwegian&#x27;s Boeing 737s are configured in an all-economy class layout consisting of 186 or 189 seats in a 3–3 configuration. The airline offers in-flight entertainment by overhead screens, video on demand streamable to personal devices, and WiFi Internet access. When the airline previously operated widebody Boeing 787 aircraft through its integrated subsidiaries, it offered premium economy class seating and services. As a low-cost airline, Norwegian charges additional fees for on-board food and drinks, checked baggage, payment by credit card and other non-core services.

===Frequent-flyer program===
The airline runs a frequent flyer program called Norwegian Reward. Passengers can earn points based on the price of the ticket and the ticket class. Norwegian supported the ban on point accrual that was in force on domestic flights in Norway until 16 May 2013, but when that ban was lifted, the reward programs were extended to that market as well.

==Concerns and conflicts==
===Customer services===
It was reported in 2014 that Norwegian Air customers had lodged a record number of complaints, with a tribunal judge stating to &quot;Dagens Næringsliv&quot;, &quot;We have never before seen this scope of complaints in a single case&quot;. Norwegian&#x27;s policies were also criticized by passengers who were left without food, drinks and blankets on board for up to 12 hours (available for pay but only with credit card). In August 2014, 35,000 people were reportedly hit with delays when flying with Norwegian, and 1,200 passengers ultimately sued Norwegian for compensation. However, for the most part, the tribunal did not agree with the complaints and only in a few cases did Norwegian have to compensate the passenger(s).

===Labour relations===
Between 2011 and 2013, Norwegian Air Shuttle (NAS) was criticized regarding its treatment of employees.

The media first reported NAS&#x27;s announced intention to open a base in Helsinki, from where it hired pilots on short-term contracts in Estonia rather than as employees within the company. The Norwegian tax-office authorities reportedly suspected in August 2012 that many Norwegian citizens were working for NAS on these contracts and not paying Norwegian taxes, despite operating on flights originating from Norway. The Norwegian Pilot&#x27;s Union (NPU) took NAS to court over the short-term contracts. Then-CEO Bjørn Kjos appeared to inflame matters when he declared that NAS would no longer hire employees on Norwegian terms.

In 2012, NAS started to use contract-employed pilots on routes within Scandinavia, considered by the NPU to be an abrogation of labor terms regarding non-Scandinavian pilots on routes within Scandinavia. The NPU soon after sued NAS.

In October 2013, the NPU announced its intention to strike because NAS had forced its pilots to face dismissal or transfer to Norwegian Air Norway or Norwegian Air Resources AB, both subsidiaries of NAS; the respective subsidiary would then hire the pilots back to NAS. The NPU and its Swedish counterpart SPF accused NAS of using this ploy to break the solidarity and organisation of the pilots, with the eventual goal of coercing pilots to convert their jobs to contract positions.

In mid December 2013, NAS demanded that its Swedish non-contract flight attendants transfer to Proffice Aviation, an external staffing company, or face dismissal. According to the Swedish cabin-crew union, Unionen, it managed to save the jobs of 53 NAS employees, but it was dissatisfied with the direction NAS had taken. The situation led to the leader for the Swedish Left Party, Jonas Sjöstedt, to state that stricter regulation was needed for the use of staffing-companies in Sweden.

===Norwegian Long Haul===
Norwegian Long Haul was criticized for the terms of its contracts with its long-haul flight attendants on contracts based in Thailand. The Air Line Pilots Association further accused Norwegian of unfair competition practices. The airline contested these accusations, and disclosed the pay scale for its Thai employees, who earn between $33,300 and US$39,200 per annum, which is under the $42.2K USD average pay for US flight attendants (though these comparisons are made between solely intercontinental Norwegian Long Haul flights versus domestic and intercontinental flights of US-paid flight attendants).

==Accidents and incidents==
*A Norwegian Boeing 737 MAX suffered an unspecified technical failure over Iran on 14 December 2018. The pilot made a precautionary landing at Shiraz Shahid Dastgheib International Airport without incident. Spare parts required to make the aircraft airworthy were not available outside the United States, which had prohibited exports of technology to Iran. Two months later, the almost-brand-new aircraft was still stranded in Shiraz and subject to seizure by the Iranian government. On 22 February 2019, the aircraft flew from Shiraz to Stockholm after it had been stranded for 70 days.

<text>The T-35 was a Soviet multi-turreted heavy tank of the interwar period and early Second World War that saw limited service with the Red Army. Often called a land battleship, it was the only five-turreted heavy tank in the world to reach production, but proved to be slow and mechanically unreliable. Most of the T-35 tanks still operational at the time of Operation Barbarossa were lost due to mechanical failure rather than enemy action. It was designed to complement the contemporary T-28 medium tank; however, very few were built.

Outwardly, it was large; but internally, the spaces were cramped with the fighting compartments separated from each other. Some of the turrets obscured the entrance hatches.

== Production history ==
The T-35 was developed by the OKMO design bureau of the Bolshevik Factory, which began work on a heavy tank in 1930. Two teams developed separate designs. The team headed by German engineer Grotte worked on the 100-ton four-turreted TG-5 tank, armed with a 107 mm naval gun, using pneumatic servo-controls and pneumatic suspension. This project was later cancelled.

The concept of large, multi-turreted breakthrough tanks was favoured by several European armies in the 1920s and 1930s. Designs existed in Britain, France, and Germany for such vehicles. The second OKMO team, headed by N. Tsiets, worked on a tank similar to the British Vickers A1E1 Independent.

By July 1932, a prototype of a 35-ton tank with a 76.2 mm tank gun was completed. The first prototype was further enhanced with four smaller turrets, two with 37 mm guns and two with machine guns. This first prototype had severe defects in its transmission and was considered too complex and expensive for mass production. Work on it was therefore stopped and a new simpler prototype was built.

This new prototype received a new engine, new gearbox and improved transmission. The decision was also made to standardise the turrets used on the T-35 with those employed on the T-28, a triple-turreted medium tank. The small machine-gun turrets were identical on the two tanks. The large main turret housing the 76.2 mm gun was nearly identical, but those used on the T-28 had an additional, rear-firing machine gun.

On 11 August 1933, the T-35 was accepted for production. Engineering was shifted to the Kharkov Locomotive Factory, and two batches of ten vehicles were completed.

The experiences gained with the two prototypes were used for the main production T-35, which was again improved from the second prototype, with eight-wheel suspension, improved hull and 45-mm guns in place of the 37s. It started production in 1934, and 59 (including ones with conical turrets) were built by 1939. In general, throughout its production run small improvements were made to the individual tanks. Production tanks had medium turrets similar to the ones on the BT-5, but without the rear overhang. The final batch was a run of ten T-35 that had new turrets with sloped armour all around, as well as modified side skirts with suspension service hatches and new driver&#x27;s hatch. Four of them had original fully vertical pedestal for the main turret, while the latter six had sloped pedestal.

Originally, the main turret was equipped with a 76.2 mm KT-28 cannon (length of barrel 16.5 calibers), which was also used on the Т-28 medium tank. The mounting allowed for vertical training (aiming) with upper and lower limits of −7° and +23°, respectively. As an auxiliary weapon in the main turret, to the right of the cannon, the 7.62 mm DT machine gun was placed autonomously in a ball setting. The cannon and machine gun had complete 360° horizontal arc of fire and independent fire control systems. The spare DT machine gun was fastened in a loop setting in the storage niche of the turret. The mechanism to turn the turret employed an electromechanical three-speed drive; an auxiliary hand drive was also provided for emergency use. By 1937, an anti-aircraft DT machine gun was set in a P-40 mount on the foundation of the gunner&#x27;s hatch on the main turret.
In 1938, the L-10 tank cannon was proposed for the main turret weapon, but the representatives of the ABTU (the &quot;Auto-Tank Directorate&quot;) abandoned this idea, considering the power of the KT-28 enough for the purpose of defeating enemy armored vehicles, and the accompaniment of attacking infantry was provided for by the two 45-mm cannons.

In each of the two diagonally-mounted (i.e., one in the right forward quarter and another in the diagonally-opposite left rear quarter, as viewed from behind) two-seater turrets was placed one 45 mm tank cannon obr.1932 and a coaxially-mounted 7.62 mm DT machine gun. Later, this cannon was replaced with a 45 mm gun of the 20k Model 1934 with a semi-automatic breech-block. The coupled setting had vertical training (aiming) limits of −8° to +23°. The front turret weapon had a horizontal field of fire from 19° (left of the turret&#x27;s centerline) to −184° (rearwards). The two smaller turrets were single-seat and had one 7.62 mm DT machine gun apiece. The horizontal training (aiming) of these weapons was carried out through the turning of a hand mechanism.

The main and the two small machine gun turrets of the Т-35 and Т-28 had a high level of standardization. Main-weapon sighting utilized the telescopic breech-sight TOP obr.1930 and the periscope breech-sight PT-1 обр.1932. The 76.2 mm cannon had 96 rounds, the 45 mm guns had 226 rounds, and the DT machine guns had 10,080 cartridges. The 50-ton tank was designed with the maximum thickness of the body&#x27;s armoured plates being 30 mm and that of the turret 20 mm. The armoured plates were coupled together by welding and riveting. In 1936, the thickness of the frontal, sloping body plate and the front plate protecting the driver-mechanic was increased to 50 mm. Armored side skirts also added 10 mm to the side armor covering the tracks.

In 1938, a conical turret with a maximum thickness of 25 mm (at the front) for strengthening the armoured defence of the tank was introduced; the thickness of the frontal armoured plates was also increased, to 70 mm. The battle weight of the machine grew to 54 tons (the first-series machines weighed 42.5 tons). Overall, from October 1938 to the end of Т-35 production, ten machines with the increased armoured defence were produced. On two of the machines of the 1938 issue, a 7.62-mm DT machine gun was mounted in the storage portion of the main conical turret back, for rear defence, while the other six had plain rear plate.

Western and Russian historians disagree about the inspiration for the T-35&#x27;s design. The former argue that it was inspired by the British Vickers A1E1 Independent tank, but this is rejected by many Russian specialists. It is impossible to know the truth, but there is strong evidence to support Western claims, not least the failed Soviet attempts to purchase the A1E1. At the same time, the influence of German engineers, who in the late 1920s were developing similar designs at their Kama base in the Soviet Union, cannot be discounted. What is clear is that borrowing military technology and ideas from other nations was common to the majority of the armed forces in the inter-war years. The Red Army, with its purchase of the British Vickers Carden Loyd tankette, Vickers E-Light and Cruiser Mk II Medium tanks, and of the American Christie suspension for production use in its own vehicles, was clearly one of the leading exponents of this practice.

Due to its high cost, the production run of the T-35 ended at just 61 tanks (including two prototypes).

The T-35 prototypes had a crew of 9 (commander, gunner and loader of the 76 mm turret, two gunners of the 37 mm turrets, two gunners of the machine gun turrets, the driver and his assistant) with two mechanics &quot;attached&quot; to a particular tank, but not participating in battles, thus making the official crew number 11. The serial tanks had a crew of 10 (commander, gunner and loader of the 76 mm turret, two gunners and loaders of the 45 mm turrets, two gunners of the machine gun turrets and the driver), still with two attached mechanics, making the total crew 12.

== Combat history ==

The T-35 served with the 5th Separate Heavy Tank Brigade in Moscow, primarily for parade duties, from 1935 until 1940. In June 1940, the question was raised as to whether to withdraw the T-35s from frontline service, with the option to either convert them to heavy self-propelled artillery, or to assign them to the various military academies. The choice was made to use them up in combat instead and the surviving vehicles were collected together into the 67th and 68th Tank Regiments of the 34th Tank Division, which served with the 8th Mechanized Corps in the Kiev Special Military District.

The first known combat engagement of the T-35 tank took place sometime at the end of June 1941, in the broader fighting in the Lviv area known as the Battle of Brody. T-35 tanks belonging to the 34th Tank Division and trailing their unit lead elements due to poor tactical mobility, encountered advancing German armor on the unpaved road between the towns of Verba and Ptycha. The battle is documented only on photographs taken in the aftermath, and shows seven destroyed Soviet tanks including four T-35s (two of these vehicles having suffered catastrophic ammunition explosions) and three German tanks destroyed. The T-35 wrecks show evidence of hits by 37 mm cannon fire and the vehicles could have been engaged by towed German 8.8 cm Flak guns brought in to deal with heavily armored Soviet KV tanks also active in this sector. A Soviet report from the period identifies four T-35s lost on 30 June in this area with the loss of 15 crew.

On 1 June 1941, the Red Army possessed only 58 vehicles of this type, of those 48 were in combat ready condition. During Operation Barbarossa, the majority of the T-35s lost by the 67th and 68th Tank Regiments were lost not to enemy action but through either mechanical failure or immobilization, which resulted in these vehicles being abandoned and destroyed by their crews. The most common causes of breakdown were transmission-related; however, the T-35 proved to have a greater automotive reliability than both the T-34 and KV tanks deployed at the time, with most of the failures arising from running the tanks beyond their normal service intervals, very little in the way of field repair or vehicle workshops and almost no spare parts support. Some T-35s involved in the long marches, delaying actions and retreat which characterized the beginning of the campaign, saw well over 500 km driven on unpaved roads and even off-road, before experiencing any significant failure.

The last recorded action of the T-35 took place during the First Battle of Kharkov, where four tanks undergoing repairs at their home factory (renamed Factory No. 183) were made roadworthy, re-armed and hastily pressed into service in the defense of the city. At least one captured T-35 was shipped to Germany for evaluation at the Kummersdorf military proving ground. This tank (serial number 715-62) was meticulously inspected and showed widely divergent armor thickness values used in its construction, likely the result of poor quality control of armor plate supplied by the steel mills. In April 1945, this tank, now stripped of most of its armament and immobile, was assigned to Panzer Brigade 150 and towed into the town of Zossen where it was used as a fixed fortification and barricade.

The T-35 is sometimes cited as having participated in the Winter War against Finland, but according to Soviet sources it did not. In fact, two other prototypes of multi-turreted heavy tanks had been sent to the front for testing: the T-100 and SMK. Single turret KV-1s also took part in the same test at the Battle of Summa. The SMK tank was disabled by a Finnish land mine and all attempts to recover the 55-ton behemoth failed. Finnish photographs of the previously unknown tank were mistakenly designated &quot;T-35C&quot; by German intelligence.

==Survivors==

One tank survives and is preserved in running condition at the Patriot Park near Moscow. It was one of four T-35 machines that were used at training facilities in the Soviet rear. The Kubinka collection also includes a prototype SU-14, a self-propelled gun based on the T-35 chassis.

In January 2016 the Russian metallurgical company Ural Mining and Metallurgical Company (UMMC) announced the re-creation of a complete replica T-35 tank using Soviet drawings. The tank is to be placed in the Museum of Military Equipment of the UMMC.

<doc id="198554" wikidata="Q399500" url="?curid=198554" title="Agustín de Iturbide y Green">
<text>Agustín de Iturbide y Green (2 April 1863 – 3 March 1925) was the grandson of Agustín de Iturbide, the first emperor of independent Mexico, and his consort Ana María Huarte.

In April 1864, Maximilian I of Mexico renounced all his incidental Austrian succession rights and later adopted Agustín de Iturbide y Green and Salvador de Iturbide y Marzán, two grandsons of Emperor Agustín I whom he appointed Prince of Iturbide and at the same time heir apparent. Iturbide&#x27;s claim passed to Maria Josepha Sophia de Iturbide, the daughter of his cousin, Salvador.

==Family==
Iturbide was the son of Emperor Agustin&#x27;s second son, Prince Don Ángel María de Iturbide y Huarte (2 October 1816 – 21 July 1872). His mother was Alice Green (–1892), daughter of Captain John Nathaniel Green, granddaughter of United States congressman and Revolutionary War General Uriah Forrest, and great-granddaughter of George Plater, Governor of Maryland.

==Possible Mexican royal heir==

When Maximilian and Carlota ascended the throne of Mexico in 1863 with the support of the French troops of Napoleon III, the childless new monarchs invited the Iturbide family back to Mexico. As it was clear several years into their marriage that Maximilian and Carlota could have no children together, they offered to adopt Iturbide, which was agreed to with enthusiasm by his father and reluctance by his mother. Iturbide and his cousin were granted the &quot;vitalicio&quot; (meaning non-hereditary) title of &quot;Prince de Iturbide&quot; and style of &quot;Highness&quot; by imperial decree of 16 September 1865 and were ranked after the reigning family. Apparently, the royal couple intended to groom Agustín as heir to the throne. Maximilian never really intended to give the crown to the Iturbides because he believed that they were not of royal blood. It was all a charade directed at his younger brother Archduke Karl Ludwig of Austria, as Maximilian explained himself: either Karl would give him one of his sons as an heir, or else he would bequeath everything to the Iturbide children.

==Post-monarchy==
With the overthrow of the second Mexican Empire in 1867, Iturbide&#x27;s biological parents took him first to England and then back to the United States, where they settled in Washington, DC. When he came of age, Iturbide, who had graduated from Georgetown University, renounced his claim to the throne and title and returned to Mexico. He then served as an officer in the Mexican army. But in 1890, after publishing articles critical of President Porfirio Díaz, he was arrested on charges of sedition and sentenced to fourteen months of imprisonment. After release from prison, Iturbide was sent into exile, where he had two severe nervous breakdowns that resulted in his believing that he would be assassinated. Eventually, he returned to Georgetown University, as a professor of the Spanish and French languages.

For some years before his marriage, Iturbide lived at a monastery near Washington, DC, where he worked as a translator.

==Marriage==
In 1894, he married Lucy Eleanor Jackson (1 January 1862 – 11 May 1940), daughter of the Rev. William Jackson, by his wife Lucy Catherine Hatchett, of Yealmpton, Devon, United Kingdom. She died in Epsom, Surrey, United Kingdom.

On 5 July 1915, he married Mary Louise Kearney (25 September 1872 – September 1967), a D.C.-born granddaughter of Brigadier General James Kearney of the United States Army.

==Death==
Agustín de Iturbide y Green died on 3 March 1925 in Washington, D.C. after following a serious nervous and physical breakdown. He was buried at the Church of St John the Evangelist, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania — alongside his paternal grandmother, Empress Ana María of Mexico.

==In popular culture==
Mickey Kuhn portrayed De Iturbide y Green in &quot;Juarez&quot; (1939).

<doc id="198558" wikidata="Q1468648" url="?curid=198558" title="Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)">
<text>Georgetown is a historic neighborhood and commercial district in Northwest Washington, D.C., situated along the Potomac River. Founded in 1751 as part of the colonial-era Province of Maryland, Georgetown predated the establishment of Washington, D.C. by 40 years. Georgetown was an independent municipality until 1871 when the United States Congress created a new consolidated government for the entire District of Columbia. A separate act, passed in 1895, repealed Georgetown&#x27;s remaining local ordinances and renamed Georgetown&#x27;s streets to conform with those in Washington, D.C.

The primary commercial corridors of Georgetown are the intersection of Wisconsin Avenue and M Street, which contain high-end shops, bars, restaurants, and Georgetown Park, an enclosed shopping mall. Washington Harbour, which includes waterfront restaurants, is located to the south on K Street between 30th and 31st Streets.

Georgetown is home to the main campus of Georgetown University and other landmarks, including the Old Stone House (1765), the oldest still standing building structure in Washington, D.C., the Volta Bureau for deaf education, the Dumbarton Oaks estate, and a historically significant stretch of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal. The embassies of Cameroon, France, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Mongolia, Sweden, Thailand, Ukraine, and Venezuela are located in Georgetown.

== History ==


Located on the Atlantic Seaboard Fall Line, Georgetown was at the head of navigation on the Potomac River, the farthest point upstream that boats coming from the Atlantic Ocean could navigate. 
===17th century===
In 1632, English fur trader Henry Fleet documented an American Indian village of the Nacotchtank people called Tohoga on the site of present-day Georgetown and established trade there. The area was then part of the Province of Maryland, an English colony.

===18th century===
In approximately 1745, George Gordon constructed a tobacco inspection house along the Potomac River on a site that was already a tobacco trading post when the inspection house was built. Warehouses, wharves, and other buildings were then constructed around the inspection house, and it quickly became a small community. Georgetown grew as thriving port, facilitating trade and shipments of goods to and from the colonial-era Province of Maryland.

In 1751, the legislature of the Province of Maryland authorized the purchase of of land from Gordon and George Beall for £280. A survey of the town was completed in February 1752. 

Georgetown was founded during the reign of King George II, and some speculate that the town was named after him. A second theory is that the town was named after its founders, George Gordon and George Beall. The Maryland Legislature issued a charter and incorporated the town in 1789. Although Georgetown was never officially made a city, it was later referred to as the &quot;City of Georgetown&quot; in several 19th-century Acts of Congress.) Robert Peter, an early area merchant in the tobacco trade, became the town&#x27;s first mayor in 1790.

John Beatty established the first church in Georgetown, a Lutheran church on High Street. Stephen Bloomer Balch established a Presbyterian church in 1784. A Catholic Church, Trinity Catholic Church, was built in 1795, along with a parish school-house. Construction of St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church began in 1797 but paused for financial reasons until 1803, and the church was finally consecrated in 1809. Banks in Georgetown included the Farmers and Mechanics Bank, which was established in 1814. Other banks included the Bank of Washington, Patriotic Bank, Bank of the Metropolis, and the Union and Central Banks of Georgetown.

Newspapers in Georgetown included the &quot;Republican Weekly Ledger&quot;, which was the first paper, started in 1790. &quot;The Sentinel&quot; was first published in 1796 by Green, English &amp; Co. Charles C. Fulton began publishing the &quot;Potomac Advocate&quot;, which was started by Thomas Turner. Other newspapers in Georgetown included the &quot;Georgetown Courier&quot; and the &quot;Federal Republican&quot;. William B. Magruder, the first postmaster, was appointed on February 16, 1790, and in 1795, a custom house was established on Water Street. General James M. Lingan served as the first collector of the port.

In the 1790s, City Tavern, the Union Tavern, and the Columbian Inn opened and were popular throughout the 19th century. Among these taverns, only the City Tavern remains today, serving as a private social club and known as City Tavern Club, located near the corner of Wisconsin Avenue and M Street.

George Washington frequented Georgetown, including Suter&#x27;s Tavern, where he negotiated many deals to acquire land for the new national capital. A key figure in the land deals was a local merchant named Benjamin Stoddert, who arrived in Georgetown in 1783. He had previously served as Secretary to the Board of War under the Articles of Confederation. Stoddert partnered with General Uriah Forrest to become an original proprietor of the Potomac Company.

Stoddert and other Potomac landowners agreed to a land transfer deal to the federal government at a dinner at Forrest&#x27;s home in Georgetown on March 28, 1791. Stoddert bought land within the boundaries of the federal district, some of it at the request of Washington for the government, and some on speculation. He also purchased stock in the federal government under Hamilton&#x27;s assumption-of-debt plan. The speculative purchases were not, however, profitable and caused Stoddert much difficulty before his appointment as Secretary of the Navy by John Adams, the nation&#x27;s second president. Stoddert was rescued from his debts with the help of William Marbury, a Georgetown resident who later was a plaintiff in the landmark case &quot;Marbury v. Madison&quot;. Stoddert ultimately purchased Halcyon House at the corner of 34th and Prospect Streets. The Forrest-Marbury House on M Street is currently the embassy of Ukraine.

===19th century===
In 1800, the federal capital was moved from the revolutionary capital of Philadelphia to Washington, D.C., and Georgetown became an independent municipal government within the District of Columbia, of which there were three: Alexandria, D.C., Georgetown, D.C., and Washington, D.C. Georgetown, D.C., was in the new Washington County, D.C.; the District&#x27;s other county was Alexandria County, D.C., now Arlington County, Virginia, and the independent city of Alexandria, Virginia.

By the 1820s, the Potomac River had become silted up and was not navigable up to Georgetown. Construction of the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Canal began in July 1828, to link Georgetown to Harper&#x27;s Ferry, Virginia in present-day West Virginia. But the canal was soon in a race with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and got to Cumberland eight years after the railroad, a faster mode of transport, and at the cost of $77,041,586. It was never profitable. From its beginning to December 1876, the canal earned $35,659,055 in revenue, while expending $35,746,301.

The canal provided an economic boost for Georgetown. In the 1820s and 1830s, Georgetown was an sizable shipping center. Tobacco and other goods were transferred between the canal and shipping on the Potomac River; salt was imported from Europe, and sugar and molasses were imported from the West Indies. These shipping industries were later superseded by coal and flour industries, which flourished with the C &amp; O Canal providing cheap power for mills and other industry. In 1862, the Washington and Georgetown Railroad Company began a horsecar line running along M Street in Georgetown and Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, easing travel between the two cities.

The municipal governments of Georgetown and the City and County of Washington were formally revoked by Congress effective June 1, 1871, at which point its governmental powers were vested within the District of Columbia. The streets in Georgetown were renamed in 1895 to conform to the street names in use in Washington.

In the 1850s, Georgetown had a large African American population, including both slaves and free blacks. Slave labor was widely used in construction of new buildings in Washington, in addition, to provide labor on tobacco plantations in Maryland and Virginia. Slave trading in Georgetown began in 1760 when John Beattie established his business on O Street and conducted business at other locations around Wisconsin Avenue. Other slave markets (&quot;pens&quot;) were located in Georgetown, including one at McCandless&#x27; Tavern near M Street and Wisconsin Avenue. Slave trading continued until 1850, when it was banned in the District as one element of the Compromise of 1850. Congress abolished ownership of slaves in the entire District on April 16, 1862, annually observed today as Emancipation Day. Many African Americans moved to Georgetown following the Civil War, establishing a thriving community.

By the late 19th century, flour milling and other industries in Georgetown were declining, in part due to the fact that the canals and other waterways continually silted up. Nathaniel Michler and S.T. Abert led efforts to dredge the channels and remove rocks around the Georgetown harbor, though these were temporary solutions and Congress showed little interest in the issue. An 1890 flood and expansion of the railroads brought destitution to the C&amp;O Canal, and Georgetown&#x27;s waterfront became more industrialized, with narrow alleys, warehouses, and apartment dwellings which lacked plumbing or electricity. Shipping trade vanished between the Civil War and World War I. As a result, many older homes were preserved relatively unchanged.

In the late 18th century and 19th century, African Americans comprised a substantial portion of Georgetown&#x27;s population, with a large number centered around Herring Hill in the far eastern section near Rock Creek Park. The 1800 census reported the population in Georgetown at 5,120, which included 1,449 slaves and 227 free blacks. A testament to the African-American history that remains today is the Mount Zion United Methodist Church, which is the oldest African-American congregation in Washington. Prior to establishing the church, free blacks and slaves went to the Dumbarton Methodist Church where they were restricted to a hot, overcrowded balcony. The church was originally located in a small brick meetinghouse on 27th Street, but it was destroyed by fire in the 1880s. The church was rebuilt on the present site. Mount Zion Cemetery offered free burials for Washington&#x27;s earlier African-American population. &quot;From a pre-Civil War population of 6,798 whites, 1,358 free Negroes, and 577 slaves, Georgetown&#x27;s population had grown to 17,300 but half these residents were poverty-stricken Negroes.&quot; Other black churches in Georgetown included Alexander Memorial Baptist Church, First Baptist Church, Jerusalem Baptist Church, and Epiphany Catholic Church.

===20th century===


In 1915, the Buffalo Bridge on present-day Q Street opened and connected this part of Georgetown with the rest of the city east of Rock Creek Park. New construction of large apartment buildings began on the edge of Georgetown. In the early 1920s, John Ihlder led efforts to take advantage of new zoning laws to get restrictions enacted on construction in Georgetown. In 1933, a study by Horace Peaslee and Allied Architects laid out ideas for how Georgetown could be preserved.

The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, then owned by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, formally ceased operations in March 1924. After severe flooding in 1936, Baltimore and Ohio Railroad sold the canal to the National Park Service in October 1938. The waterfront area retained its industrial character in the first half of the 20th century. Georgetown was home to a lumber yard, a cement works, the Washington Flour mill, and a meat rendering plant, with incinerator smokestacks and a power generating plant for the old Capital Traction streetcar system, located at the foot of Wisconsin Avenue, which closed in 1935, and was demolished in October 1968. In 1949, the city constructed the Whitehurst Freeway, an elevated highway above K Street, to allow motorists entering the District over the Key Bridge to bypass Georgetown entirely on their way downtown.

In 1950, Public Law 808 was passed, establishing the historic district of &quot;Old Georgetown&quot;. The law required that the United States Commission of Fine Arts be consulted on any alteration, demolition, or building construction within the historic district.

In 1967, the Georgetown Historic District was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.

===21st century===
Georgetown is home to many politicians and lobbyists. Georgetown&#x27;s landmark waterfront district was further revitalized in 2003, and includes a Ritz-Carlton, Four Seasons, and other hotels. Georgetown&#x27;s highly traveled commercial district is home to a variety of specialty retailers and fashionable boutiques.

==Geography==
Georgetown is bounded by the Potomac River to the south, Rock Creek to the east, Burleith, Glover Park, and Observatory Circle to the north, and Georgetown University to the west. Much of Georgetown is surrounded by parkland and green space that serve as buffers from development in adjacent neighborhoods, and provide recreation. Rock Creek Park, Oak Hill Cemetery, Montrose Park, and Dumbarton Oaks are located along the north and east edge of Georgetown, east of Wisconsin Avenue. The neighborhood is situated on bluffs overlooking the Potomac River. As a result, there are some rather steep grades on streets running north–south. The famous &quot;&quot;Exorcist&quot; steps&quot; connecting M Street to Prospect Street were necessitated by the hilly terrain of the neighborhood.

The primary commercial corridors of Georgetown are M Street and Wisconsin Avenue, whose high fashion stores draw large numbers of tourists as well as local shoppers year-round. There is also the Washington Harbour complex on K Street, on the waterfront, featuring outdoor bars and restaurants popular for viewing boat races. Between M and K Streets runs the historic Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, today plied only by tour boats; adjacent trails are popular with joggers or strollers.

== Education ==
===Primary and secondary education===

Throughout the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, the concentration of wealth in Georgetown sparked the growth of many university-preparatory schools in and around the neighborhood. One of the first schools was the Columbian Academy on N Street, which was established in 1781 with Reverend Stephen Balch serving as the headmaster.

Private schools currently located in Georgetown include Georgetown Visitation Preparatory School, while nearby is the eponymous Georgetown Day School. Georgetown Preparatory School, while founded in Georgetown, moved in 1915 to its present location several miles north of Georgetown in Montgomery County.

District of Columbia Public Schools operates area public schools, including Hyde-Addison Elementary School on O Street. Hyde-Addison formed from merging two adjacent schools - Hyde Elementary and Addison Elementary. The Addison section was renovated in 2008 and the Hyde section was renovated in Summer 2014. An addition connecting the two buildings is scheduled for completion in Summer 2019. Hardy Middle School and Jackson-Reed High School both serve Georgetown as zoned secondary schools. Duke Ellington School of the Arts, a public magnet school, is in the community.

=== Georgetown University ===
The main campus of Georgetown University is located on the western edge of the Georgetown neighborhood. Father John Carroll founded Georgetown University as a Jesuit private university in 1789, though its roots extend back to 1634. Although the school struggled financially in its early years, Georgetown expanded into a branched university after the American Civil War under the leadership of university president Patrick Francis Healy. , the university has students and students on the main campus.

The main campus is just over in area and includes 58 buildings, student residences capable of accommodating 80 percent of undergraduates, various athletic facilities, and the medical school. Most buildings employ collegiate Gothic architecture and Georgian brick architecture. Campus green areas include fountains, a cemetery, large clusters of flowers, groves of trees, and open quadrangles. The main campus has traditionally centered on Dahlgren Quadrangle, although Red Square has replaced it as the focus of student life. Healy Hall, built in Flemish Romanesque style from 1877 to 1879, is the architectural gem of Georgetown&#x27;s campus, and is a National Historic Landmark.

The 1973 film &quot;The Exorcist&quot; was partly filmed at Georgetown University and the surrounding area. The Exorcist steps, the stairway that the character Father Damien fell down, connects Prospect Street, on the edge of the campus, and M Street.

=== Public libraries ===
The District of Columbia Public Library operates the Georgetown Neighborhood Library, which originally opened at 3260 R St. NW in October 1935 on the site of the former Georgetown Reservoir. An earlier public library in Georgetown was endowed by financier George Peabody in 1867 and opened in a room of the Curtis School on O Street opposite St. John&#x27;s Church in 1875. In the early 1930s, a library committee was formed to encourage the establishment of a new public library branch in Georgetown.

The building was severely damaged by a fire on April 30, 2007, and underwent a $17.9 million renovation and expansion. The building was then re-opened on October 18, 2010, with a LEED-Silver Certification from the U.S. Green Building Council. A newly constructed, climate-controlled third floor now houses the collections of the original Peabody Library and is a center for research on Georgetown history.

== Transportation ==

Georgetown&#x27;s transportation importance was defined by its location just below the fall line of the Potomac River. The Aqueduct Bridge (and later, the Francis Scott Key Bridge) connected Georgetown with Virginia. Before the Aqueduct Bridge was built, a ferry service owned by John Mason connected Georgetown to Virginia. In 1788, a bridge was constructed over Rock Creek to connect Bridge Street (M Street) with the Federal City.

Georgetown was located at the juncture of the Alexandria Canal and the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal. The C&amp;O Canal, begun in Georgetown in 1829, reached Cumberland, Maryland in 1851, and operated until 1924. Wisconsin Avenue is on the alignment of the tobacco hogshead rolling road from rural Maryland, and the Federal Customs House was located on 31st Street (now utilized as the post office). The city&#x27;s oldest bridge, the sandstone bridge which carries Wisconsin Avenue over the C&amp;O Canal, and which dates to 1831, was reopened to traffic on May 16, 2007, after a $3.5 million restoration. It is the only remaining bridge of five constructed in Georgetown by the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Canal Company.

Several streetcar lines and interurban railways interchanged passengers in Georgetown at and near the Georgetown Car Barn, which the Capital Traction Company operated near the end of the Aqueduct Bridge and later, the Key Bridge (see Streetcars in Washington, D.C.). A station serving the Great Falls and Old Dominion Railroad and its successor, the Washington and Old Dominion Railway, was located in front of a stone wall on Canal Road adjacent to the Exorcist steps, immediately west of the Car Barn, from 1912 to 1923.

Five suburban Virginia lines, connecting in Rosslyn, provided links from the Washington, D.C. streetcar network to Arlington National Cemetery, Fort Myer, Nauck, Alexandria, Mount Vernon, Clarendon, Ballston, Falls Church, Vienna, Fairfax, Leesburg, Bluemont, and Great Falls (see Northern Virginia trolleys). Streetcar operations in Washington, D.C. ended on January 28, 1962.

In 1910, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad completed an 11-mile branch line from Silver Spring, Maryland, to Water Street in Georgetown in an abortive attempt to construct a southern connection to Alexandria, Virginia. The line served as an industrial line, shipping coal to a General Services Administration power plant on K Street (now razed) until 1985. The abandoned right-of-way has since been converted into the Capital Crescent Trail, a rails-to-trails route, and the power plant replaced by a condo.

=== Proposals for a Metro station ===
There is no Metro station in Georgetown. Some residents opposed building one but no serious plans for a station existed in the first place, primarily due to the engineering issues presented by the extremely steep grade from the Potomac River (under which the subway tunnel would run) to the center of Georgetown, very close to the river. The planners expected the Metro to serve rush-hour commuters, and the neighborhood has few apartments, office buildings, or automobile parking areas. 

Since the Metro&#x27;s opening, there have been occasional discussions about adding another subway line and tunnel under the Potomac to service the area. Three stations are located roughly one mile (1.6 km) from the center of Georgetown: Rosslyn (across the Key Bridge in Arlington), Foggy Bottom-GWU, and Dupont Circle. Georgetown is served by the 30-series, D-Series, and G2 Metrobuses, as well as the DC Circulator. Another potential option for transportation in Georgetown is scootering, with scooters provided by companies like Bird and Lime.

== Historic district and historic landmarks ==

The entire Georgetown neighborhood is a designated National Historic Landmark District, known as the Georgetown Historic District. It received this designation in 1967 for its large concentration of well-preserved colonial and Federal period architecture.

Georgetown is also home to several other historic landmarks, including:
* Canal Square Building, 1054 31st Street, NW, former home of the Tabulating Machine Company, a direct precursor of IBM
* The City Tavern Club, built in 1796, is the oldest commercial structure in Washington, D.C.
* The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, begun in 1829.
* Dumbarton Oaks, 3101 R Street, NW, former home of John C. Calhoun, U.S. vice president, where the United Nations charter was outlined in 1944.
* Evermay, built in 1801 and restored by F. Lammot Belin
* The Forrest-Marbury House, 3350 M Street, NW, where George Washington met with local landowners to acquire the District of Columbia, which is currently the Embassy of Ukraine.
* Georgetown Lutheran Church, founded in 1769, was the first church in Georgetown. The current church structure, the fourth on the site, was built in 1914.
* Georgetown Presbyterian Church was established in 1780 by Reverend Stephen Bloomer Balch. Formerly located on Bridge Street (M Street), the current church building was constructed in 1881 on P Street.
* Healy Hall on Georgetown&#x27;s campus, built in Flemish Romanesque style from 1877 to 1879 was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987.
* Mount Zion United Methodist Church and Mount Zion Cemetery
* The Oak Hill Cemetery, a gift of William Wilson Corcoran whose Gothic Revival chapel and gates were designed by James Renwick Jr., was, at one time, the resting place of Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s son Willie and other figures.
* The Old Stone House, built in 1765, located on M Street is the oldest house in Washington, D.C.
* Tudor Place and Dumbarton Court
* The Volta Laboratory and Bureau, created by Alexander Graham Bell as his first formal research laboratory, the profits from which were used to create a research and educational institution devoted to serving the deaf, which operates today as the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing, also known as the &#x27;AG Bell&#x27;.

==Notable residents==
Famous former residents include:
* Georgetown was home to Francis Scott Key who arrived as a young lawyer in 1805. He and his family resided on M Street in the Key House. Dr. William Beanes, a relative of Key, captured the rear guard of the British Army while it was burning Washington during the War of 1812. When the mass of the army retreated, they retrieved their imprisoned guard and took Dr. Beanes as a captive to their fleet near Baltimore. Key went to the fleet to request the release of Beanes, was held until the bombardment of Fort McHenry was completed, and gained the inspiration for &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;.
* Alexander Graham Bell&#x27;s earliest switching office for the Bell System was located on a site just below the C&amp;O Canal, and it remains in use as a phone facility to this day. Bell originally moved to Georgetown due to the numerous legal hearings related to telephone patents, but then later created the Volta Laboratory and stayed on due to the many other scientific and technical organizations established in the region.

* John F. Kennedy lived in Georgetown in the 1950s as both a Representative and a Senator. Parties hosted by his wife, Jackie, and many other Georgetown hostesses drew political elites away from downtown clubs and hotels or the upper 16th Street corridor. Kennedy proposed to Jackie at Martin&#x27;s Tavern in 1953. He went to his presidential inauguration from his townhouse at 3307 N Street in January 1961.
* Pulitzer Prize-winning author Herman Wouk resided in Georgetown and attended the Georgetown synagogue, Kesher Israel Congregation, between 1964 and 1983 when he was researching and writing his two novels of World War II, &quot;The Winds of War&quot; and &quot;War and Remembrance&quot;.
* Hollywood actress Elizabeth Taylor lived in Georgetown during her marriage to Senator John Warner in the 1970s and early 1980s. Taylor&#x27;s first major stage performance, in Lillian Hellman&#x27;s &quot;The Little Foxes&quot;, took place nearby at the Kennedy Center during that time.
* Julia Child&#x27;s first house is located on Olive Street. Child and her husband Paul purchased the house in 1948, although they left for France soon after. In 1956, they returned to Georgetown, living in the Olive Street house until moving to Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1959. She wrote for Mastering the Art of French Cooking there.
* Pedro Casanave, the fifth mayor of Georgetown (who directed the construction and buried the Cornerstone in what later became in the White House on October 12, 1792), lived in Georgetown.
* Olivia Wilde grew up in Georgetown and attended Georgetown Day School.
* Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
* Former Montana Senator Max Baucus

Current residents include:
* Former Secretary of State John Kerry
* &quot;Washington Post&quot; Watergate reporter and current assistant managing editor Bob Woodward
* Former director of the FBI Robert Mueller

==In popular culture==
===Film===

Several movies have been filmed in Georgetown, including:

* &quot;Topaz&quot; (1969, private house)
* &quot;The Exorcist&quot; (1973) was set in the neighborhood and partially filmed there. In the movie&#x27;s climactic scene, the protagonist is hurled down the 75-step staircase at the end of 36th Street NW, which connects Prospect Street with M Street below. The staircase has come to be known as the &quot;&quot;Exorcist&quot; steps&quot;. A false front was built onto the house at the top of the steps so that the bedroom windows would immediately overlook the steps. The real structure is considerably set-back.
* &quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire&quot; (1985) was set in Georgetown, though the campus fraternity row portions were filmed at the University of Maryland campus in College Park.
* &quot;No Way Out&quot; (1987) featured a Georgetown Metro stop as a plot device, even though no such station exists; the subway station shots were filmed in Baltimore, Maryland. Chase scenes for the movie were shot on the Whitehurst Freeway.
* &quot;The Man with One Red Shoe&quot; (1985, an early Tom Hanks film)
* &quot;Chances Are&quot; (1989)
* &quot;The Exorcist III&quot; (1990)
* &quot;Timecop&quot; (1994)
* &quot;True Lies&quot; (1994)
* &quot;Dave&quot; (1993)
* &quot;The Jackal&quot; (1997, private homes)
* &quot;Enemy of the State&quot; (1998)
* &quot;Dick&quot; (1999, C&amp;O Canal)

<text>An appropriation bill, also known as supply bill or spending bill, is a proposed law that authorizes the expenditure of government funds. It is a bill that sets money aside for specific spending. In some democracies, approval of the legislature is necessary for the government to spend money.

In a Westminster parliamentary system, the defeat of an appropriation bill in a parliamentary vote generally necessitates either the resignation of a government or the calling of a general election. One of the more famous examples of the defeat of a supply bill was the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis, when the Senate, which was controlled by the opposition, refused to approve a package of appropriation and loan bills, prompting Governor-General Sir John Kerr to dismiss Prime Minister Gough Whitlam and appoint Malcolm Fraser as caretaker Prime Minister until the next election (where the Fraser government was elected).

==By country==
===India===
An appropriation bill is a bill that authorizes the government to withdraw funds from the Consolidated Fund of India for use during the financial year. Although Appropriation Acts are not included in any official list of central laws, they technically remain on the books. Since 2016, appropriation bills in India include a sunset clause as result of which the Act is automatically repealed after its purpose is met. Appropriation Acts passed prior to 2016 were repealed by the enactment of &quot;The Appropriation Acts (Repeal) Act, 2015&quot; in April 2016.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, an Appropriation Bill is the formal name for the annual Act of Parliament that gives legal effect to the New Zealand Budget, that is, the Government&#x27;s taxing and spending policies for the forthcoming year (from 1 July to 30 June). Like other bills, it is enacted, following debate, by the House of Representatives, and assented to by the governor-general. The main Appropriation Bill is traditionally placed before the House for its first reading in May amid considerable media interest, an event known as the &quot;introduction of the Budget&quot;. An Appropriation Bill is not sent to a select committee, a lengthy process undergone by most bills during which they are scrutinised in detail by the committee, which also receives public submissions relating to the bill. Instead, an expedited process is followed in which the Appropriation Bill essentially goes directly to its second reading for consideration by the committee of the whole House. Royal assent is granted after the formality of a third reading.

The main Appropriation Bill is formally called an &quot;Appropriation (Estimates) Bill&quot;, or, after assented to, an &quot;Appropriation (Estimates) &quot;Act&quot;&quot;. Supplementary Budgetary legislation in New Zealand includes an annual &quot;Appropriation (Confirmation and Validation) Bill&quot;, which serves to validate taxation and spending incurred in the previous year which fell outside the previous year&#x27;s Budget, and &quot;Imprest Supply Bills,&quot; typically several in a year, which grant interim authority to the Government to tax and spend.

Both Appropriation and Imprest Supply bills fall under the rubric of confidence and supply. A refusal by the House to pass such a Bill conventionally leads to either the resignation of the Government (unlikely, since there is usually no alternative Government immediately available) or to a dissolution of the House and a subsequent general election.

===Philippines===
In the Philippines, the Congress which consists of the House of Representatives and the Senate is mandated to pass a General Appropriation Bill annually. If the Congress fails to pass a General Appropriation Bill for a fiscal year, the General Appropriation Act for the previous fiscal year would be used until a bill for the specific year is passed.

===United States===

Under the presidential system, the support of the Congress for the President&#x27;s appropriations requests is not necessary for the separately-elected President to remain in office, but it can severely limit the President&#x27;s ability to govern effectively.

In the United States, there are two types of appropriations. When Congress sets up particular programs, the legislation may itself set up the necessary appropriation mechanism, such as the social security program for which payment of benefits are &quot;mandatory&quot;. A mandatory program does not need an additional authorisation for spending under the program to occur. An authorization bill can create programs and make known Congress&#x27;s intended level of spending for programs that also require an appropriation. What distinguishes a mandatory program from a discretionary program is that after Congress enacts a law creating a mandatory program, the program may spend funds until the program expires based on a provision in law or until a subsequent law either terminates the program or reauthorizes it. Discretionary programs typically require annual appropriations legislation.

An appropriation bill is used for actually providing money for &quot;discretionary&quot; programs. Appropriations are generally done on an annual basis, but multi-year appropriations are occasionally passed. According to the US Constitution (Article I, Section 8, clause 12), Army appropriations cannot be for more than two years at a time. An annual appropriation requires that the funds appropriated to be obligated (spent) by the end of the fiscal year of the appropriation. Once the fiscal year ends, no more money can be spent via the prior year&#x27;s appropriation. A new appropriation for the new fiscal year must be passed in order for continued spending to occur or passage of a special appropriations bill known as a continuing resolution, which generally permits continued spending for a short period of time, usually at prior year levels. The Anti-Deficiency Act makes void any attempt to spend money for which there is no current appropriation.

According to the Origination Clause of the US Constitution, all bills for raising revenue, generally tax bills, must originate in the House of Representatives, similar to the Westminster system requirement for all money bills to originate in the lower house. Traditionally, appropriation bills originate in the House of Representatives. House appropriations bills begin with &quot;H.R.&quot;, meaning &quot;House of Representatives.&quot; In reference to revenue bills, the Constitution also states that the &quot;Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills.&quot; As with revenue bills, the Senate and House each drafts and considers its own appropriation bill. The Senate then cuts and pastes, substitutes the language of its version of a particular appropriation bill for the language of the House bill, and agrees to the bill as amended.

The United States House Committee on Appropriations and the United States Senate Committee on Appropriations have jurisdiction over appropriations bills. Both committees have twelve matching subcommittees tasked with working on one of the twelve annual regular appropriations bills. Other committees and lawmakers in Congress write legislation creating programs and reauthorizing old ones to continue. That legislation is called an authorization bill. Such legislation authorizes the programs to exist and expenditure of funds on them, but it cannot actually give them the money. That second step of granting the money is done in an appropriations bill. The appropriations committees have power because they can decide whether to fund the programs at the maximum level authorized, a lesser amount, or not at all.

Appropriations bills in the United States can also come in the format of an omnibus spending bill, a continuing resolution, or a supplemental appropriation bill. If Congress has not enacted the regular appropriations bills by the start of a new fiscal year, it can pass a continuing resolution, which continues the pre-existing appropriations at the same levels as the previous fiscal year (or with minor modifications) for a set amount of time. An omnibus spending bill is simply a combination of multiple appropriations bills into one larger appropriations bill. Supplemental appropriations bills increase funding for activities that were already funded in previous appropriations bills or the provide new funding for unexpected expenses. For example, both the War in Afghanistan and the Iraq War were funded with a variety of supplemental appropriations. Supplemental appropriations bills also provide funding for recovering from unexpected natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy (the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013).

Annual appropriations are divided into 12 separate pieces of legislation:

#Agriculture,
#Commerce, Justice, and Science,
#Defense,
#Energy and Water,
#Financial Services,
#Homeland Security,
#Interior and Environment,
#Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education,
#Legislative,
#Military and Veterans,
#State and Foreign Operations,
#Transportation and Housing and Urban Development.

<doc id="198568" wikidata="Q840522" url="?curid=198568" title="Pardalote">
<text>Pardalotes or peep-wrens are a family, Pardalotidae, of very small, brightly coloured birds native to Australia, with short tails, strong legs, and stubby blunt beaks. This family is composed of four species in one genus, &quot;Pardalotus&quot;, and several subspecies. The name derives from a Greek word meaning &quot;spotted&quot;. The family once contained several other species now split into the family Acanthizidae.

Pardalotes spend most of their time high in the outer foliage of trees, feeding on insects, spiders, and above all lerps (a type of sap-sucking insect). Their role in controlling lerp infestations in the eucalyptus forests of Australia may be significant. They generally live in pairs in small tunnels or in small family groups but sometimes come together into flocks after breeding.

Pardalotes are seasonal breeders in temperate areas of Australia but may breed year round in warmer areas. They are monogamous breeders, and both partners share nest construction, incubation and chick-rearing duties. All four species nest in deep horizontal tunnels drilled into banks of earth. Externally about the size of a mouse-hole, they can be very deep, at a metre or more. Some species also nest in tree hollows.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The genus &quot;Pardalotus&quot; was introduced in 1816 by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot to accommodate a single species, the spotted pardalote, which is therefore considered as the type species. The genus name is from Ancient Greek &quot;pardalōtos&quot; meaning &quot;spotted like a leopard&quot;. The family Pardalotidae (as a subfamily Pardalotinae) was introduced in 1842 by the English naturalist Hugh Strickland.

The pardalotes consist of several species contained in a single genus, &quot;Pardalotus&quot;, with the general consensus being to recognise four species. The placement of the genus has varied, being first placed with the mostly oriental flowerpeckers (Dicaeidae), as both groups are dumpy-looking birds with bright plumage. In addition both groups have a reduced tenth primary (one of the flight feathers). Genetic analysis has shown that the two groups are in fact not closely related, and that the pardalotes are instead more closely related another Australian family, the Acanthizidae, which includes the scrubwrens, gerygones and thornbills. The two are sometimes merged into one family; when this is done the combined family is known as Pardalotidae, but the two groups have also been treated as two separate families.

Within the family two species, the forty-spotted pardalote and the red-browed pardalote, are fairly invariant species, but the remaining two species are highly variable. The striated pardalote contains six subspecies, which are sometimes elevated to four separate species. The spotted pardalote has three subspecies, one of which—the yellow-rumped pardalote—is sometimes treated as a separate species due to its distinctive plumage and call and lack of zone of hybridization in southwestern Australia. Within the family the relationships between the subspecies are unclear, although it is thought that the forty-spotted pardalote is closely related to the spotted pardalote.
==Description==
The pardalotes are small, compact birds that range in size from in length. The spotted and striated pardalotes conform to Bergmann&#x27;s rule and are larger in the south than they are in the north. The males and females are the same size as each other, but there are some differences in the plumage of some species. They have short, square-tipped tails and relatively short rounded wings (which are longer in the more dispersive species). The bill is short, deep and robust, but lacks the rictal bristles that surround the bills of many other insectivorous birds.

== Distribution and habitat ==

The pardalotes are endemic to Australia. The forty-spotted has the most restricted distribution of the four species, being endemic to Tasmania; in contrast the most widespread species, the striated pardalote, is found throughout Australia, only absent from some of the driest areas of the inland central and western deserts. The red-browed pardalote is widespread in the north and west of Australia, whereas the spotted pardalote is found closer to the coast in southern and eastern Australia.

The family are eucalyptus forest specialists. While they may occur in forests and woodlands dominated by other tree types, these are marginal habitats for the family and are seldom used. Pardalotes occupy a wide range of eucalypt habitats, from tall forests with a canopy over high to low mallee woodlands with a canopy of just .

==Behaviour and ecology==
Pardalotes are almost exclusively insectivores. They will occasionally consume some plant materials including seeds, and there has been an observation of one striated pardalote beating and then eating a lizard. They feed singly or in pairs during the breeding season, but have been recorded as joining mixed-species feeding flocks in the winter months. The majority of foraging occurs on &quot;Eucalyptus&quot;, with other trees being used much less frequently; among the eucalyptus, trees from the subgenus &quot;Symphyomyrtus&quot; are preferred. Pardalotes forage by gleaning insects from the foliage, as opposed to catching insects while flying. Pardalotes may consume a number of different types of insects, but lerps – a honeydew casing exuded by insects of the family &quot;Psyllidae&quot; – form the major component of their diet and the one to which they are most adapted. These lerps are also highly sought after by the larger honeyeaters, which aggressively defend the resource. A study of pardalotes in Australia estimated that 5% of a pardalote&#x27;s day is spent evading honeyeater attacks.

==Movements==
Patterns of dispersal include regular winter movements northwards and to lower altitudes. Striated Pardalotes migrate from Tasmania across Bass Strait to winter on the Australian mainland. Spotted and Striated Pardalotes move from higher altitude forests to lower rainfall inland plains in SE Australia. Spotted and Striated Pardalotes also move intermittently following increases in psyllids food sources. Some Pardalote populations are sedentary. Forty-spotted Pardalotes are probably sedentary with local seasonal movements restricted to eastern Tasmania and its adjacent islands. Movements of Red-browed Pardalotes are unknown.

==Status and conservation threats==
The Striated, Spotted and Red-browed Pardalotes are widespread and common but their populations are decreasing due to habitat loss. Land clearing and commercial forestry in native eucalypt forests results in the loss of foraging habitat, nesting hollows and forest linkages essential for dispersal. The Forty-spotted Pardalote is listed as Endangered by the IUCN and under Australian legislation. The distribution of the Forty-spotted Pardalote is restricted to a narrow habitat range and the population is small and fragmented. Threats include habitat loss, competition with colonial honeyeaters, especially the Noisy Miner, and parasitism. The Tasmanian ectoparasite, Passeromyia longicornis demonstrates a higher parasite load and virulence with high nestling mortality in Forty-spotted Pardalote nests compared to Striated Pardalotes. Over the 2-year study by Edworthy et al., Forty-spotted Pardalotes fledged fewer nestlings (18%) than sympatric Striated Pardalotes (26%). Climate change effects are uncertain but anticipated. Reductions in the distribution of the Striated Pardalote in the Western Australian wheatbelt are predicted due to climate change.
