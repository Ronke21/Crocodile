<text>The Tripods is a series of young adult science fiction novels by John Christopher. The series takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where humanity is enslaved by &quot;Tripods&quot; – gigantic three-legged walking machines piloted by an alien race later identified as the &quot;Masters&quot;. The first two books were the basis of a science fiction TV series, produced in the United Kingdom in the 1980s.

==Synopsis==
The story of &quot;The Tripods&quot; is a variation on post-apocalyptic literature, wherein humanity has been enslaved by &quot;Tripods&quot; — gigantic three-legged walking machines, piloted by unseen alien entities (later identified as &quot;Masters&quot;). Human society is largely pastoral, with few habitations larger than villages, and what little industry exists is conducted under the watchful presence of the Tripods. Lifestyle is reminiscent of the Middle Ages, but small artifacts from the Modern Age are still used as status symbols, such as the protagonist&#x27;s father owning a watch.

Humans are controlled from age 14 by implants called &quot;Caps,&quot; which suppress individuality and free will and make them docile. Some people&#x27;s minds are broken by the Caps; they become so-called &quot;Vagrants.&quot; According to &quot;The City of Gold and Lead&quot;, Masters begin to believe that humans should be capped at an earlier age &quot;because some humans, in the year or two before they are Capped, become rebellious and act against the Masters,&quot; but this cannot be done, because Capping must wait until the braincase has stopped growing.

==Series==
===&quot;The White Mountains&quot; (1967) ===
Life is like the Middle Ages in the pre-industrial era, except that all adolescent and adult humans are subject to Tripod control. Protagonist Will Parker, a thirteen-year-old boy living in the fictional English village of Wherton, is looking forward to being Capped at the next Capping Day, until a chance meeting with a mysterious fake-Capped man named Ozymandias (taking his name from a poem he frequently recites) prompts him to discover a world beyond the Tripods&#x27; control. Together with his cousin Henry and later a French teenager named Jean-Paul Deliet, nicknamed &quot;Beanpole&quot;, they move off towards the White Mountains to avoid being Capped. On the way, they encounter a girl, Eloise, who is a possible romantic interest for Will, but when she is Capped (earlier than expected) they move on. The novel climaxes with Henry and Beanpole discovering that earlier, when Will was captured by a Tripod, he was unknowingly implanted with a tracking device. When Henry and Beanpole remove the device, a nearby Tripod attacks them, but the boys defeat the Tripod and elude subsequent efforts to find them. The story ends with them joining the resistance, located in the eponymous White Mountains. The White Mountains also are free from the Tripods.

===&quot;&quot; (1967)===
After a year in the White Mountains, the resistance charges Will, Beanpole, and a German boy, Fritz, who are equipped with fake Caps, to infiltrate a Tripod city by competing in a regional sporting exhibition where the winners will be taken by the Tripods. Will, a boxer, and Fritz, a runner, win their respective contests, while Beanpole fails to win in the jumping events.

The winners are taken to the Tripod city in a pressurized dome astride a river. Inside the city, the boys encounter the Tripods&#x27; operators, whom they refer to as the &quot;Masters&quot;. Human males are slaves inside the cities, while beautiful females are killed and preserved for the Masters to admire. Will discovers Eloise among them. Slaves are furnished with breathing masks to survive the aliens&#x27; atmosphere but are rapidly exhausted by the stronger artificial gravity and must therefore be periodically replaced (hence the selection through athletic contests). The &quot;gold&quot; in the title refers to the city&#x27;s color; both &quot;gold&quot; and &quot;lead&quot; refer to the heightened gravity.

While Fritz is abused by his Master, Will is treated as a privileged pet by his. Eventually, Will&#x27;s Master reveals a plan to replace the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere with the Masters&#x27; toxic air to enable full control of the Earth. When the Master finds Will&#x27;s diary accidentally, Will kills him to maintain the secret. With the assistance of Fritz (who temporarily stays behind to maintain Will&#x27;s alibi), Will escapes. The story ends with Will and Beanpole giving Fritz up for dead and returning to the White Mountains.

===&quot;&quot; (1968)===
Will and Fritz (who had managed to escape the city after all) travel to Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, and the Middle East to organize resistance against the Tripods. The resistance, having ambushed a Tripod and captured a Master, accidentally discover that alcohol has a strong soporific effect on them, and use this knowledge to simultaneously attack their cities. Having introduced alcohol into the aliens&#x27; city water systems, raiding groups kill the Masters in two of the three cities by forcing open airlocks and exposing the unconscious aliens to Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. However, the attack on the third city (located in Panama) fails. After an attack using simple aeroplanes and aerial bombs also fails, another attack is undertaken using hot air balloons developed by Beanpole. After most bombs detonate either before making contact with the dome of the city, or after the bomb has bounced clear, Henry jumps from his balloon onto the city&#x27;s domed roof and holds the bomb in place, sacrificing himself and shattering the dome. Earth&#x27;s atmosphere kills the Masters, and Henry is remembered as a hero.

Sometime later, the Masters&#x27; atmosphere-seeding spaceship arrives and destroys the remains of their cities, then leaves – presumably since the cities contained &quot;star maps&quot; which showed the location of the Masters&#x27; home world, also to prevent the humans from reverse engineering their technology – although Beanpole notes that they have already learned much from the cities. Modern human technology, which was halted during the Masters&#x27; rule is rediscovered rapidly, including the theory of space travel.

The saga ends with the Resistance leader Julius being deposed at a summit of nations. In contrast to Julius&#x27; efforts to unite the world, the alliance built during the resistance falls apart, with nationalistic hostilities appearing and each country going their separate ways. Will, Beanpole, and Fritz reunite as a tribute to Julius, to work towards establishing a better world.

===&quot;&quot; (1988)===
&quot;When the Tripods Came&quot; is a prequel written twenty years after the publication of the original trilogy. The plot follows the description of the conquest given in &quot;The City of Gold and Lead&quot;.

Fearing the technological potential of humanity, the so-called &quot;Masters&quot;, unable to defeat humanity in a conventional war, hypnotise people through a television program called &quot;The Trippy Show&quot;, later using temporary and finally permanent Caps to control them.

As in the original trilogy, the narrator of &quot;When the Tripods Came&quot; is a young English boy. He and a friend bear witness to a botched initial invasion by a single Tripod in the British countryside. After the event is old news, &quot;The Trippy Show&quot; begins broadcasting, and engenders in some viewers an enthusiasm that gradually becomes a mania. As an increasingly hypnotized society falls under the control of the Masters, he and his family escape to Guernsey by boat. When they find it is also controlled by the Capped, they hijack a plane to Switzerland, which has managed to restrict its hypnotized population better than other European nations. When the Swiss are eventually invaded and enslaved, the narrator and his family establish the &quot;White Mountains&quot; resistance movement of the original trilogy.

===Editions===
Editions have been published by:
* Hamish Hamilton (UK First Edition)
* Simon &amp; Schuster (USA First Edition)
* Collier Books
* E. P. Dutton
* Thorndike Press
* Knight Books
* Turtleback Books
* Beaver Books
* Audible Studios (audiobook)

The series has been translated into Arabic, Dutch, Danish, Finnish, French, German, Hebrew, Persian, Spanish, Greek, and Mandarin Chinese (Taiwan).

==Comic books==
Multiple graphic adaptations have been produced, notably including:

* &quot;Boys&#x27; Life&quot;, the monthly magazine of the Boy Scouts of America, serialised all three books in the trilogy from May 1981 to August 1986. Artist Frank Bolle drew the single page black and white proofs, which were then inked by another person.
* In 1985, the BBC initiated &quot;BEEB&quot;, the BBC Junior Television Magazine, and started to present in picture strip form additional adventures of Will, Henry, and Beanpole on their way to the White Mountains, starting at some unspecified point during the fourth episode of the first BBC serial as the trio pass through ruined Paris, and then heading off at a tangent to the television version. From Issue 6, the boys were accompanied on their journey by a young woman named Fizzio, a character original to the strip. The strips were drawn by John M. Burns and in each issue, they consisted of three pages; the first two in colour and the third in black and white. The storyline was never concluded as &quot;BEEB&quot; ceased publication after only 20 issues.
* Masters were one of the species detailed in &quot;Barlowe&#x27;s Guide to Extraterrestrials&quot;.

==Television series==

The television version of &quot;The Tripods&quot; was jointly produced by the BBC in the United Kingdom and the Seven Network in Australia. The music soundtrack was written by Ken Freeman. The series was noted for being one of the first to feature computer generated graphics and special effects.

Series one of &quot;The Tripods&quot;, broadcast in 1984, which had 13 half-hour episodes written by the well-known author of many radio plays Alick Rowe, covers the first book, &quot;The White Mountains&quot;; the 12-episode second series adapted and written by Christopher Penfold (1985) covers &quot;The City of Gold and Lead&quot;. Although a television script had been written for the third series &quot;The Pool of Fire&quot;, it never went into production.

The first series was released on both VHS and DVD. The BBC released &quot;Tripods — The Complete Series 1 &amp; 2&quot; on DVD in March 2009.

===Comparison with the novels===
When the BBC made the television series of The Tripods in the 1980s, they departed from Christopher&#x27;s description of the Masters. In the television series, the Masters somewhat resemble the Tripods they drive. This makes the Tripods seem much more like mecha, similar to those described in &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;, than purely eccentric vehicles. In the BBC serial, the Masters did not need to eat, sleep or drink as humans do. Additionally, they were not the rulers of the city, but were, in turn, under the rule of higher beings made of pure energy, known as Cognoscs. The Masters came from a planet named Trion that was in the center of a triple star system.

The method by which the Masters name themselves is also different. Rather than having names, they are simply called by their addresses. Will&#x27;s Master is called West Avenue 4, Sector 6, Level 8, or West 468.

The Masters in the BBC production enjoyed a hotter living environment. It was also established that the rigors of the Master&#x27;s environment cause premature aging in humans. Treatment of humans slaves varied – ranging from the harsh and thoughtless abuse of &quot;miner&quot; slaves to the relatively luxurious amenities provided to the &quot;power elite&quot;.

To avoid an overuse of the mechanical Tripods, the producers invented a new faction, the &quot;Black Guards,&quot; as a human police force with the task to enforce the will of the Masters. They served as a more immediate threat for Will, his friends and the resistance.

==Potential film adaptation==
On 4 January 2005, Gregor Johnson was hired to direct a feature film adaptation of The Tripods and rewrite the screenplay for Don Murphy &amp; Touchstone Pictures. In 2009, Alex Proyas was hired to direct a feature film adaptation of The Tripods and Stuart Hazeldine would write the screenplay starting with &quot;The White Mountain.&quot;

<doc id="188896" wikidata="Q466714" url="?curid=188896" title="Neutron moderator">
<text>In nuclear engineering, a neutron moderator is a medium that reduces the speed of fast neutrons, ideally without capturing any, leaving them as thermal neutrons with only minimal (thermal) kinetic energy. These thermal neutrons are immensely more susceptible than fast neutrons to propagate a nuclear chain reaction of uranium-235 or other fissile isotope by colliding with their atomic nucleus.

Water (sometimes called &quot;light water&quot; in this context) is the most commonly used moderator (roughly 75% of the world&#x27;s reactors). Solid graphite (20% of reactors) and heavy water (5% of reactors) are the main alternatives. Beryllium has also been used in some experimental types, and hydrocarbons have been suggested as another possibility.

== Moderation ==
Neutrons are normally bound into an atomic nucleus and do not exist free for long in nature. The unbound neutron has a half-life of 10 minutes and 11 seconds. The release of neutrons from the nucleus requires exceeding the binding energy of the neutron, which is typically 7-9 MeV for most isotopes. Neutron sources generate free neutrons by a variety of nuclear reactions, including nuclear fission and nuclear fusion. Whatever the source of neutrons, they are released with energies of several MeV.

According to the equipartition theorem, the average kinetic energy, formula_1, can be related to temperature, formula_2, via:
:formula_3, 
where formula_4 is the neutron mass, formula_5 is the average squared neutron speed, and formula_6 is the Boltzmann constant. The characteristic neutron temperature of several-MeV neutrons is several tens of billions kelvin.

Moderation is the process of the reduction of the initial high speed (high kinetic energy) of the free neutron. Since energy is conserved, this reduction of the neutron speed takes place by transfer of energy to a material called a &quot;moderator&quot;.

The probability of scattering of a neutron from a nucleus is given by the scattering cross section. The first few collisions with the moderator may be of sufficiently high energy to excite the nucleus of the moderator. Such a collision is inelastic, since some of the kinetic energy is transformed to potential energy by exciting some of the internal degrees of freedom of the nucleus to form an excited state. As the energy of the neutron is lowered, the collisions become predominantly elastic, i.e., the total kinetic energy and momentum of the system (that of the neutron and the nucleus) is conserved.

Given the mathematics of elastic collisions, as neutrons are very light compared to most nuclei, the most efficient way of removing kinetic energy from the neutron is by choosing a moderating nucleus that has near identical mass.

A collision of a neutron which has mass of 1 with a 1H nucleus (a proton) could result in the neutron losing virtually all of its energy in a single head-on collision. More generally, it is necessary to take into account both glancing and head-on collisions. The &quot;mean logarithmic reduction of neutron energy per collision&quot;, formula_7, depends only on the atomic mass, formula_8, of the nucleus and is given by:

formula_9.

This can be reasonably approximated to the very simple form formula_10. From this one can deduce formula_11, the expected number of collisions of the neutron with nuclei of a given type that is required to reduce the kinetic energy of a neutron from formula_12 to formula_13
:formula_14.

===Materials===
Some nuclei have larger absorption cross sections than others, which removes free neutrons from the flux. Therefore, a further criterion for an efficient moderator is one for which this parameter is small. The &quot;moderating efficiency&quot; gives the ratio of the macroscopic cross sections of scattering, formula_15, weighted by formula_7 divided by that of absorption, formula_17: i.e., formula_18. For a compound moderator composed of more than one element, such as light or heavy water, it is necessary to take into account the moderating and absorbing effect of both the hydrogen isotope and oxygen atom to calculate formula_7. To bring a neutron from the fission energy of formula_12 2 MeV to an formula_21 of 1 eV takes an expected formula_11 of 16 and 29 collisions for H2O and D2O, respectively. Therefore, neutrons are more rapidly moderated by light water, as H has a far higher formula_15. However, it also has a far higher formula_17, so that the moderating efficiency is nearly 80 times higher for heavy water than for light water.

&quot;The ideal moderator is of low mass, high scattering cross section, and low absorption cross section&quot;.
===Distribution of neutron velocities===
After sufficient impacts, the speed of the neutron will be comparable to the speed of the nuclei given by thermal motion; this neutron is then called a thermal neutron, and the process may also be termed &quot;thermalization&quot;. Once at equilibrium at a given temperature the distribution of speeds (energies) expected of rigid spheres scattering elastically is given by the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. This is only slightly modified in a real moderator due to the speed (energy) dependence of the absorption cross-section of most materials, so that low-speed neutrons are preferentially absorbed, so that the true neutron velocity distribution in the core would be slightly hotter than predicted.

==Reactor moderators==

In a thermal-neutron reactor, the nucleus of a heavy fuel element such as uranium absorbs a slow-moving free neutron, becomes unstable, and then splits into two smaller atoms (fission products). The fission process for 235U nuclei yields two fission products, two to three fast-moving free neutrons, plus an amount of energy primarily manifested in the kinetic energy of the recoiling fission products. The free neutrons are emitted with a kinetic energy of ~2 MeV each. Because more free neutrons are released from a uranium fission event than thermal neutrons are required to initiate the event, the reaction can become a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction under controlled conditions, thus liberating a tremendous amount of energy.

The probability of further fission events is determined by the fission cross section, which is dependent upon the speed (energy) of the incident neutrons. For thermal reactors, high-energy neutrons in the MeV-range are much less likely (though not unable) to cause further fission. The newly released fast neutrons, moving at roughly 10% of the speed of light, must be slowed down or &quot;moderated&quot;, typically to speeds of a few kilometres per second, if they are to be likely to cause further fission in neighbouring 235U nuclei and hence continue the chain reaction. This speed occurs at temperatures in the few hundred Celsius range.

In all moderated reactors, some neutrons of all energy levels will produce fission, including fast neutrons. Some reactors are more fully &quot;thermalised&quot; than others; for example, in a CANDU reactor nearly all fission reactions are produced by thermal neutrons, while in a pressurized water reactor (PWR) a considerable portion of the fissions are produced by higher-energy neutrons. In the proposed water-cooled supercritical water reactor, the proportion of fast fissions may exceed 50%, making it technically a fast-neutron reactor.

A fast reactor uses no moderator but relies on fission produced by unmoderated fast neutrons to sustain the chain reaction. In some fast reactor designs, up to 20% of fissions can come from direct fast neutron fission of uranium-238, an isotope which is not fissile at all with thermal neutrons.

Moderators are also used in non-reactor neutron sources, such as plutonium-beryllium (using the (α,n) reaction) and spallation sources (using (p,xn) reactions with neutron rich heavy elements as targets).

== Form and location ==

The form and location of the moderator can greatly influence the cost and safety of a reactor. Classically, moderators were precision-machined blocks of high-purity graphite with embedded ducting to carry away heat. They were in the hottest part of the reactor and therefore subject to corrosion and ablation. In some materials, including graphite, the impact of the neutrons with the moderator can cause the moderator to accumulate dangerous amounts of Wigner energy. This problem led to the infamous Windscale fire at the Windscale Piles, a nuclear reactor complex in the United Kingdom, in 1957. In a carbon dioxide cooled graphite moderated reactor where coolant and moderator are in contact with one another, the Boudouard reaction needs to be taken into account. This is also the case if fuel elements have an outer layer of carbon—as in some TRISO fuels—or if an inner carbon layer becomes exposed by failure of one or several outer layers.

In pebble-bed reactors, the nuclear fuel is embedded in spheres of reactor-grade pyrolytic carbon, roughly of the size of pebbles. The spaces between the spheres serve as ducting. The reactor is operated above the Wigner annealing temperature so that the graphite does not accumulate dangerous amounts of Wigner energy.

In CANDU and PWR reactors, the moderator is liquid water (heavy water for CANDU, light water for PWR). In the event of a loss-of-coolant accident in a PWR, the moderator is also lost and the reaction will stop. This negative void coefficient is an important safety feature of these reactors. In CANDU the moderator is located in a separate heavy-water circuit, surrounding the pressurized heavy-water coolant channels. The heavy water will slow down a significant portion of neutrons to the resonance integral of increasing the neutron capture in this isotope that makes up over 99% of the uranium in CANDU fuel thus decreasing the amount of neutrons available for fission. As a consequence, removing some of the heavy water will increase reactivity until so much is removed that too little moderation is provided to keep the reaction going. This design gives CANDU reactors a positive void coefficient, although the slower neutron kinetics of heavy-water moderated systems compensates for this, leading to comparable safety with PWRs. 

In the light-water-cooled, graphite-moderated RBMK, a reactor type originally envisioned to allow both production of weapons grade plutonium and large amounts of usable heat while using natural uranium and foregoing the use of heavy water, the light water coolant acts primarily as a neutron absorber and thus its removal in a loss-of-coolant accident or by conversion of water into steam will &quot;increase&quot; the amount of thermal neutrons available for fission. Following the Chernobyl nuclear accident the issue was remedied so that all still operating RBMK type reactors have a slightly negative void coefficient, but they require a higher degree of uranium enrichment in their fuel.

==Impurities==

Good moderators are free of neutron-absorbing impurities such as boron. In commercial nuclear power plants the moderator typically contains dissolved boron. The boron concentration of the reactor coolant can be changed by the operators by adding boric acid or by diluting with water to manipulate reactor power. The Nazi Nuclear Program suffered a substantial setback when its inexpensive graphite moderators failed to function. At that time, most graphites were deposited onto boron electrodes, and the German commercial graphite contained too much boron. Since the war-time German program never discovered this problem, they were forced to use far more expensive heavy water moderators. This problem was discovered by physicist Leó Szilárd.

== Non-graphite moderators ==

Some moderators are quite expensive, for example beryllium, and reactor-grade heavy water. Reactor-grade heavy water must be 99.75% pure to enable reactions with unenriched uranium. This is difficult to prepare because heavy water and regular water form the same chemical bonds in almost the same ways, at only slightly different speeds.

The much cheaper light water moderator (essentially very pure regular water) absorbs too many neutrons to be used with unenriched natural uranium, and therefore uranium enrichment or nuclear reprocessing becomes necessary to operate such reactors, increasing overall costs. Both enrichment and reprocessing are expensive and technologically challenging processes, and additionally both enrichment and several types of reprocessing can be used to create weapons-usable material, causing proliferation concerns.

The CANDU reactor&#x27;s moderator doubles as a safety feature. A large tank of low-temperature, low-pressure heavy water moderates the neutrons and also acts as a heat sink in extreme loss-of-coolant accident conditions. It is separated from the fuel rods that actually generate the heat. Heavy water is very effective at slowing down (moderating) neutrons, giving CANDU reactors their important and defining characteristic of high &quot;neutron economy&quot;. Unlike a light water reactor where adding water to the core in an accident might provide enough moderation to make a subcritical assembly go critical again, heavy water reactors will decrease their reactivity if light water is added to the core, which provides another important safety feature in the case of certain accident scenarios. However, any heavy water that becomes mixed with the emergency coolant light water will become too diluted to be useful without isotope separation.

== Nuclear weapon design ==

Early speculation about nuclear weapons assumed that an &quot;atom bomb&quot; would be a large amount of fissile material moderated by a neutron moderator, similar in structure to a nuclear reactor or &quot;pile&quot;. Only the Manhattan Project embraced the idea of a chain reaction of fast neutrons in pure metallic uranium or plutonium. Other moderated designs were also considered by the Americans; proposals included using uranium deuteride as the fissile material. 

In 1943 Robert Oppenheimer and Niels Bohr considered the possibility of using a &quot;pile&quot; as a weapon. The motivation was that with a graphite moderator it would be possible to achieve the chain reaction without the use of any isotope separation. However, plutonium can be produced (&quot;bred&quot;) sufficiently isotopically pure as to be usable in a bomb and then has to be &quot;only&quot; separated chemically, a much easier processes than isotope separation, albeit still a challenging one. In August 1945, when information of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima was relayed to the scientists of the German nuclear program who were interred at Farm Hall in England, chief scientist Werner Heisenberg hypothesized that the device must have been &quot;something like a nuclear reactor, with the neutrons slowed by many collisions with a moderator&quot;. The German program, which had been much less advanced, had never even considered the plutonium option and did not discover a feasible method of large scale isotope separation in uranium.

After the success of the Manhattan Project, all major nuclear weapons programs have relied on fast neutrons in their weapons designs. The notable exception is the &quot;Ruth&quot; and &quot;Ray&quot; test explosions of Operation Upshot–Knothole. The aim of the University of California Radiation Laboratory (UCRL) designs was the exploration of deuterated polyethylene charge containing uranium as a candidate thermonuclear fuel, hoping that deuterium would fuse (becoming an active medium) if compressed appropriately. If successful, the devices could also lead to a compact primary containing minimal amount of fissile material, and powerful enough to ignite RAMROD a thermonuclear weapon designed by UCRL at the time. For a &quot;hydride&quot; primary, the degree of compression would not make deuterium to fuse, but the design could be subjected to boosting, raising the yield considerably. The cores consisted of a mix of uranium deuteride (UD3), and deuterated polyethylene. The core tested in &quot;Ray&quot; used uranium low enriched in U235, and in both shots deuterium acted as the neutron moderator. The predicted yield was 1.5 to 3 kt for &quot;Ruth&quot; (with a maximum potential yield of 20 kt) and 0.5-1 kt for &quot;Ray&quot;. The tests produced yields of 200 tons of TNT each; both tests were considered to be fizzles.

A side effect of using a moderator in a nuclear explosive is that as the chain reaction progresses, the moderator will be heated, thus losing its ability to cool the neutrons. Another effect of moderation is that the time between subsequent neutron generations is increased, slowing down the reaction. This makes the containment of the explosion a problem; the inertia that is used to confine implosion type bombs will not be able to confine the reaction. The result may be a fizzle. The explosive power of a fully moderated explosion is thus limited; at worst it may be equal to a chemical explosive of similar mass. According to Heisenberg: &quot;One can never make an explosive with slow neutrons, not even with the heavy water machine, as then the neutrons only go with thermal speed, with the result that the reaction is so slow that the thing explodes sooner, before the reaction is complete.&quot; While a nuclear bomb working on thermal neutrons may be impractical, modern weapons designs may still benefit from some level of moderation. A beryllium tamper used as a neutron reflector will act as a moderator.

==Materials used==
* Hydrogen, as in ordinary &quot;light water&quot;. Because protium also has a significant cross section for neutron capture only limited moderation is possible without losing too many neutrons. The less-moderated neutrons are relatively more likely to be captured by uranium-238 and less likely to fission uranium-235, so light-water reactors require enriched uranium to operate. 
** There are also proposals to use the compound formed by the chemical reaction of metallic uranium and hydrogen (uranium hydride—UH3) as a combination fuel and moderator in a new type of reactor.
** Hydrogen is also used in the form of cryogenic liquid methane and sometimes liquid hydrogen as a cold neutron source in some research reactors: yielding a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution for the neutrons whose maximum is shifted to much lower energies.
** Hydrogen combined with carbon as in paraffin wax was used in some early German experiments.
* Deuterium, in the form of heavy water, in heavy water reactors, e.g. CANDU. Reactors moderated with heavy water can use unenriched natural uranium.
* Carbon, in the form of reactor-grade graphite or pyrolytic carbon, used in e.g. RBMK and pebble-bed reactors, or in compounds, e.g. carbon dioxide. As carbon dioxide contains twice as many oxygen atoms as it does carbon atoms and both have moderating and neutron absorbing effects in a similar range (see above), a significant share of the moderation in a (yet to be built) carbon dioxide moderated reactor would actually come from the oxygen. Lower-temperature reactors are susceptible to buildup of Wigner energy in the material. Like deuterium-moderated reactors, some of these reactors can use unenriched natural uranium.
** Graphite is also deliberately allowed to be heated to around 2000 K or higher in some research reactors to produce a hot neutron source: giving a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution whose maximum is spread out to generate higher energy neutrons.
* Beryllium, in the form of metal. Beryllium is expensive and toxic, so its use is limited. Beryllium was used in the S2G reactor.
* Lithium-7, in the form of a lithium fluoride salt, typically in conjunction with beryllium fluoride salt (FLiBe). This is the most common type of moderator in a molten-salt reactor.

Other light-nuclei materials are unsuitable for various reasons. Helium is a gas and it requires special design to achieve sufficient density; lithium-6 and boron-10 absorb neutrons.

<text>Timothy Alan Dick (born June 13, 1953), known professionally as Tim Allen, is an American actor and comedian. He is known for playing Tim &quot;The Toolman&quot; Taylor on the ABC sitcom &quot;Home Improvement&quot; (1991–1999) for which he won a Golden Globe Award and Mike Baxter on the ABC/Fox sitcom &quot;Last Man Standing&quot; (2011–2021). He voices Buzz Lightyear for the &quot;Toy Story&quot; franchise for which he won an Annie Award and played Scott Calvin and Santa Claus in &quot;The Santa Clause&quot; franchise (1994–present). 

Allen&#x27;s other films include &quot;Jungle 2 Jungle&quot; (1997), &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; (1999), &quot;Joe Somebody&quot; (2001), &quot;Big Trouble&quot; (2002), &quot;Christmas with the Kranks&quot; (2004), &quot;The Shaggy Dog&quot; (2006), &quot;Wild Hogs&quot; (2007), &quot;The Six Wives of Henry Lefay&quot; (2009) and &quot;Crazy on the Outside&quot; (2010).

== Early life and education ==
Allen was born in Denver, Colorado, on June 13, 1953. He is the third oldest of six children of Martha Katherine (née Fox), a community-service worker, and Gerald M. Dick, a real estate agent. Allen has two older brothers, two younger brothers, and a younger sister. His father died in a car accident in November 1964, colliding with a drunk driver when Allen was 11. Two years later, his mother married her high school sweetheart, a business executive, and moved with her six children to Birmingham, Michigan, to be with her new husband and his three children. Allen has said the move meant going from &quot;being in a cool group at one school to being at the bottom [of the social hierarchy at another].&quot;

Allen attended Seaholm High School in Birmingham, where he was in theater and music classes (resulting in his love of classical piano). He then attended Central Michigan University before transferring to Western Michigan University in 1974. At Western Michigan, Allen worked at the student radio station WIDR. In 1976 he received a Bachelor of Science degree in communications, specializing in radio and television production, with a split minor in philosophy and design.

== Career ==
=== 1975–1990: Standup comedy and film debut ===
Allen started his career as a comedian in 1975. On a dare from one of his friends, he participated in a comedy night at Mark Ridley&#x27;s Comedy Castle in Royal Oak, a suburb of Detroit. While in Detroit he began to get recognition appearing in local television commercials and appearing on cable comedy shows such as Gary Thison&#x27;s &quot;Some Semblance of Sanity&quot;. Following his release from prison in 1981, he returned to comedy. He moved to Los Angeles and became a regular performer at The Comedy Store. He began performing stand-up appearances on late-night talk shows and specials on record and film. In 1998, Western Michigan awarded Allen an honorary fine arts degree and the Distinguished Alumni Award. In a magazine interview, Allen once said, &quot;I can only play a part if I can draw on personal experience, and that well can go dry pretty quickly&quot;. His initial film debut was as a baggage handler in &quot;Tropical Snow&quot; (1988). 

=== 1991–2010: &quot;Home Improvement&quot; and franchise roles === 
Allen rose to fame in acting with the sitcom &quot;Home Improvement&quot; (1991–1999) produced for ABC by Wind Dancer Productions. Allen played the main character Tim &quot;The Tool-Man&quot; Taylor, the father of three boys. Much of the show was based on his stand-up comedy act. In November 1994, Allen simultaneously starred in the highest-grossing film (Walt Disney Pictures&#x27;s &quot;The Santa Clause&quot;), topped &quot;The New York Times&quot; bestseller list with his book &quot;Don&#x27;t Stand Too Close to a Naked Man&quot;, and appeared in the top-rated television series (&quot;Home Improvement&quot;) within one week. For his role on the show, Allen won a Golden Globe Award in 1995. &quot;Home Improvement&quot; ran until 1999, for which he was paid US$1.25 million per episode during the eighth and final season.

In 1995, Allen provided the voice of Buzz Lightyear in the Disney/Pixar blockbuster &quot;Toy Story&quot;. In 1997, he starred in the family comedy &quot;Jungle 2 Jungle&quot; from Disney. In 1999, he returned to voice Buzz Lightyear in &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;, which was a financial and critical hit. That same year, he starred in the sci-fi parody &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; alongside Sigourney Weaver, Alan Rickman, and Sam Rockwell. In 2002, he reprised his role as Scott Calvin in &quot;The Santa Clause 2&quot;. Two years later, he starred as Luther Krank in &quot;Christmas with the Kranks&quot;. In 2006, &quot;Zoom&quot; was released, starring Allen as Jack Shepard. The same year, he also starred in &quot;The Shaggy Dog&quot; and &quot;The Santa Clause 3&quot;. The year 2008 marked his first dramatic turn with a supporting role as an aging action film star in David Mamet&#x27;s &quot;Redbelt&quot;.

Allen began narrating the &quot;Pure Michigan&quot; television and radio commercials for the &quot;Travel Michigan&quot; agency. These commercials can be seen and heard throughout the Midwest and began airing nationally in 2009. In December 2009, he started a preview tour of &quot;Crazy on the Outside&quot;, a film that debuted in January 2010. Allen accompanied the film, helping promote it with a series of stand-up acts beforehand. During the performances, he told audiences he planned a 2010 comedy tour. Allen also directed the film, marking his film directorial debut.

Allen hosted the 8th Annual TV Land Awards on April 25, 2010. That same year, he returned the role of Buzz Lightyear in &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; and also became the official voice of the Chevrolet Cruze, narrating commercials for the vehicle, and he became the voice of Campbell Soup Company&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s Amazing What Soup Can Do&quot; campaign.

=== 2011–present: &quot;Last Man Standing&quot; and other roles === 
Allen returned to ABC with the sitcom &quot;Last Man Standing&quot; (2011–2021). He played the role of Mike Baxter, a conservative father fighting for his manhood in a house filled with women. The character is loosely based on his own life. After six seasons, the show was canceled in May 2017. On May 11, 2018, Fox TV&#x27;s CEOs and chairmen Gary Newman and Dana Walden said Fox had officially picked up &quot;Last Man Standing&quot; for a seventh season. The show ended in May 2021 after nine seasons.

Shortly before the 2017 cancellation of &quot;Last Man Standing&quot;, Allen had been announced as part of the cast of the Netflix original comedy film &quot;El Camino Christmas&quot; (2017). In 2018, he had a cameo voice role as Buzz Lightyear in &quot;Ralph Breaks the Internet&quot;. In 2019, he voiced the character in &quot;Toy Story 4&quot; and appeared as himself in &quot;No Safe Spaces&quot;, a documentary film. In 2022, it was announced that Allen would reprise the role of Scott Calvin in a Disney+ mini-series, &quot;The Santa Clauses&quot;, based on &quot;The Santa Clause&quot; franchise.

On June 30, 2022, the History Channel series &quot;More Power&quot; premiered, with co-host Allen reunited with Richard Karn. The show covered the history of tools and included field reports of people who use powerful tools. In February 2023, Allen announced that he would return as the voice of Buzz Lightyear in &quot;Toy Story 5&quot;.

On March 6, 2024, Allen announced on his Facebook page that he will be starring in a third sitcom called &quot;Shifting Gears&quot;. His character is Matt, a “stubborn, widowed owner of a classic car restoration shop. When Matt’s estranged daughter and her teenage kids move into his house, the real restoration begins.”

The series premiered on ABC on January 8, 2025.

== Personal life ==
=== Marriages and family === 

Allen was raised as an Episcopalian. He married Laura Deibel on April 7, 1984. Their daughter, Katherine, was born in December 1989. He and Deibel legally separated in 1999 and finalized their divorce in 2003. Allen married actress Jane Hajduk on October 7, 2006, in a small private ceremony in Grand Lake, Colorado. They had been dating for five years. Their daughter, Elizabeth, was born in March 2009.

=== Legal issues ===
On October 2, 1978, Allen was arrested at the Kalamazoo/Battle Creek International Airport for possession of over of cocaine. He subsequently pleaded guilty to felony drug trafficking charges and provided the names of other dealers in exchange for a sentence of three to seven years rather than possible life imprisonment. He was paroled on June 12, 1981, after serving two years and four months in Federal Correctional Institution, Sandstone, in Sandstone, Minnesota.

In 1998, Allen was arrested for driving under the influence in Birmingham, Michigan. At the time, his blood alcohol content was 0.15, nearly double the legal limit in Michigan. He was sentenced to one-year probation and entered a rehabilitation clinic for alcohol abuse as part of his court obligation.

=== Political views === 
Allen is a supporter of the Republican Party, describing himself as &quot;fiscally conservative and emotionally liberal&quot;. In 2021, he criticized then-former president Donald Trump and those taking part in the 2021 United States Capitol attack, calling the incident &quot;horrible, embarrassing, and shameful&quot; and opining that the rioters must have had inside help. He also said the riot had caused people to be embarrassed to be known as conservative.

Allen is also involved in philanthropic efforts to help reduce homelessness.

=== Car interests ===
Allen is a car enthusiast and competed in endurance racing for Saleen in a co-owned car in the 1990s, including the 24 Hours of Daytona. He also owns a car collection, which he houses in a former paint shop in Southern California. As of 2022, the collection includes a 1956 Ford F-100 custom made by McLaren, a 1965 Shelby Cobra, and a 1966 Ferrari 330 GTC. While some sources claim the latter&#x27;s standalone value to exceed $3,000,000, there is no proof of this, and typical sales of the same model net far less.

<doc id="188900" wikidata="Q1070529" url="?curid=188900" title="Colony of Virginia">
<text>The Colony of Virginia was a British colonial settlement in North America from 1606 to 1776.

The first effort to create an English settlement in the area was chartered in 1584 and established in 1585; the resulting Roanoke Colony lasted for three attempts totaling six years. In 1590, the colony was abandoned. But nearly 20 years later, the colony was re-settled at Jamestown, not far north of the original site. A second charter was issued in 1606 and settled in 1607, becoming the first enduring English colony in North America. It followed failed attempts at settlement on Newfoundland by Sir Humphrey Gilbert in 1583 and the Roanoke Colony (in modern eastern North Carolina) by Sir Walter Raleigh in the late 1580s.

The founder of the Jamestown colony was the Virginia Company, chartered by King James I, with its first two settlements being in Jamestown on the north bank of the James River and Popham Colony on the Kennebec River in modern-day Maine, both in 1607. The Popham colony quickly failed because of famine, disease, and conflicts with local Native American tribes in the first two years. Jamestown occupied land belonging to the Powhatan Confederacy; it was also on the brink of failure before the arrival of a new group of settlers and supplies by ship in 1610. Tobacco became Virginia&#x27;s first profitable export, the production of which had a significant impact on the society and settlement patterns.

In 1624, the Virginia Company&#x27;s charter was revoked by King James I, and the Virginia Colony was transferred to royal authority as a crown colony. After the English Civil War in the 1640s and 1650s, the Virginia colony was nicknamed &quot;The Old Dominion&quot; by King Charles II for its perceived loyalty to the English monarchy during the era of the Protectorate and Commonwealth of England.

From 1619 to 1775/1776, the colonial legislature of Virginia was the General Assembly, which governed in conjunction with a colonial governor. Jamestown remained the capital of the Virginia Colony until 1699; from 1699 until its dissolution, the capital was in Williamsburg. The colony experienced its first significant political turmoil with Bacon&#x27;s Rebellion of 1676.

After declaring independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1775, before the Declaration of Independence was officially adopted, the Virginia Colony became the Commonwealth of Virginia, one of the original thirteen states of the United States, adopting as its official slogan &quot;The Old Dominion&quot;. The entire modern states of West Virginia, Kentucky, Indiana, and Illinois, and portions of Ohio and Western Pennsylvania were later created from the territory encompassed, or claimed by, the colony of Virginia at the time of further American independence in July 1776.

== Etymology ==
=== Virginia ===

&quot;Virginia&quot; is the oldest designation for English claims in North America. In 1584, Sir Walter Raleigh sent Philip Amadas and Arthur Barlowe to explore what is now the North Carolina coast. They returned with word of a regional king (&quot;weroance&quot;) named &quot;Wingina&quot;, who ruled a land supposedly called &quot;Wingandacoa&quot;. &quot;Virginia&quot; was originally a term used to refer to England&#x27;s entire North American possession and claim along the east coast from the 34th parallel (close to Cape Fear) north to the 45th parallel. This area included a large section of Canada and the shores of Acadia.

The name Virginia for a region in North America may have been originally suggested by Raleigh, who named it for Queen Elizabeth I in approximately 1584. In addition, the term &quot;Wingandacoa&quot; may have influenced the name Virginia. On his next voyage, Raleigh learned that while the chief of the Secotans was indeed called Wingina, the expression &quot;wingandacoa&quot; heard by the English upon arrival actually meant &quot;What good clothes you wear!&quot; in Carolina Algonquian and was not the name of the country as previously misunderstood.

The colony was also known as the Virginia Colony, the Province of Virginia, and occasionally as the Dominion and Colony of Virginia or His Majesty&#x27;s Most Ancient Colloney and Dominion of Virginia.

=== Old Dominion ===
According to tradition, in gratitude for the loyalty of Virginians to the crown during the English Civil War, Charles II gave it the title of &quot;Old Dominion&quot;. The colony seal stated from Latin &quot;en dat virginia quintum&quot;, in English &#x27;Behold, Virginia gives the fifth&#x27;, with Virginia claimed as the fifth English dominion after England, France, Scotland and Ireland.

The Commonwealth of Virginia maintains &quot;Old Dominion&quot; as its state nickname. The athletic teams of the University of Virginia are known as the &quot;Cavaliers&quot;, referring to supporters of Charles II, and Virginia has a public university called &quot;Old Dominion University&quot;.

== History ==

Although Spain, France, Sweden, and the Netherlands all had competing claims to the region, none of these prevented the English from becoming the first European power to colonize successfully the Mid-Atlantic coastline. The Spanish had made earlier attempts in what is now Georgia (San Miguel de Gualdape, 1526–1527; several Spanish missions in Georgia between 1568 and 1684), South Carolina (Santa Elena, 1566–1587), North Carolina (Joara, 1567–1568) and Virginia (Ajacán Mission, 1570–1571); and by the French in South Carolina (Charlesfort, 1562–1563). Farther south, the Spanish colony of Spanish Florida, centered on St. Augustine, was established in 1565, while to the north, the French were establishing settlements in what is now Canada (Charlesbourg-Royal briefly occupied 1541–1543; Port Royal, established in 1605).

=== Colonization attempts in the New World (1583–1590) ===
In 1583, Sir Humphrey Gilbert established a charter in Newfoundland. Once established, he and his crew abandoned the site and returned to England. On the return trip, Gilbert&#x27;s ship capsized, and all aboard perished. The charter was abandoned.

In 1585, Raleigh sent his first colonization mission to Roanoke Island (in present-day North Carolina) with over 100 male settlers. However, when Sir Francis Drake arrived at the colony in the summer of 1586, the colonists opted to return to England because there was a lack of supply ships, abandoning the colony. Supply ships arrived at the abandoned colony later in 1586; 15 soldiers were left behind to hold the island, but no trace of these men was later found.

In 1587, Raleigh sent another group to attempt to establish a permanent settlement. The expedition leader, John White, returned to England for supplies that same year but was unable to return to the colony because of the war between England and Spain. When he finally did return in 1590, he found the colony abandoned. The houses were intact, but the colonists had disappeared. Although there are numerous theories about the fate of the colony, it remains a mystery and has come to be known as the &quot;Lost Colony&quot;. Two English children were born in this colony; the first was named Virginia Dare (Dare County, North Carolina, was named in her honor), who was among those whose fate is unknown. The word &quot;Croatoan&quot; was found carved into a tree, the name of a tribe on a nearby island.

=== Virginia Company (1606–1624) ===

Following the failure of the previous colonization attempts, England resumed attempts to set up colonies. This time, joint-stock companies were used rather than giving extensive grants to a landed proprietor such as Gilbert or Raleigh.

==== Charter of 1606 ====
King James granted a proprietary charter to two competing branches of the Virginia Company, which investors supported. These were the Plymouth Company and the Virginia Company of London. By the terms of the charter, the Plymouth Company was permitted to establish a colony of between the 38th parallel and the 45th parallel (roughly between Chesapeake Bay and the current U.S.–Canada border). The London Company was permitted to establish between the 34th parallel and the 41st parallel (approximately between Cape Fear and Long Island Sound) and also owned a large portion of Atlantic and Inland Canada. In the area of overlap, the two companies were not permitted to establish colonies within one hundred miles of each other. During 1606, each company organized expeditions to establish settlements within the area of their rights.

The London company formed Jamestown in its exclusive territory, while the Plymouth company formed the Popham Colony in its exclusive territory near what is now Phippsburg, Maine. The Popham colony quickly failed because of famine, disease, and conflicts with local Native American tribes in the first two years.

==== Jamestown ====

The London Company hired Captain Christopher Newport to lead its expedition. On December 20, 1606, he set sail from England with his flagship, the &quot;Susan Constant&quot;, and two smaller ships, the &quot;Godspeed&quot;, and the &quot;Discovery&quot;, with 105 men and boys, plus 39 sailors. After an unusually long voyage of 144 days, they arrived at the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay and came ashore at the point where the southern side of the bay meets the Atlantic Ocean, an event that has come to be called the &quot;First Landing&quot;. They erected a cross and named the point of land Cape Henry in honor of Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, the eldest son of King James.

They were instructed to select a location inland along a waterway where they would be less vulnerable to the Spanish or other Europeans seeking to establish colonies. They sailed westward into the Bay and reached the mouth of Hampton Roads, stopping at a location now known as Old Point Comfort. Keeping the shoreline to their right, they then ventured up the largest river, which they named the James, for their king. After exploring at least as far upriver as the confluence of the Appomattox River at present-day Hopewell, they returned downstream to Jamestown Island, which offered a favorable defensive position against enemy ships and deep water anchorage adjacent to the land. Within two weeks, they had constructed their first fort and named their settlement Jamestown.

In addition to securing gold and other precious minerals to send back to the waiting investors in England, the survival plan for the Jamestown colonists depended upon regular supplies from England and trade with the Native Americans. They selected a location largely cut off from the mainland with little game for hunting, no natural fresh drinking water, and minimal ground for farming. Captain Newport returned to England twice, delivering the first and second supply missions during 1608 and leaving the &quot;Discovery&quot; for the colonists&#x27; use. However, death from disease and conflicts with the Native Americans took a fearsome toll on the colonists. Despite attempts at mining minerals, growing silk, and exporting the native Virginia tobacco, no profitable exports had been identified, and it was unclear whether the settlement would survive financially.

The Powhatan Confederacy was a confederation of numerous linguistically related tribes in the eastern part of Virginia. The Powhatan Confederacy controlled a territory known as Tsenacommacah, which roughly corresponded with the Tidewater region of Virginia. It was in this territory that the English established Jamestown. At the time of the English arrival, the Powhatan were led by the paramount chief Wahunsenacawh, known to the English as Chief Powhatan.

==== Popham Colony ====
On May 31, 1607, about 100 men and boys left England for what is now Maine. Approximately three months later, the group landed on a wooded peninsula where the Kennebec River meets the Atlantic Ocean and began building Fort St. George. By the end of the year, limited resources caused half of the colonists to return to England. The remaining 45 sailed home late the next year, and the Plymouth company fell dormant.

==== Charter of 1609 – the London company expands ====
In 1609, with the abandonment of the Plymouth Company settlement, the London Company&#x27;s Virginia charter was adjusted to include the territory north of the 34th parallel and south of the 40th parallel, with its original coastal grant extended &quot;from sea to sea&quot;. Thus, according to James I&#x27;s writ, the Virginia Colony in its original sense extended to the coast of the Pacific Ocean, in what is now California, with all the land in between belonging to Virginia. For practical purposes, though, the colonists rarely ventured far inland to what was known as the &quot;Virginia Wilderness.&quot;

==== Third supply ====

For the third supply, the London Company had a new ship built. The &quot;Sea Venture&quot; was designed to emit additional colonists and transport supplies. It became the flagship of the admiral of the convoy, Sir George Somers. The third supply was the largest, with eight other ships joining the &quot;Sea Venture&quot;. The captain of the &quot;Sea Venture&quot; was the mission&#x27;s Vice Admiral Christopher Newport. Hundreds of new colonists were aboard the ships. However, the weather was to affect the mission drastically.

A few days out of London, the nine ships of the third supply mission encountered a hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean. They became separated during the three days the storm lasted. Admiral Somers had the &quot;Sea Venture&quot;, carrying most of the mission&#x27;s supplies, deliberately driven aground onto the reefs of Bermuda to avoid sinking. However, while there was no loss of life, the ship was wrecked beyond repair, stranding its survivors on the uninhabited archipelago, to which they laid claim for England.

The survivors at Bermuda eventually built two smaller ships, and most of them continued to Jamestown, leaving a few on Bermuda to secure the claim. The company&#x27;s possession of Bermuda was made official in 1612 when the third and final charter extended the boundaries of Virginia far enough out to sea to encompass Bermuda.

Upon their arrival at Jamestown, the survivors of the &quot;Sea Venture&quot; discovered that the 10-month delay had greatly aggravated other adverse conditions. Seven of the other ships had arrived carrying more colonists but little in the way of food and supplies. Combined with drought and hostile relations with the Native Americans, the loss of the supplies that had been aboard the &quot;Sea Venture&quot; resulted in the Starving Time in late 1609 to May 1610, during which over 80% of the colonists perished. Conditions were so adverse it appears, from skeletal evidence, that the survivors engaged in cannibalism. The survivors from Bermuda had brought few supplies and food with them, and it appeared to all that Jamestown must be abandoned, and it would be necessary to return to England.

==== Abandonment and fourth supply ====
Samuel Argall was the captain of one of the seven ships of the third supply that arrived at Jamestown in 1609 after being separated from the &quot;Sea Venture&quot;, whose fate was unknown. Depositing his passengers and limited supplies, he returned to England with word of the colonists&#x27; plight at Jamestown. The king authorized another leader, Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, later better known as &quot;Lord Delaware&quot;, to have greater powers, and the London Company organized another supply mission. They set sail from London on April 1, 1610.

Just after the survivors of the Starving Time and those who had joined them from Bermuda had abandoned Jamestown, the ships of the new supply mission sailed up the James River with food, supplies, a doctor, and more colonists. Lord Delaware was determined that the colony was to survive, and he intercepted the departing ships about downstream of Jamestown. The colonists thanked Providence for the colony&#x27;s salvation.

West proved far harsher and more belligerent toward the Indians than any of his predecessors, engaging in wars of conquest against them. He first sent Thomas Gates to drive off the Kecoughtan from their village on July 9, 1610, then gave Chief Powhatan an ultimatum to either return all English subjects and property, or face war. Powhatan responded by insisting that the English either stay in their fort or leave Virginia. Enraged, De la Warr had the hand of a Paspahegh captive cut off and sent him to the paramount chief with another ultimatum: Return all English subjects and property, or the neighboring villages would be burned. This time, Powhatan did not respond.

==== First Anglo-Powhatan War (1610–1614) ====
On August 9, 1610, tired of waiting for a response from the Powhatan, West sent George Percy with 70 men to attack the Paspahegh capital, burning the houses and cutting down their cornfields. They killed 65 to 75 Powhatan and captured one of Wowinchopunk&#x27;s wives and her children. Returning downstream, Percy&#x27;s men threw the children overboard and shot out &quot;their Braynes in the water&quot;. The queen was put to the sword in Jamestown. The Paspahegh never recovered from this attack and abandoned their town. Another small force sent with Argall against the Warraskoyaks found that they had already fled, and they destroyed an abandoned Warraskoyak village and the surrounding cornfields. This event triggered the first Anglo-Powhatan War.

Among the individuals who had briefly abandoned Jamestown was John Rolfe, a &quot;Sea Venture&quot; survivor who had lost his wife and son in Bermuda. He was a businessman from London with some untried seeds for new, sweeter strains of tobacco he brought from Bermuda and some novel marketing ideas. It would turn out that Rolfe held the key to the colony&#x27;s economic success. By 1612, Rolfe&#x27;s strains of tobacco had been successfully cultivated and exported, establishing a first cash crop for export. Plantations and new outposts sprung up starting with Henricus, initially both upriver and downriver along the navigable portion of the James and thereafter along the other rivers and waterways of the area. The settlement at Jamestown could finally be considered permanently established. A period of peace followed the marriage in 1614 of colonist Rolfe to Pocahontas, the daughter of Chief Powhatan.

Another colonial charter was issued in 1611.

==== Second Anglo-Powhatan War (1622–1632) ====
The relations with the Natives took a turn for the worse after the death of Pocahontas in England and the return of Rolfe and other colonial leaders in May 1617. Disease, poor harvests, and the growing demand for land to cultivate tobacco caused hostilities to escalate. After Chief Powhatan died in 1618, he was succeeded by his own younger brother, Opechancanough. On the surface, he maintained friendly relations with the English, negotiating with them through his warrior Nemattanew. Still, by 1622, after Nemattanew had been slain, Opechancanough was ready to order a limited surprise attack on the colonists, hoping to persuade them to move on and settle elsewhere.

Chief Opechancanough organized and led a well-coordinated series of surprise attacks on multiple English colonial settlements along both sides of a long stretch of the James River, which took place early on the morning of March 22, 1622. This event resulted in the deaths of 347 colonists (including men, women, and children) and the abduction of many others. The massacre caught most of the Virginia Colony by surprise and virtually wiped out several entire communities, including Henricus and Wolstenholme Towne at Martin&#x27;s Hundred. Jamestown was spared from destruction because an Indian boy named Chanco learned of the planned attacks from his brother and warned colonist Richard Pace with whom he lived. Pace, after securing himself and his neighbors on the south side of the James River, took a canoe across the river to warn Jamestown, which narrowly escaped destruction. However, there was no time to warn the other settlements.

A year later, Captain William Tucker and John Pott worked out a truce with the Powhatan and proposed a toast using liquor laced with poison. 200 Virginia Indians were killed or made ill by the poison, and 50 more were slaughtered by the colonists. For over a decade, the English settlers attacked the Powhatan, targeting their settlements as part of a scorched earth policy. The settlers systematically razed villages, captured children, and seized or destroyed crops.

By 1634, a six-mile-long palisade was completed across the Virginia Peninsula. The palisade provided some security from attacks by the Virginia Indians for colonists farming and fishing lower on the Peninsula from that point. On April 18, 1644, Opechancanough again tried to force the English to abandon the region with another series of coordinated attacks, killing almost 500 colonists. However, this was a smaller proportion of the growing population than had been killed in the 1622 attacks.

=== Crown colony (1624–1652) ===

In 1620, a successor to the Plymouth Company sent colonists to the New World aboard the &quot;Mayflower&quot;. Known as Pilgrims, they successfully established a settlement in what became Massachusetts. The portion of what had been Virginia north of the 40th parallel became known as New England, according to books written by Captain John Smith, who had made a voyage there.

In 1624, the charter of the Virginia Company was revoked by King James I, and the Virginia Colony was transferred to royal authority in the form of a crown colony. Subsequent charters for the Maryland Colony in 1632 and to the eight lords proprietors of the Province of Carolina in 1663 and 1665 further reduced the Virginia Colony to roughly the coastal borders it held until the American Revolution. (The border with North Carolina was disputed until surveyed by William Byrd II in 1728.)
==== Third Anglo-Powhatan War (1644–1646) ====
After twelve years of peace following the Indian Wars of 1622–1632, another Anglo–Powhatan War began on March 18, 1644, as a last effort by the remnants of the Powhatan Confederacy, still under Opechancanough, to dislodge the English settlers of the Virginia Colony. Around 500 colonists were killed, but that number represented a relatively low percentage of the overall population, as opposed to the earlier massacre (the 1622 attack had wiped out a third; that of 1644 barely a tenth).

This was followed by an effort by the settlers to decimate the Powhatan. In July, they marched against the Pamunkey, Chickahominy, and Powhatan proper; and south of the James, against the Appomattoc, Weyanoke, Warraskoyak, and Nansemond, as well as two Carolina tribes, the Chowanoke and Secotan. In February–March 1645, the colony ordered the construction of four frontier forts: Fort Charles at the falls of the James, Fort James on the Chickahominy, Fort Royal at the falls of the York and Fort Henry at the falls of the Appomattox, where the modern city of Petersburg is located.

In August 1645, the forces of Governor William Berkeley stormed Opechancanough&#x27;s stronghold. All captured males in the village over age 11 were deported to Tangier Island. Opechancanough, variously reported to be 92 to 100 years old, was taken to Jamestown. While a prisoner, Opechancanough was shot in the back and killed by a soldier assigned to guard him. His death disintegrated the Powhatan Confederacy into its component tribes, whom the colonists continued to attack.

==== Treaty of 1646 ====

In the peace treaty of October 1646, the &quot;weroance&quot; Necotowance and the subtribes formerly in the confederacy each became tributaries to the King of England. At the same time, a racial frontier was delineated between Indian and English settlements, with members of each group forbidden to cross to the other side except by a special pass obtained at one of the newly erected border forts.

The extent of the Virginia Colony open to patent by English colonists was defined as: All the land between the Blackwater and York rivers, and up to the navigable point of each of the major rivers – which were connected by a straight line running directly from modern Franklin on the Blackwater, northwesterly to the Appomattoc village beside Fort Henry, and continuing in the same direction to the Monocan village above the falls of the James, where Fort Charles was built, then turning sharp right, to Fort Royal on the York (Pamunkey) river. Necotowance thus ceded the English vast tracts of still-uncolonized land, much of it between the James and Blackwater. English settlements on the peninsula north of the York and below the Poropotank were also allowed, as they had already been there since 1640.

=== English Civil War and Commonwealth (1642–1660) ===

While the newer Puritan colonies, most notably Massachusetts, were dominated by Parliamentarians, the older colonies sided with the Crown. The Virginia Company&#x27;s two settlements, Virginia and Bermuda (Bermuda&#x27;s Puritans were expelled as the Eleutheran Adventurers, settling the Bahamas under William Sayle), Antigua and Barbados were conspicuous in their loyalty to the Crown and were singled out by the Rump Parliament in An Act for prohibiting Trade with the Barbadoes, Virginia, Bermuda and Antego in October 1650. This dictated that:
[D]ue punishment [be] inflicted upon the said Delinquents, do[es] Declare all and every the said persons in Barbada&#x27;s, Antego, Bermuda&#x27;s and Virginia, that have contrived, abetted, aided or assisted those horrid Rebellions, or have since willingly joyned with them, to be notorious Robbers and Traitors, and such as by the Law of Nations are not to be permitted any maner of Commerce or Traffique with any people whatsoever; and do[es] forbid to all maner of persons, Foreiners, and others, all maner of Commerce, Traffique and Correspondency whatsoever, to be used or held with the said Rebels in the Barbada&#x27;s, Bermuda&#x27;s, Virginia and Antego, or either of them.

The act authorized Parliamentary privateers to act against English vessels trading with the rebellious colonies: &quot;All Ships that Trade with the Rebels may be surprized. Goods and tackle of such ships not to be embezeled, till judgement in the Admiralty; Two or three of the Officers of every ship to be examined upon oath.&quot;

Virginia&#x27;s population swelled with Cavaliers during and after the English Civil War. Under the tenure of Crown Governor William Berkeley (1642–1652; 1660–1677), the population expanded from 8,000 in 1642 to 40,000 in 1677. Despite the resistance of the Virginia Cavaliers, Virginian Puritan Richard Bennett was made governor answering to Oliver Cromwell in 1652, followed by two more nominal &quot;commonwealth governors&quot;. Nonetheless, the colony was rewarded for its loyalty to the Crown by Charles II following the Stuart Restoration when he dubbed it the &quot;Old Dominion&quot;.

With the Restoration in the English colonies in 1660, the governorship returned to Berkeley. In 1676, Bacon&#x27;s Rebellion challenged the political order of the colony. While a military failure, its handling resulted in Governor Berkeley being recalled to England. In 1679, the Treaty of Middle Plantation was signed between King Charles II and several Native American groups.

=== Williamsburg era ===

Virginia was the most prominent, wealthiest, and most influential of the American colonies, where conservatives controlled the colonial and local governments. At the local level, Church of England parishes handled many local affairs, and they, in turn, were controlled not by the minister but rather by a closed circle of wealthy landowners who comprised the parish vestry. Ronald L. Heinemann emphasizes the ideological conservatism of Virginia while noting some religious dissenters were gaining strength by the 1760s:

In actual practice, colonial Virginia never had a bishop to represent God nor a hereditary aristocracy with titles like &#x27;duke&#x27; or &#x27;baron&#x27;. However, it had a royal governor appointed by the king and a powerful landed gentry. The status quo was strongly reinforced by what Thomas Jefferson called &quot;feudal and unnatural distinctions&quot; that were vital to the maintenance of aristocracy in Virginia. He promoted laws such as entail and primogeniture by which the oldest son inherited all the land. As a result, increasingly large plantations, worked by white tenant farmers and by enslaved Black people, gained in size, wealth, and political power in the eastern (&quot;Tidewater&quot;) tobacco areas. Maryland and South Carolina had similar hierarchical systems, as did New York and Pennsylvania. During the American Revolutionary era, all such laws were repealed by the new states. The most fervent Loyalists left for Canada or Britain or other parts of the British Empire. They introduced primogeniture in Upper Canada in 1792, lasting until 1851. Such laws lasted in England until 1926.

== Relations with Natives ==

As the English expanded out from Jamestown, encroachment of the new arrivals and their ever-growing numbers on what had been Indian lands resulted in several conflicts with the Virginia Indians. For much of the 17th century, English contact and conflict were mainly with the Algonquian peoples that populated the coastal regions, primarily the Powhatan Confederacy. Following a series of wars and the decline of the Powhatan as a political entity, the colonists expanded westward in the late 17th and 18th centuries, encountering the Shawnee, Iroquoian-speaking peoples such as the Nottoway, Meherrin, Iroquois and Cherokee, as well as Siouan-speaking peoples such as the Tutelo, Saponi, and Occaneechi.

=== Iroquois Confederacy ===

As the English settlements expanded beyond the Tidewater territory traditionally occupied by the Powhatan, they encountered new groups with which there had been minimal relations with the colony. In the late 17th century, the Iroquois Confederacy expanded into the western region of Virginia as part of the Beaver Wars. They arrived shortly before the English settlers and displaced the resident Siouan tribes.

Lt. Gov. Alexander Spotswood made further advances in policy with the Virginia Indians along the frontier. In 1714, he established Fort Christanna to help educate and trade with several tribes with which the colony had friendly relations and to help protect them from hostile tribes. In 1722, the Treaty of Albany was signed by leaders of the Five Nations of Iroquois, Province of New York, Colony of Virginia, and Province of Pennsylvania.

== Geography ==

The geography of the Virginia settlement expanded as the boundaries of European colonization extended over time. Its cultural geography gradually evolved, with various settlement and jurisdiction models employed. By the late 17th century and the early 18th century, the primary settlement pattern was based on plantations (to grow tobacco), farms, and some towns (mostly ports or courthouse villages).

=== Early settlements ===
The fort at Jamestown, founded in 1607, remained the primary settlement of the colonists for several years. A few strategic outposts were constructed, including Fort Algernon (1609) at the entrance to the James River. Early attempts to occupy strategic locations already inhabited by natives at what is now Richmond and Suffolk failed owing to native resistance.

A short distance farther up the James, in 1611, Thomas Dale began the construction of a progressive development at Henricus on and about what was later known as Farrar&#x27;s Island. Henricus was envisioned as a possible replacement capital for Jamestown and was to have the first college in Virginia. (The ill-fated Henricus was destroyed during the Indian massacre of 1622). In addition to creating the settlement at Henricus, Dale also established the port town of Bermuda Hundred, as well as &quot;Bermuda Cittie&quot; in 1613, now part of Hopewell, Virginia. He began the excavation work at Dutch Gap, using methods he had learned while serving in Holland.

=== &quot;Hundreds&quot; ===

Once tobacco had been established as an export cash crop, investors became more interested, and groups of them united to create largely self-sufficient &quot;hundreds.&quot; The term &quot;hundred&quot; is a traditional English name for an administrative division of a shire (or county) to define an area that would support one hundred heads of household. In the colonial era in Virginia, the &quot;hundreds&quot; were large developments of many acres, necessary to support tobacco crops. The &quot;hundreds&quot; were required to be at least several miles from any existing community. Soon, these patented tracts of land sprang up along the rivers. The investors sent shiploads of settlers and supplies to Virginia to establish the new developments. The administrative centers of Virginia&#x27;s hundreds were essentially small towns or villages and were often palisaded for defense.

An example was Martin&#x27;s Hundred, located downstream from Jamestown on the north bank of the James River. The Martin&#x27;s Hundred Society, a group of investors in London, sponsored it. It was settled in 1618, and Wolstenholme Towne was its administrative center, named for John Wolstenholme, one of the investors.

Bermuda Hundred (now in Chesterfield County) and Flowerdew Hundred (now in Prince George County) are other names which have survived over centuries. Others included Berkeley Hundred, Bermuda Nether Hundred, Bermuda Upper Hundred, Smith&#x27;s Hundred, Digges Hundred, West Hundred, and Shirley Hundred (and, in Bermuda, &quot;Harrington Hundreds&quot;). Including the creation of the &quot;hundreds&quot;, the various incentives to investors in the Virginia Colony finally paid off by 1617. By this time, the colonists were exporting 50,000 pounds of tobacco to England per year and were beginning to generate enough profit to ensure the economic survival of the colony.

=== Cities, shires, and counties ===

In 1619, the plantations and developments were divided into four &quot;incorporations&quot; or &quot;citties&quot;, as they were called. These were Charles Cittie, Elizabeth Cittie, Henrico Cittie, and James Cittie, which included the relatively small seat of government for the colony at Jamestown Island. Each of the four &quot;citties&quot; (sic) extended across the James River, the main conduit of transportation of the era. Elizabeth Cittie, known initially as Kecoughtan (a Native word with many variations in spelling by the English), also included the areas now known as South Hampton Roads and the Eastern Shore.

In 1634, a local government system was created in the Virginia Colony by order of the King of England. Eight shires were designated, each with local officers. Within a few years, the shires were renamed counties, a system that has remained to the present day.

=== Later settlements ===
In 1630, under the governorship of John Harvey, the first settlement on the York River was founded. In 1632, the Virginia legislature voted to build a fort to link Jamestown and the York River settlement of Chiskiack and protect the colony from Indian attacks. In 1634, a palisade was built near Middle Plantation. This wall stretched across the peninsula between the York and James rivers and protected the settlements on the eastern side of the lower peninsula from Indians. The wall also served to contain cattle.

In 1699, a capital was established and built at Middle Plantation, soon renamed Williamsburg.
=== Northern Neck Proprietary ===

In the period following the English Civil War, the exiled King Charles II hoped to shore up the loyalty of several of his supporters by granting them a significant area of mostly uncharted land to control as a proprietary in Virginia (a claim that would only be valid were the king to return to power). While under the jurisdiction of the Virginia Colony, the proprietary maintained complete control of the granting of land within that territory (and revenues obtained from it) until after the American Revolution. The grant was for the land between the Rappahannock and Potomac Rivers, which included the titular Northern Neck, but as time went on, also would include all of what is today Northern Virginia and into West Virginia. Due to ambiguities of the text of the various grants causing disputes between the proprietary and the colonial government, the tract was finally demarcated via the Fairfax Line in 1746.

== Government and law ==
In the initial years under the Virginia Company, the colony was governed by a council, headed by a council president. From 1611 to 1618, under the orders of Sir Thomas Dale, the settlers of the colony were under a regime of civil law that became known as Dale&#x27;s Code. Under a charter from the company in 1618, a new model of governance was put in place in 1619, which created a House of Burgesses. On July 30, 1619, burgesses met at Jamestown Church as the first elected representative legislative assembly in the New World. The legal system in the colony was thereafter based on the provisions of its royal charter and English common law.

For much of the history of the royal colony, the formally appointed governor was absentee, often remaining in England. In his stead, a series of acting or lieutenant governors who were physically present held actual authority. In the later years of its history, as it became increasingly civilized, more governors made the journey.

The first settlement in the colony, Jamestown, served as the capital and main port of entry from its founding until 1699. During this time, a series of statehouses (capitols) were used and subsequently consumed by fires (accidental and intentional in the case of Bacon&#x27;s Rebellion). Following such a fire, in 1699, the capital was relocated inland, away from the swampy clime of Jamestown, to Middle Plantation, renamed Williamsburg. The capital of Virginia remained in Williamsburg until it was moved further inland to Richmond in 1779 during the American Revolution.

== Economy ==

The entrepreneurs of the Virginia Company experimented with several means of making the colony profitable. The orders sent with the first colonists instructed that they search for precious metals (specifically gold). While no gold was found, various products were sent back, including pitch and clapboard. In 1608, early attempts were made at breaking the Continental hold on glassmaking through the creation of a glassworks. In 1619, the colonists built the first ironworks in North America.

In 1612, settler John Rolfe planted tobacco obtained from Bermuda (during his stay there as part of the third supply). Within a few years, the crop proved extremely lucrative in the European market. As the English increasingly used tobacco products, the production of tobacco in the American colonies became a significant economic driver, especially in the tidewater region surrounding the Chesapeake Bay. From 1616 to 1619, the only exports of the colony were tobacco and sassafras.

Colonists developed plantations along the rivers of Virginia, and social/economic systems developed to grow and distribute this cash crop. Some elements of this system included the importation and use of enslaved Africans to cultivate and process crops, which included harvesting and drying periods. Planters would have their workers fill large hogsheads with tobacco and convey them to inspection warehouses. In 1730, the Virginia House of Burgesses standardized and improved the quality of tobacco exported by establishing the Tobacco Inspection Act of 1730, which required inspectors to grade tobacco at 40 specified locations.

== Culture ==
===Population===
=== Ethnic origins ===
England supplied most colonists; a later migration of Scots-Irish filled the backcountry. The Virginia Colony was always predominantly British in ethnic descent, with only minor contributions from other ethnic groups, particularly Palatinate Germans. In 1608, the first Poles and Slovaks arrived as part of a group of skilled craftsmen. In 1619, the first Africans arrived. Many more Africans were imported as enslaved people, such as Angela. In the early 17th century, French Huguenots arrived in the colony as refugees from religious warfare.

In the early 18th century, indentured German-speaking colonists from the iron-working region of Nassau-Siegen arrived to establish the Germanna settlement. Scots-Irish settled on the Virginia frontier. Some Welsh arrived, including some ancestors of Thomas Jefferson.

=== Servitude and slavery ===

With the boom in tobacco planting, there was a severe shortage of laborers to work the labor-intensive crop. One method to solve the shortage was using indentured servants.

By the 1640s, legal documents started to define indentured servants&#x27; changing nature and status as servants. In 1640, John Punch was sentenced to lifetime servitude as punishment for trying to escape from his enslaver, Hugh Gwyn. This is the earliest legal sanctioning of slavery in Virginia. After this trial, the relationship between indentured servants and their masters changed, as planters saw permanent servitude a more appealing and profitable prospect than seven-year indentures.

As many indentured workers were illiterate, especially Africans, there were opportunities for abuse by planters and other indenture holders. Some ignored the expiration of servants&#x27; indentured contracts and tried to keep them as lifelong workers. One example is with Anthony Johnson, who argued with Robert Parker, another planter, over the status of John Casor, formerly an indentured servant of his. Johnson argued that his indenture was for life and Parker had interfered with his rights. The court ruled in favor of Johnson and ordered that Casor be returned to him, where he served the rest of his life as an enslaved person. Such documented cases marked the transformation of Black Africans from indentured servants into slaves.

In the late 17th century, the Royal African Company, which the King of England established to supply the great demand for labor to the colonies, had a monopoly on providing enslaved Africans to the colony. As plantation agriculture was established earlier in Barbados, in the early years, enslaved people were shipped from Barbados (where they were seasoned) to the colonies of Virginia and Carolina.

=== Religion ===

In 1619, the Anglican Church was formally established as the official religion in the colony and would remain so until shortly after the American Revolution. Establishment meant that local tax funds paid the parish costs and that the parish had local civic functions such as poor relief. The upper-class planters controlled the vestry, which ran the parish and chose the minister. The church in Virginia was controlled by the Bishop of London, who sent priests and missionaries, but there were never enough, and they reported deficient standards of personal morality. By the 1760s, dissenting Protestants, especially Baptists and Methodists, were proliferating and started challenging the Anglicans for moral leadership.

All 26 churches with regular services in Virginia in 1650 were Anglican, which included all but 4 of the 30 Anglican churches in the colonies at the time (with the remainder located in Maryland). Following the First Great Awakening (1730–1755), the number of regular places of worship in Virginia grew to 126 in 1750 (96 Anglican, 17 Presbyterian, 5 Lutheran, 5 German Reformed, and 3 Baptist), with the colony gaining an additional 251 regular places of worship to a total of 377 by 1776 (101 Baptist, 95 Presbyterian, 94 Episcopal, 42 Friends, 17 Lutheran, 14 German Reformed, 10 Methodism, 2 German Baptist Brethren, and 2 Mennonite).

=== Education and literacy ===

The first printing press used in Virginia began operation in Jamestown on June 8, 1680, though within a few years, it was shut down by the Governor and Crown of England for want of a license. It was not until 1736 that the first newspaper, the &quot;Virginia Gazette&quot;, began circulation under printer William Parks of Williamsburg.

The Syms-Eaton Academy, started in 1634, became America&#x27;s first free public school. Private tutors were often favored among those families who could afford them.

For most of the 17th century, a university education for settlers of Virginia required a journey to England or Scotland. Such journeys were undertaken by wealthy young men. In the early years, many settlers received their education before immigrating to the colony.

In 1693, the College of William &amp; Mary was founded at Middle Plantation (soon renamed Williamsburg). The college included a common school for Virginia Indians, supplemented by local pupils, which lasted until a 1779 overhaul of the institution&#x27;s curriculum. The college, located in the capital and heart of the Tidewater region, dominated the colony&#x27;s intellectual climate until after independence.

After 1747, some Virginians began to attend institutions at Princeton and Philadelphia. Generations began to move west into the Piedmont and Blue Ridge areas. In this region of Virginia, two future Presbyterian colleges trace their origins to lower-level institutions founded in this period. First, what would become Hampden–Sydney College was founded in 1775, before the American Revolution. Likewise, Augusta Academy was a classical school that would evolve into Washington and Lee University (though it would not grant its first bachelor&#x27;s degree until 1785).

<text>Gangs of New York is a 2002 American epic historical drama film directed by Martin Scorsese and written by Jay Cocks, Steven Zaillian, and Kenneth Lonergan, based on Herbert Asbury&#x27;s 1928 book &quot;The Gangs of New York&quot;. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day-Lewis, and Cameron Diaz, along with Jim Broadbent, John C. Reilly, Henry Thomas, Stephen Graham, Eddie Marsan, Brendan Gleeson, and Liam Neeson in supporting roles. The film also marks the start of a collaboration between DiCaprio and Scorsese.

The film is set in 1863, when a long-running Catholic–Protestant feud erupts into violence, just as an Irish immigrant group is protesting the threat of conscription during the Civil War. Scorsese spent 20 years developing the project until Miramax Films acquired it in 1999. Principal photography took place in Cinecittà, Rome and Long Island City, New York City.

&quot;Gangs of New York&quot; was completed by 2001 but its release was delayed due to the September 11 attacks. The film was theatrically released in the United States on December 20, 2002, and grossed $193.8 million worldwide. It was met with generally positive reviews and Day-Lewis&#x27;s performance was highly acclaimed. It received 10 nominations at the 75th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director for Scorsese and Best Actor for Day-Lewis.

==Plot==

In the 1846 slum of the Five Points, two rival gangs, the Anglo-Protestant Confederation of American Natives, led by William &quot;Bill the Butcher&quot; Cutting, and the Irish Catholic immigrant Dead Rabbits, led by &quot;Priest&quot; Vallon, engage in their final battle to determine which faction will hold sway over the territory. At the end of the fight, Bill kills Vallon and declares the Dead Rabbits outlawed. Having witnessed this, Vallon&#x27;s young son hides the knife that killed his father and is taken to an orphanage on Blackwell&#x27;s Island.

Sixteen years later in 1862, Vallon&#x27;s son, &quot;Amsterdam&quot; returns to the Five Points seeking revenge and retrieves the knife. An old acquaintance, Johnny Sirocco, familiarizes him with the local clans of gangs, all of whom pay tribute to Bill, who remains in control of the territory. Amsterdam is introduced to Bill but keeps his past a secret as he seeks recruitment into the gang. He learns many of his father&#x27;s former lieutenants are now in Bill&#x27;s employ, despite his deep anti-Irish views. Each year, Bill celebrates the anniversary of his victory over the Dead Rabbits and Amsterdam secretly plans to kill him publicly during this celebration. Amsterdam soon becomes attracted to pickpocket and grifter Jenny Everdeane, with whom Johnny is also infatuated. Amsterdam gains Bill&#x27;s confidence and becomes his protégé, involving him in the dealings of corrupt Tammany Hall politician William M. Tweed. Amsterdam saves Bill from an assassination attempt and is tormented by the thought that he may have done so out of honest devotion.

On the evening of the anniversary, Johnny, in a fit of jealousy over Jenny&#x27;s affection for Amsterdam, reveals Amsterdam&#x27;s true identity and intentions to Bill. Bill baits Amsterdam with a knife throwing act involving Jenny. As Bill toasts Priest Vallon, Amsterdam throws his knife, but Bill deflects it and wounds Amsterdam with a counter throw. Bill then beats him and burns his cheek with a hot blade before banishing him, believing Amsterdam to not be worthy of death. Going into hiding, Jenny implores him to escape with her to San Francisco. Amsterdam, however, returns to the Five Points seeking vengeance and announces his return by hanging a dead rabbit in Paradise Square in front of several Irish gangs that were allied with the Dead Rabbits indicating that the gang has returned. Bill sends corrupt Irish policeman and former Dead Rabbit Mulraney to investigate, but Amsterdam garrotes him to death and hangs his body in the square. In retaliation, Bill has Johnny beaten and run through with a pike, leaving it to Amsterdam to end his suffering. When Amsterdam&#x27;s gang beats McGloin, a former Dead Rabbit and one of Bill&#x27;s lieutenants, Bill and the Natives march on the church and are met by Amsterdam and the Dead Rabbits. No violence ensues, but Bill promises to return soon. The incident garners newspaper coverage, and Amsterdam presents Tweed with a plan to defeat Bill&#x27;s influence: Tweed will back the candidacy of Monk McGinn for sheriff and Amsterdam will secure the Irish vote for Tammany. Monk wins in a landslide, and a humiliated Bill murders him with his own club. McGinn&#x27;s death prompts an angry Amsterdam to challenge Bill to a gang battle in Paradise Square, which Bill accepts.

The Civil War draft riots break out just as the gangs are preparing to fight, and Union Army soldiers are deployed to control the rioters. As the rival gangs fight, cannon fire from ships is directed into Paradise Square, interrupting their battle shortly before it begins. Many of the gang members are killed by the naval gunfire, soldiers, or rioters. Bill and Amsterdam face off against one another until Bill is wounded by shrapnel. Finally, Amsterdam uses his father&#x27;s knife to kill Bill. Bill passes away holding hands with Amsterdam. 

Amsterdam buries the knife next to his father in a cemetery in Brooklyn, erecting a makeshift headstone with the name William Cutting over it now alongside the actual tombstone of Priest Vallon. As Amsterdam and Jenny leave, the skyline changes as modern New York City is built over the next century, from the Brooklyn Bridge to the Empire State Building to the World Trade Center, and the cemetery becomes overgrown and forgotten.

==Cast==
==Production==
Martin Scorsese had grown up in Little Italy in the borough of Manhattan in New York City during the 1950s. At the time, he had noticed there were parts of his neighborhood that were much older than the rest, including tombstones from the 1810s in Old St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, cobblestone streets and small basements located under more recent large buildings; this sparked Scorsese&#x27;s curiosity about the history of the area: &quot;I gradually realized that the Italian-Americans weren&#x27;t the first ones there, that other people had been there before us. As I began to understand this, it fascinated me. I kept wondering, how did New York look? What were the people like? How did they walk, eat, work, dress?&quot;

===Development===
In 1970, Scorsese came across Herbert Asbury&#x27;s book &quot;The Gangs of New York: An Informal History of the Underworld&quot; (1927) about the city&#x27;s nineteenth-century criminal underworld and found it to be a revelation. In the portraits of the city&#x27;s criminals, Scorsese saw the potential for an American epic about the battle for the modern American democracy. Scorsese immediately contacted his friend Jay Cocks, a film critic for &quot;Time&quot; magazine. &quot;Think of it like a western in outer space,&quot; Scorsese had told him. Cocks recalled they had considered Malcolm McDowell in the lead role and framing the narrative with quotations from Bruce Springsteen, but otherwise they intended to keep the period vernacular authentic. At the time, Scorsese was a young director without prestige; by the end of the decade, with the success of crime films such as &quot;Mean Streets&quot; (1973), about his old neighborhood, and &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; (1976), he was a rising star. In June 1977, producer Alberto Grimaldi ran a two-page ad in &quot;Daily Variety&quot;, announcing the film&#x27;s production with Scorsese set to direct. That same year, Scorsese and Cocks wrote the first draft, but Scorsese decided to direct &quot;Raging Bull&quot; (1980) instead.

In 1979, Scorsese acquired the screen rights to Asbury&#x27;s book; however, it took twenty years to get the production moving forward. Difficulties arose with reproducing the monumental cityscape of nineteenth-century New York with the style and detail Scorsese wanted; almost nothing in New York City looked as it did in that time, and filming elsewhere was not an option. In 1991, Grimaldi and Scorsese resumed development on the project with Universal Pictures on a budget of $30 million. At one point, Robert De Niro was set to portray Bill the Butcher. However, Universal transferred the rights to the project to Disney in 1997, whose then-chairman Joe Roth turned down the film due to its excessive violence, which was &quot;not appropriate for a Disney-themed movie&quot;.

Scorsese took the film to Warner Bros., being contractually obligated to make a film for the studio; the film was however declined by Warner Bros. as well, and afterward declined similarly by 20th Century Fox, Paramount Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). Eventually, in 1999, Scorsese was able to find a partnership with Harvey Weinstein, noted producer and co-chairman of Miramax Films. As the film had a large budget of nearly $100 million, Weinstein then sold international distribution rights to the project to Graham King&#x27;s Initial Entertainment Group for about $65 million to secure the required funds. Shortly after, Touchstone Pictures joined Miramax Films in funding the film, in exchange for a portion of the proceeds from domestic distribution. That same year, Cocks was retained by Scorsese for the screenplay adaptation, which underwent nine revised drafts. However, Weinstein was not pleased with the shooting script and wanted other screenwriters brought in for more rewrites. To placate Weinstein, Scorsese called Cocks into a room and fired him. Telling &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, Cocks recalled the situation: &quot;You ever been fired? It&#x27;s terrible. Terrible. Even if it&#x27;s a job you don&#x27;t like, it pisses you off, right? Well you can extrapolate from that, exponentially.&quot; Due to this, the final shooting script was not fully completed when filming began. Hossein Amini was hired and wrote the last two drafts, but he was uncredited for his work.

===Set design===
In order to create the sets that Scorsese envisioned, the production was filmed at the large Cinecittà Studio in Rome, Italy. Production designer Dante Ferretti recreated over a mile of mid-nineteenth century New York buildings, consisting of a five-block area of Lower Manhattan, including the Five Points slum, a section of the East River waterfront including two full-sized sailing ships, a thirty-building stretch of lower Broadway, a patrician mansion, and replicas of Tammany Hall, a church, a saloon, a Chinese theater, and a gambling casino. For the Five Points, Ferretti recreated George Catlin&#x27;s 1827 painting of the area.

===Rehearsals and character development===
Particular attention was also paid to the speech of characters, as loyalties were often revealed by their accents. The film&#x27;s voice coach, Tim Monich, resisted using a generic Irish brogue and instead focused on distinctive dialects of Ireland and Great Britain. As DiCaprio&#x27;s character was born in Ireland but raised in the United States, his accent was designed to be a blend of accents typical of the half-Americanized. To develop the unique, lost accents of the Yankee &quot;Nativists&quot; such as Daniel Day-Lewis&#x27;s character, Monich studied old poems, ballads, newspaper articles (which sometimes imitated spoken dialect as a form of humor) and the &quot;Rogue&#x27;s Lexicon&quot;, a book of underworld idioms compiled by New York&#x27;s police commissioner, so that his men would be able to tell what criminals were talking about. An important piece was an 1892 wax cylinder recording of Walt Whitman reciting four lines of a poem in which he pronounced the word &quot;Earth&quot; as &quot;Uth&quot;, and the &quot;a&quot; of &quot;an&quot; nasal and flat, like &quot;ayan&quot;. Monich concluded that native nineteenth-century New Yorkers probably sounded something like the proverbial Brooklyn cabbie of the mid-20th century.

===Filming===

Principal photography began in New York and Rome on December 18, 2000, and ended on March 30, 2001. Due to the strong personalities and clashing visions of director and producer, the three-year production became a story in and of itself. Scorsese strongly defended his artistic vision on issues of taste and length while Weinstein fought for a streamlined, more commercial version. During the delays, noted actors such as Robert De Niro and Willem Dafoe had to leave the production due to conflicts with their other productions. Costs overshot the original budget by 25 percent, bringing the total cost over $100 million. The increased budget made the film vital to Miramax Films&#x27; short-term success.

===Post-production and distribution===
After post-production was nearly completed in 2001, the film was delayed for over a year. The official justification was after the September 11 attacks, certain elements of the picture may have made audiences uncomfortable; the film&#x27;s closing shot is a view of modern-day New York City, complete with the World Trade Center&#x27;s towers, despite them having been destroyed by the attacks over a year before the film&#x27;s release. However, this explanation was refuted in Scorsese&#x27;s own contemporary statements, where he noted that the production was still filming pick-ups even into October 2002. The filmmakers had also considered having the towers dissolved out from the shot to acknowledge their disappearance, or remove the entire sequence altogether. It was ultimately decided to keep the towers unaltered.

Weinstein kept demanding cuts to the film&#x27;s length, and some of those cuts were eventually made. In December 2001, film critic Jeffrey Wells reviewed a purported workprint of the film as it existed in the fall of 2001. Wells reported the work print lacked narration, was about 20 minutes longer, and although it was &quot;different than the [theatrical] version ... scene after scene after scene play[s] exactly the same in both.&quot; Despite the similarities, Wells found the work print to be richer and more satisfying than the theatrical version. While Scorsese has stated the theatrical version is his final cut, he reportedly &quot;passed along [the] three-hour-plus [work print] version of &quot;Gangs&quot; on tape [to friends] and confided, &#x27;Putting aside my contractual obligation to deliver a shorter, two-hour-and-forty-minute version to Miramax, this is the version I&#x27;m happiest with,&#x27; or words to that effect.&quot;

In an interview with Roger Ebert, Scorsese clarified the real issues in the cutting of the film. Ebert notes,
===Soundtrack===
Robbie Robertson supervised the soundtrack&#x27;s collection of eclectic pop, folk, and neo-classical tracks. The score is by Howard Shore. The rest of the selections included on the soundtrack album are a mix of contemporary pop and world music compositions and tunes from mid-nineteenth century Ireland.

==Historical accuracy==
Scorsese received both praise and criticism for historical depictions in the film. In a PBS interview for the History News Network, George Washington University Professor Tyler Anbinder said that the visuals and discrimination against immigrants in the film were historically accurate, but both the amount of violence depicted and the number of Chinese, particularly female, immigrants were greater in the film than in reality.

Asbury&#x27;s book described the Bowery Boys, Plug Uglies, True Blue Americans, Shirt Tails, and Dead Rabbits, who were named after their battle standard, a dead rabbit on a pike. The book also described William Poole, the inspiration for William &quot;Bill the Butcher&quot; Cutting, a member of the Bowery Boys, a bare-knuckle boxer, and a leader of the Know Nothing political movement. Poole did not come from the Five Points and was assassinated nearly a decade before the Draft Riots. Both the fictional Bill and the real one had butcher shops, but Poole is not known to have killed anyone.

Anbinder said that Scorsese&#x27;s recreation of the visual environment of mid-19th-century New York City and the Five Points &quot;couldn&#x27;t have been much better&quot;. All sets were built completely on the exterior stages of Cinecittà Studios in Rome.

As early as 1839, Mayor Philip Hone said: &quot;This city is infested by gangs of hardened wretches&quot; who &quot;patrol the streets making night hideous and insulting all who are not strong enough to defend themselves.&quot; The large gang fight depicted in the film as occurring in 1846 is fictional, though there was one between the Bowery Boys and Dead Rabbits in the Five Points on July 4, 1857, which is not mentioned in the film. Reviewer Vincent DiGirolamo concludes that &quot;&quot;Gangs of New York&quot; becomes a historical epic with no change over time. The effect is to freeze ethno-cultural rivalries over the course of three decades and portray them as irrational ancestral hatreds unaltered by demographic shifts, economic cycles and political realignments.&quot;

In the film, the Draft Riots of July 1863 are depicted as both destructive and violent. Records indicate the riots resulted in more than one hundred deaths, including the lynching of 11 free African-Americans. They were especially targeted by the Irish, in part because of fears of job competition that more freed slaves would cause in the city. The bombardment of the city by Navy ships offshore to quell the riots is wholly fictitious. The film references the infamous Tweed Courthouse, as &quot;Boss&quot; Tweed refers to plans for the structure as being &quot;modest&quot; and &quot;economical&quot;.

In the film, Chinese Americans were common enough in the city to have their own community and public venues. Although Chinese people migrated to America as early as the 1840s, significant Chinese migration to New York City did not begin until 1869, the time when the transcontinental railroad was completed. The Chinese theater on Pell St. was not finished until the 1890s. The Old Brewery, the overcrowded tenement shown in the movie in both 1846 and 1862–63, was actually demolished in 1852.

==Release==
The original target release date was December 21, 2001, in time for the 2001 Academy Awards but the production overshot that goal as Scorsese was still filming. A twenty-minute clip, billed as an &quot;extended preview&quot;, debuted at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival and was shown at a star-studded event at the Palais des Festivals et des Congrès with Scorsese, DiCaprio, Diaz and Weinstein in attendance.

Harvey Weinstein then wanted the film to open on December 25, 2002, but a potential conflict with another film starring Leonardo DiCaprio, &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; produced by DreamWorks, caused him to move the opening day to an earlier position. After negotiations between several parties, including the interests of DiCaprio, Weinstein and DreamWorks&#x27; Jeffrey Katzenberg, the decision was made on economic grounds: DiCaprio did not want to face a conflict of promoting two movies opening against each other; Katzenberg was able to convince Weinstein that the violence and adult material in &quot;Gangs of New York&quot; would not necessarily attract families on Christmas. Of main concern to all involved was attempting to maximize the film&#x27;s opening day, an important part of film industry economics.

After three years in production, the film was released on December 20, 2002, a year after its original planned release date. While the film has been released on DVD and Blu-ray, there are no plans to revisit the theatrical cut or prepare a &quot;director&#x27;s cut&quot; for home video release. &quot;Marty doesn&#x27;t believe in that&quot;, editor Thelma Schoonmaker stated. &quot;He believes in showing only the finished film.&quot;

&quot;Gangs of New York&quot; was released on VHS and a 2-disc DVD on July 1, 2003 by Buena Vista Home Entertainment (under the Miramax Home Entertainment label), the film was split on both discs. A Blu-ray version of the film was released July 1, 2008.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film made $77,812,000 in Canada and the United States. It also took $23,763,699 in Japan and $16,358,580 in the United Kingdom. Worldwide the film grossed a total of $193,772,504.

Losses by Miramax Films were offset that year by the success of &quot;Chicago&quot; (2002), the musical, whose domestic box office zoomed to $170 million and which captured a Best Picture Oscar. Although Harvey Weinstein said Miramax Films lost no money on &quot;Gangs of New York&quot;, an internal Disney memo reported that the true bottom line for &quot;Gangs of New York&quot; is that it lost $6 million.

===Critical reception===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Gangs of New York&quot; has an approval rating of 72% based on 212 reviews, with an average rating of 7.10/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Though flawed, the sprawling, messy &quot;Gangs of New York&quot; is redeemed by impressive production design and Day-Lewis&#x27;s electrifying performance.&quot; Metacritic gave the film a score of 72 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert praised the film but believed it fell short of Scorsese&#x27;s best work, while his &quot;At the Movies&quot; co-host Richard Roeper called it a &quot;masterpiece&quot; and declared it a leading contender for Best Picture. Paul Clinton of CNN called the film &quot;a grand American epic&quot;. In &quot;Variety&quot;, Todd McCarthy wrote that the film &quot;falls somewhat short of great film status, but is still a richly impressive and densely realized work that bracingly opens the eye and mind to untaught aspects of American history.&quot; McCarthy singled out the meticulous attention to historical detail and production design for particular praise.

Some critics were disappointed with the film, with one review on CinemaBlend feeling it was overly violent with few characters worth caring about. Others felt it tried to tackle too many themes without saying anything unique about them, and that the overall story was weak.

Cameron Diaz&#x27;s divisive performance as Irish immigrant pickpocket Jenny Everdeane has been cited as an example of poor casting and, along with DiCaprio, one of the worst Irish accents in film.

<text>A pasty () or Cornish pasty is a British baked pastry, a variety of which is particularly associated with Cornwall, but has spread all over the British Isles, and elsewhere through the Cornish diaspora. It consists of a filling, typically meat and vegetables, baked in a folded and crimped shortcrust pastry circle.

The traditional Cornish pasty, which since 2011 has had Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) status in Europe, is filled with beef, sliced or diced potato, swede (also known as yellow turnip or rutabaga – referred to in Cornwall and other parts of the West Country as turnip) and onion, seasoned with salt and pepper, and baked. Today, the pasty is the food most associated with Cornwall. It is a traditional dish and accounts for 6% of the Cornish food economy. Pasties with many different fillings are made, and some shops specialise in selling pasties.

The origins of the pasty are unclear, though there are many references to them throughout historical documents and fiction. The pasty is now popular worldwide because of the spread of Cornish miners and sailors from across Cornwall, and variations can be found in Australia, Mexico, the United States, Ulster and elsewhere.

==History==
Despite the modern pasty&#x27;s strong association with Cornwall, its origins are unclear. The English word &quot;pasty&quot; derives from Medieval French (O.Fr. &quot;paste&quot; from V.Lat &quot;pasta&quot;) for a pie, filled with venison, salmon or other meat, vegetables or cheese, baked without a dish. Pasties have been mentioned in cookbooks throughout the ages. For example, the earliest version of Guillaume Tirel&#x27;s cookbook &quot;Le Viandier&quot;, which has been dated to , contains several pasty recipes. In 1393, &quot;Le Ménagier de Paris&quot; contains recipes for &quot;pasté&quot; with venison, veal, beef or mutton.

Other early references to pasties include a charter that was granted by King John of England to the town of Great Yarmouth in 1208. The town was bound to send to the sheriffs of Norwich every year &quot;one hundred herrings, baked in twenty four pasties&quot;, which the sheriffs delivered to the lord of the manor of East Carlton who then conveyed them to the king. Around the same time, 13th-century chronicler Matthew Paris wrote of the monks of St Albans Abbey &quot;according to their custom, lived upon pasties of flesh-meat&quot;. In 1465, 5,500 venison pasties were served at the installation feast of George Neville, archbishop of York and chancellor of England. The earliest reference for a pasty in Devon or Cornwall can be found in Plymouth city records of 1509/10, which describe &quot;Itm for the cooke is labor to make the pasties 10d&quot;. They were even eaten by royalty, as a letter from a baker to Henry VIII&#x27;s third wife Jane Seymour confirms: &quot;...hope this pasty reaches you in better condition than the last one ...&quot; In his diaries written in the mid-17th century, Samuel Pepys makes several references to his consumption of pasties, for instance &quot;dined at Sir W. Pen&#x27;s ... on a damned venison pasty, that stunk like a devil&quot;, but after this period the use of the word outside Devon and Cornwall declined.

In contrast to its earlier place amongst the wealthy, during the 17th and 18th centuries, the pasty became popular with working people in Cornwall and west Devon, where tin miners and others adopted it because of its unique shape, forming a complete meal that could be carried easily and eaten without cutlery. In a mine, the pasty&#x27;s dense, folded pastry could stay warm for several hours, and if it did get cold, it could easily be warmed on a shovel over a candle.

Side-crimped pasties gave rise to the suggestion that the miner might have eaten the pasty holding the thick edge of pastry, which was later discarded, thereby ensuring that dirty fingers (possibly including traces of arsenic) did not touch the food or mouth. However, many old photographs show that pasties were wrapped in bags made of paper or muslin and were eaten from end to end; according to the earliest Cornish recipe book, published in 1929, this is &quot;the true Cornish way&quot; to eat a pasty. Another theory suggests that pasties were marked at one end with an initial and then eaten from the other end so that if not finished in one sitting, they could easily be reclaimed by their owners.

==Cornish pasty==
The pasty is regarded as the national dish of Cornwall, and an early reference is from a New Zealand newspaper: The term &quot;Cornish pasty&quot; has been in use since at least the early 1860s:

By the late 19th century, national cookery schools began to teach their pupils to create their own version of a &quot;Cornish pasty&quot; that was smaller and was to be eaten as an &quot;economical savoury nibble for polite middle-class Victorians&quot;.

On 20 July 2011, after a nine-year campaign by the Cornish Pasty Association (CPA) – the trade organisation of about 50 pasty makers based in Cornwall – the name &quot;Cornish pasty&quot; was awarded Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) status by the European Commission. According to the PGI status, a Cornish pasty should be shaped like a &#x27;D&#x27; and crimped on one side, not on the top. Its ingredients should include beef, swede (called turnip in Cornwall), potato and onion, with a light seasoning of salt and pepper, keeping a chunky texture. The pastry should be golden and retain its shape when cooked and cooled. The PGI status also means that Cornish pasties must be prepared in Cornwall. They do not have to be baked in Cornwall, nor do the ingredients have to come from the county, though the CPA notes that there are strong links between pasty production and local suppliers of the ingredients. Packaging for pasties that conform to the requirements includes an authentication stamp, the use of which is policed by the CPA.

Producers outside Cornwall objected to the PGI award, with one saying &quot;[EU bureaucrats could] go to hell&quot;, and another that it was &quot;protectionism for some big pasty companies to churn out a pastiche of the real iconic product&quot;. Major UK supermarkets Asda and Morrisons both stated they would be affected by the change, as did nationwide bakery chain Greggs, though Greggs was one of seven companies allowed to continue to use the name &quot;Cornish pasty&quot; during a three-year transitional period.

Members of the CPA made about 87 million pasties in 2008, amounting to sales of £60 million (about 6% of the food economy of Cornwall). In 2011, over 1,800 permanent staff were employed by members of the CPA and some 13,000 other jobs benefited from the trade. Surveys by the South West tourism board have shown that one of the top three reasons people visit Cornwall is the food and that the Cornish pasty is the food most associated with Cornwall.

==Definition and ingredients==

The recipe for a Cornish pasty, as defined by its protected status, includes diced or minced beef, onion, potato and swede in rough chunks along with some &quot;light peppery&quot; seasoning. The cut of beef used is generally skirt steak. Swede is sometimes called turnip in Cornwall, but the recipe requires use of actual swede, not turnip. Pasty ingredients are usually seasoned with salt and pepper, depending on individual taste. 

The type of pastry used is not defined, as long as it is golden in colour and will not crack during the cooking or cooling, although modern pasties almost always use a shortcrust pastry. There is a humorous belief that the pastry on a good pasty should be strong enough to withstand a drop down a mine shaft, and indeed the barley flour that was usually used does make hard dense pastry.

===Variations===
Although the officially protected Cornish pasty has a specific ingredients list, old Cornish cookery books show that pasties were generally made from whatever food was available. Indeed, the earliest recorded pasty recipes include venison, not beef. &quot;Pasty&quot; has always been a generic name for the shape and can contain a variety of fillings, including stilton, vegetarian and even chicken tikka. Pork and apple pasties are readily available in shops throughout Cornwall and Devon, with the ingredients including an apple flavoured sauce, mixed together throughout the pasty, as well as sweet pasties with ingredients such as apple and fig or chocolate and banana, which are common in some areas of Cornwall.

A part-savoury, part-sweet pasty (similar to the Bedfordshire clanger) was eaten by miners in the 19th century, in the copper mines on Parys Mountain, Anglesey. The technician who did the research and discovered the recipe claimed that the recipe was probably taken to Anglesey by Cornish miners travelling to the area looking for work. No two-course pasties are commercially produced in Cornwall today, but are usually the product of amateur cooks. They are, however, commercially available in the British supermarket chain Morrisons (under the name &#x27;Tin Miner Pasty&#x27;). Other traditional fillings have included a wide variety of locally available meats including pork, bacon, egg, rabbit, chicken, mackerel and sweet fillings such as dates, apples, jam and sweetened rice - leading to the oft-quoted joke that &#x27;the Devil hisself was afeared to cross over into Cornwall for fear that ee&#x27;d end up in a pasty&#x27;.

A pasty is known as a &quot;tiddy oggy&quot; when steak is replaced with an extra potato, &quot;tiddy&quot; meaning potato and &quot;oggy&quot; meaning pasty and was eaten when times were hard and expensive meat could not be afforded. Another traditional meatless recipe is &#x27;herby pie&#x27; with parsley, freshly gathered wild green herbs and chives, ramsons or leeks and a spoonful of clotted cream.

===Shape===
Whilst the PGI rules state that a Cornish pasty must be a &quot;D&quot; shape, with crimping along the curve (i.e., side-crimped), crimping is variable within both Devon and Cornwall, with some advocating a side crimp while others maintain that a top crimp is more authentic. Some sources state that the difference between a Devon and a Cornish pasty is that a Devon pasty has a top-crimp and is oval in shape, whereas the Cornish pasty is semicircular and side-crimped along the curve. However, pasties with a top crimp have been made in Cornwall for generations, yet those Cornish bakers who favour this method now find that they cannot legally call their pasties &quot;Cornish&quot;. Paul Hollywood, writing for BBC Food, stated that a traditional Cornish pasty should have about 20 crimps.

==In other regions==

Migrating Devonian and Cornish miners and their families (colloquially known as Cousin Jacks and Cousin Jennies) helped to spread pasties into the rest of the world during the 19th century. As tin mining in Devon and Cornwall began to decline, miners took their expertise and traditions to new mining regions around the world. As a result, pasties can be found in many regions, including:

* Many parts of Australia, including the Yorke Peninsula, which has been the site of an annual Cornish festival (claimed to be the world&#x27;s largest) since 1973. A clarification of the Protected Geographical Status ruling has confirmed that pasties made in Australia are still allowed to be called &quot;Cornish Pasties&quot;.
* A Lancashire pasty is a traditional variant originating in Lancashire, especially West Lancashire that is similar to its Cornish counterpart but uses carrot instead of swede.
* Pasties can be found in California in many historical Gold Rush towns, such as Grass Valley and Nevada City.
* The pasty has become a cultural symbol of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Pasty shops are a significant tourist attraction in the region. Additionally, the village of Calumet is home to an annual Pasty Festival. Many ethnic groups adopted the pasty for use in the Copper Country copper mines; the Finnish immigrants to the region mistook it for the traditional &quot;piirakka&quot; and pastries. The pasty has become strongly associated with all cultures in this area and in the Iron Range in northern Minnesota.
* Mineral Point, Wisconsin, was the site of the first mineral rush in the United States during the 1830s. After lead was discovered in Mineral Point, many of the early miners migrated from Cornwall to this southwestern Wisconsin area. Pasties can be found in Wisconsin&#x27;s largest cities, Madison and Milwaukee, as well as in the far northern region along the border with Michigan&#x27;s Upper Peninsula.
* A similar local history about the arrival of the pasty in the area with an influx of Welsh and Cornish miners to the area&#x27;s copper mines, and its preservation as a local delicacy, is found in Butte, Montana, &quot;The Richest Hill on Earth&quot;. Miners referred to the pasty as a &quot;letter from &#x27;ome.&quot;
* The anthracite coal region of Northeastern Pennsylvania, including Wilkes-Barre, Scranton, and Hazleton, had an influx of miners to the area in the 19th century and brought the pasty with them. In 1981, a Pennsylvania entrepreneur started marketing pasties under the brand name Mr. Pastie.
* The Mexican state of Hidalgo and the twin silver mining cities of Pachuca and Real del Monte (Mineral del Monte) have notable Cornish influences from the Cornish miners who settled there, with pasties being considered typical local cuisine. In Mexican Spanish, they are referred to as &quot;pastes&quot;. A pasty museum is located in Real del Monte. The annual International Pasty Festival is held in Real del Monte each October.
* They are also popular in South Africa, New Zealand, and Ulster.
* Pasties were modified with different spices and fillings in Jamaica, giving rise to the Jamaican patty.

==Culture==
===Literature===
Pasties have been mentioned in multiple literary works since the 12th century Arthurian romance &quot;Erec and Enide&quot;, written by Chrétien de Troyes, in which they are eaten by characters from the area now known as Cornwall. There is a mention in Havelok the Dane, another romance written at the end of the thirteenth century; in the 14th century Robin Hood tales; and in two plays by William Shakespeare.

===Superstitions, rhymes and chants===
In the tin mines of Devon and Cornwall, pasties were associated with &quot;knockers&quot;, spirits said to create a knocking sound that was either supposed to indicate the location of rich veins of ore, or to warn of an impending tunnel collapse. To encourage the good will of the knockers, miners would leave a small part of the pasty within the mine for them to eat. Sailors and fisherman would likewise discard a crust to appease the spirits of dead mariners, though fishermen believed that it was bad luck to take a pasty aboard ship.

A Cornish proverb, recounted in 1861, emphasised the great variety of ingredients that were used in pasties by saying that the devil would not come into Cornwall for fear of ending up as a filling in one. A Cornish schoolboy playground-rhyme current in the 1940s concerning the pasty went: In 1959 the English singer-songwriter Cyril Tawney wrote a nostalgic song called &quot;The Oggie Man&quot;. The song tells of the pasty-seller with his characteristic vendor&#x27;s call who was always outside Plymouth&#x27;s Devonport Naval Dockyard gates late at night when the sailors were returning, and his replacement by hot dog sellers after World War II.

The word &quot;oggy&quot; in the internationally popular chant &quot;Oggy Oggy Oggy, Oi Oi Oi&quot; is thought to stem from Cornish dialect &quot;hoggan&quot;, deriving from &quot;hogen&quot; the Cornish word for pasty. When the pasties were ready for eating, the bal maidens at the mines would supposedly shout down the shaft &quot;Oggy Oggy Oggy&quot; and the miners would reply &quot;Oi Oi Oi&quot;.

===Giant pasties===
As the &#x27;national dish&#x27; of Cornwall, several oversized versions of the pasty have been created in the county. For example, a giant pasty is paraded from Polruan to Fowey through the streets during regatta week. Similarly, a giant pasty is paraded around the ground of the Cornish Pirates rugby team on St Piran&#x27;s Day before it is passed over the goal posts.

<doc id="188921" wikidata="Q157229" url="?curid=188921" title="Frauenkirche, Dresden">
<text>The Frauenkirche (, &quot;Church of Our Lady&quot;) is a Lutheran church in Dresden, the capital of the German state of Saxony. Destroyed during the Allied firebombing of Dresden towards the end of World War II, the church was reconstructed between 1994 and 2005.

The current structure is the third church building to stand at this site. The earliest was founded as a Catholic church before being converted to Protestantism during the Reformation. It was replaced in the 18th century by a larger Baroque purpose-built Lutheran building. When its foundation stone was laid on 26 August 1726, it contained a copy of the Augsburg Confession which is primary confession of faith of the Evangelical Lutheran Church. 
Considered an outstanding example of Protestant sacred architecture, it featured one of the largest domes in Europe. It was originally built as a sign of the will of the citizens of Dresden to remain Protestant after their ruler had converted to Catholicism. Having been reconstructed, it now also serves as a symbol of reconciliation between former warring enemies.

After the destruction of the church in 1945, the remaining ruins were left for nearly half a century as a war memorial, following decisions of local East German leaders. Following the reunification of Germany, it was decided to rebuild the church, starting in 1994. The reconstruction of its exterior was completed in 2004, and the interior the following year. The church was reconsecrated on 30 October 2005 with festive services lasting through the Protestant observance of Reformation Day on 31 October. The surrounding Neumarkt square with its many valuable baroque buildings was also reconstructed in 2004.

The Frauenkirche is often called a cathedral, but it is not the seat of a bishop; the church of the &quot;Landesbischof&quot; of the Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Saxony is the Church of the Cross. Once a month, an Anglican Evensong is held in English, by clergy from St. George&#x27;s Anglican Church, Berlin.

==History==
A church dedicated to &quot;&#x27;Our Lady&#x27; (Kirche zu unser Liebfrauen)&quot; was first built in the 11th century in a Romanesque style, outside the city walls and surrounded by a graveyard. The Frauenkirche was the seat of an archpriest in the Meissen Diocese until the Reformation, when it became a Protestant church. This first Frauenkirche was torn down in 1727 and replaced by a new, larger church with a greater capacity. The Frauenkirche was re-built as a Lutheran (Protestant) parish church by the citizenry. Even though Saxony&#x27;s Prince-elector, Frederick August I, had converted to Catholicism to become King of Poland, he supported the construction which not only gave an impressive cupola to the Dresden townscape but also reassured the Saxonians that their ruler was not going to force the principle &quot;cuius regio, eius religio&quot; upon them.

The original Baroque church was built between 1726 and 1743, and was designed by Dresden&#x27;s city architect, George Bähr, who did not live to see the completion of his greatest work. Bähr&#x27;s distinctive design for the church captured the new spirit of the Protestant liturgy by placing the altar, pulpit, and baptismal font directly centre in view of the entire . 

In 1736, famed organ maker Gottfried Silbermann built a three-manual, 43-stop instrument for the church. The organ was dedicated on 25 November and Johann Sebastian Bach gave a recital on the instrument on 1 December.

The church&#x27;s most distinctive feature was its unconventional high dome, high, called &quot;die Steinerne Glocke&quot; or &quot;Stone Bell&quot;. An engineering feat comparable to Michelangelo&#x27;s dome for St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome, the Frauenkirche&#x27;s 12,000-ton sandstone dome stood high resting on eight slender supports. Despite initial doubts, the dome proved to be extremely stable. Witnesses in 1760 said that the dome had been hit by more than 100 cannonballs fired by the Prussian army led by Friedrich II during the Seven Years&#x27; War. The projectiles bounced off and the church survived.
The completed church gave the city of Dresden a distinctive silhouette, captured in famous paintings by Bernardo Bellotto, a nephew of the artist Canaletto (also known by the same name), and in &quot;View of Dresden by Moonlight&quot; (1839) by Norwegian painter Johan Christian Dahl.

In 1849, the church was at the heart of the revolutionary disturbances known as the May Uprising. It was surrounded by barricades, and fighting lasted for days before those rebels who had not already fled were rounded up in the church and arrested.

For more than 200 years, the bell-shaped dome stood over the skyline of old Dresden, dominating the city.

Burials include Heinrich Schütz and George Bähr.

==Destruction==
On 13 February 1945, Allied forces began the bombing of Dresden in World War II. The church withstood two days and nights of the attacks, and the eight interior sandstone pillars supporting the large dome held up long enough for the evacuation of 300 people who had sought shelter in the church crypt, before succumbing to the heat generated by some 650,000 incendiary bombs that were dropped on the city. The temperature surrounding and inside the church eventually reached . The dome finally collapsed at 10 a.m. on 15 February. The pillars glowed bright red and exploded; the outer walls shattered and nearly 6,000 tons of stone plunged to earth, penetrating the massive floor as it fell.

The altar, a relief depiction of Jesus&#x27; Agony in the Garden of Gethsemane on the Mount of Olives by Johann Christian Feige, was only partially damaged during the bombing raid and fire that destroyed the church. The altar and the structure behind it, the chancel, were among the remnants left standing. Features of most of the figures were lopped off by falling debris and the fragments lay under the rubble.

The building vanished from Dresden&#x27;s skyline, and the blackened stones would lie in wait in a pile in the centre of the city for the next 45 years as Communist rule enveloped what was now East Germany. Shortly after the end of World War II, residents of Dresden had already begun salvaging unique stone fragments from the Church of Our Lady and numbering them for future use in reconstruction. Popular sentiment discouraged the authorities from clearing the ruins away to make a car park. In 1966, the remnants were officially declared a &quot;memorial against war&quot;, and state-controlled commemorations were held there on the anniversaries of the destruction of Dresden.

In 1982, the ruins began to be the site of a peace movement combined with peaceful protests against the East German regime. On the anniversary of the bombing, 400 citizens of Dresden came to the ruins in silence with flowers and candles, part of a growing East German civil rights movement. By 1989, the number of protesters in Dresden, Leipzig, and other parts of East Germany had increased to tens of thousands. On 9 November 1989, the Berlin Wall &quot;fell&quot; and the inner German border dividing East and West Germany toppled. This opened the way to German reunification.

==Promoting reconstruction and funding==

During the last months of World War II, residents expressed the desire to rebuild the church. However, due to political circumstances in East Germany, the reconstruction came to a halt. The heap of ruins was conserved as a war memorial within the inner city of Dresden, as a direct counterpart to the ruins of Coventry Cathedral, which was destroyed by German bombing in 1940 and also serves as a war memorial in the United Kingdom. Because of the continuing decay of the ruins, Dresden leaders decided in 1985 (after the Semperoper was finally finished) to rebuild the Church of Our Lady after the completion of the reconstruction of Dresden Castle.

The reunification of Germany, brought new life to the reconstruction plans. In 1989, a 14-member group of enthusiasts headed by Ludwig Güttler, a noted Dresden musician, formed a Citizens&#x27; Initiative. From that group emerged a year later The Society to Promote the Reconstruction of the Church of Our Lady, which began an aggressive private fund-raising campaign. The organisation grew to over 5,000 members in Germany and 20 other countries. A string of German auxiliary groups were formed, and three promotional organisations were created abroad.

The project gathered momentum. As hundreds of architects, art historians and engineers sorted the thousands of stones, identifying and labeling each for reuse in the new structure, others worked to raise money.
IBM provided a key element by contracting with RTI International, a nonprofit research institute in Research Triangle Park NC to create an interactive virtual reality representation of the Church. The VR drew donations large and small, helping to make the project possible.

Günter Blobel, a German-born American, saw the original Church of Our Lady as a boy when his refugee family took shelter in a town just outside Dresden days before the city was bombed. In 1994, he became the founder and president of the nonprofit Friends of Dresden, Inc., a United States organization dedicated to supporting the reconstruction, restoration, and preservation of Dresden&#x27;s artistic and architectural legacy. In 1999, Blobel won the Nobel Prize for medicine and donated the entire amount of his award money (nearly US$1 million) to the organization for the restoration of Dresden, to the rebuilding of the Frauenkirche and the building of a new synagogue. It was the single largest individual donation to the project.

In Britain, the Dresden Trust has Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, as its royal patron and the Bishop of Coventry among its curators. Dr. Paul Oestreicher, a canon emeritus of Coventry Cathedral and a founder of the Dresden Trust, wrote: &quot;The church is to Dresden what St. Paul&#x27;s is to London&quot;. Additional organizations include France&#x27;s Association Frauenkirche Paris and Switzerland&#x27;s Verein Schweizer Freunde der Frauenkirch.

Rebuilding the church cost €180 million. Dresdner Bank financed more than half of the reconstruction costs via a &quot;donor certificates campaign&quot;, collecting almost €70 million after 1995. The bank itself contributed more than seven million Euros, including more than one million donated by its employees. Over the years, thousands of watches containing tiny fragments of Church of Our Lady stone were sold, as were specially printed medals. One sponsor raised nearly €2.3 million through symbolic sales of up to 4,700 individual church stones (approximately 489.36 per stone).

Funds raised were turned over to the Frauenkirche Foundation Dresden, with the reconstruction backed by the State of Saxony, the City of Dresden and the Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Saxony.

The new golden tower cross was funded officially by &quot;the British people and the House of Windsor&quot;. It was made by the British silversmith company Grant Macdonald of which the main craftsman on the project was Alan Smith whose father was one of the bomber pilots responsible for the destruction of the church.

==Reconstruction==

Using original plans from builder Georg Bähr in the 1720s, the Dresden City Council decided to proceed with reconstruction in February 1992. A rubble-sorting ceremony started the event in January 1993 under the direction of church architect and engineer Eberhard Burger. The foundation stone was laid in 1994, and stabilized in 1995. The crypt was completed in 1996 and the inner cupola in 2000. Seven new bells were cast for the church and rang for the first time for the Pentecost celebration in 2003. The exterior was completed ahead of schedule in 2004 and the interior painted in 2005. The intensive efforts to rebuild this world-famous landmark were completed in 2005, one year earlier than originally planned, and in time for the 800-year anniversary of the city of Dresden in 2006.

The church was reconsecrated with a festive service one day before Reformation Day. The rebuilt church is a monument reminding people of its history and a symbol of hope and reconciliation.

As far as possible, the church – except for its dome – was rebuilt using original material and plans, with the help of modern technology. The heap of rubble was documented and carried off stone by stone. The approximate original position of each stone could be determined from its position in the heap. Every usable piece was measured and catalogued. A computer imaging program that could move the stones three-dimensionally around the screen in various configurations was used to help architects find where the original stones sat and how they fit together.

Of the millions of stones used in the rebuilding, more than 8,500 original stones were salvaged from the original church and approximately 3,800 reused in the reconstruction. The remaining 4,700 were deemed unusable for reuse and were sold off instead to pay for the reconstruction. As the older stones are covered with a darker patina, due to fire damage and weathering, the difference between old and new stones will be clearly visible for many years after reconstruction.

Two thousand pieces of the original altar were cleaned and incorporated into the new structure.

The builders relied on thousands of old photographs, memories of worshippers and church officials, and crumbling old purchase orders detailing the quality of the mortar or pigments of the paint (as in the 18th century, copious quantities of eggs were used to make the color that provides the interior with its almost luminescent glow).

When it came time to duplicate the oak doors of the entrance, the builders had only vague descriptions of the detailed carving. Because people (especially wedding parties) often posed for photos outside the church doors, they issued an appeal for old photographs and the responsewhich included entire wedding albumsallowed artisans to recreate the original doors.

The new gilded orb and cross on top of the dome was forged by Grant Macdonald Silversmiths in London using the original 18th-century techniques as much as possible. It was constructed by Alan Smith, a British goldsmith from London whose father, Frank, was a member of one of the aircrews who took part in the bombing of Dresden. Before travelling to Dresden, the cross was exhibited for five years in churches across the United Kingdom including Coventry Cathedral, Liverpool Cathedral, St Giles Cathedral in Edinburgh, and St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London. In February 2000, the cross was ceremonially handed over by Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, to be placed on the top of the dome a few days after the 60th commemoration of D-Day on 22 June 2004. The external structure of the Frauenkirche was completed. For the first time since the last war, the completed dome and its gilded cross grace Dresden&#x27;s skyline as in centuries prior. The cross that once topped the dome, now twisted and charred, stands to the right of the new altar.


Builders decided not to reproduce the 1736 Gottfried Silbermann organ, despite the fact that the original design papers, description, and details exist, giving rise to the Dresden organ dispute (&quot;Dresdner Orgelstreit&quot;). When installed, the Silbermann organ had three manuals with 43 ranks and over the years had been remodeled and expanded to five manuals with 80 ranks. Daniel Kern of Strasbourg, Alsace, completed a 4,873 pipe organ for the structure in April 2005 and it was inaugurated in October of that year; Samuel Kummer was the organist until 2022. The Kern organ contains all the stops which were in the Silbermann organ and attempts to recreate their sounds. The Kern work contains 68 stops and a fourth swell manual in the symphonic 19th century style which is apt for the organ literature composed after the baroque period.

A bronze statue of reformer and theologian Martin Luther, which survived the bombings, has been restored and again stands in front of the church. It is the work of sculptor Adolf von Donndorf from 1885.

There are two devotional services every day and two liturgies every Sunday. Since October 2005, there has been an exhibition on the history and reconstruction of the Frauenkirche at the Stadtmuseum (City Museum) in Dresden&#x27;s Alten Landhaus.

==Since the re-opening==

Since re-opening, the Church of Our Lady has been a tourist destination in Dresden. In the first three years, seven million people have visited the church as tourists and to attend worship services. The project has inspired other revitalization projects throughout Europe, including the Dom-Römer Project in Frankfurt, the City Palace of Potsdam, and the City Palace, Berlin. In 2009, US President Barack Obama visited the church after a meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in the Grünes Gewölbe.

==Criticisms of reconstruction methods==
Architectural historian Mark Jarzombek complained that unidentifiable parts of the ruins were placed in arbitrary locations in the new building. As a result, he said, the socialist monument to the bombing was, in essence, dispersed throughout the fabric of the building.

<text>In algebraic and differential geometry, a Calabi–Yau manifold, also known as a Calabi–Yau space, is a particular type of manifold which has certain properties, such as Ricci flatness, yielding applications in theoretical physics. Particularly in superstring theory, the extra dimensions of spacetime are sometimes conjectured to take the form of a 6-dimensional Calabi–Yau manifold, which led to the idea of mirror symmetry. Their name was coined by , after , who first conjectured that such surfaces might exist, and , who proved the Calabi conjecture.

Calabi–Yau manifolds are complex manifolds that are generalizations of K3 surfaces in any number of complex dimensions (i.e. any even number of real dimensions). They were originally defined as compact Kähler manifolds with a vanishing first Chern class and a Ricci-flat metric, though many other similar but inequivalent definitions are sometimes used.

==Definitions==
The motivational definition given by Shing-Tung Yau is of a compact Kähler manifold with a vanishing first Chern class, that is also Ricci flat.

There are many other definitions of a Calabi–Yau manifold used by different authors, some inequivalent. This section summarizes some of the more common definitions and the relations between them.

A Calabi–Yau formula_1-fold or Calabi–Yau manifold of (complex) dimension formula_1 is sometimes defined as a compact formula_1-dimensional Kähler manifold formula_4 satisfying one of the following equivalent conditions: 
* The canonical bundle of formula_4 is trivial.
* formula_4 has a holomorphic formula_1-form that vanishes nowhere.
* The structure group of the tangent bundle of formula_4 can be reduced from formula_9, the unitary group, to formula_10, the special unitary group.
* formula_4 has a Kähler metric with global holonomy contained in formula_10.

These conditions imply that the first integral Chern class formula_13 of formula_4 vanishes. Nevertheless, the converse is not true. The simplest examples where this happens are hyperelliptic surfaces, finite quotients of a complex torus of complex dimension 2, which have vanishing first integral Chern class but non-trivial canonical bundle.

For a compact formula_1-dimensional Kähler manifold formula_4 the following conditions are equivalent to each other, but are weaker than the conditions above, though they are sometimes used as the definition of a Calabi–Yau manifold:
* formula_4 has vanishing first real Chern class.
* formula_4 has a Kähler metric with vanishing Ricci curvature.
* formula_4 has a Kähler metric with local holonomy contained in formula_10.
* A positive power of the canonical bundle of formula_4 is trivial.
* formula_4 has a finite cover that has trivial canonical bundle.
* formula_4 has a finite cover that is a product of a torus and a simply connected manifold with trivial canonical bundle.

If a compact Kähler manifold is simply connected, then the weak definition above is equivalent to the stronger definition. Enriques surfaces give examples of complex manifolds that have Ricci-flat metrics, but their canonical bundles are not trivial, so they are Calabi–Yau manifolds according to the second but not the first definition above. On the other hand, their double covers are Calabi–Yau manifolds for both definitions (in fact, K3 surfaces).

By far the hardest part of proving the equivalences between the various properties above is proving the existence of Ricci-flat metrics. This follows from Yau&#x27;s proof of the Calabi conjecture, which implies that a compact Kähler manifold with a vanishing first real Chern class has a Kähler metric in the same class with vanishing Ricci curvature. (The class of a Kähler metric is the cohomology class of its associated 2-form.) Calabi showed such a metric is unique.

There are many other inequivalent definitions of Calabi–Yau manifolds that are sometimes used, which differ in the following ways (among others):
* The first Chern class may vanish as an integral class or as a real class.
* Most definitions assert that Calabi–Yau manifolds are compact, but some allow them to be non-compact. In the generalization to non-compact manifolds, the difference formula_24 must vanish asymptotically. Here, formula_25 is the Kähler form associated with the Kähler metric, formula_26.
* Some definitions put restrictions on the fundamental group of a Calabi–Yau manifold, such as demanding that it be finite or trivial. Any Calabi–Yau manifold has a finite cover that is the product of a torus and a simply-connected Calabi–Yau manifold.
* Some definitions require that the holonomy be exactly equal to formula_10 rather than a subgroup of it, which implies that the Hodge numbers formula_28 vanish for formula_29. Abelian surfaces have a Ricci flat metric with holonomy strictly smaller than formula_30 (in fact trivial) so are not Calabi–Yau manifolds according to such definitions.
* Most definitions assume that a Calabi–Yau manifold has a Riemannian metric, but some treat them as complex manifolds without a metric.
* Most definitions assume the manifold is non-singular, but some allow mild singularities. While the Chern class fails to be well-defined for singular Calabi–Yau&#x27;s, the canonical bundle and canonical class may still be defined if all the singularities are Gorenstein, and so may be used to extend the definition of a smooth Calabi–Yau manifold to a possibly singular Calabi–Yau variety.

==Examples==
The fundamental fact is that any smooth algebraic variety embedded in a projective space is a Kähler manifold, because there is a natural Fubini–Study metric on a projective space which one can restrict to the algebraic variety. By definition, if ω is the Kähler metric on the algebraic variety X and the canonical bundle KX is trivial, then X is Calabi–Yau. Moreover, there is unique Kähler metric ω on X such that [&quot;ω&quot;0] = [&quot;ω&quot;] ∈ &quot;H&quot;2(&quot;X&quot;,R), a fact which was conjectured by Eugenio Calabi and proved by Shing-Tung Yau (see Calabi conjecture).

=== Calabi–Yau algebraic curves ===
In one complex dimension, the only compact examples are tori, which form a one-parameter family. The Ricci-flat metric on a torus is actually a flat metric, so that the holonomy is the trivial group SU(1). A one-dimensional Calabi–Yau manifold is a complex elliptic curve, and in particular, algebraic.

=== CY algebraic surfaces ===
In two complex dimensions, the K3 surfaces furnish the only compact simply connected Calabi–Yau manifolds. These can be constructed as quartic surfaces in formula_31, such as the complex algebraic variety defined by the vanishing locus of

formula_32 for formula_33

Other examples can be constructed as elliptic fibrations, as quotients of abelian surfaces, or as complete intersections.

Non simply-connected examples are given by abelian surfaces, which are real four tori formula_34 equipped with a complex manifold structure. Enriques surfaces and hyperelliptic surfaces have first Chern class that vanishes as an element of the real cohomology group, but not as an element of the integral cohomology group, so Yau&#x27;s theorem about the existence of a Ricci-flat metric still applies to them but they are sometimes not considered to be Calabi–Yau manifolds. Abelian surfaces are sometimes excluded from the classification of being Calabi–Yau, as their holonomy (again the trivial group) is a proper subgroup of SU(2), instead of being isomorphic to SU(2). However, the Enriques surface subset do not conform entirely to the SU(2) subgroup in the String theory landscape.

=== CY threefolds ===
In three complex dimensions, classification of the possible Calabi–Yau manifolds is an open problem, although Yau suspects that there is a finite number of families (albeit a much bigger number than his estimate from 20 years ago). In turn, it has also been conjectured by Miles Reid that the number of topological types of Calabi–Yau 3-folds is infinite, and that they can all be transformed continuously ( through certain mild singularizations such as conifolds) one into another—much as Riemann surfaces can. One example of a three-dimensional Calabi–Yau manifold is a non-singular quintic threefold in CP4, which is the algebraic variety consisting of all of the zeros of a homogeneous quintic polynomial in the homogeneous coordinates of the CP4. Another example is a smooth model of the Barth–Nieto quintic. Some discrete quotients of the quintic by various Z5 actions are also Calabi–Yau and have received a lot of attention in the literature. One of these is related to the original quintic by mirror symmetry.

For every positive integer &quot;n&quot;, the zero set, in the homogeneous coordinates of the complex projective space CP&quot;n&quot;+1, of a non-singular homogeneous degree &quot;n&quot; + 2 polynomial in &quot;n&quot; + 2 variables is a compact Calabi–Yau &quot;n&quot;-fold. The case &quot;n&quot; = 1 describes an elliptic curve, while for &quot;n&quot; = 2 one obtains a K3 surface.

More generally, Calabi–Yau varieties/orbifolds can be found as weighted complete intersections in a weighted projective space. The main tool for finding such spaces is the adjunction formula.

All hyper-Kähler manifolds are Calabi–Yau manifolds.

==== Constructed from algebraic curves ====
For an algebraic curve formula_35 a quasi-projective Calabi-Yau threefold can be constructed as the total space formula_36 where formula_37. For the canonical projection formula_38 we can find the relative tangent bundle formula_39 is formula_40 using the relative tangent sequence

formula_41

and observing the only tangent vectors in the fiber which are not in the pre-image of formula_42 are canonically associated with the fibers of the vector bundle. Using this, we can use the relative cotangent sequence

formula_43

together with the properties of wedge powers that

formula_44

and formula_45 giving the triviality of formula_46.

==== Constructed from algebraic surfaces ====
Using a similar argument as for curves, the total space formula_47 of the canonical sheaf formula_48 for an algebraic surface formula_49 forms a Calabi-Yau threefold. A simple example is formula_50 over projective space.

==Applications in superstring theory==

Calabi–Yau manifolds are important in superstring theory. Essentially, Calabi–Yau manifolds are shapes that satisfy the requirement of space for the six &quot;unseen&quot; spatial dimensions of string theory, which may be smaller than our currently observable lengths as they have not yet been detected. A popular alternative known as large extra dimensions, which often occurs in braneworld models, is that the Calabi–Yau is large but we are confined to a small subset on which it intersects a D-brane. Further extensions into higher dimensions are currently being explored with additional ramifications for general relativity.

In the most conventional superstring models, ten conjectural dimensions in string theory are supposed to come as four of which we are aware, carrying some kind of fibration with fiber dimension six. Compactification on Calabi–Yau &quot;n&quot;-folds are important because they leave some of the original supersymmetry unbroken. More precisely, in the absence of fluxes, compactification on a Calabi–Yau 3-fold (real dimension 6) leaves one quarter of the original supersymmetry unbroken if the holonomy is the full SU(3).

More generally, a flux-free compactification on an &quot;n&quot;-manifold with holonomy SU(&quot;n&quot;) leaves 21−&quot;n&quot; of the original supersymmetry unbroken, corresponding to 26−&quot;n&quot; supercharges in a compactification of type IIA supergravity or 25−&quot;n&quot; supercharges in a compactification of type I. When fluxes are included the supersymmetry condition instead implies that the compactification manifold be a generalized Calabi–Yau, a notion introduced by . These models are known as flux compactifications.

F-theory compactifications on various Calabi–Yau four-folds provide physicists with a method to find a large number of classical solutions in the so-called string theory landscape.

Connected with each hole in the Calabi–Yau space is a group of low-energy string vibrational patterns. Since string theory states that our familiar elementary particles correspond to low-energy string vibrations, the presence of multiple holes causes the string patterns to fall into multiple groups, or families. Although the following statement has been simplified, it conveys the logic of the argument: if the Calabi–Yau has three holes, then three families of vibrational patterns and thus three families of particles will be observed experimentally.

Logically, since strings vibrate through all the dimensions, the shape of the curled-up ones will affect their vibrations and thus the properties of the elementary particles observed. For example, Andrew Strominger and Edward Witten have shown that the masses of particles depend on the manner of the intersection of the various holes in a Calabi–Yau. In other words, the positions of the holes relative to one another and to the substance of the Calabi–Yau space was found by Strominger and Witten to affect the masses of particles in a certain way. This is true of all particle properties.

== Calabi-Yau algebra ==
A Calabi–Yau algebra was introduced by Victor Ginzburg to transport the geometry of a Calabi–Yau manifold to noncommutative algebraic geometry.

==In popular culture==

* The Calabi-Yau manifold was the subject of a paper coauthored by Sheldon Cooper in the episode 2 of the seventh season in &quot;Young Sheldon&quot;.
* Imagery based on Calabi-Yau manifolds was used in episode 5 of the TV series &quot;3 Body Problem&quot; in order to illustrate the high-dimensional abilities of the San-Ti alien civilization.
* In Half-Life 2, Dr. Mossman describes teleporters as working via a &#x27;String-based&#x27; technology using &#x27;the Calabi-Yau model.&#x27;

<doc id="188933" wikidata="Q10585074" url="?curid=188933" title="Midland Counties Railway">
<text>The Midland Counties&#x27; Railway (MCR) was a railway company in the United Kingdom which existed between 1839 and 1844, connecting Nottingham, Leicester and Derby with Rugby and thence, via the London and Birmingham Railway, to London. The MCR system connected with the North Midland Railway and the Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway in Derby at what become known as the Tri Junct Station. The three later merged to become the Midland Railway.

The part of the MCR line between Nottingham, Derby and Leicester is still in use as part of the Midland Main Line, the part of the route from Leicester to Rugby however was closed in the 1960s.

==Origin==

The East Midlands had for some years been at centre of plans to link the major cities throughout the country. However, the MCR came about as a result of competition to supply coal to Leicester, a town which was rapidly industrialising and was a valuable market for coal. The competition was between the Coalville area of Leicestershire, and the Erewash Valley area of Nottinghamshire.

For many years, the Nottinghamshire coal miners had enjoyed a competitive advantage over their counterparts in Leicestershire, but in 1832 the latter opened the Leicester and Swannington Railway.

On 16 August 1832, at one of the Nottinghamshire miner&#x27;s regular meetings at the Sun Inn, at Eastwood the idea was mooted to extend the Mansfield and Pinxton Railway to Leicester. The decision was taken to involve outside finance, and, on 27 August 1832, a public meeting to attract subscriptions was held at the George Inn at Alfreton and on 26 September 1832 the scheme was formally approved at Eastwood, though at that time the possibility of using steam locomotives had not been discussed. In the &quot;Derby Mercury&quot; of 17 October 1832, the new railway was referred to as the &quot;Midland Counties&#x27; Railway.&quot;

Josias Jessop was retained as engineer, and reporting in 1833, noted that it would not be possible to put it before Parliament that year. Subscriptions had been obtained from Lancashire investors and with the imminent completion of the London and Birmingham Railway, they insisted that the line should continue to join it at Rugby, Warwickshire. George Rennie was brought in to assess the scheme and plan the southward extension.

Not surprisingly there had been opposition from Leicestershire to the proposal. In October an alternative plan was proposed of bringing in Nottingham and Derby, as well as Leicester, using a junction at Long Eaton, with the stated aim that it would reduce any differences in coal prices between them.

At last the plans were ready to put before Parliament in its 1834 session. However investment fell far short of the expected cost of over £125,000 (). The scheme was delayed for yet another year, during which time Charles Vignoles was asked to review the plans and become the company&#x27;s engineer.

At this point, the citizens of Northampton campaigned for the line to pass through their town rather than Rugby. Not surprisingly, at that late stage, it was refused. It has been suggested that, having opposed the London and Birmingham, they had seen the error of their ways. Such a line would have been longer and more expensive, shortening the journey to London by very little, but extending that to Birmingham excessively.

By that time, the North Midland Railway and Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway had been formed with the intention of meeting at Derby. The line to Pinxton threatened it, particularly as, in 1834, the Midland Counties had mooted the possibility of an extension to Clay Cross.

At the same time, the Birmingham and Derby link with the London and Birmingham Railway in a southwards direction at Hampton-in-Arden, threatened the Midland Counties. The two railways came to a private agreement to withdraw the competing lines from their Bills.

At last in 1836 the Midland Counties&#x27; Railway Bill went before Parliament and survived its passage through the House of Commons. However, there were still powerful interests ranged against it. Firstly there were the canal owners with which it was being built to compete. Secondly, the Bill still included the Pinxton line, to the extreme annoyance of the Birmingham and Derby line&#x27;s directors. There was a distinct possibility that the Lords would insist that the North Midland was connected to it instead of proceeding to Derby, losing the NMR some twenty miles of line and its connection to Birmingham and the West Country. Accordingly, it was dropped.
The (6 &amp; 7 Will. 4. c. lxxviii) received royal assent on 21 June 1836 without the connection to Pinxton. Since this was the original reason for building the railway, one can imagine the feelings of the Nottinghamshire miners.

==Construction==

===Nottingham to Derby===
In January 1837 the company issued invitations to tender for three contracts, Derby to Trent Junction, Nottingham to Trent Junction and Trent Junction to Sutton Bonington. By February 1837, the engineers had marked out the whole of the line. The principal contractors struggled to meet the deadline of 22 February to quote for the construction of 22 miles of railway, so the deadline was extended to 28 February, with the additional requirement of a cast-iron bridge over the River Trent at Thrumpton.

Contracts were awarded for the Derby to Trent Junction portion by April 1837 for £3,000 () under the estimate with an forecast of completion by September 1838. The contract for the section from Trent Junction to Sutton Bonington was let in May 1837. The contract for the works in Nottingham were signed in June 1837 and construction started immediately. By September 1837 it was reported that 400 men were employed in three different places on the line between Nottingham and Derby.

The engineer was Charles Blacker Vignoles, and the superintendent was Thomas Jackson Woodhouse. The contractor for the works between Derby, Long Eaton and Loughborough was William MacKenzie of Chorley, Lancashire. The contractor for Long Eaton to Nottingham was Messrs. Taylor, Sharpe and Johnson.

The only obstacle was the Derby Canal which would need to be diverted at Borrowash, the canal owners asking £2 for every hour that it was closed. However quick action allowed the work to be completed, when a drought fortuitously occurred, closing the canal.
Initially the railway ran into a temporary platform at Derby, but at Nottingham a magnificent terminus had been built in Carrington Street. The inaugural run took place from Nottingham on 30 May 1839, with a timetabled public service beginning on 4 June.

===To Leicester and Rugby===
The portion of the contract from Leicester to the Trent Viaduct was let in December 1837 at which point it was reported that 900 men were engaged in the construction. The contractor for Loughborough to Syston was Messrs. Gordon and Hector McLeod, and the contractor for the Syston to Leicester, and Leicester to Rugby portions was Messrs David Macintosh. It had three main obstacles, the first being the crossing of the Trent. This was done by means of an elegant three arched bridge built by the Butterley Company. Immediately following this was Redhill Tunnel, provided with elegant castellated portals to placate the local landowner. The bridge was replaced with the present girder bridge in 1900 when the line was quadrupled, and a second bore was provided for the tunnel with identical portals. Finally a substantial cutting was needed at Sutton Bonington.
While the Derby-Nottingham tracks had been supported on stone blocks, the section to Rugby used kyanised timber sleepers. At Leicester there was another magnificent station in Campbell Street, originally planned as a terminus on a spur from the main line. However, it was built as a loop with a single long platform next to the through running lines. It was replaced by the present London Road station in 1892.

Progress to Rugby was hampered by wet weather and the need for several long cuttings and embankments. There were two tunnels, at Knighton and near Ullesthorpe and a bridge over the River Avon and the Oxford Canal at Rugby. This last was not completed in time for the opening and, for seven weeks, passengers had to alight at a temporary platform, to be taken by road into Rugby.

===Engineering===
There were 148 bridges in all, and three tunnels. The rails were double headed in lengths at at a gauge throughout of . These were laid either on gritstone blocks from Cromford, laid diagonally, or on embankments, timber sleepers of oak or kyanised larch. For a length near Rugby, Evans&#x27;s dovetailed bridge rails of , were tried, mounted on longitudinal Memel fir timbers with pine cross sleepers.

The earthworks ensured that the maximum gradient of the line was 1 in 330 (0.3 %). The largest were on the Rugby line at the Leire cutting and embankment. The whole project required approximately of earthworks. There were only two significant bridges and viaducts, one being that over the River Trent, which comprised three cast iron arches of each and the viaduct over the valley of the Avon (now Grade II listed) which consisted of 11 arches of each, elevating the line above the valley floor.

The total cost of construction was just under £1,400,000 ().

==Opening==

The line was finally opened in three stages:

* Derby to Nottingham 4 June 1839
* Trent Junction to Leicester 4 May 1840
* Leicester to Rugby 1 July 1840

On 4 June 1839 the company provided four trains at Nottingham for passenger services on opening day. The first two with six coaches, and the others with two coaches each. Each train was headed by a separate engine, &quot;Ariel&quot;, &quot;Mersey&quot;, &quot;Hawk&quot; and &quot;Sunbeam&quot;. The brass band of the 5th Dragoon Guards entertained the passengers, and played &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; as each train departed. The first train headed by &quot;Sunbeam&quot; with four first class and two second class carriages departed for Derby at 12:30 pm. Five minutes later &quot;Ariel&quot; was attached to a train and departed for Derby. &quot;Ariel&quot; arrived at Long Eaton at 12:48 pm, and Derby by 1:19 pm. After a wait in Derby of just over an hour, the trains returned to Nottingham, where the band of the Dragoons struck up &quot;See, the Conqu&#x27;ring Hero Comes&quot;.

One notable event was the first large organised excursion by rail, &quot;got up by the Nottingham Mechanics&#x27; Institute. A week later the Leicester Mechanics&#x27; Institute returned the compliment to Nottingham.&quot; After Thomas Cook began the tourist business, the MCR began organising excursions on its own account, on one occasion conveying some 2,400 people in a single train of 65 four-wheeled carriages and wagons. The fact that MCR&#x27;s locomotives were all either single driving-wheeled or 0-4-0s, and small at that meant that the heavier the train, the more were added. The excursion must have been a sight to behold.

===Competition===
Initially the Midland Counties&#x27; Railway did not prosper due to competition from the Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway which also transported coal from the East Midlands to London, via Hampton-in-Arden. An ensuing price war between the two companies almost drove both of them out of business.

The MCR made an agreement with the North Midland for exclusive access to its passengers. In retaliation the Birmingham board opposed a bill that the MCR had submitted to Parliament. Both lines were in dire straits and paying minuscule dividends.

The North Midland was also suffering severe financial problems arising from the original cost of the line and its buildings. At length George Hudson took control of the NMR and adopted Robert Stephenson&#x27;s suggestion that the best outcome would be for the three lines to merge.

Hudson foresaw that the directors of the MCR would resist the idea and made a secret agreement with the B&amp;DJR for the NMR to take it over. This would of course take away the MCR&#x27;s customers from Derby and the North and, when news leaked out, shares in the B&amp;DJR rose dramatically.

Hudson was able to give the MCR directors an ultimatum, and persuaded the line&#x27;s shareholders to override their board and the stage was set for amalgamation.

===Midland Railway===
In 1844, the Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway, the Midland Counties&#x27; Railway and the North Midland Railway merged under the Midland Railway (Consolidation) Act 1844 (7 &amp; 8 Vict. c. xviii) to form the new Midland Railway.

The Mansfield and Pinxton Railway was finally connected in 1847, and the extension to Chesterfield was built in 1862. Now known as the Erewash Valley Line, it joined near where the three original lines met at Trent Junction, crossing to the up (London) line on the level at Platt&#x27;s Crossing. This potentially dangerous arrangement was removed when Trent station was built in 1862 and the whole junction was remodelled.

This underwent many changes over the years, the station finally closing in 1968.

==Legacy==
Most of the original Midland Counties&#x27; Railway line between Nottingham, Derby and Leicester is still operating today as part of the Midland Main Line. The original line into Derby, through what later became the site of Chaddesden Sidings, closed in 1969. Also part of the original route was abandoned when track alterations were put in with the opening of Trent Station in the 1860s. The stretch between Leicester and Rugby was closed in 1961. The line between Trent Junction and Chesterfield, known locally as the Erewash Valley Line, is still today the second most busy in the East Midlands, with freight to the south east of the country. The daily southbound Master Cutler travels along it directly from Sheffield to London, while a few expresses divert at Trowell just north of Trent, to call at Nottingham, before travelling to London. Although the old North Midlands through Derby is the main express line (since trains have to reverse at Nottingham), there is still a half-hourly service from Nottingham itself to London.

In January 2019, Campaign for Better Transport released a report identifying the line between Rugby and Leicester which was listed as Priority 2 for reopening. Priority 2 is for those lines which require further development or a change in circumstances (such as housing developments).

<text>In quantum statistics, Bose–Einstein statistics (B–E statistics) describes one of two possible ways in which a collection of non-interacting identical particles may occupy a set of available discrete energy states at thermodynamic equilibrium. The aggregation of particles in the same state, which is a characteristic of particles obeying Bose–Einstein statistics, accounts for the cohesive streaming of laser light and the frictionless creeping of superfluid helium. The theory of this behaviour was developed (1924–25) by Satyendra Nath Bose, who recognized that a collection of identical and indistinguishable particles can be distributed in this way. The idea was later adopted and extended by Albert Einstein in collaboration with Bose.

Bose–Einstein statistics apply only to particles that do not follow the Pauli exclusion principle restrictions. Particles that follow Bose-Einstein statistics are called bosons, which have integer values of spin. In contrast, particles that follow Fermi-Dirac statistics are called fermions and have half-integer spins.

== Bose–Einstein distribution ==
At low temperatures, bosons behave differently from fermions (which obey the Fermi–Dirac statistics) in a way that an unlimited number of them can &quot;condense&quot; into the same energy state. This apparently unusual property also gives rise to the special state of matter – the Bose–Einstein condensate. Fermi–Dirac and Bose–Einstein statistics apply when quantum effects are important and the particles are &quot;indistinguishable&quot;. Quantum effects appear if the concentration of particles satisfies
formula_1
where is the number of particles, is the volume, and is the quantum concentration, for which the interparticle distance is equal to the thermal de Broglie wavelength, so that the wavefunctions of the particles are barely overlapping.

Fermi–Dirac statistics applies to fermions (particles that obey the Pauli exclusion principle), and Bose–Einstein statistics applies to bosons. As the quantum concentration depends on temperature, most systems at high temperatures obey the classical (Maxwell–Boltzmann) limit, unless they also have a very high density, as for a white dwarf. Both Fermi–Dirac and Bose–Einstein become Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics at high temperature or at low concentration.

Bose–Einstein statistics was introduced for photons in 1924 by Bose and generalized to atoms by Einstein in 1924–25.

The expected number of particles in an energy state for Bose–Einstein statistics is:

with and where is the occupation number (the number of particles) in state , formula_2 is the degeneracy of energy level , is the energy of the -th state, &quot;μ&quot; is the chemical potential (zero for a photon gas), is the Boltzmann constant, and is the absolute temperature.

The variance of this distribution formula_3 is calculated directly from the expression above for the average number.
formula_4

For comparison, the average number of fermions with energy formula_5 given by Fermi–Dirac particle-energy distribution has a similar form:
formula_6

As mentioned above, both the Bose–Einstein distribution and the Fermi–Dirac distribution approaches the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution in the limit of high temperature and low particle density, without the need for any ad hoc assumptions:
* In the limit of low particle density, formula_7, therefore formula_8 or equivalently formula_9. In that case, formula_10, which is the result from Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics.
* In the limit of high temperature, the particles are distributed over a large range of energy values, therefore the occupancy on each state (especially the high energy ones with formula_11) is again very small, formula_12. This again reduces to Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics.

In addition to reducing to the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution in the limit of high formula_13 and low density, Bose–Einstein statistics also reduces to Rayleigh–Jeans law distribution for low energy states with formula_14, namely
formula_15

== History ==
Władysław Natanson in 1911 concluded that Planck&#x27;s law requires indistinguishability of &quot;units of energy&quot;, although he did not frame this in terms of Einstein&#x27;s light quanta.

While presenting a lecture at the University of Dhaka (in what was then British India and is now Bangladesh) on the theory of radiation and the ultraviolet catastrophe, Satyendra Nath Bose intended to show his students that the contemporary theory was inadequate, because it predicted results not in accordance with experimental results. During this lecture, Bose committed an error in applying the theory, which unexpectedly gave a prediction that agreed with the experiment. The error was a simple mistake—similar to arguing that flipping two fair coins will produce two heads one-third of the time—that would appear obviously wrong to anyone with a basic understanding of statistics (remarkably, this error resembled the famous blunder by d&#x27;Alembert known from his &quot;Croix ou Pile&quot; article). However, the results it predicted agreed with experiment, and Bose realized it might not be a mistake after all. For the first time, he took the position that the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution would not be true for all microscopic particles at all scales. Thus, he studied the probability of finding particles in various states in phase space, where each state is a little patch having phase volume of &quot;h&quot;3, and the position and momentum of the particles are not kept particularly separate but are considered as one variable.

Bose adapted this lecture into a short article called &quot;Planck&#x27;s law and the hypothesis of light quanta&quot; and submitted it to the &quot;Philosophical Magazine&quot;. However, the referee&#x27;s report was negative, and the paper was rejected. Undaunted, he sent the manuscript to Albert Einstein requesting publication in the . Einstein immediately agreed, personally translated the article from English into German (Bose had earlier translated Einstein&#x27;s article on the general theory of relativity from German to English), and saw to it that it was published. Bose&#x27;s theory achieved respect when Einstein sent his own paper in support of Bose&#x27;s to , asking that they be published together. The paper came out in 1924.

The reason Bose produced accurate results was that since photons are indistinguishable from each other, one cannot treat any two photons having equal quantum numbers (e.g., polarization and momentum vector) as being two distinct identifiable photons. Bose originally had a factor of 2 for the possible spin states, but Einstein changed it to polarization. By analogy, if in an alternate universe coins were to behave like photons and other bosons, the probability of producing two heads would indeed be one-third, and so is the probability of getting a head and a tail which equals one-half for the conventional (classical, distinguishable) coins. Bose&#x27;s &quot;error&quot; leads to what is now called Bose–Einstein statistics.

Bose and Einstein extended the idea to atoms and this led to the prediction of the existence of phenomena which became known as Bose–Einstein condensate, a dense collection of bosons (which are particles with integer spin, named after Bose), which was demonstrated to exist by experiment in 1995.

== Derivation ==

=== Derivation from the microcanonical ensemble ===
In the microcanonical ensemble, one considers a system with fixed energy, volume, and number of particles. We take a system composed of formula_16 identical bosons, formula_17 of which have energy formula_5 and are distributed over formula_2 levels or states with the same energy formula_5, i.e. formula_2 is the degeneracy associated with energy formula_5 of total energy formula_23. Calculation of the number of arrangements of formula_17 particles distributed among formula_2 states is a problem of combinatorics. Since particles are indistinguishable in the quantum mechanical context here, the number of ways for arranging formula_17 particles in formula_2 boxes (for the formula_28th energy level) would be (see image):

formula_29
where formula_30 is the &quot;k&quot;-combination of a set with &quot;m&quot; elements. The total number of arrangements in an ensemble of bosons is simply the product of the binomial coefficients formula_31 above over all the energy levels, i.e.
formula_32

The maximum number of arrangements determining the corresponding occupation number formula_17 is obtained by maximizing the entropy, or equivalently, setting formula_34 and taking the subsidiary conditions formula_35 into account (as Lagrange multipliers). The result for formula_36, formula_37, formula_38 is the Bose–Einstein distribution.

=== Derivation from the grand canonical ensemble ===
The Bose–Einstein distribution, which applies only to a quantum system of non-interacting bosons, is naturally derived from the grand canonical ensemble without any approximations. In this ensemble, the system is able to exchange energy and exchange particles with a reservoir (temperature &quot;T&quot; and chemical potential &quot;μ&quot; fixed by the reservoir).

Due to the non-interacting quality, each available single-particle level (with energy level &quot;ϵ&quot;) forms a separate thermodynamic system in contact with the reservoir. That is, the number of particles within the overall system &quot;that occupy a given single particle state&quot; form a sub-ensemble that is also grand canonical ensemble; hence, it may be analysed through the construction of a grand partition function.

Every single-particle state is of a fixed energy, formula_39. As the sub-ensemble associated with a single-particle state varies by the number of particles only, it is clear that the total energy of the sub-ensemble is also directly proportional to the number of particles in the single-particle state; where formula_40 is the number of particles, the total energy of the sub-ensemble will then be formula_41. Beginning with the standard expression for a grand partition function and replacing formula_42 with formula_43, the grand partition function takes the form
formula_44

This formula applies to fermionic systems as well as bosonic systems. Fermi–Dirac statistics arises when considering the effect of the Pauli exclusion principle: whilst the number of fermions occupying the same single-particle state can only be either 1 or 0, the number of bosons occupying a single particle state may be any integer. Thus, the grand partition function for bosons can be considered a geometric series and may be evaluated as such:
formula_45

Note that the geometric series is convergent only if formula_46, including the case where formula_47. This implies that the chemical potential for the Bose gas must be negative, i.e., formula_48, whereas the Fermi gas is allowed to take both positive and negative values for the chemical potential.

The average particle number for that single-particle substate is given by
formula_49
This result applies for each single-particle level and thus forms the Bose–Einstein distribution for the entire state of the system.

The variance in particle number, formula_50, is:
formula_51

As a result, for highly occupied states the standard deviation of the particle number of an energy level is very large, slightly larger than the particle number itself: formula_52. This large uncertainty is due to the fact that the probability distribution for the number of bosons in a given energy level is a geometric distribution; somewhat counterintuitively, the most probable value for &quot;N&quot; is always 0. (In contrast, classical particles have instead a Poisson distribution in particle number for a given state, with a much smaller uncertainty of formula_53, and with the most-probable &quot;N&quot; value being near formula_54.)

=== Derivation in the canonical approach ===

It is also possible to derive approximate Bose–Einstein statistics in the canonical ensemble. These derivations are lengthy and only yield the above results in the asymptotic limit of a large number of particles. The reason is that the total number of bosons is fixed in the canonical ensemble. The Bose–Einstein distribution in this case can be derived as in most texts by maximization, but the mathematically best derivation is by the Darwin–Fowler method of mean values as emphasized by Dingle. See also Müller-Kirsten. The fluctuations of the ground state in the condensed region are however markedly different in the canonical and grand-canonical ensembles.
Suppose we have a number of energy levels, labeled by index formula_55, each level having energy formula_56 and containing a total of formula_57 particles. Suppose each level contains formula_58 distinct sublevels, all of which have the same energy, and which are distinguishable. For example, two particles may have different momenta, in which case they are distinguishable from each other, yet they can still have the same energy. 
The value of 
formula_58 associated with level formula_55 is called the &quot;degeneracy&quot; of that energy level. Any number of bosons can occupy the same sublevel.

Let formula_61 be the number of ways of distributing formula_62 particles among the formula_63 sublevels of an energy level. There is only one way of distributing formula_62 particles with one sublevel, therefore formula_65. It is easy to see that there are formula_66 ways of distributing formula_62 particles in two sublevels which we will write as:
formula_68

With a little thought (see Notes below) it can be seen that the number of ways of distributing formula_62 particles in three sublevels is
formula_70
so that
formula_71
where we have used the following theorem involving binomial coefficients:
formula_72

Continuing this process, we can see that formula_61 is just a binomial coefficient
(See Notes below)
formula_74

For example, the population numbers for two particles in three sublevels are 200, 110, 101, 020, 011, or 002 for a total of six which equals 4!/(2!2!). The number of ways that a set of occupation numbers formula_57 can be realized is the product of the ways that each individual energy level can be populated:
formula_76
where the approximation assumes that formula_77.

Following the same procedure used in deriving the Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics, we wish to find the set of formula_57 for which &quot;W&quot; is maximised, subject to the constraint that there be a fixed total number of particles, and a fixed total energy. The maxima of formula_79 and formula_80 occur at the same value of formula_57 and, since it is easier to accomplish mathematically, we will maximise the latter function instead. We constrain our solution using Lagrange multipliers forming the function:
formula_82

Using the formula_77 approximation and using Stirling&#x27;s approximation for the factorials formula_84 gives
formula_85
where &quot;K&quot; is the sum of a number of terms which are not functions of the formula_17. Taking the derivative with respect to formula_57, and setting the result to zero and solving for formula_57, yields the Bose–Einstein population numbers:
formula_89

By a process similar to that outlined in the Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics article, it can be seen that:
formula_90
which, using Boltzmann&#x27;s famous relationship formula_91 becomes a statement of the second law of thermodynamics at constant volume, and it follows that formula_92 and formula_93 where &quot;S&quot; is the entropy, formula_94 is the chemical potential, &quot;k&quot;B is the Boltzmann constant and &quot;T&quot; is the temperature, so that finally:
formula_95

Note that the above formula is sometimes written:
formula_96
where formula_97 is the absolute activity, as noted by McQuarrie.

Also note that when the particle numbers are not conserved, removing the conservation of particle numbers constraint is equivalent to setting formula_98 and therefore the chemical potential formula_94 to zero. This will be the case for photons and massive particles in mutual equilibrium and the resulting distribution will be the Planck distribution.

A much simpler way to think of Bose–Einstein distribution function is to consider that n particles are denoted by identical balls and g shells are marked by g-1 line partitions. It is clear that the permutations of these n balls and g − 1 partitions will give different ways of arranging bosons in different energy levels. Say, for 3 (= &quot;n&quot;) particles and 3 (= &quot;g&quot;) shells, therefore , the arrangement might be |●●|●, or ||●●●, or |●|●● , etc. Hence the number of distinct permutations of objects which have &quot;n&quot; identical items and (&quot;g&quot; − 1) identical items will be:
formula_100

See the image for a visual representation of one such distribution of &quot;n&quot; particles in &quot;g&quot; boxes that can be represented as partitions. 

OR

The purpose of these notes is to clarify some aspects of the derivation of the Bose–Einstein distribution for beginners. The enumeration of cases (or ways) in the Bose–Einstein distribution can be recast as follows. Consider a game of dice throwing in which there are formula_62 dice, with each die taking values in the setformula_102, for formula_103. The constraints of the game are that the value of a die formula_55, denoted by formula_105, has to be greater than or equal to the value of die formula_106, denoted by formula_107, in the previous throw, i.e., formula_108. Thus a valid sequence of die throws can be described by an &quot;n&quot;-tuple formula_109, such that formula_108. Let formula_111 denote the set of these valid &quot;n&quot;-tuples:
Then the quantity formula_61 (defined above as the number of ways to distribute formula_62 particles among the formula_63 sublevels of an energy level) is the cardinality of formula_111, i.e., the number of elements (or valid &quot;n&quot;-tuples) in formula_111. Thus the problem of finding an expression for formula_61 becomes the problem of counting the elements in formula_111.
Example &quot;n&quot; = 4, &quot;g&quot; = 3:
formula_119
formula_120 (there are formula_121 elements in formula_122)
Subset formula_123 is obtained by fixing all indices formula_105 to formula_125, except for the last index, formula_126, which is incremented from formula_127 to formula_128. Subset formula_129 is obtained by fixing formula_130, and incrementing formula_131 from formula_132 to formula_128. Due to the constraint formula_134 on the indices in formula_111, the index formula_136 must automatically take values in formula_137. The construction of subsets formula_138 and formula_139 follows in the same manner.

Each element of formula_122 can be thought of as a multiset of cardinality formula_141; the elements of such multiset are taken from the set formula_142 of cardinality formula_128, and the number of such multisets is the multiset coefficient
formula_144

More generally, each element of formula_111 is a multiset of cardinality formula_62 (number of dice) with elements taken from the set formula_147 of cardinality formula_63 (number of possible values of each die), and the number of such multisets, i.e., formula_61 is the multiset coefficient

which is exactly the same as the formula for formula_150, as derived above with the aid of a theorem involving binomial coefficients, namely
To understand the decomposition

or for example, formula_141 and formula_128
formula_153

let us rearrange the elements of formula_122 as follows
formula_155

Clearly, the subset formula_156 of formula_122 is the same as the set
formula_158

By deleting the index formula_159 (shown in red with double underline) in the subset formula_160 of formula_161, one obtains the set
formula_162

In other words, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the subset formula_160 of formula_161 and the set formula_165. We write
formula_166

Similarly, it is easy to see that
formula_167
formula_168
formula_169

Thus we can write 
formula_170
or more generally,

and since the sets
formula_171
are non-intersecting, we thus have

with the convention that

Continuing the process, we arrive at the following formula
formula_172
Using the convention (7)2 above, we obtain the formula

keeping in mind that for formula_173 and formula_174 being constants, we have
It can then be verified that (8) and (2) give the same result for formula_175, formula_176, formula_177, etc.
== Interdisciplinary applications ==

Viewed as a pure probability distribution, the Bose–Einstein distribution has found application in other fields:
* In recent years, Bose–Einstein statistics has also been used as a method for term weighting in information retrieval. The method is one of a collection of DFR (&quot;Divergence From Randomness&quot;) models, the basic notion being that Bose–Einstein statistics may be a useful indicator in cases where a particular term and a particular document have a significant relationship that would not have occurred purely by chance. Source code for implementing this model is available from the Terrier project at the University of Glasgow.
* The evolution of many complex systems, including the World Wide Web, business, and citation networks, is encoded in the dynamic web describing the interactions between the system&#x27;s constituents. Despite their irreversible and nonequilibrium nature these networks follow Bose statistics and can undergo Bose–Einstein condensation. Addressing the dynamical properties of these nonequilibrium systems within the framework of equilibrium quantum gases predicts that the &quot;first-mover-advantage&quot;, &quot;fit-get-rich&quot; (FGR) and &quot;winner-takes-all&quot; phenomena observed in competitive systems are thermodynamically distinct phases of the underlying evolving networks.

<text>Richard Bentley FRS (; 27 January 1662 – 14 July 1742) was an English classical scholar, critic, and theologian. Considered the &quot;founder of historical philology&quot;, Bentley is widely credited with establishing the English school of Hellenism. In 1892, A. E. Housman called Bentley &quot;the greatest scholar that England or perhaps that Europe ever bred&quot;.

Bentley&#x27;s &quot;Dissertation upon the Epistles of Phalaris&quot;, published in 1699, proved that the letters in question, supposedly written in the 6th century BCE by the Sicilian tyrant Phalaris, were actually a forgery produced by a Greek sophist in the 2nd century CE. Bentley&#x27;s investigation of the subject is still regarded as a landmark of textual criticism. He also showed that the sound represented in transcriptions of some Greek dialects by the letter digamma appeared also in Homeric poetry, even though it was not represented there in writing by any letter.

Bentley became Master of Trinity College, Cambridge in 1700. His autocratic manner and contemptuous treatment of the college fellows led to extensive controversy and litigation, but he remained in that post until his death, more than four decades later. In 1717 Bentley was appointed as the Regius Professor of Divinity at the University of Cambridge. As professor at Cambridge, Bentley introduced the first competitive written examinations in a Western university.

A fellow of the Royal Society, Bentley was interested in natural theology and the new physical sciences, subjects on which he corresponded with Isaac Newton. Bentley was in charge of the second edition of Newton&#x27;s &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot;, although he delegated most of the scientific work involved to his pupil Roger Cotes.

==Early life and education==
Richard Bentley was born at his maternal grandparents&#x27; home at Oulton near Rothwell, Leeds, West Yorkshire, in northern England. A blue plaque near his birthplace commemorates the fact. His father was Thomas Bentley, a yeoman farmer of Oulton. His grandfather, Captain James Bentley, is said to have suffered for the Royalist cause following the English Civil War, leaving the family in reduced circumstances. Bentley&#x27;s mother, the daughter of a stonemason, had some education, and was able to give her son his first lessons in Latin.

After attending grammar school in Wakefield, Bentley entered St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge in 1676. He afterwards obtained a scholarship and received the degrees of BA in 1680 and MA in 1683.

==Academic work==
Bentley never became a college fellow, which would have been the more natural course to an academic career. Instead, he was appointed headmaster of Spalding Grammar School before he was 21 years old. Edward Stillingfleet, the dean of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London, hired Bentley as tutor to his son. This allowed Bentley to meet eminent scholars, have access to the best private library in England, and become familiar with Dean Stillingfleet. During his six years as tutor, Bentley also made a comprehensive study of Greek and Latin writers, storing up knowledge which he would use later in his scholarship.

In 1689, Stillingfleet became bishop of Worcester and Bentley&#x27;s pupil went up to Wadham College, Oxford, accompanied by his tutor. At Oxford, Bentley soon met John Mill, Humphrey Hody, and Edward Bernard. He studied the manuscripts of the Bodleian, Corpus Christi, and other college libraries. He collected material for literary studies. Among these are a corpus of the fragments of the Greek poets and an edition of the Greek lexicographers.

The Oxford (Sheldonian) press was about to bring out an edition (the &quot;editio princeps&quot;) from the unique manuscript of the &quot;Chronographia&quot; in the Bodleian Library. It was a universal history (down to AD 560) in Greek by John Malalas or &quot;John the Rhetor&quot; of Antioch (date uncertain, between 600 and 1000). The editor, John Mill, principal of St Edmund Hall, asked Bentley to review it and make any pertinent remarks on the text.

Bentley wrote the &quot;Epistola ad Johannem Millium&quot;, which is about a hundred pages long and was included at the end of the &quot;Oxford Malalas&quot; (1691). That short treatise placed Bentley ahead of all living English scholars. The ease with which he restored corrupted passages, the certainty of his emendation and command over the relevant material, are in a style totally different from the careful and laborious learning of Hody, Mill or Edmund Chilmead. To the small circle of classical students (lacking the great critical dictionaries of modern times), it was obvious that he was a critic beyond the ordinary.

In 1690, Bentley had taken deacon&#x27;s orders. In 1692 he was nominated first Boyle lecturer, a nomination repeated in 1694. He was offered the appointment a third time in 1695 but declined it, as he was involved in too many other activities. In the first series of lectures (&quot;A Confutation of Atheism&quot;), he endeavours to present Newtonian physics in a popular form, and to frame them (especially in opposition to Hobbes) into a proof of the existence of an intelligent Creator. He had some correspondence with Newton, then living in Trinity College, Cambridge, on the subject. The second series, preached in 1694, has not been published and is believed to be lost.

After being ordained, Bentley was promoted to a prebendal stall in Worcester Cathedral. In 1693 the curator of the royal library became vacant, and his friends tried to obtain the position for Bentley, but did not have enough influence. The new librarian, a Mr Thynne, resigned in favour of Bentley, on condition that he receive an annuity of £130 for life out of the £200 salary. In 1695 Bentley received a royal chaplaincy and the living of Hartlebury.

That same year, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1696 earned the degree of Doctor of Divinity. The scholar Johann Georg Graevius of Utrecht made a dedication to him, prefixed to a dissertation on the seventeenth-century scholar Albert Rubens, &quot;De Vita Fl. Mallii Theodori&quot; (1694).

===Dissertation on the &quot;Epistles&quot; of Phalaris===
Bentley had official apartments in St. James&#x27;s Palace and his first care was the royal library in Ashburnham House. He worked to restore the collection from a dilapidated condition. He persuaded the Earl of Marlborough to ask for additional rooms in the palace for the books. This was granted, but Marlborough kept them for his personal use. Bentley enforced the law, ensuring that publishers delivered nearly one thousand volumes that had been purchased but not delivered.

The University of Cambridge commissioned Bentley to obtain Greek and Latin fonts for their classical books; he had these made in Holland. He assisted John Evelyn in his &quot;Numismata&quot;. Bentley did not settle down to the steady execution of any of the major projects he had started. In 1694, he designed an edition of Philostratus, but abandoned it to Gottfried Olearius (1672–1715), &quot;to the joy,&quot; says F. A. Wolf, &quot;of Olearius and of no one else.&quot; He supplied Graevius with collations of Cicero, and Joshua Barnes with a warning as to the spuriousness of the &quot;Epistles&quot; of Euripides. Barnes printed the epistles anyway and declared that no one could doubt their authenticity but a man who was &quot;perfrictae frontis aut judicii imminuti&quot; (boldfaced and lacking in judgment). For Graevius&#x27;s &quot;Callimachus&quot; (1697), Bentley added a collection of the fragments with notes.

He wrote the &quot;Dissertation on the Epistles of Phalaris&quot; (1699), his major academic work, almost accidentally. In 1697, William Wotton, about to bring out a second edition of his &quot;Ancient and Modern Learning&quot;, asked Bentley to write out a paper exposing the spuriousness of the &quot;Epistles&quot; of Phalaris, long a subject of academic controversy. The Christ Church editor of Phalaris, Charles Boyle, resented Bentley&#x27;s paper. He had already quarrelled with Bentley in trying to get the manuscript in the royal library collated for his edition (1695). Boyle wrote a response which was accepted by the reading public, although it was much later criticised as showing only superficial learning. The demand for Boyle&#x27;s book required a second printing. When Bentley responded, it was with his dissertation. The truth of its conclusions was not immediately recognised, but it has a high reputation.

===Master of Trinity College===
In 1700, the commissioners of ecclesiastical patronage recommended Bentley to the Crown for the mastership of Trinity College, Cambridge. He arrived an outsider and proceeded to reform the college administration. He started a programme of renovations to the buildings, and used his position to promote learning. He is also credited by the British mathematician Rouse Ball with starting the first written examinations in the West in 1702, all those prior to this being oral in nature. At the same time, he antagonised the fellows, and the capital programme caused reductions in their incomes, which they resented.

After ten years of stubborn but ineffectual resistance, the fellows appealed to the Visitor, the bishop of Ely (John Moore). Their petition was full of general complaints. Bentley&#x27;s reply (&quot;The Present State of Trinity College&quot;, etc., 1710) is in his most crushing style. The fellows amended their petition and added a charge of Bentley&#x27;s having committed 54 breaches of the statutes. Bentley appealed directly to the Crown, and backed his application with a dedication of his &quot;Horace&quot; to the lord treasurer (Harley).

The Crown lawyers decided against him; the case was heard (1714) and a sentence of expulsion from the mastership was drawn up. Before it was executed, the bishop of Ely died and the process lapsed. The feud continued in various forms at lower levels. In 1718 Cambridge rescinded Bentley&#x27;s degrees, as punishment for failing to appear in the vice-chancellor&#x27;s court in a civil suit. It was not until 1724 that he had them restored under the law.

In 1733 the fellows of Trinity again brought Bentley to trial before the bishop of Ely (then Thomas Greene), and he was sentenced to deprivation. The college statutes required the sentence to be executed by the vice-master Richard Walker, who was a friend of Bentley and refused to act. Although the feud continued until 1738 or 1740 (about thirty years in all), Bentley remained in his post.

===Later studies===
During his mastership, except for the first two years, Bentley continuously pursued his studies, although he did not publish much. In 1709 he contributed a critical appendix to John Davies&#x27;s edition of Cicero&#x27;s &quot;Tusculan Disputations&quot;. In the following year, he published his emendations on the &quot;Plutus&quot; and &quot;Nubes&quot; of Aristophanes, and on the fragments of Menander and Philemon. He published the last work under the pen name of &quot;Phileleutherus Lipsiensis.&quot; He used it again two years later in his &quot;Remarks on a late Discourse of Freethinking&quot;, a reply to Anthony Collins the deist. The university thanked him for this work and its support of the Anglican Church and clergy.

Although he had long studied Horace, Bentley wrote his edition quickly in the end, publishing it in 1711 to gain public support at a critical period of the Trinity quarrel. In the preface, he declared his intention of confining his attention to criticism and correction of the text. Some of his 700 or 800 emendations have been accepted, but the majority were rejected by the early 20th century as unnecessary, although scholars acknowledged they showed his wide learning.

In 1716, in a letter to William Wake, Archbishop of Canterbury, Bentley announced his plan to prepare a critical edition of the New Testament. During the next four years, assisted by J. J. Wetstein, an eminent biblical critic, he collected materials for the work. In 1720 he published &quot;Proposals for a New Edition of the Greek Testament&quot;, with examples of how he intended to proceed. By comparing the text of the Vulgate with that of the oldest Greek manuscripts, Bentley proposed to restore the Greek text as received by the church at the time of the Council of Nicaea. Bentley&#x27;s lead manuscript was &quot;Codex Alexandrinus&quot;, which he described as &quot;the oldest and best in the world.&quot; The manuscript was so precious to him that he rescued it from perishing in the Ashburnham House fire of 1731, during which many other Cotton Library manuscripts were destroyed. Bentley used also manuscripts: 51, 54, 60, 113, 440, 507, and 508. John Walker worked over many manuscripts for the project, particularly in Paris with the help of the Maurists. Numerous subscribers were obtained to support publication of the work, but he never completed it.

His &quot;Terence&quot; (1726) is more important than his &quot;Horace&quot;; next to the &quot;Phalaris&quot;, this most determined his reputation. In 1726 he also published the &quot;Fables&quot; of Phaedrus and the &quot;Sententiae&quot; of Publilius Syrus.

His &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; (1732), suggested by Queen Caroline, has been criticised as the weakest of his work. He suggested that the poet John Milton had employed both an amanuensis and an editor, who were responsible for clerical errors and interpolations, but it is unclear whether Bentley believed his own position. A. E. Housman, who called him &quot;the greatest scholar that England or perhaps that Europe ever bred&quot; nevertheless criticised his poetic sensibility severely: &quot;we are not all so easily found out as Bentley, because we have not Bentley&#x27;s intrepid candour. There is a sort of savage nobility about his firm reliance on his own bad taste&quot;.

Bentley never published his planned edition of Homer, but some of his manuscript and marginal notes are held by Trinity College. Their chief importance is in his attempt to restore the metre by the insertion of the lost digamma.

==Relationships and personal life==
According to the anonymous author of his biography in the &quot;Encyclopaedia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition, Bentley was self-assertive and presumptuous, which alienated some people. But, James Henry Monk, Bentley&#x27;s biographer, charged him (in his first edition, 1830) with an indecorum of which he was not guilty. Bentley seemed to inspire mixed feelings of admiration and repugnance.

==Marriage and family==
In 1701, Bentley married Joanna (died 1740), daughter of Sir John Bernard, 2nd Baronet of Brampton, Huntingdonshire. They had three children together: Richard (1708–1782), an eccentric, playwright and artist, and two daughters. Their daughter Johanna married Denison Cumberland in 1728, a grandson of Richard Cumberland the bishop of Peterborough, and himself later a bishop of the Church of Ireland. Their son Richard Cumberland developed as a prolific dramatist while earning his living as a civil servant.

==Later life==
In old age, Bentley continued to read and enjoyed the society of his friends and of several rising scholars, including Jeremiah Markland, John Taylor, and his nephews Richard and Thomas Bentley, with whom he discussed classical subjects. He died of pleurisy on 14 July 1742, at the age of 80.

==Legacy and honours==
Bentley left about £5,000 in his estate (which would have the buying power of nearly £500,000 in 2010). He bequeathed a few Greek manuscripts, brought from Mount Athos, to the Trinity College library and the remainder of his books and papers to his nephew Richard Bentley, a fellow of Trinity. At his own death in 1786, the younger Bentley left the papers to the Trinity College library. The British Museum eventually purchased the books, many of which had valuable manuscript notes, and holds them in its collection.

Bentley is honoured to this day at Spalding Grammar School, where he was once headmaster. One of the 6 houses that students are sorted into is named Bentley after him, with the students wearing the colour blue on their ties and on sporting items. Furthermore, the school releases an annual magazine named the Bentlian, also named after him.

According to the anonymous author of his biography in the &quot;Encyclopaedia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition, Bentley was the first Englishman to be ranked with the great heroes of classical learning. Before him there were only John Selden, and, in a more restricted field, Thomas Gataker and John Pearson.
The modern German school of philology recognised his genius. Bunsen wrote that Bentley &quot;was the founder of historical philology.&quot; Jakob Bernays says of his corrections of the &quot;Tristia&quot;, &quot;corruptions which had hitherto defied every attempt even of the mightiest, were removed by a touch of the fingers of this British Samson&quot;.

Bentley was credited with creating the English school of Hellenists, by which the 18th century was distinguished, including scholars such as Richard Dawes, Jeremiah Markland, John Taylor, Jonathan Toup, Thomas Tyrwhitt, Richard Porson, Peter Paul Dobree, Thomas Kidd and James Henry Monk. Although the Dutch school of the period had its own tradition, it was also influenced by Bentley. His letters to Tiberius Hemsterhuis on his edition of Julius Pollux made the latter one of Bentley&#x27;s most devoted admirers.

Bentley inspired a following generation of scholars. Self-taught, he created his own discipline; but no contemporary English guild of learning could measure his power or check his eccentricities. He defeated his academic adversaries in the Phalaris controversy. The attacks by Alexander Pope (he was assigned a niche in &quot;The Dunciad&quot;), John Arbuthnot and others demonstrated their inability to appreciate his work, as they considered textual criticism as pedantry. His classical controversies also called forth Jonathan Swift&#x27;s &quot;Battle of the Books&quot;.

In a university where the instruction of youth or the religious controversy of the day was the chief occupation, Bentley was unique. His learning and original views seem to have been developed before 1700. After this period, he acquired little and made only spasmodic efforts to publish. However A. E. Housman believed that the edition of Manilius (1739) was Bentley&#x27;s greatest work.

<text>Jeremiah Markland (18 October (or 29) 1693 – 7 July 1776) was an English classical scholar.

==Life==
He was born in Childwall in Lancashire (now Liverpool) on 29 (or 18) October 1693. 
He was educated at Christ&#x27;s Hospital and Peterhouse, Cambridge.

He left Cambridge in 1728 to act as private tutor to the son of W. Strode of Ponsbourne, Hertfordshire, returning to the university in 1733. 
At a later date he lived at Twyford, and in 1744 went to Uckfield, Sussex, in order to superintend the education of the son of his former pupil, Mr. Strode. 
In 1752 he fixed his abode at Milton Court, near Dorking, Surrey, and remained there, living in great privacy, to the end of his days.

He died at Milton Court, near Dorking.

==Works==
His most important works are
* &quot;Epistola critica: ad ... Franciscum Hare ... in qua Horatii loca aliquot et aliorum veterum emendantur&quot; (1723)
* the &quot;Sylvae&quot; of Statius (1728)
* notes to the editions of Lysias by Taylor, of Maximus of Tyre by Davies, of Euripides&#x27;s &quot;Hippolytus&quot; by Musgrave
* editions of Euripides&#x27;s &quot;Supplices&quot;, &quot;Iphigenia in Tauride&quot; and &quot;in Aulide&quot; (ed. T. Gaisford 1811)
* Remarks on the &quot;Epistles&quot; of Cicero to Brutus, and of Brutus to Cicero (1745).

<text>Jonathan Oannes Toup (19 December 1713 – 19 January 1785) was an English philologist, classical scholar and critic.

== Early life and education ==
Toup was born at St Ives, Cornwall in December 1713 and baptised on 5 January 1714. After the death of his father in 1721, Toup&#x27;s mother Prudence (née Busvargus) remarried, and Toup was adopted by her brother, William, the last male of the Busvargus family. Toup had one full sister, Mary, and two half-sisters, Prudence and Ann. After the death of Toup&#x27;s stepfather in 1763, Toup&#x27;s mother and all three of her daughters lived with him.

Toup was educated at St. Ives grammar school, and afterwards by the Rev. John Gurney, who kept a private school at St Merryn in Cornwall. From 15 March 1733 to 13 November 1739, Toup was battellar of Exeter College, Oxford, where John Upton was his tutor. He graduated B.A. on 14 October 1736, and later received his M.A. from Cambridge in 1756. He never married.

== Church positions ==
Toup was ordained a deacon on 6 March 1736, and three days later was licensed to the curacy of Philleigh in his native county. After two years, on 29 May 1738, he was licensed as curate of Buryan, also in Cornwall, having proceeded to priest&#x27;s orders on the previous day. Through the influence of his uncle Busvargus, he was presented on 28 July 1750 to the rectory of St. Martin&#x27;s-by-Looe, which position he held until his death.

When his name was once mentioned to the bishop of Exeter the response was &quot;Toup,--who is Toup?&quot; the reply being &quot;A poor curate in your diocese, my lord, but the greatest Greek scholar in Europe&quot;.

== Achievements ==
Toup&#x27;s reputation was established by his &quot;Emendationes in Suidam&quot;, the first part of which was published in 1760, the second part in 1764, and the third part in 1766. The &quot;Emendationes&quot; were followed by an &quot;Epistola Critica&quot; to Bishop Warburton in 1767, in which Toup made some derisive comments about Bishop Lowth, while flattering Warburton for his learning. A volume of &quot;Curae novissimae sive appendicula notarum et emendationum in Suidam&quot; was published in 1775.

Although the critical power and skill of these works earned Toup an immense reputation at home and abroad, he was also criticised for his &quot;immoderate language&quot; and &quot;boorish conduct.&quot; 
One scholar called Toup &quot;a piece of a coxcomb&quot; having &quot;superior airs&quot;; another called him a &quot;homo truculentus et maledicus&quot; (&quot;aggressive and slanderous man&quot;). 
Although Toup was reviled by some, others allowed that he was very charitable to the poor of his parish, and that his excessive self-confidence could be attributed to the fact that he lived apart, without sufficient personal intercourse with other scholars. He was said to have possessed an &quot;uncompromising independence of mind and a hatred of servility,&quot; and censure of others was with him more frequent than praise.

After a preparation of thirty-five years, Toup&#x27;s edition of Longinus, in Greek and Latin, was published in 1778. This edition included notes and emendations by David Ruhnken, whose assistance was mentioned on the title page. However, Ruhnken later regretted providing assistance to Toup, feeling that Toup had taken credit for his work and had not even sent him a presentation copy of the work when it was completed.

== Later years ==
On 14 May 1774, when Toup was more than sixty years old, he was appointed by Bishop Keppel to a prebendal stall at Exeter and was admitted on 29 July 1776 to the vicarage of St Merryn, the parish in which he had been partly educated. These preferments he held, with his rectory, to his death.

For some years before his death, Toup&#x27;s mental capacity was diminished, and he was cared for by his half-sister Ann and her three daughters. He died at St Martin&#x27;s rectory on 19 January 1785 and was buried under the communion table of the church. His property was left to his nephew John Toup Nicolas.

A small marble tablet was erected to his memory on the south wall of the church by his niece Phillis Blake. The tablet states that the excellence of Toup&#x27;s scholarship was &quot;known to the learned throughout Europe.&quot; The inscription on a round brass plate beneath the tablet records that the cost was defrayed by the delegates of the Oxford University Press.

<doc id="188943" wikidata="Q855271" url="?curid=188943" title="Battle of Jemappes">
<text>The Battle of Jemappes (6 November 1792) took place near the town of Jemappes in Hainaut, Austrian Netherlands (now Belgium), near Mons during the War of the First Coalition, part of the French Revolutionary Wars. One of the first major offensive battles of the war, it was a victory for the armies of the infant French Republic, and saw the French Armée du Nord, which included many inexperienced volunteers, defeat a substantially smaller regular Austrian army.

General Charles François Dumouriez, in command of an army of French Revolutionary volunteers, faced the Imperial army of Field Marshal Duke Albert of Saxe-Teschen and his second-in-command François de Croix, Count of Clerfayt. The French, who outnumbered their opponents by about three-to-one, launched a series of enthusiastic but uncoordinated attacks against the Austrian position on a ridge. At length, the French seized a portion of the ridge and the Austrians were unable to drive them away. Saxe-Teschen conceded defeat by ordering a withdrawal.

Jemappes was won by costly but effective charges against the Austrians&#x27; prepared position. Dumouriez overran the Austrian Netherlands within a month, but lost it at the Battle of Neerwinden in March. The French would not reconquer the Austrian Netherlands until the summer of 1794.

== Background ==
In the summer of 1792 Charles Dumouriez, the French foreign minister and commander of the Armée du Nord, had believed that the best way to prevent an Austrian and Prussian invasion of France was to invade the Austrian Netherlands, but the Allies had launched their invasion before Dumouriez was ready to move, and he had been forced to move south. The Allied invasion had been at Valmy on 20 September where the French army stood up to an artillery bombardment, and proved that it would not flee at the first sign of opposition. The Allied commander, the Duke of Brunswick, was not willing to risk a full-scale assault on the French line, and withdrew after it.

This left Dumouriez free to move north, to first raise the siege to Lille in late September and into early October, and then to launch his long-planned invasion of the Austrian Netherlands. His original plan for a three-pronged invasion had to be changed, as the promised resources to achieve it proved unavailable, and instead, at the end of October, he concentrated most of his men in front of Valenciennes and marched towards Mons, and the way to Brussels.

== Opposing forces ==

=== Austrians ===
The Austrian army was commanded by Duke Albert of Saxe-Teschen, the governor of the Austrian Netherlands. Although he had more than 20,000 troops available, they were scattered in a long defensive line, and so at Jemappes he fought with only 11,600 infantry, 2,170 cavalry and 56 guns. With this power, he tried to defend the long Cuesmes ridge which ran from Mons in the Austrian left to Jemappes on the right side.

The Austrian right was commanded by Franz Freiherr von Lilien, the center by Franz Sebastian de Croix, Count of Clerfayt and the left by Johann Peter Freiherr von Beaulieu. Lilien had seven companies and four infantry battalions and three squadrons of cavalry on their left while Clerfayt had three infantry battalions and four squadrons around the village of Cuesmes and Beaulieu had three battalions of infantry on the hills south of Bertaimont with five companies of infantry and a squadron of cavalry guarding his left. Two other companies were further to the left around Mont Palisel and an infantry battalion was at Mons.

The Austrian army positioned themselves on the marshes around the Trouille groves and rivers, with two dams to their rear. The only other way for a retreat was via Mons.

=== French ===
Dumouriez had twice as many men as the Austrians. His own Armée du Nord contained 32,000 infantry, 3,800 cavalry and 100 guns and was supported in Jemappes by a further 4,000 men and 15 guns under General François Harville. Dumouriez&#x27;s infantry battalions contained thirteen volunteers from 1792. Harville&#x27;s men were also volunteers, but most of the older commanders were either experienced soldiers or aristocrats. The most obvious example was the commander of the French center, the Duke of Chartres, who had assumed the name of General Egalite, and would later become King Louis-Philippe of France. The right wing was commanded by General Pierre de Ruel, marquis de Beurnonville and the left by General Louis Marie de la Caussade Ferrand who also carried the name Jean Henri Becays Ferrand. Harville was to reinforce the right.

Dumouriez planned to use his army&#x27;s numbers to overtake the Austrian position. The plan was for Harville and Beurnonville to attack first, and surround the weak Austrian left. Ferrand would then capture Quaregnon before Jemappes. Beurnonville would then attack the Austrian center while Harville moved to Mont Palisel to cut off the Austrian retreat.

== Battle ==
Saxe-Teschen entrenched his 11,628 infantry, 2,168 cavalry and 56 guns along the Cuesmes Ridge just a few kilometers west of Mons. The Austrian artillery included fourteen 12-lb cannon, thirty-six 6-lb and 3-lb cannon and six 7-lb howitzers. The north end of the position, defended by Feldmarschall-Leutnant Franz Freiherr von Lilien, was anchored on the village of Jemappes. Feldzeugmeister Count Clerfayt commanded the center and Feldmarschall-Leutnant Johann Peter Beaulieu led the left wing. The Austrian right wing faced to the west, while the center and the left wings faced toward the southwest. The village of Cuesmes lay behind the Austrian left. One flaw in the position was that an Austrian retreat could only be made across a single bridge over the Hain River.

Dumouriez had 32,000 infantry, 3,800 cavalry and 100 artillery pieces. He expected to be joined by an additional 4,000 troops on the right under General Louis Auguste Juvénal des Ursins d&#x27;Harville. (Digby Smith gave a total of 40,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry.) Dumouriez planned to turn both Austrian flanks. Accordingly, he divided his army into two wings, giving General Jean Henri Becays Ferrand command of the left wing and General Pierre de Ruel, marquis de Beurnonville control of the right wing. The French army was made up of a motley collection of royal army, volunteer, and national guard units.

The French made a series of &quot;ill-coordinated but enthusiastic&quot; attacks which began at dawn and continued throughout the morning. With momentum stalling Dumouriez ordered a renewed assault at noon. The Duke of Chartres sent a massive French column at the center of the ridge. This gained a foothold which the Austrians could not dislodge. Some French soldiers also enveloped the enemy right, threatening the Austrian rear. In response, Saxe-Teschen withdrew his right and center into Mons. Beaulieu ably covered the retreat with his left wing.

== Aftermath ==
The French reported approximately 650 dead and 1,300 wounded. One of the dead being Armand Gagné, the foster son of Marie Antoinette. The Austrians reported 305 dead, 513 wounded, plus 423 men and five guns captured. Many of the Austrian casualties were caused by the plentiful French artillery. The &quot;Bender&quot; Infantry Regiment Nr. 41 suffered especially heavy casualties, losing 14 officers and 400 rank and file. Mons surrendered to the French the day after the battle and Brussels fell on 14 November. The French populace &quot;went wild with joy&quot; at this first offensive victory of the war.

At first glance Jemappes was not an impressive French victory. The Austrians had suffered 818 casualties, and lost another 423 men taken prisoner, while France had a higher casualty rate and had failed to prevent the escape of a much smaller army to defend a position of danger. However, in the context of the situation in 1792, with the French army in chaos due to exile of many of its experienced officers, it was a great success. The victory at Jemappes, achieved by inexperienced volunteers over the Austrian regulars, greatly increased the confidence of the revolutionary government in Paris, and encouraged their tendency to aggressive warfare.

In the short-term Jemappes gave the French control of the Austrian Netherlands. Mons opened its doors to Dumouriez, and he remained there until 12 November. He then moved to Brussels, fighting a rearguard action in Anderlecht on 13 November, before capturing the city on 14 November. This first French occupation of Belgium would be short-lived, but in the few months that the revolutionaries managed to alienate the population, imposing their ideas of freedom on a conservative population. In 1793 Dumouriez was forced to flee into exile, but his victory at Jemappes was an important step in the direction of the military triumphs of the French Republic. In addition, it ensured that the majority of the battles fought in 1793 would occur outside the borders of France.

<doc id="188944" wikidata="Q294894" url="?curid=188944" title="Athlon 64">
<text>The Athlon 64 is a ninth-generation, AMD64-architecture microprocessor produced by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), released on September 23, 2003. It is the third processor to bear the name &quot;Athlon&quot;, and the immediate successor to the Athlon XP. The Athlon 64 was the second processor to implement the AMD64 architecture (after the Opteron) and the first 64-bit processor targeted at the average consumer. Variants of the Athlon 64 have been produced for Socket 754, Socket 939, Socket 940, and Socket AM2. It was AMD&#x27;s primary consumer CPU, and primarily competed with Intel&#x27;s Pentium 4, especially the &quot;Prescott&quot; and &quot;Cedar Mill&quot; core revisions.

The Athlon 64 is AMD&#x27;s first K8, eighth-generation processor core for desktop and mobile computers. Despite being natively 64-bit, the AMD64 architecture is backward-compatible with 32-bit x86 instructions. The Athlon 64 line was succeeded by the dual-core Athlon 64 X2 and Athlon X2 lines.

==Background==

The Athlon 64 was originally codenamed &quot;ClawHammer&quot; by AMD, and was referred to as such internally and in press releases. The first Athlon 64 FX was based on the first Opteron core, &quot;SledgeHammer&quot;. Both cores, produced on a 130 nanometer process, were first introduced on September 23, 2003. The models first available were the FX-51, fitting Socket 940, and the 3200+, fitting Socket 754. Like the Opteron, on which it was based, the Athlon FX-51 required buffered random-access memory (RAM), increasing the final cost of an upgrade. The week of the Athlon 64&#x27;s launch, Intel released the Pentium 4 Extreme Edition, a CPU designed to compete with the Athlon 64 FX. The Extreme Edition was widely considered a marketing ploy to draw publicity away from AMD, and was quickly nicknamed among some circles the &quot;Emergency Edition&quot;. Despite a very strong demand for the chip, AMD experienced early manufacturing difficulties that made it difficult to deliver Athlon 64s in quantity. In the early months of the Athlon 64 lifespan, AMD could only produce 100,000 chips per month. However, it was very competitive in terms of performance to the Pentium 4, with &quot;PC World&quot; calling it the &quot;fastest yet&quot;. The Athlon FX-51 also outperforming the Pentium 4 3.2C in &quot;Quake III Arena&quot; and &quot;Unreal Tournament 2003&quot; benchmark, according to &quot;Maximum PC&quot;. &quot;Newcastle&quot; was released soon after ClawHammer, with half the Level 2 cache.

===Single-core Athlon 64===

All the 64-bit processors sold by AMD so far have their genesis in the &quot;K8&quot; or &quot;Hammer&quot; project. On June 1, 2004, AMD released new versions of both the ClawHammer and Newcastle core revisions for the newly introduced Socket 939, an altered Socket 940 without the need for buffered memory. Socket 939 offered two main improvements over Socket 754: the memory controller was altered with dual-channel architecture, doubling peak memory bandwidth, and the HyperTransport bus was increased in speed from 800 MHz to 1000 MHz. Socket 939 also was introduced in the FX series in the form of the FX-55. At the same time, AMD also began to ship the &quot;Winchester&quot; core, based on a 90 nanometer process.

Core revisions &quot;Venice&quot; and &quot;San Diego&quot; succeeded all prior revisions on April 15, 2005. Venice, the lower-end part, was produced for both Sockets 754 and 939, and included 512 kB of L2 cache. San Diego, the higher-end chip, was produced only for Socket 939 and doubled Venice&#x27;s L2 cache to 1 MB. Both were produced on the 90 nm fabrication process. Both also included support for the SSE3 instruction set, a new feature that had been included in the rival Pentium 4 since the release of the Prescott core in February 2004. In addition, AMD overhauled the memory controller for this revision, resulting in performance improvements as well as support for newer DDR SDRAM.

===Dual-core Athlon 64===

On April 21, 2005, less than a week after the release of Venice and San Diego, AMD announced its next addition to the Athlon 64 line, the Athlon 64 X2. Released on May 31, 2005, it also initially had two different core revisions available to the public, Manchester and Toledo, the only appreciable difference between them being the amount of L2 cache. Both were released only for Socket 939. The Athlon 64 X2 was received very well by reviewers and the general public, with a general consensus emerging that AMD&#x27;s implementation of multi-core was superior to that of the competing Pentium D. Some felt initially that the X2 would cause market confusion with regard to price points since the new processor was targeted at the same &quot;enthusiast,&quot; US$350 and above market already occupied by AMD&#x27;s existing socket 939 Athlon 64s. AMD&#x27;s official breakdown of the chips placed the Athlon X2 aimed at a segment they called the &quot;prosumer&quot;, along with digital media fans. The Athlon 64 was targeted at the mainstream consumer, and the Athlon FX at gamers. The Sempron budget processor was targeted at value-conscious consumers. Following the launch of the Athlon 64 X2, AMD surpassed Intel in US retail sales for a period of time, although Intel retained overall market leadership because of its exclusive relationships with direct sellers such as Dell.

The Athlon 64 had been maligned by some critics for some time because of its lack of support for DDR2 SDRAM, an at the time emerging technology that had been adopted much earlier by Intel. AMD&#x27;s official position was that the CAS latency on DDR2 had not progressed to a point where it would be advantageous for the consumer to adopt it. AMD finally remedied this gap with the &quot;Orleans&quot; core revision, the first Athlon 64 to fit Socket AM2, released on May 23, 2006. &quot;Windsor&quot;, an Athlon 64 X2 revision for Socket AM2, was released concurrently. Both Orleans and Windsor have either 512 kB or 1 MB of L2 cache per core. The Athlon 64 FX-62 was also released concurrently on the Socket AM2 platform. Socket AM2 also uses less power than prior platforms, and supports AMD-V.

The memory controller used in all DDR2 SDRAM capable processors (Socket AM2), has extended column address range of 11 columns instead of conventional 10 columns, and the support of 16 kB page size, with at most 2048 individual entries supported. An OCZ unbuffered DDR2 kit, optimized for 64-bit operating systems, was released to exploit the functionality provided by the memory controller in socket AM2 processors, allowing the memory controller to stay longer on the same page, thus benefitting graphics intensive applications.

===Moving to the subnotebook space===
The Athlon architecture was further extended with the release of Athlon Neo processors on January 9, 2009. Based on the same architecture as the other Athlon 64 variants, the new processor features a small package footprint targeting Ultra-portable notebook market.
==Features==
There are four variants: &quot;Athlon 64&quot;, &quot;Athlon 64 FX&quot;, &quot;Mobile Athlon 64&quot; (later renamed &quot;Turion 64&quot;) and the dual-core &quot;Athlon 64 X2&quot;. Common among the Athlon 64 line are a variety of instruction sets including MMX, 3DNow!, SSE, SSE2, and SSE3. All Athlon 64s also support the NX bit, a security feature named &quot;Enhanced Virus Protection&quot; by AMD. And as implementations of the AMD64 architecture, all Athlon 64 variants are able to run 16 bit, 32 bit x86, and AMD64 code, through two different modes the processor can run in: &quot;Legacy mode&quot; and &quot;long mode&quot;. Legacy mode runs 16-bit and 32-bit programs natively, and long mode runs 64-bit programs natively, but also allows for 32-bit programs running inside a 64-bit operating system. All Athlon 64 processors feature 128 Kilobytes of level 1 cache, and at least 512 kB of level 2 cache.

===On-die memory controller===
The Athlon 64 features an on-die memory controller, a feature formerly seen on only the Transmeta Crusoe. This means the controller runs at the same clock rate as the CPU, and that the electrical signals have a shorter physical distance to travel compared to the old northbridge interfaces. The result is a significant reduction in latency (response time) for access requests to main memory. The lower latency was often cited as one of the advantages of the Athlon 64&#x27;s architecture over those of its competitors at the time.

===Memory and HT Northbridge buses===
As the memory controller is integrated onto the CPU die, there is no FSB for the system memory to base its speed upon. Instead, system memory speed is obtained by using the following formula (using the ceiling function):

:formula_1

In simpler terms, the memory is always running at a set fraction of the CPU speed, with the divisor being a whole number. An &#x27;FSB&#x27; figure is still used to determine the CPU speed, but the RAM speed is no longer directly related to this &#x27;FSB&#x27; figure (known otherwise as the LDT).

A second bus, the northbridge, connected the CPU to the chipset and device attachment bus (PCIe, AGP, PCI). This was implemented using a new high-performance standard, HyperTransport. AMD attempted, with some success, to make this an industry standard. It was also useful in building multi-processor systems without additional glue chips.

===Translation lookaside buffers===
Translation lookaside buffers (TLBs) have also been enlarged (40 4k/2M/4M entries in L1 cache, 512 4k entries), with reduced latencies and improved branch prediction, with four times the number of bimodal counters in the global history counter. This and other architectural enhancements, especially as regards SSE implementation, improve instructions per cycle (|IPC) performance over the prior Athlon XP generation. To make this easier for consumers to understand, AMD has chosen to market the Athlon 64 using a PR (Performance Rating) system, where the numbers roughly map to Pentium 4 performance equivalents, rather than actual clock speed.

===Cool&#x27;n&#x27;Quiet===
Athlon 64 also features CPU speed throttling technology branded &quot;Cool&#x27;n&#x27;Quiet&quot;, a feature similar to Intel&#x27;s &quot;SpeedStep&quot; that can throttle the processor&#x27;s clock speed back to facilitate lower power use and heat output. When the user is running undemanding applications and the load on the processor is light, the processor clock speed and voltage are reduced. This in turn reduces its peak power use (max thermal design power (TDP) set at 89 W by AMD) to as low as 32 W (stepping level C0, clock speed reduced to 800 MHz) or 22W (stepping CG, clock speed reduced to 1 GHz). The Athlon 64 also has an &quot;integrated heat spreader&quot; (IHS) which prevents the CPU die from being damaged accidentally when mounting and unmounting heat sinks. With prior AMD CPUs, a CPU shim could be used by people worried about damaging the die.

===NX bit===
The &quot;No Execute bit&quot; (NX bit) supported by Windows XP Service Pack 2 and future versions of Windows, Linux 2.6.8 and higher and FreeBSD 5.3 and higher is also included, for improved protection from malicious buffer overflow security threats. Hardware-set permission levels make it much more difficult for malicious code to take control of the system. It is intended to make 64-bit computing a more secure environment.

===Semiconductor Technology===
The Athlon 64 CPUs have been produced with 130 and 90 nm silicon on insulator (SOI) process technologies. All of the latest chips (Winchester, Venice, and San Diego models) are on 90 nm. The Venice and San Diego models also incorporate dual stress liner technology (an amalgam of strained silicon and &#x27;squeezed silicon&#x27;, the latter of which is not actually a technology) co-developed with IBM.

==Processor cores==

===Athlon 64 FX===
The Athlon 64 FX is positioned as a hardware enthusiast product, marketed by AMD especially toward gamers. Unlike the standard Athlon 64, all of the Athlon 64 FX processors have their multipliers completely unlocked. Starting with the FX-60, the FX line became dual-core. The FX always has the highest clock speed of all Athlons at its release. From FX-70 onwards, the line of processors will also support dual-processor setup with NUMA, named AMD Quad FX platform.

===Athlon 64 X2===

The Athlon 64 X2 is the first dual-core desktop CPU manufactured by AMD.
In 2007, AMD released two final Athlon 64 X2 versions: the AMD Athlon 64 X2 6400+ and 5000+ Black Editions. Both processors feature an unlocked multiplier, which allows for a large range of overclocked settings. The 6400+ is based on a 90 nm Windsor core (3.2 GHz, 2x1 MB L2, 125 W TDP) while the 5000+ is based on a 65 nm Brisbane core (2.6 GHz, 2 x 512 kB L2, 65 W TDP). These Black Edition processors are available at retail, but AMD does not include heatsinks in the retail package.

===Turion 64 (formerly Mobile Athlon 64)===

Formerly introduced as &quot;Mobile Athlon 64&quot;, &quot;Turion 64&quot; is now the brand name AMD applies to its 64-bit low-power use (&quot;mobile&quot;) processors. The Turion 64 and Turion 64 X2 processors compete with Intel&#x27;s mobile processors, initially the &quot;Pentium M&quot; and later the Intel Core and Intel Core 2 processors.

Earlier Turion 64 processors are compatible with AMD&#x27;s Socket 754. The newer &quot;Richmond&quot; models are designed for AMD&#x27;s Socket S1. They are equipped with 512 or 1024 kB of L2 cache, a 64-bit single channel on-die memory controller, and an 800 MHz HyperTransport bus. Battery saving features, like &quot;PowerNow!&quot;, are central to the marketing and usefulness of these CPUs.

====Model naming methodology====
The model naming scheme does not make it obvious how to compare one Turion with another, or even an Athlon 64. The model name is two letters, a dash, and a two digit number (for example, ML-34). The two letters together designate a processor class, while the number represents a PR rating. The first letter is M for single core processors and T for dual core Turion 64 X2 processors. The later in the alphabet that the second letter appears, the more the model has been designed for mobility (low power use). Take for example, an MT-30 and an ML-34. Since the T in the MT-30 is later in the alphabet than the L in ML-34, the MT-30 uses less power than the ML-34. But since 34 is greater than 30, the ML-34 is faster than the MT-30.

===Athlon Neo===
With 27 mm × 27 mm in size and 2.5 mm in thickness, the Athlon Neo processors utilize a new package called &quot;ASB1&quot;, essentially a BGA package, for smaller footprint to allow smaller designs for notebooks and lowering the cost. The clock of the processors is significantly lower than desktop and other mobile counterparts to reach a low TDP, at 15W maximum for a single core x86-64 CPU at 1.6 GHz. The Athlon Neo processors are equipped with 512 kB of L2 cache and HyperTransport 1.0 running at 800 MHz frequency.

==Sockets==
* Socket 754: The Athlon 64 value/budget line, 64-bit memory interface (Single-Channel)
* Socket 939: Athlon 64 performance line, Athlon 64 X2s, and newer Athlon 64 FXs, Opteron, 128-bit memory interface (Dual-channel)
* Socket 940: Opteron and old Athlon 64 FX, 128-bit memory interface - requires registered DDR memory
* Socket AM2: Athlon 64/Athlon 64 FX/Athlon 64 X2/Sempron, 940 Pins (Not compatible with Socket 940); the first AMD socket to use DDR2 SDRAM.
* Socket F: Opteron, 1207 Pins
* Socket F (1207 FX): Athlon 64 FX on AMD Quad FX platform, also compatible for dual-processor Opteron 2200 series

At the introduction of Athlon 64 in September 2003, only Socket 754 and Socket 940 (Opteron) were ready and available. The onboard memory controller was not capable of running unbuffered (non-registered) memory in dual-channel mode at the time of release; as a stopgap measure, they introduced the Athlon 64 on Socket 754, and brought out a non-multiprocessor version of the Opteron called the Athlon 64 FX, as a multiplier unlocked enthusiast part for Socket 940, comparable to Intel&#x27;s Pentium 4 Extreme Edition for the high end market.

In June 2004, AMD released Socket 939 as the mainstream Athlon 64 with dual-channel memory interface, leaving Socket 940 solely for the server market (Opterons), and relegating Socket 754 as a value/budget line, for Semprons and slower versions of the Athlon 64. Eventually Socket 754 replaced Socket A for Semprons.

In May 2006, AMD released Socket AM2, which provided support for the DDR2 memory interface. Also, this marked the release of AMD-V.

In August 2006, AMD released Socket F for Opteron server CPU which uses the LGA chip form factor.

In November 2006, AMD released a specialized version of Socket F, called 1207 FX, for dual-socket, dual-core Athlon FX processors on the Quad FX platform. While Socket F Opterons already allowed for four processor cores, Quad FX allowed unbuffered RAM and expanded CPU/chipset configuration in the BIOS. Consequentially, Socket F and F 1207 FX are incompatible and require different processors, chipsets, and motherboards.

<text>In mathematics, the disjoint union (or discriminated union) formula_1 of the sets and is the set formed from the elements of and labelled (indexed) with the name of the set from which they come. So, an element belonging to both and appears twice in the disjoint union, with two different labels. 

A disjoint union of an indexed family of sets formula_2 is a set formula_3 often denoted by formula_4 with an injection of each formula_5 into formula_3 such that the images of these injections form a partition of formula_7 (that is, each element of formula_7 belongs to exactly one of these images). A disjoint union of a family of pairwise disjoint sets is their union.

In category theory, the disjoint union is the coproduct of the category of sets, and thus defined up to a bijection. In this context, the notation formula_9 is often used.

The disjoint union of two sets formula_7 and formula_11 is written with infix notation as formula_1. Some authors use the alternative notation formula_13 or formula_14 (along with the corresponding formula_15 or formula_16). 

A standard way for building the disjoint union is to define formula_7 as the set of ordered pairs formula_18 such that formula_19 and the injection formula_20 as formula_21

== Example ==

Consider the sets formula_22 and formula_23 It is possible to index the set elements according to set origin by forming the associated sets
formula_24

where the second element in each pair matches the subscript of the origin set (for example, the formula_25 in formula_26 matches the subscript in formula_27 etc.). The disjoint union formula_28 can then be calculated as follows:
formula_29

== Set theory definition ==

Formally, let formula_30 be an indexed family of sets indexed by formula_31 The disjoint union of this family is the set
formula_32 
The elements of the disjoint union are ordered pairs formula_33 Here formula_34 serves as an auxiliary index that indicates which formula_5 the element formula_36 came from.

Each of the sets formula_5 is canonically isomorphic to the set
formula_38
Through this isomorphism, one may consider that formula_5 is canonically embedded in the disjoint union. 
For formula_40 the sets formula_41 and formula_42 are disjoint even if the sets formula_5 and formula_44 are not. 

In the extreme case where each of the formula_5 is equal to some fixed set formula_7 for each formula_47 the disjoint union is the Cartesian product of formula_7 and formula_49:
formula_50

Occasionally, the notation
formula_51
is used for the disjoint union of a family of sets, or the notation formula_52 for the disjoint union of two sets. This notation is meant to be suggestive of the fact that the cardinality of the disjoint union is the sum of the cardinalities of the terms in the family. Compare this to the notation for the Cartesian product of a family of sets. 

In the language of category theory, the disjoint union is the coproduct in the category of sets. It therefore satisfies the associated universal property. This also means that the disjoint union is the categorical dual of the Cartesian product construction. See &quot;Coproduct&quot; for more details.

For many purposes, the particular choice of auxiliary index is unimportant, and in a simplifying abuse of notation, the indexed family can be treated simply as a collection of sets. In this case formula_41 is referred to as a {{em|copy}} of formula_5 and the notation formula_55 is sometimes used.

== Category theory point of view ==

In category theory the disjoint union is defined as a coproduct in the category of sets. 

As such, the disjoint union is defined up to an isomorphism, and the above definition is just one realization of the coproduct, among others. When the sets are pairwise disjoint, the usual union is another realization of the coproduct. This justifies the second definition in the lead.

This categorical aspect of the disjoint union explains why formula_56 is frequently used, instead of formula_57 to denote &quot;coproduct&quot;.

<text>A quest is a journey toward a specific mission or a goal. It serves as a plot device in mythology and fiction: a difficult journey towards a goal, often symbolic or allegorical. Tales of quests figure prominently in the folklore of every nation and ethnic culture. In literature, the object of a quest requires great exertion on the part of the hero, who must overcome many obstacles, typically including much travel. The aspect of travel allows the storyteller to showcase exotic locations and cultures (an objective of the narrative, not of the character). The object of a quest may also have supernatural properties, often leading the protagonist into other worlds and dimensions. The moral of a quest tale often centers on the changed character of the hero.

==Quest objects==

The hero normally aims to obtain something or someone by the quest, and with this object to return home. The object can be something new, that fulfills a lack in their life, or something that was stolen away from them or someone with authority to dispatch them.

Sometimes the hero has no desire to return; Sir Galahad&#x27;s quest for the Holy Grail is to find it, not return with it. A return may, indeed, be impossible: Aeneas quests for a homeland, having lost Troy at the beginning of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid,&quot; and he does not return to Troy to re-found it but settles in Italy (to become an ancestor of the Romans).

If the hero does return after the culmination of the quest, they may face false heroes who attempt to pass themselves off as them, or their initial response may be a rejection of that return, as Joseph Campbell describes in his critical analysis of quest literature, &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot;.

If someone dispatches the hero on a quest, the overt reason may be false, with the dispatcher actually sending them on the difficult quest in hopes of their death in the attempt, or in order to remove them from the scene for a time, just as if the claim were sincere, except that the tale usually ends with the dispatcher being unmasked and punished. Stories with such false quest-objects include the legends of Jason and Perseus, the fairy tales &quot;The Dancing Water, the Singing Apple, and the Speaking Bird&quot;, &quot;Go I Know Not Whither and Fetch I Know Not What&quot;, and the story of &quot;Beren and Lúthien&quot; in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;.

The quest object may, indeed, function only as a convenient reason for the hero&#x27;s journey. Such objects are termed MacGuffins. When a hero is on a quest for several objects that are only a convenient reason for their journey, they are termed plot coupons.

==Literary analysis==
The quest, in the form of the hero&#x27;s journey, plays a central role in the monomyth described by Joseph Campbell; the hero sets forth from the world of common day into a land of adventures, tests, and magical rewards. Most times in a quest, the knight in shining armor wins the heart of a beautiful maiden/princess.

==Historical examples==
An early quest story tells the tale of Gilgamesh, who seeks the secret to eternal life after the death of his friend Enkidu.

Another ancient quest tale, Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, tells of Odysseus, whom the gods have cursed to wander and suffer for many years before Athena persuades the Olympians to allow him to return home. Recovering the Golden Fleece is the object of the travels of Jason and the Argonauts in the &quot;Argonautica&quot;. Psyche, having lost Cupid, hunted through the world for him, and was set tasks by Venus, including a descent into the underworld.

Many fairy tales depict the hero or heroine setting out on a quest, such as:

* &quot;East of the Sun and West of the Moon&quot; where the heroine seeks her husband
* &quot;The Seven Ravens&quot; where the heroine seeks her transformed brothers
* &quot;The Story of the Youth Who Went Forth to Learn What Fear Was&quot;
* &quot;The Golden Bird&quot; where the prince sets out to find the golden bird for his father

Other characters may set out with no more definite aim than to &quot;seek their fortune&quot;, or even be cast out instead of voluntarily leaving, but learn of something that could aid them along the way and so have their journey transformed from aimless wandering into a quest. Other characters can also set forth on quests — the hero&#x27;s older brothers commonly do — but the hero is distinguished by their success.

Many medieval romances sent knights out on quests. The term &quot;knight-errant&quot; sprang from this, as &quot;errant&quot; meant &quot;roving&quot; or &quot;wandering&quot;. Thomas Malory included many in &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;. The most famous—perhaps in all of western literature—centers on the Holy Grail in Arthurian legend. This story cycle recounts multiple quests, in multiple variants, telling stories both of the heroes who succeed, like Percival (in Wolfram von Eschenbach&#x27;s &quot;Parzival&quot;) or Sir Galahad (in the ), and also the heroes who fail, like Sir Lancelot. This often sent them into a bewildering forest. Despite many references to its pathlessness, the forest repeatedly confronts knights with forks and crossroads, of a labyrinthine complexity. The significance of their encounters is often explained to the knights—particularly those searching for the Holy Grail—by hermits acting as wise old people. Still, despite their perils and chances of error, such forests, being the location where the knight can obtain the end of their quest, are places where the knights may become worthy; one romance has a maiden urging Sir Lancelot on his quest for the Holy Grail, &quot;which quickens with life and greenness like the forest&quot;.

So consistently did knights quest that Miguel de Cervantes set his &quot;Don Quixote&quot; on mock quests in a parody of chivalric tales. Nevertheless, while Don Quixote was a fool, he was and remains a hero of chivalry.

==Modern literature==
Quests continued in modern literature. Analysis can interpret many (perhaps most) stories as a quest in which the main character is seeking something that they desire, but the literal structure of a journey seeking something is, itself, still common. Quests often appear in fantasy literature, as in &quot;Rasselas&quot; by Samuel Johnson, or &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, where Dorothy, Scarecrow (Oz), the Tin Woodman, and the Cowardly Lion go on a quest for the way back to Kansas, brains, a heart, and courage respectively. Quests also play a major role in Rick Riordan&#x27;s fantasy books, among them &quot;Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians&quot;, &quot;The Heroes of Olympus&quot;, and &quot;The Kane Chronicles&quot;, and in dark fantasy novel &quot;The Talisman&quot; by Stephen King and Peter Straub.

A familiar modern literary quest is Frodo Baggins&#x27;s quest to destroy the One Ring in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. The One Ring, its baleful power, the difficult method which is the only way to destroy it, and the spiritual and psychological torture it wreaks on its bearer; J. R. R. Tolkien uses all these elements to tell a meaningful tale of friendship and the inner struggle with temptation, against a background of epic and supernatural warfare.

&quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; is often thought of as a quest plot, detailing Holden&#x27;s search not for a tangible object, but for a sense of purpose or reason.

Some writers, however, may devise arbitrary quests for items without any importance beyond being the object of the quest. These items are known as MacGuffins, which is sometimes merely used to compare quests and is not always a derogatory term. Writers may also motivate characters to pursue these objects by meanings of a prophecy that decrees it, rather than have them discover that it could assist them, for reasons that are given.

<text>Acting Sheriff is an unsold, half-hour television pilot sitcom created by Walt Disney Television for television network CBS that aired across the United States on Saturday, August 17, 1991. Identified as episode number 895 in Walt Disney Television season number 35, the 30-minute comedy drama featured Robert Goulet as B movie actor Brent McCord who is elected to the unlikely job of sheriff in a small Northern California town. With only an actor&#x27;s knowledge and experience of what a sheriff does, the McCord character clashes with the local district attorney, character Donna Singer, and eventually lets a bank robber-prisoner escape. Character Mike Swanson, a deputy who is loyal to McCord, captures the escaped prisoner and helps cover for McCord&#x27;s mistake by informing news reporters that McCord made the capture.

==Response==
Initially, &quot;Acting Sheriff&quot; was thought to have a good chance of filling the Saturday, 10:30 PM slot in the CBS 1991 fall television schedule. In addition to the draw of noted actor Robert Goulet, the show was developed by the writing team of Larry Strawther and Gary Murphy, who were the writers of &quot;Night Court,&quot; a then-widely popular American television situation comedy, and the writers of &quot;Without a Clue&quot;, a 1988 comedy film starring Michael Caine and Ben Kingsley. However, the one-time-only, August 17, 1991, presentation of &quot;Acting Sheriff&quot; received poor ratings.

In the August 21, 1991 Prime time ratings for the week of August 12 to August 18, &quot;Acting Sheriff&quot; received a 4.6 share and was ranked as number 83 out of a total of 90 prime time television shows. The 4.6 share represented 4.3 million TV homes out of a possible 93.1 million TV homes. Despite the poor showing by &quot;Acting Sheriff,&quot; CBS tied television network ABC for first place in the August 12 to August 18 network ratings battle. CBS eventually filled the Saturday 10:30 PM to 11:00 PM primetime slot with 48 Hours, a documentary and news program broadcast on the CBS television network since January 19, 1988.

Critic reactions were mixed. The Florida daily newspaper &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; rated &quot;Acting Sheriff&quot; a &quot;best bet.&quot; However, the weekly entertainment trade newspaper Variety found the Brent McCord character too to support the show as a series. In describing Goulet&#x27;s performance as Brent McCord, Variety stated that it was &quot;a goof on Ronald Reagan by way of Ted Baxter&quot; and came across as a &quot;, ACLU-bashing whose disregard for the law is equaled only by his vanity.&quot; Variety also faulted the show&#x27;s appearance and other characters as too closely resembling the look, feel, and characters of Night Court. Fourteen years later, American actor Lee Tergesen, who was on &quot;Acting Sheriff&quot; with Robert Goulet, characterized Goulet&#x27;s performance as &quot;quite good.&quot;

==Reaction to response==
The August 17, 1991, airing of the show was its only airing. In a December 1991 effort to raise more than $200 million to finance Disney&#x27;s network television business, Disney created Zero Coupon Based Rate Adjustment Securities (&quot;ZEBRAS&quot;) as promissory notes to be used to obtain money from the investing public. Disney added &quot;Acting Sheriff&quot; and other television projects such as &quot;Lenny,&quot; &quot;The Fanelli Boys,&quot; &quot;Singer &amp; Sons,&quot; and &quot;Stat&quot; to the ZEBRAS. Even though &quot;Acting Sheriff&quot; and the other projects were considered &quot;dead dogs&quot; by some, Disney presented ZEBRAS as a way for the public to buy into programming Walt Disney Television that was started in October 1988 and profiting from possible hits similar to &quot;Blossom&quot;, &quot;Golden Girls&quot;, and &quot;Empty Nest&quot;.

The 15-year ZEBRA zero-coupon bonds carried a guaranteed yield of 4% with a promise of up to a 20% return if &quot;Acting Sheriff&quot; or any of the other included shows were sold into syndication. The bonds were seen both as innovative and controversial by tying their investment return to the performance of Disney&#x27;s television shows. With analysts saying the deal was not a good one for investors, the ZEBRAS were not successful. Disney ended their offerings 23 days after the program started, citing falling interest rates as a reason for terminating the ZEBRA program.

Interest in &quot;Acting Sheriff&quot; largely remained dormant for the next thirteen years. However, in 2004, &quot;Acting Sheriff&quot; made its way onto the August 16, 2004, television show, &quot;The Best TV Shows That Never Were.&quot; As one of 40+ reviewed television pilots from a pool of thousands available pilots, clips of &quot;Acting Sheriff&quot; were used by &quot;The Best TV Shows That Never Were&quot; show to insinuate that it was one of the worst aired pilots. In reviewing &quot;The Best TV Shows That Never Were&quot;, the New York Post ranked &quot;Acting Sheriff&quot; along the lines of the pilot for a &quot;mellow John Denver cast against type as a two-fisted FBI agent in the mountain adventure &quot;Higher Ground&quot;&quot; and the pilot where Tom Selleck and Robert Urich co-starred in the cop drama &quot;Bunco.&quot;

<doc id="188955" wikidata="Q11297" url="?curid=188955" title="Headquarters of the United Nations">
<text>The headquarters of the United Nations (UN) is on of grounds in the Turtle Bay neighborhood of Midtown Manhattan in New York City. It borders First Avenue to the west, 42nd Street to the south, 48th Street to the north, and the East River to the east. Completed in 1952, the complex consists of several structures, including the Secretariat, Conference, and General Assembly buildings, and the Dag Hammarskjöld Library. The complex was designed by a board of architects led by Wallace Harrison and built by the architectural firm Harrison &amp; Abramovitz, with final projects developed by Oscar Niemeyer and Le Corbusier. The term &quot;Turtle Bay&quot; is occasionally used as a metonym for the UN headquarters or for the United Nations as a whole.

The headquarters holds the seats of the principal organs of the UN, including the General Assembly and the Security Council, but excluding the International Court of Justice, which is seated in The Hague. The United Nations has three additional subsidiary regional headquarters or headquarters districts. These were opened in Geneva (Switzerland) in 1946, Vienna (Austria) in 1980, and Nairobi (Kenya) in 1996. These adjunct offices help represent UN interests, facilitate diplomatic activities, and enjoy certain extraterritorial privileges, but do not contain the seats of major organs.

Although the structure is physically situated in the United States, the land occupied by the United Nations headquarters and the spaces of buildings that it rents are under the sole administration of the United Nations. They are technically extraterritorial through a treaty agreement with the U.S. government. However, in exchange for local police, fire protection, and other services, the United Nations agrees to acknowledge most local, state, and federal laws.

None of the United Nations&#x27; 15 specialized agencies, such as UNESCO, are located at the headquarters. However, some autonomous subsidiary organs, such as UNICEF, are based at the UN&#x27;s headquarters in New York City.

==History==

===Planning===

====Site====
The headquarters of the United Nations occupies a site beside the East River between 42nd and 48th Streets, on between of land purchased from the real estate developer William Zeckendorf Sr. At the time, the site was part of Turtle Bay, which contained slaughterhouses and tenement buildings, as well as the original Eberhard Faber Pencil Factory and, by the 1910s, a gas company building on the site of the current UN headquarters. The development of Sutton Place and Beekman Place, north of the current UN site, came in the 1920s. A yacht club on the site was proposed in 1925, but it proved to be too expensive.

In 1946, Zeckendorf purchased the land with the intention to create a futuristic, self-contained city called &quot;X City&quot; on the site. This complex was to contain an office building and a hotel, each 57 stories tall, and an entertainment complex between them. X City would have also had smaller apartment and office towers. However, the US$8.5 million ($ million in ) for X City never materialized, and Nelson Rockefeller purchased an option for Zeckendorf&#x27;s waterfront land in Turtle Bay. The purchase was funded by Nelson&#x27;s father, John D. Rockefeller Jr. The Rockefeller family owned the Tudor City Apartments across First Avenue from the Zeckendorf site. The city, in turn, spent $5 million ($ million in ) on clearing the land. Rockefeller donated the site to the UN in December 1946. The UN accepted this donation, despite the objections of several prominent architects such as Le Corbusier.

====Design====
While the United Nations had dreamed of constructing an independent city for its new world capital, multiple obstacles soon forced the organization to downsize its plans. They ultimately decided to build on Rockefeller&#x27;s East River plot, since the land was free and the land&#x27;s owners were well known. The diminutive site on the East River necessitated a Rockefeller Center–type vertical complex, thus, it was a given that the Secretariat would be housed in a tall office tower. During daily meetings from February to June 1947, the collaborative team produced at least 45 designs and variations. Rather than hold a competition for the design of the facilities for the headquarters, the UN decided to commission a multinational team of leading architects to collaborate on the design. Wallace K. Harrison was named as Director of Planning, and a Board of Design Consultants was composed of architects, planners and engineers nominated by member governments. The board consisted of N. D. Bassov of the Soviet Union, Gaston Brunfaut (Belgium), Ernest Cormier (Canada), Le Corbusier (France), Liang Seu-cheng (China), Sven Markelius (Sweden), Oscar Niemeyer (Brazil), Howard Robertson (United Kingdom), Garnet Argyle Soilleux (Australia), and Julio Vilamajó (Uruguay). The design process for the United Nations headquarters formally began in February 1947.

Niemeyer met with Corbusier at the latter&#x27;s request shortly after the former arrived in New York City. Corbusier had already been lobbying hard to promote his own scheme 23, and thus, requested that Niemeyer not submit a design, lest he further confuse the contentious meetings of the Board of Design. Instead, Corbusier asked the younger architect Niemeyer to assist him with his project. Niemeyer began to absent himself from the meetings. Only after Wallace Harrison and Max Abramovitz repeatedly pressed him to participate did Niemeyer agree to submit his own project. Niemeyer&#x27;s project 32 was finally chosen, but as opposed to Corbusier&#x27;s project 23, which consisted of one building containing both the Assembly Hall and the councils in the center of the site (as it was hierarchically the most important building), Niemeyer&#x27;s plan split the councils from the Assembly Hall, locating the first alongside the river, and the second on the right side of the secretariat. This would not split the site, but on the contrary, would create a large civic square.
After much discussion, Harrison, who coordinated the meetings, determined that a design based on Niemeyer&#x27;s Project 32 and Le Corbusier&#x27;s Project 23 would be developed for the final project. Le Corbusier&#x27;s Project 23 consisted of a large block containing both the Assembly Hall and the Council Chambers near the center of the site with the Secretariat tower emerging as a slab from the south. Niemeyer&#x27;s plan was closer to that constructed, with a distinctive General Assembly Building, a long low horizontal block housing the other meeting rooms, and a tall tower for the Secretariat. The Board of Design presented their final plans for the United Nations headquarters in May 1947. The plans called for a 45-story Secretariat tower at the south end of the site, a 30-story office building at the north end, and several low-rise structures (including the General Assembly Building) in between. The complex, as built, repositioned Niemeyer&#x27;s General Assembly building to the north of this tripartite composition. This plan included a public plaza as well. The UN headquarters was originally proposed alongside a grand boulevard leading eastward from Third Avenue or Lexington Avenue, between 46th Street to the south and 49th Street to the north. These plans were eventually downsized into Dag Hammarskjöld Plaza, a small plaza on the south side of 47th Street east of Second Avenue.

Wallace Harrison&#x27;s assistant, architect George Dudley, later stated: &quot;It literally took our breath away to see the simple plane of the site kept open from First Avenue to the River, only three structures on it, standing free, a fourth lying low behind them along the river&#x27;s edge...[Niemeyer] also said, &#x27;beauty will come from the buildings being in the right space!&#x27;. The comparison between Le Corbusier&#x27;s heavy block and Niemeyer&#x27;s startling, elegantly articulated composition seemed to me to be in everyone&#x27;s mind...&quot; Later on, Corbusier came once again to Niemeyer and asked him to reposition the Assembly Hall back to the center of the site. Such modification would destroy Niemeyer&#x27;s plans for a large civic square. However, he finally decided to accept the modification; together, they submitted the scheme 23–32, which was built and is what can be seen today. Along with suggestions from the other members of the Board of Design Consultants, this was developed into project 42G. This late project was built with some reductions and other modifications.

====Proposed alternatives====

Many cities vied for the honor of hosting the UN Headquarters site, before the selection of New York City. The selection of the East River site came after over a year of protracted study and consideration of many sites in the United States. A powerful faction among the delegates advocated returning to the former League of Nations complex in Geneva, Switzerland. A wide variety of suggestions were made, including such fanciful suggestions as a ship on the high seas to housing the entire complex in a single tall building. Amateur architects submitted designs, and local governments offered park areas, but the determined group of New York City boosters that included Grover Whalen, Thomas J. Watson, and Nelson Rockefeller, coordinated efforts with the Coordinator of Construction, Robert Moses, and Mayor William O&#x27;Dwyer, to assemble acceptable interim facilities. Sites in San Francisco (including the Presidio) and Marin County in California; St. Louis, Missouri; Boston, Massachusetts; Chicago, Illinois; Fairfield County, Connecticut; Westchester County and Flushing Meadows–Corona Park in New York; Tuskahoma, Oklahoma; the Black Hills of South Dakota; Belle Isle in Detroit, Michigan; and a site on Navy Island straddling the US–Canada border were considered as potential sites for the UN Headquarters. San Francisco, where the UN was founded in 1945, was favored by Australia, New Zealand, China, and the Philippines due to the city&#x27;s proximity to their countries. The UN and many of its delegates seriously considered Philadelphia for the headquarters; the government of Philadelphia offered to donate land in several areas, including Fairmount Park, Andorra, and a Center City location which would have placed the headquarters along a mall extending from Independence Hall to Penn&#x27;s Landing. The Manhattan site was ultimately chosen over Philadelphia after John D. Rockefeller Jr., offered to donate $8.5 million to purchase the land along the East River. Robert Moses and Rockefeller Sr. convinced Nelson Rockefeller to buy the land after the Rockefellers&#x27; Kykuit estate in Mount Pleasant, New York, was deemed too isolated from Manhattan.

====Previous temporary sites====
In 1945–46, London hosted the first meeting of the General Assembly in Methodist Central Hall, and the Security Council in Church House. The third and sixth General Assembly sessions, in 1948 and 1951, met in the Palais de Chaillot in Paris. Prior to the completion of the current headquarters, the UN used part of a Sperry Gyroscope Company factory in Lake Success, New York, for most of its operations, including the Security Council, between 1946 and 1952. The Security Council also held sessions on what was then the Bronx campus of Hunter College (now the site of Lehman College) from March to August 1946. Between 1946 and 1950, the General Assembly met at the New York City Building in Flushing Meadows–Corona Park, which had been built for the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair and is now the site of the Queens Museum. The Long Island Rail Road reopened the former World&#x27;s Fair station as United Nations station.

===Construction===
Per an agreement with the city, the buildings met some but not all local fire safety and building codes. In April 1948, US President Harry S. Truman requested that Congress approve an interest-free loan of $65 million in order to fund construction. The US Congress authorized the loan on August 6, 1948, on the condition that the UN repay the loan in twelve monthly instalments between July 1951 and July 1952. Of the $65 million, $25 million was to be made available immediately from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. However, the full loan was initially withheld due to a case regarding UN employee Valentin A. Gubitchev and KGB spy Judith Coplon, who had been charged with espionage and were set to go on trial in March 1949. The House was loath to distribute the full $65 million because the government was concerned that the UN&#x27;s proposed headquarters would grant diplomatic immunity to the two individuals. The UN used the Reconstruction Finance Corp.&#x27;s $25 million as a stopgap measure. The resulting case circumscribed the immunity of UN employees. To save money, the UN considered retaining an existing building on the Manhattan site, which had been slated for demolition once the headquarters was completed. Until 1950, the UN refused to accept private donations for the headquarters&#x27; construction, citing a policy that prohibited them from accepting donations.

The groundbreaking ceremony for the initial buildings occurred on September 14, 1948. A bucket of earth was removed to mark the start of construction for the basement of the 39-story Secretariat Building. In October, Harrison requested that its 58 members and the 48 US states participate in designing the interiors of the building&#x27;s conference rooms. It was believed that if enough countries designed their own rooms, the UN would be able to reduce its own expenditures. The headquarters were originally supposed to be completed in 1951, with the first occupants moving into the Secretariat Building in 1950. However, in November, New York City&#x27;s construction coordinator Robert Moses reported that construction was two months behind schedule. By that time, 60% of the headquarters&#x27; site had been excavated. The same month, the United Nations General Assembly unanimously voted to formally thank the national, state, and city governments for their role in building the headquarters. A joint venture of the George A. Fuller Company, Turner Construction, the Walsh Construction Company, and the Slattery Contracting Company was selected in December 1948 to construct the Secretariat Building, as well as the foundations for the remaining buildings.

The formal $23.8 million contract for the Secretariat Building was awarded in January 1949. A prayer space for people of all religions was announced on April 18, 1949. Until then, the UN had avoided the subject of a prayer room, because it had been difficult, if not impossible, to create a prayer room that could accommodate the various religions. Two days after this announcement, workers erected the first steel beam for the Secretariat Building, to little official fanfare. The consortium working on the Secretariat Building announced that 13,000 tons of steel would eventually be used in the building and that the steelwork would consist of a strong wind bracing system because the structure was so narrow. The flag of the United Nations was raised above the first beam as a demonstration for the many spectators who witnessed the first beam&#x27;s erection. The Secretariat Building was to be completed no later than January 1, 1951, and if the consortium of Fuller, Turner, Slattery, and Walsh exceeded that deadline, they had to pay a minimum penalty of $2,500 per day to the UN. To reduce construction costs, the complex&#x27;s planners downsized the Secretariat Building from 42 stories to 39 stories.

The cornerstone of the headquarters was originally supposed to be laid on April 10, 1949. However, in March of that year, Secretary-General Trygve Lie delayed the ceremony after learning that Truman would not be present to officiate the cornerstone laying. Seven months later, on October 11, Truman accepted an invitation to attend a cornerstone-laying ceremony, which was planned to occur on October 24. At the ceremony, New York Governor Thomas E. Dewey laid the headquarters&#x27; cornerstone.

In June 1949, UN officials wrote a letter to the American Bridge Company in which they expressed intent to buy 10,000 to 11,000 tons of steel. This steel would be used to build the rest of the complex, as well as a deck over FDR Drive on the headquarters&#x27; eastern side. To fit in with the accelerated schedule of construction, the steel would have to be delivered by September. The project also included a four-lane, $2.28 million vehicular tunnel under First Avenue so that traffic could bypass the headquarters when the UN was in session. The tunnel started construction on August 1, 1949. The tunnel involved two years of planning due to its complexity. Property inside Tudor City, just west of the headquarters, was also acquired so that two streets near the UN headquarters could be widened. The expanded streets were expected to speed up construction. In October 1949, contracts were awarded for the construction of two vehicular ramps over the FDR Drive: one to the north of the UN headquarters, and one to the south. Another contract to redevelop 42nd Street, a major corridor leading to the UN headquarters, was awarded in December of that year.

The Secretariat Building was ceremonially topped out in October 1949 after its steel framework had been completed. The UN flag was hoisted atop the roof of the newly completed steel frame in celebration of this event. The installation of the Secretariat Building&#x27;s interior furnishings proceeded quickly so that the building could be open in January 1951. In February 1950, the UN invited companies from 37 countries to bid on $2 million worth of furniture for the Secretariat Building. A month later, the UN announced that it would also be accepting all donations from private citizens, entities, or organizations. This marked a reversal from their previous policy of rejecting all donations. A $1.7 million steel contract on the United Nations General Assembly Building, the last structure to be built, was awarded in April 1950. At the time, the building was not expected to be complete until 1952 due to a steelworkers&#x27; strike, which had delayed the production of steel. The first pieces of the platform over the FDR Drive was lifted into place the same month. In June 1950, Norway proposed that it decorate and outfit the complex&#x27;s Security Council chamber, and the UN unofficially accepted the Norwegian offer.

In December 1949, Robert Moses proposed placing a playground inside the UN headquarters, but this plan was initially rejected. The UN subsequently reversed its position in April 1951, and Lie agreed to build a playground at the northeast corner of the headquarters site. However, the UN did reject an unusual &quot;model playground&quot; proposal for that site, instead choosing to construct a play area similar to others found around New York City. The playground opened in April 1953.

===Opening===
The first 450 UN employees started working at the Secretariat Building on August 22, 1950. The United Nations officially moved into the Secretariat Building on January 8, 1951, by which time 3,300 employees occupied the building. At the time, much of the Secretariat Building was still unfinished, and the bulk of the UN&#x27;s operations still remained at Lake Success. A centralized phone-communications system was built to facilitate communications within the complex. The UN had completely moved out of its Lake Success headquarters by May. The construction of the General Assembly Building was delayed due to a shortage of limestone for the building, which in turn resulted from a heavy snow at the British limestone quarries that were supplying the building&#x27;s Portland limestone. The erection of the building&#x27;s framework began in February 1952. The Manhattan headquarters was declared complete on October 10, 1952. The cost of construction was reported to be on budget at $65 million. In 1953, twenty-one nations donated furnishings or offered to decorate the UN headquarters.

A new library building for the UN headquarters was proposed in 1952. The existing UN library, a 6-story structure formerly owned by the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA), was too small. The NYCHA building could only hold 170,000 books, whereas the UN wanted to host at least 350,000 to 400,000 books in its library. The new facility was slated to cost $3 million. By 1955, the collection was housed in the Secretariat Building and held 250,000 volumes in &quot;every language of the world&quot;, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The Dag Hammarskjöld Library Building, designed by Harrison and Abramovitz, was officially dedicated in November 1961.

=== Early years ===
The gardens at the United Nations headquarters were originally closed to the public, but were made publicly accessible in 1958. By 1962, the United Nations&#x27; operations had grown so much that the headquarters could not house all of the organization&#x27;s operations. As a result, the UN announced its intention to rent office space nearby. The Children&#x27;s Fund (UNICEF) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) moved to leased office space three years later. The East River-Turtle Bay Fund, a civic group, proposed that the United Nations purchase a tract located to the south of the headquarters, on the site of the Robert Moses Playground and the Queens–Midtown Tunnel ventilation building between 41st and 42nd Streets. The northern portion of the United Nations site remained largely undeveloped through the mid-1960s; a proposed skyscraper by Wallace K. Harrison was scrapped after the UN ran out of money and had to borrow $65 million from the United States government.

A radical proposal for redeveloping the area around the UN headquarters was proposed in 1968. It entailed closing First Avenue between 43rd and 45th Streets; constructing a new visitor center with two 44-story towers between 43rd and 45th Streets; and connecting the new visitor center with the existing headquarters via a public park. This plan was presented to the New York City government in 1969, but was ultimately not acted upon. The main headquarters was expanded slightly from 1978 to 1981, including the construction of a new cafeteria and a slight expansion of the Conference Building.

The UN staff continued to grow, and by 1969, the organization had 3,500 staff working in the New York headquarters. The UN rented additional space at 485 Lexington Avenue and in the Chrysler East complex, located three blocks west of the headquarters. It also announced its intention to build a new storage building between 41st and 42nd Streets. None of these properties would receive the extraterritorial status conferred on the original headquarters. One United Nations Plaza, an office building on 44th Street just outside the UN complex, was completed in 1975 with the United Nations Plaza Hotel on its upper stories. Another office tower outside the headquarters proper, Two United Nations Plaza, was completed in 1983. The new buildings were barely sufficient to accommodate the UN&#x27;s demand for office space; the organization itself had expanded to 140 members by the 1970s.

===Refurbishment===

Due to funding shortfalls in the 1980s, the UN diverted funding from its headquarters&#x27; maintenance fund to peacekeeping missions and other activities. Because the headquarters was extraterritorial territory, they were exempt from various building regulations. By 1998, the buildings had become technologically dated, and UN officials considered renovating the headquarters. The mechanical systems were so outdated that the UN had to manufacture its own replacement parts. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;if the United Nations had to abide by city building regulations [...] it might well be shuttered&quot;. The UN commissioned a report from engineering firm Ove Arup &amp; Partners, which published its findings in 2000. Ove Arup recommended renovating the UN headquarters over a six-year period, as well as expanding the Secretariat Building, but the UN could not secure funding for the project at the time.

In 2002, Secretary General Kofi Annan proposed replacing the nearby Robert Moses Playground with a new tower, relocating the Secretariat&#x27;s offices there temporarily, and renovating the Secretariat Building itself. The UN selected Fumihiko Maki to design a building on the Moses site, but the New York State Legislature refused to pass legislation in 2005 that would have allowed these plans to proceed. Alternative sites were considered as temporary holding locations during renovations. In 2005, officials explored the possibility of establishing a new temporary site at the old Lake Success location. Brooklyn was also suggested as a temporary site. Another alternative for a temporary headquarters or a new permanent facility was the World Trade Center site. Once again, these plans met resistance both within the UN and from the United States and New York governments and were abandoned.

The UN then decided to renovate its existing structures over a seven-year period for US$1.6 billion. Louis Frederick Reuter IV originally designed the renovation, but he resigned in 2006 following various disputes between UN and US officials. Michael Adlerstein was hired as the new project architect. Engineering firm Skanska was hired to renovate the Secretariat, Conference, and General Assembly buildings in July 2007. The renovations, which were the first since the complex opened in 1950, were expected to take about 7 years to complete. When completed the complex is also expected to be more energy efficient and have improved security. A temporary $140 million &quot;North Lawn Building&quot; was built to house the United Nations&#x27; &quot;critical operations&quot; while renovations proceeded. Work began on May 5, 2008, but the project was delayed for a while. By 2009 the cost of the work had risen from $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion with some estimates saying it would take up to $3 billion.

Officials hoped the renovated buildings would achieve a LEED Silver rating. Despite some delays and rises in construction costs, renovation on the entire UN headquarters progressed rapidly. By 2012, the installation of the new glass facade of the Secretariat Building was completed, and the UN staff moved into the newly renovated building in July 2012. By September 2015, the renovations were nearly complete but the cost had risen to $2.15 billion. Demolition of the North Lawn Building began in January 2016. The building was replaced with an open plaza, and most of its materials were to be recycled.

In 2019, due to a budget shortfall, the UN cut back some services at its headquarters, such as heating and air-conditioning. On March 10, 2020, the UN closed to the general public due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, the UN furloughed some of its headquarters&#x27; staff.

==International character==
The UN identifies Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish as its six official languages. Delegates speaking in any of these languages will have their words simultaneously interpreted into all of the others, and attendees are provided with headphones through which they can hear the interpretations. A delegate is allowed to make a statement in a non-official language, but must provide either an interpreter or a written copy of their remarks translated into an official language. Interpreters typically take turns, working for 30 minutes at a time.

===Extraterritoriality and security===

The site of the UN headquarters has extraterritoriality status. This affects some law enforcement where UN rules override the laws of New York City, but it does not give immunity to those who commit crimes there. In addition, the United Nations headquarters remains under the jurisdiction and laws of the United States, although a few members of the UN staff have diplomatic immunity and so cannot be prosecuted by local courts unless the immunity is waived by the Secretary-General. In 2005, Secretary-General Kofi Annan waived the immunity of Benon Sevan, Aleksandr Yakovlev, and Vladimir Kuznetsov in relation to the Oil-for-Food Programme, and all were charged in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Benon Sevan later fled the United States to Cyprus, while Aleksandr Yakovlev and Vladimir Kuznetsov decided to stand trial.

United Nations Security officers are generally responsible for security within the UN Headquarters. They are equipped with weapons and handcuffs and are sometimes mistaken for New York City Police Department (NYPD) officers due to the agencies&#x27; similar uniforms. The NYPD&#x27;s 17th Precinct patrols the area around and near the complex, but may only formally enter the actual UN headquarters at the request of the Secretary-General.

===Currency and postage===

The currency in use at the United Nations headquarters&#x27; businesses is the US dollar. The UN&#x27;s stamps are issued in denominations of the US dollar.

The complex has a street address of United Nations headquarters, New York, NY, 10017, United States. For security reasons, all mail sent to this address is sterilized, so items that may be degraded can be sent by courier. The United Nations Postal Administration issues stamps, which must be used on stamped mail sent from the building.

===Radio===

For award purposes, amateur radio operators consider the UN headquarters a separate &quot;entity&quot; under some award programs such as DXCC. For communications, UN organizations have their own internationally recognized ITU prefix, 4U. However, only contacts made with the UN Headquarters in New York, and the ITU count as separate entities. Other UN organizations such as the World Bank count for the state or country they are located in. The UN Staff Recreation Council operates amateur radio station 4U1UN.

==Structures==

The complex includes a number of major buildings. While the Secretariat Building is most predominantly featured in depictions of the headquarters, it also includes the domed General Assembly Building, the Dag Hammarskjöld Library, as well as the Conference and Visitors Center, which is situated between the General Assembly and Secretariat buildings, and can be seen only from the FDR Drive or the East River. Just inside the perimeter fence of the complex stands a line of flagpoles where the flags of all 193 UN member states, 2 observer states, plus the UN flag, are flown in English alphabetical order.

===General Assembly Building===
The General Assembly Building, housing the United Nations General Assembly, holds the General Assembly Hall, which has a seating capacity of 1,800. At long by wide, it is the largest room in the complex. The Hall has two murals by the French artist Fernand Léger. At the front of the chamber is the rostrum containing the green marble desk for the President of the General Assembly, Secretary-General and Under-Secretary-General for General Assembly Affairs and Conference Services, as well as a matching lectern for speakers. Behind the rostrum is the UN emblem on a gold background. The rostrum is flanked by a paneled semi-circular wall, which contains seating booths for guests. The ceiling of the hall is high and surmounted by a shallow dome ringed by recessed light fixtures. Each of the 192 delegations has six seats in the hall with three at a desk and three alternate seats behind them.

The building contains two lobbies: a delegates&#x27; lobby to the south and a public lobby to the north. On the second floor, directly behind the General Assembly Hall, is the GA 200 room, which contains offices for the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the President of the United Nations General Assembly. There is a delegates&#x27; lounge on the south side of the second floor, which also connects with the Conference Building along the East River. There is also a meditation room next to the north lobby, as well as a large conference room and several smaller conference rooms in the basement beneath the General Assembly Hall. The basement also has television and radio studios, a sound-recording studio, and a master control room for the United Nations headquarters&#x27; communication system.

===Conference Building===

The Conference Building faces the East River between the General Assembly Building and the Secretariat, being directly east of both structures. It is five stories high and measures long. The exteriors were designed by the United Nations Board of Design, while the interiors were designed by Abel Sorenson. The second and third stories contain the chambers of the Economic and Social (ECOSOC), Trusteeship, and Security councils, all of which were designed by Scandinavian architects. All three chambers have technical equipment on the north and south walls, public seating to the west, delegates&#x27; seats in the center, and glass walls to the east. They each measure deep, wide, and long. Below are three large and six small conference rooms. Above the three conference chambers, near the rooftop of the building, were dining areas. There was also a lounge for delegates near the building&#x27;s north end.

Swedish architect Sven Markelius designed the Economic and Social Council chamber, which contained wooden screens on the curved north and south walls, as well as an exposed ceiling. Markelius painted the ceiling in various hues of black, gray, and off-white. The space was redesigned in 1974 when ECOSOC was expanded from 27 to 54 members. The space could seat 336 members of the public and 40 journalists. The ECOSOC chamber was renovated again in 1995 and 2013, and a set of curtains named &quot;Dialogos&quot; by Ann Edholm was installed during the 2013 renovation.

Danish architect Finn Juhl designed the Trusteeship Council chamber, which includes wood screens spanning the north and south walls, as well as baffles and rods on the ceiling. A model of a white plane was originally suspended from the ceiling above the deliberation table. The space could seat 198 members of the public and 66 journalists. Danish artist Henrik Starcke designed a teak sculpture of a woman on one wall. The chamber contains two paintings: &quot;Codice del Fuego&quot; (Fire Codex) on the left wall, a gift from Ecuador, and &quot;Gandzelo&quot; (Sacred Tree) on the right wall, a gift from Mozambique.

Norwegian architect Arnstein Arneberg was responsible for the Security Council chamber. The lowest parts of the walls contained dadoes in three shades of gray marble. The walls were upholstered in royal blue, with golden tapestries; these tapestries represent hope, faith, and charity. The space could seat 232 members of the public and 100 journalists, and there are also seats for delegates whose countries are not yet members of the Security Council. The artwork in the Security Council chamber includes a mural by Norwegian artist Per Krohg on the east wall. The oil canvas mural depicts a phoenix rising from its ashes. On one wall is a door leading to the office of the president of the Security Council. The Security Council chamber also leads to the Consultation Room, a private conference room for members of the council, and the Caucus Room, where members could host small meetings. A quiet room for delegates, designed by Günter Fruhtrunk and Paolo Nestler and donated by the Federal Republic of Germany, contains diagonal paneling.

===Secretariat Building===

The 39-story Secretariat Building was completed in 1950. It houses offices for the Secretary-General, the Under-Secretary-General for Legal Affairs and United Nations Legal Counsel, the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs and Office of Disarmament Affairs, and the Department for General Assembly and Conference Management (DGACM).

The wider western and eastern elevations of the facade consist of glass curtain walls set within a metal grid. The narrower northern and southern elevations are made of masonry clad with Vermont marble. The Secretariat Building was constructed with of space and, at the time of its completion, could accommodate 4,000 workers. Floors 6, 16, and 28 are used as mechanical floors, and floor 39 serves as a mechanical penthouse, accessible only by stairs. Under the building is a three-story garage for UN employees, with 1,500 parking spaces. When the building was constructed, the lowest stories were to contain broadcasting studios, press offices, staff rooms, and other functions. The offices were placed on the upper floors.

===Dag Hammarskjöld Library===
The library was founded with the United Nations in 1946. It was originally called the United Nations Library, later the United Nations International Library. In the late 1950s the Ford Foundation gave a grant to the United Nations for the construction of a new library building; Dag Hammarskjöld was also instrumental in securing the funding for the new building. The Dag Hammarskjöld Library was dedicated and renamed on November 16, 1961. The building was a gift from the Ford Foundation and is located next to the Secretariat at the southwest corner of the headquarters campus. The library holds 400,000 books, 9,800 newspapers and periodical titles, 80,000 maps, and the Woodrow Wilson Collection containing 8,600 volumes of League of Nations documents and 6,500 related books and pamphlets. The library&#x27;s Economic and Social Affairs Collection is housed in the DC-2 building.

===Other buildings===

While outside of the complex, the headquarters also includes two large office buildings that serve as offices for the agencies and programmes of the organization. These buildings, known as DC-1 and DC-2, are located at One and Two United Nations Plaza respectively. DC1 was built in 1976. There is also an identification office at the corner of 46th Street, inside a former bank branch, where pre-accredited diplomats, reporters, and others receive their grounds passes. UNICEF House (3 UN Plaza) and the UNITAR Building (807 UN Plaza) are also part of headquarters. In addition, the Church Center for the United Nations (777 UN Plaza) is a private building owned by the United Methodist Church as an interfaith space housing the offices of several non-governmental organizations. The Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) is located at 380 Madison Avenue.

===Proposed tower===
In October 2011, city and state officials announced an agreement in which the UN would be allowed to build a long-sought new office tower just south of the existing campus on the current Robert Moses Playground, which would be relocated. In exchange, the United Nations would allow the construction of an esplanade along the East River that would complete the East River Greenway, a waterfront pedestrian and bicycle pathway. While host nation authorities have agreed to the provisions of the plan, it needs the approval of the United Nations in order to be implemented. The plan is similar in concept to an earlier proposal that had been announced in 2000 but did not move forward.

==Art collection==


The complex contains gardens, which were originally private gardens before being opened to the public in 1958. The complex is notable for its gardens and outdoor sculptures. Iconic sculptures include the &quot;Knotted Gun&quot;, called &quot;Non-Violence&quot;, a statue of a Colt Python revolver with its barrel tied in a knot, which was a gift from the Luxembourg government and &quot;Let Us Beat Swords into Plowshares&quot;, a gift from the Soviet Union. The latter sculpture is the only appearance of the &quot;swords into plowshares&quot; quotation, from Isaiah 2:4, within the complex. Contrary to popular belief, the quotation is not carved on any UN building. Rather, it is carved on the &quot;Isaiah Wall&quot; of Ralph Bunche Park across First Avenue. A piece of the Berlin Wall also stands in the UN garden.

Other prominent artworks on the grounds include &quot;Peace&quot;, a Marc Chagall stained glass window memorializing the death of Dag Hammarskjöld; the Japanese Peace Bell which is rung on the vernal equinox and the opening of each General Assembly session; a Chinese ivory carving made in 1974, before the ivory trade was largely banned in 1989; and a Venetian mosaic depicting Norman Rockwell&#x27;s painting &quot;The Golden Rule&quot;. A full-size tapestry copy of Pablo Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Guernica&quot;, by Jacqueline de la Baume Dürrbach, is on the wall of the United Nations building at the entrance to the Security Council room. In 1952, two Fernand Léger murals were installed in the General Assembly Hall. One is said to resemble cartoon character Bugs Bunny, while US President Harry S. Truman dubbed the other work &quot;Scrambled Eggs&quot;.

Two large murals by Brazilian artist Cândido Portinari, entitled &quot;Guerra e Paz&quot; (&quot;War&quot; and &quot;Peace&quot;) are located at the delegates hall. The works are a gift from the Brazilian government and Portinari intended to execute them in the United States. However, he was denied a visa due to his communist convictions and decided to paint them in Rio de Janeiro. They were later assembled in the headquarters. After their completion in 1957, Portinari, who was already ill when he started the masterpiece, succumbed to lead poisoning from the pigments his doctors advised him to abandon.

==Relocation proposals==
Due to the significance of the organization, proposals to relocate its headquarters have occasionally been made. Complainants about its current location include diplomats who find it difficult to obtain visas from the United States and local residents complaining of inconveniences whenever the surrounding roads are closed due to visiting dignitaries, as well as the high costs to the city. A US telephone survey in 2001 found that 67% of respondents favored moving the United Nations headquarters out of the country. Countries critical of the US, such as Iran and Russia, are especially vocal in questioning the current location of the United Nations, arguing that the United States government could manipulate the work of the General Assembly through selective access to politicians from other countries, with the aim of having an advantage over rival countries. In the wake of the Snowden global surveillance disclosures, the subject of the relocation of the UN headquarters was again discussed, this time for security reasons.

Among the cities that have been proposed to house the headquarters of the United Nations are Saint Petersburg, Montreal, Dubai, Jerusalem, and Nairobi.

Critics of relocation say that the idea would be expensive and would also involve the withdrawal of the United States from the organization, and with it much of the agency&#x27;s funding. They also state that the proposals have never gone from being mere declarations.

==Public gatherings==
Large scale protests, demonstrations, and other gatherings directly on First Avenue are rare. Some gatherings have taken place in Ralph Bunche Park, but it is too small to accommodate large demonstrations. The closest location where the New York City Police Department usually allows demonstrators is Dag Hammarskjöld Plaza at 47th Street and First Avenue.

Besides gatherings solely for diplomats and academics, there are a few organizations that regularly hold events at the UN. The United Nations Association of the United States of America (UNA-USA), a non-governmental organization, holds an annual &quot;member&#x27;s day&quot; event in one of the conference rooms. Model United Nations conferences sponsored by UNA-USA, the National Collegiate Conference Association (NCCA/NMUN), and the International Model UN Association (IMUNA/NHSMUN) hold part of their sessions in the General Assembly chamber. Seton Hall University&#x27;s Whitehead School of Diplomacy hosts its UN summer study program at the headquarters as well.

==In popular culture==


The United Nations headquarters is often featured in movies and other pop culture. Several films have been set at the headquarters, including &quot;The Glass Wall&quot; (1953) and &quot;North by Northwest&quot; (1959). The UN did not give producers permission to film at its headquarters until 2005, when &quot;The Interpreter&quot; was filmed there. According to architect Aaron Betsky, the United Nations headquarters has often been used to stand for &quot;freedom, justice, and solutions to specific local problems through a grid-like, mirror-like deliberative process&quot;. Due to the headquarters&#x27; symbolism, several works of fiction have depicted the building under threat, including the films &quot;The Pink Panther Strikes Again&quot; (1976), &quot;Superman IV: The Quest for Peace&quot; (1987), and &quot;The Peacemaker&quot; (1997).

<text>Harrow School () is a public school (English boarding school for boys) in Harrow on the Hill, Greater London, England. The school was founded in 1572 by John Lyon, a local landowner and farmer, under a royal charter of Queen Elizabeth I.

The school has an enrolment of about 820 boys, all of whom board full-time, in twelve boarding houses. It was one of the seven public schools selected for reform in the Public Schools Act of 1868. Harrow&#x27;s uniform includes morning suits, straw boater hats, top hats and canes.

Its list of distinguished alumni includes seven former British prime ministers: Aberdeen, Perceval, Goderich, Peel, Palmerston, Baldwin and Churchill, as well as the former Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru; numerous former and current members of both Houses of the UK Parliament, several members of various royal families, three Nobel Prize winners, twenty Victoria Cross holders, and many prominent figures in the arts and sciences.

==History==
=== The Foundation ===
The school was founded in February 1572 under a royal charter granted by Queen Elizabeth I to John Lyon, a wealthy local farmer. The school&#x27;s formal name is still &#x27;The Free Grammar School of John Lyon within the town of Harrow-on-the-Hill&#x27;. The charter described this as a re-endowment, and there is some evidence of a grammar school at Harrow in the mid-16th century, but its location and connection with Lyon&#x27;s foundation are unclear. Evidence for earlier schools, possibly connected with the chantry of St Mary (established in 1324), is weak. In the original charter six governors were named, including two members of the Gerard family of Flambards, and two members of the Page family of Wembley and Sudbury Court.

The founder John Lyon died in 1592, bequeathing his estate to two beneficiaries: the school and the maintenance of two roads, the Harrow Road and the Edgware Road, both going to London, 10 miles (16 km) away. The Road Trust received by far the greater share, the school&#x27;s share providing just for the salary of The School Master and some minor provisions. This situation, reasonable at the time because of the need to transport merchandise to market, continued until 1991 when the considerable assets of the Road Trust were reassigned to John Lyon&#x27;s Charity, a charity to provide educational benefits for the inhabitants of the boroughs through which the roads pass. It was only after the death of Lyon&#x27;s wife in 1608 that the construction of the first school building began. Known as the Old Schools, it was completed in 1615.

John Lyon&#x27;s school was founded to provide free education for 30 (later extended to 40) poor boys of the parish. However, the School Master was permitted to accept &quot;foreigners&quot; (boys from outside the parish) from whom he received fees. It was the need for foreigners to find accommodation that led to the concept of boarding. As in all schools of the time, education was based on the languages and culture of the ancient civilisations of Rome and Greece.

As the reputation of the school grew through the 19th century, the number of foreigners increased, but the local families became increasingly reluctant to impose on their children a classical education and the number of free scholars declined. In 1825 there were 17 free scholars and 219 foreigners. In 1876 the Lower School of John Lyon was founded under the authority of the Governors of Harrow School to provide a modern education for local boys. It is now known as The John Lyon School and is a prominent independent school; it remains part of the Harrow School Foundation.

=== Buildings and historic listings===
The Old Schools remains largely the building of 1615, although it was extended and re-designed by Charles Robert Cockerell in 1818. It is a Grade I listed building.

The majority of the school&#x27;s boarding houses were constructed in Victorian times, when the number of boys increased dramatically. The Speech Room by William Burges (1877), the chapel (1855) and Vaughan Library (1863), both by George Gilbert Scott, and the War Memorial building (1926), designed by Herbert Baker to mark the loss of former pupils in the First World War, are all Grade II* listed buildings. A total of 27 school buildings are Grade II listed, including the Headmaster&#x27;s House (1843) by Decimus Burton; the Museum Schools [Butler Museum] (1886) by Basil Champneys; and the Music Schools (1890) by Edward Prior.

==School traditions==

=== Uniform ===

Everyday dress for boys at Harrow consists of a dark blue jacket known as a &quot;bluer&quot; with light grey trousers known as &quot;greyers&quot;. With these are worn a white shirt, black tie, black shoes and an optional blue jumper. Boys also wear a Harrow hat, a straw hat with a dark blue band similar to a boater, but shallower in crown and broader in brim. The School blue-and-white woollen scarf and dark blue woollen overcoat may be worn in cold weather. Variations include boys who are monitors (prefects) who are allowed to wear a jumper of their choice of colour, and members of certain societies who may earn the right to replace the standard school tie with one of a variety of scarves, cravats, neck and bow ties of their society.

Sunday dress, which is worn every Sunday up to lunch and on special occasions such as Speech Day and songs, consists of a black tailcoat, a black single-breasted waistcoat and striped trousers, worn with a white shirt and black tie. Boys with sports colours may wear a grey double-breasted waistcoat; members of the Guild (a society for boys who have achieved distinction in art, music or drama) may wear maroon double-breasted waistcoats with maroon bow ties; members of the Philathletic Club (a society for boys with achievements in sport) may wear black bow ties alongside grey double-breasted waistcoats. School monitors (prefects) may wear black double-breasted waistcoats and a top hat, and carry canes.

=== School houses ===

Harrow School divides its pupils, who are all boarders, into twelve Houses, each of about seventy boys, with a thirteenth house, Gayton, used as an overflow. Each House has its own facilities, customs and traditions, and each competes in sporting events against the others. Until the 1950s there existed what was known as &#x27;small houses&#x27; where only 5–10 boys stayed at one time while they waited for a space in a &quot;large house&quot; to become available (hence the use of the term large house in this article). A twelfth large house, Lyon&#x27;s, was built in 2010. House Masters, Assistant House Masters and their families live in the boarding Houses and are assisted by House Tutors appointed from the teaching staff. The House Master oversees the welfare of every boy in his care; for parents, he is the main point of contact with the School. Each House has a resident matron and sick room. The matrons are supported by the School&#x27;s Medical Centre where trained nursing staff offer round-the-clock care. The medical centre is under the direct supervision of the school doctor who is available on the Hill every day for consultation. There are no dormitories: a boy shares his room for the first three to six terms and thereafter has a room to himself.

=== Harrow Songs ===
The School has a book of songs, of which the best known is &quot;Forty Years On&quot;. In the 19th century, most schools had a school song, usually in Latin, which they sang at the beginning and end of term. Harrow had a master, Edward Bowen, who was a poet and a music teacher, and John Farmer, who was a composer. Between 1870 and 1885, these two wrote a number of songs about school life. The inspiring, wistful, amusing and thought-provoking words and the attractive tunes, made the songs very popular. Successors to Bowen and Farmer have added to the collection. The songs are sung in House and School concerts several times a term. Winston Churchill was a great lover of Harrow songs and when he returned for a concert as Prime Minister in 1940, it was the first of many annual visits. Churchill Songs is still celebrated in Speech Room each year, and every five years at the Royal Albert Hall.

===Sport===

The sport squash (originally called &#x27;Squasher&#x27;) was invented in Harrow out of the game rackets around 1830. It spread to other schools, eventually becoming an international sport.

An annual cricket match has taken place between Harrow and Eton College at Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground since 1805. It is considered to be the longest-running cricket fixture in the world and is the oldest fixture at Lord&#x27;s (see: Eton v Harrow). Eton won the match in 2013, and Harrow in 2014 and 2015.

Harrow has its own unique style of football called Harrow Football. Currently, the school offers around 30 sports activities for students such as archery, badminton, hockey and judo.

===Fagging===
As in most boarding schools, for many years there was a system of &#x27;fagging&#x27; whereby younger boys carried out duties for the seniors. At Harrow this was phased out in the 1970s and completely banned by 1990. In his detailed history of the school, Christopher Tyerman recorded that in 1796 fagging was compulsory for boys up to the fourth form, and that 50 out of 139 boys were then fags. In 1928, Harrow Master C. H. P. Mayo said of fagging: &quot;Those who hope to rule must first learn to obey... to learn to obey as a fag is part of the routine that is the essence of the English Public School system... the wonder of other countries&quot;.

==Media coverage==
In 2005, the school was one of fifty of the country&#x27;s leading independent schools which were found guilty of running an illegal price-fixing cartel, exposed by &quot;The Times&quot;, which had allowed them to drive up fees for thousands of parents, although the schools said that they had not realised that the change to the law (which had happened only a few months earlier) about the sharing of information had subsequently made it an offence. Each school was required to pay a nominal penalty of £10,000 and all agreed to make ex-gratia payments totalling £3,000,000 into a trust designed to benefit pupils who attended the schools during the period in respect of which fee information was shared.

Harrow was featured in a Sky 1 documentary series entitled &quot;&quot; in 2013. In February 2016, the actor Laurence Fox claimed Harrow threatened legal action to prevent him discussing the racism, homophobia and bullying he said he encountered as a pupil at the school.

==Old Harrovians==
Harrow alumni are known as Old Harrovians, among seven British prime ministers were Winston Churchill, Stanley Baldwin and Robert Peel, and the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru. Twenty Old Harrovians have been awarded the Victoria Cross and one the George Cross.

Five monarchs have attended the school: King Hussein of Jordan; both Kings of Iraq, Ghazi I and his son Faisal II; the current Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani; and Ali bin Hamud of Zanzibar.

Harrow has educated several Nobel laureates: John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh, who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1904; John Galsworthy, winner of the 1932 Nobel Prize in Literature; and Winston Churchill, who also received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1953.

Other alumni include writers Lord Byron, Anthony Trollope, Sir Terence Rattigan, Simon Sebag-Montefiore, and Richard Curtis, the Gerald Grosvenor, 6th Duke of Westminster and prominent reformist Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury, military commanders such as Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis and Sir Peter de la Billiere, and business people (including DeBeers chairman Nicky Oppenheimer, Pret a Manger founder Julian Metcalfe) and the big game hunter and artist General Douglas Hamilton, as well as Island Records founder Chris Blackwell. In sports, the school produced the first two Wimbledon champions (Spencer Gore and Frank Hadow) as well as FA Cup founder C. W. Alcock and current England rugby international players Billy Vunipola, Maro Itoje and Henry Arundell. Alumni in the arts and media industry include actors Edward Fox, Benedict Cumberbatch and Cary Elwes, photographer Nikolai von Bismarck, singers David Dundas and James Blunt, pianist James Rhodes, horse racing pundit John McCririck, and Mark Thatcher, son of Margaret Thatcher.

Fictional characters who have attended Harrow include Brett Sinclair of the TV series &quot;The Persuaders!&quot;, Withnail and Uncle Monty from the film &quot;Withnail &amp; I&quot;, Herbert Pocket from Charles Dickens&#x27;s novel, &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, and Geoffrey Charles Poldark from &quot;Poldark&quot;.

<text>Eugene Onegin, A Novel in Verse (, pre-reform Russian: Евгеній Онѣгинъ, романъ въ стихахъ, ) is a novel in verse written by Alexander Pushkin. &quot;Onegin&quot; is considered a classic of Russian literature, and its eponymous protagonist has served as the model for a number of Russian literary heroes (so-called &quot;superfluous men&quot;). It was published in serial form between 1825 and 1832. The first complete edition was published in 1833, and the currently accepted version is based on the 1837 publication.

Almost the entire work is made up of 389 fourteen-line stanzas (5,446 lines in all) of iambic tetrameter with the unusual rhyme scheme , where the uppercase letters represent feminine rhymes while the lowercase letters represent masculine rhymes. 

The story is told by a narrator (a lightly fictionalized version of Pushkin&#x27;s public image), whose tone is educated, worldly, and intimate. The narrator digresses at times, usually to expand on aspects of this social and intellectual world. This narrative style allows for a development of the characters and emphasizes the drama of the plot despite its relative simplicity. The book is admired for the artfulness of its verse narrative as well as for its exploration of life, death, love, ennui, convention, and passion.
==Main characters==

*Eugene Onegin: A dandy from Saint Petersburg, about 26. An arrogant, selfish, and world-weary cynic.
*Vladimir Lensky: A young poet, about 18. A very romantic and naïve dreamer.
*Tatyana Larina: A shy and quiet, but passionate, landowner&#x27;s daughter. Pushkin referred to her as aged 17 in a letter to Pyotr Vyazemsky.
*Olga Larina: Tatyana&#x27;s younger sister.

==Plot==
In the 1820s, Eugene Onegin is a bored St. Petersburg dandy, whose life consists of balls, concerts, parties, and nothing more. Upon the death of a wealthy uncle, he inherits a substantial fortune and a landed estate. When he moves to the country, he strikes up a friendship with his neighbor, a starry-eyed young poet named Vladimir Lensky. Lensky takes Onegin to dine with the family of his fiancée, the sociable but rather thoughtless Olga Larina. At this meeting, he also catches a glimpse of Olga&#x27;s sister Tatyana. A quiet, precocious romantic, and the exact opposite of Olga, Tatyana becomes intensely drawn to Onegin. Soon after, she bares her soul to Onegin in a letter professing her love. Contrary to her expectations, Onegin does not write back. When they meet in person, he rejects her advances politely but dismissively and condescendingly. This famous speech is often referred to as &quot;Onegin&#x27;s Sermon&quot;: he admits that the letter was touching, but says that he would quickly grow bored with marriage and can only offer Tatyana friendship; he coldly advises more emotional control in the future, lest another man take advantage of her innocence.

Later, Lensky mischievously invites Onegin to Tatyana&#x27;s name day celebration, promising a small gathering with just Tatyana, Olga, and their parents. When Onegin arrives, he finds instead a boisterous country ball, a rural parody of and contrast to the society balls of St. Petersburg of which he has grown tired. Onegin is irritated with the guests who gossip about him and Tatyana, and with Lensky for persuading him to come. He decides to avenge himself by dancing and flirting with Olga. Olga is insensitive to her fiancé and apparently attracted to Onegin. Earnest and inexperienced, Lensky is wounded to the core and challenges Onegin to fight a duel; Onegin reluctantly accepts, feeling compelled by social convention. During the duel, Onegin unwillingly kills Lensky. Afterwards, he quits his country estate, traveling abroad to deaden his feelings of remorse.

Tatyana visits Onegin&#x27;s mansion, where she looks through his books and his notes in the margins, and begins to question whether Onegin&#x27;s character is merely a collage of different literary heroes, and if there is, in fact, no &quot;real Onegin&quot;. Tatyana, still brokenhearted by the loss of Onegin, is persuaded by her parents to live with her aunt in Moscow to find a suitor.

Several years pass, and the scene shifts to St. Petersburg. Onegin has come to attend the most prominent balls and interact with the leaders of old Russian society. He sees the most beautiful woman, who captures the attention of all and is central to society&#x27;s whirl, and he realizes that it is the same Tatyana whose love he had once spurned. Now she is married to an aged prince (a general). Upon seeing Tatyana again, he becomes obsessed with winning her affection, despite her being married. His attempts are rebuffed. He writes her several letters, but receives no reply. Eventually, Onegin manages to see Tatyana and offers her the opportunity to finally elope after they have become reacquainted. She recalls the days when they might have been happy, but concludes that that time has passed. Onegin repeats his love for her. Faltering for a moment, she admits that she still loves him, but she will not allow him to ruin her and declares her determination to remain faithful to her husband. She leaves him regretting his bitter destiny.

As with many other 19th-century novels, &quot;Onegin&quot; was written and published serially, with parts of each chapter often appearing in magazines before the first printing of each chapter. Many changes, some small and some large, were made from the first appearance to the final edition during Pushkin&#x27;s lifetime. The following dates mostly come from Nabokov&#x27;s study of the photographs of Pushkin&#x27;s drafts that were available at the time, as well as other people&#x27;s work on the subject.

The first stanza of chapter 1 was started on May 9, 1823, and except for three stanzas (XXXIII, XVIII, and XIX), the chapter was finished on October 22. The remaining stanzas were completed and added to his notebook by the first week of October 1824. Chapter 1 was first published as a whole in a booklet on February 16, 1825, with a foreword which suggests that Pushkin had no clear plan on how (or even whether) he would continue the novel.

Chapter 2 was started on October 22, 1823 (the date when most of chapter 1 had been finished), and finished by December 8, except for stanzas XL and XXXV, which were added sometime over the next three months. The first separate edition of chapter 2 appeared on October 20, 1826.

Many events occurred which interrupted the writing of chapter 3. In January 1824, Pushkin stopped work on &quot;Onegin&quot; to work on &quot;The Gypsies&quot;. Except for XXV, stanzas I–XXXI were added on September 25, 1824. Nabokov guesses that Tatyana&#x27;s Letter was written in Odessa between February 8 and May 31, 1824. Pushkin incurred the displeasure of the Tsarist regime in Odessa and was restricted to his family estate Mikhaylovskoye in Pskov for two years. He left Odessa on July 21, 1824, and arrived on August 9. Writing resumed on September 5, and chapter 3 was finished (apart from stanza XXXVI) on October 2. The first separate publication of chapter 3 was on October 10, 1827.

Chapter 4 was started in October 1824. By the end of the year, Pushkin had written 23 stanzas and had reached XXVII by January 5, 1825, at which point he started writing stanzas for Onegin&#x27;s Journey and worked on other pieces of writing. He thought that it was finished on September 12, 1825, but later continued the process of rearranging, adding, and omitting stanzas until the first week of 1826. The first separate edition of chapter 4 appeared with chapter 5 in a publication produced between January 31 and February 2, 1828.

The writing of chapter 5 began on January 4, 1826, and 24 stanzas were complete before the start of his trip to petition the Tsar for his freedom. He left for this trip on September 4 and returned on November 2, 1826. He completed the rest of the chapter in the week November 15 to 22, 1826. The first separate edition of chapter 5 appeared with chapter 4 in a publication produced between January 31 and February 2, 1828.

When Nabokov carried out his study on the writing of &quot;Onegin&quot;, the manuscript of chapter 6 was lost, but it is known that Pushkin started chapter 6 before finishing chapter 5. Most of chapter 6 appears to have been written before the beginning of December 19, 1826, when Pushkin returned to Moscow after exile on his family estate. Many stanzas appeared to have been written between November 22 and 25, 1826. On March 23, 1828, the first separate edition of chapter 6 was published.

Pushkin started writing chapter 7 in March 1827, but aborted his original plan for the plot of the chapter and started on a different tack, completing the chapter on November 4, 1828. The first separate edition of chapter 7 was first printed on March 18, 1836.

Pushkin intended to write a chapter called &quot;Onegin&#x27;s Journey&quot;, which occurred between the events of chapters 7 and 8, and in fact was supposed to be the eighth chapter. Fragments of this incomplete chapter were published, in the same way that parts of each chapter had been published in magazines before each chapter was first published in a separate edition. When Pushkin completed chapter 8, he published it as the final chapter and included within its denouement the line &quot;nine cantos I have written&quot;, still intending to complete this missing chapter. When Pushkin finally decided to abandon this chapter, he removed parts of the ending to fit with the change.

Chapter 8 was begun before December 24, 1829, while Pushkin was in St. Petersburg. In August 1830, he went to Boldino (the Pushkin family estate) where, due to an epidemic of cholera, he was forced to stay for three months. During this time, he produced what Nabokov describes as an &quot;incredible number of masterpieces&quot; and finished copying out chapter 8 on September 25, 1830. During the summer of 1831, Pushkin revised and completed chapter 8 apart from &quot;Onegin&#x27;s Letter&quot;, which was completed on October 5, 1831. The first separate edition of chapter 8 appeared on January 10, 1832.

Pushkin wrote at least 18 stanzas of a never-completed tenth chapter. It contained many satires and even direct criticism on contemporary Russian rulers, including the Emperor himself. Afraid of being prosecuted for dissidence, Pushkin burnt most of the tenth chapter. Very little of it survived in Pushkin&#x27;s notebooks.

The first complete edition of the book was published in 1833. Slight corrections were made by Pushkin for the 1837 edition. The standard accepted text is based on the 1837 edition with a few changes due to the Tsar&#x27;s censorship restored.

==The duel==
In Pushkin&#x27;s time, the early 19th century, duels were very strictly regulated. A second&#x27;s primary duty was to prevent the duel from actually happening, and only when both combatants were unwilling to stand down were they to make sure that the duel proceeded according to formalised rules. A challenger&#x27;s second should therefore always ask the challenged party if he wants to apologise for the actions that have led to the challenge.
In &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;, Lensky&#x27;s second, Zaretsky, does not ask Onegin even once if he would like to apologise, and because Onegin is not allowed to apologise on his own initiative, the duel takes place, with fatal consequences. Zaretsky is described as &quot;classical and pedantic in duels&quot; (chapter 6, stanza XXVI), and this seems very out of character for a nobleman. In effect, he is enthusiastic at the prospect of a duel and callous about its deadly possibilities. Zaretsky&#x27;s first chance to end the duel is when he delivers Lensky&#x27;s written challenge to Onegin (chapter 6, stanza IX). Instead of asking Onegin if he would like to apologise, he apologises for having much to do at home and leaves as soon as Onegin (obligatorily) accepts the challenge.

On the day of the duel, Zaretsky gets several more chances to prevent the duel from happening. Because dueling was forbidden in the Russian Empire, duels were always held at dawn. Zaretsky urges Lensky to get ready shortly after 6 o&#x27;clock in the morning (chapter 6, stanza XXIII), while the sun only rises at 20 past 8, because he expects Onegin to be on time. However, Onegin oversleeps (chapter 6, stanza XXIV), and arrives on the scene more than an hour late. According to the dueling codex, if a duelist arrives more than 15 minutes late, he automatically forfeits the duel. Lensky and Zaretsky have been waiting all that time (chapter 6, stanza XXVI), even though it was Zaretsky&#x27;s duty to proclaim Lensky winner and take him home.

When Onegin finally arrives, Zaretsky is supposed to ask him a final time if he would like to apologise. Instead, Zaretsky is surprised by the apparent absence of Onegin&#x27;s second. Onegin, against all rules, appoints his servant Guillot as his second (chapter 6, stanza XXVII), a blatant insult for the nobleman Zaretsky. Zaretsky angrily accepts Guillot as Onegin&#x27;s second. By his actions, Zaretsky does not act as a nobleman should; in the end Onegin wins the duel.

Onegin himself, however, tried as he could to prevent the fatal outcome, and killed Lensky unwillingly and almost by accident. As the first shooter, he couldn&#x27;t deliberately miss the opponent: this was considered a serious insult and could create a formal reason to arrange another duel. Instead, he tried to minimize his chances of hitting Lensky by shooting without precise aim, from the maximum possible distance, not even trying to come closer and get a clear shot.

==Translations==
Translators of &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot; have all had to adopt a trade-off between precision and preservation of poetic imperatives. This particular challenge and the importance of &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot; in Russian literature have resulted in a large number of competing translations.

===Into English===

====Arndt and Nabokov====
Walter W. Arndt&#x27;s 1963 translation () was written keeping to the strict rhyme scheme of the Onegin stanza and won the Bollingen Prize for translation. It is still considered one of the best translations.

Vladimir Nabokov severely criticised Arndt&#x27;s translation, as he had criticised many previous (and later) translations. Nabokov&#x27;s main criticism of Arndt&#x27;s and other translations is that they sacrificed literalness and exactness for the sake of preserving the melody and rhyme.

Accordingly, in 1964 he published his own translation, consisting of four volumes, which conformed scrupulously to the sense while completely eschewing melody and rhyme. The first volume contains an introduction by Nabokov and the text of the translation. The Introduction discusses the structure of the novel, the Onegin stanza in which it is written, and Pushkin&#x27;s opinion of Onegin (using Pushkin&#x27;s letters to his friends); it likewise gives a detailed account of both the time over which Pushkin wrote Onegin and of the various forms in which the various parts of it appeared in publication before Pushkin&#x27;s death (after which there is a huge proliferation of the number of different editions). The second and third volumes consist of very detailed and rigorous notes to the text. The fourth volume contains a facsimile of the 1837 edition. The discussion of the Onegin stanza in the first volume contains the poem &quot;On Translating &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;&quot;, which first appeared in print in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; on January 8, 1955, and is written in two Onegin stanzas. Nabokov reproduces the poem both so that the reader of his translation would have some experience of this unique form, and also to act as a further defence of his decision to write his translation in prose.

Nabokov&#x27;s previously close friend Edmund Wilson reviewed Nabokov&#x27;s translation in the &quot;New York Review of Books&quot;, which sparked an exchange of letters and an enduring falling-out between them.

John Bayley has described Nabokov&#x27;s commentary as &#x27;&quot;by far the most erudite as well as the most fascinating commentary in English on Pushkin&#x27;s poem&quot;, and &quot;as scrupulously accurate, in terms of grammar, sense and phrasing, as it is idiosyncratic and Nabokovian in its vocabulary&quot;. It is generally agreed that Nabokov&#x27;s translation is extremely accurate.

====Other English translations====
Henry Spalding published a translation in 1881. Ivan Turgenev called his translation astonishingly faithful, and the text remained the only complete translation for fifty years. Even later, the Russian critic Ernest Simmons praised Spalding for his translation and scholarly notes on Pushkin&#x27;s novel in verse.

Babette Deutsch published a translation in 1935 that preserved the Onegin stanzas.

The Pushkin Press published a translation in 1937 (reprinted 1943) by the Oxford scholar Oliver Elton, with illustrations by M. V. Dobujinsky.

In 1977, Sir Charles Johnston published another translation trying to preserve the Onegin stanza, which is generally considered to surpass Arndt&#x27;s. Johnston&#x27;s translation is influenced by Nabokov. Vikram Seth&#x27;s novel &quot;The Golden Gate&quot; was in turn inspired by this translation.

James E. Falen (professor of Russian at the University of Tennessee) published a translation in 1995 which was also influenced by Nabokov&#x27;s translation, but preserved the Onegin stanzas (). This translation is considered to be the most faithful to Pushkin&#x27;s spirit according to Russian critics and translators.

Douglas Hofstadter published a translation in 1999, again preserving the Onegin stanzas, after having summarised the controversy (and severely criticised Nabokov&#x27;s attitude towards verse translation) in his book &quot;Le Ton beau de Marot&quot;. Hofstadter&#x27;s translation employs a unique lexicon of both high and low register words, as well as unexpected and almost reaching rhymes that give the work a comedic flair.

Tom Beck published a translation in 2004 that also preserved the Onegin stanzas. ()

Wordsworths Classics in 2005 published an English prose translation by Roger Clarke, which sought to retain the lyricism of Pushkin&#x27;s Russian.

In September 2008, Stanley Mitchell, emeritus professor of aesthetics at the University of Derby, published, through Penguin Books, a complete translation, again preserving the Onegin stanzas in English. ()

In 2022, Robert E. Tanner published a translation that preserved the Onegin stanzas and incorporated background and historical information in the interstices provided by the translation from Russian to English. (ISBN 978-0-9990737-5-9)

There are a number of lesser known English translations, at least 45 through 2016.

===Into other languages===

====French====
There are at least eight published French translations of &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;. The most recent appeared in 2005: the translator, André Markovicz, respects Pushkin&#x27;s original stanzas.

====Arabic====
&quot;Eugene Onegin&quot; was translated from Russian into Arabic by the historian and researcher Abdel Hadi Al-Dheisat (عبد الهادي الدهيسات) in 2003, and the Arabic translation is in verse and took over 4 years to be completed.

==Film, TV, radio or theatrical adaptations==
===Opera===

The 1879 opera &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;, by Tchaikovsky, based on the story, is perhaps the version that most people are familiar with. There are many recordings of the score, and it is one of the most commonly performed operas in the world.

===Ballet===

John Cranko choreographed a three-act ballet using Tchaikovsky&#x27;s music in an arrangement by Kurt-Heinz Stolze. However, Stolze did not use any music from Tchaikovsky&#x27;s opera of the same name. Instead, he orchestrated some little-known piano works by Tchaikovsky such as &quot;The Seasons&quot;, along with themes from the opera &quot;Cherevichki&quot; and the latter part of the symphonic fantasia &quot;Francesca da Rimini&quot;.

Choreographer Boris Eifman staged a modern rendition of &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot; as a ballet taking place in modern Moscow. The ballet was performed by Eifman Ballet of St. Petersburg, with music by Alexander Sitkovetsky and with excerpts from Tchaikovsky&#x27;s opera &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;.

Most recently Lera Auerbach created a ballet score titled &quot;Tatiana&quot;, with a libretto written by John Neumeier for his choreographic interpretation and staging of Alexander Pushkin&#x27;s &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;, for a co-production by the Hamburg State Opera and the Stanislavski and Nemirovich-Danchenko Moscow Academic Music Theatre in Moscow.

===Incidental music===
A staged version was adapted by Sigizmund Krzhizhanovsky and slated for production in the Soviet Union in 1936, directed by Alexander Tairov and with incidental music by Sergei Prokofiev, as part of the centennial celebration of Pushkin&#x27;s death. However, due to threats of Stalinist repercussions for artistic liberties taken during the production and artistic differences between Tairov and Krzhizhanovsky, rehearsals were abandoned and the production was never put on.

===Play===
Christopher Webber&#x27;s play &quot;Tatyana&quot; was written for Nottingham Playhouse in 1989. It successfully combines spoken dialogue and narration from the novel, with music arranged from Tchaikovsky&#x27;s operatic score, and incorporates some striking theatrical sequences inspired by Tatyana&#x27;s dreams in the original. The title role was played by Josie Lawrence, and the director was Pip Broughton.

In 2016, the legendary Vakhtangov State Academic Theatre of Russia put on a production of &quot;Onegin&quot; starring Sergei Makovetsky, described as &quot;exuberant, indelible, and arrestingly beautiful&quot; by the &quot;New York Times&quot;.

===Musical===
Opening in 2016 for its world premiere, the Arts Club Theatre Company in Vancouver, Canada, staged a musical version called &quot;Onegin&quot; by Amiel Gladstone and Veda Hille. Rather than being based solely on Pushkin&#x27;s verse narrative, the musical takes equal inspiration from Tchaikovsky&#x27;s opera, subtly incorporating musical motifs from the opera and even using its structure as a template. In fact, it was Gladstone&#x27;s time as assistant director for Vancouver Opera’s last production of Tchaikovsky’s &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot; that opened his eyes to the story’s potential for musical adaptation.

However, the overall musical style of Gladstone and Hille’s &quot;Onegin&quot; is distinctly non-operatic, being instead &quot;an indie-rock musical with a modern flair&quot; that carries over into the costumes and the interactive staging, as well as the ironic and self-referential humour and the titular character&#x27;s &quot;bored hipster persona&quot;.

After opening to general acclaim in 2016, &quot;Onegin&quot; took home a historic 10 Jessie Awards, winning all but one award in its category, including the awards for outstanding production, direction (Gladstone), original composition (Gladstone and Hille), lead actor (Alessandro Juliani as Onegin), lead actress (Meg Roe as Tatyana), and supporting actor (Josh Epstein as Lensky).

Since then, throughout new productions and casting changes, &quot;Onegin&quot; has garnered generally favourable reviews; for example, Louis B. Hobson of &quot;The Calgary Herald&quot; writes, &quot;&quot;Onegin&quot; is not just good, but totally enthralling and deserves all the hype and all the awards it received in Vancouver back in 2016 when it premiered and again in 2017 during its return visit&quot;. Nevertheless, others have criticized the show for artificiality of characterization and &quot;inconsistent dramaturgy&quot;, claiming that &quot;Onegin&quot; fails to &quot;come to life&quot;.

Furthermore, several critics have pointed out similarities to the smash hit &quot;Hamilton&quot; and especially to &quot;Natasha, Pierre &amp; The Great Comet of 1812&quot;, a sung-through musical likewise inspired by a classic of Russian literature (in this case, a sliver of Leo Tolstoy’s &quot;War and Peace&quot;), usually to &quot;Onegin&quot;’s disadvantage.

===Film===
*In 1911, the first screen version of the novel was filmed: the Russian silent film &quot;Yevgeni Onegin&quot; (&quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;), directed by Vasily Goncharov and starring Arseniy Bibikov, Petr Birjukov, and Pyotr Chardynin.
*In 1919, a silent film &quot;Eugen Onegin&quot;, based on the novel, was produced in Germany. The film was directed by Alfred Halm, and starred Frederic Zelnik as Onegin.
*In 1958, Lenfilm produced a TV film &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;, which was not in fact a screen version of the novel, but a screen version of the opera &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot; by Tchaikovsky. The film was directed by Roman Tikhomirov and starred Vadim Medvedev as Onegin, Ariadna Shengelaya as Tatyana, and Igor Ozerov as Lensky. The principal solo parts were performed by notable opera singers of the Bolshoi Theatre. The film was well received by critics and viewers.
*In 1972, Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen (ZDF) produced a music film &quot;Eugen Onegin&quot;.
*In 1988, Decca/Channel 4 produced a film adaptation of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s opera, directed by Petr Weigl. Sir Georg Solti acted as the conductor, while the cast featured Michal Dočolomanský as Onegin and Magdaléna Vášáryová as Tatyana. One major difference from the novel is the duel: Onegin is presented as deliberately shooting to kill Lensky and is unrepentant at the end.
*In 1994, the TV film &quot;Yevgeny Onyegin&quot; was produced, directed by Humphrey Burton and starring Wojtek Drabowicz as Onyegin.
*The 1999 film, &quot;Onegin&quot;, is an English adaptation of Pushkin&#x27;s work, directed by Martha Fiennes, and starring Ralph Fiennes as Onegin, Liv Tyler as Tatyana, and Toby Stephens as Lensky. The film compresses the events of the novel somewhat: for example, the name day celebrations take place on the same day as Onegin&#x27;s speech to Tatyana. The 1999 film, much like the 1988 film, also gives the impression that during the duel sequence Onegin deliberately shoots to kill.

===Radio===
In 2017, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a five-part adaptation by Duncan Macmillan, directed by Abigail le Fleming, as part of their &quot;15-Minute Drama&quot; series, with Geoffrey Streatfeild as Pushkin, David Dawson as Onegin, Zoë Tapper as Natalya, Alix Wilton Regan as Tatyana, Joshua McGuire as Lensky, and Sean Murray as Zaretsky.

===Audiobook===
In 2012, Stephen Fry recorded an audiobook of the novel in the translation by James E. Falen.

<text>Charterhouse is a public school (English independent boarding school for pupils aged 13–18) in Godalming, Surrey, England. Founded by Thomas Sutton in 1611 on the site of the old Carthusian monastery in Charterhouse Square, Smithfield, London, it educates over 1000 pupils, aged 13 to 18 years. Charterhouse is one of the original nine English public schools reported upon by the Clarendon Commission in 1864 leading to its regulation by the Public Schools Act 1868.

Charterhouse charges full boarders up to £47,535 per annum (2023/2024). It educated the British Prime Minister Lord Liverpool and has multiple notable alumni.

== History ==
In May 1611, the London Charterhouse came into the hands of Thomas Sutton (1532–1611) of Knaith, Lincolnshire. He acquired a fortune by the discovery of coal on two estates which he had leased near Newcastle upon Tyne, and afterwards, removing to London, he carried on a commercial career. In 1611, the year of his death, he endowed a hospital on the site of the Charterhouse, calling it the hospital of King James, and in his will he bequeathed moneys to maintain a chapel, hospital (almshouse) and school. He died on 12 December, and subsequently the will was hotly contested but upheld in court, and the foundation was finally constituted to afford a home for eighty male pensioners (gentlemen by descent and in poverty, soldiers that have borne arms by sea or land, merchants decayed by piracy or shipwreck, or servants in household to the King or Queen), and to educate forty boys.
Charterhouse established a reputation for excellence in hospital care and treatment, thanks in part to Henry Levett, an Oxford graduate who joined the school as a physician in 1712. Levett was widely esteemed for his medical writings, including an early tract on the treatment of smallpox. Levett was buried in Charterhouse Chapel and his widow married Andrew Tooke, the headmaster of Charterhouse.

The school was moved to its present site in 1872 by the then headmaster, William Haig Brown – a decision influenced by the findings of the Clarendon Commission of 1864.

The school bought a site atop a hill just outside Godalming. In addition to the main school buildings (designed by architect Philip Charles Hardwick), they constructed three boarding houses, known as Saunderites (once the headmaster&#x27;s house, pronounced &quot;sarnderites&quot; rather than &quot;sornderites&quot;), Verites and Gownboys (for scholars, who were entitled to wear gowns). The school was built by Lucas Brothers, who also built the Royal Albert Hall and Covent Garden.

As pupil numbers grew, other houses were built alongside the approach road, now known as Charterhouse Hill. Each was titled with an adaptation of the name of their first housemaster, such as Weekites, Daviesites and Girdlestoneites. The last of these is still referred to as Duckites, reflecting the unusual gait of its original housemaster, even though he retired well over 100 years ago. There are now the original four &#x27;old&#x27; houses plus ten &#x27;new&#x27; houses (currently three girls&#x27; houses), making fourteen boarding houses in total. These fourteen Houses have preserved a unique identity (each with its own tie and colours) and pupils compete against each other in both sports and the arts. Two new boarding houses were opened upon their completion ahead of the start of the 2021–22 academic year. This was done by former pupil and sitting MP Jeremy Hunt. This made the total number of houses reach fifteen.

The school continued to expand over the 20th century. Further land was bought to the north and west, increasing the grounds to over , and a new school chapel was designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott (perhaps best known for designing the red telephone box) and consecrated in 1927 to commemorate almost 700 pupils who died in the First World War, making it the largest war memorial in England. Around 350 names have been subsequently added to commemorate those who died in the Second World War and other more recent conflicts.

An addition to the campus was seven new Houses, built in the 1970s, replacing late Victorian boarding houses which were demolished in 1977. Other newer buildings include the Art Studio, the John Derry Technology Centre, the Ben Travers Theatre, the Ralph Vaughan Williams Music Centre, the Halford Hewitt Golf Course, the Queen&#x27;s Sports Centre, the Sir Greville Spratt athletics track and Chetwynd, a hall of residence for girls. In 2003, the School renovated its onsite Library. 2006 saw the opening of The Beveridge Centre for the Social Sciences. In 2007, a £3m Modern Languages building was completed.

The school has a top 60 placing in the A level league tables, and in 2011 over 80% of pupils are awarded an A* or A grade at GCSE. In 2009, the school announced its decision to switch from A Levels to the International Baccalaureate and Cambridge Pre-U. In 2012 Charterhouse had its best set of Cambridge Pre-U results with 96% of examinations taken awarded Distinction or Merit grades. Seventy-eight pupils achieved Distinctions (or their A level equivalent) in all subjects taken and twenty-one achieved the equivalent of A level A* grades in all their subjects. Twenty pupils were offered places at Oxford or Cambridge.

In 2007, Roy Hattersley, former Deputy Leader of the Labour Party and minister, reported on a visit to Charterhouse in the Guardian newspaper. After describing his impression that &quot;[The chapel]&#x27;s geometric spires and minarets proclaim complete confidence that Charterhouse educates men who are destined to rule the universe&quot;, he said: &quot;Academically and pastorally, it is near to beyond criticism. And after only a brief glimpse of the school, I have no doubt that I would have been ecstatically happy there. But its existence allows the rich and the powerful to ignore the world beyond its boundaries.&quot; He therefore concluded that his aspiration to abolish private education in the 1970s was &quot;totally justified&quot;.

 The 2009 Ofsted Social Care Inspection Report noted that &#x27;The provision for &quot;Helping children achieve well and enjoy what they do&quot; is rated as outstanding.&#x27; and &#x27;This is a good school, in which boarders&#x27; welfare is promoted by a strong approach to countering bullying and child protection. Boarding staff have good relationships with the boarders, and boarders can list a range of people who they can talk to if they are worried or have concerns.&#x27;

 The 2011 Independent Schools Inspectorate Report noted that &#x27;The quality of pupils&#x27; achievements is excellent. Pupils are extremely well educated. They attain extremely high standards in external examinations and make exceptional progress in their learning because of their positive attitudes to study, dedicated and often inspiring teaching, and an academically challenging curriculum that is adapted to suit all needs. The curriculum is enriched by an outstanding range of activities&#x27;.

 The 2017 ISI Educational Quality Inspection Report noted that ‘Pupils&#x27; academic and other achievements are high and often exceptional. Pupils&#x27; successes in external competitions, in academic distinctions and in sport, music and the creative and aesthetic arts are exceptional. Pupils&#x27; social development is outstanding. Pupils are polite, courteous and respectful of one another and of the adults who care for them. Relationships between pupils and staff are excellent. Pupils mature into independent and self-motivated pupils over the course of their time at school and are extremely well prepared, not only for the next stage of their lives, but also to contribute to society at large.’

Charterhouse originally accepted boys only. The school began accepting girls in sixth form in 1971. In 2017 the school announced that it was moving to full co-education from the age of 13, and welcomed the first girls into Year 9 in September 2021. Since September 2023 there have been girls in every year group.

== Houses ==

There are four old boarding houses and eleven new houses in the White Book (a directory of names) order. In Charterhouse vocabulary an &quot;old&quot; house is one which was founded before the school’s move to Godalming in 1872, as opposed to the &quot;new&quot; houses which were created later and are situated away from the main school. They are all distinguished by the colour of the pupils&#x27; ties, umbrellas and football team&#x27;s stripes.

In Autumn 2010, a new house was opened for sixth-form pupils, called Fletcherites, named after Frank Fletcher, a former headmaster. The house moved into the old Great Comp building, now renovated. Verites, Saunderites and Gownboys predate the move to Godalming in 1872 and are known as the &quot;old&quot; houses. Saunderites is named after its first Housemaster Dr. Saunders (Headmaster 1832–53) and it was the Headmaster&#x27;s house, in that the headmaster would run not only the school but also one of the houses. Gownboys was named not after their original housemaster, but because it was the scholars&#x27; house, although scholars were distributed across all the houses after the transfer to Godalming. As was tradition, scholars wore gowns with their uniform and were treated as superior to other boys. There is no longer such a tradition and the scholars are now distributed throughout the various houses, on a random but numerically equal basis. There are still scholars in Gownboys, but in no greater proportion than any other house.

All new Houses apart from Bodeites are named after their founders (although Robinites was originally Robinsonites). Bodeites was originally Buissonites, named after the Head of Languages at the time. He ran off with the matron, and so the house was renamed Bodeites after the replacement, Mr Bode.

To keep up with the increasing number of female applicants to the school, Charterhouse began transitioning former boys&#x27; houses Weekites and Girdlestoneites into girl only houses. Weekites became coeducational at the start of OQ 2022 with 36 girls joining in Year 9, Year 10 and Lower Sixth. Girdlestoneites also became coed in OQ of 2023. In 2024 it was announced that Lockites would become an all girls house by 2028.

== Sports ==

=== Origins of football ===
Association Football is the main Winter sport at the school. During the 1840s at both Charterhouse and Westminster School pupils&#x27; surroundings meant they were confined to playing their football in the cloisters, making the rough and tumble of the handling game that was developing at other schools such as Rugby impossible, and necessitating a new code of rules. Dingley Dell, the most active non-school team in the London area in the five years before the Football Association was established in 1863, played Charterhouse eight times between February 1860 and February 1863. During the formulation of the rules of the Association Football in the 1860s representatives of Charterhouse and Westminster School pushed for a passing game, in particular rules that allowed forward passing (&quot;passing on&quot;). Other schools (in particular Eton College, Shrewsbury School and Harrow) favoured a dribbling game with a tight off-side rule. It is claimed that Stoke Ramblers was formed in 1863 when former pupils of Charterhouse School formed a football club while apprentices at the North Staffordshire Railway works in Stoke-on-Trent. By 1867 the Football Association had chosen in favour of the Charterhouse and Westminster game and adopted a &quot;loose&quot; off-side rule that permitted forward passing. The modern forward-passing game was a direct consequence of Charterhouse and Westminster football.

===Cricket ground===
The first recorded match on the school cricket ground came in 1859, when the school played Marlborough College. From its inception, the school has used the ground to take on a number of colleges in England. The cricket ground has held a single List-A match, which was played between Surrey and Warwickshire in the 1972 John Player League. Starting in 2006, the ground has held a number of Surrey Second XI fixtures in the Second XI Championship and Second XI Trophy.

==Herbarium==
The School&#x27;s Herbarium carries the Index Herbariorum designation GOD and is maintained as The Charterhouse School Herbarium in the University and Jepson Herbaria, University of California, Berkeley.

The scope of the collections is mainly the British Isles, although some plants are from Europe, South Africa and eastern North America. The principal collectors were James Edward Moxon, Rev. George Brown Moxon, Rev. Tullie Cornthwaite, Rev. Samuel Titmas (first curator of Charterhouse Museum), Frederick Yorke Brocas, Andrew Bloxam, William Gardiner, James Buckman and John Drew Salmon. The collections are currently being digitised and being released by the Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland, on the herbaria@home website. Over 1000 specimens have been databased and imaged and are available on the UC/JEPS specimen portal .
== Carthusian language ==
Known as Lingua Carthusiana, the terminology of this language or idiolect has evolved over the centuries of Charterhouse&#x27;s existence and is used within the Charterhouse community on a daily basis.
== Fees ==
In any given year, there is some contention about which is the most expensive public school in England, depending on whether one compares day fees or boarding fees. In 2019, Charterhouse was reported to be among the most expensive schools for boarding pupils. Charging up to £11,415 per term in 2014/15, Charterhouse is the 7th most expensive HMC boarding school in the UK. For the 2022/23 academic year, day boarding fees are £36,540 and boarding is £44,220.

== Controversy ==

=== School fees cartel (2005) ===

In November 2005, the school was one of fifty of the country&#x27;s leading independent schools which were found guilty of running an illegal price-fixing cartel, exposed by &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper, although the schools made clear that they had not realised that the change to the law (which had happened only a few months earlier) about the sharing of information had subsequently made it an offence. Each school was required to pay a nominal penalty of £10,000 and all agreed to make ex-gratia payments totalling three million pounds into a trust designed to benefit pupils who attended the schools during the period in respect of which fee information was shared. Mrs Jean Scott, the head of the Independent Schools Council, said that independent schools had always been exempt from anti-cartel rules applied to business, were following a long-established procedure in sharing the information with each other, and that they were unaware of the change to the law (on which they had not been consulted). She wrote to John Vickers, the director-general of the Office of Fair Trading saying: &quot;They are not a group of businessmen meeting behind closed doors to fix the price of their products to the disadvantage of the consumer. They are schools that have quite openly continued to follow a long-established practice because they were unaware that the law had changed.&quot;

=== Gary Lineker accusations (2010) ===

In August 2010, former English footballer Gary Lineker publicly accused Charterhouse of failing his son, George, in his bid for a place at university. Lineker claimed that the school had used him as a &#x27;guinea pig&#x27; by ditching A-Levels for the new Cambridge Pre-U. The school reacted by saying it was proud of its students&#x27; results. John Witheridge, then headmaster, defended the choice of the Pre-U as being more academically rigorous and educationally valid than the current A-Level standard in an article in &quot;The Spectator&quot; in August 2010.

=== Historic sexual abuse ===
In March 2012, it was reported that a 16-year-old had filmed fellow pupils while they showered, and stored the images on his laptop. The boy was taken into custody by Surrey Police for questioning. A police inquiry was subsequently established.

In April 2013, a physics teacher, Dean Johnson, resigned after allegations of an &#x27;inappropriate relationship&#x27; with a former teenage girl pupil led to a police investigation. A police investigation followed, and resulted in a conviction after trial by a jury for the teacher who was found to be in possession of extreme pornography, which depicted a woman being hanged, in 2015; he was given an eight-month prison sentence, suspended for two years. A professional misconduct panel later found:

* that he had sex with her in a classroom at the school;
* that he had communicated his fantasies to the girl over Facebook;
* that he had asked what her underwear size was before buying stockings and presenting them to her gift-wrapped;
* that the relationship became sexual weeks after the girl turned 18.
As a result, in 2017, Johnson was made the subject of a prohibition order, prohibiting him from teaching in any school, sixth form college, relevant youth accommodation or children&#x27;s home in England; the order was made with no provision for him to apply for any future restoration of his eligibility to teach.

In 2018, Cathy Newman, who attended the school on a scholarship, said that she was humiliated and sexually harassed while a pupil at the school. Other ex-pupils told &quot;The Times&quot; about experiences including a humiliating initiation ceremony at the school and flashing and groping incidents. Rebecca Willis, commenting on similar themes around the time reiterated these themes, but also commented on racism which resulted in Asian children leaving. The school has subsequently contacted former pupils to ask them to share concerns.

== Film location ==
The school is occasionally used as a film location. It was used as a filming location for Jules Shear&#x27;s music video for his 1983 single &quot;Whispering Your Name&quot;, in which Shear visits the school as a guest music teacher and a group of British schoolchildren mime to the chorus. The song would eventually be a hit for Allison Moyet 11 years later. It was used to represent the Palace of Westminster in the 2018 BBC drama &quot;Bodyguard&quot; and in seasons 4 and 5 of Netflix&#x27;s &quot;The Crown&quot; where the Memorial Chapel and South African Cloisters are made to represent the House of Commons as well as the film &quot;Peterloo&quot; which used the chapel as the House of Lords. In addition, a location outside Brooke Hall was used in the filming of &quot;The Crown&quot; season 5. It has previously been used in &quot;The Boys are Back&quot;, &quot;Jupiter Ascending&quot;, &quot;St Trinian’s 2: The Legend of Fritton’s Gold&quot;, &quot;The Mystery of Edwin Drood&quot; (an adaptation of a Charles Dickens novel), &quot;Foyle&#x27;s War&quot;, &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot;, and &quot;Vampire Academy&quot;.

<doc id="188961" wikidata="Q1921431" url="?curid=188961" title="Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood">
<text>Merchant Taylors&#x27; School is an 11–18 boys public day school, founded in 1561 in London. The school has occupied various campuses. From 1933 it has been at Sandy Lodge, a site close to Northwood in the Three Rivers district of Hertfordshire. The school has 1100 students between the ages of 11 and 18. The school is an all-through school from age 3 to 18 after merger with Northwood Prep School in 2015.

Founded in 1561 by Sir Thomas White, Sir Richard Hilles, Emanuel Lucar and Stephen Hales, it was one of the nine English public schools investigated by the Clarendon Commission set up in 1861, and successfully argued that it should be omitted from the Public Schools Act 1868, as did St Paul&#x27;s School, London, the other day school investigated by the Clarendon Commission.

== History ==

===Establishment, 1561===

The school was founded in 1561 by Thomas White of the Merchant Taylors&#x27; Company in a manor house in the parish of St Lawrence Pountney in the City of London, where it remained until 1875.

A curious account survives of a rent payment ritual in London for the Merchant Taylors School in which Sir Rowland Hill, the Lord Mayor of London in 1549 who had coordinated the Geneva Bible translation, presided shortly before he diedThe xxx day of September my lord mayre and the althermen and the new shreyffes took ther barges at the iij cranes in the Vintre and so to Westmynster, and so into the Cheker, and ther took ther hoythe; and ser Rowland Hyll whent up, and master Hoggys toke ser Rowland Hyll a choppyng kneyf, and one dyd hold a whyt rod, and he with the kneyf cute the rod in sunder a-for all the pepull; and after to London to ther plases to dener, my lord mayre and all the althermen and mony worshiphulle men.Merchant Taylors&#x27; was not the first school to be founded by members of the Merchant Taylors&#x27; Company. Sir John Percival (Master of the Company in 1485, Lord Mayor of London in 1498) established a grammar school at Macclesfield in 1502, while in 1508 his widow founded one at St. Mary&#x27;s Wike in Cornwall (which moved to Launceston shortly thereafter). Also in 1508, Sir Steven Jenyns (Master in 1490, Lord Mayor in 1508) founded Wolverhampton Grammar School, which still maintains strong links with the Company.

The first Head Master, Richard Mulcaster, took up his post in 1561; one of the houses at Merchant Taylors&#x27; is now named after him. His educational philosophy is embodied in two books, &quot;The Positions&quot; (1581) and &quot;The Elementarie&quot; (1582), the latter an instalment of a larger work and one of the first dictionaries in English. One of his first pupils was Edmund Spenser. His goal was that English as a language might claim its place side by side with Latin: 

Mulcaster&#x27;s views were ahead of his time: he advocated the importance to children of relaxation and games, and a knowledge of the countryside and world of nature. He &quot;wished that schools were planted in the suburbs of towns near to the fields&quot;. He was also &quot;tooth and nail for womankind&quot; in matters of education. He believed that education should fit women for their appropriate station.

The successive outbreaks of plague in 1592, 1603, 1626, 1630, 1637 and 1666, had a damaging effect on the School and its pupils. The School was obliged to break up during these periods, losing pupils and sometimes unable to take on new ones. In 1626 the headmaster Nicholas Gray complained of the loss of pupils and was given £20 to keep the school going; in 1630 he was given £40. Many parents kept their sons away from school, and boarders were summoned home.

The School was closed for at least a year in 1636 and 1637, with no new boys admitted until the contagion abated. The outbreak of 1666 was curtailed by the Great Fire of London, which started on 2 September close to Suffolk Lane and completely destroyed the school buildings. It was rebuilt by 1675, after classes had met in temporary quarters for years.

===1606–1633===

In 1606 Robert Dow, a member of the Company, instigated the process of &quot;probation&quot; or inspection, whereby the Court would visit the school three times each year and observe the school at work. Dow was concerned that the school was not meeting the challenge of being one of the great schools of the time and needed regular inspection to maintain and raise its standards. The Court appointed a committee to investigate and concluded:

The probation was imposed without consultation with the schoolmasters. During the probation, the headmaster was required to open his copy of Cicero at random and read out a passage to the sixth form. The boys had to copy the passage from dictation and then translate it, first into English, then into Greek and then into Latin verse. After this, they had to write a passage of Latin and some verses on some topic chosen for the day. This was for the morning; in the afternoon the process was repeated in Greek, based on the Greek Testament, &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Fables&quot;, &quot;or some other very easie Greeke author&quot;. The standard in Greek was not as high as in Latin, but Hebrew was also taught.

This form of inspection was the model for teaching every day, as neither mathematics nor science were included in the curriculum. The pattern of teaching seen in the Probations at MTS was described in a popular work published in 1660, &quot;A New Discovery of the Art of Teaching Schoole&quot; by Charles Hoole. Hoole described the nature of education at the time:

* 6.00 a.m. was considered the time for children to start their studies but 7.00 a.m. was more common;
* Pupils of upper forms were appointed to give lessons to younger ones;
* Pupils were required to examine each other in pairs; and
* Children frequently went to &quot;Writing-schooles&quot; at the end of the school day; the purpose of this was to &quot;learn a good hand&quot;. Good handwriting was supposed to be a condition of entry to a school like MTS but Hayne for one tended to ignore it and was eventually dismissed for, among other things, low standards of hand writing. In Germany at this time, there were writing schools too and many children attended only these in order to learn sufficient skills for commerce and trade; English businessmen founded schools which encouraged an academic curriculum based on the classics.

The Head Master William Hayne (1599–1624) presided over the new methods of examination, but his success did not save him from dismissal for alleged financial misdemeanours. He was said to have sold text books to pupils for profit, and received gifts of money at the end of term and on Shrove Tuesday, when the &quot;Victory Penny&quot; might be presented by pupils.

===1634–1685===

William Staple (Head Master 1634–1644) fell victim to contemporary politics. In October 1643 Parliament ordered &quot;That the Committee for plundered Ministers shall have power to enquire after malignant School-masters.&quot; In March 1644 Staple was ordered to appear before this committee, but as a royalist, he had no intention of so doing. He was dismissed and the Company had to seek a new headmaster.

The next Head Master William Dugard (1644–1661), previously headmaster of Stamford School, also ran into trouble. In 1649 he acquired a printing press and printed a pamphlet by Claudius Salmasius, a continental sympathiser with Charles I, entitled &quot;Defensio Regia pro Carolo Primo&quot;. Dugard was arrested and imprisoned, but as the pamphlet had not been distributed, his cousin Sir James Harrington was able to exert sufficient influence to have him released.

In 1647 Dugard had been appointed a member of the Stationers&#x27; Company; he did not declare his interests to the Court, and they were most annoyed at this extracurricular activity. In 1652, during the commonwealth, a time of religious experimentation, Dugard published &quot;Catechesis Ecclesiarum Poloniae et Lithuaniae&quot; (Ecclesiastical Catechism of Poland and Lithuania), a work that rejected Trinitarianism. Though the work had been licensed by Milton, it was seized and publicly burned, yet Dugard survived as headmaster and was simply required to give up his printing enterprise.

At this time the school fees were set at 2s 2d or 5s per quarter or nothing, but Dugard charged a variety of amounts; the number of pupils was down from the 250 expected by the Company. When he left in 1661, he set up a new school in Coleman Street and took a number of MTS pupils with him.

The next headmaster, John Goad (1661–1681), guided the school through rebuilding after the plague in 1666 and the destruction of the Great Fire of London. His eventual dismissal may have been influenced by the accusations of Titus Oates, who had been a pupil at MTS for a few months in 1665–66, although Goad survived for years afterward. Oates had brief stays at other schools, being dismissed from each in turn. In 1678 Oates &quot;discovered&quot; the &quot;Popish Plot&quot;, which was supposed to include a threat to kill Charles II, but it was later found to be a hoax by him. William Smith, a master at MTS and later headmaster at the Brewers&#x27; School in Islington, wrote of his first encounter with Oates:

In 1676, Oates confronted Smith and accused him of participating in yet another fabricated plot, forcing Smith to commit perjury to avoid punishment. Initially, the MTS Probation Book described Oates as &quot;The saviour of the nation, first discoverer of ye damnable Popish Plot in 1678.&quot; However, by 1685, a postscript had been added, labeling him &quot;Perjurd upon Record and a Scoundrell Fellow.&quot; In this atmosphere of suspicion, even a hint of Roman Catholic sympathies was enough to ruin a man’s reputation. After his dismissal in 1681, Goad converted to Roman Catholicism.

=== 1686–1759 ===

When the headmastership fell vacant again in 1686, King James II tried to force his nominee James Lee on the Company. The election was postponed and the Master, Sir William Dodson, persuaded Lee to withdraw his nomination. Lee, formerly second usher at MTS and then headmaster at St Saviour&#x27;s Free School, Southwark, stood against Ambrose Bonwicke but lost. Bonwicke, OMT, was a former pupil of Goad and had an acute mind, but he was dismissed for his political sentiments.

James abdicated in 1688, William III and Mary II acceded, and men were obliged once again to proclaim their loyalties. The majority avoided controversy by swearing allegiance to &quot;the king&quot;. Bonwicke delayed for a year before the Court was forced by Act of Parliament to hear his oath of allegiance. Bonwicke said he supported James and was duly dismissed.

Under Matthew Shortyng, Head Master 1691–1707, the top boys of the Sixth began to be called &quot;The Table&quot; and &quot;The Bench&quot;, with nine at the Table, the captain and eight monitors; and nine at the Bench, called prompters because they prompted the monitors on election day.

In 1710 Ambrose Bonwicke, son of the former Head Master, was captain of the school and refused to read prayers for King William on St Barnabas Day. Despite his intellectual prowess, his family&#x27;s continuing support for James cost Bonwicke his election to St. John&#x27;s College, Oxford and he went to St. John&#x27;s College, Cambridge instead. At this time, there was a shortage of places at the school, as its reputation for scholarship and consequent chance of a university education attracted parents from all over the country. In 1750 a regulation was passed that boys should not be eligible for election to St. John&#x27;s Oxford unless they had been at MTS for at least three years.

One pupil who would not have qualified for election under this rule was Robert Clive. He was at MTS from 1738–1739 and completed his education at Shrewsbury in his native Shropshire. The Head Master was then John Criche, OMT, a man who had occupied every position in the school and was not predisposed to change it. Criche was also a Jacobite. The school suffered during his tenure because parents were unwilling to send their sons to a school where anti-dynastic sentiments might prevail. Criche died in office at the age of 80, by when the school enrollment numbers had fallen from 244 to 116.

===1760–1813===

The next Head Master, James Townley, was in office from 1760 to 1768. Townley wrote a successful play, &quot;High Life Below Stairs&quot;, which was staged at Drury Lane by David Garrick and proved very popular.

The next three headmasters over the period 1778–1819, Green, Bishop and Cherry, were all OMTs. One of Bishop&#x27;s pupils, Charles Mathews, went on to become a successful actor and comedian. His memoirs, from the late 18th century, include these observations:

=== 1814–1844 ===

In 1814 Cherry made a detailed proposal for the setting up of an arithmetic and writing school and for the teaching of mathematics and accounts. Again the proposal was first deferred and then dropped. It was to be a further 15 years before mathematics was finally admitted into the school curriculum. In 1811 H.B. Wilson was granted permission to write a history of the school but he was overlooked as Head Master in 1819 on the appointment of James Bellamy, Head Master 1819–45. In 1828 Bellamy advised the Company of the need to modernise to &quot;meet the daily increasing demand for a more general education&quot;, by which he meant in particular the founding of University College and King&#x27;s College at the University of London. In 1830 education was as topical as it is today with writers like Christopher North advocating its spread, though fearful of the consequences, &quot;from the classes to the masses&quot;. The Court voted £200 towards the founding of King&#x27;s College and in 1829 Bellamy once again pleaded that the school be placed on the same level as other places of education. Beginning in 1830, classics was taught in the morning and mathematics in the afternoon, specialist teachers were appointed and by 1845 French was being considered for two afternoons per week. The last proposal proved too expensive but the further success of the school began to make it clear that the current premises were too small and new ones should be found.

Still, in the 1870s, Sir D&#x27;Arcy Power comments on the curriculum he faced: 

Nor was there much teaching of English. Bishop Samuel Thornton wrote: 
He adds however: 
It is likely that many parents cared little what was taught as long as their boys did well enough to attain a scholarship to university.

The city environment around it included a brewery which belched smoke and soot and a printing works whose apprentices fought with M.T.S. boys almost daily. According to A. J. Church in 1857: 

For more than two centuries the only place where teaching was carried on was the Great Schoolroom; its dimensions were about by . It was lighted very imperfectly by windows on either side, large enough, indeed, but obscured by the heavy leading of the diamond panes and by the long-standing accumulations of dirt ... The four classrooms were all more or less recent additions to the school accommodation. Bishop Samuel Thornton remembered the London fogs of his schooldays in the 1840s when &quot;little was done on those dark days, the dreamy and unwonted state of affairs generating an excited condition in the Forms, unfavourable to discipline and work&quot;. There was also a constant din from outside the school which interfered greatly with the conduct of lessons. Until the 1860s no provision was made for feeding the boys at lunch time. In 1838 there were 58 boys in the Fourth, being taught in this room and without gas lighting – small wonder that the masters resorted to the stick to keep control.

=== 1845–1865 ===

James Augustus Hessey, Head Master from 1845 to 1870, improved many aspects of the school, increasing the number of masters, introducing school lunches and appointing a &#x27;superior&#x27; teacher of mathematics. The rough practices of among the boys &#x27;pulling&#x27; on clothes and &#x27;bumping&#x27; against the pillars of the cloisters were banned, something which at first caused open rebellion among the younger boys but in which Hessey had his way by his firm insistence on more civilised behaviour. Hessey was also agitating for a change of location. Two Commissions of this time, the Oxford Commission and the Public Schools Commission (under Lord Clarendon), threatened the well-being of the school. The Oxford Commission restructured the arrangements for scholarships between the school and St. John&#x27;s College so there was no longer such an easy path for boys to reach university. There had grown a general feeling that all was not well with Eton and other &quot;public&quot; schools and the Commission was appointed to investigate and put this right. The Schools Commission visited M.T.S. in 1862 and published its report in 1864. It was noted that parents were increasingly reluctant to send their sons to school in London due to the overcrowding, the lack of games facilities and increasing accessibility to country schools. It was proposed that Charterhouse and Westminster, boarding schools, should move out of London and that Merchant Taylors&#x27; and St. Paul&#x27;s, day schools, should increase their premises. It was also recommended that, while the classical character of the curriculum should be continued, science, German, music and more drawing should be introduced.

=== 1866–1907 ===

In 1866, following reasoned argument from Hessey and the report of the Commission, the Company bought of estate in Goswell Street for £90,000 from the Governors of the Charterhouse. Charterhouse School vacated the London Charterhouse in 1872, and it was taken over by Merchant Taylors. New school buildings were begun in 1873 and completed in 1875. Plans for the school on the new site included immediate expansion to 350 boys and later to 500, the development of a more modern curriculum to meet demand for &quot;Modern Languages, Science and Commerce&quot;, and the raising of fees from 10 to 12 guineas for the lower school and 12 guineas to 15 guineas for the upper. William Baker, OMT, Head Master from 1870–1900, wanted to develop the whole of the new site for games, &quot;to foster a corporate and public spirit among the boys of the School, by drawing them together in common amusements and giving them common interests&quot;. On the development of playing fields around the school, Baker wrote in 1872: 
These ideas were in line with the policy of other public schools, which had placed great emphasis on games and outdoor activities (as they still, for the most part, do) since the time of Thomas Arnold at Rugby School. Baker was conservative in his views, considering the classics as the best means of training the mind, but he was almost equally keen on mathematics and paid much attention to its teaching in the school. In his time, chemistry and physics were introduced, and a new science building was finished in 1891. Baker proposed the introduction of biology, which was first taught as an extra in 1900.

French was still in a precarious position within the school curriculum – from a total of 3900 marks (from 78 scripts worth 50 marks each) in an examination in 1874 only 123 marks were actually scored and 53 boys submitted blank papers. The master in charge of the &#x27;Modern Side&#x27; pointed out that boys joined his area not because they showed promise in French but because they had no obvious gift for the classics. On the appointment of John Nairn in 1900 to succeed Baker the new headmaster asked Professor Ernest Weekly to inspect the modern language teaching. He drew attention to the dominant role of Latin in determining a boy&#x27;s promotion, to the beginning of Greek at too young an age and to the lack of systematic instruction in English. Meanwhile, Baker recommended the adoption of the newly established Oxford and Cambridge Schools Examination Board for examination of higher work which for the first time provided a means for comparison between schools. Until this point schools could differ considerably in the ways they assessed pupils and conducted their affairs; today we take for granted the existence of national standards and criteria and the use of public examination results to compare one school, however invidiously, against another.

In the early 1900s the number of boys at the school began to fall, due in part to the rise of good and not too expensive schools in the country around London such as Bedford School, Berkhamsted, University College School, King&#x27;s College School, St. Dunstan&#x27;s, St Olave&#x27;s and Latymer Upper School, amongst others. Science and technical subjects were being developed in institutions funded by public money and there was some pressure on the incomes of the class that sent its sons to schools like Merchant Taylors&#x27;. It became increasingly apparent that boys were travelling long distances to school each day, from as far as Hertford, Guildford and Leigh-on-Sea, the school needed a prep. school for boys aged 8–11 and a sports ground nearer than Bellingham. Nairn began to think that the school might be better placed on the outskirts of London. In 1914 the Oxford and Cambridge School Examination Board inspected the school and, amongst their conclusions, found the hours of the school too short and the homework too long, all of which limited their time for fresh air and recreation. The Board also said that the curriculum was too narrow, that the needs of a few potential classical scholars were dominating the needs of the many. Even at this stage the only education in English teaching was gained from the translation of Latin and Greek. In the 1860s the school had been &#x27;one of the nine&#x27; but its position was now threatened by the competition of new schools. In 1925 the matter of the school&#x27;s location was raised again but any suggestion that it should be moved was vetoed by the School Committee.

=== 1908–1927 ===

In 1908 Lord Haldane reorganised the School cadet corps, making them into a single body, the Officer Training Corps, which provided an essential source of officers for the First World War. In 1912 the London Rifle Brigade was permitted to billet three companies in the school and when war came the regiment was billeted there. The Old Merchant Taylors held a meeting at the Hall and 200 enlisted forthwith. In 1918 enlistment in the O.T.C. became compulsory and in 1921 a house system was introduced with four houses named Hilles, White, Spenser and Clive.

=== 1927–1961 ===

The next Head Master, Spencer Leeson, served for just nine years but in that time he proposed and supervised what was probably the greatest single event in the history of the school, the movement from the city of London to the green suburbs of Ruislip, Northwood, and Rickmansworth, an area bounded by branches of the Metropolitan Railway. Leeson made his mind up quickly and advised a move and the Company fell quickly behind him. He invited an inspection by the Board of Education in 1928 and concluded from their report that the school must move: &quot;At Charterhouse Square we can never rejoin the number of the great schools of England&quot;. He attached a letter from Cyril Norwood which included these words:

The site at Sandy Lodge was bought in late 1929 and plans were drawn up for the new school by architect WG Newton, in the Neo-Georgian style The cost of the initial proposals was greeted with some dismay, meaning that they had to be revised &quot;at great sacrifice of beauty and efficiency&quot; to bring costs down, and eventually the Court accepted them. The site at Charterhouse Square was sold to St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital who had been previous owners, having bought the site in 1349 from the Master of the Spital Croft hospital. The move to Sandy Lodge was completed in March 1933, with a farewell service to the city held at St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral on 20 March. The first new term at Sandy Lodge began on 4 May, and the School was formally opened on 12 June.

Birley&#x27;s headmastership was defined by the events of the Second World War, when many of the masters and students were called up to fight. Before war broke out, Birley proposed to build a chapel which would fit the entire school (about 600 pupils at this time). Plans for a whole-school chapel had been included in the original plans for the school, but never came to fruition – partially due to budgetary constraints. These plans were revisited and reworked by Master R. T. D. Sayle, and after much convincing the Court agreed to proceed with the proposal. However, just as the plans had taken shape, the Second World War put them on indefinite hold. Instead, the temporary chapel (occupying the space intended to be a classroom) was renovated, and became the chapel which is still in place today.

When the War ended, Birley informed the Court that he wished to retire, and allow a younger, more energetic man to take over. Before he left, The Third form (years 7 &amp; 8) was introduced to allow those from state primaries to enter the school, following the Fleming Committee report in 1944. Lord Clauson, who had great influence within the Court, was particularly eager to implement the scheme: &quot;Our predecessors made an educational ladder on which boys could climb to the university, whatever their circumstances. The ladder is still here, but a rung is missing and we must put it back.&quot; It was named the &#x27;Third Form&#x27; because the age of entry had been raised from 10 to 13 in the early 20th century, as such the bottom three forms had vanished. This meant that by 1944 the lowest year at the school was the Fourth Form.

Upon entering office, Elder set about re-organising the house system which had been implemented in 1921, which he viewed as dysfunctional. The boarders of the Manor of the Rose were spread throughout all four houses, and it was believed that houses of 120 were too large (as of 2017, each house has about 110 students) – as well as lacking Housemasters. It seemed to Elder that membership of houses meant very little to the students. As such, he re-divided the school into eight houses, giving boarders their own house (Manor of the Rose), and introducing three new houses (Andrews, Mulcaster and Walter). Elder created the position of Housemaster, who he envisaged would be the pastoral support of each pupil throughout their career.

In addition, reform was creeping into the school at this time, with the privilege of not wearing a cap (which had previously only applied to Monitors), was extended to Prompters and House Prefects, and subsequently to the entire Sixth Form. Around this time, Elder re-introduced the position of Second Master, which had been absent for many years. Games was also made compulsory during his tenure.

The school celebrated its quatercentenary in 1961, and a new art block was given by the Merchant Taylors&#x27; Company to honour the event.

=== 1961–present ===
Hugh Elder was succeeded by Brian Rees (1965–73) and subsequently by Francis Davey (1974–81), under whose tenures the Recital Hall and a new Biology department was built. Under the headmastership of David Skipper (1982–91), wide-ranging developments took place, notably the building of a new Sports Hall and indoor swimming pool (1986), with the old Gymnasium being converted into a studio theatre for Drama.

During the tenure of Jon Gabitass (1991–2004), the sports complex was expanded, and on the east side of the school, he the Recital Hall/Biology department was joined by a Modern Languages building, expanded Art block, and a new lecture theatre. Under Gabitass, Saturday schooling was abolished, and boarding was ended soon after 2000 due to a decline in demand. The Manor of the Rose became a day house just like the other seven houses, and the building converted into staff accommodation. Also under Gabitass, the area under the Great Hall was redeveloped, introducing a reception area and Sixth Form Common Room. Gabitass also oversaw the removal of the Old Merchant Taylors’ clubhouse from Croxley Green to the school site. 

The school celebrated its 450th anniversary in 2011, and retains close links with other Merchant Taylors&#x27; schools through the Merchant Taylors&#x27; Educational Trust and with the Merchant Taylors&#x27; Company itself. The members of the Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors visit the school at least twice a year – notably on St Barnabas&#x27; Day and Doctor&#x27;s Day – and form the school&#x27;s governing body. Under Simon Everson (2013–present), a new Design and Technology block has been built (2016) and the Fives courts were demolished and replaced by a modern Geography centre. In 2024 a new cricket centre was opened.

In March 2024, the school announced that all 13+ admission would halt after 2025.

== Overview ==
The Merchant Taylors&#x27; remains a school for boys only, and accepts pupils based upon an entrance examination, which the boys sit when they are either 11, 13 or 16 years old. The school has a close relationship with its &quot;sister school&quot; St Helen&#x27;s School, Northwood and the boys also work on occasion with girls from other schools, notably Northwood College.

The school&#x27;s old boys, called Old Merchant Taylors (OMTs), include naturalists, poets, actors, academics, politicians, authors, sportsmen, and military figures, including three winners of the Victoria Cross award. OMTs include Lancelot Andrewes, who oversaw the translation of the King James&#x27; Bible; John Walter, founding editor of The Times; John Sulston, Nobel laureate in Physiology and Medicine; Marshal of the Royal Air Force The Lord Stirrup, former Chief of the Defence Staff; historian E. H. Carr; actor Boris Karloff; Lord Coggan, Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Clive and many more. In the arts, OMTs have won Academy, Emmy and Grammy Awards. There is also a strong OMT presence in both Houses of Parliament.

=== Publications ===
The school has four main publications:

* Scissorum is a weekly online newsletter
* Concordia is the school&#x27;s magazine for alumni, the name again referring to the motto.
* The Taylorian (published since 1868; now published annually) is a record of the highlights of the preceding academic year and includes the names of all who join the school or leave, the Head Master&#x27;s speech on St Barnabas&#x27; Day (the School&#x27;s Feast Day), sports reports, cultural reviews, artwork and essays (a selection of its highlights &#x27;Taylorian Analecta&#x27; is also published for alumni).
* Parvae Res is an online digital miscellany of video clips and picture galleries posted on the School&#x27;s website each term as a round-up of recent events in the life of the school. The name is a reference to the motto of the school and the Merchant Taylors&#x27; Company: Concordia Parvae Res Crescunt. The motto is taken from Sallust&#x27;s &quot;Bellum Jugurthinum&quot; (X.6) and appears on the school&#x27;s coat of arms. It figuratively means &quot;In harmony, small things grow&quot; (and is half of the full motto – Nam concordia parvae res crescunt, discordia maximae dilabuntur, which means &quot;For harmony makes small states great, while discord undermines the mightiest empires&quot; – the forerunner of the motto that renders it more colloquially into modern English as &#x27;unity is strength&#x27;).

Additionally, there are magazines produced by the students themselves. &quot;The Dependent&quot; is a termly publication with a satirical bent, largely focused on school life, &quot;Tech &#x27;N&#x27; Mech&quot; is a magazine written by pupils of all ages about technology, mechanics and science, and &#x27;Pulse&#x27; is the younger pupils&#x27; magazine of creative writing and journalistic comment.

=== Prefect body ===
The school prefect body, known as the JCR, is composed of members from the Upper Sixth Form and is divided into two groups: monitors (referred to as &quot;the table&quot;) and prompters (&quot;the bench&quot;). Monitors serve as head prefects and typically number around 11, though this can fluctuate depending on the school&#x27;s needs, such as during major events. They are led by the head monitor, who is supported by two second monitors and a senior monitor. The remaining members of the JCR, the prompters, number approximately 40 and are responsible for maintaining order within the school.

Although the powers and responsibilities of the JCR have diminished over recent decades, its members still enjoy certain privileges. For example, all JCR members are permitted to wear pinstriped shirts and jackets with silver buttons, while monitors are distinguished by gold-buttoned suits, with the style selected by committee.

Additionally, each house appoints a number of house prefects, chosen by the head of house. These prefects play a key role in organizing house events and competitions within the school.

===Merchant Taylors&#x27; Prep School===
Merchant Taylors&#x27; Prep is Merchant Taylors&#x27; preparatory school for boys aged 3–13. It was originally called Northwood Prep School, but merged into Merchant Taylors&#x27; in 2015. Pupils from Merchant Taylors&#x27; Prep do not currently have to sit the entrance exams to enter MTS. Merchant Taylors&#x27; Prep also has many sister programs with Merchant Taylors&#x27;, through which they also share grounds, and occasional staff swaps. It also should be noted that students at Merchant Taylors&#x27; Prep join with the main school in year 9 (alongside the 13+ cohort), as opposed to joining with the 11+ cohort in year 7. Equally, students who join with the 11+ cohort tend to go to the main school rather than the prep school.

=== Houses ===

There are eight houses at Merchant Taylors&#x27; School. The Manor of the Rose takes its name from the original school buildings in Suffolk Lane in the City of London. It was the boarding house from 1933 to 2000. Recently the name of Clive was changed to Raphael as a result of the George Floyd protests, due to Clive&#x27;s involvement with the “foundation of the Empire”.

=== Forms and jargon ===

Merchant Taylors&#x27; uses a unique method in the naming of the form groups:

The school&#x27;s jargon links back to its foundation:
* The Lun – Tuck Shop
* The Quarter – Break Period (20 mins)
* The Hour – Midday break in which clubs are held (~50 mins)
* Trials – Internal Examinations
* The Table – Monitors
* The Bench – Prompters
*Beak – Teacher (no longer in common use)

=== Sport ===

The school has produced a number of sportsmen in cricket, rugby and other sports. For a listing of rugby internationals, see Old Merchant Taylors&#x27; FC. 

==== Cricket ground ====

The first match recorded as having been played on the school&#x27;s cricket ground was between the Norwood Club and the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1892. County Second XI cricket was first played there in 2002 when the Middlesex Second XI played the Kent Second XI.

The ground hosted its inaugural first-class match in 2012 when Middlesex played Durham MCCU, with the match ending in a draw. Middlesex&#x27;s Sam Robson scored the first century at the ground. The ground was recently picked as a training ground for the Australian cricket team, and in 2018 the Indian cricket team, used the ground before playing in London.

<text>St Paul&#x27;s School is a selective independent day school (with limited boarding) for boys aged 13–18, founded in 1509 by John Colet and located on a 43-acre site by the Thames in London.

St Paul&#x27;s was one of nine English public schools investigated by the Clarendon Commission, which subsequently became known as the Clarendon schools. However, the school successfully argued that it was a private school and consequently was omitted from the Public Schools Act 1868, as was Merchant Taylors&#x27;, the other day school within the scope of Lord Clarendon&#x27;s terms of reference. Since 1881, St Paul&#x27;s has had its own preparatory school, St Paul&#x27;s Juniors (formerly Colet Court), which since 1968 has been located on the same site.

The school is included in The Schools Index as one of the world&#x27;s 150 best private schools and among top 30 UK senior schools.

==History==

St Paul&#x27;s School takes its name from St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London. A cathedral school is recorded as early as 1103, though it had declined by the early 16th century. In 1509, John Colet, Dean of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, established a new school on land north of the cathedral.
The eldest son of Sir Henry Colet (a member of the Mercers&#x27; Company and twice Lord Mayor of the City of London), John Colet inherited a substantial fortune and used a great part of it for the endowment of his school, having no family of his own; his 21 brothers and sisters all died in childhood and he was a celibate priest. He wrote in the school&#x27;s statutes that his aim was &quot;desyring nothing more thanne Educacion and bringing upp chyldren in good Maners and litterature.&quot;
Originally, the school admitted 153 boys of &quot;all nacions and countries indifferently&quot;, focusing on literature and etiquette. The number 153 relates to the miraculous draught of fishes recorded in the Gospel of John; the school still awards Junior Scholars a silver-fish emblem. At its foundation, St Paul&#x27;s had a High Master earning a mark per week—twice the Eton headmaster&#x27;s pay. The scholars were not required to make any payment, although they were required to be literate and had to pay for their own wax candles, which at that time were an expensive commodity.

Colet was an outspoken critic of the powerful and worldly Church of his day, and a friend of both Erasmus and Sir Thomas More. Erasmus wrote textbooks for the school and St Paul&#x27;s was the first English school to teach Greek, reflecting the humanist interests of the founder. Colet distrusted the Church as a managing body for his school, declaring that he &quot;found the least corruption&quot; in married laymen. For this reason, Colet assigned the management of the School and its revenues to the Mercers&#x27; Company, the premier livery company in the City of London, with which his father had been associated. In 1876 the company was legally established as trustee of the Colet estate, and the management of the school was assigned to a Board of Governors consisting of the Master, Wardens and nine members of the company, together with three representatives from each of the Universities of Oxford, Cambridge and London. The Mercers&#x27; Company still forms the major part of the School&#x27;s governing body, and it continues to administer Colet&#x27;s trust.

One of the early headmasters was Richard Mulcaster, famous for writing two influential treatises on education (Positions, in 1581, and Elementarie in 1582). His description in Positions of &quot;footeball&quot; as a refereed team sport is the earliest reference to organised modern football. For this description and his enthusiasm for the sport he is considered the father of modern football.

Between 1861 and 1864, the Clarendon Commission (a Royal Commission) investigated the public school system in England and its report formed the basis of the Public Schools Act 1868. St Paul&#x27;s was one of only nine schools considered by the Clarendon Commission, and one of only two schools which was not predominantly attended by boarders (the other day school was Merchant Taylors&#x27;).

According to Charles Dickens Jr., writing in 1879
By comparison, in 2016 &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that families earning up to £120,000 could still receive bursaries, after the headmaster remarked that fees had become &quot;unaffordable&quot;.

===Apposition===
An annual ceremony known as Apposition was originally the means by which The Mercers&#x27; Company could assess and, if necessary, dismiss teachers or the High Master. The process involved a third-party &quot;apposer&quot; who judged teaching quality by examining final-year pupils&#x27; lectures. 

Historically, the ceremony had real power. In 1559 High Master Thomas Freeman was dismissed, supposedly for lack of learning—although more probably for holding the incorrect religious views. In 1748, High Master Charles was removed after allegedly threatening to &quot;pull the Surmaster by the nose and kick him about the school&quot;.

Since it was re-introduced in 1969, Apposition has become largely ceremonial, instead serving as a prize-giving event for boys in the final two years of the school.

==Buildings==
===City of London===

The original school, which stood in St Paul&#x27;s Churchyard, was destroyed with the Cathedral in the Great Fire of London in 1666. 

===Hammersmith===

In 1884 a new building designed by the architect Alfred Waterhouse rose to dominate the countryside of Hammersmith. The terracotta for the Hammersmith school was made by the famous Gibbs and Canning of Tamworth. At this time the street numbering was changed locally and so the school address, whether by accident or design, became 153 Hammersmith Road. The preparatory school, Colet Court, was soon afterwards housed in new premises in a similar style on the opposite side of the road.

In September 1939 the school was evacuated to Easthampstead Park, near Crowthorne in Berkshire, where, under the then High Master, W. F. Oakeshott, it became solely a boarding school for the period of the war. Playing fields and some other facilities were borrowed from nearby Wellington College, but the boys and the teachers from the two schools remained entirely separate.

In the meantime, the London buildings became the headquarters of the Home Forces in July 1940 and the headquarters of the XXI Army Group under the command of General, later Field-Marshal, Bernard Montgomery, himself an Old Pauline, in July 1943. There the XXI army part of the military side of the invasion of Europe was planned, including the D-Day landings. The map that he used is still present in the modern day site of the school in the Montgomery Room. The school recovered its buildings in September 1945, and resumed life essentially as a day school, although it retains a small number of boarders to this day. In 1959, Queen Elizabeth II visited the school to mark the 450th anniversary of its founding. Upon her death, BBC journalist John Simpson, a pupil at the time, was most complimentary, saying that &quot;we were all just bowled over by it [the visit]&quot;.

In 1968, St Paul&#x27;s School was relocated across the river to Barnes and main school buildings were demolished. Today, the boundary wall and railings, small circular Bothy (garden store), High Master&#x27;s Lodge (now St Paul&#x27;s Hotel) and Porter&#x27;s Lodge are all that remain of the site and are Grade II listed. The main buildings were demolished and converted into St Paul&#x27;s Gardens.

===Barnes===

By 1961 it had become evident that the old school buildings were unsuited to modern educational needs. The opportunity arose to rebuild the school on a 45-acre (182,000 m²) riverside site at Barnes, adjacent to Hammersmith Bridge. This land had previously been the site of reservoirs which were filled in with earth excavated during the construction of the Victoria line.

In the 1970s, West London College was built on of former playing fields of St Paul&#x27;s, despite campaigns opposing the development. 

==2009–present day==
The school has recently opened its Science wing. The wing is a four-storey building finished in February 2013, built to give university standard of work spaces and labs. The school now has its own scanning electron microscope along with the new science building. 

A large number of music concerts, art exhibitions and plays take place each year, and pupils regularly receive national recognition for their achievements. The school also has a strong sports department; St Paul&#x27;s was a founding member of the Rugby Football Union in 1871 and was pre-eminent in public school boxing, its first team failing to win only two boxing matches against first team boxers from other schools over a period of 25 years; however, boxing was discontinued as a school sport in the 1960s. More recently, the school teams were runners-up in the rugby U15 Daily Mail Cup in 2005 and in 2007. The school has a strong record in rugby. In 1979, the 1st XV of St Paul&#x27;s, nicknamed the &#x27;Invincibles&#x27;, went twelve matches undefeated. Big rivals for the school are RGS Guildford, King&#x27;s College School, Dulwich College, St John&#x27;s Leatherhead, Merchant Taylors&#x27;, Wellington and Eton.

=== Staff pay ===
St Paul&#x27;s ranks highest on the Sunday Times Private School Pay List, with nine staff members paid salaries exceeding £100,000 in the accounting period 2019-20. St Paul’s also had the highest individual earner, with one staff member earning between £330,000 and £339,000 from September 2019 to August 2020.

===Operation Winthorpe===
St Paul&#x27;s has been investigated by the Metropolitan Police for historic crimes of paedophilia so serious the investigation was given its own operational name, Operation Winthorpe. Since then school has reviewed and revised its safeguarding procedures.
A major independent report published in January 2020, revealed 80 complaints against 32 members of staff over a period of six decades, mainly from the 1960s to the 1990s. There were 28 recommendations on how current practice could be improved.

===Renewal campaign===

The renewal campaign is the project to rebuild the entire school campus, frequently known as the Masterplan.

The majority of the current buildings date from the 1960s, and the CLASP technology used in the construction of the buildings has a limited lifespan. Even though over the last few years various buildings (such as the Wathen Hall Music School, Rackets Court and Milton Building) have been added on the campus wherever space was available, the dated buildings represent approximately three quarters of the school.

Local planning restrictions combined with a lack of available surplus land mean that St Paul&#x27;s is faced with progressively replacing obsolete buildings with new ones located in the same general area. The plan should eventually result in a large building footprint area increase as well as increasing the amount of staff housing. The number of car parking spaces will be reduced, but there will be much more available room for bicycles.

In 2007, Nicholas Hare Architects were appointed to produce detailed designs for the first set of new buildings. Late in 2009, Richmond Council granted St Paul&#x27;s detailed planning permission, and building started in 2011.

==Sporting successes==
===Rugby===
In 2007, St Paul&#x27;s recorded their most notable result in the sport when they reached the final of the U15 Daily Mail Cup, the premier rugby union tournament for British secondary schools. The team was coached by Richard Girvan, Surmaster from 2012 to 2020. St Paul&#x27;s lost the game played at Twickenham Stadium 20-15 to Lymm High School.

===Rowing===
The St Paul&#x27;s School Boat Club (SPSBC) has won the Princess Elizabeth Challenge Cup at Henley Royal Regatta seven times. In 2018 the SPSBC 1st VIII achieved unprecedented success, winning the &quot;triple crown&quot; of schoolboy rowing with record breaking wins in the Princess Elizabeth Challenge Cup and the School&#x27;s Head of the River, plus victory at the National Schools&#x27; Regatta in the Queen Mother&#x27;s Challenge Cup; they also won the Men&#x27;s Youth Eights at Head of the Charles in a record time and recorded the fastest time in history by any schoolboy crew over 2k of 5:36.59 at Marlow Regatta. Members of the crew also won the Pairs Head, Sculler&#x27;s Head &amp; Fours Head and all eligible members of the crew won gold medals at the World Junior Rowing Championships that year. In 2024 the SPSBC 1st 8+ took home gold at the Head of the Charles Regatta, Schools&#x27; Head of the River Race and National Schools&#x27; Regatta and won the Princess Elizabeth Challenge Cup at Henley Royal Regatta.

==Examinations==
In 2008, for the first time, its students sat the IGCSE exam instead of the GCSE in Science, following sitting IGCSE in Mathematics the previous year. The school does not currently offer the International Baccalaureate as an alternative to A Level, and has suffered on many league tables as a result. Martin Stephen, former High Master of St Paul&#x27;s, has stated he believes that &quot;league tables put massive pressure on headmasters to do bad things&quot; and announced that St Paul&#x27;s will be joining other private schools in London in withdrawing from the ISC&#x27;s 2008 league tables.

The school record for students gaining places at Oxford or Cambridge was 74 pupils in 2010, representing 42% of the year group. In the same year, a record 53.5% of A Level entries were graded at A*, with 93.5% of grades at A* or A and 99.4% at or above a B. According to more recent data, pupils starting university in 2016 numbered 189. Of those starting in the UK in 2016, 95% went on to Russell Group universities, with 53 entering Oxford or Cambridge. The highest ever number of pupils (34) chose to study in America, at Ivy League or equivalent schools. In 2017, 72 pupils were made offers by Oxford or Cambridge, with 40 offers for Oxford and 32 for Cambridge. In addition, 40 pupils received offers from North American universities, with no fewer than five securing places at Yale. A further three offers were made each by Princeton and Columbia.

The school had its first student attain a place on the Prime Minister&#x27;s Global Fellowship programme in 2009.

The school also has its first student win the national competition of IFS Young Business Writer of the Year 2010 Award, an award for the top young business thinker.

<doc id="188965" wikidata="Q126658" url="?curid=188965" title="National anthem of Austria">
<text>The National Anthem of Austria (), also known by its incipit &quot;&quot; (; &#x27;Land of the Peaks, Land by the Stream&#x27;), was adopted in 1946. The melody, originally attributed to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, was matched with a text by Paula von Preradović the following year.

The composer of the song remains disputed among various composers today and has been attributed to either or Paul Wranitzky.

==History==
Nineteen days before his death on 5 December 1791, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart composed his last complete work, the &quot;Freimaurerkantate&quot;, K.623. In parts of the printed edition of this cantata there appeared the song K. 623a &quot;&quot; (&quot;Let us with joined hands&quot;). To this melody the Austrian national anthem is sung. Today, Mozart&#x27;s authorship is regarded as dubious and the song is attributed to (either solely or co-authored with Mozart) or Paul Wranitzky. 

Before the World War II Anschluss, Austria&#x27;s state anthem was &quot;, set to the tune of Haydn&#x27;s &quot;, the state anthem of imperial Austria since 1797. The current German national anthem &quot;&quot; uses the same tune, but with different words (it was also the co-national anthem of Germany during National Socialist rule). To avoid the association, and because singing it was banned for a time after the war, a new state anthem was created. The lyrics were written by Paula von Preradović, one of the few women to have written lyrics for a national anthem. On 22 October 1946, the song was officially declared Austria&#x27;s national anthem, albeit without words. Lyrics were added in February 1947. On 1 January 2012, parts of the lyrics were changed to make the composition gender-neutral.

===Attempts at gender-neutral language===
Since the 1990s, several attempts have been made to modify the lyrics to use more gender-neutral language. In 2005, Women&#x27;s Minister Maria Rauch-Kallat of the Austrian People&#x27;s Party (ÖVP) stated her objection to the words &quot;sons&quot;, &quot;fraternal&quot; and &quot;fatherland&quot; in the lyrics and proposed changes. Her proposal met strong resistance by Austria&#x27;s largest newspaper, the &quot;Kronen Zeitung&quot;, and failed to gain support from the then coalition partner, the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ).

In January 2010, Austrian pop singer Christina Stürmer presented a pop rock version of the hymn &quot;Heimat bist du großer Söhne &quot; (&#x27;Thou art home to great sons &#x27;) as part of a campaign by the Austrian federal ministry of education. She was sued for violation of copyright by the estate of Paula von Preradović but subsequently cleared by the Austrian Supreme Court of Justice who called it &quot;a mere modernisation&quot; and allowed the version to stand.

Since 1 January 2012, a few words in the state anthem are different from before. The text and notes of the state anthem were officially codified in the Federal Act of the National Anthem of the Republic of Austria.

==Lyrics==
Only the first verse is considered official and performed during official events.


===Slovene verse===
A Slovene-language version of the third verse was written for the Carinthian Slovenes of Carinthia. It was translated from the pre-2012 German version of the third verse.

:Hrabro v novi čas stopimo,
:prosto, verno, glej, hodimo;
:upa polni, delavni.
:Bratski zbor prisega hkrati,
:domovini zvestobo dati.
:𝄆 Ljubljena nam Avstrija. 𝄇

==Parodies==
===Otto and Fritz Molden===
The same evening after von Preradović learned that her lyrics were chosen for the national anthem, her sons Otto and composed a satirical version of them.
&lt;poem style=&quot;float:left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:1em; float:left;&quot;&gt;Land of the peas, land of the beans,
Land of the four zones of occupation,
we sell thee on the black market!
And up there over the Hermannskogel
gladly the federal bird flutters.
Much beloved Austria!&lt;/poem&gt;

According to media researcher , the first two of these lines were popular in the schools of Vienna in 1955.

===Drahdiwaberl===
In 1979, the music group released their parody of &quot;Land der Berge, Land am Strone&quot;, titled &quot;Kaiserhymne / Pink Punk Shirt&quot;. The following text is modeled after von Preradović&#x27;s lyrics and sung to the same tune.

&lt;poem style=&quot;float:left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:1em; float:left;&quot;&gt;Land of the fields, land of holy place
Land on the river without atoms,
Land of titles and diplomas

Home thou art of great sons
Home thou art of great daughters
Additional verse from feminists

Land of the impossibly limited,
Land of the peaks, the most beautiful,
Land of lakes and the Lipizzans,
The Prohaskas and the Klammer

Land of the crown, land of the Staberl
Land of the Drahdiwaberl group.&lt;/poem&gt;

===Rotzpipn===
In 2012, the Viennese band Rotzpipn won the 9th protest song contest with their &quot;Hymne 2.0&quot;. The jury included Ernst Molden, grandson of Paula von Preradović, who gave the group the highest score.

<text>Shrewsbury School is a public school in Shrewsbury.

Founded in 1552 by Edward VI by royal charter, to replace the town&#x27;s Saxon collegiate foundations which were disestablished in the sixteenth century, Shrewsbury School is one of the seven public schools subject to the Public Schools Act 1868 and one of the nine schools reviewed by the Clarendon Commission between 1861 and 1864.

It was originally a boarding school for boys, girls have been admitted into the Sixth Form since 2008, and the school has been co-educational since 2015. As of Michaelmas Term 2023, the school has 842 pupils: 522 boys and 320 girls. There are seven boys&#x27; houses and five girls&#x27; houses.

The present site, to which the school moved in 1882, is on the south bank of the River Severn.

==History==

=== Circumstances of the foundation ===
Since Saxon times the Collegiate Churches of 
*St Chad (traditionally founded in Shrewsbury when it was known as Pengwern, either by the royal family of the Kingdom of Powys in the 6th century, or by Offa, king of Mercia in the 8th century);
*St Mary (established by King Edgar in the 10th century); and
*St Alkmund (founded by Queen Æthelflæd before 918AD; endowed as a collage by 975 by King Edgar, though reduced in the mid 12th century)
were providing education in the town, complemented by the foundation of Shrewsbury Abbey in the 11th century.

These were broken up by the Reformation, although there is a mention of a grammar school at Shrewsbury in a court case of 1439.

Shrewsbury School was founded in response to those interruptions to the town&#x27;s ancient traditions in education in the sixteenth century: the disruption caused significant local ill feeling, and by 1542, townspeople were beginning to petition Henry VIII for remedy. They devised a scheme hoping to use the proceeds from the dissolution of Shrewsbury Abbey for a renewed provision of education. They were not immediately successful. 
The statesman Sir Rowland Hill (who published the Geneva Bible and is reputed to be the inspiration for the hero of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;As You Like It&quot; of the same name, had the grant of certain of the abbey&#x27;s holdings and was involved in the founding petitions.

Also involved in the founding petitions was Reginald Corbet (who married Hill&#x27;s heiress, Alice Gratewood), a justice of the peace for Shropshire and commissioner for chantries in the county, who was paid ten shillings in 1548 &quot;for a supplication exhibited to the Lord Chancellor to obtain a free school.&quot; Significantly, there was also a receipt for 20 pence to bribe the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s servant to win his ear.

=== Foundation and early years ===
Shrewsbury School was founded by charter granted by King Edward VI on 10 February 1552.

The school began operation in a house and land purchased from John Proude in 1551, together with three rented half-timbered buildings, which included Riggs Hall, built in 1450. These are now the only remaining part of the original buildings occupied by the institution. Archaeological excavations of the sites of these first buildings in 1978 revealed finds going back to the Saxon period, along with relics of the school, now in the town collections.

The early curriculum was based on Continental Calvinism under its foundational headmaster, Thomas Ashton (appointed 1562). Prior to his appointment a special license had been obtained from Mathew Parker, Elizabeth I&#x27;s first Archbishop of Canterbury, on the grounds that Ashton not being available would damage the progress of the school&#x27;s foundation. Ashton was a contemporary of Roger Ascham at St John&#x27;s, Cambridge: Ascham was a writer on theories of education and served in the administrations of Edward VI, Mary I, and Elizabeth I, having earlier acted as Elizabeth&#x27;s tutor in Greek and Latin between 1548 and 1550.

Early pupils were taught the catechism of Calvin. The school attracted large numbers of pupils from Protestant families in Shropshire, North Wales and beyond, with 266 boys on its roll at the end of 1562.

Early pupils lodged with local families. For example, Sir Philip Sidney (who had a well-known correspondence with his father about his schooling) lodged in the castle ward with George Leigh, who had been Member of Parliament for Shrewsbury. In this period Elizabeth I&#x27;s favourite Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester also visited the school to see his nephew Thomas Sidney and attended a service at St Mary&#x27;s Church.

Sidney attended the school along with his lifelong friend Fulke Greville (later Lord Brooke), The literary output of these school-day associations became significant: in 1579 Francis Bacon joined their circle, which also included Mary Sidney (Philip&#x27;s brother, by then Countess of Pembroke).

Ashton resigned his headmastership in 1568. From 1571, Ashton was in the service of Walter Devereux, 1st Earl of Essex, was involved in the education of his son the 2nd Earl, and was employed in confidential communications with Queen Elizabeth I and the Privy Council.

Having achieved a reputation for excellence under Ashton, in 1571 the school was augmented by Elizabeth I. By 1581, the school had 360 pupils, and it was described by William Camden in 1582 as &quot;the best filled [school] in all England&quot;; the population of the town grew by about 5% when the boarders returned during term time during this period. In 1585 the schoolboys stood in battle array with bows and arrows by the castle gates when the Earl of Essex entered the town.

In 1578 Ashton returned to Shrewsbury, where he had been ordered by an indenture of Elizabeth I to set out the ordinances governing the school, which were in force until 1798. Under these regulations, the borough bailiffs (mayors after 1638) had the power to appoint masters, with Ashton&#x27;s old St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge having an academic veto. Shrewsbury has retained links with the college, with the continued appointment of Johnian academics to the Governing Body, and the historic awarding of &quot;closed&quot; Shrewsbury Exhibitions.

Scholars from the school were from time to time employed by the local community to draw and witness bonds for illiterate tradesmen in this period; for instance Richard Langley (whose father, a prosperous tailor, had purchased the Shrewsbury Abbey site after the dissolution) could remember being asked by a cooper in 1556 to witness a bond &quot;at what time he was a scholar in the free school of Shrewsbury&quot; aged about fifteen.

=== 1600s ===
In 1608 the town and the school were in fierce dispute about who should be appointed second master. The headmaster, John Meighen, wished to promote the third master, Ralph Gittins; the town wished to appoint Simon Moston on the recommendation of St John&#x27;s College, whose fellows had a say in the appointment of new masters. When the town&#x27;s bailiffs came to install their preferred candidate on 31 August 1608, the building had already been occupied by about 60 women from the town (including three spinsters, two widows, the wives of mercers, tailors, weavers, butchers, shoemakers, tanners, glovers, carpenters and coopers) taking the headmaster&#x27;s side and preferring Gittins on the basis that only the son of a burgess could serve as second master. Jamming the school benches against the doors, they barricaded themselves in the school until the following Saturday, passing a &quot;great hammer&quot; between themselves which had been used to gain entry to the school. The authorities sought to read the Statute on Rebellion, but the women made such a noise nobody could hear it. The incident provoked a mass of litigation in the courts of Chancery and Star Chamber in Westminster.

A house (today called Stone Grange) was built for the school in 1617 in the nearby village of Grinshill as a retreat in times of plague.

The stone buildings on Castle Gates, including a chapel, dormitories, library and classrooms, were completed by 1630, with Ashton&#x27;s successor, John Meighen, founding a chained library in 1606, though the library had begun making acquisitions by 1596, with a terrestrial globe by the first English globe maker Emery Molineux being its first acquisition. The bookcases in the library (with the books chained to them) projected from the walls between the windows on both sides of the room forming alcoves for study: an arrangement that may still be seen in Duke Humphrey&#x27;s Library in Oxford. The completion of this room was celebrated by the masters and Bailiffs on 1 October 1612 by taking cake and wine in the new space.

==== Civil War ====
Shrewsbury was occupied on behalf of the King during the Civil War, who briefly made the town his capital from September 1642. A council of war was appointed for the whole district, of which Lord Capel was president. This council held its meetings in the school library, and some of the school&#x27;s books were damaged during this time.

Around September 1642 a contentious &quot;Royal Loan&quot; was made to Charles I of £600 (around 75% of the money in the school exchequer at the time); a further £47 was lent to the corporation of the town. The loan was acknowledged under seal by the king in the following terms: Charles Rex

Trusty and well beloved we greet you well. Whereas ye have, out of your good affection to our present service and towards the supply of our extraordinary occasions, lent unto us the sum of £600, being a stock belonging to your school founded by our royal predecessor King Edward the Sixth, in this our Town of Shrewsbury. We do hereby promise that we shall cause the same to be truly repaid unto you whensoever ye shall demand the same, and shall always remember the loan of it as a very acceptable service unto us. Given under our Signet at our Court at Shrewsbury this nth of October, 1642.

To our trusty and well beloved Richard Gibbons, late Mayor of our Town of Shrewsbury, and Thomas Chaloner, Schoolmaster of our Free School there.This was considered a misappropriation of the school&#x27;s funds. This was litigated in the Court of Chancery and before the Lords Commissioners of the Great Seal by the corporation of the town after the end of the civil war. The record of the royal loan appeared in the school register at the time of the November audit of 1642, but was torn out by the time the matter was before the courts. The borrowed funds were never recovered.

During the Commonwealth period following the execution of Charles I, Richard Baxter suggested the establishment of a university to serve Wales at Shrewsbury, using the school&#x27;s premises, but due to lack of financial provision it came to nothing. Had that scheme come to fruition the town of Shrewsbury would have the third oldest university in England behind Oxford and Cambridge.

==== Restoration and 1700s ====
The history of the school between 1664 and 1798 is not easily available, as the registers and papers between these periods have been lost for many years. Nevertheless, diplomat Richard Hill, Baron Digby Governor of King&#x27;s County in Ireland, Robert Price, Justice of the Court of Common Pleas, poet and politician Arthur Maynwaring and Thomas Bowers, Bishop of Chichester, attended the school at this time.

Celia Fiennes visited the school in 1698 and recorded the school as follows: &quot;Here are three free schooles together, built of free stone, 3 Large roomes to teach the Children, wth severall masters. Ye first has 150£ a year ye second 100 ye third 50£ a year and teach Children from reading English till fit for ye University, and its free for Children not only of ye town but for all over England if they Exceed not ye numbers... &quot;.

In the early eighteenth century, Daniel Defoe also visited the school, noting: &quot;Here is a good Free-school, the most considerable in this Part of England; founded by King Edward VI and endowed by Queen Elizabeth, with a very sufficient Maintenance for a Chief or Headmaster, and three Under-masters or Ushers. The Buildings, which are of Stone, are very spacious, particularly the Library, which has a great many Books in it. The School-masters have also very handsome Houses to dwell in; for that the Whole has the Face of a College.&quot;

A wing was added to the buildings on the original site during the Georgian period, connected to Rigg&#x27;s Hall and spanning the old town wall. Although this building was listed at grade two it was demolished around 100 years after the school had vacated the building when Shropshire County Council, who operated the buildings as a public library were engaged in major restorations works in the 1980s because the structure was by then unsound.
In 1798, a specific act of Parliament, the (38 Geo. 3. c. lxviii), was passed for the better government of the school. The act contains an oath to be taken by the governors, and confirmed Lord Chancellor as visitor (as for all Royal foundations).

This statutory scheme was later amended by the Court of Chancery, in 1853.

=== 1800s ===
The school had just three headmasters during the 19th century.

Samuel Butler was appointed headmaster in 1798. Writing at this time he observed: &quot;This school was once the Eton or the Westminster of Wales and all Shropshire&quot;, and under his leadership the school&#x27;s reputation, which had receded from the Civil War, again grew. In 1839 an incident known as the &quot;Boiled Beef Row&quot; took place, where the boys walked out of the school in protest at the food, and the praepostors were all removed from office. In this period (1818–1825) Charles Darwin attended the school.

Butler was succeeded by his pupil Benjamin Hall Kennedy (of &quot;Latin Primer&quot; fame) in 1836, who in turn gave way to Henry Whitehead Moss in 1866.

The school&#x27;s original Castle Gates premises had little in way of provision for games. Under Dr Butler, there were two fives courts and playgrounds in front of and behind the buildings, but after the arrival of Dr Kennedy football was permitted, for which the school acquired a ground in Coton Hill (north of Castle Gates).

Under Butler and Kennedy, Shrewsbury was one of three provincial schools among the nine studied by the Clarendon Commission of 1861–64 (the schools considered being Eton, Charterhouse, Harrow, Rugby, Westminster, and Winchester, and two day schools: St Paul&#x27;s and Merchant Taylors). Shrewsbury went on to be included in the Public Schools Act 1868, which ultimately related only to the boarding schools.

The school continued in the 1600s buildings on its original site, until it was relocated in 1882, when Moss moved the school from its original town centre location to a new site of in Kingsland (an area of land which at one time belonged to the Crown and granted to the Corporation at &quot;a rather remote period, the exact date of which appears not to be known&quot;, but apparently before 1180), on the south bank of the River Severn overlooking the town. A legacy of this move can be seen in the school premises being referred to as &quot;The Site&quot;.

In the later Renaissance, this land had been devoted to elaborate performances, with grand arbours being built by the guilds. Some of the arbours survive, such as the for the Shoemakers (now in the Quarry Park).

The school was relocated in the current Main School Building which dates from 1765 and had at different times housed a foundling hospital and the Shrewsbury workhouse, before translating to this current use. In order to meet this new purpose, it was remodelled by Sir Arthur Blomfield (whose other educational commissions include Marlborough College and Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford).

At this time, the original premises were converted to a public Free Library and Museum by the Shrewsbury Borough Council, opening in their new role in 1885; over the course of the 20th century the library purpose gradually took over the whole building, to which major restoration was done in 1983.

Blomfield also designed School House, to the east of the Main School building which was constructed during the 1880s. The new Riggs Hall (which had existed from Tudor buildings at the old site) was also built at this time, as was Churchill&#x27;s Hall and Moser&#x27;s Hall: these buildings are the work of William White.

A gothic chapel was built for the school (also by Blomfield) in 1887, though it has been noted that &quot;Christian religion played only a very small part in the life of the Public Schools... [and] at Shrewsbury the Governors refused to allow Butler to address the school at a service&quot; prior to this increased focus in the Victorian period. Its south and east windows in the chapel are by Kempe, employing medieval narrative style for lives of saints, scenes from the history of the school.

Other buildings have since grown up around the edge of the site, with sports pitches in the centre, with diverse buildings being added to the new site over the last 130 years.

=== 1900s ===
The main school building suffered a major fire in 1905. Moss was succeeded in 1908 by Cyril Alington, then Master in College at Eton. Alington, though a Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, was a sportsman, evidenced by the 1914 appointment as his secretary of Neville Cardus, the future cricket journalist who had joined the school in 1912 as the school&#x27;s assistant cricket professional.

At the time of his appointment as Headmaster, Alington was younger than any of the masters on the staff, so to bring in new blood into the teaching staff, he recruited several former Collegers from Eton, most notably The Rev. Ronald Knox. Alington wrote the school song and commissioned its flag (a banner of arms of its coat of arms), and he was an energetic builder; the school Alington Hall (assembly hall) is named after him. In December 1914 he wrote a poem, &quot;To the School at War&quot;, which was published in &quot;The Times&quot;. After leaving Shrewsbury, Alington went on to serve as Chaplain to the King to King George V from 1921 until 1933, and then Dean of Durham, from 1933 to 1951. He appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine on 29 June 1931. &quot;An accomplished classicist, a witty writer especially of light verse, and a priest of orthodox convictions ...&quot;

During the Edwardian period Oldham&#x27;s Hall was built (1911).

==== First World War and afterwards ====
The First World War saw 321 former members of the school die serving their country. A war memorial was added to the school in 1923 for these fallen. This memorial was added to after the Second World War to include the 135 members of the school who fell in that conflict. The monument includes a statue of Sir Phillip Sidney, the Elizabeth soldier, poet and courtier (who himself was an alumnus of the school and died of wounds sustained at the Battle of Zutphen in 1586), and faces the Main School building down an avenue of linden trees, known as &#x27;central&#x27;.

The current library building was added in 1916.

Mountaineer Andrew Irvine, who, with George Mallory may have reached the summit of Mount Everest in the 1924 British Everest Expedition attended Shrewsbury during the First World War. During the 1920s the Georgian villa houses at Severn Hill and Ridgemount were acquired by the school and adapted into boarding houses. Severn Hill, the linear decedent of the house of which Irvine was captain, holds his ice axe from the expedition, discovered in 1933 by Wyn Harris.

==== Post Second World War ====
Between 1944 and 1950 John Wolfenden (later Lord Wolfenden) was headmaster; he left Shrewsbury to become Vice-Chancellor of the University of Reading. He was appointed to various public body chairmanships by the Privy Council, and also went on to be director of the British Museum. His name is closely associated with the 1957 Wolfenden Report, which he chaired.

In 1952, the school was 400 years old. It received a royal visit to mark the occasion, and presented the town with a new cross for the historic site of the town&#x27;s high cross (which had been removed in 1705) at the termination of the market street which was a starting point for civic and religious processions in the medieval town and a significant location (the place of execution of Earl of Worcester and others after the Battle of Shrewsbury in 1403, and of Dafydd III, last native Prince of Wales in 1283).

The future Deputy Prime Minister of the UK Michael Heseltine attended the school immediately after the Second World War on a scholarship. A number of the founders and writers of the satirical magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot; attended the school in the 1950s. Willy Rushton was also at the school at this time. The comedian, actor, writer and television presenter Michael Palin of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; attended the school shortly afterwards and a scholarship is now available named for him.

Between 1963 and 1975 Donald Wright served as headmaster. &quot;The Times&quot; has called Wright a &quot;great reforming headmaster&quot;. While there, working with the Anglican Diocese of Liverpool, Wright took a leading role in the building of a new Shrewsbury House, the school&#x27;s mission in Liverpool, which was opened in 1974 by Princess Anne. He secured many leading churchmen to come to preach in the school chapel, including Donald Coggan, Archbishop of Canterbury. After retiring as a headmaster in 1975, Wright became the Archbishop of Canterbury&#x27;s Patronage Secretary, chaired the William Temple Foundation, and served as Secretary to the Crown Appointments Commission.

In the 1960s, Kingsland House, another 19th century gentleman&#x27;s residence was acquired by the school and adapted for use for central catering for all pupils (previously food had been arranged in houses). A new science building was also added in the 1960s.

Sir Eric Anderson served as headmaster between 1975 and 1980. He went on to be Rector of Lincoln College, Oxford, chairman of the Heritage Lottery Fund and Provost of Eton, among other roles.

In 1988, another Georgian villa house, the Grove, was bought and adapted for use as boarding house. In 1996 a new IT building, the Craig Building, was added.

=== 2000s ===
Since the turn of the millennium, the school&#x27;s site has seen investment, beginning with the addition of a statue of alumnus Charles Darwin to the site to mark the millennium, which was unveiled by Sir David Attenborough.

A new music school, The Maidment Building, was opened by King Charles III (when Prince of Wales) in 2001.

Girls were admitted to the school for the first time into the sixth-form in 2008, and the school became fully coeducational in 2015.

Two new boarding houses have been built, one named after Mary Sidney (completed 2006), and one after Emma Darwin (completed 2011).

Further additions to the site have been made: an indoor cricket centre (2006) and a new swimming pool (2007); the rowing facilities were extended with a new Yale Boat house, which was opened by Olympian Matt Langridge in 2012; A new Computing and Design faculty building, &quot;the Chatri Design Centre&quot; was established in 2017, re-purposing and redeveloping a former humanities building; and in 2015 a new building, Hodgeson Hall, was built to house the humanities departments.

A new theatre was opened in 2022.

In 2023 a new boarding house was opened, named to honour Elizabeth II.

==Sports==
The main sport in the Michaelmas (autumn) term is football, in the Lent term fives and rugby, and in summer cricket. Rowing takes place in all three terms. The kit of many of the sports teams shows a cross pattée from the crown in the school&#x27;s coat of arms, which is a practice that has been in place for at least 150 years. During much of the twentieth century, this cross was used solely by the school&#x27;s boatclub.

Admission of girls in 2015 has seen the introduction of hockey and netball, with cricket and tennis played during the summer term.

The present school buildings in Kingsland are arranged around the sports fields which have nine grass football pitches, two Hockey Astroturf and a 4G artificial football pitch (completed in 2023); almost all boys play football in the Michaelmas term, with girls playing football in the Lent term.

=== Football ===
Football, as a formal game, was incubated at the public schools of the nineteenth century and Shrewsbury had a key role in the game&#x27;s development. Salopians were prominent in the early history of the organised game at Cambridge University, according to Adrian Harvey &quot;Salopians formed a club of their own in the late 1830s/early 1840s but that was presumably absorbed by the Cambridge University Football Club that they were so influential in creating in 1846&quot;. The school has an 1856 copy of the Cambridge rules of football, predating the 1863 rules of the FA.

In these early years, each of the schools had their own versions of the game, and by the 1830s the version played at Shrewsbury had become known as &quot;douling&quot;, taking this name from the Greek word for slave: the goal had no cross bar, favoured dribbling, and was being formally supported by the school&#x27;s authorities to the extent it was compulsory. While, at the beginning of the 18th century, however, the school authorities deemed football &quot;only fit for butchers boys&quot;, an attitude common at the other public schools, by the 1840s, all boarders were required to play Douling three times a week unless they were excused on medical grounds.

From 1853, the national press was publishing reports of football at the school, although at this time matches were predominantly between the various Houses. The school&#x27;s first captain of football was appointed in 1854, and a school team was formed in the early 1860s for external mataches. Also by the 1860s football was sufficiently well-established for all Houses to field 1st and 2nd XI sides across all age groups.

The Arthur Dunn Challenge Cup (annual football cup competition played between the Old Boys of public schools started in 1903) was contested by Shrewsbury and Charterhouse in the first ever final, and shared by the two institutions following two draws, with two Morgan-Owen brothers choosing instead to turn out for Shrewsbury, instead of playing internationally in a Wales vs. Ireland game for which they had been selected. Shrewsbury has won the Arthur Dunn Challenge Cup a total of 11 times, including the Centenary Cup Final in 2003, a replay of the first final in 1903. A club of Old Salopians attending the University of Cambridge, who had started playing association football in 1874, entered the FA Cup in 1875-76, but scratched when drawn away to Oxford University.

Shrewsbury has won the Independent Schools Football Association Boodles ISFA Cup twice: in 2000 and 2010.

In 2024, Shrewsbury School were crowned English Schools Football Association (ESFA) National Champions.

=== Rowing ===
The Royal Shrewsbury School Boat Club (RSSBC) is one of the oldest school rowing clubs, having begun as an unofficial sport frowned upon by the authorities, in the late 18th or early 19th century and the first official event being known to have happened in 1839, complete with military bands. The boat club was finally officially constituted in 1866.

Since the boat club began rowing at Henley Royal Regatta in 1912, they have won 14 times. Shrewsbury is only seconded in victories at Henley to Eton, having won specifically:

* Elsenham Cup: 1919
* Princess Elizabeth Challenge Cup: 1955, 1957, 1960, 1961, 2007
* Ladies’ Challenge Plate Winner: 1932
* Special Race for Schools/Fawley Challenge Cup: 1975,1976, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1984, 1985

Shrewsbury is one of only two public schools to have bumps races, the other being Eton, between the houses. They are rowed over four evenings at the end of term in July. There are usually three boats entered per house. On the fourth evening there are prizes for the leaders of the chart and the Leadbitter Cup for the boat which has made the most bumps over the four nights. The event is marshalled by senior rowers and rowing prefects, usually masters. The crew training is mainly pupil driven, though in preparation for Henley the school&#x27;s First VIII rowers often do not take part, and therefore the boats are composed of other rowers and some non-rowers. Previously, races were run every day until there were no more bumps (i.e. until they were nominally in speed order). This historical set-up could lead to weeks of racing and it was therefore abandoned in favour of a four-day version more than 100 years ago. Otherwise, it is only Oxford and Cambridge that continue to have bumps. Shrewsbury and Eton both race bumps in fours whilst Oxford and Cambridge race in eights.

The town&#x27;s rowing club, Pengwern Boat Club, has close historical links to the School&#x27;s rowing activities, and for a time they jointly rented a boat house at the site of the current Pengwern club house.

A former captain of the boat club, John Lander, is the only Olympic gold medallist to have been killed in action in World War 2. GB Olympic silver medalist Rebecca Romero, and Paralympian Becca Chin both recently been appointed to coach within the club.

=== Running ===
The Royal Shrewsbury School Hunt (RSSH or &quot;the Hunt&quot;) is the oldest cross-country club in the world, with written records (the Hound Books) going back to 1831 and evidence that it was established by 1819. The sport of &quot;the Hunt&quot; or &quot;the Hounds&quot;, now known as a Paper Chase, was formalised at the school around 1800. Two runners (the &quot;foxes&quot;) made a trail with paper shreds and after a set time they would be pursued by the other runners (the &quot;hounds&quot;). The club officers are the Huntsman and Senior and Junior Whips. The hounds start most races paired into &quot;couples&quot; as in real fox hunting; the winner of a race is said to &quot;kill&quot;. Certain of the races are started by the Huntsman, carrying a 200-year-old bugle and a ceremonial whip, dressed in scarlet shirt and a black velvet cap shouting:

All hounds who wish to run, run hard, run well, and may the devil take the hindmost

before lounging the bugle: and this has been done for nearly 200 years.

In his 1903 semi-autobiographical novel &quot;The Way of All Flesh&quot;, Old Salopian Samuel Butler describes a school based on Shrewsbury where the main protagonist&#x27;s favourite recreation is running with &quot;the Hounds&quot; so &quot;a run of six or seven miles across country was no more than he was used to&quot;. The first definite record of the Annual Steeplechase is in 1834, making it the oldest cross-country race of the modern era.

The main inter-house cross-country races are still called the Junior and Senior Paperchase, although no paper is dropped and urban development means the historical course can no longer be followed. Every October the whole school participates in a 3.5-mile run called &quot;The Tucks&quot;, originally intended to prevent pupils attending a local horse race. It is now run at Attingham Park.

The school also lays claim to the oldest track and field meeting still in existence, which originated in the Second Spring Meeting first documented in 1840. This featured a series of mock horse races including the Derby Stakes, the Hurdle Race, the Trial Stakes and a programme of throwing and jumping events, with runners being entered by &quot;owners&quot; and named as though they were horses.

=== Cricket ===
Cricket was being played at Shrewsbury at least as long ago as the 1860s. A reference was made to an effort to set up a game with Westminster School in 1866 (declined by Westminster) in a House of Commons debate by Jim Prior in 1961. Neville Cardus was the school&#x27;s cricket professional in the early twentieth century.

Boys&#x27; 1st XI season focuses on the Silk Trophy, which competed for by Shrewsbury, Eton, Oundle and an overseas touring side at the end of each summer term.

The school competes in the HMC Twenty20 having made the finals day each year since 2010, winning the competition in 2011 and 2013. The school won the Lord&#x27;s Taverners Trophy in 2005.

Old Salopians who have played county cricket include James Taylor, Scott Ellis, Nick Pocock, The Hon. Tim Lamb, Ian Hutchinson., Ed Barnard, Steve Leach, Ed Pollock, Dion Holden, Dave Lloyd, George Garrett and Issy Wong.

=== Eton Fives ===
Eton Fives is a major sport within the school, and there are 14 Fives courts. At the end of the Lent Term the school competes in the Marsh Insurance National Schools Eton Fives Championships, which are held in rotation at Shrewsbury, Highgate and Eton.

A world record was set at the school in 1989 for the longest ever game of fives (at 39 hours of playing); this was eclipsed by Uppingham School in 2019.

=== Minor sports ===
Minor sports include: shooting, fencing, basketball, golf, equestrian, badminton, swimming, hockey, rugby and squash.

== Performing arts ==

=== Heritage ===
==== Early flowerings of English drama in the Tudor period ====
Prior to the Reformation the site of the school as Kingsland was a focus of pageantry and performance.

By the early modern period that cultural practice had developed to the extent that multiple arbours were built over the territory.

Under Thomas Ashton drama flourished. He made it a rule that, boys in the senior form had, every school day, to &quot;declaim and play one Act of Comedy&quot; before breaking from school, and the school put on frequent public Whitsuntide and mystery plays concerned with moral romance, scripture, and history. In 1565, for instance, &quot;Julian the Apostle&quot; and another unnamed performance of Ashton&#x27;s were performed before a large audience, which &quot;listened with admiration and devotion&quot;. Queen Elizabeth I, on a journey to the West Midlands in 1565 intended to visit Shrewsbury to see one of these performances, but &quot;her Majesty not having proper information mistook the time and when she came to Coventry, hearing it was over, returned to London&quot;. The Quarry park in the town had long been a place for sort and cultural activity in the old town, and this was the site of many of these plays, and a bank there cut in the form of an amphitheatre was established near the rope walk. Such plays were, according to Thomas Warton, probably the first fruits of the English theater.

On several occasions the school put on pageants for the visiting Council of the Marches, as in 1581 when the Lord President, Sir Henry Sidney, leaving the town by barge, was greeted by several scholars on an island down stream of the castle dressed as green nymphs with willow branches tied to their heads reciting verses across the water: And will your honour needs depart, and must it needs be so.

Would God we could like fishes swim, that we might with thee go.The Lord President was brought close to tears.

===== Originating ballet and pantomime =====
John Weaver, the father of English ballet, and the originator of pantomime, was the master at the school in the 1600s. He was responsible for the codification of dance.

He documented courtly dances which were a feature of courtly ritual in the Tudor and Steward period, and were a sincere instrument of statecraft to the holders of public office in those times. In 2023 the school hosted the inaugural &quot;John Weaver Festival of Dance&quot;, which included competitive performance of the art, along with an exhibition, which displayed Weavers own papers and material from Soulton Hall relating to its historic dancing pavement.

== Culture ==
=== Philomath and Polymath ===
The original buildings and the present school library both have carved stone figures on the buildings. They represent, on the left Φιλομαθης Philomathes [he who loves learning] (a character first penned by King James I in philosophical dialogue known as &quot;Daemonologie&quot;) and on the right Πολυμαθης Polymathes [he who has much learning]. The first figure has taken his hat off to settle to learning; the second figure is about to place his hat back on, having attended to his studies.

The original carvings are from 1630 and are accompanied by a table which says:MDCXXX [1630]

ΔΙΔΑΣΚΑΛΕΙΟΝ

ΕΑΝ ΗΣ ΕΣΗThis is based on a quotation from Isocrates, &quot;ἐαν ἠς φιλομαθης, ἐσει πολυμαθης&quot;, which means &quot;If you are studious (loving learning), you will be(come) learned&quot;; Διδασκαλειον means &#x27;school&#x27;.

Although the school left the premises by the castle in 1882, it retained, significantly, the ownership of these statutes which remain in the Renaissance building.

=== Houses ===
The School, as of Michaelmas Term 2023, has 842 pupils.

There are seven boys&#x27; houses and five girls&#x27; houses, each with its own housemaster or housemistress, tutor team and matron. Each house also has its own colours.

The houses and their colours are:

A single house will hold around 70 pupils, School House slightly more. Having about 80 pupils, School House used to be divided into Doctors (black and white) and Headroom (magenta and white) for most sporting purposes, whilst being one house in other respects, but this distinction was abolished in around 2000.

There are many inter-house competitions: in football, for instance, each house competes in four different leagues (two senior, two junior) and three knock-out competitions (two senior, one junior).

=== School song ===
The school has its own song, &quot;Carmen Salopiense&quot;, written in 1916 by Cyril Alington who was Headmaster at the time.

=== Masque ===
To celebrate the 400-year anniversary of the school&#x27;s foundation, in 1952, a masque was written which set out the history, great figures, and values of the school.

Music was by John Ranald Stainer, OBE, FRCM, FRCO, Hon RAM, and the script was written by Paul Dehn OS (best known for the screenplays for &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, &quot;The Spy Who Came in from the Cold&quot;, the &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; sequels and &quot;Murder on the Orient Express)&quot;.

== Grants and prizes ==
The school awards a number of prizes, some of which have been running for many years; among these are:

*The Sidney Gold Medal, established 1838, is the top award Shrewsbury offers. It originally came with a purse of 50 sovereigns and was awarded to the top classicist going on to Oxbridge. The Trustees commissioned Sir Edward Thomason to cut the original die, and the image was based on a miniature painted by George Perfect Harding and owned by Dr Kennedy, now in the School collection. The medal was discontinued in 1855 when the stocks were exhausted, but was revived again in 1899. In 1980 the Salopian Club decided that the Medal should be open to all disciplines and not purely the Classics. Since that time the majority of recipients have excelled in the sciences.
*The Arand Haggar Prize, established 1890, original known as &quot;The Mathematics Prize&quot;, an almost unbroken run of the annual competition paper stretches back to 1890, making it one of the longest continually-run mathematics competitions in the country.
*The Bentley Elocution Prize, established 1867: candidates are required recite well a poem of at least sonnet length, introduced by Thomas Bentley, whose career at the School spanned more than 50 years. Past winners include Sir Michael Palin.
*Richard Hillary Essay Prize, established 2013, based on the single-word essay formula used for admission at All Souls College, Oxford.
*The Miles Clark Travel Award, established 1994, recipients of this award have, for instance, cycled around the world for over four years, cycled back to the UK from Siberia, and cycled by tandem from the north coast of Canada to Tierra del Fuego – a number of accounts of these travels have been published.

*King Charles III when Prince of Wales opened the new music school in 2001.

== Praepostors ==

The schools&#x27; prefects are known as præpostors. The word originally referred to a monastic prior and is late Latin of the Middle Ages, derived from classical Latin &quot;praepositus&quot;, &quot;placed before&quot;.The use of &quot;praepostor&quot; in the context of a school is derived from the practice of using older boys to lead or control the younger boys. Privileges associated with the office are a particular tie showing the school&#x27;s arms and the right to cycle a bike to lessons. Defining the role in 1821, Dr Butler wrote:&quot;A præpostor is one of the first eight boys to whom the master delegates a certain share of authority, in whom he reposes confidence, and whose business it is to keep the boys in order, to prevent all kinds of mischief and impropriety...&quot;

Its SR number was 921 and its BR number was 30921. It entered service in 1934 and it was withdrawn in 1962 from use on railways. A name plate (one of two) is preserved in the Admissions Offices/Registry of the school.

== Farm house ==
The school maintains a farmhouse at Talargerwyn in Snowdonia. This is used for outward-bound type activities and research trips.

== Foundation ==
In 1965 the school established &quot;The Foundation&quot;, which is one of the oldest school development offices in the country.

== Controversy ==
In September 2005, the school was one of fifty independent schools operating independent school fee-fixing, in breach of the Competition Act, 1998. All of the schools involved were ordered to abandon this practice, pay a nominal penalty of £10,000 each and to make ex-gratia payments totalling three million pounds into a trust designed to benefit pupils who attended the schools during the period in respect of which fee information had been shared.

<text>The afghani (sign: or Af (plural: Afs) code: AFN; ; ) is the official currency of Afghanistan, a status it has held since the 1920s. It is nominally subdivided into 100 &quot;puls&quot; (پول), although there are no pul coins in circulation these days. Printed in Poland, the afghani currency is managed solely by the nation&#x27;s central bank, Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB).

The afghani was introduced in 1923 but is still informally referred to as a &quot;rupee&quot; by some in conversation and transactions, a legacy of its predecessing Afghan rupee currency. Its current exchange rate is around 65 afghanis for 1 United States dollar.

==History==
===First Afghani (1923–2002)===


The original afghani (ISO 4217 code: AFA) was introduced in 1923 during the era of King Amanullah Khan, replacing the Afghan rupee that was used since 1891. In addition to being subdivided into 100 puls, 20 afghanis were equal to one &quot;amani&quot;. The rate of conversion from the rupee is sometimes quoted as 1 afghani = 1 rupee 6 paisas, based on the silver contents of the last rupee coins and the first afghani coins. The afghani initially contained 9 grams of silver. Alongside the new currency, the various units of weight used in Afghanistan were replaced by a single metric system.

Except during World War I, Afghanistan&#x27;s foreign exchange rate has been freely determined by market forces. However, for some periods, a dual exchange rate regime existed in Afghanistan: an official exchange rate which was fixed by the major banks in the country, and a free market exchange rate which was determined by the supply and demand forces in Kabul&#x27;s money bazaar called &quot;Saraye Shahzada&quot;. For example, in order to avoid the seasonal fluctuations in the exchange rate, a fixed exchange rate was adopted in 1935 by the Bank-e-Millie (National Bank), which was then responsible for the country&#x27;s exchange rate system and official reserves. Bank-e-Millie agreed to exchange afghani at Afs. 4 against 1 Indian rupee in 1935. After the establishment of Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB) as the central bank of Afghanistan, such a preferential official fixed exchange rate continued to be practiced. Although DAB tried to keep its official rate close to the Sarai Shahzada exchange rate, the gap between the official and free-market exchange rates widened in the 1980s and during the civil war thereafter.

The afghani traded at Afs. 67 to one US dollar in 1973. After the start of a civil war in 1992, the same US dollar bought Afs. 16,000. Banknotes from the period of Zahir Shah&#x27;s monarchy ceased to be legal tender by 1991. After the creation of a dysfunctional government and the start of the civil war, different warlords and factions, foreign powers and forgers each made their own afghani banknotes to support themselves financially, with no regard to standardization or honoring serial numbers.

In December 1996, shortly after the Taliban took control of Afghanistan&#x27;s institutions, Ehsanullah Ehsan, the chairman of the Taliban&#x27;s Central Bank, declared most afghani notes in circulation to be worthless (approximately 100 trillion Afghani) and cancelled the contract with the Russian firm that had been printing the currency since 1992. Ehsan accused the firm of sending new shipments of afghani notes to ousted President Burhanuddin Rabbani in northern Takhar province. The exchange rate at the time of Ehsan&#x27;s announcement was Afs. 21,000 to one US dollar. It was then devalued to Afs. 43,000 to the dollar. Abdul Rashid Dostum, who militarily controlled Jowzjan Province and nearby Uzbek villages, also printed his own money for a short time.

During late 2001 and early 2002, the currency became highly destabilized. The afghani traded at Afs. 73,000 per US$1 in September 2001, steeply soaring to Afs. 23,000 after the Taliban was replaced by a new government under Hamid Karzai in December 2001, before plunging again to Afs. 36,000 in January 2002. Around seven different versions of the currency were in circulation by that time. A former governor said at the time that maybe &quot;trillions&quot; of banknotes are in circulation as a result.

===Second Afghani (2002–present)===
In 2002, the afghani was redenominated, and it received a new ISO 4217 code AFN. No subdivisions were issued. It replaced the previous afghani at two distinct rates: issues of the government of former President Rabbani (&quot;de jure&quot; 1992–2001) were replaced at a rate of 1,000 to the new afghani, while the issues of Dostum (1992–1997 in northern Afghanistan) were replaced at a rate of 2,000 to the new afghani. It was created in an effort to stabilize the economy and stop the rapid inflation. The notes were printed in Germany.

The new currency was announced by President Karzai on 4 September 2002, and was introduced to the market on October 8, 2002. This monetary reform was well received by the public as it was a sign of security and stability, especially the country&#x27;s rebuilding effort. People also no longer had to carry many bags of money for ordinary things. It was the first time in many years that a sole currency was under the control of the central bank instead of warlords. Most old banknotes were destroyed by the end of 2002.

Da Afghanistan Bank has adopted a floating exchange rate regime and has let the exchange rate be determined freely by market forces. The new afghani was valued at Afs. 43 to one US dollar.

After depreciating during the last quarter of 2003/04, the afghani appreciated steadily, gaining 8 per cent against the US dollar between March 2004 and July 2004. This appreciation, at a time of increasing inflation, appears to reflect a greater willingness by the population to use the afghani as a medium of exchange and as a store of value. This trend appears to be attributable to the relative stability of the exchange rate since the introduction of the new currency, administrative measures aimed at promoting its use, such as the requirement that shopkeepers must price goods in afghani. Donors are increasingly making payments in afghanis instead of US dollars and this appears to be widely accepted. By 2009, the afghani was valued at Afs. 45 per one US dollar. In 2019, the afghani reached Afs. 75 to the US dollar.

After the 2021 re-establishment of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, the nation&#x27;s foreign assets were frozen. IMF blocked the release of $450 million in August. Subsequently, the value of the afghani fell. The Islamic Emirate has banned all foreign currencies to encourage use of the afghani as national tender. In the third quarter of 2023, the Afghani rose to be the best performing currency in the world, climbing over 9% against the US dollar.

==Coinage==
In 1952, aluminium 25 pul and nickel-clad steel 50 pul were introduced, followed by aluminium Afs. 2 and Afs. 5 in 1958. In 1961 nickel-clad steel Af. 1, Afs. 2 and Afs. 5 were minted; the Af. 1 and Afs. 2 coins show years of SH 1340 and the Afs. 5 coin shows the year AH 1381.

On 11 April 2005, coins were introduced in denominations of Af. 1, Afs. 2 and Afs. 5.

==Banknotes==
Between 1925 and 1928, Treasury notes were introduced in denominations of Afs. 5, Afs. 10 and Afs. 50. In 1936, Afs. 2, Afs. 20 and Afs. 100 notes were added. The Bank of Afghanistan (&quot;Da Afghanistan Bank&quot;) took over paper money production in 1939, issuing notes for Afs. 2, Afs. 5, Afs. 10, Afs. 20, Afs. 50, Afs. 100, Afs. 500 and Afs. 1,000. The Afs. 2 and Afs. 5 notes were replaced by coins in 1958. In 1993, Afs. 5,000 and Afs. 10,000 notes were introduced.

&quot;A &#x27;pothole cave&#x27; or &#x27;mouth of a shaft&#x27; (or Pit cave) is said to be visible on the Afs. 10,000 banknote from 1993 as a limited dark area in the hillside above the ancient &#x27;pol&#x27; or gateway at the ruins near Lashkar Gah. This is possibly the entrance to one of the man-made undergrounds at Qala-e-Bost.&quot;

On 7 October 2002, banknotes were introduced in denominations of Af. 1, Afs. 2, Afs. 5, Afs. 10, Afs. 20, Afs. 50, Afs. 100, Afs. 500, and Afs. 1,000. The Af. 1, Afs. 2 and Afs. 5 notes were replaced by coins in 2005. In 2004 and 2008, the security features on several denominations were improved. In 2014 a new Afs. 1,000 note was introduced to prevent counterfeit notes.

<text>Modern English, sometimes called New English (NE) or present-day English (PDE) as opposed to Middle and Old English, is the form of the English language that has been spoken since the Great Vowel Shift in England, which began in the late 14th century and was completed by the 17th century.

With some differences in vocabulary, texts which date from the early 17th century, such as the works of William Shakespeare and the King James Bible, are considered Modern English texts, or more specifically, they are referred to as texts which were written in Early Modern English or they are referred to as texts which were written in Elizabethan English. Through colonization, English was adopted in many regions of the world by the British Empire, such as Anglo-America, the Indian subcontinent, Africa, Australia and New Zealand.

Modern English has many dialects spoken in many countries throughout the world, sometimes collectively referred to as the English-speaking world. These dialects include (but are not limited to) American, Australian, British (containing Anglo-English, Scottish English and Welsh English), Canadian, New Zealand, Caribbean, Hiberno-English (including Ulster English), Indian, Sri Lankan, Pakistani, Nigerian, Philippine, Singaporean, and South African English.

According to the &quot;Ethnologue&quot;, there are almost one billion speakers of English as a first or second language. English is spoken as a first or a second language in many countries, with most native speakers being in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Ireland. It &quot;has more non-native speakers than any other language, is more widely dispersed around the world and is used for more purposes than any other language&quot;. Its large number of speakers, plus its worldwide presence, have made English a common language (lingua franca) &quot;of the airlines, of the sea and shipping, of computer technology, of science and indeed of (global) communication generally&quot;.

==Development==
Modern English evolved from Early Modern English which was used from the beginning of the Tudor period until the Interregnum and Stuart Restoration in England. By the late 18th century, the British Empire had facilitated the spread of Modern English through its colonies and geopolitical dominance. Commerce, science and technology, diplomacy, art, and formal education all contributed to English becoming the first truly global language. Modern English also facilitated worldwide international communication. English was adopted in North America, India, parts of Africa, Australia, and many other regions. In the post-colonial period, some newly created nations that had multiple indigenous languages opted to continue using Modern English as the official language to avoid the political difficulties inherent in promoting one indigenous language above another.

==Outline of changes==
The following is an outline of the major changes in Modern English compared to its previous form (Middle English), and also some major changes in English over the course of the 20th century. Note, however, that these are generalizations, and some of these may not be true for specific dialects:

===Morphology===
* &quot;like&quot;, &quot;same as&quot;, and &quot;immediately&quot; are used as conjunctions.
* &quot;The&quot; becomes optional before certain combinations of noun phrases and proper names.

====Pronouns====
* Loss of distinction in most dialects between &quot;whom&quot; and &quot;who&quot; in favour of the latter.
* The elevation of singular they to some formal registers.
* Placement of frequency adverbs before auxiliary verbs.

====Verbs====
* Regularisation of some English irregular verbs.
* Revival of the present (&quot;mandative&quot;) English subjunctive.
* &quot;Will&quot; preferred to &quot;shall&quot; to mark the future tense in the first person.
* Do-support for the verb &quot;have&quot;.
* Increase in multi-word verbs.
* Development of auxiliary verbs &quot;wanna&quot;, &quot;gonna&quot;, &quot;gotta&quot; in informal discourse.
* Usage of English progressive verbs in certain present perfect and past perfect forms.

===Phonology===
Up until the American–British split (1600–1725), some major phonological changes in English included:
* Initial cluster reductions, like of /ɡn, kn/ into /n/: making homophones of gnat and nat, and not and knot.
* The meet–meat merger in most dialects: making the words &quot;meat&quot;, &quot;threat&quot; and &quot;great&quot; have three different vowels, although all three words once rhymed. 
* The foot–strut split: so that &quot;cut&quot; and &quot;put&quot;, and &quot;pudding&quot; and &quot;budding&quot; no longer rhyme; and &quot;putt&quot; and &quot;put&quot; are no longer homophones.
* The lot–cloth split: the vowel in words like &quot;cloth&quot; and &quot;off&quot; is pronounced with the vowel in &quot;thought&quot;, as opposed to the vowel used in &quot;lot&quot;.

After the American-British split, further changes to English phonology included:
* Non-rhotic (/ɹ/-dropping) accents develop in the English of England, Australasia, and South Africa.
* Happy-tensing: final lax [ɪ] becomes tense [i] in words like &quot;happy&quot;&quot;.&quot; Absent from some dialects.
* Yod-dropping: the elision of /j/ in certain consonant clusters, like those found in &quot;chute&quot;, &quot;rude&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;chews&quot;, and &quot;Zeus&quot;.
* Wine–whine merger from the reduction of /ʍ/ to /w/ in all national standard varieties of English, except Scottish and Irish.
* In North American and Australasian English, /t, d/ are reduced to an alveolar tap between vowels, realised as [t̬] or [ɾ].
* Cot–caught merger the merger of /ɔ/ and /ɑ/ to /ɑ/ in some dialects of General American.

===Syntax===
*disuse of the T–V distinction (thou, ye). Contemporary Modern English usually retains only the formal second-person personal pronoun, &quot;you&quot; (ye), used in both formal and informal contexts.
*use of auxiliary verbs becomes mandatory in interrogative sentences.
*&quot;less&quot;, rather than &quot;fewer&quot;, is used for countable nouns.
*For English comparisons, syntactic comparison (&quot;more&quot;) is preferred to analytic comparison (&quot;-er&quot;).
* Usage of the Saxon genitive (&#x27;s) has extended beyond human referents.

===Alphabet===

Changes in alphabet and spelling were heavily influenced by the advent of printing and continental printing practices. 
*The letter thorn (þ), which began to be replaced by &quot;th&quot; as early as Middle English, finally fell into disuse. In Early Modern English printing, thorn was represented with the Latin &quot;y&quot;, which appeared similar to thorn in blackletter typeface (𝖞). The last vestige of the letter was in ligatures of thorn, ye (thee), yt (that), yu (thou), which were still seen occasionally in the King James Bible of 1611 and in Shakespeare&#x27;s folios.
*The letters &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot;, previously written as a single letter, began to be distinguished; likewise for &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot;. This was a common development of the Latin alphabet during this period.
Consequently, Modern English came to use a purely Latin alphabet of 26 letters.

<doc id="188972" wikidata="Q410572" url="?curid=188972" title="Silane">
<text>Silane (Silicane) is an inorganic compound with chemical formula . It is a colorless, pyrophoric gas with a sharp, repulsive, pungent smell, somewhat similar to that of acetic acid. Silane is of practical interest as a precursor to elemental silicon. Silanes with alkyl groups are effective water repellents for mineral surfaces such as concrete and masonry. Silanes with both organic and inorganic attachments are used as coupling agents. They are commonly used to apply coatings to surfaces or as an adhesion promoter.

==Production==

===Commercial-scale routes===
Silane can be produced by several routes. Typically, it arises from the reaction of hydrogen chloride with magnesium silicide:

It is also prepared from metallurgical-grade silicon in a two-step process. First, silicon is treated with hydrogen chloride at about 300 °C to produce trichlorosilane, HSiCl3, along with hydrogen gas, according to the chemical equation

The trichlorosilane is then converted to a mixture of silane and silicon tetrachloride:
This redistribution reaction requires a catalyst.

The most commonly used catalysts for this process are metal halides, particularly aluminium chloride. This is referred to as a redistribution reaction, which is a double displacement involving the same central element. It may also be thought of as a disproportionation reaction, even though there is no change in the oxidation number for silicon (Si has a nominal oxidation number IV in all three species). However, the utility of the oxidation number concept for a covalent molecule, even a polar covalent molecule, is ambiguous. The silicon atom could be rationalized as having the highest formal oxidation state and partial positive charge in and the lowest formal oxidation state in , since Cl is far more electronegative than is H.

An alternative industrial process for the preparation of very high-purity silane, suitable for use in the production of semiconductor-grade silicon, starts with metallurgical-grade silicon, hydrogen, and silicon tetrachloride and involves a complex series of redistribution reactions (producing byproducts that are recycled in the process) and distillations. The reactions are summarized below:
# 
# 

The silane produced by this route can be thermally decomposed to produce high-purity silicon and hydrogen in a single pass.

Still other industrial routes to silane involve reduction of silicon tetrafluoride () with sodium hydride (NaH) or reduction of with lithium aluminium hydride ().

Another commercial production of silane involves reduction of silicon dioxide () under Al and gas in a mixture of NaCl and aluminum chloride () at high pressures:

===Laboratory-scale routes===
In 1857, the German chemists Heinrich Buff and Friedrich Woehler discovered silane among the products formed by the action of hydrochloric acid on aluminum silicide, which they had previously prepared. They called the compound &quot;siliciuretted hydrogen&quot;.

For classroom demonstrations, silane can be produced by heating sand with magnesium powder to produce magnesium silicide (), then pouring the mixture into hydrochloric acid. The magnesium silicide reacts with the acid to produce silane gas, which burns on contact with air and produces tiny explosions. This may be classified as a heterogeneous acid–base chemical reaction, since the isolated ion in the antifluorite structure can serve as a Brønsted–Lowry base capable of accepting four protons. It can be written as

In general, the alkaline-earth metals form silicides with the following stoichiometries: , , and . In all cases, these substances react with Brønsted–Lowry acids to produce some type of hydride of silicon that is dependent on the Si anion connectivity in the silicide. The possible products include and/or higher molecules in the homologous series , a polymeric silicon hydride, or a silicic acid. Hence, with their zigzag chains of anions (containing two lone pairs of electrons on each Si anion that can accept protons) yield the polymeric hydride .

Yet another small-scale route for the production of silane is from the action of sodium amalgam on dichlorosilane, , to yield monosilane along with some yellow polymerized silicon hydride .

==Properties==
Silane is the silicon analogue of methane. All four bonds are equal and their length is 147.98 pm. Because of the greater electronegativity of hydrogen in comparison to silicon, this Si–H bond polarity is the opposite of that in the C–H bonds of methane. One consequence of this reversed polarity is the greater tendency of silane to form complexes with transition metals. A second consequence is that silane is pyrophoric — it undergoes spontaneous combustion in air, without the need for external ignition. However, the difficulties in explaining the available (often contradictory) combustion data are ascribed to the fact that silane itself is stable and that the natural formation of larger silanes during production, as well as the sensitivity of combustion to impurities such as moisture and to the catalytic effects of container surfaces causes its pyrophoricity. Above , silane decomposes into silicon and hydrogen; it can therefore be used in the chemical vapor deposition of silicon.

The Si–H bond strength is around 384 kJ/mol, which is about 20% weaker than the H–H bond in . Consequently, compounds containing Si–H bonds are much more reactive than is . The strength of the Si–H bond is modestly affected by other substituents: the Si–H bond strengths are: 419 kJ/mol, 382 kJ/mol, and SiHMe3 398 kJ/mol.

==Applications==
While diverse applications exist for organosilanes, silane itself has one dominant application, as a precursor to elemental silicon, particularly in the semiconductor industry. The higher silanes, such as di- and trisilane, are only of academic interest. About 300 metric tons per year of silane were consumed in the late 1990s. Low-cost solar photovoltaic module manufacturing has led to substantial consumption of silane for depositing hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) on glass and other substrates like metal and plastic. The plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) process is relatively inefficient at materials utilization with approximately 85% of the silane being wasted. To reduce the waste and ecological footprint of a-Si:H-based solar cells further, several recycling efforts have been developed.

==Safety and precautions==
A number of fatal industrial accidents produced by combustion and detonation of leaked silane in air have been reported.

Silane is a pyrophoric gas (capable of autoignition at temperatures below ).
:formula_1
:
:
For lean mixtures a two-stage reaction process has been proposed, which consists of a silane consumption process and a hydrogen oxidation process. The heat of condensation increases the burning velocity due to thermal feedback.

Diluted silane mixtures with inert gases such as nitrogen or argon are even more likely to ignite when leaked into open air, compared to pure silane: even a 1% mixture of silane in pure nitrogen easily ignites when exposed to air.

In Japan, in order to reduce the danger of silane for amorphous silicon solar cell manufacturing, several companies began to dilute silane with hydrogen gas. This resulted in a symbiotic benefit of making more stable solar photovoltaic cells as it reduced the Staebler–Wronski effect.

Unlike methane, silane is slightly toxic: the lethal concentration in air for rats (LC50) is 0.96% (9,600 ppm) over a 4-hour exposure. In addition, contact with eyes may form silicic acid with resultant irritation.

In regards to occupational exposure of silane to workers, the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has set a recommended exposure limit of 5 ppm (7 mg/m3) over an eight-hour time-weighted average.

<doc id="188978" wikidata="Q433051" url="?curid=188978" title="Salmon P. Chase">
<text>Salmon Portland Chase (January 13, 1808May 7, 1873) was an American politician and jurist who served as the sixth chief justice of the United States from 1864 to his death in 1873. Chase served as the 23rd governor of Ohio from 1856 to 1860, represented Ohio in the United States Senate from 1849 to 1855 and again in 1861, and served as the 25th United States secretary of the treasury from 1861 to 1864 during the administration of Abraham Lincoln. Chase is therefore one of the few American politicians who have held constitutional office in all three branches of the federal government, in addition to serving in the highest state-level office. Prior to his Supreme Court appointment, Chase was widely seen as a potential president.

Born in Cornish, New Hampshire, Chase studied law under Attorney General William Wirt before establishing a legal practice in Cincinnati. He became an anti-slavery activist and frequently defended fugitive slaves in court. Chase left the Whig Party in 1841 to become the leader of Ohio&#x27;s Liberty Party. In 1848, he helped establish the Free Soil Party and recruited former President Martin Van Buren to serve as the party&#x27;s presidential nominee. Chase won election to the Senate the following year, and he opposed the Compromise of 1850 and the Kansas–Nebraska Act. In the aftermath of the Kansas–Nebraska Act, Chase helped establish the Republican Party, which opposed the extension of slavery into the territories. After leaving the Senate, Chase served as the governor of Ohio from 1856 to 1860.

Chase sought the Republican nomination for president in the 1860 presidential election, but the party chose Abraham Lincoln at its National Convention. After Lincoln won the election, he asked Chase to serve as Secretary of the Treasury. Chase served in that position from 1861 to 1864, working hard to ensure the Union was well-financed during the Civil War. Chase resigned from the Cabinet in June 1864, but retained support among the Radical Republicans. Partly to appease the Radical Republicans, Lincoln nominated Chase to fill the Supreme Court vacancy that arose following Chief Justice Roger Taney&#x27;s death.

Chase served as Chief Justice from 1864 to his death in 1873. He presided over the Senate trial of President Andrew Johnson during the impeachment proceedings of 1868. Despite his nomination to the court, Chase continued to pursue the presidency. He unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1868 and the Liberal Republican nomination in 1872.
== Early years ==
Chase was born in Cornish, New Hampshire, on January 13, 1808, to Janette Ralston and Ithamar Chase, who died in 1817 when Salmon was nine years old. His paternal immigrant ancestor was Aquila Chase from Cornwall, England, a ship-master who settled in Newbury, Massachusetts, about 1640, while his maternal grandparents Alexander Ralston and Janette Balloch were Scottish, originally from Falkirk. His mother was left with ten children and few resources, and so Salmon lived from 1820 to 1824 in Ohio with his uncle, Bishop Philander Chase, a leading figure in the Protestant Episcopal Church in the West and the founder of Kenyon College. U.S. Senator Dudley Chase of Vermont was another uncle.
He studied in the common schools of Windsor, Vermont, and Worthington, Ohio, and at Cincinnati College before entering the junior class at Dartmouth College. He was a member of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity and Phi Beta Kappa, and graduated from Dartmouth with distinction in 1826. While at Dartmouth, he taught at the Royalton Academy in Royalton, Vermont. Chase then moved to the District of Columbia, where he opened a classical school while studying law under U.S. Attorney General William Wirt. He was admitted to the bar in 1829.

Chase married his first wife Katherine Jane Garniss on March 4, 1834. She died the following year after the birth of a girl who died a few years later. He married his second wife Eliza Ann Smith on September 26, 1839, who died from consumption years later. Chase married his third wife, Sarah Bella Dunlop Ludlow who also died from consumption. After her death, he did not remarry.

The Salmon P. Chase Birthplace and childhood home still stands in Cornish, New Hampshire.

== Legal and political career ==
Chase moved to a country home near Loveland, Ohio, and practiced law in Cincinnati from 1830. He rose to prominence for his authoritative compilation of the state&#x27;s statutes, which long remained the standard work on the topic.

From the beginning, despite the risk to his livelihood, he defended people who had escaped slavery and those who were tried for assisting them, notably the Matilda Case in 1837. He became particularly devoted to the abolition of slavery after the death of his first wife, Katherine Jane Garmiss, in 1835, shortly after their March 1834 wedding. This event was a spiritual reawakening for him. He worked initially with the American Sunday School Union. At a time when public opinion in Cincinnati was dominated by Southern business connections, Chase, influenced by local events, including the attack on the press of James G. Birney during the Cincinnati riots of 1836, associated himself with the anti-slavery movement. Chase was also a member of the literary Semi-Colon Club; its members included Harriet Beecher Stowe and Calvin Ellis Stowe. Chase became the leader of the political reformers, as opposed to the Garrisonian abolitionist movement.

For his defense of people arrested in Ohio under the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793, Chase was dubbed the &quot;Attorney General for Fugitive Slaves.&quot; His argument in the case of &quot;Jones v. Van Zandt&quot; on the constitutionality of fugitive slave laws before the U.S. Supreme Court attracted particular attention. Chase contended that slavery was local, not national, and that it could exist only by virtue of positive state law. He argued that the federal government was not empowered by the Constitution to create slavery anywhere and that when an enslaved person leaves the jurisdiction of a state where slavery is legal, he ceases to be a slave; he continues to be a man and leaves behind the law that made him a slave. In this and similar cases, the court ruled against him, and the judgment against John Van Zandt was upheld.

Though elected as a Whig to a one-year term on the Cincinnati City Council in 1840, Chase left that party the next year. In the 1840s, he helped to form the Liberty Party. For seven years, Chase was the leader of the Liberty Party in Ohio. He helped balance its idealism with his pragmatic approach and political thought. Chase was skillful in drafting platforms and addresses, and he prepared the national Liberty platform of 1843 and the Liberty address of 1845. Building the Liberty Party was slow going. By 1848, Chase was the leader in the effort to combine the Liberty Party with the Barnburners or Van Buren Democrats of New York to form the Free Soil Party.
Chase drafted the Free-Soil platform, and it was chiefly through his influence that Van Buren was their nominee for president in 1848. In 1849, Chase was elected to the U.S. Senate from Ohio on the Free Soil ticket. Chase&#x27;s goal, however, was not to establish a permanent new party organization, but to bring pressure to bear upon Northern Democrats to force them to oppose the extension of slavery. During his associations with the Liberty and Free Soil parties, Chase considered himself an &quot;Independent Democrat&quot; or a &quot;Free Democrat&quot;.

While serving in the Senate (1849–1855), Chase was an anti-slavery champion. He argued against the Compromise of 1850 and the Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854. After the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska legislation and the subsequent violence in Kansas, Chase helped form the Republican Party with former Whigs and anti-slavery members of the American Party. The &quot;Appeal of the Independent Democrats in Congress to the People of the United States&quot;, written by Chase and Giddings, and published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on January 24, 1854, may be regarded as the earliest draft of the Republican party creed. In 1855, Chase was elected the first Republican governor of Ohio. During his time in office, from 1856 to 1860, he supported improved property rights for women, changes to public education, and prison reform.

In 1860, Chase sought the Republican nomination for president, with Massachusetts Governor Nathaniel Banks as his running mate. With the exception of William H. Seward, Chase was the most prominent Republican in the country and had done more to end slavery than any other Republican. However, he opposed a &quot;protective tariff,&quot; favored by most other Republicans, and his record of collaboration with Democrats annoyed the many Republicans who were former Whigs. At the 1860 Republican National Convention, he got 49 votes on the first ballot, but he had little support outside of Ohio. Abraham Lincoln won the nomination, and Chase supported him.

Chase was elected as a Republican to the U.S. Senate from Ohio in 1860. However, he resigned shortly after taking his seat in order to become Secretary of the Treasury under Lincoln. This was despite no prior financial experience; rather obtained through Chase&#x27;s nomination of Lincoln. He was also a participant in the February 1861 Peace Conference in Washington, D.C., a meeting of leading American politicians held in an effort to resolve the burgeoning secession crisis and to preserve the Union on the eve of the Civil War.

== Secretary of the Treasury ==

During the Civil War, Chase served as Secretary of the Treasury in President Lincoln&#x27;s cabinet from 1861 to 1864. In that period of crisis, there were two great changes in American financial policy: the establishment of a national banking system and the issue of paper currency. The former was Chase&#x27;s own particular measure. He suggested the idea, worked out the important principles and many of the details, and induced the Congress to approve them. It secured an immediate market for government bonds and provided a permanent, uniform, and stable national currency. Chase ensured that the Union could sell debt to pay for the war effort. He worked with Jay Cooke &amp; Company to successfully manage the sale of $500 million (~$ in ) in government war bonds (known as 5/20s) in 1862.

The first U.S. federal currency, the greenback demand note, was printed in 1861–1862 during Chase&#x27;s tenure as Secretary of the Treasury, and it was his responsibility to design the notes. In an effort to increase the public&#x27;s recognition of him, Chase put his own face on a variety of U.S. paper currency, starting with the $1 bill, possibly to further his political career. It was engraved by Joseph Prosper Ourdan.

On May 5, 1862, Chase accompanied President Lincoln, Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, and Brigadier General Egbert Ludovicus Viele in what would become a pivotal week for Union forces. The presidential party left the Washington Navy Yard aboard a five-gun Treasury cutter, &quot;Miami&quot;, bound for Fort Monroe &quot;to ascertain by personal observation whether some further vigilance and vigor might not be infused into the operations of the army and navy at that point&quot; to determine whether Norfolk could be captured. After a 27-hour trip, the &quot;Miami&quot; reached Fort Monroe on the night of May 6. Chase went with Major General John E. Wool, in command of the Federals at Fort Monroe, to inspect beach locations for a potential troop landing and relayed to Lincoln that he and General Wool had found &quot;a good and convenient landing place&quot; on the south shore, safely away from the Confederates&#x27; ironclad, the CSS &quot;Virginia&quot;. Chase&#x27;s participation in the reconnaissance ended with the surrender of Norfolk and the destruction of the &quot;Virginia&quot;.

On October 10, 1862, Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles wrote that &quot;a scheme for permits, special favors, Treasury agents, and improper management&quot; existed and was arranged by Treasury Secretary Chase for General John A. Dix. The motive of Chase appeared to be for political influence and not for financial gain.

Perhaps Chase&#x27;s chief defect was an insatiable desire for high office. Throughout his term as Treasury Secretary, Chase exploited his position to build up political support for another run at the presidency in 1864. Benjamin Wade, a Republican commented: &quot;Chase is a good man but his theology is unsound. He thinks there is a fourth person in the Trinity.&quot;

He also tried to pressure Lincoln by repeatedly threatening resignation, which he knew would cause Lincoln difficulties with the Radical Republicans.

To honor Chase for introducing the modern system of banknotes, he was depicted on the $10,000 bill printed from 1928 to 1946. Chase was instrumental in placing the phrase &quot;In God We Trust&quot; on United States coins in 1864.

== Chief Justice ==
In June 1864, Lincoln surprised Chase by accepting his fourth offer of resignation as Treasury Secretary. The Republican Party had at that point already nominated Lincoln as its presidential candidate and the Treasury was in solid shape, so Lincoln no longer needed to keep Chase in the cabinet to forestall a challenge for the presidential nomination. But to placate the party&#x27;s Radical wing, Lincoln mentioned Chase as a potential Supreme Court nominee.

When Chief Justice Roger B. Taney died in October 1864, Lincoln named Chase to succeed him. Nominated on December 6, 1864, and confirmed by the U.S. Senate on the same day, he was sworn into office on December 15, 1864, and served until his death on May 7, 1873. One of Chase&#x27;s first acts as Chief Justice was to admit John Rock to the Supreme Court Bar, making him the first African-American attorney eligible to argue cases before the Supreme Court.

Among his more significant decisions while on the Court were:
* &quot;Texas v. White&quot;, 74 U.S. 700 (1869), in which he asserted that the Constitution provided for a permanent union, composed of indestructible states, while allowing some possibility of divisibility &quot;through revolution, or through consent of the States&quot;;
* &quot;Veazie Bank v. Fenno&quot;, 75 U.S. 533 (1869), upholding banking legislation of the Civil War that imposed a 10% tax on state banknotes; and
* &quot;Hepburn v. Griswold&quot;, 75 U.S. 603 (1870), which declared certain parts of the legal tender acts to be unconstitutional. When the legal tender decision was reversed after the appointment of new justices, in 1871 and 1872 (&quot;Legal Tender Cases&quot;, 79 U.S. 457), Chase dissented.

As Chief Justice, Chase also presided at the impeachment trial of U.S. President Andrew Johnson in 1868. As the justice responsible for the 4th Circuit, Chase also would have been one of two judges at the trial of Jefferson Davis (who was imprisoned at Fort Monroe in Virginia), because trial for major crimes such as treason required two judges. However, Davis&#x27;s best defense would be that he forfeited U.S. citizenship upon secession, and therefore could not have committed treason. Convicting Davis could also interfere with Chase&#x27;s presidential ambitions, described below. After the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, Chase invited Davis&#x27;s lawyer to meet with him privately, and explained his theory that Section 3 of the new Amendment prohibited imposing further punishment on former Confederates. When Davis&#x27;s lawyer repeated this argument in open court, Chase dismissed the case, over the objection of his colleague, U.S. District Judge John Curtiss Underwood, and the government chose not to appeal the dismissal to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Chase made an unsuccessful effort to secure the Democratic nomination for the presidency in 1868. He &quot;was passed over because of his stance in favor of voting rights for black men.&quot; In 1871, the New Departure policy of Ohio Democrat Clement Vallandigham was endorsed by Chase. He helped found the Liberal Republican Party in 1872, unsuccessfully seeking its presidential nomination. Chase was also a Freemason, active in the lodges of Midwestern society. He collaborated with John Purdue, the founder of Lafayette Bank and Purdue University. Eventually, JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co. would purchase Purdue National Corporation of Lafayette, Indiana, in 1984.

As early as 1868, Chase concluded that:

A few months before his death, Chase found himself in the minority of a 5–4 ruling in the Slaughter-House Cases, which greatly limited the scope of the powers given the federal government under the Fourteenth Amendment to protect Americans from state violations of their civil rights. With the other dissenters, Chase joined the dissent of Justice Stephen J. Field that the majority opinion effectively rendered the Fourteenth Amendment a &quot;vain and idle enactment.&quot;

On October 23, 1873, in formally announcing the death of Chief Justice Chase in the Supreme Court and conveying the resolutions submitted by the bar, Attorney General George Henry Williams highlighted Chase&#x27;s &quot;early, continued and effectual labours for the universal freedom of man.&quot;

== Death ==
Chase died of a stroke in New York City on May 7, 1873. His remains were first interred in Oak Hill Cemetery in Washington, D.C., then re-interred in October 1886 in Spring Grove Cemetery, Cincinnati, Ohio. Chase had been an active member of St. Paul Episcopal Cathedral, Cincinnati. Chase&#x27;s birthplace in New Hampshire was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1975.

==Legacy==

After Chase&#x27;s death in 1873, the Supreme Court established a tradition that a newly deceased Justice&#x27;s chair and the front of the bench where the Justice sat will be draped with black wool crêpe, with black crêpe hung over the Court&#x27;s entrance.

The Chase National Bank, a predecessor of Chase Manhattan Bank which is now JPMorgan Chase, was named in his honor, though he had no affiliation with it, financial or otherwise.

In 1845, Chase was presented with a silver pitcher by black leaders in the city of Cincinnati. Engraved on the pitcher were the words “A testimonial of gratitude to Salmon P. Chase from the Colored People of Cincinnati for his various public services in behalf of the oppressed.

In May 1865, Chase was elected a 3rd class companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States (MOLLUS). MOLLUS was an organization of Union officers who had served in the Civil War which allowed distinguished civilians who had supported the Union cause to join as 3rd class companions. Chase was one of the first to receive this honor and was assigned MOLLUS insignia number 46.

Chase&#x27;s portrait appears on the United States $10,000 bill, the largest denomination of U.S. currency to publicly circulate. The bill was last printed in 1945. In 1969, the Federal Reserve began withdrawing high-denomination bills from circulation, and as of 2009, only 336 $10,000 bills had not been returned for destruction.

Chase County, Kansas, Chase City, Virginia, and towns named &quot;Chaseville&quot; in Florida, Massachusetts, North Carolina (from 1868 to 1871), New York, Ohio, and Tennessee were named in his honor. Camp Chase in Columbus, Ohio, and Chase Hall, the main barracks and dormitory at the United States Coast Guard Academy, are named for Chase in honor of his service as Secretary of the Treasury, and the United States Coast Guard cutter &quot;Chase&quot; (WHEC 718) is named for him, as are Chase Hall at the Harvard Business School, Chase House at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College, and the Salmon P. Chase College of Law at Northern Kentucky University. He is featured on a New Hampshire historical marker (number 76) along New Hampshire Route 12A in Cornish.

==In popular culture==

Although not referred to by name, Chase was portrayed by Montagu Love in the 1942 film &quot;Tennessee Johnson&quot; and appears during Andrew Johnson&#x27;s impeachment scenes. Chase was also portrayed by Josh Stamberg in the 2013 movie &quot;Saving Lincoln&quot;.

Chase was portrayed by Mark Rand in the 2024 Apple TV+ miniseries series &quot;Manhunt&quot;.

<text>Arriva Trains Merseyside was a train operating company in England owned by Arriva that operated the Merseyrail Electrics franchise from January 1997 until July 2003, when the Merseyrail railway franchise was transformed into the local Merseyrail concession, owned by the Merseyrail Passenger Transport Executive (Merseytravel).

==History==
The Merseyrail Electrics franchise was awarded by the Director of Passenger Rail Franchising to MTL with operations commencing on 19 January 1997. MTL retained the Merseyrail Electrics brand.

On 18 February 2000, MTL was purchased by Arriva, and on 27 April 2001, rebranded as Arriva Trains Merseyside.

On 23 April 2003, Serco-Abellio were awarded the Merseyrail Electrics franchise with the services operated by Arriva Trains Merseyside transferring to Merseyrail on 20 July 2003.

==Rolling stock==
Arriva Trains Merseyside inherited a fleet of Class 507 and Class 508 electric multiple units from Regional Railways. It also inherited a fleet of Class 73 locomotives and Class 936 EMUs for use on infrastructure trains; these were sold in 2002.

==Depot==
Arriva Trains Merseyside&#x27;s fleet was maintained at Birkenhead North Depot.
